Gentlemen,  
						Department of State July 30th. 1807  
					  
					Your letter of April 25th. inclosing the British project of a Convention of limits, and your proposed amendments, has been duly received. The following observations explain the terms on which the President authorizes you to close and sign the  
						instrument.  
					lst. The modification of the 5th. Art. (noted as one which the British Commissioners would have agreed to) may be admitted, in case that proposed by you to them, be not attainable. But it is much to be wished and pressed, tho’ not made an ultimatum, that  
						the proviso to both should be omitted. This is in no view whatever necessary; and can have little other effect, than as an offensive intimation to Spain, that our claims extend to the pacific ocean. However reasonable such claims may be compared with those of others, it is  
						impolitic, especially at the present moment, to strengthen Spanish jealousies of the United States, which it is probably an object with Great Britain to excite by the clause in question.  
					2d. The privileges of British trade and intercourse with the Indians, allowed by existing stipulations, are not to be extended to Indians dwelling within the limits of the United States--as determined by the Treaty of peace.  
					The motives for excluding foreign traders from the territories of the United States westward of the Mississippi have been heretofore stated to you. These motives gain strength daily. It is manifest also that the proposition on the part of Great Britain,  
						fails essentially in the point of real and fair reciprocity; first as it excepts the possessions of the Hudson’s Bay Company, without any equivalent exception on our side of the boundary: secondly, as the use of the privilege by our traders on the British side of the boundary  
						is known to be attended with danger and secret obstructions, to which British traders on our Side of the Boundary are in no degree exposed: thirdly, as all chance of competition with British traders on the British side would be completely frustrated by the disparity of duties  
						and of prices, under which the american and British traders would respectively carry their merchandize to the Indian market on that Side. The British Government now complains of the disadvantage resulting to their Indian traders on the Eastern side of the Mississippi from an  
						excess of duty amounting to about 6 p Cent. In the Indian trade within the British territory, the difference against our traders is equal to the difference between the duties imposed in the United States, and those imposed in Canada, or rather, as no duties are probably  
						imposed in Canada; equal to the full amount imposed in the United States that is to 15 or 20 p Ct. It is enough to be under this inequality, as it relates to the existing stipulation. To extend it as proposed is more than can be fairly expected. The bargain would be Still far  
						worse on our side, if the British proposals contemplate a free access to the waters westward of the Mississippi, with goods free of duty for the Indians of Louisiana.  
					Having already transmitted to Mr. Monroe sundry documents throwing light on our relations with the Indians in the Northwest quarter, I add a few others not a little curious, as well as not uninteresting.  
					3d. Access by land or inland navigation from the British territories, thro’ the territory of the United States to the river Mississippi, is not to be allowed to British subjects with their goods or effects, unless such articles shall have paid all the  
						duties, and be within all the custom House regulations, applicable to goods and effects of Citizens of the United States. An access thro’ the territory of the United States to the Waters running into the Western side of the Mississippi, is under no modification whatever to be  
						stipulated to British subjects.  
					There can be no good reason with Great Britain for wishing an access to the Mississippi for goods free of duty; because the river can never be a high way to any other market than the consumption of our Citizens and as this cannot be attained without a  
						previous payment of the usual duties, it must be the same thing whether the duties be paid on or after entering the limits of the United States: or rather the only difference would be in the greater facility of evading the duties in the latter than in the former case; a  
						facility which cannot be supposed to be approved by Great Britain, or admissible by the United States.  
					4 It may be agreed, that the ad valorum duties now payable on goods imported into the United States from the neighbouring territories of Great Britain shall be regulated according to the value thereof, estimated in the same manner as if directly imported  
						from beyond sea, and that licences to Indian Traders, and passes for their canoes and carriages, shall be freely granted, but that the British traders shall in all respects be subject to the restrictions and precautions with respect to the articles to be supplied to the  
						Indians, as are imposed on Citizens of the United States engaged in the same trade.  
					I have only to express the Presidents approbation of the idea of keeping open, for future decision our right to the Island of Grand Menan, and to suggest as a desirable addition to the 8th. art. a clause providing &quot;that in the mean time British vessels  
						shall not be restrained from carrying plaister &amp;c to any ports of the United States&quot;. It appears that a disposition exists to compel the British vessels to trade to the more distant ports of the United States, instead of resorting to the nearer ones, whence the plaister  
						&amp;c is now conveyed by vessels of the United States. For the spirit and outrages which prevail in that quarter, I refer to the communications from the Collector of Passamaquoddy, herewith inclosed. Affidavits of the facts stated by the Collector, have also been transmitted

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  
July 30, 1S0E  
Gentlemew,  
Vour Letter c.f April 25th, in­  
closing the British pr ject of a convention cf  
limits, and your proposed amendments, has  
been.duly received, The following ohserva­  
tionsexplain the terms on which the presi­  
dent authorises you to close and sign the in  
strunient.  
1st. &#x27;File modification of the 5th article,  
(noted as one which the British commis&#x27; irn­  
ers would have agreed to) may be admitted;  
in case that proposed!))&#x27; you to the .. be not  
attainable. But it is much to be wished and  
pressed, though not made an ultimatum, that  
the proviso to both should be omitted. 1 his  
is in no view whatever, necessary ; and can  
have little other effect than as an ofluisivfc  
intimation to Spain, that our claims extend  
to the Pacific Ocean. However reasonable  
such claims may be, compared with those of  
others, it is impolitic, especially at the pie­  
sent moment, to strengthen Spanish jealou­  
sies of the United State^ which it is proba­  
bly an object withG. Bntaiu to excite by the  
clause in question.  
2d. The privileges of British trade and  
intercourse with the Indians, allowe 1 bv ex­  
isting stipulations, arc not to be extended to  
Indians dwelling within the limits of the Uni­  
ted States, as determined by the treaty oi  
peace.  
  
I he. motives for excluding foreign trtfder*  
from the territories of the United States,  
westward of the Mississippi, have been here­  
tofore stated to you. These motive* giin  
strength daily. It is manifest a! m, that’1 he  
proposition on the part of Ureat-Britain, fails  
essentially in the point of real and fain reci­  
procity ; first, as it except* the possession*  
of the Hudson’s 15ay Company, without any  
equivalent exception on our aide of the f &gt;un­

boundary is known to he attended with dm­  
gor and secret obs&#x27;.r lotions, to which Hvtti ;h

disparity of duties and of prices, under which

than can be fairly expected. The bargain  
would be still far worse oa our side, if the  
‘British proposals contemplate a five access,  
to the waters westward of the Mississippi,  
■with goods free of duty lot* the Indians ot,

rit ay of the U. S. to tl»e river Mississippi, is

tory of the United States, to the waters rua­  
&#x27;ning into the Western side of the Missis­  
sippi, is under no&quot; modification whatever to  
be stipulated to British subject?.  
There can he no good reason with Grcat­

as thiscannot be attained without a previous  
payment of the usual duties, it must be  
vtlie same thing whether the duties, he paid  
.on, or after entering the limits ot the Uni­  
ted States; or rather the only difference  
would lie in the greater facility of evading  
the duties in the latter than in the former  
case ;|a facility which cannot be supposed to  
be approved bv Great Britain, or admissi­  
ble by the United States.  
4th. It may be agreed that the ad valo­  
rem duty now pay able on goods impor­  
ted into the United States from the neigh­  
boring territories of Great-Britainj shall be  
regulated according to the value thereof,  
estimated in the same manner as if directly

the same trade.  
T have only to express the president’s ap­  
probation of the idea of keeping open for fu­  
ture decisirh, our right to the island of Grand  
Men an, and to suggest as a desirable additi­  
on to tli&#x27;e 8th article, a clause providing,  
“that in the mean time British vessels shall  
not be restrained from carrying plaister, See  
to any ports of the United States.”—It ap­  
pears that a disposition exists to compel  
the British vessels to trade to the more dis­  
tant ports of the United States, instead of re­  
torting to the nearer ones, whenpethe plais­

Having already transmitted to Mr. Monroe sundry documents,  
throwing light on our relations with the Indians im the Northwest

The motives for excluding foreign traders from the territories of

essentially in the point of real and fair reciprocity ; first as it ex-  
cepts the possessions of the Mudson’s Bay company, without any  
equivalent exception on our side of the boundary; secondly, as  
the use of the privilege by our traders on the British side of the  
boundary is knowrrto be attended with danger and secret obtsruc-  
tious, .o which British traders on our side of the boundary are in  
no degree exposed ; thirdly, as all chance of competition with Bri-  
tish traders on the British side would be completely frustrated by  
the disparity of duties and of prices, under which the American  
and British traders would respectively carry their merchandize to  
the Indian market on that side. The British government now  
complains of the disadvantage resulting to their Indian traders on  
the eastern side of the Mississippi, from an exsess of duty amount-  
ing toabout6 per cent. In the Indian trade within the British  
territory, the difftrenee against our traders is equal to the differ-  
ence between the duties imposed in the United States, and those  
imposed in Canada, or rather, as noduties are probably imposed  
in Canada, equal to the full amount imposed in the United States,  
that is, 41015 or 20 percent. Itis enough to be_under this inequa-  
  
  
  
that she will attempt to exclude us from the fishe-  
ries as the grand nursery of her seamen, &amp;c.—  
This opinion is strengthened by hosts of “extracts  
of letters” from England. Let those who have  
calculated on the “magnanimity” of Great Bri-

of her justice “are blessed, for they shall not b

ing observations explain the terms on which the

“The modification of the 5th article (noted as one  
which the British commissioners would have agreed  
to) may be admitted, in case that proposed by you to  
them be not attainable. But it is much to be wished
