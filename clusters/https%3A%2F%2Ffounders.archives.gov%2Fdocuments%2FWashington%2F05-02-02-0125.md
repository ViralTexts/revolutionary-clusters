st will be required to render the Practice familiar. We have I think every Reason to wish that the Patriots may be successful. The generous Wish which a free People must form to disseminate Freedom, the grateful Emotion which rejoices in the Happiness of a Benefactor, and a strong personal Interest as well in the Liberty as in the Power of this Country, all conspire to make us far from indifferent Spectators. I say that we have an Interest in the Liberty of France. The Leaders here are our Friends, many  
  
of them have imbibed their Principles in America, and all have been fired by our Example. Their Opponents are by no Means rejoiced at the Success of our Revolution, and many of them are disposed to form Connections of the strictest Kind with Great Britain.

Nor were the clergy any help to the country.

“The higher ranks of the clergy were nobles  
by birth, and shared the habits of their class.  
They absorbed in their enormous incomes the  
greater part of the revenues of the Church.

The most graphic portrayal of the state of French morals

reform. Writing to President Washington he  
says: &quot;We have, I think, every reason to wish  
that the patriots Hafayette and men of that

which a free people must form to disseminate  
freedom, the grateful emotion which rejoices in

all have been fired by our example. Their op­  
ponents are by no means rejoiced at the  
success of our Revolution, and many of  
them are disposed to form connections of  
the strictest kind with Great Britain.

great mass of the people have no religion, no law but
