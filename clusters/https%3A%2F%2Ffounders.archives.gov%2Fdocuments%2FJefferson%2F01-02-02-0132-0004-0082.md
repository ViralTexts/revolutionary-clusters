Well aware that the opinions and belief of men depend not on their own will, but follow involuntarily the evidence proposed to their minds; that Almighty God hath created the mind free, and manifested his supreme will that free it shall remain by making it altogether insusceptible of restraint; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments, or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, who being lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do, but to extend it by its influence on reason alone; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world and through all time: That to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness; and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependance  on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which, in common with his fellow citizens, he has a natural right; that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that the opinions of men are not the object of civil government, nor under its jurisdiction; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency is a dangerous falacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself; that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them.  
We the General Assembly of Virginia do enact that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.  
And though we well know that this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding Assemblies, constituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural  rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right.

That, to compel a man to furniſh contributions of money for the propa-  
gation of opinions which he diſbelieves, is ſinful and tyrannical.  
  
That even the ſorcing him to ſupport this or that teacher of his own reli-  
gious perſuaſion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his  
contributions to the particular paſtor whoſe morals he would make his pat-  
tern, and whoſe powers he feels moſt perivaſive to righteouſneſs, and is with-  
drawing from the miniſtry thoſe temporal rewards which, proceeding from  
an approbation of their perſonal conduct, are an additional incitement to  
earneſt and vnremitting labours for the inſtructions of mankind.  
  
That our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, more  
  
than on our opinions in phyſics or geometry.  
  
That therefore, the proſcribing any citizen as unworthy the public conſi-  
dence, by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of truſt  
and emolument, unleſs he profeſſes or renounces this or that religious opi-  
nion. is depriving him injuriouſly of thoſe privileges and advantages to  
which, in common with his fellow- citizens, he has a natural right.  
  
That it tends alfo to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is  
meant to encourage, by bribing. with a monopoly of worldly honours and  
emoluments, thole who will, externally, profeſs and conform to it.  
  
That though, indeed theſe are criminal who do not withſtand ſuch temp-  
tation, yet neither are thoſe innocent who lay the bait in their way  
  
That to ſuffer the civil magiſtrate to intrude his powers into the field of  
opinion, and to reſtrain the profeſſion or propagation of principles, on ſuppo-  
fition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once deſtroys all  
religious liberty, becauſe he being of courle judge of that tendency, will  
make his opinions the rule of judęment, and approve or condemn the ſenti-  
ments of others only as they ſhall ſquare with or differ from his own.  
  
That it is time enough, for the rightful purp- ſes of civil government, for

peace and good order,  
  
And. finally, that truth is great, and will prevail if left to herſelf; that  
Me is the proper and ſufficient antagoniſt to error, and has nothing to fear

created the mind free; that all attempts  
to influence it by temporal punishments  
or burthens, or by civil  
incapacitations, tend only to beget  
habits of hypocrisy, and are a departure  
from the plan of the Holy Author of our  
religion, who, being Lord of body and  
mind, yet chose not to propagate it by  
coercions on either; that the impious  
presumption of legislators and rulers,  
civil and ecclesiastical (who, being  
themselves but fallible and uninspired  
men, have assumed dominion over the  
faith of others, setting up their own  
opinion and modes of thinking as alone  
true and infallible, and, as such,  
endeavouring to impose them on others),  
hath eBtsblished and maintained false  
religions over the greatest part of the  
world, and through all time; That to  
compel a man to furnish contributions of  
money for the propagation of opinions  
which he disbelieves is sinful and  
tyrannical; that even the forcing of a  
man to support this or that teacher of  
his own religious persuasion is  
depriving him of the comfortable liberty  
of giving his contributions to the  
particular pastor whose morals he would  
make his pattern, and whose powers he  
feels most persuasive to righteousness,  
and withdrawing from the muiistr\r those  
temporal rewards which, proceeding from  
an appi-obation of the personal conduct,  
are an additional incitement to earnest  
and unremitted labours for the  
instruction of mankind; That our civil  
rights have no dependence on our  
religious opinions, any more than on our  
opinions in physic or geometry;-that,  
therefore, the proscribing any citizen  
as unworthy the public confidence by  
la_ying- upon him an incapacity of being  
called to offices of trust and  
emolument, unless he profess or renounce  
this or that religious opinion, as  
depriving him injuriously of those  
privileges and advantages to which, in  
common with his fellow-citizcns, he hag  
a natural right, and tends also to  
corrupt the- principles of that very  
religion it is meant to encourage by  
bribing with a monopoly of worldly  
honours and emoluments those who will  
externally conform to it; that though,  
indeed, those are criminal who do not  
withstand such temptations, yet neither  
are those innocent who lay them in the  
way; That to suffer the civil magistrate  
to intrude his powers into the field of  
opinion, and to restrain the profession  
or propagation of principles on the  
supposition of their ill tendency, is a  
dangerous fallacy^ which at once  
destroys all religious liberty ; because  
he, being of course judge of that  
tendency, will make his opinions the  
rule of judgment, and approve, or  
condemn the sentiments of others, only  
as they shall agree with or differ from  
his own ; that it is time enough, for  
the rightful purposes of civil  
government, for its officers to  
interpose when principles break out in  
overt acts against peace and good order;  
And, finally, that Truth is great, and  
will prevail if left to herself, and is  
the proper and sufficient antagonist to  
Error, and can have nothing to fear from  
the conflict, unless {by human  
interposition) disarmed of her natural  
weapons-free argument and debate ; error  
ceasing to be dangerous when it is  
permitted freely to contradict them. Be  
it therefore enacted, by the General  
Assembly^ that no man shall be.  
compelled to support any religious  
worship, place, 01* ministry whatsoever;  
nor shall be forced, restrained,  
molested, or burthened, in liis body or  
goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on  
account of his religious opinions or  
belief; but all men be free to profess,  
and by argument to maintain, their  
opinion in matters of religion, and that  
the same shall in nowise diminish,  
enlarge, or affect their civil  
capacities. And though we well know that  
this Assembly, elected by the people for  
the ordinary purposes of legislation  
only, have no power to restrain the acts  
of succeeding Assemblies, constituted  
with powers equal to our own, and that,  
therefore, to declare this act  
irrevocable would be of no effect iu law  
; yet we are free to declare, and do  
declare, that the rights hereby  
asserted, are natural rights of mankind,  
and that if any Act shall be hereafter  
passed to repeal the present, or to  
narrow its operation, such Act will be  
an infringement of natural rights

And though we well know this assembly, elec­

Legislature of Virginia, his services  
were needed there. The laws of Eng  
tand and Virginia denounced terrible  
penalties against Atheists, Unitarians,  
Polytheists, etc. And not only so,  
but the people were compelled by law  
to support the established religion.

religion or not. Under these circum.  
stances, Jefferson appeared as the  
champion of religious toleration. The  
bill that he introduced for the estab

remain a monumnent to his memory
