[1–6 August 1774]  
  
At a very full Meeting of delegates from the different Counties in the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, begun in Williamsburg the first Day of August, in the Year of our Lord 1774, and continued by several Adjournments to Saturday the 6th of the same Month, the following association was unanimously resolved upon and agreed to.  
We his Majesty’s dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Delegates of the Freeholders of Virginia deputed to represent them at a general Meeting in the City of Williamsburg, avowing our inviolable and unshaken Fidelity and Attachment to our most gracious Sovereign, our Regard and Affection for all our Friends and Fellow Subjects in Great Britain and elsewhere, protesting against every Act or Thing which may have the most distant Tendency to interrupt, or in any Wise disturb, his Majesty’s Peace, and the good Order of Government within this his ancient Colony, which we are resolved to maintain and defend at the Risk of our Lives and Fortunes; but, at the same Time, affected with the deepest Anxiety, and most alarming Apprehensions, of those Grievances and Distresses by which his Majesty’s American Subjects are oppressed; and having taken under our most serious Deliberation the State of the whole Continent; find, that the present unhappy Situation of our Affairs is chiefly occasioned by certain ill advised Regulations, as well of our Trade as internal Polity, introduced by several unconstitutional Acts of the British Parliament, and, at length, attempted to be enforced by the Hand of Power. Solely influenced by these important and weighty Considerations, we think it an indispensable Duty which we owe to our Country, ourselves, and latest Posterity, to guard against such dangerous and extensive Mischiefs, by every just and proper Means.  
If, by the Measures adopted, some unhappy Consequences and Inconveniencies  should be derived to our Fellow Subjects, whom we wish not to injure in the smallest Degree, we hope, and flatter ourselves, that they will impute them to their real Cause, the hard Necessity to which we are driven.  
That the good People of this Colony may, on so trying an Occasion, continue stedfastly directed to their most essential Interests, in Hopes that they will be influenced and stimulated by our Example to the greatest Industry, the strictest Economy and Frugality, and the Exertion of every publick Virtue; persuaded that the Merchants, Manufacturers, and other Inhabitants of Great Britain, and, above all, that the British Parliament will be convinced how much the true Interest of that Kingdom must depend on the Restoration and Continuance of that mutual Friendship and Cordiality which so happily subsisted between us; we have, unanimously, and with one Voice, entered into the following Resolutions and Association, which we do oblige ourselves, by those sacred Ties of Honour and Love to our Country, strictly to observe: And farther declare, before God and the World, that we will religiously adhere to and keep the same inviolate in every Particular, until Redress of all such American Grievances as may be defined and settled at the General Congress of Delegates from the different Colonies shall be fully obtained, or until this Association shall be abrogated or altered by a general Meeting of the Deputies of this Colony, to be convened as is herein after directed. And we do, with the greatest Earnestness, recommend this our Association to all Gentlemen, Merchants, Traders, and other Inhabitants of this Colony, hoping that they will cheerfully and cordially accede thereto.  
1st. We do hereby resolve and declare, that we will not, either directly or indirectly, after the 1st Day of November next, import from Great Britain any Goods, Wares, or Merchandises whatever, Medicines excepted; nor will we, after that Day, import any British Manufactures, either from the West Indies or any other Place, nor any Article whatever which we shall know, or have Reason to believe, was brought into such Countries from Great Britain; nor will we purchase any such Articles so imported of any Person or Persons whatsoever, except such as are now in the Country, or such as may arrive on or before the said 1st Day of November, in Consequence of Orders already given, and which cannot now be countermanded in Time.  
2dly. We will neither ourselves import, nor purchase, any Slave, or Slaves, imported by any Person, after the 1st Day of November next, either from Africa, the West Indies, or any other Place.  
3dly. Considering the Article of Tea as the detestable Instrument which laid the Foundation of the present Sufferings of our distressed Friends in the Town of Boston; we view it with Horrour; and therefore resolve, that we will not, from this Day, either import Tea of any Kind whatever, nor will we use, or suffer even such of it as is now on Hand to be used, in any of our Families.  
4thly. If the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston, or any other Colony, should, by Violence or dire Necessity, be compelled to pay the East India Company for destroying any Tea, which they have lately by their  Agents unjustly attempted to force into the Colonies, we will not, directly or indirectly, import or purchase any British East India Commodity whatever, till the Company, or some other Person on their Behalf, shall refund and fully restore to the Owners all such Sum or Sums of Money as may be so extorted.  
5thy. We do resolve, that unless American Grievances are redressed before the 10th Day of August, 1775, we will not, after that Day, directly or indirectly, export Tobacco, or any other Article whatever, to Great Britain; nor will we sell any such Articles as we think can be exported to Great Britain with a Prospect of Gain to any Person or Persons whatever, with a Design of putting it into his or their Power to export the same to Great Britain, either on our own, his, or their, Account. And that this Resolution may be the more effectually carried into Execution, we do hereby recommend it to the Inhabitants of this Colony to refrain from the Cultivation of Tobacco, as much as conveniently may be; and, in Lieu thereof, that they will, as we resolve to do, apply their Attention and Industry to the Cultivation of all such Articles as may form a proper Basis for Manufactures of all Sorts, which we will endeavour to encourage throughout this Colony to the utmost of our Abilities.  
6thly. We will endeavour to improve our Breed of Sheep, and increase their Number to the utmost Extent, and to this End we will be as sparing as we conveniently can in killing of Sheep, especially those of the most profitable Kind; and if we should at any Time be overstocked, or can conveniently spare any, we will dispose of them to our Neighbours, especially the poorer Sort of People, upon moderate Terms.  
7thly. Resolved, that the Merchants, and other Venders of Goods and Merchandises within this Colony, ought not to take Advantage of the Scarcity of Goods that may be occasioned by this Association, but that they ought to sell the same at the Rates they have been accustomed to for twelve Months last past; and if they shall sell any such Goods on higher Terms, or shall in any Manner, or by any Device whatever, violate or depart from this Resolution, we will not, and are of Opinion that no Inhabitant of this Colony ought, at any Time thereafter, to deal with any such Persons, their Factors or Agents, for any Commodity whatever. And it is recommended to the Deputies of the several Counties, that Committees be chosen in each County, by such Persons as accede to this Association, to take effectual Care that these Resolves be properly observed, and for corresponding occasionally with the general Committee of Correspondence in the City of Williamsburg. Provided, that if Exchange should rise, such Advance may be made in the Prices of Goods as shall be approved by the Committee of each County.  
8thly. In Order the better to distinguish such worthy Merchants and Traders who are Well-wishers to this Colony, from those who may attempt, through Motives of Self-Interest, to obstruct our Views, we do hereby resolve, that we will not, after the first Day of November next, deal with any Merchant or Trader who will not sign this Association, nor until he hath obtained a Certificate of his having done so from the County Committee, or any three Members thereof. And if any Merchant,  Trader, or other Person, shall import any Goods or Merchandise after the said first Day of November, contrary to this Association, we give it as our Opinion that such Goods and Merchandise should be either forthwith re-shipped or delivered up to the County Committee, to be stored at the Risk of the Importer, unless such Importer shall give a proper Assurance to the said Committee that such Goods or Merchandises shall not be sold within this Colony during the Continuance of this Association; and if such Importer shall refuse to comply with one or the other of these Terms, upon Application and due Caution given to him, or her, by the said Committee, or any three Members thereof, such Committee is required to publish the Truth of the Case in the Gazettes, and in the County where he or she resides, and we will thereafter consider such Person or Persons as inimical to this Country, and break off every Connection and all Dealings with them.  
9thly. Resolved, that if any Person or Persons shall export Tobacco, or any other Commodity, to Great Britain, after the 10th Day of August 1775, contrary to this Association, we shall hold ourselves obliged to consider such Person or Persons as inimical to the Community, and as an Approver of American Grievances; and give it as our Opinion, that the Publick should be advertised of his Conduct, as in the 8th Article is desired.  
10thly. Being fully persuaded that the united Wisdom of the General Congress may improve these our Endeavours to preserve the Rights and Liberties in British America, we decline enlarging at present; but do hereby resolve, that we will conform to, and strictly observe, all such Alterations or Additions, assented to by the Delegates for this Colony, as they may judge it necessary to adopt, after the same shall be published and made known to us.  
11thly. Resolved, that we think ourselves called upon, by every Principle of Humanity and brotherly Affection, to extend the utmost and speediest Relief to our distressed Fellow Subjects in the Town of Boston; and therefore most earnestly recommend it to all the Inhabitants of this Colony to make such liberal Contributions as they can afford, to be collected and remitted to Boston in such Manner as may best answer so desirable a Purpose.  
12thly. and lastly. Resolved, that the Moderator of this Meeting, and, in Case of his Death, robert carter nicholas, Esquire, be empowered, on any future Occasion, that may in his Opinion require it, to convene the several Delegates of this Colony, at such Time and Place as he may judge proper; and, in Case of the Death or Absence of any Delegate, it is recommended that another be chosen in his Place.

We do hereby relblve and declare.  
That we will not, cither dircOly.or indi-  
T^ly, after the firft day of November  
next, import from Great Britain &#x27;any  
goods, wares, or merchandizes whatever^  
(medicines excepted), nor will we, after  
that day, import any Britilh manufac¬  
tures, cither from the Weft-Indies, or a-  
Dy other place, nor any article whatever,  
which we (hall know« or have reafon to  
believe, was brought into fuch countries  
from Great Britain ; nor will we purchafe

arc now in the country, or fgch as rriay  
arrive on or before the faid i ft day of No-^

given, and which cannot now be counter¬  
man ded’in time.  
  
We will neither ourfelvcs import,  
nor purchafe any flave or fTaves, imported  
by any perlbn, after the firft day of No¬  
vember next, either from Africa, the Weft  
Indies, or any other place.  
  
“ Confidcring the article of tea as the  
deteftable inftrnment which laid the foun¬  
dation of the pnefeiit fufferings of our di-  
ftreffed friends in the town of Bofton, we  
view it with horror, and therefore rcfolve,  
that vve will not, from this day, cither&#x27;  
import tea of any kind whatever, nor will  
we nfe, or fuffer even fuch of it as is now  
on hand to be ufed, in any of our fami¬  
lies.  
  
‘‘ If the inhabitants of the town of Bo¬  
fton, or any other colony, fhould, by vio¬  
lence or dire ncceflity, be compelled to  
pay the Eaft-India company for deftroy-  
ing any tea, which they have lately by  
their agents unjuftly attempted to force  
into the colonies, wc wilt not, dircftly or  
indirectly, import or purchafe any Britilh  
Eaft-lndta commodity whatever, till the  
company, or fome other perfon on their  
behalf, Ihall refund and fully rcftorc to  
the owners all fuch fum or Aims of money  
as may be fo extorted,  
  
“ We do refolve, that unlefs American  
grievances arc redrefled before the loth  
day of Auguft 177s, w&#x27;C will not, after  
that day, direCtly or indircCtly, export to¬  
bacco, or any other article whatever, to  
Great Britain ; nor will we fell any fuch  
articles as we think can be exported to  
Great Britain with a profpeCt of gain, to  
any perfon or perfons whatever, with a  
defign of putting if into his or their pow¬  
er to export the fame to Great Britain,  
cither on our own, his, or their account.  
And that this refolution may be the more  
elTlClually carried into execution, we do  
hereby recommend it to the inhabitants of  
this colony to refrain from the cultivation  
of tobacco as much as conveniently may  
be, and in lieu thereof that they will, as  
wc refolve to do, apply their attention and  
induftry to the cultivation of alt fuch ar¬  
ticles as may form a proper bafis for ma¬  
nufactures of all forts, which wc will en¬  
deavour to encourage throughout this co¬  
lony to the utmoft of our abilities.  
  
“ We will endeavour to improve our  
breed of fticep, and increafe their-number  
to the utmoft extent, and to this end, we  
w ill be as fparing as we conveniently can

at any time be overdocked, or can conve¬  
niently /pare any, we will dirpofe of them  
to our neighbours, cfpccialiy the poorer  
Ibrt of people, upon moderate terras.  
  
“ Retblved, that, if any perfon or per-  
fons fhall export tobacco, or any other  
commodity, to Great Britain, after the  
loth day of Augud contrary to this  
  
adbciatioa, we ihall Jiold ourfelves obliged  
to confidcr fuch perfon or perfons as ini¬

prover of American grievances : And  
give it as our opinion that the public  
Aould be advertifed of his condufi.  
  
“ Refolved, that we think ourfelves  
called upon, by every principle of huma¬  
nity and brotherly affefiion, to extend the  
utmod and fpeedied relief to our diftrcficd  
fcllow-fubiecls in the town of Bofton, and  
therefore mod carnedly recommend it to  
all the inhabitants of this colony to make

Virginia Resolves.  
At a very full Meeting of DELEGATES from  
the different Counties in the Colony and Do~  
minion of Virginia, begun in IVilliamfburg  
the fir# Day of August, in the Year of our  
Lord v 774, and continued ly several Ad­  
journments to Saturday the 6th of said Month  
the following Aflociation was unanimouyly  
resolved upon and agreed to.  
WE his Majefty’sdutiful and loyal Subjeéls, the Delegates  
of the Freeholders of VIRGINIA, deputed 1o repre­  
{ent them at a general Meeting in the City of Williamiburg, a+  
vowing our inviclable and unshaken Fidelity and Attachment  
to out most gracious Sovereign, cur Regatd and Affc&amp;ion forall  
our Friends &amp; Fellow Subje€s in Grear Britain and clfewhere,  
protelling against every A&amp; or Thirg, which may have the most  
distant Tendency to interrupt, or in any Wife disturb his Ma­  
jely’s Peace, and the good Osder of Grveroment, within this  
his antient Colony, which we are refulved to maintain and de­  
fend, at the Risk of our Lives and Fortunes, but at the fame  
Time afte@ed with the deepest Anxiety, and most alarmingAp­  
prehenfions, of those Grievances and Distresses by which his  
Majesty&#x27;s American Subjells are opprefled, and having taken  
under our most serious Deliberation the State of the wholeCene  
ticent, find that the present unhappy Situation of our Affairs is  
chiefly occalioned by certain ill advised Regulations, as well of  
our Trade a 3 internal Polity, introduced by several uaconftitu­  
tional A&amp;s of the British Parlisment, and, at Leagth, attempt­  
ed to be enforced by the Hand of Pewer ; solely influenced by  
thele important and weighty Considerations, we think it an in­  
dispensable Duty, which we owe to our Country, ouifelves, and  
latest Poflerity, to guard against such dangerous and extensive  
Mifchiefs, by every juftand proper Meaas,  
If, by the Measures adopted, (cme unhappy Consequences &amp;  
Inconveniences should be derived to our Fellow Subjelts, whom  
we wish not to injure ir the fmallelt Degree, we hope, &amp; flatter  
ourselves, that they will impute them to theix teal Cause---the  
hard Neccﬂitysf) which we are driven,  
That the gdod People of this Colany may, on (o trying an  
Occasion, continue ftedfaflly dire€ted to their e(2ntial Interefls,  
in Hopes that they will beinfluenced and flimulated by our  
Example to the greatelt Industry, the ftriék:® Occonomy, and  
Frugality, and the Exertion of every public Virtue, perfwaded  
that the Merchants, Manufaltuiers, and other Inbhabitants of  
Great-Britain, and above all, that the Briri/h Parliament will  
be convinced how much the true Interest of tha&#x27;Kingdom must  
depend on theßeflaration &amp; Continuance of that mutuaiFiiend­  
fhip and Cordiality, which so happily fublifted between us, we  
have unanimously, and with one Voice, entered iato the fol­  
lowing Resolutions and Aflociation, which we do oblige our­  
selves, by those sacred Ties of Honour and Love to our Coun­  
try, ftri€ly to observe ; and farther declare before God and the  
World,that we will religiously adhere to and keep the fame in­  
violate in every Particalar, until Redress of all such American  
Grievances, as may be defined and fettled at the general Cons  
grefs of Delegates from the diffetent Colonies, shall be fully ob­  
tained, or until this Association fha&#x27;} be abrogated or altered by a  
general Meeting of the Dzputies of this Coloay, to be conven­  
ed, as is hersin after dire@ed, And we do, with the greatest  
Earnestness, recommend this cur Association, to aliGentlemen,  
Merchants, Traders, and other Inhabitaats of this Colony,bop­  
ing that they will chearfully and cordially accede thereto,  
1. We do hereby resolve and declare that we will not,either  
dire@ly or indire@ly, afier the 1t Day of Nowember next, im­  
port from Great-Brirain, any Goods, Wares, or Merchandizes,  
whatever (Medicines excepted) nor will we, after that Day,im­  
port any Bririfb Manuf:Qures, eisher from the 77} Indies, ot  
any other Place, nor any Arsticle whatevey, which we shall  
know, or have Reason to believe, was brought into such Coun­  
tries from Great-Britain 3 nor will we puschafeany such Arti­  
cles so imported, of anyPerfon or Persons whatfoever,except such  
2s are now in the Country, or such as may arrive on or before  
the said 1t Day of Nowember, in Consequence of Orders alicady  
given, and which cannot be countermanded in Time.  
2. We will neither ourselves import, nor purchale, 2anySlave,  
or Slaves, imported by any Person, aftet the Ift day of Nowem.  
next, either from 4, rica, the Weff- Indies, or any other Place.  
3. Considering the Articleof Tea asthe detefiable Inflrument  
which laid the Foundation of the present Sufferings of our dift­  
tefled Friends in the Town of Boson, we view it with Horror,  
&amp; therefore resolve that we will not, from this Day, either im­  
port TEA of any Kind whatever, nor will we use of fuffer even  
such of it as is now on Hand to be used in any of our Families,  
4. If the Inhabitants of the Town of Bofien, or any other  
Cclony, should by Violence or dire Neceflity, be compelled to  
pay the East-India Company for destroying any Tea, which they  
have lately by their Agents attempted to force into theColenies,  
we will not, direétly or indireétly, import or purchase any Bri­  
tith Eafl India Commodity whatever, till the Company, or some  
other Person on their Behalf, shall refund and fully restore to  
the Owners all such Sum or Sums of Money as may be so cx­  
torted.  
5. We do resolve, that unless American Giievances are re­  
dreiled before the loth Day of Auguf?, 1775, we will not, after  
that Day, direly or indireétly, export Tobacco or any other  
Article whatever to Great- Britain 3 nor will we fell any such  
Acrticles as we think can be exported to Great Britain with a  
Profpeé of Gain, to any Person or Persons whatever, with a  
Design of putting it into his or their Power to export the fme  
to Great-Brirain, either cm our own, his or their Account. And  
that this Resolution may be the more effuctually carried into E­  
xecution, we do hereby recommend it to the I-habitants of this  
Colony to refrain Hrom the Cultivation of Tobacco as much as  
conveniently may be, and in Lieu theteof that they will, as we  
resolve to do, apply their Attention and Indufityto the Cultivas  
tion of such Articles as may form 2 proper Dafis for Manufac­  
tures of all Sosts, which we will endeavoar to encouiage thio’-  
out this Colony to the utmost of cur Abilitics,  
6. We will endeavour to improve out Breed of Sheep, and en­  
creafle their Number to the utmeft Extent, and to this Erd, we  
will be as sparing as we can in killing of Sheep, especially those  
of the mot profitable Kind ; and if we should at any Time be  
over stocked, er can conveniently spare any, we will d fpofe us  
them to our Neighbours, efpeciaily the poorer Sort of Peuple,  
vpon moderate Terms. ;  
7. Resolved, that the Merchants and other Venders of Goods  
and Merchandizes within this Colony ought not to take Ad­  
vantage of the Scarcity of Goods that may be occasioned by this  
Afociation, but that they ought to feil the {rme at the Rates  
they have been accustomed to for twelve Months lalt pafl, and  
if they shall fef! any such Goods on higher ‘Ferme, or shall in  
anmy Manner, or by ary device whatever, viclate of depart from  
this Resolution, we will not, and are of Qpinion that no Inha­

the City of Wiiliamfburg. Provided, that if Exchange should  
life, such Advance may be made in the Prices of Goods as shall  
b# approved by the Commitiee of cach County.  
8. 1n order the betier to difliaguifh foch worthy Merchants  
end Traders, who are Well Wifhess to this Coluny, from those  
who may attempt, through Motives of Self-inzereft, to obftivét  
our Views, we do hereby 1l lve that we will not after the firft

will not sign this Association, nor until he bath obtained a  
C:rtificate of his having done o from the County Committee,

give it as our Opinion, thai such Goods and Merchandize should  
beeither forthwith re-shipped or delivered up to the County  
Committee, to be flored at the Rifque of the Impoiter, unless  
such Importer shall givea proper Assurance to the said Commits  
tee that such Goods or Merchandizes shall pot be fold within  
‘this Colony during the Continuance of this Association ; and |  
% such Imoporter shall tefufe to comply with one or the other |

will thereafier confider such Person or Persons as inimical to |  
this Country, and break off every Connc@ion and ail Dealiogs |

9. Refalved, that ifany Petfon or Persons (haill export To- |  
bacco, or any ‘otherCommodity, to Great- Britaiu,after the 10th |  
Day of August, 1775, cortrary to thisAflociation, we Mhall hold |

to theCommuuity, axd as andpprover of American Gricvances ; i  
and give it as ous Opinion that the Public thould be abvertifed |  
of his Condué, asinthe Bth Article is desired. ¢  
10. Being fully persuaded that the united Wisdom of the ge­  
neial Congress may improve these our Endeavours to preserve  
the Rights and Liberties in Biitifb America, we decline enlaig- |  
ing at present, but do hereby resolve that we will conform to, |  
and ftriftly observe, all such Alterations or Additions, zflented |  
to by the Delegates for this Colony, as they may judge it necef- i  
fary to adopt, after the fame shall be publithed and made koown |

burg, in August 1795, we recommend to  
the serious consideration cf our readers.  
On an attentive perusal, we will venture  
to say, that there are but few of the true  
and genuine sons of the ancient dominion,  
who would not cheerfully at this day sub­  
scribe to a similar associa ion.  
1st. VVe do hereby resolve and declare,  
0)at we will not either directly or indirect­  
ly, after the 1st day of November next, im­  
port from G. Britain an. goods, wares, or  
merchandise whatever, medicines except­  
ed ; nor wiil we after that day, import any  
British manufactures, cither from the West  
Indies or any other place, nor any article  
whatever which we shall know, or have rea­  
son to believe, was brought into such conn- j  
tries from G.Britain; nor will wepurciiase  
any such articles so imported of any person  
or persons whatsoever, except such us are  
now in the country, or such as may arrive on  
or before the said 1st day of November, in  
consequence of orders already given, and  
which cannot now be countermanded in  
time.  
2dly. We will neither ourselves import,  
nor purchase any slave or slaves, imported  
by any person after the 1st day of Novem­  
ber next, either from Africa, the Wesl­  
Indies, or any other place.  
3dly. Considering the article ofteaasthe  
detestable instrument which laid the foun­  
dation of the present sufferings of our dis­  
tressed friends in the town of Boston, we  
view it with horror ; and therefore resolve,  
that we will not from this day, either import  
tea of any kind whatever, nor will we use,  
or suffer even such of it as is now on hand  
to he uted, in any of our families.  
  
4tbly. If the inhabitants of the town of  
Boston, or any other colony’, should by vio­  
lence or dire necessity be compelled to pay  
the E ist India co npuny for destroying any  
tea, which they have lately by their agents  
unjustly attempted to force into t ie coin­  
n es, we will not direcdy or indirectly im­  
part or purchase any British India commo­  
dity whatever, till the company, or some o­  
ther person on their behalf, shall refund and  
ful y restore to the owners all such sum  
er sums of money as may be so extorted.  
athlv. We do resolve, that unless Ameri­  
can grievances are redressed before the  
10th day of August, 1775, we will not, af­  
ter that day, directly or indirectly, export  
tob icco, or any other article whatever, to  
Great Britain ; nor will we sell any such  
articles a* wc think can be exported to G.  
Britain with a prospect of gain to any per­  
son or persons whatever, with a design of 1  
putting it into his or their power to export  
the same to G. Britain, cither on our own,  
his, or their account. Ar.d that this reso­  
lution may lie the more effectually carried  
into execution, we do hereby recommend  
it to the inhabitants of this colony to refrain  
from the cultivation of tobacco, as much as  
conveniently may he ; and in lieu thereof  
that they will, as we resolve to do, apply  
their attention and industry to the cirttiva­  
tion of all such articles as may form a pro­  
per busts for manufactures of all sorts,  
which we will endeavor to encourage thro*  
cut thiscolonyto the utmost of our abilities.  
Stilly. We will endeavor to improve our  
breed of sheep, and increase their number  
to the utmost extent, and to this end we  
will he as sparing as we conveniently can  
in killing of sheep, especially those of the  
most profitable kind : and if we should at  
any time ho overstocked, or can convent.,  
ently spare any, we will dispose of them to  
cur neighbors, especially the poorer sort of  
people, upon moderate terms.  
7thly Resolved, that the merchants, and  
other venders of goods and merchandises  
within this colony, ought not to take advan­  
tage of the scarcity of goods that may be  
occasioned by this association, but that they  
ought to sell the same at the ra’esthey have  
been accustomed to for twelve months las*  
past ; and if they shall sell any such goods  
term a #\i* ch 11 a ^ .... ~ „  
  
or by-any device whatever, violate or depart j  
from tliis resolut&#x27;on, we will not, and arc l  
of opinion that no inhabitant of this colony  
ought, at any time thereafter to deal with  
any such persons, their fact irs or agents,  
for any commodity whatever. And it is re­  
commended to the deputies of the several j  
counti s,that committees be chosen in each &#x27;  
county, by such persons as accede to this |  
association, totake effectual care that these I  
resolves be properly &lt; served, ami for for­  
responding occasionally with the general  
committee of correspondence in the city of  
Williamsburg. Provided that if exchange  
should rise, Mich advances may be made in  
the price of goods as shall be approved by  
the committee of each colony.  
8th y. In order the better to distinguish  
such worthy merchants and traders who  
are well-wishers to the colony from those  
who may attempt, thro’motives of rclf-in­  
U rest, *o obstruct n«r views, we do here­  
by resolve, that we will not, after the first  
d ty of November next, deal with any mer­  
chant or trader wh&#x27;-~&#x27;,il not sign this asso­  
cia-ion, nor until he hath obtained a cer­  
tificate ofhishaV&#x27;ng done so from the comi­  
ty Committee or any three members there­  
of. And if any merchant, trader, or other  
person, shall import any goods or merchan­  
dise after the first day of November, con­  
trary to this association, we give it as our  
opinion that such goods and merchandise  
should l&gt;e either forthwith re-shipped or  
delivered up to the county committee, to  
be storrd at the risk of the importer, unless  
such importer shall give a proper assurance  
to the said committee that such goods or  
merchandises shall not In sold within this  
colony during the continuance of this assn,  
elation; and if such imporu-isli.il! refuse  
to comply with one or the other of these !  
terms, upon application and due caution !  
given to hjm, or het, by the said commit- j  
tee, or any three members thereof, vueh  
committee is required to publish the truth!  
of the case in the gazettes, and in the coon­  
ty where he or she resides, and we will  
thereafter consider *tich person or persons  
as inimical to this country, and break off  
every connection and all dealings with ibem  
  
9th!y. Resolved, thf.t If any person or  
persons shall export tobacco, or any other  
commodity, toCi. Britain,after the lO.hdny  
t&gt;4 August, 1775, contrary to this assoc,**tiM  
on, we shall hold out selves obliged to con­  
sider such person or persons as inimical to  
the community, and as an afi/iroverof A­  
merican grievance ; and give it as our «•­  
pinion, that the public should be advertised  
°f his conduct, as in the 8:h article is de­  
sired.  
lOthly. Being fully persuaded that the u­  
mted wisdsm of the general congress may  
improve these endeavors to preserve the  
rights and liberties in British America,  
we decline enlarging at present; but do  
hereby resolve, that we will conform to  
and strictly observe, all such alterations  
or additions, assented to bv the delegates  
tor tins colony, as thev mav&#x27;judge necessa­  
ry to adopt, after thesanie shall be pub­  
lished and made known to us.  
1 lthly. Resolved, that we think ourselves  
called upon by every principle o*&#x27; humanity  
and brotherly affection, to extend the ut­  
most and speediest relief to our distressed  
tellow subjects in the town of Boston ; and  
therefore most e.irnesily recommend it to  
all tiie inhabitants of this colony to make

It&#x27;d very full meeting of DELEGATES  
from the different Counties in ihr Colony  
ami Dominion of Virginia* begun in li&#x27;il­  
lium«hurg the fr*t dan of .iutf/uf, in the  
year of our Lord, 177&#x27;l, and coat in tied by  
nrverai adjournment*, to Saturday the  
b&#x27;/t of the name Month, the following AS­  
S()( IATION tea* unanimouhly resolved  
nfion and agreed to.  
[After some prefatory remarks which  
might have been expected from that /Era,  
but do not suit our’s, the Subscribers pro­  
ceed : ]  
If, by the measures adopted, some unhap­  
py cnn .etjir ores and Incofivedencies should  
bed* lived to our (eiiovr subjects, v.horn we  
•*ish not to injure in the smallest decree, rtc  
hope, and flatter ourselves, that they will im­  
puie them to their real cause ; the hard ite­  
co^dty t-&gt; which we ure driven.  
  
That the pood people of this colony may,  
on so trying an occasion, continue stcdfastly  
directed to their most essential interests, in  
hope that they will be influenced and stimu­  
lated by our example to the greatest indus­  
try, the strictest economy, and frugality, and  
the exertion ol every public virtue, persua  
ded that the merchants, manufacturers, and  
other inhabitants of Great-Britain, and, a­  
bove all, that the British parliament will  
lie convinced how much the true interest  
of that kingdom must depend on the restora­  
tion and continuance of that mutual friend­  
ship and cordiality, which so happily subsis­  
ted between us, we have unanimously, and  
with one voice, ,entered, into the following  
resolutions and association, which wc do o­  
blige ourselves, by those sacred tics of honor  
aixl love to our country, strictly to observe,  
and farther, declare, before God &amp; the World  
that we will religiously adhere to aiid keep  
the same inviolate in every particular, until  
redress of all such jimerican grievances, as  
may be defined and settled at the general  
congress of delegates from the different co­  
lonies, shall he fully obtained, or until this  
association shall be abrogated or altered by  
a general meeting of the deputies of this co­  
lony, to be convened, as is herein after di­  
rected. And we do, with the greatest ear­  
nestness, recommend this, our association, to  
all gentlemen, merchants, traders and other  
inhabitants of this colony, hoping that they  
will chcarfully and cordially accede there­  
to, .. •  
1st. We do hereby resolve and declare that  
wc will not, either directly or indirectly, af­  
ter the 1st day of November next, import  
from Grent-Britain, any goods, wares or  
merchandizes, whatever (medicines excep­  
ted) nor will we, after that day, import any  
British manufactures, either from the IVest­  
Indies, or any other place, nor any article  
whatever, which we shall know, or have rea­  
son to believe, was brought into such coun­  
tries from Great-Britain ; nor will we pur­  
chase any such articles, so imported, of any  
person or persons whatsoever, except such  
as are now in the country, or such as may  
arrive on or before the said 1st day of jYci­  
utttnber,jin consequence of orders already gi­  
ven, and which cannct now be countermanded  
in time. .  
  
2dly. \Vc will neither ourselves import,  
nor purchase any slave or slaves, imported  
by any person after the 1st day of November  
next, either from Africa, the West-Indies,  
or any o&#x27;ther place.  
3dly. Considering the article of Tea as the  
detestable instrument, which laid the founda­  
tion of the present sufferings of our distress­  
ed fi’iends in the town of Boston, we view  
it with horror, and therefore resolve that we  
will not, from this day, either import Tea of  
any kind whatever, nor will we use or suf­  
fer even such of it. as is now on hand to be u­  
sed in any of our families,  
j 4thly. If the inhabitants of the town of Bos­  
ton, or any other colony, should, by violence  
or dire necessity, be compelled to pay the  
Kant-India company for destroying any Tea,  
which they have lately by their agents un­  
justly attempted to force into the colonies, we  
will not, directly or indirectly, import or  
purchase any llritish Rast-India commodi­  
ty whatever, till the company or some other  
person, oil their behalf, shall refund and ful­  
ly restore to the owners all such sum or sums  
of money as may be so extorted.  
. Stilly. We do resolve, that unless Ameri­  
can grievances are redressed before the 10th  
day of August, 1775, we will not, after that  
day, directly or indirectly, export tobacco  
or any other article whatever, to Great-Bri­  
tain ; nor wi«. we sell any such article as  
•we think can be exported to Great-Britain  
with a prospect of gain.toany person ot per­  
sons whatever, with a design of putting it in­  
to his or their power to export the same to  
Great-Britain, either on our owu. his or  
their account . And that this resolution may  
be the more effectually carried into executi­  
on, we do hereby recommend it to the inha­  
bitants of this colony to rfcfrairi. from the cul­  
tivation of tobacco as much as conveniently  
may be, and in lieu thereof, that they, will,  
as we resolve to do, apply their attention and  
industry to the cultivation of all such articles  
as may form a proper basis for manufac •  
tures of all sorts, which we will endeavor to  
encourage throughout this colony to the ut  
most of our abilities.  
6thly. We will endeavor to improve out  
breed of sheep, and encrease their number to  
the utmost extent, and to this end, we will  
l&gt;e assparing as we conveniently can in kil­  
ling of slieep, especially those of the most pro­  
fitable kind ; and if we should at any time be  
overstocked,or can conveniently spare any,  
we will dispose of them to our neighbors, es­  
pecially the poorer sort of people, upon mode­  
rate terms.  
7thly. Resolved, That the merchants and  
other venders of goods and merchandizes  
within this colony, ought not to take advan­  
tage of the scarcity of goods that may be oc­  
casioned by this association, but that they  
ought to sell the same at the rates they have  
been accustomed to for twelve months last  
past, and it they shall sell any such goods on  
higher terms, or shall in any manner, or by  
any device whatever, violate or depart from  
this resolution, we will not, and are of opini­  
on that no inhabitant of this colony ought, at  
any time thereafter, to deal with any such  
persons; their factors, or agents, for any com­  
modity whatever, and it is recommended to  
the deputies of the several counties, that com­  
mittees be chosen in each county by such  
persons as accede to this association to take  
effectual care that these resolves be properly  
observed, and for corresponding occasional­  
ly with the general committee of correspon­  
dence in the city of Williamsburg. Provi­  
ded, that if exchange should rise, such ad­  
vance may be made in the prices of goods  
as shall be approved by tile committee of each  
county.  
  
Stilly. In order the better to distinguish  
such worthy merchants and traders, who arc  
well wishers to this colony, from those who  
may attempt, tlwough motives of self-interest  
to obstruct our views, we do hereby resolve  
that we will not after the first day of Ai,•  
vfm ’trr next, deal with any merchant or  
trader who will not sign this association, nor  
until he hath obtained a certificate of hisha­  
v&#x27;ing done so from the comity committee, or  
any three members thereof. And if any mer­  
chant, trader or other person, shall import  
any goods or merchandise after the said first  
day of A ovembcr, contrary to this associati­  
on. we give it as onr opinion, that such goods  
and merchandize should be either forthwith  
re-shipped or delivered up to the countv  
committee, tube stored at the risk of the im­  
porter, unless such importer shall-give a pro­  
per assurance to the said committee that  
&amp;u&lt; h goods or merchandizes shall not be sold  
within this colony during the continuance of  
this association &gt; and if such importer shall  
refuse to comply with one or th« other of these  
i terms, upon application and due caution gi­  
I ten to hi in or her, by the said committee, ur  
  
any three members thereof, such committee  
is required to publish the truth of tluj case  
in the (iaTfettes,and in the county where he  
or she resides,, and we will thereafter consi­  
der such person, or persons as inimical s,to this  
Country, and break off every connection 6c all  
dealings with them.  
9thly. Resolved, That if any person or  
persons shall export, tobacco, or anv other  
commodity, to Great-Britain, after the 10th  
day of August, 1775, contrary to this associ­  
ation, we shall hold ourselves obliged to con­  
sider such person or persons as inimical to  
the community, and as cna/i/irox’er of Ante­  
rican grievances ; and give it as our opinion  
that the public should be advertised of his  
conduct, us in the 8th Article is desired.  
lOthly. Being fully persuaded that the uni­  
ted wisdom of the general congress may im­  
prove these our .endeavors to preserve the  
rights and liberties in British America, we  
decline enlarging at present, but do hereby  
resolve, that we will conform to, and strictly  
observe, all such alterations or additions, as­  
sented to by the delegates for this colony, as  
they may judge it necessary to udupt( after  
the same shall be published and made known  
Jo us.  
llthly.9Resolved, That we think ourselves  
called^upon, by every principle of humanity  
and brotherly affection, to extend the utmost  
and speediest relief to our distressed fellow  
subjects in the town of Boston, and therefore  
most earnestly recommend it to alt the inha­  
bitants of this colony i© make such liberal con­  
tributions as they can afford; to be collected  
and remitted to liusfon, in such manner as  
may best answer so desirable a purpose.  
l2thly, and lastly. Resolved, That the mo­  
derator &lt;n this meeting, and in case of his  
death, Robert Carter Nicholas, Esq. be em­  
powered, on any future occasion, that may in  
his opinion require it, to convene.the several  
Delegates of this Colony, at such time aucl  
place as he may judge proper ; and, iii case  
of the death or absence.of any delegate, it is  
recommended that another be chosen in his  
place
