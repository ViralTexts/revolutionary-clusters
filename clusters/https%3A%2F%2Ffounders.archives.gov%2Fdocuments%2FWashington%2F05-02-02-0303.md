Sir,  
New York May 31st 1789  
  
The new and busy scenes in which I have been constantly engaged since my arrival in this place, and which will not allow me to pay that pointed attention to the favors of my friends that my inclination would lead me to do, will, I trust apologize for this late acknowledgment of your letter of the 15th instant.  
To you, Sir, and others who know me, I believe it is unnecessary for me to say, that when I accepted of the important trust committed to my charge by my Country, I gave up every idea of personal gratification that I did not think was compatable with the public good. Under this impression I plainly foresaw that that part of my duty which obliged me to nominate persons to offices, would, in many instances, be the most irksome and unpleasing; for however strong my personal attachment might be to any one—however desirous I might be of giving a proof of my friendship—and whatever might be his expectations, grounded upon the amity which had subsisted between us, I was fully determined to keep myself free from every engagement that could embarrass me in discharging this part of my administration. I have therefore, uniformly declined giving any decisive answer to the numerous applications which have been made to me; being resolved, whenever I am called upon to nominate persons for those offices which may be created, that I will do it with a sole view to the public good—and shall bring forward those who, upon every consideration, and from the best information I can obtain, will in my judgment be most likely to answer that great end.  
The delicacy with which your letter was written, and your wishes insinuated, did not require me to be thus explicit on this head with you; but the desire which I have that those persons whose good opinion I value shd know the principles on which I mean to act in this business has led me to this full declaration; and I trust, that the truly worthy and respectable characters in this Country will do justice to the motives by which I am actuated in all my public transactions.

those just political views and noble sentiments,  
by which its author was through life distinguish­  
ed:  
“To you, sir, and others who know me, I be- j  
lieve it is unnecessary for me to say, that when  
1 accepted the important trust committed to my j  
charge by my country, I gave up every idea of,  
personal gratification that l did not think was  
compatible with public good. Under this im­  
pression, I plainly foresaw, that that part of my  
Silty which obliged me to nominate persons to  
jtfices, would, in many instances, be the most  
irksome and unpleasing; for, however strong  
my personal attachment might be to any one,  
  
however desirous i migni oe oi giving nim a  
;iroof of my friendship, and whatever might be  
his expectations, grounded upon the amity  
which had subsisted between us, I was fully de­  
termined to keep myself free from every en­  
gagement that could embarrass me in dis­  
charging this part of my administration.—  
1 have, therefore, uniformly declined giving any  
decisive answer to the numerous applications  
which have been made to me, being resolved,  
that whenever I shall, be called upon to nomi­  
nate persons for those offices which may be  
created, I will do it with a sole view to the pub­  
lic good, and will bring forward those who, up­  
on every consideration, and from the best in­  
formation l can obtain, will, in my judgment,  
be most likely to answer that great end.
