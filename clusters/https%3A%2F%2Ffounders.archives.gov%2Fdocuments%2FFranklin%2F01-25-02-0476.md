HE Moſt Chriſtian King, and the United States of North-  
  
America, to wit, Neu. Ii ire, Maſſachuſetts- bay, Rhode  
Iſland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Dela-  
ware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and  
Georgia, having this day concluded a Treaty of Amity and Com-  
merce, for the reciprocal advantage of their ſubjects and citizens,  
have thought it neceſſary to take into conſideration the means of  
ſtrengthening thoſe engagements, and of rendering them uſeful to the  
ſafety and tranquillity of the two parties; particularly in caſe Great  
Britain, in reſentment of that connexion, and of the good correſ-  
pondence which is the object of the faid treaty, ſhould break the  
peace with France, either by direct hoſtilities, or by hindering her  
commerce and navigation in a manner contrary to the rights of na-  
tions, and the peace ſubſiſting between the two crowns. And his  
Majeſty and the faid United States, having reſolved in that caſe, to  
join their councils and efforts againſt the enterpriſes of their common  
enemy—  
  
The reſpective Plenipotentiaries, empowered to concert the clauſes  
and conditions proper to fulfil the ſaid intentions, have, after the moſt  
mature deliberation, concluded and determined on the following ar-  
ticles. | |  
  
I. If war ſhould break out between France and Great Britain,  
during the continuance of the preſent war between the United States  
and England, his Majeſty and the ſaid United States ſhall make it a  
common cauſe, and aid each other mutually with their good offices,  
their counſels, and their forces, according to the exigence of conjunc-  
tures, as becomes good and faithful allies.  
  
II. The eſſential and direct end of the preſent defenſive alliance  
is, to maintain effectually the liberty, ſovereignty, and ind ence,  
abſolute and unlimited, of the faid United States, as well in mat-  
ters of government, as of commerce.  
  
III. two contracting parties ſhall, each on its _—_ and  
in the manner it may judge moſt proper, make all the efforts in its  
wow againſt their common enemy, 1n order to attain the end pro-  
  
IV. The contracting parties agree, that in caſe either of them  
ſhould form any particular enterpriſe, in which the concurrence of  
  
  
the other may be deſired, 28 whoſe concurrence is deſired,  
ſhall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that pur-  
poſe, as far as circumſtances and its own particular ſituation will per-  
mit. And in that caſe, they ſhall regelate by a particular conven-  
tion, the quantity and kind of ſuccour to be furniſhed, and the time  
and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advanta-  
which are to be its compenſation. f  
V. If the United States ſhould think fit to attempt the reduction  
of the Britiſh power, remaining in the northern parts of America, or  
the iflands of Bermudas, thots countries or iſlands, in caſe of ſucceſs,  
ſhall be confederated with, or dependent upon the ſaid United  
States. a  
VI. The Moſt Chriſtian King renounces forever, the poſſeſſion *  
of the iſlands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent  
of North America, which before the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, or  
in virtue of that Treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown  
of Great Britain, or to the United States, heretofore called Britih  
colonies, or which are at this time, or have lately been under the  
power of the king and crown of Great Britain, |  
VII. If his Mott Chriſtian Majeſty ſhall think proper to attack  
any of the iſlands fituated in the gulph of Mexico, or near that ,  
which are at nt under the power of Great Britain, all the fai  
iſles, in cafe of ſucceſs, ſhall appertain to the crown of France.  
VIII. Neither of the two parties ſhall conclude either truce or  
peace with Great Britain, without the formal conſent of the other  
firſt obtained: and they mutually engage not to lay down their arms,  
until the independence of the United States ſhall have been formally  
or tacitly aſſured, by the treaty or treatics that ſhall terminate tbe  
  
war.  
  
IX The 2 parties declare, that being reſolved to fulfil  
each on its own part, the clauſes and conditions of the preſent Treaty  
of Alliance, according to its own power and circumſtances, there  
ſhall be no after-claim of compenſation, on one ſide or the other,  
whatever may be the event of the war.  
  
X. The Moll Chriſtian King and the United States, agree to in-  
vite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from  
— * to make a common cauſe with them, and to accede to the  
preſent alliance, under ſuch conditions as ſhall be freely agreed to,  
and ſettled between all the parties.  
  
XI. The two parties guarantee mutually from the preſent time  
and for ever, againſt all other powers, to wit, the United States  
to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, the preſent poſſeſſions of the crown of  
France in America, as well as chole which it may acquire by the fu-  
ture Treaty of Peace: and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty guarantees on  
his part to the United States, their liberty, ſovereignty, and indepen-  
dence, abſolute and unlimited, as well in matters of government, as  
commerce and alſo their poſſeſſions, and the additions or conqueſts

Nous avons quelque regret de ce parti que M. de Clercq a cru devoir prendre; il nous semble surtout que le texte du traité d&#x27;al liance éventuelle et défensive manquera dans le Recueil des traités de la France. La résolution dont ce, traité fut. la conséquence était certainement grande, glorieuse et utile, et son influence dure et durera longtemps. Les articles 2 et 5 I de ce traité sont ainsi conçus : « Le but » essentiel et direct de la présente alliance » défensive est de maintenir efficacement la » liberté, la souveraineté et l&#x27;indépendance » absolue et illimité des Etats-Unis, tant en » matière de gouvernement que de com » meree, Les deux parties contractantes » feront chacune de sa part, et de la manière » qu&#x27;elles jugeront le plus convenable, tous » les efforts en leur pouvoir contre leur en » nemi commun, à l&#x27;effet de remplir le bu) » proposé. » L&#x27;ennemi commun c&#x27;était l&#x27;An gleterre, contre qui la nouvelle république avait peine à se défendre. Le traité du 6 février assura le triomphe de l&#x27;Union&quot; américaine ; les fils des hommes illus tres qui déclarèrent leur indépendance le 4 juillet 1776 ne l&#x27;ont pas oublié et ne l&#x27;ou blieront pas. Go traité forme toujours un lien de fraternité et de reconnaissance en- Ire les deux nations ; il n&#x27;a pas cessé d&#x27;être le fondement des bons rapports qui ont toujours subsisté entre elles, et la France aurait au besoin le droit de s&#x27;en prévaloir.
