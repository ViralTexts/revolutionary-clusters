n Leave. As we have no metaphysical Tutor, here at present, we supposed, that, for the ensuing fortnight we should have no reciting. But the government have determined that we should continue to attend Mr. Reed in S’Gravesande’s. This is not an agreeable Circumstance; a Person who does not belong to the University, and hears only the word reciting, naturally concludes, that the Scholars are an idle set of fellows, because they are always averse to recitations. Now the Fact is just the Contrary. A Person fond of study, regards the Time spent in reciting as absolutely lost. He has studied the Book before he recites, and the Tutors here, are so averse to giving ideas different from those of the author, whom they are supposed to explain, that they always speak in his own words, and never pretend to add any thing of their own: Reciting is indeed of some Service to idle fellows; because it brings the matter immediately before them, and obliges them, at least for a short Time, to attend to something. But a hard Student will always dislike it, because it takes time from him, which he supposes might have been employ’d to greater advantage.

“ September 4, 1786. As we have no metaphysical tutor here at  
present, we supposed that for the ensuing fortnight we should have no  
reciting. But the government have determined that we shall continue  
to attend Mr. R . This is not an agreeable circumstance. A person  
who does not belong to the University and hears only the word reeiting,  
naturally concludes that the scholars are an idle set of fellows, because  
they are always averse to recitations. Now the fact is just the con-  
trary. A person fond of study regards the time spent in reciting as  
absolutely lost. He has studied the book before he recites; and the  
tutors here are so averse to giving ideas different from those of the  
author whom they are supposed to explain, that they always speak in  
his own words and never pretend to add anything of their own. Re-  
citing is indeed of some service to idle fellows, because it brings the  
matter immediately before them and obliges them at least for a short  
time to attend to something. But a hard student will always dislike it,  
because it takes time from him which he supposes might have been em-  
ployed to greater advantage.”
