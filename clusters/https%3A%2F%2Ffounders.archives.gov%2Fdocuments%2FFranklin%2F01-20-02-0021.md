bjoined one experiment from the relation of another Gentleman.  
Extract of a Letter from the Revd. Mr. Farish, to Dr. Brownrigg  
I sometime ago met with Mr. Dun, who surprised me with an account of an experiment you had tried upon the Derwentwater, in Company with Sir J. Pringle and Dr. Franklin. According to his representation, the water, which had been in great agitation before, was instantly calmed, upon pouring in only a very small quantity of oil, and that to so great a distance round the boat as seems a little incredible. I have since had the same accounts from others, but I suspect them all of a little exaggeration. Pliny mentions this property of oil as known particularly to the Divers, who made use of it in his days, in order to have a more steady light at the bottom.  
* Dr. Brownrigg’s Note to Mr. Farish’s Observations.  
The sailors, I have been told, have observed something of the same kind in our days, that the water is always remarkably smoother in the wake of a ship that had been newly tallowed, than it is in one that is foul. Mr. Pennant also mentions an observation of the like nature made by the Seal Catchers in Scotland: Brit. Zool. Vol. IV. Article Seal. When these Animals are devouring a very oily fish, which they always do under water, the waves above are observed to be remarkably smooth, and by this mark the fishermen know where to look for them. Old Pliny does not usually meet with all the credit I am inclined to think he deserves. I shall be glad to have an authentic account of the Keswick Experiment, and if it comes up to the representations that have been made of it, I shall not much hesitate to believe the old Gentleman in another more wonderful Phenomenon he relates of stilling a Tempest only by throwing up a little Vinegar into the Air.  
Sir Gilfred Lawson who served long in the army, at Gibraltar, assures me that the Fishermen in that place are accustomed to pour a little oil on the sea in order to still its motion that they may be enabled to see the Oysters lying at its bottom; which are there very large, and which they take up with a proper instrument. This Sir Gilfred had often seen there performed, and said the same was practised on other parts of the Spanish Coast

“On the effect of oil in stilling waves.” This article is con

Gilfred Lawson, ‘ who served in the British army at the  
defense of Gibraltar. He relates that the fishermen of  
Gibraltar were accustomed to pour a little oil on the sea, in  
order to still its motions, that they might be enabled to see

justice to the subject, thun to reproduce them  
before she society bearing his honored name.  
  
Extract of a letter trom the Rev. Mr. Farish  
to Dr. Brownrigg:  
  
I sometime ago met with Dr. Dun, who sur-  
prised me with an account of an experiment  
you had tried upon the Derwent water, in com-  
pany with Sir John Prindle and Dr. Franklin.  
According to his represcutations, the water,  
which had boen in great azitation before, was  
instantly calmed upon pouring in only a very  
small quantity of oil, and that to so great a dis-  
tance round the boet as seemed incredible.  
  
I have since had the samo accounts from  
others, but I suspect all of a little exaggera-  
tion.  
  
Pliny mentions this property of oil as known  
particuiarly to the divers, who made use of itin  
his days, in order to have a more steady light at  
the bottom.  
  
The sailors, I have been told, have observed  
something of the same kind in our days that  
the water is always remarkably smoother in  
the wake of a ship that has been newly tallowed  
than it is in one that is foul.  
  
Mr. Pennant also mentions an observation of  
the like nature made by the seal catchers in  
Scotland. When these animals are devouring  
a very oily fish, which they always do under  
water, the waves above are observed to be re~  
markably smooth, and by this mark the fisher-  
men know where to look for them.  
  
Old Pliny does not usually meet with all the  
eredit Iam inclined to think he deserves. I  
shall be glad to have an authentic account of  
the Keswick experiment, and, if it comes up to  
the representations that have been made of it,  
Ishall not much hesitate to believe the old  
gentleman in another more wonderful phenom-  
enon he relates, of stilling a tempest only by  
tbrowing up a iittle vinegar into the air.
