 extremely interesting to many Suits in the Circuit Courts, took place in the Supreme Court in the Term in August last. It was, that a Writ of Error to remove any Proceeding out of a Circuit Court to the Supreme Court must be taken out of the Clerk’s office of the latter. By the Act of Congress that alone concerns that subject a Writ of Error can only operate as a Supersedeas, and stay execution in cases where a Copy of it is lodged for the adverse Party in the Clerk’s office where the record remains within ten days after the Judgment complained of is given. The above decision therefore made it appear, that after a Judgment was given against a Defendant in a Circuit Court, if the Circuit Court was at such a distance from the Clerk’s office of the Supreme Court that it was impracticable to obtain a Writ of Error from that office, and serve a copy as directed by the Act  
  
within the time limit

the writ of error is served by a copy thereof being lodged for

sec. 11, supra, it was still necessary to serve a copy of the  
writ of error within fez days from the rendition of the judg-

ad section of the act of 1803, (placing appeals upon the foot-
