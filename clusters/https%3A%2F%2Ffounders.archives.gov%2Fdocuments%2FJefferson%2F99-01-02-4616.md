To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled.—  
It would have given me, fellow Citizens, great satisfaction to announce, in the moment of your meeting, that the diﬃculties in our foreign relations, existing at the time of your last separation, had been amicably &amp; justly terminated. I lost no time in taking those measures which were most likely to bring them to such a termination, by Special Missions, charged with such powers and instructions as, in the event of failure, could leave no imputation on either our moderation or forbearance. The delays which have since taken place in our negociations with the British Government, appear to have proceeded from causes which do not forbid the expectation that, during the course of the Session, I may be enabled to lay before you their ﬁnal issue. What will be that of the negociations for settling our diﬀerences with Spain, nothing which had taken place, at the date of the last dispatches, enables us to pronounce.—On the Western side of the Missisipi, she advanced in considerable force, &amp; took post at the settlement of Bayou Pierre, on the Red River. This Village was originally settled by France, was held by her as long as she held Louisiana, &amp; was delivered to Spain only as a part of Louisiana. Being small, insulated, &amp; distant, it was not observed, at the moment of redelivery to France &amp; the United States, that she continued a guard of half a dozen men, which had been stationed there. A proposition however having been lately made, by our Commander in Chief, to assume the Sabine River as a temporary line of separation, between the troops of the two Nations, until the issue of our negociations shall be known, this has been referred by the Spanish Commandant, to his superior, and in the mean time he has withdrawn his force to the western side of the Sabine river. The correspondence on this subject, now communicated, will exhibit more particularly the present state of things in that quarter.   
The nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual proportion of the force employed there should be cavalry, or mounted infantry. In order therefore that the commanding Oﬃcer might be enabled to act with eﬀect, I had authorised him to call on the Governors of Orleans &amp; Missisipi, for a corps of ﬁve hundred Volunteer Cavalry. The temporary arrangement he has proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary. But I inform you with great pleasure, of the promptitude with which the Inhabitants of those territories have tendered their services in defence of their Country. It has done honour to themselves, entitled them to the conﬁdence of their fellow Citizens in every part of the Union, &amp; must strengthen the general determination to protect them eﬃcaciously under all circumstances which may occur.   
Having recieved information that in another part of the United States a great number of private individuals were combining together, arming and organising themselves, contrary to law, to carry on a military expedition against the territories of Spain, I thought it necessary, by proclamation, as well as by special orders, to take measures for preventing &amp; suppressing this enterprize, for siezing the Vessels, arms and other means provided for it, &amp; for arresting, &amp; bringing to justice it’s authors &amp; abettors. It was due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of Action in public, as well as in private transactions, it was due to good order, &amp; regular government, that, while the public force was acting strictly on the defensive, and merely to protect our citizens from Aggression, the criminal attempts of private individuals to decide, for their country, the question of Peace or War, by commencing active, &amp; unauthorised hostilities, should be promptly &amp; eﬃcaciously suppressed.  
Whether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force, will depend on the result of our negociations with Spain: But as it is uncertain when that result will be known, the provisional measures requisite for that, &amp; to meet any pressure intervening in that quarter, will be a subject for your early consideration  
The possession of both banks of the Missisipi reducing to a single point the defence of that river, it’s waters, &amp; the country adjacent; it becomes highly necessary to provide, for that point, a more adequate security. Some position above it’s mouth, commanding the passage of the river, should be rendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed Vessels which may be stationed there for defence; And, in conjunction with them, to present an insuperable obstacle to any force: attempting to pass. The approaches to the City of New Orleans, from the eastern quarter also, will require to be examined, &amp; more effectually guarded. For the internal support of the country, the encouragement of a strong settlement on the Western side of the Missisipi within reach of New Orleans will be worthy the consideration of the Legislature—  
The Gun-boats, authorised by an act of the last session, are so advanced that they will be ready for service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances permitted us to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction. As a much larger number will still be wanting to place our sea-port towns &amp; waters in that state of defence to which we are competent, &amp; they entitled, a similar appropriation for a further provision of them is recommended for the ensuing year.  
A further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortiﬁcations already established, &amp; the erection of such other works as may have real eﬀect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our Sea-port towns, or their remaining before them.  
In a Country whose Constitution is derived from the will of the People, directly expressed by their free suﬀrages, where the principal Executive functionaries, &amp; those of the Legislature, are renewed by them at short periods, where, under the character of jurors, they exercise in person the greatest portion of the judiciary powers, where the laws are consequently so formed &amp; administered as to bear with equal weight &amp; favor on all, restraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry, &amp; securing to every one the property which that acquires, it would not be supposed that any safeguards could be needed against insurrection, or enterprize, on the public peace or authority—The laws however, aware that these should not be trusted to moral restraints only, have wisely provided punishment for these crimes when committed—But would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission?—Where an enterprize is meditated, by private Individuals, against a foreign nation, in amity with the United States, powers of prevention, to a certain extent, are given by the laws. Would they not be as reasonable, &amp; useful, where the enterprize preparing is against the United States?—While adverting to this branch of Law it is proper to observe that in enterprizes meditated against foreign Nations, the ordinary process of binding to the Observance of the peace &amp; good behaviour, could it be extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction of the United States, would be eﬀectual in some cases where the Oﬀender is able to keep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could draw on him the exercise of the powers now given by law.  
The States on the Coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to respect our peace &amp; friendship. With Tunis alone, some uncertainty remains. Persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them on equal terms, or not at all, I propose to send, in due time, a reinforcement into the Mediterranean; unless previous information shall shew it to be unnecessary.—  
We continue to recieve proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian Neighbors, &amp; of their disposition to place all their interests under the patronage of the United States. These dispositions are inspired by their conﬁdence in our justice, &amp; in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare. And as long as we discharge these high &amp; honorable functions with the integrity &amp; good faith, which alone can entitle us to their continuance, we may expect to reap the just reward in their peace &amp; friendship—  
The expedition of Messrs. Lewis &amp; Clarke, for exploring the river Missouri, &amp; the best communication from that to the Paciﬁc Ocean, has had all the success which could have been expected. They have traced the Missouri nearly to it’s Source, descended the Columbia to the Paciﬁc Ocean, ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication across our continent, learnt the Character of the Country, of it’s commerce &amp; Inhabitants, &amp; it is but justice to say that Messrs. Lewis &amp; Clarke, &amp; their brave Companions, have, by this arduous service, deserved well of their Country.   
  
The attempt to explore the Red river, under the direction of Mr. Freeman, though conducted with a zeal &amp; prudence meriting entire approbation, has not been equally succesful. After proceeding up it about six hundred miles, nearly as far as the French settlements had extended, while the Country was in their possession, our geographers were obliged to return without compleating their work.   
  
Very useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the Missisipi, by Lieutt. Pike, who has ascended it to it’s source, and whose journal &amp; map, giving the details of his journey, will shortly be ready for communication to both Houses of Congress. Those of Messrs. Lewis, Clarke &amp; Freeman will require further time to be digested &amp; prepared. These important surveys, in addition to those before possessed, furnish materials for commencing an accurate Map of the Missisipi &amp; it’s western waters. Some principal Rivers however remain still to be explored, towards which the Authorisation of Congress, by moderate Appropriations, will be requisite.  
  
I congratulate you, fellow Citizens, on the approach of the period at which you may interpose your authority Constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights, which have been so long continued on the unoﬀending Inhabitants of Africa, &amp; which the morality, the reputation, &amp; the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you may pass can take prohibitory eﬀect till the ﬁrst day of the year one thousand eight hundred &amp; eight, yet the intervening period is not too long to prevent, by timely notice, expeditions which cannot be compleated before that day.  
The reciepts at the treasury, during the year ending on the 30th. day of September last, have amounted to near ﬁfteen Millions of dollars; which have enabled us, after meeting the current demands, to pay two millions seven hundred thousand Dollars of the American claims, in part of the price of Louisiana; to pay, of the funded debt, upwards of three Millions of principal, &amp; nearly four of interest; and, in addition, to reimburse, in the course of the present month, near two millions of ﬁve &amp; an half per cent stock. These payments &amp; reimbursements of the funded debt, with those which had been made in the four years &amp; an half preceding, will, at the close of the present year, have extinguished upwards of twenty three millions of principal.   
]  
The duties composing the Mediterranean fund, will cease, by law, at the end of the present session. Considering however that they are levied chieﬂy on luxuries, &amp; that we have an impost on salt, a necessary of life, the free use of which otherwise is so important, I recommend to your consideration the suppression of the duties on Salt, &amp; the continuation of the Mediterranean fund, instead thereof, for a short time, after which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation.  
When both of these branches of revenue shall, in this way, be relinquished, there will still, ere long, be an accumulation of monies in the treasury, beyond the instalments of public debt which we are permitted by contract to pay.— They cannot then, without a modiﬁcation, assented to by the public creditors, be applied to the extinguishment of this debt &amp; the compleat liberation of our revenues, the most desirable of all objects: Nor, if our peace continues, will they be wanting for any other existing purpose. The question therefore now comes forward, to what other objects shall these surplusses be appropriated, &amp; the whole surplus of impost, after the entire discharge of the public debt, &amp; during those intervals when the purposes of War shall not call for them?—Shall we suppress the impost, &amp; give that advantage to foreign over domestic Manufactures?—On a few articles of more general &amp; necessary use, the suppression, in due season, will doubtless be right, but the great mass of the articles on which impost is paid, are foreign luxuries purchased by those only who are rich enough to aﬀord themselves the use of them. Their patriotism would certainly prefer it’s continuance, and application to the great purposes of the public education, roads, rivers, canals, &amp; such other objects of public improvement, as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers. By these operations, new channels of communication will be opened between the States; the lines of separation will disappear; their interests will be identiﬁed, and their union cemented by new &amp; indissoluble ties. Education is here placed among the articles of public care; not that it would be proposed to take it’s ordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprize, which manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal; but a public institution can alone supply those sciences, which, tho’ rarely called for, are yet necessary to compleat the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the country, &amp; some of them to it’s preservation. The subject is now proposed for the consideration of Congress, because, if approved, by the time the state Legislatures shall have deliberated on this extension of the federal trusts, &amp; the laws shall be passed, &amp; other arrangements made for their execution, the necessary funds will be on hand, &amp; without emploiment. I suppose an amendment of the constitution, by consent of the States, necessary; because, the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated in the Constitution, &amp; to which it permits the public monies to be applied—  
The present consideration of a national establishment for education particularly, is rendered proper by this circumstance also, that, if Congress, approving the proposition, shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of lands, they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary income. This foundation would have the advantage of being independant on War, which may suspend other improvements, by requiring for it’s own purposes, the resources destined for them—.  
This, fellow citizens, is the state of the public interests, at the present moment, and according to the information now possessed. But such is the situation of the nations of Europe, &amp; such too the predicament in which we stand with some of them, that we cannot rely with certainty on the present aspect of our aﬀairs that may change from moment to moment, during the course of your session, or after you shall have separated. Our duty is therefore to act upon things as they are, &amp; to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be. Were armies to be raised whenever a speck of War is visible in our horizon, we never should have been without them. Our resources would have been exhausted on dangers which have never happened, instead of being reserved for what is really to take place. A steady, perhaps a quickened pace, in preparations for the defence of our Sea-port towns &amp; waters, an early settlement of the most exposed &amp; vulnerable parts of our country, a militia so organised that it’s eﬀective portions can be called to any point in the Union, or Volunteers, instead of them, to serve a suﬃcient time, are means which may always be ready, yet never preying on our resources untill actually called into use. They will maintain the public interests, while a more permanent force shall be in a course of preparation— But much will depend on the promptitude with which these means can be brought into activity. If war be forced upon us, in spite of our long &amp; vain appeals to the justice of Nations, rapid &amp; vigorous movements, in it’s outset, will go far towards securing us in it’s course &amp; issue, &amp; towards throwing it’s burthens on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force.—  
The result of our negociations, or such incidents in their course as may enable us to infer their probable issue, such further movements also, on our western frontier as may shew whether war is to be pressed there, while negociation is protracted elsewhere, shall be communicated to you from time to time, as they become known to me; with whatever other information I possess or may recieve, which may aid your deliberations on the great National interests committed to your charge.

ahe continued a guard of half a dozen men, which had been stationed there.  
A proposition, however, having been lately made by our commander in chief,  
to assume the Sabine river as a temporary line of separation between the  
troops of the two nations, until the issue of our negociations shall be known  
this has been referred by the Spanish commandant to his superiour, and in the  
mean time he has withdrawn his force to the western side of the Sabine  
river. The correspondence on this subject, now communicated, will ex-  
hibit more particularly the present state of things in that quarter.  
  
The nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual propor-  
tion of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted infantry. In  
order therefore that the commanding officer might be enabled to act with  
effect, I had authorized him to call on the governours of Orleans and Missis-  
sippi for a corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry. The temporary arrange-_  
menthe has proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary. But I inform  
you, with great pleasure, of the promptitude with which the inhabitants of  
those territories have tendered their services in defence of their co .  
It has done honour to themselves, entitled them to the confidence of their  
fellow citizens in every part of the Union, and must strengthen the general.  
determination to protect them efiicaciously under all circumstances which  
may oecur.  
  
Having received information that in another part of the United States a-  
great number of private individuals were combining together, arming and  
organizing themselves, contrary to law, to carry ona military expedition’  
against the territories of Spain, I thought it necessary, by preclamation, as  
well as by special orders, to take measures for preventing and suppressing  
this enterprize, for seizing the vessels, arms, and other means provided for  
it, and for arresting and bringing to justice its authors and abettors. It  
was due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of action in  
publick as wellas in private transactions ; it was due to good order, and re-  
gular government, that, while the publick force was acting strictly on the  
defensive, and merely to protect our citizens from aggression, the criminal  
wttempts of private individuals to decide, for their country, the question of  
peace or war, by commencing active and unauthorized hostilities, should be  
promptly and efficaciously suppressed.  
  
&#x27; Whether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force, will depend on  
the result of our negociations with Spain. But as it is uncertain when that  
result will be known, the provisional measures requisite for that, and to  
meet any pressure intervening in that quarter, will be a subject for your  
early consideration.  
  
The possession of both banks of the Mississippi reducing to a single point  
the defence of that river, its water, and the country adjacent, it becomes  
highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security. Some  
position above its mouth, commanding the passage of the river, should be  
rendered sufficiently strong tocover the armed vessels, which may be sta-  
tioned there for defence ; and, in conjunction with them to present an insu-  
perable obstacle to any force, attempting to pass. The approaches to the  
city of New-Orleans, from the eastern quarter also will require to be ex-  
amined, and more effectually guarded. For the internal support of the  
country, the encouragement of a strong settlement on the western side of  
the Mississippi, within the reach of New-Orleans, will be worthy the consi-  
deration of the legislature.  
  
The gun-boats authorized by an act of the last session, are so advanced,  
that they will be ready for service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances  
permitted us to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction.

titled, a similar appropriation for a further provision of them isrecommend.-  
ed for the ensuing year.  
  
_ A further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications  
already established, and the erection of such other works as may have reak  
eftect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to vur sea-port towns, or  
their remaining before them.  
  
In acouniry whose constitution is derived from the will of the people, di-  
rectly expressed by their free suftrages ; where the principal executive  
functionaries, and those of the legislature, are renewed by them at short  
periods ; where, under the characters of jurors, they exercise in person the  
att portion of the judiciary powers; where the laws are consequently se  
  
ormed and administered as so bear with equal weight and favour on all,  
restraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry, and securing to every  
one the property which that acquires, it would not be supposed that any  
safeguards could be needed against insurrection, or enterprize, on the pub-  
lick peace or authority. The laws, however, aware that these should not  
be trusted to moral restraints only, have wisely provided punishment for  
these crimes when committed. But would it not be salutary to give also  
the means of preventing their commission ? Where an enterprize is medi-  
tated by private individuals, against a foreign nation, in amity with the Uni-  
ied States, powers of prevention, to’a certain extent, are given by the laws.  
Would they not be as reasonable, and useful, where the enterprize prepar-  
ing is against the United States While adverting to this branch of law, it  
is proper to observe, that, in enterprizes meditated against foreign nations,  
the ordinary process of binding to the observance of the peace and good be.  
haviour, could it be extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction of the  
United States, would be eficctual in some cases where the offender is able  
to keep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could draw on  
him the exercise of the powers now given by law.  
  
The states on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to  
respect our peace and friendship. With Tunis alone, some uncertainty re-  
mains. Persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them on  
equal terms, or not at all, I propose to send in due time a reinforcement inte  
the Mediterrancan,unless previous information shall shew it to be unnecessary.  
  
We continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian  
neighbours, and of their disposition to place all their interests under the patron-  
age of the United States. These dispositions are inspired by their confidence  
in our justice and in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare. And as  
long as we discharge these high and honourable functions with the integrity  
and good faith which alone can entitle us to their continuance, we may ex-  
pect to reap the just reward in their peace and friendship.  
  
The expedition of Messrs. Lewis, and Clarke, for exploring the river  
Missouri, and the best communication from that to the Pacifick Ocean, has  
had all the success which could have been expected. They have traced the  
Missouri nearly to its source, descended the Columbia to the Pacifick  
Ocean, ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting commu-  
nication across our centinent, learnt the character of the country, of its  
commerce and inhabitants, and it is but justice to say that Messrs. Lewis  
and Clarke, and their brave companions, have, by this arduous service, de-  
  
served well of their country.  
  
The attempt to explore the Red River, under the direction of Mr. Free-  
man, though conducted&#x27;with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approba-  
tion, has not been equally successful. After proceeding up about six hund-  
red miles nearly as far as the French settlements had extended, while the  
country was in their possession, our geographers were obliged to returs  
  
without completing their work.

Very useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the Mis-  
sissippi, by Lieutenant Pike, who has ascended it to its source, and whose  
journal and map, giving the details of his journey, will shortly be ready for  
‘communication to both houses of congress. Those of Messrs. Lewis,  
Clarke and Freeman, will require further tinge to be digested and prepared.  
These important surveys, in addition to those before possessed, furnish ma-  
terials for commencing an accurate map of the Mississippi and its western  
waters. Some principal rivers however remain still to be explored, towards  
which the authorisation of congress, by moderate appropriations, will be  
requisite. ; ,  
  
I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the period at which  
you May interpose your authority constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of  
the United States from all further participation in those violations of human  
rights, which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of  
Africa, and which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of  
our country, have long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you may  
pass can take prohibitory eflect till the first day of the year one-thousand  
eight hundred and eight, yet the intervening period is not too long to prevent,  
by timely notice, expeditions, which cannot be completed before that day.  
  
The receipts at the treasury, during the year ending on the 30th day of  
Sept. last, have amounted+to near fifteen millions of dollars: which have en-  
abled us, after meeting the current demands, to pay two millions seven  
hundred thousand dollars of the American claims, in part of the price of  
Louisiana ; to pay, of the funded debt, upwards of three millions of prin-  
cipal, and nearly four of interest, and in addition to reimburse, in the course  
of the present month, near two millions of five anda half per cent. stock.

issue, and towards throwing its burthens on those who render necessary the  
resort from reason to force.  
  
The result of ovr negociations, or such incidents in their course as may  
enable us to infer their bable issue ; such further movements also, on  
  
our western frontiers as may shew whether war is to be pressed there, while  
negociation is protracted elsewhere, shall be communicated to you from  
time to time, as they become known to me ; with whatever other informa  
tion I possess or may receive, which may aid your deliberations on the great  
VH. JEFFERSON,  
  
Rational interests committed to your charge.

To the Senate etna&#x27; House of Representatives of the United  
States of America in Congress assembled.  
IT would have given me, fellow Citizens,  
great satisfaction to announce, in the moment of  
5 our meeting, that the cii_iicult.es in our foreign  
relations, existing at the time of your last sep_&lt;­  
rr.tion, had been amicably and justly terminated.  
I lost no time in tailing those measures which  
were most likely to bnng them to such a termina­  
tion, by special mission&#x27;s, charged with such pow­  
ers and instructions as, in the event of failure,  
could leave no imputation on either cur modera­  
tion or forbearance. Tiie delays, which have shleC:  
taken place in cur negotiations .vi;h the British  
Covcrnmci.t, appear to have proceeded from ca&#x27;ti­  
•..._&gt; which do riot forbid thj -.ution that, dur­  
[ may be enabled to  
hiyi. foil their final issue. What will be  
that of l sertfciinjj ovr differen­  
ces with _5j hich had taken place, at  
t lie date ofthe Ij e», enables us to pro­  
&#x27;nqunce- On the western side of tiie Mississippi  
she advanced, in lerable force, rjtd took post  
tyou Pierre, ou the Red ri­  
ver. This village was c, tied by  
France, was h. r as long as she held Loui­  
siana, and was delivere 1 to Spain only as a part of  
Louisiana.&#x27; .Being small, insulated, and distant, it  
|iyas not observed at the moment of re-dchvery to  
France and the United States, that she continued a  
guard of h:; :w men, which had been eta­  
d there. A proposition however having  
Lee... lately Brade by our commander in chief, to 33­  
--ounie the Sabine river as a temporary line of sepa­  
ration between the troops of tiie two nations, until  
the issue of our negociations shall be known, this  
has been referred by the Spanish commandant to  
his superior, and in the mean time he has frith­  
drawn Ids force to the western side of the Sabine  
river. The correspondence on this eubjeet, now  
Communicated, will exhibit more particularly the  
present state oi things in that quarter.  
The nature of that country requires indispensa­  
bly tlw. an lymsual proportion ofthe force employ­  
ed there should be cavalry, or mounted infantry.  
In cider therefore that the commanding officer  
might be enabled to act with effect, I had autho­  
ri.s_.ii him to call on the Governors oi Orleans and  
.Mississippi, for a corps of five hundred volunteer  
cavalry. Tiie temporary arrangement he has pro­  
posed may perhaps render this unnecessary. But  
I inform you with great pleasure, of the prompti­  
tude with which the inhabitants of those territories  
.navi- tendered their services in defence of their  
€0....!_y_ It has df ne honour to themselves, enti­  
tled them to the contidence of their fellow citizens  
io every part of the Union, and must strengthen  
tiie ;ce:u-ral determination to protect them eflica­  
icioii__.y under all circumstances which may occur.  
Having received information that in another  
irt ofthe United State*, a great number of private  
individuals were combining together, arming and  
Organising themselves, contrary to law, to carry on  
a military expedition against the territories of  
Spain&#x27;, I thought it necessary, by proclamation, as  
well as by special orders, to take measures for pre­  
venting ai d suppressing this enterprise, for seising  
the vessels, arms, and other means provided for it,  
ant] ?pr arresting and bringing to justice its authors  
and abettors. It was due to that good faith which  
ought ever to be the rule of action in public, as  
v .il an in private transactions; it was due to good  
order, and regular government, that, while the  
public force was acting strictly on the defensive,  
d merely to protect our cii.ii_.ens from aggression,  
the criminal attempts ol private individuals to de­  
cide, for their country, the question of peace or  
war, by commencing active, and unauthorized hos­  
tilities, siiould be promptly and efficaciously sup.  
pressed.  
Whether it will be necessary to enlarge our re­  
gular force, will depend on the result of our nego­  
ci.iious with Spain. But as it is uncertain when  
that result will be known* the provisional measures  
requisite for that, and to meet any pressure inter­  
vening in that quarter, will be a subject for your  
early consideration.  
\&#x27; Ihe possession of both banks of the Mississippi  
reducing to a single point the defence of that river,  
its waters, and the country adjacent, it becomes  
highly necessary to provide, for that point, a more  
adequate security. Some position above its mouth,  
Commandin,. the passage of the river, should be  
rendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed  
vessels which may be stationed there for defence ;  
and, in conjunction with them, to present an in­  
superable obstacle to any force, attempting to pass.  
The approaches to the city of New Orleans, from&#x27;  
the eastern quarter also, will require to be examin­  
ed, and more effectually guarded. For the internal  
•*upport of the country, the encouragement of a  
Strong settlement on the western side of the Mis­  
sissippi, within reach of New Orleans, will be  
won by the consideration of the Legislature.  
The gun-boats, authorised by an act of the last  
session, are so advanced, that they will be ready for  
service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances  
permitted us to allow the Ume necessary ior their  
  
J  
more solid conhtrnetiori. As a much larger num­  
ber will still be wanting to place our sea port towns  
and waters in that state of defence to which we  
are competent, and they entitled, a similar appro­  
priation for a farther provision of ttfeji. is re­  
commended for the ensuing year.  
A further appropriation will also be necessary  
for repairing fortifications already established,  
and the erection of such other works *_. raay  
have real eileet in obstructing the approach of  
an enemy to our sea-port towns, or their Re­  
maining before them.  
In a country whose constitution is derived  
from the &#x27;will of the people, directly expressed  
by their free suffrages, where the principal exe­  
cutive functionaries, and those of the lej_.is.a­  
i&quot;re, are renewed by liiem at short periods,  
where, under the character of jurors, they ex­  
ercise in person the greatest portion of the ju­  
diciary powers, where the laws are conse­  
quently so formed and administered as to bear  
with equal weight and favor on all, restraining  
no man in the pursuits of honest industry, and  
securing to every one the property which that  
acquires, it would not be supposed that any  
safeguards could be &#x27;needed against insurrec­  
tion, or enterprise, on the public peace or au­  
thority. The laws, however, aware that these  
should not be trusted to moral restraints only,  
have wisely provided punishment for these  
crimes when committed. But would it not be  
.•.nhitary to give also the means of preventing  
their commission ? Where an enterprise is  
meditated by private individuals, against a fo­  
reign nation, in amity with the United States,  
powers of prevention, to a certain extent, arc  
given by the laws. Would they not be as rea­  
sonable, andinef-il, where the enterprise pre­  
paring is against the United States ?—While  
adverting to this branch of law, it is proper to  
observe that in enterprises meditated against  
foreign nations, the ordinary process of bind­  
ing to the observance of the peace and. good  
behaviour, could it be extended to acts to be  
done out of the jurisdiction of the United  
States, would be effectual in some cases where  
the offender is able to keep out of sight every  
indication of his purpose which could draw on  
him the exercise of the powers now given by  
law.  
The states on the coast of Barbary seem ge­  
nerally disposed at present to respect our peace  
and friendship. With Tunis alone, some un­  
certainty remains. Persuaded that it is our in­  
terest to maintain our peace with tliem on equal  
terms, or not at all, I propose to send, in  
due time, a reinforcement into the Mediterra­  
nean ; unless previous information shall shew  
it to be unnecessary.  
We continue to receive proofs of the growing  
attachment of our Indian neighbors, and of  
their disposition to place all their interests un­  
der the patronage of the United States. These  
dispositions are inspired by their confidence in  
our justice, and in the sincere concern we feel  
for their welfare. . And as long as we discharge  
these high and honorable functions with the  
integrity and good faith which alone can enti­  
tle us to their continuance, we may expect to  
reap the just reward in their peace and friend­  
ship.  
The expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke,  
for exploring the river Missouri, and the best  
communication from that to the Pacific Ocean,  
has had all the success which could have been  
expected. They have traced the Missouri near­  
ly to its source, descended the Columbia to the  
Pacific Ocean, ascertained with accuracy the  
geography of that interesting communication  
across our continent, learnt the character of  
the country, of its commerce and inhabitants,  
and it is but justice to say that Messrs. Lewis  
and Clarke, and their brave companions, have,  
by this arduous service, deserved well of their  
country.  
The attempt to explore the Red River, under  
the direction of Mr. Freeman, though conduct­  
ed with a zeal and prudence meriting entire  
approbation, has&gt; not been equally successful.  
After proceeding up it about six hundred miles,  
nearly as far as the French settlements had ex­  
tended, while the country was in their posses­  
sion, our geographers were obliged to return  
widiout compleating their work.  
Very useful additions have also been made to  
our knowledge of the Mississippi, by Lieute­  
nant Pike, who has ascended it to its source,  
and whose journal and map, giving the details  
of his journey, will shortly be ready for com­  
munication to botii Houses of Congress.  
Those of Messrs. Lewis, Clark and Freeman,  
will require further time to be digested and pre­  
pared. These important surveys, in addition  
to those before possessed, furnish materials I  
commencing an accurate map ofthe Mississippi  
and its western waters. Some principal rivers  
however remain stj.ll to be explored, towards  
Which the authorisation oi Congress, by mo  
rate lumronriations, will be requisite.  
  
1 congratulate jcu, fellow-citizens, or  
approach of the period at which you may inter­  
pose your authority com &#x27;-aiiy, to with­  
draw the citizens of the United States from all  
further participation in tho.e violations of hu­  
man rights, which have been so lou;&gt;; continued ok  
the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and whic&#x27;a  
morality, the reputation, avid the best illterns**  
of our country, have long been eager to proscribe-  
Although no law you mavpass can take prohibito­  
ry effect til! the lirst day of.he year one tWisaad  
eight hundred and eight, yet the intervening peri.  
od is not too long to prevent, by timely v,4  
expeditious which cannot be completed before that  
tUiy.  
The receipts at the Treasury, during th-y  
ending on the 30th day of September last, have  
amounted to near fifteen millions of dollars ; wkicfc  
have enabled us, after meetingthe cursent demands  
to pay two millions seven hundred thousand dbU  
jars of the American claims, in part of the price of  
Louisiana ; to pay, ofthe funded debt, upwards of  
three millions of principal, and nearly four of inter-.  
est, and, in addition, to reimburse, in the course of  
the present month, near two millions of five ami ail  
half per cent, stock. These payments and

TV the Senate and Houfe of Reprefentatives of  
the United States f America^ in Congrefs  
ajfembled.  
  
It would have given me, fellow-citizens,  
great fatisfaCfion to announce, in the mo¬  
ment of your meeting, that the difficulties  
in our foreign relations, cxiRing at the time  
of your laR feparation, had been amicably  
and juRly terminated. I loR no time in  
  
taking thofe mcafures which were moR  
likely to bring them to fuch a termination,  
by fpccial miflimis, charged with fuch  
powers and ihRruClions, as in the event of  
failure, could leave no imputation on cither  
our moderation or forbearance. The de¬  
lays which hax&#x27;e taken Gnce place in our  
negixiations with the BririRi government,  
appear to have proceeded from caufes which  
do not forbid the expeClation that, during  
the courfe of the ieflion, I may be enabled  
j to lay before you their final iffiae. What  
I will be that of the negociations for fettling  
our differences with Spain, nothing which  
had taken place at the date of the laR dif-  
patches, enables us to pronounce. On the  
weRcrn fide of the Ml^flippi, Rie advan¬  
ced in confidcrable force, a *1 took poR at  
the fettlemcnt of Bayou Pierre, on the Red  
river. This village was originally fettled  
by France, was held by her as long as fhc  
held LouiGana, and was delivered to Spain  
only as a part of LouiGana ; being fmall,  
infulated, and diRant, it was not obferved,  
at the moment of re-delivery to France  
and the United States, that fhe continued  
a guard of half a dozen men, which had  
been Rationed there. A propofition, how¬  
ever, having been lately made, by our  
commander in chief, to affume the Sabine  
river as a temporary line of feparation be-  
tween^the troops of the two nations, until  
thcKTue of our negociations (hall be known,  
this has been referred, by theSpanifh com¬  
mandant, to his fuperior, and in the mean  
time he has withdrawn his force to the  
I weRern fide of&#x27; the Sabine river. The  
correfpondcnce on this fubje&lt;R, now com¬  
municated, will exhibit more particularly  
the prefenr Rate of things in that quarter.  
  
The nature of that country requires, in-  
difpenfably, that an unufual proportion of  
the force employed there fhould be cavalry,  
or mounted infantry. In order, therefore,  
that the commanding officer might be ena¬  
bled to adl with e^c6t, 1 had authorifed  
him to call on the governors of Orleans  
and Mifliflippi, for a corps ot five hundred  
volunteer cavalry.* The temporary ar¬  
rangement he has propofed may per¬  
haps render this unnccefTary. But 1 in¬  
form you with great pieafurcof the prompt-’  
itude with which the inhabitants of thofe  
territories have tendered their fcrvices-in&#x27;  
defence of their country. It has done  
honour to ihcmfelves, entitled tHcm to the  
confidence of their fellow-citizens in every  
parr of the union, and muR Rrcngthcil the’  
general^ determination to prorefl them effi-  
caciouRy under all circumRances whict^  
may occur.  
  
  
«  
  
Having nscelved information that in an*  
other part of the United States, a great  
number of private individuals were combi¬  
ning together, arming and organifiag them*  
felvcs contrary to law, to carry on a milita¬  
ry expedition again the territories of Spain,  
I thought it oecclTary by proclamation, as  
well as by fpecial orders, to take meafures  
for preventing and lupprefliog this enter-  
prize, for feizing the vcfTels, arms and  
other means provided for it, and for arreA-  
ing and bringing to juAice its authors and  
abettors. It was due to that good Taith  
which ought ever to be the rule of a&lt;Aion  
ID public, as well as private tranfaiAions, it  
was due to good order, and regular go¬  
vernment, that, while the public force was  
affing Ari&lt;Aly on the defcnfivc, and merely  
to proie^ pur citizens from aggreflion, the  
criminal attempts of private individuals to  
decide for their country the qucAion of  
peace or war, by commencing a&lt;Aive and  
unanthorifed hoAilities fliould be promptly  
and cfficacioufly fupprcfTed.  
  
Whether it will tve neccAary to enlarge  
our regular force, will depend on the rc-  
fult of our oegociations with Spain—but as  
It is uncertain when that refult will be  
known, the provifional meafures requidte  
for that, and to meet any pieflure interve¬  
ning ill that quarter, will be a lubjc^ for  
your early confidcration.  
  
The pofTellion of both banks of the Mif.  
AlFippi, reducing to a fioglc point the de¬  
fence of that river, its waters, and the coun¬  
try adjacent, it becomes highly nccelfary  
to provide for that point, a more adequate  
fecuriiy. Some polltion above its mouth,  
commanding the palTage of the river,  
Aiould be rendered fu/fidently Arong to  
cover the armed veAcls which-tnay be Aa-  
tioned there for defence, and, in conjunc¬  
tion with them, to prefent an inlupcrablc  
obAacle to any force, attempting to pals.  
The approaches to the city of Ne w-Oricans,  
from the e.iAefn quarter alio, will require  
to be examined, and more elftdnaliy guard¬  
ed. For the internal lupport of the coun&lt;  
try, the encouragement &#x27;of a Arong letiic-  
menton the weAern fide of the MilliUippi,  
within reach of New Orleans, will be wor¬  
thy the confidcration of the legiflature.  
  
The gun boats, authorifed by aii a6l of  
the laA Ic/fion, are fo advanced that they  
will be ready for fcrvice in the enluiog  
ipring ; circumAanccs permitted us to al¬  
low the time necefiTary for their more iolid  
conAruiAion. As a much larger number  
will Aill be wanting to place our lea-port  
towns and waters in that Aatc of detente

titled, a fimilar appropriation for a further  
provifion of them, is recommended for the  
enfuing year.  
  
A further appropriation will alfo be ne-  
ceflTary for repairing fortifications already  
eAablifiied, and the ereflion of fuch other  
works as may have real cfTe^f in obAruffing  
the approach of an enemy to our fea-port  
towns, or their remaining before them.

and favour on all, rcAraining no man in the  
purfuits of honeA induAry, and fecuriog  
to every one the property which that ac¬  
quires, it would not be fuppoled that any  
iafeguards could be needed againA infur-  
rcAion, or enterprize, on the public peace  
or authority. The laws, however, aw ire  
that thefe fhould not be rruAcd to moral re-  
Araints only, have wifdy provided puniAi-  
ment for thefe crimes when committed:  
but, would it not be falutary to give, alio,  
the means of preventing their commiflion ?  
Where an enterprize is meditated, by pri¬  
vate individuals, againA a foreign nation, io  
ami^y with the United States, powers of pre¬  
vention to a certain extent are given by the  
laws. Would they not be as reafonable, and  
ufeful, where the enterprize preparing is  
again A the United States ? While advert-  
ing to this branch of law, it is proper to  
obferve, that in cnterprilcs meditated agninA  
foreign na ions, the ordinary procefs of  
binding to the oblcrvancc of the peace and  
g(X&gt;d behaviour, could it be extended to  
a&lt;As to be d »nc out of the iurifdiClion of  
the United Stares, would be cfiTcCUial in  
fomc cafes where the offender is able to  
keep out of fight every indication* of hi^  
purpofe, which could draw on him the  
excrcife of the powers now given by law.  
  
The Aates on the coaA of Barbary feem  
generally difpofed at prefent to refpeCf our  
peice and friendlhip With funis alone,  
f »me uncertainty remains. Perliiaded that

We continue to receive proofs of the  
growiiig atta&lt; hmi*nt of »nr Indian ireigh-  
bours, and of their diljpofiiiou to place all  
  
their intercAs under the patronage of the U-  
nited States, fhefe difpofitions are iafpired  
by their confidence in our juAicc, and in the  
finccre concern we feel for their welfare.  
And as long as we difeharge thefe high and  
honourable funffions, with the integrity  
and good faith which alone can entitle u»  
to their continuance, wc may cxpe6l to  
reap the juA reward in their peace and

The expedition of MefTrs. Lewis and  
Clarke, for exploring the river MifTouri,  
and the beA communicarion from that to  
the Pacific ocean, has had all the fuccefs  
which could have been cxpc&lt;Acd. They  
have traced the MifiTouri nearly to its  
fburce, dcrcend&lt;fd the Columbia to the Pa¬  
cific ocean, afeerrained with accuracy the  
geography of that intcrcAing communica¬  
tion acrofs our continent, learnt the cha-  
ra&lt;Acr of the country, of its commerce and  
inhabitants, and it is but juAice to fay, that  
Meffrs. Lewis and Clarke, and their brave  
companions, have, by this arduous fervice,.  
deferved well of their country.  
  
The attempt to explore the Red river,  
under the direAion of Mr Freeman, though  
conduced with a zeal and prudence mcrit--  
ing entire approbation, has not been equal¬  
ly fucccfsfiil. After proceediag up it about  
fix hundred miles, nearly as far as the  
French feitlemcnts had extended, while  
the country was in their poAeflion, our ge¬  
ographers were obliged to return, without  
compleating their work.  
  
Very ufeful addirions hive alf:) been  
made to our knowledge of the Miilifiippi,  
by licut Pike, who has afeended it to its  
fource, and whofe journal and map, giving  
the derails of his journey, will fhortly bo  
ready for communication to both houfes of  
congrefs. Thofc of MefTrs. Lewis, Clarke,  
and Freeman, will require further time to  
be digeAcd and prepared. Thefe impor¬  
tant lurveys, in addition to rhofe before  
poffcATcd, furnifh materials for commencing,  
an accurate map of the Mifiiflippi and its  
WeAern waters. Some principal rivers,  
however, remain Aill to be explored, re¬  
wards which the auihorifaiion of congreici*,  
by moderate appropriations, will be requi-  
fitc.  
  
• I congratulate you, fellow citizens, on  
the approach of the period at which you  
may intcrpolc your authority, conAinition-  
illy, to withdraw the citizens of the Uni¬  
ted States from all further participation in&#x27;  
thefe violations of human rights, which  
have been fo long continued on the un«)f-  
tending inhabitants of Africa, and which &gt;

i|U€refts of our coonUy hive long been eager  
to proferibe } although no law you may  
p ^fs can lake prohibitory elTcfl till the-firA  
day of the year one thoufand eight hundred  
and eight, yet the intervening period is not  
too long to prevent^ by timely notice, ex-  
peditioni which cannot be completed be-  
foi*c that day.  
  
The receipts at the treafnry, during the  
year ending on the 30th day of September  
lad, have amounted to near fifteen millions  
of dollars, which have enabled ns, after  
meeting the current demands, to pay two  
millions feven hundred thousand dollars of  
the American claims, in part of the price  
of Louifiana ; to pay, of the funded debt,  
upwards of three millions of principal,  
and nearly four of inrereft, and, iir addi¬  
tion, to reimburfe, in tbcconrfe of the pre-  
fent month, nearly two millions of five  
and an half per cent. dock. Thefc pay¬  
ments and reimburrements of the funded  
debt, with thofe which had been made in  
the four years and an half preceding, will,  
at the clofe of the prefcntycar, have extin-  
gttilhed upwards of twenty-three millions  
of principal.  
  
The duties compofing the Mediterraneatk  
fund will ccafe by law, at the end of the  
prefent feffion. Confidcring, however,  
chat they arc levied chiefly on luxuries, and  
that we have an impod on fall, a neceflary  
of life, the free ufe of which otherwdfc is  
fo important, I recommend to your con-  
iideratioD, the fuppreflion of the duties on  
fait, and the continuation of the Mediter¬  
ranean fund, indcad thereof, for a (hort  
time ; after which, that alfo will become  
unneceflary for any purpofe now within  
contemplation.  
  
When both of thefc branches of revenue  
(hall in this way be reUnquifhed, there will  
dill, ere long, \yt an accumulation of monies  
in the treafury, beyond the in dal men ts of  
public debt, which we arc permitted by  
contract to pay. They cannot then, with¬

To the Senate and House of Representatives  
of the United States of America, in Con-  
gress assembled.  
  
It would have given me, fellow-citizens,  
great satisfaction to aiinounce, in the mo-  
ment of your meeting, that the difficulties  
in our foreign relations, existing at the time  
of your last separation, had been amicably  
and justly terminated. I lost no time in  
taking those measures which were most  
likely to bring them to such a termination,  
by special missions, charged with such  
  
ee and instructions as inthe event of  
  
ujlure, could leave no imputation on either  
our moderation or forbearance. The de-  
lays which have since taken place in our ne-  
gociations with the British government, ap-  
pear to have proceeded from causes which do  
not forbid the expectation that, during the  
course of the session, I may be enabled to  
lay before youtheir finalissue. What will  
be that of the negociations for settling our  
differences with Spain, nothing which  
had taken place at the date of the last dis-  
patches, enables us to pronounce. On the  
western side of the Missisippi she advanc-  
ed in considerable force, and took post at  
the settlement of Bayou Pierre, on the  
Redriver. This village was originally set-  
tled by France, was held by her as long as  
She held Louisiana, and was delivered to  
Spain only as a part of Louisiana. Being  
small, insulated, and distant, it was not ob-  
served at the moment of re-delivery to  
France and the United States, that she con-  
tinued a guard of half a dozen men, which  
had been stationed there. A proposition,  
however, having been lately made by our  
commander in chief, to assume the Sabine  
yiver as a temporary line of separation be-  
tween the troops of the two nations, until  
the issue of our negociations shall be  
known; this has been referred by the Spa-  
nish commandunt to his superior, and in the  
mean time he has withdrawn his force to  
the western side ofthe Sabine river. The  
correspondence onthis subject, now com-  
municated, will exhibit more particularly  
the p.escnt state of things :n that quarter.  
  
‘he nature of that country requires ii  
  
d.spensably, that an unusual proportion of  
tiie force ¢ int lox ed there should be caval-  
r., or mounted iniantry. In order, there  
fo.e, that the commanding officer might  
  
e chabled to at witn effect, i had autieo-  
rized him to call on the governors of O:-

render this unnecessary. But 1 inform  
with great pleasure, of the prompti  
with which the inhabitants of those fos

to themselves, entitled them to the cog  
dence of their fellow-citizens in every pay  
of the union, and must strengthen ge  
neral determination to protect them effig  
ciously under all circumstances which my  
occur.  
  
Having reccived information that  
another part of the United States a greg  
number of private individuals were combm,

selves, contrary to law, to carry on a mii  
tary expedition against the territories ¢  
Spain, I thought it necessary, by proclam  
tion, as well as by special orders, to take  
measures for preventing and suppressing  
this enterprize, for seizing the vessel,  
arms, and other means provided for it, and  
for arresting and bringing to justice itsay  
thors and abettors. It was due to tht  
good faith which ought ever to be the mk  
of action in public, as well as in private  
transactions; it was due to good onde,  
and regular government, that, while th  
public force was acting strictly on the de  
fensive, and merely to protect our citizens  
from aggression, the criminal attempts d  
private individuals to decide for their com  
try the question of peace or war, by com  
mencing active and unauthorized host  
ties, should be promptly and efficaciously  
suppressed.  
  
Whether it will be necessary to enlarge  
our regular force, will depend on the te  
sult of our negociations with Spain. But  
as it is uncertain when that result willbe  
known, the provisional measures requisite  
for that, and to meet any pressure intervel-  
ing in that quarter, will be a subject for  
your early consideration.  
  
The possession of both banks of the Mis-  
sisippi reducing to a single point the de-  
fence of that river, its waters, and the coun  
try adjacent, it becomes highly necessary  
provide, forthat point, a more adequate se  
curity. Some position above its mouth,  
commanding the passage of the river, should  
be rendered sufficiently strong to cover the  
armed vessels which muy be stationed there  
for defence ; and in conjunction with them  
to present an insuperable obstacle to any  
force, attempting topass. The approat hes  
to the City of New-Orleans, from the eas  
tern quarter also, willrequire to be examule  
ed,and more efle:tually guarded. Forthe

high and honourable functions with the inte-  
grity and good faith which alone can ex.title us  
tu thetr continuance, We may expect to reap  
the just reward in their peace and frrend-  
Ship.  
  
The expedition of Mess’rs Lewis and  
Ciarke, tor exploring the river Missouri, and  
the best communication from that to the  
Pacitic Ocean, has had ali the success which  
could have been expected. ‘hey have tra-  
ced the Missour: neariy to its source, des-  
cended the Cuuumbia to the Pacilic Ocean,  
ascertained with accuracy the geography of  
that interesting communication across our  
continent, learnt the character of the coun-  
try, of its commerce avd inhabitants; and  
it is but justice to say that Mess’rs Lewis  
and Clarsxe, and their brave companions,  
have, by this arduous service, deserved well  
of their country.  
  
The attempt to explore the Red River,  
under the direction ot Mr. Freeman, though  
cenducted with a zeal and prudence merit-  
ing entire approbation, has not been equally  
successful, Alter proceeding up it about  
six hundred mies, nearly far as the  
French settlements had extended, while the  
country was im their possession, our geogra-  
phers were obliged touwetura without come  
  
as  
  
| pletiug their work.  
  
Very useful additions have also been made  
to our knowledge of the Missisippi, by  
| Lieutenant Pike, who has aarnaed it to its  
| source, and whose journal and map, giving  
| the details of his journey, will shurtiy be  
ready for communication to both Houses of  
| Congress. ‘Those of Mess’rs Lewis, Ciarke,  
aud Freeman, will reguire further time te  
be digested and prepared. These important  
surveys, in addition to these before possess  
ed, furnish materials for commencing an ac-  
curate map of the Missisippt and its west-  
ern waters. Some principal rivers, bow-  
ever, remain still to be explored, tewards  
which the authorization of Congress, by mo-

To the Senate and House of Rcprepretentatires of the  
United of America in Congress assembled.  
It would have given me, fellow citizens, great  
satisfaction to announce, in the moment of your meet­  
ing, that jhe difficulties iu our foreign relations, ex­  
isting at‘the time of your last separation, had been  
.amicably and justly terminated. I lost no time in  
•taking those measures which-were most likely to  
bring them to such a termination, by special mis­  
sions, Charged with such powers and instructions  
as, in the event of failare, could leave no imputa­  
  
tjon on either ou„r moderation or forbearance. The  
delays; which have since taken place in our negooi­  
itions with the British Government, appear to have  
proceeded from causes which doy not torbid the ex­  
pectation that, during the course of the session, I  
may be enabled to lay before you their final issue.  
What will be that of the negociations for settUno  
our differences with Spain, nothing which bad tu^  
ken place, at the date of the last dispatches, ena­  
bles us to pronounce. On the western side of the 4  
Mississippi she advanced in r&lt; ns durable foice, and ,  
took [tost at the settlement of B iyou Pierre, on the  
Redriver. This village was o.Lmallv settled by  
France, was held by her as long as she held I,ouisi­  
ana, and was delivered to Spam only ns a part* of  
Louisiana. Being small, insulated, and distant, it  
was observed at the moment of re-delivery to  
France an J the United States, i hat she continued a  
guard of half a dozen men, which had been stati­  
oned there. A proposition however having been  
lately made by our commander in chief, to assume  
the Sabine river as a temporary line of separation  
between the troops of the two nations, until the  
issue of our negociations shall be known,  
this has been referred by the Spanish commandant  
to his superior, and in the mean time he lias with­  
drawn his force to the western side of the Sabine  
river. The correspondence on this subject, now  
communicated, will exhibit more particularly the  
present state of things in that quarter.  
I he nature of that country requires indispensa­  
bly that an unusual proportion of the force employ­  
ed there should he cavalry, or mounted infantry.—•  
In older therefore that th • commanding officer might  
be enah.ed to act with effect, I had authorised 1 i a  
to call on the Governoursof Orleans and Mississip­  
pi, for a corps of fire bundled volunteer cavalry.—­  
rih temporary arrangement he lias proposed n ay  
perhaps render this unnecessary. But I inform  
you with great pleasure, of the promptitude with  
which the inhabitants of those territories have ten­  
der their services in defence of their country. It  
has done honour to themselves, entitled them to the  
confidence of their fellow citizens in every part of  
the Union, and must strengthen the general deter­  
  
minaitcn to protect them efficaciously under all cir­  
cumstuiH&#x27;es which may occur.  
Having received in.urination that in another part  
of the Lnited States a great number of private in­  
dividuals were combining together, arming and or­  
ganising themselves, coiururv to law, to carry on a  
military expedition against ilie territories of Spain,  
1 thought it neees ary, by proclamation, as well as  
Ly special orders, to take nnasuies fur preventing  
and suppressing this entei prize, for seizing &#x27;h • ve -  
sels, arms, and ot &gt;er means piovide i lor it, a .d fer  
arresting and bringing to justice its authors and u­  
beitors. Jt was due to that good faith which ougl t  
ever to be the rule of action in publick, as well i a  
in private transactions ; it was due to good ordei,  
and regular government, that, while the publick  
force was acting strirth on the defensive, and m&lt; re­  
ly to protect our citizens from aggresssion, the cri­  
minal attempts of private individuals to*decide, for  
their country, the question of peace cr war, Ly  
commencing active, and unauthorised hostilities,  
should bepromptly and efficaciously suppressed.  
Whether it will he necessary to enlarge our regu­  
lar force, will depend on the result of our negociati­  
ons with Spain. But as it is uncertain when that  
result will be known, the provisional measures re­  
quisite for th’at, and to meet any pressure interven­  
ing in that quarter, will be a subject for your early  
consideration.  
The possession of both banks of the Mississippi  
reducing to a single point the dec nee of that river,  
its waters, and the country adjacent, it Incomes  
highly necessary to provide, for that point, a more  
adequate security. Some position-above itsmouth,  
commanding the passage of the river, should be  
rendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed ves­  
sels which may be stationed there for defence; and,  
in conjunction with them, to present an insuperable  
obstacle to any force, attempting to pass. The ap­  
proaches to the city of New Oileans, from theeas­  
tern quarter also, will require to be examined, and  
more effectually guarded. For the internal support  
of the country, the encouragement of a strong set­  
tlement on the western side of the Mississippi, with­  
in reach ot flew Orleans, will be worthy the consi­  
deration of the Legislature.  
The gun boats authorised by an act of the last  
session, are so advanced, that they w ill be ready  
for service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances  
permitted us to allow the time necessary for their  
more solid construction. As a much larger num­  
ber will be wanting to place our sea port towns and  
waters in that state of defence to which we are  
competent, and they entitled, a similar appropria­  
tion for a further provision of them is recommend­  
ed for the ensuing year.  
  
A further appropriation will also be necessary for  
repairing fortifications already established, and the  
erection of such other works as may have real  
effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to  
our sea-port towns, or their remaining before them.  
In a country whose constitution is d&lt; r ved from  
the will of the people, directly expressed by their  
free suffrages, where the principal executive func­  
tionaries, and those of the legislature, are renewed  
by them at short periods, where, under the charac­  
ter of jurors, they exercise in person the greatest  
portion of the judiciary pow ers, where the laws are  
consequently so formed and administered as to bear  
with equal weight and favour on all, restraining no  
man in the pursuits of honest industry, and secur­  
ing to every one the property which that acquires,  
it would not be supposed that any safeguards could  
be needed against insurrection, or enie.prize, on  
the public peace or authority. The laws, however,  
aware that these should not be trusted to moral res­  
traints only, have wisely provided punishment for  
these crimes when committed. But would!it not be  
salutary to give also the means of preventing their  
commission ? Where an enterpi ize is n»editated by  
private individuals, against a foreign nation, in ami­  
ty with the United States, powers of prevention,  
to a certain extent, are given by the laws. Would  
they not be as reasonable, and useful, where the  
enterprise preparing is against the United Stetes?—  
While adverting to this branch of law, it is proper  
to observe that in enterprises meditated against fo­  
reign nations, the ordinary process of binding to  
the observance of the peace and good behaviour^  
could it be extended to acts to be done out of the  
jurisdiction of the United States, would be effectu­  
al in some cases w here the offender is able to keep  
out of sight of every indication of his purpose which  
could diaw on hhu the exercise of the powers now  
given by law. • ^

as long as we discharge1 these high and honourable  
functions with the integrity and good faith which a­  
lone can entitle us to their continuance, we may ex­  
pect to reap the just reward in their peace and  
friendship.  
The expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, for  
exploring the river Missouri, and the best commu­  
nication from that to the Pacific Ocean, has had all  
the success which could have been expected. They  
have traced the Missouri nearly to its source, de­  
scended the Columbia to the Pacifick Ocean, as­  
certained with accuracy the geography of that in­  
teresting communication across our continent,  
learnt the character of the country, of its com­  
merce and inhabitants, and it is but justice to say  
that Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and their brave com­  
panions, have, by this arduous service, deserved  
Well of their country.  
The attempt to explore the Red River, under the  
direction of Mr. Freeman, though conducted with  
zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation, has  
not been equally successful. After proceeding up it  
about six hundred miles,nearly as far as the French  
settlements bad extended, while the country was in  
their possession, our geographers were obliged to re­  
turn without compleating their work.  
  
V ery useful additions have also been made to our  
knowledge of the Mississippi, by Lieutenant Pike,  
who has ascended it to its source, and whose jour­  
nal and map, giving the details of his journey, will  
shortly be ready for communication to both houses  
of congress. Those of Messrs. 1-ewis, Clarke and  
Freeman, will require further time to be digested  
and prepared. These important surveys, in additi­  
on to those before possessed, furnish materials for  
commencing an accurate map of the Mississippi  
and its western waters. Some principal rivers how­  
ever remain still to he explored, towards which the  
authorisation of congress, by moderate appropri­  
ations, will be requisite.  
I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the ap­  
proach of the poriod at which you may interpose  
your authority constitutionally, to withdraw the ci­  
tizens of the United States from all further partici- !  
pation in those violations of human rights, which  
have been so long continued on the unoffending in­  
habitants of Africa, and which the morality, the  
reputation, and the best interests of our country,  
have long been eager to proscribe. Although no  
law you may pass can take prohibitory effect till the  
first day of the year one thousand eight hundred and  
eight, yet the intervening period is not too long to  
prevent, by timely notice, expeditions which cannot  
he compleated before that day.  
The receipts at the Treasury, during the year &#x27;  
ending on the 30th day of September last, have  
amounted to near fifteen million of dollars ; which  
have enabled us. after meeting the current demands,  
to pay two millions seven hundred thousand dollars  
of the American claims, in part of the price of Loui­  
siana ; to pay, of the funded debt, upwards of three  
millions of principal, and nearly four of interest,  
ond in addition, to reimburse, in the course of the  
present month, near two millions of rive and an

Confess assembled.  
. Ir would h ive given me, fellow citizens,  
jjrrat satisfaction to announce, in the mo­

king thoic measures which were most like­  
ly to bring them to sdeh a ti*r rilnation,  
by special missions, charged with Such  
powers ;in;l instructions as, in the event  
of failure, could leave no imputation on  
either our uv&#x27;deratM&#x27;n or for *enranee,  
file delays which have since taken place in  
onr negociations with the British govern­  
mc.it, appear to have proceeded from cau­  
ses which do not foryid the expectation that  
during the course of the session I may be  
enabled t&lt;5 lav before vnu their tiilal issue.  
What wiii he that of the negociations f«&gt;r  
settling our difference* with Spain, no­  
thing which had taken place at the late of  
tlie last dispatches, enables me to pronounce.  
On the Western side of the Mississippi  
they’ advanced in considerable force and  
took post in toe settlement of Bayou Pierre,  
on the Red river. This village wa~ origi­  
nal iv settled by France, was heljd by her  
ac 1 &gt;ng as she licl 1 Louisiana, and was de­  
livered to Spain only as a part of Louisia­  
na. Being s nall, insulated, and distant, it  
was not observed at the moment of rc-dc­  
livfiy to France and the United States,  
that she continued a guard of half a do.  
y.cn men, which had been stationed there.  
A proposition h is been lately made by  
our com man ler in chief, to assume the Sa­  
bine river us n temporary line of smar-’ti­  
on between the tr&#x27;iops of the two nations un­  
til the issue of our negociations shall lit  
known ; this has( been referred by theSpa­  
nish commandant to his superior, and in  
the mean ti ne h** has withdrawn his force  
to tlie Western side of the Sabine river  
The correspondence on this subject, now

The nature of that Country requires in  
tUnrvrnsnbty tl tt an unusual proportion o  
the force employed there should be envoi  
t*y, or mounted infantry. Tn order, there

which the inhnbitapts o: those territorici  
Ji.ive rendered their cervices in defence o  
.their country, it has dene honor to them­

Jdieir fellow citizens in every part of the  
.union, and must strengthen the general dc­  
.terminatiyn to protect them efficaciously  
pa ler all circumstances which may occur  
Having received information that in a­  
,pothe»&#x27; psrt of rhe U. S. a great number o]  
.private ia liviais were combining together,  
arming and organizing themselves contrary  
•to la.w, to enjoy on a military expedition  
at.iinst the territories of .Spain, T thought  
necessary by proclamation as well as bv  
stvdal orders, to take .measures for pre­  
venting and suppressing this enterprise,  
jfor seizing the vessels, arms and other  
.me tns provided for it, and for arresting and  
fringing to’ justice its authors and abettors.  
It was dile to that go-&gt;l faith which ought  
jcvrv tn lie the rule of action, in public ns  
well as in private transactions; it was duo  
to pood or ley and regular government, that,  
while the public force was acting strictly on  
the defensive, arid merely to protect our  
Citizens from aggression, ti»e criminal at­  
tempts of privacd in ii&#x27;-id.uls to decide for  
their country, the.question of peace or wai*,  
hv commencing active and unauthorised  
hostilities, shoal 1 be promptly and efficaci­  
ously suppressed.  
Whether it will be necessary to enlarge  
onr regular force, will depend onth*&#x27; result  
of our associations with Spain. B it is it  
is Uncertain when that re ult will h? known,  
the provisional measures requisite for that  
and t &gt; meet any pressure, intervening in  
that quarter, will bo a ..object for your ear­  
ly consideration.  
The possession of both banks of the Mis­  
shs-.ppi reducing to a single point the de­  
fence of that river,its Waters, and the coun­  
try adjacent, it become*highly necessary to  
provide, for that point, a more adequate

thr internal support of the country, the en­  
couragement of a strong settlement on the  
western side ofthe Missh. dppi, within reach  
of Fcw-Orlcans, will he worthy the consi­  
der ition of the Legislature.  
The gun boats, authorised by an act of  
tV Ian session, arc so advanced, that they

, The attempt to explore the Red River  
under the dircctit .1 of Mr. Fvnrman tiio1  
1 conducted with a zeal and prudence me­  
;• riting entire approbation, has net been c­  
quully successful. After proceeding up ii

the countj y was in their pcsst xsiou, mir geo­

Very; useful additions have also been

by lieutenant Pike, who has asocr.dsd it to  
its source, apdjwhose journal and map, v v­  
j big tiie dftiils of his journey* will shortly

important surveys, in addition to those be­

menceing .1 accurate map cf the Mississip­

pal rivc *s however remain still to be ex­

may intc**,vise vorfr authority constitution­  
ally, to withdraw me citizens of the Untied  
• States, from &gt; il further participation in

J h ive been so long continued on the unoffbn­  
ding inhabitant* of Africa, und which the  
j nvrality, the reputation, and the he.%, in­  
j teresta of our country, have long been ea­  
I get* to proscribe. Although no law you may

&#x27; day of the year one thousand eight hunch  
dred .and cigiit, yet the ntervening peried  
[ 13 not too long to prevent, by timely notice,  
  
i erpcditims which cannot be completed  
; oefor c that day.  
The receipts at the treasury during the  
j year ending on the .10th day of September  
i last,.have amounted to near fifteen niilli­  
i ons of dollars, which have enabled us after  
ncei&#x27;ng the current demands, to pay two  
millions seven hundred thousand dollars of  
the American claims, in part r.f the price  
of Louisiana: to pay of the funded debt  
upwards of three millions of principal and  
nearly four of interest, and in addition to  
reimburse in the course of the present  
month, near two millions of five and an  
half per cent, stock. These payments and  
reimblir. ?mcnts of the funded deht, with  
those which had been made in the four years  
and an half preceding, will at the close of  
the present year have extinguished upwards  
of twenty-three millions of principal.  
The duties composing the Mediterranean  
fund will cease by law at the end of the  
present session ; considering however, that  
they are levied Chic51 y on luxuries, Fc that  
wc have an impost on salt, a necessary Of  
life, the free use of which otherwise is so  
important, 1 recommend to your consider­  
ation the suppression of the duties on salt,  
and the continuation of the Mediterranean  
fund, instead thereof, for a short time ; af­  
ter which that also will become unnecessary  
rnr any purpose now within contemplation.  
When Doth of these branches of revenue  
shall in this way he relinquished, there  
will still, ere long, be an accumulation of  
monies in the treasury beyond the instal­  
ments of public debt which wc are permit­  
ted hv contract to p; v. They cannot then  
without a modification assented to by the  
public creditors, be applied to the extin­  
guishment of this debt and the complete li*  
bertition of our revenue, the most desirable  
j of all object?. Nor, if our peace continues,  
will they be wanting for any other existing  
i  
  
purpose. The question therefore now conies  
forward, to what other objects shall these  
| surplusses be appropriated ? and the whole  
&#x27; surplus of import alter the entire discharge  
! of the public debt, and during those intervals  
i when the purposes of war shall not call for  
them ? Ph ill wc suppress the impost and  
give that advantage to foreign over domes*  
tic manufactures. On a few articles of more  
general and necessary use, the sitppressi­  
&gt;n, in due season, will doubtless bo right;  
•nit the great mass of the articles on which ^  
impost is paid, are foreign ltptur.es, pur- ■  
chased by those only who are rich enough

Having received information that in another pari  
of the United States a great number of priva e idi-  
viduals were combining together, arming and or-  
ganising themselves, contrary to law. tocarry on a  
military expedition agains: the territories of Spain,  
I thought it necessary, by proclamation, as well as  
by s; ecial orders, to take measures for preven ing  
and suppressing this enterprise. for seizing the ves-  
sels, arms, and other meas provided for it, and for  
arresting and bringing to jus ice 1s auchors and a  
bettors. kt was due to that good faivh which ought  
ever to be the rule .f action in public. as well as  
private transactions; it was due to good order, aud  
regular government, that, while the public force was  
acting strictly on the defensive, and merely to pro-  
tect our citizens from aggression, the c:iminal at-  
tempts of private individuals to decide, for their  
country, the question of peace or war by commenc-  
ing active, aud unauthorized hostilities, should be  
promptly and efficaciously suppressed  
  
Whether i: will be necesssry to enlarge our rezgu-  
lar force, will depend on the result of our neg. cra-  
tions with Spain. But as it is uncertain when that  
result will be known, the provisional measures re-  
quisite for that, and to meet any pressure interven-  
ing in that quarter, will be a subject for your early  
consideration.  
  
The possession of both banks of the. Mississippi  
reducing to a single point the defence of that river,  
its waters, and the country adjacent, it becomes  
highly necessary to provide, for that point, a more  
adequate security. Some position ab ve its mouth,  
commanding the passage of the river, should be  
rendered sufiiciently strong to cover the a:med ves-  
sels which may be stationed there for defence; and,  
i conjunction with them, to present an insuperable  
obstacie to any force, a&#x27;iempring to pass. ‘ihe ap-  
proacnes to the city of New-Orleans, from the east  
ern quarter also will require to be examined, and  
mor effectually guarded, For the internal support  
of ‘he country, the en ourage ment of a s&#x27;reng set-  
tlement on the western side f he Mississippi, with  
in reach of New Orleans, will be worthy the consid-  
eration of the leg slarute

session, are so advanced that chey wili be ready fr

The expedition of Messrs Lewis and Clarke for  
expl ring ‘he rver Missouri, a d the best commu.  
fication from that to -he Pacific Ocean, has had all  
the success whiche wid nave been expected. They  
have traced ‘he Miss’ uri neatly to is source, de.

hab tants, and it is bu’ justice to say tha: Messrs,  
Lewis and Clarke, aod ‘heir brave companions,  
have, by this arduous service, deserved weil of their  
cou try.  
  
The artempt to explore the Red River, under the  
direction of Mr Freeman, though conduc ed witha  
zeal aud prudence meri&#x27;ing entire app: ebaicn, has  
pet been equall) successful. After proceeds g up it  
about six hund ed miles, nearly as far asthe French  
settlements had extended while the country was ip  
their possession, our ge-graphers were obliged te  
return withour completing their work,  
  
Very useful additions have also been made to out  
knowkdge of the Mississippi, by Lieu enant P:ke,  
who has ascended it to its source, and whose j ur-  
nal and map, giving the de‘ails of h.s journey, wilh  
shortly be ready fur conimunicaticn to both Houses  
of Congress. Those of Messrs. Lewis, Clark a @  
Freeman, wiil require further tine to be digested  
and prepared ‘These imporiant surveys, in sddi-

commencing an accurate map of the Mississippi and  
its western waters. Some principal rivers however  
remain sill to be explored, towa:ds which the aw  
thorisarion of Congre.s, by moderate appropriations,  
will be requisite.

Considering, however, that they are lewed chiefly  
on luxuries, and that we have an impost on sali, @

the suppression of the duties on sait, and the con-  
tinuation of the Mediterranean fuid, insiead theres

be an accumulation of monies in the treasury bey. nd  
the instalments of public debt which we are permit  
ted by contract to pay. They cannot then, without  
@ modification, assented to by the public creditors,  
be applied to the extinguishment of this devt and  
the complete liberation of our revenues, the most  
desirable of all objec’s. Mor, if ow peace contin ues,  
will they be wanting for any other ex sung perpose

advanrage to foreign over d mestic manut.c.ures?  
On a few articles of more general and necessary use,  
the suppression, in due season, will di ubriess be  
right; bur the great mass of the articles on which

and prepared. These important surveys,  
in addition to those before possessed  
furnish materials for commencing an ac­  
curate map of the Missiaaippi and its  
western waters—Some principal rivers  
however remain still to be explored, to­  
wards which the authorization of Con­  
gress, by moderate appropriations, will  
be requisite.  
I congratulate yon, fellow-citizens,  
on the approach of the period at which  
yod may interpose your authoritv const i­  
tut ion ally, to withdraw the citizens of  
the United States from all further parti­  
cipation hi those violations of human  
rights, which have been so long continued  
on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa,  
and which the morality, the reputation,  
and the tint interests of our country have  
long been eager to proecribe. Although  
wo law you thav past caw take prohibitory  
effect til&#x27; the first day of the year one thou­  
sand eight hundred add eight, yet the  
intervening period is not too long to pre­  
vent, by timely notice, expeditions  
which cannot be compleated before that  
d*y-&#x27; • . •# \ ; ’W&quot;  
  
Th« receipts at the treaurv, during  
the year sncHog on the Sbth of September  
lawt, have amounted to sear fifteen mil.  
lions of dollars ! which have enabled us,  
after mertihg the current demands, to&#x27;  
S two millions seven hundred thousand  
ara of the American claims, in part  
of the price of Louisiana ; to pay, of the  
funded debt, upwards of three mttHuna  
of principal, and neirly foul- of Interest,  
and, in addition, to reimburse, in the  
course of the present month, near two  
millions of five and an half par cent,  
•tuck. T he sc pavnients ahd reimburse­  
we tits of the fttndtd debt, with those  
which had been made In the four years  
and an half preceding, w ill, at the close  
ol the present year, have extinguished  
upwards of twenty three millions ofprin­  
clpal. i  
The ditties composing the Mediter­  
ranean fund trill cease, bylaw, at the  
end of the pretest session. Considering,  
however, that they are levied chiefly on  
luxuries.,, and that&#x27;we have an impost on  
salt, a necessary of lift, the free use of  
which otherwise is so important, I re­  
commend to your consideration the Sup­  
pression of the^duties on salt,-and the  
continuation of the Mediterranean fund,  
instead thereof, h&gt;r a short time, after  
which fhat also will become-unnecessary

Withdrawn his force to the weftern fide of  
the Sabine river. The corrcfpondence  
on this fubjetft* now communicated, will  
exhibit more particularly the prtfent ftate  
o£ things in that quarter.  
The nature of that country &#x27;requires  
indifptnfably that an unufual proportion  
of the force employed there Hiould be  
cavalry, or mounted infantry. In order  
therefore that the commanding officer  
might be enabled to :uft wi^b effeifl, 1 had  
authorifed him locail on fhe Governors  
of Orleans and Mifiifippi, for a corps of  
five hundred volunteer cavalry. The  
temporary arrangement he has propofed  
may pi rhaps render this uonecetlary. But  
I inform you with great pleafure of the  
promptitude with which the inhabitants  
of thofc territories have tendered their  
ftrvices irf defence of their countrj. It  
has done honor to thcmfclves entitled

they entitled, a limilar appropriation for  
a fmther provifion of them is recom­

A further appropriation w&#x27;i\\ affo be

Do the Senate and Houfé of Representatives of the United States of  
America, in Congress assembled. s  
IT would have given me, Pellow-Citizens, great fatisfa@ion to announce in  
the moment of your meeting, that the difficalties in our foreign relavions,  
exiting at the time of your last separation, had been amicably an jultly termi.  
nated. I loft no time in tuking those measures which were molt likely to bring  
them to such a termination, by special missions, charged with such powers and  
inftru&amp;ions as, in the event of failure, could leave no imputation on either our  
moderation or forbearance. The delays, which have since taken place in our  
negociations with the Britith Government, appear to have proceeded from  
causes which do not forbid the expe@ation that, during the courfs of the {effion,  
I may be enabled to lay before you their final issue. What will be that of the  
negociations for fettling our differences with Spain, nothing which had taken  
place, at the date of the lalt dispatches, enables us to pronounce. On the west­  
ern fide of the Miflifippi the advanced in considerable force, and took polt at  
the settlement of Bavou Pierre, on the Red river. This village was originally  
fettled by Irance, was held by Lar as long as she held Louisiana, and was deliv­  
ered to Spain only asa part of Louisiana. Being {mall, infulatad, and distant,  
it was not oblerved at the moment of re-delivery to France and the U. States,  
that (he continted a guard of half a dozen men, which had been Rationed there.  
A propofiifon, however, having been lately made by our commander in chief,  
to assume the Sabine river as a temporary line of {zparation between the troops  
of the two pations, until the issue of our negociations thall be known, this has  
been referred by the Spanith commandant to his superior, and in the mean time  
he hias withdrawn his force to the wellern fide of the Sabine river.—~The corref.  
pondence on this [ubje&amp;; now communicated, will exhibit more parjicularly the  
present state of things in that quarter. ;  
The nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual proportion  
of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted infantry. In order  
therefore that the commanding officer might be enabled to 2@ with effe@, I  
had authorized him to call on the Governors of Grleans and Miffifippi, for a  
corps of five bundred volunteer cavalry. The temporary arrangement he has  
proposed may perhaps render this unneceflary. Bur I inform you, with great  
plealnre, of the promptitude with which the inhabitants of those territories have  
teddered their services in defence of their country. It has done honor to them­  
selves, entitled them to the confidence of their tellow citizens in every part.of  
the Union, and must firengthen the general determination to proteét them eflis  
cacioufly under all cireumltances which may occur,  
Having received information, that in another part of the United States a  
great number of private individuals were combining together, arming and ora  
ganizing themlielves, contrary to law, to carry on a military expedition against  
the territories of Spain, I thought it neceflary, by proclamation, as well as by  
[pecial orders, to take measures for preventing and fupprefling this enterprize,  
for seizing the veflcls, arms, and other means provided for it, and for arresting  
and bringing to Justice its authors and abettors, It was daa to that good faith  
which ougit ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private trans­  
actions ; 1t was due to good order, and regular government, that, while the  
public force was adting Rrictly on the defenfive, and merely to prote&amp; our citi­  
zens from aggreflion, the criminal attempts of private individuals to decide, for  
their country, the question of peace or war, by commencing aéive and unau­  
thorized holtilities, thould be promptly and efficacioufly fappreffed. ’  
Whether it will be neceflary to enlarge our regular force, will.-depend on the  
result of our negociations with Spain. But as it is uncertain when that result  
will be knowa, the provisional measures requisite for that, and to meet any pres­  
sure intervening in that quarter, will be a {ubjec for your early consideration.  
The poflzffion of both banks of the Miflifippi reducing to a single point the  
defence of that river, its waters, and the country-adjacent, it becomes highly ne­  
ceflary to provide, for that point, a more adequate security. Some position  
above its mouth, commanding the paflage of the river, should be rendered fufs  
ficiently strong to cover the armed vell:ls, which may be fationed there for dea  
fence ; and, in conjunéion with them, to present an insuperable obstacle to any  
force, attempting to pass. The approaches to the city of New Orleans, from -  
the eastern quarter also, will require to be examined, and more eifetually  
guarded. For the internal {fupport of the country, the encouragement of a  
{trong settlement on the welterm fide of the Miflifippi, within the reach of New  
Orleans, will be worthy the consideration of the Legislature.  
&#x27;The Gun-boats, authorized by an a&amp; of the last feflion, are so advanced, that  
they will be ready for service in the énfuing spring. Circumstances permitted  
us to allow the time neceflary for their moré solid conftrudtion. As a 2 much  
larger number will fill be wanting to place our fea.port towns and waters ig  
hat {tate of defence to which wejare competent, and they entitled,a similar ap­  
propriation for a further provision of them&#x27;is recommended for the ensuing year.  
A further appropriation will also be neceflary for repairing fortifications al­  
ready eltablifhed, and the erefion of fiich other works as may have real effeé  
in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our seaport towns, or their remain­  
ing before them. sy : :  
In a eountry whose constitution is derived from the will of the people, direéily  
expreflzd by their free fuffrages, where the principal Executive Fundionaries;  
and those of the Legillature, are renewed by them at short periods, where; un­

judiciary powers, where the laws are consequently so formed and administered  
as to bear with equal weight and favor on all, restraining no man in the par­  
{uits of honelt indultry, and securing to every one the property which that ac­  
quires, it would not be supposed that any fafegnards could be needed against  
infurredion, or enterprize, on the public peace or authority. The laws, how­  
ever, aware that thele thould not be trufled to moral restraints only, have wifely  
provided punishment for these crimes when committed, But would it rot be  
salutary to give also the means of preventing their commiflion J?\ thr__can. en­

The fatzs on the coalt of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to re­  
¥pedt our peace and friendfhip. With Tunis alone, some uncertainty remains.  
Persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with th=m on equal terms,  
or not at all, T propose to fend in due time a reinforcement into the Mediterra­  
nean, unlels previous infermation thall thew it to be uuneceflary.  
We continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our ladian neigh­  
bors, and of their difpefition to place all their intereflts under the patronage of  
the United States. These dispositions-are inspired by their confidence in our  
jultice, and in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare. And as long as  
- we discharge these high and honorable fun&amp;ions with the integrity ard good  
faith which alone can entitle us ta their continnance, we may expeé to reap the  
jult reward in their peaceand frizndfhip. | _ ‘  
The expedition of Meflrs. Lewis and Clarke, for exploring the river Miffou­  
-li, and the best communication from that to the Pacific Ocean, has had all the  
success which could have been expefted. They have traced the Missouri near-  
Iy to its source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, ascertained with  
accuracy the geography of that intereffing communication across our continent,  
learnt the charater of the country, of its commerce and inhabitants, and it is  
but justice to fay that Mefirs. Lewis and ‘Clarke, and their brave companions,  
have, by this arduous service, deserved well of their country.  
The attempt to explore the Red River, under the dire@ion of Mr. Freeman&gt;  
though conduéted with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation, has  
not been equaily fuccelsfal After proceeding up about fix-hundred miles, near.  
1y as far as the French settlements had extended, while the country was in their  
pofleflion, our geographers were obliged to return without compleating their  
work,  
Very ufeful additions have also been made to our knowladge of the Miffifip­  
pi, by Lientenant Pike, who has ascended it to its source, and whose journal and  
map, giviing the details of his journey, will shortly be ready for communication  
to both Houses of Congress. ‘Thofe of Meflrs. Lewis, Clarke and Freeman, will  
require further rime to be digested and prepared. These important surveys, in  
addition to those before possessed, furnifh materials for commencing an accurate  
map of the Miffifippi and its western waters. Some principal rivers however,  
remain (til to be explored, towards which the authorifation of Congress, by  
moderate appropriations, will be requisite.  
[ congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the period at which  
you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of

to this branch of law it is proper to observe,  
that in. enterprises meditated against foreign  
nations, the ordinary process of binding to  
the observance of the peace and gtfod beha­

out of the jurisdiction&#x27; of the United States,

leave no imputation on either our modera-  
tion or forbearance. ‘The delays which have  
since taken place in our negociations with  
the British government, appear to have pro-  
ceeded from causes which do not forbid the  
expectation that, during the course of the  
session, | may be enabled to lay before you  
their final issue. What will be that of the  
negociations for settling our differences with  
Spain, nothing which has taken place, at the  
date of the last dispatches, enables us to pro-  
nonnce. On the Western side of the Mis-  
sissippi, she advanced in considerable force,  
  
&#x27;and took post at the settlement of Bayon  
Pierre, on the Red River. This village was  
originally settled by France, was held by her  
as long as she held Louisiana, and was deli-  
vered to Spain enly as a part of Louisiana.  
Being small, insulated, and distant, it was  
not observed at the moment of re-delivery to  
France and the United States, that she con-  
tinued a guard of half a dozen men, which  
had been stationed there. A proposition,  
however, having been lately made by our  
commander in chief to assume the Sabine  
River as a temporary line of separation be-  
tween the troops of the two nations, until  
the issue of our negociations shall be known,  
  
this had been referred by the Spanish Com-  
  
mandant to his superior, and in the mean  
time he has withdrawn his force to the Wes-  
tern side of the Sabine River. The corres-  
pondence on this subject, now communi-  
cated, will exhibit, more particularly, the  
present state of things in that quarter.—The  
nature of that. country requires indispensibly  
that an unusual proportion of the force em-  
ployed there should be cavalry, or mounted  
infantry. In order, therefore, that the com-  
manding officer might be enabled to act with  
effect, 1 had authorised him to call on the  
  
Governors of Orleans and Mississippi, for a  
  
corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry. The  
  
temporary arrangements he has proposed,  
may perhaps render this unnecessary. But  
  
inform, you, with great pleasure, of the  
promptitude with which the inhabitants of  
those territories have tendered their services  
in defence of their country. It has done ho-  
hour to themselves, entitled them to the con-  
filence of their fellow citizens in every part  
of the union, and must strengthen the gene-

as by special orders, to take measures for pre-  
venting and suppressing this enterprise, for  
seizing the vessels, arms, and other means  
provided for it. and for arresting and bring-  
ing to justice, the authors and abettors. It  
was due to that good faith which ought ever  
to be the rule of action in public, as well as  
in private transactions; it was due to good  
order, and regular government, that while  
the public force was acting strictly on the dc«  
fensive, and merely to protect our citizens  
from aggression, the criminal attempts of  
private individuals, to decide for their coune-  
try the question of peace or war, by come  
mencing active and unauthorised hostilities,  
should be promptly and efficacionsly sup-  
pressed. Whether it will be necessary to  
enlarge our regular force, will depend on  
the result of our negociations with Spain.  
But as it is uncertain when that result will  
  
_ be known, the provisional measures :equisite  
  
for that, and to meet any pressure interven-  
ing to that quarter, will be a subject for your  
early consideration. ‘The possession of both  
banks of the Mississippi, reducing to asing!e  
point the defence of that river, its waters,  
and the country adjacent, it becomes highly  
necessary to provide for that point a more  
adequate security. Some position above its  
mouth, commanding the passage of the ri-  
ver, should be rendered sufficiently strong  
to cover the armed vessels which may be  
stationed there for defence; and, in conjunc  
tion with them, to present an insuperable  
  
| obstacle to any force attempting to pass. ‘The  
  
approaches to the city of New Orleans, from  
the eastern quarter also, will require to be  
examined, and more effectually guarded. For  
the internal support of the country, the en-  
couragement of a strong settlement on the  
western side of the Mississippi, within reach  
of. New Orleans, will be worthy the consi-  
deration of the legislature. ‘The gua boats,  
authorised by an act of the last session, are  
so advanced, that they will be ready for ser-  
vice in the ensuing spring. Circumstances  
permitted us. to allow the time necessary for  
their more solid construction. As a much  
larger number will still be wanting to place  
our sea port towns ane waters in that state of  
defence to which we are competent, and

 formed  
and administered as to bear with equal  
weight and favour on all, restraining no  
man in the pursuits of honest industry, and  
securing to every one the property which  
that acquires, it would not suppose that any  
safeguards could be needed against insurrec-  
tion or enterprize, on the public peace or  
authority. The laws, however, aware that  
these should not be trusted to moral re-  
straints only, have wisely provided punish-  
ments for these crimes, when committed.  
But would it not be salutary to give also the  
means of preventing their commission?  
Where an enterprize is meditated by private  
individuals against a foreign nation, in amity  
with the United States, powers of preven-  
fion, to acertain extent, are given by tke  
laws. Would they not be as reasonable and  
useful, where the enterprize preparing is  
against the United States? While adverting  
to this branch of law, it is proper to observe,  
that in enterprizes meditated against foreign  
nations, the ordinary process of binding to  
the observance of the peace and good beha-  
viour, could it be extended to acts to be done  
out of the jurisdiction of the United States,  
would be effectual in scme cases where the  
oftender is able to keep out of sight every  
indication of his purpose which could draw  
on him the exercise of the powers nowgiven  
by law.—The states on the coast of Barbary  
seem generally disposed at present to respect  
peace and friendship. With Tunis alone  
some uncertainty remains... Persuaded that  
itis our interest to maintain our peace with  
them onmequal terms, or not atall, I propose  
to send, in due time, a reinforcement to the  
Mediterranean, unless previous information  
shall shew it to be unnecessary.—We conti-  
nue to receive proofs of the growing attach-  
ment of our Indian neighbours, and of their  
disposition to place all their interests under  
the patronage of the United States. These  
dispositions are inspired by their confidence  
in our justicé, andin the sincere concern we  
féel for their welfare. And as long as we  
discharge these high and honourable func-  
tions with the integrity and g&gt;.od faith which  
  
alone can eutitle us to their continuance, we -  
  
may expect to reap the just reward of their

of the country, of its commerce and inhabi-  
tants: and it is but justice to say, that  
Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and their brave  
companions, have, by this arduous service,  
deserved well of their country.—-—The at-  
tempt to explore the Red River, under the  
direction of Mr. Freeman, though conducted  
with a zeal and prudence mefiting entire  
approbation, has not been equally successful.  
Atter proceeding up it about six hundred  
miles, nearly as far as the French settlements  
had extended, while the country was in their  
possession, our geographers were obliged to  
return, without completing their work.——  
Very useful additions have also been made to  
our knowledge of the Mississippi, by Lieut.  
Pike, who has ascended it to its source, and  
whose journal and map, giving the details of  
his journey, will shortly be ready for com-  
munication to both Houses of Congress.  
Those of Messrs. Lowis, Clarke, and Free-  
man, will require further time to be digested  
and prepared. ‘These important surveys, in  
addition to those before possessed, furnish  
materials for commencing an acchirate map  
of the Mississippi and its western waters,  
Some principal rivers, however, remain still  
to be explored, towards which the authorisa-

will be requisite —1 congtatulate you fellow  
citizens, on the approach of the period at

which have been so long since continued on  
the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and  
which the morality, the reputation, and the  
best interests of our country, have long been  
eager to proscribe. Although no law you  
may pass can take prohibitory effect till the  
first day of the year 1808, yet the intervening  
period is not too long to prevent, by timely  
notice, the expeditions which cannot be  
completed before that day.—The receipts of  
the Treasury, during the year ending on the  
30th day of September last, have amounted  
to near fifteen millions of dollars; which  
have enabled us, after méeting the current  
  
‘demands, to pay two millions séven hundred  
  
thousand dollars of the American claims, ia  
part of the price of Louisiana; to pay, of the

our moderation or forbearance. The de-  
lays, which have since taken place in our  
negociations with the British Government,  
appearto have proceeded from causes which  
do not forbid the expectation that, during  
the course of the session, I may be enabled  
to lay before you their final issue. What  
will be that of the negociations for settling  
our differences with Spain, nothing which  
had taken place, at the date of the last dis-  
patches, enables us to pronounce. On the  
Western side of the’ Mississippi, she ad-  
vanced in considerable force, and took post  
at the settlement of Bayou Pierre, on the  
Red River. This village was originally  
settled by France, was held by her as long  
as she held Louisiana, and was delivered to  
Spain only as a part of Louisiana. Being  
small,’ insulated, and distant, it was not  
observed, at the moment of re-delivery to  
Francé and the United States, that she con-  
tinued a guard-of-half a dozen men, which  
had been stationed there. A proposition,  
however, having been lately made by our  
Commander-in-Chief, to assume the Sabine  
River, as a temporary line of separation be-  
ween the troops of the two nations, until  
the issue of our negociations shall be known,  
this has been referred by the Spanish Com-  
mandant to his superior, and in the mean,  
time he has withdrawn his force to the  
western side of the Sabine River. The cor-  
respondence on this subject, now commu-  
nicated, will exhibit, more particularly, the  
present state of things in that quarter.  
  
The nature of that country requires in-  
dispensably that an unusual proportion of  
the force employed there should be cavalry,  
or mounted infantry. In order, therefore,  
that the commanding officer might be en-  
abled to act with effect, I had authorised  
him to call on the Governors of Orleans  
and Mississippi, for a corps of five hundred  
volunteer cavalry. The temporary arrange-  
ment he has proposed, may perhaps render  
this unnecessary. But 1 inform you, with  
great pleasure, of the promptitude witis  
which the inhabitants of those territories  
have tendered their services in defence of  
their country. It has done honour to them-  
selves, intitled them to the confidence of  
their fellow-citizens in every part of the  
union, and must strengthen the general de-  
termination to protect them efficaciously,  
under all circumstances which may occur.  
  
Having received information, that in  
another part of the United States, a great  
number of private individuals were com-  
bining together, arming and organising  
themselves, contrary to law, to carry ou a  
military expedition against the territories of  
Spain, I thought it necessary, by proclama-  
tion, as well as by special orders, to take  
measures for preventing and suppressing  
this enterpaise, for seizing the vessels, arms,  
  
2N  
  
  
  
‘278  
  
and other means provided for it, and for  
arresting and bringing to justice, its authors  
and abettors. It was due to that good faith  
which ought ever to be the rule of action in  
public, as well as in private transactions; it  
was due to good order, and regular govern-  
ment, that while the public force was acting  
strictly on the defensive, and merely to pro-  
tect our citizens from aggression, the cri-  
minal attempts of private individuals, to  
decide for their country the question of  
peace or war, by commencing active and  
unauthorised hostilities, should be promptly  
and efficaciously suppressed.  
  
Whether it will be necessary to enlarge  
our fegular force, will depend on the result  
of our negociations with Spain. But as  
it is uncertain when that result will be  
known, the provisional measures requisi’e  
for that, and to meet any pressure inter-  
vening to that quarter, will be a subject  
for your early consideration.  
  
The possession of both banks of the  
Mississippi reducing to a single point the  
defence of that river, its waters, and the  
country adjacent, it becomes highly neces-  
sary to provide for that point, a more ade-  
quate security. Some position above its  
mouth, commanding the passage of the  
river, should be rendered sufficiently strong  
to cover the armed vessels which may be  
Stationed there for defence; and in con-  
  
junction with them, to present an insu-  
perable obstacle to any force attempting to  
  
pass. The approaches to the city of New  
Orleans, from the eastern quarter also, will  
require to be examined, and more effectu-  
ally guarded. For the internal support of  
the country, the encouragement of a strong  
settlement on the western side of the Mis-  
sissippi, within reach of New Orleans, will  
be worthy the consideration of the Legis-  
lature.  
  
The gun-boats, authorised by an Act of  
the last Session, are so advanced, that they  
will be ready for service in the ensuing  
spring. Circumstances permitted us to al-  
low the time necessary for their more solid  
construction. As a much larger number  
will still be wanting to place our sea-port  
towns and waters in that state of defence to  
which we are competent, and they entitled,  
a similar appropriation for a further pro-  
vision of them is recommended for the en-  
suing year.  
  
A further appropriation will also be  
necessary for repairing fortifications already  
established, and the erection of suck. other  
works as may have real effect in obstructing  
the approach of an enemy to our sea-port  
towns, or their remaining before them.  
  
In a country whose constitution is de-  
rived from the will of the people, directly  
expressed by their free suffrages, where the  
principal executive functionaries, and those  
  
Historical Chronicle.  
  
fMarcy  
  
of the legislature, are renewed by them at  
short periods, where, under, the character  
of jurors, they exercise in person the greatest  
portion of the judiciary powers, where the  
laws are consequently so formed and ad-  
ministered as to bear with equal weight  
and favour on all, restraining no man inthe  
pursuits of honest industry, and securing to  
every one the property which that acquires,  
it would ‘not be supposed that any safe.  
guards could be needed against insurrec-  
tion or enterprize, oa the public peace or  
authority. ‘The laws, however, aware that  
these should not he trusted to moral re  
straints anly, have wisely provided punish.  
ment for these crimes, when comuniited.  
But would it not be salutary to give also  
the means of preventing their commission?  
Where an enterprize is meditated by private  
individuals against a foreign nation, in  
amity with the United States, powers of  
prevention, to a cestain extent, are given  
by the laws. Would they not be as rea  
sonable and useful, where the enterprise  
preparing is against the United States!—  
While adverting to this branch of law, it is  
proper to observe, that in enterprises me  
ditated against foreign natioss, the ordinary  
process of binding to the observance of the  
peace and good behaviour, could *it be ex-  
tended to acts to be done out of the juris-  
diction of the United States, would be ef-  
fectual in some cases where the offender is  
able to keep out of sight every indication  
of his purpose which could draw on him  
the exercise of the powers now given by hw.  
  
The States on the coast of Barbary seem  
generally disposed at present to respect  
peace and friendship. With Tunis alone,  
some uncertainty remains. Persuaded that  
it is our interest to maintain our peace with  
them on equal terms, or not at all, I pro-  
pose to send, in due time, a reinforcement  
into the Mediterranean, unless previous in-  
formation shall shew it to be unnecessary.  
  
We continue to receive proofs of the  
growing attachment of our Indian neigh-  
bours, and of their disposition to place all  
their interests under the patronage of the  
United States. These dispositions are in-  
spired by their confidence in our justice,  
and in the sincere concern we feel for their  
welfare. And as long as we discharge these  
high and honourable functions with the  
integrity and

The attempt to explore the Red River,  
under the direction of Mr. Freeman,  
though conducted with a zeal and pru-  
dence meriting entire approbation, has not  
been equally successful. After proceeding  
up it about six hundred miles, nearly as far  
as the French settlements had extended,  
while the country was in their possession,  
our geographers were obliged to return,  
without completing their work. ~  
  
Very useful additions have also been  
  
ade to our knowledge of the Mississippi,  
by Lieutenant Pike, who has ascended it  
to its source, and whose journal and map,  
giving the details of his journey, will  
shortly be ready for communication to  
both Houses of Congress. Those of Messrs.  
Lewis, Clarke, and Freeman, will require  
further time to be digested and prepared.  
These important surveys, in addition to  
those before possessed, furnish materials  
for commencing an accurate map of the  
Mississippi and its western waters. Some  
principal rivers, however, remain still to  
be explored, towards which the authorisa-  
tion of Congress, by moderate appropria-  
tions, will be requisite.  
  
I congratulate you, Fellow Citizens, on  
the approach of the period at which you  
may interpose your authority constitution.  
ally, to withdraw the Citizens of the United  
States from all further participation in those  
Vivlations of human rights, which have  
been so long continued on the unoffending  
inhabitants of Africa, and which the mo-  
rality, the reputation, and the best interests  
of our country, have long been eager to  
proscribe. Although no law you may pass  
can take prohibitory effect tit! the first day  
of the year 1808, yet the intervening period  
is hot too long to prevent, by timely no-  
tice, exveditions which cannot be coim-  
pleted before that day.  
  
The receipts of the Treasury, during the  
year ending on the 20th day of September  
last, have amounted to near fifteen millions  
of dollars; which have enabled us, after  
meeting the current demands, to pay two  
millions seven hundred thousand dollars of  
the American claims, in part of the price  
of Louisiana; to pay, of the funded debt,  
upwards of three millions of principal, and  
nearly four of interest; aud, in addition,  
to reimburse, in the course of the present  
Month, near two millions of five and an  
half per cent. stock. These payments and  
Teimbursements of the funded debt, with  
  
. Foreign Events.  
  
those which had been made in the four  
years and a half preceding, will, at the close  
of the present year, have extinguished up-  
wards of twenty-three millions of prin-  
cipal.  
  
The duties composing the Mediterranean  
fund will cease, by law, at the end of the  
present Session. Considering, however,  
that they are levied chiefly on luxuries,  
and that we have an impost on salt, a ne-  
cessary of life, the free use of which other-  
wise is so important, 1 recommend to your  
consideration the suppression of the duties  
on salt, and the continuation of the Medi-  
terranean fuud, instead thereof, for a short  
time; after which, that also will become  
unnecessary for any purpose now within  
contemplation.  
  
When both of these branches of revenue  
shall, in this way, be relinquished, there  
will still, ere long, be an accumulation of  
monies in the treasury, beyond the instal-

in chief, to assume the Sabine River as a  
temporary line of separation between the  
troops of the two nations, until the issue of  
our negotiations shall be known, this has  
been referred by the S»anish commandant  
to. his superior, and in the mean time he  
has withdrawn his force to the western side  
of the Sabine River. The correspondence  
on this subject, now communicated, will  
exhibit, more particularly, the present state  
of things in that quarter.—The nature of  
that country requires imdispensably that an  
pnusual proportion of the force employed  
there should be cavalry, or mounted infan-  
try. In order, therefore, that the com-  
manding officer might be enabled to act  
with effect, I had authorised him to call  
on the Governors of Orleans and Mississippi,  
for a corps of five handred volunteer caval -  
ry. The temporary arrangements be has  
proposed, may perhaps render this unne-  
cessary, But | inform you, with great  
pleasure, of the promptitade with which  
the inhabitantsof those territories have ten-  
dered their services in defence of their coun -  
try. It hasdooe honear to themselves, en-  
titled them to the confidence of their fcl-  
low-citizeas in every part of the union, and  
must strengthen the general determination  
to protect them efficacioysly, under all cir-  
cumstances which may oceur.—Having re-  
@rived information, that in another part of  
the United States, agreat number of private  
individuals were combining together, arm-  
ing and organising themselves, contrary to  
law, to earry on a military expedition  
egainst the territories of Spain, | thought  
it pecessary, by proclamation, as well as  
by special orders, to take measures for pre-  
venting and suppressing this enterprise, for  
seizing the vessels, arms, and other means  
  
rovided for it, and for arresting and bring-  
ing to justice, its authers and abettors. It  
was due to that good faith which owght ever  
to be the rule of action in public, as well as  
in private transactions; it was due to  
good order, and regular government, that  
while the public force was acting strictly on  
the defensive, and merely to pretect our  
citizens from aggression, the criminal at-  
tempts of privzte individuals, to decide for  
their country the question of peace or war,  
by commencing active and unauthorised  
hostilities, should be promptly and € flica-  
ciously suppressed —whether it will be ne-  
cessary to enlarge our regular force, will  
depend oo the result of our negociations  
with Spsio., But as it is uncertain when  
Ahat result will be known, the provisional  
  
Measures reqaisite for that, aad to meet

be a subject for your early consideration —  
  
The possession of both banks of the Mis.  
sissippi reducing toa single point the defence  
of that river, its waters, and the country  
  
adjacent, it becomes highly Hecessary to pro.  
vide for that point a more adequate security  
Some position above its mouth, command.  
ing in the passage of the river should be  
rendered suificiently strong to cover the  
armed vessels which may be stationed  
there for defence; and, in conjunction  
with them, to present an insuperable o}s:a-  
cle to any force attempting to pass. ‘The  
approaches to the city of New Orlears,  
from the eastera quarter also, will require  
to be examined, and more effectually  
guarded, For the internal support of (\e  
country, the encouragement ef a strong  
settlement on the western side of the Mis-  
sissippi, within reach of New Orleans,  
will be worthy the consideration of the  
Legislature. The gun-boats, authorised  
by an act of the last session, are so advan-  
ced, that they will be ready for service  
in the ensuing Spring. Circumstances per-  
mitted us to allow the time necessary for  
their more solid constuction. As a much  
larger number will still be wanting to place  
our sea-port towns and waters in that state  
of defence to wuich we are competent,  
end they entithed, a similar appropriation  
for a further provision of them is recommend-  
ed for the ensving year. A further appro-  
priation will also be necessary for repairing  
fortifications already established, and the  
eree‘ion of such other works as may have  
real effect in obstructing the approach of an  
enemy to our sea-port towns, or (beir re-  
maining before them. Ina country whose  
constitution is derived from the will of the  
people, directly expressed by their free  
sutfrages ; where the principal executive  
functionaries, and those of the legislature,  
are renewed by them at short periods ; where,  
under the character of jurors, they exercise  
in person the greatest portion.of the judi  
ciary powers, where the laws areconsequent-  
ly so formed and administered as to bear  
with equal weight and favour on all, re-  
straining no man in the pursuits of honest  
industry, and securing to every one =  
property which ‘that aéquires, i ome  
not be supposed that any safeguards cov

on the public peace or authority. The /aws,  
however, aware that these should not be  
trusted to moral&#x27;restraints only, have wisely  
provided punishment for these a  
when committed. But would it not  
  
salutary to give also the means of preventi?é  
their commission? Where an enterpnz

meditated by private individuals against  
a foreign nation, in amity with the United  
States, powers of prevention, to a certain ex-  
tent, are given by the laws. Would they not  
be as reasonable and useful, where the enter-  
prise preparing is against the United States ?  
While adverting to this branch of law, it is  
proper to observe, that in enterprises medi-  
tated against foreign nations, the ordivary  
  
process of binding to the observance of the |  
| addition to those before possessed, furnish  
  
peace and good behaviour, could it be ex-  
tended to acts to be done out of the jurisdic-  
tion of the United States, would be effectual  
ian some cases where the offender is able to  
keep out of sight every indication of his pur-  
pose which could draw on him the exercise  
of the powers now given by law. The  
Stateson the coast of Barbary seem general-  
ly disposed at present to respect peace and  
friendship. With Tunis alone, some uncer-  
tainty remains. Persuaded that it is our in-  
terest to maintain our peace with them on  
equal terms, or not at al], I propose to send,  
in due time, a reinforcement into the Medi-  
terranean, unless previous information shall  
shew-it to be unnecessary.—We continue to  
receive proofs of the growing attachment of  
our Indian neighbours, and of their disposi-  
tion to place all their interests under the pa-  
tronage of the United States. These dispo-  
sitions are inspired by their confidence in our  
justice, and in the sincere concern we feel  
for their welfare. And as long as we dis-  
  
  
  
charge these high and honourable functions |  
with the integrity and good faith which alone |  
  
can entitle us to their continuance, we may  
expect to reap the just reward in their peace  
and friendship.—Theexpedition of Messrs.  
Lewis and Clarke for exploring the River  
Missouri, and the best communications from  
that to the Pacific Ocean, has had all the  
success which could have been expected.  
They have traced the Missouri nearly to its  
source, descended the Columbia to the Paci-  
fic Ocean, ascertained, with accuracy, the  
geography of that interesting communication  
across our continent, learned the “character  
of the country, of its commerce and inhabi-  
tants: and, it is but justice to say, that  
Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and their brave  
companions, have, by this arduous service,  
deserved well of their country.—The attempt  
fo explore the Red River, under the direc-  
  
on of Mr. Freeman, though conducted  
with a geal and prudence mériting entire ap-  
  
probation, has not been. equally successful.

miles, nearly as far as the French settlements  
had extended, while the country was in their  
possession, our geographers were obliged to

Very useful additions have also been made to  
our knowledge of the Mississippi, by Lieut,  
Pike, who has ascended it to its source, and  
whose journal and map, giving the details of  
his journey, will shortly be ready for com-  
munication’ to both Houses of Congress,  
Those of Messrs. Lewis, Clarke, and Free  
man, will require further time to be digested  
and prepared. These important surveys, in  
  
materials for commencing an accurate map  
of the Mississippi and its western waters,  
Some principal rivers, however, remain still  
to be explored, towards which the authorisa-  
tion of Congress, by moderate appropria-  
tions, will be requisite,—I congratulate you,  
Fellow-Citizens, on the approach of the pes  
riod at which you may interpose your autho-  
rity constitutionally, to withdraw the citi-  
zens of the United States from all further  
participation in those violations of human  
rights, which have been so long continued  
on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa,  
and which the morality, the reputation, and  
the best interests of our country, have Jo  
  
been eager to proscribe. Although no law  
you may pass can take prohibitory effect ull  
the first day of the year 1808, yet the inter-  
vening period is not too long to prevent,  
by timely notice, expeditions which cannot  
be completed before that day.—The receipts  
of the Treasury, during the year ending on  
the 30th day of September last, have amount-  
ed to near fifteen niillions of dollars ; which  
have enabled us, after meeting the current  
demands, to pay two millions sever hundred  
thousand dollarsof the American claims, in  
part of the price of Louisiana ; to pay, of the  
funded debt, upwards of three millions of  
principal, and nearly four of interest ; and,  
in addition, to reimburse, in the course of  
the present month, pear two millions of five  
and a half per cent. stock. These payments  
and reimbursements of the funded debt,  
‘with those which had been made in the four  
years and a half preceding, will, at the close  
of the present year, have extinguished up-  
  
‘wards of twenty-three millions of principal.  
  
—The duties composing the Mediterranean  
fund will cease, by law, at the end of the  
present session. Considering however, that  
  
they are levied chiefly on luxuries, and that ©  
  
we have an impost on salt, a necessary of  
life, the free use of which otherwise, is so  
important, I recommend to your considera»  
tion the suppression of the duties on. salt,  
and the contiouation-of the Mediterranean

“« By these operations,” continues the first  
President of the Democratic party, “new  
channels of communication will be opened  
  
  
  
between the States ; the lines of separation  
will disappear, their interests will be iden-  
tified, and their union cemented by new  
and indissoluble ties. Education is here  
placed among the articles of public care;  
not that it would be proposed to take its  
ordinary branches out of the hands of pri-  
vate enterprise, which manages so much  
better all the concerns to which it is equal ;  
but a public institution can alone supply  
those sciences, which, though rarely called  
for, are yet necessary to complete the cir-  
cle, all the parts of which contribute to  
the improvement of the country, and some  
of them to its preservation. I suppose  
an amendment to the Constitution, by con-

•• In a country whore constitution is derived  
from the will of the people, directly expressed  
by their free suffrages; where the priucijml ex­  
ecutive functionaries,and those of the legislature  
are renewed by them at short periods ; where,  
under the character of jurors, they exercise in  
person the greater portion of the judiciary  
pow’ers ; where the laws are so formed and ad­  
ministered as to bear with equal weight and fa­  
vor upon all, restraining no man in the pursuit  
of honest industry, and securing to every one  
the property which that acquires, it would not  
be supposed that any safeguards coivld be  
needed against insurrection or enterprise on the  
public pe.ace or authority. The laws, however,  
aware that these should not be trusted to moral  
restraints only, have wisely provided punish­  
ments for such crimes when committed. But  
would it not be salutary lo give also the means  
of preventing their commission. Where an en­  
terprise is meditated by private individuals  
against a foreign nation in amity with the Uni­  
ted States, powers of prevention are given, to a  
certain extent, by the laws; would they not be  
as reasonable and useful where the enterprise  
is preparing against the United States? While  
adverting to this branch of the law, it is proper  
to observe, that in enterprises meditated against  
foreign nations, ’he ordinary process of binding  
to the observance of the peace and good be­  
haviour, could it be extended to acts done out  
of the jurisdiction of the United Slates, would  
be effectual in some cases where the offender is  
able to keep out of sight every indication of his  
purpose which could draw on him the exercises  
of the powers now given by law.”

sixth annual message in this language— &quot; When  
both of these In anches of revenue shall in this  
way be relinquished, there will still, ere long, b  
an accumulation of the moneys in the treasury,  
beyond the instalments of the public debt which  
we are permitted by contract to pay. The ques­  
tion, therefore, now comes forward, to what other  
objects shall these surplus funds be appropriated ;  
and the whole surplus of imposts after the entire  
discharge of the public debt ; and during the in­  
tervals, when the purposes of war shall not call  
for them ? Shall we suppress the imposts and  
give that advantage to foreign over domestic man­  
ufactures? Their patriotism would certainly pre­  
fer its continuance and application to the great  
purposes of public education, roads , canals , and  
such other objects of public improvement as it  
may be thought proper to aid to the constitutional  
enumeration of federal powers.&quot;

“On a few articles of more general and necessary use, |  
  
the suppression, in due season, will doubtless be right; but  
the great mass of the articles on which impost is paid are  
  
foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who are rich |  
  
enough to afford the nse of them. ‘Their patriotism would

purposes of the public education, roads, rivers, cana’s, and  
such other objects of public improvement as it may be  
proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of Federal  
powers. By these operations new channels of communi-  
cation will be opened between the States ; the lines of sep-  
  
| eration will disappear ; their interests will be identified, and  
  
their union cemented by new and indissoluble ties. Edu-

rarely called for, are yet necessary to complete the circle,  
all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the

is now proposed for the consideration of Congress, because,  
if approved by the time the State Legislatures shall have  
deliberated on this extension of the Federal trusts, and the  
laws shall be passed, and other arrangements made for their  
execution, the necessary funds will be on hand and with-  
out employment. I suppose an amendment to the Consti-

eign nations. We suppose it can be  
justified under the power conferred on Cone  
gress to &quot;regulte commerce with foreign na­  
&quot;tions,&quot; but that is straining construction to  
the utmost. If you sent your watch to a  
watchemaker to be regulated, it would hardly  
warrant him in laying it on an anvil and  
smashing it with a sledge.  
Mr. Jefferson was not content with exer-­  
cising powers which he frankly admitted were  
not given him by the Constitution: he proe  
posed new and sweeping grants of power by  
Constitutional Amendment. Witness the fol­  
lowing extract from his sixth Annual Mes.­  
sage, Dec. 2, 1806:  
When both of these branches of revenue shall in this  
way be relinquished, there will still ere long be an aceu  
mulation of moneys in the treasury beyond the install  
ments of public debt which we are permitted by contract  
to pay. They cannot, then, without a modification  
ssented to by the public creditors, be applied to the ex  
hment of this debt, and the complete liberation  
of our revenues-the most desirable of all objects; nor,  
if our peace continues, will they be wanting for any  
existing purpose. The question, therefore, now  
comes forward; to what other objects shall these sur­  
pluses be appropriated, and the whole surplus of impost,  
atter the entire discharge of the public debt, and during  
those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call  
for them? Shall we suppress the impost and give that  
lvantage to foreign over domestic manufactures? On  
articles of more general and necessary use, the  
suppression in due season will doubtless be right; but  
ass of the articles on which impost is paid are  
forelgn iuxuries, purchased by those only who are rich  
 to afford themselves the use of them. Their  
patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and  
application to the great purposes of the public educa­  
tion, roads, rivers, canals, and such other ohjects of pub-  
lic improvement as it may be thought proper to add to  
the Constitutional enumeration of federal powers. By  
s new channels of communication will be  
I between the States; the lines of separation will  
disappear, their interests will be identifled, and their  
nented by new and indissoluble ties. Educa-­  
ere placed among the articles of public care, not  
that it would be proposed to take its ordinary branches  
the hands of private enterprise, which manages  
so much better all the concerns to which it is equal; but  
a public institution can alone supply those se  
igh rarely called for, are yet necessary to com­  
plete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the

the State Legislatures shall have deliberated on this

pressed ids belief that the patriotism of  
the people would prefer the continu­  
ance of the imports and the application  
of the money “to the great purposes of  
the public education, roads, rivers, and

the distribution of the surplus among  
the states, and a bill for that purpose  
had been introduced by Mr. Calhoun,  
had passed both houses by large major­

Jackson.  
  
Larger surpluses had frequently been  
dealt with wisely by Republican admin­  
istrations, being either applied by the  
executive authorities to the payment of  
the public debt or its accumulation  
having been prevented by Congress  
from lime to time, by the reduction or  
repeal of taxes. These simple remedie

from the will of the people, directly expressed  
by their free suffrages; where the principal ex­  
ecutive functionarfes and those of the Legisla­  
ture are renewed by them at short periods;

acquires, it would not be supposed that any  
safeguards could be needed against insurrection

The laws, however, aware that these should not

amity with the United States, powers of pre­  
vention to a certain extent are given by the  
laws. Would they not be as reasonable and as  
useful where the enterprise preparing is against  
the United States? While adverting to this  
branch of law, it is proper to observe that in en­  
terprises meditated against foreign nations,  
the ordinary process of binding to the observ­  
ance of peace and good behavior, could it be ex­  
tonded to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction  
of the United States, would be effectual in some  
cases where the offender is able to keep out of  
sight every indication of his purpose which  
would draw on him the exercise of the powers  
now given by law.&quot;

ington’s views, he added:  
  
The present consideration of a national establishment for edu-  
cation, particularly, is rendered proper by this circumstance also,  
that if Congress, approving the proposition, shall yet think it more  
eligible to found it on a donation of lands, they have it now in their  
power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to  
produce the necessary income. This foundation would have the  
advantage of being independent in war, which may suspend other  
improvements by requiring for its own purposes the resources des-  
tined for them.
