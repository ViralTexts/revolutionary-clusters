I am pleased with the choice of delegates which were made at your State meeting, and wish the representatives of all the State Societies may appear at the General meeting with as good dispositions  
  
as I persuade myself they will. It gives me pleasure also to hear that so many officers are sent to your Assembly. I am persuaded they will carry with them more liberality of sentiment than is to be found among any other class of citizens.  
The speech of our friend Cobb was noble, worthy of a patriot, &amp; himself, as was the conduct of Gen. Sullivan. But for Gods sake tell me, what is the cause of all these commotions? Do they proceed from licenciousness, British influence disseminated by the Tories, or real grievances which admit of redress? If the latter, why has the remedy been delayed till the public mind had become so much agitated, &amp; why yet postponed? If the former, why are not the powers of government tried at once?

Do write me fully, I beseech you, on these matters; not only with respect to facts, but as to opinions of their tendency &amp; issues.⟩ I am really mortified beyond expression that in the moment of our Acknowledged Independence we should, by our conduct, verify the predictions of our transatlantic foe, &amp; render ourselves ridiculous &amp; contemptible in the eyes of all Europe
