I did myself the pleasure of writing a long letter to you very lately, but am afraid it is taken as I beleive many of yours are, I am unwilling to think you neglect us, tho Mr Ingersolls coming from France without letters from you has given me great uneasyness, he lodged too in the same house with little Ben, and not a line from him, I hope soon however to be made happy with letters from you all— The present you sent me this month two years I receivd a few weeks ago, tis a prize indeed, it came open without direction or letter and has come through three or four hands. I have receiv’d 6 pair of Gloves nine papers of Needles, a Bundle of thread and five papers of pins, I beg if you or Temple remember what was sent you will let me know, the last person to whose care they were given left them at a hair dressers with directions not to send them to me till he was gone, their being all opened makes me suspect I have not all, what I have receiv’d has made me rich I thought them long ago in the Enemies hands, the Prices of every thing here is so much raized, that it takes a fortune to feed a Family in a very plain way, a pair of Gloves 7 dollars one yard of Common Gause 24 dollars, and there never was so much dressing and pleasure going on, old Friends meeting again, the Wigs in high Spirits, and strangers of distincion among us, I have taken the liberty of sending a small list to you by Coll Crenis, Mr Bache has sent Bills to Jonathan Williams for many things for me and the Family, but I have had some other little Wants since that time, the Minister was kind enough to offer me some fine white flannel, and has spared me eight yards I wish to have it in my power to return as good to him, which I beg you will enable me to do. I shall have great pride in wearing any thing you send and shewing it as my Fathers taste I have dined at the Ministers, spent an evening at Mr. Holkers, have lately been several times invited abroad with the General and Mrs Washinton, he allways enquires after you in the most afectionate manner and speaks of you highly we danced at Mr. Powels your Birth day or night I should say in company together and he told me it was the aniversary of his marriage it was just twenty years that night— My Boy and Girl are in health the latter has ten teeth, can dance sing and make faces tho she cannot talk, except the word no, and be done which she makes great use of, she is ben over again except a larger mouth, how happy I should be to see her seated on your knee, she is just such a play thing as Will was when you came home last, I must tell you a little anecdote of him, and ask your opinion if it is not time to teach him a little religion, he had heard a foolish Girl that lived with me say that there was a death watch in the room, and one of the Family would soon die, he had not been long in bed before he came down in his shirt screaming I soon sent him up, and asking him in the morning how he could behave so and what was the matter, he told me he thought death was coming I was so frightned says he that I sweat all over and I jump’d out of Bed and pray’d up to Herculas, I ask’d him what he said, down he went on his knees with uplifted hands, I think I never saw such a picture of devotion, and repeated the lords prayer, now wether tis best to instruct him in a little religion or let him pray a little longer to Herculas, I should be glad to have your oppinion— Mr Duffeilds Family desired when I wrote to remember them to you, the youngest daughter I have introduced this winter to the Assembly she is like the mother, the Ambasador told me he thought her a great acquision to the Asembly, they lodge with us when in Town— I have a peice of American silk which I shall send to you for the Queen it will make me happy if she condecends to wear it, it shall come by the first safe oppertunity, I shewed it to M.

spy Arnold. The following little bit of family  
detail by Mrs. Bache is admirable :—  
  
“ My boy and girl are in health: the latter  
has ten teeth, can dance, sing, and make faces,  
tho’ she cannot talk, except the word no and  
be done, which she makes great use of. She  
is Ben over again, except a larger mouth.  
How happy should I be to see her seated on  
  
our knee! She is just such a plaything as  
‘Will was when you came home last. I must  
tell you a little anecdote of him, and ask if it  
is not time to teach him a little religion. He  
had heard a foolish girl that lived with me  
say that there was a death-watch in the room,  
and one of the family would soon die. He  
had not been long in bed before he came  
down in his shirt, screaming. I soon sent  
him up, and asking him in the morning how  
he could behave so, and what was the matter,  
he told me he thought death was coming. I  
was so frightened, says he, that I sweat all  
over, and I jumped out of bed and prayed up  
to Hercules. I asked him what he said?  
Down he went on his knees with uplifted  
hands (I think I never saw such a picture of  
devotion), and repeated the Lord’s prayer.  
Now whether it is best to instruct him a little  
in religion, or let him pray a little longer to  
Hercules, I should be glad to have your

here are so much raised that it takes a fortune  
to feed a family in a very plain way; a pair of  
glov  
ves ? dollars, one yard of common gause 24  
edars and thare never was so much dresein  
and pleasure going on; old friends meeting  
gain, the Whigs in high spirits, and strangers  
distinction among us.I have taken the  
liberty of sending a small list to you by Col  
a oo  
onel Crenis. Mr. Bache has sent bills to Jon-  
athan Williams for many things for me and  
the family, ut I have had some other little  
wants since that time. The minister was kind  
enough to offer me some fine white flannel, and  
has spared me eight yards. I wish to have it  
eeoe e  
my power to return as good to him, which  
I beg you will enable me to do. I shall have  
great pride in wearing anything you send, and  
sowing it as my tathers taste.  
I have dined at the ministe  
spent an  
ing at Mr. Holker&#x27;s, and have lately been sev­  
eral times invited abroad with the General and  
Mrs. Washington. He always inquires after  
you in the most affectionate manner, and  
speks of you highly We danced at Mrs.  
Powell&#x27;s your birth-day, or night, I should say,  
in company together, and he to&#x27;d me it was the  
anniversary of his marriage; it was just twen­  
ty years that night; my boy and girl are in  
heaith; the latter has ten teeth, can dance,  
sing, and make faces, though she cannot talk  
except the words no and be done, which she  
makes great use of. She is Ben over again,  
except a larger mouth. How happy I should  
be to see her seated on your knee. She is just  
such a plaything as Will was when you came  
home last. I must tell you a little anecdote of  
him, and ask you if it is not time to teach him  
a little religion. He had heard a foolish girl  
that lived with me say that there was a death  
watch in the room, and one of the family would  
soon die. He had not been long in bed before  
he came down in his shirt, screaming. I soon  
sent him up, and asking him in the morning  
how he could behave so, and what was the  
matter, he told me he thought death was com­  
ing. I was so frightened, says he, that I sweat  
all over, and jumped out of bed and prayed up  
to Hercules. I asked him what he said?  
Down he went on his knees, with uplifted  
bands )I think I never saw such a picture of  
devotion, and repeated the Lord&#x27;s prayer.  
Now, whether it is best to instruct him in a  
little religion, or let him pray a little longer to  
Hercules, I should be glad to have your opin­  
ion. Mr. Duffield&#x27;s family desired when I  
wrote to remember them to you; the youngest  
daughter I have introduced this winter to the  
assembly. She is like the mother. The am­  
bassador told me he thought her a great acqui­  
ition to the assembly. They lodge with u  
when in town I have a piece of American  
silk which I shall send to you for the Qieen.  
It will make me happy if she condescends to  
wear it. It shall come by the first safe oppor­  
tunity. I showed it to M. Gerard, whose opin­  
ion was that it would be acceptable. I wish  
much that he had brought his lady with him.  
I should be tempted to learn French if she was  
among us. He is very much beloved here. I  
feel a veneration for him, mixed with so much  
affection, that when he was confined by indis­  
position, I went, uninvited, with Mr. Bache to  
see him. Mr. B. wrote to you this morning,  
My brother was well at New York about a  
week ago. If Col. Crenis does not go away  
early I will write to Temple. This is all the  
paper I have, and it is Sunday. Remember  
me to dear Ben. I long for another little  
French letter.

Puitapecpuia, Fan’y 17,1779.  
Dear &amp; Honovurep Para  
I did myself the pleasure of writing a long letter to  
you very lately, but am afraid it is taken as I believe  
many of yours are. 1 am unwilling to think you ne-  
glect us, tho’ Mr. Ingersoll’s coming from France  
without letters from you has given me great uneasi-  
  
ness, he lodged too in the same house with little Ben, |  
  
and not a line from him. I hope soon however to  
be made happy with letters from you all. the present  
you sent me this month two years I received a few  
weeks ago, tis a prize indeed, it came open without  
direction or letter and has come through three or four  
hands. I have receiv’d 6 pair of Gloves nine papers  
of needles, a Bundle of Thread and five papers of  
pins. I beg of you or Temple remember what was  
sent you will let me know, the last person to whose  
care they were given left them at a hair dressers with  
directions not tosend them to me till he was gone,  
their being all opened makes me suspect I have not  
all, what I have receiv’&#x27;d has made me rich. I  
thought them long agoin the Enemies hand. the  
Prices of every thing here is so much raized, that it  
takes a fortune to feed a Family in a very plain way,  
a pair of Gloves 7 dollars one yard of Common Gause  
24 dollars, and there never was so much dressing and  
pleasure going on, old Friends meeting again, the  
Wigs in high Spirits, and strangers of distinction  
among us. I have taken the liberty of sending a

The next passage gives us an idea of the measures a minis-

popularity of the nation he represents: “The Minister was  
kind enough to offer me some fine white flannel, and has  
spared me eight yards. I wish to have it in my power to re-
