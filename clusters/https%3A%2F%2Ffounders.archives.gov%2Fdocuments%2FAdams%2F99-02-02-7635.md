Monticello June 1. 22.  
  
It is very long, my dear Sir, since I have written to you. my dislocated wrist is now become so stiff that I write slowly and with pain, and therefore write as little as I can. yet it is due to mutual friendship to ask once in a while how we do? the papers tell us that Genl. Starke is off at the age of 93. Charles Thomson still lives at about the same age, chearful, slender as a grasshopper, and so much without memory that he scarcely recognises the members of his household. an intimate friend of his called on him not long since: it was difficult to make him recollect who he was, and, sitting one hour, he told him the same story 4. times, over. is this life?—with lab’ring step to tread our former footsteps? pace the roundEternal?—to beat and beatthe beaten track? to see what we have seenTo taste the tasted? o’er our palates to decantAnother vintage?—it is at most but the life of a cabbage, surely not worth a wish. when all our faculties have left, or are leaving us, one by one, sight, hearing, memory, and every avenue of pleasing sensation is closed, and athumy, debility and mal-aise left in their places, when the friends of our youth are all gone, and a generation is risen around us whom we know not, is death an evil?  
When one by one our ties are torn,When trembling limbs refuse their weightAnd friend from friend is snatched forlornAnd films slow gathering dim the sight,When man is left alone to mourn,When clouds obscure the mental light Oh! then how sweet it is to die!Tis nature’s kindest boon to die!  
I really think so. I have ever dreaded a doting old age; and my health has been generally so good, and is now so good, that I dread it still. the rapid decline of my strength during the last winter has made me hope sometimes that I see land. during summer I enjoy it’s temperature, but I shudder at the approach of winter, and wish I could sleep through it with the Dormouse, and only wake with him in spring, if ever. they say that Starke could walk about his room. I am told you walk well and firmly. I can only reach my garden, and that with sensible fatigue. I ride however daily. but reading is my delight. I should wish never to put pen to paper; and the more because of the treacherous practice some people have of publishing one’s letters without leave. Ld. Mansfield declared it a breach of trust, and punishable at law. I think it should be a penitentiary felony. yet you will have seen that they have drawn me out into the arena of the newspapers. altho’ I know it is too late  for me to buckle on the armour of youth, yet my indignation would not permit me passively to recieve the kick of an Ass.To turn to the news of the day, it seems that the Cannibals of Europe are going to eating one another again. a war between Russia and Turkey is like the battle of the kite and snake. whichever destroys the other, leaves a destroyer the less for the world. this pugnacious humor of mankind seems to be the law of his nature, one of the obstacles to too great multiplication provided in the mechanism of the Universe. the cocks of the henyard kill one another up. boars, bulls, rams do the same. and the horse, in his wild state, kills all the young males, until worn down with age and war, some vigorous youth kills him, and takes to himself the Haram of females. I hope we shall prove how much happier for man the Quaker policy is, and that the life of the feeder is better than that of the fighter: and it is some consolation that the desolation by these Maniacs of one part of the earth is the means of improving it in other parts. let the latter be our office. and let us milk the cow, while the Russian holds her by the horns, and the Turk by the tail. God bless you, and give you health, strength, and good spirits, and as much of life as you think worth having

to you. My dislocated wrist is now become so stiff  
that I write slowly, and with pain; and, therefore,  
write as little as 1 can. Yet it is due to mutual friend-  
ship to ask once in a while how we do? The pa-  
pers tell us that general Starke is off at the age of  
ninety-three—* * * * * still lives, at about the  
same age, cheerful, slender as a grasshopper, and  
so much without memory that he scarcely recog-  
nises the members of his household. An intimate  
friend of his called on him not long since. It was  
difficult to make him recollect who he was, and  
sitting one hour, he told him the same story four  
times over. Is this life?—with laboring step  
  
To tread our former footsteps? pace the round  
  
Bternal?—to beat and beat  
  
The beaten track—to see what we have seen—  
  
To taste the tasted—o’er our palates to decant  
  
Another vintage?  
It is, at most, but the life of a cabbage, surely  
not worth a wish. When all our faculties have  
left, or are leaving us, one by one, sight, hearing,  
memory, every avenue of pleasing sensation is clos-  
ed, and athumy, debility, and mal-aise left in their  
places, when the friends of our youth are all gone,  
and a generation is risen around us whom we know  
not, is death an evil?  
  
When one by one our ties are torn,  
And friend from friend is snatch’d forlorn;  
  
When man is left alone to mourn,  
Oh, then, how sweet it is to die!  
  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight,  
And films slow gathering dim the sight;  
  
When clouds ovseure the mental light,  
*Tis nature&#x27;s kindest boon to die!  
  
Treally thinkso. Ihave ever dreaded a doting  
old age; and my health has been generally so good,  
and is now so good, that 1 dread it still. The ra-  
pid decline of my strength during the last winter  
has made me hope sometimes that I see land.—  
During summer, | enjoy its temperature, but I  
shudder at the approach of winter, and wish I .  
could sleep through it with the dormouse, andonly -  
wake with him in spring, if ever.—They say that ©  
Starke could waik about his room. |  
walk well and firmly. I can only reach my garden, -.  
and that with sensible fatigue. :  
daily, but reading is my delight. I should wish  
never to put pen to paper; and the more because  
of the treacherous practice some people have of  
publishing one’s letters without leave. Lord Mans-  
field declared it a breach of trust, and punishable  
at law. Ithink it should bea penitentiary felony;  
yet you willhave seen that they have drawn me  
out into the arena of the newspapers. Although  
I know it is too late for meto buckle on the ar-  
mour of youth, yet my indignation would not pers  
mit me passively to receive the kick of an ass,  
  
To turn to the news of the day, it seems that  
the cannibals of Europe are going to eating one  
another again. A war between Russia and Turkey  
is like the battle of the kite and snake; which ever  
destroys the other, leaves a destroyer the less for  
the world. This pugnacious humor of mankind  
seems to be the law of his nature, one of the ob-  
stacles to too great multiplication provided in the  
mechanism of the universe. The cocks of the hen  
yard kili one another; bears, bulls, rams, do the  
same, and the horse, in his wild state, kills all the  
young males, until, worn down with age and war,  
some vigorous youth killshim. * * * * * [hope we  
shall prove how much happier for man the Quaker  
policy is, and that the life of the feeder-is better  
than that of the fighter: and it is some consolation  
that the desolation by these maniacs of one part of  
the earth, is the means of improving it in other

When man is loft alone to mourn,  
  
Oh, then, how sweet it is to die !  
  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight ;  
  
And films slow gathering dim the sight ;  
  
When clouds obscure the mental light,  
  
•Tis nature’s kindest boon to die!  
  
J really think so. 1 have ever dreaded a doting  
old age; and my health has been generally so  
good, and is now so good, that I dread it still. The  
rapid decline of my strength during the last win-  
ter has made me hope sometimes that I see land.  
During summer, I enjoy its temperature, but I  
shudder at the approach of winter, and wish I  
could sleep through it with the dormouse, and on-  
ly wake with him in the spring, if ever. — They  
say that Starke could walk about bis room. 1 am  
told you walk well and firmly. I can only reach  
my garden, and that with sensible fatigue. I ride,  
however, daily, but reading is my delight. I should  
wish never to put pen to paper; and the more be-  
cause of the treacherous practice some people  
have of publishing one’s letters without leave. —  
Lord Mansfield declared it a breach of trust, and  
punishable at law. I think it should be peniten-  
tiary felony; yet you will have seen that they have  
drawn me out into the arena of the newspapers.  
Although I know it is too late for me to buckle on  
the armour of youth, yet my indignation would  
not peimit me positively to receive the kick of an  
ass.  
  
To turn to the news of the day, it seems that the  
cannibals of Europe are going to eating one anoth-  
er again. A war between Russia and Turkey is  
&#x27;like the battle of the kite and snake; which ever  
destroys the other, leaves a destroyer the less for  
the world. This pugnacious humor of mankind  
seems to be the law of his nature, one of the ob-  
stacles to too great multiplication provided in the  
mechanism of the universe. The cocks of the  
hen yard kill one another; bears, bulls, rams, do  
the same, and the horse, in his wild state, kills all  
the young males,&#x27; until, worn down with age and  
war, some vigorous youth kills him. **** 1 hope we  
shall prove how much happier for man the Qua-  
ker policy is, and that the life of the feeder is  
better than that of the fightier; and it is some con-  
solation that the dissolution of these maniacs of  
one part of the earth, is the means of improving  
it in other partsi Let the latter be our office; and  
let us milk the cow, while the Russian holds her  
by the horns and the Turk by the tail — God bless  
you and give you health, strength, good spirits, and  
ns much of life as you think worth having.

Montecello, June, 1, 1822.  
It is very long, my dear sir, since I have  
written to you. My dislocated wrist is now  
become so stiff that I write slowly, and with  
pain; and therefore I write as little as I can.  
Yet it is due to mutual friendship, to ask  
once in a while how we do? The paper tells  
us that Gena Starke is off at the age of nine-  
three. still lives at about the same  
age cheerful, slender as a grasshopper, and  
so much without memory, that he scarcely re­  
cognized the members of his household. An  
intimate friend of his called on him, not long  
since. It was difficult to make him recollect  
who he was, and sitting one hour, he told the  
same story four times over. Is this life?  
with laboring step.  
&quot;To tread our former footsteps? pace the round  
Eternal?--to beat and beat  
The beaten track--to see what we have seen  
To taste the tasted--o&#x27;er plants to decant  
Another vintage?&quot;  
&quot;It is at most but the life of a cabbage,  
surely not worth a wish. When our facul­  
ties have left or are leaving us, one by one,  
hearing, memory, every avenue of pleasing  
sensation is closed anathumy, debillty, and  
mal-aise, left in their places, when the friends  
of our youth are all gone, and a generation,  
is arisen around us whom we know not, is  
death an evil?  
When one by one our ties are torn

&quot;To return to the news

A war between Russia and Turkey is like

mankind seems to be the law of his nature;

young males, until, worn down with age and  
war, some vigorous youth kills him.  
I hope we shall prove how much happier for  
man the Quater policy is, and that the life of  
the feeder is better than that of the fighter.  
And it is some consolation that the desola­

It is very long, my dear sir, since I have  
written to you. My dislocated wrist is now  
become so stiff, that I write slow and with  
pain; and, therefore, write as little as I can.  
Yet it is due to mutual friendship to ask once  
in a while how we do, The papers tell, that  
Gen. Starks is off at the age of ninety-three,  
—* * * * still lives, at about the same age,  
cheerfal, slender as a grass-hopper, and so  
much without memory, that he scarcely rec-  
ognizes the members of his household. An  
intimate friend of his called on him not long  
since; it was difficult to make him recollect  
who he was; and sitting ono hour, he told him  
the same story four times over.

too late fur me to buckle on the armor of

Monticello, June Ist, 1822.  
It is very long, my dear sir, since I  
have written to you My dislocated wrist  
is now become so still&#x27;that I write slow  
ly ami with pain, and therefore write as  
little as I can. Yet it is due to mutual  
friendship to ask once in a while how  
you do. The papers tell us that Gen  
Staike is offal the age of ninety three  
A still lives, at about the same nge,  
cheerful, slender as a grasshopper, and  
so much without memory that he scarce­  
ly recognizes bis own household. Inti­  
mate friends of his called on him not  
long since. It was difficult to make him  
understand or recollect who he was, and  
sitting one hour he told him the same  
story four limes over Is this life? with  
laboiing steps—■  
To tread our former footstep*? pave the round  
The tieaten track—to see what  
To ta.-tc the tasted—o&#x27;er our palets descant  
Another vintage  
It is but most the life of a cabbage,  
stirelt no: worth a wish. When all our  
faculties have left, or are leaving It* one  
&#x27; bv one, sight, hearing, memory , every  
avenue of pleasing sensation, is -losed,  
and . debility and mil aise left ill  
their places, when the friend* of then  
youth are nil gone, and a generation is  
risen around us whom we know not, is  
death an evil ?  
I really think so. I have ever dreaded  
a doting old age, and ray health has been  
generally so good that 1 dread it still.  
The rapid decline of my strength during  
the last winter has made me hope some­  
times that I see land During summer I  
enjoy its temperature, but I shudder at  
the approach of winter and wish I could  
sleep through it with the dormouse, nnd  
only wake with &#x27;lira, if ever. They say  
that Starke could walk about his room.  
Icm told you walk Well and firmly. I  
can only reach my garden, and that, with  
sensible fatigue. 1 ride, however, daily ;  
but reading is my delight. I should wish  
never to put my pi n to paper, ami the  
more because of the treacherous practice  
some people have of publishing ones let­  
teis without leave. Lord Mansfield de­  
clared it a breach of trust and punishable  
nt law 1 think it should be a peniten­  
tiary felony ; yet you will have seen that  
they have drawn me out into the arena  
lof the newspapers Although 1 know it  
is too late for me to buckle on th* armor  
of youth, yet my indignation would not  
permit me passively to receive the kick  
of an ass.  
To turn to the news of the day, it  
sc*lds that the cannibals of Europe are  
going to eating one another again A  
war between Russia ami Turkey is like  
the battle of the kite and snake; which­  
evi r destrot s the other leaves a destroyer  
tlie 1 ss for the world. This pugnacious  
humor of mankind seems to be the law  
of his nature—oue of the obstacles to  
too great multiplication provided in the  
mechanism of the universe. The cocks  
of the lieu yard kill one another; bears,  
bulls, rams, do the same ; sud the horse,  
iu Din wild state, kills all tlieyoung males  
until, worn out with age and war, some  
vigorous youth kills him I hope we  
shall prove how much happier fur man  
the Quaker policy is, and that the life of  
the feeder is better tl.su that of the  
fighter; ami it is some consolation that  
the desolation ot these maniacs of oue  
part of the earth is the mean* of im­  
proving the other parts. Let the latter  
lie our office, and let us milk the cow  
while the Russians hold her by the horns  
and the Turks by the tail, God bless  
you ami give you strength, nnd u* much
