Sir,  
						Paris 5 April 1808.  
					  
					I received the dispatches you did me the honor to address to me by M. Lewis on the 26 Ulto.  
					Though I had complained often and earnestly of both the principles and operation of the Emperor’s decrees of Nov. 1806 and December 1807 (having written at least twenty notes on the different cases which have arisen under them) yet as the Presidents orders

strance against those decrees, I  
did not lose a moment in writing  
and presenting the inclosed note ;  
the terms of which will, I hope,  
appear to be such as were proper

culated either to obtain a recall  
of the illegal measures, or to  
leave in full force the rights ac-.  
cruing to the United States from  
a failure on the part of France to  
recall them. To this note I have  
not yet received an answer, nor  
have I reason to expect one soon,  
as the emperor has left Paris (it  
is said for Spain) and had, at no  
time before he set out, indicated  
any alteration in the views which  
originally produced the decrees  
in question.  
  
Mr. Pinkney found means (in  
the return to the continent of M.  
d’Alopeus) to communicate the  
president’s views on the subject  
of the general embargo, and par-  
ticularly the desire he had, that  
it should not be considered as a  
measure of hostility against any  
foreign nation. Some explana-

necessary in England, where,  
  
from the misrepresentations of  
our own people, the character of

the policy was likely to be misun-  
derstood; but as neither the
