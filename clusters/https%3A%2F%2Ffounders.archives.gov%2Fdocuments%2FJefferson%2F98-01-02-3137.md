Dear Sir  
Monticello  
Nov. 2. 22  
Your favor of Oct. 18. came to hand yesterday. the atmosphere of our country is unquestionably charged with a threatening cloud of fanaticism, lighter in some parts, denser in others, but too heavy in all. I had no idea however that in Pensylvania, the cradle of toleration and freedom of religion, it could have arisen to  the height you describe. this must be owing to the growth of presbyterianism the blasphemy and absurdity of the five points of Calvin, and the impossibility of defending them render their advocates impatient of reasoning, irritable &amp; prone to denunciation. in Boston however and it’s neighborhood, unitarianism has advanced to so great strength as now to humble this haughtiest of all religious sects; insomuch that they condescend to interchange with them and the other sects the civilities of preaching freely &amp; frequently in each other’s meeting houses. in Rhode island on the other hand, no sectarian preacher will permit an Unitarian to pollute his desk. in our Richmond there is much fanaticism, but chiefly among the women: they have their night meetings, and praying-parties, where attended by their priests, and sometimes a hen-pecked husband, they pour forth the effusions of their love to Jesus in terms as amatory and carnal as their modesty would permit them to use to a more earthly lover. in our village of Charlottesville there is a good degree of religion with a small spice only of fanatacism. we have four sects, but without either church or meeting house. the Court house is the common temple, one Sunday in the month to each. here episcopalian and presbyterian, methodist and baptist meet together, join in hymning their maker, listen with attention and devotion to each others preachers, and all mix in society with perfect harmony. it is not so in the districts where presbyterianism prevails undividedly. their ambition and tyranny would tolerate no rival if they had power. systematical in grasping at an ascendancy over all other sects, they aim like the Jesuits at engrossing the education of the country are hostile to every institution which they do not direct, and jealous at seeing others begin to attend at all to that object. the diffusion of instruction to which there is now so growing an attention, will be the remote remedy to this fever of fanaticism, while the more proximate one will be the progress of Unitarianism, that this will ere long be the religion of the majority from North to South, I have no doubt. In our University you know there is no professorship of divinity. a handle has been made of this to disseminate an idea that this is an institution, not merely of no religion, but against all religion. occasion was taken at the last meeting of the Visitors, to bring forward an idea which might silence this calumny, which weighed on the minds of some honest friends to the institution. in our annual report to the legislature, after stating the constitutional reasons against a public establishment of any religious instruction, we suggest the expedient of encouraging the different religious sects to establish each for itself, a professorship of their own tenets, on the confines of the University, so near as that their students may attend the lectures there, and have the free use of our library, and every other accomodation we can give them; preserving  however their independance of us &amp; of each other. this fills the chasm objected to ours, as a defect in an instution professing to give instruction in all useful sciences. I think the invitation will be accepted by some sects from candid intentions, and by others from jealousy and rivalship. and by bringing the sects together, and mixing them with the mass of other students, we shall soften their asperities, liberalise and neutralise their prejudices, and make the general religion a religion of peace, reason and morality.The time of opening our University is still as uncertain as ever. all the Pavilions, boarding houses and dormitories are done. nothing is now wanting but the central building for a library and other general purposes. for this we have no funds, and the last legislature refused all aid. we have better hopes of the next. but all is uncertain. I have heard with regret of disturbances on the part of the Students in your seminary. the article of discipline is the most difficult in American education. premature ideas of independance, too little repressed by parents, beget a spirit of insubordination, which is the great obstacle to science with us, and a principal cause of it’s decay since the revolution. I look to it with dismay in our institution, as a breaker ahead which I am far from being confident we shall be able to weather. the advance of age, and the tardy pace of the public patronage may probably spare me the pain of witnessing consequences.I salute you with constant friendship and respect.Th: Jefferson

Monticeli.o, November 2, 1822.  
Dear Sir:—Your favor of October 18th cmne to  
hand yesterday. The atmosphere of our country is  
unquestionably charged with a threatning cloud of  
fanaticism, lighter in some parts, denser in others,  
but too heavy in all. 1 had no idea, however, that  
in Pennsylvania, the cradle of toleration and free­  
dom of religion, it could have arisen to the height  
you describe. This must he owing to the growth of  
Presbyterianism. The blasphemy and absurdity of  
the five points of Calvin, and the impossibility of  
defending them, render their advocates impatient of  
reasoning, irritable, and prone lo denunciation. In  
Boston, however, and its neighborhood, Unitarian­  
ism has advanced to so great a strength, ns now to  
humble this haughtiest of all religious sects; insomuch  
that they condescend to interchange with them and  
the other sects, the civilities of preaching freely and  
frequently in each others’ meeting houses. In Rhode  
Island, on the other hand, no sectarian preacher will  
permit an Unitarian to pollute his desk. In our  
Richmond there is much fanaticism, hut chiefly n­  
inong the women. They have their night meetings  
and praying parties,where, attended by their priests,  
and sometimes by a hen-pecked husband, they pore  
forth the effusions of their love to Jesus, in terms as  
umitcry and carnal, ns their modesty would permit  
them to use to a mere earthly lover. In our village  
of Charlottsville, there is a good degree of religion,  
with a small spice only of fanaticism. We have  
four sects, hut without either chinch or meeting  
house. The court house is the common temple, one  
Sunday in the month to each. Here, Episcopalian  
and Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist, meet to­  
gether, join in hymning their Maker, listen with nt­  
attention and devotion to each others’ preachers,  
aud all mix in society with perfect harmony. It is  
not so in the district where Presbyterianism prevails  
undividedly. Their ambition and tyranny would tole­  
rate no rival if they had power. Systematical in  
grasping at an ascendency over all other sects, they  
aim, like the Jesuits, at engrossing the education  
of the country, are hostile to every institution which  
they do not direct, and jealous at seeing others begin  
to attend at all to thut object. The diffusion of in- j  
struction, to which there is now so growing an at­  
tention, will be the remote remedy to this fever of  
fanaticism; while the more proximate one will he  
the progress of Unitarianism. That this will, ere  
long, he the religion of the majority from north to  
south, I have no doubt.  
In our University you know there is no professor­  
ship of Divinity. A handle has been made of this,  
to disseminate an idea that this is an institution, not  
merely of no religion, but against all religion. Oc­  
casion was taken at the last meeting of the Visitors,  
to bring forward an idea that might silence this ca­  
lumny. which weighed on the minds of some honest  
friends to the institution. In our annual report to  
the legislature, after seating the constitutional rea­  
sons against a public establishment of any religious  
institution, we suggest the expediency of encourag­  
ing the different religious sects to establish, each for  
itself, a professorship of their own tenets, on the con­  
fines of the University. So near as that their stu­  
dents may attend the lectures there, and have the  
free use of our library and every other accommoda­  
tion we can give them; preserving, however, their  
independence of us and of each other. This fills j  
the chasm objected to ours, as a defect in an institu- i  
tion professing to give instruction to all useful sci- !  
ences. I think the invitation will be accepted, by  
some sects from candid intentions, and by others  
from jealousy and rivnlship. And by bringing the  
sects together, and mixing them with the mass of  
other students, we shall soften their asperities, liber­  
alise, and nulralisc their prejudices, and make the  
general religion, a religion of peace, reason and  
morality.  
The time of opening our University is still as un­  
certain as ever. All the pavilions, boarding houses  
and dormitories are done. Nothing is now wanting  
but the central building for a library and other gene­  
ral purposes. For this wo have no funds, and the ,  
last legislature refused all aid. We have better  
hopes of the next But all is uncerain. I have heard  
with regret of disturbances on the part of the stu­  
dents in your seminary. The article of discipline is  
the most difficult in American education. Prema­  
ture ideas of independence, too little repressed by  
parents, beget a spirit of insubordination, which is  
the great obstacle to science with us, and a principal  
cause of its decay since tiie Revolution. I look to it  
with dismay in our institution, as a breaker nhend,  
which I am far from being confident we shall be  
able to weather. The advance of age, and the tardy  
pace of the public patronage, may probably spare mo  
the pain of witnessing consequences. I salute you  
with constant friendship and respect.

Hence his joy at the triumphs of the  
young Boston preacher, whose bold-  
ness and fervor, he heard, were setting  
free so many human minds from the  
iron bondage of the past. “In our  
village of Charlottesville there is a  
good degree of religion with a small  
spice only of fanaticism. We have  
four sects, but without either church or  
meeting-house. The court-house is the  
common temple, one Sunday in the  
month to each. Here Episcopalian  
and Presbyterian, Methodist and Bap-  
tist, meet together, join in hymning  
their Maker, listen with attention and  
devotion to each other’s preachers, and  
all mix in society with perfect harmo-  
ny.” The final and complete remedy,  
he thought, for the “fever of fanati-  
cism” was the diffusion of knowledge ;  
and again he indulges his sanguine hu-  
mor by predicting that “ Unitarianism  
will, erelong, be the religion of the ma-  
jority from north to south.”

their views of the Christian religion, it is  
due to the latter to insert ihe following  
from a letter to Dr. Cooper written No­  
vember 2d, 1822: &quot;In our University  
you know there is no professorship of di­  
vinity. A handle has been made of this,  
to disseminate an idea that this is an in­  
stitution, not merely of no religion but  
against all religion. Occasion was taken  
at the last meeting of the Visitors, tc  
bring forward an idea that might silenct  
this calumny, which weighed on th&lt;  
minds of some honest friends of the insti  
tntion. In our annual report to the Leg  
islature, after stating the constitutiona  
reasons against a public establishment o  
any religious instruction, we suggest th&lt;  
expediency ot encouraging the different  
religious sects to establish, each for itself  
a professorship of their own tenets, or  
the confines of the University, so near ai  
that their students may attend the lec  
tures there, and have the free use of oui  
library, and every other accommodatior  
we can give them; preserving their in  
dependence of us, and of each other. Thii  
* fills the chasm objected to ours, as a de  
feet in an institution professing to givi  
instruction in all useful sciences. I thin I  
the invitation will be accepted, by som  
sects from candid intentions, and b;  
  
others from jealousy and rivalship. And  
by bringing the sects together, aud mix  
ing them with the mass ot other students,  
we shall soften their asperities, liberalize  
and neutralize their prejudices, aud make  
the geueral religion, a religion of peace,  
reason, and morality.’

this university it was provided that no religious creed  
should be taught. And it is the most curious com-  
mentary on Jeffersonianism, that for about ten years  
the only two professors were Father Richard, a Jesuit  
priest, and Rev. John Monteith, a Presbyterian clergy-  
man. The charter of the Virginia University followed  
in 1822. Jefferson wrote to Dr. Cooper: ‘In our  
University, you know, there is no professorship of  
divinity. A handle has been made of this to dissemi-  
nate an idea that this is an institution not merely of  
no religion, but against all religion. Occasion was
