lative to the navigation of the Missisipi, and which perhaps may be extended to other interests, rendering it necessary that the subjects to be treated of should be developed, and the conditions of arrangement explained, the Secretary of state Reports to the President of the United States the following Observations on the subjects of negociation between the U.S. of America and the court of Spain, to be communicated by way of instruction to the Commissioners of the U.S. appointed as before-mentioned to manage that negociation.  
These subjects are  
  
I. Boundary.  
II. The Navigation of the Missisipi.  
III. Commerce.  
  
I. As to Boundary, that between Georgia and Florida, is the only one which will need any explanation.—Spain sets up a claim to possessions within the state of Georgia, founded on her having rescued them by force from the British, during the late war. The following view of that subject seems to admit no reply.  
The several states, now composing the U.S. of America, were, from their first establishment, separate and distinct societies, dependant on no other society of men whatever. They continued at the head of their respective governments the executive magistrate who presided over the one they had left, and thereby secured in effect a constant amity with that nation. In this stage of their government, their several boundaries were fixed, and particularly the Southern boundary of Georgia, the only one now in question, was established at the 31st. degree of latitude from the Apalachicola Westwardly;

 The U.S. too have irrevocably put it out of their power to do it by a new constitution, which guarantees every state against the invasion of it’s territory. A disastrous war indeed might, by necessity, supercede this stipulation, (as necessity is above all law) and oblige them to abandon a part of a state. But nothing short of this can justify, or obtain such an abandonment.’  
The Southern limits of Georgia depend chiefly on  
  
1. the Charter of Carolina to the Lords proprietors in 1663. extending Southwardly to the river Matheo, now called St. John’s, supposed in the charter to be in Lat. 31° and so West in a direct line as far as the South Sea. See the charter in 4. Memoires de l’Amerique. 554.

Qu. if it was on that occasion that the Southern boundary of Carolina was transferred from the latitude of Matheo or St. John’s river, further North to the St. Mary’s? or was it the Proclamation of 1763. which first removed this boundary?

I was answered that it was a fixed principle to abide by the limits established by the treaty between the English and the Americans: that his remark related only to mere unimportant details, which he wished to recieve from the Spanish Commandants, which would be amicably regulated, and would by no means oppose the general principle. I asked him before the Ambassador of France [M. de Montmorin] whether he would give me his word of honor for it? He assured me he would, and that I might engage it to the U.S.’ See the report sent herewith.  
II. The Navigation of the Missisipi.  
Our right to navigate that river, from it’s source to where our Southern boundary strikes it, is not questioned. It is from that point  downwards only, that the exclusive navigation is claimed by Spain; that is to say, where she holds the country on both sides, to wit, Louisiana on the West, and Florida on the East.  
Our right to participate in the navigation of that part of the river also, is to be considered under

 the treaty of 1782. that common right was confirmed to them by the only power who could pretend claims against them founded on the state of war. Nor has that common right been transferred to Spain by either conquest or cession.  
But our right is built on ground still broader, and more unquestionable, to wit,  
3. on the law of Nature and Nations.  
If we appeal to this, as we feel it written in the heart of man, what sentiment is written in deeper characters, than that the Ocean is free to all men, and the Rivers to all their inhabitants? Is there a man, savage or civilized, unbiassed by habit, who does not feel and attest this truth? Accordingly, in all tracts of country united  under the same political society, we find this natural right universally acknoleged and protected, by laying the navigable rivers open to all their inhabitants. When their rivers enter the limits of another society, if the right of the upper inhabitants to descend the stream is in any case obstructed, it is an act of force by a stronger society against a weaker, condemned by the judgment of mankind. The late case of Antwerp and the Scheld was a striking proof of a general union of sentiment on this point: as it is believed that Amsterdam had scarcely an advocate out of Holland. And even there it’s pretensions were advocated on the ground of treaties, and not of natural right. The Commissioners would do well to examine thoroughly what was written on this occasion. The Commissioners will be able perhaps to find either in the practice or the pretensions of Spain as to the Douro, Tagus and Guadiana, some acknolegements of this principle on the part of that nation.—This sentiment of right in favor of the upper inhabitants must become stronger in the proportion which their extent of country bears to the lower. The U.S. hold 600,000 square miles of habitable territory on the Missisipi and it’s branches; and this river and it’s branches affords many thousands of miles of navigable waters, penetrating this territory in all it’s parts. The inhabitable grounds of Spain below our boundary, and bordering on the river, which alone can pretend any fear of being incommoded by our use of the river, are not the thousandth part of that extent. This vast portion of the territory of the U.S. has no other outlet for it’s productions, and these productions are of the bulkiest kind. And in truth their passage down the river, may not only be innocent as to the Spanish subjects on the river, but cannot fail to enrich them far beyond their present condition. The real interests then of all the inhabitants, upper and lower, concur in fact with their rights.  
If we appeal to the law of nature and nations, as expressed by writers on the subject, it is agreed by them that, were the river, where it passes between Florida and Louisiana, the exclusive right of Spain, still an innocent passage along it is a natural right in those inhabiting it’s borders above. It would indeed be what those writers call an imperfect right, because the modification of it’s exercise depends in considerable degree on the conveniency of the nation thro’ which they are to pass. But it is still a right as real as any other right however well defined: and were it to be refused, or to be so shackled by regulations not necessary for the peace or safety of it’s inhabitants, as to render it’s use impracticable to us, it would then be an injury, of which we should be entitled to demand redress. The right of the upper inhabitants to use this navigation is the counterpart to that of those possessing the shores below, and founded in the same natural relations with the soil  and water, and the line at which their rights meet is to be advanced or withdrawn, so as to equalize the inconveniencies resulting to each party from the exercise of the right by the other. This estimate is to be fairly made, with a mutual disposition to make equal sacrifices, and the numbers on each side are to have their due weight in the estimate. Spain holds so very small a tract of habitable land on eith

 the navigation of the river be free to both, on the footing on which it was defined by the treaty of Paris, viz. thro’ it’s whole breadth. The channel of the Missisipi is remarkeably winding, crossing and recrossing perpetually from one side to the other of the general bed of the river.

 and the Spaniards.  
It is a principle that the right to a thing gives a right to the means without which it could not be used: that is to say, that the means follow their end. Thus a right to navigate a river, draws to it a right to moor vessels to it’s shores, to land on them in cases of distress, or for other necessary purposes &amp;c. This principle is founded in natural reason, is evidenced by the common sense of mankind, and declared by the writers before quoted

 declared also that the right to the use of the shores was incident to that of the water. Ib. §.1. 3. 4. 5. The laws of every country probably do  the same.

o belong immediately to Spain. Had not the use of the shores been considered as incident to that of the water, it would have been expressly stipulated; since it’s necessity was too obvious to have escaped either party. Accordingly all British subjects used the shores habitually for the purposes necessary to the navigation of the river: and when a Spanish governor undertook, at one time, to forbid this, and even cut loose the vessels fastening to the shores, a British frigate went immediately, moored itself to the shore opposite the town of New Orleans, and set out guards with orders to fire on such as might attempt to disturb her moorings. The Governor acquiesced; the right was constantly exercised afterwards, and no interruption ever offered.  
This incidental right extends even beyond the shores when circumstances render it necessary to the exercise of the principal right, as in the case of a vessel damaged, where the mere shore would not be a safe deposit for her ca

e.  
It will probably be urged, because it was urged on the former occasion, that if Spain grants to us the right of navigating the Missisipi, other nations will become entitled to it, by virtue of treaties giving them the rights of the most favored nation.  
Two answers may be given to this. 1. When those treaties were made, no nations could be under contemplation but those then existing, or those, at most, who might exist under similar circumstances. America did not then exist as a nation: and the circumstances of her position and commerce are so totally dissimilar to every thing then known, that the treaties of that day were not adapted to any such being.

States. On this point, the said secretary of state, in his report aforesaid,  
expresses himself as follows, to wit: “As to boundary, that between  
Georgia and West Florida is the only one which needs any explanation. It  
(that is, the court of Spain) sets up a claim to possessions within the state  
of Georgia, founded on her (Spain) having rescued them by force from the  
British during the late war. The following view of that subject seems to  
admit of no reply. The several states now composing the United [*112  
*States of America were, from their first establishment, separate and  
distinct societies, dependent on no other society of men whatever. They  
continued at the head of their respective governments, the executive magis-  
trate who presided over the one they had left, and thereby secured in effect  
a constant amity with the nation. In this stage of their government, their  
several boundaries were fixed, and particularly the southern boundary of  
Georgia, the only one now in question, was established at the thirty-first  
degree of latitude, from the Apalachicola westwardly. The southern limits  
of Georgia depend chiefly on, first, the charter of South Carolina, &amp;c.;  
secondly, on the proclamation of the British king, in 1763, establishing the  
boundary between Georgia and Florida, to begin on the Mississippi, in  
thirty-one degrees of north latitude, and running eastwardly to the Apala-  
chicola, &amp;e. That afterwards, on the 7th day of December, of the same

To the Marquis de la Fayette.”  
  
In a letter of the same date, the Marquis de la Fayette says, “ On  
receiving the answer of Count Florida Blanca, I desired an explana-  
tion respecting the addition that relates to the limits. I was answered,  
that it was a fixed principle to abide by the limits established by the  
treaty between the English and Americans: That his remark only re-  
lated to more unimportant details, which he wished to receive from the  
Spanish commandants, that would be amicably arranged, and woula  
by no means oppose the general principle. I asked him, before the  
ambassador of France, (Mr. Montmorin,) whether he would give me  
his word of honour for it? He assured me he would, and that I  
might engage it to the United States.

right to the meant), without whicn it could not beused?  
that is to say, lhat the tneaus follows lbs end. Thus, a  
right to navigate a river draws to it a right lo uiovc ves­  
sels to its shore*, to land on them in case of distress, or  
(or other necessary purposes, &amp;c. This principle Wat  
founded in natural reason, was evidenced by ihe common

quoted.

Mr. Wheaton is entirely explicit oti tuts point:*  
&quot; Hid not the use of the shores been considered as in­  
cident lo that of Ihe water, it would have been expressly  
stipulated, since its uncertainty was loo obvious to have  
escaped either parlv. Accordingly, all British vessels  
used the shores habitually for the purposes necessary to  
the navigation of the river; and when a Spanish gov­  
ernor undertook at one time to forbid this, and even cut  
loose the vessels fastened to tbe short*, a British vessel  
went immediately, moored iter If opposite (be town of  
New Orleans, ana set nut guaid*, with orders t&lt;&gt; fire on  
sucb as might attempt to disturb her moorings The gov­  
ernor acquisroed; the right was constantly exercised af­  
terwards, aud no interruption ever offered.&quot;  
I now tiuote from the distinguished statesman to whose  
opinion* I have referred. This expression of them is so  
recent as November ttid. He sayi:  
&quot; The questions of public law involved in the issue  
are plain oner, and the rights of the nalions at the sources  
of Ihe great rivers are us well settled as the riparia
