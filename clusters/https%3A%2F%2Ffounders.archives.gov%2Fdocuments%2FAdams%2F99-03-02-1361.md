Our papers announce to us that the articles of impeachment against Judge Chase are preparing before the House. One paragraph of the account is mysterious to me. I have not the paper at hand but it was of this import, that while the majority were imperious and oppressive, the minority with the exception of W. Elliot a convert from democracy looked on, with a sullen and disdainful silence.—What can this mean?
