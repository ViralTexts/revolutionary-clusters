Article declares that “Canada, acceding to this Confederation, and joining in the Measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this Union: but no other Colony shall be admitted into the same, unless such Admission be agreed to by nine States.” This Article holds out an immediate Offer to Canada; and the words  no other Colony plainly relate to the other British Colonys of Nova Scotia, and East and West Floridas, and clearly exclude the Idea of any absolute Power in Congress to erect new States. I had almost forgot to mention the Beginning of the 13th. Article, declaring that “Every State shall abide by the Determinations of the United States in Congress assembled, on all Questions which by this Confederation are submitted to them.” From whence arises, by the strongest Implication, a negation and Disclaimer of any other powers, and a Declaration that no State is bound by them if they shou’d at any time be assumed. I shou’d not have troubled You with these Quotations, but that I apprehended in the late Confusions and sudden removals of public, as well as private Papers, the Articles of

In one respect this last constitution  
was a violation of the agreement en­  
tered into by the States, for Article  
13 of the second confederation, agreed  
upon in 1777, reads as follows:  
s And the Articles of this con-

them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a  
congress of the united states, and be afterwards

confederacy, we have two colonial  
unions and two independent States

combinations of 1698 and 1754, and at  
least three of these were declared to  
be &quot;perpetual. The New England  
union, in 1643, was called &quot;a perpet­

as we have seen. That of 1778, or, if
