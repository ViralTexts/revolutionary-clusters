Dear Sir  
Monticello Sep. 5. 99.  
  
Your’s of Aug. 30. 99. came duly to hand. it was with great regret we gave up the hope of seeing you here, but could not but consider the obstacle as legitimate. I had written to mr M. as I had before informed you, and had stated to him some general ideas for consideration &amp; consultation when we should meet. I thought something essentially necessary to be said in order to avoid the inference of acquiescence. that a resolution or declaration should be passed 1. answering the reasonings of such of the states as have ventured into the field of reason, &amp; that of the Committee of Congress, taking some notice too of those states who have either not answered at all, or answered without reasoning. 2. making firm protestation against the precedent &amp; principle, &amp; reserving the right to make this palpable violation of the federal compact the ground of doing in future whatever we might now rightfully do, should repetitions of these and other violations of the compact render it expedient. 3. expressing in affectionate &amp; conciliatory language our warm attachment to union with our sister states &amp; to the instrument &amp; principles by which we are united, that we are willing to sacrifice to this every thing but the rights of self government in those important points which we have never yielded &amp; in which alone we see liberty, safety &amp; happiness; that not at all disposed to make every measure of error or of wrong a cause of scission we are willing to look on with indulgence &amp; to wait with patience till those passions &amp; delusions shall have passed over which the federal government have artfully excited to cover it’s own abuses &amp; conceal it’s designs, fully confident that the good sense of the American people, and their attachment to those very rights which we are now vindicating, will before it shall be too late rally with us  round the true principles of our federal compact.—this was only meant to give a general idea of the complexion &amp; topics of such an instrument. mr M. who came as had been proposed, does not concur in the reservation proposed above; and from this I recede readily, not only in deference to his judgment, but because, as we should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves. to these topics however should be added animadversions on the new pretensions to a common law of the US.  I proposed to mr M. to write to you; but he observed that you knew his sentiments so perfectly from a former conference, that it was unnecessary. as to the preparing any thing, I must decline it, to avoid suspicions (which were pretty strong in some quarters on the last occasion) and because there remains still (after their late loss) a mass of talents in Kentucky sufficient for every purpose. the only object of the present communications is to procure a concert in the general plan of action. besides, how could you better while away the road from hence to Kentucky than in meditating this very subject and preparing something yourself, than whom nobody will do it better. the loss of your brother and the visit of the apostle Marshal to Kentucky excite anxiety. however we doubt not that his poisons will be effectually counter-worked. wishing you a pleasant journey &amp; happy return I am with great and sincere esteem Dear Sir Your affectionate friend &amp; servt

&#x27;. y.-C;., Monticello, Sept. 3, 1790.  
&#x27;. &quot; Dear Sir: Yours of August &#x27; 30th  
came duly came to hand. It was with  
great regret we gave up tlie hope of see-  
ing you nerc, out couiu no consiucr me  
obstacle as legitimate. I had, written to  
Mn Madison, as I had before&quot; informed  
you, and had stated to him some genera&#x27;  
idea&#x27;s for &#x27;consideration and consultation  
and consultaupn when we should meet.  
I thought something essentially necessa­  
ry to be said, in ordef to avoid the infer­  
ence of acquicsence ; that a resolution or  
declaration should be passed 1, An  
swering . the reasonings of &quot;such of the  
Stateg 3 have Ventured into the&#x27; IGTeld-of  
reason; and that ot the committee ot  
Congress, .taking some&#x27;notice too, of  
those States who have either not answer­  
ed at all, or answered .without reasoning  
2. ,Making firm protestation against the  
precedent arid principle, and reserving  
the right to make this palpable violation  
of the federal tompact the ground of do­  
ing in future whatever we might rightful­  
ly do&#x27;, should repetitions of these and oth­  
er violations of the compact render it ex­  
pedient. 3. Expressing in affectionate  
arid conciliatory language our warm at­  
tachment to union with our sister States,  
and to the instrument and principles by  
which we are united ; that we are willing  
to . sacrifice to this every thing but the  
rights of self governrnent in those im­  
portant points which we have never yiel­  
ded, and in which alone we see liberty,  
safety; and happiness; that not at all dis­  
posed to make every measure of error or.  
01 wrong, a cause 01 scission, we are wil  
ling to , look&quot; on with indulgence, and to  
wait with patience till those passions and  
delusions shall have passed over, which  
the federal government have, artfully ex  
cited to cover its own abuses and conceal  
its &quot;designs, fully confident that the good  
sense of the American people,&#x27; and &#x27;their  
attachment to those very righs.M&#x27;hich we  
are now &#x27; vindicating, will, before it sbal  
be too late, rally with us round the true  
principles .of &#x27;our federal compact. This  
was only meant to give a general idea of  
the complexion and topics 01 such an in  
strument. Mr. M. who came as had been  
proposed does not concur in the reserva

MONTICELLO, September 5, 1799.  
Dear Sir: Yours of August 30 came duly to  
hand. It was with great regret we gave up the  
hope of seeing you here, but could not but con-  
sider the obstacle as legitimate. I had written  
to Mr. Madison, as I had before informed you,  
and had stated to him some general ideas for  
consideration and consultation when we should  
meet. I thought something essentially necessary  
to be said, in order to avoid the inference of ac-  
uiescence ; that a declaration or resolution  
should be _— . . . As to the preparing  
——s must decline it, to avoid suspicions  
(which were pretty strong in some quarters  
on the late occasion), and because there  
remains still (after their late loss) a  
mass of talents in Kentucky sufficient for every  
purpose. The only object of the present commu-  
nication is to procure a concert in the general  
lan of action, as it is extremely desirable that  
irginia and Kentucky should pursue the same  
track on this occasion. Besides, how could you  
better while away the road from hence to Ken-  
tucky, than in meditating this very subject, and  
we ager something yourself, than whom no-  
y will do it better? The loss of your brother  
and the visit of the apostle Marshall to Kentucky  
excite anxiety. However, we doubt not that his
