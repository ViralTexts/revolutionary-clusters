[Philadelphia, 7 Aug. 1794]  
  
Whereas combinations to defeat the execution of the laws laying duties upon Spirits distilled within the United States and upon Stills, have from the time of the commencement of those laws existed in some of the Western parts of Pennsylvania. And whereas the said Combinations, proceeding in a manner subversive equally of the just authority of Government and of the rights of individuals have hitherto effected their dangerous and criminal purpose; by the influence of certain irregular meetings  
  
whose proceedings have tended to encourage and uphold the spirit of opposition, by misrepresentations of the laws calculated to render them odious, by endeavours to deter those who might be so disposed from accepting offices under them, through fear of public resentment and of injury to person and property, and to compel those who had accepted such offices by actual violence to surrender or forbear the execution of them; by circulating vindictive menaces against all those who should otherwise directly or indirectly aid in the exectution of the said laws, or who, yielding to the dictates of conscience and to a sense of obligation should themselves comply therewith, by actually injuring and destroying the property of persons who were understood to have so complied; by inflicting cruel and humiliating punishments upon private citizens for no other cause than that of appearing to be friends of the laws; by intercepting the public officers on the high ways, abusing, assaulting and otherwise ill treating them; by going to their houses in the night, gaining admittance by force, taking away their papers and committing other outrages; employing for these unwarrantable purposes the Agency of Armed Banditti, disguised in such manner as for the most part to escape discovery:  And whereas the endeavors of the Legislature to obviate objections to the said laws, by lowering the duties and by other alterations conducive to the convenience of those whom they immediately affect (though they have given satisfaction in other quarters) and the endeavors of the Executive officers to conciliate a compliance with the laws, by explanations, by forbearance and even by particular accommodations founded on the suggestion of local considerations, have been disappointed of their effect by the machinations of persons whose industry to excite resistance has increased with every appearance of a disposition among the people to relax in their opposition and to acquiesce in the laws: insomuch that many persons in the said western parts of Pennsylvania have at length been hardy enough to perpetrate acts which I am advised amount to treason, being overt acts of levying war against the United States; the said persons having on the sixteenth and Seventeenth of July last past proceeded in arms (on the second day amounting to several hundreds) to the house of John Neville Inspector of the Revenue for the fourth survey of the District of Pennsylvania, having repeatedly attacked the said house  
  
with the persons therein wounding some of them, having seized David Lenox, Marshal of the District of Pennsylvania, who previous thereto had been fired upon, while in the execution of his duty, by a party of armed men detaining him for some time prisoner, till for the preservation of his life and the obtaining of his liberty he found it necessary to enter into stipulations to forbear the execution of certain official duties touching processes issuing out of a Court of the United States—and having finally obliged the said Inspector of the Revenue and the said marshal from considerations of personal safety to fly from that part of the Country, in order by a circuitous route to proceed to the seat of Government; avowing as the motives of these outrageous proceedings an intention to prevent by force of Arms the execution of the said laws, to oblige the said Inspector of the Revenue to renounce his said office, to withstand by open violence the lawful authority of the Government of the United States, and to compel thereby an alteration in the measures of the Legislature and a repeal of the laws aforesaid.  And whereas by a law of the United States intitled &quot;An Act to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union suppress insurrections and repel invasions,&quot; it is enacted &quot;that whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the Marshals by that act, the same being notified by an associate Justice or the District Judge, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia of such State to suppress such combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed. And if the militia of a State where such Combinations may happen shall refuse or be insufficient to suppress the same it shall be lawful for the President if the Legislature of the United States shall not be in session to call forth and employ such numbers of the militia of any other State or States most convenient thereto, as may be necessary, and the use of the militia so to be called forth may be continued, if necessary, until the expiration of thirty days after the Commencement of the ensuing Session:  Provided always that whenever it may be necessary in the judgment of the President to use the military force hereby directed to be called forth; The President shall forthwith and previous thereto, by Proclamation, command  
  
such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time.&quot;  And whereas James Wilson an associate Justice on the fourth instant by writing under his hand did, from evidence which had been laid before him, notify to me that &quot;in the Counties of Washington and Alleghany in Pennsylvania laws of the United States are opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed by Combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of Judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the Marshal of that District.&quot;  And whereas it is in my Judgment necessary under the circumstances of the case to take measures for calling forth the militia in order to suppress the Combinations aforesaid and to cause the Laws to be duly executed, and I have accordingly determined so to do, feeling the deepest regret for the occasion, but withal the most Solemn conviction, that the essential interests of the Union demand it, that the very existence of Government and the fundamental principles of social order are materially involved in the issue, and that the patriotism and firmness of all good Citizens are seriously called upon, as occasion may require, to aid in the effectual suppression of so fatal a Spirit.  
Wherefore, and in pursuance of the Proviso above recited, I George Washington, President of the United States, do hereby command all persons, being insurgents as aforesaid and all others whom it may concern on or before the first day of September next to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes. And I do moreover warn all persons whomsoever against aiding abetting or comforting the perpetrators of the aforesaid treasonable Acts: and do require all officers and other Citizens according to their respective duties and the laws of the land to exert their utmost endeavors to prevent and suppress such dangerous proceedings.  
In Testimony whereof I have caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand. Done at the City of Philadelphia the Seventh day of August one thousand seven hundred and ninety four, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the nineteenth.  
  
Go. Washington.

numbers of the militia of any other  
(late or Hates moll convenient theteto,

militia so to be called foith may be  
continued, if neceflary, until the expi­  
ration of thirty days after, the com­  
mencement of the enfuiftg fefiion , Pro­  
vided always, that whenever it may be  
neceflary in the judgment of the Preli­  
dent to life the military force hereby di­  
rected to be called forth, the President  
fhal! forthwith and previous thereto, by  
Proclamation, command such insurgents  
to disperse and retire peaceably to their,  
refpeftive abodes within a linrited time.&quot;  
—And whereas James Wilson ffn nflo­  
jriate jultice on the fourth inltant by  
writing under his hand did, from evi­  
dence \Vhich had been laid before him,  
notify to me that &quot; in the counties of  
&quot; Washington and Allegheny in Penn­  
&quot; fylvania, the laws of the United States  
&quot; are opposed, and the execution there­  
&quot; of obftru£led by combinations too

And whereas it is in my judgment  
necefl&#x27;ary under the circumstances of the  
cafe to take measures for calling forth  
the militia in order to suppress the com­  
binations aforefaid and to cause the laws  
to be duly executed, and I have accord­  
ingly determined so to do, feeling the  
deepeit regret for the occalion, but with­  
al the most fblemn conviction, that the  
eflential iriterefts of the Union demand  
it, that the very existence of goverh­  
ment and the fundamental principles of  
social order are&#x27;materially involved in  
the and that the patriotism and  
firt.inefs of all good citizens are seriously  
called upon, as occasion may require to  
aid in the effectual suppression of so fatal  
a spirit.  
  
Wherefore, atnd in pursuance of the  
provision above recited, I George Wash­  
ington, President of the United States,  
do hereby command all persons, being  
insurgents as aforefaid, and all others  
whom it may concern, on or before the  
firft day of September next to disperse  
and retire peaceably to their refpe&amp;ive  
abodes. And I do moreover warn all  
persons whoiiifoever against aiding abet­  
ting or comforting the perpetrators of  
the aforesaid trcafonable acts : And do  
require all officers and other citizens ac­  
cording &quot;to their refpeftivc duties and  
the law of the land to exert their utmost  
endeavors to prevent and suppress such  
dangerous proceedings.  
  
In tellimony whereof I have caus­  
ed the feaj of the United States  
  
of America to be affixed to these  
  
presents, and signed the fame

BY AUTHORITY.  
From the Philadelphia Gaictte.  
By the President of the United States  
of America.  
A PROCLAMATION.  
WHEREAS combinations to defeat  
the execution of the !a&lt;,vs laying duties  
upon spirits diililled within the United  
States and upon ft ills, have from the  
time of the commencement of those  
laws existed in fomeof the western parts  
of Pennsylvania ; And ivhereat the said  
combinations, proceeding in a manner  
(übverfive equally of the just authority  
of government and of the rights of in­  
dividuals have hitherto effected their  
dangerous and criminal purpose; by  
the influence of certain irregular meet­  
ings, whole proceedings have tended to  
encourage and uphold the spirit of op­  
position, by misrepresentations of the  
laws calculated to render them odious,  
by endeavors to deter those who might  
be fodifpofed from accepting offices un­  
der them, through fear of public re­  
sentment and of injury to person and,  
property, and to compel those who had  
accepted such offices by a final violence  
to surrender or forbear the execution of  
them ;—by circulating vindictive mcna­  
cts againlt all those who (hould other­  
w:fe directly or indirectly aid in the exe­  
cution of the said laws or who, yielding  
to the didlates of conscience and to a;  
lenfe of obligation should themfelves1  
comply therewith, by actually injuring  
and deltroying the property of persons  
&#x27;who were understood to have so compli­  
|cd :—by infliAing cruel and humiliating  
upon private citizens for no  
other cause than that of appearing to  
be the friends of the laws;—by in­  
tercepting the public officers 011  
the high ways, abusing, aflaulting,  
artd otherwise ill treating them ; by going  
to their houses in the right, gaining ad­  
mittance by force, taking away their  
papers and committing other outrages;  
employing for these unwarrantable pur  
poses the agency of armed banditti dif­  
guifedin such manner as for tlie moll part tc  
&gt;;fcape discovery ;—And whereas the en  
leavors of the Legislature to obviate ob­  
iedlions to the said laws, by lowering the  
duties and by other alterations conducive tc  
the convenience of those whom they im  
mediately affedl /&#x27;though they have givu  
fatiffa&amp;ion in other quarters )and the en­  
deavors of the executive officers to con­  
&#x27; militate a,compliance with the laws, by ex-  
I iilanations, by forbearance and even bj  
accomodations founded on the fuggeftior  
of local considerations have been difap­  
r pointed of their effetfl by the machin it ion;  
aof persons whose industry to excite re  
a tlftance has increased with the appearand  
r df a disposition among the people to relax it  
&#x27; their opposition and to aquiefce in the laws  
f inforriuch that many persons in the fait  
&#x27; \tcftern parts of Pennsylvania hare a  
j length been hardy enough to peVpretrat

i, being overt arts of levying war against th

in fafety to fly from that part of the cour

proceed to the feat of government;   
r vowing as the motives of these out  
rageous proceedings an intention to pre  
vent by force of arms the execution o  
, the said laws, to oblige the said infpec  
tor of the revenue to renounce his fai  
&quot; office, to withstand by open violence th  
in lawful authority of the government c  
l.jthe United States, and to compel then  
lc by an alteration in the measures of th  
&#x27;Megiflaure and a repeal of the laws s

case, to take measures for calling forth the militia, in order to suppress the com-

require, to aid in the effectual suppression of so fatal a spirit.” The insurgents  
were required to disperse and retire to their respective homes, by the first of  
the following September. At the time of issuing the proclamation, requisitions  
were made on the governors of New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Vir-

Its adoption will seriously impair the em  
eiency of the .Executive Department of tha  
Government.  
The first act expressly anthorizlng the nse  
Df the military power to execute the laws was  
passed almost as early as the organisation of  
the government under the Constitution, and  
was approved by President Washington, May  
I, nn. It is as follows :  
&quot;SEC. 3. And be it fatther enacted. That when­  
ever the laws of the United States shall be  
opposed or the execution thereof obstructed  
In any State by combinations too powerful  
to be suppressed by the ordinary course of  
fudicial proceedings, or by the powers vested  
In the Marshals by this act, the same being  
Cotihed to the President of the United States  
y ail Associate Justice or District Judge, it  
Shall be lawful for the President of the Unit­  
ed States to call forth the militia of such  
State to suppress such combinations, and to&#x27;  
cause the laws to be duly executed ; and if  
the militia of a State where such combina­

thirty days after the commencement of the  
ensuing session.&quot;  
In 17H.i this provision was substantially re­  
enacted in a law which repealed the act of  
17IM. In 1807 the following act became the  
law by tlie approval of President Jt-flVrson:
