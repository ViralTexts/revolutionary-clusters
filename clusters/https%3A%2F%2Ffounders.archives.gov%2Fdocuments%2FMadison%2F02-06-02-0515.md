 and the United States to each other, as well as to the general state of things in Europe, incline the President to think the present moment not adapted to the experiment which is the object of your proposed mission to Madrid. You will therefore keep your arrangements for it in suspence, without forgetting that more favorable appearances may quickly produce instructions for your repairing thither.  
The Treaty of 1794 so far as it relates to commerce having expired on the 1st day of October last, (that being the date of the preliminary articles) the commercial intercourse between the two Countries is left to the regulations which the parties separately may think fit to establish. It may be expected however that the friendship and mutual interest between them will produce a continuance on both sides of such regulations as are just and equal, and an accommodation to these principles of such as on either side are otherwise than just and equal. On the side of the United States their Commercial regulations place Great Britain in every respect on the footing of the most favored nation. Great Britain cannot say as much with respect to hers. One instance at least is explained in a letter from this Department to Mr King, of which a copy is inclosed, in which you will see that altho’ the act of Parliament to which it refers, be no longer a breach of Stipulation, it is not less a violation of equality, than it is of sound policy. With respect to the British West Indies, it is not known that the United States are on a worse footing than other nations, whatever want of reciprocity there may be, to the liberal regulations of the United States. With respect to the East India Trade, it is understood that the Treaty of 1794 by denying to American vessels both the coasting branch of it and a direct intercourse between India and foreign Countries other than America, the United States were in both instances placed on a worse footing than other nations, and even on a worse footing than they themselves enjoyed prior to the Treaty. The expiration of the Treaty, and the friendly and favorable equality allowed by the United States to Great Britain in every branch of their trade, ought certainly to restore what the Treaty suspended.  
These observations are made not with a view to any negotiations whatever leading at the present moment to a Treaty on those or any other Commercial points, or to discussions which might be misconstrued into a wish to take unreasonable advantage of a critical moment, but to enable you to present the ideas of your Government with more precision, to vindicate our commercial policy against misconceptions, and to avail yourself the better of fit occasions for obtaining from the British Government such relaxations, as may be due to our example, and be calculated to cherish amity and useful intercourse between the two nations.  
In my letter of  I stated the reasonableness of admitting American Consuls in the dependencies of Great Britain whenever and wherever the American commerce should be admitted. The principle urged in this case is applicable to the East as well as to the West Indies. During the last war an American Agent, was informally at least, allowed to reside at Calcutta, and take care of the trade of his countrymen. Mr Jacob Lewis who was appointed to succeed him, proceeded to London on his way thither, but peace having intervened, his application for an Exequatur was refused. It is of real importance to our trade with that Country that such a functionary should be permitted to reside in it, the more so, if it be true that the rule forbidding foreign factors to do so, be enforced there. Be so good as to sound the British Government on this subject and communicate its sentiments, for the information of the President.

(Signed) JAMES MADISON,  
  
(EXTRACT.)  
Mr. Maditon. Secretary of State, ter Mr. Monroe.  
Dated, Department of State,  
March 5, 1804.  
The treaty of 17.94, so far as it relates to com­  
merce, having expired on the hist day of October  
last, (that being the dale of the preliminary arti­  
cles) the commercial intercourse between the-two  
countries is left to the regulations&#x27; which the parlies  
separately may think fit to establish. It maybe  
expected, however, that the friendship Hiid mutual ]  
interest between them, will produce a continuance  
on both sides ol such regulations as are just and  
equal, and an accommodation to those principles ol  
such as, on either side, are otherwise than just  
and equ 11. On the side of the UlMled States, their  
commercial regulations place Great-Hiltain in eve­  
ry respect on the tooting of the most favoured na­  
tion. Great-Britain cannot sav as much with res­  
pect to hers. One instance at least is explained in  
a letter from this department to Mr. King, ol winch  
a copy is,inclosed, in which you will see that al­  
though the act of parliament to which it reters be  
O &#x27; longer a breach of stipulation, it is not less a vi­  
olation ol equality than it is ol sound policy. With  
respect to the British West-Indies, ii in not known  
that the United States are on a worse looting than  
other nations, whatever want of reciprocity there  
may he to the liberal regulations id the United  
States. \\ lth respect to the Kasl-lndia trade, it is  
understood that the treaty of 17.94, by-denying to  
American vessels both the coasting branch of it  
and a direct intercourse betwe-n India and lorrign  
countries, other than America, ilia United States  
were in both instances placed on a wmsr looting  
than other nations, and even mi a wnise lootm.  
than they themselves enjoyed prior to the treaty. —  
The expiration of the treaty, and the Iriendly uml  
favourable equality allowed by Ihe United Slates to  
Great-Britain in every branch ol their tradi, ought  
ceitainly to restore what the treaty sus|iended.  
1 licse observations are made not wilh a view to  
any negotiation w ha lever leading at the present nw­  
ni&#x27;-nt to a treaty on those or any other cominen-i d  
points, or to discussion which niiv ht be msiconstru­  
ed into a wish to take unreasonable art. mtagp ol a  
critical moment, but to enable you to present the

a.n American agent was inform.iliy at least allowed

interests they were appointed  
to protect, if they had taken less than  
Britain herself had acknowledged US  
entitled to ?  
If, in substance, our demands were  
just, was there any thing in the man­  
ner in which they were urged, calcu­  
lated to wound the feelings of the  
British government ? On the contra­  
ry, we have seen that the manner w« s &#x27;  
in the highest degree dispassionate  
and conciliating.  
i the sth of March 1304, the Se- !  
crelary of State follows Up these in- j  
structions by others. In opening them j  
be observes—  
&quot; The treaty of 179-1, so far a  
relates to commerce, having expired j  
&#x27;on the Ist day of October last, (tluit j

r- and equal. On the side of the U. S.  
1 their commercial regulations place.  
. G. Britain in every respect on the foot­  
i ing of the most favored nation. Great  
Britain cannot say as much with res­  
» pect to hers. One instance at least is  
r&#x27; explained it. a letter from this depart- j  
[ mint to Mr. King, of which a copy !  
I is inclosed, in which you will see that j  
» although the at tol parliament to which J  
t it refers be no longer a breach of Sti­  
j pu&#x27;ation, il is not less a violation of  
j equality than it is of sound policy.  
. With res; eel to the British W. Indies,  
it is noi known that the U. States are  
, on a worse footing than other nations,  
• whatever want of reciprocity there  
, may be to the liberal regulations of the  
U. States. With respect to the East  
. India trade, it is understood that the  
, treaty of 1794, by denying to Arneri­  
. can vessels both the coasting branch  
l of it and a direct intercourse between  
;• India and foreign countries, other than  
■ America, the U. States were in both  
. instances placed on a worse footing  
, than other nations, and even on a

piration of tlie treaty, and the fi iendly
