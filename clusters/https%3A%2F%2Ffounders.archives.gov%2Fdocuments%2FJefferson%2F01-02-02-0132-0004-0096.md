The question presented upon this writ of error, arises under a  
law of the state of Mississippi, concerning escapes, passed the 7th  
of June, 1822, (Revised Code, 318;) the third section of which  
declares, that no judgment shall be entered against any sheriff or  
other officer, in any suit brought upon the escape of any debtor  
in his or their custody, unless the jury who shall try the issue,  
shall expressly find that such debtor or prisoner did escape with  
the consent or through the negligence of such sheriff or other  
officer ; or that such prisoner might have been retaken, and that  
the sheriff or other officer neglected to make immediate pursuit.  
This latter branch of the act is not involved in the present ques-  
tion. The declaration contains no averment of neglect to make  
immediate pursuit to retake the prisoner.

to all actions for escapes, whether the prisoner is in custody of  
the sheriff on mesne process or on an execution, there is
