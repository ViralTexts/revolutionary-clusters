d: You know, my dear Sir, I had concentered all my schemes, all my views, all my wishes⟨,⟩ within the narrow circle of domestic enjoy⟨me⟩nt⟨.⟩ Thou⟨g⟩h I flatter myself the world w⟨ill do me the justice⟩ to believe, that, at my time ⟨of life &amp; in my⟩ circumstances, nothing but a ⟨conviction⟩ of duty could have induced me to depart from my resolution of remaining in retirement; yet I greatly apprehend that my Countrymen will expect too much from me. I fear, if the issue of public measures should not corrispond with their sanguine expectations, they will turn ⟨the⟩ extravagant (and I may say undue) praises which they are heaping upon me at this moment, into equally extravagant (though I will fondly hope unmerited) censures. So ⟨m⟩uch is expected, so many untoward circum⟨stan⟩ces may intervene, in such a new and cr⟨itic⟩al situation, that I feel an insuperable diffidence in my ⟨ow⟩n a⟨bilities—I⟩ feel, in the execution of the ⟨duties of my ardu⟩ous Office, how ⟨m⟩uch ⟨I shall stand in need of the⟩ countenance &amp;  
  
aid of every f⟨riend to myself, of⟩ every friend to the Revolution—and of every lo⟨v⟩er of good Government. I thank you, my dear Sir, for ⟨your⟩ affectionate expressions on this point.  
I anticipate that one of the most diff⟨icu⟩lt ⟨&amp;⟩ delicate parts of the duty of my ⟨office will be th⟩at which relates to nominations ⟨for appointmen⟩ts. I receive with the more ⟨satisfaction⟩ the strong testimonials in behalf ⟨of Mr Hall⟩ because I hope they will tend to ⟨s⟩upercede the difficulty in this instance. Though from a system which I have prescribed to myself I can say nothing decisive on particular appointments; yet I may be allowed to observe in general, that nothing could be more agreeable to me than to have one Candidate brought forward for every Office of such clear pretensions as to secure him against competition.
