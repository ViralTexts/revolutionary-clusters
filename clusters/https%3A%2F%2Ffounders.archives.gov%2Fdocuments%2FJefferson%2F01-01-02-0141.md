 the town of Hampton. They opposed and repelled him with considerable loss on his side and none on ours. It has raised our country into perfect phrensy. It is an immense misfortune to the whole empire to have a king of such a disposition at such a time. We are told and every thing proves it true that he is the bitterest enemy we have. His minister is able, and that satisfies me that ignorance or wickedness somewhere controuls him. In an earlier part of this contest our petitions told him that from our king there was but one appeal. The admonition was despised and that appeal forced on us. To undo his empire he has but one truth more to learn, that after colonies have drawn the sword there is but one step more they can take. That step is now pressed upon us by the measures adopted as if they were afraid we would not take it. Beleive me Dear Sir there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a Union with Gr. Britain than I do. But by the god that made me I will cease to exist before I yeild to a connection on such terms as the British parliament propose and in this I think I speak the sentiments of America. We want neither inducement nor power to declare and assert a separation. It is will alone which is wanting and that is growing apace under the fostering hand of our king. One bloody campaign will probably decide everlastingly our future course; I am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on. If our winds and waters should not combine to rescue their shores from slavery, and General Howe’s reinforcement should arrive in safety we have hopes he will be inspirited to come out of Boston and take  another drubbing: and we must drub you soundly before the sceptered tyrant will know we are not mere brutes, to crouch under his hand and kiss the rod with which he deigns to scourge us.

ting to turn over again and  
again those histories, biographies and other books  
which concern the great men—the bold and bright  
spirits that worked so well for the establishment of  
our nationality. Such books may be said to contain  
much of the inspiration of succeeding literature, they  
are so full of sterling sentiment and fine suggestion.  
Everything said by those departed great men is said  
with an earnestness that preserves the interest of  
their words even to our own times. Thomas Jeffer-  
son, writing to Randolph in 1775, says, ‘‘ Believe me,  
dear sir, there is not a man in the Brilish empire,  
who more cordially loves a union with that British

to his kinsman, John Randolph, that  
there was not a man in the British Em-  
pire who more cordially loved a union  
with Great Britain than he did! Love  
it as he might, he had probably ceased  
to think it possible. “It is an immense  
misfortune to the whole Empire,” he  
wrote, “to have such a king at sucha  
time. We are told, and everything

fact was not generally known, felt that  
a man of the calibre of Lord North was  
out of place in the Cabinet of George  
III., and did not in his heart approve
