					That of the 15th. Jany from Mr. Champagny to you has, as you will see by the papers herewith sent, produced all the sensations here, which the spirit and stile of it were calculated to excite in minds alive to the interests and honor of the nation. To

In these lights the President makes it your duty to present to the French Government the contents of Mr. Champagny’s letter; taking care, as your discretion will doubtless suggest, that whilst you make that Government sensible of the offensive tone employed you leave the way open for friendly and respectful explanations if there be a disposition to offer them; and for a decision here on any reply which may be of a different character.

f American troops into them would not be disagreeable to the Emperor.  
					Congress closed their Session on the 25 ult. For a general view of their proceedings, I refer to the series of Newspapers heretofore and now forwarded, and to other prints which are added. Among their acts of chief importance is that which vests in the  
						President an authority to suspend in whole or in part the Embargo laws.  
					The conditions on which the suspending authority is to be exercised will engage your particular attention. They appeal equally to the justice and the policy of the two great belligerent powers now emulating each other in violations of both. The President  
						counts on your best endeavors to give to this appeal all the effect possible with the French Government. Mr. Pinkney will be doing the same with that of Great Britain. The relation in which a recall of its retaliating decrees by either power, will place the United States to  
						the other, is obvious; and ought to be a motive to the measure proportioned to the desire which has been manifested by each, to produce collisions between the UStates and its adversary; and which must be equally felt by each to avoid one with itself.  
					Should wiser Councils or increasing distresses induce Great Britain to revoke her impolitic orders against neutral commerce, and thereby prepare the way for a removal of the Embargo as it applies to her, France could not persist in the illegal part of her  
						decrees, if she does not mean to force a contest with the United States. On the other hand should she set the example of revocation Great Britain would be obliged, either by following it, to restore to France the full benefit of neutral trade which she needs, or by  
						persevering in her obnoxious orders after the pretext for them had ceased, to render collisions with the United States inevitable.  
					In every point of view therefore it is so clearly the sound policy of France to rescind so much at least of her decrees as trespass on neutral rights, and particularly to be the first in taking the retrograde step, that it cannot be unreasonable to expect  
						that it will be immediately taken.  
					The repeal of her decrees is the more to be expected, above all if Great Britain should repeal or be likely to repeal hers, as the plan of the original decree at Berlin did not extend to a violation of the freedom of the seas, and was restricted to a  
						municipal operation nearly an entire year, notwithstanding the illegal British orders of Jany 1807; and as a return of France to that restricted scope of her plan, would so immaterially diminish its operation against the British commerce; that operation being so completely in  
						the power of France on land, and so little in her power on the high seas.  
					But altho’ we cannot of right demand from France more than a repeal of so much of her decrees as violate the freedom of the seas, and a great point will be gained by a repeal of that part of them, yet as it may not have the effect of inducing a repeal of  
						the whole illegal system of the British Government which may seek pretexts, or plead a necessity for counteracting the unprecedented and formidable mode of warfare practiced against her, it will be desirable that as little room as possible should be left for this remaining  
						danger to the tranquil enjoyment of our commercial rights.  
					In whatever degree the French Government may be led to change its system, you will lose no time in transmitting the information to this Department and to Mr. Pinkney, and by hired conveyances, if necessary. A correspondent instruction is given to Mr.  
						Pinkney.  
					It is of the greater importance that you should receive from each other the earliest notice of any relaxations, as each Government is under a pledge to follow such an example by the other. And it is not of less importance that the President or Congress  
						should be acquainted with the facts, that the proceedings here may be accommodated to them.  
					That you may know the grounds on which the British orders of Novr. have been arraigned by this Government, I inclose a copy of the answer to Mr. Erskine’s note communicating them; a copy of the note being also inclosed.  
					The other documents communicated will put you in full possession of the relations of the U States with Great Britain, as resulting from the issue of our general negotiations, and from that of the mission of Mr. Rose.  
					The letter from the King of Westphalia to the President having passed thro’ your hands, the answer is herewith inclosed to be forwarded by you.  
					I learn from the Treasury that no delay arises in settling your ordinary accounts, but from that in receiving the Bankers accounts connected with them. Mr. Gallatin tells me that the accounts under the Louisiana Convention have not yet been taken up, but  
						will be in a few days.  
					This dispatch is forwarded by Mr. Baker, who takes his passage from Baltimore, in a vessel engaged as was the Osage which sailed from New York, for the special purpose of public and mercantile correspondencies with Europe. She will proceed in the first  
						instance to L’Orient where she will leave Mr. Baker, and thence proceed with dispatches for Mr. Pinkney to Falmouth, where she will remain a few days to receive communications from him. She will then return to L’Orient, in order to bring back Mr. Baker with your  
						communications. I have the honor to be &amp;c

portioned to the desire which has  
been manifested by each, to pro-  
duce collisions between the Unit-

which must be equally felt by

ter, taking care, as yonv discretion will  
doubtless suggest, that whilst you make that

employed, you leave the way open for friend­  
ly anil respectful explanations if there ben  
disposition to offer them, and for a dccisi .  
here on any reply which may be of a differ-.  
ei)t character.” s  
“ Congress closed their session cii the 25th  
ultimo. For a general view of their pro­  
ceedings. treter to the sevies ot news-papers  
heretofore, and now forwarded, anil to other  
prints which are added. Among their acts  
of chief importance is that which vests in  
the Prasidcnt an authority to siupend in  
whole or in part the embargo laws.  
44 The conditic s on who h the- suspend­  
ing authority is to be exercised, will on-&#x27;  
gage your particular attention. They ap­  
peal equally to the justice and the policy  
cf the two great belligerent powers now e­  
rmilating each other ia violations of both.  
The President counts on your best endea­  
vors no gi ve ’o this appeal all the effect pos­  
sible with the French government. Mr.  
Pinkney will be doing the same with that of  
Great-llritain. The relation in which a re­  
tail of its retaliating decrees, hy either pow -  
er, will place the United States to the other  
is obvious, and ought to l»e a motive to the  
measure, proportioned to the desire Which  
has been manifested by each, to produce col­  
lisions between rhe United States and its ad­  
versary* and which must be equally felt by  
each to avoid one with itself.  
“ Should wiser councils or increasing dis­  
tresses induce Great-Bvitain to invoke her  
impolitic orders against neutral commerce,  
and thereby prepare the way for a removal  
of the embargo, asit applies to her, France  
could not persist in the illegal part of her  
decrees, if she dues not mcart to force a con­  
test with the United States. On rhe other  
hand, should she set the example of revo­  
cation, Great-Britain would be obliged, ei­  
ther by following it, to restore to France the  
full heptfft ofneuti&#x27;d trade, which she needs ;  
or by&#x27;perstiv&#x27;ering in her obnoxious orders,  
after the pretext for them had. ceased, to  
render collisions with the United States ine­  
vitable.  
*• Jn every point of view, therefore, it is  
s&gt; cleavly the sound policy ol France to re­  
scind go much at least of Iter decrees as tres­  
pass on neutral rights, and particularly to-be  
the first in taking the retrograde stfcp, that  
it cannot be unreasonable to dxpect that it  
will be immediately taken.”  
“ In whatever uegree the French govern­  
ment may be led to change its system, you  
will lose no time in transmitting the intor­  
iMation to this department, and to Mr. Pink­  
ney ; and oy hired conveyances, it necessary.  
A correspondent instruction is given to Mr  
Pinkney.  
“ It is of the greater importance, that you  
should receive from each other the earliest  
notice, of any relaxations, as each government  
j-under a pledge to follow such an example  
by the other. And it is not of less importance  
that the President or Congress should be ac­  
quainted with the foots, that the proceedings  
here may b&quot; accommodated trt them.  
44 That you may know the grounds on  
which the British orders of November, have  
bee;1 arraigned by tilts government, ! inclose  
a copy of the answer to Mr. Erskine’s note  
communicating them, a copy of the note be­

“ Tiie other documents communicated,  
wiil put yo« in full ponesssion of the relations  
of the United States with Great Britain, as

which the cooduct of another na­

the air at least of an assumed au­

were ca&#x27;tulated to excite in.rajhda alive to (he,  
interests and honor $f the nation. - To present  
t the United State the alternative of bending  
to the viewsof Ftance against her enemy, or  
6t incurringfa confiscation of all the property  
f &#x27;tur rU,m carried into the French prize

on their councils and course of procefcclii3,  
had the air at. least of an assumed authority,  
pot lessirrUa&#x27;ing to the public feelings. In  
  
kse ltghts the President makes it your duty  
Vj present to the French government, the con­  
tents of Mr Champa&amp;jy&#x27;s letter, taking care,  
as your discretion Vill doubtless suggest, that  
whilst you make that government sensible of  
the offensive ton employed,&#x27; you leave the  
way open&quot; for friendly and respectful explana­  
tions, if there be a disposition to offer them,  
and for decision here on any reply which  
may be of a different character.&quot;,  
; Congress closed their session bT the 25th  
ultimo Fm a general view of their proceed­  
ings, I refer to the series of newspapers here  
tofore, and now forwarded, and to other  
prints which are added. : Among their acts  
of chief importance is that which vests in the  
President an authority to suspend in whtJew  
in part the embargo laws.  
The conditions on which the suspending  
authority ft to be, exerciied will engage your  
particular attention. They appeal equally to  
the justice and the policy of the two great bel­  
Jljereut powers now emulating each other in  
Tioidtioris of both. lhePrebident founts on­  
your host endeavors to give to this appeal all  
the effect possible with the Frepch jjovern­  
n.ient. Mr. Pinkny will be doing the same  
witrtithal of Great Britain&#x27;. The relation in  
whtah a recall of its retaliating decrees, by  
tiilier power, will place the United&#x27;States to  
the oilier, is obvious, and ought to be mo,  
tivs tothe measure, proportioned to the de­  
sire which ha3 been manifested by each, to  
produce collisions&#x27; betw-cen the United States  
and its adversary, and which must-bc equally  
tit ly each to avoid oe with itself,  
Should wiser councils or increasing dis­  
tresses -induce, Crea Briuin to revoke her  
impoli&#x27;ic orders against neutral comtricrcc,  
a?id thereby prepare the way for a rennal of  
the embargo, as it applies to her., Fraie  
could not &#x27;persist in the illegal part of her de­  
crees if she iloes- not mean to&#x27; force a contest  
with the United States. On the other hand,  
s&#x27;lould she set the example cf revocation,  
Great Britain would be o!dig?d,; either by  
following it, to restore to France the full be­  
nefit of neutral tfatie, which she&#x27; heeds ; or
