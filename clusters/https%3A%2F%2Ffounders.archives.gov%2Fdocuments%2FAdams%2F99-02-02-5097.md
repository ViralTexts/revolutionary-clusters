n the Sun and Wind and afterwards burnt to the Ashes called Kelp. The Proscess of making it is thus: The Rocks which are dry at low Water, are the beds of great quantities of Sea-Weed; which is cutt, carried to the beach and dried: a hollow is dug in the ground, three or four feet wide; round its margin are laid a row of Stones, on which the Sea Weed is placed, and Set on fire within, and quantities of this fuel being continually heaped upon the Circle, there is in the Centre a perpetual flame, from which a liquid like melted Metal, drops into the hollow beneath: When it is full, as it commonly is e’re the close of day all heterogenious matter being removed, the Kelp is wrought with iron rakes, and brought to a uniform consistence in a State of fusion. When cool, it consolidates into a heavy, dark coloured Alkaline Substance, which undergoes in the glass houses, a Second Vitrification, and assumes a perfect transparency; the progress by which thus a parcell of Sea weed, formerly the Slymy bed of Seals or dreary Shelter of Shellfish, is converted into a Chrystal Lustre for an Assembly room, or a Sett of Glasses for a convivial Table, is a Metamorphosis that might be a Subject for an entertaining Tale.

There are four plants, which, in the early part of their growth, bear So Strong a resemblance to each other, as would deceive any but the Farmers and nice Observers. These four are Barilla Gazul (or as Some call it Algazul) Sosa, (does he mean Soda?), and Salicornia or Salicor. These are all burnt to ashes; but applied to different Uses, as being possessed of different qualities. Some of the roguish Farmers mix, more or less of the three last, with the first; and it requires a complete Knowledge of the colour, taste, and Smell of the Ashes, to be able to detect their knavery.  
Barilla, is Sown afresh every Year. It’s greatest hight above ground is four Inches: each root pushes out a vast number of little Stalks, which again are Subdivided into Smaller Spriggs resembling Samphire; and all together form a large, Spreading tufted Bush. The Colour is bright green; as the plant advances towards maturity, this colour vanishes away, till at last it come to a dull green tinged with brown.  
Gazul bears the great Affinity to Barilla, both in quality and Appearance: the principal difference consists in its growing on a Still drier, Salter earth, consequently it is impregnated with a Stronger Salt. It does not rise above two Inches out of the ground, Spreading out into little Tufts. It’s Sprigs are much flatter, and more pulpy than those of Barilla, and are Still more like Samphire. It is Sown, but once in three, four, or five Years according to the nature of the Soil.  
Soza, when of the Same Size, has the Same Appearance as Gazul; but in time grows much larger, as its natural Soil is a Strong Salt marsh where it is to be found in large Tufts of Spriggs, treble the Size of Barilla and of a bright green colour, which it retains till the last.  
Salicor has a Stalk of a deep green colour inclining to red, which last becomes by degrees the colour of the whole plant. From the beginning it grows upright, and much resembles a bush of young rosemary. Its natural Soil is on the declivities of or Hills, near the Salt Marshes, or on the Edges of the Small drains or Channels cut by the Husbandmen for the purpose of watering the fields: before it has acquired its full growth it is very like the Barilla of those Seasons in which the ground has been dunged before Sowing. In those years of manuring, Barilla, contrary to its usual nature, comes up, with a tinge of red; and when burnt falls far short of its wanted goodness, being bitter, more impregnated with Salts than it Should be, and raising a blister if applied, for a few minutes to the tongue. Barilla contains less Salt than the others; when burnt it runs into a mass, resembling a Spungy Stone, with a faint cast of blue.  
Gazul, after burning comes as near Barilla, in its Outward Appearance as it does while growing in its vegetable form; but, if broken, the inside is of a deeper and more glossy hue. Soza and Salicor are darker, and almost black within, of a heavy consistence, with very little or no Signs of Spongyness.  
All these Ashes contain a Strong Alkali; but Barilla the best and purest, though not in the greatest quantity. Upon this principle, it is fittest for making glass and bleaching linnen; the others are used in making Soap. Each of them would whiten linnen; but all except Barilla would burn it. A good Crop of Barilla impoverishes the land to such a degree, that it cannot bear good Barilla a Second time, being quite exhausted. For this reason the richer farmers lay  manure upon the Ground and let it lie fallow for a Season; at the End of which it is Sown afresh with out any danger, as the Weeds that have Sprung up in the Year of rest, have carried off all the pernicious effects of the dung. A proper Succession of Crops is thus Secured by manuring and fallowing the different parts of the farm, each in their turn. The poorer tribe of cultivators, cannot pursue the Same Method for want of Capital; and are therefore under the neccessity of Sowing their Lands immediately after manuring, which yields them a profit just Sufficient to afford a present Scanty Subsistance, though the reality and price of their Barilla be but trifiling.  
The method used in making Barilla is the Same as that followed in Britain in burning Kelp. The plant as Soon as ripe is plucked up and laid in heaps, then Set on fire. The Salt Juices run out below into an hole made in the ground, where they run into a vitrified lump which is left about a fortnight to cool.

© There are four plants, which in the early»part of theif  
growth bear fo ftrong a refemblance to each other, as would de-  
ceive any but the farmers, and very nice obfervers. Thefe four  
are, barilla, gazul (or-as fome call it, algazul), foza, and fali-.  
cornia or falicor, They are all burnt to afhes, but are applied  
to different ufes, as being poffeffed of different qualities, Some  
of the roguifh farmers mix more or lefs of the three lait with  
the firft ; and it requires a compleat knowledge of the colour,  
tafte, and fmell of the afhes, to be able to dete&amp; their kna-  
very.  
  
The ft, Barilla; is fown ‘afreth every year. The» greateft  
height it grows to above ground is four inches: each root pufhes  
out a vaft number of little ftalks, which again are fubdivided  
into fmaller fprigs, refembling famphire, and all together: form  
a large, fpreading, tufted bufh. ‘The colour is bright green;  
as the plant advances towards maturity, this colour dies away,  
‘till it comes to a dull green tinged with brown,  
  
‘ The zd, Gazul, bears the greatett affinity to barilla,’ both  
in quality and appearance ; the principal difference confifts in  
its growing on a ttill drier, falter earth, confequently it is im-  
pregnated with a flronger falt. It does not rife above two inches  
‘out of the ground, fpreading out into little tufts, Its fprigsare  
much flatter, and more pulpy, than thofe of barilla, and are  
ftill more like famphire. It is fown but once in three, four,’ or  
‘five years, according to the foil. i

lour, which it retains to the Jaft.

52 Swinburne’s Travels through Spain,  
  
is very like the barilla of thofe feafons in which the ground has  
been dunged. before fowing. In thofe years of manuring, ba-  
rilla, contrary to its nature, comes up with a tinge of red; and  
when burnt, falls far fhort of its wonted goodnefs, being bitter,  
more impregnated with falts than it fhould be, emitting a dif-  
agreeable fcent if held near the nofe, and raifing a blifter if ap-  
plied for a few minutes to the tongue. The other three f{pecies  
have: always that effect. Barilla contains lefs falts than the  
ethers ; when burnt, it runs into a mafs refembling a {pungy  
ftone, with a faint caft of blue.  
  
‘ Algazul, after burning, comes as near barilla in its outward  
Sppearance, as it does while growing in its vegetable form;  
but if broken, the infide is of a much deeper and more glofly  
blue. Soza and falicor are darker, and almof black within,  
  
of a heavier confiftence, with very little or no fign of fpungi-  
nefs.  
  
« All cthefe.afhes contain a ftrong alkali; but barilla the bef  
and pureft, though not in the greateft quantity. Upon this  
principle, it is the fitteft for making glafs, and bleaching linen ;  
the others are ufed in making foap: each of them would whiten  
linen, but all, except barilla, would burn it. A good crop of  
barilla impoverifhes the land to fuch a degree, that it cannot bear  
  
barilla a fecond feafon, being quite exhaufted. To avoid  
is inconvenience, the richer farmers lay manure upon the  
ground, and let it lie fallow for afeafon ;_at the end of which,  
at is fown afrefh without danger, as the weeds that have fprung  
up in the year of reft, have carried off all the pernicious effects  
of the dung.. A proper fucceflion of crops is thus fecured by  
manuring and fallowing different parts of the farm, each in its  
turn. The poorer tribe of cultivators cannot purfue the fame,  
method, for want of capital, and are therefore under the necef-  
fity of fowing their lands immediately after manuring, which  
yields them a profit juft fufficient to afford a prefent fcanty main-  
tenance, though the quality and price of their barilla be but  
trifling. |  
s.¢ The method ufed in making barilla, is the fame as that  
we follow in the north of England, in burning kelp. The  
nt, as foon as ripe, is plucked up and laid in heaps, then  
fet on fire ; the falt juices run out. below, into a hole made in
