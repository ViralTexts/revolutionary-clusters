wn, the Churches all shut, and nothing remarkable.  
  
The bright rosy morning, peeps over the Hills  
With blushes adorning, the Meadows and Fields.  
  
  
The merry, merry, merry horn, calls come, come away  
Awake from your Slumbers, and hail the new Day.  
  
  
The Stag rous’d before Us, away seems to fly  
And pants to the Chorus of Hounds in full Cry.  
  
  
The follow, follow, follow, follow, the musical Chase  
While Pleasure and Vigour each other embrace.  
  
  
The day Sports being over, makes blood circle right  
And gives the brisk Lover, fresh Charms for the night.  
  
  
Then Let Us, Let us now enjoy, all We can while We may  
Let Love crown the night Boys, as our Sports crown the day.  
  
  
The Banks of the Dee.  
T’was Summer, when softly the Breezes were blowing  
And sweetly the Nightingale sang from the Tree  
At the Foot of a Rock, where the River was flowing  
I sat myself down on the Banks of the Dee.  
  
  
Flow on lovely Dee! flow on thou sweet River  
Thy Bank’s, purest Stream! shall be dear to me, ever  
For then I first gain’d the Affections and favour  
Of Jemmy, the Glory and Pride of the Dee.  
  
  
But now he is gone and has left me, thus mourning  
To quel the proud Tyrant, for valiant is he  
And Ah! there’s nae hope of his speedy returning  
To stroll here again on the Banks of the Dee.  
  
  
He’s gone hapless youth, o’er the wide roaring Billows  
The kindest the sweetest of all the young Fellows  
And has left me to wander among the green Willows  
The loneliest Lass, on the Banks of the Dee.  
  
But time and my Prayers may perhaps yet restore him  
Sweet Peace may return my dear Soldier to me  
And when he returns, with such Care, I’ll watch o’er him  
He n’eer shall again leave the Banks of the Dee.  
  
  
The Dee then shall flow all its Beauties displaying  
The Lambs shall again on its Banks be
