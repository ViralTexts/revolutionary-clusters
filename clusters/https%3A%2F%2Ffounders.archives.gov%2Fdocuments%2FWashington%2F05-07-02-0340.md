happiness.  
The tender concern, which you express on my late illness, awakens emotions which words will not explain, and to which your own sensibility can best do justice—My health is now quite restored, and I flatter myself with the hope of a long exemption from sickness. On Monday next I shall enter on the practice of your friendly prescription of exercise—intending at that time to begin a journey to the southward, during which I purpose visiting all the southern States. Our country, my dear Sir, (and it is truly yours) is fast progressing in its political importance, and social happiness.  
The last session of Congress has been occupied in additional arrangements of finance, to establish the public credit, and provide for the expenditures of government—a small encrease of our military establishment has also been judged necessary, to reclaim, if possible, and to chastise, if required, the irregularities of some indian tribes on the western waters. Your friend, General St Clair resumes his functions as Major General.  
The laws of the United States, adapted to the public exigencies, are framed with wisdom and moderation, and acquiesced in with cheerfulness.
