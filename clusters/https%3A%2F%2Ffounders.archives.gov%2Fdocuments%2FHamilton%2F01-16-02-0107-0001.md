s letter to Washington, read as follows:  
“Resolved, That there be raised, armed, and equipped, fifteen regiments of auxiliary troops, to consist of one thousand men, rank and file, each, with proper officers.  
“Resolved, That the commissioned officers thereof be appointed as other officers of the United States, and that the non-commissioned officers and privates be enlisted for the term of two years; and, with this condition, that if war should break out within that time between the United States and any foreign European Power, they shall be bound to serve for the term of three years, after the commencement of the war, if the same shall so long continue.  
“Resolved, That, in case of such war, the officers of the said regiments shall be entitled to the like pay and subsistence, and to equal rank and command, with the officers of the present Military Establishment of the United States; but, except in such case, shall be entitled to pay only for the time they shall actually attend on the days of training and exercise, hereafter mentioned.  
“Resolved, That each non-commissioned officer and private shall by virtue of his enlistment, be entitled to a bounty, consisting of a suit of clothes per annum, of the value of twelve dollars, and shall also be entitled to a compensation of half a dollar per day, for each day he shall assemble for the purpose of training or exercising; which, except in case of war with some foreign European Power, shall not exceed twenty-four days in one year; and, in that case, each non-commissioned officer and private shall be entitled to the same pay and rations, and shall be subject to the same rules and regulations, as the other troops of the United States.  
“Resolved, That the said regiments shall be furnished with arms and accoutrements at the expense of the United States, to be returned at the expiration of their term of service.  
“Resolved, That revenues by taxes or duties, competent to the purpose of defraying the expense of raising and paying the said troops, be provided.  
  
“Resolved, That within two years and six months after the time which shall be prescribed by law for beginning to enlist the said troops, if no war shall in the mean time break out with any foreign European Power, the regiments aforesaid shall be abolished and cease.  
“Resolved, That the President of the United States be authorized, if in his judgment the safety or welfare of the United States shall require it, to lay an embargo, generally or particularly, upon ships in the ports or harbours of the United States, for a term not exceeding, at any one time, forty days; and also to prohibit, for a like term, generally or particularly, the exportation of commodities from the United States; and such embargo or prohibition to continue, from time to time, until the expiration of fourteen days after the commencement of the session of Congress next ensuing the present.”  
Sedgwick’s resolutions omitted only two of Hamilton’s suggestions—the fortification of ports and a defensive pact among neutrals. Congress was already considering the fortification of ports, and a defensive pact among neutrals was a matter on which the Ho
