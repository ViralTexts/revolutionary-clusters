r her moved many Europeans to sympathy. Raynal and other French philosophes used her, as they used the Good Quaker and the Noble Savage, as yet another weapon in the arsenal of revolution and reform.  
  
The Speech of Miss Polly Baker, before a Court of Judicature, at Connecticut near Boston in New-England; where she was prosecuted the Fifth Time, for having a Bastard Child: Which influenced the Court to dispense with her Punishment, and induced one of her Judges to marry her the next Day.  
May it please the Honourable Bench to indulge me in a few Words: I am a poor unhappy Woman, who have no Money to fee Lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to it to get a tolerable Living. I shall not trouble your Honours with long Speeches; for I have not the Presumption to expect, that you may, by any Means, be prevailed on to deviate in your Sentence from the Law, in my Favour. All I humbly hope is, That your Honours would charitably move the Governor’s Goodness on my Behalf, that my Fine may be remitted. This is the Fifth Time, Gentlemen, that I have been dragg’d before your Court on the same Account; twice I have paid heavy Fines, and twice have been brought to Publick Punishment, for want of Money to pay those Fines. This may have been agreeable to the Laws, and I don’t dispute it; but since Laws are sometimes unreasonable in themselves, and therefore repealed, and others bear too hard on the Subject in particular Circumstances; and therefore there is left a Power somewhat to dispense with the Execution of them; I take the Liberty to say, That I think this Law, by which I am punished, is both unreasonable in itself, and particularly severe with regard to me, who have always lived an inoffensive Life in the Neighbourhood where I was born, and defy my Enemies (if I have any) to say I ever wrong’d Man, Woman, or Child. Abstracted from the Law, I cannot conceive (may it please your Honours) what the Nature of my Offence is. I have brought Five fine Children into the World, at the Risque of my Life; I have maintain’d them well by my own Industry, without burthening the Township, and would have done it better, if it had not been for the heavy Charges and Fines I have paid. Can it be a Crime (in the Nature of Things I mean) to add to the Number of the King’s Subjects, in a new Country that really wants People? I own it, I should think it a Praise-worthy, rather than a punishable Action. I have debauched no other Woman’s Husband, nor enticed any Youth; these Things I never was charg’d with, nor has any one the least Cause of Complaint against me, unless, perhaps, the Minister, or Justice, because I have had Children without being married, by which they have missed a Wedding Fee. But, can ever this be a Fault of mine? I appeal to your Honours. You are pleased to allow I don’t want Sense; but I must be stupified to the last Degree, not to prefer the Honourable State of Wedlock, to the Condition I have lived in. I always was, and still am willing to enter into it; and doubt not my behaving well in it, having all the Industry, Frugality, Fertility, and Skill in Oeconomy, appertaining to a good Wife’s Character. I defy any Person to say, I ever refused an Offer of that Sort: On the contrary, I readily consented to the only Proposal of Marriage that ever was made me, which was when I was a Virgin; but too easily confiding in the Person’s Sincerity that made it, I unhappily lost my own Honour, by trusting to his; for he got me with Child, and then forsook me: That very Person you all know; he is now become a Magistrate of this Country; and I had Hopes he would have appeared this Day on the Bench, and have endeavoured to moderate the Court in my Favour; then I should have scorn’d to have mention’d it; but I must now complain of it, as unjust and unequal, That my Betrayer and Undoer, the first Cause of all my Faults and Miscarriages (if they must be deemed such) should be advanc’d to Honour and Power in the Government, that punishes my Misfortunes with Stripes and Infamy. I should be told, ’tis like, That were there no Act of Assembly in the Case, the Precepts of Religion are violated by my Transgressions. If mine, then, is a religious Offence, leave it to religious Punishments. You have already excluded me from the Comforts of your Church-Communion. Is not that sufficient? You believe I have offended Heaven, and must suffer eternal Fire: Will not that be sufficient? What Need is there, then, of your additional Fines and Whipping? I own, I do not think as you do; for, if I thought what you call a Sin, was really such, I could not presumptuously commit it. But, how can it be believed, that Heaven is angry at my having Children, when to the little done by me towards it, God has been pleased to add his Divine Skill and admirable Workmanship in the Formation of their Bodies, and crown’d it, by furnishing them with rational and immortal Souls. Forgive me, Gentlemen, if I talk a little extravagantly on these Matters; I am no Divine, but if you, Gentlemen, must be making Laws, do not turn natural and useful Actions into Crimes, by your Prohibitions. But take into your wise Consideration, the great and growing Number of Batchelors in the Country, many of whom from the mean Fear of the Expences of a Family, have never sincerely and honourably courted a Woman in their Lives; and by their Manner of Living, leave unproduced (which is little better than Murder) Hundreds of their Posterity to the Thousandth Generation. Is not this a greater Offence against the Publick Good, than mine? Compel them, then, by Law, either to Marriage, or to pay double the Fine of Fornication every Year. What must poor young Women do, whom Custom have forbid to solicit the Men, and who cannot force themselves upon Husbands, when the Laws take no Care to provide them any; and yet severely punish them if they do their Duty without them; the Duty of the first and great Command of Nature, and of Nature’s God, Encrease and Multiply. A Duty, from the steady Performance of which, nothing has been able to deter me; but for its Sake, I have hazarded the Loss of the Publick Esteem, and have frequently endured Publick Disgrace and Punishment; and therefore ought, in my humble Opinion, instead of a Whipping, to have a Statue erected to my Memory

^he Speech of Mifs POLLY  
BAKER, before a court of ju¬  
dicature, at Connefticut near  
Bofton in New-England;  
rvohere Jhe nvas profecuted the  
ffth time, for banting a bafard  
child: nvhich infuenced the  
court to difpenfe nxiith her pu-  
nijhtnent, and induced one of  
her judges to marry her the next  
day.  
  
M A Y it pleafe the honour¬  
able bench to indulge me  
in a few words: I am a poor un¬  
happy woman, who have no  
money to fee lawyers to plead  
for me, being hard put to it to  
get a tolerable living. I (hall  
not trouble your honours with  
Jong fpeeches; for I have not  
the prelumption to expcft, that  
you may, by any means, be  
prevailed on to deviate in your  
fentence from the law, in my  
favour. All I humbly hope is,  
that your honours would chari¬  
tably move the governor’s good-  
r.efs on my behalf, that my fine  
may be remitted. This is the  
fifth time, gentlemen, that I  
have been dragged before your  
court on the lame account; twice  
I have paid heavy fines, and  
twice have been brought to pub-  
lick punilhment, for want of mo¬  
ney to pay thofe fines. This  
may have been agreeable to the  
laws, and I don’t difpute it;  
but fince laws are fometimes

bear too hard on the fubjeft in j  
particular circumftances, and  
therefore there is left a power  
fomewhat to difpenfe with the (  
execution of them ; I take the \
  
liberty to fay, that I think this 1  
  
law by which ] am punifhed, is |  
  
both unreafonable in itfelf, and |

to me, who have always lived an  
inofFcnfive life in the neighbour¬  
hood where I was born, and defy j  
my enemies (if I have any) to fay ;  
1 ever wronged man, woman, |  
or child. Abllrafted from the ^  
law, I cannot conceive (may it f  
pleafe your honours) what the \
nature of my offence is. I have •  
brought five fine children into the  
world, at the rifque of my life ;  
  
I have maintained them well by \
my own indullry, without bur- t  
thening the townfhip, and vvould f  
have done it better, if it had not 5  
been for the heavy charges and  
fines I have paid. Can it be a  
crime {in the nature of things I  
mean) to add to the number of i  
the king’s fubjefts, in a new  
country that really wants people ?  
  
I own it, I fhould think it a  
praife-worthy, rather than a pu-  
nifhable action. I have debauch¬  
ed ho ocher woman’s husband,  
nor enticed any youth; thefe  
things I never was charged with,  
nor has any one the leaft caufe j  
of complaint againll me, unlefs, !

becauie I have had children with- |

mine ? I appeal to your honours.  
You are pleafed to allow I don’t  
want fenfe ; but I muft be ftupi-  
fied to the laft degree, not to pre¬  
fer the honourable ftatc of wed¬  
lock, to the condition I have  
lived in. I always was, and Hill  
am willing to enter into it; and  
doubt not my behaving well in  
it, having all the indullry, fru¬  
gality, fertility, and skill in oeco-  
nomy, appeitajning to a good  
wife’s charader. I defy any  
perfon to fay, I ever refus’d an  
offer of that fort: on the contra¬  
ry, 1 readily confented to the on-  
ly propofal of marriage that ever  
was made me, which was when  
1 was a virgin ; but too eafily  
Confiding in the perfon’s fincerity  
that made it, 1 unhappily loll  
my own honour, by trailing to  
his ; for he got me with child,  
and then forfuok me : l&quot;hat very  
perfon you. all know ; he is now  
become a magillrate of this coun¬  
try ; and 1 Iiad hopes he would  
have appeared this day on the  
bench, and have endeavoured  
to moderate the court in my fa¬  
vour; then I thould havefcorn’d  
to have mcncicn’d it ; but 1 mull  
now complain of ir, as unjull  
and unequal, that my betrayer  
and undocr, the firll caufc of all  
my faults and mifearriages (if  
they mull be deemea luch) Ihould  
be advanc’d to honour and power  
.in the government that puniihes  
my Ini^fcrtu^cs vvith ilnpes and  
infamy. I fhould be told, ’tis  
like, that were there no aft of  
affembly in the cafe, the pre¬  
cepts of religion arc violated by  
my tranfgrefiions. If mine,  
  
then, is a religious offence, leave*  
it to religious punilhinents. You  
have already excluded me froni  
the comforts of your church-com¬  
munion. Is not that fufiicient.^  
You believe I have offended hea-*  
ven, and muft fuffer eternal fire :  
Will not that befufficient ? what  
need is there, then, of your ad¬  
ditional fines and whipping ? I  
own, I do not think as you do ;  
for, if I thought what you call a  
fin, was really fuch, I could not  
prefumptuoufly commit it. But,  
liovv can it be believed, that  
heaven is angry at my having  
children, when to the little done  
by me towards it, God has been  
pleafed to add his divine skill  
and admirable workmanfhip in  
the formation of their bodies,  
and crown’d it, by furnifhing  
them with rational and immor¬  
tal fouls. Forgive me, gentle¬  
men, if I talk a little extrava¬  
gantly on thefe matters; I am no  
divine, but if you, gentlemen,  
mull be making laws, do net  
turn natural and ufeful aftions in¬  
to crimes, by your prohibitions.  
But take into your wife confide-  
ration, the great and growing  
number of batchelors in the coun¬  
try, many of whom from the  
mean fear of the expences of a  
family, have never fincerely and  
honourably courted a woman in  
their lives ; and by their man¬  
ner of living, leave unproduced  
(which is little better than mur¬  
der) hundreds of their pofterity  
to the thoufandth generation. Is  
not this a greater offence againft

You believe I have offended Heaven, and  
muft fuffer eternal Fire: Will not that be  
fufficient? What Need is there, then, of  
your additional Fines, and Whipping. I  
_own, I do not think as you do; for, if I -  
thought what you call a Sing was really  
fuch, I could not prefumptuoufly commit it.  
But, how can it be believed, that Heaven

the little done by me towards it, God has  
been pleafed to add his Divine Skill and  
admirable Workmanfhip in the Formation  
of their Bodies, and crown’d it, by furnifh-

Forgive me, Gentlemen, if I talk a little  
extravagantly on théefe Matters; I ani no  
Divine, but if you, Gentlemen, muft be

have been dragged before your court on the fame account; twice  
1 have paid heavy fines, and twice have been brought to public  
punifliinent, for want of money to pay thofe fines. This may have  
been agreeable to the laws, and I do not difpute it; bai fince

think this law, by which I am punifhed, is both unreafonable ft  
iifelf, and particularly fevere with regard to me, who havealwaVi  
lived an inoflfenfive life in the neighbourh(»od where I was borh,  
and defy my enemies (iff have any)to fay, 1 ever wronged mau‘,  
woman or child. Abflracted from the law, 1 cannot conceive

J have brought five fine children into the world at the rifk of  
i!iy life ; I have maintained them well by my own induflry, with*  
cat burdening the townAnp, and would have done it better, if it  
had nut been for the heavy charges and fines I have paid. Can  
it be a crime (in the mature of things I mean) to add to the nomt  
her of the king’s fnbje&lt;5ls, in a new country that really wanii  
people ? I own it, 1 Ihoiild think it a praife-worihy, rather than  
a punifliabie action. 1 have debauched no other woman’s huf-  
band, nor enticed any youth ; thefe things I never was charged  
with; nor has any one the leaft caufe of complaint againft me, uti-  
lefs, perhaps, the mniiUer or juflice, becaufe 1 have had childreti  
without being married, by which they have miffed a weddiog fee.  
Hat, can this be a.fault of mine? 1 appeal to your.honours. You  
are ])leared to allow I don’t want fenfe ; but I mufl be ftupified  
to the lad degree, not to prefer the honourable (late of wedlock

betrayer and undoer, the firft caufe of all my faults and mKcar*

there no adt of affembly in the cafe, the precepts of religion  
are violated by my tranfgre(lions. If mine is a religions offence,  
leave it to religious puni/limcnts. You have already excluded me  
from the comforts of your church communion. Is not that fufH-  
cient? You believe I have olfendcd heaven, and mud fuffer eternal  
fire; Will not that befuflicient? What need is there, then,.ot  
your additional lines and whipping? I own, I do not think as you  
ilo; for, if t thought wh.it you call a lin was really fuch, I c»uld  
not prefiimptuoudy commit it. But, how can it be believed, that  
heaven is angry at my having children, w’hen to the little done  
by me towards it, Gt)d has been pleafed to add Ms divine fkill and  
ailinlrable workmaniblp in the formation of their bodies, and  
rro vned it, by furnifhing them with rational and immortal fouls?  
Forgive me, gentlemen, if I talk a little extravagantly on thefe  
matters; 1 am no divine, but if yoti, gentlemen, mud be making  
laws, do not turn natural and ufcful actions into crimes, by your&#x27;  
prohibitions. But take into your wife confideration the great and  
growing number of batchelors in the country, many of whom,  
from the mean fear of the cxpenccs of. a family, have never fin*  
cercly and honourably courted a woman in their lives; and by  
their manner of living, leave nnproduced (which is little bettef  
than murder) hundreds of their potlerity, to the thoufandth ge*  
neratioii Is not this a greater offence againft the public good,  
than mine? Compel them, then, by law, either to marriage, or to  
pay double the line of fornication every year. What rouft poor  
young women do, whom cufloth hath forbid to Iblicit the men,&#x27;

ſometimes unreaſonable in themſelves, and there»

with regard ro me, who have always lived an in-  
offen ſive life in the neighbourhood where I was  
born, and defy my enimies (if I have any) to, ſay  
I ever wronged man, woman, or child. Abſtract-  
ed from the law, I cannot conceive (may it pleaſe  
your honours) what the nature of my offence is.  
[ have brought five fine children into the world,  
at the riſque of my life, I have maintained them  
well by my own induſtry, without burghening the

L own it, I ſhould think it a praiſe-worthy, rather  
  
  
other woman&#x27;s huſband, nor enticed any youth;  
  
  
unleſs, perhaps, the minifter or juſtice, becauſe  
J have had children without being married; by  
which they have miſſed a wedding fee. But, can  
ever this be a fault of mine? I appeal to your  
  
  
{  
  
  
L 36 ]  
  
not to prefer the honourable ſtate of wedlock, to  
the condition I have lived in. I always was, and  
ſtill am willing to enter into it; and doubt not  
my behaving well in it, having all the induſtry,  
frugality, fertility, and ſkill in oeconomy, ap-  
pertaining to a good wife&#x27;s character. 1&#x27;defy any  
perſon to ſay, I ever refuſed an offer of that ſort.  
On the contrary, I readily conſented to the only  
propoſal of marriage that ever was made me,  
which was when I was a virgin; but too eaſily  
confiding in the perſon&#x27;s ſincerity that made it, I  
unhappily loſt my own honour, by truſting to his.  
That very perſon you all know; he his now be-  
come a magiſtrate of this country; and I had  
hopes he would have appeazed this day on the  
bench; and have endeavoured to moderate the  
court in my favour; then I ſhould have ſcorued  
to have mentioned it; but I muft now complain  
of it, as unjuſt and unequal, that my betrayer  
and undoer, the firſt cauſe of all my fanlts and  
miſcarriages (if they muſt be deemed ſuch) ſhould  
de advanced to honour and power in the gouvern-

I have offended heaven, and muſt fuffer eternal

it be believed, that heaven is angry at my having

them with rational and immortal ſouls. Forgive  
me, Gentlemen, if I talk a little extravagantly

take into your wiſe confideration, the great and

this a greater offence againſt the publick good,

to marriage, or to pay double the fine of forni-

do, whom cuſtom have forbid to ſolicit the men,  
and who cannot force themſelves upon huſbands, -  
when the laws take no care to provide them any;  
and yet ſeverely puniſh them if they do their duty  
without them; the duty of the firſt and great  
command of nature, and of nature&#x27;s god, Encreaſe,  
Multiply. A duty, from the: ſteady performance  
of which, nothing has been able to deter  
me; but for its ſake, I have hazarded the loſs of  
the publick eſteem, and have frequently endured  
public diſgrace and puniſhment ; and therefore  
ought, in my humble opinion, inſtead of a whip-

the law, in my favour. All I  
humbly hope is, that your honors  
would charitably move the gover-

my fine may be remitted. This  
is the fifth time, gentlemen, that  
I have been dragged before your

86 The

fay, that I think this law, by  
which I am punted, both unrea-

have always lived an inoffenfive  
life in the neighbourhood where I

wronged any’man, woman or child.  
Abftracted from the law, I cannot  
conceive (may it pleafe your ho-

fence is, I have brought five  
children into the world, at the  
rifque of &gt; my life; I have main-  
tained them well by my own in-  
duftry, without burthening the  
townfhip, and would have done  
it better, :f it had not been for the  
heavy charges and fines I have  
paid. Can it be acrime (in the  
nature of things | mean) to add to  
the king’s fubjeéts, in a new coun-

it, I fhould think it rather a praife-

I have debauched no other wo-

by which they have mified a wed-

You are pleafed to allow I don’t

gin; but too eafily confiding in  
the perion’s fincerity that made it,  
L unhappily lof my own honor, by  
trufting to his; for he got me with  
child, and then forfook me.  
That very perfon you all know,  
he is now become a magiftrate of  
this country: ard I had hopes he  
would have appeared this day on  
the bench, and have endeavoured  
to moderate the court in my fa-

Speech of Mifs Polly Baker, before

happy woman, wno have no mo-  
ney to fee lawyers, to plead for  
me, being hard put to it to get a  
tolerable living, I fhall not trou-  
ble your honours with long

ed on to deviate in your lentence

nours would charitably move the  
governor’s goodnefs in my be-  
half, that my fine may be remit-  
ted. This isthe fifth time, gen-  
tlemen, that I have been dragged  
before your court on the fame ac-  
count; twice I have paid heavy  
fines, and twice have been bro’t  
to public panithment, for want  
of money to pay thefe fines. This  
may have been agreeable to the  
laws, and I don’t difpute it: but  
fince laws are fometimes unrea-  
fonable in themfelves, and there-  
fore repealed—and others bear  
too hard on the fubject in parti-  
cular inftances, and therefore  
there is left a power fomewhere  
to difpenfe with the execution of  
them—TI take the liberty to fay,  
that I think this law, by which  
Tam ponifhed, is both unreafon-  
able in itfelf, and particularly  
fevere with regard to me, who  
have always lived an inoftentive  
life in the neighbourhood where  
I was born, and defy my enemies  
(if 1 have any) to fay I ever  
wronged manu, woman, or child.  
  
Abitracted from the law, I can-  
not conceive (may it pleafe your  
honours) what the nature of my  
offence is. I have brought five  
fine children into the world, at  
the cifque of my life. I have  
maintained them well by my own  
induftry, without burdening the  
townthip, and would have done  
it better, if it had not been for  
the heavy charges and fines I  
have paid. Can it be a crime (in  
the nature of things, I mean) to  
add to the number of the king’s  
fubjects, in a new country that  
really wants people? I own it, I  
fhould think it a praifeworthy,  
rather than a punifhable action.  
  
Speech of Mifi Polly Baker.  
  
[ June  
  
I have debauched no other wo  
man’s hufband, nor enticed any  
youth ; thefe things I never was  
charged with, nor has any one  
the leaft caufe of complaint againft  
me, unlefs, perhaps, thé minif-  
ter or juftice, becaufe I have had  
children without being married,  
by which they have mified a wed.  
ding fee. But, can this be a faule  
of mine ?—I appeal to your ho-  
novrs. You are pleafed to allow  
I don’t want fenfe; but I muft  
be ftupified to the lait degree, not  
to preter the the honourable flate  
of wedlock, to the condition J

and doubt not my behaving well  
in it,ha ving all the induftry,fraga-

confented to the only propofal  
of marriage that ever was made  
me, which was when I wasa

it, I unhappily loft my own ho-

fook me. That very perfon you

If mine is a religious offence,

May it please the honourable bench, to indulge me  
  
a few words: I am a poor unhappy woman, who  
we no money to tee lawyers to plead for me, being

„ot trouble your honours with long speeches, for I  
tive not the presumption to expect, chat you may by

ave always lived an inoffensive life in the ne:ghbour-

May it please the honourable bench, to indulge me in a few  
words : I am a poor unhappy woman, who have no money to  
fee lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to it to get a tole-  
rable living.  
I shall not trouble your honours with a long speech, for I  
have not the presumption to expect, that you may by any  
means be prevailed on to deviate in your sentence from the  
law in my favour. All I humbly hope is, that your honours  
would charitably move the gevernor’s goodness on my behalf,  
that my fine may be remitted. 7his is the fifth time, gentle-  
mer, that I have been dragged before your court on the same  
account ; twice Ihave paid heavy fines, and twice have been  
brought to public punishment, for want of money to pay those  
fines. Zhis may have been agreeable to the laws, and I don’t  
dispute it ; but since laws are sometimes unreasonable in  
themselves, and therefore repealed ; and others bear too hard  
on the subject in particular circumstances, and therefore there  
is left a power somewhat to dispense with the execution of  
them, I take the liberty to say, that I think this law, by which  
I am punished, is both unreasonable in itself, and particularly  
severe with regard to me, who have always lived an inoffen-  
sive life in the neighbourhood where I was born ; and defy my  
enemies (if I have any) to say lever wronged man, woman, or  
child. Abstracted from the law, I cannot conceive (may it  
please your honours) what the nature of my offence is.  
  
I have brought five fine children into the world at the risque  
of my life, andhave maintained them well by my own industry,  
without burdening the township ; and should have done it bet-  
  
  
  
| ter, if it had not been for the heavy charges and fines I] have  
  
id.  
“— it be a crime (in the nature of things I mean}to add to  
the number of useful citizens in a new country that really  
wants people ? T own it, I should think it praise-worthy rather  
than a punishable action. I have debauched no other woman’s  
husband, nor enticed any youth: these things I never was  
charged with, nor has any one the least cause ef complaint  
against me, unless perhaps the minister or justice, because I  
have had children without being married, by which they have  
missed a wedding-fee. But can ever this bea fault of mine?  
1 appeal to your honours. You are pleased to allow I don’t  
want sense ; but 1 should be stupid to the last degree, not to  
orefer the honourable state of wedlock, to the condition I  
have lived in. I always was, and am still willing to enter into  
it ; and doubt not my behaving well in it, having all the indus-

was when I| was a virgin ; but too easily confiding in the per-

would have appeared this day on the bench, and have endeav-

scorned to have mentioned it ; but 1 must now complain of it  
as unjust and unequal, that my betrayer and undoer, the first  
cause of all my faults and miscarriages (if they must be deem-

my.  
  
shall be told, ’t is like, that were there no act of assembly  
in the case, the precepts of religion are violated by my trans-  
gressions. If mine then be a religious offence, leave it to reli-  
gious punishment. You have already excluded me from the  
comforts of your church communion : is not that sufficient ?  
You believe I have offended Heaven, and must suffer eternal  
fire ; will ,ot that be sufficient ? What need is there then of  
your additional fines and whippings ? But how can it be believ-  
ed that Heaven is angry at my having children, when to the  
littleftione by me towards it, God has been pleased to add his  
divine skill and admirable workmanship in the formation of  
their bodies, and crowned it by furnishing them with rational

Where I was born; and defy my ene-

mation of their bodies, and crowned it

Forgive me, gentlemen, if I talk a  
little extravagantly on these matters ;  
Iam no divine: but if you, gentlemen,  
must make laws, do not turn natural and  
useful actions into crimes by your pro-  
hibitions. But take into your wise con-  
sideration the great and growing num-  
ber of bachelors in this country, many  
of whom, from the mean fear of the ex-

ly and honourably courted a woman in  
their lives, and by their manner of liv-  
ing, leave unproduced (which is little  
better than murder) hundreds of their  
posterity to the thousandth reneration.

seem, had loved “ not wisely, but too well,”  
for without being married she had become  
a parent, not merely once, but five times!  
On the last occasion she was brought be-  
fore a court of judicature at Connecticut,  
near Boston, in New England, having pre-  
viously been sharply punished. Miss Polly  
deemed her case.a. very hard one, and in  
this instance, like her namesake in the  
‘Beggar&#x27;s: Opera,’ could not refrain from  
saying—  
  
“©@ ponder well, ve not severe ;”  
  
or, what was quite as much to the purpose,  
she addressed her judges as follows :—  
  
“May it please the honourable bench to  
indulge me in a few words: I am a poor un-  
happy woman, who have no money to fee  
lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to it  
to get a tolerable living. I shall not trouble  
your honours with long:speeches; for I have  
not the presumption to expect that you may,  
by any means, be prevailed on to deviate in  
your sentence from the law in my favour.  
All I humbly hope is, that your honours  
would charitably move the governor’s good-  
ness in my behalf, that my fine may be re-  
mitted. This is the fifth time, gentlemen,  
that I have been dragged before your court  
on the same account; twice I have paid  
heavy fines, and twice have been brought to  
public punishment, for want of money to pay  
those fines. This may have been agreeable  
to the laws, and I don’t dispute it; but since  
laws are sometimes unreasonable in them-  
selves, and therefore repealed, and others  
bear too hard on the subject in particular cir-  
cumstances; and therefore there is left a  
power somewhat to dispense with the execu-  
tion of them; I take the oper ar  
I think this law, by which I am punished, is  
both unreasonable in itself, and perkates  
severe with regard to me, who have always  
lived an inoffensive life in the neighbourhood  
where I was born, and I defy my enemies (if  
T have any) to say I ever wronged man, wo-  
man, or child. Abstracted from the law, I  
  
cannot conceive (please your honours) what  
the nature of my offence is. I have brought  
five fine children into the world, at the risk  
of my life; I have maintained them well by

my own industry, without burthening the  
township, and would have done it better if it  
had not been for the heavy charges and fines  
Ihave paid. Can it bea crime (in the na-  
ture of things, I mean) to add to the number  
of the king’s subjects, in a new country, that  
really wants people? I own it, I should  
think it a praiseworthy, rather than a pun-  
ishable action. Ihave taken away no other  
woman’s hushand, nor enticed any youth;  
these things I never was charged with, nor  
has any one the least cause of complaint  
against me, unless, perhaps, the minister or  
justice, because I have had children without  
ing married, by which they have missed a  
wedding fee. But can this be a fault of mine?  
I *ppe to your honours. You are pl  
to allow I don’t want sense; but I must be  
stupified to the last degree not to prefer the  
honourable state of wedlock to the condition  
T have lived in. I always was, and still am  
willing to enter into it; and doubt not my  
behaving well in it, having all the industry,  
frugality, fertility, and skill ir economy, ap-  
pertaining to a good wife’s character. I defy  
any person to say I ever refused an offer of  
that sort: on the contrary, I readily con-  
sented to the only pro of marriage that  
ever was made me; but too easily confid-  
ing in the person’s sincerity that made it, I  
u appily lost my own honour by trusting to  
his; for he forsook me. That very person  
you all know; he isnow become a magistrate  
of this county; and I had hopes he would  
have a this day on the bench, and  
have endeavoured to moderate the court in  
my favour; then I should have scorned to  
have mentioned it; but I must now complain  
of it, as unjust and unequal, that my betray-  
er and undoer, the first cause of all my faults  
and miscarriages (if they must be deemed  
such) should be advanced to honour and  
power in the government, that punishes my  
misfortunes with stripes and infamy. . I  
should be told, ’tis like, that were there no  
act of assembly in the case, the precepts of  
religion are ne my transgressions.  
If mine is a religious offence, leave it to reli-  
gious punishments. You have already ex-  
cluded me from the comforts of your church  
communion. Is not that sufficient? You he-  
lieve I have offended heaven, and must suffer  
eternal fire: will not that be sufficient?  
What need is there, then, of your additional  
fines and whipping? I own, I do not think  
as you do; for, if I —— what you call a sin  
was really such, I could not presumptuously  
commit it. But how can it be believed that  
heaven is angry at my having children, when  
to the little done by me towards it, God has  
been pleased to add his divine skill and ad-  
missbte workmanship in the formation of  
their bodies, and crowned it by furnishing  
them with rational and immortal souls? For-  
give me, gentlemen, if I talk a little extra-  
vagantly on these matters; I am no divine ;  
but if you, gentlemen, must be making laws,  
do not turn natural and useful actions into  
crimes, by your prohibitions. But take into  
wise consideration the great and grow-  
ing number of bachelors in the country,  
many of whom, from the mean fear of the  
expenses of a family, have never sincerel.  
and honourably courted a woman in their

May it please the honorable bench, to in­  
dulge me in a few words :—I am a poor,1  
unhappy woman, who have no money to fee 1  
lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to i  
it to get a tolerable living.  
1 shall not trouble your honors with a ‘  
long speech, for 1 have not the presumption !  
to expect, that you may by any means be \
prevailed on to deviate in your sentence  
from the law, iu my favour. All I humbly  
hope is, that your honours would charitably  
move the governor’s goodness in-my be­  
half, that tny fine may be remitted. This is  
the fifth time, gentlemen, that I have been  
dragged before your court on the same ac­  
count; twice 1 have paid heavy fines, and  
twice have been brought to public punish­  
ment, for want of money to pay those fines.  
This may have been agreeable to the laws,  
and 1 don’t dispute it; but since laws are  
sometimes unreasonable in iberr.sclves, and  
therefore repealed; and others bear too hard  
on the subject in particular circumstances,  
and therefore there is left a power some­  
• what to dispense with the execution of  
| them. I take the liberty to say, that 1 think  
this law, by which 1 am punished, is both  
unreasonable in itself, and particularly se­  
vere with regard to tne, who have always  
, lived an inofiensible life in the neighbour­  
hood where 1 wits born; and defy tny ene­  
j mies, if I have any, to say I ever wronged  
; man, woman, or child. Abstracted from  
the law, 1 cannot perceive, may it please  
lyour honors, what the nature of my of­  
i fence is.  
  
I have brought five fine children into the  
world »t the risk of my life, nnd have main­  
tained them well by my own industry, with­  
out burtheuing the township; and Kliould  
have done it better, if it had not been tor  
the heavy charges and fines I have paid.  
Can it he a crime, in the nature of things,  
I mean, to add to the number of useful cit­  
izens in a new country that really wants  
people ? I own it. I should think it praise­  
worthy rather than a punishable action. I  
have debauched no other woman&#x27;s husband,  
nor enticed any youth : these things I never  
was charged with, nor has any one the least  
cause of coinpiaiut against me, unless per­  
haps the minister or justice, because I have  
had children without being married, by  
which they have missed a wedding fee.—  
But can even this be a fault of mine ? I ap­  
peal to your honors. You arc pleased to  
allow i don’t want sense; but I should be  
stupid to the last degree, not to prefer the  
honourable slate of wedlock, to the condi­  
tion I have lived in. 1 always was, and am  
still willing to enter into it ; and doubt not  
my behaving well iu it, having all the in­  
dustry, frugality, fertility, skill nnd econo­  
my appertaining to a good w ife’s character.  
I defy an£ person to say 1 ever refused an  
offer of that sort. Ou the contrary, 1 read­  
ily consented to the only proposal of mar­  
riage that ever was made to me, which was  
when I was a virgin; but too easily confid­  
ing in the person’s sincerity that made it, I  
unhappily lost my own honour by trusting  
to his. That very person you all know; he  
is now become a magistrate of this country,  
and I had hopes that he would have ap­  
peared this day on the bench, nnd have en­  
deavored ty moderate the couit in my fa­  
vour; then 1 should have scorned to have  
mentioned it; but I must now complain of  
it as unjust and unequal, that my betrayer  
and unduer, the first cause of ull my faults  
and miscarriages, if they must lie deemed  
such, should be advanced to honor and  
power in the government, that punishes my  
misfortunes with stripes and infamy.  
I shall lie told, ’tis likely, that were there  
no net of the assembly in the case, the pre­  
cepts of religion are violated by my trans­  
gressions. If mine then lie a religious of­  
fence, leave it to a religious punishment.—  
You have already excluded me from the  
communion : is not that sufficient ? You  
believe I have offended heaven, and. must  
suffer eternal fire: will not that be sufficient ?  
What need is there then of your additional  
fines ami whipping? But how can it be be­  
lieved that heaven is angry at my having  
children, when to the little done by me to­  
wards it, l&gt;od has been pleased to add bis  
ditino skill and admirable workmanship in  
the formation of their bodies, and crowned  
it by furnishing them with rational and im­  
mortal souls?  
  
Forgive me, gentlemen, if I talk a little  
extravagantly on these matters; I am no di­  
vine; hut if you, gentlemen, must make  
laws, Jo not turn rational and useful ac­  
tion* into crimes by your prohibitions.—  
But take into your wise consideration the  
great and growing number of bachelors in  
ibis country, many of whom, from the mean  
fear of the expenses of a family, have never  
sincerely or honourably courted a woman  
in their lives, and by their manner of living,  
leuve unproduced, wjnch is little better than  
murder, hundreds of their |&gt;osierity to the  
thousandth generation. Is not (his a great­  
er offence against the public good than  
mine ? Compel them then, by law, either  
to marriage, or pay double the fine of for­  
nication every year. What must poor  
young women do, whom custom has forbid  
to solicit men ; and who cannot force them­  
selves on husbands, when the laws take no  
!rare to provide them any; and yet severely  
: punish them if they do their duty without

called on by the authorities for information and ad-  
vice on the subjects with which they are known to  
be familiar.”  
  
SPEECH OF MISS POLLY BAKER.  
  
Delivered before a Court of Judicature, in Connec-  
ticut, wherein she was prosecuted the fifth time  
for having bastard children. From the American  
Museum for March, 1787.  
  
  
  
May it please the Honorable Bench to indulge me  
in a few words. I am a poor, unhappy woman, who  
have no money to fee lawyers to plead for me, being  
hard put to it to get a tolerable living. 1 shall not  
racctt o your Honors with long speeches, nor have I  
the presumption to expect that you may by any  
  
means be prevailed on to deviate in your sentence | o  
  
from the law, in my favor. All that I humbly hope  
is that your Honors will charitably move the Govy-  
ernor’s goodness in my behalf, that my fine may be  
remitted, This is the fifth time, gentlemen, that I  
have been dragged before your Court on the same  
account: twice I have paid heavy fines, and twice  
have been brought to public punishment for want of  
money to pay these fines. This may have been  
agreeable to the laws, and I don’t dispute it; but  
since laws are sometimes unreasonable in them-  
selves, and therefore repealed, and others bear too  
hard on the subjects in particular cases, therefore  
there is left a power somewhere to dispense with  
the execution of them. I take the liberty to say  
that I think this law, by which I am punished, is  
both unreasonable in itself and particularly severe  
with regard to me, who have always lived an un-  
offending life in the neighborhood where I was born,  
and I defy my enemies (if I have any) to say I ever  
wronged man, woman, or child.  
  
Abstracted from the law, I cannot conceive (may  
it please your Honors) what the nature of my of-  
fense is. I have brought five fine children into the  
world, at the risk of my life. I have maintained  
them well by my own industry, without burdening  
the township, and would have done it better, if it  
had not been for the heavy charges and fines I have  
paid. Can it be a crime (in the nature of things, I  
mean) to add to the number of the king’s subjects,  
in a new country that really wants people? I own  
it, I should think it a praiseworthy, rather than a  
punishable action. I have debauched no other wo-  
man’s husband, nor enticed any youth. These  
things I never was charged with; nor has any one  
the least cause of complaint against me; unless, per-  
haps, the Minister or Justice, because I have had  
children without being married, by which they have  
missed a wedding fee. But, can this be a fault of  
mine ?—I appeal to your Honors. You are pleased  
to allow I don’t want sense; but I must be stupified  
to the last degree, not to prefer the honorable state  
of wedlock, to the condition I have lived in. I al-  
ways was, and still am, willing to enter into it; and  
doubt not my behaying well in it, having all the in-  
dustry, fertility, and skill in economy, appertaining  
to a good wife’s character. I defy any person to say  
I ever refused an offer of that sort. On the contra-  
  
, | readily consented to the only proposal of mar-  
riage that ever was made to me, which was when I  
was a virgin; but too easily confiding in the person’s  
sincerity that made it, I unhappily lost my own hon-  
or, by trusting to his; for he got me with child, and  
then forsook me. That very person you all know;  
he is now become a magistrate of this county; and  
I had hopes that he would have appeared this day  
on the bench, and endeavored to moderate the court  
in my favor, Then I should have scorned to men-  
  
  
  
tion it; but I must now complain of it as unjust and  
unequal, that my betrayer and undoer, the first  
cause of all my faults and miscarriages (if they must  
be deemed such), should be advanced to honor and  
  
wer in that government which punishes my mis-  
ortunes with stripes and infamy !  
  
I shall be told, ’tis like, that were there no assem-  
bly in this case, the precepts of religion are violated  
by my transgressions. If mine is a pony oom offense,  
leave it to religious punishments. You have alread  
excluded me from the comforts of your Chuch  
Communion ; is not that sufficient? &#x27; You believe I  
have offended Heaven, and must suffer eternal fire ;  
will not that be sufficient? What need is there,  
then, of your additional fines and ro. 1  
own, I do not think as you do; for if I thought  
what you call a sin was really such, I would not  
SS commit it. But how can it be be-  
ieved that Heaven is angry at my having children,  
when to the little done by me towards it, God has  
been pleased to add his Divine skill and admirable  
workmanship in the formation of their bodies, and  
crowned it by furnishing them with rational and  
immortal souls?  
  
Forgive me, gentlemen, if I talk a little extrava-  
gantly on these matters. Iam no divine; but if you,  
gentlemen, must be making laws, do not turn natu-  
ral and useful actions into crimes, by your prohibi-  
tions. But take into your wise consideration the  
great and growing number of bachelors in the coun-  
try ; many of whom, from the mean fear of the ex-  
penses of a family, have never sincerely and honor-  
ably courted a woman in their lives; and by their  
manner of living, leave unproduced ( which is little  
better than murder) hundreds of their posterity to  
the thousandth generation. Is not this a greater  
offense against the public good than mine? Compel  
them, then, by law, either to marry or to pay double  
the fine of fornication every year. What shall poor  
young women do, whom custom hath forbid to so-  
  
icit the men, and who cannot force themselves upon  
husbands, when the laws take no pains to provide  
them any—and yet severely punish them if they do  
  
| their duty without them ;—the duty of the first great  
  
command of Nature, and of Nature’s God—increase  
and multiply !—a duty from the steady performance  
of which nothing has been able to deter me; but for  
its sake I have hazarded the loss of the public es-  
teem, and have frequently endured public disgrace ;  
and therefore ought, in my humble opinion, instead  
of a whipping, to have a statue erected to my mem

few words. I am a poor, unhappy woman, who have no  
money to fee lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to it to  
get a tolerable living. I shall not trouble your Honors with  
long speeches, nor have I the presumption to expect that you  
may by any means be prevailed on to deviate in your sen-  
tence, from the law, in my favor. All that I humbly hope  
is that your Honors will charitably move the Governor&#x27;s  
goodness in my behalf, that my fine may be remitted. This  
is the fifth time, gentlemen, that I have been dragged before  
your Court on the same account: twice I have paid heavy  
fines, and twice been brought to public punishment for want  
of money to pay these fines. This may have been agreeable  
to the laws, and I don’t dispute it; but since laws are some-  
times unreasonable in themselves, and therefore repealed,  
and others bear too hard in particular cases, therefore there  
is left a power somewhere, to dispense with the execution of  
them. I take the liberty to say that [ think thia law, by  
which 1 am punished, is both unreasonable in itself, and par-  
ticularly severe with regard to me, who have always lived an  
unoffending life in the neighborhood where I was born, and  
I defy my enemies (if 1 have any) tc say | ever wronged man,  
woman, or child.  
  
‘* Abatracted from the law, I cannot conceive (may it please  
your Honors) what the nature of my offense is. I have  
brought five children into the world, at the risk of my life.  
I have maintained them well by my own industry, without  
  
  
  
wife. Many persons are ready to advocate social freedom | the number of the king’s subjects, ina new country that  
and speak in its favor, but will not stand by and defend any really wants poople? I own it, I should think it a praise-  
  
™  
— —~= -  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
worthy, rather than a punishable action. I have debauched.  
no other woman’s husband, nor enticed any youth. These  
things | never was charged with; nor has any one the least  
cause of complaint against me, unless, perhaps, the Minister  
or Justice, because I have had children without being mar-  
ried, by which they have missed a wedding fee. But, can  
this be a fault of mine ?—I appeal to your Honors. You are  
pleased to allow I don’t want sense; but 1 must be stupified  
to the last degree not to prefer the honorable state of wed-  
lock to the condition I have livedin. Il always was, and still  
am, willing to enter into it; and doubt not my behaving well  
in it, having all the industry, fertility and skill in economy,  
appertaining to a good wife’s character. I defy any person  
to say I ever refused an offer of that sort. On the contrary,  
[ readily consented to the only proposal of marriage that ever  
was made to me, whieh was when I was avirgin; but too  
easily confiding in the person’s sincerity that made it, I un-  
happily ldst my own honor by trusting to his; for he got me  
with child, and then forsook me. That very person you all  
know; he is now become a magistrate of this county; and I  
had hop2s that he would have appeared this day on the  
bench, and endeavored to moderate the courtin my favor.  
Then I should have scorned to mention it; but I must now  
complain of it as unjust and unequal, that my betrayer and  
undoer, the first cause of all my faults and miscarriages (if  
they must be deemed such), should be advanced to honor and  
power in that government which puuishes my misfortunes  
with stripes and infamy!  
  
**] shall be told, ’tis like, that were there no assembly in  
this case, the precepts of religion are violated by my trans-  
gressions. If mine is a religious offense, leave it to religious  
punishments. You have already excluded me from the com-  
forts of your Church Communion; is not that sufficient? You  
believe I have offended Heaven, and must suffer eternal fire;  
will not that be sufficient? What need is there, then, of  
your additional fines and whipping? I own, Ido not think  
as you do; forif I thought what you calla sin was really  
such, 1 would not presumptuously commit it. But how can  
it be believed that Heaven is angry at my baving children,  
when to the little done by me toward it God has been pleased  
to add his Divine skill and admirable workmanship, in the  
formation of their bodies, and erowned it by furnishing them  
with rational and immortal souls?  
  
* Forgive me, gentlemen, if 1 talk a little extravagantly on  
these matters. lam no divine; but if you, gentlemen, must  
be making laws, do not turn natural and useful actions into  
crimes, by your prohibitions. But take into your wise con-  
sideration the great and growing number of bachelors in the  
country; many of whom, from the mean fear of the expense  
of afamily, have never sincerely and honorably courted a  
woman in their lives; and by their manner of living, leave  
unproduced (which is little better than murder) hundreds of  
their posterity to the thousandth generation. Is not this a  
greater cffense against the public good than mine? Compel  
them, then, by law, either to marry or to pay double the fine  
of fornication every year. What shall poor young women  
do, whom custom hath forbid to solicit the men, and who  
cannot force themselves upon husbands, when the laws take  
no pains to provide them any—and yet severely punish them  
if they do their duty without them ;—the duty of the first  
great command of Nature, and of Nature’s God—increase  
and multiply !—a duty from the steady performance of which  
nothing bas been able to deter me; but for its sake I have  
hazarded the loss of the public esteem, and have frequently  
endured public disgrace; and therefore ought in my bumble  
opinion, instead of a whipping, to have a statue erected to  
my memory.’”

[From the American Museum for March, 1787. J  
Speech of Miss Polly Baker, deliv­  
ered before a court of Judicature, in  
Connecticut, wherein she was prose­  
cuted the fifth time tor having bastard  
children. “May it please the Hon­  
orable Bench to indulge me in a few

and would have done it better if it had  
not been, for the heavy charges and  
fines I hare paid. Can it be a crime  
(in the nature of things, I mean) to  
add to the king’s subjects, in anew  
country that really wants people ? I  
own it, I should think it a praiseworthy  
rather than a punishable action. I have
