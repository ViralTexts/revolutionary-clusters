WE have been afraid to think. We have felt a reluctance to examining into the grounds of our privileges, and the extent in which we have an indisputable right to demand them against all the power and authority, on earth. And many who have not scrupled to examine for themselves, have yet for certain prudent reasons been cautious, and diffident of declaring the result of their enquiries.  
The cause of this timidity is perhaps hereditary and to be traced back in history, as far as the cruel treatment the first settlers of this country received, before their embarkation for America, from the government at Home. Every body knows how dangerous it was to speak or write in favour of any thing in those days, but the triumphant system of religion and politicks. And our fathers were particularly, the objects of the persecutions and proscriptions of the times. It is not unlikely therefore, that, although they were inflexibly steady in refusing their positive assent to any thing against their principles, they might have contracted habits of reserve, and a cautious diffidence of asserting their opinions publickly. These habits they probably brought with them to America, and have transmitted down to us. Or, we may possibly account for this appearance, by the great affection and veneration, Americans have always entertained for the country from whence they sprang—or by the quiet temper for which they have been remarkable, no country having been less disposed to discontent than this—or by a sense they have, that it is their duty to acquiesce, under the administration of government, even when in many smaller matters gravaminous to them, and until the essentials of the great compact are destroy’d or invaded. These peculiar causes might operate upon them; but without these we all know, that human nature itself, from indolence, modesty, humanity or fear, has always too much reluctance to a manly assertion of its rights. Hence perhaps it has happened that nine tenths of the species, are groaning and gasping in misery and servitude.  
  
But whatever the cause has been, the fact is certain, we have been excessively cautious of giving offence by complaining of grievances. And it is as certain that American governors, and their friends and all the crown officers have avail’d themselves of this disposition in the people. They have prevailed on us to consent to many things, which were grosly injurious to us, and to surrender many others with voluntary tameness, to which we had the clearest right. Have we not been treated formerly, with abominable insolence, by officers of the navy? I mean no insinuation against any gentleman now on this station, having heard no complaint of any one of them to his dishonor. Have not some generals, from England, treated us like servants, nay more like slaves than like Britons? Have we not been under the most ignominious contribution, the most abject submission, the most supercilious insults of some custom house officers? Have we not been trifled with, browbeaten, and trampled on, by former governors, in a manner which no king of England since James the second has dared to indulge towards his subjects? Have we not raised up one family, in them placed an unlimitted confidence, and been soothed and battered and intimidated by their influence, into a great part of this infamous tameness and submission? “These are serious and alarming questions, and deserve a dispassionate consideration.”  
This disposition has been the great wheel and the mainspring in the American machine of court politicks. We have been told that “the word ’Rights’ is an offensive expression.” That “the King his ministry and parliament will not endure to hear Americans talk of their Rights.” That “Britain is the mother and we the children, that a filial duty and submission is due from us to her,” and that “we ought to doubt our own judgment, and presume that she is right, even when she seems to us to shake the foundations of government.” That “Britain is immensely rich and great and powerful, has fleets and armies at her command, which have been the dread and terror of the universe, and that she will force her own judgment into execution, right or wrong.” But let me intreat you Sir to pause and consider. Do you consider your self as a missionary of loyalty or of rebellion? Are you not representing your King his ministry and parliament as tyrants, imperious, unrelenting tyrants by such reasoning as this? Is not this representing your most gracious sovereign, as endeavouring to destroy the foundations of his own throne? Are you not putting language into the royal mouth, which if fairly pursued will shew him to have no right to the crown on his own sacred head? Are you not representing every member of parliament as renouncing the transactions at Running­mede, and as repealing in effect the bill of rights, when the Lords and Commons asserted and vindicated the rights of the people and their own rights, and insisted on the King’s assent to that assertion and vindication? Do you not represent them as forgetting that the prince of Orange, was created King William by the People, on purpose that their rights might be eternal and inviolable? Is there not something extremely fallacious, in the common-place images of mother country and children colonies? Are we the children of Great-Britain, any more than the cities of London, Exeter and Bath? Are we not brethren and fellow subjects, with those in Britain, only under a somewhat different method of legislation, and a totally different method of taxation? But admitting we are children; have not children a right to complain when their parents are attempting to break their limbs, to administer poison, or to sell them to enemies for slaves? Let me intreat you to consider, will the mother, be pleased, when you represent her as deaf to the cries of her children? When you compare her to the infamous miscreant, who lately stood on the gallows for starving her child? When you resemble her to Lady Macbeth in Shakespear, (I cannot think of it without horror)  
  
Who “had given suck, and knew  
How tender ’twas to love the Babe that milk’d her.”  
But yet, who could  
“Even while ’twas smiling in her Face,  
Have pluck’d her Nipple from the boneless Gums,  
And dash’d the Brains out.”  
  
Let us banish forever from our minds, my countrymen, all such unworthy ideas of the King, his ministry and parliament. Let us not suppose, that all are become luxurious effeminate and unreasonable, on the other side the water, as many designing persons would insinuate. Let us presume, what is in fact true, that the spirit of liberty, is as ardent as ever among the body of the nation, though a few individuals may be corrupted. Let us take it for granted, that the same great spirit, which once gave Caesar so warm a reception; which denounced hostilities against John ’till Magna Charta was signed; which severed the head of Charles the first from his body, and drove James the second from his kingdom; the same great spirit (may heaven preserve it till the earth shall be no more) which first seated the great grand father of his present most gracious Majesty, on the throne of Britain, is still alive and active and warm in England; and that the same spirit in America, instead of provoking the inhabitants of that country, will endear us to them for ever and secure their good will.  
  
This spirit however without knowledge, would be little better than a brutal rage. Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak and write. Let every order and degree among the people rouse their attention and animate their resolution. Let them all become attentive to the grounds and principles of government, ecclesiastical and civil. Let us study the law of nature; search into the spirit of the British constitution; read the histories of ancient ages; contemplate the great examples of Greece and Rome; set before us, the conduct of our own British ancestors, who have defended for us, the inherent rights of mankind, against foreign and domestic tyrants and usurpers, against arbitrary kings and cruel priests, in short against the gates of earth and hell. Let us read and recollect and impress upon our souls, the views and ends, of our own more immediate forefathers, in exchanging their native country for a dreary, inhospitable wilderness. Let us examine into the nature of that power and the cruelty of that oppression which drove them from their homes. Recollect their amazing fortitude, their bitter sufferings! The hunger, the nakedness, the cold, which they patiently endured! The severe labours of clearing their grounds, building their houses, raising their provisions amidst dangers from wild beasts and savage men, before they had time or money or materials for commerce! Recollect the civil and religious principles and hopes and expectations, which constantly supported and carried them through all hardships, and patience and resignation! Let us recollect it was liberty! The hope of liberty for themselves and us and ours, which conquered all discouragements, dangers and trials! In such researches as these let us all in our several departments chearfully engage! But especially the proper patrons and supporters of law, learning and religion.  
Let the pulpit resound with the doctrines and sentiments of religious liberty. Let us hear the danger of thraldom to our consciences, from ignorance, extream poverty and dependance, in short from civil and political slavery. Let us see delineated before us, the true map of man. Let us hear the dignity of his nature, and the noble rank he holds among the works of God! that consenting to slavery is a sacriligious breach of trust, as offensive in the sight of God, as it is derogatory from our own honor or interest or happiness; and that God almighty has promulgated from heaven, liberty, peace, and good-will to man!  
Let the Bar proclaim, “the laws, the rights, the generous plan of power,” delivered down from remote antiquity; inform the world of the mighty struggles, and numberless sacrifices, made by our ancestors, in defence of freedom. Let it be known, that British liberties are not the grants of princes or parliaments, but original rights, conditions of original contracts, coequal with prerogative and coeval with government.—That many of our rights are inherent and essential, agreed on as maxims and establish’d as preliminaries, even before a parliament existed. Let them search for the foundations of British laws and government in the frame of human nature, in the constitution of the intellectual and moral world. There let us see, that truth, liberty, justice and benevolence, are its everlasting basis; and if these could be removed, the superstructure is overthrown of course.  
Let the colleges join their harmony, in the same delightful concern. Let every declamation turn upon the beauty of liberty and virtue, and the deformity, turpitude and malignity of slavery and vice. Let the public disputations become researches into the grounds and nature and ends of government, and the means of preserving the good and demolishing the evil. Let the dialogues and all the exercises, become the instruments of impressing on the tender mind, and of spreading and distributing, far and wide, the ideas of right and the sensations of freedom.  
In a word, let every sluice of knowledge be open’d and set a flowing. The encroachments upon liberty, in the reigns of the first James and the first Charles, by turning the general attention of learned men to government, are said to have produced the greatest number of consummate statesmen, which has ever been seen in any age, or nation. Your Clarendons, Southamptons, Seldens, Hampdens, Faulklands, Sidneys, Locks, Harringtons, are all said to have owed their eminence in political knowledge, to the tyrannies of those reigns. The prospect, now before us, in America, ought in the same manner to engage the attention of every man of learning to matters of power and of right, that we may be neither led nor driven blindfolded to irretrievable destruction. Nothing less than this seems to have been meditated for us, by somebody or other in Great-Britain. There seems to be a direct and formal design on foot, to enslave all America. This however must be done by degrees. The first step that is intended seems to be an entire subversion of the whole system of our Fathers, by an introduction of the cannon and feudal law, into America. The cannon and feudal systems tho’ greatly mutilated in England, are not yet destroy’d. Like the temples and palaces, in which the great contrivers of them, once worship’d and inhabited, they exist in ruins; and much of the domineering spirit of them still remains. The designs and labours of a cer­tain society, to introduce the former of them into America, have been well exposed to the public by a writer of great abilities, and the further attempts to the same purpose that may be made by that society, or by the ministry or parliament, I leave to the conjectures of the thoughtful. But it seems very manifest from the S—p A-t itself, that a design is form’d to strip us in a great measure of the means of knowledge, by loading the Press, the Colleges, and even an Almanack and a News-Paper, with restraints and duties; and to introduce the inequalities and dependances of the feudal system, by taking from the poorer sort of people all their little subsistance, and conferring it on a set of stamp officers, distributors and their deputies. But I must proceed no further at present. The sequel, whenever I shall find health and leisure to pursue it, will be a “disquisition of the policy of the stamp act.” In the mean time however let me add, These are not the vapours of a melancholly mind, nor the effusions of envy, disappointed ambition, nor of a spirit of opposition to government: but the emanations of an heart that burns, for its country’s welfare. No one of any feeling, born and educated in this once happy country, can consider the numerous distresses, the gross indignities, the barbarous ignorance, the haughty usurpations, that we have reason to fear are meditating for ourselves, our children, our neighbours, in short for all our countrymen and all their posterity, without the utmost agonies of heart, and many tears.

E have been afraid to think.—We have felt a reluctance to examin-

have an indiſputable right to demand them againſt, all: the power and autho-  
rity, on earth. And many who have not ſcrupled to examine for themſelvcs,  
have yet for certain prudent reaſons been cautious, and diffident of declar-

The cauſe of this timidity is perhaps hereditary and to be traced back in  
hiſtory, as far as the cruel treatment the firſt ſettlers of this country re-  
ceived, before their embarkation for America, from the government at  
Home.—Every body knows how dangerous it was to ſpeak or write in fa-

though they were inflexibly ſteady in refuſing their poſitive aſſent to any  
thing againſt their principles, they might have contracted habits of reſerve;  
and a cautious diffidence of aſſerting their opinions publickly.—Theſe habits  
they probably brought with them to America, and have tranſmitted down to  
ns.—Or, we may poſſibly account for this appearance, by the great affec-  
tion and veneration, Americans have always entertained for the country-from  
whence they ſprang—or by the quiet temper for which they have -been re-  
markable, no country having been leſs diſpoſed to diſcontent than this or  
by a ſenſe they have, that it is their duty to acquicſe, under the adminiftra-  
tion of government, even when in many ſmaller matters gravaminous to  
them, and until the eſſentials of the great compact arc deftroy&#x27;d or invaded.

But whatever the cauſe has been, the fact is certain, we have been exceſ-  
 fively cautious of giving offence by complaining of . grievances. —And it is  
as certain, that American governors, and their friends and all the crown of-  
ficers have avail&#x27;d themſelves of this diſpoſition, in the people.—They have  
prevailed on us to conſent to many things, which were grofly injurious to  
us, and to ſurrender many others with voluntary tameneſs, to which we had  
the cleareſt right. Have we not been treated formerly, with abominable inſo-  
lence, by officers of the navy ?—I mean no inſinuation againſt any gentleman  
now on this ſtation, having heard no complaint of any one of them to his diſ-  
honor. —Have not ſome generals, from England, treated us like ſervants, nay  
more like ſlaves than like Britons ?—Have we not been under the moſt igno-  
minious contribution, the moſt abject ſubmiſſion, the moſt ſupercilious in-  
ſults of ſome cuſtom houſe officers ? Have we not been trifled with, brow-  
beaten, and trampled on, by former gavernors, in a manner which no  
king of England fince. James the ſecond has dared to indulge towards his  
ſubjects ? Have we not raiſed up, one family, in them placed an unlimitted  
confidence, and been ſoothed and flattered and intimidated by their influ-  
ence, into a great part of this infamous tameneſs and ſubmiſſion ?— ——  
&lt;«« Theſe are ſerious and alarming queſtions, and deſerve a diſpaſſionate con-  
ſideration.””— E 5  
  
This diſpoſition has been the great wheel and the mainſpring in the ma-  
chine of court politicks We have been told that the word « Rights” is an  
offenſive expreſſion. That the King his miniſtry and parliament will not  
endure to hear Americans talk of their Rights.” That Britain is the  
mother and we the children, that a filial duty. and ſubmiſſion is due  
from us to her, and that we ought to doubt our own judgment, and  
preſume that ſhe is right, even when ſhe ſeems to us to ſhake the founda-  
tions of government.” That Britain is. immenſely rich and great and  
  
  
dread and terror of the univerſe, and that ſhe will force her own judgment  
into execution, right or wrong.” But let me intreat you Sir to pauſe and  
conſider Do you conſider your ſelf as a miſſionary of loyalty or of rebel-  
lion? Are you not repreſenting your King his miniſtry and parliament as  
tyrants, imperious, unrelenting tyrants by ſuch reaſoning as this ?—Is not  
this repreſenting your moſt gracious ſovereign, as endeavouring to deſtroy  
the foundations of his own throne ?—Are you not putting language into  
  
  
the crown on his own ſacred head? Are you not repreſenting every member  
of parliament as renouncing the tranſactions at Runningmede, and as re-  
pealing in effect the bill of rights, when the Lords and Commons aſſerted  
and vindicated the rights of the people &amp; their own rights, and inſiſted on  
the King&#x27;s aſſent to that aſſertion and vindication? Do you not repreſent  
them as forgetting that the prince of Orange, was created King William  
by the People, on purpoſe that their rights might be eternal and inviolable ?  
Als there not ſomething extremely fallacious, in the common- place images  
of mother country and children colonies? Are we the children of Great  
Britain, any more than the cities of London, Exeter and Bath? Are we  
not brethren and fellow ſubjects, with thoſe in Britain, only under a ſome-

is in fact true, that the ſpirit of liberty, is as ardent as ever among the body  
of the nation, though a few ink wl may be corrupted. Let us take it  
for granted, that the jame great ſpirit, which once gave Cæſar ſo warm a recep-

till the earth ſhall be no more) which firſt ſeated the great grand father of  
his preſent moſt gracious Majeſty, on the throne of Britain, is ſtill alive and  
active and warm in England; and that the ſame ſpirit in America, inſtead of  
provoking the inhabitants of that country, will endear us to them for ever  
and ſecure their good will.  
This ſpirit however without knowledge, would be little better than a bru-

‘ The firft fiep that is intended feems to be an entire fab-  
verfion of the whole fyftem of our fathers, by the introdu@tion  
of the canon and feudal law into America,-—The canon and  
feudal fyftems, though greatly mutilated in England, are not

great contrivers of them once worfhipped and inhabited, they  
exift in ruins; and much of the domineering fpirit of them

We have been afraid to think.—We have felt a re- f  
luctance to examining into the grounds of our privileges,  
  
  
demand them, againſt all the power and authority on  
earth, —And many who have not ſcrupled to examine for  
themſelves, have yet, for certain prudent reaſons, been cau-  
  
  
quiries. | | |  
The cauſe of this timidity is perhaps hereditary, and to  
  
  
barkation for America, from the government at home. —  
Every body knows how dangerous it was, to ſpeak or  
write in favour of any thing, in thoſe days, but the tri-  
umphant ſyſtem of religion and politicks. And our  
fathers were, particularly, the objects of the ns

and proſcriptions of the times. It is not unlikely there-  
fore, that, although they were inflexibly ſteady in refuſing  
their poſitive aſſent to any thing againſt their principles,  
they might have contracted habits of reſerve, and a cau-  
tious diffidence of aſſerting their opinions publicly.—  
Theſe habits they probably brought with them to Ame-  
rica, and have tranſmitted down to us, —Or, we may poſ-  
ſibly account for this appearance, by the great affection  
and veneration, Americans have always entertained for  
the country from whence they ſprang—or by the quiet  
temper for which they have been remarkable, no country  
  
  
ſenſe they have that it is their duty to acquieſce under the  
adminiſtration of government, even when in many ſmaller  
matters grievous to them, and until the eſſentials of the  
great compact are deſtroyed or invaded. Theſe peculiar  
  
  
all know, that human nature itſelf, from indolence, mo--  
deſty, . humanity or fear, has always too much reluctance  
to a manly aſſertion of its rights. Hence perhaps it has  
| happened, that nine-tenths of the ſpecies, ars groaning  
and gaſping in miſery and ſervitude. |  
  
But whatever the cauſe has been, the fact is certain,  
we have been exceſſively cautious of giving offence by  
complaining of grievances. And 1t 1s as certain, that  
American governors, and their friends, and all the crown  
officers, have availed themſelves of this diſpoſition in the  
people. — They have prevailed on us to. conſent to many  
things, which were groſsly injurious to us, and to ſurren-  
der many others with ron ah tameneſs, to which we  
had the cleareſt right. Have we not been treated for-  
  
  
navy {——]I mean no infinuation againſt any gentleman  
now on this ſtation, having heard no complaint of any one  
of them to his diſhonour.— Have not ſome generals, from  
England, treated us like ſervants, nay, more like ſlaves  
than like Britons ?!—Have we not been under the moſt  
ignominious contribution, the moſt abje&amp; ſubmiſſion; the  
moſt ſupercilious inſults of ſome cuſtom-houſe officers ?  
Have we not been trifled with, browbeaten, and trampled  
on, by former governors, in a manner which no King o  
England fince er. the Second has dared to indulge to-  
wards his ſubjects? Have we not raiſed up one family,

placed in them an unlimited confidence, and been ſoothed,  
and flattered, and intimidated by their influence, into a  
great part of this infamous tameneſs and ſubmiſſion ?—  
  
« &quot;Theſe are ſerious and alarming. queſtions, and deſerve a  
diſpaſſionate contideration.” — | | |  
This diſpoſition has been the great wheel and the main  
  
  
have been told, that “ the word Rights is an offenſive  
expreſſion. That “ the King, his Miniſtry, and Par-  
hament, will not endure to hear Americans talk of their  
Kigbts.” That © Britain is the mother and we the chil-  
dren, that a filial duty and ſubmiſſion is due from us to  
her,” and that ve ought to doubt our own judgment,  
and preſume that ſhe is right, even when ſhe ſeems to us  
to ſhake the foundations of government.” That“ Bri-  
tain is immenſely rich, and great, and powerful, has fleets  
and armies at her command, which have been the dread  
and terror of the univerſe, and that ſhe will force her own  
judgment into execution, ws or wrong.” But tet me  
intreat you, Sir, to pauſe—Do you conſider yourſelf as a  
miſſionary of loyalty or of rebellion ? Are you not repre-  
lenting your K—, his Miniftry and Parliament, as tyrants,  
imperious, unrelenting tyrants, by ſuch reaſoning as this?  
Is not this repreſenting your moſt gracious Sovereign,  
as endeavouring to deſtroy the foundations of his own  
throne ?—Are you not repreſenting every Member of  
Parliament as renouncing the tranſactions at Runyn Mead ;  
oo meadow, near Windſor, where Magna Charta was  
igned,] and as repealing in effect the bill of rights, when  
the Lords and Commons aſſerted and vindicated the rights  
of the people and their own rights, and inſiſted on the  
King&#x27;s aſſent to that aſſertion and vindication ? Do you  
not repreſent them, as forgetting that the Prince- of  
Orange was created King William by the People, on pur-  
Py that their rights might be eternal and inviolable !—  
s there not ſomething extremely fallacious, in the com-  
mon place images of mother country and children colo-  
nies? Are we the children of Great Britain, any more  
than the cities of London, Exeter and Bath? Are we not  
brethren and fellow - ubjects, with thoſe in Britain, only  
under a ſomewhat different method of legiſlation, and a  
totally different method of taxation ? But admitting we  
  
are Children, have not children a right to complain when  
12 their  
  
E  
  
parents are attempting to break their limbs, to ac  
niſter poiſon, or to ſel] them to enemies for ſlaves? Let  
me intreat you to conſider, will the mother be pleaſed,  
when you repreſent her as deaf to the cries of her chil-  
dren? When you compare her to the infamous miſ-  
creant, who lately ſtood on the gallows for ſtarving her  
child? When you reſemble her to Lady Macbeth in  
Shakeſpear, (I cannot think of it without horror)  
  
Who © had given ſuck, and knew  
  
« How tender &#x27;twas to love the babe that milk&#x27;d her.“

Let us baniſh for ever from our minds, my countrymen,  
all ſuch unworthy ideas of the K—g, his Miniſtry, and  
Parliament. Let us not ſuppoſe, that all are become  
luxurious, effeminate and unreaſonable, on the other. fide

Let us preſume, what is in fact true, that the ſpirit of  
liberty is as ardent as ever among the body of the nation,  
though a few individuals may be corrupted.— Let. us take  
it for granted, that the ſame great ſpirit, which once gave  
Cæſar ſo warm a reception; which denounced hoſtilities  
againſt John, *till Magna Charta was ſigned ; which

warm in England; and that the fame ſpirit in America,  
inſtead of provoking the inhabitants of that country, will  
endear us to them for ever, and ſecure their good-will.  
This ſpirit, however, without knowledge, would ba  
little better than a brutal rage.

‘ Let the pulpit resound with the doctrines end

he holds among the works of God! that consenting  
  
sive in the sight of God as it is derogatory from  
our own honor, or interest, or happiness; and that  
God Almighty has promulgated from heaven, lib-  
erty, peace, and good willtoman.’  
  
‘Let the colleges join their harmony in the same

priests, in short, against the gates of heaven and hell. Let us read

them search for the foundation of British laws and government in
