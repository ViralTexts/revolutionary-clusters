“Before I close this chapter, it will be proper to examine a question, famous for being often debated, whether foreign nations may receive ambassadors and other ministers of an usurper, and send such ministers to him. Here foreign powers, if the advantage of their affairs invites them to it, follow possession; there is no rule more certain, or more agreeable to the law of nations, and the independency of them. As foreigners have no right to interfere in the domestic concerns of a people, they are not obliged to canvass and inspect its oeconomy in those particulars, or to weigh either the justice or injustice of them. They may, if they think proper, suppose the right to be annexed to the possession. When a nation has expelled its sovereign, the other powers, which are not willing to declare against it, and would not draw on themselves its arms or enmity, consider that nation as a free and sovereign state, without taking upon themselves to determine, whether it has acted justly in withdrawing from the allegiance of subjects and dethroning the prince. Cardinal Mazarine received Lockhart, who had been sent as ambassador from the republic of England, and would neither see King Charles the second, nor his ministers. If a nation after driving out its prince, submits to another,  
  
or changes the order of succession, and acknowledges a sovereign to the prejudice of the natural and appointed heir; foreign powers may here likewise consider, what has been done, as legal; it is no quarrel or business of theirs. At the beginning of the last century, Charles Duke of Sudermania having obtained the crown of Sweden to the prejudice of Sigismund, king of Poland, his nephew was soon acknowledged by most sovereigns. Villeroy, minister of Henry the 4th, King of France, at that court, in a memoir of the 8th of April 1608, plainly said to the President Jeannin; ‘All these reasons and considerations shall not hinder the king from treating with Charles, if he finds it to be his interest, and that of his kingdom.’  
“This was arguing sensibly. The king of France was neither the judge nor the guardian of the Swedish nation, that he should, against the good of his own kingdom, refuse to acknowledge the king, which Sweden had chosen, under pretence, that a competitor termed Charles an usurper. Had it even been done with justice, it does not come under the cognizance of foreigners.  
“Therefore when foreign powers have received the ministers of an usurper and sent theirs to him, the lawful prince, on recovering his throne, cannot complain of these measures, as an injury, nor justly make them the cause of a war; provided these powers have not gone farther, nor furnished any succours against him.

rs. Every alliance, made by a republic, is in its own nature real: for it relates only to the body of the state. When a free people, a popular state, or an Aristocratical republic, concludes a treaty, it is the state itself, that contracts; and its engagements do not depend on the lives of those, who were only the instruments: the members of the people, or of the  
  
regency change, and succeed each other, but the state is always the same.  
Since then, such a treaty directly relates to the body of the state, it subsists, though the form of the republic happens to be changed, and though it should be even transformed into a monarchy: For the state, and the nation are always the same, whatever changes are made in the form of the government; and the treaty, concluded with the nation, remains in force, as long as the nation exists. But it is manifest, that we ought to except from this rule, all the treaties, that relate to the form of government. Thus two popular states
