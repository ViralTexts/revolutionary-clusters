His latter allusion was to the benchmark Article XVI of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which had opened the door for the winds of change, toppled the established church, and left men “equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience.” JM remembered that entering wedge with some satisfaction for (with Mason’s help) he had written that, too.  
  
[ca. 20 June 1785]  
  
To the Honorable the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia A Memorial and Remonstrance  
We the subscribers, citizens of the said Commonwealth, having taken into serious consideration, a Bill printed by order of the last Session of General Assembly, entitled “A Bill establishing a provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,” and conceiving that the same if finally armed with the sanctions of a law, will be a dangerous abuse of power, are bound as faithful members of a free State to remonstrate against it, and to declare the reasons by which we are determined. We remonstrate against the said Bill,  
1.   Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, “that Religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.” The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man can be considered as a member of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governour of the Universe: And if a member of Civil Society, who enters into any subordinate Association, must always do it with a reservation of his duty to the General Authority; much more must every man who becomes a member of any particular Civil Society, do it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no mans right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is, that no other rule exists, by which any question which may divide a Society, can be ultimately determined, but the will of the majority; but it is also true that the majority may trespass on the rights of the minority.  
2.   Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body. The latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of the former. Their jurisdiction is both derivative and limited: it is limited with regard to the co-ordinate departments, more necessarily is it limited with regard to the constituents. The preservation of a free Government requires not merely, that the metes and bounds which separate each department of power be invariably maintained; but more especially that neither of them be suffered to overleap the great Barrier which defends the rights of the people. The Rulers who are guilty of such an encroachment, exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants. The People who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor by an authority derived from them, and are slaves.  
3.   Because it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of Citizens, and one of the noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The free men of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it. Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects? that the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?  
4.   Because the Bill violates that equality which ought to be the basis of every law, and which is more indispensible, in proportion as the validity or expediency of any law is more liable to be impeached. If “all men are by nature equally free and independent,” all men are to be considered as entering into Society on equal conditions; as relinquishing no more, and therefore retaining no less, one than another, of their natural rights. Above all are they to be considered as retaining an “equal title to the free exercise of Religion according to the dictates of Conscience.” Whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess and to observe the Religion which we believe to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to those whose minds have not yet yielded to the evidence which has convinced us. If this freedom be abused, it is an offence against God, not against man: To God, therefore, not to man, must an account of it be rendered. As the Bill violates equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens, so it violates the same principle, by granting to others peculiar exemptions. Are the Quakers and Menonists the only sects who think a compulsive support of their Religions unnecessary and unwarrantable? Can their piety alone be entrusted with the care of public worship? Ought their Religions to be endowed above all others with extraordinary privileges by which proselytes may be enticed from all others? We think too favorably of the justice and good sense of these denominations to believe that they either covet pre-eminences over their fellow citizens or that they will be seduced by them from the common opposition to the measure.  
5.   Because the Bill implies either that the Civil Magistrate is a competent Judge of Religious Truth; or that he may employ Religion as an engine of Civil policy. The first is an arrogant pretension falsified by the contradictory opinions of Rulers in all ages, and throughout the world: the second an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation.  
6.   Because the establishment proposed by the Bill is not requisite for the support of the Christian Religion. To say that it is, is a contradiction to the Christian Religion itself, for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers of this world: it is a contradiction to fact; for it is known that this Religion both existed and flourished, not only without the support of human laws, but in spite of every opposition from them, and not only during the period of miraculous aid, but long after it had been left to its own evidence and the ordinary care of Providence. Nay, it is a contradiction in terms; for a Religion not invented by human policy, must have pre-existed and been supported, before it was established by human policy. It is moreover to weaken in those who profess this Religion a pious confidence in its innate excellence and the patronage of its Author; and to foster in those who still reject it, a suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies to trust it to its own merits.  
7.   Because experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation. During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What have been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy, ignorance and servility in the laity, in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution. Enquire of the Teachers of Christianity for the ages in which it appeared in its greatest lustre; those of every sect, point to the ages prior to its incorporation with Civil policy. Propose a restoration of this primitive State in which its Teachers depended on the voluntary rewards of their flocks, many of them predict its downfall. On which Side ought their testimony to have greatest weight, when for or when against their interest?  
8.   Because the establishment in question is not necessary for the support of Civil Government. If it be urged as necessary for the support of Civil Government only as it is a means of supporting Religion, and it be not necessary for the latter purpose, it cannot be necessary for the former. If Religion be not within the cognizance of Civil Government how can its legal establishment be necessary to Civil Government? What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on Civil Society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the Civil authority; in many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny: in no instance have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty, may have found an established Clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just Government instituted to secure &amp; perpetuate it needs them not. Such a Government will be best supported by protecting every Citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with the same equal hand which protects his person and his property; by neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering any Sect to invade those of another.  
9.   Because the proposed establishment is a departure from that generous policy, which, offering an Asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every Nation and Religion, promised a lustre to our country, and an accession to the number of its citizens. What a melancholy mark is the Bill of sudden degeneracy? Instead of holding forth an Asylum to the persecuted, it is itself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other the last in the career of intolerance. The magnanimous sufferer under this cruel scourge in foreign Regions, must view the Bill as a Beacon on our Coast, warning him to seek some other haven, where liberty and philanthrophy in their due extent, may offer a more certain repose from his Troubles.  
10.   Because it will have a like tendency to banish our Citizens. The allurements presented by other situations are every day thinning their number. To superadd a fresh motive to emigration by revoking the liberty which they now enjoy, would be the same species of folly which has dishonoured and depopulated flourishing kingdoms.  
11.   Because it will destroy that moderation and harmony which the forbearance of our laws to intermeddle with Religion has produced among its several sects. Torrents of blood have been spilt in the old world, by vain attempts of the secular arm, to extinguish Religious discord, by proscribing all difference in Religious opinion. Time has at length revealed the true remedy. Every relaxation of narrow and rigorous policy, wherever it has been tried, has been found to assuage the disease. The American Theatre has exhibited proofs that equal and compleat liberty, if it does not wholly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys its malignant influence on the health and prosperity of the State. If with the salutary effects of this system under our own eyes, we begin to contract the bounds of Religious freedom, we know no name that will too severely reproach our folly. At least let warning be taken at the first fruits of the threatened innovation. The very appearance of the Bill has transformed “that Christian forbearance, love and charity,” which of late mutually prevailed, into animosities and jealousies, which may not soon be appeased. What mischiefs may not be dreaded, should this enemy to the public quiet be armed with the force of a law?  
12.   Because the policy of the Bill is adverse to the diffusion of the light of Christianity. The first wish of those who enjoy this precious gift ought to be that it may be imparted to the whole race of mankind. Compare the number of those who have as yet received it with the number still remaining under the dominion of false Religions; and how small is the former! Does the policy of the Bill tend to lessen the disproportion? No; it at once discourages those who are strangers to the light of revelation from coming into the Region of it; and countenances by example the nations who continue in darkness, in shutting out those who might convey it to them. Instead of Levelling as far as possible, every obstacle to the victorious progress of Truth, the Bill with an ignoble and unchristian timidity would circumscribe it with a wall of defence against the encroachments of error.  
13.   Because attempts to enforce by legal sanctions, acts obnoxious to so great a proportion of Citizens, tend to enervate the laws in general, and to slacken the bands of Society. If it be difficult to execute any law which is not generally deemed necessary or salutary, what must be the case, where it is deemed invalid and dangerous? And what may be the effect of so striking an example of impotency in the Government, on its general authority?  
14.   Because a measure of such singular magnitude and delicacy ought not to be imposed, without the clearest evidence that it is called for by a majority of citizens, and no satisfactory method is yet proposed by which the voice of the majority in this case may be determined, or its influence secured. “The people of the respective counties are indeed requested to signify their opinion respecting the adoption of the Bill to the next Session of Assembly.” But the representation must be made equal, before the voice either of the Representatives or of the Counties will be that of the people. Our hope is that neither of the former will, after due consideration, espouse the dangerous principle of the Bill. Should the event disappoint us, it will still leave us in full confidence, that a fair appeal to the latter will reverse the sentence against our liberties.  
15.   Because finally, “the equal right of every citizen to the free exercise of his Religion according to the dictates of conscience” is held by the same tenure with all our other rights. If we recur to its origin, it is equally the gift of nature; if we weigh its importance, it cannot be less dear to us; if we consult the “Declaration of those rights which pertain to the good people of Virginia, as the basis and foundation of Government,” it is enumerated with equal solemnity, or rather studied emphasis. Either then, we must say, that the Will of the Legislature is the only measure of their authority; and that in the plenitude of this authority, they may sweep away all our fundamental rights; or, that they are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred: Either we must say, that they may controul the freedom of the press, may abolish the Trial by Jury, may swallow up the Executive and Judiciary Powers of the State; nay that they may despoil us of our very right of suffrage, and erect themselves into an independent and hereditary Assembly or, we must say, that they have no authority to enact into law the Bill under consideration. We the Subscribers say, that the General Assembly of this Commonwealth have no such authority: And that no effort may be omitted on our part against so dangerous an usurpation, we oppose to it, this remonstrance; earnestly praying, as we are in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe, by illuminating those to whom it is addressed, may on the one hand, turn their Councils from every act which would affront his holy prerogative, or violate the trust committed to them: and on the other, guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his [blessing, may re]dound to their own praise, and may establish more firmly the liberties, the prosperity and the happiness of the Commonwealth

&#x27;To the Honourable the GENERAL AS-  
SEMBLY of the COMMONWEALTH of  
VIRGINIA. .  
  
A MEMORIAL and REMONSTRANCE.  
E the ſubſcribers, citizens of the (aid  
  
Commonwealth, having taken into  
ſerious conſideration, a bill printed by order  
  
  
entitled, A Bill eftabliſhing a Proviſion for  
Teachers of the Chriſtian Religion,” and  
conceiving that the ſame, if finally armed  
with the ſanctions of a law, will be a dan-  
gerous abuſe of power, are bound as faithful  
members of a free ſtate, to remonſtrate a-  
gainſt it; and to declare the reaſons by which  
we are determined, We remonſtrate againſt  
the ſaid bill, |  
BECAUSE, We hold it for a fundament-  
al and undeniable truth, That religion, or  
the duty which we owe to our Creator, and  
  
  
only by reaſon and conviction, not by force or  
violence.“ The religion then of every man  
muſt be left to the conviction and conſcience  
of every man ; and. it 18 the cight of every  
man to exerciſe it as theſe may dictate.  
This right is in its nature an unalienable  
right. It is unalienable ; becauſe the opin-  
  
  
contemplated by their own minds, cannot  
follow the dictates of other men: It is un-  
  
n  
  
Declaration of Rights, Art. XVI.  
  
4  
alienable alſo; beoauſe what is here a right  
towards men, is a duty towards the Creator.  
It is the duty of every man to render to the  
Creator ſuch homage, and ſuch only, as he  
believes to be acceptable to him; this duty  
is precedent, both in order of time, and in  
degree of obligation, to the claims of civil ſo-  
ciety. Before any man can be conſidered as a  
member of civil ſociety, he muſt be conſider-  
ed as a ſubject of the Governour of the U-  
niverſe: And if a member of civil ſociety,  
vrho enters into any ſubordinate aſſociation,  
muſt always do it with a reſervation of his  
duty to the general authority, much more  
mult every man who becomes a member of  
any particular civil ſociety, do it with a ſav-  
ing of his allegiance to * Univerſal Sove-  
reign. We maintain therefore, that in mat-  
ters of religion, no man&#x27;s right is abridged  
by the inſtitution of civil ſociety ; and that  
religion is wholly exempt from its cogniz-  
ance. True it is, that no other rule exiſts,  
by which any queſtion which may divide, a  
C.ciety, can be ultimately determined, but  
the will of the majority ; but it is alſo true,  
that the majority may treſpaſs on the rights,  
of the minority. ME  
cauſe, If religion be exempt from the  
authority of the ſociety at large, ſtill leſs can  
it be ſubje&amp; to that of the legiſlative body.  
The latter are but the creatures and vicege-  
rents of the former. Their juriſdiction is  
both derivative and limited. It is limited  
with regard to the co-ordinate departments;  
more neceſſarily is it limited with regard to  
the conſtituents. The preſervation of a free  
government requires, not merely that the  
metes and bounds which ſeparate each de-  
  
-  
  
partment of power be invariably maintained,  
but more eſpecfally, that neither of them be  
ſuffered to overleap the great barrier which  
defends the rights of the people. The rulers  
who are guilty of ſuch an encroachment, ex-  
ceed the commiſſion from which they derive  
their authority, and are tyrants. The peo-  
ple who ſubmit to it are governed by laws  
made neither by themſelves, nor by an au-  
thority derived from them, and are ſlaves.  
  
Becauſe, It is proper to take alarm at the  
firſt experiment on our liberties. We hold  
this prudent jealouſly to be the firſt duty of  
citizens, and one of the nobleſt characteriſt-  
icks of the late revolution. The freemen of  
America did not wait until uſurped power  
had ſtrengthened itſelf by exerciſe, and en-  
tangled the queſtion in precedents. They  
ſaw all the conſequences in the principle,  
and they avoided the conſequences by deny-  
ing the principle. We revere this leſſon  
too much ſoon to forget it. Who does not  
ſee that the ſame authority which can eſtab-  
liſh Chriſtianity, in excluſion of all other re-  
Lgions, may eſtabliſh, with the ſame eaſe,  
any particular ſe&amp; of Chriſtians, in exclu-  
ſion of all other ſe&amp;s ? That the ſame autho-  
rity which can force a citizen to contribute.  
three-pence only of his property for the ſup-  
port of any one eſtabliſhment, may force him  
to conform to any other eſtabliſhment, in all  
caſes whatſoever. | |  
  
Becauſe, The. bill violates that- equality  
  
which ought to be the baſis of every law;  
and which is more indiſpenſible, in propor-  
tion as the validity or expediency of any law,  
is more liable to be impeached. If « ajj  
men are by nature equally free and indepen.  
  
b  
dent, “ all men are to be conſidered as en-  
tering into ſociety on equal conditions, as  
relinquiſhing no more, and therefore retain-  
ing no leſs, one than another, of their rights.  
Above all are they to be conſidered as retain-  
ing an ** equal title to the free exerciſe of re-  
ligion, according to the dictates of con-  
N ſcience.t&#x27;” Whilſt we aſſert for ourſelves a  
| freedom to embrace, to profeſs, and to&#x27;ob-  
| ſerve the religion which we believe to be of  
/ | divine origin, we cannot deny an equal free-  
* dom to thoſe, whoſe minds have not yet  
yielded to the evidence which has convinced  
us. If this freedom be abuſed, it is an of-  
fence againſt God, not againſt man: To God  
therefore, not to men, mult an account of it  
be rendered. As the bill violates equalit  
by ſubjecting ſome to peculiar burdens, ſoit  
violates the ſame principle, by granting to  
others peculiar exemptions. . Are the Quak-  
ers and Menoniſts the only ſe&amp;s who think  
a compulſive ſupport of their religions unne-  
ceſſary and unwarrantable? Can their piety  
alone be intruſted with the care of publick  
+ worſhip ? Ought their religions to be endow-  
ed, above all others, with extraordinary pri-  
vileges, by which proſelytes may be enticed  
from all others ? We think too favourably  
of the juſtice and good ſenſe of theſe denom-  
inations, to believe, that they either covet  
pre-eminences over their fellow-citizens, or  
that they will be ſeduced by them, from the  
common oppoſition to the meaſure. |  
| Becauſe, The bill implies, either that the  
civil magiſtrate is a competent judge of reli-  
gious truth ; or that he may employ religion.  
| * Declaration of Rights, Article JI.  
Ar ticle XVI. . |  
  
as an engine of civil 2 The firſt is an  
arrogant pretenſion, falſified by the contra-  
dictory opinion of rulers in all ages, and  
throughout the world: The ſecond an un-  
hallowed perverſion of the means of ſalvation.  
Becauſe, The eſtabliſnment propoſed by  
the bill is not requiſite for the ſupport of the  
Chriſtian religion. To ſay that it is, is a  
contradiction to the Chriſtian religion itſelf;  
for every page of it diſavows a dependence on  
the powers of this world : It is a contradic-  
tion to fact; for it is known that this reli-  
gion both exiſted and flouriſned, not only  
without the ſupport of human laws, but in  
ſpite of every oppoſition from them; and not  
only during the period of miraculous aid,  
but long after it had been left to its own evi-  
dence, and the ordinary care of Providence:  
Nay, it is a contradiction in terms; for a re-  
ligion not invented by human policy, muſt  
have pre- exiſted and been ſupported, before  
it was eſtabliſhed by human policy. It is  
moreover to weaken in thoſe who profeſs this  
religion, a pious confidence in its innate ex-  
cellence, and the patronage of its author;  
and to foſter in thoſe who ſtill reject it, a ſuſ-  
picion, that its friends are too conſcious. of its  
fallacies, to truſt it to its own merits.  
Becauſe, Experience witneſſeth, that eccle-  
ſiaſtical eſtabliſhments, inſtead of maintain-  
ing the purity and efficacy of religion, have  
had a contraty operation. During almoſt  
fifteen centuries, has the legal eſtabliſhment  
of Chriſtianity been on trial. What have  
been its faults ? More or leſs in all places,  
pride and indolence in the clergy ; ignorance  
and ſervility in the laity; in both, ſuperſti-  
tion, bigotry, and perſecution. Inquire ef  
  
  
the teachers of Chriſtianity for the ages in  
which it appeared in its greateſt luſtre ; thoſe  
of every ſect point to the ages prior to its in-  
corporation with civil policy. Propoſe a re-  
ſtoration of this primitive ſtate, in which its  
  
  
of their flocks; many of them predict its  
downfal. On which fide ought their teſti-  
mony to have greateſt weight, when for, or  
when againſt their intereſt ? |  
Becauſe, The eſtabliſhment in queſtion is  
  
  
ment, If it be urged as neceſſary for the  
ſupport of civil government, only as it is a  
  
  
neceſſary for the latter purpoſe, it cannot be  
neceſſary for the former. If religion be not  
within the cognizance of civil government,  
how can its legal eſtabliſhment be ſaid to be  
neceſſary to civil government? What influ-  
ence, in fact have eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhments  
  
  
have been ſeen to erect a ſpiritual tyranny on  
the ruins of the civil authority; in many in-  
ſtances they have been ſeen upholding the  
thrones of political tyranny; in no inſtance  
have they been ſeen the guardians of the li-  
berties of the people. Rulers who wiſhed to-  
ſubvert the publick liberty, may have found  
an eſtabliſhed clergy, convenient auxiliaries.  
A juſt government, inſtituted to ſecure and  
perpetuate it, needs them not. Such a go-  
vernment will be beſt ſupported by protecting  
every citizen in the enjoyment of his religion,  
with the ſame equal hand, which protects his  
perſon, and his property; by neither invad-  
ing the equal rights of any ſect; nor ſuffer-  
ing any ſect to invade thoſe of another.

Becauſe, The propoſed eſtabliſhment is a  
departure from that generous policy; which,  
offering an aſylum to the perſecuted and op-  
  
  
ed a luſtre to our country, and an acceſſion  
to the number of its citizens. What a melan-  
choly mark is the Bill of ſudden degeneracy ?  
Inſtead of holding forth an aſylum to the  
perſecuted, it is itſelf, a ſignal of perſecution.  
It degrades from the equal rank of citizens  
all thoſe whoſe opinions in religion do not  
bend to thoſe of the Legiſlative Authority.  
Diſtant as it may be, in its preſent form, from  
the Inquiſition, it differs from it only in de-  
  
ree. The one is the firſt ſtep, the other the  
aſt, in the career of intolerance. The mag-  
nanimous ſufferer under this cruel ſcourge in  
foreign regions, mult view the Bill as a bea-  
con on our coaſt, warning him to ſeek ſome  
other haven, where liberty and philanthro-  
phy, in their due extent, may offer a more  
certain repoſe from his troubles.  
  
Becauſe, It will have a like tendency to  
baniſh our citizens. The allurements pre-  
ſented by other ſituations are every day thin-  
ning their number. To ſuperadd a freſh  
motive to emigration, by revoking the liber-  
ty which they now enjoy, would be the ſame  
ſpecies of folly, which has diſhonoured and  
depopulated flouriſhing kingdoms, f  
  
Becauſe, It will deſtroy that moderation  
  
  
laws to intermeddle with religion, has pro-  
duced among its ſeveral ſe&amp;s, Torrents of  
blood have been ſpilt in the old world, by  
vain attempts of the ſecular arm to extinguiſh  
religious diſcord, by proſeribing all differen-  
ces in religious opinion. Pime has at length  
  
revealed the“ Htedy//0 Every belax at hi.

of narrow and rigorous policy, wherever it  
has been tried, has been found to aſſuage the  
diſeaſe. The American theatre has exhibit-  
ed proofs, that jos and complete liberty,  
if. it does not wholly eradicate it, ſufficiently  
deſtroys its malignant influence on the health  
and proſperity of the State. If, with the ſa-  
lutary effects of this ſyſtem under our own  
eyes, we begin to contract the bounds of re-  
ligious freedom, we know no name that will  
too ſeverely reproach our folly. At leaſt let  
warning be taken at the firſt fruits of the  
threatened innovation. The very appearance  
of the Bill has transformed“ that Chriſtian  
forbearance, love and charity,” which of late  
mutually prevailed, into animoſities and jea-  
louſies, which may not ſoon be appeaſed.  
What miſchiefs may not be dreaded, ſhould  
this enemy to the publick quiet, be armed  
with the force of a law ? |  
  
Becauſe, The policy of the Bill is adverſe  
to the difiuſion of the light of Chriſtianity.  
The firſt wiſh of thoſe who enjoy this preci-  
ons gift, ought to be that it may be imparted  
to the whole race of mankind. Compare the  
number cf thoſe who have as yet received it,  
with the number ſtill remaining under the do-  
minion of falſe religions ; and how ſmall 1s  
the former? Does the policy of the Bill tend  
to leſſen the diſproportion? No: It at once  
diſcourages thoſe, who are ſtrangers to the  
light of revelation from coming into the re-  
glon of it; and conntenances, by example,  
the nations who continue. in darkneſs, in  
  
  
them. Inſtead of levelling as far as poſſible,  
every obſtacle to the victorious progreſs of  
truth, the, Bill, with an ignoble and unchriſ-  
ti in timidity, would circemſcribe it, with a  
  
11  
wall of defence, againſt the encroachments of  
errour. | | |  
  
&#x27; Becauſe, Attempts to enforce by legal  
ſanctions, acts obnoxious to ſo great a pro-  
portion of citizens, tend to enervate the laws  
in general, and to ſlacken the bands of ſocie-  
ty. If it be difficult to execute any law which  
is not generally deemed neceſſary or ſalutary,  
  
  
valid and dangerous ? And what may be  
the effect of ſo ſtriking an example of impo-  
  
  
thority ?  
Becauſe, A meaſure of ſuch ſingular mag-  
  
  
without the cleareſt evidence that it is called  
for by a majority of citizens: And no ſatis-  
factory method 1s yet propoſed, by which the  
voice of the majority in this cafe may be de-  
termined, or its influence ſecured. ** The  
people of the reſpective counties are indeed  
requeſted to ſignify their opinion reſpecting  
the adoption of the Bill to the next ſeſſion of  
Aſſembly. “ But the repreſentation muſt be  
made equal, before the voice either of the  
Repreſentatives, or of the counties, will be  
that of the people, Our hope is that neither  
of the former will, after due conſideration,  
eſpouſe the dangerous principle of the Bill,  
Should the event diſappoint us, it will fill  
leave us in — that a fair appeal  
to the latter will reverſe the ſentence againſt  
our liberties. |  
  
Becauſe, Finally, © The equal right of  
every citizen to the free exerciſe of his reli-  
gion according to the dictates of conſcience,”  
is held by the ſame tenure with all our other  
rights. If we recur to its origin, it is equal-  
ly the gift of nature; if we weigh its impor-  
  
1 „„ It -  
696 wan

tance, it eannot be leſs dear to us; if we con-  
ſult the. declaration of thoſe rights which  
rtain to the good people of Virginia, as the  
  
  
ſtudied emphaſis. Either then we muſt ſay,  
that the will of the Legiſlature is the 1  
meaſure of their authority, and that in the  
plenitude of this authority, they may ſweep  
away all our fundamental rights; or that  
they are bound to leave this particular right  
  
  
preſs, may aboliſh the trial by jury, may  
ſwallow up the Executive and Judiciary Pow-  
ers of the State; nay, that they may deſpoil  
us of our very right of ſuffrage, and ere&amp;  
  
  
Aſſembly ; or we muſt ſay, that they have no  
authority to enact into law the Bill under con-  
ſideration. We the Subſcribers ſay, that  
the General Aſſembly of this Commonwealth  
have no ſuch authority: And that no effort  
may be omitted on our part againſt ſo danger-  
ous an uſurpation, we oppoſe to it this re-  
monſtrance ; earneſtly praying, as we are in  
duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of  
the Univerle, by illuminating thoſe to whom  
  
  
affront his holy prerogative, or violate the  
truſt committed to them: And on the other,  
guide them into every meaſure which may be  
worthy of his bleſſing, may redound to their  
own praiſe, and may eſtabliſh more jfirml  
the liberties, the proſperity and the happineſs  
of the Commonwealth

A MEMORIAL and REMONSTRANCE.  
  
E the Subfcribers, citizens  
¥ of the faid commonwealth,  
ving taken into ferious confide-  
  
Tation, a bill printed by order of  
the laft feffion of the General Af-  
fembly, entitled, “ a bill eftablith-  
ing @ provifion for teachers of the  
Chriftian religion,” and conceiv-  
  
ing that the fame, if finally armed  
  
with the fanétions of a law, wil]  
be a dangerous abufe of power, are  
bound as faithful members of a  
free State, to remonftrate againft  
it; and to declare the reafons by  
which we are determined. We  
remonftrate againit the {aid bill.  
Becaufe, we hold it for a fun-

‘* that religion or the duty which  
*« we owe to our Creator, and the  
“* manner of difcharging it, can be  
“« direéted only by reafon and con-  
“ vidtion, not by force or vio-  
“lence.”* ‘The religion then of  
every man mutt be left to the con-  
viétion and confcience of evéry  
man ; and it is the right of every  
man to exercife it as thefe may  
diétate. This right is in its ne-  
ture an unalienable right. It is  
unalienable ; becaufe the opinions  
of men, depending enly on the e-  
vidence contemplated by their own  
minds, cannot follow the dittates  
of other men: It is unalienable  
alfo ; becaufe what is here a right  
towards men, is a duty towards the  
Creator. It is the duty of every  
man to render to the Creator fuch  
homage, and fuch only, as he be-  
lieves to be acceptable to hiin ;  
this duty is precedent, both in or  
  
der of time, and in degree of ob-  
ligation, to the claims of civil fo-  
ciety. Before any man can be con-  
fidered as a member of civil focie-  
ty, he muft be confidered as a fub-  
jel of the Governor of the uni-  
verfe: And if a member of civil  
fociety, Who enters into any fub-  
ordinate affociation, mutt always  
do it with a refervation of his du-  
ty to the general authority ; much  
more muft every man who be-  
comes a member of any particu-  
lar civil fociety, do it with a fav-  
ing of his allegiance to the Uni-  
verial Sovereign. We maintain  
therefore, that in matters of reli-  
gion, no man’s right is abridged  
by the inftitution of civil fociety ;  
and that religion is wholly exempt  
from its cognizance. True it is,  
that no other rule exifts, by which  
  
any queltion which may divide  
fociety, can be ultimately deter  
mined, but the will of the majori-  
ty; but itis alfo true, that the ma.  
jority may trefpafs on the rights  
of the minority.  
  
Becaufe, If religion be exempt  
from the authority of the fociety  
at-large, ftill lefs can it be fubjeé  
to that of the Legiflative Body,  
The latter are but ‘the creatures  
and vicegerents of the former,  
Theis jurifdiétion is both deriva:  
tive and limited. It is limited  
with régard to the co-ordinate de.  
partments ; more neceffarily is it  
limited with regard to the confti-  
tuents. The prefervation of a free  
government requires, not merely  
that the metes and bounds which  
feparate each department of pow  
er be invarigbiy maintained; but  
more efpecially, that neither of  
them be fuffered to overleap the  
great barrier, which defends the  
rights of the people. The rulers  
who are guilty of fuch an en-  
croachment, exceed the commif-  
fion from which they derive their  
authority, and are tyrants. The  
people who fubmit to it are go-  
verned by laws made neither by  
themfelves, nor by an authority  
derived from them, and are flaves,  
  
Becaufe, It is proper to take a-  
larm at the firft experiment on our  
liberties. We hold this prudent  
jealoufy to be the firft duty of citi.  
zens, and one of the nobleit charac-  
teriftics of the late revolution. The  
freemen of America did not wait  
till ufurped power had ftrengthen-  
ed itfelf by exercife, and entan-  
gled the queftion in precedents.  
They faw all the confequences in  
the principle, and they avoided the

the confequences by denying the  
  
inciple. We revere this leon  
too much, foon to forget it. Who  
does not fee that the fame authori-  
ty which can eftablifh Chriftiani-  
ty, in exclufion of all other reli-  
gions, may eitablith, with the fame  
cafe, any particalar fect of Chrif-  
tians, in exclufion of all other fects?  
That the fame authority which  
can force a citizen to contribute  
three-pence only of his property  
for the fupport of any one eita-  
blifhment, may force him to con-  
form to any other eftablifhment,  
in all cafes whatfoever ?  
  
Becaufe, the bill violates that  
equality which ought to be the ba-  
fis of every Jaws and which is  
more indifpenfible, in proportion  
asthe validity or expediency of any  
law is more liable to be impeach-  
ed; If “all men are by nature  
  
“equally free and independent,” +  
  
allmen are to be confidered as en-  
tering into fociety on equal condi-  
tions, as relinquifhing no more,  
and therefore retaining no lefs, one  
than another, oi their rights. A-  
bove all are they to be confidered  
aretaining an ** eguad title to the  
“free exercife of religion accord-  
“ing to the diétates of confci-  
“ence.” Whilft we affert for  
ourfelves a freedom to embrace, to  
profefs, and to obferve the religion  
which we believe to be of divine  
origin, we cannot deny an equal  
m to thofe, whofe minds  
  
not yet yielded to the evi-  
  
nee which has convinced us. If  
this freedom be abufed, it is an of-  
fence againft God, not againft man:  
to God therefore, not to men, mutt  
Maccount of it be rendered. As  
the bill violates equality by fub-

je€ting fome to peculiar burdens ;  
fo it violates the fame principle, by  
granting to others peculiar exemp-  
tions. Are the Quakers and Me-  
nonifts the only feéts who think a  
compulfive fupport of their reli-  
gions unneceflary and unwarrant-  
able ? Can their piety alone be  
intrufted with the care of public  
worfhip ? Ought their religions to  
be endowed, above al] others, with  
extraordinary privileges, by which  
profelytes may be enticed from all  
others ? We think too favorably of  
the juftice and good fenie of thele  
denominations, to believe, thatthey  
either covet pre-eminencies over  
their fellow-citizens, or that they  
will be feduced by them, from  
the common oppofition to the mea-  
fure.  
  
Becaufe, the bill implies, either  
that the civil magiftrate is a com-  
petent judge of religious truth ; or  
that he may employ religion as an  
engine of civil policy, © The firft  
is an arrogant pretenfion, falfified  
by the contradi€tory opinions of  
rulers in al! ages, and throughout  
the world: The fecond an unhal-  
lowed perverfion of the means of  
falvation.  
  
Becaufe, the eftablifiment pro-  
pofed by the bill is not requifite  
for the fupport of the Chriftian re-  
ligion. ‘To fay that it is, isa con-  
tradiétion to the Chriitian religion  
itfelf; for every page of it difa-  
vows a dependence on the powers  
of this world : It is a contradic-  
tion to faét ; for it is known that  
this religion both exifted and flou-  
rifhed, not only without the fup-  
port of human laws, but in fpite of  
every oppofition from them; and  
not only during the period of mi

raculous aid, but long after it had  
been left to its own evidence, and  
the ordinary care of providence ;  
nay it is a contradi¢tion in terms :  
for a religion not invented by hu-  
man policy, muft have pre-exilied  
and been fupported, before it was  
eltablithed by human policy. It  
is moreover to weaken in thofe who  
profefs this religion, a pious con-  
fidence in its innaie excellence, and  
the patronage of ite author ; and  
to fofter in thofe who ftill rejeé it,  
a fufpicton, that its friends are too  
contcious of its fallacies, to truit ic  
to its OWN merits.  
  
Becaufe, experience witneffeth  
that ecclefiaftical eftablifhments,  
inftead of maintaining the purity  
and efficacy of religion, have had  
a contrary operation. During al-  
molt fifteen centuries, has the le-  
gal eitablifhment of Chriftianity  
been on trial. What have been  
its fruits? More or lefs in all pla-  
ces, pride and indolence in. the  
clergy ; ignorance and fervility in  
the laity; in both, fuperttition,  
bigotry, and perfecution, In-  
quire of the teachers of Chriftian-  
ity for the ages in which it appear-  
ed in its greatelt lufter ; thofe of  
every fect point to the ages prior  
to its incorporation with civil po-  
licy. Propofe a reftoration of this  
primitive ftate, in which its teach-  
ers depended on the voluntary re-  
wards: of their flocks; many of  
them predict its downfal. On  
which fide ought their teitimony  
to have greateft weight, when for,  
or when againit their intereft ?  
  
Becaufe, the eftablifhment in  
  
ueftion is not neceflary for the  
ont of civil government. If  
it be urged as neceflary for the fup-  
port of civil government, only as  
  
it is a means of {upporting religion;  
and it be not neceilary for the la.  
ter purpofe, 1t cannot be neceflary  
for the former. — If religion be not  
within the cognizance of civil go-  
vernment, how can its legal etta.  
blifhment be faid to be neceflary  
to civil government ? What infle.  
ence, in fac, have eccleiiaftical ¢.  
ftablifhments had on civil fociety?  
In fome inftances they have been  
feen to erect a {piritual tyranny  
on the ruins of the civil authority;  
in many inftances they have been  
feen uphclding the thrones of po.  
litical tyranny; in no inftance  
have they been feen the guardians  
of the liberties of the people. Ru.  
lers who wifhed to {ubvert the pubs  
lic liberty, may have found ane.  
itablifhed clergy, convenient auxis  
liaries. A juit government, infi-  
tuted to fecure and perpetuate it,  
needsthem not. Such a govern-  
ment will be beft fupported by pro.  
tecting every citizen in the enjoy.  
ment of his religion, with the fame  
equal hand, which proteéts his per-  
fon, and his property ; by neither  
invading the equal rights of any  
fect; nor fuffering any fect to im  
vade&#x27; thofe of another.  
  
Becaufe, the propofed eftablih-  
ment isa departure from that gt  
nerous policy ; which, offering an  
afylum to the perfecuted and op.  
prefied of every nation and religi  
on, promifed a lufter to our coum  
try, and an acceflion to the number  
of its citizens. What a melancho  
ly mark is the Bill of fudden dege-  
neracy ? Inftead of holding forth  
an afylum to: the perfecuted, iti  
itfelf, a fignal of perfecution. Is

ative Authority. Diftant as  
it may be, in its prefent form, from  
tie Inquifition, it differs from it  
onlyin degree. The one is the  
fir ftep, the other the laft, in the  
career of intolerance. The mag-  
nanimous fufferer under this cruel  
  
¢ in foreign regions, muit  
view the Bill as a beacon on our  
coat, warning him to feek fome  
other haven, where liberty and  
philanthrophy, in their due extent,  
may offer a more certain repofe  
from his troubies.  
  
Becaufe, it will have a like ten-  
dency to banifh our citizens. The  
allurements prefented by other fi-  
tuations are every day thinning  
theirnumber. To fuperadd a frefh  
motive to emigration, by revoking  
the liberty which they now enjoy,  
would be the fame {pecies of folly,  
which has difhonered and depo-  
pulated flourifhing kingdoms.  
  
Becaufe, it will deitroy that mo-  
deration and harmony which the  
forbearance of our laws to inter-  
meddle with religion, has produced  
among its feveral feéts. Torrents  
of blood have been fpilt in the old  
world, by vain attempts of the fe-  
cular arm to extinguifh religious  
difeord, by profcribing all diffe-  
fences in relipious opinion. Time  
has at length revealed the true re-  
medy. Every relaxation of nar-  
tow and rigorous: policy, wherever  
ithas been tried, has been found  
to afluage the difeafe. The Ame-  
tican theater has exhibited proofs,  
  
~ that&#x27;equal and compleat liberty, if  
  
it does not wholly eradicate it, fuf-  
ficiently deftroys its malignant in-

bounds of religious freedom, we  
know no name that will too fevere-  
ly reproach our folly. At leaft let  
warning be taken at the firft fruits  
of the threatened innovation... The  
very appearance of the bill has  
transformed “ that Chriflian for-  
“* bearance love and charity,” which  
of late mutually prevailed, into  
animofities and jealoufies, which  
may not foon be appeafed. What  
mifchiefs may not be dreaded,  
fhould this enemy tothe public  
quiet, be armed with the force of  
alaw?  
  
Becaufe, the policy of the bill  
is adverfe to the diffufion of the  
light of Chriftianity. ‘The firit  
with of thofe who enjoy this pre-  
cious gift, ought to be that it may  
be imparted to the whole race o&#x27;  
mankind. Contpare the number of  
thofe ‘who have as yet received it,  
with the number ftill remaining  
under the dominion of falfe religi-  
ons ? and how {mall is the former?  
Does the policy of the bill tend to  
leffen the difproportion ? No: It  
at once difcourages thoie, who are  
ftrangers to the light of revelation  
from coming into the region of it ;  
and countenances, by example, the  
nations who continue in darknefs,  
in fhutting out thofe who might  
convey it to them. Inftead of le.  
velling as far as poflible, every ob-  
ftacle to the victorious progrefs of  
truth, the Bill, with an ignoble and  
unchriftian timidity would circum-  
fcribe it, with a wall of defence,  
againft the encroachments of error.  
  
Becaufe, attempts to enforce by  
legal fanctions, aéts obnoxious to  
fo great a proportion of citizens,  
tend to erer” .: the laws in gene-

cate any law which is not general-  
ly deemed neceflary or falutary,  
what muit be the cafe, where it is  
deemed. invalid and dangerous?  
And what may be the effect of fo  
ftriking an example of impotency  
in the government, on its general

Becaufe, a meafure of fuch fin-  
gular magnitude and delicacy ought  
mot to be impoled, without the  
cleareft evidence that it is called for  
by a majority of citizens: And no  
fatisfattory method is yet propofed,  
by which the voice of the majority  
in this cafe may be determined, or  
its influence fecured. ‘ The peo-  
** ple of the refpective countics are  
** indeed requetted to fignify their  
** opinion reipecting the adoption  
“ of the Bill to the next feilon of  
** Afilembly.” But the reprefenta-  
tion muit be made equal, before  
the voice either of the Reprefenta-  
tives, or of the counties, will be  
that of the people. Our hope is  
that neither of the former will, af-  
ter due confideration, efpoufe the  
dangerous principle of the Bill.  
Should the event difappoint us, it  
will full leave us in full confidence,  
that a fair appeal to the latter will  
reverie the fentence againft our li-  
berties.  
  
Becaufe, finally, ‘* The equal  
“ right of every citizen to the tree  
*« exercife of his religion accordiag  
** to the dictates of confcience,” is  
held by the fame tenure with all  
our otherrights. If we recur to its  
origin, it is equally the gift of na-  
ture ; if we weigh its importance,  
it cannot be lefs dear to us; if we  
confult the declaration of thofe  
** rights which pertain tothe good  
  
“* people of Virginia, as the bafs  
** and foundation of government,”  
it is enumerated with equal folem.

Either then we mutt fay, that the

meafure of their authority, and that  
in the plenitude of this authority,  
they may {weep away all our fun.  
damental rights ; or that they are  
bound to leave this particular right  
untouched and facred : either we  
muft fay, that they may control  
the freedom of the prefs, may abo.

they may defpoil us of oury

E the fub(cribers, citizens of  
the faid commonwealth, hav-  
ing taken into ferious coniideration,  
  
a bill printed by order of the lait fef-  
  
fion of the general affembly, entitled  
  
** a bill effabliining a provifion for  
  
teachers of the chriflian religion,’’  
  
and conceiving thatthe fame, tf final-  
ly armed with the fanction of a law,  
will be a dangerous abufe of power,  
  
are bound, as faithtul members of a  
  
fre: flate, to remonitrate again{t it;  
  
and to declare the reafons by which  
we are determined.— We remonflrate  
againit the faid bull,  
  
1. Becaufe, we hold it for a funda-  
mental and undeniable truth, ** that  
religion, or the duty which we owe to  
our Creator, andthe manner of dif-  
charging tt, can be ‘‘ direfted only  
by reafon and convittion, not by  
force or violence.’’* The religion,  
then, of every man, mift be left to  
the conviftion and confcience of eve-  
ry man; and it isthe right of every  
man to exercife it, as thefe may dic-  
tate. This rightis, in tts mature, an  
unalienable mght. It isunalenable ;  
becaufe the op:mons of men, depend-  
ing only on the evidence, conremplat-  
ed by ther own minds, cannot follow  
the diftates of other men. It i un-  
alienable alfo, becaufe what is here a  
right towards men, is a duty towards  
the Creator, [tts the duty of every  
mau, to render to the Creator fich ho-  
mage, and fuch only, as he bclieves  
io be acceptable to him—rhis duty is

of civil fociety. Before any man can’  
be contidered as a member of cwil  
fociety, he mult be conlideréd as a  
{ubject of the Governor of the uni-  
verte. And if a member of civil  
fociety, who enters into any fubor-  
dinate affociation, muft always do it,  
with a refervation of his duty to the  
general authority ; much more muit  
every man, who becomes a member of  
any particular civil fociety, do it with  
a faving of his allegiance to the Uni-  
verfal Sovereign. We maintain, there-  
fore, that, in matters of religion,  
no man’s right is abridged by the  
inftirution of civil fociety ; and that  
religion is wholly exempt from its  
cognizance, ‘True it is, that no other  
rule exifts, by which any queftion,  
which may divide a fociety, can be  
ultunately determined, but the will of  
the majority; but it is alfo true, thac  
the majority may trefpafs on the rights  
of the minority.

the authorny of the fociety at large,  
fill lefs can it be fibjett co that of the  
legiflative body, The latter are but  
the creatures and vicegerents of the  
former, Their jurifdiétion is both  
derivative and linited, Ie is limited  
with regard to the co-ordinate depart-  
ments ; more neceffarily is it hited,  
with regard to the conflituents, The  
prefervation of a free government, re-  
quires, not merely that the metes and  
bounds, which feparate each depart  
ment of power, be invariably main-  
tained : but more efpecrally that nei-  
ther of them be fuffered to overleap  
the great barrier, which defends the  
righis of the people. The rulers, who  
are ginlty of fuchon encroachment, exe  
ceed the commiffion, from which they  
derive their authority—and are tyrants,  
The people, who fubmit to it, are go-  
verned by laws, made neither by them-  
felves, nor by an anthority derived  
from them—and are flaves,

principle. We revere this leffon too  
much, foon to forget it. Who does  
not fee, that the fame authority, which  
can eltablith chriftianity, in exclufton  
of all other religions, may eftablith,  
with the faine eafe, any particular fect  
of chriftians, in exclufion of all other  
feéts ? That the fame authority, which  
can force a citizen to contribute three  
nce only of his property, for the  
upport of any one eflablifhment, may  
force him to conform to any other ef-  
tablifiment, in all cafes whatfoever P  
4. Becaufe,the bill violates that equa-  
lity which ought to be the bafis of eve-  
ry law; and whichis more indifpen-  
fable, in proportion as the validity, or  
expediency of any law, is more liable  
to be impeached. If ** all men are,  
by nature, equally free and indepen.  
dentt’’ a!l mcm are to be confidered,  
as entering into fociety on equal con-  
ditions, as relinquifhing no more, and  
therefore retaining nole(s, one than an-  
other, of their rights. Above all,  
are they to be conlidered, as retaining  
an ** equal title to the free exerci fe of  
religion according to the dictates of  
con{ciencet.”, Whilft we affert,  
for ourfelves, a freedom to embrace,  
to profefs, and to obferve the reli-  
gion, which we believe to be of di-  
Vine origin—we cannot denyan equal  
freedom to thofe, whofe minds have  
not yet yieldedto the evidence, which  
has convinced us. _ [f this freedom be  
abufed, it is an offence againtt God,  
not againft man—to God, therefore,  
not to men, mult an account of it be  
rendered, As the bill violates equa-  
lity, by fubjeGting forme to peculiar  
burdens ; fo st violates the fame prin-  
ciple, by granting to others peculiar  
exemptions. Are the quakers and  
menoni{ls, the only feéts, who think a  
compulfive fupport of their religions,  
unneceflary and unwarrantable ? Can  
their piety alone be intriufted with the  
care of public worhhip ? Ought their  
religions to be endowed, above all  
others, with extraordinary privileges  
by which profelytes may be enticed  
from all others ? We think too favour-

5. Becaufe, the bill wnplies, either  
that the civil magiftrate 1s a compe.  
tent judge ofreligioustruth ; or that  
he may employ religion, as an engine  
of civil policy, The firft is an arro-

The fecond, an unhallowed perver-  
fion of the means of {alvation.  
  
6. Becaufe, the eltablilhment, pro-  
pofed by the bill, is not requifite, for  
the fupport of the chriflian religion.  
To fay that itis, ts a contradiction to  
the chriftian religion itfeif—for every  
page of it difavows a dependence on

contradiction to fatt—for it isknown,

portof human laws, but in fpite of  
every oppofition from them; and uot  
only during the period of miraculous  
aid, but long after 1 had been left to  
its own evidence, and the ordinary  
care of providence. Nay itis a con-  
tradiction in terms—for a religion, not

was eftablifhed by human policy. It

port of civil government. If it be ur-  
wed,as neceflary for the {opport of civil  
government, only as a means of fup-  
porting religion; and it be not necef-  
{ary for the latter purpofe, it cannot  
be neceflary for bx former. If re-  
L gion be not within the cognizance of  
evil government, how can its Iegal  
eliabl fhment be faidto be nece Mary co

in fact, have ecclefiaflical eflablith-  
ments had on civil fociety P—IJn fome  
saliances, they have been feen to

of the civil authority—in many in-  
fiances, they have been feen uphold-  
ing the thrones of political tyranny—  
tn noiniiance have they been feen  
the guardians of the liberties of the  
people. Rulers who wifhed to fub-  
vert the public liberty, may have found  
an eflablifhed clergy, convenient aux-  
iliacies. A juft government, inihi-  
tuted co fecure and to perpetuate it,  
needs them not. Such a government  
will be beil fupported, by protecting  
every citizen inthe enjoyment of his  
religion, with the fame equal hand,  
which protetis his perfon, and his pro-  
perty; by neither invading the equal  
rights of any feét; nor fuffering any  
fett to invade thofe of another.

ment is a departure from that generous

berty and philanthropy, im their due  
extent, may offera more certain repote  
from his troubles,  
  
10. Becaufe, it will have a tendency  
to banith our citizens. The allire-  
ments, prefented by other fituations, are  
every day thinning their number. To  
fuperadd a frefh mode to emigration,  
by vevoking the hberty which they  
now enjoy, would be the fame {pe-  
cies Of folly, which has dilhoneured  
aud depopulated flour:fhing kingdoms.  
  
11. Becaufe, it will deflroy that tiro-  
deration and harmony, which the for-  
bearance of our laws, to intermeddle  
with religion, has produced among its  
feveral feéis. ‘Torrents of blood have  
been [Spilled in the old world, by  
vain attempts of the fecular arm, to  
extinguifh religious difcord, by pro-  
fcribing all differences in religious o0-

the true remedy, Every relaxation  
of narrow and rigorous policy, where-  
ever it hasbeen tried, has been found  
to affuage the difeafe. The Amer&#x27;-  
can theatre has exhibited proofs, that  
equal and complete liberty, if it does  
not wholly eradicate it, fuflicient!y  
deflroys its malignant influence, on  
the health and profperiiy of the flate.  
If, with the falutary effc&amp;ls of this  
fyilem under our own eyes, we  
begin to contraéithe bounds of re-  
ligious freedom, we know no name,  
that will too feverely reproach our  
folly. At leaft, let warning be tak-  
en, at the firft fruits of the threatened  
innovation, The very appearance of  
the bill has transformed ** that chrif-  
tian forbearance, love and charity.’”  
which of late mutually prevailed, m-  
to animofities and jesloufies, which  
may not foon be appealed. What  
mifchiefs may not be Deoied. fhould  
this enemy to the public qmet, be  
armed with the force of a law ?  
  
12. Becaufe, the policy of the bill is  
adverfe to the diffufion of the light  
of chriliannty., The firlt with of  
thofe, who enjoy this precious gift  
ought to be, that it may be imparted  
to the whole race of mankind, Com-

tend to leflen the difproportion ?—  
No!—It at once difcourages thofe,  
who are itrangersto the light of re-  
velation, from coming into the re-  
gion of it ; and countenances, by ex-  
ample, the nations, who continue in  
darknefs, in fhutting out thefe who  
might convey it to them, Inftead of  
levelling, as far as polhible, every ob-  
flacle to the victorious progref of  
truth, the bill with an tgnoble and  
unchriflian umidity, would circum-  
{cribe it, with a wall of defence, a-  
gainft the encroachments of error.  
13. Becaufle, attempts to enforce,

commonweal h hi ,ag taken imo serious  
consideration ? n il, printed by order of the  
last session of gener • mo mb y. entitled “ A  
bill est.inlislung a provisi m for teachers cf  
the chris.ian religion ; * -tod conceiving,  
that the .-ante, if fm Jiy m mod with the

a 11 ee f;taTe% to rein iiistrate Hgamtc ir,  
hndry deci.tre -fie reasons by which we are  
determined. . We remonstrate against the  
said bill, ,  
  
i because w« hold it for a fundamental and &#x27;  
unalienable trtnh, «• that religion, or thedu­  
ty which v/e owe to the Creator, and the  
manner of discharging it, can be directed  
only by reason and conviction, not by force  
or Violence.*’• The religion, then, of eve.  
ry man, must be left to the conviction and  
conscience* of every, .man ; ,,j»nd it is tli«  
right of every..man to exercise it, as these  
may dictate. \This right is, in its nature, an  
unalienable right.. It is unalienable; be­  
cause the opinions of meu depending’only  
on the evidence contemplated by&lt; their own  
minds, cannot follow the . dictates of other  
men It is unalienable, also ; because what  
is here a right towards man, is a duty to­  
wards the Creator. It is the duty of every  
man to render to the Creator such homage,  
•ifi l such only, as he believes to be accepta­  
b e to him. 1 his duty is precedent, both in  
order of lime, and in degree of ob igation, to  
the chums of civil society. Before any man  
can be considered as a member of civil so  
ciety. he must be considered is a subject of  
the Governor of the universe. And if a  
j member of civil s«,ciety, who enters into any  
; subordinate association, naast always do it  
i with &amp; itserva.ion of his duty to the gene­  
I authority ; much more must every man,  
I who becomes a member ot anv particular  
civil society, do it with a saving&#x27;of his alkgi  
| ance to the universal Severe gn. VVe main  
tain theiciore, that, in matiers of religion,  
no man’s right is abridged by the institutil  
on ot civil society ; and that religion is whol  
ly exempt from its cogn zmcc. True it is  
that no other rule exists, by which any ques  
i t)on which may divide a society can tie ul  
timately datermined, but by the will of  
I the majority. But it is also true that the  
i majority may trespass on the rights of the  
j mmority  
Because, if religion be exempt from the  
authority of the society at large, still less can  
it be subject to that of the legislative body,  
the latter are but the creatures and vice  
gerents of the former.. Their jurisdiction is  
both derivative and limited. It is limited  
with regard to the co-ordina*e departments :  
moie necessarily, it is limited with regard to  
the constituents. The preservation of a free  
government require?, not merely that the  
metes and bounds which separate each de  
p igment of power, be invariably maintain  
, 1 ,but ™ove especially.&#x27; that neither of  
them be suffered to overleap the great barri  
er which detcnJs the rights of ihe people.  
I he rulers wh » are gmliy of SUQh an en  
croachment, exceed the commission from  
which they derive their authority, and&lt;are  
tyran.s, 1 he people who submit to it, are  
governed by laws made neither by them -  
veives, nor by an authority derived from them,,  
ana are slave*.  
  
Because it h proper to take alarm, at the  
Hirst experiment on nur liberties. We hold  
this prule.it jealousy, to be the first duty of  
citizens, and one of the noblest character!*­  
,tics of the hue revolution, The freemen of  
America did no*. wait until usurped power  
had strengthened itself by exercise, and en­  
tangled the* question in precedents They  
stw a 1 the Consequences it) the principle,  
and they avoided the consequences by deny­  
ing the pi inciple VV e mvere this lesson too  
much, soon to forget it. Who does not sc.:  
that the same authority which tan es abUVi  
Christianity in exclusion ot all other religi­  
ons, may establish, with tile same esse, uny  
particular sect ot Christians, m ^aclusion of  
all ot,!; r sects f I hat the same authority  
which Can force a C&#x27;titen to contribute three  
police only ol his property, for the support  
.of any one establishment, in ly force him to  
conform to any other establishment, in allj  
• Crises whatsoever.  
Ujcausc the bill violates that equality  
which ought to l»e the basis of eveiy law ;  
and wh cu is more indispensible, in propnr  
tion as the validity or expediency of any law  
is more liable to be impeached. *• If all  
men are,by nature, equally free and hide.,  
pendent, ( &lt;11 men are tube Coos deed a&gt;  
entering into society on eqoil conditions, as  
relinquishing no more, and therefore retain­  
mgno less, one than another, or their nitu­  
ral rights : above all, nre they to be consid­  
ered as retaining an •• et/ual title to the free  
exe’ Cise of religion according, to the die *  
* n-cl .ration of Wights, article 15.  
t Uc.Uralica of lliglqe, article 1  
  
tates of conscience, •*$ Whilst tre ass-rt fcr  
ourielvcs a freeJom to embrace, to profess,  
and observe the religion which we believe to  
l*e of divine origin ; we cannot deny an equal  
tieedom to tholte whose miuds have not yet  
yielded to the evidence which has cnnvinc  
ns. It this freedom be abused, it is an  
offence against God. not against man. To  
Ciod. therefore, and not to man, must an ac  
count of it he rendered.  
As the bill violates equality, by subject.  
&#x27;®8 some to peculiar burdens ; so it mo  
lates the same principle &#x27;qy granting toothers,  
peculiar exemptions. Are the Quakers 8c  
Mcnonists the only sectn who think a co n  
pulsive support of their religions uon-cessa.  
r&gt; and unwarrantable f Can their piety nl!  
j lone be entrusted wit.t the care of public !

.vorably oft he justice and good sense of the-e !  
denominations, to believe, that they either  
covet pre-eminences over their fellow citi­  
Bens, or that they will be seduced by them •  
from the common opposition to the niea- i  
Bure  
Because the bilfc implies,- either that the  
civil magistrate is a competent judge of re  
llgious truths, or that he may employ religi.  
on as an e igint of civil poliev Tne first is  
an arrogant pretension, falsified by the ex.  
traoi dinary opinion of rulers, in all ages, and  
throughout the world ; the second, an un.  
hallowed psrversiou Ufthe means of salvafi  
on. &#x27; _ . 1 ..  
Because the establishment proposed by  
the b 11 is nit requisite for the support -of  
the Christian religion. I o say that it is, is  
a contradiction to the chrisiian religion it  
, seif ; for ev«ry page of it disavows a depen  
;deuce on the power of this world ; it is- a  
| contradiction to tact, for it is- known that  
i -his ieligion both existed and fi jurislied, not  
only without the support ol human laws, but  
in spite of everv opposition from them ; and  
nut only during the period of miraculous aid,  
but long after it had been left to its own e  
vidence and the ordinary care of Providence :  
nay, it is a contradiction in terms ; for a  
religion not invented by human policy must  
| have pre existed and been supported,&#x27; before  
it was established by hum m pojicy ; it i3  
moreover io weake i in those who profess  
tins Religion a pious c&lt;in(i ience in its innate  
; excellence and the patronage of its author;  
■ a™| lo foster in those who still reject it, a sus,  
pic ion that its friends a’re too conscious of us  
fallacies, to trust it to its own merits.  
Because experience witnesses, that eccle  
stastical establishments, instead of main  
tabling the purity and efficacy of religion,  
have had a contrary opei aiiou. During hI  
most fitieen centuries Iia3 the legal csta_  
bhshmeni of Christianity Ireeu on trial._  
Wliat have been its fruits ? moiV or less in  
all places, pride and indolence in the cler  
gy ; ignorance and servility in the laity; in  
both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution  
fc*nquire ol the teachers of Christianity for  
the ages in which it appeared in its great  
est lustre ? those of every sect point to the  
ages prior to its incorptr ation w,th civil po

voluntary rewards of their flocks, m tny of  
them predict its downfall- On which side  
ought their testimony to have greyest  
weight, when for, or when against their in  
terest ?  
  
Because the establishment in question, is  
nf&gt;i necessary tor the support ot civil gov­  
ernment. It it be uvg«d as necessary fot tae  
support of Civil government, only as it is a

said to be necessary to civil government ?_.  
\\ hat influence in fact have ecclesiastical  
establishments had on civil society? In  
some instances they have, been seen to e_  
rect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the  
civil authority ; in more instances have they  
been seen upholding the thrones of political  
tyranny i in no instance have thev been seen  
the guardians ot the liberties of the people  
Rulers who wish to subvert the public li’  
berty, may have found an established cler  
gy convemenr auxiliaries. A just govern  
went instituted.to secure and perpetuate it,  
needs them no . Such a government will  
be best supported by protecting every citi  
sen in the enjoyment .»f hi* religion, with  
the same equal hand which protects his per  
so., and his property ; by neither invading  
the equal right?of any sect, nor suffering  
any sect to invade those of another. •  
Because the proposed establishment is a  
tleparture from that generous poliev, which,  
offering an asylum to toe persecu *d and op­  
pressed of every nation and religion pro  
m;sed a lustre to our country, and an acces  
sion to the number of its citizens. What a  
melancholy mark is the bill of sudden de­  
generacy ? Instead of holding forth an asy  
him to the persecuted, it is itself a signal of  
persecution. It degrades from the equal  
i anil of citizens all those whose opinions in  
religion do not bend to those of the 1-gisla­  
uve authority. Distant as it may be, in its  
piesent lorm, from the inquisition* it ditfe s  
trom it only in degree: me one ii the first  
: step, the other the last, in the career of in  
j tolerance. The magnanim ms sufferer un  
j der the cruel scourge in foreign regions,  
must view the bill a* a beacon on. our eoist  
warning him to seek some other haven  
where Imerty and philanthropy ,n their due  
t-x.ent may offer a more certain repose fruin  
his troubles.  
  
Because it will have a like tendency to  
b.io.sh o„r citizens. 1 he allurements pre  
sen.i . by other situations, are every day  
thinning their number. To superadd a fresh  
motive to emigration, by revoking the liber­  
ty winch they now enjoy, would be tnesame  
species of folly, which h is dishonored an I  
dep ipulaud tl lurishing kingdoms,  
Hmuse it Will ties roy that moderation  
and harmony, which the forbearance of our  
lawn to intermeddle with religion tins n:„­

re axation of narrow and rigorous poocy.  
wheiever it has been tried, has been found  
toassaage th« disease. The American the­  
atre lias exhibited proof*, that equal and  
co nplete liberty, if it does not wh &gt;lly era­  
dicate it, sufficiently destroys its malignant I  
Influence on the health and prosperity of in® 1

sys em under our own ey es, we begin u.con I

busies which may not soon be appeased.*  
I \v’hut niischiefs may not be dreaded, should .  
■ his enemy to the public quiet, be armed with  
the force of a law ?  
Because the policy of the bill is adverse  
[n the diffusion o‘ the light of chriailaintv_  
1 lie first wish cf those who oug’u *o cujoy  
this precious g-fi ought to be. &quot;that, it may  
be imparted to the whole nice of mankind.  
Compare the number of those, who have us  
vet received it. with the number still re­  
maining under the dominion cf false t el:gi­  
ons, and how small is die former ! Does  
tiie policy of the b ll tend to lessen die dis­  
proportion? No j it at once discourage  
those whoare s rangers to the light of tru li,  
from coming into the regions of it ; and coon ..  
ten incus by example, the nations who con­  
tinue in darkness, in shutting out those who  
might convey it to them Instead of level­  
ling as fir as possible every obstacle to the  
victorious progress of tru*h, the bill with an  
ignoble and unchristian timidity, would cir„  
cimscribe it with a wall of defence against  
die encroach men&#x27;s if error. *  
Because uttempts to enforce by legal sanc­  
tions, acts, obnoxious to so great a propor­  
tion of citizens, tend to enervate the law.  
in general, and to slacken rhe bands of so­  
ciety.- .If it be difficult to execute any law,  
which is not generally deemed necessary or  
salutary, what must be the case where it is  
deemedinvalid and dangerous? And what  
may be the effect of so striking an example  
ot Impoteney in the government on its gene­  
ral authority t  
• Because a measure of such singular mag­  
nitude and delicacy, ought not to be imposed,  
without the clearest evidence that it is cal­  
l&lt; d for by a nuffirity of citizens ; and no sa­  
tisfactory method is yet proposed by which  
the voice of the majority in this case may  
be determined, or its influence secured.—  
*/ l people of the respective counties are  
indeed requested to signify their opinion  
respecting the adoption of the bill, to the  
next session of assembly.” But the repre­  
sentation must be made equal, before the  
voice either of the representatives or of the  
counties, will be that of the people. Our  
hope is that neither of the former, will af­  
ter due consideration espouse the dangerous  
principle of the bill Should the event dis„  
appoint us, it will still leave us in full confi­  
dence, that a fair appeal to the latter will  
reverse the sentence against our liberti­  
es. ...  
  
Because finally, &#x27;‘the equal right of every  
citizen to the f*ee exercise of his religior*  
according to «.he dictates of conscience&#x27;,” is  
held by the same tenure with all our other*  
rights. It we recur to its origin, it is equal *  
ly the gift nl nature ; if we weigh its im­  
portance, it cannot be less dear to us; if  
[Consult the “ Declaration of those rights,  
i which pertain to the good pe .pie ..f Vitgi­  
oia, as the basts and found e ion of govern­  
ment it is enumerated with equal so­

Hither then we must say, that the wdl of  
the legislature is the only rr.easur- r,t their  
authoi tty ; and tjiat, io the plenitude ofthia  
authority, they may sweep away all or fun*

Becaufe the propofed eftablifhuent ia a

which, offering an aGylum to the perfe

and religion, promifed a luflre to our

tled A bill establishing a prvisio i fr

duty which we owe to the Creator, and the  
manner of discharging it, can be directed  
only by reason and convietion Th re­  
ligion, then, &#x27;of every man, must be left to  
the conviction k consciences of every man  
and it is the right ot every man to exercise  
it, as these may dictate. This right Is, in  
its nature, an unalienable right. It is un­  
alienable i because the opinions of men de .  
pending only on the evidence contemplated  
by their own minds cannot folio the dic­  
tates of other men. It is unalienable, alsjj  
because what is here a righ&#x27; towards man  
is a duty towards, the Creator. It it the  
duty of every man to render to the Crea&#x27;or

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
WE, the suoscribers, citizens of the said  
Commonwealth, having taken into considera­  
tion a bill, printed by order of the last Session  
of General Assembly entitled * A bill estab-  
WsHing a provision for teachers of the Chris:  
tian reiigion ;”* and conceiving that the same,  
if finaiiy armed with the sanctions of a law,  
will be a dangerous abuse of power ; are  
bound as faithful members of a free State  
to remonstrate against it, and to declare the  
reusons by which we are determined. We  
remonstrate against the said bill,  
Because we hold it for a fundamental and  
unalienable truth, that religion, or the duty  
which we owe to the Creator, and the man­  
ner of discharging ity can be directed only by  
reason and comviction, not by ferce or vio­  
lence.®* I&#x27;he rveligion, then, of every man,  
must be felt to the conviction and conscience  
  
of every man ; and it is the right of every  
an to exercise it as these may dictate. This  
:“;g‘m is in its nature, an unalienable right. It  
isrunalicnable ; because the opinions of men  
depending only upon the evidenie contem­  
plated by their own minds, cannot follow the  
dictates of other men. 1t is unulienable, also ;  
becuuse what is here right towards man is a  
duty towurds the Creator. It is the duty of  
eveiy tan to render to the Creator’such hori­  
age, and such on&#x27;y, us he belicves to be uc­  
ceptable to him. This duty is precedent,  
both in order of time, and in degree of obli­  
gution, 1o Ihe claimns of civil socicty Belore  
any man cun be considiered as u member of  
civil society, he must be considered as a sub­  
ject of the Governour of the Universe. And  
Lf r member of civil sociely, who enters into  
any subordinate association, must always do  
it with a reservation ol his duty to the gener­  
-8l wuthority ; much more must every man  
who becomes a member of any particular  
civil sociery, do it with a saving of his allegi­  
ance 1o the universal Sovereign. We muin­  
t.anm, theretore, that in matters of religion no  
man’s vight ig ahridged by the instituiion of  
civil society : und that religion is wholly ex­  
empt from its cognizance. True it is, that  
no other rule exisws by which any question  
‘which may divide a society cun be ultimately  
determined, but by the will of the majority.  
But it is also true, that the majority may  
trespass on the rights of the minority.  
Becuuse, if religion be exempt from the  
authority o 1 society at large, stilY less can it  
be subject to thut ol the Legislative body.  
The latter are but the creatures and viceger­  
ents of the former. Their jurisdiction is  
both derivative and limited. It is limited  
with regard to the co-ordinute departm.ents ;  
more necessarily, it is limited with regurd 10  
the constituents. The preservation of o free  
government requires not merely that the  
metes and bounds which seperate e«ch de­  
partinent of power, be invariably maintained;  
but more especiailly that neither of them be  
suffered 10 overleap the great barrier which  
delends the rights of the people. T&#x27;he ru­  
lers who are gwity of such an encroachment  
exceed the comuission from which they de­  
rive their authority, and ure tyrants. 7The  
people whu submit o ity are governed by  
laws mdde neither by themselves, nor by un  
suthority devived from them, and are slayes.  
Because it is proper te tuke alarm at the  
first experiment on our liberties. We hold  
this piudeant jealousy 1o be the first duty of  
ciizens, and one ot the noblest characteris­  
ticks of the lute revolution. The freemen of  
Aierica did not wait until usurped power  
hod screngrhened itself by exercise, and en­  
tunigled the quesiion in precedents. They  
saw all consequences in the principle, and  
they avoided the consequences by denying  
the principle. We revere this lesson too  
much, soon to forgit it. Who does not see  
that the same authority which cun establish  
christianity in exciusivn of all other religions  
may estublish, with the sume case, any par­  
ticuar sect of christians, in exclusion of all  
other sects ! That the same authority which  
can force a citizen to contvibute three pence  
only of his property, for the support of any  
one establishment, may forge him to conform  
to uny other establishment, in all cases what­  
socver.  
  
Because the bill violates that equality which  
ought to be the basis of every law ; and which  
is more Indispensable, in proportion as the  
vilidity or expediency of any law is more liu­  
ble to be impeached. “ If all meh are, by  
naturey equally free and independent,”} ali  
men are to be considered as entering into go­  
ciety on equal conditions, as relinquishing no  
more, and therelore retaining no lgss, one  
than another, or their natural rights ; above  
all, are they to be considered as retaining an  
“ equal iitle to the dictates of conscience.”}  
Whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to  
embruce to profess and obscrve the, religion  
which we believe 10 be of divine origin ; we  
cannot deny an ejual freedom to those whose  
minds have not yet yielded to the evidence  
which has convinced us, If this freedom be  
abused, it is an offence aguinst God, not a­  
gatost man. To God, therefore, and not to  
Iy must an accoqnt of it be rendered.  
As the il violates equality; by subjecting  
songe to pecuiiar burdens ; so it violates the  
same principle by graming to other, peculiut  
exemptions. Are the Quukers and Menon-

ists the enly secte whe think a compulsive  
support of their religions unnecessary and  
unwarrantable 7 Can their piery alone be en­  
trusted with the care of publick worship ?  
Ought their religions 1o be endowed, sbove  
all others, with extraordinury privileges, by  
which proselytes may be enticed from all oth­  
ers ! We think 0o fuvourubiy of the justice  
and guod sense of these denominations, to  
believe, that they either covet pre-eminances  
over their fellow citizens, or that they will  
be seduced by them from the commmon oppo­  
sition 10 the measure,  
Because the bill implies, either that the  
  
civil magistrute is a competent judge of re­  
ligious truths, or that he may empioy relig­  
ion as an engine of civil policy. Vhe fiist is  
an arrogunt pretension, falsified by the ex­  
travrdinary opinion of rulers, in all uges, und  
throughout the world ; the second, an unhal­  
lowed perversion of the meuns of salvation,  
Becuause the establishment proposed by the  
bill is not requisite for the support of the  
chrisuian religion. To suy that 1t is, is a gon  
tradiction to the christian religion itself ; for  
every page of it disuvows a dependence of  
the power of this world ; it is a contradic­  
[ tion to fact, for it is known that this religion  
~ both existed and flourished, not only without  
the support of human laws, but in spite of  
every opposition from them and not only dur­  
ing the period of miraculous aid, but long al­  
ter it had been left to its own evidence and  
the ordinary care of Providence : nay, it is a  
contradiction in terms ; for a religion not in­  
vented by human policy must have pre-exis  
ted and been supported, before it was estub­  
lished by human policy ; it 18 morcover to  
weaken in those who piofess this religion a  
pious confidence in Its innate excellence and  
the patronage of its author ; and 1o foster, in  
those who still reject ity a suspicion that ns  
friends are too conscious of its fallucies to  
Lrust 1t to its own merits. |  
Because expericnce witnesses, that eccle­  
siastical estublishments, instead of muintain­  
ing the purity and effi uy of religion, have  
had a contrary operauon. During almost  
fifteen centuries has the legal establishment  
of chrisuanity been on tial==What have  
been its fruits, more or less 1w all places  
pride and indolence in the clergy ; ignorauce  
and servility ‘in the laity ; in buthy supersti­  
tion, bigotry, und persecution. Enquire ol  
the téuchers of christiunity for the ages in  
which it appeared in its greatest lustre !  
those of every sect point to the ages prior to  
its incorporation with civil poiicy. Propose  
a restoration of this primitive state, in which  
its teachers depend on the voluntary rewards  
of tneir flocks, many of them predict its  
downfall. On which side ougnt their testi­  
mony to have greatest weight, when for or  
when against their interest !  
Because the establishment in quest.on. is  
not necessary for the support of civil gov­  
ernment=—lt it be urged as necessary ior  
the support of civil government, only as it  
is a means of supportung religion, and it be  
not necessary tor the latter purpose, it cannot  
be necessary for the former. 1f religion be  
not within the cognizance of civil govern­  
ment, how can its legal establishment be said  
to be necessary to civii government ! What  
influence in tact huve ecciesiastical establisn­  
ments had on civil society ! In some instan­  
ces they have bLeen seen to erect a spiritual  
tyranny on the ruine of the civil authority :  
In mote instunces have they been seen up­  
hoiding tue thrones of political tyranny ; 1  
no instance have they been seen the guardi­  
ans oi the liberties of thg people. Rulers,  
who wish 0 subve:t the pubiick liberty, may  
have found an established clergy convenient  
  
suxilaries. A just government, instivued  
10 secure and pcrpetuate ity needs them not.  
Such a government will be best supported  
by protecting every cilizen in the enjoyment  
of his religion, with the same eyuai hand  
which protects his person and his property ;  
by neither invading the equal rights of uny  
secty nor suffering any sect to invade those of  
another. -  
  
Because the proposed establishment is a  
departure from that generous policy, which,  
offering an asylum to the persecuted and op­  
pressed of every nation and religion, promai­  
sed a lustre to our country, and an accession  
  
10 the number of its citizens. What a mes  
  
lancholy mark is the bill of sudden degener­  
acy ! lostead of holding forth an asylum to  
the persecuted, it is itselt a signal of perse­  
cution. . It degrades from the equal rank of  
citizens all those whose opinions in rehgion  
do not bend to those of the legislative auth­  
ority. Distant as it may be, In its present  
torm, from the inquisition, it differs from it  
only in degree : the one is the first step, the  
other the last in the carcer of intolerance.  
  
The magnanimous sufferer under the cruel  
scourge in foreign regions, must view the  
bill as u beacon on our coast, warning him to  
seek some other haven, wßere liberty and  
philanthropy ia their due exXtent may offer a  
more certain repose from his troubles.  
Because it will have a like tendency to  
banish our citizens. The allurements pre-  
  
sented by other situations are every day thin­  
ning their number.~To superadd a fresh  
motive to emigration, by revoking the liberty  
  
they now enjoy, would be the same species  
of folly, which has dishonoured and depopu­  
lated flourshing Kingdems. /  
Because it will destroy that moderation dnd  
narmony, which the forbearance of our laws  
  
to intermeddle with religion has produced  
imong its several sects. Torrents of blood  
aave been spilt in the old world, by vain at­  
tempts of the seculiar arm to extinguish re­  
iig&#x27;ous discord by proscriding all differences  
in religious opinion. Time has at length re­  
vealed the true remedy. Every relaxatior of  
wriow and rigorous roliry. wherever it has  
been tried, has been found to assuage the d s­  
case. The American theatre has exhivited  
  
proofs, that equal and complete liberty, if it  
“does not whelly eradicate it, sufficiently des­  
treys its malignant influence on the heulth  
and prosperity of the state. If with the sal­  
utary efiects of this system under our own  
cyes, we begin to contract the bounds of re­  
ligious freedom, we know ne name that will  
oo severely reproach our folly. At least let  
warning be taken at the hrst fruits of the  
threatened innovation. The very appearance  
of the bill has wansformed that “ christian  
forbearance, love and charity,”* which of  
late mutually prevalled into animosities and  
jealousies which muy not soon be uppeased.  
What mischiefs may not be dreaded, should  
this enemy to the publick quiet be armed  
with the force’of a law ? °  
Because the policy of the biil is adverse to  
the diffusion ol the light of christianity   
‘The first wish of those who ought to enjoy  
this precious gift ought to be, that it may be  
imparted to the whole race of mankind.  
Compare the number of those, who have as  
yet received ity with the number still remain­  
g under the dominion of false religions,and  
bow smull is the former { Does the policy of  
the bill tend 10 lessen the disproportion? No;  
it at once discourages those who ure strang­  
ers to the light of truth from coming into  
the regions of it ; and countenances by ex­  
amiple the nations who continue in darkness,  
in shutting out those who might convey it  
to them. Instead of levelling as far as pos­  
sible every obstacle to the vigorous progress  
of truth, the bill, with an ignoble and un­  
christigp timidity, would circumscribe it with  
a wull ot delence against the encroachments  
of errvor.  
  
Becuuse attempts to enforce,by legal sanc­  
ticns, wcts, ebnoxious 1o so great a propor­  
tion of citizens, tend to enervate the laws in  
peneraly and 1o slacken the bands of society.  
It it be difficult to execute any law, which  
is not generally deemed necessary or salutary  
what mrust be the case where it is deemed  
invalid and dangerous ! And what may be  
the effect of so siriking an example of im­  
potency in the government on its general  
authority ?  
Because a measure of such singular mag­  
nitude and delicacy ought not to be imposed,  
without the clearest evidence that it 1s called  
ior by a majority of citizegs ; and no satis­  
tactory method is yet proposed by which the  
voice of the majority in this case may be de­  
termined, or its influence secured. ¢ The  
peopie of the respective counties ure indeed  
requested to signify their opinions respecting  
the adoption ot the bill to the next session of  
assembiy.” But the representation must be  
made equal, before the voice either of the  
representatives or of the counties will be  
that of the people. Our hope is that neither  
of the former will after due consideration es­  
pomse the dangerous prnciple of the bill.  
Should the event disappoint us, it will still  
leave us in full confidence, that a fair appeal  
to the latter will reverse the sentence against  
our liberties.  
  
Because, finally, “ the equal right of every  
citizen to the free exercise of his religion ac­  
cording to the dictates of conscience,” is  
held by the same tenure with all our other  
rights. If we recur to its origin, it is equal­  
ly the gitt of nature ; if we weigh its imyor­  
tance, it cannot be less dear to us ; if we  
cousult the * Declaration of those rights  
which pertain to the good people of Virginia  
as the basis and foundation of government,”  
it is enumerated with equal solemnity, or  
rather with studied emphasis. Either then  
we must sy, that the will of the Legislature  
Is the only meusuie of their authority ; and  
that in the plenitude of this authority, they  
may sweep away all vur fundamental rights ;  
or that they are bound to leave this particular  
right untouched and sacred ; either we must  
s.y that they may control the freedom of the  
press ; may abolish the tiial by jury ; may  
swallow up the executive and judiciary pow­  
ers Of the stute==nuy, that they wmay anaihil­  
ate our very ri;;ht of suffrage, and erect  
themselves into an independendest and here­  
ditary Assembly ; or we must say that they  
have no authority to enact into a law the bili  
under consideration. We, the Subscribers,  
say, that the General Assembly of this Com­  
monwealth. have no such authority ; and that  
no effort may be omitted on our part against  
s 0 dungerous an usurpation, we oppose to it  
this remonstrance, earnestly praying, as we  
are in duty bound, that the Supreme Law­  
giver of the Universe, by illuminating those  
to whom it is addressed, may, on one -hand,  
turn ¢ councils from every act, which  
would @n his holy prerogatine, or violate  
the trust commitied w them ; and on the  
other, guide them into every measure which  
may be worthy of His blessing, may tedound  
to their own praise, and may estublish more  
firmly the liberties, the property, and the  
happiness of this commonwealth

WE, the fubfcribers, citizens of the faid commonwealth, hav-  
ing taken into ferious confideration a bill, printed by order of the  
laft feffion of general afiembly, entitled “ A bill eftablifhing a pro-  
vifion for teachers of the chriftian religion ;” and conceiving,  
that the fame, if finally armed with the fanctions of a kaw, will be

a dangerous abufe of power ; are bound as faithful members of  
a free ftate, to remonftrate againft it, and to declare the reafons  
by which we are determined. We remonftrate againft the faid  
bill :--  
  
Becaufe we hold it for a fundamental and unalienable truth,  
¢ that religion, or the duty whieh we oweto the Creator, and the  
manner of difcharging it, ean be directed only by reafon and con-  
viétion, not by force or violence.”’* The religion, then, of every  
man, muft be left to the conviétion and confcience of every man ;  
and it is the right of every man to exercife it, as thefe may dictate.  
This right is, in its nature, an unalienable right. It is unalien-  
able; beeaufe the opinions of men depending only on the evidence  
contemplated by their own minds, cannot follow the didtates of  
other men. It is unalienable, alfo; becaufe what is here a right  
towards man, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of  
every man to render to the Creator fuch homage, and fuch only,  
as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent,  
both in order of time, and in degree of obligation, to the claims  
of civil fociety. Before any man can be confidered as a member  
of civil fociety, he muft be confidered as a fubject of the Governor  
of the univerfe. And if a member of civil fociety, who enters in-  
to any fubordinate affociation, muft always do it with a referva-  
tion of his duty to the general authority ; much more muft every  
man who becomes a member of any particular civil fociety, do it  
with a faving of his allegiance to the univerfal Sovereign. We  
maintain, therefore, that, in matters of religion, no man’s right is  
abridged by the inftitution of civil fociety ; and that religion is  
wholly exempi from its cognizance. True it is, that no other rule  
exifts, by which any queftion which may divide a fociety can be  
ultimately determined, but by the will of the majority. But it is  
alfo true that the majority may trefpafs on the rights of the  
minority.  
  
Becaufe if religion be exempt from the authority of the fociety  
at large, fill lefs can it be fubjeé to that of the legiflative body.  
The latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of the former.  
Their jurifdiction is both derivative and limited. It is limited  
with regard to the co-ordinate departments: more neceffarily, it  
is limited with regard to the conftituents. The prefervation of a  
free government requires, not merely that the metes and bounds  
which feparate each department: of power, be invariably maintain-  
ed ; but more efpecially, that neither of them be fuffered to over-  
leap the great barrier which defends the rights of the people.  
The rulers who are guilty of fuch an encroachment, exceed the  
commiffion fiom which they derive their authority, and are ty-  
rants. ‘lhe people who fubmit to it, are governed by laws made  
neither by themfelves, nor by an authority derived from them, and  
are flaves.

Religious Liberty ftated and defended. 23  
  
Becaufe it is proper to take alarm, at the firft experiment on  
our liberties; We hold this prudent jealoufy, to be the fir duty  
of citizens, and one of the nobleft chara¢teriftics of the late revo-  
  
tution. The freemen of America did not wait until ufurped pow-  
  
er had ftrengthened itfelf by exercife, and entangled the queition  
in precedents. They faw all the confequences in the principle,  
and they avoided the confequences by denying the principle. We  
revere this leffon too much, foon to forget it. Who does not fee  
that the fame authority which can eftablifh chriftianity in exclu-  
fion of all other religions, may eftablifh, with the fame eafe, any  
particular fect of chriftians, in exclufion of all other fects: That  
the fame authority which can force a citizen to contribute. three  
pence only of his property, for the fupport of any one eftablifh-  
ment, may force him to conform to any other eftablifhment, in all  
cafes whatfoever.  
  
Becaufe the bill violates that equality which ought to be the  
bafis of every law; and which is more indifpenfable, in propor-  
tion as the validity or expediency of any law is more liable to be  
impeached. ‘If all men are, by nature, equally free and inde-  
pendent,”* all men are to be confidered as entering into fociety  
on equal conditions, as relinquifhing no more, and therefore re-  
taining no lefs, one than another, of their natural rights: above  
all, are they to be confidered as retaining an “ equal title to the  
free exercife of religion according to the dictates ot confcience’’+  
Whilfi we affert for ourfelves a freedom to embrace, to profeis,  
and obferve the religion which we believe to be of divine origin ;  
we cannot deny an equal freedom to thofe whofe minds have not  
yet yielded to the evidence which has convinced us. If this  
freedom be abuied, it is an offence againft God, not againft man.  
To God, therefore, and not to man, muft an account of it be  
rendered.  
  
As the bill violates equality, by fubjecting fome to peculiar  
burdens ; fo it violates the fame principle by granting to others,  
peculiar exemptions. Are the Quakers and Mennonifts the only  
feé&amp;ts who think a compulfive fupport of their religions unnecef-  
fary and unwarrantable? Can their piety alone be entrufted with  
the care of public worfhip? Ought their religions to be endowed,  
above all others, with extraordinary privileges, by which profelytes  
may be enticed from all others? We think too favourably of the  
juftice and good fenfe of thefe denominations, to believe, that they  
either covet pre-eminences over their fellow-citizens, or that they  
will be feduced ty them from the common oppofition to the  
meature.  
  
Becaufe the bill implies, either that the civil magiftrate is a  
competent judge of religious truths, or that he may employ reli-  
gion as an engine of civil policy. The firft is an arrogant pre-

tenfion, falfified by the extraordinary opinion of rulers, in all ages,  
and throughout the world ; the fecond, an unhallowed perverfion  
of the means of falvation.  
  
Becaufe the eftablifhment propofed by the bill. is not requifite  
for the fapport of the Chriftian religion. To fay that it is, is a  
contradiction to the Chriftian religion itfelf; for every page of  
it difavows a dependence on the power of this world; it is a con-  
tradiction to fact, for it is known that this religion both exifted  
and flourifhed, not only without the fupport of human laws, but  
in fpite of every oppofition from them ; and not only during the  
period of miraculous aid, but long after it had been left to its own  
evidence and the ordinary care of Providenee ; nay, it is a contra-  
diction ‘a terms; for a religion not invented by human policy,  
muft have pre-exifted and been fupported, before it was eftablifhed  
by human policy ; it is moreover to weaken in thofe who profefs  
this religion a pious confidence in its innate excellence and the  
patronage of its Author ; and to fofter in thofe who fill reject it,  
a fufpicton that its friends are too confcious of its fallacies, to truit  
it to its Own merits.  
  
Becaufe experience witnefles that ecclefiaftical eftablifhments,  
inftead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion, have  
had a contrary operation. During almoft fifteen centuries has  
the legal eftablifhment of Chriftianity been on trial. What have  
been its fruits. More or lefs in all places, pride and indolence in  
the clergy ; ignorance and fervility in the laity; in both, fuper-  
ftition, bigotry, and periecution. Enquire of the teachers of  
Chriftianity for the ages in which it appeared in its greateft luftre?  
thofe of every fec&amp; point to the ages prior to its incorporation with  
civil policy. Propofe a reftoration of this primitive ftate, in which  
its teachers depended on the voluntary rewards of their flocks,  
many of them prediét its downfall. On which fide ought their  
teftimony to have greateft weight, when for, or when againft their  
intereft ?  
  
Becaufe the eftablifiment in queftion, is not neceflary, for the  
fupport of civil government. If it be urged as neceffary for the  
fupport of civil government, only as it is a means of fupporting  
religion, and it be not neceffary for the latter purpofe, it cannot  
be neceflary for the former. If religion be not within the cogni-  
zance of civil government, how can its legal eftablifhment be faid  
to be neceflary to civil government ? What influence in fact have  
ecclefiaftical eftablifhments had on civil fociety? In fome in-  
ftances they have-been feen to ere&amp; a fpiritual tyranny on the  
ruins of the civil authority ; in more inftances have they been feen  
upholding the thrones of political tyranny ; in no inftance have they  
been feen the guardians’of the liberties of the people. Rulers who  
withed to fubvert the public liberty, may have found an eftablifhed  
clergy convenient ayxiliaries. A juft government inftituted to fe-  
cure and perpetuatg it, needs them rot. Such a government will

be beft fupported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of  
his Se the jeen cit hand which protects his perfon  
and his property; by neither invading the equal rights of any  
feé&amp;, nor fuffer any fect to invade thofe of another.  
  
Beeaufe the propofed eftablifhment is a departure from that  
generous policy, which, offering an afylum to the perfecuted and  
opprefied of every nation and religion, promifed a luftre to our  
country, and an acceflion to the number of its citizens. What a  
melancholy mark is the bill of fudden degeneracy? Inftead of  
holding furth an afylum to the perfecuted, it is itfelf a fignal of  
perfecution. It degrades from the equal rank of citizens all thofe  
whofe opinions in religion do not bend to thofe of the legiflative  
authority. Diftant as it may be, in its prefent form, from the in-  
quifition, it differs from it only in degree: the one is the firft ftep;  
the other the laft, in the career of i intolerance. The magnani-  
mous fufferer under the cruel fcourge in foreign regions, muft  
view the bill as a beacon on our coaft, warning him to feek fomé  
other haven, whefe liberty and philanthropy in their due extent  
may offer a more certain repofe from his troubles, |  
  
Becaufe it will have a like tendency to banifh our citizens. The  
allurements prefented by other fituations, are every day thinniig  
their number. To fuperadd a frefh motive to emigration, by re-  
voking the liberty which they now enjoy, would be the fame fpe-  
bo P folly, which has difhonoured and depopulated flourifhing  
  
ingdoms. |  
  
Becanfe it will deftroy that moderation and harmony, which the  
forbearance of our laws to intermeddle with religion has produced  
among its feveral feéts. Torrents of blood have been fpilt in the  
old world, by vain attempts of the fecular arm to extinguifh reli-  
  
  
  
- gious difcord by proferibing all- differences in religions opinion.  
  
Time has at length revealed the true remedy. Every relaxation  
of narrow ahd ri s policy, wherever it has been tried, has  
been found to afluage the difeafe. The American theatre has ex-  
hibited proofs, that equal and complete liberty, if it does not  
wholly eradicate it, fufficiently deftroys its malignant influence on  
the health and profperity of the State. If wich the falutary effects of  
this fyftem under our own eyes, we begin to contraé the bounds  
of religious freedom, we know no name that will. too feverely re-  
proach our folly. At leaft, let warning be taken at the firlt fruits  
of the threatened innovation. The very appearance of the bill  
has transformed that “ Chriftian forbearance, love and charity,”’*  
which of late: mutually prevailed, into animofities and jealoufies  
which may not foon be-appeafed. What mifchiefs may not be  
dreaded, fhould this enemy to the public quiet, be armed with the  
force of a law?

Becaufe the policy of the bill is adverfe to the diffufion of the  
  
light of Chriftianity. The firft with of thofe who enjoy this  
precious gift ought to be, that it may be imparted to the whole  
tace of mankind. Compare the number of thofe, who havé as yet  
received it, with the number ftill remaining under the dominion of  
falfe religions, and how fmall is the former! Does the policy of  
the bill tend.to leffen the difproportion? No; it at once difcour-  
ages thofe who are ftrangers to the light of truth, from coming  
into the regions of it; and countenances by example, the nations  
who continue in darknefs, in fhutting out thofe who might convey  
it to them. Inftead of levelling as far as poffible every obftacle  
to the victorious progrefs of truth, the bill with an ignoble and un-  
chriftian timidity, would circumfcribe it, with a wall of defence  
againft the encroachments of error.  
&#x27; Becaufe attempts to enforce by legal fanétions, aéts, obnoxious  
to fo great a pruportion of citizens, tend to enervate the laws in  
general, and to flacken the bands of fociety. If it be difficult to  
execute any law, which is not generally deemed neceflary or falu-  
tary, what muft be the cafe where it is deemed invalid and dan-  
gerous? And what may be the effect of fo flriking an example of  
impotency in the government on its general authority ?  
  
Becaufe a meafure of fuch fingular magnitude and delicacy,  
ought not to be impofed, without the cleareft evidence that it is  
called for by a majority of citizens; and no fatisfaétory method  
is yet propofed by which the voice of the majority in this cafe may  
be determined, or its influence fecured. “ The people of the re-  
{pettive counties are indeed requelted to fignify their opinion re-  
f{pecting the adoption of the bili to the next feffion of affembly.”  
But the reprefentation muft be made equal, before the voice either  
of the reprefentatives or of the counties, will be that of the people.  
Our hope is that neither of the former will, after due confidera-  
tion, efpoufe the dangerous principle of the bill. Should the event  
difappoint us, it will ftill leave us in full confidence, that a fair ap-  
peal to the latter will reverfe the fentence againft our liberties.  
  
Becaufe, finally, “ the equal right of every citizen to the free  
exercife of his religion re to the diftates of confcience,’’ is  
held by the fame tenure with all our other rights. If we recur to  
its Origin, it is equally the gift of nature ; if we weigh its impor-  
tance, it cannot be lefs dear to us; if we confult the “ Declaration  
of thofe rights which pertain to the good people of Virginia, as  
the bafis and foundation of government,’”’ it is enumerated with  
equal folemnity, or rather with ftudied emphafis. Either then we  
mutt fay, that the will of the legiflature is the only meafare of  
their authority; and that, in the plenitude of this authority,  
they may fweep away all our fundamental rights 5 or, that they  
are bound to leave this particular right untouched and facred : ei-  
ther we muft fay that they may control the freedom of the prefs ;  
may abolifh the trial by jury ; may fwallow up the executive, and

authority; much more must every man, who be-  
comes a membex, of any particular civil societv, do  
it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal  
Sovereign. We maintain, therefore, that in mat-  
ters of religion, no man’s right is abridged by the  
institution of civil society; and that religion is  
wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is that  
no other rule exists, by which any qriestion which  
may divide society, can be ultimately determined,  
but by the will of a Majority; but it is also true,  
that the majority may trespass on the rights of the  
minority.  
  
Beeause if religion be exempt from the authority  
of the society at large, still less can it be subject  
to that of the legislative body. The latter are but  
the creatures and vicegerents of the former. Their  
jurisdiction is both derivative and limited.—It is  
limited with regard to the co-ordinate departments;  
more necessarily, it is limited with regard to the  
constituents. The preservation of a free govern-  
ment requires, not merely that the metes and  
bounds which separate eac!s department of power,  
be invariably maintained; but more especially, that  
neither of them be suffered to overleap the great  
barrier which defends the rights of the people.  
The rulers, who are guilty of such an encroach-  
ment, exceed the commission from which they  
derive their authority, and are tyrants. The peo-  
plé who submit to it, are governed by laws made  
neither by themselves, nor by an authority derived

To the hon. the general assembly  
of the commonwealth of Virginia.  
  
We, the subscribers, citizens of the said common-  
wealth,having taken into serious consideration a bill,  
printed by order of the last session of the general  
assembly, entitled, ‘A bill establishing a provision  
for teachers of the christian religion;” and conceiv-  
ing, that the same, if fiaally armed wiih the sanc-  
tion of a law, will be a dangerous abuse of power;  
  
are bound, as faithful members of a free state, to,  
  
remonstrate against it, and to deciare the reasons  
by which we are determined. We remonstrate  
against the said bill,  
  
Because we hold it for a fundamental and  
unalienable truth, “that religion, or the duty which  
we qwe to the Creator, and tae manner of discharg-  
ing it, can be directed only by reason and convic-  
tion, not by force or violence.”’* The religion, then,  
of every man, must be left to the conviction and  
conscience of every man; and it is the right of every  
man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right  
is, in its nature, an unalienable right. It is unaliena-  
ble, because the opinions of men, depending only  
on the evidence contemplated by their own minds,  
cannot follow the dictates of other men, It is  
unalienable, also, because what is here a right to-  
wards man, is a duty towards the Creator. It is  
the duty of every man to render.to the Creator such  
homage, and such only, as he believes to be ac-  
ceptable to him. This duty is precedent both in  
order and time, and in degree of obligation, to the  
claims of civil society. Before any man can be con-  
sidered as a member of civil society, he must be  
considered as a subject of the governor of the  
Universe. And if a member of civil society, who  
enters into any subordinate association, must always  
do it with a reservation of hs duty to the general

‘from them, and are slaves.  
  
| Because it is proper to take alarm at the first  
experiment on our liberties. We hold this prudent  
{jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of  
the noblest characteristics of the late revolution.  
The freemen of America did not wait until usurped  
power had strengthened itself by exercise, and  
entangled the question in precedents. They saw  
all the consequences in the principle, and they  
avoided the consequences by denying the princi-  
ple. We revere this lesson too much, soon to for-  
get it. Who does not see that the same authority,  
which can establish Christianity in exclusion of all  
other religions, may establish, with the same ease,  
any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of  
|all other sects; that the same authority, which can  
force a citizen to contribute three pence only of  
his property, for the support of any one establish-  
ment, may force him to conform to any other esta-  
  
lishment, in all cases whatsoever ?  
  
Because the bill violates that equality whieh  
ought te be the basis of every law; and which is  
}more indispensable, in proportion as the validity  
‘or expediency of any law is more liable to be im-  
  
  
  
rand independent,’’* all men are to be to considered  
as entering into society on equal conditions, as re-  
linguishing no more, and, therefore, retaining no  
less, oné than another, of their natural rights;  
above all, are they to be considered as retaining an  
‘equal title to the free exercise of religion accord-  
ing to the dictates of conscience.&quot;— Whilst we  
assert for ourselves afreedoin to embrace, to pro-  
fess, and observe the religion which we believe to  
be of divine origin, we cannot deny an equal free-  
dom to those, whose mitds have not yet yielded  
to the evidence which has convinced us, If this  
freedom be abused, it is an offence against God, not  
against man. ‘To God, therefore, and not to man,  
must an account of it be rendered.

As the bill violates equality, by subjecting some  
‘to peculiar burdens; so it violates the same princi-  
ple, by granting to others peculiar exemptions.—  
Are the Quakers and Menonists the only sects who  
think a compulsive support of their religions un-  
necessarv and unwarrantable ? Can their piety  
alone be entrusted with the care of public worship ?  
Ought their religions to be endowed, above all  
others, with ex‘raordinary privileges, by which  
proselytes may be enticed from all others? We  
think too faverably of the justice and good sense  
of these denominations, to believe that they either  
covet pre-eminences over their fellow-citizens, or  
that they will be seduced by them from the common  
opposition to the measure. a  
  
Because the bill impiies, either that the civil  
magistrate is a competent judge of religious truths,  
or that he may employ religion as an engine of civil  
policy. The first is an arrogant pretension, falsified  
by the extraordinary opinion of rulers, in all ages,  
and throughout the world; the second,an unhallowed  
perversion of the means of salvation.  
  
Because the establishment proposed by the bill,  
is not requisite for the support of the Christian  
relizion. To say that it is, is a contradiction to the  
€hristian religion itseif; for every page of it disavows  
a dependence on the power of this world: it is a  
contradiction to fact, for it is known thac this reli-  
gion bot) existed and flourished, not only without  
the support of human laws, but in spite of every  
opposition from them; and not only during the  
  
eriod of miraculous ail, but long after it had been  
Pre to iis own evidence and the ordinary care of  
Providence: nay, it Is a contradiction in terms; for  
a relizion not invented by human policy, must have  
  
re-existed and been supported, before it was esta-  
blished by human policy: itis, moreover, to weaken  
in those, who profess this religion, a pious confi-  
dence in its innate excellence, and the patronage of  
its Author; and to foster in those, who still reject  
it, a suspicion that its friends are too conscious of  
its fallacies, to trust it to its own merits.  
  
Because experience witnesses that ecclesiastical  
establishments, instead of maintaining the purity  
and efficacy of religion, have had a conirary opera-  
tion. Wuring almost fifteen centuries has the legal  
establistiment of Crristianity been on trial.— What  
have been its fruits? More or less in all places,  
pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and  
servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry,  
and persecution. Inquire of the teachers of Chris-  
tianity for the ages in which it appeared in its great  
est lustre; those of every sect poimt to the ages  
prior (0 its incorporation with civil policy. Propose  
a restoration of this primitive state, in which its  
  
teachers depended on the voluntary rewards of  
  
their flocks, many of them predict its downfal.—  
On which side ought their testimony to have the  
greatest weight, when for, er When against their in-  
tcrest? oF el  
Because the establishment in question is not ne-  
cessary for the support of civil government. If it  
be urged as necessary for the support of civil go-  
vernment, only as it is a means of supporting reli-  
gion, and if it be not necessary for the latter pur-  
pose, it cannot be necessary for the former. If reli-  
  
ion be not within the cognizance of civil Are bol  
  
ment, how can its legal establishment be said to be  
  
  
  
|  
  
upholding the throne of political tyranny; in no in«.  
stance have they been seen the guardians of the ]j-  
berties of the people.—-Rulers, who wished to  
subvert the public liberty, may have found an esta.  
blished clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just g0-  
vernment, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,  
needs them not. Such a government will be best  
supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoy-  
ment of his religion, with the same equal hand  
which protects his person and property; by neither  
ivading the equal rights of any sect, nor suffering  
any sect to invade those of another.  
  
Because the proposed establishment is a depar-.  
ture from the generous policy which offering an  
asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every  
nation and religion, promised a lustre to our coun-  
try, and an accession to the number of its citizens.  
What amelancholy mark is the bill of sudden de-  
generacy? Instead of holding forth an asylum to  
the persecuted, it is itself&#x27;a signal of persecution.  
It degrades from the equal rank of citizens, all  
those whose opinions in religion do not bend to those  
of the legislaiive authority. Distant as it may be, in  
its present form, from the inguisition, it differs from  
it only in degree: the one is the first step, the other  
the last, in the career of intolerance. The mag-  
nanimous sufferer under the cruel scourge in foreign  
regions, must view the bill as a beacon on our  
coast, warning him to seek some other haven,  
where liberty and philanthropy in their due extent  
may offer a more certain repose for his troubles.  
  
Because it will have a like tendency to banish  
our citizens. The allurements presented by other  
situations, are every day thinning their number. To  
supersdd a fresh motive to emigration, by revok-  
ing the liberty which they now enjoy, would be the  
same species of folly, which has dishonored and  
depopulated flourishing kingdoms.  
  
Because it will destroy that moderation and har-  
mony, which the forbearance of our law to inter-  
meddle with religion has produced among its se-  
veral seets. Torrents of blood have been spilt in  
the old world, by vain attempts of the secular arm  
to extinguish religious discord, by proscribing ali  
differences in religious opinion. Time has at length  
revealed the true remedy. Every relaxation of nar-  
row and rigorous policy, wherever it has been tried,  
has been found to assuage the disease. The Ameri-  
can theatre has exhibited proofs, that equal and  
and complete liberty, if it does not wholly eradicate  
it, sufficiently destroys its malignant influence en the  
health and prosperity of the state. If with the sa-  
lutary effect of this system under our own eyes, we  
begin to contract the bounds of religious freedom,  
we know noname that will too severely reproach our  
folly. At least, let warning be taken at the first  
fruits of the threatened innovation. The very ap-  
pearance of the bill has transformed that “christian  
forbearance, love, and charity,”’* which of late mu-  
tually prevailed, into animosities and jealousies,  
which may not soon be appeased. What mischiets  
may not be dreaded, should this enemy to the pub-  
lic quiet be armed with force of law?  
  
Because the policy of the bill is adverse to the  
diffusion of the light of Christianity. The first wish  
of those, who ought to enjoy this precious gift,  
ought to be, that it may be imparted to the whole  
race of mankind, Compare the number of those,

the bill tend to lessen the dispropotion., No, ii at  
once discourages those who are strangers to the  
light of truth, from coming into the regions of it;  
and countenances, by example, the nations who  
continue in darkness, in shutting out those who  
might convey it to them. Instead of levelling, as  
ar as possible, every obstacle to the victorious  
progress of truth, the bill, with an ignoble and un-  
christian timidity, would circumscribe it, with a  
wall of defence against the encroachment of error.  
  
Because an attempt to enforce by legal sanctions,  
acts, obnoxious to so great a portion of ci‘izens,  
tends to enervate the laws in general, and to slack-  
en the bands of society. If it be difficult to cxe-  
cute any law, which is not generally deemed neces-  
sary nor salutary, what must be the case when it is  
deemed invalid and dangerous? And what may be  
the effect of so striking an example of impotency in  
the government on its general authority?  
  
Because a measure of such singular magnitude  
and delicacy, ought not to be imposed without the  
clearest evidence that it is called for by a majority of,  
citizens; and no satisfactory method is yet proposed  
by which the voice of the majority in this case may  
be determined, or its influence secured. “The peo-  
ple of the respective counties are, indeed requested  
to signify their opinion, respecting the adoption of  
the bill, to the next session of assembly.”” But the  
representation must be made equal, betore the voice,  
  
  
  
either of the representatives or of the counties, will  
be that of the people. Our hope is, that neither of  
the former, after due consideration, will espouse  
the dangerous principle of the bill. Should the  
event disappoint us, it will still leave us in full  
confidence, that a fair appeal to the latter will re-  
verse the sentance against our liberties.  
  
Because, finally, * the equal right of every citi-}  
zen to the free excercise of his religion according  
to the dictates of his conscience,” is held by the  
same tenure with allour otherrights. If we recur  
to its Origin, it is equally the gift of nature; if we  
weigh its importance, it cannot be less dear to us;  
if we consult the “ declaration of those rights  
which pertain to the good people of Virginia, as  
the basis and foundation of government,” it is enu-  
merated with equal solemnity, or rather with siu-  
died emphasis. Either then we must say, that the  
will of the legislature is the only measure of their |  
authority; and that in the plenitude of this authority,  
they may sweep away all our fundamental rights;  
or that they are bound to leave this particular  
right untouched and sacred: either we must say,  
that they may control the freedom of the press; may  
abolish the trial by jury; may swallow up the execu-  
tive and judiciary powers of the State; nay, that  
they may annihilate our very right of suffrage, and  
erect themselves into an independent and heredi-  
tary assembly; or we must say that they have no  
authority to enact into a law, the bill under consi-  
deration. We, the subscribers, say that the gene-  
Tal assembly of this commonwealth have no such au-  
thority; and that no effort may be omitted on our part  
against so dangerous an usurpation, we oppose this  
remonstrance, earnestly praying, as we are in duty  
bound, that the supreme lawgiver of the universe,  
by iiluminating those to whom it is addressed, may,  
on the one hand, turn their councils from every

To the Honorable the General A nr mbit, of Hit  
C onmiemutcalth of Virginia.  
K MBlIOftlAt AMI) H SMONSTK AMOK  
We, (he subscribers, citizens of the s„d Cotn­  
...&quot;wealth, having taken into serious consideration  
‘ Hill printed by order of. the Iasi session of the  
-•meral Assembly, entitled, •« A Bill establishing  
a revision lor fearhere of the Christian Reli­  
gion, and conceiving that the same, it finally armed  
iv:th the sanctions of a l.w, will be a dangerous  
abuse of power, „e boon,1,as faithful member, of a  
free . ta.e, toremonrral* ag.mst it; and (0 dt.cIate  
the reasons oy which we are determined. Worr­  
nionstate against i|iC ,a/,| ,{  
&#x27; l ? ,&quot;e’ *• F&gt;r a fundamental and un­  
deniable &#x27;ruth, “ tint Religion or ihe duty which  
we owe to our Creator, a„d the manner of 0„  
ch.rg.og rl, can be directed only b, reason a„d  
. on VIC lion, nor by force or violence.”* The Hr  
IIH &quot;, ’hen of eve.y (il Jef| ,  
vicilon .ml conscience rf every man; an I ,, j, &quot;,  
;i2ht of every roan to exercise it as ihe«e may Ji&lt;-.  
V&#x27;&quot; is i‘* natiiie an unaliena! le  
&gt;». It i* unalienable, because ,he opinions of  
jm. depending only on the evidence ton.«npja.  
• IJerlsfttlon or Ri-V-, A jr.  
  
| ted iu then own minds, capnot follow the dictates  
! of other men: It is unalienable also; because what  
&#x27; i« here a right towards men, is a duty towards the  
Creator. It is the duty of every man to render tc  
i the Creator such homage, and such only, as he be­  
t lieves to be acceptable to hint; this duty ia prece­  
dent, both in order of lime, and in degiee of obli­  
gation, to the claims of civil society. Before aoj  
man can be considered a member of civil society  
he must be considered as a subject of the Governoi  
ol the Universe: And if a member of civil society,  
who enters into any subordinate association, must  
always do it with a reservation of his duly to the  
general authority; much more must every man  
who becomes a member of any particular civil so­  
! c|ety, do it with a saving of hts allegiance to the  
Universal Sovereign. We maintain, therefore,  
that in matters of religion, no mau’s right is abridged  
by the institution of civil society; and that reli­  
gion is iv holly exempt from its cognizance. True  
( ** &#x27;*» that no other rule exists, by which any question  
which may divide a society, can be ultimately de­  
, dimmed, but the will of the majority; but it is also  
tiue, that the majority may trespass&#x27; on the right*  
of the minority.  
Because, It religion be exempt from the au­  
i thorily of the society at large, still ltss can it be  
subject to that of the Legislative Body. The latter  
are but the creatures and vicegerent* of the former.  
T heir jurisdiction is both derivative and limited_  
It is limited with regard to the co-ordinate de  
partments; more necessarily is it limited with re­  
gard to the constituents. The pieservation of a  
liee government requires not merely that the metes  
and hounds which separate each department of  
power be invariably maintained; but more espe­  
cially, that neither of them be suffered to overleap  
the great barrier, which defends the rights of the  
people. The rulers who are guilty of such an en  
croachmeut, exceed the commission from which  
they derive their authority, and are tyrants. The  
people who submit to it are governed by laws  
made neither by themselves, nor by an authority  
deiived from them, and aie slaves.  
Because, It is proper to take alarm at tLe first  
experiment on our liberties. YYro hold this prudent  
jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of  
the noblest characteristics of the late revolution.  
The freemen of America did not wait till usurped  
power had strengthened itself by cxetcise, and en­  
tangled the question in precedents. They saw all j  
&#x27;he consequences in the principle, and they avoided!  
the consequences by denying the principle. YVe  
teycie this ie-son loo much, soon to forget it_  
YVho does not see that the same authority which  
can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other  
1 religions, may eitahlh-h w4th the same ease, any  
particular sect of Christians, iu exclusion of all  
other scci«? 1 iiat the same authority which can  
force a citizen to contribute three-pence only of  
ids property for tue support of any one establish­  
ment, may force him to conform 10 any other es­  
tablishment in all cases whatsoever  
  
IJe&lt; au*«e, 1 he tail] violates that equality willed  
ought to tie the basis of every law; and which ie  
tnoie indfspensible, in proportion as the validity or  
expediency ot any law is more liable to be im­  
peached. If “ all men are by nature equally free  
atnl independent,’ f all men are to be considered as  
entering into society on equal conditions, as relin­  
quishing no more, and therefore retaining no less,  
one than ano-her, of their rights. Above all, are  
they to be considered as retaining an “ equal title  
to the free exercise of teligion according to the dic­  
tates ot conscience.”* Whilst we assert f|,r our­  
selves a freedom to embrace, to profess and to ob­  
seive the rehgiou which we believe to be of divine  
ongin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to those,  
whose minds have not yet yielded to tLe evidence  
which has convinced us If this freedom be abus­  
ed, it is an offence against Cod, not against man :  
JoGod, tnerefore, not to men, must an account  
ol it be rendered. A? the bill violates-equality by  
subjecting come to peculiar burdens; so it violates  
the same principle, by panting to others peculiar  
exemptions. Are the Quakers and Menonists the  
only beets who think a compulsive support of  
their religions unnecessary and unwarrantable&#x27; Can  
their piety alone be intrusted with the care of pub­  
lic worship? Ought their religions to he endow­  
ed, above all others, with extraordinary privileges  
by which proselyte* may be enticed from all others?  
We think too favorably of the justice and good  
sen«o of these denominations, to believe, that ^they  
either covet pre-eminences over their fellow citi­  
zens or that they will be seduced by them, from  
the common opposition to the measure.  
lJfcau.se, The bill implies, either that the Civil  
Magistrate is a competent judge of religious truth;  
or that he may employ religion as engine of ci­  
vi! policy. The first is an arrogant preiension,  
falsified oy the contradictory opinions of rulers in  
all ages, nnd throughout the world : The second  
an unhallowed pe.-veision of the means of salva­  
tion.  
Ilecatise, The establishment proposed by the bill  
is not requisite for the support of the Christian He  
hgion. To say that n is, is a contradiction to the  
Christian Heligion itself; foreveiy page of it disa­  
vows a dependence on the powers of this world •  
It is a contradiction to fact; for it is known that this  
He igion both existed and flourished, not only with­  
out the support of human laws, but in spite of  
every opposition from them; and not only during  
the period of miraculous aid, but long after it had  
been left lo iis own evidence, and the ordtnary  
care of Providence : Nay, it is a contradiction in  
terms for a Heligtou not invented by human poli­  
cy, must have pre-exsled and been supported,  
before it was established by human policy. It i­  
moreover to weaken in those who profess this Re­  
ligion, a pious confidence in iis innate excellence  
and the oatronage of its author; &amp; to f.,s*er in those  
who still reject it, a suspicion, that its friends arc  
too conscious of its fallacies, to irust it t0 i* own  
merits.  
  
ilec.use Experience witnessed,. that eccle.iaa­  
lical establishments, instead of maintain,^ the  
purity ami efficacy of lieltgion, have had a con­  
trary operation. Idling almost fifteen centuries  
has the legal establishment of Christianity been on  
trial. hat have been its fruits? More or ley.  
|n all places, pride and indolence in the fierce­  
ignorance and servility in the laity; in both su­  
perstition, bigotry and persecution. Inquire 0f the  
teachers, of Chr,stiantty for (he ages in which it  
appealed In Its greatest lustre; those of every ,ect  
point to the ages prior to its incorporation with  
civil policy, l&#x27;ropo-e a restoration of this prim­  
itive state, it, which its tencher* depended on the  
voluntary rewards of their flocks; many of them  
predict tts downfall. On which sole ought ,hS  
testimony to have greatest weight, when fo  
Of when against their interest &gt; 6 1 ’  
licca.i.e The establishment in question i, „m

If it be urged as necessary for (be support of civil  
government only as „ ,« a means of supporting  
| religion; and it be not necessary for the latter

What influence, ,n fact, have &#x27; cClesia-tical estab­  
lish.nrnt. had on civil society ? I„ some instan­  
ces they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyran­  
ny on the reins of the civil authority; in many  
instances they have been seen upholding the  
thrones of political tyranny; i„ nr, ,n*«ar,ce have

an asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of ..  
very nation and religion, promised a bistre ,o our  
country, anil an accession to the number of itsriri  
■urns. What a melancholy mark is the bill of  
sudden degeneracy? instead o! holding forth an  
t i &#x27;eelaration on ii.ghts, A rf J  
t Mu ItS,  
i  
  
asyiuui to the persecuted, It is itself, a signal of  
pcisecution. It degrades from the equal raqk of  
citizens all those whose opinions in religion do n$t  
bend to those of the Legislative authority. Dis­  
tant as it may be, in its present form, from the In­  
quisition, ft differs from it only in degree. The one  
is the first step, the other the last in the care-T ol  
intolerance. The magnanimous sufferer under this  
cruel scourge iu foreign regions, must view the  
bill as &amp; beacon on our coast, warning him to seek  
some oilier haven, where liberty and philanthropy,  
in their due extent, may offer a more certain repose  
from his troubles.  
Because, It will have a like tendency to banish  
our citizens. The allurements presented by other  
situations are every day thinning their numbei.  
lo superadd a fresh motive to emigration, by re­  
voking the liberty which they now enjoy, would  
be the same species of folly, which has dishonour­  
ed and depopulated nourishing kingdoms.  
Because, It will destroy that moderation and  
harmony which the forbearance of our laws to in­  
termeddle with Ileligion, has produced amongst its  
several sects. Torrents of blood Have been spilt  
in the old world, by vain attempts of the secular  
arm to extinguish religious discord, by proscribing  
all difference in religious opinions. Time has ai  
length revealed the true remedy. Every relaxa­  
tion of narrow and rigorous policy, wherever it  
has been tried, has been found to assuage the di*-*  
ease. The American theatre has exhibited proofs,  
that equal and complete liberty, if it does not whol­  
ly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys its malignant  
inll&#x27;ience on the health and prosperity of the state.  
If with the salutary effects of this system under  
our own eyes, we begin to contract the bonds of  
religious freedom, we know no name that will loo  
severely reproach our folly. At least let warning  
betaken at the first fruits of the threatened inno­  
vation. The very appearance of the bill has trans­  
formed “ that Christian torbcarance, love and  
charily,” which of late mutually prevailed, into  
animosities and jealousies, which may not soon be  
appeased. What mischiefs may not be dieaded,  
i &quot;hou,J this enemy to the public quiet be armed’  
with the force of a law.  
Because, The policy of the bill is adverse to  
the diffusion of the light of Christianity. The first  
wish oi those who enjoy this precious gift, ought  
to be, that it may be imparted to the whole race of  
mankind. Compare the number of those who  
have as yet receiveJ it, with the number still re­  
mlining under the dominion of false religions:  
and how small is the former ? Does the policy  
of the bill tend to lessen the disproportion? No:  
it at once discourages those who are strangers to  
the light of revelation from coming into the region  
of It; and countenances, by example, the nations  
who continue in darkness, in shutting out those  
who might convey it to them. Instead of levelling  
as tar possible, every obstacle to the victorious  
progfwe truth, tho bid with an ignoblo and un­  
ebri.-rian&#x27; -tfmidity, would6frcuniscriba it, with a  
wall of defence, aguns^tha encroachments of er­  
ufor.  
  
because. Attempt* to enforce by legal sanctions,  
acts obnoxious to so great a proportion of citizens,  
ten, to enervate the laws in general, ami to  
slacken the bands of society. If jt be difficult to  
execute any law which is wot generally deemed  
necessary or salutary, ,fW must be the ca«e,  
where it is deemed i,ivalia and dangerous? And  
w iat may be the efl’eei ot %o striking an example  
authority &#x27;QCy ,tt 6ov&lt;rnaieQ,» on its general  
Localise, A measure of such singular magnitude  
and delicacy ought not to be imposed, without the  
clearest evuience that it is called for by a majority  
ot citizens: AnJ no satisfactory method is yet  
proposed, by which the voice of the majority in  
t.us case may be determined, or its Influence se­  
cured. 4 1 he people of the respective counties  
are Indeed requested to signify their opinion res­  
pecting the adoption of the bdl to the next session  
ol Assembly. But the representation must be  
made equal, before the voirte either of the repre­  
sentatives, or of the counties, will be that of the  
people. Our hope is, that neither of the former  
will, alter due consideration, espouse the danger­  
ous principle of the bill. Should the event disap­  
point us, it will still leave us in full confidence,  
that a fair appeal to the latter will reverse the sen­  
tence against our liberties  
Because, Finally, ” The equal right of everv  
citizen to the free exercise of his religion, accord’­  
ing to the dictates of conscience,” is held by the  
s,me tenure with all our other rights. If we re­  
cur to its origin, it is equally the gift of nature; if  
we weigh Its importance, it cannot be less dear to  
us; if we consult the •« declaration of those rights  
wh.ch pertain to the good people of Virginia, as the  
basis and foundation of government,it is enu­  
merated with equal solemnity, or rather studied  
emphasis. Either then we must say, that the will  
of the -Legislator* it* the only measure of their au­  
thority, anti that in the plentitude of this authority  
they may sweep away all our fundamental rights­  
or t.iat they are bound to leave this psrticulai rj~ht  
untouched and sacred: Either we must say, that  
they may control the freedom of the press; may  
abolish the trial by jury; may swallow up theex­  
ecutive and judiciary powers of the slate; nay  
that they may despoil us of our very right of suf­  
frage, and erect themselves into an independent  
and hereditary Assembly; or we must say that  
they have no authority to enact into law the bill

George Mason, Green Spring, near Williams­  
burg, Virginia.  
To the Honorable the General Assembly of the Com­  
monwealth of Virginia.  
A MEMORIAL AND REMONSTRANCE.  
We the subscribers, citizens of the said Com­  
monwealth, having taken into serious consider­  
ation, a Bill printed by order ot the last session  
• of the General Assembly, entitled, A Bill es­  
tablishing a Provision for Teachers of the  
Christian Religion ,” and conceiving that the  
same, if finally armed with the sanctions ot a  
law, will he a dangerous abuse of power, are  
bound, as faithful members ol a f i ee S’ate, to i e­  
monstrate against it; and to declare the reasons  
by which we are determined. We remonstiutt  
against the said Bill.  
Because, We hold it for a fundamental and  
undeniable truth,‘ that Religion or the duty  
which we owe to our Creator, and the manner  
of discharging it, can be directed only by rea­  
son and conviction, not by force or violence.”*  
The Religion then of every man must be left to  
the conviction and conscience of every man;  
and it is the right of every man to exercise it as  
these may dictate. Phis right is in its nature  
an unamenable right. It is unalienable; because  
the opinions of men, depending only on the evi­  
dence contemplated in their own minds, cannot  
follow the dictates of other men: It is unaliena­  
ble also; beeause what is here a right towards  
, men, is a duty towards the Creator It is the  
duty of every man to render to the Creator such  
homage, and such only, as he believes to e ac  
ceptuble to him; this duty is precedent, both  
in order of time, and in degree of obligation, to  
the claims of civil society. Before any man |  
can be considered a member of cml society, he  
must be considered as a subject of the Governor  
of the Universe: And if a member of cwil so­  
ciety, who enters into any subordinate associa­  
tion, must always do it with a reservation of  
•Declaration of Rights, Art. 16*  
  
his duty to the genera! authority; much more  
must every man who becomes a member ot any  
particular civil society, do it with a saving o\
his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign, vve  
maintain, therefore, that in matters of religion,  
no man&#x27;s right is abridged by the institution o  
civil society; and that religion is wholly exe P  
from its cognizance True it if» lha* no o  
rule exists, by which any question wluc  
divide a society, can be ultimately e erm \
but the will of the majority; but it is a f° j.  
that the majority may trespass on e ng  
religion be exempt from the au­  
Body. The  
latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of  
the former. • Their jurisdiction is; both dertva­  
ive and limited.—It is limited with regard to  
the co-ordinate departments: more necessarily  
is it limited with regard to the constituents  
The preservation of a free government requires  
not merely that the metes and bounds which  
separate each department of power be invaria­  
ble maintained; but more especially,that neither  
0f them be suffered to overleap the great barrier,  
which defends the rights of the people. The  
rulers who are guilty of such an encroachment,  
exceed the commission from which they de­  
rive their authority, and are tyrants. The peo­  
ple who submit to it are governed by laws made  
neither by themselves, nor by an authority de­  
rived from them, and arc slaves.  
Because, it is proper to take alarm at the first  
experiment on our liberties We hold this  
prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens  
and one of the noblest characteristics of the  
late revolution. The freemen of America did  
not wait till usurped power had strengthened  
itself by exercise, and entangled the question in  
precedents. They.saw aU the consequences in  
the principle, and tftev avoided the consequen­  
ces by denying lhe®i inciple. We revere this  
lesson to muc1i,sooh too forget it.—Who does  
not see that the same authority which can es­  
tablish Christianity, in exclusion of all other  
Religions, may establish with the same ease,  
any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion  
of all other sects? That the same authority  
which can force a citizen to contribute three­  
pence only of his property for the support of  
any one establishment, may force him to con­  
form to any other establishment in all cases  
whatsoever.  
  
Because, 1 he bill violates that equality wnicn  
ought to be the basis of every law; anti which  
is more indispensible, in proportion as the va­  
lidity or expediency of any law is more liable  
to be impeached. If “all men are by nature e­  
qually free and independent,”! .nil men are  
to be considered as entering into society  
on equal conditions, as relinquishing no  
more, and therefore retaining no less, one than  
another, of their rights. Above all, are they to  
be considered as retaining an “equal title to the  
free exercise of religion according to the dic­  
tates of conscience.”! Whilst we assert for  
ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess and  
to observe the religion which we believe to be  
of divine origin, we cannot deny an equal free­  
dom to those, whose minds have not yet yield- i  
ed to the evidence which has convinced us. If  
this freedom be abused, it is an offence against  
God, not against man: l&#x27;o God, therefore, not  
to men, must an account of it be rendered. As  
the bill violates equality by subjecting some to  
peculiar burdens; so it violates the same princi­  
ple, by granting toothers peculiar exemptions.  
Are the Quakers and Menonists the only sects  
who think a compulsive support of their reli­  
gions unnecessary and unwarrantable? Can  
their piety alone be intrusted with the care of  
public worship? Ought their religions to be  
endowed, above all others, with extraordinary  
privileges, by which proselytes may be enticed  
from all others? We think too favorably of the  
justice and good sense of these denominations,  
to believe, that they either covet pre-eminences  
over their fellow citizens, or that they will be  
seduced by them, from the common opposition  
to the measure.  
  
Became, 1 he bill implies, either mat ine  
vil Magiit rate is a competent judge of religious  
truth; or that he may employ religion as an en­  
gine of civil policy. The first is an arrogant  
pretension, falsified by the contradictory opi­  
nions of rulers in all ages, and throughout the  
world: The second an unhallowed perversion  
of the means of salvation.  
Because, The establishment proposed by the  
bill is not requisite for the support of the Chris­  
tian Religion. To say that it is, is a contradic­  
tion to the Christian Religion itself; for every  
page of it disavows a dependence on the pow­  
ers of this world: It is a contradiction to fact;  
for it is known that this Religion both existed  
and flourished, not only without the support ol  
human laws, but in spite of every opposition  
from them; and not only ciuiing the period ol  
miraculous aid, but long after it had been left  
to its own evidence, and the ordinary care of  
Providence: Nay, it is a contradiction in terms;  
for a Religion not invented by human policy,  
must have pre-existed and been supported, be­  
fore it was established by human policy. It is  
moreover to weaken in those who profess this  
Religion, a pious confidence in its innate ex­  
cellence, and the patronage of its author; and  
to foster in those who still reject it, a suspicion,  
that its friends are too conscious ot its tallacics,  
to trust it to its own merits.  
Because, Experience witnessed, that eccle­  
siastical establishments, instead of maintaining  
the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a  
contrary operation. During almost fifteen cen­  
turies, has the legal establishment of Christiani­  
ty been on trial. What have been its fruits?  
More or less in all places, pride and indolence  
in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the  
laity; in both&#x27;, superstition, bigotry and perse­  
cution. Inquire of the teachers of Christianity  
lor the ages in which it appeared in its greatest  
lustre; those of every sect point to the ages  
prior to its incorporation with civil policy.—  
Propose a restoration of this primitive state,  
in which its teachers depended on the voluntary  
rewards of their flocks; many of them predict  
its downfall. On which side ought their testi­  
mony to have greatest weight, when for, op  
I when against their interest?  
Because, the establishment in question is not  
necessary for the support of civil government.

civil government, only as it is a means of sup­  
porting religion; and it be not necessary for the  
latter purpose, it cannot be necessary for the  
former. If Religion be not within the cogni­  
zance of civil government, how can its legal es­  
tablishment be said to be necessary to civil go­  
vernment? What influence, in fact, have eccle­  
siastical establishments had on civil society? In  
some instances they have been seen to erect a  
spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil au­  
thority; in many instances they have been seen  
upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in  
no instance have they been seen the guardians  
of the liberties of the people Rulers who wish­  
ed to subvert the public liberty, may have found  
an established clergy, convenient auxiliaries.—  
A just government, instituted to secure and per­  
petuate it, needs them not. Such a government  
will be best supported by protecting every citi­  
zen in the enjoyment of his Religion with the  
same equal hand, which protects his person,  
and-hi s property; by neither invading the equal  
rights of any sect; not suffering any sect to in­  
vade (hose ol another  
Because, The proposed establishment, is a  
depaiture from that generous policy; which, of­  
fering an asylum to the persecuted and oppress­  
ed of every nation and religion, promised a lus­  
tre to our country, and an accession to the num­  
ber of its citizens. What a melancholy mark  
is the bill of sudden degeneracy? Instead of  
j holding forth an asylum to the persecuted, it is  
&#x27; itself, a signal of persecution. It degrades  
i from the equal rank of citizens all those whose  
opinions in religion do not bend to those of the  
Legislative authority. Distant as it may be,  
in its present form from the Inquisition, it dif­  
fers from it only in degree. The one is the  
first step, the other the last in the career of in­  
tolerance. The magnanimous sufferer under  
this cruel scourge in foreign regions, must view  
the bill as a beacon on our coast, warning him  
to seek some other haven, * here liberty and  
philanthropy, in their due extent, may offer a  
more certain repose from his troubles.  
Because, It will have a like tendency to ban­  
| ish our citizens. The allurements presented  
by other situations are every day thinning their  
number. To superadd a fresh motive to emi- j  
gration, by revoking the liberty which they j  
now enjoy, would be the same species of folly,  
which has. dishonored ami depopulated flourish­  
ing kingdoms.  
  
Because, It will destroy that moderation and  
harmony which the forbearance of our laws to  
intermeddle with Religion, has produced a- !  
mongst its several sects. Torrents of blood  
have been spilt in .the old world, by vain at­  
tempts of the secular arm to extinguish reli­  
gious discord, by proscribing all difference in  
religious opinions. Time has at length reveal­  
ed the true remedy. Every relaxation of nar­  
row and rigorous policy, wherever it has been  
tried, has been found to assuage the disease.—  
The American theatre has exhibited proofs, that  
equal and complete liberty, if it does not whol­  
ly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys its mulig- j  
nant influence on the health and prosperity of  
the state. If, with the salutary effects of this  
system under our own eyes, we begin to con­  
tract the bonds of religious freedom, we know  
no name ’hat will too severely reproach our fol­  
ly. At least let warning be taken at the first  
fruits of the threatened innovation. The very  
appearance of the bill has transformed u that  
Christian forbearance, love and charity,” which  
of late mutually prevailed, into animosities and  
jealousies, which may not soon be appeased.—.  
What mischiefs may not be dreaded, should  
this enemy to the public quiet be armed with  
the force of a law.  
Because, The policy of the bill is adverse to  
the diffusion of the light of Christianity. The  
first wish of those who enjoy this precious gift,  
ought to be, that it may he imparted to the  
whole race of mankind. Compare the number  
of those who have as yet received it, with the  
number still remaining under the dominion of  
false religions; and how small is the former?—  
  
Does the policy oi me um lenu 10 lessen me  
disproportion? No: it at once discourages those  
who are strangers to the light of revelation  
from coming into the region of it; and counte­  
nances, by example, the nations who continue  
in darkness, in shutting out those who might ;  
convey it to them. Instead of levelling as far  
as possible, every ohstacle to the victorious pro- .  
gress of truth, the bill with an ignoble and un-1  
Christian timidity, would circumscribe it, with j  
a wall of defence, against the encroachments ot  
error.  
Because, Attempts to enforce by legal sanc­  
tions, acts obnoxious to so great a proportion of  
citizens, tend to enervate the laws in general,  
and to slacken the hands of society. It it be  
difficult to execute any law which is not gene­  
rally deemed necessary or salutary, what must­  
be the case, where it is deemed invalid and dan­  
gerous? And what may be the effect of so stii­  
king an example of impotency in the govern­  
ment, on its general authority.  
Because, A measure of such singular magni­  
tude and delicacy ought not to be imposed,  
without the clearest evidence that it is called  
for by a majority of citizens. And no satis­  
factory method is yet proposed, by which the  
voice of the majority in this case may be deter­  
mined, or its influence secured. “The people  
of the respective counties are indeed requested  
to signify their opinion respecting the adop­  
tion of the bill to the next session of Assembly.”  
But the representation must be made equal, be­  
fore the voice either of the representatives, or  
of the counties, will be that of the people. Our  
hope is, that neither of the former will, after  
due consideration, espouse the dangerous prin­  
ciple of the bill. Should the event disappoint  
us, it will still leave us in full confidence, that a  
fair appeal to the latter will reverse the sentence  
against our liberties.  
Because, Finally, “The equal right of every  
citizen to the free exercise of his religion, ac­  
cording to the dictates of conscience,” is held  
by the same tenure with all our other rights.  
If we recur to its origin, it is equally the gilt  
of nature; if we weigh its importance, it cannot  
be less dear to us; if we consult the “declaration  
of those rights which pertain to the good peo­  
ple of Virginia, as the basis and foundation of  
government,”§ it is enumerated with equal so­  
lemnity, or rather studied emphasis. Either  
then we must say, that the will of the Legisla­  
ture is the only measure.of their authority, and  
that in the plentitude of this authority, they  
$ Preamble to the Declaration of Rights.  
  
may sweep away all our fundamental rights; civ  
that they are bound to leave this particular  
right untouched and sacred. Either we must  
say, that they may control the freedom of the  
press; may abolish the trial by jury; may swal­  
low up the executive and judiciary powers of  
the state; nay, that they may despoil us of our  
very right of suffrage, and erect themselves into  
an independent and hereditary Assembly; or we  
must say, that they have no authority to enact  
into law the bill under consideration. We, the  
subscribers, say, that the General Assembly of  
this Commonwealth have po such authority:  
And that no effort may be omitted on our part  
against so dangerous an usurpation, we oppos&quot;e  
to it this remonstrance; earnestly praying, as  
we are in duty bound, that the Supreme Law­  
giver of the Universe, by illuminating those to  
whom it is addressed, may, on the one hand  
turn their councils from every act which would  
affront his holy prerogative; or violate the trust  
committed to them: And on the other, guide  
them into every measure which may be worthy  
of his blessing, may redound to their own praise,  
and may establish more tirmly the liberties, the

wealth

do it with a saking of his uilegiance to the Univer-  
sal Sovereign. We maintain, therefore, that in  
matters of religion, no man’s right is abridged by  
the institution of civil society; and that religion is  
wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is, that  
no other rule exists, by which any question which  
may divide a society, can be ultimatciy determined,  
but the will of the majority; but it is also true, that  
the majority may trespass on the rights of the mino-

Because, if religion be exempt from the authority  
ofthe society at urge, still less can it be subject to  
that of the legislatise body. The latter are but the  
creatures aud vicegerents of the former. Their ju-  
risdiction is both derivative and limited. Itis limit-

society on equal conditions, as relinquishing no more,  
and therefore retaining no jess, one than another, of  
their rights. Above all, are they to be considered  
as. retaining an “equal title to the free exercise of re-  
ligion according to the dictates of conscience.’  
  
hilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace,  
to profess and to observe the religion which we be-  
lieve to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an eqnal  
freedom to those, whose minds have not yet yielded  
to the evidence which has convinced us. If this free.  
dom be abused, it is an offence against God, not  
against man. To God, therefore, not to men, must  
an account of it be rendered. As the bill violates  
equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens; so it  
violates the same principle, by granting to others pe  
culiar exemptions. Are the Quakers and Menonists  
the only sects who think a compulsive support of  
their religions unnecessary and unwarrantable? Can  
their piety alone be intrusted with the care of public  
wership? Ought their religions to be endowed, above  
all others, with extraordinary privileges, by which  
proselytes may be enticed from all others? We think  
too favorably of the justice and good sense of these  
denominations, to believe, that they either covet pre-  
eminences over their fellow citizens, or that they  
will be seduced by them, from the common opposition  
to the measure.  
  
Because, The bill implies, either that the civil ma-  
gistrate is a competent judge of religious truth; or  
that he may employ religion as an engine cf civil po  
licy. The first is an arrogant pretension, falsified by  
the contradictory opinions of rulers in al) ages, and  
throughout the world: The second an unhallowed  
perversion of the means of salvation.  
  
Because, The establishment proposed by the bill  
as not requisite for the support of the Christian reli-  
gion. Tosay that itis, is a contradiction to the Chris-  
tian religion itself; for every page of it disavows a  
dependence on the powers of this world: It is 2 con-  
tradiction to fact; for it is known that this religion  
botb existed and tlourished, not only without the sup  
port of human laws, but in spite of every opposition  
trom them; and not only during the period of mira-  
culous aid, but long after it had been left to its own  
evidence, and the ordinary care of Providence: Nay,  
it isa contradiction in terms; for a religion pot in-  
vented by human policy, must have pre-existed and  
been supported, before it was established by human  
policy. It is moreover to weaken in those who pro  
fess this religion, a pious confidence in its innate ex-  
cellence, and the patronage of its author; and to fos-  
ter in those who sii!l reject it, a suspicion, that its  
friends are too conscious of its fallacies, to trust it to  
its own merits. i  
  
Because, Experience witnesseth, that ecclesiastical  
establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and  
efficacy of religion, have had a contrary operation.  
During almos! fifteen centuries, has the legal estab-  
lishment of christianity been on trial. What have  
been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride  
and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility  
in the laity;in both, superstition, bigotry and persecu-  
tion. Inquire of the teachers of Christianity for the  
ages in which it appeared in its greatest lustre; those  
of every sect point to the ages prior to its incorpora-  
tion with civil policy. Propose a restoration of this  
primitive state, in which its teachers depended on  
the voluntary rewards of their flocks; many of them  
predict its downfall. On which side ought their tes-  
timony to have greatest weight, when for, or when  
against their interest? Pre  
  
Because, The establishment in question is not ne-  
cessary for the support of civil government. If it be  
urged as necessary for the support of civil govern-  
ment, only as itis a means of supporting religion;  
  
  
  
as

and itis not necessary for the Jatter purpose, it car-  
not be necessary for the former. If religion be not  
within the cognizance of civil government, how can  
its legal establishment be said to be necessary to civil  
government? What influence, in fact, have eccle-  
siastical establishments had on civil society? In  
some instances they have been seen to erect a spiri-  
tual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority; in  
many instances they have been seen upholding the  
thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they  
been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people.  
Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty, may  
have found an established clergy convenient auxilia-  
ries. A just government, instituted to secure and  
perpetuate it, needs them not. Such a government  
will be best supported by protecting every citizen in  
the enjoyment of his religion with the same equal  
band, which protects his person, and his property; by  
neither invading the equal rights of any sect; not suf-  
fering any sect to invade those of another.  
  
Because, The proposed establishment, is a depar-  
ture from that generous policy; which, offering an  
asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every na-  
tion and religion, promised a lustre to our country,  
and an accession to the number of its citizens. What  
a melancholy mark is the bill of sudden degeneracy?  
Instead of holding forth an asylum to the persecuted,  
it is itself, a signal of persecution. It degrades from  
the equal rank of citizens all those whose opinions  
in religion do not bend to those of the legislative au-  
thority Distant as it may be, in its present form  
from the inquisition, it differs from it only in de-  
gree. The one isthe first step, the other the last in  
the career of intolerance. The magnanimous suf-  
ferer under this cruel scourge in foreign regions,  
must view the bill as a beacon on our coast warning  
him to seek some other haven, where liberty and  
philanthropy, in their due extent, may ofler a more  
certain repose from his troubles.  
  
Because, It will have a like tendency to banish our  
ciuzens. The allurements presented by other situa-  
tions are every day thinning their number. To su-  
peradd a fresh molive to emigration, by revoking the  
liberty which they now enjoy, would be the same  
species of foily, which has dishonored and depopuiat-  
ed flourishing kisgdoms.  
  
Because, It will destroy that moderation and har-  
mony Which the forbearance of our Jaws to inter-  
meddle with religion, has produced amongst its seve-  
ral sects. Torrents of blood have been spilt in the  
old world, by vain attempts of the secular arm to ex-  
tinguish re&#x27;igious discord, by proseribing all differ-  
ence in religious opinions. Time has at length re-  
vealed the true remedy. Every relaxation of nar-  
row and rigorous policy, wherever it has been tried,  
has been found to assuage the disease. —The Ameri-  
can theatre has exhibited proofs. that equal and com-  
plete liberty, if it does not wholy eradicate it, suffi-  
ciently destroys its malignant influence on the health  
and prosperity of the state. If, with the salutary ef-  
fects of this system under our own eyes, we begin  
to contract the bonds of religious freedom, we knew  
no name that will too severely reproach our folly.  
At least, let warning be taken at the first fruits of the  
threatened innovation. The very appearance of the  
bill has transformed “that Christian forbearance, love  
and charity,’ which of late mutually prevailed, into  
animosities and jealousies, which may not soon be  
appeased.— What misehiefs may not be dreaded,  
should this enemy to the public quiet be armed with  
the force of a law.  
  
Because. The policy of the bill is adverse to the  
diffusion of the light of Christianity. The first wish  
of those who enjoy this precious gift, ought to be,  
that it may be imparted to the whole race of mankind.  
Compare the number of those who have as yet re-  
ceived it, with the number still remaining under the

To the Honorable the General Assembly nf the Com  
womrealth of Virginia  
a memorial and remonstrance.  
Wc, the subscribers, citizens of the said Com  
monwcaltli, having taken into serious consideration  
a Bill primed by order ol the last session of the  
General Assembly, entitled &quot; A Bill establishing a  
Provision lor Teachers of the Christian Religion,&quot;)_  
&#x27;ting that the same ; if finally armed with 1  
Pttd tone?  
  
the sanctions of a law, will be a dangerous abuse ol  
power, are bound, as hibhful members of a Iree  
State, to remonstrate against it ; and to declare the  
reasons oy which we are determined. We remon  
strate against the said Bit&#x27;,  
Because, We hold it for a fundamental and unde  
niable truth, &quot; that Religion or the duty which we  
to our Creator, and the manner of discharging  
it, cln be directed only by reason and conviction,  
not by force or violence.&quot;* &quot;1 he Religion then ol  
every man must be left to the conviction and con  
science of every man; and it is the right of every  
man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right  
is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unaliena­  
ble; because the opinions of men, depending only  
on the evidence contemplated in their own minds,  
cannot follow the dictates of other men : It is una  
lienable also ; because what is here a right towards  
men, is a duty towards the Creator It is the duty  
of every man to render to the Creator such homage,  
and such only, as he believes to be acceptable to him ;  
this duty is precedent, both in order ol time, and in  
degree of obligation, to the claims of civil society  
Before any man can be considered a member ol civil  
society, lie must be considered as a subject ol the  
Governor of the Universe: And if a member of  
civil society, who enters into any subordinate asso­  
ciation, must always do it with a reservation of his  
duty to the general authority ; much more must  
every man who becomes a member of any particu­  
lar civil society, do it with a saving o( Ins allegiance  
to the Universal Sovereign. Wc maintain, there­  
fore, that in matters of religion, no man&#x27;s right is  
abiidged by the institution ot civil r-ciety ; and that  
■eltgion is wholly exempt from its cognizance.  
Tiue it is, that no other rule exists, by which any  
question which may divide a society, can be ultimate­  
ly determined, but the will of the majority : but it  
is also tine, that the majority may trespass on the  
rights of the minority,  
owe  
Because, If religion be exempt from the authori­  
ty of the society at laige, still less can it be subject  
to that ol the Legislative Body. The latter ate but

The freemen of Ametica did not wait till usurped  
power had strengthened itself by exercise, ai d ett  
tangled the qu stion in precedents. They saw all  
[the consequences in the principle, and they avoided  
ttic consequences by denying the principle. We  
[revere this less n loo much, soon to lorget it.—  
Who does not see that the same auihotity which  
an establish ClwU&#x27;ianity, in exclusion of ail other  
Religions, may establi-lt, with the tame case, any  
pat ticu&#x27;ar feu of Clnis&#x27;ians. in exclusion of all other

tv h&gt;r the support ol any one establishment, may  
l0,fe ,nm to c &quot;&quot; lor n&#x27; tu any other establishment in  
al 1 cases whatsoever ?  
Because. The bill violates that equality which  
ought to be the basts oi every law; and wi. ich is  
&#x27; norc intli M&gt;tnsable, in proportion as the validity or  
ex Pe&#x27; 1 &#x27;*nry ol any law is more liable to be impeach  
H &quot; a&#x27;l nien are by nature equally fice and in

to be considered as retaining an &quot; equal title to the

cannot deny an equal ttecdoni to those, whose minds  
have not yet yield&#x27; d to the evidence which lias con­  
vittced us. If this Iteedom be abused, it is an of  
lencc  
or»e  
  
1 lencc against God, not against man : To God there  
fine, not to men, must an account of it be rendered.  
As the bill violates equality by subjecting some to  
1 peculiar burdens; soit violates the same principle,  
&#x27;° R eCU &#x27;&#x27; ar &#x27; *ernp„o„s. At e

Because, The bill implies, either . liât the Civil  
Magistrate is a competent judge of religious truth ;  
or that he may employ religion as an engine of ci  
vil policy. The first is an arrogant pretension, falsift  
ed by the contradictory opinions of rulers in all ages,  
arid throughout the wotld: The second an unhal­  
lowed pet ver-iun of the means of salvation.  
Becanse, The establishment proposed by the bill  
is not requisite (or the support of the Christian Re­  
ligion. To »ay that it is, is a contradiction to the  
Christian Religion tl-elf ; for every page of it disa­  
vows a dependence on the powers of this world: It  
is a contradiction to fact; for it is known that litis  
Religion both existed and flourished, not only with­  
out tlie support of human laws, but in spite of every  
opjiosition from them, and not only during the pe  
iiod of miraculous aid. but long alter it had been

of its author; and to foster in those who stii! reject  
it, a suspicion, that its friends are too conscious o!  
its fallacies, to trust it to its own merits.  
Because, Experience witnessed., that ecclesiasti  
cal establishments, instead of maintaining the pun­  
ty and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary ope­  
ration. During almost lilteen centuries, has the le­  
gal establishment of Christianity been on trial.—  
What have been its Iruits ? More or less in all pla­  
ces, pride and indolence in the Clorgy ; ignorance  
and servility in the laity ; in both, superstition, bigo-1  
try and persecution. Inquire ol the tcacheis of j  
Christianity lor the ages in which it appeared in its!  
greatest lustre ; those ol every sect point to the ages  
prior to its incorporation with civil policy- Propose i  
a restoration of this primitive state, in which its;  
teachers depended on the voluntary rewards uf their j  
Bocks ; many of them predict its downfall. On i  
which side ought their testimony to have greatest j  
weight, when for, or when against their interest f  
Because, The establishment in question is r.ot j  
necessary for the support of civil government. II |  
it be urged as necessary lor the support of civil go­  
vernment, only as it is a means of supporting leli­  
gion; and it be nut necessary lor the latter pur­  
pose, it cannot be necessary for the former. II Be­  
ligion be not within the cognizance of civil govern­  
ment, how can its legal establishment,be said to be !  
necessary to civil government? What influence, in  
fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on civil  
society? In some instances they have been seen to  
erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil au  
tbority ; in many instances they have been seen up­  
holding the thrones of political tyranny; in no in­  
stance have they been seen the guardians of the li­  
bertiesof the people. Rulers who wished to sub­  
ol  
;  
vert the public liberty, may have found an establish-1  
ed clergy, convenient auxiliaries. A just govern  
ment, instituted to secure and perpetuate it, netds  
them not. Such a government will be best support- &#x27;  
ed by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of  
his Religion with the same equal hand, which pro !  
tects Ins person, and Ins proi erty : by neither invad­  
ing the equal tights ol any sect; nut suffering any j  
sect to invade those ot another, I  
Because, The proposed establishment is a depar !  
tore Iront that generous policy ; which, ofleiing an  
asylum to the peisecuted an«, opptessed of every na I  
tion and religion, ptotnised a lustre to our cottnlty.l

Because, It will have a like tendency tu banish 1  
our citizens. The allurements presented by oilier

What a melancholy matk is lie hill, ol sudden de

the persecuted, it is itseli a signal of persecution.  
It deg&#x27;ades front the equal rank of citizens all those

to be, that it may &#x27;oe imparled to the whole tace of  
mankind. Compare me number of those who  
have as yet received it, with ttic number still re i  
maimng under the dominion of false religions ; and [  
how small is the iormerr Does the policy of the[  
bill tend to lessen the disproportion ? No : it at once ]  
discourages those who are strangers to the light of !  
revelation from corning into the region of it; and i  
countenances, by example, the nations who tontinue

Warren, R. L. Saturday Morning, December 9, 18286.  
  
}it i 9 ihat no other rule exists,by which  
1 uny Juestion which may divide a soie­  
tg; ¢an be ultimately &quot;e!irhmined, but  
the ‘will of the majorily ;Dut itis also  
trae, that the majorily muy trespass on  
the rights of the minority, ™  
Because,&#x27;if’ religion be exempt froi  
mh authority of. ‘the “dociety . at arge,  
Istill less cam it be l?( to that ome  
leginluivﬁ&#x27;od“ ‘body. The latterfare but  
the&#x27;er dicegerents of the for |  
wer. . r Jaristiction s botb deriy­  
ative and limited, It&#x27;is limited with re&#x27;  
gard to the co-ordinate depurtments ; |  
more neceesarily is it limited with re.  
gard to ‘the coustituents—the preser­  
vation of&#x27;n ‘free government requiies  
uot merely that the inetes and ‘bounds  
which separate each depirtment of pow  
‘€r be invariably maintained ; hut more  
especially, that neither of them be suf  
fered ‘to overleap the great bavrier  
which defends the rights of the people.  
The rolers who are guilty of such au  
eacroachment, exceed the cotomission  
from which they derive their authority,  
and are tyraots, ‘The people who sub­  
mil toit are goveérned by laws mude  
neither by themsclves, nor by an gu­  
thority derived fiom them ; and are|  
slaves,  
  
‘Because, it is proper to take alart  
at&#x27;the first experiment upon our liber­  
ties. ‘&#x27;We hold this prudent jealousy to  
‘bc the first duty of ci‘izens and one ot  
&#x27; the nobi.et ¢haracteristicks of the Jufe  
revolution, ‘kFhe freemen of America  
’did not wait till usirped power hud  
strengtheneditself by exercise, nad co­  
tangled the question in -precedents,   
They saw ail the counsequences in the  
‘principle, and they avoided te conse­  
‘quences by denyiug the princi;le. We  
revere thiv lesson&#x27;too much, soan to  
forgetit. Who does not see that the  
same authority which can estublish  
Christianity, in exclusion of all other re  
ligions, may establish with the same  
ease, any particolar sect of Christians,  
in exclusion of nll other sdcts ? &#x27;l‘lmti  
the same authority whith can Torce a  
ciiize) locoutrivnte three-pence only |  
of his property for the support of auyl  
one esiablishmeot, miy force him to  
conform to any o:her establishment inf  
ail cases whatsoeven,  
  
Because, the bill violates that equal­  
ity which ought 1o be the bass of eve­  
(ry law ; and which is mere indispen­  
| sable, in proportion as the validity or  
&#x27;expedieacy of any law is mor@iabie to  
be impeached. If ““all men are by  
nature free and independent,’” ail men  
are to be considered as entering ino  
society on eqaal conditions, as relin­  
quishes no m)re, and therefore retain­  
ing no less, one than another, of thewr  
rightss Above all, are they (o be con­  
ered as retaining an *‘ equal title to  
m%ee exercise of religion according  
1o the diciates of conscience.” Whilst  
‘we asscrt for ouselves a freedom i  
embrace, to profess and to ohscrve the  
religion which we bheheve to be of di­  
vine origin, we cannot deny an equal  
freedom to thrse, whose minds have  
noi yet yielded to the evidence which  
has convinced us. If this ireedom be  
abused, it is an offence against God, not  
against man. ‘T&#x27;o God, therefore, nit  
to men, wust an account ot it be ‘rea­  
dered. As the biil violates equali&#x27;y by  
subjecting sowme 1o peculi.r burdens ;  
oit violates the same principle, by  
granting to others peculiar exemptions.  
Are the Quakers and Menonists the  
ouly sects who thiuk a compulsive ‘up-&#x27;  
port of their religions unnecessary and  
unwairantable 2 Can their piety alove  
be intrusted with the care of publick  
worship ? Ought their religions to be  
erdowed, above all others, with extra­  
ordina~y privileges, by which piose-  
Iytes may be eunticed from all others?  
We think too favourably of the justice.  
  
and govd sense of these denominations  
to pelieve that they eitheg covet pre­  
eminence over their fellow citigens, or  
that they will be seduced by them,from  
the commor opposition Lo thé* measure.  
Becunse, the bill imphes, cither that  
the civil inagistrate is u competent judge  
of religious truth ; or that he may em  
ploy religion as an engine of civil poli­  
cys &#x27;Lhe birst ie an arrogint preten­  
awons, fulsified by the contiadictory o­  
pivions of rulers in all ages and through  
out theworld, &#x27;The second an vobal­  
lowed perversion of the means of val­  
vatton. ’ )  
  
Because, the establishment pioposed  
by the bill is not requisite for the sup­  
port of the Cliristian religion. To say  
that it is, is a contradiction to that re­  
ligion Wsell&#x27;; for every page of it disa­  
vows ¥ dependence on the powers of  
  
Be e R RNI R ———— ————— v e  
Our God, Our Country, Qur—selves.  
  
this wrﬂ. It is a contradiction ta fact  
for itis vu that this religion both  
existed and flodrished, ot on&#x27;y withuut  
the support wnmm lawe, but i spite  
_of every oppbeition from them ; and  
i potonly duringthe period of mniraca­  
louy aid, but long after it bad been left  
to its vwn evidence, and the ordivary,  
cafe of Providence. Nay, itis a *on-,  
teadiction inxrr a religion not -  
} venteq by h ‘policy, must have pre  
.e(wtd ‘and been supported, before it  
was established by human policy. It  
is, woreover to weaken ‘in those ‘who  
‘profess Uns religiqn, a pious confidence  
in its innate excellence, and the ‘pa—  
trooage of its author, and to foster in  
thuse who stiil reject it, a suspicion,  
that its friends are too conscious of its  
fallacies, to trust it to its own merits.  
Because, experieuce witnes-eth, that  
ecclesiasticy] establishments, instesd of  
maintainiog the purity and eflicacy of  
religion, have had a contrary opera-&#x27;  
tion. During alnost fif een centurie-.l  
has the legal establishment of cheistian- |  
ity beea on trial, Wl&amp;:&#x27;:mve been its |  
fraits? More or less in all places,  
pride and indoleuce in the clergy ; ig­  
norance and servility in the luity, in  
both, superstition, igotry and percse- ]  
cation. Toquire of the teachers of‘  
christianity for the ages in wineh it dp- !  
peared in its greatest lustre : those of |  
every sect point to the ages prior to  
18 incorporation with civil pulicy.—-‘  
Propose a restoratiun of this p‘imitis&#x27;ei  
state, in wiluch its teachers depended on |  
the voluntary rewards of their &#x27;flocks ; |  
many of them predict its downfall. On |  
which side ought their testinmony to  
bave greatest weght when fur, or when  
agaiust their ioterest ?  
Becauve, the ‘establishinentin ques­  
tion is not necessary fur the support  
of civil government. If it be urged as  
necessary for the support of civil gov­  
ernment, ouly as itls a means of sup~  
perting religion ; and as it is 7ot neces­  
sury for the lutter parpose, it cannot be  
necessary for (he former. {f religion  
be not within the cognizance of ecivil  
government 7 What influence, in fact,  
[have ecclesiastical establishments had  
‘on civil wocisty ? In some instances  
they have been seen to erect a spiritu­  
al tyranny on the roius of the civil 4a­  
{!horily; In many instances they have  
been seen upholding the thrones of po­  
hticad tyranny ;10 oo instance have they  
I&#x27;been seen the guardians of the liberijes

Beciuse, the prop’osed‘éﬂiblichﬁ:  
is a departure from that genernus poh­  
cy, which, offering an asylum to the  
persecuted and oppressed of every na­  
tion and religion, promised a lustre to  
our country and un accession to the  
numuer o&#x27;ﬁ‘ls citizens. What a melan­  
choly mafk isthe bill of sudden degen­  
eracy ! losteud of holding forth an  
asylum to the persecuted, it is iteelf a  
sigual of persecution. It degrades from  
the equal rank of citizens all whose o­  
pinfons in religion do not beod to those  
of the legislative authority, Distant as  
it may be in its present form, from the  
inquisition, it ditfers from it ooly in de­  
gree. I&#x27;hé one is the first step, the  
other the last in the career of intoler­  
ance. I&#x27;he magnsnimuus sufferer un  
der this cruel scourge in foreign re­  
gions; must view the bill as a beacon on  
our coust warning him to seek some  
other baven, where ligerty and philan­  
thropy, in their due .extent, may of  
fer a more certain rej se from hie  
troubles.  
  
. Because, it will have a like ten­  
dency to banish our citizens. The  
allurements presented by other situ­  
avions uve every day thinning their  
pumbers I&#x27;o superadd a fresh mo­  
tive to amigration, by revoking the  
liberty which they now enjoy,would  
be the same species of folly, which  
has dishonoured and depopulated  
fourishing kingdoms.  
Because, it will destroy that mod  
cration and harmouy which the for­  
pearance of our laws to intermeddlc  
with religion, has produced amongst  
its scvmﬁ gets, Torrents of bleed  
  
rave beon spilt in the old world, by  
vai&#x27;u tttit&#x27;mpls of the wecular arm to  
extinguish religious discord, by proa­  
scribing u&#x27;lil d.i%ennce in rfl{g&#x27;i:us  
opinion. Tige at Jength res

Inxation sf narrow and rigovous pol  
icy, wWhe has been tried, has  
been fogind to -ll‘boge the disease,~-  
Whe American theatre has exhibited  
proofs, That ‘equal and complete lib­  
erty, ifit does not wholly eradicate  
its sulliciently destroys its malignant  
influence on the health and prosper­  
ity of the state. If, with the salu.  
tury efects of this system ‘under our  
sWn eyes. we begin to contract the  
bonds of religious treedom, we know  
no namo that will sufliciently re­  
proach our folly. At least, lot warn  
ing be taken at the first fruits of this  
threatened innovation, The very  
appedrance of the bill&#x27;has transform­  
¢d. ¢ that christian forbearance,love  
and charity,” which of late ‘mntually  
prevailed, into annimosities and jeal­  
ousies, which may not ‘sson be ap­  
peased. What mischiefs may net be  
dreaded, should this enemy to the  
publick quiet be-armed with the force  
uf a law,  
Becanse, The policy of the bill is  
adverse to the diffacidh of the light  
ol Christianity, The first wish of  
those who enjoy this precious gift,  
ought to be, that it may be impart­  
ed to the whole *race of mankind,  
Compare the number of thase who  
have as yet received it, with the num  
er still remaining under thie ‘dowmin­  
ion of false ‘religions ; and how  
small is the former ?~..Does the pol.  
icy of the bill tend to lessen the dis­  
proportion ? No : it at owce dis­  
courages those who are strangers to  
the light of revelation from coming  
ito the region of it 3 and ‘counte­  
hances, by ‘example, the nations  
who continye in darkness,in shatting  
aat those Who might convey it to  
them. . Insfead of levelling as far  
as posisble, every wobstacle to the  
victorious progress of truth, the bill  
with an ignoble and unchristian tim­  
idity, would circumscribe ity with a  
wall of defence, against the en­  
croachments of error. &#x27;  
Be cause, Attempts to enforce by le­  
g3l sanctions, and obnoexious to so great  
a 4 propurtion of ¢itizens, tend to ener­  
vate the laws in geoeral, and to slack­  
en the bands of society. 17 it be-diffi­  
cult to execute any law which is not[  
genertdly deemedinecedsary or aaluta~  
ry, what must be the case where it is  
deemed invalid and dangerous - And  
what may be the effect «f so striking  
an example of impotency in the gov­  
ernment, on its genecal authority. !  
Because, A measure of such singn­  
lar magnitude and dehcacy ought net  
to be imposed, without the clearest cv-&#x27;  
idence that it is called for by a majori­  
ty a&quot;c&#x27;{t&#x27;uelns. And no satisfactory |  
&quot;&#x27;,e(hod I 8 yet &#x27;“l‘(jseil. b.:&#x27; which thef  
voice of the majority in this case wmay  
he determined, or its inw securs

counties are indeed requested o siy­

ion of the bill to the next session of  
assembly.”” But the representation  
must be made equal, before the voice  
either of the Reprentatives, or of the  
cuunties wiil be that of the people  
Oar hope is, that neither ol the former  
will, after due constderation, espouse  
(he dangerous principle of the billi—  
Shouid the eveat disappoint us, itwill  
sti!l leave us in full confidence, that a  
fair appeal to the latter will reverse  
the sentence against our hiberties.  
Because, Finally; *“ the equal right  
of every citizen to the free exercise of  
his religion, according to the ductates&lt;  
of conscicnce,” is held by the same  
tenuré with all our other rights. If  
we recur to its origin, &#x27;t is equally the  
gift of nature ; if we wel‘?h its impor­  
tance, itcannot be less dear to us ; if  
we weigh its imporiance, it cannot  
be less dear to us ; if we consult the  
declaration of those rights which per­  
tain to the good people of Virginis, es  
the basis and fouudation of govern.  
ment,”§ it is enumerated with equal  
solemaity, or rather studied emphasis.  
Either then we must say, that the will  
of the legislature is the only measure  
of their authority, and that, iu the  
plentitude of this authority, they nfay  
sweep away all our fundemental  
rights ; oF WAt they wig beund to Jeavg

To the Honourable the General Assembly of the Common-  
wealth of Virginia: a Memorial and Remonstrance.  
  
We, the subscribers, citizens of the said commonwealth,  
having taken into serious consideration a bill printed by  
order of the last session of the General Assembly, entitled,  
‘+A Bill establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Chris-  
tian Religion,” and conceiving that the same, if finally  
armed with the sanctions of a law, will be a dangerous  
abuse of power, are bound, as faithful members of a free  
state, to remonstrate against it, and to declare the reasons  
by which we ‘are determined. We remonstrate against  
the said bill,

ECCLBSIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS. i5  
  
The religion, then, of every man must be left to the con-  
viction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of  
every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right  
is, in its nature, an unalienable right. Itis unalienable,  
because the opinions of men, depending only on the evi-  
dence contemplated in their own minds, cannot follow the  
dictates of other men: it is unalienable also, because what  
is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator.  
It is the duty of every’ man to render to the Creator such  
homage, and such , as he believes to be acceptable to  
him; this duty is precedent, both in order of time and in  
degree of obligation, to the claims of civil society. Before  
any man can be considered a member of civil society, he  
must be considered as a subject of the Governor of the uni-  
verse; and if a member of civil society, who enters into any  
subordinate association, must always do it with a reserva-  
tion of his duty to the general authority, much more must.  
every man who becomes a member of any particular civil  
society do it with the saving of his allegiance to the Univer-  
sal Sovereign. We maintain, therefore, that in matters of  
religion, no man’s right is abridged by the institution of  
civil society ; and that religion is wholly exempt from its  
cognizance. True it is, that no other rule exists by which  
any question which may divide a society can be ultimately  
determined, but the will of the majority; but it is also  
true, that the majority may trespass on the rights of the  
minority.  
  
Because, if religion be exempt from the authority of the  
society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the  
legislative body. The latter are but the creatures and  
vicegerents of the former. Their jurisdiction is both de-  
rivative and’ limited. It is limited with regard to the  
co-ordinate departments; more necessarily is it limited  
with regard to the constituents. The preservation of a  
free government requires not merely that the metes and  
bourmls which separate each department of power be inva-  
riably maintained, but more especially, that neither of  
them be suffered to overleap the great barrier which de-  
fends the rights of the people. The rulers who are guilty  
of such an encroachment, exceed the commission from  
which they derive their authority, and are tyrants. The  
people who submit to it, are governed by laws made neith-  
er by themselves nor an authority derived from them, and  
are slaves.

Because, it is proper to take alarm at the first experi-  
ment on our liberties, We hold this nt jealousy to  
be the first duty of citizens, and one of the noblest 1  
acteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of Amer-  
ica did net wait till u wer had stre ned itself  
I seers and en ed question in precedents. —  
  
ey saw all the consequences in the principle, and they  
avoided the consequences by denyi the principle. We  
revere this lesson too much, soon to forget it. ho does  
not see that the same authority which can establish Chris-  
a in exclusion of all other religions, may establish  
with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in  
exclusion of all other sects? That the same authority  
which can force a citizen to contribute th nce only  
of his property for the support of only one establishment,  
may force him to conform to any one establishment, in al!  
cases whatsoever? :  
  
Because, the bill violates that equality which ought to be  
the basis of every law, and which is more indispensible in  
  
ion as the validity or expediency of any law is more  
  
e tobe impeached. If ‘+all men are by nature equal-  
  
ly free and independent,’’* all men are to be considered as  
entering into ten fg equal conditions, as relinquishing  
RO more, and retaining no less, one than another,  
ef their rights, Above all, are they to be considered as  
retaining an *‘equal title to the free exercise of religion,  
according to the dictates of conscience.”+ Whilst we as-  
sert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess, and to  
observe, the religion which we believe to be of divine ori-  
gin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to those-whose  
minds have not yet yielded to the evidence which has con-  
vinced us. If this freedom be abused, it is an offence  
against God, not against man: to God, therefore, not to  
men, must an account of it be rendered, As the bill vio-  
lates equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens, so  
it violates the same sineiels by granting to others pecu-  
liar exemptions. Are the Quakers and Mennonists the  
only sects who think compulsive support of their religions  
unnecessary and unwarrantable ? Can their piety alone be  
entrusted with the care of public worship?  
ligions to be endowed, above all others, with extraordinary  
privileges, by which proselytes may be enticed from all

others? We think too favorably of the justice and  
sense of these denominations to believe that they either  
covet pre-eminences over their fellow citizens, or that they  
will be seduced by them from the common opposition to  
the measure.  
  
Because, the bill implies, either that the civil is-  
trate is a competent judge of truth, or that he may employ  
religion as an engine of civil policy.. The first is an arro-  
gant pretension, falsified by the contradictory opinions of  
rulers in all ages and throughout the world: the second,  
an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation.  
  
Because, the establishment proposed by the bill is not  
requisite for the support of the Christian Religion. To  
say that it is, is a contradiction to the Christian Religion  
itself ; for every page of it disavows a dependence on the  
  
wers of this world: itis a contradiction to fact; for it is  
  
nown: that this religion both existed and flourished, not.  
only without the support of human laws,. but in spite of  
every opposition from them; and not only during the period  
of miraculous aid, but long after it had been left to its  
own evidence, and the ordinary care of Providence. Nay,  
it is a contradiction in terms; for a religion not invented  
by human policy, must have pre-existed and been supported  
before it was established by human policy. It is,. more-  
over, to weaken in those who profess this religion, a pious  
confidence in its innate excellence and: the patronage of its  
Author; and to foster in those who still reject it, a suspi-  
cion, that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies to  
trust it to its own merits.  
  
Because, experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical estab-  
lishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy  
of religion, have had a contrary operation. During almost  
fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christiani-  
ty been on trial. What have been its fruits ? More or less,  
in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance  
and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and  
persecution. Inquire of the teachers of Christianity for  
the ages in which it appeared in its greatest lustre; those  
of every sect point to the ages prior to its incorporation  
with civil policy. Propose a restoration of this primitive  
state, in which its teachers depended on the voluntary re-  
wards of their flocks; many of them predict its downfall.  
On which side ought their testimony to have greatest  
weight, when for, or when against their interest ?

Because, the establishment in question is not necessary  
for the support of civil government. If it be urged as ne-  
cessary for the support of civil government only as it is a  
means of supporting religion, and if it be not necessary for  
the latter purpose, it cannot be necessary for the former.  
if cm Sa be not within the cognizance of civil govern-  
ment, how can its legal establishment be said to be neces-  
pen? het government? What influence, in fact, have  
ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In some  
instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny  
on the ruins of the civil authority; in many instances they  
have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny;  
in no instance have they been seen the guardians of the  
liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the  
public liberty, may have found an established clergy con-  
venient auxiharies. A just government, instituted to  
secure and perpetuate it, needs them not. Such a govern-  
ment will be best supported by protecting every citizen  
im the enjoyment of his religion, with the same equal hand  
which protects his person and his property; by neither in-  
vading the equal rights of any sect, nor suffering any sect  
to invade one of 2 ae zt  
  
Because, the proposed establishment is a departure  
from that generous policy, which, offering an asylum  
to the persecuted and oppressed of every nation and  
religion, promised a lustre to our country, and an acces-  
sion to the number of its citizens. What a melancholy  
mark is the bill, of sudden degeneracy! Instead of holding  
forth an asylum to the persecuted, it is itself a signal of  
  
persecution. It es from the equal rank of citizens  
all those whose opinions in religion do not bend to those  
of the legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its  
  
nt from the Inquisition, it differs from it only  
in degree. The one is the first step, the other the last, in  
the career of intolerance. The magnanimous sufferer un-  
der this cruel scourge in foreign regions, must view the  
bill as a beacon on our coast, warning him to seek some  
other haven, where liberty and philanthro hy, im their  
— extent, may offer a more certain repose from his trou-  
  
es. ;  
  
Becsuse, it will have a like tendency to banish our citi-  
zens. ‘The allurements presented by other situations are  
every day thinning their number. To superadd a fresh

now enjoy, would be the same species of folly which has  
dishonoured and fe te hay flourishing kingdoms.  
Because, it will destroy the moderation and harmony,  
which the forbearance of our laws to intermeddle with reli-  
gion has produced amongst its several sects. Torrents of  
blood have been spilt in the old world by vain attempts of  
the secular arm to extinguish religious discord, y pro-  
scribing all difference in religious opinions.—-Time has at  
length revealed the true remedy. Every relaxation of  
narrow and vigorous policy, wherever it has been tried,  
has been found to assuage the disease. The American  
theatre has exhibited oe that equal anc complete lib-  
erty, if it does not wholly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys  
its malignant influence on the health and prosperity of the  
state. if, with the salutary effects of this system under  
| our own eyes, we begin to contract the bounds of religious  
freedom, we know no name that will too severely reproach  
our folly. At least, let warning be taken at the first  
fruits of the threatened innovation. The very appearance  
of the bill has transformed ‘‘that christian forbearance,  
love and charity,” which of late mutually prevailed, into  
animosities and jealousies, which may not soon be appeased.  
What mischiefs may not be dreaded, should this enemy to  
the public quiet be armed with the force of a law!  
Because, the policy of the bill is adverse to the diffusion.  
of the light of Chistian The _ wish of those who  
enjoy this precious gift ought to be, that it may be impart-  
kt the whole padeted oaekind. Compare the tebe re  
those who have as yet received it, with the number still  
remaining under the dominion of false Pe and how  
small is the former! Does the policy of the bill tend to les-  
son the disproportion? No: it at once discourages those  
who are strangers to the light of revelation, from coming  
into the region of it; and countenances, by example, the  
nations who continue in darkness, in shutting out those  
who might convey it to them. Instead of levelling as far  
as possible, every obstacle to the victorious progress of  
truth, the bill, with an ignoble and unchristian timidity,  
would cireumscribe it with a wall of defence against the  
encroachments of error. .  
Because, attempts to enforce by legal sanctions, acte  
obnoxious to so great a proportion of citizens, tend to en-  
ervate the kaws in general, and to slacken the bands of so-  
clety. Ifit be difficult to execute any law which is not

generally deemed necessary or salutary, what must be the  
case where it is deemed invalid and dangerous? And  
what may be the effect of so striking an example of impo-  
tency in the government or its general authority ?  
Because, a measure of such general magnitude and del-  
icacy ought not to be imposed, without the clearest evi-  
dence Rat it is called for by a majority of citizens: and no  
satisfactory method is yet proposed by which the voice of  
the majority in this case may be determined, or its influence  
secured. ‘*The people of the respective counties are in-  
deed requested to signify their opinion, respecting the  
adoption of the bill, to the next session of Assembly.” —  
But the representation must be made equal, before the  
voice either of the representatives or the counties will be  
that of the people. —Our hope is, that neither of the former  
will, after Tie consideration, espouse the dangerous prin-  
ciple of the bill. Should the event disappoint us, it will  
still leave us in full confidence that a fair appeal to the  
latter will reverse the sentence against our liberties.  
Because, finally, ‘the equal right of every citizen to  
the free exercise of his religion, according to the dictates  
of conscience,” is held by the same tenure with all our  
other rights. If we recur to its origin, it is equally the  
ift of nature; if we weigh its importance it cannot be less  
deir to us; if we consult the ‘* declaration of those rights  
which pertain to the good people of Virginia, as the basis  
and foundation of government,’”* it is enumerated with  
equal solemnity, or rather studied emphasis. Either, then,  
we must say, that the will of the legislature is the only  
measure of their authority, and that in the plentitude of  
this authority they may sweep away all our fundamental  
rights; or, that they are bound to leave this particular  
right untouched and sacred: either we must say, that they  
may controul the freedom of the press, may abolish the  
trial by jury, may swallow up the executive and judiciary  
wers of the state; nay, that they may despoil us of our  
very right of suffrage, and erect themselves into an inde-  
pendent and hereditary assembly; or we must say, that  
they have no authority to enact into law the bill under  
consideration. We, the subscribers, say, that the general  
assembly of this commonwealth, have no such authority;  
and that no effort may be omitted, on our part against so  
dangerous an usurpation, we oppose to it this remon

united with regard to the co-ordinate departments; more  
locessarily is it limited with regard to the constituents. The

submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves,  
1 er by an authority derived from them, and arc slaves.  
To say that legislative enactments arc requisite for thesup­  
jort of the Christian religion, is a contradiction to the Cliris­  
ian religion itself; for every page of it disuvows a dependence  
on the powers of this world: it is a contradiction to fact; for  
t is known that this religion both existed nnd flourished, not  
jnlv without the support of human laws, but in spite of every  
opposition from them; and not only during the period of  
uiraculous aid, but long after it had been left to its own evi­  
lence, and the ordinary care of Providence. Nay, it is a  
•ontradiction in terms; for a religion not invented by human  
loliuy must have pre-existed and been supported before it was  
stablished by human policy. It is, moreover, to weaken in  
hose who profess this religion a pious confidence in its innate  
xcellenco, and the patronage of its Author; and to foster in  
luise who still reject it, a suspicion tliut its friends are too  
onscious of its fallacies to trust it to its own merits.  
Torrents of blood have been spilt in the world in vain at­  
empts of the secular  
&#x27;une, at length, has revealed the true remedy. Every relaxa­  
ioa of narrow and rigorous policy, wherever it has been tried,  
as been found to assuage the disease. The American Ihea­  
re lias exhibited proofs, that equal nnd complete liberty , if  
does not wholly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys its malig­  
anr influence on the health and prosperity of the Slate. If,  
nth the salutary effects of this system under our  
tc begin to contract the bounds of religious freedom, we  
now no name that will too severely reproach our folly.  
Attempts to enforce by legal sanctions, acts obnoxious to a  
real proportion of citizens, lend to enervate the laws in gen­  
ral, and to slacken the bands of society. If it be difficult  
a execute any law which is not generally deemed necessary

the United States, in 1785.  
  
To the Honorable the General Assembly of the  
Commonwealth of Virginia,  
  
WE the subscribers, citizens.of the Com-  
monwealth, having taken into consideration a  
bill printed by order of the last session of Gen-  
eral Assembly, entitled, “‘ A bill fer establish-  
ing a provision for teachers of the ChristianRe-  
ligion ;”’ and conceiving, that the same, if final-  
ly armed with the sanction of a law will be a  
dangerous abuse of power ; are bound, as faith-  
ful members of a free State to remonstrate a-  
gainst it, and to declare the reasons by which  
they are determined. We remonstrate against  
the said bill,  
  
Because we hold it for a fundamental and  
unslienable truth, “ that religion, or the duty  
which we owe to the Creator, and the manner  
of discharging it, can be directed only by rea-  
son and conviction, not by force or violence.”  
The religion, then, of every man, must be left  
to the conviction and conscience of every map;  
and it is the right of every man to exercise it  
as these may dictate. This right is, in its na-  
ture, an unalienable right. It is unalienable,  
because the opinions of men depending on the  
evidence contemplated by their own. minds,  
cannot follow the dictates of other men. It is  
unalienable also, because what is here a right  
towards man, it is a duty towards the Creator.  
It is the duty of every man to render to the  
Creator such homage, and such only, as he be-  
lieves to be acceptable to him. This duty is  
precedent both in order and time, and in de-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
62  
gree of obligation to the claims of civil society.  
Before any man can be considered as a mem-  
ber of civil society, he must be considered as  
a subject of the Governor of the Universe. And  
if a member of civil society, who enters into  
any subordinate association, must always do it  
with a reservation of his duty to general autho-  
rity ; much more must every the man, whobe-  
comes a member of any particular civil society,  
do it wita a saving of his allegiance to the Uni-  
versal Sovereign. We maintain, therefore, that  
in matters of religion, no man’s rightis abridged  
by the institution of civil society ; and that reli-  
gion is wholly exempt from its cognizance.—  
True itis, that no other rule exists, by which  
any question, which may divide society can be  
ultimately determined, but by the will of a ma-  
jority ; but it isalso true, that the majority may  
trespass on the rights of the minority.  
  
Because if religion be exempt from the au-  
thority of the Society at large, still less can it be  
subject to that of the legislative body. The  
latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of  
the former. Their jurisdiction is both deriva-  
tive and limited. It is limited with regard to  
the co-ordinate departments ; more necessarily,  
it is limited with regard to the constituents.  
The preservation of a free government requires,  
not merely that the metes and bounds which  
separate each department of power, be invari-  
ably maintained ; but more especially, that nei-  
ther of them be suffered to overleap the great  
barrier which defends the rights of the people.  
The rulers, who are guilty of such an encroach-  
ment, exceed the commission from which they  
derive their authority, and are tyrants. The  
people who submit to it, are governed by laws  
made neither by themselves, nor any authority  
derived from them, and are slaves.  
  
Because it is proper to take alarm at the first  
experiment on our liberties. We hold this  
prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens  
and one of the noblest characteristics of the late  
revolution. The freemen of America did not  
wait until usurped power had strengthened itself  
by exercise, and entangled the question in pre-  
cedents, They saw all the consequences in  
the principle, and they avoided the consequen-  
ces by denying the principle. We revere this  
lesson too much, soon to forget it. Who does  
not see that the same authority, which can es-  
tablish Christianity in exclusion of all other  
sects ; that the same authority, which can force  
a citizen to contribute three pence only of his  
property, for the support of any one establish-  
ment, may force him to conform to any other  
establishment, in all cases whatsoever.  
  
Because the bill violates that equality which  
ought to be the basis of every law ; and which  
is more indispensable, in proportion as the va-  
  
  
  
lidity or expediency of .any law is more liable |  
  
tobe impeached. “ If all men are, by nature,  
equally free and independent,” all men are to  
be considered as entering into society on equal

conditions, as relinquishing no more, and there-  
fore, retaining no less, one than another, of their  
natural rights ; above all, are they to be con-  
sidered as retaining an “ equal title to the free  
exercise of religion according to the dictates of  
conscience.” Whilst we assert for ourselves  
a freedom to embrace, to profess, and observe  
the religion which we believe to be of divine  
origin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to  
those, whose minds have not yet yielded to the  
evidence which has convinced us. If this free-  
dom be abused, it is an offence against God,  
not against man. To God, therefore, and not  
to man, must an account of it be rendered.  
  
As the bill violates equality, by subjecting  
some to peculiar burdens ; so it violates the  
same principle, by granting to others peculiar  
exemptions. Are the Quakers and Menonists  
the only sects who think a compulsive support  
of their religions unnecessary and unwarranta-  
ble ? Can their piety alone be entrusted with  
the care of publick worship? Ought their re-  
ligions to be endowed, above all others, with  
extraordinary privileges, by which proselytes  
may be enticed from all others ? We think too  
favourably of the justice and good sense of these  
denominations, to believe that they either covet  
pre-eminences over their fellow-citizens, or  
that they will be seduced by them from the  
common opposition to the measure.  
  
Because the bill implies, either thatthe civil  
magistrate is a competent judge of religious  
truths, or that he may employ religion as an  
engine of civil policy. The fifst is an arrogant  
pretension, falsified by the extraordiuary opin-  
ions of rulers, in all ages, and throughout the  
world ; the second, a unhallowed perversion  
of the means of salvation.  
  
Because the establishment proposed by the  
bill, is not requisite for the support of the Chris-  
tian religion. To say tliat it is, is a contradic-  
tion to the Christian religion itself; for every  
page of it disavows a dependence on the power  
of this world ; it is a contradiction to fact, for it  
is known that this religion both existed and  
flourished, not only without the support ef hu-  
man laws, but in spite of every opposition from  
them ; and not only during the period of mira-  
culous aid, but long after it had been left to its  
own evidence and the ordinary care of Provi-  
dence : nay, it is a contradiction in terms ; for  
a religion not invented by human policy, must  
have pre-existed and been supported, before  
it was established by human policy: it is,  
moreover, to weaken in those, who profess this  
religion, a pious confidence in its innate excel-  
lence, and the patronage of its Author; and to  
foster in those, who still reject it, a suspicion  
| that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies,  
| to trust to its own merits. /  
  
Because experience witnesses that ecclesi-  
astical establishments, instead of maintaining  
the purity and efficacy of religion, have had a  
contrary operation, During almost fifi ~~ cen-

Because a measure of singular magnitude Its doctrines should be the first the infant should learn  
  
and delicacy, ought not to be imposed without  
the clearest evidence that it is called for by a  
majority of citizens ; and no satisfactory method  
is yet proposed, by which the voice of the ma- |  
jority in this case may be determined, or its in- |  
filwence secured. “The people of the respec-  
tive counties are, indeed, requested to signify  
their opinion, respecting the adoption of the  
bill, to the next session of Assembly.” But |  
the representation must be made equa!, before |  
the voice, either of the representatives: or of |  
the counties, will be that of the people. Our  
hope is, that neither of the former will, after |  
due consideration, espouse the dangerous prin-.|  
ciple of the bill. Should the event disappoint |  
‘us, it will still leave us in full confidence, that |  
a fair appeal to the latter will reverse the sen-  
tence against our liberties.  
  
Because finally, “‘the equal right of every  
citizen to the free exercise of his religion ac-  
cording to the dictates of his conscience,” is  
held by the same tenure with all our rights.  
If we recur to its origin, it is equally the gift of  
nature ; if we weigh its importance, it cannot  
be less dear to us; if we consult the “ Decla-  
ration of those rights which pertain to the good  
people of Virginia, as the basis and foundation |  
of government,” it is enumerated with equal |  
solemnity, or rather with studied emphasis.—  
Either then we must say that the will of the  
Legislature is the only measure of their autho-  
rity ; and that in the plenitude of this authority  
they may sweep away all our fundamental  
rights: or, that they are bound to leave this  
particular right untouched and sacred: either  
we must say, that they may control the free-  
dom of the press ; may abolish the trial by jury,  
may swallow up the executive and judiciary  
powers of the State ; nay, that they may anni-  
hilate our very right of suffrage, and erect  
themselves into an independent and hereditary  
assembly ; or we must say that they have no  
authority to enact into a law, a bill under con-  
sideration. We the subscribers say, that the  
General Assembly of this commonwealth have  
no such authority ; and that no effort may be  
omitted on our part, against so dangerous an  
usurpation, we oppose to it this Remonstrance,  
earnestly praying, as we are in duty bound,  
that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe,  
by illuminating those to whom it is addressed,  
may, on the one hand, turn their councils from  
every act, which would affront his holy pre-  
rogative, or violate the trust committed to them,  
and, on the other, guide them into every mea-  
sure which may be worthy of his blessing,  
may redound to their own praise, and may es-  
tablish more firmly the liberties, the property

charging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force  
  
or violance.” The religion, then, of every man, must be left to the  
conviction and conscience of every man ; and it is the right of every man  
to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature, an un-  
alienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men depend-  
ing on the evidence contemplated by their own minds, cannot follow the  
dictates of other men. It is unalienable also, because what is here a right  
towards men, it is a duty towards the creator. It is the duty of every  
man to render to the creator such homage, and such only, as he believes  
to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent both in order and time,  
and in degree of obligation to the claims of civil society. Before any  
man can be considered as a member of civil society, he must be consi-  
dered as a subject of the governor of the universe. And if a member of  
civil society, who enters into any subordinate association, must always  
do it with a reservation of his duty to general authority; much more  
must every man, who becomes a member of any particular civil society,  
do it with a saving of his allegiance to the universal sovereign. We  
maintain, therefore, that in matters of religion, no man’s right is abridged  
by the institution of civil society ; and that religion is wholly exempt  
from its cognizance. ‘True it is, that no other rule exists, by which any  
question, which may divide society can be ultimately determined, but by  
the will of a majority ; but it is also true, that the majority may trespass  
on the rights of the minority.  
  
Because if religion be exempt from the authority of the. society at  
large, still less can it be subject to that of the legislative body. The lat-  
ter are but the createres and vicegerents of the former. Their jurisdic-  
tion is both derivative and limited. It is limited with regard to co-or-  
dinate departments; more necessarily, it is limited with regard to the con-  
stituents. The preservation of a free government requires, not merely  
that the metes and bounds which separate each department of power, be  
invariably maintained ; but more especially, that neither of them be suf-  
fered to overleap the great barrier which defends the rights of the people.  
The rulers, who are guilty of such an encroachment, exceed the commis-  
sion from which they derive their authority, and are tyrants. The peo-  
ple who submit to it, are governed by laws made neither by themselves,  
nor any authority derived from them, and are slaves.  
  
Because it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liber-  
‘ties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens and  
one of the noblest characteristics of the late revolution. ‘The freemen of  
America did not wait until usurped power had strengthened itself by ex-  
ercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the con-  
sequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by deny-  
ing the principle. We revere this lesson too much, soon to forget it.  
Who does not see that the same authority, which can establish Chtistian-  
ity in exclusion of all other sects; that the same authority, which can  
force a citizen to contribute three pence «nly of his property, for the sup-  
port of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other  
establishment, in all cases whatsoever.  
  
Because the bill violates that equality which ought to be the basis of  
every law ; and which is more indispensible, in proportion as the validity

or expediency of any law is more liable to be impeached. ‘If all men  
are, by nature, equally free and independent,” all men are to be consider-  
ed as entering into society on equal conditions, as relinquishing no more,  
and therefore, retaining no less, one than another, of their natural rights ;  
above all, are they to be considered as retaining an “ equal title to the  
free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience.” Whilst  
we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess, and observe  
the religion which we believe to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an  
equal freedom to those, whose minds have not yet yielded to the evidence  
which has convinced us. If this freedom be abused, it is an offence  
against God, not against man. To God, therefore, and not to man,  
must an account of it be rendered.  
  
As the bill violates equally, by subjecting some to perculiar burdens ;  
so it violates the same principle, by granting to others peeuliar exemp-  
tions. Are the quakers and menonists the only sects who think a com-  
pulsive support of their religions unnecessary and unwarrantable? Can  
their piety alone be entrusted with the care of public worship! Ought  
their religions to be endowed, above all others, with extraordinary pri-  
vileges, by which proselytes may be enticed from all others! We think  
too favorably of the justice and good sense of these denominations, to  
believe that they either covet pre-eminences over their fellow-citizens, or  
that they will be seduced by them from the common opposition to the  
measure.  
  
Because the bill implies, either that the civil magistrate is a competent  
judge of religious truths, or that he may employ religion as an engine of  
civil policy. ihe first is an arrogant pretension, falsified by the extra-  
ordinary opinions of rulers, in all ages, and throughout the world ; the  
second, an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation.  
  
Because the establishment proposed by the bill, is not requisite for the  
support of the Christian religion. To say that it is, is a contradiction to  
the Christian religion itself; for every page of it disavows a dependence  
on the power of this world ; it is » contradiction to fact, for it is known  
that this religion both existed and flourished, not only without the support  
of human laws, but in spite of every opposition from them ; and not only  
during the period of miraculous.aid, but | ng after it had been left to its  
own evidence and the ordinary care of providence: nay, it Is a contra-  
diction in terms; forareligion not invented by human policy, must have  
pre-existed and been supported, before it was established by human po-  
licy : it is moreover, to weaken in those, who profess this religion, a pious  
confidence in its innate excellence, andthe patronage of its author; and  
to foster in those, who still reject it, a suspicion that its friends are too  
conscious of its fallacies, to trust to its own merits.  
  
Because experience witnesses that ecclesiastical establishments, instead  
of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion, have had a contrary  
operation. During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment  
of Christianity been on trial. What have been its fruits? More or less  
in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility  
in the laity ; in both superstition, bigotry, and persecution. Inquire of  
the teachers of Christianity for the ages in which it appeared in its  
greatest lustre : those of every sect point to the ages prior to its incorpo-

ration with civil policy. Propose a restoration of this primitive state, im  
which its teachers depended on the voluntary rewards of their flocks, many  
of them predict its downfall. Ou which side ought their testimony to  
have the greatest weight, when for, or when agaist their interest ?  
  
Because the establisument in question is not necessary for the support  
of civil government. [fit be urged as necessary for the suppert of civil  
government, ouly as it is a means of supporting religion, and if it be not  
necessary for the latter purpose, it cannot be necessary for the former.  
  
If religion be not within the cognizance of civil government, how can  
its legal establishment be said to be necessary to civil goverument ? What  
influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had ou civil society ?  
In some instances, they ave been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on  
the ruins of civil authority ; 3; In more instances, they have been seen up-  
holding the thrones of political tyranny ; in no instance, have they been  
guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert  
the public liberty, may have found an established clergy convenient  
auxiliaries. A just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it,  
needs them not. Such a government will be best supported by protect-  
ing every citizen in the enjoyment of religion, with the same equal hand  
which protects his person and property ; by neither invading the equal  
rights of any sect nor suffering any sect to invade those of another.  
  
Because the propose -d establishment is a de ‘parture froin that generous  
policy, which offering an asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of eve-  
ry nation and religion, promised a lustre to our country, and an accession  
to the number of our citizens ?; What a melancholy mark is the bill of  
sudden degeneracy? Instead of holding forth an asylum to the perse-  
cuted, it is itself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equal  
rank of citizens all those whose opinions in religion do not bend to  
those of legislative authority. Distant as it may be, in its present form,  
from the inquisition, it differs only from it in degree ; the one is the first  
step the other the last, in the eareer of intolerance. The magnanimous  
sufferer under the cruel scourge in foreign nations, must view the bill as  
a beacon on our coast, warning him to seek some other haven, where  
liberty and philanthrophy in their due extent may offer a more certain  
repose for his trouble.  
  
Because it will have a like tendency to banish our citizens. The al-  
lurements presented by other situations, are every day thinning their num-  
ber. ‘To superadd a fresh motive to emigration, by revoking the libe arty  
which they now enjoy, would be the same species of folly, which has  
dishonored and depopulated flourishing kingdoms.  
  
Because it will destroy that moderation and harmony, which the for-  
bearance of our laws to intermeddle with religion has produced among  
its severalsects. Torrents of blood have been spilt in the old world, by  
vain attempts of the secular arm to extinguish religious discord, proscri-  
bing all differences in religious opinion. ‘Time has at length revealed  
the true remedy. Every “relaxation of narrow and rigorous policy,  
wherever it has been tried, has been found to assuage the disease. The  
American theatre has exhibited proofs, that equal and complete liberty,  
if it does not wholly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys its malignant in-  
fluence on the health and prosperity of the state. If, with the salutary

our folly. At least let warning be taken at the first fruits of the threaten-  
ed innovation. The very appearance of the bill has transformed that  
“Christian forbearance, love, and charity,” which of late mutually  
prevailed, into animosities and jealousies, which may not soon be appeas-  
ed. What mischiefs may not be dreaded, should this enemy to the pub-  
lic quiet be armed with the force of law!  
  
Because the policy of this bill is adverse to the diffusion of the light  
of Christianity. The first wish of those, who ought to enjoy this precious  
gift, ought to be that it may be imparted to the whole race of mankind.  
Compare the number of those, who have as yet received it, with the num-  
ber still remaining under the dominion of false religions, and how small  
is the former? Does the policy of the bill tend to lessen the disapproba-  
tion? No; it at once discourages taose who are strangers to the light of  
truth, from coming into regions of it; and countenances by example,  
the nations who continue in darkness, in shutting out those who might  
convey itto them. Instead of levelling, as far as possible every obstacle  
to the victorious progress of truth, the bill, with an ignoble and unchris-  
tian timidity, would circumseribe it with a wall of defence against the  
encroachmeuts of error.  
  
Because an attempt to enforce by legal sanctions, acts obnoxious to  
so great a portion of citizens, tends to enervate the laws in general, and  
to slacken the bands of society. If it be difficult toexecute any law, which  
isnot generally deemed necessary nor salutary, what must be the case  
when it is deemed invalid and da gerous? And what may be the effect  
of so striking an example of impotency in the government on its general  
authority.  
  
Because a measure of singular m»gnitude and delicacy, ought not to  
be imposed without the clearest evidence that it is called for by a major-  
ity of citizens; and no satisfactory method is yet proposed, by which the  
majority in this case may be determined, or its influence secured. The  
people of the respective counties are, indeed, requested to signify their  
opinion, respecting the adoption of the bill, to the next session of As-  
sembly.’’ But the representation must be made equal, before the voice,  
either of the representatives or of the counties, wil be that of the people.  
Our hope is, that neither of the former will, after due consideration, es-  
pouse the dangerous principle of the bill. Should the event disappoint  
us, it will leave us in full confidence, that a fair appeal to the latter will  
reverse our sentence against our liberties.  
  
Because finally, the “ equal right of every citizen to the free exercise  
of his religion according to the dictates of his conscience,” is held by the  
same tenure with all our rights. If we recur to its origin, it is equally  
the gift of nature ; if we weigh its importance, it cannot be less dear to  
us; if we consult the ‘declaration of those rights which pertain to the  
good people of Virginia, as the basis and foundat en of government,” it  
is enumerated with equal solemnity, or rather with studied emphasis.—  
Either then we must say that the will of the legislature is the only mea-  
sure of their authority ; and that in the plenitude of this authority they  
may sweep away all our fundamental rights: or, that they are bound to

| must be left to the conviction and conscience of every  
| man; and it is the right of every nian to exercise it,  
| as these may dictate. This right is, in its nature, an  
junalienable right. It is unalienable; b  
opinions of men depending only on the evidence con-  
templated by their own minds, cannot follow the dic-  
tates of other men. It is unalienable, also, because  
what is here a right towards man, is a duty towards  
the Creator. Itis the duty of every man to render to  
the Creator such homage, and such only, as he  
| believes to be acceptable to him. ‘This duty is prece-  
dent, both in order of time, and in degree of obliga-  
tion, to the claims of civil society. Before any man  
can be considered as a member of civil society, he must  
be considered as a subject of the Governor of the uni-  
verse. And if a member of civil society, who enters  
into any subordiate association, must always do it  
with a reservation of his duty to the general authori-  
ty; much more must every man who becomes a mem-  
ber of any particular civil society, do it with a saving  
of his allegiance to the universal Sovereign. We  
maintain, therefore, that, in matters of religion, no  
man’s right is abridged by the institution of civil soci-  
ety ; and that religion is wholly exempt from its cog-  
nizance. True it is, that no other rule exists, by  
which any question which may divide a society can  
be ultimately determined, but by the will of the ma-  
jority. But it is also true, that the majority may tres-  
pass on the rights of the minority.

Because the establishment proposed by the bill is  
not requisite for the support of the Christian religion.  
To say that it is, is a contradiction to the Christian re-  
ligion itself; for every page of it disavows a depend-  
ence on the power of this world; it is a contradiction  
to fact, for it is known that this religion both existed  
and flourished, not only without the support of human  
  
j laws, but in spite of every opposition from them ; and  
  
not only during the period of miraculous aid, but  
long after it had been left to its own evidence and the  
ordinary care of Providence: nay, it ig a contradic-  
tion in terms ; fora religion not invented by human po-  
licy, must have pre-existed and been supported, before  
it was established by human policy ; it is moreover to  
weaken in those who profess this religion, a pious con-  
fidence in its invate excellence and the patronage of  
its Author; and to foster in those who still reject it, a  
suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its falla-  
cies, to trust it to its own merits.  
  
Because experience witnesses that esclesiastical es-  
tablishinents, instead of maintaining the purity and  
etlicacy of religion, have had a contrary operation.—  
During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establish-  
ment of Christianity been on trial. What have been  
  
its fruits? inore or less,in all places, pride and indo-  
}  
  
lence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the  
laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution.  
Inquire of the teachers of Christianity for the ages  
in whieh it appeared in its greatest lustre? ‘Those of  
  
jevery seet point to the ages prior to its incorporation  
  
with civil policy. Propose a restoration of this primi-  
live state, in which its tethers depended on the vol-  
untary rewards of theit flocks ; many of them predict  
its downfall. On which side ought their testimony to

Because the policy of the bill is adverse to the dif-  
fusion of the light of Christianity. The first wish of  
those who ought to enjoy this precious gift ought to  
be, that it may be imparted to the whole race of man-  
kind. Compare the number of those, who have as  
yet received it, with the number still remaining under  
the dominion of false religions, and how small is the  
former! Does the policy of the bill tend to lessen  
the disproportion? No; it atonce discourages those,  
who are strangers to the light of truth, from coming  
into the regions of it; and countenances, by example,  
the nations who continue in darkness, in shutting out  
those who might convey it to them. Instead of level-  
ling as far as possible every obstacle to the victorious  
progress of truth, the bill, with an ignoble and un-  
christian timidity, would cireumseribe it with a wall  
of defence against the encroachments of error.  
  
Because attempts to enforce by legal sanctions,  
acts, obuoxious to so great a proportion of citizens,  
tend to enervate the laws in general, and to slacken  
the bands of society.  
  
If it be difficult to execute any  
law, which is not g  
  
generally deemed necessary or salu-  
tary, What must be the case where it is deemed inva-  
And what may be the effect of  
so striking an example of impotency in the govern-  
  
lment on its general authority ?

_ Which embodies the spirit of the whole document. ‘  
  
Quoting from the Bill of Rights of Virginia, as a fundamental and  
unalienable truth, “that religion, or the duty which we owe to the Creator,  
“and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and  
“conviction, not by force or violence,” it argues that it must be left to the  
conviction and conscience of every man, and it is the right of every man  
to exercise it as these shall dictate; that this right is inalienable; that it  
is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage, and such  
only, as he believes to be acceptable to Him; that every man, on entering  
society, reserves his allegiance to the Governor of the Universe; and, con-  
sequently, no man’s right can be abridged by the institution of civil  
society, and that religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance; hence it  
argues that if religion be exempt from the interference or authority of  
society at large, a fortiori it must be from that of the legislative body;  
that the rulers who are guilty of such an encroachment exceed the com-  
mission from which they derive their authority and are tyrants; that the  
people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves  
nor by an authority derived from them, and are slaves; that prudent |  
jealousy in taking alarm at the first experiment on their liberties is held  
to be the first duty of citizens. The*Memorial contains the following —  
remarkable sentence: “ Who do not see that the same authority which can  
“establish Christianity in exclusion of all other religions, may establish with  
“the same ease, any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other  
sects ?

ferred to another. We maintain, there  
fore, that in matters of religion, no  
man&#x27;s right is abridged by the institu  
tion of civil society, and that religion  
is wholly exempt from its cognizance.  
&quot;2. If religion be exempt from the  
authority of society at large.much more  
is it exempt irom the authority of the  
government. , The latter is but the  
creature and vicegerent of the former.  
Its jurisdiction is both derivative and  
limited, it is limited with regard to  
the co-ordinate departments of the gov  
ernment, and more necessarily is it lim­  
ited with regard to the whole people.  
The preservation . of free government  
requires not merely that the metes and  
bounds which separate each department  
of the governmental power be invaria­  
bly maintained, but more especially  
that neither of them be suffered to  
overleap the great barrier which de­  
fends the rights of the people. The  
rulers who are guilty of such encroach­  
ment exceed : the commission from  
which they derive their authority, and  
are tyrants, The people who submit  
to it are governed by laws made neith­  
er by themselves&quot; nor by any authority  
derived from thein, and are slaves.  
. &quot;3. It is proper to take alarm at the  
first . experiment, upon our liberties.  
We hold this prudent jealousy to be the  
first duty of citizens and the noblest  
characteristic of the American Revolu­  
tion.&#x27; The freemen of America did hot  
wait till usurped power had strength­  
ened itself by exercise and entangled  
the question in precedents. .... They saw  
all the consequences in the principle,  
and avoided the consequences by deny­  
ing the principle. We revere this les­  
son too much soon to forget it, . Who  
docs not see that the same authority  
that can establish Christianity, to the  
exclusion of all other religions, may  
establish with the same ease any partic­

the power to keep the peace. The soph­  
istry of the maxim that one man&#x27;s rights  
end where another&#x27;s begins was thor­  
oughly exposed and the true theory pre­  
sented, that every man&#x27;s rights begin  
and end at the same place, and all come  
from God, the maker of all. Govern­  
ment can grant no rights, for it has none  
to grant, and to assume that prerogative  
is to transcend its authority.  
  
With reference to the question of the  
limits of obedience to civil law Madison  
was quoted as saying, &quot;Before any man

ciety, he must be considered as a sub­

ever, a vigorous attempt was made to pass  
in the General Assembly &#x27;a bill establish­  
ing a provision for teachers of the Chris­  
tian religion.&#x27; it provided for a general  
assessment on all taxable property for the  
purpose named, each person,as he paid the  
tax, to say to which particular denomina­  
tion he desired it conveyed. The bill w^s  
successfully carried to the third reading  
and then checked Dy a motion of Madison  
to postpone to the next General Assem­  
bly. Madison immediately issued the fol­  
lowing letter, which finally caused me de­  
feat of the measure:  
Because we hold it for a fundamental and  
undeniable truth that religion, or the duty  
which we owe to our Creator, and the manner  
ot discharging it can be directed only by  
reason and conviction, not by force or vio­  
ience—the religion, then, of every man must  
be left to tne conviction and conscience of  
every roan; and it is the right of every man  
to exercise it us these may dictate. This richt  
is, in its nature, an inalienable; right. It is  
inalienable, because the opinions of men, de­  
pending only on tbe evidence contemplated  
in their own minds, cannot follow the. dic­  
tates of other men. It is inalienable, also, be-  
Ckuse what Is here a right toward men is a  
duty toward the Creator. It is the duty of  
every man to render to the Creator .such hom­  
age, and such only, as he believes to be ac­  
ceptable to him. . .  
This duty is precedent, both in order of time  
and in degree of obligation, to the claims of  
civil society. Beiore any man can be consid­  
ered as a member of civil society, he must be  
considered as a subject of the Governor of the  
universe; and if a member of civil society,  
who enters into any subordinate association,  
must always do with a reservation of his  
duty to the general authority, much more  
must every man who becomes a member of  
any particular civil society do it with a saving  
of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign.  
We maintain, therefore, that in matters of re­  
ligion no man&#x27;s right is abridged by the insti­  
tution of civil society, and that religion is  
wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is,  
that no other rule exists by which any question  
■which may divide a society can be ultimately  
determined than the will of the majority; but  
it is also true that the majority may trespass  
upon the rights of the minority.  
Because, if religion Is exempt from the  
authority of society at large, still less can  
it be subject to that of the legislative body.  
The latter is but the creature and vicegerent  
of the former. Its jurisdiction is both deriva­  
tive and limited. It is limited with regard to  
the co-ordinate departments; more necessarily  
is it limited with regard to the constituents.  
The preservation of a free government requires  
not merely that the metes and bounds which  
teparate each department of power be invari­  
ably maintained, but more especially that  
neither of them De sufferci to overleap the  
great barrier which defends the rights of the  
j.eople. The rulers who are guilty of such an  
encroachment exceed the commission from  
which they derive their authority, and are  
tyrants. The people who submit to it are gov­  
erned by laws made neither by themselves nor  
by any authority derived from them, and are  
slaves. &quot; • • • ,  
Because experience wltnesseth that eccle­  
siastical establishments, instead of maintain­  
ing the purity and efficacy of religion, have  
had a contrary operation. During almost  
fifteen centuries has the legal establishment  
of Christianity been on trial. What have been  
its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride  
and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and  
servility in the laity; in both, superstition,  
bigotry and persecution. Inquire oi the teach­  
era of Christianity for the ages in which it ap­  
peared in Its greatest luster; those of every  
beet point to the ages prior to its incorpora­  
tion with civil polity. Propose a restoration  
&#x27; of this primitive state, in which its teachers  
depend on the voluntary regard of their flocks,  
many of them predict its downfall. On  
which side ought their testimony to have  
greatest weight— for, or when against,  
their interest ?  
&quot;It is proper now to see if there is an
