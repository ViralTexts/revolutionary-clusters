Department of State, Washington, August 1st, 1801.  
It is a considerable time since our Consuls originated the practice of providing with certificates foreign vessels purchased abroad by citizens of the United States; and it is even understood that some such vessels have been supplied with Consular Registers and Sea-letters. To secure the bona fide property of our citizens is an important duty of the Government, but to repress or regulate a course of proceedings, the tendency of which is to blend it in appearance with foreign property, by rendering the evidence of its legitimacy suspicious or uncertain, ought equally to demand its attention.  
Accordingly, you will, in no case whatever, issue to any such vessel, either a Register or Sea-letter, or any document of a similar nature, except the one hereinafter prescribed.  
If, as is mostly the case, the vessel for which you are requested to issue papers, be a prize vessel, you will require the exhibition of the condemnation and bill of sale, as well as proof that the purchaser is a citizen of the United States. If the ship, whether a prize vessel or not, is alleged to be purchased on account of an absent citizen, you will require the authorization of the agent making the purchase to be produced. In addition to these documents the purchaser should in every case make an affidavit, “that he is the bona fide proprietor of the vessel; that no other person has any part or interest in her, and that he does not hold her, or any part of her, in trust for any other person:” And if purchased for an absent citizen, the agent should make the same affidavit mutatis mutandis, adding to it the qualification, “to the best of his belief.” These requisites being completed, it may be concluded that the vessel is really American, unless their authenticity is diminished by other peculiar circumstances, which may come to your knowledge. They are conditions which in a genuine transaction are easily performed, and they are absolutely necessary to form the basis of your official act in granting the certificate hereafter mentioned. It is moreover unsafe for a vessel to put to sea without them in time of war.  
If in any case the adroitness of individuals should impose upon you, notwithstanding the above precautions, there is one security left, which will probably defeat the fraud. The certificate must be limited to the vessel’s return to the United States, and her destination to some port therein must be specified in it. No certificate is to be granted to a vessel having once been in the United States, since the purchase, unless it be sufficiently made to appear that her Sea-letter, there obtained, has been lost by accident.  
The form of the certificate may be as follows:  
  
A. B. Consul of the United States of America:  
To all to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting:  
It appearing from the documents hereto annexed, (annexing the condemnation, if the case be such, bill of sale, authorization of the owner, if the case be such, copy of the proof of citizenship and the owners or agents affidavit and repeating their titles) that C. D. a citizen of the said States is the sole proprietor of the ship (naming and describing her) now lying in the port of  whereof E. F. another citizen of the said States is master, being bound to the port of  within the said States, I have granted permission, that the said ship may depart and proceed on her voyage to the port aforesaid. This permission to continue in force only during the said voyage.  
Given under my Hand, and Consular Seal at, etc.  
In many of the ports of Europe our vessels have been subjected to a ruinous and oppressive quarantine. It has generally been imposed without much attention to the state of health in the port of the vessel’s departure in the United States. Thus whilst the port of Charleston, (S. C.) may be unhealthy, a vessel arriving from Boston, where good health may prevail, is subjected to an indiscriminating quarantine. In the winter months, also, it is considered impossible, that a vessel can carry from this country any dangerously infectious disorder; the epidemics which have, within these eight years past, been so fatal in some of our sea-ports, breaking out about midsummer, and totally disappearing with the setting in of the frost in November.  
We are encouraged to expect, that by sending with our vessels authentic certificates of health, granted by the most respectable municipal officers of our ports, under a vigilant precaution, and with a scrupulous regard to truth, we shall experience a relaxation of this burthensome imposition. Accordingly, the Secretary of the Treasury has given directions to the Collectors of the Customs to carry this plan into effect. Certificates of health will therefore be occasionally sent to the Consuls in Europe, who, after communicating them to the officer or board in the place of their residence, charged with the superintendance of health, will transmit copies, or, if needful, the original, to the American Minister, if any such is established in the country.  
Enclosed are copies of the circular letter addressed to the Collectors of the Customs on this occasion by the Secretary of the Treasury, and of the form of a certificate of health. It is proper for me here to mention to you, that there are but thirteen ports, viz. Portsmouth, (N. H.) Newbury-port, Salem, Boston, New-Port, Providence, New-York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington, (N. C.) Charleston, (S. C.) and Savannah, in which Naval officers are established by law, and that in all other ports the bill of health can only be certified by the Collector; a circumstance with which perhaps foreign agents, to whom the circular may be communicated, should be acquainted, in order to prevent any injury abroad to vessels sailing from these ports, on account of the unavoidable omission of a Naval officer’s signature.  
Whilst we are led to expect a benefit from this arrangement, we think it will not be confined to ourselves. When real danger exists, other nations will be timely and candidly alarmed, and when there is none, they as well as we will be absolved from the disadvantages of a suspended intercourse.  
As it becomes us as well as others to guard against contagion, I have to request you, and more especially those who reside in the West-Indies, and on the Mediterranean, to report to this department, as often as it may be necessary, the most speedy information of the prevalence of epidemics in the ports of your districts. As soon as they have subsided, you will give intimation of it.  
In the consular instructions, you are requested to make semi-annual returns of the American trade at your ports. This is of great importance, as it keeps us exactly informed of the channels in which our commerce flows; and you will pay the most pointed attention to the regular transmission of them. To make you acquainted with the nature of the cargo, and the ports of departure or destination, has been considered as hazarding the benefit expected from the sale of the cargo, and therefore refused in some instances by the masters and supercargoes of our vessels. As no law requires them to give the information, you are not to demand it as a right, and you will supply the defect happening from a refusal, by some other means, when it is practicable.  
After the receipt of this letter, you will consider yourselves no longer authorized to expend monies on account of the public, without the special direction of a Minister of the United States; except it be for the relief of seamen, in doing which you are to use economy and discernment, in distinguishing our own from foreign seamen, the profligate and idle, from the meritorious in distress, and in every case where you can, instead of paying their passages, you will find them births, where they may work for them.  
We have reason to believe, that it too often happens that seamen engaged in the United States are discharged by masters of vessels in foreign countries, where they can procure new crews at lower wages. By these means, besides the inducement the seamen have to engage in foreign service, or even in privateering, they frequently fall a burden on the Consuls. This evil cannot be completely cured without a legislative remedy, but you will take pains to rectify it, whenever the usages of the place may admit of it, and give this department advice of its extent, so that, should the matter be laid before Congress, it may be properly explained, and its existence verified.  
The Consuls in Great-Britain are as usual to settle their accounts for the relief of

the pufchafer fhould in every cafe make an

I &quot;In many of the ports of Europe onr  
j veflc ls have been fubjefled to a ruinous and  
uppreffive quarantine. It has generally  
been impofed without much attention to  
the ftate of health in the port of the vef­  
-1 lei&#x27;s departure in the United States. Thus  
whilft the port of Charlefton (S. C.) may  
&#x27; be unhealthy, a veflel arriving from Bol­  
ton, where good health may prevail, is hb­  
je«Jied to an indifcriminating quarantine.  
In the winter months, alTo, it is confidered  
impoflible that a veflel can carry from tl is  
country any dangtroufly infeftious difcr­

&quot; After the reccip&#x27;t of this letter, you  
will consider yourselves no longer autho­  
rised to expend monies on account of the  
public, without the special direction ofa  
minister as the United states, except it be  
she the relief of seamen ; in doing which  
you are to use economy and discernmc-nt,  
in distinguishing ourown from soreign sea­  
men—the t-roshgate and idle from the nsic­  
ritorious in dinress, and in every case  
where you can, instead os paying their  
passages, you will find th:m births, where.  
they may work for them. &#x27;  
&quot; We have reason to believe that it too  
often happens that scamzn engaged In the  
United States are dischnrgcd by mailere—of

procure new crcws at lowm&#x27; wages. By  
these means, besides, the induccment thc

- by the Department of State, to Consuls  
and other - Commercial Agents of the  
United States.  
“ It is a considerable time since our  
consuls - originated the pra&amp;ice of  
providing with certificates foreign  
veflels purchased abroad by the citi­  
zens of the United States ; and it is  
even understood that some such ves­  
sels have beent f{upplied with consular  
registers and sea-letters. To secure  
the bona fide property. of our citizens  
is an important duty of the gowern­  
ment ; but to repress or regulate a  
course of proceedings, the tendency of  
which is to blend it in an appearance  
with foreign property, by rendering  
the evidence of its legitimacy suspi­  
cious or uncertain, ought equally to  
demand its attention.  
“ Accordingly you will in no case  
whatever, issue to any such veflel eith­  
er a register or a fealetter, or any  
document of 2 similar nature, except  
the one hereafter prescribed. »  
¢ [f, as is mostly the case, the ves­  
sel for which you are requested to is­  
sue papers, be a prize vessel, you will  
require the exhibition of the condem­  
nation- and bill of sale, as well as  
proof that the purchaser is a citizen  
of the United States. If the ship,  
whether a prize vessel or not, is al­  
ledged to be purchased on account of  
an absent citizen, you will require the  
authorization of the agent making the  
purchase to be produced. In addi­  
tion to these documents the purcha­  
ser thould in every case make an af­  
fidavit, ¢ that he is the bona fide pro­  
prietor of the veflel ; that no other  
person has gny part or interest in her,  
and that hé¢ doesnot hold her, or any  
part of her, in trust for any other per­  
son :”” And if purchased for an absent  
‘citizen, the agent should maké tte  
fame affidavit mutatis mutandis, ad­  
ding to it the qualification, to the  
best of his belief. These :l;iquiﬁules bcé  
ing completed, it may be conclude  
‘&quot;zhit the weffel is really an American,  
unless their authenticity is diminithed  
by other peculiar &#x27; circumstances,  
which may come&#x27;to your knowledge.  
They are conditions which in a gen­  
uine tranfadtion are easily performed,  
and they are absolutely necessary to  
form &#x27; the basis of your official a&amp; in  
granting the cerificate bereafter men­  
tioned. It is moreover unfafe for 2  
veflel .to put to sea without them in  
- %If in&#x27;any case the adroitness of  
individdals. should -impose upon you  
notwithstanding the above precautions  
return to the United States,‘and her  
be fpecified in it. No certificate is to  
  
be granted to-a vessel having once  
been inthe United States, since the !  
purchase, unless it be fufficiently made |  
to appear, that her sea-letter there ob­  
tained has been loft by aceident.  
. The form of the certificate may  
be as follows - ~f  
A. B. Consul of the United States of  
America. - |  
To all whom thefz Presents Shall come,  
s ~ i ECCLIME 3. iy . - it  
It appearing from the documents  
hereto annexed, (annexing the con­  
demnation, if the case be such, bill of  
sale, authorization of the owner, if the  
case be such, copy of the proof of ci­  
tizenthip and the owners or agents  
afidavit and repeating their titles)  
that C. D. a citizen of the said Rates  
is the sole proprietor of the thip [(nam­  
ing and deferibing her] now lying in  
the port of whereof  
E. F. another citizen of the said states  
is master, being bound to the port of  
within the said states, I  
have graiited permission that the said  
ship may depart and proceed on her  
voyage to the port aforefaid. This  
permission to continue in force only  
during the f{aid voyage.  
&#x27; Given under my band and con­  
ki Jular seal, e,  
~ “In many of the ports of Europe  
our veflels have been fubje@ted to a  
ruinous and oppreflive quarantine —  
It has generally been imposed with­  
out much attention to the state of  
health in the port of the vessel’s de­  
parture in_ the United States. Thus  
whillt the port of Charleston, (S. C.)  
- may be unhealthy a vessel arrived  
from Boston, where good health may  
prevail,is fubje@ed to an undiscrim­  
inating quarantine. . In the winter  
months, also, it is considered impofh­  
ble that a vessel can carry from this  
country any dangerously infe&amp;ious  
| disorder; the epidemics which have,  
within, these eight years past been so  
fatal in some of our sea-ports, break­  
ing out about mid-summer, and total­  
ly disappearing with the setting in of  
the frolt in November.  
“ We are encouraged to exped,  
that by fending with our vessels au­  
thentic certificatés of health, granted  
by the most refpe&amp;able municipal  
officers of our ports, under a vigilant  
precaution, and with a scrupulous re­  
gard to truth, we shall experience a  
relaxation of this burthenfome impo­  
sition. Accordingly the secretary of  
the treasury has given diredions to  
the colle&amp;tors of the customs to carry  
this plan into effe@. Certificates of  
health will therefore be occasionally  
sent to the consuls in Europe, who  
after communicating them to the  
officer on board in the place of their  
residence, charged with the fuperin­  
tendance of health, will tran{mit co­  
pies; or; if needful, the original, to the  
Ametican minister, if any such is ef­  
tablifhed™in the country.  
“ Enclosed are copies of the circu­  
lar letter addrefled to the colle@ors  
of the customs on this occasion by the  
{ecretary of the treasury, and of the  
formof a certificate of health. It is  
proper for me here to mention to you,  
that there are but thirteen ports, viz.  
Portsmouth (N. H.) Newburypaort,  
Salem, Boston, Newport, Providence,  
New-York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,  
Norfolk, Wilmington, (N.C. ) Charles­  
ton, (8. C.) and Savannah, in which  
naval offices are eftablithed by law,  
and that in all other ports the bill of  
health cam only be certified by the  
collector ; circumstance with which  
perhaps foreign agents to whom the  
circular may be communicated,  
should be acquainted, in order to pre­  
vent any injury abroad to veflels fail­
