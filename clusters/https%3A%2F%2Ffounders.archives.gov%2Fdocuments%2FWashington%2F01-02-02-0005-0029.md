7. My Portmanteau Horse being unable to proceed, I left him at my Brothers &amp; got one of his &amp; proceedd. by Jolliffs &amp; Jasper Rinkers to Saml. Pritchards on Cacapehen; distant according to Acct. 39 Miles; but by my Computation 42 thus reckond 15 to Jolliffs, 14 to Rinkers; &amp; 13 to Pritchards. At Rinkers which appears to be a cleanly House my boy was taken Sick but continued on to Pritchards. Pritchards is also a pretty good House, their being fine Pasturage good fences, &amp; Beds tolerably clean.  
  
  
  
William Jolliffe, Sr. (1695–1765), a Quaker and a practicing attorney, moved with his family to the Shenandoah Valley about 1743 and settled in the vicinity of Opequon Creek, north of Winchester. His sons, William, James, Edmund, and John, all lived in Frederick County, in the area of Hopewell Meeting (jolliffeWilliam Jolliffe. Historical, Genealogical, and Biographical Account of the Jolliffe Family of Virginia, 1652 to 1893. Philadelphia, 1893., 66–79).  
  
  
  
  
  
8. My Servant being unable to Travel I left him at Pritchards with Doctr. Craik &amp; proceedd. myself with Vale. Crawford to Colo. Cresaps in ordr. to learn from him (being just arrivd from England) the particulars of the Grant said to be lately sold to Walpole &amp; others, for a certain Tract of Country on the Ohio. The distance from Pritchards to Cresaps according to Computation is 26 Miles,

9. Went up to Rumney in order to buy work Horses, &amp; meet Doctr. Craik and my Baggage. Arrivd there abt. 12 distance 16 Miles. In the Afternoon Doctr. Craik my Servt. (much amended) and the Baggage, arrivd from Pritchards; said to be 28 Miles.  
  
  
  
10. Having purchasd two Horses, and recoverd another which had been gone from me near 3 Years, I dispatchd my boy Giles with my two Riding Horses home, &amp; proceeded on my journey; arriving at one Wises (now Turners) Mill about 22 Miles it being Reckond Seven to the place where Cox’s Fort formerly stood; 10 to One Parkers; &amp; five afterwards. The Road from the South Branch to Pattersons C[ree]k is Hilly—down the C[ree]k on which is good Land, Sloppy to Parkers &amp; from Parkers to Turners Hilly again.  
  
  
  
11. The Morning being wet &amp; heavy we did not set of till 11 Oclock &amp; arrivd that Night at one Killams on a branch of Georges  
  
C[ree]k, distant 10½ Measurd Miles from the North Branch of Potomack where we cross at the lower end of my Decd. Brother Auge. Bottom, known by the name of Pendergrasses. This Crossing is two Miles from the aforesaid Mill &amp; the Road bad as it likewise is to Killams, the Country being very Hilly &amp; stony.  
From Killams to Fort Cumberland is the same distance that it is to the Crossing above mentiond, &amp; the Road from thence to Jolliffs by the old Town much better.  
  
  
  
Pendergrass’s Bottom was purchased by Lawrence Washington from Garret Pendergrass, probably when Pendergrass, an early settler and trader in the area, moved to Pennsylvania about 1752. In his will Lawrence left the land to his brother Augustine Washington (20 June 1752, DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
  
12. We left Killams early in the Morning—breakfasted at the little Meadows 10 Miles of, and lodgd at the great Crossings 20 Miles further, which we found a tolerable good days work.  
The Country we traveld over today was very Mountainous &amp; stony, with but very little good Land, &amp; that lying in Spots.  
  
  
  
13. Set out about Sunrise, breakfasted at the Great Meadows 13 Miles of, &amp; reachd Captn. Crawfords about 5 Oclock.

yet this does not appear to be of that cold kind. The Land from Gists to Crawfords is very broken tho not Mountainous—in Spots exceeding Rich, &amp; in general free from Stone. Crawfords is very fine Land; lying on Yaughyaughgane at a place commonly called Stewards Crossing.  
  
  
  
Laurel Hill was a western ridge of the Alleghenies.  
  
  
  
  
Thomas Gist was the son of Christopher Gist. He had accompanied his father to the frontier in the 1750s. After his father’s death in 1759, Thomas had taken over his plantation, which he called Monongahela, at the foot of Laurel Hill, in the vicinity of present-day Mount Braddock, Pa.  
  
  
  
  
  
Sunday 14th. At Captn. Crawfords all day. Went to see a Coal Mine not far from his house on the Banks of the River. The  
  
Coal seemd to be of the very best kind, burning freely &amp; abundance of it.  
  
  
  
Monday 15th. Went to view some Land which Captn. Crawford had taken up for me near the Yaughyaughgane distant about 12 Miles. This Tract which contains about 1600 Acres Includes some as fine Land as ever I saw—a great deal of Rich Meadow and in general, is leveller than the Country about it. This Tract is well Waterd, and has a valuable Mill Seat (except that the stream is rather too slight, and it is said not constant more than 7 or 8 Months in the Year; but on acct. of the Fall, &amp; other conveniences, no place can exceed it).  
In going to this Land I passd through two other Tracts which Captn. Crawford had taken up for my Brothers Saml. and John. That belonging to the former, was not so rich as some I had seen; but very valuable on acct. of its levelness and little Stone, the Soil &amp; Timber being good. That of the latter, had some Bottom Land up on sml. Runs that was very good (tho narrow) the Hills very rich, but the Land in genl. broken. I intended to have visited the Land which Crawford had procurd for Lund Washington this day also, but time falling short I was obligd to Postpone it making it in the Night before I got back to Crawfords where I found Colo. Stephen.  
The Lands which I passd over today were generally Hilly, and the growth chiefly white Oak, but very good notwithstanding; &amp; what is extraordinary, &amp; contrary to the property of all other Lands I ever saw before, the Hills are the richest Land, the soil upon the sides and Summits of them, being as black as a Coal, &amp; the Growth Walnut, Cherry, Spice Bushes &amp;ca. The flats are not so rich, &amp; a good deal more mixd with stone.  
  
  
  
This area in Fayette County, Pa., was later known as Washington Bottom. In 1774 GW built a mill there in partnership with Gilbert Simpson.  
  
  
  
  
  
Tuesday 16. At Captn. Crawfords till the Evening, when I went to Mr. John Stephenson (on my way to Pittsburg) &amp; lodgd. This day was visited by one Mr. Ennis who had traveld down the little Kanhawa (almost) from the head to the Mouth, on which he says the Lands are broken, the bottoms neither very wide nor rich, but covd. with Beach. At the Mouth the Lands are good, &amp; continue so up the River; &amp; about Weeling, &amp; Fishing Ck., is according to his Acct. a body of fine Land. I also saw a Son of Captn. John Hardens who said he had been from the Mouth of little Kanhawa to the big, but his description of the Lands seemed  
  
to be so vague and indeterminate, that it was  much doubted whether he ever was there or not. He says however that at the Mouth of the Big Kanhawa there may be abt. 20 or 25,000 acres of Land had in a Body that is good—that you are not above five or 6 Miles to the Hills, &amp; that the Falls of the Kanhawa are not above 10 Miles up it.  
  
  
  
  
At this point GW wrote: “Go to the end of the Almk.” The diary entries are continued on the back pages of the almanac.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Wednesday 17. Doctr. Craik &amp; myself with Captn. Crawford and others arrivd at Fort Pitt, distant from the Crossing 43½ Measurd Miles. In Riding this distance we pass over a great deal of exceeding fine Land (chiefly White Oak) especially from Sweigley Creek  to Turtle Creek  but the whole broken; resembling (as I think all the lands in this Country does) the Loudoun Land for Hills.  
We lodgd in what is calld the Town—distant abt. 300 yards from the Fort at one Mr. Semples  who keeps a very good House of Publick Entertainment. These Houses which are built of Logs, &amp; rangd into Streets are on the Monongahela, &amp; I suppose may be abt. 20 in Number and inhabited by Indian Traders &amp;ca.  
The Fort is built in the point between the Rivers Alligany &amp; Monongahela, but not so near the pitch of it as Fort Duquesne stood. It is 5 sided &amp; regular, two of which (next the Land) are of Brick; the others Stockade. A Mote incompasses it. The Garrison consists of two Companies of Royal Irish Commanded by one Captn. Edmondson.

y 18th. Dind in the Fort with Colo. Croghan &amp; the Officers of the Garrison. Supped there also meeting with great Civility from the Gentlemen, &amp; engagd to dine with Colo. Croghan the next day at his Seat abt. 4 Miles up the Alligany.  
  
  
  
Friday 19th. Recd. a Message from Colo. Croghan, that the White Mingo  &amp; other Chiefs of the 6 Nations had something to say to me, &amp; desiring that I woud be at his House abt. 11. (where they were to meet) I went up and receivd a Speech with a String of wampum from the White Mingo to the following effect.  
That as I was a Person who some of them remember to have  
  
seen when I was sent on an Embassy to the French, and most of them had heard of; they were come to bid me welcome to this Country, and to desire that the People of Virginia woud consider them as friends &amp; Brothers linked together in one chain—that I wd. inform the Governor, that it was their wish to live in peace and harmy. with the white People, &amp; that tho their had been some unhappy differences between them and the People upon our Frontiers, it was all made up, and they hopd forgotten; and concluded with saying, that, their Brothers of Virginia did not come among them and Trade as the Inhabitants of the other Provences did, from whence they were affraid that we did not look upon them with so friendly an Eye as they coud wish.  
To this I answerd (after thanking them for their friendly welcome) that all the Injuries &amp; Affronts that had passd on either side was now totally forgotten, and that I was sure nothing was more wishd and desird by the People of Virginia than to live in the strictest friendship with them. That the Virginians were a People not so much engagd in Trade as the Pensylvanians, &amp;ca., wch. was the Reason of their not being so frequently among them; but that it was possible they might for the time to come have stricter connections with them, and that I woud acquaint the Govr. with their desires.  
After dining at Colo. Croghan we returnd to Pittsburg—Colo. Croghan with us, who intended to accompany us part of the Way down the River, having engagd an Indian calld the Pheasant &amp; one Joseph Nicholson an Interpreter to attend us the whole Voyage. Also a young Indn. Warrior.

y 20th. We Imbarkd in a large Canoe with sufficient Stores of Provision &amp; Necessaries, &amp; the following Persons (besides Doctr. Craik &amp; myself) to wit—Captn. Crawford Josh. Nicholson Robt. Bell—William Harrison—Chs. Morgan &amp; Danl. Reardon a boy of Captn. Crawfords, &amp; the Indians who went in a Canoe by themselves. From Fort Pitt we sent our Horses &amp; boys back to Captn. Crawford wt. orders to meet us there again the 14th. day of November.  
Colo. Croghan, Lieutt. Hamilton and one Mr. Magee set out with us. At two we dind at Mr. Magees &amp; Incampd 10 Miles below, &amp; 4 above the Logs Town. We passd several large Island which appeard to [be] very good, as the bottoms also did on each side of the River alternately; the Hills on one side being opposite to the bottoms on the other which seem generally to be abt. 3 and 4 hundred yards wide, &amp; so vice versa.

, it was about ½ after Seven before we left our Incampment. At the distance of about 8 Miles we came to the Mouth of Yellow Creek (to the West) opposite to, or rather below which, appears to be a long bottom of very good Land, and the Assent to the Hills apparently gradual. There is another pretty large bottom of very good Land about two or 3 Miles above this. About 11 or 12 Miles from this, &amp; just above what is calld the long Island (which tho so distinguishd is not very remarkable for length breadth or goodness) comes in on the East side the River, a small Creek or Run the name of which I coud not learn; and a Mile or two below the Island, on the West Side, comes in big stony Creek (not larger in appearance than the other) on  
  
neither of which does there seem to be any large bottoms or body’s of good Land. About 7 Miles from the last Mentiond Creek 28 from our last Incampment, and about 75 from Pittsburg, we came to the Mingo Town Situate on the West side the River a little above the Cross Creeks.  
This place contains abt. Twenty Cabbins, &amp; 70 Inhabitants of the Six Nation.  
Had we set of early, &amp; kept pritty constantly at it, we might have reachd lower than this place today; as the Water in many places run pretty swift, in general more so than yesterday.  
The River from Fort Pitt to the Logs Town has some ugly Rifts &amp; Shoals, which we found somewhat difficult to pass, whether from our inexperience of the Channel, or not, I cannot undertake to say. From the Logs Town to the Mouth of little Bever Creek is much the same kind of Water; that is, Rapid in some places—gliding gently along in others, and quite still in many. The Water from little Bever Creek to the Mingo Town, in general, is swifter than we found it the preceeding day, &amp; without any shallows, there being some one part or other always deep which is a natural consequence as the River in all the distance from Fort Pitt to this Town has not widend any at all nor doth the bottoms appear to be any larger. The Hills which come close to the River opposite to each bottom are steep; &amp; on the side in view, in many places, Rocky &amp; cragged; but said to abound in good land on the Top. These are not a range of Hills but broken, &amp; cut in two as if there were frequent water courses running through (which however we did not perceive to be the case consequently they must be small if any). The River along down abounds in Wild Geese, and severl. kinds of Ducks but in no great quantity. We killd five wild Turkeys today.  
Upon our arrival at the Mingo Town we receivd the disagreeable News of two Traders being killd at a Town calld the Grape Vine Town, 38 Miles below this; which causd us to hesitate whether we shoud proceed or not, &amp; wait for further Intelligence

 23. Several imperfect Accts. coming in agreeing that only one Person was killd, &amp; the Indians not supposing it to be done by their people, we resolvd to pursue our passage, till we coud get some more distinct Acct. of this Transaction. Accordingly abt. 2 Oclock we set out with the two Indians which was to accompany us, in our Canoe, and in about 4 Miles came to the Mouth of a Creek calld Seulf Creek, on the East side; at the Mouth of which is a bottom of very good Land, as I am told there likewise is up it.  
The Cross Creeks (as they are calld) are not large, that on the West side however is biggest. At the Mingo Town we found, and left 60 odd Warriors of the Six Nations going to the Cherokee Country to proceed to War against the Cuttawba’s. About 10 Miles below the Town we came to two other cross Creeks  that on the West side largest, but not big; &amp; calld by Nicholson French Creek. About 3 Miles or a little better below this, at the lower point of some Islands  which stand contiguous to each other we were told by the Indians with us that three Men  from Virginia (by Virginians they mean all the People settled upon Redstone &amp;ca.) had markd the Land from hence all the way to Redstone—that there was a body of exceding fine Land lying about this place and up opposite to the Mingo Town—as also down to the Mouth of Fishing Creek. At this Place we Incampd.

y 24th. We left our Incampment before Sunrise, and abt. Six Miles below it, we came to the Mouth of a pretty smart Creek comg. in to the Eastward calld by the Indians Split Island Creek, from its running in against an Island. On this C[ree]k  
  
there is the appearance of good Land a distance up it. Six Miles below this again, we came to another Creek on the West side, calld by Nicholson Weeling  and abt. a Mile lower down appears to be another small Water coming in on the East side, which I remark, because of the Scarcity of them; &amp; to shew how badly furnishd this Country is with Mill Seats. Two or three Miles below this again, is another Run on the West side; up which is a near way by Land to the Mingo Town; and about 4 Miles lower comes in another on the East at which place is a path leading to the settlement at Redstone. Abt. A Mile &amp; half below this again, comes in the Pipe Creek so calld by the Indians from a Stone which is found here out of which they make Pipes. Opposite to this (that is on the East side), is a bottom of exceeding Rich Land; but as it seems to lye low, I am apprehensive that it is subject to be overflowd. This Bottom ends where the effects of a hurricane appears by the destruction &amp; havock among the Trees.  
Two or three Miles below the Pipe Creek is a pretty large Creek on the West side calld by Nicholson Fox Grape Vine by others Captema Creek on which, 8 Miles up it, is the Town calld the Grape Vine Town; &amp; at the Mouth of it, is the place where it was said the Traders livd, &amp; the one was killd. To this place we came abt. 3 Oclock in the Afternoon, &amp; findg. no body there, we agreed to Camp; that Nicholson and one of the Indians might go up to the Town, &amp; enquire into the truth of the report concerning the Murder.

y 25th. About Seven Oclock Nicholson &amp; the Indian returnd; they found no body at the Town but two Old Indian women (the Men being a Hunting). From these they learnt that the Trader was not killd, but drownd in attempting to Ford the Ohio; and that only one boy, belonging to the Trader, was in these parts; the Trader (fathr. to him) being gone for Horses to take home their Skins.  
  
About half an hour after 7 we set out from our Incampment around which, and up the Creek is a body of fine Land. In our Passage down to this, we see innumerable quantities of Turkeys, &amp; many Deer watering, &amp; brousing on the Shore side, some of which we killd. Neither yesterday nor the day before did we pass any Rifts or very rapid water—the River gliding gently along—nor did we perceive any alteration in the general face of the Country, except that the bottoms seemd to be getting a little longer &amp; wider, as the Bends of the River grew larger.  
About 5 Miles from the Vine Creek comes in a very large Creek to the Eastward calld by the Indian’s Cut Creek, from a Town, or a Tribe of Indians which they say was cut of entirely in a very bloody battle between them and the Six Nations. This Creek empties just at the lower end of an Island, and is 70 or 80 yards wide and I fancy is the Creek commonly calld by the People of Redstone &amp;ca. Weeling. It extends according to the Indians acct. a great way, &amp; Interlocks with the Branches of Split Island Creek; abounding in very fine bottoms, and exceeding good Land. Just below this, on the west side, comes in a sml. Run; &amp; about 5 Miles below it on the West side also another midling large Creek emptys, calld by the Indian broken Timber Creek; so named from the Timber that is destroyd on it by a Hurricane; on the head of this was a Town of the Delawares, which is now left. Two Miles lower down, on the same side, is another Creek smaller than the last &amp; bearing (according to the Indians) the same name. Opposite to these two Creeks (on the East side) appears to be a large bottom of good Land. About 2 Miles below the last mentiond Creek on the East side, &amp; at the end of the bottom aforementioned, comes in a sml. Creek or large Run. Seven Miles from this comes in Muddy Creek  on the East Side the River—a pretty large Creek and heads up against, &amp; with, some of the Waters of Monongehela (according to the Indians Acct.) &amp; contains some bottoms of very good Land; but in general the Hills are steep, &amp; Country broken

. At the Mouth of this Creek is the largest Flat I have seen upon the River; the Bottom extending 2 or 3 Miles up the River above it, &amp; a Mile below; tho it does not seem to be of the Richest kind and yet is exceeding good upon the whole, if it be not too low &amp; subject to Freshes.  
About half way in the long reach we Incampd, opposite to the beginning of a large bottom on the East side of the River. At this place we through out some lines at Night &amp; found a Cat fish of the size of our largest River cats hookd to it in the Morning, tho it was of the smallest kind here. We found no Rifts in this days passage,  
  
  
  
but pretty swift Water in some places, &amp; still in others. We found the bottoms increasd in size, both as to length &amp; breadth, &amp; the River more Chokd up with Fallen Trees &amp; the bottom of the River next the shores rather more Muddy but in general stony as it has been all the way down.

At the lower end of the long reach, &amp; for some distance up it, on the East side, is a large bottom, but low, &amp; coverd with beach next the River shore, which is no Indication of good Land.

rdinary as the Ohio in general, is remarkably crooked. There are several Islands in this reach, some containing an 100 or more Acres of land; but all I apprehend liable to be overflowed.  
At the end of this reach we found one Martin &amp; Lindsay two Traders; &amp; from them learnt, that the Person drownd was one Philips attempting in Compa. with Rogers another Indn. Trader, to Swim the River with their Horses at an improper place; Rogers himself narrowly escaping. Five Miles lower down, comes in a large Creek from the Eastward, right against an Island of good land, at least a Mile or two in length. At the mouth of this Creek (the name of wch. I coud not learn except that it was calld by some Bulls Creek from one Bull that hunted on it) is a bottom of good Land, tho rather two much mixd with Beach. Opposite to this Island the Indians showd us a Buffalo Path, the Tracks of which we see.  
Five or Six Miles below the last mentiond Creek we came to the three Island (before wch.) we observd a small run on each side coming in. Below these Islands is a large body of flat Land, with a water course running through it on the East Side, and the  
  
Hills back, neither so high, nor steep in appearance as they are up the River. On the other hand, the bottoms do not appear so rich, tho much longer &amp; wider. The bottom last mentioned is upon a strait reach of the River, I suppose 6 or 8 Miles in length; at the lower end of which, on the East side, comes in a pretty large Run from the size of the Mouth. About this, above—below &amp; back, there seems to be a very large Body of flat Land with some little risings in it.  
About 12 Miles below the three Islands we Incampd just above the Mouth of a Creek which appears pretty large at the Mouth and just above an Island. All the Lands from a little below the Creek which I have distinguished by the name of Bull Creek, appears to be level, with some small Hillocks intermixd, as far as we coud see into the Country. We met with no Rifts today, but some pretty strong water upon the whole tolerable gentle. The sides of the River was a good deal incommoded with old Trees, wch. impeded our passage a little.  
This day provd clear &amp; pleasant, the only day since the 18th. that it did not Rain or Snow or threaten the one or other

y 27. Left our Incampment a Quarter before Seven, and after passing the Creek near wch. we lay, &amp; another much the same size &amp; on the same side (West); also an Island abt. 2 Miles in length (but not wide) we came to the Mouth of Muskingham, distant from our Incampment abt. 4 Miles. This River is abt. 150 yards wide at the Mouth; a gentle currant &amp; clear stream runs out of it, &amp; is navigable a great way into the Country for Canoes.  
  
From Muskingham to the little Kanhawa is about 13 Miles. This is about as wide at the Mouth as the Muskingham, but the water much deeper. It runs up towards the Inhabitants of Monongahela, and according to the Indians Acct. Forks about 40 or 50 Miles up it; and the Ridge between the two Prongs leads directly to the Settlement. To this Fork, &amp; above, the Water is navigable for Canoes. On the upper side of this River there appears to be a bottom of exceeding rich Land and the Country from hence quite up to the 3 Islands level &amp; in appearance fine. The River (Ohio) running round it in the nature of a horse shoe, forms a Neck of flat Land wch. added to that rung. up the 2d. long reach (aforementiond) cannot contain less than 50,000 Acres in view.  
About 6 or 7 Miles below the Mouth of the Canhawa we came to a small Creek on the west side, which the Indns. calld little Hockhocking; but before we did this, we passd another sml. Creek on the same side near the Mouth of the River &amp; a cluster of Islands afterwards. The lands for two or three Miles below the Mouth of the Canhawa on both sides the Ohio, appear broken &amp; indifferent; but opposite to the little hockhocking there is a bottom of exceeding good Land, through wch. there runs a smal water course. I suppose there may be of this bottom &amp; flat Land together, two or three thousand Acres. The lower end of this bottom is opposite to a smal Island wch. I dare say little of it is to be seen when the River is high. About 8 Miles below little Hockhocking we Incampd opposite to the Mouth of the great Hockhocking, which tho so calld is not a large water; tho the Indians say Canoes can go up it 40 or 50 Miles.  
Since we left the little Kanhawa the Land neither appear so level nor good. The Bends of the River &amp; Bottoms are longer indeed but not so rich, as in the upper part of the River.

a very good appearance, the Bottom beginning above our Incampment, &amp; continuing in appearance wide for 4 Miles down, to a place where there comes in a smal Run &amp; to the Hills. And to where we found Kiashuta and his Hunting Party Incampd.  
Here we were under a necessity of paying our Compliments, As this person was one of the Six Nation Chiefs, &amp; the head of them upon this River. In the Person of Kiashuta I found an old acquaintance. He being one of the Indians that went with me to the French in 1753. He expressd a satisfaction in seeing me and treated us with great kindness, giving us a Quarter of very fine Buffalo. He insisted upon our spending that Night with him, and in order to retard us as little as possible movd his Camp down the River about 3 Miles just below the Mouth of a Creek the name of which I could not learn (it not being large). At this place we all Incampd. After much Councelling the overnight they all came to my fire the next Morning, with great formality; when Kiashuta rehearsing what had passd between me &amp; the Sachems at Colo. Croghan’s, thankd me for saying that Peace &amp; friendship was the wish of the People of Virginia (with them) &amp; for recommending it to the Traders to deal with them upon a fair &amp; equitable footing; and then again expressd their desire of having a Trade opend with Virginia, &amp; that the Governor thereof might not only be made acquainted therewith, but of their friendly disposition towards the white People. This I promisd to do.

Monday 29th. The tedious ceremony which the Indians observe in their Councellings &amp; speeches, detained us till 9 Oclock. Opposite to the Creek just below wch. we Incampd, is a pretty long bottom, &amp; I believe tolerable wide; but abt. 8 or 9 Miles below the aforemend. Creek, &amp; just below a pavement of Rocks on the  
  
west side, comes in a Creek with fallen Timber at the Mouth, on which the Indians say there is wide bottom’s, &amp; good Land. The River bottom’s above for some distance is very good, &amp; continues for near half a Mile below the Creek. The pavement of Rocks are only to be seen at low water. Abt. a mile, or a little better below the Mouth of the Creek there is another pavement of Rocks on the East side in a kind of Sedgey Ground. On this Creek many Buffaloes use[d to be] according to the Indians Acct. Six Miles below this comes in a small Creek on the west side at the end of a small naked Island, and just above another pavement of Rocks. This Creek comes thro a Bottom of fine Land, &amp; opposite to it (on the East side the River) appears to be large bottom of very fine Land also. At this place begins what they call the great Bent. 5 Miles below this again, on the East side, comes in (abt. 200 yds. above a little stream or Gut) another Creek; which is just below an Island, on the upper point of which are some dead standing trees, &amp; a parcel of white bodied Sycamores. In the Mouth of this Creek lyes a Scycamore blown down by the wind. From hence an East line may be Run 3 or 4 Miles; thence a North Line till it strikes the River, which I apprehend woud Include about 3 or 4000 Acres of exceeding valuable Land. At the Mouth of this C[ree]k which is 3 or 4 Miles above two Islands (at the lower end of the last, is a rapid, &amp; the Point of the Bend) is the Wariors Path to the Cherokee Country. For two Miles &amp; an half below this the River Runs a No. Et. Course, &amp; finished what they call the Great Bent. Two Miles &amp; an half below this again we Incampd.

y 30th. We set out at 50 Minutes passd Seven—the Weather being Windy &amp; Cloudy (after a Night of Rain). In about 2 Miles we came to the head of a bottom (in the shape of a horse Shoe) which I judge to be about 6 Miles r[oun]d; the beginning of the bottom appeard to be very good Land, but the lower part (from the Growth) did not seem so friendly. An East  
  
course from the lower end woud strike the River again above, about the Beging. of the bottom.  
The upper part of the bottom we Incampd in was an exceeding good one, but the lower part rather thin Land &amp; coverd with Beach. In it is some clear Meadow Land and a Pond or Lake. This bottom begins just below the Rapid at the point of the Great Bent, from whence a N. N. Wt. Course woud answer to run a parrallel to the next turn of the River.  
The River from this place narrows very considerably, &amp; for 5 or 6 Miles or more, is scarcely more than 150 or 200 yards over. The Water yesterday, except the Rapid at the Great Bent, &amp; some swift places about the Islands was quite Dead, &amp; as easily passd one way as the other; the Land in general appeard level &amp; good. About 10 Miles below our Incampment &amp; a little lower down than the bottom describd to lye in the shape of a horse Shoe comes in a small Creek on the West side, and opposite to this on the East begins a body of flat Land which the Indians tell us runs quite across the Fork to the Falls in the Kanhawa, and must at least be 3 days walk across. If so the Flat Land containd therein must be very considerable. A Mile or two below this we Landed, and after getting a little distance from the River we came (without any rising) to a pretty lively kind of Land grown up with Hicky. &amp; Oaks of different kinds, intermixd with Walnut &amp;ca. here &amp; there. We also found many shallow Ponds, the sides of which abounding in grass, invited innumerable quantities of wild fowl among which I saw a Couple of Birds in size between a Swan &amp; Goose; &amp; in colour somewhat between the two; being darker than the young Swan and of a more sutty Colour. The Cry of these was as unusual as the Bird itself, as I never heard any noize resembling it before. Abt. 5 Miles below this we Incampd. in a bottom of Good Land which holds tolerably flat &amp; rich for some distance out.  
  
  
  
Probably Leading Creek, entering the Ohio from the east, 18 miles below Letart’s Rapids.  
  
  
  
  
The Falls of the Great Kanawha are approximately 2 miles below the junction of the Gauley and New rivers. Hutchins notes, “After going 10 miles up Kanhawa the land is hilly, and the water a little rapid for 50 or 60 miles further to the Falls, yet Batteaus or Barges may be easily rowed thither. These Falls were formerly thought impassable; but late discoveries have proved, that a waggon road may be made through the mountain” (hutchinsThomas Hutchins.

18th. Dined in the fort with Col. Croghan and the  
officers of the garrison; supped there also, meeting with  
great civility from the gentlemen, and engaged to dine  
wih Col. Croghan the next day, at his seat, about four  
miles up the Allegheny.  
  
19th. Received a message from Col. Croghan, that  
the White Mingo and other chiefs of the six nations had  
something to say to me, and desiring that 1 would be at  
his house about eleven, where they were to meet. I  
went up and received a speech, with astring of wam-  
pum from the White Mingo, to the following effect.  
  
‘* That as ] was a person whom some of them remem-  
ber to have seen, when I was sent onan embassy to the  
French, and most of them lad heard of, they were come  
to bid me welcome to this country, and to des:re that  
the people of Virginia would consider them as friends  
and brothers, linked together in one chain; that I would  
inform the governor, that it was their wish to live in  
peace and harmony with the white people, and that  
though there had been some unhappy differences be-  
tween them and the people upon our frontiers, they  
were all made up, and they hoped forgotten; and con-  
cluded with saying, that their brothers of Virginia did  
not come among them and trade as the inhabitants of  
the other provinces did, from whence they were afraid  
that we did not look upon them with so friendly an eye  
as they could wish.”  
  
To this I answered, afier thanking them for their  
friendly weicome, ‘‘ that all the injuries and affronts,  
that had passed on either side, were now totally forgot-  
ten, and that I was sure nothing was more wished and  
desired by the people of Virginia, than to live in the  
strictest friendship with them; that the Virginians were  
a people not so much engaged in trade as the Pennsyl-  
vanians, which was the reason of their not being so fre-  
quently among them; but that it was possible they might  
for the time to come have stricter connections with  
them, and that | would acquaint the government with  
their desires.”  
  
After dining at Col. Croghan’s we returned to Pitts-  
burg, Colonel Croghan with us, who intended to ac-  
company us part of the way down the river, having en-  
  
gaged an Indian called the Pheasant, and one Joseph |  
  
Nicholson an interpreter, to attend us the whole voyage  
also a young [ndian warrior.

“ 12th—We left Killam’s early in the morning ; breakfasted at the Little  
Meadows, ten miles off, and lodged at the Great Crossing, twenty miles  
further, which we found a tolerably good day’s work. The country we

“ 13th—Set out about sunrise: breakfasted at the Great Meadows, thir-  
teen miles, and reached Captain Crawford’s* about five o’clock. ‘The land  
from Gist’s to Crawford’s is very broken, though not mountainous ; in  
Crawford’s is very  
fine land, lying on the Youghiogheny, at a place commonly called Stewart’s  
Crossing.  
  
“14th—At Captain Crawford’s all dav. Went to see a coal mine not  
far from his house, on the banks of the river. The coal seemed to be of  
the very best kind, burning freely, and abundance of it.  
  
“{5th— Went to view some land which Captain Crawford had taken up  
for me near the Youghiogheny, distant about twelve miles. ‘This tract,  
which contains about one thousand six hundred acres, includes some as fine  
land as ever I saw, and a great deal of rich meadow. It is well watered,  
  
| and has a valuable mill seat, except that the stream is rather too slight, and,  
  
it is said, not constant more than seven or eight months in the year; but on  
account of the fall, and other conveniences, no place can exceed it. In going  
to this land I passed through two other tracts which Captain Crawford had  
taken up for my brothers Samuel and John. I intended to have visited the  
land which Crawford had procured for Lund Washington, this day also, but  
time falling short, I was obliged to postpone it. Night came on before

got back to Crawford’s, where I found Colonel Stephen. ‘The lands which |  
I passed over to-day were generally hilly, and the growth chiefly white-oak, |  
but very good notwithstanding ; and what is extraordinary, and contrary to  
the property of all other lands I ever saw before, the hills are the richest  
land ; the soil upon the sides and summits of them being as black as a coal,  
and the growth walnut and cherry. ‘The flats are not so rich, and a good |  
deal more mixed with stone. |  
  
“ 16th—At Captain Crawford’s till the evening, when I went to Mr. John  
Stephenson’s, on my way to Pittsburgh, and lodged. ‘This day I was  
visited by one Mr, Ennis, who had travelled down the Little Kenahwa, al- |  
most from the head to the mouth, on which he says the lands are broken, |  
the bottoms neither wide nor rich, but covered with beach. At the mouth  
the lands are good, and continue so up the river. About Wheeling and  
Fisher’s creek there is, according to his account, a body of fine land, I  
also saw a son of Captain John Harden’s, who said he had been from the  
mouth of Little Kenahwa to the Big; but his description of the lands seem- |  
ed to be so vague and indeterminate, that it was much doubted whether he  
ever was there or not.  
  
“ 17th—Dr. Craik and myself, with Captain Crawford and others, arrived |  
at Fort Pitt, distant from the crossing forty-three and a half measured miles, |  
In riding this distance we passed over a great deal of exceedingly fine land, |  
chiefly white oak, especially from Sewickley creek to Turtle creek, but the |  
whole broken ; resembling, as I think the whole lands in this country do,  
the Loudoun lands, We lodged in what is called the town, distant about  
three hundred yards from the fort, at one Semple’s,* who keeps a very good  
house of public entertainment. The houses, which are built of logs, and  
ranged in streets, are on the Monongahela, and I suppose may be about  
twenty in number, and inhabited by Indian traders. The fort is built on |  
the point between the rivers Allegheny and Monongahela, but not so near |  
the pitch of it as Fort Duquesne stood. It is five sided and regular, two of |  
which near the land are of brick; the others stockade, A moat encom-  
passes it. The garrison consists of two companies of Royal Irish, com-  
manded by Captain Edmondson.

four miles up the Allegheny.*  
  
“ 19th—Received a message from Colonel Croghan, that the White Mingo  
and other chiefs of the Six Nations had something to say to me, and desir-  
ing that I would be at his house about eleven, where they were to meet me,  
I went up and received a speech, with a string of wampum, from the White  
Mirgo,t to the following effect :  
  
« «That as I was a person whom some of them remember to have seen  
when I was sent on an embassy to the French, and most of them had heard  
of, they were come to bid me welcome to this country, and desire that the  
people of Virginia would consider them as friends and brothers, linked  
together in one chain; that I would inform the governor that it was their  
wish to live in peace and harmony with the white people, and: that though  
there had been some unhappy differences between them and the people on  
our frontiers, they were all made up, and they hoped forgotten; and con-  
cluded with saying that their brothers of Virginia did not come among  
them and trade as the inhabitants of other provinces did, from whence they  
were afraid that we did not look upon them with so friendly an eye as they  
could wish.’  
  
“To this I answered, afier thanking them for their friendly welcome,  
‘ that all the injuries and affronts that had passed on either side, were now  
totally forgotten, and that I was sure nothing was more wished and desired  
by the people of Virginia, than to live in the strictest friendship with them ;  
that the Virginians were a people not so much engaged in trade as the Penn-  
sylvanians, which was the reason of their not being so much among them,  
| but that it was possible they might for the time to come have stricter con-  
nexions with them, and that I would acquaint the government with their  
desires,’

* After we dined at Colonel Croghan’s we returned to Pittsburgh, Colonel  
Croghan with us, who intended to accompany us part of the way down  
the river, having engaged an Indian called the Pheasant, and one Joseph |  
Nicholson, an interpreter, to attend us the whole voyage, also a young In- |  
dian warrior.  
  
6 20th.— We embarked in a large canoe, with sufficient store of provis*  
ions and necessaries, and the following persons besides Dr. Craik and my-  
self, to wit, Captain Crawford, Joseph Nicholson, Robert Bell, William  
Harrison, Charles Morgan and Daniel Rendon, a boy of Captain Crawford’s,  
and the Indians, who were in a canoe by themselves. From Fort Pitt we  
sent our horses and boys back to Captain Crawford’s, with orders to meet  
us there again on the 14th day of November. Colonel Croghan, Lieuten-  
ant Hamilton and Mr. Magee set out with us. At two we dined at Mr.  
Magee’s,* and encamped ten miles below, and four above Logstown. We  
passed several large islands which appeared to be very good, as the bottoms  
also did on each side of the river alternately; the hills on one side being  
opposite to the bottoms on the other, which seem generally to be about  
three or four hundred yards wide, and so vice versa.

_ it was about half after seven before we left our encampment. At the dis-  
tance of about eight miles we came to the mouth of Yellow creek, opposite  
to, or rather below which, appears to be a long bottom of very good land,  
_and the ascent to the hills apparently gradual. There is another pretty  
large bottom of very good land about two or three miles above this. About  
eleven or twelve miles from this, and just above what is called the Long  
Island (which though so distinguished, is not very remarkable for length,  
breadth or goodness,) comes in on the east side of the river a small creek,  
| or run, the name of which I could not learn; and a mile or two below the  
Island, on the west side, comes in Big Stony Creek, (not larger in appear-  
ance than the other,) on neither of which does there seem to be any large  
bottoms or bodies of good land. About seven miles from the last mentioned  
creek, twenty-eight from our last encampment, and about seventy-five from  
Pittsburgh, we came to the Mingo Town, situate on the west side of the river,  
a little above the Cross creeks, This place contains about twenty cabins,  
and seventy inhabitants of the Six Nations. Had we set off early, and  
kept constantly at it, we might have reached lower than this place to-day,  
as the water in many places ran pretty swift, in general more so than yes-  
terday. The river from Fort Pitt to Logstown has some ugly rifts and  
| shoals, which we found somewhat difficult to pass, whether from our inex-  
| perience of the channel or not, I cannot undertake to say. From Logstown  
to the mouth of Little Beaver creek is much the same kind of water; that  
is, rapid in some places, gliding gently along in others, and quite still in  
many. ‘The water from Little Beaver creek to Mingo Town, in general,  
is swifter than we found it the preceding day, and without any shallows ;  
there being some one part or another always deep, which is a natural con-  
sequence, as the river in all the distance from Fort Pitt to this town has  
not widened at all, nor do the bottoms appear to be any larger. The hills  
which come close to the river opposite to each bottom are steep; and on  
the side in view, in many places, rocky and cragged ; but said to abound in  
good land on the tops. ‘These are not a range of hills, but broken and cut  
in two, as if there were frequent water courses running through, which  
however we did not perceive to be the case. The river abounds in wild  
| geese, and several kinds of ducks, but in no great quantity. We killed  
five wild turkeys to-day. Upon our arrival at the Mingo Town, we re-  
ceived the disagreeable news of two traders being killed at a town called  
the Grape-Vine town, thirty-eight miles below this; which caused us to  
hesitate whether we should proceed or wait for further intelligence

Cross creeks, as they are called, are not large; that on the west side is  
biggest. At the Mingo Town we found and left more than sixty warriors  
  
  
  
  
  
of the Six Nations, going to the Cherokee country to proceed to war against |  
  
the Catawbas. About ten miles below the town, we came to two other

French creek, About three miles, or a little more, below this, at the lower  
point of some islands, which stand contiguous to each other, we were told  
by the Indians, that three men from Virginia had marked the land from  
  
hence all the way to Red stone ; that there was a body of exceedingly fine |  
land lying about this place, and up opposite to the Mingo town, as also |  
  
down to the mouth of Fishing creek. At this place we encamped.

“ 24th.—We left our encampment before sunrise, and about six miles  
below it we came to the mouth of a small creek, coming in from the east-  
ward, called by the Indians Split-Island creek, from its running in against  
an island. On this creek there is the appearance of good land. Six miles  
below this again we came to another creek on the west side, called by  
Nicholson, Wheeling, and about a mile lower down appears to be another  
small water coming in on the east side, which I remark because of a scarcity  
of them, and to show how badly furnished this country is with mill seats, |  
Two or three miles below this is another run on the west side, up which |  
is a near way by Jand to the Mingo town, and about four miles lower, comes |  
in another on the east, at which place is a path leading to the settlement at  
Redstone. About a mile and a half below this comes in the Pipe creek,  
so called by the Indians from a stone which is found here out of which they  
make pipes. Opposite to this, that is, on the east side, is a bottom of ex-  
ceedingly rich land ; but as it seems to lie low, I am apprehensive that it is  
subject to be overflowed. ‘This bottom ends where the effects of a hurri-  
cane appear, by the destruction and havoc among the trees. ‘Two or three |  
miles below the Pipe creek is a pretty large creek on the west side called |  
by Nicholson Fox-Grape-Vine, by others, Captema creek, on which, eight  
miles up, is the town called the Grape Vine town, and at the mouth of it is |  
the place where it was said the trader was killed. ‘To this place we came |  
about three o’clock in the afternoon, and finding nobody there, we agreed |  
to encamp, that Nicholson and one of the Indians might go up to the town |  
and inquire into the truth of the report concerning the murder. |  
  
“ 25th.—About seven o’clock Nicholson and the Indian returned ; they  
found nobody at the town but two old Indian women, (the men being a |  
hunting ;) from these they learned that the trader was not murdered but  
drowned in attempting to cross the Ohio; and that only one boy belonging |  
to the traders was in these parts, the trader, his father, being gone for horses |  
to take home their skins. About half an hour after seven we set out from |  
our encampment; around which and up the creek is a body of fine Jand.

In our passage down to this place we saw innumerable quantities of turkeys,  
  
and many deer watering and browsing on the shore side, some of which we  
killed. Neither yesterday nor the day before did we pass any rifts, or very  
rapid water, the river gliding gently along; nor did we perceive any alter-  
  
_ ation in the general face of the country, except that the bottoms seemed to  
| be getting a little longer and wider, as the bends of the river grew larger.  
  
About five miles from the Vine creek comes in a very large creek to the  
  
  
  
eastward, called by the Indians Cut creek, from a town or tribe of Indians, |  
  
which they say was cut off entirely in a very bloody battle between them  
  
Island creex ; aboundiug in very fine bottoms and exceeding good land.  
Just below this, on the west side comes in a small run, and about five miles  
below it,on the westside also, another creek empties, called by the Indians  
Broken Timber creek, so named from the timber that is destroyed on it by  
a hurricane; on the head of this was a town of the Delawares, which is  
now deserted. ‘Two miles lower down, on the same side, is another creek

dinary as the Ohio in general is remarkably crooked. ‘There are several  
islands in this reach, some containing an hundred or more acres of land ;  
but all, I apprehend, liable to be overflowed.  
  
* At the end of this reach we found Martin and Lindsay, two traders, and  
from them learnt that the person drowned was one Philips, attempting, in  
company with Rogers, another Indian trader, to swim the river with their |  
horses at an improper place; Rogers himself narrowly escaping. Five  
miles lower down comes in a large creek from the east, right against an  
island of good land, at least a mile or two in length, At the mouth of this  
creek, the naine of which I could not learn, except that it was called by  
some Ball’s creek, from one Ball that hunted on it, is a bottom of good  
land, though rather too much mixed with beach. Opposite to this island  
the Indians showed us a buffalo’s path, the tracks of which we saw. Five  
or six miles below the last mentioned creek we came to the Three Islands.  
Below these islands is a large body of flat land, with a water course run-  
ning through it on the east side, and the hills back neither so high nor steep  
in appearance, as they are up the river. On the other hand, the bottoms  
do not appear so rich, though much longer and wider. The bottom last  
mentioned is upon a straight reach of the river, I suppose six or eight miles  
in length. About twelve miles below the Three Islands we encamped, just  
above the mouth of the creek, which appears pretty large at the mouth, and |  
just above an island. All the lands from a little below the creek, which |  
I have distinguished by the name of Ball’s creek appear to be level, with |  
small hillocks intermixed, as far as we could see into the country. We)  
met with no rifts to-day, but some pretty strong water; upon the whole |  
tolerably gentle. The sides of the river were a good deal incommoded |  
with old trees, which impeded our passage a iittle. This day proved clear |  
and pleasant, the only day since the 18th that it has not rained or snowed,  
or threatened the one or the other.

27th.—Left our encampment a quarter before seven, and after passing |  
the creek near which we lay, and another of much the same size and on |  
the same side, also an island about two miles in length but not wide, we I  
came to the mouth of Muskingum, distant from our encampment about  
four miles. ‘This river is about one hundred and fifty yards wide at the |  
mouth ; it runs out in a gentle current and clear stream, and is navigable a ||  
great way into the country for canoes. From Muskingum to Little Ken- I  
hawa is about thirteen miles. This is about as wide at the mouth as the | |  
Muskingum, but the water much deeper. It runs up towards the inhabi- |  
tants of Monongahela, and according to the Indian account, forks about ||  
forty or fifty miles from the mouth, and the ridge between the two prongs ||  
leads directly to the settlement. ‘To this fork, and above, the water is nav- |  
igable for canoes. On the upper side of this river there appears to bea |  
bottom of exceedingly rich land, and the country from hence quite up to |

less than fifty thousand acres in view.

Kenhawa on both sides of the Ohio appear broken and indifferent: but  
  
bottom and flat land together, two or three thousand aeres. ‘The lower  
end of this bottom is opposite to a small island, of which I dare say little  
is to be seen when the river is high. About eight miles below Little Hock-  
hocking we encamped opposite to the mouth of the Great Hockhocking,  
which, though so called, is not a large water, though the Indians say  
canoes can go up it forty or fifty miles. Since we left the Little Kenhawa  
the lands appear neither so level nor so good. The bends of the river and  
| bottoms are longer, but not so rich as in the upper part of the river.

a fair and equitable footing ; and then again expressed their desire of having  
a trade opened with Virginia, and that the Governor thereof might not only  
be made acquainted therewith, but with their friendly disposition towards  
the white people. ‘This I promised to do.  
  
“29th—The tedious ceremony which the indians observe in their coun-  
sellings and speeches, detained us till nine o’clock. Opposite to the creek,  
just below which we encamped, is a pretty long bottom, and I believe tol-  
erably wide; but about eight or nine miles below the aforementioned creek,  
and just below a pavement of rocks on the west side, comes in a creek |  
with fallen timber at the mouth, on which the Indians say there are wide |  
bottoms of good land. ‘The river bottoms above, for some distance, are |  
very good, and continue so for near half a mile below the creek. ‘The  
pavement of rocks is only to be seen at low water. About a mile below  
the mouth of the creek there is another pavement of rocks on the east side,  
in a kind of sedgy ground. On this creek are many buffaloes, according |  
to the Indian account. Six miles below this comes in a small creek on the  
west side, at the end of a small, naked island, and just above another pave-  
ment of rocks. ‘This creek comes through a bottom of fine land, and oppo-  
site to it, on the east side of the river, appears to be a large bottom of very  
fine land also. At this place begins what they call the Great Bend. ‘Two  
miles below, on the east side, comes in another creek, just below an island, |  
on the upper point of which are some dead standing trees, and a parcel of  
of white bodied sycamores; in the mouth of this creek lies a sycamore  
blown down by the wind. From hence an east line may be run three or |  
four miles, thence a north line till it strikes the river, which I apprehend |  
would include about three or four thousand acres of valuable land. At the |  
mouth of this creek is the warrior’s path to the Cherokee country. For  
two miles and a half below this the Ohio runs a north-east course, and |  
finishes what they call the Great Bend. ‘Two miles and a half below this  
  
we encamped.  
  
“ 30th—We set out about fifty minutes past seven, the weather being  
windy and cloudy, after a night of rain. After about two miles we came  
to the head of a bottom, in the shape of a horse shoe, which I judge to be  
about six miles round; the beginning of the bottom appeared to be very  
good land, but the lower part did not appear so friendly. ‘The upper part  
of the bottom we encamped on was exceeding good, but the lower part  
rather thin land, covered with beech. In it is some clear meadow land,  
and a pond or lake. ‘This bottom begins just below the rapid at the Grand  
Bend. ‘The river from this place narrows very considerably, and for five  
or six miles is scarcely more than one hundred and fifty or two hundred  
yards over. ‘I&#x27;he water yesterday, except the rapid at the Great Bend and  
some swift places about the islands, was quite dead, and as easily passed  
one way as the other; the land in general appeared level and good.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
WASHINGTON&#x27;S TOUR TO THE OHIO. 427  
  
  
  
«About ten miles below our encampment, and a little lower down than  
_ the bottom described to lie in the shape of a horse shoe, comes in a small  
creek on the west side, and opposite to this on the east begins a body of  
flat land, which the Indians tell us runs quite across the fork to the falls of  
the Kenhawa, and must be at least three days’ walk across; if so, the flat  
land contained therein must be very considerable. A mile or two below  
this we landed, and after getting a little distance from the river, we came,  
_ without any rising, to a pretty Jively kind of land grown up with hickory  
| and oaks of different kinds, intermixed with walnut. We also found many  
| shallow ponds, the sides of which, abounding with grass, invited innumer-  
| able quantities of wild fowl, among which I saw a couple of birds in size  
  
| between a swan and goose, and in color somewhat between the two, being  
| darker than the young swan and of a more sooty color. The cry of these  
birds was as unusual as the birds themselves; I never heard any noise re-  
sembling it before. About five miles below this we encamped in a bottom  
of good land, which holds tolerably flat and rich for some distance out.

about five o’clock. The land from Gist’s to Crawford’s  
is very broken, although not mountainous; in spots ex-  
ceedingly rich, and, in general, free from stones. Craw-  
ford’s is very fine land; lying on the Youghiogheny, at a  
place commonly called Stewart’s Crossing.  
  
14th—At Captain Crawford’s all day. Went to see a  
coal mine, not far from his house, on the banks of the river.  
The coal seemed to be of the very best kind, burning freely,  
and abundance of it.  
  
15th.—Went to view some land, which Captain Craw-  
ford had taken up for me near the Youghiogheny, distant  
about twelve miles. This tract, which contains about one  
thousand six hundred acres, includes some as fine land as  
ever I saw, and a great deal of rich meadow. It is well  
watered, and has a valuable mill-seat, except that the stream  
is rather too slight, and, it is said, not constant more than  
seven or eight months in the year; but, on account of the  
fall, and other conveniences, no place can exceed it. In go-  
ing to this land, I passed through two other tracts, which  
Captain Crawford had taken up for my brothers, Samuel  
and John. I intended to have visited the land, which  
Crawford had procured for Lund Washington, this day  
also, but, time falling short, I was obliged to postpone it.  
Night came on before I got back to Crawford’s. . . . The  
lands, which I passed over to-day, were generally hilly, and  
the growth chiefly white oak, but very good notwithstand-  
ing; and, what is extraordinary, and contrary to the prop-  
erty of all other lands I ever saw before, the hills are the  
richest land; the soil upon the sides and summits of them  
being as black as coal, and the growth walnut and cherry.
