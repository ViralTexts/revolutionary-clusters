Sir  
Head Qrs 3d May 1782  
  
The Enemy, persisting in that barbarous line of Conduct they have pursued during the course of this war, have lately most inhumanly Executed Capt. Joshua Huddy of the Jersey State Troops taken Prisoner by them at a Post on Toms River—and in consequence, I  
have written to the British Commander in Chief, that unless the perpetrators of that horrid deed were delivered up, I should be under the disagreeable necessity of Retaliating, as the only means left to put a stop to such inhuman proceedings.  
You will therefore immediately on recet of this designate by Lot for the above purpose—a British Captain who is an unconditional Prisoner, if such a one is in our possession—if not—a Lieutenant under the same circumstances, from among the Prisoners at any  
of the Posts either in Pennsylvania or Maryland.   
So soon as you have fixed on the Person—you will send him under a Safe Guard to Philadelphia, where the Minister of War will order a proper Guard to receive &amp; conduct him to the place of his Destination.  
In your information respecting the Officers, who are Prisoners in our possession, I have orderd the Commisy of Prisoners to furnish you with a List of them—it will be forwarded with this.  
I need not mention to you that every possible tenderness, that is consistent with the security of him, should be shewn to the person whose unfortunate lot it may be to suffer.

‘The enemy, persisting in that barbarous line of conduct  
they have pursued during the war, have lately most inhumanly  
executed Captain Joshua Huddy, of the Jersey State Troops,  
taken prisoner by them at a post on Tom’s River; and, in con-  
sequence, I have written to the British commander-in-chief that  
unless the perpetrators of this horrid deed were delivered up,  
I should be under the necessity of retaliating, as the only  
means left to put a stop to such inhuman proceedings. You  
will, therefore immediately, on receipt of this, designate by lot  
for the above purpose a British captain who is an uncondi-  
tional prisoner, if such a one is in our possession; if not, a  
lieutenant under the same circumstances from amongst the  
prisoners at either of the two posts in Pennsylvania or Mary-  
land. As soon as you have fixed upon the person, you will  
send him under a safe guard to Philadelphia, where the Minister  
of War will order a proper guard to receive him and conduct him  
to his place of destination. For your information respecting  
the officers who are prisoners in our possession, I have ordered  
the commissary of prisoners to furnish, you with a list of them.  
It will be forwarded with this. I need not mention
