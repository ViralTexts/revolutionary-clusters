Sir,  
  
28 March 1782  
  
  
The spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters, &amp; bringing off the Prince-William Henry &amp; Admiral Digby, merits applause; and you have my authority to make the attempt; in any manner, &amp; at such a time as  
your own judgment shall direct.  
I am fully perswaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince, or Admiral should you be so fortunate as to capture them; but it may not be amiss to impress the propriety of a proper line of  
conduct upon the party you command.  
In case of success, you will, as soon as you get them to a place of safety, treat them with all possible respect, but you are to delay no time in conveying them to Congress, &amp; reporting your proceedings with a copy of these orders. Given at Morris Town  
this 28th day of March 1782.  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
Note.Take care not to touch upon the ground wch is agreed to be Neutral—viz. from Raway to Newark &amp; four miles back.

my authority to make your attempt, in any
