The Secretary of the Treasury having maturely considered the subject referred to him by the order of the House of Representatives of the   day of  last relatively to the establishment of a Mint most respectfully submits the result of his inquiries investigation and reflections.  
A plan for an establishment of this nature involves a great prodigious vast variety of considerations intricate nice and important. The general state of debtor and Creditor; all the relations and consequences of price; the essential interests of trade and industry; the value of all property the whole income both of the State and of revenues of the Country, as well of the public as of the individuals; are liable to be sensibly influenced, beneficially or otherwise injuriously, by the injudicious or injudicious regulation of this important matter. very interesting object.

And yet the new dollar still passes has a currency in all payments in place of the old, with scarcely scarcely any attention to the difference between them. The effect of this operation of this, in depreciating the value of all property, depending upon past contracts, and of all other property (as far as inattention to the alteration in the coins may be supposed to leave prices uninfluenced stationary) and uninfluenced of all other property, is too we is apparent.

s the information of the Secretary goes the same comparison holds in the other states.  
But this circumstance, in favour of the dollar, loses much of its weight from two considerations. That species of Coin has never had any settled or a standard value according to weight or fineness; but has been permitted to circulate by tale, without regard to either; very much as a mere money of convenience; while gold has had a fixed price by par by weight and in some instances with an eye to its fineness. This greater stability of value of the gold coins is an argument of force force for considering the money unit as having been a hitherto virtually attached to gold, rather than to silver.  
And it is found It appears by comparison and calculation that Twenty four grains and 6/8 of a Grain of fine gold have corresponded with the nominal value of the dollar in the several states; without regard to the successive diminutions of its intrinsic worth. But If if the Dollar should notwithstanding be supposed to have the best title to being considered as the present money unit in the Coins, it would remain to ascertain ascertain determine what kind of dollar ought to be understood, or, in other words, what precise quantity of fine silver.  
The old piastre of Spain, which appears to have regulated our foreign exchange, weighed 17 dwt. 12 grains and contained 117 386 grains &amp; 15 Mites of fine silver. But this piece has been for a long since time past out of circulation. The dollars now and for several years past in common currency are of recent date and much inferior to that both in weight and finess. The average weight of them upon repeated different trials in large masses, has been found to be 17.8 dwt grains. Their finess is less precisely ascertained; is the results of various assays made by different persons, under the direction of the late Superintendant of the Finances and of the Secretary himself are being as various as the assays themselves.

The difference, established by custom in the United States between coined gold and coined silver has been stated upon another occasion, to be nearly as 1 to 15.6. This, if truly the case, would imply that gold was extremely overvalued in the United States, for the highest actual proportion in any part of Europe very little if at all does not exceeds 1 to 15 and the average proportion throughout Europe is probably not more than about as 1 to 14¾ 14.8 8. But that statement has proceeded upon the sup idea of the ancient old dollar. One penny weight of coined gold of 22 Carats fine at 6/8 and the old seville piece of 386 grains and 15 mites of pure silver at 7/6 furnish the exact proportion ration of 1 to 15.6262.

If the general declaration, that the dollar shall be the money unit of the United States could be understood to give it a superior peculiar legality in payments, the institution of coins of gold and the declaration; that each of them shall be equal to a certain number of dollars would appear to destroy that inference: And the circumstance of making the dollar the unit in the money of account seems to be more rather matter of form than of substance.

l value which they bear to each other: If it be attached or if annexed peculiarily preferably to one of them, it will as evidently be more or less stable, in proportion as that to which it is annexed is the one, which has itself most or least stability. But the same reason would lead to annexing it to that particular one metal which has the greatest pretensions to stability which is itself the least liable to variation; if there is be in this respect any discernible difference between the two.  
Gold may perhaps in certain senses be said to have more greater stability, than silver: As being of superior value, fewer liberties have been taken with it in the regulations of different countries. Its standard has been remained more uniform and it has in other respects been subject to undergone less fewer fewer changes: As being less a Merchandize in an article of than silver both America and in Europe on account of the demand for use made of the latter in the Trade owing to the nature of the intercourse with China and the East Indies, it is less liable to be affeced by the vicissitudes of Commercial demand. As being not so much an article of Merchandize as Silver, on account of the considerable owing to the use made of the latter  silver in the Trade with the East Indies and China, it is less liable to be influenced by circumstances of Commercial demand. And, if reasoning by analogy, it could be added, without the appearance of too much refinement, that there is a physical probability of greater proportional proportional increase, in the absolute quantity of silver, than in that of gold, it would afford an additional argument of reason for calculating on greater steadiness stability steadiness   firm in the value of the latter.  
As long as gold, either from its intrinsic superiority as a metal, from its greater rarity, or from the prejudices of mankind maintains retains so great a superiority vast considerable a preeminence in value over silver, a natural consequence of this seems to will be that its condition will be more stationary. The revolutions therefore wi which may take place in the comparattive value of gold and silver will be changes in the state of the latter rather than of the former. And in this view, the money unit of the Unit of the United States, if affixed to silver, would would be continually or frequently varying in relation to the money of the world: A circumstance which cannot hardly be deemed an either a convenient

 there should be an appearance of too much abstraction in any of these ideas it may be remarked that the first &amp; most simple impressions do not naturally incline to giving a preference to the inferior or least valuable of the two metals.  
It is sometimes observed that silver ought to be encouraged rather than gold as being more conducive to the extension of Bank Circulation, from the greater difficulty, and inconvenience, which its greater bulk, compared with its value, occasions in the transportation of it. But bank circulation is desireable rather as an auxiliary too than as a substitute for that of the precious metals; and it ought to be left to its nature course without the aid ought to be left to its natural course.

ve annexation of the unit to one of the metals has been frequently recommended. This is to leave the one to which it is not attached to find its level consider the one to which it is not attached as mere bullion.  
But the effect of this would be to destroy the utility of one of the Metals as money  
But upon the whole it seems to be most adviseable not to attach the unit exclusively to either of the metals because this cannot be done effectually, without destroying the office and character of one of them as money, and reducing it to the situation of mere bullion; And which accordingly, this at different times has been proposed from different and very respectable quarters; but which would probably be a greater evil than occasional fluctu variations in the unit from the fluctuations in the proportional relative value of the metals; especially if care be taken in the to regulate of the that proportion between them with an eye in conf with an eye to their average commercial value.  
To annul the use of either of the metals as money is to abrige the quantity of circulating medium and is liable to all the objections which arise from a comparson of the benefits of a full with the evils of a defective scanty circulation.

d might so far impede the introduction of the metals. Neither could the exclusion of either of the metals them be deemed in other respects favourable to commerce. It is often in the course of trade as desireable to possess the kind of money as the kind of commodities best adapted to a foreign market.  
If then the unit ought not to be attached exclusively to either of the metals, it becomes the proportion which ought to be established between them in the coins becomes a preliminary inquiry in order to its proper adjustment,. a matter which This proportion appears  to be in several views of no inconsiderable moment.  
One consequence of overvaluing either metal in respect to the other is the banishment of that which is undervalued. If two countries are supposed, in one of which the proportion of between Gold and to Silver is as 1 to 16, in the other as one to 15; as in the firmer one gold will be being worth more silver less in one than in than in the other, it is manifest that in their reciprocal payments each will select that species which it values least to pay to the other which where it is valued it more most. Besides this, the dealers in money will, an of from the same cause, often find a profitable traffic in an exchange of the metals between the two countries. And hence it would come to pass, if other things were equal, that the greatest part of the gold would be collected in one, and the greatest part of the silver in the other.

 To declare that a less weight of gold or silver shall pass for the same sum which before represented a greater weight or to ordain that the same weight shall pass for a greater sum are things substantially of one nature. And The consequences of either of them, if the change can be realized, is are, to degrade the money unit below its intrinsic value; obliging to depreciate the val to oblige creditors to receive less than their just dues—and indeed to depreciating property of every kind: For it is manifest that every thing would in this case be represented by a less quantity of gold and silver than before.  
It is sometimes observed on this head, that though every spe any article of property might in fact be represented by a less actual quantity of pure metal it would nevertheless be represented by something of the same intrinsic value. Every fabric or manufacture it is remarked is worth intrinsically the price of the raw material and the expence of fabrication; a truth not less applicable to a piece of coin than to a yard of cloth.  
This position well founded in itself is here misapplied. It supposes that the coins now in circulation are to be considered as bullion or in other words as a raw material. But the fact is, that the adoption of them as money has caused them to become the fabric. It has invested them with the character and office of coins and has given them a sanction and efficacy equivalent to that of the stamp of the sovereign. The prices of all our commodities at home and abroad and of all foreign commodities in our markets have found their level in conformity to this principle. The foreign coins may be divested of the privilege they have hitherto been permitted to enjoy and may of course be left to find their value in the market comparison with the national coin as a raw material. But the quantity of gold and silver in the national coins corresponding with a given sum cannot be made less than before heretofore without disturbing the ballance of intrinsic value; and making every acre of land as well as every bushel of wheat of less actual worth than in time past. If the United States were insulated and s cut off from all intercourse with the reas rest of mankind the world this reasoning would not be just equally conslusive. just. But it appears when considered with a view to. the relations which Commerce has created between us and other countries.  
The probability however is that the effect meditated would be defeated by a rise of prices not be produced; that prices would not rise in proportioned to the diminution of the intrinsic value of the coins. This might be looked for in every enlightened commercial country; but perhaps in none with greater certainty than in this—because in none are men less liable to be the dupes of sounds names—in none has authority so little resource, for contravening the natural course of things substituting names to things.  
Such a revolution in prices  
A general revolution in prices though only nominally and in appearance could not fail to would distract the idea of community and would be apt to breed discontents as well among all those who live on the income of their money as among the lo poorer classes of the people to whom the necessaries of life would seem to have become dearer. In con the confusion of such a state of things ideas of value would be most likely to adhere to the old coins; which from that circumstance instead of feeling the effect of the loss of their privilege as money, would probably from that circumstance, consequently bear a price in the market corresponding with the relatively to the new ones eg answering to the difference of weight. in ea in exact proportion to weight. The frequency of the demand for the metals to pay foreign ballances would contribute to this effect.  
  
Among the evils, attendant on such an operation, are these—Creditors both of the public and of individuals would lose a part of their property—Public and private credit would receive a serious wound—the effective revenues of the government would be materially diminished. There is scarcely any point, in the œconomy of national affairs, of greater moment than the uniform preservation of the intrinsic value of the money unit. On this the security &amp; steady value of property essentially depend.  
The second method therefore of defraying the expence of the coinage out of the metals is greatly to be preferred to the other. This is to let in practise to let the same quantity of gold a

It accor consequently had in respect to them a correspondent rise in the market. And as Guineas were then current by tale, the new ones, as they issued from the mint, were confounded in circulation with the old ones; and, by the association, were became depreciated below their intrinsic value, in comparison with bullion. It became, of course, a profitable traffic, to sell bullion for coin, to select the light pieces ones and reissue them in currency and to melt down the heavy ones and sell them again as bullion.

e between the value of coin and bullion than has been mentioned. It will be better to have to increase it hereafter if this shall be found, expedient found the experiment shall recommend its being done than to have to recede from too considerable a difference in consequence of evils which shall have been experienced.  
It is sometimes mentioned as an expedient, which consistently with a free coinage may serve tend to prevent the evils desired to be avoided, to incorporate in the coins a greater proportion quantity of alloy than is usual; (regulating their value nevertheless according to the quantity of pure metal they contain). This, it is supposed, by adding to the difficulty of refining them would cause bullion to be preferred both for manufacture and exportation.  
But strong objections lie against this scheme—These are—an augmentation addition of expence—an actual depreciation of the coin—a danger of still greater depreciation in the public opinion—a greater facility of counterfieting the facilitating of counterfiets—while it is questionable, whether it would have the effect expected from it.  
No value lies  
The alloy being considered as of esteemed of having no value attached to it, an increase of it is evidently an increase of expence. This in relation to the gold coins particularly is a matter of moment. It has been noted stated that the alloy in them consists partly of silver. If to avoid expence, the addition should be of copper only, this would spoil the appearance of the coins and give it them a base countenance. Its beauty would indeed be injured though in a less degree, by the increase of even the proposed increase even if the usual proportions of silver and copper should be maintained in the increased additional quantity of of the alloy.  
And however inconsiderable an expend additional expenditure of copper, in the coinage of a year, may be deemed, appears in a series of years it would become of consequence. In regulations, which contemplate the lapse and operation of ages, a very small item of expence acquires importance.  
The actual depreciation of the coin, by an increase of alloy, results from the very circumstance, which is the motive to it—the greater difficulty of refining—In England, it has been is customary for goldsmiths and others those concerned in manufactures of gold to make a deduction in the price of four pence sterling per ounce of fine gold for every carat, which the mass containing it is was below the legal standard. Taking this as a rule, a difference an inferiority of a single carat or 1/24 part in the gold coins of the United States compared with the English standard would cause the same quantity of pure gold in them one of our coins to be worth nearly 4/10 ths ths per Cent less than in the coins of Great Britain. This circumstance would be likely in process of time to be felt in the market of the U States.  
A still greater depreciation of the Coin in the public opinion would be to be apprehended from the apparent debasement

With regard to the number of different pieces which shall compose the coins of the United States two things are to be consulted—convenience of circulation and cheapness of the coinage. The first ought not to be sacrificed to the last; but as far as they as they can be reconciled to with each other it is desireable to do it. Numerous and small (if not too minute) subdivisions assist circulation; but the multiplication of the smaller coins kinds increases adds to the expence of coining; the same process being necessary to a small as to a large piece.  
As it is easy to add, it will perhaps, be most adviseable to begin with a small number till experience shall decide whether when any other kinds species species proportions are necessary. The following it is conceived will be sufficient in the commencement—  
1 Gold piece equal in weight and value to ten Units or Dollars  
1 Gold piece, equal to a tenth part of the former, and which shall be a the a unit or Dollar  
1 Silver piece which shall also be the United a unit or Dollar  
1 silver piece which shall be in weight and value a tenth part of the silver Unit or Dollar.

1 other Copper piece which shall be of half the value of the former.  
It is not proposed, that the lightest of the two gold coins should be in the first instance numerous; as in large payments, the larger the pieces, the shorter the process of counting, the less the risk of mistake, and consequently the greater the safety and the convenience; and in small payments, it is not perceived that any inconvenience can accrue, except in the event of a scarcity of silver, which the relative from leaving an intire dependence on the silver and copper coins. The chief inducement to the establishment of the small gold pice is to have a sensible object, in that metal, as well as in silver, to express the unit. One hundred thousand may be as much as ought to be at any time in circulation.

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the

THE diffeience eflablilhed by cuftotn in the United States be  
tween coined gold and coined silver, has been ftatcd upon  
another occasion, to be neai iy as Ito 15.6 This, if truly the  
cafe, would imply that gold was extremely over-valued in the  
United States ; for the highest aflual proportion in any part of Eu­  
rope, very little, if at all, exceeds 1 to 15 ; and the average pro­  
portion throughout Europe is probably not more than about 1 to  
j 4 4-5. But that statement has proceeded upon the idea ot the  
ancient dollar. One penny-weight of gold of 22 cairats fine  
at 6s. Bd. and the old Seville piece of 386 grains and 15 tnites ot  
pure silver at 7s. 6d. turnifh the exatt ratio ot Ito 15.6262. But  
this does not coincide with the real difference between the metals,

 finenefs, but has been permitted to circulate by tale, without  
regard to either ; very much as a mere money of convenience; while gold has had a  
fixed price by weight ; and with an eye to its finenefs. This greater ftability of va  
Jue of the gold coins, is an argument of force for regarding the money unit as having  
been hitherto virtually attached to gold, rather than to filver.  
  
Twenty four grains and fix eighths of a grain of fine gold, have correfponded with  
the nominal value of the dollar in the feveral ftates ; without regard to the fucceflive  
diminutions of its intrinfic worth.  
  
But if the dollar hhould, notwithftanding, be fuppofed to have the beft title to be-  
ing confidered as the prefent unit in the coins, it would remain to determine what  
kind of dollar ought to be underftood, or, in other words, what precife quantity of  
fine filver.  
  
The old piaftre of Spain, which appearsto have regulated our foreign exchanges,  
weighed 17 dwt. 12 grains, and contained 386 grains and 15 mites of fine filver.  
  
But this piece has been long fince out of circulation. The dellars now in common  
currency are of recent date, and much inferior to that, both in weight and finenefs.  
The average weight of them, upon different trials in large maffes, has been found to  
be 17 dwts.$ grains. ‘Their finenefsis lefs precifely afcertained; the refults of vari-

it to that particular one, which is itfelf the leaft liable to variation; if there be, in  
this refpect; any difcernable difference between thie two.  
  
Gold may, perhaps, in certain fenfes, be faid to Kavé greater ability than filver :  
as being of fuperior value, lefs liberties have been taken with it, in thé regulatiens of  
different countries: Its ‘ftandard has remained more uniform, and it has, in other re-  
fpects, undergone fewer changes’: as being not*fo much an article of merchandize,  
owing to the ufe made’ of filver in the trade with the Eaft-Indies and China, it is lefs  
liable to be influenced by circumftances of commercial demand. And if reafoning by  
analogy, it could be affirmed, that there is&#x27;a phyfical probability of greater propor-  
tional increafe in the quantity of filver, than in that of gold, it would afford an addi-  
tional reafon for calculating on greater fteadinefs in the value of the latter.”  
  
As long as gold, either from its intrinfic fuperiority, as a metal, from its greater ra-  
rity, or from the prejudices of mankind, retains fo confiderable a pre-eminence in va-  
lue, over filver, as it has hitherto -had, ‘a natural conféquencte of this feems to be that

e between the value of coin and bullion than has been men-  
tioned. It will be better to have to increafe it hereafter, if this fhall be found expe-  
dient, than to have it to recede from too confidcrable a difference in confequence of  
evils, which fhall have been experienced.  
  
It is fometimes mentioned, asan expedient, which, confiftently with a free coinage,  
may ferve to prevent the evils defired to be avoided——to incorporate in the coins  
  
eater proportion of alloy than is ufual, regulating their value, neverthelefs, accord-  
ing to the quantitity of pure metal they contain. This it is fuppofed, by adding to  
the difficulty of refining them, would caufe bullion to be preferred both for manv-  
facture and exportation.  
  
But ftrong objections lie againft this fcheme :—An augmentation of expence }—an  
aGual depreciation of the coin ;—a danger of flill greater depreciation in the public  
opinion ;—the facilitating of counterfeits :—while it is queftionable, whether it weuld  
have the effect expecied from it. :  
  
The alloy being eftecmed of no value, an increafe of it is evidentiy an increafe of  
expence. ‘This, in relation to the gold coins particularly, is a matter of moment.  
It has been noted, that the alloy in them confifts partly of filver. If to avoid ex-  
pence the addition fhould be of copper only, this would fpoil the appearance of the  
coin, and give it a bafe countenance. Its beauty would indced be injured, though in  
a lefs degree, even if the ufual proportions of filver and copper fhould be maintain-  
ed in the increafed quantity of ailoy.  
  
And however inconfiderable an additional expenditure of copper in the coinage of  
a year may be deemed; ina feries of ycars it would become of confequence. In fe-  
gulations which contemplate the lapfe and operation of ages, a very {mall item of  
  
expemee acquires importance.

The actual depreciation of the coin, by an increafe of alloy, refults from the very  
circumftance which is the motive to it—the greater difficulty of refining. In En-  
gland, it is cuftomary for thofe concerned in manufactures of gold to make a deduc-  
tion in the price, of four pence fterling per ounce of fine gold, for every carrat  
which the mafs containing it is below the legal fandard. ‘Taking this as a rule, an  
inferiority of a fingle carrat or 1-24 part in the gold coins of the United Sates, com-  
  
ed with the Englith landard, would caufe the /eme quantity of pure gold in them  
to be worth nearly 4-10ths. per cent. lefs than in the coins of Great-j!ritain. ‘This  
cireumftance would be likely, in procefs of time, to be felt in the market of the U-  
nited States.  
  
A ftill greater depreciation, in the public opinion, would be to be apprehended from

In his o&gt;lebrot?&gt;d report oh the establishment of a mint,  
Hamilton considers among other things the propriety of a  
charge f&lt;r coinage. His review of the arguments on that  
subject i exceedingly able und thorough, and the con­  
clusions )f his mind are stated in the following words:  
&quot; L&#x27;nci-r an impression that a ?mall difference between the  
value ol the eoiu and the mint price of bullion is the least ex­  
ception i?le expedient for restraining the melting down or ex­  
port*ti n of the former, and not perceiving that if it be a very  
moderxe one it can be hurtful in other respects, the Secretary  
it incljied to au experiment of one-half per cent, on each of  
the mtuils. The fact which has been mentioned with regard  
to tbif price of gold bullion in the English market seems to  
demonstrate that such a difference may safely be made. In  
this fase there must be an immediate payment for the gold  
and (liver offered to the mint. How far one-half per cent,  
will go towards defraying the expense of the coinage cannot  
be determined beforehand with accuracy. It is presumed that  
on u economical plan it will suffice in relation to golcL llut  
it liaot expected that the name rate on silver will be sufficient  
to lefroy the expense attending that metal. Some additional  
prowaion may therefore be found necessary if this limit be  
adefted.

The resolution of the Congress of the Confederation, declaring the  
dollar to be the money unit of the United States, as well as that regulat-  
ing the value of it, had never been practically carried out, so that it was  
difficult to say what our money unit really was. The pound was the  
unit of accounts, while the old Spanish piasters or “ pieces of eight,”  
with their various values, regulated our exchanges. It was on this  
account that it seemed most natural that the dollar, containing a specified  
exact amount of pure silver, should be adopted as the unit in all cases.

of circulation, and cheapness of coinage. Numerous and small (if not too

kinds increases expense ; the same process being necessary to a small as to a

The following, it is conceived, will be sufficient in the commencement :  
  
One gold piece, equal in weight and value to ten units, or dollars.  
  
One gold piece, equal ¢o a tenth part of the former, and whith shall be a  
unit or dollar.  
  
One silver piece, which shall be a unit or dollar.  
  
One silver piece, which shall be, in weight and value, a tenth part of the

present value of gold, and the latter is within a small fraction of the  
mean of the two last emissions of [Spanish] dollars—the only ones  
which are now found in common circulation.”  
  
The questions before Congress, as enumerated by Hamil-  
ton in this report, were the following :  
  
1. As to the nature of the money unit  
  
2. As to the proportion between gold and silver, if coins  
of both metals were to be established

1. The amount of seigniorage  
  
5. The number, denomination, sizes and devices of the  
coins  
  
6. The currency of foreign coins.

of these questions was simply, That the law should recognize  
and endeavor to make permanent the conditions of the cur-  
rency existing at the time so far as the unit and the concur

mitted to circulate by tale, without  
regard to either, very much as a mere  
money of convenience, while gold has  
had a fixed price by weight, and with  
an eye to its fineness. This greater  
stability of value of the gold coins is  
an argument of force, for regarding  
the money unit as having been hitherto  
virtually attached to gold rather than  
to silver. Twenty-four grains and six­  
eighths of a grain of fine gold have

these coins Hamilton stated: ‘That species  
of coin has never had any settled or standard  
va&#x27;ue, according to weight or fineness, but has  
beén permitted to circulate by tale, without  
regard to either, very much asa mere money  
of convenience, while gold has had a fixed  
price by weight and with an eye to its fineness.  
This greater stability of value of the gold  
coins is an argument of force for regarding  
the money unit as having been hitherto virt-  
ually attached to gold rather than to silver,”  
And he added that ‘Twenty-four grains and  
six-eighths of a grain of fine gold have corre-  
sponded with the nominal valueof the (silver)  
doliar in the several States without regard to  
the successive diminutions of ita intrinsic  
worth.’’ Who can read this and continue to  
entertain the fallacious notion that the silver  
dollar was chosen as the unit of value for the  
money of the United States?

&quot;It is, however, not probable that the  
effect meditated (a change in ratio) would  
be defeated by a rise In prices propor­  
tioned to the dlmunltlon of the intrinsic  
value of the coins. This might be looked  
for in every enlightened commercial coun­  
try, but perhaps in none with greater cer­  
tainty than In this, because in none are  
men less liable to be the dupes of sound;  
in none has authority so little resource for  
substituting names for things.&quot;  
The promise of “rising prices,&quot; and  
“more money” when &quot;silver is free”  
catches the &quot;dupes of sound.” Hamilton  
foresaw the situation of the silver party  
of to-day. Again he says, and note it  
closely:  
&quot;A general revolution of prices (caused  
by degrading our money standard),  
though only nominally and In appearance,  
could not fail to distract the Ideas of the  
community, and would be apt to breed  
discontent, as well as among those who  
live on the Income of their money as  
among the poorer classes of the people,  
to whom the necessaries of life would  
seem to have become clearer.&quot;  
Again he say&#x27;s:  
&quot;Among the evils attendant on such an  
operation are these: Creditors both of  
the public and of individuals, would lose  
a part of their property; public and pri­  
vate debts would receive a wound; the  
effective revenues of the government  
would be diminished. There Is scarcely  
any point In the economy of national af­  
fairs of greater moment than tne uni­  
form preservation of the Intrinsic value  
of the money unit. On this the security  
and steady value of property essentially  
depend.”  
The great Daniel Webster said:  
&quot;There are some political evils which  
are seen as soon as they are dangerous,  
and which alarm at once as well the peo­  
ple as the government. Wars and meas­  
ures thereof are not always the most cer

uge to bring the metals together without In­  
creasing the sliver In n dollar.  
Rut the quantity of gold and silver In  
he national coins corresponding with a  
given Hum cnnnot be made less than hereto­  
fore without disturbing the balance of In-  
rlnslc value and making every acre of  
and , ns well as every bushel of wheat of  
actual less worth than In tlmo past. If the  
&#x27;lilted State ? were Isolated and cut off  
fiom all Intercourse with the rest or man­  
kind , this reasoning would not be equally  
conclusive. Hut It appears decisive whQti  
considered with n view to the relations  
which commerce has created between us  
nnd other countries.  
&quot;If said the blmetalllst. &quot;the United States  
were not sufficiently isolated In 1792 to cut  
oose from the world&#x27;s commercial standard ,  
low Is It In this age of steam and ocean  
cables ?  
&quot;Hamilton understood the sophistry of  
rising prices under such conditions , for he  
[ oes on to say :  
It la. however , not Improbable that the  
effect meditated would be defeated by a­  
rise In prices proportioned to the diminu­  
tion of the Intrinsic value of coins. This  
might be looked for In every enlightened  
commercial country , but perhaps In none  
with greater certainty than In this , because  
n none are men less liable to be the dupes  
of sounds ; In none has aulhoiity so little re­  
source for substituting names for things.  
&quot;Substituting names for things Is a very  
good description for nn act which would  
ironounce 50 cents worth of sliver to be a  
dollar. &quot; said Mr. Miller.  
&quot;I am not quite through with Hamilton , &quot;  
said the blmotalllrt. &quot;It Is hard to stop  
quoting from these men who discussed this  
subject so thoroughly 100 years ago. He  
goes on In the same connection :  
A general revolution In prices , though  
only nominally and In appearance , could not  
fail to distract the Ideas of the community  
and would be apt to breed discontent , ns  
well among those who live on the Income

preferred gold alone himself, and the Governe­

of both. Hamilton announced the great funda
