Sir,—  
  
York,  
30th Jan’y.  
1815.  
In your letter to a member of Congress recently published respecting the sale of your  
library,  
(* Note.) Monticello, 21st Sept. 1814.Dear Sir, “—I learn from  
the newspapers that the vandalism of our enemy has triumphed at Washington over  
science as well as the arts, by the destruction of the public library with the  
noble edifice in which it was deposited. Of this transaction, as that of  
Copenhagen, the world will entertain but one sentiment. They will see a nation  
suddenly withdrawn from a great war, full armed and full handed, taking  
advantage of another, whom they had recently forced into it; unarmed, and  
unprepared to indulge themselves in acts of barbarism which do not belong to a  
civilized age.”  
I perceive by the extract thereof underneath that you  
are angry with the British, for the destruction of the public buildings at  
Washington, and attempt with your accustomed candour to compare that  
transaction to the devastations committed by the barbarians in the middle ages.  
As you are not ignorant of the mode of carrying on the war, adopted by your  
friends, you must have known that this was a small retaliation after redress  
had been refused for burnings and depredations not only of public but private  
property committed by them in Canada; but we are too well acquainted with your  
hatred to Great Britain to look for truth or candour in any statement of yours,  
where she is concerned. It is not for your  
information, therefore, that I relate in this letter, those acts of the army of  
the United States in the Canadas, which provoked the conflagration of the  
public buildings at Washington, because you are well acquainted with them  
already; but to shew the world that to the United States and not to Great  
Britain must be charged all the miseries attending a mode of warfare,  
originating with them, and unprecedented in modern times.  
A stranger to the history of the last  
three years, on reading this part of your letter would naturally suppose that  
Great Britain in the pride of power had taken advantage of the weak and  
defenceless situation of the United States to wreak her vengeance upon them.  
But what would be his astonishment when told that the nation said to be unarmed  
and unprepared, had provoked and first declared the war, and carried it on  
offensively for two years, with a ferocity unexampled before the British had  
the means of making effectual resistance.—War was declared against Great  
Britain by the United States of America in June 1812. Washington was taken in  
August 1814. Let us see in what spirit your countrymen carried on the war  
during this interval.  
In July 1812,  
General Hull invaded the British province of Upper Canada, and took possession  
of the Town of Sandwich. He threatened (by a proclamation) to exterminate the  
inhabitants, if they made any resistance; he plundered those, with whom he had  
been in habits of intimacy for years before the war. Their plate and linen were  
found in his possession after his surrender to General Brock. He marked out the  
Loyal subjects of the King, as objects of peculiar resentment, and consigned  
their property to pillage and conflagration. In autumn 1812  
some thousand barns were burnt by the American forces near  
Fort Erie in Upper Canada.  
In April  
1813; the public buildings at York, the capital of Upper Canada, were burnt by  
the troops of the United States, contrary to the articles of capitulation. They  
consisted of two elegant Halls with convenient offices, for the accommodation  
of the Legislature, &amp; of the Courts of Justice. The library and all the  
papers and records belonging to these institutions were consumed at the same  
time the Church was robbed, and the Town Library totally pillaged. Commodore  
Chauncey, who has generally behaved honourably, was so ashamed of this last  
transaction, that he endeavoured to collect the books belonging to the Public  
Library, and actually sent back two boxes filled with them, but hardly any were  
complete. Much private property was plundered, and several houses left in a  
state of ruin; can you tell me, sir, the reason why the public buildings and  
library at Washington, should be held more sacred than those at York? A false  
and ridiculous story is told of a scalp having been found above the Speakers  
Chair intended as an ornament.  
In  
June 1813, Newark came into the possession of your army (after the capture of  
Fort George) and its inhabitants were repeatedly promised protection to  
themselves and property, both by General Dearborn and General Boyd. In the midst of these professions, the most  
respectable of them altho’ non combattants, were made prisoners, and sent into  
the United States. The two churches  
were burnt to the ground; detachments were sent under the direction of British  
traitors to pillage the Loyal Inhabitants in the neighborhood, and to carry  
them away captive. Many farm houses were burnt during the summer, and at length  
to fill up the measure of iniquity, the whole of the beautiful village of  
Newark, with so short a previous intimation as to amount to none was consigned  
to the Flames. The wretched inhabitants had scarcely time to save themselves,  
much less any of their property. More than four hundred Women and Children were  
exposed without shelter on the night of the tenth of December, to the intense  
cold of a Canadian winter, and great numbers must have perished, had not the  
flight of your troops after perpetrating this ferocious act, enabled the  
inhabitants of the country to come in to their relief.  
Your friend Mr. Madison has attempted to  
justify this cruel deed, on the plea that it was necessary for the defence of  
Fort George. Nothing can be more false. The village was some distance from the  
Fort; and instead of thinking to defend it, General M’Clure was actually  
retreating to his own shore, when he caused Newark to be burnt. This officer  
says that he acted in conformity with the orders of his government; the  
government finding their justification useless disavow his conduct; M’Clure  
appears to be the fit agent of such a government. He not only complies with his  
instructions but refines upon them by choosing a day of intense frost, giving  
the inhabitants almost no warning till the fire began, and commencing the  
conflagration in the night as above mentioned.  
In Nov. 1813, the army of your friend  
General Wilkinson committed great depredations in its progress through the  
eastern district of Upper Canada, and was proceeding to systematic pillage,  
when the commander got frightened, and fled to his own shore, on finding the  
population in that district inveterately hostile.  
  
The history of the two first campaigns  
prove beyond dispute, that you had reduced fire and pillage to a regular  
system. It was hoped, that the severe retaliation taken for the burning of  
Newark, would have put a stop to a practice so repugnant to the manners and  
habits of a civilized age; but so far was this from being the case, that the  
third campaign exhibits equal enormities. Gen. Brown laid waste the country  
between Chippawa and Fort Erie, burning mills and private houses and rendering  
those not consumed by fire uninhabitable. The pleasant village of St. David,  
was burnt by his army when about to retreat.  
On the 15th May, a detachment of the  
American army, under Colonel Campbell, landed at Long Point, district of  
London, Upper Canada and on that and the following day, pillaged and laid waste  
as much of the adjacent country as they could reach. They burnt the village of  
Dover, with the mills, and all the mills, stores, distilleries, and dwelling  
houses in the vicinity, carrying away such property as was portable, and  
killing the cattle. The property taken and destroyed on this occasion, was  
estimated at fifty thousand dollars.  
On the 16th of August, some American  
troops and Indians from Detroit, surprised the settlement of Port Talbot, where  
they committed the most  
atrocious acts of violence, leaving upwards of 234 men,  
women, and children, in a state of nakedness and want.  
On the 20th of September, a second  
excursion was made by the garrison of Detroit, spreading fire and pillage  
through the settlements in the Western district of Upper Canada. Twenty seven  
families were reduced on this occasion to the greatest distress..… Early in  
Nov. Gen. McArthur, with a large body of mounted Kentuckians and Indians, made  
a rapid march through the Western, &amp; part of the London districts, burning  
all the mills, and destroying provisions, and living upon the inhabitants. If  
there was less private plunder than usual, it was, because the invaders had no  
means of carrying it away.  
On our  
part, sir, the war has been carried on in the most forbearing manner. During  
the two first campaigns, we abstained from any acts of retaliation,  
notwithstanding the great enormities which we have mentioned. It was not till  
the horrible destruction of Newark, attended with so many acts of atrocity,  
that we burnt the villages of Lewiston, Buffaloe, and Black Rock. At this our  
Commander paused. He pledged himself to proceed no farther, on the condition of  
your returning to the rules of legitimate warfare. Finding you pursuing the  
same system this last campaign, instead of destroying the towns and villages  
within his reach, to which he had conditionally extended his protection, he  
applied to Admiral Cochrane to make retaliation  
upon the coast. The Admiral informed Mr Monroe of the nature of this  
application, and his determination to comply, unless compensation was made for  
the private property wantonly destroyed in Upper Canada. No answer was returned  
for several weeks, during which time Washington was taken. At length, a letter  
purporting to be an answer, arrived, in which the Secretary dwells, with much  
lamentation, on the destruction of the public buildings at Washington; which  
notwithstanding the destruction of the same kind of buildings at the capital of  
Upper Canada, he affects to consider without a parallel in modern times. So  
little regard has he for truth, that at the very moment of his speaking of the  
honor and generosity practised by his government in conducting the war, General  
McArthur was directed by the President to proceed upon his burning  
excursion.  
Perhaps you will bring  
forward the report of the Committee appointed by Congress to inquire into  
British cruelties, and to class them under the heads furnished by Mr Madison,  
as an offset for the facts that have been mentioned. The committee must have  
found the subject extremely barren, as only one report has seen the light: but  
since the articles of accusation are before the public, and have been quoted by  
the enemies of England, as capable of ample proof, let us give them a brief  
examination.  
1st. Ill treatment of  
American prisoners.  
2d. Detention of  
American prisoners as British subjects, under the pretext of their being born  
on British territory, or of naturalization.  
3d. Detention of sailors as prisoners,  
because they were in England when war was declared.  
4th. Forced service of American sailors,  
pressed on board English men of war.  
5th. Violence of flags of truce.  
6th. Ransom of American prisoners taken  
by the savages in the service of England.  
7th. Pillage and destruction of private  
property in the bay of Chesapeake, and the neighbouring country.  
8th. Massacre of American prisoners  
surrendered to the officers of Great Britain, by the savages engaged in its  
service. Abandoning to the savages the corpses of American prisoners killed by  
the English, into whose hands they had been surrendered; pillage and murder of  
American citizens, who had repaired to the English under the assurance of their  
protection; the burning of their houses.  
9th. Cruelties exercised at Hampton in  
Virginia.  
  
1st. Ill treatment of American prisoners.  
General Brock sent all the militia taken  
at Detroit home on their parole, accompanied by a guard to protect them from  
the Indians, detaining only the regulars, whom he sent to Quebec, where they  
met with the most liberal treatment, as the honest among them have frequently  
confessed. General Sheaffe acted in the same manner after the battle of  
Queenston, keeping the regulars &amp; dismissing the militia on their parole.  
Nor was the liberal course departed from, till the gross misconduct of the  
American government, in liberating, without exchange, those so sent home, and  
in carrying away non-combatants, and seizing the whole inhabitants of the  
districts, which they invaded, rendered it absolutely necessary.  
When they were not able to take all the  
unarmed inhabitants away they made those they left sign a parole, a conduct  
never known in the annals of war, the conditions of which not only precluded  
them from afterwards bearing arms, but from giving in any manner their  
services to government. The farmers were dragged  
out of their houses and carried into the States. Clergymen were forced to give  
their parole, in fine it appeared to make no difference, whether a man was in  
arms or not, he was sure to experience the same treatment.  
Many people, when prisoners, have been  
treated in the most infamous manner. Officers, tho’ sick and wounded have been  
forced to march on foot through the country, while American officers taken by  
us were conveyed in boats or carriages to the place of destination.  
Our captured troops have been marched as  
spectacles through the towns, altho’ you affect to complain of Hull’s and other  
prisoners being marched publicly into Montreal. The officers of the 41st regt.  
were confined in the Penetentiary at Kentucky among Felons of the most infamous  
description. They were treated with harshness; often with cruelty, and persons,  
who wished to be kind to them, were insulted by the populace.  
Even the stipulations, respecting  
Prisoners, agreed to by the American Government, have been most shamefully  
broken. Sir George Prevost and Mr. Madison agreed that all prisoners taken  
before the 15th day of April 1814 should be exchanged on or before the 15th day  
of May last to be conveyed into their respective countries by the nearest  
routes. On that day the Governor in Chief faithful to his engagements, sent  
home every American prisoner; but the Government of the United States seemed  
for a long time to have totally forgotten the stipulation. A few Prisoners were  
sent back in June, but many of the officers and all the soldiers of the 41st  
Regiment were detained till towards the end of October. To the soldiers of this  
Regiment (as indeed to all others) every temptation had been presented to  
induce them to desert and enlist in their service by money, land &amp;c. After  
it was found impossible to persuade any number of them to do so, the American  
government encamped them for nearly two months in a pestilential marsh near  
Sandusky without any covering. There having neither shelter nor the necessary  
quantity of provisions, they all got sick, many died, and in October, the  
remainder were sent to Long Point, sick, naked and miserable. From this place  
they could not be conveyed, till clothes had been sent to cover their  
nakedness; great numbers sunk under their calamities and the utmost care and  
attention were required to save any of them alive. Such an accumulation of  
cruelty was never exhibited before.  
The government of the United States assumed the  
prerogative of relieving officers from parole without exchanging them, and even  
Commodore Rodgers took twelve seamen out of a cartel, as it was proceeding to  
Boston Bay and was justified for this outrage by his government.  
2d.  
Detention of American Prisoners as British  
Subjects.  
It is notorious  
that a great many of the American army have been British subjects since the  
commencement of the war, and had we determined to punish these traitors with  
death, if found invading our territories, and after giving them warning, acted  
up to such a determination, it would have been strictly right and in such case  
very few would have entered Canada. While these persons act merely as Militia  
defending their adopted country against invasion, some lenity might be shewn  
them; but when they march into the British Provinces for the sake of conquest,  
they ought to be considered Traitors to their King and Country and treated  
accordingly.  
3d.—Detention of Sailors as Prisoners,  
because they were in England when war was declared.  
This accusation is ridiculous, as sailors  
are always considered in the first class of combatants, but it comes with an  
ill grace from those who have detained peaceable British subjects engaged in  
civil life, and banished fifteen miles from the coast, those of them who  
happened to be in America at the declaration of war, and treated them almost in  
every respect like Prisoners of war, according to Bonaparte’s example.  
4. Forced service of  
American Sailors pressed on board of English Men of war.  
This accusation has been often made, but  
never coupled with the offer of Mr. Foster to discharge every American so  
detained on being furnished with the list. The list was never furnished.  
5. Violence of Flags  
of Truce.  
This accusation of  
Mr. Madison contains about as much truth as those that have been already  
examined. We shall give two examples of  
the treatment experienced by the Bearers of Flags of Truce from the British  
Army.  
Major Fulton, Aid-de-Camp to  
General Sir George Prevost, was stopped by Major Forsyth of the United States  
army at the outposts, who insulted him most grossly, endeavored to seize his  
despatches and threatened to put him to death. So much ashamed were Forsyths superiors at this  
outrage, that he was sent for a short time, to the rear.  
General Proctor sent Lieut. Le Breton to  
General Harrison after the battle of Moravian Town to ascertain our loss of  
officers and men; but instead of sending him back, General Harrison detained  
him many weeks, took him round the Lake; and after all did not furnish him with  
the required information, which had been otherwise procured in the mean  
time.  
6. Ransom  
of American prisoners taken by the savages in the service of  
England.  
Some nations of the  
Natives were at war with the Americans, long before hostilities commenced  
against England, many others not. When attempts were made to conquer the  
Canadas, the Indians beyond our territories, part by choice and part by  
solicitation came and joined us as Allies, while those within the Provinces,  
had as great an interest in defending them, as the other proprietors of the  
soil. To mitigate as much as possible the horrors of war, it was expressly and  
repeatedly told the Indians that scalping the dead &amp; killing Prisoners or  
unresisting enemies, were practices extremely repugnant to our feelings, and no  
presents would be given them, but for Prisoners. This, therefore instead of  
becoming an article of accusation ought to have excited their gratitude, for  
the presence and authority of a British force uniformly tended to secure the  
lives of all who were defenceless,  
and all who surrendered—It almost without exception saved  
the lives of our enemies, yet the American government brand us as worse than  
savages, for fighting by the sides of Indians, and at first threatened our  
extermination if we did so, altho’ they employed all the Indians they could.  
Many individuals have acknowledged their obligation to us for having been saved  
by the benevolent &amp; humane exertions of our officers &amp; troops, but no  
officer of rank ever had the justice to make a public acknowledgment. The  
eighth accusation is much the same as this, and must have been seperated in  
order to multiply the number of articles. It is notorious that some British  
soldiers have been killed by the Indians, protecting their prisoners. This was  
the case at General Winchester’s defeat and at General Clay’s. The grossest  
exaggerations have been published. General Winchester was declared in all the  
American papers to have been scalped, and mangled in the most horrid manner,  
when he was in his quarters at  
Quebec. In a General Order dated  
Kingston 26th July, 1813, among other things respecting Indians, it is said  
that the head money for the Prisoners of War, brought in by the Indian warriors  
is to be immediately paid by the Commissariat, upon the certificate of the  
General officer commanding the division with which they are acting at the time.  
Let us now see how the poor Indians are treated by the Americans, after  
promising that they have done their utmost to employ as many Indians as  
possible against us. It is a fact that the first scalp taken this war was by  
the Americans at the river Canard between Sandwich and Amherstburgh. At this  
place an Indian was killed by the advance of General Hull’s army, and  
immediately scalped.  
(Note)* An  
Indian never scalps his enemy until  
after he is dead, and does so to preserve a proof  
or token of his victory.  
  
At the skirmish of Brownston several  
Indians fell and were scalped by the American troops.  
The Kentuckians are commonly armed with a  
Tomahawk and long scalping knife, and burnt Indians as a pastime.  
At the river Au Raisin, Capt. Caldwell of  
the Indian department, saved an American officer from the Indians, and as he  
was leading him off, the ungrateful  
monster stabbed him in the neck, on which he was killed by Captain Caldwell’s  
friends.  
The American troops under  
General Winchester killed an Indian in a skirmish near the river Au Raisin, on  
the 18th January 1813, and tore him literally into pieces, which so exasperated the Indians  
that they refused burial to the Americans killed on the 22d.—The Indian Hero  
Tecumseth after being killed was literally flayed in part by the Americans and  
his skin carried off as a trophy.  
Twenty Indian women and children of the Kickapoo nation  
were inhumanly put to death by the Americans a short time ago near Prairie on  
the Illinois river, after driving their  
husbands into a morass where they perished with cold and hunger. Indian towns  
were burnt as an amusement or common place practice. All this however is  
nothing compared to the recent massacre of the Creeks. General Coffee in his  
letter to General Jackson dated 4th November 1813, informs him that he  
surrounded the Indian Towns at Tullushatches in the night with nine hundred  
men. That about an hour after sunrise,  
he was discovered by the enemy, who endeavored tho’ taken by surprise to make  
some resistance. In a few minutes the  
last warrior of them was killed. He mentions the number of warriors seen dead to  
be 186 and supposes as many among the weeds as would make them up two hundred.  
He confesses that some of the women and children were killed, owing to the  
warriors mixing with their families. He mentions taking only 84 Prisoners of Women and  
Children. Now it is evident that in a  
village containing two hundred  
warriors, there must have been nearly as  
many women and men perhaps more; and unquestionably the number of children exceeded the  
men and women together; what then became of all these.  
Neither does General Coffee mention the old men. Such things speak for  
themselves. The poor Indians fought it  
appears, with bows and arrows, and were able only to kill five Americans. Their  
situation was too remote for them to receive assistance from the British. Their  
lands were wanted and they must be exterminated. Since this period, the greater  
part of the nation has been massacred by General Jackson, who destroyed them  
wantonly in cold blood. There was no resistance, if we except individual  
ebullition of despair, when it was found that there was no mercy. Jackson  
mentions exultingly that the morning after he had destroyed a whole village,  
sixteen Indians were discovered, hid under the bank of the river, who were  
dragged out and murdered; upon these inhuman exploits President Madison only  
remarks to Congress that the Creeks had received a salutary chastisement which  
would make a lasting impression upon their fears. The cruelties exercised  
against these wretched nations are without a parallel except the coldness and  
apathy with which they are glossed over by the President. Such is the conduct  
of the humane government of the United States, which is incessantly employed as  
they pretend in civilizing the Indians; but it is time to finish this horrid  
detail we shall therefore conclude with a short extract of a letter from the  
Spanish Governor of East Florida, Benigno Garzia, to Mr. Mitchell Governor of  
the State of Georgia to show that the policy of the Government of the United  
States in regard to the Indians is now generally known.  
“The Province of East Florida may be  
invaded in time of profound peace, the planters ruined, and the population of  
the capital starved, and according to your doctrine all is fair; they are a set  
of outlaws if they resist. The Indians are to be insulted threatened &amp;  
driven from their lands; if they resist, nothing less than extermination is to  
be their fate.”  
7th &amp; 9th.—Pillage and destruction of private property in the Bay of  
Chesapeake and the neighboring country, and cruelties exercised in Hampton in  
Virginia.  
It required  
astonishing effrontery to make these articles of accusation, after the  
depredations and cruelties committed by the army of the United States in the  
Canadas.  
In the attack upon Craney  
Island, some boats in the service of Great Britain ran aground. In this  
situation they made signals of surrender, but the Americans continued to fire  
upon them from the shore. Many jumped into the water and swam towards land, but  
they were shot, as they approached, without mercy. A few days after, Hampton  
was taken and some depredations were committing by the Foreign troops, who had  
seen some of their comrades so cruelly massacred, but before any material  
damage was done, they were remanded on board. Several letters from Hampton  
mention the behaviour of the British, while there, as highly meritorious, and  
contradict the vile calumnies of the Democratic prints, which Mr. Madison  
copies in his Message to Congress.  
This brief account of the conduct of your Govt. and army  
since the commencement of hostilities (which might have been greatly extended)  
will fill the world with astonishment at the forbearance of Great Britain in  
suffering so many enormities and such a determined departure from the laws of  
civilized warfare, to pass so long without signal punishment.  
Before finishing this letter, permit me,  
Sir, to remark that the destruction of the public buildings at Washington,  
entitled the British to your gratitude and praise by affording you a noble  
opportunity of proving your devotion to your country. In former times, when you  
spoke of the magnitude of your services and the fervor of your patriotism, your  
political enemies were apt to mention your elevated situation, and the  
greatness of your salary. But by presenting your library a freewill offering to  
the nation at this moment of uncommon pressure, when the Treasury is empty, and  
every help to the acquisition of knowledge is so very necessary to keep the  
government from sinking, you would have astonished the world, with one solitary  
action in your political life, worthy of commendation.  
Nor are your obligations to the British  
army unimportant, tho’ you have not aspired to generous praise. An opportunity has been given you of  
disposing of a library at your own price, which if sold volume by volume, would have fetched  
nothing, You have no doubt seen that old libraries do not sell well, after the  
death of the proprietor, and with a lively attention to your own interest, you  
take advantage of the times. I am, Sir, with due consideration,  
&amp;c.  
  
  
JOHN STRACHAN, D. D.  
  
  
Treasurer of the Loyal and Patriotic Society of  
Upper-Canada.  
  
  
  
  
POSTSCRIPT.—–From General M’Arthur’s  
official account of his predatory excursion, I make the following extract to  
prove his extraordinary veracity  
“We were thus enabled to arrive at the  
town of Oxford, one hundred and fifty miles distant from Detroit, before the  
inhabitants knew that a force was approaching. They were promised protection to  
their persons and property, upon the condition that they remained peaceably at  
their respective homes; otherwise, they were assurred, that their property  
would be destroyed.  
However, notwithstanding this injunction, and the sacred obligation  
of a previous parole, two of the inhabitants escaped to Burford with the  
intelligence of our arrival. Their property consisting of two dwelling houses,  
two barns, and one shop, were instantly consumed.”  
George Nichol and Jacob Wood, are the  
persons here alluded to, both of whom applied to the Loyal and Patriotic  
Society of Upper Canada for relief. The former had returned home before General  
M’Arthur’s report to the Secretary at War appeared in the Newspapers: but the  
latter was at York after that publication. “At a meeting of the Directors of  
the Loyal and Patriotic Society holden at York on the 21st of January 1815, appeared Jacob  
Wood, from the County of Oxford, and produced a certificate from Major Bowen,  
stating that he accompanied George Nichol from Oxford to Burford to give  
information of the advance of the American army, and in consequence of which  
his House, Furniture, Barn, Hay, Grain, Joiner’s shop and Tools were destroyed  
by the enemy.  
Jacob Wood was interrogated by the Society, whether he or George  
Nichol were paroled by General M’Arthur, previous to their giving the British  
warning of the approach of the American army. In answer, he stated, that he and  
George Nichol had left their homes on hearing of the approach of the enemy, and  
were so far from giving their parole that they never were in the power of  
General M’Arthur, or his Army.  
The Directors put this question to  
Jacob Wood, because General M’Arthur, in his official report, states it as his  
reason for burning the houses, and destroying every thing belonging to these  
two men, that they had broken their parole.”  
  
General M’Arthur had some reputation  
to lose, and ought to have known that such a gross departure from truth was not  
the way to preserve it. The courage and zeal of Nichol and Wood, instead of  
punishment, deserved and would have obtained the respect of a gallant and  
generous enemy. But on all occasions, the loyal inhabitants of this Province  
have been selected by your Generals as the objects of their peculiar  
hatred.  
To pass rapidly, with a large body of cavalry, through a country  
thinly inhabited, and without the means of resistance, to feed upon the  
defenceless inhabitants; to burn the mills, none of which belonged to  
Government, and to destroy the provisions and the whole property of respectable  
men of principle; and then to run away, at the first symptom of serious  
opposition; is no great exploit. General M’Arthur has been the Author of much  
distress to the defenceless inhabitants; many of whom have now One Hundred and  
Twenty Miles to go to mill, but in a military point of view he has done  
nothing. It is for the people of the United States to reflect seriously upon  
this mode of carrying on the war; and it is your interest, Sir, to advise a  
return to humanity, lest Monticello should share the fate of hundreds of Farms  
in Upper Canada.I am,

a sergeant in the British service, who was proceeding  
  
to Burlington, with the information that the detach-

eapture of this sergeant at the commencement of  
the “Long Woods,” between the Moravian towm  
  
and Delaware, enabled us to reach the latter place  
undiscovered. On our approach the rangers were  
detached to move across the Thames below the set-

were engaged in swimming their hoses and trans-  
porting their bugrage on rafts.  
  
We were thus enabled to arrive at the town of  
Oxford, one hundred and fifty miles distant from  
Detroit, before the inhabitants knew that a force

to their persons and property, upon condition that  
they remained peaceably at thcir respective homes ;

However, notwithstanding this injunction and

In your letter to a member of Congress recently published, respecting  
the sale of your library,&quot; I perceive by the extract thereof underneath,  
that you are angry with the British, for the destruction of the public  
buildings at Washington, and attempt with your accustomed candour  
to compare that transaction to the devastations committed by the  
barbarians in the middle ages. As you are not ignorant of the mode  
of carrying on the war, adopted by your friends, you must have known  
that this was a smull retaliation after redress had been refused for  
burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property,  
committed by them in Canada: but we are too well acquainted with  
your hatred to Great Britain to look for truth or candeur in any  
statesman of your&#x27;s, where she isconcerned. It is not for your infor-  
mation, therefore, that | relate in this letter, those acts of the army of  
the United States in the Canadas, waich provoked the conflagration of  
the public buildings at Washington, because you are well acquainted  
with them already ; but to shew the world that to the United States,  
and not to Great Britain, must be charged all the miseries attending  
amode of warfare, originating with them, and unprecedented in  
modern times.  
  
A stranger to the history of the last three years, on reading this part  
of your letter, would naturally suppose that Great Britain in the pride  
of power had taken advantage of the weak and defenceless situation  
of the United States to wreak her vengeance upon them. But what  
would be his astonishment when told, that the nation said to be  
unarmed and unprepsred, bad provoked and first declared the war,  
and carried it on offensively for two years, with a ferocity unexampled,  
before the British had the means of making effectual resistance—  
War was declared against Great Britain by the United States of  
America in June 1812. Washington was taken in August 1814,  
Let us see in what spirit your countrymen carriedon the war during  
this interval.  
  
In July 1812.—General Holl invaded the British province of Upper  
Canada. and took possession of the Town of Sandwich. He threatened  
(by a proclamation) to exterminate the inhabitants, if they made any  
resistance ; he plundered those with whom he had been in habits of

“« Monticello, 21st Sept. 1814.  
«¢* (1)—Dear Sir,—lI learn from the newspapers that the van-  
dalism of our enemy has triumphed at Washington over science as  
well as the arts, by the destruction of the public library, with the noble  
edifice in which it was disposed. Of this transaction, as that of  
Copenhagen, the world will éntertain but one sentiment. They will  
see a nation suddenly withdrawn from a great war, full armed and  
full handed, taking advintage of another, whom they ‘ad recently  
forced into it ; unarmed, and unprepared to indulge themselves in acts  
of barbarism which do not belong toa civilized age.”

intimacy for years before the war. Their plate and linen were foupd  
in his possession after his surrender to General Brock. He marked  
out the Loyal subjects of the King, as objects of peculiar resentment,  
and consigned their property to pillage and conflagration. In autumn  
1812, a number of houses and barns were burnt by the American  
forces near Fort Erie, Upper Canada.  
  
In April 1813, the public buildings at York, the capital of Upper  
Canada, were burnt by the troops of the United States, contrary to the  
articles of capitulation. They consisted of two elegant Halls, with  
convenient offices for the accommodation of the Legislature, and  
of the Courts of Justice. The library andall the papers and records  
belonging to these institutions were consumed, at the same time the  
Church was robbed, and the Town Library totally pillaged. Come  
modore Chauncey, who has generally behaved honourably, was so  
ashamed of this last transaction, that he endeavoured to collect the  
books belonging to the Public Library, and actually sent back two  
boxes filled with them, but hardly any were complete. Much private  
property was plundered, and several houses left in a state of ruin;  
cap you tell me, Sir, the reason why the public buildings and library  
at Washington, should be held more sacredthan those at York? A  
false and ridiculous story is told of a scalp having been found above  
the Speaker&#x27;s Chair, intended as an oraament.  
  
In June 1813, Newark came into the possession of your army,  
(after the capture of Fort George) and its inhabitants were repeatedly  
promised protection to themselves and property, both by Gen, Dear-  
born and Gen. Boyd. In the midst of these professions, the most  
respectable of them, although non-combatants, were made prisoners,  
and sent into the United States. ‘The two churches were burnt to  
the ground ; detachments were‘sent, under the direction of British  
traitors, to pillage the Loyal inhabitants in the neighbourhood, and to  
carry them away captive. Many farm-houses were burnt during the  
summer, and at length, to fill up the measure of iniquity, the whole of  
the beautiful village of Newark, with so short a previous intimation as  
to amount to none, was consigned to the flames. The wretched  
inhabitants bad scarcely time to save themselves, much less any of  
their property. More than four hundred women and children were  
exposed, without shelter, on the night of the tenth of December, to the  
intense cold of a Canadian winter, and great numbers must kaye  
perished, had not the flight of your troops, after perpetrating this fero-  
cious act, enabled the inhabitants of the country to come in to their relief.  
  
. Your friend Mr. Maddison has attempted to justify this cruel deed,  
on the plea that it was necessary for the defence of Fort George.  
Nothing can be more false. The village was some distance from the  
&#x27; Fort; and instead*of thinking to defend it, Gen, M*‘Clure was  
actually retreating to his own shore, when he caused Newark to be  
burnt. This officer says that be acted in conformity with the orders  
of his government; the government finding their justification  
useless, disavowed his conduct ; M‘Clure appears to be the fit  
agent of such a government. He not only complies with his  
instructions, but refines vpon them by choosing a day of intense

and commencing the conflagration in the night as above men-

In Nov, 1813, the army of your friend Gen, Wilkinson committed  
great depredations in its progress through the eastern district of Upper  
Canada, and was proceeding to systematic pillage, when the com-  
mahder got frightened, and fled to his own shore, on finding the  
population in that district inveterately hostile.  
  
The history of the two first campaigns prove beyond dispute, that  
you had reduced fire and pillage to a regular system. It was hoped,  
that the severe retaliation taken for the burning of Newark, would  
have put a stop to a practice so repugnant to the manners and _ habits  
of a civilized age; but sofar was this from being the case, that the  
third campaign exhibits equal enormities. Gen. Brown laid waste the  
country between Chippawa and Fort Erie, burning mills and private  
houses, and rendering those not consumed by fire uninhabitable. The  
pleasant village of St. David, was burnt by his army when about to  
retreat.  
  
On the 15th May, a detachment of the American army, under  
Colonel] Campbell, landed at Long Point, district of London, Upper  
Canada, and on that and the following day, pillaged and laid waste as  
much of the adjacent country as they could reach.. They burnt the  
village of Dover, with the mills, and all the mills, stores, distil-  
Jeries, and dwelling houses in the vicinity, ¢arrying away such pro-  
perty as was portable, and killing the cattle. The property taken  
and destroyed on this occasion, was estimated at fifty thousand dollars,  
  
On the 16th of August, some American troops and Indians from  
Detroit, surprised the settlement of Port Talbot, where they com-  
mitted the most atrocious acts of violence, leaving upwards  
of 234 men, women, and children, in a state of nakedness and want.  
  
On the 20th of September, a second excursion was made by the  
garrison of Detroit, spreading fire and pillage through the settlements  
inthe Western district of Upper Canada. Twenty-seven families  
were reduced on this occasion to the greatest distress. Early in  
Nov. Gen, Mc Arthur, with a large body of mounted Kentuckians  
and Indians, made a rapid march through the Western and part of  
the London districts, burning all the mills, and destroying provisions,  
and living upon the inhabitants. If there was less private plunder  
than usual, it was because the invaders had no means of carrying  
it away.  
  
On our part, Sir, the war has been carried on in the most forbearing  
manner, During the two first campaigns, we abstained from any  
acts of retaliation, notwithstanding the great enormities which we  
have mentioned. It was not till the horrible destruction of Newark,  
attended with so many acts of atrocity, that we burnt the villages of  
Lewishton, Buftaloe, and Black Rock. At this our Commander  
paused. He pledged himself to proceed no farther, on the condition  
of your returning to the rules of legitimate warfare. Finding you  
pursuing the same system this last campaign, instead of destroying the  
towns and villages within bis reach, to which he had conditionally

retaliation upon the coast. The Admiral: informed Mr. Monroe of  
the nature of this application, and his determination to comply, unless  
compensation was made for the private property wantonly destroyed  
in Upper Canada. No answer was returned for several weeks,  
during which time Washington was taken. At length, a letter, pur-  
porting to be an answer, arrived, in which the Secretary dwells, with  
much Jamentation, on the destruction of the public buildings at Wash-  
ington ; which, notwithstanding the destruction of the same kind of  
buildings at the capital of Upper Canada, he affects to consider  
without a parallel in modern times. So little regard has he for trath,  
that at the very moment of his speaking of the honor and generosity  
practised by his government in conducting the war, General Me  
Arthur was directed by the President to proceed upon his burning  
excursion.  
  
Perhaps you will bring forward the report of the Committee appoint-  
ed by Congress to inquire into British cruelties, and to class them  
under the heads furnished by Mr. Madison, as an offset for the facts  
that have been mentioned. The committee must have found the  
subject extremely barren, as only, one report has seen the Jight:  
but since the articles of accusation are before the public, and have  
been quoted by the enemies of England, as capable of ample proof,  
let us give them a brief examination.

till the gross misconduct of the American government, in liberating,  
without exchange, those so sent home, and carrying away non-com-  
batants, and seizing the whole inhabitants of the districts, which they  
invaded, rendered it absolutely necessary.  
  
When they were not able to take all the unarmed inbabitants away,  
they made those they left sign a parole, a conduct never known in the  
annals of war, the conditions of which not only precluded them from  
afterwards bearing arms, but from giving in any manner their services

carried into the States. Clergymmen were forced to give them parole,  
in fine it appeared to make no difference, whether a man was in arms  
or not, he was sure to expericnce the same treatment.  
  
Many people, when prisoners, have been treated in the most in-  
famous manner. Officers, though sick and wounded, have been forced  
to march on foot through the country, while American officers, taken  
by us, were conveyed in boats or carriages to the place of destina-  
tion.  
  
Our captured troops have been marched as spectacles through the  
towns, although you affect to complain of Hull&#x27;s and other prisoners  
being marched publicly into Montreal. The officers of the 4ist  
regt. were confined in the Penitentiary at Kentucky, among felons of  
the most infamous description, They were treated with harshness ;  
often with cruelty, and persons who wished to be kind to them, were  
insulted by the populace.  
  
iven the stipulations, respecting prisoners, agreed to by the Ame-  
rican Government, have been most shamefully broken, Sir George  
Prevost and Mr. Madison agreed that all prisoners taken before the  
15th day of April 1814, should be exchanged on or before the 15th  
day of May last, tobe conveyed into their respective countries by the  
nearest routes.—On that day the Governor in Chief, faithful to his  
engagements, sent home every American prisoner: but the Govern-  
ment of the United States seemed for a long time to have totally for-  
gotten the stipulation,  
  
A few prisoners were sent back in June, but many of the officers  
and all the soldiers of the dist regt. were detained till towards the  
end of October. To the soldiers of this Regiment (as indeed toall  
others) every temptation had been presented to induce them to desert  
and enlist,in their service by money, land, &amp;c. After it was found  
impossibleto persuade any number of them to do so, the American  
government encamped them for nearly two months in a pestilential  
marsh near Sandusky, without any covering.--*There having neither  
shelter nor the necessary quantity of provisions, they all got sick,  
many died, and in October, the remainder were sent to Long Point,  
sick, naked, and miserable. From this place they could not be con-  
veyed, till clothes had been sent to cover their nakedness; great  
numbers sunk under their calamities, and the utmost care and atten-  
tion were required \o save any of them alive. Such an accumulation  
ef cruelty was never exhibited before.  
  
  
  
  
  
Conduct of the Americans. 65)  
  
The government of the United States assumed the prerogative of  
telieving officers from parole without exchanging them, and even  
Commodore Rodgers took twelve seamen out of a cartel, as it was  
proceeding to Boston Bay, and was justified for this outrage by his  
government.  
  
Second. Detention of dmerican Prisoners as British Subjects.  
  
It is notorious, that a great many of the American army have  
been British subjects, since the commencement of the war ; and had  
we determined to punish these traitors with death, if found invading  
our territories, and after giving them warning, acted up to such a  
determination, it would have been strictly right, and in such case  
very few would have entered Canada. While these persons act  
merely as Militia delending their adopted count:y against invasion,  
some lenity might be shewn them; but when they march into  
British provinces for the sake of conquest, they ought to be con-  
sidered traitors to their king and country, and treated accordingly.  
  
Third, Detention of Sailors as Prisoners, because they were in England  
when war was declared,  
  
This accusation is ridiculous, as sailors are always considered in  
the first class of combatants, but it comes with an ill grace from  
those who have detained peaceable British subjects engaged in civil  
life, and banished fifteen miles from the coast, those of them who  
happened to be in America at the declaration of war, and treated  
them almost, in every respect, like prisoners of war, according to  
Buonaparte’s example.  
  
Fourth, Forced Service of American Sailors pressed on board of English  
Men of Var,  
  
This accusation has been often made, bet never coupled with the  
offer of Mr. Foster, to discharge every American so detained, om  
being furnished with the list. ‘Lhe list was never furnished.  
  
Fifth. Violence of Flags of Truce.  
  
This accusation of Mr. Madison, contains about as much troth as  
those that have been already examined. We shall cive two examples  
of the treatment experienced by the bearers of flags of truce from  
the British army.  
  
Major Fulton, Aid-de-Camp to General Sir Ge orge. Pravost, was  
stopped by Major Forsyth, of the United States army, at the outposts,  
who insulted him most grossly, endeavoured to seize his d lispatches,  
  
and threatened to put him to death. So much ashamed were Forsyth&#x27;s  
superiors at this outrage, that he was sent, for a short time, to the  
ear.  
  
General Proctor sent Lieutenant Le Breton to Genera! Harrison,  
after the battie of Moravian Town, to ascertain our loss of officers  
and men; but, instead of sending him back, General Harrison  
detained him many weeks, took him round the Lake ; and after all,

did not furnish him with the required information which had been  
otherwise procured in the mgan time.  
  
Sixth. Ransom of American Prisoners taken by the Savages in the  
service of England.  
  
Some nation of the Natives were at wart with the Americans,  
long before hostilities commenced against England, many others not.  
When attempts were made to conquer the Canadas, the Indians  
beyond our territories, part by choice, and part by solicitation, came  
and joined us as Allies, while those within the provinces, had as  
great an interest in defending them, as the other proprietors of the  
soil. To mitigate as much as possible the horrors of war, it was  
expressly and repeatedly told the Indians, that scalping the dead, and  
killing prisoners, or unresisting enemies, were practices extremely  
repugnant to our feelings, and no presents would be given them,  
but for prisoners. This, therefore, instead of becoming an article  
of accusation, ought to have excited their gratitude, for the presence  
and authority of a British force, uniformly tended to secure the lives  
of all who were defenceless, and all who surrendered, It almost,  
without exception, saved the lives of our enemies, yet the American  
government brand us as worse than savages, for fighting by the sides  
of Indians, and, at first, threatened our extermination if we did so,  
although they employed all the Indians they could. Many individuals  
have acknowledged their obligation to us for having been saved by the  
benevolent and humane exertions of our officers and troops, but no  
officer of rank ever had .the justice to make a public acknowledg-  
ment. The eighth accusation is much the same as this, and must  
bave been separated in order to multiply the number of articles, It  
is notorious, that some British soldiers have been killed by the Indians,  
protecting their prisoners. This was the case at General Winchester’s  
defeat and at General Clay&#x27;s. The grossest exaggerations have been  
published, General Winchester was declared, in all the American  
papers, to have been scalped, and mangled in the most horrid manner,  
when he was m1 good quarters at Quebec. Ina general order, dated  
Kingston, 26th July, 1813, among other things respecting Indians,  
it is said that the head money for the prisoners of war, brought in by  
the Indian warriors, is to be immediately paid by the Commissariat,  
upon the certificate of the General officer commanding the division,  
with which they are acting at the time. Let us now see how the  
poor Indians are treated by the Americans, after premising that they  
haye done their utmost to employ as many Indians as possible against  
us. It is a fact, that the first scalp taken this war, was by the  
Americans at the river Canard, between Sandwich and Amberst-  
burgh. At this place an Indian was killed by the advance of General  
Hull&#x27;s army, and immediately scalped.* (2)  
  
At the skirmish of Brownston, several Indians fell, and were  
scalped by the American troops.

* (2)---An Indian never scalps his enemy, until after he is dead,  
and does so to presefve a proof or token of his yictory.  
  
  
  
Conduct of the Americans, 659  
  
The Kentuckians are commonly armed with a tomahawk and long  
scalping knife, and burn.Indians as a pastime.  
  
At the river Au Raisin, Captain Caldwell of the Indian department,  
saved an American officer from the Indians, and as he was leading  
him off, the ungrateful monster stabbed him in the neck, on which he  
was killed by Capt. Caldwell’s friends.  
  
The American troops, under Gen. Winchester, killed ati Indian in  
a skirmish, near the river Au Raisin, on the 18th Jan. 1813, and tore  
him literally into pieces, which so exasperated the Indians, that they  
refused burial to the Americans killed on the 22d. The Indian hero  
Tescumseth, after being killed, was literally flayed in part by the  
Americans, and his skin carried off as a trophy.  
  
Twenty Indian women and children of the Kickapoos nation, were  
inhumanly put to death by the Americans, a short time ago, near  
Prairie, on the Illinois river, after driving their busbands into a morass,  
where they perished with coldand hunger. Indian towns were burnt  
as an amusement, or common-place practice. All this, however, is  
nothing compared to the recent massacre of the Creeks. General  
Coffee, in his letter to General Jackson, dated 4th Nov. 1813,  
informs him that he surrounded the Indiam Town at Tukushatches in  
the night, with nine hundred men. That about an hour after sunrise,  
he was discovered by the enemy, who endeavoured, though taken by  
surprise, to make some resistance. In a few minutes the last warrior  
of them was killed. He mentions the number of warricrs seen  
dead to be 186, and supposes as many among the weeds, as would  
make them uptwo hundred. He confesses that some of the women  
and children were killed, owing to the warriors mixing with theit  
families. He mentions taking only 84 prisoners of women and  
children. Now it is evident that, in a village containing two  
hundred warriors, there must have been nearly as many women as  
men, perhaps more; and unquestionably the number of children,  
exceeded the men and women .together ; what then became of ali  
these ? Neither does General Coffee mention the old men. Such  
things speak for themselves. The poor Indians fought, it appears,  
with bows and arrows, and were able only to kill five Americans.  
Their situation was too remote for them to receive assistance trom  
the British. Their lands were wanted, and they must be extermi-  
nated. Since this period, the greater part of the nation has been  
massacred by General Jackson, wha destroyed them wantonly in  
cold blood. There was no resistance, if we except individaal ebul-  
lition of despair, when it was found that there was no mercy. Jackson  
mentions, exultingly, that the morning after he had destroyed a whole  
village, sixteen Indians were discovered, hid under the bank of the  
river, who were dragged out and murdered; upon these inhuman  
exploits, President Madison only remarks to Congress, that the Creeks  
had received a salutary chastisement, which would make a lasting  
  
impression upon their fears. |  
The cruelties exercised against these wretched nations are without

a parallel, except the coldness and apathy with which they are glossed  
over by the President. Such is the conduct of the humane govern-  
ment of the United States, which is incessantly employed, as they  
pretend, in civilizing the Indians ; but it is time to finish this horrid  
detail, we shall therefore conclude with a short extract of a letter  
from the Spanish Governor of East Florida, Begnigno Garzia, to  
Mr. Mitchell, Governor of the State of Georgia, to show that the  
policy of the Government of the United States, in regard to the  
Indians, ianow generally known,  
  
‘€ The Province of East Florida may be invaded ia time of pro-  
found peace, the planters ruined, and the population of the capital  
starved, and, according to your doctrine, all is fair ; they are a set  
of outlaws if they resist. The Indians are to be insulted, threatened,  
and driven from their lands ; if they resist, nothing less than exter-  
mination is to be their fate.” &#x27;  
  
7th &amp;F Oth.---Pillage and destruction of private properly in the  
Bay of Chesapeake, and the neighbouring country, and cruelties exer-  
cised in Hampton in Virginia.  
  
It required astonishing effrontery to make these articles of accu-  
sation, after the depredations and cruelties committed by the army of  
the United States in the Canadas.  
  
In the attack upon Crandy Island, some boats in the service of  
Great Britain ran aground. In this situation they made signals of  
surrender, but the Americans continued to fire upon them from the  
shore, Many jumped into the water and swam towards land, but  
they were shot, as they approached, without mercy. &lt;A few days  
after Hampton was taken, and some depredations were committed by  
the Foreign troops, who had seen some of their comrades so cruelly  
massacred, but before any material damage was done, they were  
remanded on board. Several letters from Hampton, mentioned the  
behaviour of the British, while there, as highly meri:orious, and con-  
tradict the vile calumnies of the Democratic prints, which Mr. Ma-  
dison copies in his Message to Congress.  
  
This brief account of the conduct of your Government and army  
since the commencement of hostilities (which might have been greatly  
extended) will fill the world with astonishment at the forbearance of  
Great Britain, in suffering so many enormities, and such a determined  
departure from the laws of civilized warfare, to pass so long without  
signal punishment,  
  
Before finishing this letter, permit me, Sir, to remark that the de-  
struction of the public buildings at Washington, entitled the British  
to your gratitude and praise, by affording you a noble opportunity of  
proving your devotion to your country. In former times, when you  
spoke of the magnitude of your services, and the fervour of your  
patriotism, your political enemies were apt to mention your elevated  
situation, and the greatness of your salary. But by presenting your  
library a freewill offering to the nation at this moment of uncommon  
pressure, when the Treasury is empty, and every help to the acqui-  
sition of knowledge is so very necessary to keep the government from  
  
Conduct of the Americans. 661  
  
sinking, you would have astonished the world, with one solitary action  
in your political life, worthy of commendation.  
  
Now are your obligations to the British army unimportant, though  
you have not aspired ‘o generous praise. An opportunity has been  
given you of disposing of a library at your own price, which if sold  
volume by volume, would have fetched nothing -- You have no doubt  
seen that old libraries do not sell well, after the death of the proprietor,  
and with a lively attention to your own interest, you take advantage  
of the times.  
  
Iam, Sir, with due consideration, &amp;c,  
JOHN STRACHAN, D.D.  
Treasurerer of the Loyal and Patriotic  
Society of Upper-Canada  
  
York, 30th Jan&#x27;y. 1815.  
  
POSTSCRIPT.—From Gen. M‘Arthur’s official account of his  
predatory excursion, | make the following extract to prove his extraor-  
dinary veracity :  
  
‘* We were thus enabled to arrive at the town of Oxford, one hun-  
‘dred and fifty miles distant from Detroit, before the inhabitants  
* knew that a force was approaching. They were promised protection  
* to their persons and property, upon the condition that they remained  
* peaceably at their respective homes: otherwise, they were assured,  
‘ that their property would be destroyed.”  
  
‘* However, notwithstanding this injunction, and the sacred obliga-  
* tion of a previous parole, two of the inhabitants escaped to Burford  
‘with the intelligence of our arrival. Their property, consisting of  
* two dwelling houses, two barns, and one shop, were instantly cone  
‘ sumed.”  
  
George Nicholl and Jacob Wood, are the persons here alluded to,  
both of whom applied to the Loyal and Patriotic society of Upper  
Canada for reliet.—The former had returned home before Gen,  
M‘Arthur&#x27;s report to the Secretary at War appeared in the News-  
papers : but the latter was at York after that publication. “ Ata  
meeting of the Directors of the Loyal and Patriotic Society holden at  
York on the 21st of January 1815, appeared Jacob ‘Wood from the  
county of Oxford, and produced a certificate from Major Brown,  
stating that he accompanied George Nichol from Oxford to Burford  
to give information of the advance of the American army, and in  
consequence of which his House, Forniture, Barn, Hay, Grain,  
Joiner’s shop and tools were destroyed by the enemy.”  
  
«* Jacob Wood was interrogated by the: Society, whether he or  
George Nichol were patroled by Gen. M‘Arthur, previous to their  
giving the British warning of the approach of the American army, In  
answer, he stated, that he and George Nichol had left their homes on  
hearing of the approach of the enemy, and weie so far from giving  
their parole that they never were in the power of General M‘Arthar,  
or his army.”  
  
“* The Directors put this question to Jacob Wood, because Gen,  
M‘Arthur, in his official report, states it as his reason for burning the

they had broken their parole.  
  
Gen. M‘Arihur had some reputation to lose, and ought to have  
known that sucha gross departure from truth was not the way to  
preserve it. The courage and zeal of Nichol and Wood, instead of  
punishment, deserved, and would have obtained the respect of a  
gallant and generous enemy. But on all occasions, the_ loyal inhabi-  
tants of this Province have been selected by your Generals as the  
object of their peculiar hatred.  
  
To pass rapidly, with a large body of cavalry, through a country  
thinly inhabited, and without the means of resistance, to feed upon  
the defenceless inhabitants : : to burn the mills none of which belonged  
to Government, and to destroy the provisions and the whole property  
of respectable men of principle: and then to run away, at the first  
symptom of serious opposition ; is no great exploit. Gen. M‘Arthur  
has been the Author of much distress to the defenceless inhabitants :  
many of whom have now One Hundred and Twenty Miles to go to  
mill, butina military point of view he hasdone nothing. It is forthe  
people of the United States to reflect seriously upon this mode of car-  
rying on the war ; and it is your interest, Sir, to advise a return to  
humanity, lest Moaticello should share the fate of hundreds of Farms  
in Upper Canada, lam, &amp;c.
