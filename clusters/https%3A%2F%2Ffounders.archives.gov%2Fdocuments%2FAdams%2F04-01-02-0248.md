s the dear Inhabitants of Boston, the Winter before last. Credulity and the Want of Foresight, are Imperfections in the human Character, that no Politician can sufficiently guard against.  
You have given me some Pleasure, by your Account of a certain House in Queen Street. I had burned it, long ago, in Imagination. It rises now to my View like a Phoenix.—What shall I say of the Solicitor General? I pity his pretty Children, I pity his Father, and his sisters. I wish I could be clear that it is no moral Evil to pity him and his Lady. Upon Repentance they will certainly have a large Share in the Compassions of many. But let Us take Warning and give it to our Children. Whenever Vanity, and Gaiety, a Love of Pomp and Dress, Furniture, Equipage, Buildings, great Company, expensive Diversions, and elegant Entertainments get the better of the Principles and Judgments of Men or Women there is no knowing where they will stop, nor into what Evils, natural, moral, or political, they will lead us.  
Your Description of your own Gaiety de Coeur, charms me. Thanks be to God you have just Cause to rejoice—and may the bright Prospect be obscured by no Cloud.  
As to Declarations of Independency, be patient. Read our Privateering Laws, and our Commercial Laws. What signifies a Word.  
As to your extraordinary Code of Laws, I cannot but laugh. We have been told that our Struggle has loosened the bands of Government every where. That Children and Apprentices were disobedient—that schools and Colledges were grown turbulent—that Indians slighted their Guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their Masters. But your Letter was the first Intimation that another Tribe more numerous and powerfull than all the rest were grown discontented.—This is rather too coarse a Compliment but you are so saucy, I wont blot it out.  
Depend upon it, We know better than to repeal our Masculine systems. Altho they are in full Force, you know they are little more than Theory. We dare not exert our Power in its full Latitude. We are obliged to go fair, and softly, and in Practice you know We are the subjects. We have only the Name of Masters, and rather than give up this, which would compleatly subject Us to the Despotism of the Peticoat, I hope General Washington, and all our brave Heroes would fight. I am sure every good Politician would plot, as long as he would against Despotism, Empire, Monarchy, Aristocracy, Oligarchy, or Ochlocracy.—A fine Story indeed. I begin to think the Ministry as deep as they are wicked. After stirring up Tories, Landjobbers, Trimmers, Bigots, Canadians, Indians, Negroes, Hanoverians, Hessians, Russians, Irish Roman Catholicks, Scotch Renegadoes, at last they have stimulated the  to demand new Priviledges and threaten to rebe

Her husband sees not the principle, but  
only the banter, and playfully retorts: “ As  
to your extraordinary code of laws, I can-  
not but laugh. We have been told that our  
struggle bas loosened the bonds of govern-  
ment everywhere; that children and ap-  
prentices were disobedient; that schools  
and colleges were grown turbulent; that In-  
dians slighted their guardians, and negroes  
grew insolent to their masters; but your let-  
ter was the first intimation that another  
tribe, more numerous and more powerful  
than all the rest, were growing discontented.  
This is rather too coarse a compliment, but  
you are so saucy, I won’t blot it out. De-  
pend upon it, we know better than to repeal  
our masculine systems. ... We have only  
the name of masters, and rather than give  
up this, which would completely subject us  
to the despotism of the petticoat, I hope Gen-  
eral Washington and all our brave heroes  
would fight; I am sure every good politi-  
cian would plot as long as he would against  
despotism, empire, monarchy, aristocracy,  
oligarchy and ochlocracy. A fine story in-  
deed! I begin to think the ministry as  
deep as they are wicked. After stirring up  
tories, Jand-jobbers, trimmers, bigots, Cana-  
dians, Indians, negroes, Hanoverians, Hes-  
sians, Russians, Irish Roman Catholics,  
Scotch renegades, at last they have stimu-  
lated the to demand new privileges,  
and to threaten to rebel.
