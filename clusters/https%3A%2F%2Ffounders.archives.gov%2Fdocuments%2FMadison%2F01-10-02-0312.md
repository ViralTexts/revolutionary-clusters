A fifth desideratum illustrating the utility of a senate, is the want of a due sense of national character. Without a select and stable member of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will not only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the causes already mentioned; but the national councils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its respect and confidence.  
An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every government for two reasons: The one is, that independently of the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable on various accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the offspring of a wise and honorable policy: The second is, that in doubtful cases, particularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong passion, or momentary interest, the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world, may be the best guide that can be followed.

f the justice and propriety of her measures had in every instance been previously tried by the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiassed part of mankind.  
Yet however requisite a sense of national character may be, it is evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous and changeable body. It can only be found in a number so small, that a sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be the portion of each individual; or in an assembly so durably invested with public trust, that the pride and consequence of its members may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and prosperity of the community. The half-yearly representatives of Rhode-Island, would probably have been little affected in their deliberations on the iniquitous measures of that state, by arguments drawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by foreign nations, or even by the sister states;

hin the power of the responsible party; and in order to be effectual, must relate to operations of that power, of which a ready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents. The objects of government may be divided into two general classes; the one depending on measures which have singly an immediate and sensible operation; the other depending on a succession of well chosen and well connected measures, which have a gradual and perhaps unobserved operation. The importance of the latter description to the collective and permanent welfare of every country needs no explanation. And yet it is evident, that an assembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide

preserve a personal responsibility in the members of a numerous body, for such acts of the body as have an immediate, detached and palpable operation on its constituents.  
The proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in the legislative department, which having sufficient permanency to provide for such objects as require a continued attention, and a train of measures, may be justly and effectually answerable for the attainment of those objects.  
Thus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the necessity of a well constructed senate, only as they relate to the representatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by prejudice, or corrupted by flattery, as those whom I address, I shall not scruple to add, that such an institution may be sometimes necessary, as a defence to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions. As the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought in all governments, and actually will in all free governments ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; so there are particular moments in public affairs, when the people stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice and truth, can regain their authority over the public mind? What bitter anguish would not the people of Athens have often escaped, if their government had contained so provident a safeguard against the tyranny of their own passions? Popular liberty might then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same citizens, the hemlock on one day, and statues on the next.  
It may be suggested that a people spread over an extensive region, cannot like the crouded inhabitants of a small district, be subject to the infection of violent passions; or to the danger of combining in the pursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that this is a distinction of

It adds no small weight to all these considerations, to recollect, that history informs us of no long lived republic which had not a senate. Sparta, Rome and Carthage are in fact the only states to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two first there was a senate for life. The constitution of the senate in the last, is less known. Circumstantial evidence makes it probable that it was not different in this particular from the two others. It is at least certain that it had some quality or other which rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations; and that a smaller council drawn out of the senate was

is clear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to the ancients, nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions. The true distinction between these and the American governments lies in the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity from any share in the latter, and not in the total exclusion of representatives of the people, from the administration of the

believed that any form of representative government, could have succeeded within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of Greece.  
In answer to all these arguments, suggested by reason, illustrated by examples, and enforced by our own experience, the jealous adversary of the constitution will probably content himself with repeating, that a senate appointed not immediately by the people, and for the term of six years, must gradually acquire a dangerous pre-eminence in the government, and finally transform it into a tyrannical aristocracy.  
To this general answer the general reply ought to be sufficient; that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty, as well as by the abuses of power; that there are numerous instances of the former as well as of the latter; and that the former rather than the latter is apparently most to be apprehended by the United States. But a more particular reply may be given.  
Before such a revolution can be effected, the senate, it is to be observed, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next corrupt the state legislatures, must then corrupt the house of representatives, and must finally corrupt the people at large. It is evident that the senate must be first corrupted, before it can attempt an establishment of tyranny. Without corrupting the legislatures, it cannot prosecute the attempt, because the periodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal success on the house of representatives, the opposition of that co-equal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and without corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine order. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the proposed senate can, by any possible means within the compass of human address, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through all these obstructions?

lost the support of the monarch, than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular branch.  
As far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its examples support the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta the Ephori, the annual representatives of the people, were found an overmatch for the senate for life, continually gained on its authority, and finally drew all power into their own hands. The tribunes of Rome, who were the representatives of the people, prevailed, it is well known, in almost every contest with the senate for life, and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it. This fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity was required in every act of the tribunes, even after their number was augmented to ten. It proves the irresistible force possessed by that branch of a free government, which has the people on its side. To these examples might be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to the testimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its vortex, had at the commencement of the second pun

The Senate was designed to hold a  
check over the popular branch of the  
National legislature, and the wisdom of  
the framers of the Constitution was never  
more exemplified than in extending the  
term of the Senatorial office to a period  
calculated to insure to the Senate perfect  
independence of action. “A well con­

singly an immediate and sensible operation; the other  
depending on a succession of well-chosen and well-con­

To the argument that a Senate appointed  
not immediately by the people, and for the  
term of six years, would gradually acquire  
a dangerous pre-eminence inthe government,  
and finally transform it into a tyrannical  
aristocracy, Hamilton said :  
  
‘* Before such a revolution can be effected,  
the Senate, it is to be observed, must in the  
first place, corrupt itself; must next corrupt  
the State legislatures ; must then corrupt  
the House of Representatives; and must  
finally corrupt the people at large. It is  
evident that the Senate must first be cor-  
rupted before it can attempt the establish-  
ment of tyranny. Without corrupting the  
legislatures, it cannot prosecute the attempt,  
because the periodical .change of members  
would otherwise regenerate the whole body.  
Without exerting the means of corruption  
with equal success on the House of Repre-  
sentatives, the opposition of that co-equal  
branch of the government, would inevitably  
defeat the attempt ; and without corrupting  
the people themselves, a succession of new  
representatives would speedily restore all  
things to their pristine order. Is there any  
man who can seriously persuade himsel! that  
the proposed Senate can, by any possible  
means within the compass of human address,  
arrive at the object of a lawless ambition,

with the true&#x27;JeaTl.of the people: &quot;I shall  
not scruple to add-that such an Institution  
may be sometimes &#x27;necessary, as a defense&#x27;  
to the people against their own temporary  
errors and delusions. As the &quot;cool and de­  
liberate sense of the community ought,&quot; ln­  
all governments, and actually will, In all  
free gqvernn-ents, ultimately prevail over,  
the views of its rulers; so there are par­  
ticular moments in public affairs; when  
the people, stimulated by some irregular  
passion, or some HJIclt advantage, or mis­  
led by the&quot; artful misrepresentations of in­  
terested men, may call for measures which  
they themselves wll afterwards be the  
most ready to lament and condemn. In  
the critical moments &quot;bow&quot; salutary will  
be the interference of some temperate and  
respectable body of .citizens, in order to  
check the misguided career. .and to suspend  
  
the blow meditated by the people against  
themselves, until reason. Justice and truth  
can regain. their authority over the public  
mind. What bitter&#x27; anguish wou!d not the  
people of Athens have, often escaped, If  
their government contained se- provident a  
safeguard against the tyranny of their  
own passions! Popular liberty might then  
have escaped the indelible reproach of de­  
creeing to the same citizens the hemlock  
on one day, and statues on the next.&quot;  
Whether or not the United States senate  
has come&#x27; up- to the, high anticipations of  
its founders la not here a matter of dls-,  
cusslon; for we only set out to cast a little  
light on the wisdom, or unwisdom of a  
  
resolution pending in the Kansas legisla--  
ture which, calls for such a change In the
