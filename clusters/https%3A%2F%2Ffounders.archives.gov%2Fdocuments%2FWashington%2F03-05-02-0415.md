The “Orderly-book” of the Revolutionary

Weir of West Point, containing a general or­  
der of Aug 3. 1776, which might well be re­

and placed in the hands of every officer and  
soldier, with the formal sanction of the ven­

Washington was at the head of 2U 000 troops,  
then defending the city of New York—some  
30,000 British troops in and around the har­  
bor— when he issued the following.  
That the troops may have an opportunity  
of attending public worship, ns well as to  
take some rest after the great fatigue they  
have gone through, the general, in future, ex­  
cuses them from fatigue duty on Sundays, ex­
