Sir  
Robinson’s house in the Highlands Septr 26th 1780.  
  
I have the honor to inform Congress that I arrived here yesterday about 12 o’clock on my return from Hartford. Some hours previous to my arrival Major General Arnold went from his quarters which were at this place, and as it was supposed over the river to the Garrison at Westpoint, whither I proceeded myself in order to visit the post. I found General Arnold had not been there during the day, and on my return to his quarters, he was still absent. In the mean time a packet had arrived from Lt Colonel Jameson announcing the capture of a John Anderson who was endeavouring to go to New-York, with the several interesting and important papers mentioned below, all in the hand writing of General Arnold. This was also accompanied with a letter from the prisoner avowing himself to be Major John Andrè Adjt General of the British army, relating the manner of his capture, and endeavouring to shew that he did not come under the description of a spy. From these several circumstances, and information that the General seemed to be thrown into some degree of agitation on receiving a letter a little time before he went from his quarters, I was led to conclude immediately that he had heard of Major Andre’s captivity, and that he would if possible escape to the enemy, and accordingly took such measures as appeared the most probable to apprehend him. But he had embarked in a barge, and proceeded down the river under a flag to the vulture ship of war, which lay at some miles below Stoney and Verplank’s points. He wrote me after he got on board a letter, of which the inclosed is a copy. Major Andrè is not arrived yet, but I hope he is secure &amp; that he will be here to-day. I have been, and am taking precautions, which I trust will prove effective, to prevent the important consequences which this conduct  on the part of General Arnold was intended to produce. I do not know the party that took Major Andrè; but it is said, that it consisted only of a few militia, who acted in such a manner upon the occasion as does them the highest honor and proves them to be men of great virtue. They were offered, I am informed, a large sum of money for his release, and as many goods as they would demand, but without any effect. Their conduct gives them a just claim to the thanks of their country, and I also hope they will be otherwise rewarded. As soon as I know their names I shall take pleasure in transmitting them to Congress.

himfelf to be Major John Andre, Adjutant  
General to the DPBritith army, relating the  
manner of his capture, and endeavouring to  
shew that he did not come under. the difcrip­

Robinfon’s Houfe in the High-  
SIR, land, Sept. 26.  
I Have the honour to inform congrefs, that  
1 arrived here yefterday about twelve o&#x27;clock  
on my retorn from Hartford. Some hours  
previous to my arrival, Major-General Ar-  
nold went from his quarters, which were at  
this place, and, as it was fuppofed, over the  
river to the garrifon at Weft- Point, whether  
I proceeded my/cli in order to vifit the poft,  
3  
  
I foundGeneral Arnold had notbeen there du.  
ring the day, and on my return to his quar.  
ters he was ftill abfent. In the meantime, a  
packet had arrived from Lieutenant-Colone]  
  
Jamiefon, announcing the capture of a John  
  
Anderfon, who was endeavouring to go to  
  
New York with feveral interefting and im.  
  
portant papers, all in the hand-writing of  
  
General Arnold: this was alfo accompanied  
  
with a letter from the prifoner, avowing  
  
himfelf to be Major John André, adjutant.  
general to the Britifh army, relating the  
manner of his capture, and endeavouring to  
fhow that he did not come under the defcrip.  
tion of a fpy. From thefe feveral circum.  
ftances and information, that the general  
feemed to be thrown into fome degree of  
agitatron, on receiving a letter a little time  
before he went from his quarters, I was led  
to conclude immediately that he had heard of  
Major André’s captivity, and that he would,  
if poflible, efcape tothe enemy, and accord.  
ingly-took fach meafures as appeared the  
moft probable to apprehend him; but he  
had embarked in a barge, and proceeded  
down the river, under a flag, to the Vulture  
fhip of war, which lay fome miles below  
  
Stoney and Verplaak’s Points. He wrote  
  
me a letter after he got on board, Major  
  
André is not arrived yet; but 1 hope he is  
  
fecure, and that he will be here this day,  
  
I have been, and am ftill, taking precau-  
  
tions, which I truft will prove effcQual to  
  
prevent the important confequences which  
this condut, on the part of General Ar-  
nold, was intended to produce, I do not  
know the party that took Major André, but  
  
it is faid that it confifted only of a few mi-

occafion as does them the hizgheft honour,

Jameson, announcing the capture  
of John Anderson, who was en-  
deavouring to go to New-York  
with several interesting and im-  
portant papers, all in the hand-  
writing of General Arnold. This  
was accompanied with a letter from  
the prisoner, avowing himself to be  
Major John André, Adjutant- gene-  
ral to the British army, relating  
the manner of his capture, and  
endeavouring to shew that he did  
not come under the description of  
a spy. From these several cir-  
cumstances, and iniormation that  
the General seemed to be thrown  
into some degree of agitation, on  
receiving a letter a little time be-  
fore he went from his quarters, I  
was led to conclude immediately,  
that he had heard of Major André’s  
captivity, and that he would, if  
possible, escape to the enemy ; and  
accordingly took such measures as  
appeared most probable to appre-  
hend him: but he had embarked  
in a barge, and proceeded down  
the river, under a flag, to the Vul-  
ture ship of war, whieh lay at some  
miles below Stoney aud Verplank’s  
Point. He wrote me a letier after  
he got on board. Major André was  
not arrived yet ; but I hope he is  
secure, and that he will be here  
to-day. i have been, and am tak-  
ing precautions, which I trust will  
prove efleciual to prevent the im-  
portant consequences which this  
conduct, on the part of General  
Arnold, was intended to produce.  
{ do not know the party that took  
Major André, but it is said it con-  
sisted .only of a few militia, who  
acted in such a manner on the oc-  
casion, as does them the highest  
honour, and proves them to be men  
of great virtue. As soon as I know  
their names, I shall take pleasure  
in transmitiing them to Congress.

and after he had uttered many of the majestic sentences  
which embodied his stalworth thoughts, he pointed to the  
work which was beside him and exclaimed, &quot;there is the  
orator of the eccasion.&quot; I would invoke for your three  
illustrious countrymen the oratory of him who never  
pralsed except where merit requtred it, and then only as  
ibat merit deserved, without pompous declamation or  
exaggerated eulogy. I present before you the juat, and  
discriminating the magnanimous and truthful Washing­  
ton to speak of Andre&#x27;s captors. He wrote to the Presi-­  
dent of Congress on the 20th September:  
I do not know the party that took Major Andre, but it is  
said to have conristed only of militia, who acted in such a  
manner as does them the highest honor, and proves them to  
be men of great virtue. They were offerad, I am informed, a  
lrge sum of money for his release, and as many goods as  
they would demand, but without any effeet. Their conduct  
gives them a just claim to the thanks of their country, and  
ae ae hope they wil be otherwise rawarded. As soon as I  
know their nanies I shall take pleasure in transmitting them  
to Congress.
