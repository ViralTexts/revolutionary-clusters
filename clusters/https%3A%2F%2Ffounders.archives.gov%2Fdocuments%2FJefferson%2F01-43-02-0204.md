 the Red river, observing in all other points the instructions before given.  
Your observations are to be taken with great pains and accuracy, to be entered distinctly, &amp; intelligibly for others as well as yourself, to comprehend all the elements necessary, with the aid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude &amp; longitude of the places at which they were taken, &amp; are to be rendered to the War-office, for the purpose of having the calculations made concurrently, by proper persons within the US. several copies of these, as well as of your other notes, should be made at leisure times, &amp; put into the care of the most trust-worthy of your attendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will be exposed. a further guard perhaps would be that one of these copies should be on the paper of the birch, as supposed less liable to injury from damp than common paper.  
The following objects in the country adjacent to the rivers along which you will pass, will be worthy of notice.  
the soil &amp; face of the country, it’s growth &amp; vegetable productions, especially those not of the maritime states.  
the animals of the country generally, &amp; especially those not known in the maritime states.  
the remains &amp; accounts of any which may be deemed extinct.  
the mineral productions most worth notice, but more particularly metals, limestone, gypsum, pit coal, salt petre, rock salt &amp; salt springs, and mineral waters, noting the temperature of the last, &amp; such circumstances as may indicate their character.  
Volcanic appearances.  
Climate, as characterised by the thermometer, by the proportion of rainy, cloudy &amp; clear days, by lightening, hail, snow, ice, by the access &amp; recess of frost, by the winds prevailing at different seasons, the dates at which particular plants put forth or lose their flower, or leaf; times of appearance of particular birds, reptiles or insects. most of these articles may be entered
