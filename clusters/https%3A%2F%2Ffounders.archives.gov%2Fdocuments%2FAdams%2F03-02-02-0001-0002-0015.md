Place, taken by itself and stripped of the other inconveniences which attend exile. M. Brutus, thought it enough, that those, who go into banishment cannot be hindered from carrying their Virtue along with them. Now, if any one judge that each of these comforts is in itself insufficient, he must however confess that both of them joined together, are able to remove the terrors of exile. For, what trifles must all we leave behind us be esteemed, in comparison of the two most precious things which men can enjoy, and which we are sure, will follow us wherever we turn our steps, the same Nature, and our proper Virtue? Believe me, the providence of God, has established such an order in the World, that of all which belongs to us the least valuable parts can alone fall under the will of others. Whatever is best is safest; lies out of the reach of human power; can neither be given nor taken away. Such is this great and beautiful work of nature, the world. Such is the mind of man, which contemplates and admires the world whereof it makes the noblest part. These are inseparably ours, and as long as we remain in one we shall enjoy the other. Let us march therefore intrepidly wherever we are led by the course of human accidents. Wherever they lead us, on what coast soever we are thrown by them, we shall not find ourselves absolutely strangers. We shall meet with men and women, creatures of the same figure, endowed with the same faculties, and born under the same laws of nature. We shall see the same Virtues and Vices, flowing from the same general Principles, but varied in a thousand different and contrary modes, according to that infinite variety of laws and customs which is established for the same universal end, the preservation of Society. We shall feel the same revolution of Seasons, and the same Sun and Moon will guide the course of our year. The same azure vault, bespangled with stars will be every where spread over our heads. There is no part of the world from whence we may not admire those planets which roll, like ours, in different orbits round the same central Sun; from whence we may not discover an object still more stupendous, that army of fixed Stars, hung up in the immense Space of the Universe, innumerable Suns, whose beams, enlighten and cherish the unknown worlds which roll around them; and whilst I am ravished by such contemplations as these, whilst my soul is thus raised up to heaven, it imports me little what ground I tread upon.”

ep HE providence of God has eftablithed  
fuch an order in the world, that of  
all which belongs to us the leaft valuable

Whatever is belt is fafeft; lies out of the

and beautiful work of nature, the world.  
Such is the mind of man, which contem-  
plates and admires the world whereof  
it makes the nobleit part. Thefe are in-  
feparably ours, and as long as we remain  
in one we fhall enjoy the other. Let us  
march therefore intrepidly wherever we  
are led by the courfe of human accidents.  
Wherever they lead us, on what coatt  
foever we are thrown by them, we fhall  
not find ourfelves abfolutely ftrangers.  
We fhall mect with men and women,  
creatures of the fame figure, endowed with  
the fame faculties, and born under the  
fame laws of nature. We fhall fee the  
fame virtues and vices, flowing from the  
fame general principles, but varied in a  
  
thoufand different and contrary modes,  
according to that infinite variety of laws  
and cuftoms which is eftablifhed for the  
fame univerfal end, the prefervation of  
fociety. We fhall feel the fame revolu-  
tion of feafons, and the fame fun and  
moon will guide the courfe of our yea.  
The fame azure vault, befpangled with  
ftars, will be every where {pread over our

from whence we may not admire thole

whence we may not difcover an objec

ftars hung up in the immenfe’ {pace of the
