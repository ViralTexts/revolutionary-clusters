 therefore I have not yet seen it, nor can say what it is.—I hope that by this time you have ceased to make wry faces about your vinegar, and that you have received it safe and good. You say that I have been dished up to you as an antifederalist, and ask me if it be just. My opinion was never worthy enough of notice to merit citing: but since you ask it I will tell it you. I am not a Federalist, because I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in any thing else where I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all. Therefore I protest to you I am not of the party of federalists. But I am much farther from that of the Antifederalists. I approved from the first moment, of the great mass of what is in the new constitution, the consolidation of the government, the organisation into Executive, legislative and judiciary, the subdivision of the legislative, the happy compromise of interests between the great and little states by the different manner of voting in the different houses, the voting by persons instead of states, the qualified negative on laws given to the Executive which however I should have liked better if associated with the judiciary also as in New York, and the power of taxation. I thought at first that the latter might have been limited. A little reflection soon convinced me it ought not to be. What I disapproved from the first moment also was the want of a bill of rights to guard liberty against the legislative as well as executive branches of the government, that is to say to secure freedom in religion, freedom of the press, freedom from monopolies, freedom from unlawful imprisonment, freedom from a permanent military, and a trial by jury in all cases determinable by the laws of the land. I disapproved also the perpetual reeligibility of the President. To these points of disapprobation I adhere. My first wish was that the 9. first conventions might accept the constitution, as the means of securing to us the great mass of good it contained, and that the 4. last might reject it, as the means of obtaining amendments. But I was corrected in this wish the moment I saw the much better plan of Massachusets and which had never occurred to me. With respect to the declaration of rights I suppose the majority of the United states are of my opinion: for I apprehend all the antifederalists, and a very respectable proportion of the federalists think that such a declaration should now be annexed. The enlightened part of Europe have given us  the greatest credit for inventing this instrument of security for the rights of the people, and have been not a little surprised to see us so soon give it up. With respect to the re-eligibility of the president, I find myself differing from the majority of my countrymen, for I think there are but three states of the 11. which have desired an alteration of this. And indeed, since the thing is established, I would wish it not to be altered during the life of our great leader, whose executive talents are superior to those I beleive of any man in the world, and who alone by the authority of his name and the confidence reposed in his perfect integrity, is fully qualified to put the new government so under way as to secure it against the efforts of opposition. But having derived from our error all the good there was in it I hope we shall correct it the moment we can no longer have the same person at the helm. These, my dear friend, are my sentiments, by which you will see I was right in saying I am neither federalist nor antifederalist; that I am of neither party, nor yet a trimmer between parties. These my opinions I wrote within a few hours after I had read the constitution, to one or two friends in America. I had not then read

A costive reserve on these subjects might have procured me more esteem from some people, but less from myself. My great wish is to go on in a strict but silent performance of my duty: to avoid attracting notice and to keep my name out of newspapers, because I find the pain of a little censure, even when it is unfounded, is more acute than the pleasure of much praise.

entirely ; the consolidation of the government ; the organization  
in three branches ; the subdivision of the legislative branch ; the  
happy compromise of interests between the large and small  
states, by the different manner of voting in the two houses; the  
voting by persons instead of states; the qualified negative on the  
laws given to the executive; and the direct power of taxation.  
There were points, however, which he disapproved, though of  
course vielding without hesitation to the will of the majority,  
whatever form it might think best to establish. He was desir-  
ous that a full and explicit bill of rights should be annexed to the  
constitution, to guard liberty against the legislature as well as the  
executive; that unrestrained exercise of religion, liberty of the  
press, uninterrupted security against unlawful imprisonment,  
trial by jury in civil as well as criminal cases, freedom from a  
permanent military power, and rotation in the executive office,  
should be all explicitly recognised and guarantied. Most of thes

w era in his life. We think that its haleyon days then ter-  
minated, and that he was never afterwards exempt from his full  
share of public or private cares. Hitherto he had acted in uni-  
son with the great body of his countrymen, and had had their  
confidence and support in all his measures. His residence  
abroad had kept him aloof from the contentions between the  
friends and opponents of the new constitution, and when he ar-  
rived from France, it might have been difficult to decide whether  
he should be ranked with one side or the other. In a letter to  
Judge Hopkinson, in March, 1789, he says, “ I protest to you,  
Iam not of the party of federalists; but I am much farther  
from that of the anti-federalists.” He then goes on to state  
what he approved in the new constitution, and what he objected  
to. His letters to Mr. Madison and others, also show that he  
judged of the constitution according to his speculative principle

instead ot Stales; the qualified negative on laws,  
gi»en to the Executive, which, however, l should  
have liked better if associated with the judiciary  
also, as in New York; and the power of taxa  
/ton. I thought, at first, that the latter might  
have been limited: a little reflection convinced  
me it ought not to be. What I disapproved,  
flora the first moment, also, was the want of a  
bill of rights, to guard liberty againat the legis­

and a trial bv jury in all cases determinable by

perpetual re-eligibility of the President. To
