.I enclose two papers that were read at different times by me to the commissioners; they may serve to show, if you should have occasion what was urged, on the part of America, on certain points; or they may help to refresh your memory. I send you also another paper, which I once read to you separately. It contains a proposition for improving the law of nations, by prohibiting the plundering of unarmed and usefully employed people. I rather wish than expect, that it will be adopted. But I think it may be offered with a better grace, by a country, that is likely to suffer least and gain most by continuing the antient practice; which is our case; as the American ships laden only with the gross productions of the earth, cannot be so valuable as yours filled with sugars or with manufactures. It has not yet been considered by my colleagues; but if you should think or find, that it might be acceptable on your side, I would try to get it inserted in the general treaty. I think it will do honor to the nations that establish it.  
  
With great and sincere esteem, I am, sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.Signed, B. Franklin.I shall save myself the trouble of narration and the risque of mistaking or misremembering facts and dates by giving original letters and memoranda, at the time, whenever I can. To this end, I shall insert a translation of a letter from the Comte de Vergennes, to save the trouble of

the seals of our arms, at Versailles, the twentieth of January, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three.Signed, [L.S.] John Adams.[L.S.] Benjamin FranklinThe preliminary articles of peace between France and Great Britain were signed at Versailles on the twentieth of January, 1783. As it is printed in the publications of that year and in the collections of treaties, it would be unnecessary to insert it here. The twenty second article, according to my most simple and literal translation of it, is in these words—Article 22d—To prevent all subjects of complaint and of contestation which may have birth on occasion of prizes which may be made at sea after the signature of these preliminary articles, we have reciprocally agreed that the vessels and effects which may be taken in the channel and in the north seas, after the space of twelve days, to be computed from the ratification of the present preliminary articles, shall be on one part and the other restored. That the term shall be of one month, from the channel and the north seas up to the Canary Islands, inclusively, whether in the ocean or in the Mediterranean—(depuis les manche et les mers du nord, jusqu’aux Isles Canaries, inclusivement, soit dans l’ocean, soit dans la Mediterranée) of two months, from the said Canary Islands up to the equinoxial line or the equator; and finally of five months in all the other places of the world, without any exception, or other more particular distinction of times or places.I have inserted this article chiefly for the purpose of exposing the Bri
