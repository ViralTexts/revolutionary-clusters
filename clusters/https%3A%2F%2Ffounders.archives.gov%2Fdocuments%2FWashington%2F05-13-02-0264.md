Accordingly in consequence of suggestions from the Treasury, the law mentioned in the close of the comptrollers letter was passed during the last session; which provides that all claims upon the united States for services or supplies or for other cause matter or thing furnished or done previous to the 4th day of march 1789, whether founded upon certificates or other written documents from public officers or otherwise, which had not already been barred by any Act of limitation, and which should not be presented at the Treasury before the first day of may 1794 should forever after be precluded from settlement or allowance; with the exception only of loan office certificates, certificates of final settlement, indents of Interest, balances entered in the books of the Register of the Treasury, certificates issued by the Register of the Treasury commonly called Registered certificates, loans of money obtained in foreign countries and certificates issued pursuant to the Funding Act. Neither of which exceptions covers either of the species of Paper, for the discharging of which Mr Duer’s agency appears to have extended.  
The claims presented under this Act are to be received and recorded by the Auditor; and the accounting officers of the Treasury are to make Report to Congress upon all such of them as shall not be allowed to be valid according to the usual forms of the Treasury

The truth is, that I did not care to go into a particular explanation with Mr Fraunces, but chose rather to deal in general expressions. Not Mr Duer only but the members of the late Board of Treasury and the late Treasurer are more or less implicated in the affair. what degree of culpability falls upon either of these parties is not yet definitively ascertained; and I have considered it as
