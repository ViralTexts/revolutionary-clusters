‘ I will avail myself of this occasion, my be­  
loved neighbors and friends, to thank you for  
the kindnesses which now, and at all times, I  
have received at vour hands. Borno and bred  
among your fathers, led by their partialities in­  
to the line of public life, 1 labored in fellowship  
with them through that arduous struggle, which,  
freeing us from foreign bondage, established us  
in the rights of self-government : rights which  
have blessed ourselves, and will bless, in  
their sequence, all the nations of the earth.—  
In this contest all did our utmest; and as none  
could do more, none had pretensious tosuperior  
merit. j :  
- 41 joy, my fiiendsin your joy, inspired by,  
the visit of this our ancient and distinguished  
leader and benefactor. His deeds in the war  
‘of independence you have heard and read.—  
They are known to you, and embalmed in your  
memories, and in the pages of faithful historyt  
His deeds in the peace which followed that  
war, are perhaps not known to you but T ean  
attest them. When I was stationed in his  
country, for the purpose of gementing its friend­  
ship with ours, and of advanding our mutua! in­  
terests, this friend of both was my most power­  
ful auxiliary and advocate. He made our  
cause his own, as in truth it was that of his  
native country also. His inflnence and con­  
nections there were great. All doors and al!  
departments were open to bim at all times; to  
me, only formally and at appointed times. 1a  
truth, 1 only held the nail; he drove it. Hon­  
or bumn, then, as your benefactor in peace, as  
well as in war. \
“ My triends, ¥ am old, long in the disuse of  
making speeches;, and without voice to utter  
them. T this feeble state, the exhausted pow­  
ers of life leave little within&#x27; my competence  
for your service. If, with the aid of my young­  
er and abler coadjutors, I can still contibute  
any thing to advance the institution, within  
whose walls we are now mingling manifesta­  
tions to this our guest, it will be, as it over has  
been, cheerfully and zealously bestowed. And  
could I live to see it once enjoy the patronage:  
and cherishment of our public anthorities with  
undivided voice; I should die without a doubt of  
the future fortunes of my native State, and in  
the consoling contemplation of the happy infin­  
ence of this institution on its character, its vir­  
tue, its prosperity and safety. :  
“To these effusions for the cradle and land of  
my birth, I add, for our nation it large, the as­  
pirations of a heart warm with the love of  
country, whose invocations to Heaven for its  
indissoluble union will be fervent and unremit­

freeing us from foreign bondage, esta-
