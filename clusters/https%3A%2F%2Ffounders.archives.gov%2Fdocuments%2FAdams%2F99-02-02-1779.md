Sir /  
London—12th: July 1796.  
  
Desirous of contributing efficaciously to the advancement of a Branch of Science which has long employed my Attention, and which appears to me to be of the highest Importance to Mankind, and wishing at the same time to leave a lasting Testimony of my respect for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,—I take the liberty to request that the Academy would do me the Honor to accept of Five Thousand Dollars Three per Cent stock in the Funds of the United States of North America, which stock I have actually purchased, and which I beg leave to transfer to the Fellows of the Academy, to the end that the Interest of the same may be by them, and by their successors, received from Time to Time, for ever, and the Amount of the same applied and given once every Second Year as a premium to the Author of the most Important Discovery or useful Improvement which shall be made and published by printing, or in any way made Known to the Public, in any part of the Continent of America, or in any of the American Islands, during the preceeding two years, on Heat or on Light, the preference always being given to such Discoveries as shall in the Opinion of the Academy tend most to promote the good of Mankind.—  
With regard to the formallities to be observed by the Academy in their Decisions upon the Comparative Merits of those Discoveries which in the Opinion of the Academy may intitle their Authors to be Considered as Competitors for the biennial Premium, the Academy will be pleased to adopt such Regulations as they in their Wisdom may judge to be proper and necessary—But in regard to the Form in which this premium is conferred, I take the liberty to Request that it may always be given in two Medals, struck in the same dye, the one of Gold and the other of Silver, and of such Dimensions that both of them together may be just equal in intrinsic value to the Amount of the Interest of the aforesaid Five Thousand Dollars stock during two Years;—that is to say, that they may together be of the Value of Three hundred Dollars.—  
The Academy will be pleased to order such Device or inscription to be Engraved on the Dye they shall cause to be prepared for striking these Medals, as they may judge proper.—  
If during any term of two Years, reckoning from the last adjudication, or from the last period for the adjudication of this premium by the Academy, no new Discovery or Improvement should be made in any part of America, relative to either of the Subjects in Question,  (Heat or Light,) which, in the opinion of the Academy, shall be of sufficient Importance to deserve this premium, in that case, it is my desire that the premium may not be given, but that the Value of it may be reserved and being laid out in the Purchase of Additional stock in the American Funds may be employed to Augment the Capital of this premium, and that the Interest of the Sums by which the Capital may from time to time be so augmented may regularly be given in Money with the two Medals and as an addition to the Original Premium, at each succeeding adjudication of it.—And it is farther my Particular request that those Additions to the Value of the Premium arising from its occasional Non-adjudications may be suffered to increase without limitation—  
With the highest respect for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the most Earnest Wishes for their success in their labours for the good of Mankind—I have the Honor to be with much Esteem and Regard,— / Sir / Your most Obedient / Humble Servant  
Rumford

United States of North America, which ftock I have aétually

With regard to the formalities to be obferved by the Acad-

difcoveries, which, in the opinion of the Academy, may en-  
title their authors to be considered as competitors for this  
biennial premium, the Academy will be pleafed to adopt fuch  
regulations, as they in their wifdom may judge to be proper

mium is conferred, I take the liberty to requeft that it may  
always be given in two medals, ftruck m the fame dye, the  
one of gold, and the other of filver, and of fuch dimenfions,  
that both of them together may be juft equal in intrinfic

fand dollars ftock, during two years ; that 1s to fay, that they  
may together be of the value of three hundred dollars.  
  
The Academy will be pleafed to order fuch device or in-  
{cription to be engraved on the dye they fhall caufe to be pre-  
pared for ftriking thefe medals, as they may judge proper.  
  
If during any term of two years, reckoning from the last ad-  
judication, or from the laft period for the adjudication of this

fhould be made, in any part of America, relative to either of

capital may from time to time be fo augmented, may regularly

And it is further my particular requeft, that thofe additions to  
the value of the premium arifing from its occafional non-adju-

appears to me to be of the highest importance to mankind;  
and wishing at the same time to leave a lasting testimony of  
my respect for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, I  
take the liberty to request, that the academy would do me the  
honor to accept of five thousand dollars three per cent. stock in  
the funds of the United States of North America, which stock  
I have actually purchased, and which I beg leave to transfer to  
the fellows of the Academy, to the end, that the interest of the  
same may be by them and by their successors received from

But in regard to the form, in which this premium is conferred,  
I take the hberty to request, that it may always be given in two  
medals, struck in the same dye, the one of gold and the other

est of the aforesaid five thousand dollars stock during two years;  
that is to say, that they may together be of the value of three  
hundred dollars.  
  
“The Academy will be pleased to order such device or in-  
scription to be engraved on the dye, which they shall cause to be  
prepared for striking these medals, as they may judge proper.  
  
“If during any term of two years, reckoning irom the last

tal may from time to time be so augmented, may regularly

And it is further my particular request, that those additions  
to the value of the premium, arising from its occasional non-

Hon. Nathaniel Bowditch.  
  
Joseph Gardner Cogswell, Esq. was elected a member of thie  
Academy, Aug. 14th, 1816.  
  
In 1796 the late Count Rumford made a very liberal donation  
to the Academy, the proceeds of which, amounting at that time  
to one hundred and fifty dollars a year, were to be given every  
two years, as a premium to the author of the most important dis-  
covery or useful improvement that might be made in any part of  
the Continent of America or in any of the American Islands on  
light or on heat. The premium has been claimed by several per-  
sons, but has never been adjudged to any one. ‘The fund has ac-  
cordingly been accumulating. It now yields between five and six  
hundred dollars a year. It was the wish of Count Rumford,  
that the premium. should consist of a gold or silver medal, of the  
value of three hundred dollars, and in case the fund should ace  
cumulate, that the remainder of the proceeds should be given in  
money.

that the Academy would do me the honour to accept of five  
thousand dollars, three per cent stock, in the funds of the  
United States of North America, which stock I have actually  
purchased, and which I beg leave to transfer to the Fellows  
of the Academy, to the end that the interest of the same  
may be by them, and by their successors, received from  
time to time, for ever, and the amount of the same applied  
and given, once every second year, as a premium to the  
author of the most important discovery, or useful improve-  
ment, which shall be made and published by printing, or in  
any way made known to the public, in any part of the  
continent of America, or in any of the American islands,  
during the preceding two years, on heat,or on light, the  
preference always being given to such discoveries as shall,  
in the opinion of the Academy, tend most to promote the  
cod of mankind.  
  
With regard to the formalities to be observed by the  
Academy in their decisions upon the comparative merits of  
those discoveries, which, in the opinion of the Academy,  
may entitle their authors to be considered as competitors  
for this biennial premium, the Academy will be pleased to  
adopt such regulations, as they in their wisdom may judge  
to be proper and necessary. But in regard to the form in  
which this premium is conferred, I] take the liberty to  
request that it may always be given in two medals, struck  
in the same dye, the one of gold,and the other of silver,  
and of such dimensions, that both of them together may  
be just equal in intrinsic value, to the amount of the interest  
of the aloresaid five thousand dollars stock, during two  
years; that is to say, that they may together be of the  
value of three hundred dollars.  
  
The Academy will be pleased to order such device or in-  
scription to be engraved on the dye they shall cause to be  
prepared for striking these medals, as they may judge proper.  
  
If during any term of two years, reckoning from the last  
adjudication, or from the last period for the adjudication of  
this premium by the Academy, no new discovery or im-  
provement should be made, in any part of America, relative  
to either of the subjects in question, (heat, or light.) which  
in the opinion of the Academy, shall be of sufficient im-  
portance to deserve this premium; in that case, it is my de-  
sire that the premium may not be given, but that the value  
of it may be reserved, and being laid out in the purchase of  
additional stock in the American funds, may be employed to  
augment the capital of this premium; and that the interest

Sir,—Desirous of contributing effica-  
ciously to the advancement of a branch of  
science which has long employed my atten-  
tion, and which appears to me to be of the  
highest importance to mankind, and wish-  
ing at the same time, to leave a lasting tes-  
timony of my respect for the American  
Academy of Arts and Sciences, I take the  
liberty to request that the Academy would  
do me the honour to accept of five thousand  
dollars, three per cent. stock, in the funds  
of the United States of North America,  
which stock I have actually purchased, and  
which I beg leave to transfer to the Fellows  
of the Academy, to the end that the interest  
of the same may be by them, and by their  
successors, received from time to time, for  
ever, and the amount of the same applied  
and given, once every second year, as a pre-  
mium, to the author of the most important dis-  
covery, or useful improvement, which shall  
be made and published by printing, or in  
any way made known to the publick, in  
any part of the continent of America, or in  
any of the American islands, during the  
preceding two years, on Heat, or on Light;  
the preference always being given to such  
discoveries as shall, in the opinion of the  
Academy, tend most to promote the good  
of mankind.  
  
With regard to the formalities to be ob-  
served by the Academy in their decisions  
upon the comparative merits of those dis-  
coveries, which, in the opinion of the A-  
cademy, may entitle their authors to be  
considered as competitors for this biennial  
premium, the Academy will be pleased  
to adopt such regulations, as they, in their  
wisdom, may judge to be proper and neces-  
sary. But in regard to the form, in which  
this premium is conferred, I take the liberty  
to request that it may always be given in  
two medals, struck in the same die, the one  
of gold, and the other of silver, and of such

be just equal in intrinsick value, to the  
amount of the interest of the aforesaid five  
thousand dollars stock, during two years;  
that is to say, that they may together be of  
the value of three hundred dollars.  
  
The Academy will be pleased to order  
such device or inseription to be engraved  
on the die they shall cause to be prepared  
for striking these medals, as they may judge  
proper.  
  
If during any term of two years, reckon-  
ing from the last adjudication, or from the  
last period for the adjudication of this pre-  
mium by the Academy, no new discovery  
or improvement should be made in any part  
of America, relative to either of the subjects  
in question, (Heat, or Light,) which in the  
opinion of the Academy, shail be of suffi-  
cient importance to deserve this premium;  
in that case, it is my desire that the premi-  
um may not be given, but that the value  
of it may be reserved, and, being laid out in  
the purchase of additional stock in the  
American funds, may be employed to aug-  
ment the capital of this premium ; and that  
the interest of the sums by which the capi-  
tal may from time to time be so augmented,  
may regulatly be given in money, with the  
two medals, and as an addition to the original  
premium, at each succeeding adjudication  
of it. And it is my further particular request  
that those additions to the value of the pre-  
mium, arising from its occasional non-adju-  
dications, may be suffered to increase with-  
out limitation.  
  
With the highest respect for the American  
Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the  
most earnest wishes for their success in  
their labours for the good of mankind,  
  
T have the honour to be,  
  
With much esteem and regard,  
Sir, your most obt. hum. servt.

Adams, July 12, 1796: —  
  
“ SIR: —  
“ Desirous of contributing efficaciously to the advancement of a branch of  
  
science which has long employed my attention, and which appears to me to  
be of the highest importance to mankind; and wishing at the same time to  
leave a lasting testimony of my respect for the American Academy of Arts  
and Sciences, — I take the liberty to request that the Academy would do me  
the honor to accept of Five Thousand Dollars three per cent stock in the  
funds of the United States of North America, which stock I have actually  
purchased, and which I beg leave to transfer to the Fellows of the Academy,  
to the end that the interest of the same may be by them, and by their suc-  
cessors, received from time to time, forever, and the amount of the same  
applied, and given once every second year, as a premium to the author of the  
most important discovery, or useful improvement, which shall be made and  
published by printing, or in any way made known to the public, in any part  
of the continent of America, or in any of the American islands, during the  
preceding two years, on Heat or on Light; the preference always being  
given to such discoveries as shall, in the opinion of the asics tend most  
to promote the good of mankind.  
  
“With regard to the formalities to be observed by the pone in their  
decisions upon the comparative merits of those discoveries, which, in the  
opinion of the Academy, may entitle their authors to be considered as com-  
petitors for this biennial premium, the Academy will be pleased to adopt  
such regulations as they in their wisdom may judge to be proper and neces-  
sary. But in regard to the form in which this premium is conferred, I take  
the liberty to request that it may always be given in two medals, struck in  
the same die; the one of gold, and the other of silver, and of such dimen-  
sions that both of them together may be just equal in intrinsic value to the  
amount of the interest of the aforesaid Five Thousand Dollars stock during  
two years ; — that is to say, that they may together be of the value of Three  
Hundred Dollars.  
  
“The Academy will be pleased to order such device or inscription to be  
engraved on the die they shall cause to be prepared for striking these medals,  
as they may judge proper.  
  
“ If during any term of two years, reckoning from the last adjudication, or  
from the last period fer the adjudication of this premium by the Academy,

no new discovery or improvement should be made, in any part of America,  
relative to either of the subjects in question (Heat or Light), which in the  
opinion of the Academy shall be of sufficient importance to deserve this pre-  
mium, in that case it is my desire that the premium may not be given, but  
that the value of it may be reserved, and, being laid out in the purchase of  
additional stock in the American funds, may be employed to augment the  
capital of this premium; and that the interest of the sums by which the  
capital may from time to time be so augmented may regularly be given in  
money, with the two medals, and as an addition to the original premium, at  
each succeeding adjudication of it. And it is further my particular request,  
that those additions to the value of the premium arising from the occasional  
non-adjudications, may be suffered to increase without limitation.  
  
“ With the highest respect for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,  
and the most earnest wishes for their success in their labors for the good of  
mankind, I have the honor to be, with much esteem and regard,

at the same time to leave a lasting testimony of my respect for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, —  
I take the liberty to request that the Academy would do me the honor to accept of Five Thousand Dollars  
three per cent stock in the funds of the United States of North America, which stock I have actually pur-  
chased, and which I beg leave to transfer to the Fellows of the Academy, to the end that the interest of the  
same may be by them, and by their successors, received from time to time, forever, and the amount of the  
same applied, and given once every second year, as a premium to the author of the most important discovery,  
or useful improvement, which shall be made and published by printing, or in any way made known to the  
public, in any part of the continent of America, or in any of the American islands, during the preceding two  
years, on Heat or on Light; the preference always being given to such discoveries as shall, in the opinion of  
the Academy, tend most to promote the good of mankind.  
  
“With regard to the formalities to be observed by the Academy in their decisions upon the comparative  
merits of those discoveries, which, in the opinion of the Academy, may entitle their authors to be considered  
as competitors for this biennial premium, the Academy will be pleased to adopt such regulations as they in  
their wisdom may judge to be proper and necessary. But in regard to the form in which this premium is  
conferred, I take the liberty to request that it may always be given in two medals, struck in the same die;  
the one of gold, and the other of silver, and of such dimensions that both of them together may be just equal  
in intrinsic value to the amount of the interest of the aforesaid Five Thousand Dollars stock during two  
years ;— that is to say, that they may together be of the value of Three Hundred Dollars.  
  
“The Academy will be pleased to order such device or inscription, to be engraved on the die they shall  
cause to be prepared for striking these medals, as they may judge proper.  
  
“Tf during any term of two years, reckoning from the last adjudication, or from the last period for the  
adjudication of this premium by the Academy, no new discovery or improvement should be made, in any part  
  
of America, relative to either of the subjects in question (Heat or Light), which in the opinion of the Academy  
  
Shall be of sufficient importance to deserve this premium, in that case it is my desire that the premium may  
  
nov be givin, but that the value of it may be reserved, and, being laid out in the purchase of additional stock

sums by which the capital may from time to time be so augmented may regularly be given in money, with the  
two medals, and as an addition to the original premium, at each succeeding adjudication of it. And it is
