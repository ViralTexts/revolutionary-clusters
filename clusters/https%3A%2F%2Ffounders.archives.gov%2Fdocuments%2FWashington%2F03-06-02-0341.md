Dear Lund,  
Col. Morris’s, on the Heights of Harlem, 30 September, 1776.  
  
Your letter of the 18th, which is the only one received and unanswered, now lies before me. The amazement which you seem to be in at the unaccountable measures which have been adopted by —— would be a good deal increased if I had time to unfold the whole system of their management since this time  
  
twelve months. I do not know how to account for the unfortunate steps which have been taken but from that fatal idea of conciliation which prevailed so long—fatal, I call it, because from my soul I wish it may prove so, though my fears lead me to think there is too much danger of it. This time last year I pointed out the evil consequences of short enlistments, the expenses of militia, and the little dependence that was placed in them. I assured [Congress] that the longer they delayed raising a standing army, the more difficult and chargeable would they find it to get one, and that, at the same time that the militia would answer no valuable purpose, the frequent calling them in would be attended with an expense, that they could have no conception of. Whether, as I have said before, the unfortunate hope of reconciliation was the cause, or the fear of a standing army prevailed, I will not undertake to say; but the policy was to engage men for twelve months only. The consequence of which, you have had great bodies of militia in pay that never were in camp; you have had immense quantities of provisions drawn by men that never rendered you one hour’s service (at least usefully), and this in the most profuse and wasteful way. Your stores have been expended, and every kind of military [discipline?] destroyed by them; your numbers fluctuating, uncertain, and forever far short of report—at no one time, I believe, equal to twenty thousand men fit for duty. At present our numbers fit for duty (by this day’s report) amount to 14,759, besides 3,427 on command, and the enemy within stone’s throw of us. It is true a body of militia are again ordered out, but they come without any conveniences and soon return. I discharged a regiment the other day that had in it fourteen rank and file fit for duty only, and several that had less than fifty. In short, such is my situation that if I were to wish the bitterest curse to an enemy on this side of the grave, I should put him in my stead with my feelings; and yet I do not know what plan of conduct to pursue. I see the impossibility of serving with reputation, or doing any essential service to the cause by continuing in command, and yet I am told that if I quit the command inevitable ruin will follow from the distraction that will ensue. In confidence I tell you that I never was in such an unhappy, divided state since I was born. To lose all comfort and happiness on the one hand, whilst I am fully persuaded that under such a system of management as has been  
  
adopted, I cannot have the least chance for reputation, nor those allowances made which the nature of the case requires; and to be told, on the other, that if I leave the service all will be lost, is, at the same time that I am bereft of every peaceful moment, distressing to a degree. But I will be done with the subject, with the precaution to you that it is not a fit one to be publicly known or discussed. If I fall, it may not be amiss that these circumstances be known, and declaration made in credit to the justice of my character. And if the men will stand by me (which by the by I despair of), I am resolved not to be forced from this ground while I have life; and a few days will determine the point, if the enemy should not change their plan of operations; for they certainly will not—I am sure they ought not—to waste the season that is now fast advancing, and must be precious to them. I thought to have given you a more explicit account of my situation, expectation, and feelings, but I have not time. I am wearied to death all day with a variety of perplexing circumstances—disturbed at the conduct of the militia, whose behavior and want of discipline has done great injury to the other troops, who never had officers, except in a few instances, worth the bread they eat. My time, in short, is so much engrossed that I have not leisure for corresponding, unless it is on mere matters of public business.  
I therefore in answer to your last Letter of the 18th shall say  
With respect to the chimney, I would not have you for the sake of a little work spoil the look of the fireplaces, tho’ that in the parlor must, I should think, stand as it does; not so much on account of the wainscotting, which I think must be altered (on account of the door leading into the new building,) as on account of the chimney piece and the manner of its fronting into the room. The chimney in the room above ought, if it could be so contrived, to be an angle chimney as the others are: but I would not have this attempted at the expence of pulling down the partition.—The chimney in the new room should be exactly in the middle of it—the doors and every thing else to be exactly answerable and uniform—in short I would have the whole executed in a masterly manner.  
You ought surely to have a window in the gable end of the new cellar (either under the Venitian window, or one on each side of it).  
  
Let Mr. Herbert know that I shall be very happy in getting his brother exchanged as soon as possible, but as the enemy have more of our officers than we of theirs, and some of ours have been long confined (and claim ye right of being first exchanged,) I do not know how far it may be in my power at this time, to comply with his desires.  
Remember me to all our neighbors and friends, particularly to Colo. Mason, to whom I would write if I had time to do it fully and satisfactorily. Without this, I think the correspondence on my part would be unavailing—I am with truth and sincerity, Dr Lund yr affect’e friend

Col. Morris’s, on the Heights o*’  
Harlem, 30th September, 1776.—Dear  
Lund: Your letter of the 18th, which  
is the only one received and unanswer­  
ed, now lies before me. The amaze­  
ment which you seem to be in at the  
uncountable measures which have been  
adopted by would be a good deal  
increased if I had the time to unfold  
the whole system of their management  
since this time twelve months. Ido  
not know how to account for the unfor­  
tunate steps which have been taken but  
from that fatal idea of conciliation  
which prevailed so long—fatal, I call it,  
because from my soul I wish it may  
prove so, though my fears leave me to  
think there is too much danger of it.  
This time last year I pointed out the  
evil consequences of short enlistments,  
the expenses of militia, and little inde­  
pendence that was to be placed  
on them. I assured that the  
longer they delayed raising a  
standing army the more difficult snd  
chargeable would they find it to get  
one, and that, at the same time that the  
militia would answer no valuable pur­  
pose, the frequent calling them in  
would be attended with an expense  
that they could have no conception of.  
Whether, as I have said before, the un­  
fortunate hope of reconciliation was  
the cause, or the fear of a standing  
army prevailed, I will not undertake to  
say; but the policy was to engage men  
for twelve months only. The conse  
quence of which, you have had grea  
bodies of militia in pay that never was  
in camp; you have had immense quan­  
tities of provisions drawn by men that  
never rendered you one Hour’s service  
(at least useful), and this is in the most  
profuse and wasteful way. Your  
stores have been expended, every kind  
of military (?) destroyed by them; your  
numbers fluctuating, uncertain and for­  
ever far short of report—at no one  
time, I believe, equal to twenty thou­  
sand men fit for duty. At present our  
number fit for duty (by this day’s re­  
port) amount to 14,759, beside on  
command, and the enemy within a  
stone’s throw of us. It is true a body  
of militia are again ordered out, but  
they come without any conveniences,  
and soon return. I discharged a regi­  
ment the other day that had in it 14 rank  
and file fit for duty only, and several that  
had less than fifty. In short, such is  
my situation that if I were to wish the  
bitterest curse to an enemy on this  
side of the grave, I should put him in  
my stead with my feelings; and yet I  
do not know what plan of conduct to  
pursue. I see the impossibility of  
serving with reputation or doing any  
essential service to the cause by contin­  
uing in command, and yet I am told  
that I if quit the command inevitable  
ruin will follow, from the distraction  
that will ensue. In confidence I tell  
you that I was never in such an  
unhappy, divided state since I was  
born. To lose all comfort and happi­  
ness on the one hand, whilst I am fully  
persuaded that under such a system of  
management as has been adopted I  
cannot have the least chance for repu­  
tation, nor those allowances made  
  
which the nature of the case requires;  
and to be told, on the other, that if I  
leave the service all will be lost, is, at  
the same time that I am bereft of every  
peaceful moment, distressing to a de­  
gree. But I will be done with the sub­  
ject, with the precaution to you that it  
is not a fit one to be publicly known or  
discussed. If I fall, it may not be amiss  
that these circumstances be known.and  
declaration made in credit to the jus­  
tice of my character. And if the men  
will stand by me (which by the  
by I depair of), I am resolved not to be  
forced from this ground while I have  
life; and a few days will determine the  
point, if the enemy should not change  
their plan of operations; for they cer­  
tain! v will not—l am sure they ought  
not—to waste the season that is now  
fast advancing, and must be precious  
to them. I thought to have given you  
a more explicit account of my situa­  
tion, expectation and feelings, but 1  
have not time. I am wearied to death  
all day with a variety of perplexing  
circumstances—disturbed at the con­  
duct of the militia, whose behavior and  
want of discipline has done great in­  
jury to the other troops, who never had  
officers, except in a few instances,  
worth the bread they eat. My time,  
in short, is so much engrossed that I  
have not leisure for corresponding,

far short of report. At no time I be

At present our numbers fit for duty (by

within stones throw of us. It is true a

Situation, that if I was to wish the bit­  
terest cur?e to an Enemy on this side  
the Grave, should put him in my  
stead with my feelings aud yet I do not  
know what plan of conduct to pursue.  
I see the Impossibility -of serving with&#x27;

follow from the distractions that will

with the Subject, with the precaution  
to you, that it is not a fit one to be pub

may not be amiss that these circum­

order to do justice to my character; and  
if the men will stand by me (which by  
the by I despair of) I am resolved not  
to be forced from this ground while 1

the point, if the Enemy should not  
change their Plan of operations for they  
certainly will not I am sure they  
ought not, to waste the eeson that is  
now fast advancing &amp; must be precious

I thought to have given you a more

I therefore in answer to your last  
Letter of the 18th shall say  
  
With respect to the Chimney I would  
not have you for the sake of a little  
work spoil the look of the Fireplaces,  
tho that in the Parlour must, I should  
think, stand as it does; not so much on  
acct of the wainscotting, which I think  
must be altered (on acct of the Door  
leading into the new Building) as on  
acct of the Chimney Piece &amp; the man-  
ner of its fronting into the Room.—The  
Chimney in the Room above ought, if it  
could be so contrived, to be an angle  
Chimney as the others are ; but I would  
not have this attempted at the expence  
of pulling down the Partition —The  
Chimney in the New Room should be  
exactly in the middle of it—the doors  
and every thing else to be exactly an-  
swerably and uniform—in short I would  
have the whole executed in a masterly  
manner.—  
  
You ought surely to have a Window  
in the gable end of the New Cellar  
(either under the Venitian Window, or  
one on each side of it.—)  
  
Let Mr Herbert know that I shall be  
very happy in getting his Brother ex-  
changed as soon as possible, but as the  
Enemy have more of our officers than  
we of theirs, and some of ours have  
been long confined (&amp; claim ye right  
of being first exchanged) I do not know  
how far it may be in my power at this  
time, to comply with his desires.—  
  
Remember me to all our Neighbors  
and friends, particularly to Colo Mason,  
to whom I would write if I had time to  
do it fully and satisfactorily—without
