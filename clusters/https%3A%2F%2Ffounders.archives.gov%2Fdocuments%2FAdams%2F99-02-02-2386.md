By the President of the United States of America,A PROCLAMATION.  
23 March 1798  
  
  
  
As the safety and prosperity of nations ultimately and essentially depend on the protection and the blessing of Almighty God; and the national acknowledgment of this truth is not only an indispensable duty which the People owe to Him, but a duty whose natural influence is favorable to the promotion of that Morality and Piety, without which social Happiness cannot exist nor the Blessings of a Free Government be enjoyed; and as this Duty, at all times incumbent, is so especially in seasons of Difficulty or of Danger, when existing or threatening Calamities, the just Judgments of God against prevalent Iniquity, are a loud call to Repentance and Reformation: And as the United States of America are, at present, placed in a hazardous and afflictive situation, by the unfriendly Disposition, Conduct and Demands of a foreign power, evinced by repeated refusals to receive our Messengers of Reconciliation and Peace, by Depredations on our Commerce, and the Infliction of Injuries on very many of our Fellow-Citizens, while engaged in their lawful Business on the Seas:—Under these considerations it has appeared to me that the Duty of imploring the Mercy and Benediction of Heaven on our Country demands, at this time, a special attention from its Inhabitants.  
I HAVE therefore thought fit to recommend, and I do hereby recommend, that Wednesday the Ninth Day of May next be observed throughout the United States, as a day of Solemn Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer: That the Citizens of these States, abstaining on that Day from their customary Worldly Occupations, offer their devout Addresses to the Father of Mercies, agreeably to those forms or methods which they have severally adopted as the most suitable and becoming: That all Religious Congregations do, with the deepest Humility, acknowledge before God the manifold Sins and Transgressions with which we are justly chargeable as Individuals and as a Nation; beseeching him, at the same time, of his infinite Grace, through the Redeemer of the World, freely to remit all our Offences, and to incline us, by his Holy Spirit, to that sincere Repentance and Reformation which may afford us reason to hope for his inestimable Favour and Heavenly Benediction: That it be made the subject of particular and earnest supplication, that our Country may be protected from all the dangers which threaten it; that our Civil and Religious privileges may be preserved inviolate and perpetuated to the latest Generations; that our public Councils and Magistrates may be especially enlightened and directed at this critical period; that the American People may be united in those Bonds of Amity and mutual Confidence, and inspired with that Vigour and Fortitude by which they have in times past been so highly distinguished, and by which they have obtained such invaluable Advantages: That the Health of the Inhabitants of our Land may be preserved, and their Agriculture, Commerce, Fisheries, Arts, and Manufactures be blessed and prospered; that the principles of Genuine Piety and Sound Morality may influence the Minds and govern the Lives of every description of our Citizens; and that the Blessings of Peace, Freedom, and Pure Religion, may be speedily extended to all the Nations of the Earth.  
And finally I recommend, that on the said day, the Duties of Humiliation and Prayer be accompanied by fervent Thanksgiving to the Bestower of every Good Gift, not only for having hitherto protected and preserved the People of these United States in the independent Enjoyment of their Religious and Civil Freedom, but also for having prospered them in a wonderful progress of Population, and for conferring on them many and great Favours conducive to the Happiness and Prosperity of a Nation.  
GIVEN under my Hand and the Seal of the United States of America, at Philadelphia, this twenty-third day of March, in the Year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight, and of the Independence of the said States the twenty-second.

A PROCLAMATION,  
%  
By the Pbesident of the United States  
cf America.  
A3 the ftfety and profperity of nations  
ultimately and e.Tentially depend on thepwee- |  
tion and &quot;blcfihig of ALMIGH I ^ GOD ; and  
the national acknr wledgment of this truth is not I  
only an indifpe&#x27; fable duty which the people owe  
to Him, but a duty whofe natural influence is  
favourable to the j romotion of that morality  
and piety, without which facial happinefs can­  
not exift, nor the blcffing« of a free government  
be enjoyed ; and this duty, at all times incum- :  
bent, is lc efpecialiy infcafons&lt;f difficulty and j  
of danger, when exifting or threatening cal uni- 1  
ties, the juft judgments of God againft preva* !  
lent iniquity, are a loud call to repentance and  
reformation ; and as the United Sta es of Ame­  
rica are at present pla^eJ in a hazardous and  
affliftive fuuation, by the unfriendly difpofition, !  
conduft and demands of a foreign power, evin­  
ced by repeated refufals to receive our mefTen­  
gers of reconciliation and peace, by depreda­  
I tions on cur commerce, and the infliftion of in - ;  
juries on very many of our fellow citizens, while t  
engaged in thtir lawful bufinefs on the feas : —  
Under thefe confideratious it has appeared to  
me that the duty of imploring the mercy and  
benediftion cf Heaven on our country, demands  
at this time a fpccial attention from its inhabit- ,  
ant 3.  
  
I have therefore thought fit to recomraenJ,  
ar.d I do hereby recommend, that Wednesday  
the ()th day of May next to be obferved through 1  
out the United Stages a* a day of Solemn  
Humiliation, Faffing and Prayer :—That the t  
ci izens of thefe S&#x27;a&#x27;es, abllaining on that day !  
from their cuilomary woldjy occupations, j  
offer their devout addreiles to the father of,  
mercies, agreeably to thofe forms or methods  
hich they have feverally adopted as the mod  
litable and becoming :—That all religious  
ongregations do, wfh the dcepetf humility,  
cknowledge before God, the manifold fins and  
-anigreffions with which we are jutily chargea­  
le as individuals and as a nation ; befeeching  
him, at the fama rime, of h s infinite grace,  
through the redeemer of the world, freely to  
remit all our offences, and to incline ur, by his  
holy fpirit, to that fi cere repentance and refor­  
mation which may afford us reafon to hope for  
his ineftimable favour and heavenly benedic­  
tion :—That it be made the fobjeft of particular  
and earned fupplication, that our coun ry may  
be protected from all the d irges which threaten  
it; that our civil and religious privil-ges imiy  
be preferved inviolate, and perpetuated to the  
latefi generations ; that our public councils and  
magi.trates may be efpeciaily enlightened and  
directed at this critical period ; that the Ameri­  
can people may be united in thofe bonds of  
  
amity and mutual connacnce, ana imp reu with  
that vigour and fortitude by which they hare  
in times pad be.n fo high y Uiflingudhed, and  
by which they have obtained fuch invahiable  
advantages :—That the health ot the inhabit­  
ants of our landm&#x27;y be preferved, and their  
agriculture, commerce, filheries, arts and ma­  
nufadtures be blelhd and profpered That the  
princip&#x27;es of genuine piety and found morality  
may influence the minds and govern the lives of  
every defeription of our citizens ; and that the  
bleflings of peace, freedom, and pure religion,  
may be fpeedily extended to a’d the nations of  
the earth.  
And finally I recommend, that on the faid  
day, the duties of humiliation and prayer be  
accompanie i by fervant Thanldgiving to the  
beftower of every good gift, not only farhav ng  
hidierto^prouAed and preferved the people of  
thefe Uni ed States in the independent enjoy­  
ment of their religious and civil freedom, but  
-dfo for having profpered them in a wonderful  
progrefs of population, and lor conferring on  
them many and greatfaveur* conducive to the  
happinefi and proiperity ot a nation.
