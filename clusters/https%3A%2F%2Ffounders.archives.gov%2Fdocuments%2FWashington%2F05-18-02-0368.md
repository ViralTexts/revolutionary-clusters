Sir  
Philadelphia August 19. 1795.  
  
Immediately upon leaving your house this morning, I went to the office for the department of state, where I directed the room, in which I usually sat, to be locked up, and the key to remain with the Messenger. My object in this was to let all the papers rest, as they stood.  
Upon my return home, I reflected calmly and maturely upon the proceedings of this morning. Two facts immediately presented themselves; one of which was, that my usual hour of calling upon the President had not only been postponed for the opportunity of consulting others, upon a letter of a foreign minister highly interesting to my honor, before the smallest intimation to me; but they seemed also to be perfectly acquainted with its contents, and were requested to ask questions for their satisfaction: the other was, that I was desired to retire into another room, until you should converse with them upon what I had said.  
Your confidence in me, sir, has been unlimited, and, I can truly affirm, unabased. My sensations then cannot be concealed; when I find that confidence so immediately withdrawn, without a word or distant hint being previously dropped to me. This, sir, as I mentioned in your room, is a situation, in which I cannot hold my present office; and therefore I hereby resign it.  
It will not, however, be concluded from hence, that I mean to relinquish the inquiry. No, sir; very far from it. I will also meet any inquiry; and to prepare for it, if I learn, that there is a chance of overtaking Mr Fauchet before he sails, I will go to him immediately.  
I have to beg the favor of you to permit me to be furnished with a copy of the letter, and I will prepare an answer to it; which I perceive, that I cannot do, as I wish; merely upon the few, hasty memoranda, which I took with my pencil.  
I am satisfied, sir, that you will acknowledge one piece of  
  
justice to be due on the occasion; which is, that, until an inquiry can be made, the affair shall continue in secrecy under your injunction. For after pledging myself for a more specific investigation of all the sugges⟨tions⟩ I here most solemnly deny, that any overture ever came from me, which was to produce money to me or any others for me; and that in any manner, directly or indirectly was a shilling ever received by me; nor was it ever contemplated by me that one shilling should be applied by Mr Fauchet to any purpose, relative to the insurrection.  
I presume, sir, that the paper No. 6, to which he refers, is not in your possession otherwise you would have shewn it to me. If I am mistaken, I cannot doubt, that you will suffer me to have a copy of it.  
I shall pass my accounts at the auditor’s and comptroller’s offices, and transmit to you a copy. I have the honor to be Sir with great respect yr mo. ob. serv.

SIR. ? gust 19,1795  
Immediately upon my leaving your  
house this morning, I went to the  
office for the department of state,  
where I direéted the room in which

objeét was to let all the papers rest

Upon my return home, I refle@ted  
calmly and maturely upon the pro­  
ceedings of this morning. Two salts  
immediately presented themselves,  
one of which was that my usual hour  
of calling upon the President had  
not only been postponed for the op­  
portunity of consulting others upon  
a letter of a foreign minister highly  
interesting to my honour, before the  
smallest intimation to me ; but they  
seemed allo to be perfeflly acquain­  
ted with its contents, and were re­  
quested to ask questions for their fa­  
tisfaction ; The other was, that I was  
desired to retire into another room  
until you should converse with them,  
upon what I had said. - - 7  
Your confidence in me, has been  
unlimited ; and I can truly affirm,  
unabufed. My sensations then can­

without a word or distant hint being  
previoafly dropped to me ! This,  
Sir, as I mentioned in your room, is  
a situation, in which I canonot bold  
my present office, and therefore I  
hereby resign it.  
It will not, however, be conciuded  
from bence, that I mnean to rtelin­

ot L yilkaßeneer3By inquoiry, and  
to prepare for it, if | learn this morn­  
ing, that there is a chance of overta­  
king Mr. Fauchet before he fails, I  
will go to him immediately.  
I have to beg the favour of you to  
permit me to be furnifhed with a co­  
py of the letter ; and I will prepare  
an answer to it ; which I perceive  
that I cannot do, as I wish merely  
upon the few balty memoranda which  
I took with my pencil.  
I am f(atisfied,&quot;Sir, that you will  
acknowledge one piece of justice due  
on this occaficn, which is, that until  
an enquiry can be made, the affair  
shall continue in secrecy under your  
injun&amp;ion, after pledging myf2lf for  
a more fpecific investigation of all  
thele suggestions. For | here most  
solemnly deny, that any overture e­  
ver came from me, which was to pro­  
duce money to me, or any others  
for me ; and that in any manner di.  
reétly or indireétly, was a shilling e  
ver received by me ; nor was it ever  
contemplated by me, that one shil­  
ling should be applied by Mr. Fau­  
chet to any purpose, relative to the  
infurre&amp;tion.  
I presume, Sir, that the paper,  
No. 6, to which he refers, is not in  
your pofleflion. Otherwise you would  
have thewn it to me. If I am mis­  
taken, I cannot doubt, that you will  
fuffer me to have a copy of it.  
I shall pass my accounts at the Au­  
ditor’s and Comptrollec’s office, a};ﬂ ;  
transmit io you a copy. &#x27; ¥  
I have the honour to be, &amp;  
Sir, with due refpeét, 3  
~ Your most obedient servant,  
. EDM. RANDOLPH.

also to be perfectly acquainted with its con-
