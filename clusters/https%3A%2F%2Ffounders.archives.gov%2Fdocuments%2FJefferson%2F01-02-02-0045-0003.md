Whereas the various and vague claims to unpattented Lands under the former Government, covering the greater part of the Country on the Western Waters, may produce tedious and infinite Litigation and disputes, and in the mean time Purchasers would be discouraged from taking up Lands upon the Terms lately prescribed by Law, whereby the Fund to be raised in Aid of the Taxes for discharging the Public Debt would be in a great measure, frustrated; And it is just and necessary, as well for the peace of Individuals, as for the Public Weal, that some certain Rules should be Established for setling and determining the Rights to such Lands, and fixing the Principles upon which such Claimers shall be entitled to Patents; to the End that subsequent Purchasers and Adventurers may be enabled to Act with greater Certainty and Safety. Be it enacted by the General Assembly that all Surveys heretofore made by any sworn surveyor, acting under Commission from the Masters of William and Mary College, and founded either upon Charter Importation Rights duly proved and certified according to ancient Usuage, upon Treasury Rights for Money paid the late Receiver General, upon Entry’s made with the Surveyor of any County for Tracts of Land not exceeding four hundred Acres, according to Act of Assembly upon any Order of Council or regular Entry in the Council Books, or upon any Warrant from the Governor for the time being, for Military Service in Virtue of any Proclamation either from the King of Great Britain or any former Governor of Virginia, shall be good and valid; but that all Surveys for Waste and unpatented Lands made by any other person, or upon any other pretence whatsoever, shall be, and are hereby declared null and Void; And that all and every person or persons, his her or their heirs or Assigns, claiming Lands upon any of the before recited Rights and under Surveys made as herein before mentioned, shall upon the Plats and Certificates of such Surveys being returned into the Land Office, together with the Rights, Entry, Order or Warrant upon which they were respectively founded, be entitled to a Patent or Patents for the same; Provided that such Surveys and Rights be returned to the said Office withinMonths next after the end of this present Session of Assembly: and where two or more persons shall claim the same  Land under different Surveys, the person claiming under that Su

And be it enacted that all Orders of Council or Entries for Land in the Council Books upon the Western Waters except so far as such Orders or entries respectively have been carried into execution by Actual Surveys in manner herein before mentioned, shall be, and they are hereby declared void and of no Effect. And that no claim to Land within this Commonwealth for Military service, founded upon the King of Great Britain’s Proclamation in the Year One thousand seven hundred and sixty three, shall hereafter be allowed; except a Warrant for the same shall have been obtained from the Governor of Virginia, during the former Government, or where such

The act proceeds to say that “all and every per-  
son or persons, his, her or their heirs, clatming lands  
upon any of the before recited rights, and under  
surveys made as herein before mentioned, (that is,  
by a county surveyor,) against which no caveat

and certificates of such surveys being returned into  
the land-office, together with the rights, &amp;c. upon  
which they were respectively founded, be entitled

To the court it seems clear that the law autho-  
rizes a plat and certificate of survey from the per-  
son whom it contemplates as the maker of that  
survey; that is, from the county surveyor. The  
  
formal requisites of the law are complied with by ~
