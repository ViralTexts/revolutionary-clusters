Genll Washington’s Farewell Orders issued to the Armies of the United States of America the 2d day of Novr 1783 Rocky Hill, near Princeton  
The United States in Congress assembled, after giving the most honorable testimony to the Merits of the Federal Armies, and presenting them with the thanks of their Country for their long, eminent and faithful Services, having thought proper, by their  
Proclamation bearing date the 18th day of October last, to discharge such part of the Troops as were engaged for the War, and to permit the Officers on Furlough to retire from Service from and after tomorrow, which Proclamation having been communicated in the public papers  
for the information and government of all concerned. it only remains for the Commander in Chief to address himself once more, and that for the last time, to the Armies of the United States (however widely dispersed the Individuals who composed them may be) and to bid them an  
affectionate—a long farewell.  
But before the Commander in Chief takes his final leave of those he holds most dear, he wishes to indulge himself a few moments in calling to mind a slight review of the past—He will then take the liberty of exploring with his Military friends their future  
prospects, of advising the general line of conduct which in his opinion ought to be persued, and he will conclude the Address, by expressing the obligations he feels himself under for the spirited and able assistance he has experienced from them, in the performance of an  
arduous office.  
A contemplation of the compleat attainment (at a period earlier than could have been expected) of the object for which we contended, against so formidable a power, cannot but inspire us with astonishment and gratitude—The disadvantageous circumstances on  
our part, under which the War was undertaken, can never be forgotten—The singular interpositions of Providence in our feeble condition were such, as could scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving,while the unparalleled perseverence of the Armies of the United  
States, through almost every possible suffering and discouragement, for the space of eight long years, was little short of a standing Miracle.  
It is not the meaning nor within the compass of this Address, to detail the hardships peculiarly incident to our Service, or to discribe the distresses which in several instances have resulted from the extremes of hunger and nakedness, combined with the  
rigors of an inclement season. Nor is it necessary to dwell on the dark side of our past affairs. Every American Officer and Soldier must now console himself for any unpleasant circumstances which may have occurred, by a recollection of the uncommon scenes in which he has  
been called to act, no inglorious part; and the astonishing Events of which he has been a witness—Events which have seldom, if ever before, taken place on the stage of human action, nor can they probably ever happen again. For who has before seen a disciplined Army formed at  
once from such raw materials? Who that was not a witness could imagine, that the most violent local prejudices would cease so soon, and that Men who came from the different parts of the Continent, strongly disposed by the habits of education, to despise and quarrel with each  
other, would instantly become but one patriotic band of Brothers? Or who that was not on the spot can trace the steps by which such a wonderful Revolution has been effected, and such a glorious period put to all our Warlike toils?  
It is universally acknowledged that the enlarged prospect of happiness, opened by the confirmation of our Independence and Sovereignty, almost exceeds the power of description. And shall not the brave Men who have contributed so essentially to these  
inestimable acquisitions, retiring victorious from the Field of War, to the Field of Agriculture, participate in all the blessings which have been obtained? In such a Republic, who will exclude them from the rights of Citizens and the fruits of their labours? In such a  
Country so happily circumstanced, the persuits of Commerce and the cultivation of the Soil, will unfold to industry the certain road to competence. To those hardy Soldiers, who are actuated by the spirit of adventure, the Fisheries will afford ample and profitable employment,  
and the extensive and fertile Regions of the West, will yield a most happy Asylum to those, who fond of domestic enjoyment, are seeking for personal independence. Nor is it possible to conceive that any one of the United States will prefer a National Bankrupcy and a  
dissolution of the Union, to a compliance with the requisitions of Congress and the payment of its just debts—so that the Officers and Soldiers may expect considerable assistance in recommending their civil occupations, from the sums due to these from the Public, which must  
and will most inevitably be paid.  
In order to effect this desirable purpose, and to remove the prejudices which may have taken possession of the Minds of any of the good People of the States, it is earnestly recommended to all the Troops that with strong attachments to the Union, they  
should carry with them into civil Society the most conciliating dispositions; and that they should prove themselves not less virtuous and usefull as Citizens, than they have been persevering and victorious as Soldiers. What tho’ there should be some envious Individuals who  
are unwilling to pay the Debt the public has contracted, or to yield the tribute due to Merit, yet let such unworthy treatment produce no invective, or any instance of intemperate conduct, let it be remembered that the unbiased voice of the Free Citizens of the United States  
has promised the just reward, and given the merited applause;let it be known and remembered that the reputation of the Federal Armies is established beyond the reach of Malevolence, and let a conciousness of their atchievements and fame, still incite the Men who composed them  
to honorable Actions; under the persuasion that the private virtues of economy, prudence and industry, will not be less amiable in civil life, than the more splendid qualities of valour, perseverence and enterprise, were in the Field: Every one may rest assured that much,  
very much of the future happiness of the Officers and Men, will depend upon the wise and manly conduct which shall be adopted by these, when they are mingled with the great body of the Community. And altho’, the General has so frequently given it as his opinion in the most  
public and explicit manner, that unless the principles of the Federal Government were properly supported, and the Powers of the Union encreased, the honor, dignity, and justice of the Nation would be lost for ever; yet he cannot help repeating on this occasion, so interesting  
a sentiment, and leaving it as his last injunction to every Officer and every Soldier, who may view the subject in the same serious point of light, to add his best endeavours to those of his worthy fellow Citizens towards effecting their great and valuable purposes, on which  
our very existence as a Nation so materially depends.  
The Commander in Chief conceives little is now wanting to enable the Soldier to change the Military character into that of the Citizen, but that steady and decent tenor of behaivour which has generally distinguished, not only the Army under his immediate  
Command, but the different Detachments and seperate Armies, through the course of the War; from their good sense and prudence he anticipates the happiest consequences; And while he congratulates them on the glorious occasion which renders their Services in the Field no longer  
necessary, he wishes to express the strong obligations he feels himself under, for the assistance he has received from every Class—and in every instance. He presents his thanks in the most serious and affectionate manner to the General Officers, as well for their Counsel on  
many interesting occasions, as for their ardor in promoting the success of the plans he had adopted—To the Commandants of Regiments and Corps, and to the other Officers for their great Zeal and attention in carrying his orders promptly into execution—To the Staff for their  
alacrity and exactness in performing the duties of their several Departments—And to the Non-commissioned Officers and private Soldiers, for their extraordinary patience in suffering, as well as their invincible fortitude in Action—To the various branches of the Army, the  
General takes this last and solemn oppertunity of professing his inviolable attachment &amp; friendship—He wishes more than bare professions were in his power, that he was really able to be usefull to them all in future life; He flatters himself however, they will do him the  
justice to believe, that whatever could with propriety be attempted by him, has been done. And being now to conclude these his last public Orders, to take his ultimate leave, in a short time, of the Military Character, and to bid a final adieu to the Armies he has so long had  
the honor to Command—he can only again offer in their behalf his recommendations to their grateful Country, and his prayers to the God of Armies. May ample justice be done them here; and may the choicest of Heaven’s favors both here and hereafter attend those, who under the  
divine auspices have secured innumerable blessings for others: With these Wishes, and this benediction, the Commander in Chief is about to retire from service—The Curtain of seperation will soon be drawn—and the Military Scene to him will be closed for ever

GENERAL WASHINGTON’s FareweELt ORDERS to the  
ARMIEs of the UNITED STATES.  
  
[From the New York Royat GazetTre.]  
  
Rocky Hill, near Princetown, Nov.2, 1783.  
  
HE United States in Congrefs affem-  
  
bled, after giving the moit honour-  
able teftimony to the merits of the foederal  
armies, and prefenting them with the  
thanks of their country, for their long,  
eminent and faithful fervice, having  
thought proper, by their proclamation,  
bearing date the 18th of Otober laft, to  
difcharge fuch part of the troops as were  
engaged for the war, and to permit the  
Officers on furlough to retire from fr-  
vice, from and after to-morrow, which  
proclamation having been communicated  
in the public papers for the information  
and government of all concerned : —it  
only remains for the Commander in Chief  
to addrefs himfelf once more, and that for  
the Jaft time, to the armies of the United  
States (however widely difperfed indivi-  
duals who compofed them may be). and  
to bid them an affectionate, a long fare-  
well.  
  
But before the Commander in Chief  
takes his final Jeave of thofe he holds mott  
dear, he wifhes to indulge himfelf a few  
moments in calling to‘mind a flight re-  
view of the paft: he will then take the  
liberty of exploring, with his military  
friends, their future profpetts, of ad-  
vifing the general line of conduét, which,  
in his opinion, ought to be purfued ; and  
he will conclude the addrefs, by expreffing  
the obligations he feels himfelf under for  
the fpirited and able affittance he has ex-  
perienced from them, in the performance  
ef an arduous office.  
  
A contemplation of the complete at-  
tainment (at a period earlier than could  
have been expefted) of the object for  
which we contended, againft fo formida-  
ble a power, cannot but infpire us with  
atonifhment and gratitude. The dilad-  
  
vantageous circumitances on our part,  
under which the war was undertaken, can  
never be forgotten. The fingular inter.  
pofitions of Providence in our feeble con-  
dition, were fuch as could {carcely efcape  
the attention of the moft unobferving, while  
the unparalleled perfeverance of the armies  
of the United States, through almoft every  
poffible fuffering and difcouragement, for  
the {pace of eight long years, was little  
fhort of a ftanding miracle.  
  
It is not the meaning, nor within the  
compafs of this addrefs, to detail the hard-  
fhips peculiarly incident to our fervice, or  
to defcribe the diftrefles, which, in feveral  
inftances, have refulted from the extremes  
of hunger and nakednefs, combined with  
the rigours of an inclement feafon ; nor is  
it neceflary to dwell on the dark fide of  
our paft affairs. Every American officer  
and foldier muft now confole himfelf for  
any unpleafant circumitances which may  
have occurred, by a recollection of the  
uncommon fcenes in which he has been  
called to aét no inglorious part; and the  
altonifhing events of which he has been a  
witnefs ; events which have feldom, if  
ever before, taken place on the ftage of  
human aétion, nor can they probably ever  
happen again. For who has before feen  
a difciplined army formed at once from  
fuch raw materials ? Who that was nota  
witne(s could imagine, that the mott vio-  
lent local prejudices would ceaie fo foon,  
and that men who came from tlre different  
parts of the continent, ftrongly difpofed  
by the habits of education, to defpile and  
quarrel with each other, would inftantly  
become but one patriotic band of brothers ?  
Or who that was rot on the fpot, can  
trace the fteps by which fuch a wonderful  
revolution has been effected, and fuch a  
glorious period put to all our warlike  
toils ?

It-is univerfally acknowledged, that the  
enlarged profpeéts of happinefs, opened by  
the confirmation of our independence and  
fovereignty, almoft exceeds the power of de-  
fcription: and fhall not the brave men  
who have contributed fo effentially to  
thefe ineftimable acquifitions, retiring vic-  
torious from the field of war to the field  
of agriculture, participate in all the blef  
fings which have been obtained? In fuch  
a Republic, who will exclude them from  
the rights of Citizens, and the fruits of  
their labours ? In fuch a country, fo hap  
pily circumftanced, the purfuits of com-  
merce, and the cultivation of the foil, will  
unfold to induftry the certain road to com-  
petence. To thofe hardy foldiers, who  
are a€tuated by the fpirit of adventure,  
the fitheries will afford ample and profi.  
table employment ; and the extenfive and  
fertile regions of the Weft will yield a  
moit happy afylum to thofe, who, fond  
of domeftic enjoyment, are feeking for  
perfonal independence. Nor is it poffible  
to conceive that any one of the United  
States will prefer a national bankruptcy,  
and a diffolution of the union, to a com-  
pliance with the —- of Congrefs,  
and the payment of its juft debts, fo that  
the officers and foldiers may expeét confi-  
derable afliftance, in recommencing their  
civil occupations, from the fums due to  
them from the Public, which muft and  
will moft inevitably be paid.  
  
In order to effett this defirable purpofe,  
and to remove the prejudices which may  
have taken pofleflion of the minds of any  
of the pood people of the States, it is  
earneftly recommended to all the troops,  
that, with ftrong’ attachment to the Union,  
they fhould carry with them into civil  
fociety the moft conciliating difpofitions ;  
and that they fhould prove themfelves not  
lefs virtuous and ufeful as citizens, than  
they have been perfevering and victorious  
as foldiers.—What though ,there fhould  
be fome envicus individuals, who are un-  
willing to py the debt the Public has  
contracted, or to yield the tribute due to  
merit ; yet let fuch unworthy treatment  
produce no invective, or any inttance of  
intemperate condnét : let itbe remembered,  
that the unbiafled voice of the frée citizens  
of the United States has promifed the jut  
reward, and given merited applaule; let  
it be known and remembered, that the re-  
putation of the fcederal armies is «ta-  
blithed beyond the reach of malevolence,  
  
. and let a confcioufneis of their atchieve-  
  
ments and fame, ftill excite the men who  
compofed them to honowable aGtions, un-

der the perfuafion, that private virtues of  
ceconomy, prudence, and induftry, will  
not be lefs amiable in civil life, than the  
more fplendid qualities of valour, perfe-  
verance, and enterprife, were in the fields  
—Every one may reft affured that much,  
very much of the future happinefs of the  
Officers and men, will depend upon. the  
wife and manly condu&amp; which fhall be  
adopted by them, when they are mingled  
with the great body of the community.  
And although the General has fo fre-  
quently given it as his opinion, in the moft  
public and explicit manner, that unlefs the  
principles of the foederal government were  
properly {upported, and the powers of the  
union encreafed, the honour, dignity, and  
juttice of the nation, would be loft for  
ever; yet he cannot help repeating on  
this uccation fo interefting a feutiment, and  
leaving it as his lait injunétion to every  
officer and every foldier, who may view  
the fubjeét in the fame ferious point of  
light, to add his beft endeavours to thofe  
of his worthy fellow citizens, towards  
effeGting thefe great and valuable pur-  
pofes, on which our very exiftence as a  
nation {o materially depends.  
  
The Commander in Chief conceives  
little is now wanting to enable the foldier  
to change the military character into that  
of a citizen, but that fteady and decent  
tenour of behaviour, which has generally  
diftinguithed, not only the army under his  
immediate command, but the different de-  
tachments and separate armies, through  
the courfe of the war: from their =  
fenfe and prudence he anticipated the hap-  
pieft confequences ; and while he congra-  
tulates them on the glorious occalion  
which renders sheir fervices in the field no  
longer neceffary, he withes to exprefs the  
ftrong obligations he feels hifelf under,  
for. the affittance he has received from every  
clafs, and in every initance. He prefents  
his thanks, in the moft ferious and af-  
fe&amp;tionate manner, to the’General Offi-  
cers, as well for their counfel, on many  
interefting occafions, as for their ardour in  
promoting the fuccefs of the plans he had  
adopted ; to the Commandants of regi-  
ments and corps, and to the other Oifi-  
cers, for their great zeal and attention in  
carrying his orders promptly into execu-  
tion; to the Staff, for their alacrity and  
exaétnefs in performing the duties of their  
feveral departments ; and to the non-com-  
miffioned Officers and private Soldiers,  
for their extraordinary patience in fuffering,  
as well as their invincible fortitude in  
aétion ; to various branches of the army

the General takes this laft end folemn op-  
portunity of profeffing his inviolable at-  
tachment and friendfhip.—He wifhes more  
than bare profeffions were in his power,  
that he was really able to be ufeful to  
them al] in future life ;—he flatters him-  
felf, however, they will do him the juftice  
to believe, that whatever could with pro-  
ptiety be attempted by him, has been  
done.—And being now to conclude thefe  
his laft public orders, to take his ulti-  
mate leave, in a fhort time, of the mili-  
tary character,—and to bid a final adieu  
to the armies he has fo long had the ho-  
nour to command, he can only again offer,  
in their, behalf, his recommendation to  
their grateful country, and his prayers to  
the God of Armies. —May ample juttice  
be done them here, and may the choiceft  
of Heaven’s favours, both here and here-  
after attend thofe, who, under the Divine  
aufpices, have fecured innumerable blef-  
fings for others. With thefe withes, and  
this benediétion,. the Commander in Chief  
is about to retire from fervice—The cur-  
tain of feparation will foon be drawn—  
and the military fcene to him will be clofed  
for ever

culture, participate in alt the bileffings which  
have been obtained ? In foch a lepubiic,  
who will exclu’e them from the rights of  
citizens, and the fruits of their Jabours 2  
In such a country, fo&quot;happily circamitasced,  
the pursuits of commerce and the cultivari­  
on of the foil will vntold to industry the  
certain road to comperence.~~To those  
hardy soldiers, who are aétuared by the fpi­  
rit’ of adventuce, the fitheries will aford  
ample and profitable employment § and  
the exterfive and fertile regions of the Welt  
will yield a most hapf){ afytum t 9 those  
who, fond of demeftic enjoyment, are  
tecking for personal independence. Nor is  
it possible to conceive that any one of the  
United States will prefer a national bank  
raptcy, and a difolution of the union, to a  
compliance with the requisitions of Con­  
grels, and the payment ofirs julls debts, so  
that the officers and soldiers may expeét  
considerable afiiltance, in re commencing  
their civil gecupations, from the sums due  
to them ‘from the public, which must and  
will most inevitably be paid. -  
In order to efle&amp; this defitable purpose,  
and to remove the prejudices which may  
have taken possession of the minds of any  
of the good people of the states, it is ear­  
nestly recommended to all the troops that,  
with strong attachment to the ‘union, they  
should carry with them into eivil fociety,the  
most conciliating dispositions ; and that they  
should prove themselves sot lels virtuous  
and ufeful as citizens, than they have been  
persevering and victorious as soldiers.—  
What though there should be some ervious  
individuals, v ho are unwilling to paythe debt  
the public has contracted, or to yield the  
tribute due to merit, yet let (uch unworthy  
treatment produce no invetive, or any in­  
stance of intemperate condut,=-let it be  
. g, &amp; o  
  
  
remembered that the unbiailed voice of the  
tree citizens of the United States has pro­  
mifled the just reward, and giventhe me­  
rited applaufe,—~llet it be known and re­  
membered, that the reputation of the fede­  
ral armies 15 eftabiifhed beyond the reach  
of malevoleace, and let a confcioufoefs of  
their atchievments and fame, fill excie the  
men who composed them, to henorable  
actions, under the perfuation, that the prie  
vate virtues of csconomy, prudence and  
industry, will not be less amible in civil lite,  
than the more splendid quaiuies of valour,  
perseverance and enterprise, were in the  
field :—Every ore may rest aflured thae  
much, very much of theturure happine(s  
ot the officers and men, will depend upon  
the wife and manly conduét which thall be  
adobted by them, when they are mingled  
with the great boedy of the communuy.  
And although the General has so trequens­  
ly given it as hisopinion, ia the most pub­  
lrc and explicit manner, that unleis the prin­  
ciples of the [cederal government were pro­  
periy supported, and the powers of itk  
union encieafed,the honor,dignity &amp; justice  
of the nation,would be loft forever: yet he  
caanot help repeating on this occalion,{u ins  
terefting a sentiment, ana leaving i as his  
Jaft injustion to every officer and every  
soldier, who may view the subject in the

44 Genere! Wofeinaten’s Farewell Orders.  
  
qitude. The difadvantagcous circrm-  
flanceson our part, under whicn the  
War was undertaken, Can never be  
forgotten. The fingu!ar interpofitions  
of Providence, in our feeble conditi-  
on, were fuch as could fcarcely ef-  
cape the attention of the moft unob-  
ferving; while the unparalleled per-  
feverance of the armies of tie United  
States, thro’ almoft every poffivie fuf-  
fering and difcouragement, for tne  
fpace of eight long years, was little  
fhort of aflanding m.rac!e.  
  
I¢ is not the meaning, nor within  
the compafs of this addrefs, to detail  
  
- the hardfhips peculiarly incident to our  
  
fervice, or to defcribe the difireffes  
which in feveral inftances have refult-,  
ed from the extremes of hunger and  
  
. nakednefs, combined with the rigours  
  
of an mclement feafon; ner js-1f ne-  
ceflary to dwell on the dark fide of  
our paft affairs.--Every American  
oficer and foldier mutt now confole  
himfelf for any onpleafant circum-  
fiances which may have occurred,  
by a recolleQion of the uncommon  
fcenes in which hé has been catted to  
aft no ing!érions part ; and the afton-  
iffing ¢vents of which he has been a  
witnefs; events which have feldom,  
if ever before, taken place on the ftage  
of human a@ion, nor can they  
probably ever happen again. For  
who has before feen a difciplined ar-  
my formed at once:from fuch raw  
materials? Whothat wasnot a wit-  
nefs cOuld imagine, that the moft vio-  
Jent lovai prejudicés would ceafe fo  
fooén, and that meh who came from  
the different parts of thé continent,  
ftrengly difpofed by the habits of edu-  
Cation, to cefpife and quarrel with  
each other,would inflantly became but  
one patriotic band of brothets ? or  
who that was pot on the fpot, car  
trace the fleps by which fuch a won-  
cerfal revolétion has béea effeGed,  
and fuch a glorious period put to ail  
our warlike toils ?  
  
It is univerfally acknowledged that  
the enlarged profpe&amp;s of happinefs,  
opened by the confirmation of ovr in-  
Gependence and fovereigaty, almoft  
exceed the power of defcription : And  
fhail not the brave men who have con-  
tributed fo effentiglly to thefe inefti-  
mabie acquifitions, retiring vi@teri-  
  
ous from the fleld of war tothe feld -  
  
  
  
of apriculture, participaté im all the  
bleflings whch have been obtained?  
In fucha republic, who will exclude  
them from the rights of Citizens, and  
the fruits of their labours? In fuch  
acountry, fo happily circumflanced,  
the purfuits of commerce and the  
€ultivation of the foil will unfold to  
tiduflry the certain road to compe.  
tence. Tothofe hardy foldiers, who  
are attuated by the (pmut of adventure  
the fifheries will afford ample and  
profitable employment; and the ex-  
tenfive and fertile regions ef the Weft  
will yield a moft happy afylum to  
thofe who, fond of domefiic enjoy-  
ment, are feeking for perfonal inde.  
pendence. Nor is it poffibie to con-  
ceive that any one of tie United  
States will prefer a national bank-  
reptcyy andediffobution of the union,  
toacompliance with the requifitions  
of Congre(s, and the payment of its  
juft debts, fo that the officers and  
foldiers may expect confiderable affift-  
ance, in re-commencing their civil oc-  
cupations, from the fums due to them  
from the public, which muff and will  
oll inevitably be paid.  
  
In order to effec this defirable pur-  
pofe, and to remove the prejudices  
which may have taken poffeffion of  
the minds of any of the good people  
of the flates, it is earneftly recom-  
mendéd to aj] thetroops that, with  
fifong attachments to tiie union, they  
fhould carry with them into civil fo-  
ciety, the moft conciliating difpofiti-  
ons ; and that they fhould prove them-  
felves not lefs virtuous and ufeful as  
Citizens, than they have been perfe-  
yering and vitterious as foldiers  
‘What though there fhould be fome en-  
vious individuals, who are unwilling  
to pay the debt the public hat,  
coutrafed, or to yield the tribute  
duéto merit, yet let fuch unworthy  
ti¢afmect produce no invettive, of  
any inftance of intemperate condud,  
Jet it be remembered that the unbi-  
affed voice of the free citizens of the  
United States has promifed the jul  
‘reward, and given the merited ap  
plaufe ; let it be Known and remem:

wife.and manly condu&amp; which fhall  
be adopted by them, when they are

eommunity. And alrhough the Ge-  
neral has fo frequently given it as his

, ofthe federal government were pro-

Hut befoic tlie Commander in Chief

that unlefs the principles of the foederal govern-

to the armies of the united fates.  
  
Rocky Hill, near Princeton,  
November 2, 1783.  
  
HE united flates in congrefs af-  
fembled, after giving the moft  
honourable teftimony to the federal  
armies, and prefenting them with the  
thanks of their country, for their long,  
eminent, and faithful fervices—having  
thought proper, by their proclamation,  
bearing date the 18th of Ottober laft,  
to dickens fuch part of the troops as  
were engaged for the war, and to per-  
mit the officers on furlough to retire  
from fervice, from and after to-mor-  
row, which proclamation having been  
communicated in the public papers for  
the information and government of  
alt concerned—it only remains for the  
commander in chief toaddrefs him{eclf  
once more, and that, for the lait time,  
to the armies of the united flates (how-  
ever widely difperfed the individuals  
who compofed them may be) and to  
— an affettionatem~a long fare-  
well,  
  
But before the commander in chief  
takes his final leave of thofe he holds  
moft dear, he wifhes to indulge him-  
felf a few moments in calling to  
mind a flight review of the paft—he  
will then take the liberty of explor-  
ing, with his military friends, their  
future profpetis—of advifing the ge-  
neral lime of conduét, which, im his  
opinion, ought to be purfued ; and he  
will conclude the addrefs, by expref-  
fing the obligations. he feels himfelf  
  
under for the Spirited and able affir  
tance he has experienced fron them,  
in the performance of an arduoy  
office.  
  
A contemplation of the comple  
attainment, at a period earlier thap  
could have been expected, of the ob.  
ject for which we comended, againg  
io form:dable a power, cannot but ine  
{pire us wth aflonifhinent and grat  
tude. The difadvantageous circum,  
fiances on our part, under which the  
war was undertaken, can never  
forgotten. The fingular interpofition  
of providence in our feeble condition,  
were fiuch as could {carcely efcape the  
attention of the moit unobferving  
while the unparalleled perfeverane  
of the armies of the united fates  
through almoit every poilible fuffering  
and difcouragement, for the {pace of  
é¢ight long years, was little fhort of a  
ftanding miracte.  
  
It is not the meaning, nor within  
the compafs of this addrefs, to detail  
the hardihips peculiarly incident to  
our fervice, or to deferibe the dif.  
treffes, which, in feveral. inflances  
have refulted from the extremes of  
hunger and nakednefs, combined with  
the rigors of an inclement feafon—  
nor is it neceffary to dweil on the dark  
fide of our paft affairs. Every Ame-  
rican officer and foldier mutt now  
confole himfelf for any unpleafantcir-  
cumftances which may have occurred,  
by a recollection of the uncommon  
fcenes in which he has been called  
to aét no inglorious part, and the

on the ftage of human action, nor can  
they probably ever happen again,  
ho has before feen a diferplined  
  
Forw  
army formed at once from fuch raw ma-  
  
terials? Who that was not a witnels,  
could imagine, that the moft violent  
local prejudices would ceafe fo foon,  
and that men who came from the dif-  
ferent parts of the continent, ftrongly  
difpoted, by the habits of education,  
  
to defpife and quarrel with each other,  
would inftantly become but one pe  
triotic band of brothers ? or wi  
that was not on the f{por, can trace the  
fteps, by which fuch awonderful reve  
lution has been effetted, and fuch  
  
glorious period put to-atlour warlike

It is univerfally acknowleged that  
the enlarged profpetts of happinefs,  
opened by the conhrmation of our in-  
dependence and fovereignty, almoft  
exceed the power of defcription :  
and fhall not the brave men who have  
contributed fo effentially to thefe in-  
eflimable acquifitions, retiring vitio-  
rious from the field of war to the field  
of agriculture, participate in all the  
blefings which have been obtained ?  
In fuch a —. who will exclude  
them from the rights of citizens, and  
the fruits of their labours ? In fucha  
country, fo happily circumflanced, the  
purfuits of commerce and the cultiva-  
ton of the foil will unfold to indultry  
the certain road to competence. To  
thofe hardy foldiers, who are attuated  
by the {pirit of adventure, the fitheries  
will aford ample and prohtable em-  
  
loyment ; and the extenlive aid fer-  
tile regions of the weit will yield a  
molt happy afylum to thofe, who, fond  
of domeltic enjoyment, are feeking for  
  
rfonal independence. Nor is it pof-  
fible to conceive that any one of the  
united ftates will prefer a national  
bankruptcy, and a Jiffolution of the  
union, to a compliance with the requi-  
fitions of congrefs, and the payment  
of its jut debts—fo that the officers  
and foldiers may expect confiderable  
alliance, in recommencing their civil  
occupations, from the fums due to  
them from the public, which mutt and  
will moft inevitably be paid.  
  
In order to ettect this defirable pur-  
pole, and to remove the sabadions  
which may have taken poffefiion of the  
minds ofany ofthe good people of the  
lates, it is earneltly recommended to  
all the troops, that, with ftrong at-  
tachments to the union, they fhould  
carry with them into civil fociety the  
moft conciliating difpofitions ; and  
that they fhould prove themfelves not  
lefs virtuous and ufeful as citizens  
than they have been perfevering and  
vittorious as foldiers. What though  
there fhould be fome envious indivi-  
duals, who are unwilling to pay the  
debt the public has contratted, or to  
vield the tribute due to merit, yet let  
fh unworthy treatmeut produce no  
invective, or any inftance of mtem-  
perate conduét—let it be remembered,  
that the unbiaffed voice of the free  
atzens of the united ftates has pro-  
mifed the juft reward, and given the  
  
Vor, IV. No, III,  
  
merited applaufe—let it be known and  
remembered, that the reputation of the  
federal armies is eftablifhed beyond  
the reach of malevolence, and let a  
confcioufnefs of their achievements  
and fame flill incite the men who com-  
pofed them, to honourable actions, un-  
der the perfuafion, that the private  
virtues danccait prudence, and in-  
duftry, will not be lefs amiable in ci-  
vil life, than the more fplendid quali-  
ties of valour, perfeverance and enter-  
prize, were in the field. Every one  
may reft affured that much, very much  
of the future happinets of the officers  
and men, will depend upon the wife  
and manly ‘conduct which fhall be  
adupted by them, when they are min-  
Bled with the great body of the com-  
munity, Aud although the general  
has fo frequently given it as his opi-  
nion, m the molt public and explicit  
manner, that unlefs the principles of  
the federal government were properly  
fupported, and the powers of the uni-  
onincreafed, the honour, dignity, and  
jultice of the nation would be loft for  
ever: yethe cannot help repeating on  
this occafion fo interefting a fentiment,  
and leaving it as his laft injunction to  
every officer and every foldier, who  
may view the fubjett in the fame fe-  
rious point of light, to add his belt en-  
deavours, to thofe of his worthy fel-  
low-citizens, towards effecting thefe  
great and valuable purpofes, on which  
our very exiftence as a nation fo ma-  
terially depends,  
  
The commander in chief conceives  
little is now wanting to enable the  
foldier to change his military charac-  
ter into that of the citizen, but that  
fteady and decent tenor of behaviour,  
which has generally diftinguifhed, not  
only the army under his immediate  
command, but the different detach-  
ments and feparate armies, throug  
the courfe of the war. From their  
good fenfe and prudence he antici-  
pates the Ton confequences—and  
while he congratulates them on the  
glorious occafion which renders their  
fervices in the field no longer necef=  
fary, he wifhes to exprefs the ftrong  
obligations he feels himfelf under, for  
the afhftance he has received from

ral takes this laft and folemn oppor-  
tunity of profeffing his inviolable at-

the following elegant and pathetic  
farewell addrefs, to the officers  
and foldiers, under his command,  
The United States in congrefs  
affembled, after giving the moft  
honourable teftimony to the  
federal armies, and prefenting  
them with the thanks of their  
country, for their long, eminent,  
and faithful fervices—having  
thought proper, by their procla-  
mation, bearing date the 18th of  
October lait, to difcharge fuch  
part of the troops as were engaged  
for the war, and to permit the  
oficersop furlough to retire from  
lervice, fromand ater to-morrow,  
which proclamation having been  
communicated in the pub Tie pa-  
pers for the information and  
government of all concerned—  
it only remains fer the comman-  
der in chief to addrefs himielf  
ence more, and that, for the laft  
time, to the arimies of the United  
Seaces (however widely di iperfed  
the Ladividuals who col ppofed  
  
them may be) and to bid them an  
atlectionate—a long farewell,  
  
But before the commander in  
chief takes his final leave of thofe  
he holds most dear, he withes to  
indulge himfeif a few moments  
in calling to mind a flight review  
of the paft—he will then take  
the liberty of exploring, with  
his military friends, their future  
profpects—ofadviling the general  
line of conduét, which, in his  
opinion, ought to be purfued ;  
and he will conclude the addrets,  
by expreiling the obligations he  
feels himfelf under for the fpirited  
and able affiftance he has experi-  
enced from them, in the perfor-  
mance of an arduous office.  
  
A contemplation of the com-  
plete attainment, at a period  
earlier than could have been ex-  
pected, of the object for which  
we contended, againft fo formi-  
dable a power, cannot but in{pire  
us with aflonifhment and grati-  
tude. The difadvantageous cir-  
cumftances on our part, under  
which the war was undertaken,  
can. never be forgotten. The  
fingular interpotfitions of provi-  
dence in our feeble condition,  
were fuch ascould f{carcely efcape  
the attention of the moit unob-  
ferving—while the unparalleled  
perfeverance of the armies of the  
United States, through almoit  
every poflible fuffering and dil-  
couragement, for the fpace of  
eight long years, was little fhort  
of a ftanding miracle.  
  
Ir is not the meaning, nor  
within the compas of thisad idrets,  
to detail the hardthips peculiarly  
incident to our fervice, or to  
deferibe the diftrefles, which, in  
fevers! inftances, have refulted  
from the extremes of hunger and  
nakednefs, combined with the  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
i798]  
  
rigors of an inclement feafon—  
nor is it neceflary to dwell on the  
dark fide of our paft affairs. Every  
American officer and foldier muft  
now confole himfelf for any un-  
pleafant circumftances which may  
have occurred by arecollection of  
the uncemmon fcenes in which  
he has been called to act no in-  
glorious part, and the aftonifhing  
events of which he has beena  
witnefs ; events which have fel-  
dom, if ever before, taken place  
on the {tage of human action, nor  
can they probably ever. happen  
again. For who has before feen  
a difciplined army formed at once  
from fuch raw materials? Who  
that was not a witnefs, could  
imagine, that the moft violent  
local prejudices would ceafe fo  
foon, and that men who came  
from the different parts of the  
continent, ftrongly difpoted, by  
the habits of education, to defpife  
and quarrel with each other,  
would inftantly become but on  
patriotic band of brothers? or  
vho that was not on the fpor,  
can trace the fteps, by which  
fuch a wonderful revolution has  
been effected, and fuch a glorious  
period put to all our warlike roils ?  
It is univerially acknowledged  
that the enlarged  
happinefs, opened by the confir-

fuch a country, fo happily cir-  
cumflanced, the purfuits of com-  
meree and the cultivation of the  
foil will unfold to induftry- the  
certain road to competence. To  
thofe hardy foldiers, who are ac-  
tuated by the fpirit of adventure,  
the fifheries will afford ample  
and profitable employment; and  
the extenfive and fertile regions  
of the weit will yield a moft hap-  
py alylum to thefe, who, fond of  
domeftic enjoyment, are feeking  
for perfonal independence. Nor  
is it poihble to conceive that any  
one of the United States will pre-  
fer a national bankruptcy, and a  
diffolution of the union, to a com-  
pliance with the requifitions of  
congrefs, and the payment of its  
juit debts—fo that the officers

In order to effect this defirable  
purpofe, and tu remove the pre-  
judices which may have taken  
pofleflion of the minds of any of  
the xood people of the {tates, it is  
earneiily recommended to all the  
troops, that, with itrong attach-  
micuts to the union, they fhould  
carry with them intro civil fociety  
the moft conciliating difpolitions;  
aud that they thould prove them-  
felves not lefs virtuous and ufe-  
ful as chizens, than they have  
been pertevering and victorious  
as foldiers. What though there
