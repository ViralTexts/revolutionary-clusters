,  
Philadelphia 24th of the 9th. mo. 1798  
  
I hope I may address the first magistrate in the United States in this Stile without Offence, as I do esteem him my friend, and have a due respect unto him, &amp; for the Office he fills; sincerely desiring to conduct myself under his Administration in every respect consistent with my conscience, as a good &amp; faithful Citizen ought to do.  
I therefore inform the President, that being in this City in order to attend our Annual Solemnity at the stated time for holding it, my mind has been deeply affected under a consideration of the awful situation or state of things, and the awful Judgments (as I believe) of an offended God, now display’d conspicuously over this City, thro’ the grievous mortality suffered on its Inhabitants, as well as in divers other places &amp; in different ways, very visible to the believing mind:—I say, awful, for so it has felt to me, a little like taking my life in my hand to come hither, singly to endeavour in my small measure, to promote the cause of Righteousness in the Earth.  
I have been dipped into serious thoughtfulness concerning the cause, and believe it is time for the inhabitants of the United States to be generally concerned on this wise; And what impressed my mind with considerable weight about then days ago, hath been revived, vizt. As I was riding the road from the Eastern Shore of Virginia to my residence in the Delaware State, thro’ one County in Maryland, having a pretty full account given me of the abominable Trade carried on through that part of the Country, by Negroe–Drovers, buying Drove after Drove of the poor afflicted Blacks, like droves of Cattel for Market; carrying them into the Southern States for Speculation; regardless of the separation of nearest Connections &amp; natural ties: Thinking on the subject, I was deeply afflicted under a Sense of the Guilt hereby brought on our Nation, which seemed to me, if the Practice continued, was likely to produce punishment on the Government, Rulers and those in Authority, who did not exert themselves for the suppression of this cruel Practice. As thoughts of this kind revolved, a reflection took place in my mind, that perhaps the President as prime Magistrate in the United States, may be entirely without the knowledge of this atrocious &amp; abominable Crime; whereupon I determined that if way opened, and I felt myself authorized, (as I believe I now do) I would advertize thee, and modestly wern thee to pay attention to the subject, to do thy Duty, discharge thyself; if though failest herein, thou mayst have Cause to repent when it may be too late: It may be urged thou hast no Constitutional Power to do any thing in this Business, and that the general Government has none; be that as it may, I leave it; but I believe this conduct in the Citizens of America has a tendency to offend the Majesty of Heaven, and draw on us his righteous Indignation, which I believe is, and ought to be, more dreaded then all the power of the French Nation. I well remember when in my minority to have seen an Old Magazine, in which was inserted the Message of a Governor at Boston, to the General Court there, on the Approach of War, with a recommendation on the subject of making Restitution to the People called Quakers for injuries formerly done to some of that Society; or an Atonement therefor; with a query, How they could expect prosperity in engaging with Enemies without so doing? Would to God our President might be Animated with a like disposition, to call the consideration of our Legislature to this grievous part of the Oppression of our fellow–man, the Blacks in this Land: Would it not be acceptable to him, “By whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice”? He can turn &amp; overturn Kingdoms and Nations at his pleasure: And feeling earnest desires for the welfare of our Nation, and the Stability of it’s Government, I am disposed thus to lend my little aid, and to labour in the small Ability I am favoured with, to promote the “Righteousness which exalteth a Nation, and to banish that Sin from among us, which is a Reproach, or Shame to any People.” And oh, saith my soul, that the disposition of our President might in a suitable degree, be like that of the King of Niniveh, who on receiving a divine Message or warning, manifested so much Humility, that he arose from his Throne, laid his Robe from him, &amp; covered himself with Sackcloth, and Ashes; proclaiming to the People to cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, &amp; from the violence that is in their hands, saying, who can tell if God will not turn from his fierce Anger, that we perish not:” Their Conduct and humiliation appears to have answered the End, &amp; saved the City at that time: Is there not cause for us to be concern’d on this wise? as I believe we shall have to feel, in a more general way the Effects of Divine Displeasure: I hope and trust I am addressing one who is favoured to know how to treat sacred Things, and who will give those Hints the weight they may be found to deserve: And, may I remind the President, that we are threatned with War; Do we not feel heavily in some parts, the dreadful effects of something that (I believe) may be called the Pestilence? And may we not also admit, we have some threatnings sufficient to induce us to consider, that the same Hand that hath done so much, may easily break the whole Staff of bread. In how large a part of our Land is the principal wheat destroy’d? While so large a part of my fellow–citizens go on confiding in their own strength, as though they neither feared God, nor regarded man! View the Scenes of Dissipation that are in the Land, by Plays, Sports, and revellings, among a People who, by their Representatives a few years back, declared to all the World, and (as I consider it) before the Majesty of Heaven, that “it was self-evident all men were created equal; that they were endow’d by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, among which are Life, Liberty &amp;c”: Now to say nothing about the continuing to withhold from so great a part of our fellow-man, the unalienable Right with which they are endow’d by their Creator, What can we think, on serious Reflection, will be the Consequence to this Country, if the before mention’d barbarous Trade &amp; Traffick is continued? I feel it at times almost sufficient to burst a human Heart; Then how will that God who is just &amp; Merciful view those Actions? Oh that thou mayst feel me; I hope thou wilt.  
An, may I presume to tell thee further, I am indeed afraid thou hast fixed a Stigma on thy Presidency, by giving Sanction to a Law that opens, if I am not mistaken, a wide field to this infamous Traffic, to a new Country back of Georgia: Please accept the freedom I use, as coming from a real Friend of thine, and of his Country; And who craves that God Almighty may mercifully grant Wisdom to guide thee, for thy Country’s Welfare, and thy own solid Peace.  
I remain with Christian Sympathy and due respect / Thy real Friend

Philadelphia, 9th mo., 24th, 1798.  
  
RESPECTED FRIEND :—I hope I may address  
the first magistrate of the United States in this  
style, without in the least degrading him in his  
station, as [ do esteem him wy friend, and am  
well assured I have a due respect for him and  
for the station he fills ; sincerely desiring to con-  
duct myself under his administration in every re-  
spect consistent with my conscience, as a good  
and respectful citizen ought todo. I therefore  
inform the President that being in this city to  
attend our Annual Solemnity at the stated time  
for holding it, my mind has been deeply affected  
uuder a consideration of the awful situation of  
the state of things, and the awful judgments of  
an offended God (as I believe,) now conspicuous-  
ly over this city ; by the grievous mortality suf-  
fered to affect its inhabitants;* as well as on  
divers other places in different ways, very visible  
to the believing mind. I say aw/ul, for soit has  
felt to me, a little like venturing my life to come  
hither, singly to endeavor, in my small measure,  
to promote the cause of righteousness in the  
earth; and having been dipped into serious  
thoughtfulness about the cause, I believe it is  
time for the inhabitants of the United States  
generally to be on this wise concerned. And  
whatimpressed my mind with considerable weight  
about ten days ago, after riding the road from  
the eastern shore of Virginia through Maryland,  
to my residence in Delaware State, hath been  
again revived. I had pretty full account given  
me of the abominable trade carried on through  
that part of the country by negro drivers, buy-  
ing drove after drove of the poorafiflicted blacks,  
like drovs of cattle for market; carrying them  
into the Southern States for speculation, regard-  
less of the separation of nearest connections and  
naturalities. It raised such indignation in my

breast that I concluded, indeed, if I kad the  
sovereign power, and there was no appeal from  
my decree, nor any other power that could punish  
such a crime, that I would punish this nation as  
a nation ; that I would punish this Government;  
yea, I thought I would not exempt the President,  
its first magistrate ; but this reflection occurred—-  
perhaps he may be entirely without the know-  
ledge of this atrocious and abominable crime,  
which determined me, if I felt myself authorized  
(as I believe I now do), to advertise thee thereof,  
and modestly warn thee to pay attention to this  
subject, and to do thy duty. If thou failest there-  
in, thou mayst have cause to repent, when, per-  
haps, it may be too late.  
  
It may be urged thou hast no constitutional  
power to do anything in this business, and that  
the General Government has none. Be that as  
it may, I believe this conduct hath a tendency to  
offend the majesty of Heaven; and to draw down  
upon us righteous judgment. I am now free to  
mention, that I remember to have seen an old  
magazine, in which was inserted the message of  
a Governor of Boston, to the General Court there,  
recommending to their notice the subject of mak-  
ing restitution, or endeavor to do something as  
an atonement for injuries which had been done  
to the people called Quakers; containing also a  
query, how they could expect to prosper against  
their enemies without so doing. Would to God  
our President might be animated with the like  
disposition to call the consideration of our Legis-  
lature to this subject respecting this grievous op-  
pression of our fellow men, the blacks, in this land.  
I fully believe it would be acceptable to the Lord,  
‘¢by whom kings rule and princes decree justice.”  
He in his omnipotence can turn and overturn  
kingdoms, nations and countries at his pleasure.  
  
And feeling my mind deeply engaged in fre-  
quent earnest breathings for the welfare of my  
nation and the stability of its Government, I be-  
lieve it my duty thus to lend my little aid.and to  
labor in the ability afforded, to promote that  
righteousness which exalts a nation! and to  
banish that sin (from among us) which is a  
shame to any people. And oh! saith my soul,  
that the disposition of our President might be  
like that of the king of Nineveh, who, on the ap-  
proach of Jonah, manifested so much humility,  
that he arose from his throne, laid his robe from  
him, covered himself with sackcloth and sat in  
ashes, &amp;c., causing it to be proclaimed through  
Nineveh, that the people might cry mighti-  
ly unto God, saying, “ Let them turn every one  
from his evil way, and from the violence that is  
in his hands ; who can tell if God will turn and  
repent, and turn away from his fierce anger that  
we perish not.” It appears that their conduct  
in humbling themselves answered the end and  
saved the city at that time. Now, I do verily  
believe, that there is cause for us to be concerned  
on this wise, lest otherwise we may have to feel,  
  
INTELLIGENCER.  
  
  
  
  
  
yet in a more general way, the effects of Divine  
displeasure. I hope and trust I am addressing  
one who is favored with a knowledge how to treat  
sacred things, and who will be willing to give  
these hints the weight they may deserve. I could  
also remind the President, that we are threatened  
with war—in some parts we have felt heavily the  
dreadful effects of something which I believe may  
be called the pestilence, and do not these threaten-  
ings induce us to consider that the hand which  
hath done so much, could as easily break the  
“‘ whole staff of bread.” In how large part of  
our land is the principal wheat destroyed? yet a  
large part of our fellow-citizens go on confiding  
in their own strength and sufficiency ; manifest-  
ing that they neither fear God nor regard man.  
Behold the various scenes of dissipation, plays,  
and other sports and revelings which lead to the  
misspending precious time among a people who,  
a few years back, by their representatives, de-  
clared to the world, and I consider it before the  
Majesty of Heaven, that it was “self-evident that  
all men were created equal; that they were en-  
dowed by their Creator with certain inalienable  
rights, among which were life, liberty,” &amp;. Now  
to say nothing about continuing to withhold from  
so great a part of our fellow men, this inalienable  
right with which they are endowed by their Cre-  
ator, what can we think, on serious reflection, will  
be likely to follow in this country if the above  
mentioned barbarous trade and traffic is continued?  
I fecl the subject at times as if it was almost  
sufficient to burst a human humane heart ; then  
how will the God of mercy and justice view those  
actions? QO! that thou may feel the depth of my  
concern ; I hope thou wilt doso in good measure.  
I may tell thee further, that Iam afraid thou  
hast fixed a stigma on the Presidency, by giving  
sanction to a law, which, if I am not mistaken,  
opens a wide field to this infamous traffic, to a  
new country back of Georgia. Please to accept  
the freedom I use with thee as coming from a  
real friend of thine and his country, and who  
craves that God Almighty may mercifully grant  
wisdom to guide thee for thy country’s welfare,  
and thy own solid peace, under which I remain  
with Christian sympathy and sincere respect thy  
cordial friend, WARNER MIFFLIN
