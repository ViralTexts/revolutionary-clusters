Respected Sir  
Monticello  
June 24. 26  
The kind invitation I recieve from you on the part of the citizens of the city of Washington, to be present with them at their celebration of the 50th anniversary of American independance; as one of the surviving signers of an instrument, pregnant with our own, and the fate of the world, is most flattering to myself, and heightened by the honorable accompaniment proposal for the comfort of such a journey. it adds sensibly to the sufferings of sickness, to be deprived by it of a personal participation in the rejoicings of that day. but acquiescence is a duty, under circumstances not placed among those we are permitted to controul. I should indeed, with peculiar delight, have met and exchanged there, congratulations personally, with the small band, the remnant of that host of worthies, who joined with us, on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we were to make, for our country, between submission, or the sword; and to have enjoyed with them the consolatory fact that our fellow citizens, after half a century of experience and prosperity, continue to approve  the choice we made. may it be to the world what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all.) the Signal of arousing men to burst the chains, under which Monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings &amp; security of self government. the form which we have substituted restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. all eyes are opened, or opening to the rights of man. the general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born, with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of god. these are grounds of hope for others. for  ourselves let the annual return of this day, for ever refresh our recollections of these rights and an undiminished devotion to them.I will ask permission here to address the pleasure with which I should have met my ancient neighbors of the City of Washington and of it’s vicinities, with whom I passed so many years of a pleasing social intercourse; an intercourse which so much relieved the anxieties of the public cares, and left impressions so  deeply engraved in my affections, as never to be forgotten. with my regret that ill health forbids me the gratification of an acceptance, be pleased to recieve for yourself and those for whom you write the assurance of my highest respect and friendly attachments.Th: Jefferson

Respected Sir: The kind invitation 1 received  
from you on tw« P«..i ot the cl lzens of the city j  
ol Washington, lobe present with them at their  
celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Ame­  
rican independence, as one of the surviving  
signers of an instrument pregnant with our  
own, and the fate of the world, is most flatter­  
ing to myself, and heightened by the honorable  
accompaniment proposed for the comlort of  
such a journey. It adds sensibly to the suffer­  
ings of sickness, to he deprived by it of a per­  
sonal participation in the rejoicings of that day,  
but acquiesence is a duty, under circumstances  
not placed among those we are permitted to  
control. I should, indeed, with peculiar de­  
light, have met and exchanged there, congra­  
tulations personally, with the small band, the  
remnant of that host of worthies, w ho joined  
with us, on that day, in the bold and doubtful  
election we were to make for our country, be­  
tween submission and the sword; and to have  
enjoyed with them the consolatory fact that our  
fellow-citizens, alter half a century of experi­  
ence and prosperity, continue to approve the  
choice we made. May it be to the world, what  
I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to  
  
others later, hut final’v to all*) the signal ol a­  
rousing men to burst the chains under which  
monkish ignorance and superstition had per­  
suaded them to bind themselves, and to assume  
the blessings and security &lt;&gt;f self-government.  
&#x27;I he form which we have substituted restores  
the free right to the unbounded exercise of rea­  
son, and freedom of opinion. All eyes are o­  
pened, or opening, to the rights of man. The  
general spread of the lights of science has al­  
ready laid open to every view the palpable truth  
that the mass of mankind has not been born  
with saddles on their backs, net- a favored few  
booted and spurred, ready to ride them legiti­  
; mutely, by the grace of God. These are grounds  
of hope for others -for ourselves, let the annual  
return of this day forever refresh our recollec­  
tions of these rights, and an undiminished de­  
! votion to them.  
1 will ask pea mission here to express the  
pleasure with which I should have met my an­  
| cient neighbors of the city of Washington and  
its vicinities, with whom I passed so many  
l years of a pleasing social intercourse; an in­  
tercourse which so much relieved the anxieties  
of the ,public cares, and left impressions so  
deeply engraved in my affections, as never to

Monticello, June 24, 1826.  
Respretep Sir: The kind invitation | receiv-  
  
jed from you, on the part. of the citizens of the C:-  
  
ty of Washington, to be present with them at their  
celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Ameri-  
can Independence, as one of ihe surviving signers  
of an instrument, pregnant with our own and the  
fate of the world, is most flattering to myself, and  
heightened by the honorable accompaniment pro-  
posed for the comfort of such a journey. It adds  
sensibly tothe sufferings of sickness, to be depriv-  
ed by it of a personal participation in the rejoic-  
ings of that day; but acquiescence is aduty under  
  
circuinstances not placed among those we are per- |  
  
mitted to contro}. [ should, indeed, with peculiar  
  
delight, have met and exchanged there congraiue |  
lations, personally, with the small baad, the rem- |  
nant of that host of worthies who joined with us, |  
  
on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we  
were to make, for our country, between subimis-  
sion and the sword; and to have enjoyed with  
them the consolatory fact that our feliow citizens,  
alier half a eentury of experience and prosperity,  
continue to approve the en we made.  
  
be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some  
parts soouer, to others later, but finally to all,) the  
signal of arousing men to burst the chains, under  
which monkish ignorance and superstition had  
persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume  
the agers 4 and security of self-government. ‘The  
form which we have substituted restores the free  
right tothe unbounded exercise of reason and  
freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened or op-  
ening tothe rights of man. The general spread  
of the lights of science has already laid open to ev-  
ery view the palpable truth, that the mass of man-  
kind has not been born with saddles on their backs,  
nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to  
ride them legitimately, by the grace of God.—  
These are grounds of hope tor others; for ourselves,  
let the annua) return of this day torever retresh  
  
our recollections of these rights, and an undimin- |  
| ished devotion to them.  
  
I will ask permission here to express the plea-  
sure with which I should have met my ancient  
  
| neighbors of the City of Washington and its vicin- ,  
it}, With whom f passel so many years of a pleas-&#x27;

Monticello, Juu®&#x27;24, 1826.  
Respected Sir : The kiml iuv^tatiou  
I received from you, on thSpptft of the  
citizens of the City erf Washington, to be  
present with them ayjbeir celebration of  
the Fiftieth Anniversary of American In­  
dependence,^ one of the surviving sign­  
ers of an instrument, pregnant with our  
own and the fate of the world, is ipost flat­  
tering to myself, and heightened by the  
honorable accompaniment proposed for the  
comfort of such a journey. It adds sensi­  
bly to the sufferings of sickness, to be de­  
prived by it of a personal participation in  
the rejoicings of that day: but acquies­  
cence is a duty under circumstances not  
placed among those we are permitted to  
control. , I should, indeed, with peculiar  
delight, have met and exchanged there con­  
gratulations, personally,with the small band,  
the remnant of that host of worthies, who  
joined with us, on that day, in the hold and  
doubtful election we were to make, for our  
country, between submissiou and the sword; j  
and t® have enjoyed with them the consol­  
atory fact that our fellow-citizens, after  
half a century of experience and prosperi­  
ty, continue to approve the choice wepiade.  
May it be to the world, what I* belibvo it  
will be, (to some parts sooner, to others la­  
ter, but finally to all,) the signal of arous­  
ing men to burst the chains, uuder which  
monkish ignorance and superstition had  
persuaded tHfem to bind themselves, and to  
assume the blessings and security of self­  
government. The form which we have  
substituted restores the free right to the  
unbounded exercise of reason and freeddtai  
of opinion. All eyes are opened, or open­  
ing to the rights of man. The general  
spread of the lights of science has already  
laid open to every view the palpable truth,  
that the mass of mankind has not been  
born with saddles on their backs, nor a fa­  
vored few, booted and spurred, ready to  
jrido them legitimately, by the grace of God.  
These are grounds of hope for others, %  
ourselves, let the annual return of this day  
forever refresh our recollections of these  
rights, and an undimiuished devotion to  
them.

pleasure with which I should have met my  
ancient neighbours of the City of Wash­  
ington and its vicinities, with whom I pas­  
sed so many years of a pleasing social in­  
tercourse—an intercourse which so much  
relieved the anxieties of the public cares,  
and left impressions so deeply engraved in  
my affections, as never to be forgotten.  
With my regret that ill health forbids me  
the gratification of an acceptance, be plea­

est respect and friendly attachments.

of the city of Washington, to be present with them at their Fiftieth Anni-  
versary of American Independence, as one of the surviving signers of an  
instrument pregnant with our own and the fate of the world, is most flat-  
tering tomyself, and heightened by the honourable accompaniment pro-  
posed for the comfort of such a journey. It adds sensibly to the sufferings  
of sickness, to be deprived by it of a personal participation in the rejoicing  
of that day ; but acquiescence is a duty under circumstances not placed  
among those we are permitted to control. I should, indeed, with peculiar  
delight, have met and exchanged their congratulations, personally, with the

the consolatory fact that our fellow-citizens, after half a century of expe+  
rience and prosperity, continue to approve the choice we made. May it

later, but finally to all) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains  
under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to  
bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-govern-

Monticello, June 26, &#x27;26.   
Respected Sir— The kind invitation I   
received front you on the part of the citi­  
zens of the city of Washington, to be pre­  
sent with them at the celebration of the   
50th Anniversary of American Indepen­  
dence, as one of the serviving signers of an   
instrument, pregnant with our own, and   
the fate of the world, is most flattering to   
myself, and heightened by the honorable   
accompaniment prop( Bed for the comfort   
of such a journey. It adds sensibly to the   
&#x27; Buffering! of sickness, to be deprived by it   
of a personal participation in the rejoicings   
of that day, but acquiescence is a duty.   
under circumstances not placed among   
those we are permitted to controul. I   
I should indeed, with pectili•ri delight, have   
met and exchanger these congratulations   
personally, with the small band, the rem­  
nant of that host of worthies, who joined   
with us on that _day, in the bold and doubt­  
ful election we were to make for our coon   
try, between submission or the sword; and   
to have enjoyed with them the consolato­  
-1 ry fact that our fellow citizens, after Leif   
a century of experience and prosperity,   
1 continue to apprave tl e choice we made.   
May it he to the world what I believe it   
will be, (or some parts sooners, to others   
rater, but finally to all,) the signal of arous•   
ing men to buret the chains, under which   
monkish i.rnorance and superstition had   
persuaded them to bin f themselves, and to   
assume the blessings and security of self   
government. The form which we have   
substituted restores the free right to the

of opinion. All eyes are opened or open­

MonticELLO, June 21, 1825. Respected Sir: The  
kind invitation I received from you on the part  
of the citizens of the city of Washington to be  
present with them at their celebration of the  
  
fistieth anniversary of American independence  
as one of the surviving signers of an instrument  
pregnant with our own and the fate of the world  
is most flattering to myself, and heightened by  
the honorable accompaniment proposed for the  
comforts of such a journey. It adds sensibly to  
the sufferings of sickness to be deprived by it of  
a personal participation in the rejoicings of  
that day, but acquiescence is a duty under  
circumstances not placed among those we  
are permitted to control. I should, indeed, with  
peculiar delight, have met and exchanged these  
Congratulations personally with with the small  
band, the remnant of that host of worthies who  
soined with us, on that day, in the bold and doubt  
ful election we were to make for our country, be  
tween submission and the sword; and to have en  
joyed with them the consolatory fact that our  
fellow citizens, after half a century of experience  
and prosperity, continue to approve tee choice we  
made. May it be to the world, what I believe it  
will be (to some parts sooner, to others later  
but finally to all), the signal of arousing men  
to burst the chains under which monkish  
ignorance and superstition had persuaded  
them to bind themselvs, and to assume  
the blessings and security of self  
The form which we have substituted re  
  
stores the free right to the unbounded exercise of  
  
reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are  
opened or opening to the rights of man. The gen  
eral spread of the lights of science has already  
laid open to every view the palpable truth that  
the mass of mankind has not been born with  
saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted  
and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by  
the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for  
others,-for our-elves let the annual return of this  
day forever refresh our recollections of their  
rights and an undiminished devotion to them  
I will ask permission here to express the pleas  
ure with which I should have met my ancient  
neighbors of the city of Washington and its vicin­  
ities, with whom I passed so many years of a  
pleasant social intercourse--an intercourse which  
so much relieved the anxieties of the public cares  
and left impressions so deeply engraved on my  
flections as never to be forgotten. With my  
  
gret that ill health forbids me the gratification of  
an acceptance, be pleased to receive for yourself  
and those for whom you write the assurance of  
  
my highest respect and friendly attacnment

Monticella, June 24 1826.  
Respected Sir: -,  
Xne kind invitation I received from  
yon on the part of the citizens of  
Washington to be present with them  
at theii celebration of the fiftieth an  
niversary of American independence,  
as one of the surviving signers of an  
instrument pregnant with our own and

to myself, and heightened by the honor  
able accompaniment proposed for the  
comfort of such a journey., It adds  
sensibly to the suffering of sickness to  
be deprived by it of a personal partici  
pation in the rejoicing of that day, but  
acquiesence is a duty under circum  
stances not placed among those we are  
permitted to control. I should, indeed,  
with peculiar delight, have met aud  
exchanged these congratulations per­  
sonally with the small band, the rem

them the consolatory fact that our fel-  
ow citizens, after half a century of

be (to some parts sooner, to others  
later, but finally to all,) the signal of  
arousing men to burst the chain under  
which monkish ignorance .and super

the palpable truth that the mass of

there congratulations personally with the  
small band, the remnant of that host of  
worthies who joined with us on that day

to make for ouir country, between sub­  
mission or the sword; and to have enjoyed  
with them the consolatory fact that our  
fellow citizens, after half a century of ex­  
perience and prosperity, continue to ap­

which ignorance and superstition had per­  
suaded them to bind themselves, and to

government. That form which we have  
substituied restores the free right to the  
unbounded exercise of reason and freedom

For ourselves, let the annual return of this
