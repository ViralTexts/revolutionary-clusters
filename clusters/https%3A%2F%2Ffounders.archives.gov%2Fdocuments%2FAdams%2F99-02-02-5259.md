The federalists, I think, might suffer my old lamp to go out without administering their nauseous oil, merely to excite a momentary flash before it expires.  
Do you think the federalists believe themselves when they say that I am on the side of the executive, through the whole of his administration?—Do they believe that I approve of the repeal of the Judiciary law, which I recommended to Congress? which I believe to be one of the best laws ? which was made by the advice and repeated solicitations of the Judges for several years? which I took infinite pains to organize with a selection of the ablest and fairest characters in the nation? a repeal which I have always believed to be a violation of the constitution? Do they believe that I approve of the neglect and mismanagement of the navy? the omission

Amidst the low murmers of submissive fear  
And mingled rage, my Hampden rais’d his voice,  
And to the laws appealed.  
Mingled rage and fear are now the predominant passions of our nation, and such is the noise and fury that the still, small voice of Reason cannot be heard. If I were only forty years old I might have Enthusiasm enough to hope that I could ride in the whirlwind But at seventy three it would be a delirium.  
I have nothing to hope or wish but repose, and they will not allow me even that small consolation.   
As I am not consulted by any party or any Individual I take no share and but very little interest in the approaching election. Hamilton’s Ambition, intrigues and Caucuses have ruined the cause of rational federalism by encumbering and entangling it with men and measures that ought never to have been brought forward. I have no objection to Pinckney, but a full persuasion that he never can rise to the chair, and

 it.  
As you have mentioned my son, I shall only take the liberty to say that his conduct as far as I know it, has been able, upright, candid, impartial &amp; Independent. His letter to Mr Otis I applaud and admire. His resignation I approve. He would have been more politic if he had declined his invitation to the caucus, though the question was only between Mr Madison and Mr Monroe, and, knowing both, I should certainly as he did prefer the former to the latter. The policy of a limitation to the Embargo is, in a national view, and on a large scale, a nice question. I should probably have been for it, but there is so much to be said on the other side, that I cannot censure my son, for agreeing to it without a limitation, believing as he did, and had reason to believe, that it would soon be repealed. The Federalists by their intolerance have gone far towards justifying or at least excusing Jefferson for his, and for the future it seems to be established as a principle that our Government is forever to be, not a national, but a party Government. How long such a maxim can be maintained, consistently with any civil government at all, time will determine. While it lasts, all we can hope is that in the Game at Leap Frog once in eight or twelve years, the party of the Outs will leap over the head and shoulders of the Ins, for I own to you I have so little confidence in the wisdom, prudence, or virtue of either party that I should be nearly as willing that one party should be unchecked &amp; absolute as the other.
