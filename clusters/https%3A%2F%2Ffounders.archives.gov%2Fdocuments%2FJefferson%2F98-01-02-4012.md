Sin—I have read with much satisfaction the  
sermon of Mr. Pierpont, which you have been  
so kind as to send me, and am much pleased  
with the spirit of brotherly forbearance in mat­  
ters of religion which it breathes, and the sound  
distinction it inculcates between the things  
which belong to us to judge, and those which  
do not. If all Christian sects would rally to the  
sermon in the mount, make that the central  
point of union in religion, and the stamp of  
genuine Christianity, (since it gives us all the  
  
precepts of our duties to one another) wh) ’  
should we further ask, with the text of oui  
Sermon, ‘What think ye of Christ*? and if one  
should answer ‘he is a member of the godhead, ^  
another ‘he is a being of eternal pre-existence,  
a third he was a man divinely inspired,* a  
fourth ‘he was the Herald of truths reformatory  
of the religions of mankind in general, but more  
immediately of that of his own countrymen,  
impressing them with more sublime, and more  
worthy ideas of the Supreme Being, teaching  
them the doctrine of a future state of rewards  
and punishments, and inculcating the love of  
mankind, instead of the anti-social spirit with  
which the Jews viewed all the other nations,*  
what right, or what interest has either of these  
respondents to claim pre-eminence for his dog­  
ma, and usurping the judgment seat of God, to  
condemn all the others to his wrath? In this  
case I say, with the wiser heathen, ‘deorum  
injuriae diis curae.*  
You press me to consent the publication  
of my sentiments, and suppose they might have  
effect even on Sectarian bigotry. But have  
they not the Gospel? If they hear not that, and  
the charities it teacheth, neither will they be  
persuaded though one rose from the dead.  
Such is the malignity of religious antipathies,  
that although the laws will no longer permit  
them, with Calvin, to burn those who are not  
exactly of their creed, they raise the hue and  
cry of Heresy against them, place them under  
the Ban of public opinion, and shut them out  
from all the kind affections of society. I must  
pray permission therefore, to continue in quiet  
during the short time remaining to me: and at  
a lime of life when the afflictions of the body  
weigh heavily enough, not to super-add those  
which corrode the spirit also, and might weak­  
en its resignation, to continue in a joyless state  
of being, which Providence may yet destine.  
With these sentiments, accept those of good  
will and respect to yourself.

Monticello, Jan. 26, 1824.  
Sir: 1 have read with much satis­  
faction the sermon of Mr. Pierpont,  
which you have been so kind as to  
send me, and am much pleased with  
the spirit of brotherly forbearance in  
matters of religion which it breaths,  
and the sound distinction it inculcates  
between the things which belong to us  
to judge, and those which do not. If  
all Christian sects would rally to the  
Sermons in the Mount, make that the  
central point of union in religion, and  
the stamp of genuine Christianity,  
(since it gives us all the precepts of our  
duties to one another) why should we  
further ask, with the text of our Ser­  
mon, ‘What think ye of Christ:’ and  
if one should answer ‘he is a member  
of the Godhead,’ another ‘he is a be­  
ing of eternal pie existence,’ a third,  
he was a man divinely inspired,’ a  
fourth ‘he Was the Herald of truths re­  
formatory of the religions of mankind  
in general, but more immediately of  
that of his own countrymen, impres­  
sing them with more sublime, and  
more worthy ideas of the Supreme be­  
ing, teaching them the doctrine of a  
future stale of rewardsand punishment,  
and inculcating the love of mankind,  
instead of the anti social spiiit with  
which the Jews viewed all other na­  
tions,’ what right, or what interest has  
either of these respondents to claim  
pre eminence for his dogma, and u­  
surping the judgment seat of God, to  
condemn all the others to his wrath?  
In the ease I say, with the wiser hea.  
then, ‘deorum injuriae diiscurae.’  
You press me to consent to the pub­  
lication of my sentiments, and suppose  
they might have effect even on Secta­  
rian bigotry. But have they not the  
Gospel? If they hear not that, and  
the charities it teacheth, neither will  
they be persuaded though one arose  
from the dead. Such is the maligni­  
ty of religious antipathies that,&#x27;although  
the laws will no longer permit them,  
with Calvin, to burn those who are nol  
exactly of their creed, they arise the  
hue and cry of hersey against them,  
place them under the ban of public o­  
pinion, and shut them out from all the  
kind affections of society. I must pray  
permission, therefore, to continue in  
quiet during the short time remaining  
to me, and, at a lime of life when the  
afflictions of the body weigh heavily  
enough, not to superadd those which  
c«rrode the spirit also, and might wea­  
ken its resignation to continue in a  
joyless state of being, which Provi­  
dence may yet destine With these  
sentiments, accept those of good will

make that the central point of union in reli j |

(since it gives us all the precepts of our du- j

ask, with the text of our sermon 1 what think ;  
ye of Christ?* and if one should answer 4 he i  
is a member of the God-head,* another, «he  
is a being of eternal pre-existence,* a third, |  
&#x27; he was a man divinely inspired,&#x27; a tourth, !

state of rewards and punishments, and in- f

Monricello, Jan. 20, 1524  
Sta I have read with much satisfaction  
the sermon of Mr. Pierpont, which you have  
been so kind as to send me, &amp; am much plea-  
sed with the spirit of brotherly forbearance  
in matters of religion which it breathes, and  
the sound distinction it inculcates between  
the things which belong to us to judge, and  
those which do not. If all christain sects  
would rally to the Sermon in the mount,  
make that the central point of union in re­  
ligion, and the stainp of genuine christianity,  
(since it gives us all the Precepts of our du­  
ties to one another) why should we forther  
ask, with the text of our Sermon, &quot;What  
think ge of Christ&quot; and if one should answer  
&quot;he is a member of the Godhead&quot;, anoth­  
he is a being of eternal pre existence,&quot; a  
third &quot;he was a man divinely inspired,&quot; a  
fourth he was the Herald of truths refor­  
matory of the religions of mankind in gener­  
eral, but more immediately of that of his  
own countrymen, impressing them with  
the Supreme being, teaching them the doc­  
trine of a future state of rewards and pun­  
ishments, and inculcating the love of man­  
kind, instead of the anti-social spirit with  
which the Jews viewed all other nations,&quot;  
what right or what interest has either of  
these respondents to claim pre-eminence  
for his dogma, and usurping the judgement-  
seat of God, to condemn all the others to  
his wrath? In this case I say, with the  
wiser heathen, &quot;deorum injuriae dits  
curae.&quot;  
You press me to consent to the publica­  
tion of my sentiments, and suppose they  
might have effect even on Sectarian bigotry.  
Bat have they not the gospel! If they  
hear not that, and the charites it teacheth,  
neither will they be persuaded through one  
rose from the dead. Such is the malignity  
of religious antipathies that, although the  
laws will no longer permit them, with Cal­  
vin, to burn those who are not exactly of  
their Creed, they raise the hue and cry of  
Heresy against them, fplace them under the  
Ban of public opinion, and shut them out  
from all the kind affections of society. I  
must pray permission therefore, to continue  
in quiet during the short time remaining to  
me; and at a time of life when the afflic­  
tions of the body weigh heavily enough not  
to super add those which corrode the spirit  
also, and might weaken its resignation, to  
continue in a joyless state of being, which  
providence may yet destine. With these  
sentiments, accept those of good will and re­  
spoct to yourself.
