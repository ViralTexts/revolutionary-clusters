Sir  
Monticello  
Feb. 25. 24  
The kindness of the motive which led to the request of your letter of the 14th inst. and which would give some value to an article from me, renders compliance a duty of gratitude. knowing nothing more moral, more sublime more worthy of your preservation than David’s description of the good man, in his 15th psalm, I will here transcribe it, from Brady and Tate’s version.Lord, who’s the happy man that may To thy blest courts repair,Not, stranger-like, to visit them, But to inhabit there?’Tis he, whose every thought and deed By rules of virtue moves;Whose generous tongue disdains to speak The thing his heart disproves.Who never did a slander forge His neighbor’s fame to wound;Nor hearken to a false report By malice whispered round.Who vice, in all it’s pomp and power, Can treat with just neglect;And piety, tho’ cloathed in rags, Religiously respect.Who to his plighted vows and trust Has ever firmly stood;And tho’ he promise to his loss, He makes his promise good.Whose soul in usury disdains His treasure to employ;Whom no rewards can ever bribe The guiltless to destroy.The man who by this steady course Has happiness ensured,When earth’s foundation shakes, shall stand By providence secured.

 him  
socially and professionally every day. in your  
hands I leave his eulogy. Dr. Robinson’s life  
was a consistent one. The attributes of his  
mind were pure and noble. Truly can wo say of  
him that in all things he was faithful. His sym  
pathetic nature and kindness of heart made him  
tho confidant of youth, the refuge of the sick  
and sorrowful. Truly the world is better for his  
having lived. His life was beautiful, his end  
peace. Now that ho has passed Into the shadow  
world, we say from our hearts, &quot;Heboid an hon­  
est man. A conscientious physician has entered  
into bis reft. Peace to his ashes.”  
Lord, who’s the happy man that may  
To thy blest courts repair;  
Not stranger like to visit them  
But to Inhabit there?  
’Tls ho who walketh uprightly.  
Whom righteousness directs.  
Whoso generous tongue disdains to speak  
Tho thing his heart rejects.  
Who never did a slander forge  
His neighbor&#x27;s fame to wound.  
Nor hearken to a false repott  
By malice whispered round.  
Who vice. In all its pomp and power.  
Can treat with Just neglect.  
And piety, thougo clothed in rags.  
Religiously respect.  
Who, to his plighted vows and trust  
Has ever firm ly stood.  
And though h-; promise to his loss  
Hu makes his promise good.  
Whoso soul In usury disdains  
Has treasure to employ :  
Whom no rewards can ever bribe  
The guiltless to destroy.  
Tho man. who by this righteous com it*.  
Has huppim-ss insured,  
When earth’s foundation shakes shall stand  
By providence secured
