Dear Sir  
Monticello Aug. 1. 16  
  
Your two philosophical letters of May 4. and 6. have been too long in my Carton of ‘Letters to be answered.’ to the question indeed on the utility of Grief, no answer remains to be given. you have exhausted the subject. I see that, with the other evils of life, it is destined to temper the cup we are to drink.  
Two urns by Jove’s high throne have ever stood,  
The source of evil one, and one of good;  
From thence the cup of mortal man he fills,  
Blessings to these, to those distributes ills;  
To most he mingles both.

oment of pain. I think, with you, that life is a fair matter of account, and the balance often, nay generally in it’s favor. it is not indeed easy, by calculation of intensity  
			 and  
			 time, to apply a common measure, or to fix the par between pleasure and pain: yet it exists, and is measurable. on the question, for example, whether to be cut for the stone? the young, with a  
			 longer  
			 prospect of years, think these overbalance the pain of the operation. Dr Franklin, at the age of 80, thought his residuum of life, not worth that price. I should have thought with him, even taking the stone out of the scale. there is a ripeness of time for death,  
			 regarding others as well as ourselves, when it is reasonable we should drop off, and make room for another growth. when we have lived our generation out, we should not wish to encroach on  
			 another. I  
			 enjoy good health; I am happy in what is around me. yet I assure you I am ripe for leaving all, this year, this day, this hour
