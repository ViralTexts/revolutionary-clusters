I return thanks for the pamphlet you have been so kind as to send me on the subject of Commonwealths. it’s moral principles merit entire approbation, it’s philanthropy especially, and it’s views of the equal rights of man. that, on the principle of a communion of property, small societies may exist in habits of virtue, order industry and peace, and consequently in a state of as much happiness as heaven has been pleased to deal out to imperfect humanity, I can readily concieve, and indeed have seen it’s proofs in various small societies which have been constituted on that principle. but I do not feel authorised to conclude from these, that an extended society, like that of the US. or of an individual state, could be governed happily on the same principle. I look to the diffusion of light and education as the resource most to be relied on for ameliorating the condition, promoting the virtue and advancing the happiness of man. that every man shall be made virtuous, by any process whatever, is indeed no more to be expected, than that every tree shall be made to bear fruit, and every plant nourishment. the briar and bramble can never become the wine and olive; but their asperities may be softened by culture, and their properties improved to usefulness in the order and economy of the world.  and I do hope,  in the present spirit of extending to the great mass of mankind the blessings of instruction, I see a prospect of great advancement in the happiness of the human race; and that this may proceed to an indefinite, altho’ not to an infinite degree. wishing every success to the views of your society which their hopes can promise, and thanking you most particularly for the kind expressions of your letter towards myself, I salute you with assurances of great esteem and respect.Th: Jefferso

Mosticeuo, Oct. 22,1882.  
  
Sib:—l return thanks for. the pamphlet yon  
have been so kind as to send me on the subject  
of Commonwealths. Its moral principles meet  
entire approbation; its philanthropy especially;  
and its views of the equal rights of man, that  
on tho principle of communion of property,  
small societies may. exist in habits of rirtuo,  
order, industry and peace, and conseqnently/in  
a state of as much happiness as heaven lias been  
pleased to deal out to imperfect humanity. Vi:  
can readily conceive, and indeed have seen its  
proofs in various small societies which have boon  
constituted on that principle, but Ido not feel  
authorised to conclude , from these, that an ex­  
tended society like that of the United States, or  
of an individual State, could be governed happi­  
ly on the same principle. I look to the diffu­  
sion of light and education as tho resource most  
to. be relied on, for ameliorating the condition,  
promoting the virtue, and advancing tho happi­  
ness of: man. That every man shall he made  
virtuous by any process whatever,: is indeed no  
more to be expected than that every tree ebullbe  
made to bear fruit, and every plant nourishment.  
The briar and . bramblo can never become the  
vino and olive ; but their nsperities.may bo soft­  
ened by culture, and their properties improved  
to usefulness in tho order and economy of the  
world, and I do hope in the present spirit of ex­  
tending to the great mass of mankind tho bless­  
ings of instruction, I see a prospect of* great  
advancement in the happiness of tho human  
race, and that may : proceed to an indefinite al­  
though not to an infinite degree. Wishingevory  
successto the views of your society which tficir  
hopes can promise, and thanking you most par-.;  
ticularly for tho kind expressions of your letter  
towards myself, 1 salute you : with assurances of  
great esteem and respect.
