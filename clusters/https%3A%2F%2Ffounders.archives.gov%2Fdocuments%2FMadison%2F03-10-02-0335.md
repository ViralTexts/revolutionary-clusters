, March 21, 1816  
  
The Secretary of the Treasury, to whom the President of the United States, referred the resolution of the 29th of February 1816, requesting, that there be laid before the House of Representatives, “a statement of the cases, in which he has employed, or caused to be employed, Counsel to assist the Attorney General prosecuting causes in the Supreme Court of the  
  
United States; stating as nearly as may be, the amount of the property in dispute, in each case, the names of the Counsel so employed, the period of employing them, and the compensation granted to them in each case; also, the manner of making such compensation, and the fund out of which the same was paid,” has the honor to present the following  
Report:  
⟨That it⟩ appears to have been the practice of the ⟨Governmen⟩t, to employ Counsel, to assist the Attorney ⟨General,⟩ and, also, the District Attornies, in cases of great importance, either as to the principle, or ⟨as to the⟩ value, involved in the controversy. Thus, for ex⟨ample,⟩ so early as February term 1796, of the Supreme Court, ⟨Alexander⟩ Hamilton received a fee of 500 to as⟨sist the⟩ Attorney General in maintaining the affirmative ⟨upon⟩ the question, respecting the constitutionality of the ⟨carriage⟩ tax; and Alexander Campbell and Jared Ing⟨ersoll,⟩ Counsel maintaining the negative, received a f⟨ee of⟩ 233.33/100 Dollars, under an agreement, that, ⟨for the⟩ purpose of obtaining a final decision, the U⟨nited⟩ States should pay all the expenses, incident to ⟨the⟩ transfer of the cause, from the Circuit Court ⟨to the⟩ Supreme Court.  
That, on the 24th of March, 1⟨804⟩, in obedience to a Resolution of the House of ⟨Repr⟩esentatives of the 3d. of the same Month, the ⟨Secretary⟩ of the Treasury presented a statement “of a⟨ll the⟩ monies which since the establishment of the p⟨resent⟩ government had been paid at the Treasury ⟨of the⟩ United States, as fees to Assistant Counsel ⟨and for⟩ legal advice in the business of the United S⟨tates, in⟩ which were distinguished the several sums, ⟨when paid,⟩ for what services, and to whom paid respecti⟨vely,”⟩ amounting, in the whole, to the sum of 502⟨2.16.⟩  
That the Statement hereunto an⟨nexed,⟩ marked A, contains a like specificatio⟨n of all the mon⟩ies paid, or payable, at the Treasury of the ⟨United⟩ States, from the 24th of March 1804, until ⟨the pres⟩ent time, for the employment of Counsel ⟨to assis⟩t or to represent, the Attorney General, in ⟨causes de⟩pending in the Supreme Court of the United ⟨States,⟩ amounting, in the whole, to the sum of $4540.  
That this Department does not possess ⟨the means⟩ of stating the amount of the property in ⟨dispute in⟩ each case, in which Assistant Counsel ⟨has been⟩ employed in the Supreme Court; but it ⟨is confident⟩ly believed, from general information, that ⟨in every⟩ such case, either the value of the property was ⟨great, or⟩ the principle of the controversy was import⟨ant or⟩ the employment of Assistant Counsel, in the ⟨cases of⟩ sickness or other casualties, was essential to ⟨the publ⟩ic interests, as will more particularly appear ⟨by the no⟩tes accompanying the Statement A.  
That the manner of making the compensa⟨tion to⟩ the Assistant Counsel has uniformly been, ⟨by issui⟩ng the Warrants of the Secretary of the ⟨Treasur⟩y, founded upon the official settlement of ⟨the Comp⟩troller and  
  
Auditor; and by paying the ⟨amount,⟩ either out of the Appropriation, annually ⟨passed⟩ by Congress, “for the discharge of such ⟨miscell⟩aneous claims against the United States, not ⟨otherwise⟩ provided for, as shall have been admitted ⟨in due⟩ course of settlement at the Treasury”; or out ⟨of the appropriations annually made⟩ “for the ⟨discharge of such demands against the⟩ United States, ⟨on account of the civil departme⟩nt, not otherwi⟨se provided for, as shall have been⟩ admitted in ⟨due course of settlement at the Tr⟩easury.” All ⟨which is respectf⟩ully submitted.  
  
A.J. Dall⟨as,⟩Secretary of the ⟨Treasury

March 22, 181G.  
The Secretary of the Treasury, to whom  
the President of the United States refer­  
red the resolution of the £9th f Febru­  
ary, 181G, requesting that there be laid  
before the House of Representatives, “ a  
statement of the cases in which he has  
employed, or caused to be employed,  
counsel to assist the attorney general in  
prosecuting the causes in the Supreme  
Court ol the United States ; statin&quot;- as  
nearly as may be, the amount ol the pro­  
perty in dispute in each case, the names  
ol the counsel so employed, the period  
employing them, and the compensa­  
tion granted to them in each case ; also,  
the manner ol making such compensa­  
tion, and the lund out of which the same  
was paid ,” has the honor to present the  
following Report:  
  
inai ii appears to liave been the practice  
of the government, to employ counsel to  
assist the attorney-general, ii also the dis­  
iiict attorneys, in cases ut great impor­  
tance, either as to the principle, or as to  
the value involved in the controversy.  
I hus, for example, so early as February  
term 1790, ol the supreme court, Alexan­  
der Hamilton received a fee of 500 dollars  
io assist the attorney-general in maintain­  
ing the aflii matiye upon the question re­  
jecting tlic. constitu tiooality of the carriage  
tax ; and Alexander Campbell and Jared  
tngersoll, counsel maintaining the nega­  
tive, received a fee of g233 33cts. under  
an agreement, that for the purpose of ob­  
taining a final decision, the United States  
should pay all the expences, incident to  
the transfer of the cause from the circuit  
court to the supreme court.  
That on the 24(h of March, 1804, in obe­  
dience to the resolution of the House of  
Uepresentatives of the3d of the same month  
th Secretary of the &#x27;Treasury presented a  
statement « of all the moneys which, since  
the establishment of the present govern­  
ment, had been paid at the Treasury of the  
United States, as fees to assistant counsel,  
and for legal advice in the business of the  
U nited States ; in which were distinguish­  
ed the several sums, when paid, for what  
services, and to whom paid rcs|&gt;ectively j’*  
amounting in the whole, to the sum of 5.  
022 16 dollars.  
That the statement hereunto annexed  
marked A, contains a like specification of  
all the moneys paid, or payable at the  
Treasury of the United States, from the  
24th of March, 1804, until the present  
time, for the employment o* counsel to as­  
sist, or to represent, the attorney-general,  
in causes depending in the supreme court  
of the United States, amounting, in the  
whole, to the sum of 4,540 dollars.  
That this department docs not possess  
the means of stating the amount of the pro  
  
»erty in dispute, in each ca*c, in which ns­  
dstant counsel has been employed in the  
tprenie court; but it is confidently believ­  
* I, (mm general information, that in every  
-ut h case, either the value of the property  
.vas great, or the principle of the contro­  
versy was important; or the einplovment  
»f assistant counsel, in the cases of sick­  
ness, or other casualities, was essential to  
the public interests, as will more particu­  
larly appear by the notes accotnpanvinu&#x27;  
statement A. J &#x27; °  
That the manner of making the compen­  
sation to the assistant counsel, has uni­  
formly been, hy issuing the warrants of the  
Secretary of the Treasury, founded upon  
the official settlement of the comptroller  
and auditor ; and by paying the amount,  
either out of the appropriation, annually  
passed by Congress, “ for the clichargc o‘t&#x27;  
such miscellaneous claims against the Uni­  
ted States, not otherwise provided for, as  
shall have been admitted indue course of  
settlement at the Treasury or out of the  
appropriations annually made “ for the dis­  
charge of such demand&#x27;s against the United  
States, on account of the civil department,  
not otherwise provided for. as shall have  
been admitted in due course of settlement  
at the Treasury.”  
All which is respectfully submitted.  
A. J. DALLAS,  
Secretary oj the Treasury

SATURDAY, MAY 18, 1816. 183  
  
li The Secretary of the Treasury, to whom the Pre-  
  
sident of the United States referred the resolu-  
  
tion of the 29th of February, 1816, requesting  
  
that there be laid before the House of Represen-  
tatives, “a statement of the cases in which he  
has employed, or caused to be employed, coun-  
  
scl to assist the attorney-general prosecuting™ .  
  
causes in the supreme court of the United  
  
States ; stating, as nearly as may be, the amount  
  
of the property in dispute in each case, the names  
  
of the counsel so employed, the period of em-  
  
ploying them, and the compensation granted -9  
  
them in each case; also, the manner of making  
  
such compensation, and the fund out of which  
the same was paid,” has the honor to present the  
following report :  
  
Tiiat it appears to have been the practice of the  
government to employ counsel to assist the attorney-  
general, and also the district attorneys, in cases of  
great importance, cither as to the principle or as  
to the value involved in the controversy. Thus,  
for example, so early as February term, 1796, of  
the supreme court, Alexander Hamilton received  
a fee of 500 dollars to assist the attorney-general  
in maintaining the affirmative upon the question  
respecting the constitutionality of the carriage  
tax; and Alexander Campbell and Jared Ingersoll,  
counsel maintaining the negative, received a fee ot  
$233 33 cts. under an agreement, that for the  
purpose of obtaining a final decision, the United  
States should pay all the expenses incident to the  
transfer of the cause from the circuit court to the  
supreme court.  
  
That on the 24th of March, 1804, in obedience  
to aresolution of the House of Representatives of  
the Sd of the same month, the secretary of the  
treasury presented a statement “ of all the monies  
which, since the establishment of the present go-  
vernment, had been paid at the treasury of the  
United States, as fees to assistant counsel, and for  
legal advice in the business of the United States ;  
in which were distinguished the several sums, when  
paid, for what services, and to whom paid respec-  
tively,” amounting, in the whole, to the sum of  
§5.022 16.  
  
That the statement hereunto annexed, marked  
A, contains a like specification of all the monies  
paid, or payable at the treasury of the U. States,  
from the 24th of March, 1804, until the present  
time, for the employment of counsel to assist, or  
io represent the attorney-general, in causes depend-  
ing in the supreme court of the United States,  
wmuiunting, in the whole, to the sum of 4,540 dol-  
Ines.  
  
‘That this department does not possess the means  
of stating the amount of the property in dispute, in  
each case, in which assistant counsel has been em-  
ployed in the supreme court; but it is confidently  
beheved, from general information, that in every  
such case, either the value of the property was  
great, or the principle of the controversy was im-  
portant, or the employment of assistant counsel, in  
the cases of sickness or other casualties, was essen-  
tial to the public interests, as will more particular.  
ly appear by the notes accompanying statement A.  
  
That the manner of making the compensation to  
the assistant counsel has uniformly been, by issu-  
ing the warrants of the secretary of the treasury,  
founded upon the official settlement of the comp-  
troller and auditor; and by paying the amount,  
  
  
  
  
  
by congress, “for the discharge of su
