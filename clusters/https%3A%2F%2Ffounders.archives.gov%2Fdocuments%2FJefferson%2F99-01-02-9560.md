War Depfiartment,  
January 18, 1809.  
SIR,  
  
The pressure of the embargo  
although sensibly felt by every  
description of our fellow citizens,  
has yet been cheerfully borne by  
most of thei, under a conviction  
that it was a temporary evil, and  
a necessary one to save us from  
greater and more permanent  
evils, the loss of property and  
surrender of rights: but it would  
have been more cheerfully borne  
but for the knowledge that, while  
honest men were religiously ob-  
serving it, the unprincipled along  
our sea-coasts and frontiers, were  
fraudulently evading it: and that  
in some parts they had even dar-  
ed to break through it openly by  
an armed force too powerful to  
be opposed by the collector and  
his assistants.  
  
To put an end to this scanda-  
lous insubordination to the laws,  
the legislature has authorized the  
president of tue United States to  
empower proper persons to cm-  
ploy militia for preventing or sup¢  
pressing armed or riotous assem-  
blages of persons resisting the  
custo., -house officers ti the ex-  
ercise of their duties, or oppos-  
ing or violating the embargo  
laws. He sincerely hopes that  
during the short time these re-  
strictions are expected to con-  
tinue, no other instances will  
take place of a crime of so deep  
adic. But it is made his duty,  
to take the measures necessary  
to mect it. He has directed me,  
therefore, to request you, .s com-  
munding officer of the militia of  
your state, touppoint some oilicer  
of the militia, of known respect  
for the jaws, in or near to each  
port of entry within your state,

Thus authorized and called on

[ Sir,  
The pressure of the embargo, although  
sensibly felt by every description of our fel­  
low citizens, has yet been cheerfully borne  
by most of them, under a conviction that it  
wus a temporary evil, and a necessary one  
to save us from greater and more permanent  
evils, the loss of property and surrender of  
rights: but it would have been more cheer­  
fully borne but fur the knowledge that,  
while honest men were religiously observing

and that in some parts they had even dared
