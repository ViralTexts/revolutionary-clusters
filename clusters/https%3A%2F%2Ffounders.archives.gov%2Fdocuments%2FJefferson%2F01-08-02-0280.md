Sir  
Paris Aug. 7. 1785.  
  
Your favor of July 2. came duly to hand. The concern you therein express as to the effect of your pamphlet in America, induces me to trouble you with some observations on that subject. From my acquaintance with that country I think I am able to judge with some degree of certainty of the manner in which it will have been received. Southward of the Chesapeak it will find but few readers concurring with it in sentiment on the subject of slavery. From the mouth to the head of the Chesapeak, the bulk of the people will approve it in theory, and it will find a respectable minority ready to adopt it in practice, a minority which for weight and worth of character preponderates against the greater number, who have not the courage to divest their families of a property which however keeps their consciences inquiet. Northward of the Chesapeak you may find here and there an opponent to your doctrine as you may find here and there a robber and a murderer, but in no greater number. In that part of America, there being but few slaves, they can easily disencumber themselves of them, and  emancipation is put into such a train that in a few years there will be no slaves Northward of Maryland. In Maryland I do not find such a disposition to begin the redress of this enormity as in Virginia. This is the next state to which we may turn our eyes for the interesting spectacle of justice in conflict with avarice and oppression: a conflict wherein the sacred side is gaining daily recruits from the influx into office of young men grown and growing up. These have sucked in the principles of liberty as it were with their mother’s milk, and it is to them I look with anxiety to turn the fate of this question. Be not therefore discouraged. What you have written will do a great deal of good: and could you still trouble yourself with our welfare, no man is more able to give aid to the labouring side. The college of William and Mary in Williamsburg, since the remodelling of it’s plan, is the place where are collected together all the young men of Virginia under preparation for public life. They are there under the direction (most of them) of a Mr. Wythe one of the most virtuous of characters, and whose sentiments on the subject of slavery are unequivocal. I am satisfied if you could resolve to address an exhortation to those young men, with all that eloquence of which you are master, that it’s influence on the future decision of this important question would be great, perhaps decisive. Thus you see that, so far from thinking you have cause to repent of what you have done, I wish you to do more, and wish it on an assurance of it’s effect. The information I have received from America of the reception of your pamphlet in the different states agrees with the expectations I had formed.—Our country is getting into a ferment against yours, or rather have caught it from yours. God knows how this will end: but assuredly in one extreme or the other. There can be no medium between those who have loved so much. I think the decision is in your power as yet, but will not be so long. I pray you to be assured of the sincerity of the esteem &amp; respect with which I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedt. humble servt.,  
  
Th: Jefferson

“Paris, August 7, 1785.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
“To Docror Price:  
  
“Sir; Your favor of July 2d, came duly to hand. The  
concern you therein express as to the effect of your pam-  
phiet in America, induces me to troub!e you with some ob-  
servations on that subject. [Doctor Price, it seems, had  
written, and sent to the United States, an “incendiary” pam-  
phlet, on the “sublime merits” of slavery !] From my ac-  
quaintance with that country, I think I am able to judge with  
some degree of certainty, of the manner in which it will have  
been received. Southwaid of the Chesapeake, it will find  
but few readers concurring with it in sentiment on the sub-  
ject of slavery. From the mouth to the head of the Chesa-  
peak, the bulk of the people will approve it in theory, and it  
will find a respectable minority ready to adopt it in practice:  
a minority which, for weight and worth of character, pre-  
ponderates against the greater number, who have not the  
courage to divest their families of a property, which, howev-  
er, keeps their consciences uneasy. Northward of the  
Chesapeake, you may find, here and there, an opponent to  
your doctrine, as‘ you may find, here and there, a murderer;  
but in no greater number. In that part of America, there  
being but few slaves, they can easily disencumber themselves.  
of them; and emancipation is put into such atrain, that, in  
a few years, there will be no slaves northward of Maryland.  
In Maryland I do not find such a disposition to begin the  
redress of the enormity, as in Virginia, &quot;This is the next  
state to which we may turn our eyes, for the interesting  
spectacle of justice in conflict with avarice and oppression;  
aconflict wherein the sacred side is gaining daily recruits  
from the.influx into office of young men, grown, and,  
growing up... These have sucked in the principles of Jiberty  
with their mothers milk and it is to them I look, with anx-  
iety, to turn the fate of this question, Be not therefore  
discouraged. What you have written, will do a great deal of  
good; and could you still trouble yourself with our welfare,  
no man is more able to give aid to the laboring side, The

Pan&#x27;s, Aug. 7, 1785.  
Sir : Your favor of July 2d came du­  
ly to hand. The concern you therein ex  
press as to the effect of your pamphlet in  
America, induces me to trouble you with  
some observations on that subject. From  
my acquaintance with that country.l think  
I am able to judge with some degree of  
certainty of the manner in which it will  
have been received. Southward of the  
Chesapeake, it will find but few readers  
concurring with it in sentiment on the  
subject of slavery. From the mouth to  
the head of the Chesapeake, the bulk of  
the people will approve it in theory, and  
it will find a respectable minority ready to  
adopt it in praclice. A minority, .which  
for weight and worth of character, prepon­  
derates against the greater number who  
have not the courage to divest their fami­  
lies of a property, which, however, keeps  
their consciences uneasy. Northward of  
the Chesapeake, you may find here and  
there an opponent to your doctrine, as you  
may find here and there n robber and a  
murderer; but in no greater number. In  
that part of America there being but few  
slaves, tbey can easily disencumber them­  
selves of them; and emancipation is put  
into such a train that, in a fev years.lhere  
will be no slaves northward of Maryland  
In Mary land, I do not find such a dispo  
sition to begin the redress of this enormity  
as in Virginia. This is the next State to  
which we turn our eyes for the interesting  
spectacle of justice in conflict with avarice  
and oppression; a conflict wherein the  
sacred side is gaining daily recruits from  
the influx into office of young men grown  
and growing up: these&quot; have sucked in  
the principles of liberty, as it were with  
their mother&#x27;s nvlk. and it is to them that  
I look with anxiety to turn the fateofthis  
question, lie not, therefore, discouraged  
what you have written will do a irreat  
deal of good; and could you still trouble  
yourseii witu our welfare, no man is more  
able to give aid to the laboring side. The  
college ot William and Marv. in Will.  
iamsburgh, since the remodelling of its  
plan, is the place where are collected to­  
gether all the young men of Virginia, un  
der preparation for public life. They are  
there under the direction (most of them)  
of a Mr Wythe, one of the most virtuous  
of characters, and whose sentiments on  
the subject of slavery are uneoivocal. I  
am satisfied, if you could resolve to ad­  
dress an exhortation to those younr men.  
with all that eloquence of which you are  
master, that its influence on the future de  
cision of this important Question would h  
great, perhaps decisive. Thus, you see,  
that so far from thinking vbu have  
cause to repent of what you have done, I  
wisn you to do more, and wish it on an  
assurance of its effect. The information  
I have received from America of the rp.  
ception of your pamphlet in the different

formed. Thomas Jeffehrov  
Mr Jefferson&#x27;s general views unon slave.

In that part of America, there being but   
few slaves, they can easily disencumber   
themselves of them; and emancipation   
is put into such a train, that in a few years   
there will be no slaves northward of Ma­

a disposition to begin the redress of this   
enormity, as in Virginia. This is the   
next State to which we may turn our eyes   
for the interesting spectacle of justice in   
conflict with avarice and oppression; a   
conflict wherein the sacred side is gaining   
daily recruits, from the influx into office   
of young men grown and growing up,—  
These have sucked the principles of liber­  
ty, as it were, with their mother&#x27;s milk ;   
and it ie to them I look with anxiety to   
turn the fate of the question. Be not,   
therefore, discouraged. What yox have   
written, will do a great deal of good ; and   
could you still trouble yourself with our   
welfare; no man is more able to give aid   
to the laboring aide. The College of Wil­  
liam and Mary in Williamsburg, since the   
remodeling of its, plan, is the place where,   
are collected all the yonng men of Virgin­  
ia, under preparations for public life.—  
They aro under the direction (most of   
them) of a Mr. Wythe, one of the most   
virtuous of characters, and whose senti­  
ments on the subject of Slavery are une­  
quivocal. I stn satisfied, if you should   
resolve to address an exhortation to these   
young men, with all that eloquence of   
which you are master, that its influence   
on the future decision of this important   
question would be great, perhaps decisive.   
Thus you see that so far from thinking   
you have cause to repent of what you   
have done, I wish you to do more, and   
wish it on an gssurance of its effect. The   
information I have received from America,   
of the reception of your pamphlet in the   
different states, agrees. with the expecta­  
tions I have formed.   
  
I pray you to be assured of the sinceri­  
ty of the esteem and respect with which   
I have tha honor to be, Sir, your most obe­  
dient, humble servant,

“Paris, August 7, 1785.  
  
“ Sir:—Your favor of July 2d came duly to  
hand. The concern you therein express, as to  
the effect of your pamphlet in America, in-  
duces me to trouble you with some observa-  
tions on that subject.  
  
“From my acquaintance with that country,  
I think I am able to judge, with some degree  
of certainty, of the manner in which it will  
have been received. Southward of the Chesa-  
peake, it will find but few readers concurring  
with it in sentiment, on the subject of slavery.  
From the mouth to the head of the Chesa-  
peake, the bulk of the people will approve it  
in theory, and it will find a respectable mi-  
ay ready to adopt it in practice—a minority  
which, for weight and worth of character,  
preponderates against the greater number,  
who have not the courage to divest their  
families of a property which, however, keeps  
their conscience unquiet. Northward of the  
Chesapeake, you may find, here and there,  
an ges to your doctrine, as you may  
find, here and there, a robber and murderer,  
but in no greater number. In that part of  
America, there being but few slaves, they can  
easily disencumber themselves of them: and  
emancipation is put into such a train, thatin a  
few years there will be no slaves north of  
Maryland. In Maryland I do not find such a  
disposition to begin the redress of this enor-  
mity, as in Virginia. This is the next State  
to which we may turn our eyes for the inter-  
esting spectacle of justice, in conflict with  
avarice and oppression—a conflict wherein  
the sacred side is gaining daily recruits, from  
the influx into office of young men grown,  
  
and growing *. These have sucked in the  
ert  
  
principles of li , a8 it were, with their  
mothers’ milk; and it is to them I look with  
anxiety to turn the fate of this question. Be  
not, therefore, discouraged. What you have  
written will do a great deal of good; and  
could you still trouble yourself with our wel-  
fare, no man is more able to give aid to the  
laboring side. The college of William and  
Mary, in Williamsburg, since the remodelin

together all the young men of Virginia, under  
preparation for public life. They are under  
the direction (most of them) of a Mr. Wythe,
