Revd. Sir,  
Passy, May 12. 1784.  
  
I received your kind Letter with your excellent Advice to the People of the United States, which I read with great Pleasure, and hope it will be duly regarded.— Such Writings tho’ they may be lightly pass’d over by many Readers, yet if they make a deep Impression on one active Mind in an hundred, the Effects may be considerable. Permit me to mention one little Instance, which tho’ it relates to my self, will not be quite uninteresting to you. When I was a Boy, I met with a Book intitled Essays to do Good, which I think was written by your Father. It had been so little regarded by a former Possessor, that several Leaves of it were torn out: But the Remainder gave me such a Turn of Thinking as to have an Influence on my Conduct thro’ Life; for I have always set a greater Value on the Character of a Doer of Good, than on any other kind of Reputation; and if I have been, as you seem to think, a useful Citizen, the Publick owes the Advantage of it to that Book.— You mention your being in your 78th Year. I am in my 79th. We are grown old together. It is now more than 60 Years since I left Boston, but I remember well both your Father and Grandfather having heard them both in the Pulpit, and seen them in their Houses. The last Time I saw your Father was in the Beginning of 1724, when I visited him after my first Trip to Pennsylvania. He receiv’d me in his Library, and on my taking Leave show’d me a shorter way out of the House thro’ a narrow Passage which was cross’d by a Beam overhead. We were still talking as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I turning partly towards him, when he said hastily Stoop, Stoop! I did not understand him till I felt my Head hit against the Beam. He was a Man that never miss’d any Occasion of giving Instruction, and upon this he said to me, You are young and have the World before you; Stoop as you go through it,  
  
and you will miss many hard Thumps. This Advice, thus beat into my head has frequently been of use to me, and I often think of it when I see Pride mortified, &amp; Misfortunes brought upon People by their carrying their Heads too high.—  
I long much to see again my native Place, and once hoped to lay my Bones there. I left it in 1723; I visited it in 1733, 1743, 1753, &amp; 1763. In 1773 I was in England; in 1775 I had a Sight of it, but could not enter, it being in Possession of the Enemy. I did hope to have been there in 1783, but could not obtain my Dismission from this Employment here. And now I fear I shall never have that Happiness. My best Wishes however attend my dear Country. Esto perpetua: It is now blest with an excellent Constitution. May it last forever.—  
This powerful Monarchy continues its Friendship for the United States. It is a Friendship of the utmost Importance to our Security, &amp; should be carefully cultivated. Britain has not yet well digested the Loss of its Dominion over us, and has still at times some flattering Hopes of recovering it. Accidents may encrease those Hopes, and encourage dangerous Attempts. A Breach between us and France would infallibly bring the English again upon our Backs. And yet we have some wild Heads among our Country-men, who are endeavouring to weaken that Connection!— Let us preserve our Reputation by performing our Engagements, our Credit by fulfilling our Contracts, and our Friends by Gratitude &amp; Kindness; for we know not how soon we may again have occasion for all of them.  
With great and sincere Esteem, I have the honour to be, Reverend Sir, Your most obedient &amp; most humble Servant

and perverse actions. The fault is not to be al­  
cribed to his love of fame, but to his ignorance  
of what really is praiseworthy. Youth should be  
inspired with honest and generous sentiments,  
and learn to distinguish actions of real worth and  
excellence from those which catch momentary ap­  
plause from the ignorant and undifcerning. 1 he

REVEREND SIR,  
I RECEIVED your kind letter, with your excel­  
lent advice to the people of the United States,  
which I read with great and hope i.  
will be duly regarded. Such writings, though  
they may be lightly palled over by many readers,  
yet if they make a deep impression on one active  
mind in a hundred, the effects maybe confideia­  
ble. Permit me to mention one little instance,  
vhicli, tho it relates to myfelf, will not be quite  
iT.iinterelling to you. When T was a ooy I met  
with a book, entitled, &quot; Ejfaj sto do good, which  
I think was written by your father. It had been  
so little regarded by a former pollefloi, that fe­  
deral leaves of it were torn out ; but the lemairi  
  
SATURDAY, November 28, 1739-  
  
dergavenie fuchaturn of chinking as to have an  
influence on my conducft thro life ; for 1 have al­  
ways set a greater value on the character ot a  
Doer of Good, than any other kind of reputation  
—and if I have been, as you seem to think, a ufeful  
citizen, the public owesthe advantage of it to that  
book. You mention your being in your 78th year  
—I am in my 79th ;—we aregrownoldtogether.  
It is now more than 60 years lince 1 left Boston,  
but I remember, well,both your father and grand­  
father, having heard them both in the pulpit,  
and seen them in their houses. The last time I  
saw your father was in the beginning of 1 724,  
when I visited him after my firlt trip to Pennsyl­  
vania. He received me in his library, andon my  
takingleave, shewed me a shorter way out of the  
house through a narrow palfage, which was cros­  
sed by a beam over head. We were Itill talking  
as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and  
I turning partly towards him, when he said hasti­  
ly, Jloop [loop ! I did not understand liiin, till I  
felt my head hit againlt the beam. He was a  
man who never milled any occasion of giving in­  
struction, and upon this he said to me, &quot; Tou are  
young, vnd have the world before you ; stoop as Jon  
go thro it, and you &quot;will miss many hard thumps.&quot;—  
This advice, thus beat into my heart, has fre  
quently been of use to me, and I often think of  
it, when I lee pride mortified, and misfortunes  
brought upon people by their carrying their heads  
too high.  
I long much to feeagain my native place, and  
once hoped to lay my bones there. I left it in  
1723. f visited it in 1 753, 1 743, 1753, and 1763.

of it, but could not enter, it being in pofleilion of  
the enemy. I did hope to have been there in  
1 783, butcould not obtain my dismission from this  
employment here: And now, I fear, I fhallnever  
have that happiness. My belt wishes however at­  
tend my dear country, eflo perpetua. It is now

ful citizen, the public owes the advan-  
tage of it to that book.  
  
You mention your being in your 78th  
year—I am in my 79th. We are grown  
eld together. It is now more than 60  
years fince I left Bofton : but I remem-  
ber, well, both your father and grand-  
father, having heard them both in the  
pulpit, and feen them in their houfes.  
The laft time I faw your father was in  
the beginning of 1724, when I vifited  
him, after my firft trip to Pennfylva-  
mia. He received me in his library;  
and on my taking leave, fhewed me a  
fhorter way out of the houfe, through  
a narrow paflage, which was crofled by  
a beam over head. We were ftill talk-  
ing as I withdrew, he accompanying me  
behind, and I turning partly towards  
him, when he faid, haftily, ¢ ftoop,  
ftoop |!’ I did not underftand him, till  
I felt my head hit againft the beam. He  
was a man who never mifled any occa-  
fion of giving inftru&amp;tion: and upon  
this he faid to me: ‘* You are young;  
and havethe world before you: ttoop as  
you go through it; and you will mifs  
many hard thumps.” This advice,  
thus beat into my heart, has frequently  
been of ufe to me: and I often think of  
it, when I {ee pride mortified, and mis-  
tortunes brought upon people by their  
carrying their heads too high.  
  
I long much to fee again my native  
place; and once hoped to lay my bones  
there. I left it in 1723. I vifited it in  
1733, 1743, 1753, and 1763. In1773  
Iwas in England—In 1775, I hada  
ight of it ; but could not enter it being

in poffeffion of theenemy. I did hope  
to have been there in 1783; but couid  
not obtain my difmiffion from this em-  
ployment here: and now, I fear, I thall  
never have that happinefs. My beft  
wifhes, however, attend my dear  
country, ‘* effo perpetua.”” It is now  
bleft with an excellent conftitution ; may  
it laft forever |  
This powerful monarchy continues  
its friendthip for the united ftates. It  
is a friendfhip of the utmoft importance  
to our fecurity ; and fhould be careful- yy  
ly cultivated. Britain has not yet well  
digefted the lofs of its dominion over us ; ‘ot a

us and France, would infallibly bring  
the Engli®. again upon our backs +s  
and yet we have fome wild heads among  
our countrymen who are endeavouring %  
to weaken that connexion. i  
Let us preferve our reputation by per et  
forming our engagements ; our credit,  
by fulfilling our contraéts; and our a  
friends, by gratitude and kindnefs : for  
we know not how foon we may again vd Me

DOCTOR MATHER OF BOSTON.  
  
©” REV. SIR. LR Cana ,  
RECEIVED your kind letter, with your ex-  
cellent advice to the United States, which 1  
  
read with great pleaſure, and hope it will be duly

lightly paſſed over by many readers, yet, if they  
make a deep impreſſion on one active mind in a  
hundred, the effects may be conſiderable.  
  
Permit me to mention one little inſtance, which,  
though it relates to myſelf, will not be quite unin-  
tereſting to you. When I was a boy, I met with  
a book entitled, . Eſſays to do good,” which 1  
think was written by your father. It had been fo.  
little regarded by a former poſſeſſor, that ſeveral.  
leaves of it were torn out; but the remainder gave.

good, than any other kind of. reputation ; and iF

The last time I saw your father was the beginning of 1724,

I long much to see again my native place; and onee  
hoped to lay my bones there. I left it in 1723. _ I visited it  
in 1733, 1743, 1753, 1763; and in 1773 I was in England,  
In 1774 I had a sight of it, but could not enter, it being in  
possession of the enemy. I did hope to have been there in  
1783, but could not obtain my dismission from this employ«  
ment here; and now I fear I shall never have that happi-

United States, It is a friendship of the utmost importance

has not yet well digested the lovs of its dominion over us:  
and has still at times some flattering hopes of recovering it.  
Accidents may increase those hopes, and encour: er  
ous alrempts. A breach between us and France would im  
fallibly bring the English again upon our backs: and yet we  
have some wild beasts among our countrymen, who are em  
deavoring to weaken that connexion, §  
  
Let us preserve our reputation, by performing our

by gratitude and kindness: for we know not how soon we  
may again have occasion for all of them.

I have the honor to be,

Rev. Sir,—I received your kind letter,  
with your excellent advice to the people of  
the United States, which I read with great  
pleasure ; and hope it will be duly regarded.  
Such writings, though they may be lightly  
passed over by many readers, yet, if they  
make a deep impression on one active mind  
2 a hundred, the effects may be considera-  
  
e. 2  
  
Permit me to mention one little instance,  
which, though it relates to myself, will not  
be quite uninteresting to you. When I  
was a boy, [ met with a book entitled,  
‘“‘Essays to do good,” which, I think, was  
written by your father. It had {been so  
little rip ronan by a former possessor, that  
several leaves of it were torn out: but  
the remainder gave me such a turn of  
thinking, as to have an influence on my  
conduct through life: for I have always-set  
a greater value on the character of a doer  
of good, than any other kind of reputation :  
and if I have been, as you seem to think, a  
useful citizen, the public owes the advantage  
of it to that book.  
  
You mention your being in your 78th  
year—I amin my 79th. We are growing old  
together. It is now more than 60 years  
since I left Boston: but I remember, well,  
both your father and grandfather, having  
heard them both in the pulpit, and seen  
them in their houses. The last time I saw  
your father was in the beginning of 1724,  
when I visited him, after my first trip to  
Pennsylvania. He received me in his  
library ; and on my taking leave, showed  
me a shorter way out of the house, through  
a narrow passage, which was crossed by a  
beam over head. We were still talking as  
I withdrew, he accompanying me behind,  
and I turning partly towards him, when he  
said, hastily, ‘ stoop, stoop!’ I did not un-  
derstand him, till I felt my head hit against  
the beam. He was a man who never missed  
any occasion of giving instruction, and

+ {I long muclito see again my native place ;  
and once hope to lay my bones there. I[  
Jeft it in 1723. I visited it in 1733, 1748,  
1753, and 1763. In 1773 I was in England.  
In 1775, I had a sight of it; but could  
not enter, it being in possession of the  
enemy. I did hope to have been there in  
1783; but could not obtain my dismission  
from this employment here: and now, I  
fear, I shall never have that happiness.  
My best wishes, however, attend my dear  
country, “esto perpetua.” It is now blest  
‘with an excellent constitution ; may it last  
forever !  
  
This powerful monarchy continues its  
friendship for the United States. It is a  
friendship of the utmost importance to our  
security ; and should be carefully cultivated.  
Britain has not yet well digested the loss  
of its dominion over us; and has still, at  
times, some flattering hopes of recovering  
it. Accidents may increase those hopes ;  
and encourage dangerous attempts.  
breach between us and France would in-  
fallibly bring the English again upon our  
tacks ; and yet we have some wild heads  
among our countrymen, who are endeavor-  
—~ weaken that connexion.  
  
+ Let us preserve our reputation by per-  
forming our engagements ; our credit, by  
‘fulfilling our contracts ; and our friends, by  
gratitude and kindness: for we know not  
how soon we may again have occasion for  
all of them. With great and_ sincere  
esteem, I have the honor to be, Reverend  
Sir; your most obedient and most humble  
servant, B. FrRankuin.

which he thus relates in a letter to his son, Dr. Samuel  
Mather, dated Passy, 12th May, 1781: “ The last time  
I saw your father was in 1724. On taking my leave,  
he showed me a shorter way out of the house, through  
@ narrow passage, which was crossed by a beam over-  
head. We were still talking as I withdrew, he accom-

a book entitled ‘Essays to do Good,’ which I think  
was written by your father. It had been so little re-  
garded by its former possessor that several leaves of  
it were torn out; but the remainder gave me such a  
turn of thinking as to have an influence on my con-  
duct through life; for I have always set a greater  
value on the character of a doer of good than any  
other kind of reputation; and if I have been, as you  
seem to think, a useful citizen, the public owes the  
advantage of it to that book.”
