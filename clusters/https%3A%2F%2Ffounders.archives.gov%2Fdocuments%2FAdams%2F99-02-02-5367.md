				Mr. Hamilton, in his pamphlet, page 21, speaks of  
the anterior mission of Messieurs Pinckney, Marshall and Gerry, and says, “it was resolved to make another, and a more  
solemn experiment in the form of a commission of  
three.”  
When I first read this sentence, I am not certain  
whether it excited most of astonishment, indignation, contempt, or ridicule. By whom was this Measure resolved?  
By President Washington? Certainly not. If it had  
been he would have nominated the ministers. By the  
President elect, Mr. Adams? Certainly not. He had  
not been consulted. His resolutions were not known. By whom, then, was this important resolution taken?  
By Mr. Hamilton and his privy counsellors. And what  
had Mr. Hamilton and his privy counsellors to do with  
the business? And who were his privy counsellors?  
Page 22, he says, “the expediency of this step was  
suggested to Mr. Adams, through a federal channel, a  
considerable time before he determined to take it. He  
hesitated whether it could be done, after the rejection of General Pinckney, without national debasement.  
The doubt was an honorable one.” I disclaim and renounce all the honor of this doubt. I never entertained  
such a doubt for a moment. I might ask the opinion of  
twenty persons, (for I too “consulted much”) in order  
to discover whether there was any doubt in the public mind, or any party who were averse to such a measure  
or had any doubt about it. But I never had any hesitation myself. This passage, like all the rest of this pamphlet, shews that it was written from his mere imagination, from confused rumors, or downright false information.  
It is true “the expediency of the step was suggested to  
Mr. Adams,” before he took the step and before he had  
time to take it; but long after he had determined to take  
it. The mystery may be revealed. I have no motive,  
whatever others may have, to conceal or dissemble it.  
The morning after my inauguration, Mr. Fisher Ames  
made me a visit, to take leave. His period in Congress  
had expired, and the delicacy of his health, the despondency of his disposition, and despair of a re-election from  
the increase of the opposite party in his district, had induced him to decline to stand a candidate. I was no longer  
to have the assistance of his counsel and eloquence, though  
Mr. Hamilton continued to enjoy both till his death. Mr.  
Ames was no doubt one of Mr. Hamilton’s privy council,  
when he resolved to send a new commission of three.  
Mr. Ames, with much gravity and solemnity, advised me  
to institute a new mission to France. Our affairs with  
that republic were in an unpleasant and dangerous situation, and the people, in a long recess of congress must  
have some object on which to fix their contemplation and  
their hopes. And he recommended Mr. George Cabot,  
for the northern States to be one of the three, if a commission was to be sent, or alone, if but one was to go.  
I answered Mr. Ames, that the subject had almost engrossed my attention for a long time. That I should  
take every thing into serious consideration and determine  
nothing suddenly; that I should make deliberate enquiries concerning characters, and maturely consider the  
qualities and qualifications of candidates, before any thing  
was finally determined. Mr. Ames departed for Massachusetts.  
I had rolled all these things in my own mind long before. The French nation and their government were in a very umbrageous and inflammable disposition. Much  
delicacy and deliberation were necessary in the choice of  
characters. Most of the prominent characters in America,  
were as well known at Paris, as they were at Philadelphia.  
I had sometimes thought of sending Mr. Madison, and  
Mr. Hamilton to join Mr. Pinckney in a new Commission.  
I had thought of Mr. Ames himself, as well as Mr. Cabot,  
Judge Dana, Mr. Gerry, and many others in the northern,  
middle, and southern states. I thought much of Mr.  
Jefferson, but had great doubts whether the constitution  
would allow me to send the Vice President abroad. The  
nation at large had assigned him a station, which I doubted whether he had a right to abandon, or I a right to invite him to relinquish, though but for a time.  
I had great doubts about re-appointing Mr. Pinckney.  
He might have been so affected with the horrors he had  
seen or heard in France, as to have uttered some expressions, which reported by spies to the ruling powers, might  
have excited prejudices against him, which would insure  
his second rejection, and that of his colleagues too. But  
as I knew of no such accusation, I could not bear the  
thought of abandoning him. I had not time to communicate all these reflections to Mr. Ames, and, moreover,  
I had business of more importance to do. I had long  
wished to avail myself and the public of the fine talents  
and amiable qualities and manners of Mr. Madison.—Soon  
after Mr. Ames left me, I sought and obtained an interview with Mr. Jefferson. With this gentleman I had lived  
on terms of intimate friendship for five and twenty years,  
had acted with him in dangerous times and arduous conflicts, and always found him assiduous, laborious, and as  
far as I could judge, upright and faithful.—Though by  
this time I differed from him in opinion by the whole horizon concerning the practicability and success of the  
French revolution, and some other points, I had no reason  
to think that he differed materially from me with regard  
to our national constitution. I did not think that the  
rumbling noise of party calumny ought to discourage me  
from consulting men whom I knew to be attached to the interest of the nation, and whose experience, genius, learning and travels had eminently qualified them to give advice. I asked Mr. Jefferson what he thought of another  
trip to Paris, and whether he thought the constitution and  
the people would be willing to spare him for a short time?  
Are you determined to send to France? Yes. That is  
right, said Mr. Jefferson; but without considering whether the constitution will allow it or not, I am so sick of residing in Europe, that I believe I shall never go there again.  
I replied, I own I have strong doubts whether it would be  
legal to appoint you; but I believe no man could do the  
business so well. What do you think of sending Mr.  
Madison? Do you think he would accept of an appointment? I do not know, said Mr. Jefferson. Washington  
wanted to appoint him some time ago, and kept the place  
open for him a long time; but he never could get him  
to say that he would go. Other characters were considered, and other conversation ensued. We parted as good  
friends as we had always lived; but we consulted very  
little together afterwards. Party violence soon rendered  
it impracticable, or at least useless, and this party violence  
was excited by Hamilton more than any other man. I  
will not take leave of Mr. Jefferson in this place, without  
declaring my opinion that the accusations against him of  
blind devotion to France; of hostility to England; of  
hatred to commerce; of partiality and duplicity in his  
late negociations with the belligerent powers, are without  
foundation.  
From Mr. Jefferson I went to one of the heads of departments, whom Mr. Washington had appointed, and I  
had no thoughts of removing. Indeed I had then no objection to any of the secretaries. I asked him what he  
thought of sending Mr. Madison to France, with or without others? Is it determined to send to France at all?  
Determined? Nothing is determined till it is executed,  
smiling. But why not?—I tho’t it deserved consideration.—So it does; but suppose it determined, what do  
you think of sending Mr. Madison? Is it determined to  
send Mr. Madison? No; but it deserves consideration.—Sending Mr. Madison will make dire work among the passions of our parties in Congress, and out of doors, thro’  
the States! Are we forever to be overawed and directed  
by party passions? All this conversation on my part  
was with the most perfect civility, good humor, and indeed familiarity: But I found it excited a profound gloom  
and solemn countenance in my companion, which after some time broke out in “Mr. President, we are willing  
to resign.” Nothing could have been more unexpected  
to me than this observation—Nothing was farther from  
my thoughts than to give any pain or uneasiness. I had  
said nothing that could possibly displease, except pronouncing the name of Madison. I restrained my surprise, however, and only said, I hope nobody will resign:  
I am satisfied with all the public officers.  
Upon further inquiries of the other heads of departments, and of other persons, I found that party passions  
had so deep and extensive roots, that I seriously doubted  
whether the Senate would not negative Mr. Madison, if I  
should name him.—Rather than expose him to a negative,  
or a doubtful contest in the Senate, I concluded to omit  
him. If I had nominated Madison, I should have nominated Hamilton with him. The former, I knew, was  
much esteemed in France: the latter was rather an object  
of jealousy. But I thought the French would tolerate  
one for the sake of the other.—And I thought too that the manners of the one would soon wear off the prejudices against him, and probably make him a greater favorite than the other. But having given up Madison, I ought  
to give up Hamilton too. Who then should I name? I  
mentioned Mr. Dana and Mr. Gerry to the heads of departments and to many leading men in both Houses.  
They all preferred Mr. Dana. But it was evident enough  
to me, that neither Dana nor Gerry was their man. Dana  
was appointed, but refused. I then called the heads of  
departments together, and proposed Mr. Gerry. All the  
five voices unanimously were against him. Such inveterate prejudice shocked me. I said nothing, but was determined I would not be the slave of it. I knew the man infinitely better than all of them. He was nominated and  
approved, and finally saved the peace of the nation; for  
he alone discovered and furnished the evidence that X. Y.  
and Z. were employed by Talleyrand; and he alone  
brought home the direct, formal and official assurances  
upon which the subsequent commission proceeded, and  
peace was made.  
I considered Mr. Ames’s candidate, Mr. Cabot, as  
deliberately as any of the others, and with as favorable  
and friendly a disposition towards him as any other, without exception. But I knew his character and connections  
were as well known in France, particularly by Talleyrand,  
as Mr. Gerry’s were; and that there were great objections  
against the former, and none at all against the latter. It  
would be therefore inexcusable in me to hazard the success of the mission merely to gratify the passions of a party  
in America, especially as I knew Mr. Gerry, to say the  
least, to be full as well qualified by his studies, his experience, and every quality for the service, as the other.  
I afterwards nominated Mr. Cabot to be Secretary of  
the Navy, a station as useful as important, and as honorable as the other, and for which he was eminently qualified. But this he refused.  
No man had a greater share in propagating and diffusing these prejudices against Mr. Gerry than Hamilton,  
whether he had formerly conceived jealousies against him,  
as a rival candidate for the Secretaryship of the Treasury:  
for Mr. Gerry was a financier, and had been employed  
for years on the committee on the treasury in the old  
Congress, and a most indefatigable member too. That  
committee had laid the foundation for the present system  
of the treasury, and had organized it almost as well,  
though they had not the assistance of clerks and other conveniences, as at present. Any man who will look into  
the journals of the old Congress, may see the organization and the daily labors and reports of that committee,  
and may form some judgment of the talents and services  
of Mr. Gerry in that department. I knew that the officers of the treasury in Hamilton’s time dreaded to see him rise in the House upon any question of finance, because  
they said he was a man of so much influence, that they  
always feared he would discover some error or carry some  
point against them—Or whether he feared that Mr. Gerry would be President of the United States before him, I  
know not. He was not alone, however. His friends among the heads of departments and their correspondents in  
Boston, New-York and Philadelphia, sympathized with him  
very cordially in his hatred of Gerry, and of every other  
man who had labored and suffered early in the revolution.  
This preference of Mr. Gerry to Mr. Cabot was my  
first mortal offence against my sovereign heads of departments and their disciples in all the States. It never was  
or has been forgiven me by those who call themselves, or  
are called by others, “the leading men” among the federalists.  
Mr. Hamilton says, page 49, “After the rejection of Mr. Pinckney by the government of France, immediately after the instalment of Mr. Adams as President, and  
long before the measure was taken, I urged a member  
of Congress, then high in the confidence of the President, to propose to him the immediate appointment of  
three Commissioners, of whom Mr. Jefferson or Mr.  
Madison to be one, to make another attempt to negociate.”I will relate all that I can recollect relative to this subject. Mr. Tracy of Connecticut, who indeed was always  
in my confidence, came to me, I believe at the opening  
of the special session of Congress which I called soon after  
my inauguration, and produced a long elaborate letter  
from Mr. Hamilton, containing a whole system of instruction for the conduct of the President, the Senate, and the  
House of Representatives. I read it very deliberately,  
and really thought the man was in a delirium. It appeared  
to me a very extraordinary instance of volunteer empiricism thus to prescribe for a President, Senate, and House  
of Representatives all desperately sick and in a state of  
deplorable debility, without being called. And when I  
maturely considered the contents of the letter, my surprise was increased. I despised and detested the letter too  
much to take a copy of it, which I now regret. This  
letter is still in being &amp; I doubt not many copies of it  
are extant. I most earnestly request any gentleman who  
possesses one to publish it. That letter, though it had no  
influence with me, had so much with both Houses of Congress, as to lay the foundation of the overthrow of the  
federal party, and of the revolution that followed four  
years afterwards. I will endeavor to recollect as much  
of the contents of it as I can, and if I am incorrect in any  
point, those who possess the letter can, by the publication  
of it, easily set all right.  
It began by a dissertation on the extraordinarily critical  
situation of the U. States.  
It recommended a new mission to France of three Commissioners, Mr. Jefferson or Mr. Madison to be one.  
It recommended the raising an army of fifty thousand  
men, ten thousand of them to be cavalry, an army of great  
importance in so extensive a country vulnerable at so many points on the frontiers, and so accessible in so many  
places by sea.  
It recommended an alien and sedition law.  
It recommended an invigoration of the Treasury, by  
seizing on all the taxable articles not yet taxed by the  
government.—And lastly,  
It recommended a national Fast, not only on account  
of the intrinsic propriety of it, but because we should be  
very unskilfull if we neglected to avail ourselves of the religious feelings of the people in a crisis so difficult and dangerous.—There might be more, but these are all that I  
now recollect.  
Mr. Hamilton’s imagination was always haunted by  
that hedious monster or phantom, so often called a Crisis  
and which so often produces imprudent measures.  
How it happened that Mr. Hamilton’s contemplations  
coincided so exactly with mine, as to think of Mr. Jefferson or Mr. Madison for envoy to France, it may be more  
difficult to explain. But let it be considered that this letter was written long after my conversation with Mr. Jefferson, concerning himself and Mr. Madison, which was  
the morning after my inauguration; that I had communicated that conversation to one or more of the heads of  
departments the same morning. It is probable, therefore,  
that Mr. Hamilton received hints from some of his correspondents that I had thought of Madison and Hamilton,  
and that he was not displeased with the idea. I asked one  
of the heads of departments how he could account for  
Hamilton’s recommending Jefferson or Madison? “Why,  
said the gentleman, I suppose Hamilton is weary of his  
practice, as an attorney, at N. York, and is willing to  
enter into some other employment.” Mr. Hamilton,  
however, might thank those who had been his warmest  
friends for his disappointment: for had it not been for  
their opposition to Madison, I should have appointed him  
and Hamilton.  
The army of fifty thousand men, ten thousand of them  
to be horse, appeared to me to be one of the wildest extravagancies of a Knight Errant. It proved to me that  
Mr. Hamilton knew no more of the sentiments and feelings  
of the people of America, than he did of those of the inhabitants of one of the planets. Such an army without  
an enemy to combat, would have raised a rebellion in  
every state in the Union. The very idea of the expence  
of it would have turned President, Senate and House  
out of doors. I adopted none of these chimeras into my  
speech, and only recommended the raising of a few regiments of artillery to garrison the fortifications of the most  
exposed places. Yet such was the influence of Mr. Hamilton in Congress, that, without any recommendation from  
the President they passed a bill to raise an army, not a  
large one, indeed, but enough to overturn the then federal government.  
Nor did I adopt his idea of an alien or sedition law.  
I recommended no such thing in my speech. Congress,  
however, adopted both these measures. I knew there  
was need enough of both, and therefore I consented to  
them. But as they were then considered as war measures and intended altogether against the advocates of the French and peace with France, I was apprehensive that a  
hurricane of clamour would be raised against them, as in  
truth there was, even more fierce and violent than I had  
anticipated.  
Seizing on all the taxable articles not yet taxed, to support an army of fifty thousand men, at a time when so  
many tax laws, already enacted, were unexecuted in so  
many states, and when insurrections and rebellions had  
already been excited in Pennsylvania, on account of taxes,  
appeared to me altogether desperate, altogether delirious.  
I wanted no admonition from Mr. Hamilton to institute  
a national fast. I had determined on this measure long  
enough before Mr. Hamilton’s letter was written. And  
here let me say, with great sincerity, that I think there is  
nothing upon this earth more sublime and affecting, than  
the idea of a great nation all on their knees at once before their God, acknowledging their faults and imploring  
his blessing and protection, when the prospect before them  
threatens great danger and calamity. It can scarcely fail  
to have a favorable effect on their morals in general, or  
to inspire them with warlike virtues in particular. When  
most, if not all the religious sects in the nation hold such  
fasts among themselves, I never could see the force of the  
objections against making them, on great and extraordinary  
occasions, national; unless it be the jealousy of the separate states, lest the general government should become too  
national. Those however, who differ from me in opinion  
on this point, have as good a right to their judgment as  
I have to mine, and I shall submit mine to the general  
will.  
In fine, Mr. Hamilton, in the passage I have been commenting, in this letter, has let out facts, which if he  
had possessed a grain of common sense, he would have  
wished should be forever concealed. I should never have  
revealed or explained them if he, and his partizans, had  
not compelled me.

Mr.’HiMTi.Tex, &quot;m Vis pamphlet, page 21,  
rpeaks of the anterior mission of Messrs. Pink­  
ney, Marshal, and Gerry, &amp; saysj ** it was rerol­  
mnl to make another, and a more solemn ex­  
periment in the form of a commission of three”  
When 1 first read this senteivce 1 am not cer­  
tain whether it excited most of astonishment, in­  
idifjnation, contempt or ridicule. 15v rshom was  
this Measure resolve J ? By President Washing­  
ton? Certainly not. If it had been, he would  
hare nominated the ministers. By the Presi­  
dent elect, Mr. Adams 1 Certainly net—He had  
not been consulted—His resolutions were not  
known.—By whom, then, was llus important re­  
aolution taken! By Mr. Hamilton kills privy coun­  
sellors. And what had Mr. Hamilton and his  
privy counsellors to do with the business l and  
■who were his privy counsellors ?  
Page 22, lie says,&quot; the expediency ofthis step  
was suggested to Mr. Adams, through a federal  
channel, a considerable time before he determin­  
ed to take it. He hesitated whether it could be  
done, after the rejection of General Pinkney,  
without national debasement. The douhl was  
ftn honorable one.”—I disclaim k renounce all the  
honor of this doubt. 1 never entertained such a  
doubt for a moment. I might ask the opinion of 20  
persons, (for 1 too &quot; consulted much”) in order  
lo discover whether there was any doubt in the  
public miml, nr any party who were averse to  
•uch a measure or hail any doubt about it —But  
1 never had any hesitation myself.—This pas­  
sage, like all the rest of his pamphlet, shews that  
it was written from his mere imagination from  
confused rumors, or down right false informa­  
tion.  
It is true “ the expediency of the step was  
Suggested to Mr. Adams,” before he took the  
.step and before he had time to take it ; but long  
after he had the time to take it. The mystery  
may be revealed. I have no motive, whatever o­  
thers may have, to conceal or dissemble it.  
The morning after my inauguration, Mr Fish­  
er Ames made me a visit, to take leave. His pe­  
riod in Congress had expired, and the delicacy  
of his health, the despondency of his disposition  
and despair of u re-clection from the increase of  
the opposite party in his district, had induced  
Itim to decline to stand a candidate. I was no  
longer to have the assistance of his counsel or  
el oquence, though Mr.Hamilton continued to en-1  
joy both till his death. Mr. Ames was no doubt  
one of Mr. Hamilton’s privy counsel, when be re­  
solved to send a new commission of three. Mr.  
Ames with much graviy and solemnity advised  
me to institute a new mission to Fiance. Our af  
fairs with that republic were in an unpleasant and  
dangerous situation, and the people, in a long re­  
cess of Congress, must have some object on  
which to fix their contemplations and their  
liopes. And he recommended Mr George Ca­  
bot, for the northern states, to be one of the three,  
if a commission was to be sent, or alone, if but  
one was to go.  
I answered Mr. Ames, that the subject bad al­  
most engrossed my attention for a long time. That  
I should take every tiling into serious considerati­  
on and determine nothing suddenly—that I  
should make deliberate enquiries concerning !  
characters, anil maturely consider the qualities  
tmd Qualifications of candidates, before any thing  
.finally was determined. Mr. Ames departed for  
Massachusetts.  
J bad rolled all these things in my own mind  
long before. The French nation and their gov­  
ernment, were in a very umbrageous and inflam­  
mable disposition. Much delicacy and delibe­  
ration wej-e necessary in the choice of charac­  
ters. Most of the prominent characters in A- s  
mericawere as well known at Paris as they were I  
in Philadelphia. I bad sometimes thought of !  
sending Mr. Madison, and Mr. Hamilton to join \
Mr. Pinkney in a new commission. 1 had j  
thought of Mr. Ames himself, as well as Mr. j  
Cabot, Judge Dana, Mr. Gerrv, and many others J  
2u the northern, middle, and southern states. 1 I  
thought much t*f Mr. Jefferson, hut had great]  
doubts wilt the the constitution would allow me !  
to send the Vice President abroad. The nation  
at large had assigned him a station, which I  
doubted whether lie hail a right to abandon, or I  
a right to invite him to relinquish, though blit for  
a time.  
Iliad great doubts about re-appointing Mr.;  
Pinkney. He might have been so affected with i  
the horrors lie hail seen or heard in France, as to  
have uttered some expressions, which reported  
l&gt;y spies to the ruling powers, might have excit­  
ed prejudices against him, which would insure ;  
his second rejection, and that of his colleagues 1  
too. But as I knew of no such accusation, I  
could not bear the thought of abandoning him.  
1 had not time to communicate all these reflec­  
tions to Mr. Ames, and, moreover, 1 had busi­  
ness of mors importance to do I bad long wish­  
■cd to avail myself and the public of the tine ta­  
lents and amiable qualities and manners of Mr.  
Madison.—Soon after Mr. Ames left me, I  
sought and obtained an interview with Mr. Jef­  
ferson. With this gentleman I had lived on  
terms of intimate friendship for five anil twentv  
years, had acted with linn in dangerous times  
and arduous conflicts, and always found him a.«­  
Ridtious, laborious, k as far as I could judge, up­  
right and faithful.—Though by this time I differ­  
ed from him in opinion by the whole horizon  
concerning the practicability and success of the  
French revolution, and some other points, I b id  
no reason to think that lie differed materially  
knm me with regard to our national constitu; ion.  
1 did not think that the rumbling noise of party I  
calumny ought to discourage me from consulting i  
men whom 1 knew to be attached to the interest i  
of the nation, and whose experience, genius,  
learning and travels bad eminently qualified j  
thorn to give advice. I asked Mr. Jefferson |  
what be thought of another trip to Paris, and  
whether he thought the constitution sod the pio­  
ple would be willing to spare him for a shoit  
time ? Are you determined to send tn France ?  
Yes. That is right, said Mr. jeflersnn ; but with­  
out considering whether the Constitution will al­  
low it or not, 1 am so sick of residing in Europe,  
that I believe I shall never go there again. 1 re­  
plied, I own 1 have strong doubts whether it  
Xvould he legal to appoint you ; hut I believe no  
man could do tlie business so well. What do you  
think of sending Mr. Madison? Do you think he  
would accept of an appointment ? 1 do not know,  
Raid Mr. Jeflersnn. Washington wanted to ap­  
point him some time ago, anil kept the place o­  
pen for him a long time ; but fie never could get  
him to sSy that lie would go. Other characters  
were considered,and oilier conversation ensued  
We parted as good friends ps we had always  
lived i hut we consulted very little together af­  
terwards. Party violence soon rendered it im­  
practicable, oral least useless, and this party vi­  
olence was cxcif-d by Hamilton more Ilian any  
other man. 1 will not take leave of Mr. Jeffer­  
son In this place, v itliout declaring my opinion  
that the accusations against him &lt;d blind devoti­  
on to Prance ; of hostility to England ; ot ha­  
te vil to commerce j of partiality and duplicity in  
Ins iatc ix-gociations with the belligerent powers,  
ore without foundation.  
  
From Mr. Jeflerson 1 went to one of the heads  
of departments, whom Mr. Washington liad ap­  
-po&#x27;rotrd, and I had 116 thoughts of removing. lu­  
cked I had tl*er» no objection to any of the secre­  
taries. I asked hifn what he thought of sending  
Mr. Madison, to T rance, w i»h or without others &gt;  
Is it determined to semi t&lt;s France at all ? Deter­  
mined ! Nothing is determined till it is execut­  
ed, smiling. But why not ’-—I thought it deserv­  
ed consideration —So it docs .- hut suppose it de­  
  
termined, what do you think of sending Mr. Ma-i  
diaon ? Is it determined to send Mr. Madison *  
No 5 but It deserves consideration.—Sending  
Mr. Madison will make dire work among the  
passions of our parties in Congress, and out ot  
floors, through the Slates ! Are we forever to lie  
overawed ami directed by party passions ? AH  
this conversation on my part was with the most  
perfect civility, rood humor and indeed familiar­  
ity : But 1 found it excited a profound gloom  
and sole ton countenance in my companion, which  
after some time broke out in ** Mr. President, we  
are willing to resign.” Nothing could have been  
more unexjiectcd to me than this observation—  
Nothing was farther from tny thoughts than to  
give any pain or uneasiness. 1 had said nothing  
that could possible displease, except pronouncing  
the name of Madison. I restrained iny surprise,  
however, ami only said, I hope nobody will  
resign : 1 ara satisfied with all the public officers.  
Upon further inquiries of the other heads of  
departments, and of other persons, 1 found that  
party passions had so deep and extensive roots,  
that I seriously doubted whether the Senate  
would not negative Mr. Madison, if I should  
name him—Rather than expose him to a nega­  
tive, or a doubtful contest in Senate, I concluded  
to omit him. If I had nominated Madison, I  
should have nominated Hamilton with him. The  
former I knew-, was much esteemed in Franco :  
the latter was rather an object of jealousy. But  
I thought the French would tolerate one for the  
sake of the other.— And 1 thought too that the  
manners of the one would soon wear off the pre­  
judices against him, ami probably make him a  
  
greater favorite than the other. But having giv­  
en up Madison. I ought to give up Hamilton loo.  
Who then should l name ? I mentioned Mr l):i- 1  
na uad Mr. Gerry to the heads of departments  
and to many leading men in both Houses. They  
all preferred Mr Dana. But it was evident e­  
nough to me, that neither Dana nor Gerry was  
their man. Dana was appointed, but refused. I  
then called the heads of departments together,  
and proposed Mr. Gerry. All the five voices  
Unanimously were against him. Such inveterate  
prejudice shocked me. I said nothing, but was  
determined I would not be the slave of it. I  
knew the man infinitely better than all of them.  
He was nominated and approved, and finally sa­  
ved the peace of the nation, for lie alone disco­  
vered and furnished the evidence that X, Y, &amp; 2  
were employed by Talleyrand ; and he alone  
brought home the direct, formal and official as­  
surances upon which the subsequent commissi­  
on proceeded, and peace was made.  
I considered Mr. Ames’s candidate, Mr. Ca­  
bot, as deliberately as any of the others, and  
with as favorable and friendly a disposition to  
wards him as any other, without exception.  
But I knew his character and connexions were  
as well known in France, particularly by Talley­  
rand, as Mr. Gerry’s were ; and that, there were  
great objections against the former, and none at  
i all against the latter. It would be therefore in­  
excusable in me to hazard the success of the  
mission merely to gratify the passions of a pafty  
in America, especially as l knew Mr. Gerry, to  
say the least, to be full as well qualified by his  
studies, his experience and every quality for the  
service, as the other.  
I afterwards nominated Mr. Cabot to he Se­  
cretary of the Navy, a station as useful as im*  
portant, and as honorable as tint other; and for  
which he was eminently qualified. But this he  
refused.  
No man had a greater slinre in propagating  
and diffusing these prejudices against Mr. Ger­  
ry than Hamilton, whether he had formerly con­  
ceived jealousies against him as a rival candi­  
date for the Secretaryship of the Treasury :—  
for Mr. Gerry was a financier, and had been  
employed for years on the committee on the trea­  
sury in the old congress, and a most indefatiga­  
ble member too. That committee had laid the  
foundation for the present system of the Trea­  
sury, and had organized it almost as well, though  
they had not the assistance of clerks and other  
conveniences, as at present. Any man wh«* will  
look into the journals of the old Congress, may  
! see the organization and the daily labors and  
I reports of that committee, and may form some  
: judgment of the talents and services of Mr. Ger­  
ry in that department. I knew that the officers  
of the treasury in Hamilton’s time dreaded to  
, see him rise in the house upon any question of fi­  
nance, because they said he was a man of so much  
J influence, that they always feared he would dis­  
&#x27; cover some error or carry some point against  
them. Or whether he feared that Mr. Gerry  
would be President of the United States be­  
fore him, l know not. He was not alone, how­  
ever. His friends among the heads of depart­  
ments and their correspondents in Boston, N.  
Yord and Philadelphia, sy mpathised with him  
very cordially in.his hatred of Gerry, and of e­  
veiy|other man who had labored Si suffered early  
in tne revolution.  
This preference of Mr. Gerry to Mr. Cabot  
was my first mortal offence against sovereign  
heads of departments and their disciples in all  
the states. It never was or has been forgiven  
me by those who call themselves, or are called  
by others, “ the leading men” among the fede­  
ralists.  
Mr. Hamilton says, page 49, “ After the re­  
“ jer.tion of Mr. Pinkney by the government of  
“ France, immediately alter the instalment of  
“ Mr. Adams as President, and long before the  
“ measure was taken, I urged a member of Con­  
“ press, then high in the confidence of the Pre­  
“ sident, to propose to him the immediate ap­  
“ pointraent of three commissioners, of whom  
“ Mr Jefferson or Mr. Madison to be one, to  
“ make another attempt to negociate.”  
T will relate all that I can recollect relative  
to this subject. Mr Tracy of Connecticut, who  
indeed was alway s in my confidence, came to  
me, I believe at the opening of the special ses­  
sion of Congress which I called soon after my  
j inauguration, and produced a long elaborate let­  
i ter from Mr. Hamilton, containing a whole sys­  
tem of instruction for the conduct of the Presi­  
dent, the Senate, and the House of Represen­  
tatives I read it very deliberately, and really  
thought the man was in a delirium. It appear­  
ed to me a very extraordinary instance of vo­  
lunteer empiricism thus to prescribe for a Pre­  
1 sident, Senate and House of Representatives, all  
desperately sick and in a state of deplorable de­  
; bility, without being called. And when I ma­  
i tnrely considered the contents of the letter, my  
j surprize was increased. 1 despised and detes­  
| ted the letter too much to take a ropy of it,  
I which I now regret. This letter is still in being j  
and I doubt not many copies of it are extant.— i  
; I most earnestly request any gentleman who  
j possesses one to publish it. That letter, though  
i it had no influence with me, had so much with  
j both houses of Congress, as to lay the foundati­  
! on of the overthrow of the federal party, and  
j of the revolutioa that followed four years af­  
terwards. 1 will endeavor to recollect as much  
of the contents of it as I can, and it I am incor­  
rect in any point, those who possess the letter  
can, by the publication of it, easily set all right.  
It began by a dissertation on the extraordina­  
rily critical situation of the U.S  
it recommended a new mission to France of  
three commissioners, Mr. Jefferson or to Mr. Ma­  
i dison to be one.  
It r» commended the raising an army of fifty  
I thousand men, ten thousand of them to lie caval­  
ry, an army of graat importance in so extensive  
a country vulnerable at so many points on tlie  
frontiers, and so accessible in so many places by  
»ea.  
  
It recon)manned an alien and sedition law.  
It recommended an invignration of the Trea­  
sury, by seizing on all the taxable articles not yet  
taxed by the government.—And lastly,  
It recommended a national Fast, not only on  
account of the intrinsic propriety of it, but be­  
cause we should lie very unskilfiill if we neglect  
to avail ourselve s of the religion* fe« lings of the  
people in a wis&#x27;fs so -difficult owl djngrrwf**—  
  
| There might be more, but these are all that I  
now recollect.  
Mr. Hamilton&#x27;s Imagination was always haunt­  
ed by that hideous mntu’rr or phantom, so often  
called a Crhitt and which so often produces im­  
prudent measures.  
How it liap|H-t«rd that Mr. Hamilton&#x27;s con­  
templations coincided so exactly with mute, as  
to think of Mr. Jefferson or Mr. Madison for en­  
voy to France, it maybe wire difficult to explain.  
But hit it be considered that this lettt.-r was wri­  
teu long after mv conversation with Mr. J offer*  
son, concerning himsulf coni Mr. Madison,  
wfticli was &quot;.he morning after my inauguration ;  
that I had communicated that conversation to  
otic or more of the heads of departments the  
same morning. It is probable, therefore, that  
Mr. Hamilton received hint* from some of his  
correspondents that i had thought of Madison  
and Hamilton, and that he was not displeased  
with the idea. 1 asked one «tf the heads of f)e- j  
partments Imv lie could account for Hamilton&#x27;s ‘  
recommending Jefferson or Madison ! “ Why,  
said the gentleman, 1 suppose Hamilton is vve i­  
ry of his practice? us an attorney, at New York, |  
and is willing to enter into some other employ­  
ment” Mr. Hamilton, however, might thank  
those who had been bis warmest friends for his  
disappointment. for nail it not been for their op­  
position to Madison, 1 should have appointed him  
8c Hamilton  
  
&#x27;1 lie army of Idly thousand men, ten thousand  
of them to lie horse, appeared, to me to he one  
»f the wildest extravagances of a Knight Er­  
rant. It proved to me that Mr. Hamilton knew  
no more oflhc sentiments and feelings of the peo­  
ple of America, than he did of those of the inha­  
bitants of one of the planets. Such an army  
without an enemy to combat, would have raised  
a rebellion in every state in the Union. &#x27;The ve­  
ry idea of the e’xpencc of it would have turned  
President, Senate and House out of doors I a­  
dopted none of these chimeras into my speech,  
and only recommended the raising of a few re­  
giments of artillery to garrison the fortifications  
of the most exposed places. Yet such was the  
influence of Mr. Hamilton in Congress, that,  
without any recommendation from tlic President  
they passed a bin to raise an army, not a large  
one, indeed, but enough to overturn the then fe­  
deral government.  
Nor did I adopt his idea of an alien or sedi­  
tion law. I recommended no such thing in my  
speech. Congress, however, adopted both thes&#x27;r  
measures. I knew there was nce.l enough of  
botli, and therefore I consented to them. But as  
they were then considered as war measures and  
intended altogether against the advocates of the  
French and peace with France, I was appre­  
hensive that a hurricane of clamour would he  
raised against them, as in truth them was, even  
more fierce and vigilant than 1 hail anticipa­  
ted.  
Seizing on all the taxable articles not yet tax­  
ed, to support an army of fifty thousand men, at  
a time when so many lax. laws, already enacted,  
were unexecuted in so many states, and when  
insurrections and rebellions had already been  
excited in Pennsylvania, on account of Utxes, ap­  
peared to me altogether desperate, altogether  
delirious.  
1 wanted no admonition from Mr. Uam&#x27;dton to  
institute a national fast. 1 had determined  
on this measure! long enough before Mr. Ham­  
ilton’s letter was written. And here let me  
say, with great sincerity, that 1 think there is no­  
thing upon this earth more sublime and affecting,  
than the idea ol a great nation all on their knees  
at once before tlieir God, acknowledging their  
faults and imploring his blessing and protection,  
when thb prospect before them threatens great  
danger ami bal unity. It can scarcely fail to have  
a favorable effect on tlieir morals in general, or  
to inspire them with warlike virtues in parti­  
cular. When most, if not all the religious sects  
in the nation hold such fasts among themselves,  
I never could see the force of the objections a­  
gainst making them, on great and extraordinary  
occasions, national ; unless it be the jealousy of  
the separate states, lest the general government  
should become too national. Those however,  
who diiler from me in opinion on this point,  
have as good a right to tlieir judgment as 1 have  
to mine, and I shall submit mine to the general  
will.  
In fine, Mr. Hamilton, in the passage I have  
been commenting, in this letter, has let out farts,  
which if he had possessed a grain of common  
sense, he would have wished should be forever  
concealed. I should never have revealed or ex­  
plained them, if he, and his partisans, had not  
compelled me

disclaim ant renounce all the honor  
ot this doubt. [ never euterrained  
such a doubt for a moment. I might  
ik the opinion of twenty persons,  
(tor Itoo ¢ confuited much’’) in or­  
der to discover whether there was any  
doubt 10 the public mind, or any por.  
ty who were averse to such a mcafure  
or hed any doubt about it. But I  
néver had any hesitation myfelf. This

It is true “the expediency of the  
flep was fuggelled to MY, Adams,”  
betore he took the flep and befote he  
had time to take it ; but long after  
he had determined to take it. The  
myltery may bé reveaied. I have no  
motive, whatever others may have,  
to conceal or dissemble it. .  
The morning afi¢r my inzugura­  
tion, Mr. Fisher Ames made me 2  
visit, to take leave. His period in  
Congrels had expired, and the delica­  
cy of his health; the despondency of  
bis disposition, and a delpair of a re­  
eleftion from the increale of the op­  
posite party in his diltri&amp;, had induc­  
ed him to&#x27; decline to stand a candi­  
date. I&#x27;was no longer to h:ve the  
affitance of his council or eloquence,  
though Mr. Hamilton continued to  
erjoy both till his death. Mr. Ames  
was 0u doubt one of Mr. Hamilton’s  
privy counsel, when he repslved to  
fend a new commiflion of three. Mr.  
Ames, with much gravity and solem­  
nity advised me to institute a new  
mifhion to France. ©Qur affiirs with  
that republic were in an unpleafint  
and dangerous situation, and the peo­  
ple, in a long recess of congress must i  
have some obje&amp; on which to fix their  
contemplations and their hopes. And |  
he recommende: Mr. George Cabot, |  
for the northern States to be one of  
the three, if a commission was to be l  
sent, or alone, if but one was to go.  
1 answered Mr. Apes, that the  
fubj=¢t. had almost engrossed my at­  
tention for -2 long time. That I  
should take every thing into [erious !

erate enquiries concerning charalers, |  
and maivrely confifer “the qualities |  
and qualifications of candidates, be­

Mr. Ames depurted for Maflichuferes. |  
&quot;1 had rolled all these things in my  
own mind long before. The Frencli  
nation and their government were in  
a very unibrageous and inflimable  
disposition. - Much delicacy and e

Cabot, Judge Dana, Mr. Gerry, and  
many cthers in the northern, middle,  
and southern ftatés. I thought much  
ot Mr. I-ff:rfon, but had great doubts  
whether the constitution would aliow  
me to fendithe Vice President abroad.  
The nation at large had «fligned him

he had a_right to abanden, or I a  
i right to iavite him to relinquith,

1 second rej=¢tion, and that of his col-  
I leagues too. Buat d4s I knew of no  
such accusation I conld not bear tie

good humor and indeed famillarity :  
But I found it excited a profound  
gloom and solemn countenance in my  
companion, witich after {ome time  
broke cut in ¢ Mr President, we are  
willing to resign.” Nothing could  
have been more unexpe@edto ma than  
- this observation— Nothing was farther  
from my thoughts than to give any  
pain or uneasiness. 1 had fid nothing  
that could peflibly displease, except  
Pronouncing the name of Madison.  
1 veftrained my surprise, however,  
and only {aid, I hope nobody will re­  
sign: I am fatisfied with all the pub.  
lic officers.  
Upon farther enqniries of the oth­  
er heads ot departmznts, and of nther  
persons, I found that party paflins  
had {o deep and extensive roots, that  
i ferionlly doubted whether the Sen­  
ate would not negative Mr. M. difon,  
if I should name him = Rather than  
expose him to a negative; or a doubt.  
fu! contelt in the Senate, I concluded  
to omit him. If Ibad nominated  
Mudifon, 1 should have anminated  
Hamiiton with him. The former, I  
knew, was much esteemed in France:  
the latjer was rather an obj:@ of jeal.  
ouly. But I thought the French  
would tolerate ona for the {ike of the  
other.—And 1 thought too that the  
manners of the one would soon wear  
off the prejudices against him, aed  
probably make him a greater favorite  
than the other. Bnt having given up  
Madison, I ought to give up Hamil­  
ton too. Who then thould I name?  
i mentioned Mr. Dana and Mr. Ger­  
ry to the heads of departments and  
to many leazing men in both Houses.  
They all preferred Mr. Dana. But  
it was evident enough to me, that  
neither Dana nor Gerry was their  
man. Dana was appointed, but re­  
fufed. I then calied the heads of de­  
partmsgts together, and proposed Mr.  
Gerry. All the five voices unani­  
mously were against him. Such in­  
vetcrate prejudice shocked - me, 1  
{aid nothingz, but was determined I  
would not be the flaveof it. 1 knew  
the man infinitely better than all of  
them. He was nominated and ap­  
proved, and finally saved the peace of  
the nation ; for he alone discovered  
and furnifthed the&#x27;evilence that X. Y.  
and Z. were employed by Talley­  
rand ; and h&gt; alone brought home  
the dire&amp;, formal and cfficial affur.-  
ances upon which the {ubfequent com­  
miflion proceeded, and peace was  
made. -  
I considered Mr. Ames® candidate,  
M:r. Cahot, as deliberately as any of  
the others, and with as favorable and  
friendly a disposition towards him as  
any other, without exception. But I  
knew his chaiadler and conneions  
were as well known in France, partic -  
alarly by Talleyrand, as Mr. Gerry’s  
were 3 and that there were great ob­  
je&amp;ions againkt the former, and none  
at all against the latter. It would be  
therefore inexcusable in me to huzard:  
the success of the miflion merely to  
gratify the peffions of a party in A­  
merica. especially as 1 knew Mr Ger­  
ry, to fay the least, to be full as weil  
qualified by his ftuies, his experience,  
and every quality for the service, as  
thewther.  
I afterwards nominated Mr. Cabot  
to be Secretary of the Navy, a station  
as ufeful as important and a 8 honora­  
ble as the other, and for which he  
was eminently qualified. But this he  
refufed. : P!  
No main had a greater share in  
_propagating and diffufing these preja­  
dices against Mr. Gerry than Hamil­  
ton, whether he had formerly con­  
-\ ceived j=aloufies against him as a rival  
_gandidate for the Secretarythip of the  
thafwy : for. Mr. Gerry was a finan­  
cier, and had been employed for years  
‘on the committee on the treasury in  
the old Congress, and 2 most indefati­  
gable member tOO. That commirtee  
“ had laid the fou:ndation for the préfent  
system of the treasury, and had organ­  
ized it almost as\ well, though they  
had not the aflitance of clerks and  
other conveniences,as at present. Any  
man who will look im&amp;&amp;c&amp;mﬁﬂs  
of the old Congrels, may fee the or­  
veports of that commirtee, and may  
form some judgment of the (talents

the States. It never was or has been  
forgiven me by those who call them  
selves, or are called by athers, * the  
leading men” among the federalilts.  
Mr. Hamilton fays, page 49, * As­  
“ ter the reje@ion of Mr. Finckney by  
‘““the government of France, imme.  
¢ diateiy after the inftalment of Mn,  
“ Adams, as Prelident, and long be-.  
“fore the measure was taken, I ur.  
‘““ged a member of Congress, then  
“ high in the confidence of the Prefi­  
¢“ dent, to propose to him the imme­  
¢ diate appointmant of three Commuf­  
“ fioners, of whom Mr. Jefferfon or  
% Mr Madison to be one, to mike  
¢ another attempt to negociate.” -  
I will relate all that I can récolle&amp;  
relative to this fubj=&amp;. Mr. Tracy  
of Connedicut, who indeed was al.  
ways in my confidence, came to me,  
I believe at the opening of the {pecial  
fefhon of Congress which I called  
soon after my insuguration, and pro­  
duced a long elaborate letter from  
Mr. Hamilton, containing a whole  
{yltem of infru&amp;ion for the condu&amp;  
of the President, the Senate, and the  
House of Representatives. I read it  
very deliberately, and really thought  
the man was in a delirium. It ap­  
peared to me a “very extraordinary  
instance of volaunteer empiricism thus  
to preflcribe for a President, Senate,  
and House of Representatives all des­  
perately sick and in a Rate of deplora­  
ble debility, without being called.  
And when 1 maturely considered .the  
contents of the letter, my furprize was  
increased. { dufpifed and derefted  
the letter too much to take a copy of  
it, which I now regret. This letter  
is @ill in being and I doubt not many  
copies of it are extant. - I most earn­  
eltly request any gentleman who pof­  
fefles one to publith it. That letter,  
though it had no influence with me,  
had so much with both Houses of  
Congress, as to lay the foundation cf  
the overthrow of the federal party,  
and of the revolution that followed  
four years afterwards. I will endeav­  
or to recolle&amp; as much of the contents  
of it as I can, and if I am incorre&amp; in  
any point, those who poflzfs the let­  
ter can, by the publication of it, easily  
set all right.  
It began by a dissertation on the  
extraordinarily critical situation of the  
U. States. :  
It tecommended a new mission to  
France of three Commiflioners, Mr.  
Jefferfon or Mr. Mudifon to be one.  
It recommended the railing an ar­  
my of fifty thousand men, ten thou.  
{fand of them to be cavalry, an army  
of great importance in {0 extensive a  
country vulaerable at so manv pcints  
on the frontiers, and o acceflible in  
so many places by sea. )  
At recommended an alicn and sedi­  
tion law. I  
  
It recommended an mvigoration of  
the Treasury, by seizing on all the  
taxable articles not yet taxed by the  
government.—And laltly,  
It recommended a national Fas,  
not only on account of the intrinsic  
propriety of it, but becanfe we th.uld  
be very untkilfull if we negle@ to  
avail ourselves of the religious feel­  
ings of the people in a crisis so difficult  
and dangerous —There might be  
more, but these are all that I now re­  
colle&amp;. , ;  
  
Mr. Hamilion’s imagination was i  
always haunted by that hedious mon- |  
flet or phantom, so often called a  
Crisis and which so often produces .  
imprudent measures.  
How it happened that Hamilton’s  
contemplations coincided so exaétly  
with mine, asto think of Mr. J:ffer- |  
son or Mr. Madison for envoy to I&#x27;rance  
it may be more difficult to explain.  
But let ic be considered that thisletter  
was written long after my conver{a­  
tion -with Mr. Jefferfon, concerning  
himfelf and Mr. Madison, which was  
the morning after my inauguration ;  
that I had communicated that con.  
ver{ation to one or more of the heads  
of departments the fame morning. It  
is probable, therefore, that Mr. Ham.  
ilton received hints from some of his  
correspondents that 1 had thought es  
Madison and Hamilton, and that he  
was not displeased with the idea. I  
alked ooe of (BEheaas of-deparemente­  
bow he could account for Hamilton’s  
recommendihg Jeffetfon or Madison ?  
‘* Why. said the gentle!_nan, I suppose j  
Hamilton is weary of his pra&amp;ice, as  
an attorney, at. N. York,and is willing  
to enter into some other employmenc.”’ %  
Mr. Hamilton, however. might thank  
those who had been his warmest  
friends for his disappointment : for  
had it not been for their opposition to  
Madison, | should have appointed him -  
ani Hamilton. . &#x27; s  
. Thearmy of fifty thousand men, ten thou­  
sand of them to be horse. appeared to me  
to be one of the wildest extravagances of a  
Knight Errant It proved to me that  
‘Mr. Hamilton knew no more of the fenti­  
.mnts phﬂ feelings of the people of Ames­  
‘ica than he did of those of the inhabit.  
ants of one the plancts. Such on army  
without ‘an enemy to combat would have  
raif&amp;%l a rebellion in every slate kin&quot; the union  
The very idea of the expence of it would  
have I’nmd President, Senate -and, Houlg,  
out of doors, 1 ﬂ‘wg&#x27;““m of these  
chimeras into my speech, and only recom.  
mended the raising of a few regiments bf ar­  
silery %o gorridonthe: fostifcation of k.  
  
most exposed plaées. Yet such was the if­  
fluence of Mr. Hamilton in Congrefls, that,  
without any recommendation from the Pr  
fivcnt they passed a bill “to raif: an arn&#x27;é‘,  
not a large one, indeed, but enough to over­  
tura the then federal government. .  
Nor did [ adopt his idta of an alien or  
{cdition law. Irecommended no such thing  
in my {pecch. Congrels; however, adopted  
both these meafares. | kuew there was need  
encugh of both, and therefore I consented  
to them. But as they were then contidered  
as war measures and intended aitogether a­  
gainst the advoedtes of the French and peace  
with ¥ran-e, I was apprehensive that a hur­  
ricane of clamour ‘would be raised against  
them, as in teuth there was, even more fierce  
and violent than 1 had anticipated.  
Seiziag on QII the taxable articles, not yet  
taxed, to support an army of fifty thousand  
men, at a time when so many tax laws, al­  
ready, enadted, were unexecuted in so ma­  
ny (tates, and when infurre@ions and rebel­  
lions had already been cxcited in Peunlylva­  
nia, on account of taxes, appeared to me  
altogether desperate, altogether delitious,  
[ wanted no admonition irom Mr. Hamg  
iltou to institute a national fat. 1 had de­  
termined on this mealure long enough be­  
fore Mr. Hamiitons letter was written,  
Aud here let me fay, with great sincerity  
that I think there is nothing upon this earth  
more sublime and affc&amp;ing, than the idea  
of a great nation all on their knees at once  
belore their God; ackowledging their faults  
and imploring his blelling and prote@ion,  
whea rhe profpe@ before them threatens  
gréat dv nges anw&#x27;.ia‘mity Tt can fearcely  
fail to have a faporabic cffe@® oa their mo­  
valsia geatral, dr to inlpice them with war­  
like virtdes in particalar. When most, it not  
alb the religious {ects im the matron hold  
such fafts amoeg themselves, | never could  
{ee the force of the obje@ions against mak­  
ing them. on great and utraerdinary’ecca­  
fione, national ; unless it Be the jealousy of  
the separate Rates, left the genera! govern­  
ment fhou!ld become too national. Those  
however, who differ from -me in opinion on  
this point, have as good a right to their  
judgment as I have to mine, and I fhail  
submit mine to the general will.  
In fine, Mrc. Hamilton, in the passage I  
have been commenting, in this letter, has  
let out fatks, which if he had poficiled a  
grain of comaien feafe, he would have  
withed should be forcver concealed. I  
should never have revcaled or explained  
them if he, and his partizaas had not com­  
pelled me

When 1 first read this sentence, 1 am not  
certain whether it excited muﬂ&amp;miﬁ.-  
ment, indignation, contempt, or ridicule. By  
whom v%?thia measure resclved ¥ Ly  
Mwm Certainly not. . If it  
\m&#x27;ﬂy. not, He had mot bebn consulted.  
“His resolutions were not known. =By whém,

By Mr, Hamilton and his privy counsellors.  
And what&#x27;had Mr. Hamittetr and his privy  
counsellors to &#x27;do with the business ! And  
who were his privy counsellors? .. = -  
Page 22, he says, % the expedicncy of this  
step Was suggested to Mr. Adams, through a  
lederal channel, a considerable time before  
he determined to take it. He hesitated whe­  
ther it could Le dones after the: re{&#x27;ection ol  
General Pinckney, without national ‘debase­

1 disclaim and renounce 2l the honour of this  
doubt. I never entertsined such a ‘doylt far  
a moment. ¥1 might ask the opinion of twen­  
ty persoms, (for 1 tco * consuited much™) in  
order to discover whether there was any  
doubt in the publick mind, or any party who  
were averse to such a measure or had wny  
doudt about it. But i nevcf?‘imq any hcesi­  
tation myself. This possage, like all the  
rest of this pamphiet, shews that it was writ­  
ten from his mere imagination, fromn confuse  
ed rumors, or downright false information.  
It is true “ the expediencyof the step was  
suggested to Mr. Adams,” before he took  
the step and before he had fime to take it ;  
but long after he had determineds to take it,  
The mystery may be revealed. 1 have no  
motive, whatever others may have, to con­  
ceal or dissemblle ir, &#x27;  
  
The morning after my inauguration, Mr,  
Fisher Anmies made me a visit, 10 take leave.  
His peciod in Congress had expired, and the  
delicacy of hisg hdagh, the despondency of his  
disposition, and despair of a re-election from  
the increase of ge opposite party in his dis  
tricty; had d him. to- decline to stand a  
eandidate. I wos no longer to kave the ns­  
sistance of his council or eloquence, tb’oulsh  
Mr. Hamilton, continued to enjoy both till his  
death. Mr. Ames was mo doubt one of Mr.  
Hamilton’s privy counsel, when he resolved  
to send a new commission of three. Mr.  
Ames, with much gravity and solemunity, ads  
vised me to institute a new mission to &#x27; France.  
Our affuirs with that republick were in an  
unpieasant and dangerous situation, and the  
people, ina long recess of congress must  
have some ebject on which to fix their con­  
templations and their hopes. And he recom­  
mended Mr. George Cabot, fo: the northern  
States to be one of the three, if a commis­  
sion was to be seut, or alone, if but onc was  
to go. A ‘  
  
I answered Mr. Ames, that the subject hnyl  
almost engrossed my attention for a long  
tifhe. That I should take every thing into  
serious consideration and detesmine nothing  
suddeuly ; that I should make deliberate ¢n­  
quiries concerning characters, wnd maturely  
consider the qualities and qualifications of  
candidates, before any thing was finally deter­  
mined. Mr. Ames departed for Massachu-  
Sclis, ’ »  
  
I had rolled all these things in my own  
mind leng before. The Freuch nation and  
their government were in a very umbrage­  
ous and inflgmable dispasidion. r&amp;’luch deli­  
cacy and deliberation were necessary in the  
choicé of characters. Most of the prominent  
characters in America, were as well koown  
at Piris, as they were at Philadelphia. I had  
somgtimes thought of oendlﬁ Mr. Madison,  
and Mr. Hamilton to join Mr. PhUl? ina  
ngw Commission. 1 had thought of Mr,  
Ames himself, 2s wellas Mr. Cabot, Judge  
Dana, Mr. Gerry, and many others in the  
nerthern, middle, and southefn states. 1  
theught much of Mr. Jefferson, but had great  
coubts whether the constitution would aliow  
me to seid the Vice President abréad. The  
natign at large had assigned him a station,  
which I doubted whether he had a right to  
abandon, or I a right to invite him to relin-  
Guishy though but for a time.  
1 had great doubts about n-oppoimln# Mr.  
Pinckney. He might have been so affected  
with the horrours he bad seen or heard in  
Pna:o. as o have ugered some c;‘ pressions,  
which reported by spigs to the ruling powers,  
mi% have exitcdpp&#x27;.r:jﬁdicn against him,  
would insure bis second rejoctiu, and  
that of bis colléagues too. Dut as 1 knew of  
no such accuss 1 could not bear the  
thougit of abgs him. I had not €ime  
‘to eommunicate «ll these reflections to: Mr.  
‘Ames, and, moreover, 1 hod business of more  
importance to do. I A‘*h:f wished to

fleularly Ly T elleyrand, ae Me. Gm‘s were ;

it wonld be therefore inexcusable inme to  
dazard the spreess of the mission merely to  
);ruii{ the pascions of a party in Amer&amp;a‘  
especislly &amp;s 1 kdew My, Gerry, to say  
ieast, to be fuil as well ?liﬁ_c“;l,, by his stu­

I sficewards maminated Mr. Cabot to be  
Secretury of the Nayy, a stntion &amp; useful as  
. mportan, pzd as ‘honourable as the other,  
cmro for which he was eminently qualificd.  
But this he refused. _  
- No man had a greater share in proagaga&#x27;ﬁng  
snd diffusing these prejudices against Mr.  
Gerry than Humilten, whether he had for­  
metly conceived jealousics sagainst him as a  
vival candidate for the Secretaryship of the  
Treasury : for dir. Gerry was.a financier, and  
had been employed for years on the commit­  
tee on the treasury inthe old Congress, and  
a most indefatigable member too. Thut com­  
m&amp;e Had leid the foundation for the present  
. system of the treasury, and had organized it  
almost as wellithough they hadinot thesassist­  
ance, of clerks and other canveniences, as at  
present. Any man who will&#x27; leok into the  
journdls of the old Congress, may sce the,  
wrganization and the daily labours and reports  
of that committee, and may form sbme judg­  
ment of the talents and services of Mr. Ger­  
ry in that department. J knew that the of­  
- ficers, of the treasury in Hamilton’s time  
dreaded to see hiim rvise in the House upon  
any question of finance, because they said he  
was a man of so much influence, that they  
always feared he would discover some errour  
pr carry some point aguinst them.—~Or wheé­  
ther he feargd that Me. Gerry would be Pre­  
sident of the United States before him, I  
kovow not. IHe was not alone, however. His  
friends among the heads of departments and  
their corresponduits in Boston, New-York  
and Philadelphia, sympathized with him very  
cordiaily in his hatred of Gerry, and of eve­  
vy other man who had labohr#d and suffered  
carly in the revolution.  
This preference of Mr. Gerry to Mr. Ca­  
bot wus my first mortal offence against my  
sovereign beads of departments and their dis­  
ciples in wil the States, It never was or has

fouse of Representatives., 1 Tead it very

of “departinents. the same morning. )  
pro.&amp;a:le thevefore, that Mr. Hamilion peceiy­  
ed ‘hints from some of his cbrresronm*&#x27;  
that 1 had thought of Madigon and Hamikton,  
and’that he was not displeased with the idea. -  
I asked one of the heuzds ﬁ“de’nrtmcm: how  
he could account for Hamilton :Jecommcmh  
g Jefferson or Madison ? « Why, said the  
gentleman, I -suppose Humiiton i weary of  
‘his practice, as an attorney, at chﬂor)i,ind 3  
is willing to éuter into el?tm’le other employ­  
ment.”’ Mr., Hamilton, however, -ﬁiﬁﬁm  
those who had been bis warmest fricnds for  
his disappointment : for had it not been for  
their opposition to Madison, [ should have  
appointed him and Hamiltoy, | #  
The &#x27;army of hity thomszl n, ten thous­  
and of them to be horse, pm&#x27;ed to mie to  
bo ,one of the wildest eﬁ,ravagancea of a  
Knight Lrrant, It proved to me that Me.o  
Haunnlton knew no more of the sentiments  
and feelings of the people of America, than -  
he did of ﬁu of the inbabitants of oreof the -  
planets. . Such an army without an enemy to  
combaty-would have raised a rebeliion in  
cvery state in the unjon. The very idea bf  
the,expense of it “vould have turned President,  
Senate gad House out of dodrs. 1 sdopted  
none of: thesc chigeras into iy speeth; dnd i  
onty m:rmnmcndcd the raising ofa few regi­  
nrnu’; artillery to_garrvison the fortifications  
of the most cxposgg‘{)hcea. Yet such was  
the influence of Mr. Hamilton in Congress, |  
that, without any recommendation frém the  
President, they passed abill to raise an army;  
not a large one, indeedy but enough to over­  
turn the then federal government. y -  
  
. Nor did I adopt his idea of an alien or se­  
dition law. I recommended no such thingin  
my speech. Congress, however, adopted  
both these measures. I knew there was need  
enough of both, and therefore I consented to  
them. But as they were then considered as  
war measures,and intended altogether agamst  
the advocates of the I&#x27;rench, and peace with  
France, 1 was apprehensive that a hurricgne  
of clamanr would be raised against themsas  
in truth there was, even more fierce and vio­  
lent than I had anticipated. :  
Seizing on all the taxable articles not yet  
taxed, to support an army of fifty thousand  
men, at a ime when 80 many tax laws, al­  
ready enacted, were unexecuted in so many  
states, and when insurrections arnd rebellions  
had already beep excited in Pennsylvania, on  
account of taxes, appeared to me altogether  
desperate, and altogether delirious,  
I wanted, no ln:gonidon from Mr. Hamil­  
ton to institute a&#x27;mational fast. I had deter­  
mined on this measure long enough before  
Mr. Hamilton’s letter was. wiitten. Auod  
here let me say, with great sincerity, that I  
think there is pothing upon this carth more  
sublime and affecting,than theidea of a great  
pation: all on their knees at once before their  
God, acknowledging their faults und implor­  
ing his Llessing and proteetion, when. the  
prospect belord thém threatens great danger  
and calamity. It canscarcely fail to have a  
favourable effect on their morals in peneral,  
or to inspire them with warlike virtues in par­  
ticular. When meost, i{ not ali the religious  
sects” in the nation hold ‘such fasts smong  
themselves,l never could see the force of the  
objections against making them, on great and  
extraordinary occasions, national ; unless it  
be the jealous]y of the separate states, lest the  
gpneral government should becpme 1o na­  
tional. Those however, who differ from e,  
in opinion on thig peint; have as good a right  
to theiv judgment as 1 have to mine, and I  
shall submit mine to the general will.  
In fine, Mr. Hamilton, in the passage I  
have been commenting, in this letter, has let  
cut facts, which if he had possessed a grain  
of commmon sense, he would have wished  
should be forever concealed. I should never  
have revealed or explained them il he, and:  
his partizans, had not compelled me. b A
