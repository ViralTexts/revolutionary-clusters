While the public attention is so much turned towards America, every letter from thence that promises new information, is pretty generally read; it seems therefore the more necessary that care should be taken to disabuse the Public, when those letters contain facts false in themselves, and representations injurious to bodies of people, or even to private persons.

d and scrupulous, and the good will between those different bodies in that country is now both mutual and equal.  
He goes on: “They came out with a levelling spirit, and they retain it. They cannot bear to think that one man should be exorbitantly rich and another poor, so that, except in the seaport towns, there are few great estates among them. This equality produces also a rusticity of manners; for in their language, dress, and in all their behaviour, they are more boorish than any thing you ever saw in a certain Northern latitude.” One would imagine from this account, that those who were growing poor, plundered those who were growing rich to preserve this equality, and that property had no protection; whereas in fact, it is no where more secure than in the New England colonies, the law is no where better executed, or justice obtain’d at less expence. The equality he speaks of, arises first from a more equal distribution of lands by the assemblies in the first settlement than has been practised in the other colonies, where favourites of governors have obtained enormous tracts for trifling considerations, to the prejudice both of the crown revenues and the public good; and secondly, from the nature of their occupation; husbandmen with small tracts of land, though they may by industry maintain themselves and families in mediocrity, having few means of acquiring great wealth, especially in a young colony that is to be supplied with its cloathing, and many other expensive articles of consumption from the mother country. Their dress the gentleman may be a more critical judge of than I can pretend to be; all I know of it is, that they wear the manufactures of Britain, and follow its fashions perhaps too closely, every remarkable change in the mode making its appearance there within a few months after its invention here; a natural effect of their constant intercourse with England, by ships arriving almost every week from the capital, their respect for the mother country, and admiration of every thing that is British. But as to their language, I must beg this gentleman’s pardon if I differ from him. His ear, accustomed perhaps to the dialect practised in the certain northern latitude he mentions, may not be qualified to judge so nicely in what relates to pure English. And I appeal to all Englishmen here, who have been acquainted with the Colonists, whether it is not a common remark, that they speak the language with such an exactness both of expression and accent, that though you may know the natives of several of the counties of England, by peculiarities in their dialect, you cannot by that means distinguish a North American. All the new books and pamphlets worth reading, that are published here, in a few weeks are transmitted and found there, where there is not a man or woman born in the country but what can read: and it must, I should think, be a pleasing reflection to those who write either for the benefit of the present age or of posterity, to find their audience increasing with the increase of our colonies; and their language extending itself beyond the narrow bounds of these islands to a continent, larger than all Europe, and to a future empire as fully peopled, which Britain may probably one day possess in those vast western regions.  
But the Gentleman makes more injurious comparisons than these: “That latitude,” he says, “has this advantage over them, that it has produced sharp, acute men, fit for war or learning, whereas the other are remarkably simple or silly, and blunder eternally. We have 6000 of their militia, which the General would willingly exchange for 2000 regulars. They are for ever marring some one or other of our plans when sent to execute them. They can, indeed, some of them at least, range in the woods; but 300 Indians with their yell, throw 3000 of them into a panick, and then they will leave nothing to the enemy to do, for they will shoot one another; and in the woods our regulars are afraid to be on a command with them on that very account.” I doubt, Mr. Chronicle, that this paragraph, when it comes to be read in America, will have no good effect, and rather increase that i

f the officers from your certain northern latitude? They may, as you say, be fit for learning, but, surely, the return of your first General, with a well appointed and sufficient force from his expedition against Louisbourg, is not the most shining proof of his talents for war. And no one will say his plan was marred by us, for we were not with him. Was his successor, who conducted the blundering attack and inglorious retreat from Ticonderoga, a New England man, or one of that certain latitude? Then as to the comparison between Regulars and Provincials, will not the latter remark, That it was 2000 New England Provincials, with but about 150 Regulars, that took the strong fort of Beausejour in the beginning of the war, though in the accounts transmitted to the English Gazette, the honour was claimed by the regulars, and little or no notice taken of the others. That it was the Provincials who beat General Dieskau, with his Regulars, Canadians, and “yelling” Indians, and sent him prisoner to England. That it was a Provincial-born Officer,  
*Colonel Bradstreet.  
with American battoemen, that beat the French and Indians on Oswego river. That it was the same Officer, with Provincials, who made that long and admirable march into the enemies country, took and destroyed Fort Frontenac, with the whole French fleet on the lakes, and struck terror into the heart of Canada. That it was a Provincial Officer,

hing more rash; for had one single part of their plan failed, or had the French made the fortieth part of the resistance then that they have made now, every soul of the New Englanders must have fallen in the trenches. The garrison was weak, sickly, destitute of provisions, and disgusted, and therefore became a ready prey; and, when they returned to France were decimated for their gallant defence. Where then is the glory arising from thence?” After denying his facts, “that the garrison was weak, wanted provisions, made not a fortieth part of the resistance, were decimated,” &amp;c. the New England men will ask this regular gentleman, If the place was well fortified, and had (as it really had) a numerous garrison, was it not at least brave to attack it with a handful of raw undisciplined militia? If the garrison was, as you say, “sickly, disgusted, destitute of provisions, and ready to become a prey,” was it not prudent to seize that opportunity, and put the nation in possession of so important a fortress at so small an expence? So that if you will not allow the enterprize to be, as we think it was, both brave and prudent, ought you not at least to grant it was either one or the other? But is there no merit on this score in the people, who, tho’ at first so greatly divided, as to the making or forbearing the attempt, that it was carried in the affirmative, by the small majority of one vote only; yet when it was onc

“As the Massachuset’s assembly at first entered into the expedition upon the coolest deliberation, so did they on the other hand exert themselves with uncommon vigour in the persecution of it.

w that the plan itself must be laid with some “wisdom and propriety?” Is there no merit in the ardour with which all degrees and ranks of people quitted their private affairs, and ranged themselves under the banners of their King, for the honour, safety, and advantage of their country?  
  
†“The bounty, pay, and other encouragements, allowed by the Massachuset’s government to both officers and men, especially the former, was but small; but the spirit which reigned thro’ the province supplied the want of that; the complement of troops was soon inlisted; not only the officers, who served in this enterprize, were gentlemen of considerable property, but most of the non-commission’d officers, and many of the private men, had valuable freeholds, and entered into the service upon the same principles that the old Roman citizens in the first Consular armies used to do.” Memoirs of the last War, p. 41.  
  
  
  
  
To which I may add, that instances of the same noble spirit are not uncommon in all the other colonies; where men have entered into the service not for the sake of the pay, for their own affairs in their absence suffer more by far than its value; not in hopes of preferment in the army, for the Provincials are shut out from such expectations, their own forces being always disbanded on a peace, and the vacancies among the Regulars filled with Europeans; but merely from public spirit and a sense of duty. Among many others, give me leave to name Col. Peter Schuyler of New Jersey; who, though a gentleman of a considerable independent fortune, has, both in the last and present war, quitted that domestic ease and quiet which such affluence afforded, to take upon him the command of his country’s forces, and by his example animated the soldiery to undergo the greatest fatigues and hardships: And who when a prisoner in Canada for fifteen months, did, during the whole time, generously make use of his own credit to relieve such British subjects as unhappily fell into the hands of the enemy. Not to mention his advancing his own private fortune towards paying the forces, raised during last war in America by order of the crown; when, by the continued delays in sending the money from England for that purpose, it was generally doubted whether it would ever be sent, and t

e of the design, till they saw the fleet of transports cover the sea before their port? Is there none in the indefatigable labour the troops went thro’ during the siege, performing the duty both of men and horses; the hardships they patiently suffered for want of tents and other necessaries; the readiness with which they learnt to move, direct, and manage cannon, raise batteries, and form approaches;  
*“The New England troops, within the compass of 23 days from the time of their first landing, erected five fascine batteries against the town, mounted with cannon of 42 lb. 22 lb. and 18 lb. shot, mortars of 13, 11, and 9 inches diameter, with some cohorns; all which were transported by hand, with incredible labour and difficulty, most of them above two miles; all the ground over which they were drawn, except small patches or hills of rocks, was a deep morass, in which, whilst the cannon were upon wheels, they several times sunk so deep, as not only to bury the carriages, but their whole bodies. Horses and oxen could not be employed in this service, but all must be drawn by men, up to the knees in mud; the nights, in which the work was done, were cold and foggy, their tents bad, there being no proper materials for tents to be had in New England at the outset of the expedition. But notwithstanding these difficulties, and many of the men’s being taken down with fluxes, so that at one time there were 1500 incapable of duty, they went on without being discouraged or murmuring, and transported the cannon over those ways, which the French had always thought impassable for such heavy weights; and besides this, they had all their provisions and heavy ammunition, which they daily made use of, to bring from the camp over the same way upon their backs.” Memoirs of the last war in America, page 52.

 is, not only Laud’s persecution, but the other publick troubles in the following reigns, induc’d many thousand families to leave England, and settle in the plantations. During the predominance of the parliament, many royalists removed or were banished to Virginia and Barbadoes, who afterwards spread into the other settlements: The Catholics shelter’d themselves in Maryland. At the restoration, many of the depriv’d nonconformist ministers with their families, friends and hearers, went over. Towards the end of Charles the Second’s reign and during James the Second’s, the dissenters again flocked into America, driven by persecution, and dreading the introduction of popery at home. Then the high price or reward of labour in the colonies, and want of Artisans there, drew over many, as well as the occasion of commerce; and when once people begin to migrate, every one has his little sphere of acquaintance and connections, which he draws after him, by invitation, motives of interest, praising his new settlement, and other encouragements. The “most substantial men” are descendants of those early settlers; new comers not having yet had time to raise estates. The practice of sending convicts thither, is modern; and the same indolence of temper and habits of idleness that make people poor and tempt them to steal in England, continue with them when they are sent to America, and must there have the same effects, where all who live well owe their subsistence to labour and business, and where it is a thousand times more difficult than here to acquire wealth without industry. Hence the instances of transported thieves advancing their fortunes in the colonies are extreamly rare, if there really is a single instance of it, which I very much doubt; but of their being advanc’d there to the gallows the instances are plenty. Might they not as well have been hang’d at home? We call Britain the mother country; but what good mother besides, would introduce thieves and criminals into the company of her children, to corrupt and disgrace them? And how cruel is it, to force, by the high hand of power, a particular country of your subjects, who have not deserv’d such usage, to receive your outcasts, repealing all the laws they make to prevent their admission, and then reproach them with the detested mixture you have made. “The emptying their jails into our settlements (says a writer of that country) is an insult and contempt, the cruellest

, in your paper of Tuesday the 17th past, said to be from an officer who attended Brigadier General Forbes in his march from Philadelphia to Fort Duquesne; but wrote probably by the same gentleman who wrote the former, as it seems calculated to raise the character of the officers of the certain northern latitude, at the expence of the reputation of the colonies, and the provincial forces. According to this letter-writer, if the Pensilvanians granted large supplies, and raised a great body of troops for the last campaign, it was not obedience to his Majesty’s commands, signified by his minister Mr. Pitt, zeal for the King’s service, or even a regard for their own safety; but it was owing to the “General’s proper management of the Quakers and other parties in the province.” The withdrawing of the Indians from the French interest by negotiating a peace, is all ascribed to the General, and not a word said to the honour of the poor Quakers who first set those negotiations on foot, or of honest Frederic Post that compleated them with so much ability and success. Even the little merit of the Assembly’s making a law to regulate carriages, is imputed to the General’s “multitude of letters.” Then he tells us, “innumerable scouting parties had been sent out during a long period, both by the General and Colonel Bouquet, towards Fort Duquesne, to catch a prisoner, if possible, for intelligence, but never got any.” How happened that? Why, “It was the Provincial troops that were constantly employed in that service,” and they, it seems, never do any thing they are ordered to do. That, however, one would think, might be easily remedied, by sending Regulars with them, who of course must command them, and may see that they do their duty. No; The Regulars are afraid of being shot by the Provincials in a Panick. Then send all Regulars. Aye; That was what the Colonel resolved upon. “Intelligence was now wanted (says the letter-writer). Col. Bouquet, whose attention to business was [only] very considerable [that is, not quite so great as the General’s, for he was not of the northern latitude] was determined to send no more Provincials a scouting.” And how did he execute this determination? Why, by sending “Major Grant of the Highlanders, with seven hundred men, three hundred of them Highlanders, the rest Americans, Virginians, and Pensilvanians!” No blunder this, in our writer; but a misfortune; and he is nevertheless one of those “acute sharp” men who are “fit for learning!” And how did this Major and seven hundred men succeed in catching the prisoner? Why, their “march to Fort Duquesne was so conducted that the surprize was compleat.” Perhaps you may imagine, gentle reader, that this was a surprize of the enemy. No such matter. They knew every step of his motions, and had, every man of them, left their fires and huts in the fields, and retired into the fort. But the Major and his 700 men, they were surprized; first to find no body there at night; and next to find themselves surrounded and cut to pieces in the morning; two or three hundred being killed, drowned, or taken prisoners, and among the latter the Major himself. Those who escaped were also surprized at their own good fortune; and the whole army was surprized at the Major’s bad management. Thus the surprize was indeed compleat; but not the disgrace; for Provincials were there to lay the blame on. The misfortune (we must not call it misconduct) of the Major was owing, it seems, to an unnamed and perhaps unknown Provincial officer, who, it is said, “disobeyed his orders and quitted his post.” Whence a formal conclusion is drawn, “That a Planter is not to be taken from the plow and made an officer in a day.” Unhappy Provincials! If success attends where you are joined with the Regulars, they claim all the honour, tho’ not a tenth part of your number. If disgrace, it is all yours, though you happen to be but a small part of the whole, and have not the command; as if Regulars were in their nature invincible, when not mix’d with Provincials, and Provincials of no kind of value without Regulars! Happy is it for you that you were present neither at Preston-Pans nor Falkirk, at the faint attempt against Rochfort, the rout of St. Cas, or the hasty retreat from Martinico. Every thing that went wrong, or did not go right, would have been ascribed to you. Our commanders would have been saved the labour of writing long apologies for their conduct. It might have been sufficient to say, Provincials were with us!  
But these remarks, which we only suppose may be made by the provok’d provincials, are probably too severe. The generals, even those who have been recall’d, had in several respects great merit, as well as many of the officers of the same nation that remain, which the cool discreet part of the provincials will readily allow. They are not insensible of the worth and bravery of the British troops in general, honour them for the amazing valour they manifested at the landing on Cape Breton, the prudence and military skill they show’d in the siege and reduction of Louisburg, and their good conduct on other occasions; and can make due allowance for mistakes naturally arising where even the best men are engag’d in a new kind of war, with a new and strange enemy, and in a country different from any they had before experienc’d. Lord Howe was their darling,  
†The assembly of the Massachusets-Bay have voted a sum of money for erecting a monument in Westminster-Abbey, to the memory of that Nobleman, as a testimony of their veneration for his virtues. A proof that their sense of merit is not narrow’d to a country.  
and others might be nam’d who are growing daily in their esteem and admiration. There are also among the regular officers, men of sentiments, concerning the colonies, more generous and more just than those express’d by these letter-writers; who can see faults even in their own corps, and who can allow the Provincials their share of merit; who feel pleasure as Britons, in observing that the children of Britain retain their native intrepidity to the third and fourth generation in the regions of America; together with that ardent love of liberty and zeal in its defence, which in every age has distinguish’d their progenitors among the rest of mankind. To conclude, in all countries, all nations, and all armies, there is, and will be a mixture of characters, a medley of brave men, fools, wisemen and cowards. National reflections being general, are therefore unjust. But panegyrics, tho’ they should be too general, cannot offend the subjects of them. I shall therefore boldly say, that the English are brave and wise; the Scotch are brave and wise; and the people of the British colonies, proceeding from both nations—I would say the same of them, if it might not be thought vanity in Your humble servant,  
A New Englandman

Hile the public attention is fo much  
turned towards America, every let»  
ter from thence that promifes new infor-  
mation, is pretty generally read; it feems  
therefore more neceffary that care fhou&#x27;d  
be taken to difabufe the public, when thofe  
letters contain facts falfe in themfelves,  
and reprefentations injurious to bodies of  
people, or even to private perfons.  
  
In your laft Magazine, I find an extra&amp;  
of aletter, faid to be from an officer who at-  
tended Brig, Gen, Forbes in bis march &#x27;from  
Philadelphia fo Fort Duquefne ; caltulated,  
as it theuld feem, to raife the charaéter of  
the officers of a certain northern latitude, at  
the expence of the reputation of the colo-  
nies, and the provincial forces, Accord-  
ing to this letter- writer, if the Ar atersay  
granted large fapplies, and raifed a great,  
body of troops for the Jatt campaign, ‘it  
Was not in obedience to his majefty’s com-  
mands, fignified by his majefty’s minifter  
Mr Pitt, zeal for’ the king’s fervace, or even  
a regard for their own fafety ; but it was

compleated. them with fo much ability and:  
fuccefs. Even the little merit of the af  
fembly’s.makiog a law to regulate carria-,  
ges, isimputed to the general’s ‘ multitude  
* of letters.” Then he telisus, ‘ innumes  
* rable fcouting parties had beeh fent out,,  
‘ dering Jong period, both by, the general,  
© and Col, Bouguet, towards Fort uefnes  
* tocatch a prifoner, if pofible, for intelli-  
* gence, but never got any.’---How hap-  
pened that ?+--Why, it.was the provincial,  
* troops that were confantly employed in  
* that fervioe,’ and they it feems, never do,  
any thing they are ordered to do,---Thar,  
however, one would think, might eafily be:  
remedied, by fending regu/ars with them,  
who of courfe muft command them, and  
may feethat they,do.theic duty. No 5 the  
regulars are afraid of being fhot. by the provin-.  
cialsin a pannich, Then tend all reguiars,—  
Aye ; that was what tee colonel refolved ups  
on.---* Intelligence was now wanted (fays  
the letter-writer) Col. Bowguct, whole ar-  
£ tention to bufinefs, was very confiderable,  
© was determined to fend No. MORE provin-  
* cials a fcouting.’---And how did he exe-  
cute this determination ? Why, by fending  
© Major Grant of the Highlanders, with fe-,  
© ven hundred meh, three hundred of them  
* Highlanders, tHe Rest Americans, Vir-  
© ginians,. and Penfilwanians !’---No blunder  
this, in our writer; but a misfyrtune {+-«  
And how did this major and feven hundred  
men fucceed in catching the prifoner ?--~  
Why, their ‘ march to Fort Duguefne was fo  
© conduéted that the furprife was complcat,’---  
Perhaps you may. imagine, gentle reader,  
that this was afurprize of the enemy.---  
No fuch matter. . They knew every itep of  
his motions, and had, every man of them,  
left their fires and huts in the fields, and re-  
tired into the fort.---But the major and his  
700 men, they were /urprined ; firft to find  
no body there at night ; and next to find  
themfelves furrounded and cut.to pieces in  
  
‘the morning ; two or three hundred being  
  
killed, drowned, or taken prifoners, and  
among thé latter the major himfelf. Thofe  
who efcaped were alfo furprized at their  
own good. fortune ; and the whole army  
were furprized at the major’s. bad manage-  
ment, Thus the /urprize was.indeed com-,  
  
_ pleat ---but not the ditgrace ; for provin-  
  
cials were there to lay the blame cn. The.  
misfortune (we muft not call it mifcondué) of  
the major was owing, it feems, to an un-  
named and perhaps unknown provincial of-  
ficer, who, it is faid, * difobeyed his orders  
© and quitted his poft.” “Whence a formal  
conclufionis drawn, ‘ that a planter is not  
te  
  
224  
“to be taken frém the plow and made an  
* officerin a day.’---Unbappy provinciais !  
Hf fuccefs attends where you are joined with  
the regulara, they claim all the honour, tho  
  
not a tenth part of yournumber. If dif-  
grace, it is all yours, though you happen to  
be but a fmall part of the whole, and have  
not the command 3; as if: régulars were in  
their nature invincible, when not mixed  
with provincials, and provincials of no kind  
of vaiue without regulars ! Happy itis for  
you that you were prefént neither at Preflon  
Pans nor Falkirk, at the faint attempt againft  
Rocbfort, the rout of St Cas, or the hafty  
retreat from Martintco,  
went wrong, or did not go right, would  
have been afcribéd to you. Our com-  
manders would have been faved the labour  
of writing long apoligies for their condu&amp;.  
It might have been fufficient to fay, piovin-  
cials were with us! .  
  
But thefe remarks, whith we only fup-  
pofe may be made by the provoked provin-  
cials, are probably too fevere. ‘The gene-  
rals, even thofe who have been recalled,  
had in feveral refpeéts great merit, as well  
as many of the officers of the fame nation  
that remain, which the cool difcreet part of  
the provincials wilt allow. They ‘are not  
infenfible of the worth and bravery of the  
Britifp troops in&#x27;general, honour them for  
the amazing valour they manifefted at the  
Jahding on Cape Breton, the prudence and  
military fkill they thowed in the fiege and  
reduction of Lowifbourg, and their good con-  
dué on other ocala and can make  
due allowance for miftakes naturally ari-  
fing where even the beft men are engaged  
ina new kind of war, with a new and  
ftrange enemy, and in a country different  
from any they had before experienced. Lord  
Howe was their darling, and others might  
be named who are growing daily in their  
efteem and admiration.---There are alfo  
among the regular officers, men of fenti-  
ments, concerning the colonies, more ge-  
merous and more juft than thofe expreffed  
by this letter-writer ; who can fee faults,  
even in their own corps, and who can allow  
the provincials their fhare of merit ; who  
fee! pleafure as Britons, in obferving that  
the children of Britain retain their native  
intrepidity to the third and fourth genera  
tion in the regions of America; together  
with that ardent love ¢f* liberty and zeal in  
its defence, which in every age has diftin-  
guithed their progenitors among the reft of  
mankind,---To conclude, in all countries,  
all nations, and all armi¢s, there is, and  
will be a mixture of characters, a medley  
of brave men, fools, wife men and cow-  
ards, National refieétions beiag general,  
  
are therefore unjuft. But panegyrics, tho’  
they fhould be too general, cannot offend  
the fubjeéts of them, I thail therefore bold-

Prudence, bow it operates in Life.

their refpect tor the mother country,  
and admiration of every thing that
