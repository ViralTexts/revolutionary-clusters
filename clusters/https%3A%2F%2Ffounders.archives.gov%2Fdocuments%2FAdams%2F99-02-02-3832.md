f Amity and a high sense of honor and justice should from any cause be interrupted in its execution and that the good purposes which it was intended to accomplish should not be speedily and satisfactorily effected. At the same time it is a source of consolation, that the parties to the treaty have expressly agreed “that they will from time to time readily treat of and concerning other articles and endeavour so to form them as that they may conduce to mutual convenience and tend to promote mutual satisfaction and friendship.” It may therefore be confidently hoped that the same spirit of Amity and the same sense of honor and justice which produced the Articles will lead

ee in the interpretation that is put on the 6th article of the Treaty of Amity, I propose to state the material points in which those differences of opinion have been exhibited and that the subject may be better understood I will here recite the fourth article of the Treaty of Peace and that part of the treaty of amity which describes the matters submitted to the board.  
Fourth Article of the Treaty of Peace  
“It is agreed that Creditors on either side shall meet with no lawful impediments to the recovery of the full value in sterling money of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.”  
Sixth Article of the Treaty of Amity  
“Whereas it is alledged by divers British merchants and others his Majesty’s subjects, that debts to a considerable amount which were bona fide contracted before the Peace still remain owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the United States and that by the operation of various lawful impediments since the peace, not only the full recovery of the said debts has been delayed, but also the value and security thereof have been in several instances impaired and lessened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the British Creditors cannot now obtain and actually have and receive full and adequate compensation for the losses and damages which they have thereby sustained. It is agreed that in all such cases where full compensation for such losses and damages cannot for whatever reason be actually obtained had and received by the said creditors in the ordinary course of Justice, the United States will make full and complete compensation for the same to the said creditors. But it is distinctly understood that this provision is to extend to such losses only as have been occasioned by the lawful impediments aforesaid and it is not to extend to losses occasioned by such insolvency of the debtors or other causes as would equally have operated to produce such loss if the said impediments had not existed, nor to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or negligence or wilful omission of the claimant &amp;c &amp;c.”  
In carrying into execution the 6th article of the treaty of amity, it became a subject of consideration at the Board what the treaty required the claimant to prove to entitle him to an award. It was urged on the part of the United States, that according to a reasonable interpretation of the Treaty of Amity the

sent dissented, stating on the Journals the ground of his dissent to be, “because a principle is laid down which throws the whole burden of proof upon the United States, in every case where legal impediments existed, contrary as it is believed to the clear principles of law and equity. By this decision the Creditor is excused from proving that his debtor was solvent at the expiration of the War, or that he has used due diligence for the recovery of his debt: to avoid the payment, the United States must prove the contrary in both instances.” A successor to the other American Commissioner, who on the

ns had given the true exposition to that resolution respecting the onus probandi in his reasons of dissent. The Majority of the Board say, “that the said resolution in the case of William Cunningham &amp; Co. by necessary implication lays down the rule in the matter in question, and on the plainest principles of reason for what ever deprived the connection of the means, is in the first instance to be held as the cause of his not arriving at the end, whatever in the positive institution of the law on the settled course of judicial practice prevented him from proceeding to the recovery of his debt, is to be deemed a lawful impediment which prevented such recovery, consequently the loss arising from his not recovering is in the first instance to be ascribed to the operation of the said lawful impediment, that the above propositions are primâ facie complete, standing on their own intrinsic evidence, and subject only to the effect of sufficient evidence to the contrary, so that it is not incumbent on the claimant to prove the solvency or capacity of the debtor to satisfy the creditor at or since the peace, but open to the United States to meet the primâ facie evidence already stated by reasonable evidence to the contrary.” No. 2.

 the same three Commissioners expressed an opinion that no sufficient cause had been shewn, why, in awarding full and adequate compensation for such Debts as should be proven within the intent and meaning of the Treaties, full interest should not be awarded for the detention and delay of payment during the war, as well as in time of Peace; but on the contrary, it was just that such interest should be awarded, according to the nature and import, express or implied, of the several contracts on which the claim is founded.

, that the Debts which were the subject of the resolution were payable in the then Colonies, now United States; and it being admitted by the Creditors, that for a considerable time there were no persons in the United States authorized to receive them, it appeared to him unreasonable that a debtor should be made subject to the payment of interest on a debt, while the absence of the Creditor rendered it impossible for him to discharge it and because immediately after the Peace, an abatement of interest during the war was generally allowed, on principles of equity, by the Creditors themselves, who made settlements to a great amount with that allowance; and judgments of courts, verdicts of Juries and awards of referees were at that time almost universally made, disallowing interest during the war, which he considered irresistable proof of the equity of the principle.  
The dissent being entered, the board on the same day resolved that in deciding against an objection to the payment of interest during the war, maintained generally and without regard to the nature and import of the contracts express or implied, they do not preclude but necessarily wave all objections to the payment of interest which may arise out of the contract or other special circumstances of the case.
