Washington July 17. 07.  
  
Your’s of the 11th. is recieved. in appointments to public office of mere profit I have ever considered  
faithful service in either our first or second revolution as giving preference of claim, and that appointments on that  
principle would gratify the public and strengthen that confidence so necessary to enable the Executive to direct the whole  
public force to the best advantage of the nation. of Mr. Bolling Robinson’s talents &amp; integrity I have long been  
apprised, and would gladly use them where talents &amp; integrity are wanting. I had thought of him for the vacant place of  
Secretary of the Orleans territory, but supposing the salary of 2000.D. not more than he makes by his profession &amp; while  
remaining with his friends, I have, in despair, not proposed it to him. if he would accept it, I should name him instantly  
with the greatest satisfaction. perhaps you could inform me on this point.  
With respect to Majr. Gibbons I do indeed recollect that in some casual conversation it was said that the  
most conspicuous accomplices of Burr were at home at his house; but it made so little impression on me that neither the  
occasion nor the person is now recollected. on this subject I have often expressed the principles on which I act with a  
wish they might be understood by the federalists in office. I have never removed a man merely because he was a federalist:  
I have never wished them to give a vote at an election but according to their own wishes. but as no government could  
discharge it’s duties to the best advantage of it’s citizens if it’s agents were in a regular course of thwarting instead  
of executing all it’s measures, and were employing the patronage &amp; influence of their offices against the government &amp;  
it’s measures, I have only requested they would be quiet, &amp; they should be safe: that if their conscience urges them to  
take an active &amp; zealous part in opposition, it ought also to urge them to retire from a post which they could not  
conscientiously conduct with fidelity to the trust reposed in them; &amp; on failure to retire I have removed them, that is
