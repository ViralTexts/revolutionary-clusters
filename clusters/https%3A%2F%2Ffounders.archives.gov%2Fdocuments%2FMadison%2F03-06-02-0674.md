e sacred to all, how have they been reviled, how even has my name been cursed by Federalists, but Glory be to God, the Holy Ghost, &amp; Jesus Christ in spite of the age of reason, in spite of the works of Voltaire, Hume, yea Rousseau &amp; John Marshal, I might say, C.J.U., we will conquer we will always have a majority of Republicans in the house of Congress, at least I trust so. I shall conclude this letter with a quotation from Milton’s Paradise lost, you may compare God &amp; his Angels to Republicans &amp; Congress (the Democratic part) Assembled. Satan &amp; the Angels of the Hellish regions to Federalists &amp; their principles, So saying a noble stroke he lifted high, which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell.  
On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,  
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield  
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge he back recoil’d;  
The tenth on bended knee His massive spear upstay’d; as if on  
earth winds under ground, or waters forcing way Sidelong had  
push’d a mountain from his seat Half sunk with all his pines.  
Amazement seiz’d  
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see  
Thus foil’d their mightiest; ours joy fill’d, and shout,  
Presage of victory, and fierce desire of Battle: I can no more.
