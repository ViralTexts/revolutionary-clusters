My Lord,  
Philadelphia April 22d 1793  
  
You might, from appearances, suspect me of inattention to the honor of your corrispondence: and if you should, I can assure you it would give me pain. Or you might conceive that, I had rather make excuses than acknowledge, in time, the receipt of your favors, as this is the second instance of considerable lapse between the dates of them and my acknowledgments: this also would hurt me—for the truth is, that your favor of the 22d of last Octobr, under cover of one from Doctr Anderson of the 3d of November, accompanying the 7th, 8, 9, 10 &amp; 11th volumes of the Bee, did not come to my hands until the 18th of the present month.  
Having by me the rough draught of the letter I had the honor of addressing to your Lordship in May, I do agreeably to your request, transmit a copy thereof. It is difficult for me, however, to account for the miscarriage or delay of the original, as it was  
  
committed to the care of Mr Robertson at his own request, to be forwarded along with the Portrait of me which (for the reasons therein assigned) a preference had been given of him to take for your Lordship—both of which I expected you had received long since.  
The works of Doctr Anderson do him much credit—and when they ar⟨e⟩ more extensively known will, I am persuaded, meet a very ready sale in this Country. I have taken an occasion to mention his wish to a respectable member of the Philosophical Society of this City, who has promised to bring his name forward at the next meeting: entertaining no doubt of his being readily admitted; as his pretensions are known to stand upon solid ground.  
The favorable wishes which Your Lordship has expressed for the prosperity of this young &amp; rising Country, cannot but be gratefully received by all its citizens, and every lover of it. One mean to the contribution of which, and its happiness, is very judiciously portrayed in the following words of your letter “to be little heard of in the great world of Politics” These words I can assure your Lordship are expressive of my sentiments on this head; and I believe it is the sincere wish of United America to have nothing to do with the Political intrigues, or the squabbles of European Nations; but on the contrary, to exchange Commodities &amp; live in peace &amp; amity with all the inhabitants of the earth; and this I am persuaded they will do, if rightfully it can be done. To Administer justice to, and receive it from every Power with whom they are connected will, I hope, be always found the most prominent feature in the Administration of this Country; and I flatter myself that nothing short of imperious necessity can occasion a breach with any of them. Under such a system if we are allowed to pursue it, the Agriculture and Mechanical Arts; the wealth and population of these States will encrease with that degree of rapidity as to baffle all calculation—and must surpass any idea your Lordship can, hitherto, have entertained on the occasion. To evince that our views (whether realised or not) are expanded, I take the liberty of sending you the Plan of a new City, situated about the centre of the Union of these States, which is designed for the permanent Seat of the Government. And we are at this moment deeply engaged, and far advanced in extending the inland navigation of the River (Potomac) on  
  
which it stands and the branches thereof through a tract of as rich Country—for hundreds of miles—as any in the world. Nor is this a solitary instance of attempts of the kind, although it is the only one which is near completion, &amp; in partial use. Several other very important ones are commenced and little doubt is entertained that in ten years if left undisturbed we shall open a communication by water with all the Lakes Northward &amp; Westward of us with which we have territorial connections; and an inland navigation in a few years more from Rhode Island to Georgia inclusively—partly by cuts between the great Bays &amp; Sounds—&amp; partly between the Islands &amp; Sand banks &amp; the Main from Albemarle sound to the River St Mary’s—To these, may also be added, the erection of bridges over considerable Rivers, &amp; the commencement of Turn-Pike Roads as further indications of the improvements in hand.  
The family of Fairfax’s in Virginia—of whom you speak—are also related to me by several intermarriages before it came into this Country (as I am informed) and since; and what remain of the old stock are near neighbours to my estate of Mount Vernon. The late Lord (Thomas) with whom I was perfectly acquainted—lived at the distance of Sixty miles from me after he had removed from Belvoir (the Seat of his kinsman) which adjoins my estate just mentioned; and is going to be inhabited by a young member of the family as soon as the house which some years ago was burnt can be rebuilt.

to the slow but certain benefits to be permanently obtained by peace and  
internal prosperity. He also recommended two great objects to the atten-

that non-interference is the American policy, but introduces his favorite  
scheme of internal improvements which would bind the sections together  
and make the Republic great as well as prosperous.  
  
My Lord, PHILADELPHIA, APRIL 22™ 1793.  
  
You might, from appearances, suspect me of inattention to the honor, of your corre-  
spondence :—and if you should, I can assure you it would give me pain.—Or you might  
conceive that, I had rather make excuses that acknowledge, in time, the receipt of your  
favors, as this is the second instance of considerable lapse between the dates of them and  
my acknowledgements :—this also would hurt me—for the truth is, that your favor of the  
22&quot;4 of last Octob&quot;. under cover of one from Doct: Anderson of the 3%4 of November,  
accompanying the 7‘ 8. 9. 10 and 11 volumes of the Bee, did not come to my hands  
until the 18 of the present month.  
  
Having by me the rough draught of the letter I had the honor of addressing to your  
Lordship in May, I do agreeably to your request, transmit a copy thereof.—It is difficult  
for me, however, to account for the miscarriage or delay of the original, as it was com-  
mitted to the care of Mr Robertson at his owm request, to be forwarded along with the  
Portrait of me which (for the reasons therein assigned) a preference had been given of  
him to take for your Lordship—both of which I expected you had received long since.—  
  
The works of Doct! Anderson do him much credit—and when they are more exten-  
sively known will, I am persuaded, meet a very ready sale in this Country.—I have taken  
occasion to mention his wish to a member of the Philosophical Society of this City, who  
has promised to bring his name forward at the next meeting :—entertaining no doubt of  
his being readily admitted ; as his pretensions are known to stand upon solid ground.  
  
The favorable wishes which your Lordship has expressed for the prosperity of this  
young and rising Country, cannot but be gratefully received by all its citizens, and every  
lover of it—One mean to the contribution of which, and its happiness, is very judiciously  
portrayed in the following words of your letter, ‘to be little heard of in the great world  
of Politics” These words I can assure your Lordship are expressive of my sentiments on  
this head ; and I believe it is the sincere wish of United America to have nothing to do  
with the Political intrigues, or the squabbles of European Nations; but on the contrary, to  
exchange commodities and live in peace and amity with all the inhabitants of the Earth ;  
and this I am persuaded they will do, if rightfully it can be done.—To administer justice

THE MONROE OOCTRINE AND CUIA.  
In a letter to the Karl of Du  
chan, dated April 22, 179J (says  
a correspondent of the Nation),  
George Washington expressed  
the opinion that it should be the;  
policy of the United States &quot;to  
be little heard of in the ereat  
world of politics.&quot; He further  
obseives, &quot;I believe it is the  
sincere wish of United America  
to have nothing to do with the  
political intrigues or the squabbles  
of Kuropean nations; but on the  
contrary, to exchange commodi­  
ties and live in peace with all the  
inhabitants of the earth, and this  
I am persuaded they will do if  
rightfully it can be done.&quot;  
This was wise advice at the  
time it was given 102 years ago.  
This country then contained but  
tour millions of pioneer people,  
oppressed by debts created by  
the war for independence. Would  
Washington give the same advice  
if he were now President of a  
rich, powerful nation of 70 mill-  
  
ions? The population of the  
  
United States in 1793 was nearly  
a million less than that of Illinois  
at this time, while the wealth was  
less than half the value of that in  
this State. It is true that little  
boats should keep near the shore,  
but larger ones may venture  
further out. The people of the

nothing short of imperious necessity can

to recommend as great objects to the

private affairs and indicates that Gen.  
Washington and Lord Buchan. were

.-■-- PEACE AND UNITY.  
&quot;The favorable wishes which your  
lordship has expressed for the pros­  
perity of the young and rising coun­  
. try cannot but be gratefully received  
by all its citizens and every lover of  
—one means to the contribution of  
which, and its happiness, is very judi­  
ciously portrayed in these words of  
your letter—&#x27;to be little heard of In the  
great world of politics.&#x27; These words,  
I can assure your lordship, are expres­  
sive of my sentiments on this head.  
And I believe It Is the sincere wish  
of United America to have nothing to  
. do with the political Intrigues or the  
squabbles of European nations; but, on  
the contrary, to exchange commodities  
and live In peace and unity with all  
the Inhabitants of the earth, and this  
I am persuaded they will do if right­  
fully it can be done. To administer  
justice, to and receive it from every  
power with whom they are connected  
will. I hope, be always found a most  
prominent feature in -the administra­  
tion of this country. . And I flatter my­  
self that nothing short of imperious  
necessity can occasion a breach with  
any of them. Under such a system, if  
we are allowed to pursue it, the agri­  
culture and mechanical arts, the wealth  
and population of these states will in­  
crease with that degree of rapidity as  
to baffle all calculations and must sur­  
pass any idea your lordship can hith­  
erto have entertained on the occasion.  
To evince that our views (whether real­  
ized or not) are expanded, I take the  
liberty of sending you the plan of a  
, new city, situated about the -center of  
the union of these states, which is de­  
signed for the permanent seat of the  
government—and we are at this mo­  
ment deeply engaged and far advanced  
in extending the interest and naviga­  
tion of the river (Potomac), on the way  
it stands and the branches thereof,  
through a tract of rich country for  
hundreds of miles as any in the world.  
&#x27; &quot;Nor Is this a solitary instance of  
attempts of the kind, although It is  
the only one which is near completion  
and in partial use. Several other im­  
portant ones are commenced and little  
doubt is entertained that in ten years,  
if left undisturbed, we shall open a  
communication by water with all the  
lakes northward and westward of us,  
with which we have territorial connec­

few years more from Rhode Island to  
Georgia. Inclusively, partly by cuts be­  
tween the great bays and sounds and  
partly between the islands and sand  
banks from the main from Albemarle

To eviuce that our views, whether  
realized or not, are expanded I take the

city, situated about the center of the  
Union of these states, which is designed  
for the perniuuent seat of the govern­

ing the inland navigation of the river

branches thereof through a tract of as  
rich country for hundreds of miles as  
any in the world. Nor is this a solitary

Georgia, inclusive, partly by cuts be­

peace and internal prosperity. I ventur­  
ed also to recommend as the great ob­  
jects to the executive of America peace  
and union with the red natives and at­  
tention to national education.”  
To these sentiments the president an­  
swered in the following letter. The first  
part of the letter relates to private af­  
fairs and indicates that General Wash­  
ington and Lord Buohan were old and  
intimate friends. Then the letter pro­  
ceeds to the subject matter as follows:  
“The favorable wishes which your  
  
lordship has expressed for the prosperity  
of this young and rising country cannot  
but be gratefully received by all its citi­  
zens and every lover of it, one means to

following words of your letter: ‘To be  
little heard of in the great world of pol­

lordship, are expressive of my sentiments  
on this head, and I believe it is the sin­

and it is not believed that it has ever
