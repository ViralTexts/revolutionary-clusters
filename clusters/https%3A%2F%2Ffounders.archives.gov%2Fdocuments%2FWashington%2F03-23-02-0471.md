Morris-town Decr 15th 1779  
  
I had the pleasure of receiving a few days since by Capt. Bruin your letter of the 1st instant. I assure you, my Dear Sir, I am sensibly touched by so striking an instance of your friendship, at a time and in a manner, that demonstrates its sincerity and confirms the opinion I have always entertained of your sentiments towards me. I wish you to believe, that your uneasiness on the score you mention had never the least foundation. A slender acquaintance with the world must convince every man that actions, not words are the true criterion of the attachment of his friends, and that the most liberal professions of good-will are very far from being the surest marks of it. I should be happy that my own experience had afforded fewer examples of the little dependence to be placed on them.  
I am particularly indebted to you for the interesting information you give me of the views of a certain party. Against intrigues of this kind, incident to every man in a public station, his best support will be a faithful discharge of his duty, and he must rely on the justice of his country for the event.  
I flatter myself it is unnecessary for me to repeat to you how high a place you hold in my esteem—The confidence you have experienced and the manner in which you have been employed on several important occasions testify the value I set upon your military qualifications and the regret I must feel that circumstances have deprived the army of your services—The pleasure  
  
I shall always take in an interchange of good offices in whatever station you may hereafter be placed will be the best confirmation of the personal regard with which I have been and am very truly and sinc

Remember, we may not always know  
the right, and that is why we must study  
it But let our intentions always be  
for the right, even though we may make  
a mistake.  
The great secret of making the labors  
or university life, or of other lite, easy,  
is to do each duty every day. If you let  
a burden of arrears accumulate, it will  
discourage you.  
It is generally safe to be suspicious  
of the suspicious man. The person who  
has a doubt may be wrong, but he is at  
least justified in holding the opinion  
that the suspicious individual judges  
others by himself.

Be very circumspect in the choice of  
thy company. In the society of thine  
equals thou shalt enjoy more pleasure;  
in the society of thy superiors thou shalt  
find more profit To be the best in the  
company is the way to grow worse; the  
best means to grow better is to be the  
worst there.  
Let each one test his ambitions and  
see to it that they are worthy in them­  
selves and laid on solid foundations, re­  
membering that the truly valuable man
