Sir,  
Philada Mar: 16th 1795  
  
Ever since the General Assembly of Virginia were pleased to submit to my disposal fifty shares in the Potomak, and one hundred in the James River company, it has been my anxious desire to appropriate them to an object, most worthy of public regard.  
It is with indescribable regret that I have seen the youth of the United States migrating to foreign countries, in order to acquire the higher branches of erudition and to obtain a knowledge of the Sciences. Altho it would be injustice to many to pronounce the certainty of their imbibing maxims, not congenial with republicanism; it must nevertheless be admitted that a serious danger is encountered by sending abroad among other political systems, those who have not well learned the value of their own.  
The time is therefore come when a plan of Universal education ought to be adopted in the United States. Not only do the exigencies of public &amp; private life demand it; but if it should ever be apprehended that prejudice would be entertained in one part of the Union against another; an efficatious remedy will be, to assemble the youth of every part under such circumstances, as  
  
will, by the freedom of intercourse and collision of sentiment, give to their minds the direction of truth, philanthropy and mutual conciliation.  
It has been represented, that an University corrisponding with these ideas, is contemplated to be built in the federal city; and that it will receive considerable endowments. This position is so eligable from its centrality—so convenient to Virginia, by whose legislature the shares were granted, and in which part of the federal district stands—and combines so many other conveniences, that I have determined to vest the Potomak shares in that University.  
Presuming it to be more agreeable to the general assembly of Virginia, that the shares in the James River company should be reserved for a similar object in some part of that State, I intend to allot them for a seminary to be erected at such place, as they shall deem most proper.  
I am disposed to believe, that a seminary of learning upon an enlarged plan, but yet not coming up to the full idea of an University, is an institution to be preferred for the position which is to be chosen. The students, who wish to pursue the whole range of science, may pass with advantage from the seminary to the University, and the former by a due relation may be rendered cooperative with the latter.  
I cannot however dissemble my opinion, that if all the shares were conferred on an University, it would become far more important, than when they are divided; and I have been constrained from concentering them in the same place, merely by my anxiety to reconcile a particular attention to Virginia, with a great good, in which she will abundantly share, in common with the rest of the United States.  
I must beg the favor of your Excellency to lay this letter before that honorable body, at their next session; in order that I may appropriate the James river shares to the place which they may prefer. They will at the sametime again accept my acknowledgments for the opportunity, with which they have favored me, of attempting to supply so important a desideratum in the United States as an University, adequate to our necessity and a preparatory seminary. With great consideration &amp; respect I am Sir Your most O

Sir:—Ever since the General Assembly of Virginia were pleased to submit to  
my. disposal fifty shares in the Potomac, and one hundred in the James River  
Company, it has been my anxious desire to appropriate them to an object most  
worthy of public regard.  
  
It is with indescribable regret, that I have seen the youth of the United  
States migrating to foreign countries, in order to acquire the higher branches of  
erudition, and to obtain a knowledge of the sciences. Although it would be  
injustice to many to pronounce the certainty of their imbibing maxims not  
congenial with republicanism, it must nevertheless be admitted, that a serious  
danger is encountered by sending abroad among other political systems those  
who have not’well learned the value of their own.  
  
The time is therefore come. when a plan of universal education ought to be  
adopted in the United States. Not only do the exigencies of public and private  
life demand it, but, if it should ever be apprehended, that prejudice would be  
entertained in one part of the Union against another, an efficacious remedy will  
be, to assemble the youth of every part under such circumstances as will, by  
the freedom of intercourse and collision of sentiment, give to their minds the  
direction of truth, philanthropy, and mutual conciliation.  
  
It has been represented, that a university corresponding with these ideas is  
contemplated to be built in the Federal City, and that it will receive considera-  
ble endowments. This position is so eligible from its centrality, so convenient  
to Virginia, by whose legislature the shares were granted and in which part of  
the Federal District stands, and combines so many other conveniences, that I  
have determined to vest the Potomac shares in that university.  
  
Presuming it to be more agreeable to the General Assembly of Virginia, that  
the shares in the James River Company should be reserved for a similar object  
in some part of that State, I intend to allot them for a seminary to be erected  
at such place as they shall deem most proper. I am disposed to believe, that a  
seminary of learning upon an enlarged plan, but yet not coming up to the full  
idea of a university, is an institution to be preferred for the position which is td  
be chosen. The students, who wish to pursue the whole range of science, may  
pass with advantage from the seminary to the university, and the former by a  
due relation may be rendered codperative with the latter.  
  
I can not however dissemble my opinion, that if all the shares were conferred

vided; and I have been constrained from concentering them in the same place,

shares to the place which they may prefer. They will at the same time again

&quot;It Is with Indescribable regret,&quot; said  
he, &quot;that I have seen the youth of the  
United States migrating to foreign  
countries iu order to acquire the higher  
branches of erudition and to obtain a  
  
knowledge of the sciences. Although  
  
it would be injustice to many to pro  
  
nounce- the certainty of their imbibing  
  
principles not congenial to republican  
  
Ism, it must nevertheless ba admitted  
that a serious danger is encountered  
by sending abroad among other politi  
  
cal systems those who huve not well  
  
learned the value of their own.  
  
&quot;The time Is therefore come when a  
  
plan of universal education ought to be  
adopted in the United States. Not only  
do the exigencies of public and private  
  
life demand it, but if should ever be  
apprehended that if prejudice should  
be entertained in one part of the Union  
against the other, an efficacious remedy  
  
will be to assemble the youth of every  
part under such circumstances as will,  
by freedom of Intercourse and collision  
  
of sentiment, give to their minds the  
  
direction of truth, philanthropy and  
  
mutual conciliation.&quot;  
  
The necessity for a tru&#x27;.y national uni  
  
versity at Washington is even greater  
  
today than it was when the father ot  
  
his country so earnestly pleaded for one.
