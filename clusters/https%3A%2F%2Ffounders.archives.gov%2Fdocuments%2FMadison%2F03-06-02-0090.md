[4 March 1813]  
About to add the solemnity of an oath, to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me, I find in the presence of this respectable assembly, an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence, and of the responsibility united with it. The impressions on me are strengthened by such an evidence, that my faithful endeavours to discharge my arduous duties, have been favorably estimated, and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed. From the weight and magnitude now belonging to it, I should be compelled to shrink, if I had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people; and felt less deeply a conviction, that the war with a powerful nation which forms so prominent a feature in our situation, is stamped with that justice, which invites the smiles of heaven on the means of conducting it to a successful termination.  
May we not cherish this sentiment without presumption, when we reflect on the characters by which this war is distinguished?  
It was not declared on the part of the United States, until it had been long made on them, in reality, tho’ not in name; until arguments and expostulations had been exhausted; until a positive declaration had been received, that the wrongs provoking it, would not be discontinued; nor until this last appeal could no longer be delayed, without breaking down the Spirit of the nation, destroying all confidence in itself, and in its political Institutions; and, either perpetuating a State of disgraceful suffering, or regaining, by more costly sacrifices and more severe struggles, our lost rank and respect, among Independent powers.  
On the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the High Seas, and the security of an important class of citizens, whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other class. Not to contend for such a stake, is to surrender our equality with other powers, on the Element common to all, and to violate the sacred title, which every member of the Society, has to its protection. I need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice, by which our mariners are forced at the will of every cruising officer from their own vessels, into foreign ones; nor paint the outrages inseperable from it. The proofs are in the records of each successive administration of our Government: and the cruel sufferings of that portion of the American people, have found their way to every bosom, not dead to the sympathies of human nature.  
As the war was just in its origin, and necessary and noble in its objects, we can reflect with a proud satisfaction, that in carrying it on, no principle of justice or honor, no usage of civilized nations, no precept of courtesy or humanity, have been infringed. The war has been waged on our part with scrupelous regard to all those obligations; and in a spirit of liberality, which was never surpassed.  
How little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the Enemy?  
They have retained as prisoners of war, citizens of the United States, not liable to be so considered, under the usages of war.  
They have refused to consider as prisoners of war, and threatened to punish as traitors and deserters, persons emigrating without restraint to the United States; incorporated by naturalization into our political family, and fighting under the authority of their adopted Country, in open and honorable war, for the maintenance of its rights and safety. Such is the avowed purpose of a Government, which is in the practice of naturalizing, by thousands, citizens of other countries, and not only permitting but compelling them, to fight its battles against their native Country.  
They have not, it is true, taken into their own hands the Hatchet &amp; the knife devoted to indiscriminate massacre; but they have let loose the savages armed with these cruel instruments; have allured them into their service, &amp; carried them to battle by their sides: eager to glut their savage thirst, with the blood of the vanquished, and to finish the work of torture and death, on maimed and defenceless captives. And what was never before seen, British Commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valour of our troops, by presenting to the symphany of their chief, awaiting massacres from their savage associates.  
And now we find them, in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare, supplying the place of a conquering force, by attempts to disorganize our political society, to dismember our confederated Republic. Happily, like others, these will recoil on the authors: but they mark the degenerate councils from which they emanate: and if they did not belong to a series of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder, as proceeding from a Government which founded the very war in which it has been so long engaged, on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary.  
  
To render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous, the reluctance to commence it, was followed by the earliest and Strongest manifestations, of a disposition to arrest its progress. The Sword was scarcely out of the Scabbard, before the Enemy was apprized of the reasonable terms on which it would be resheathed. Still more precise advances were repeated, and have been received in a spirit, forbidding every reliance, not placed on the military resources of the nation.  
These resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable issue. Our Nation is in number more than half that of the British Isles. It is composed of a brave, a free, a virtuous, and an intelligent people. Our Country abounds in the necessaries, the arts, and the comforts of life. A general prosperity is visible in the public countenance. The means employed by the British Cabinet to undermine it, have recoiled on themselves; have given to our national faculties a more rapid developement; and draining or diverting the precious metals from British circulation &amp; British vaults, have poured them into those of the United States. It is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable war, should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions required to support it. When the public voice called for war, all knew and still know, that without them, it could not be carried on through the period, which it might last; and the patriotism, the good sense, and the manly spirit of our fellow Citizens, are pledges for the cheerfulness with which they will bear, each his share, of the common burden. To render the war short, and its success sure, animated and systematic exertions alone are necessary; and the Success of our arms now, may long preserve our Country from the necessity of another resort to them. Already have the gallant exploits of our naval heroes, proved to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element. If the reputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other; presaging flashes of heroic enterprize, assure us that nothing is wanted to correspondent triumphs there also, but the discipline &amp; habits which are in daily progress.

It was not declared on the part of the

the wrongs provoking it would not be  
discontinued ; nor until this last appeal  
could no longer be delayed, without ;  
breaking down the spirit of the nation,  
destroying all confidence in itself and in 1  
its political institutions ; and either per­  
petuating a state of disgraceful suffer­  
ing, or regaining, by more costly sacri­  
&#x27;fires ai d more severe struggles, our  
lost rank and respect among independ­  
ent powers.  
On the issue of the war are staked  
rur national sovereignty on the high

successive administration cl our go­

that portion of the American people  
have found their way every bosom  
not dead to the sympathies of human na­  
ture.  
As the war was just in its origin, and  
  
necessary and noble in its objects, we  
can reflect with a proud satisfaction,  
that, in earning it on, no principle of  
justice or honor, no usage of civilized  
nations, no precept of courtesy or hu

has been waged on our part, with scru

The President’s Speech. |  
  
Wasuinetron, March 4th, 1813.  
  
At 12 o’clock this day, James Manison, the Pre-  
sident of the United States, elect, having attended  
at the Cupitol for the purpose of taking the oath of  
office, delivered to the vast concourse of people as-  
sembled on the occasion, tlre following speech :  
About to add the solemnity of an oath to the  
obligations imposed by a second call to the station,  
  
in Which my country has heretofore placed me; I  
  
find, in the presence of this assembly, an opportu-  
  
nity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so  
distinguished a confidence, and of the responsibility  
united with it. The impressions on me are strength-  
ened by such an evidence, that my faithful endea-  
vors to discharge my. arduous duties have been fa-  
vorably estimated; and by a consideration of the  
raomentuous period at which the trust has been r ]  
rewed. From the weight and magnitude now be-  
  
longing to it, I should be compelled to shrink, if I  
  
had less reliance on the support of an enlightened  
  
and generous people, and felt less deeply a convic-  
tion, that the war which forms so prominent a fea-  
ture in our situation, is stamped with that justice,  
which invites the smiles of heaven on the means of  
conducting it toa successful termination.  
  
May we not cherish this sentiment without pre-  
sumption, when we reflect on the characteristes by  
which this war is distinguished ?  
  
It was not declared on the part of the United  
  
States, until it had been long made on them, in reali-  
  
ty though not in name; until arguments and expos-  
  
tulations had been exhausted; untila positive de  
eluration had been received, that the wrongs provok-  
ing it would not bediscontinued; nor until this ap-  
peal could-no longer be delayed, without breaking  
down the spirit of the: nation, destroying all con-  
fidence in itself and its political institutions; and  
either perpetuating a state of disgraceful suffering,  
or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more se-  
vere struggles, our lost rank and respect among in-  
dependent powers.  
  
On the issue ef the war are staked our national  
sovereignty on the high seas, and security of an im-  
portant class of citizens, whose occupations give the  
preper value to those of every other class. Not to  
contend forsuch a stake, is to surrender our equality  
with other powers, on the element: common to all;  
and to violate the sacred title, which every member  
of: the society has: toits protection: Ineed not call  
into view the unlawfulness of the practice, by which  
our mariners are forced, at the will of every cruiz-  
ing oflicer, from their own vessels. into foreign ones,  
nor paint the outrages inseparable from it. The  
proots are in the records of each suecessive.admini-  
stration of our government; and the cruel sufferings  
of that pertion of the American people have found  
their way to every man’s bosom -not dead to the syin-  
pathies of human nature.  
  
As the war was just in its origin and necessary -  
  
and noble in its objects, we can reflect witha proud  
  
precept of courtesy or humanity have been infringed.  
The war has been waged on our part, with scrupu-  
lous regard to all thesé relations, and in a spirit of,  
liberality which was never surpassed. . 5  
  
How little has been the effect of this example on  
  
|the conduct of the enemy ?  
  
They have retained as prisoners of war citizens  
of the United States, not liable to be so considered  
under the usages of war. |  
They have refused to consider as prisoners of  
war, and threatened to punish as traitors and de-  
serters, persons emigrating without restraint to the  
United States ; incorporated by naturalization into’  
our political family, and fighting under the authority.  
of their adopted country, in open and honorable war,  
for the maintainance of its rights and safety. Such  
is the avowed purpose of a government, which is in  
the practice of naturalizing, by thousands, citizens  
of other countries, and not only of permittmg but  
compelling them to fight its battles against their  
native country.  
  
They have not, it is true, taken into their own  
hands the hatchet and the knife, devoted to indiscri-  
nate massacre ; but they have let loose the savages  
armed with these cruel instruments; have allured  
them into their service, and carried them to battle by  
their sides, eager to glut their savage thirst with the  
blood of the vanquished, and to finish the work of  
torture and death on maimed and defenceless cap-  
tives. And what was never before seen, British  
commanders have extorted victory over the uncor-  
querable valor of our troops, by presenting to the  
sympathy of their chief awaiting massacre from  
their savage associates.  
  
And now we find them in further contempt of the  
modes of honorable warfare supplying the piace of 2  
conquering force, by attempts to disorganise our po-  
litical society, to dismember our confederated re-  
public. Happily, like others, these will recoil on  
the authors; but they mark the degenerate councils  
from which they emanate ; and if they did not be-  
long to a series of unexampled inconsistencies, might  
excite the greater wonder, as proceeding froma go-  
vernment which founded the very war in which it  
has been so long engaged, against the disorganising  
and insurrectional policy of its adversary.  
  
To render the justice of the war on our part the  
more conspicuous, the reluctance to commence if,  
was followed by the-earliest and-strengest manifes-  
tations of a disposition to arrest its progress. The  
sword was scarcely out of the scabbard, before the  
enemy was apprized of the reasoriable terms on  
which it shou!d be re-sheathed. Still more precise

pubticl) repeating m / profound sense of so  
distinct; -ut* ct-ubtiti t c, and of the re­  
sponsibility united with it. The impressi  
on&gt; on me are s rengthened by such an e­  
victencte, that a faithful endeavors to dis­  
charge n \ arduous dutits have been fa­  
vorably estimated t and by a consideration  
ot tlie momentous period at which the trust  
h.is been venev. t «l. From the weicht and  
  
magnitude now belonging to it, 1 should be  
compelled to shrink, it 1 liad less reliance  
cn the suppo rt of an enlightened ami gen­  
* runs people,.and fe t less deeply a crnv.c­  
lit’ii, that the war with a powerful nation,  
winch forms so prominent a feature in onr  
situation, is stamped with that justice, which  
invites he smi:os of 1 leaven on the means  
of conducting it to asuccesslul termination.  
May we not cherish this sentiment, with­  
out j reinuiption, when.v.c reflect oh the  
Characters by which this war Is distinguish  
cd &gt; I  
It was not declared on the part of the U. !  
Stales, until it had been long made on  
them, in reality, though not in name; until  
arguments and expostulations had been ex  
haunted; until a positive declaration had  
l een received, that ihc wrongs provoking  
it would not be discontinued ; nor until this  
last appeal could r.o ,longer lie delayed,  
without breaking down the. spirit of the&quot; na­  
tion, destroying all confidence in itself and  
in its political institutions ; and either per- &#x27;  
petuating a state of disgraceful suffering, or  
regaining by more costly sacrifices and  
more severe struggles, our lost rank and  
respect among independent powers.  
On the issue of the war are staked our  
rational sovereignty on the high seas, and  
the security of au important class of citi­  
zens, whose occupations give the proper  
value to those of every other class. Not  
to contend for such a^stake, is to surrender  
our equality with other powers, on the ele­  
ment common to all; and to violate the  
sacred title, which every member of the so  
cicty lias to its protection. I need not call  
into view the unlawfulness of the practice,  
by which our mariners are forced, at the  
will of every cruising officer, from their  
own vessels into foreign ones, nor paint the  
outrages inseparable from it. The proofs  
are in the records of each successive ad­  
ministration of our government; and the  
cruel sufferings of that portion of the Ame­  
rican people have tound their way to everv  
bosom not dead to the sympathies of human  
nature.  
  
As the war was just in its origin and ne  
cessan : 111 noble in iis objects, we can  
reflect with a proud satisfaction, that, in  
carrying it on, no principle of justice or  
lienor, uo u:agc of civilized nations, no pi e  
cept of courtesy or humanity ha\e been in­  
1 ringed. The war has been waged an our  
part, witli scrupulous regard to all these  
obligations and in a spirit of liberality which  
was never surpassed.  
How little has been the effect of this ex­  
ample on the conduct ol tho enemy ?  
1 heyr have ictained as prisoners of war  
citizens of the United States, not liable to  
be so considered under the usages of war  
liny have refused to consider as prison­  
ers of war4 and threatened to punish as  
traitors and deserters, persons emigrating  
without restraint to the United States ; hi  
corpora ted by naturalization into our po­  
litical family, ami fighting under the au­  
thority of their ad pted country, in open  
and honorable war, for the maintenance of  
its rights and safety. Such is the avowed  
purpose of a government, which is in the  
practice of naturalizing, by thousands, ci­  
tizens of other countries, and not only of  
permitting but compelling them to fight its  
battles against their native countrv.  
1 hey have not, it is true, taken into their  
own hands the hatchet and the knife, devo­  
ted to indiscrimiate massacre; bat they have  
let loose the savages armed with these cruel  
instruments; have adored them into their  
ervise, and carried them to battle by their  
sides, eager to glut their savage thirst with  
I the blood of the vanquished, and to finish  
the w* rk of t&lt; inure and death on maimed &amp;  
deem cl* ss captives. And what was never  
b fore evil, Bntisii commanders have ex­  
torted victory over the unconquerable valor  
ot our troops, by presenting to the sympa­  
thy of their chief awaiting massacre from  
their savrgo associates.  
And now we find them, in further con­  
tempt of the modes of honorable warfare,  
supplying the pi ice of a conquering force,  
by attempts to disorganise our poliil’cvl so­  
ciety, to dismember our confederated Ke­  
puhlic. Happily, like others, these will recoil  
on the authors: but they&#x27;mark the deger e  
r He councils from winch they emanate ; and  
it they did nut belong to a series of unexam­  
pled inconsistencies, might excite the grea  
ter wonder, as proceeding from a govern­  
ment winch founded the very war in which  
it has been so’long engaged, on a charge u­  
gaiiist the disorganizing and insurrectional  
policy of its adversary.  
  
1 o render the justice Of tlie war on our  
pari the more conspicuous, the reluctance tn  
commence it w.is followed by the curliest 6c  
strongest manifestations of a disposition to  
art eat its progress The sword was scarce*­  
ly out of the scabbard, Lcfnic the enemy was  
apprized of the reasonable terms on which  
it would be re-sheathed. Still more precise  
advances were repeated, and have been ie­  
ceived in a spirit forbidding every reliance,  
not placed on the inditaiy resources of the  
| nation.  
Tnese resources are amply sufficient to  
bring the war to kii honorable issue. Our  
nation is, in number, more thaha&#x27;nlf that of  
tiie British isles. It is compost d of a brave,  
a free, a virtuous hnd an intelligent people  
Our country abounds in the necessaries, the  
arts and the comforts of life. A general  
pro: peritv is visible in the public r.oontr­  
nance. The means employed by the British  
cabinet to undctei mine it, have receded on  
thcmselve ; have given to our national fncol­  
ties a more rapid develop#-ment; and, drain­  
ing or diverting the precious metals from  
  
I British circulation and BriiMi v*u!ti, hare  
| poured them into these of the U. Sutes. Ji  
is a propitious consideration, that an mu.  
voidable *vur.should have fool cl t his sv-;i soli ru­  
ble facility f &gt;rthe conlr&#x27;buti n- re piir*.d to  
support it. When the public voice called for  
war all knew and still know, that with­  
out them it could not be carried on, thro’ ]  
the period which it might last ; and the.  
patriotism, the good sense, and the manly  
spirit of our fellow-citizens, are pledges  
for the cheerfulness with which they will  
bear each his share of the common burden.  
Io render tiie war short, and its success  
sure, animated and systematic exertions a­  
lone are necessary ; and the success of our  
arms now may long preserve cur country  
from the necessity of another reaort totlu m.  
Already have the gallant exploits ef mu  
naval heroes proved to the world our inher­  
ent capacity to maintain our rights on one  
element. If the reputation of&lt; ur arms has  
been thrown under clouds on the other, pre­

responsibility united with it. The impres  
sions on me are strengthened by such an ev­  
idence, that my faithful endeavors to dis­

rably estimated ; and by a Consideration of  
the momentous period at which the trust  
has been renewed. From the weight ami

which forms so prominent a feature in our  
situation; i* stamped v/itb that justice,  
which invites the stndes of heaven un the  
means of conducting it to a successful ter  
mi intion.  
May we not cherish this sentiment,  
without presumption, when wc reRew on !  
the characters by which this war is distin­  
guished ■  
It w«s not declared oh tbs part of the U.  
States, until it bad been long marie on them  
in reality, though not in name; until argu- i  
ments Sc expostulations! had been exhaust i  
cd ; until a positive declaration bid been I

stale «f disgraceful stiff ring, or regaining, t  
bv more costly sacrifices Cc more severe sfrug i

dent powers. t  
On toe issue of the war are staked our ,  
outiwK»al Sttvereignty on the high and c  
  
lie security of an important class of citizens 1  
&quot;these occupations give the proper value to  
hose of every other class. Not to contend  
t such a stake, is to surrender our equal­  
ly with other powers, on the element com­  
mon to all ; and to violate the sacred title,  
which every member of the society has to  
ts protection. 1 need not call into view  
ihe unlawfulness of «he practice, by which  
mu mariners are forced, at the will of ev­  
ery cruising officer, from their own vessels  
into f-reign ones, nor paint the outrages in­  
separable from it. The proofs are in the  
records of each successive administration I  
of our government; and the cruel sufferings ,  
of that pot lion of the Ametican people have j  
found their way to every bosom not dead to i  
the syntpath.es of human nature.  
As the war was just in its origin, and ne­  
cessary ami noble in its objects, we can re  
fleet with a proud satisfaction, that in car­  
rying it on, no principle of justice or honor,  
i o usage of civilized nations, no precept of I  
courtesy or hnmaimy have been infringed. I  
The war has been waged on our part, with  
scrupulous regard to all these obligations  
**nd in a spit it of liberality which was nev­  
er surpassed.  
How little hasbeeen the efiect of this ex  
ample on the conduct of the enemy !  
They have retained as prisoners of war  
citizens of the United States, not liable  
to be so considered under the usages of  
war. . ,  
They have refused to consider na prison­  
ers-of war. and threatened to punish as  
traitors and deserters, persons emigrating  
without restraint to the United States; in  
| corporatevl by naturalization into oar polit  
ical family, and fighting under the author­  
ity of their adopted country, in open and  
honorable war, for the maintenance of its  
v.gli-s and .safety. Such is the avowed pur  
pose of a government, which is in the prac­  
tice of naturalizing by thousands, citizens  
j ol other countries and not only of permitting  
but compelling.them to light its battles a­  
gamst their native, country.  
  
m. in y ii.iyc r.ui,,. ib u ue, xaxen into tnor  
own hands the hatchet and the knife, de  
voted to indiscriminate massacre ; bu  
they have let loose the ravages armed with  
these cruel instruments; have allured  
them into their service, and carried them  
to battle by their sides, eager to glut their  
savage thirst with the blood of the van­  
quished, and to finish the work of torture  
a.itl death on maimed and defenceless  
ciptives. An 1 what was never before  
seen, British commanders have extorted  
victory oxer the unconquerable valor of our  
troops, b &#x27; presenting to the sympathy of  
their chief awaiting massacre from their sa  
vage associates.  
And now we find them, in further con­  
tempt of the modes of honorable warfare,  
supplying the place of a conquering force,  
by attempts to disorganise our political so  
ciety.to dismember our confederated lie­  
public. Happily like others, these will recoil  
on the authors ; but they mark the degenc*  
rate councils from xvhich they emanate ;  
and it they did not belong to a series of  
| unexampled inconsistencies, might excite  
: *•*£ greater wonder, as proceeding from a  
[government which founded the very war  
in which it has been so long engaged on a  
charge against the disorganizing and insur­  
rectional policy of its adversary.  
1 o render the justice of the war on our  
part the more coiispiru us, the reluctance  
to commence it was followed by the earli­  
est and strongest manifestations of a dispo­  
sition to arrest its progress. The sxvord  
.was scarcely out of the scabbard, before  
the enemy was apprized of the reasona­  
ble terms on which it would be re-sheath  
r d. Still more precise adx&#x27;ances were re­  
peated, and have been received in a spirit  
forbidding every reliance, not placed on  
ihe military resources of the nation.  
These resources are amply sufficient to  
bring the war to an honorable issue. Our  
nation is in number, more than half that of  
the British isles. It is composed of a brave,  
a free, a xirtuous and an intelligent peo­  
ple. Our country abounds in the necessa­  
ries, the arts K comforts of the life. A ge­  
neral prosperity is visible in the public  
countenance. The means employed by the  
British cabinet to undermine it, have re­  
coiled on themselves ; have given to our  
national faculties a more rapid develope­  
ment ; and, draining or diverting the pre­  
cious metals from British, circulation and  
British vaults, have poured them into those  
of the United States. ,lt is a propitious  
consideration, that an unavoidable war  
should have found this seasonable facility  
for the contributions required to support it.  
——When the public voice called for war,  
all knexv and still know, that without  
tlu ni it could not he carried on, through  
the period which it might last; and the

spirit of our fellow-citizens, are plfedfces

ed it to silence. Should the war continue, as it  
is certainly at least probable, it will, the next  
campaign w ill be of a very different complexion  
from the last, and those who lose Canada may

Washington, March 4th; 1813.  
At 12 o’clock thjis day, JAA1K8 &gt;1 ARISON,  
the President of the Uuited Stages elect,.having  
attended at the Capitol.for the purpose of tak­  
. .. _— purpose &lt;  
the Oath of Office, delivered to the vast  
concourse of people assembled on the occasion,  
the following  
SPEECH t:  
About to add the solemnity of an oath to flic  
obligations imposed by a second call^to tbe sta­  
tion, in whielimy cnnntry heretofore placed me,  
1 find, in the presence of this respectable as­  
sembiy, an opportunity&#x27;.of pnbliekly repeating my  
profound sense of so distinguished a confidence,  
and of the responsibility united with it. &#x27; The  
impressions on me ore strengthened by such an  
evidence, that my faiihfutemleavors to discharge  
my arduous duties have been favorably estima­  
ted; and by a consideration of the momentous  
period at which the trust has been renewed;  
From the weight and magnitude now belonging  
to it, 1 should be compelled to shrink, if I had  
less relianee on the support of an enlightened  
and generous people, and felt less deeply, a  
conviction, that the w,ar with a powerful nation,  
which forms so prominent a feature in our situa­  
tion, is stamped with that justice, which invites  
the smi,les of heaven on the means of conduct­  
ing it |o a successful termination* ;  
  
iriay .we not cnensn tne sentiment, without  
presumption, when we reflect on the characters  
by which this war is distinguished ?  
It was not declared ou the part of tlie U.States,  
until it had been long made ou them, in reality,  
though not in name; until arguments and expostu­  
lations had been exhausted; until a positive decla­  
ration had been received, that the wrongs provok­  
ing it would not be discontinued ; nor until this  
last appeal could ho longer be delayed, without  
breaking dpwn the spirit of the nation, destroy­  
ing,all confidence in itself a&#x27;nd in its political  
institutions; and either perpetuating a state of  
disgraceful suffering, or regaining, bj wore eost­  
ly sacrifices and more severe struggles, oor lost  
rank aud respect among independent powers.  
, On the issue of the war are staked our nati­  
onal sovereignty on the high seas, and the secu­  
rity of an important class of citizen#, whose  
occupations give the proper value to those of  
e very other class. Not to contend/or such a  
stake, is to surrender onr equality with other  
porters, on tbfe element common to ail; and to  
violate the sacred title, which every member Of  
the society has to its protection. J need not call  
into view the unlawfulness of the practice, by  
which our mariuers are forced, at the will of  
Avery cruizing officer, from their own vessels  
fiito foreign ones, nor paint the outrages insepa­  
rable from it.. The proofs are in fhe records of  
each successive administration of our govern­  
ment; and the erne) sufferings of that portion of  
the Ameriegn people have found their way to  
every, bosom nejt dead to the sympathies of hn  
man nature.  
, As the war wfs just in its origiit^aod&#x27;neees-:  
sary and noble in its objects, we ean reflect with  
a proud satisfaction,&#x27;that, in carrying it on, no  
principle of justice or honor, no usage of civil­  
ized nations, no precept of courtesy nr humanl­  
IngcP  
ty have been infringed? The war has been wa­  
ged on our part, with serupulnns regard \n all,  
these obligations, arid in a spirit or liberality,  
which was never surpassed.

These resources are amply sufficient to bring  
the war to an honorable issue. Our nation is, in  
number, more than half that of the British Isles.  
It is composed of a brave, a free, a virtuous and  
an intelligent people. Onr country&#x27; abounds in

consideration, that an unavoidable war should  
have found this seasonable facility for the eou­  
tributions required to support it. When the pub-,  
lie voice called for war, all knew and still know,  
that without them it could not be carried on,  
through the period which it might last; and the 1,  
patriotism, the good sense, and the manly spirit ,

e senate were waiting—a  
call of the house was had, and it appeared  
that 61 members only were present.  
After receiving from the president all the  
bills which had passed, and being informed  
by the committee chat he had no further  
Commanications to make, the house ad­  
journed sine ilis.  
MR. MADISON s INAUGURAL  
SPEECH.  
  
Washington, March 4th, 1813.  
At 12 o’clock tliis uay, JAM hi 8 MADI­  
SON, the President of ilie U. States elect,  
having attended at the Capitol for the pur­  
pose of taking the oath of oliice, delivered  
to th« vast coneouise of people assembled  
oa the occasion, the following  
SPEECH.  
About to add the solemnity of an oath  
to the obligations imposed by a second call  
to the station in which n».y country hereto­  
fore placed me, 1 find, in the presence of  
this respectable assembly, an opportunity  
of publicly repeating my profound sense of  
so distinguished a commence, and of the  
responsibility united with it. The impres­  
sions on me are strengthened by such an  
evidence, that my faithful endeavorslo dis­  
charge my arduous duties have been favor­  
ably estimated ; and by a consideration of  
the momentous period at which the trust  
has been renewed. From the weight and  
magnitude now belonging to it, I should  
be compelled to shrink, if I had less reli­  
ance on thfc support of an enlightened and  
generous people, and telt less deeply a con­  
viction, that the war with a powerful na­  
tion, which forms so prominent a feature  
in our situation, is stamped with that jus­  
tice which invites the 6iniles of heaveu on  
the means of conducting it to a successful  
termination. ’  
May we not cherish this sentiment with­  
out presumption, when we reflect on the  
characteristics by which this war is distin­  
guished ?  
It was not declared on the part of the U.  
States until it had been long made on them,  
in reality, though notin name; until arga­  
ments and expostulations had been exhaust  
ed; until a positive declaration had been  
received, that the wrongs provoking it  
would not be discontinued; nor until this  
last appeal coukl no longer lie delayed,  
without breaking down the spirit of the  
nation, destroying all confidence in itself  
and in its political institutions; and either  
perpetuating a state of disgraceful suffer­  
ing, or regaining, by more costly sacrifices  
alid more severe struggles, our lost rank  
and respect among independent powers.  
On the issue of the War are staked our  
national sovereignty on the high seas and  
the security of an important class of citi­  
zens, whose occupations give the proper  
value to those of every other cl s. Not to  
contend for such a stake, is to surrender  
our equality with other powers, on the ele  
incut common to all: and to violate the  
sacred title, which every n ember of the  
  
•ociety has to it* protection. I need not  
cali into view the unlawfulness of the prac­  
tice, by which our mariners are forced, at  
the will of a cruizing officer, from their  
own vessels into foreign ones, nor paint the  
outrages inseparable from it. The proofs  
are in the records of each successive admi­  
nistration of our government; and the cruel  
sufferings of that portion of the American  
people nave found their way to every bosom  
not dead to the sympathies of human na­  
ture.  
As the war was just in its origin, and  
noble in its objects, we can reflect with a  
proud satisfaction, that in carry lug it on,  
no principle cf justice or honor, no usages  
of civilized nations, no precept of courtesy  
or humanity have been infringed. The war  
has been waged on our part, with scrupu­  
lous regard to all these obligations, and in  
a spirit of liberality whiqji was never sur­  
passed.  
How little has been the effect of this ex­  
am pie on the conduct of the enemy?  
They have retained as prisoners of war  
citizens of the U. States, not liable to be  
so considered under the usages of war.  
They have refused to consider as prison  
ers of war, and threatened to punish as  
traitors and deserters, persons emigrating  
without restraint to the U. States, incor­  
porated by naturalization into our political  
family, and lighting under the authority of  
their adopted country, in open and honor­  
able war, for the maintenance of its right*  
and safety. Such is the avowed purpose  
of a government, which i* in the practice  
of natufalizing, by thousands, citizens of  
other countries, and not only of permitting,  
but compelling them to tight in battles a­  
gainst their native country.  
They have not, it i* true, taken into their  
own hands the hatchet and the knife, de­  
voted to indiscriminate massacre ; but they  
have let loose the savages armed with these  
cruel instruments; have allured them into  
their service, and carried them to battle  
by their sides, eager to glut their savage  
thirst with the blood «f the vanquished,  
and to finish the work of torture and death  
on maimed and defenceless captives. And  
what was never before seen, British com­  
manders have extorted victory over the un­  
conquerable valor of our troops, by pre­  
senting to their sympathy their chief a­  
waiting massacre from their savage asso­  
  
I cmu*s,  
j And now we find them, in further con­  
i tempt of the modes of honorable warfare,  
supplying the place of a conquering force,  
by attempt# to disorganize our political so­  
ciety, to dismember our confederated Re­  
public. Happily, like others, these will  
recoil on the authors ; but they mark the  
| degenerate council# from which they ema­  
nate ; and if they did net belong to a series  
of unexampled inconsistencies, might ex­  
cite the greater wonder, as proceeding from  
a government which founded the very war  
in which it lias been so long engaged, on a  
charge against the disorganizing and insur­  
rectional policy of its adversary.  
To render the justice of the war on our  
part the more conspicuous, the reluctance  
to commence it was followed by the earliest  
and strongest manifestations of a disposi­  
tion to arrest its progress. The sword was  
scarcely out of the scabbard, before the  
enemy was apprized of the reasonable  
terms on which it would be re-sheathed.  
Still more precise advances were repeated,  
and have been received in a spirit forbid­  
ding every reliance, not placed on the mi­  
litary resources of the nation.  
These resources are amply sufficient to  
bring the war to an honorable issue. Our  
nation is, in number, more than half that  
of the British isles. It is composed of a  
brave, a free, a virtuous and an intelligent  
people. Our country abounds in the ne­  
cessaries, the arts and the comforts of life.  
A general prosperity is visible in the public  
countenance. The means employed by the  
British cabinet to undermine it, have re­  
coiled on themselves; have given to odr  
national faculties a more rapid develope*  
ment; and, draining or diverting the pre­  
cious metal# from British circulation and  
British vaults, have poured them into those  
of the U. State#. It is a propitious con#i­  
deratian, that an unavoidable war should  
have found this seasonable facility for the  
contributions required to support it. When  
;he public voice called for war, all knew  
and still know, that without them it could  
not be carried on, through the period which  
it might last ; and the patriotism, the good  
sense, and the manly spirit of our fellow  
citizens, are pledges for the cheerfulness  
with which they will bear each his share  
of the common burden. To rendev the  
war short, and its success sure, animated  
and systematic exertions alone are neces­  
sary ; and the success of our arms now  
may long preserve our country from the  
necessity of another resort to them Al­  
ready have the gallant exploits of our na­  
val heroes proved to the world our . inhe­  
rent capacity to maintain our rights, on one  
element. If the reputation of our arms  
ha# been thrown under clouds on the other,  
presaging flashes of heroio enterprize as­  
sure us that nothing is wanting to corres­  
pondent triumphs there also, but the dis­  
cipline and habits which are in daily pro

About to add the solemnity of an oath  
®the obligations imposed by a second  
call to the station, in which my country  
heretofore placed me, I find, in the pre-  
sence of this sane Fre assembly, an op-  
peeniy of publicly repeating my pro-  
  
id sense of so distinguisbed a confi-  
dence, and of the responsibility united  
with it. ‘The impressions on me are  
strengthened by such an evidence, that  
my faithful endeavors to discharge m

distinguished ?  
It was not declared, on the part of the  
United States, until it had n long  
  
made on them, in reality, though not in  
name ; until arguments, and expostula-  
tions had been exhausted ; until a i-  
tive declaration had been received, that  
the wrongs provoking it would not be  
discontinued ; nor until this appeal could  
no longer be delayed, without breaking  
down the spirit of the nation, destroying  
all confidence in itself and its political in-  
stitutions ; and either perpetuating a state  
of disgracefal suffering, or regaining, by  
more costly sacrifices and more severe  
struggles, our lost rank and respect a-

On the issue of the war are staked our  
national sovereignty on the high seas,  
and the security of an important class of  
citizens, whose occupations give the pro-  
  
*r value to these of every other class,—  
  
ot to contend for such a stake, is to sur-  
render oar. equality with other powers,  
on the element common to all; and to  
violate the sacred title, which every  
member of the society has to its protec-  
tion.  
  
I need not call into view the unlaw-

How little has been the effect of this

They have retained as prisoners of  
war citizens of the United States not lia-

of war.  
Tney have refused to consider as_pri-  
soners of war, and threaten to punish as

porated by naturalization into our politi-  
cal family, and fighting under the autho-

honorable war, for the maintainance of its

purpose ofa yovernment, which is in the  
practice of naturalizing, by thousands  
citizens of other countries, &amp; not vag of  
rmitting, but compelling them to fight  
its battles against their native country.  
They have not, it is trae, taken into  
their own hands the hatchet and the  
knife, devoted to indiscriminate mas-  
sacre ; but they have let loose the sava-  
s armed with these cruel instruments ;  
ave allured them into their service, and.  
carried them to battle by their sides,  
eager to glut their savage thirst with the  
blood of the vanquished, and to finish  
the work of torture and death on maim-

‘not belong to a series of unexampled in  
consistencies, might excite the greater  
wonder, as proceeding from a govern-  
ment which founded the very war in  
which ‘it has been so long engaged  
inst the disorganizing and insurrec-  
tional policy of its adversary. be  
To render the justice of the war on  
our part the more conspicuous, the reluc  
tance to commence it was followed by  
the earliest and strongest manifestations  
of a disposition to arrest its progress,—  
The sword was scarcely out of its scab-  
bard, before the enemy was apprised of  
the reasonable terms on which it would  
be re-sheathed. Still more precise ad-  
vances were repeated, and have been re-  
ceived in a spirit forbidding every re-  
lianee, not placed on the military re-  
sources of the nation.  
  
These resources are amply sufficient  
to bring the war to an honorable issue.  
Our nation is, in number, more than  
half that of the British isles. It is com-  
  
sed of a brave, a free,a virtuous and  
intelligent people. Our country abounds  
in the necessaries, the arts and the com-  
forts of life. A general prosperity is vi  
sible in the public countenance. ‘The  
means employed by the British cabinet  
  
selves ; have given to our national facul-  
ties a more rapid development ; and,  
draining or diverting the precious metals  
from British circulation and British  
vaults, have poured them into those of  
the U. States. Itis a propitious consi-  
deration, that an unavoidable war should  
have found this seasonable facility for  
the contributions necessary to support it.  
When the public voice called for war, all  
knew and still know, that without them  
it couid not be carried on, through the  
  
riod which it might last ; and the pa-  
  
iotism, the good sense and the manly  
spirit of our fellow-citizens, are pledges  
for the cheerfulness with which they  
will bear each his share of the common  
burden. ,  
  
To render the war short and its sac-  
cess sure, animated and systematic ex-  
ertions alone are necessary ; and the  
success of our arms may long preserve  
eur country from the necessity of ano-  
ther resort tothem. Already have the  
gallant exploits of our naval heroes prov-  
ed to the world our inhererent capacity  
to maintain our rights, on one element.  
If the reputation of our arms has been  
thrown under clouds on the other, pre.  
saging flashes of heroic enterprize as-  
sure us that nothing is wanting to cor-  
respondent triumphs there also, but the

tration of our government ; and the cruel  
fuff-rings of that portion of the American  
people have found their way ‘o every bof  
om not dead to the {fympathies of human  
nature. 5 \ :  
As the war was jult in its origin and ne­  
cefl4ry and noble in its o%j«&amp;@s, we can re­

recoil on the authors : bat they ‘mark the.-  
degenerate councils from which they ema -

To render the justice of the war on our­  
part the more confpicunus, the reluctance  
to commence it was followed hy the ear­  
liek and frongeß manifeftations of a dis­

Still more precise advances were repeated,  
and have been re-cived in a spirit forbid:  
ding every reliance not piaced on the mil:

These reflources are amply fufficient to  
bring the war to an honorable iffaec. Our  
nation is, in number, more than hai!f that  
of the Britith isles. It is composed of a  
brave, afree, a virtuous, and an intelligent  
people. Our conatry abounds in the ne­  
cefliries, the arts, and the comfoits of life.  
A general prosperity is visible in the pub.  
lic countenance. &#x27;The me.ns employed by  
the Britith ¢abinét to underm’ne it, have, .  
recoiled on themselves ; have given to our  
national faculties a more rapid develope­  
ment ; and, draining or divérting the pre:  
cious metals from Britith circulatlon and  
Britilh vaults, have poured them into  
those of the United States. It isa propi­  
tious consideration, that an unavoidable  
war should have found this seasonable fa­  
cility for the con:fibutions fequired to sup­  
port it. When the public voice called

and the patriotism, the good sense, and the

the success of our arms may now long pie­  
ferve our country from the neceflity of a­

rest its progress. &#x27;I he sword -was scarce 1 y out  
of tlu scabbard before the enemy was appriz-  
ed of the reasonable terms on which it would  
more precise advances  
ave been received in a spi  
nt forbidding every reliance, not placed on  
t ie military resources of the nation.  
  
These resources are amply sufficient to bring  
the war to an honorable issue. Our nation is  
in number more than half that of the British  
isles. It is composed of a brave, a free, a vir  
tuous and an intelligent people. Our country  
abounds in the necessaries, the arts and tiie  
comforts of l ife. A general prosperity is vis i.  
ble in the public countenance. The means en  
ployed by the British cabinet to undermine it,  
have recoiled on thi mselves ; have given to our  
national faculties a more rapid developement  
and, draining or diverting t he precious metals  
from British circulat ion &amp; British vaults, have  
poured them into those of the United States  
It is a propit ous consideration that an unavo d  
able war should have found this seasonable f.  
cility for the contributions required to support  
it When the public voice called for war, all  
knew and strll know, that without them i  
could not be carried on, through the period  
which it might last ; and the patriotism, tl c  
good sense, and the manly spirit of our fellow  
citizens, are pledges for the cheerfulness witl  
which they will each bear his share of the com  
mon burden. To render the war sl ort and its  
success sure, animated and systematic exer-  
tions alone are necessary ; and the success of  
nur amis now may long preserve our country  
from the necessity of another resort to them  
Uready have the gallant exploits of our naval  
heroes proved to the world our inherent capa  
city to maintain our rights on one clement. If  
the reputation of our arms has been thrown un-  
der clouds on the other, presaging flashes r  
heroic enterprize assure us that nothing is  
w anting to correspondent triumphs there also,

an important class of citizens, whose occu-

a stake, is to surrender our equality with  
other Powers on the element common to all,

AMERICAN STATES.  
(Continued from page 704./  
  
rying it on, no principle of justice or ho-  
nour, no usage af civilized nations, no pre-  
cept of courtesy or humanity have been in-  
fringed. The war has been waged on our  
part, with scrupulous regard to all these  
obligations, and in a spirit of liberality  
which was never surpassed, How little  
has been the effect of this example on the  
conduct of the enemy. They have retained  
as prisoners of war citizens of the United  
States, not liable to be so considered under  
the usages of war. They have relused to  
consider as prisoners of war, and threaten-  
ed to punish as traitors and deserters, . per-  
sous emigrating without restraint to the  
United States ; incorporated by naturaliza-  
tion into our political family, and fighting  
under the authority of their adopted coun-  
try, in open and honourable war, for the  
maintenance of its rights and safety. Such  
is the avowed purpose of a government,  
which is in the practice of naturalizing, by  
thousands, citizens of other countries, and  
not only of permitting, but compelling them  
to fight its battles against their native coun-  
try. They have not, it is true, taken  
into their own hands the hatchet and the  
kuife, devoted to indiscriminate massacre ;  
but they have let loose the savages armed  
with these cruel instruments; have allured  
them into their service, and carried them to  
battle by their sides, eager to glut their  
savage thirst with the blood of the van-  
quished, and to finish the work of torture  
and death on maimed and defenceless cap-  
tives, And, what was never before seen,  
British Commanders. have extorted victory  
over the uncanquerable valour of our troops,  
  
y presenting to the sympathy of their chief  
awaiting massacre from their savage associ-  
ates. And now we find thei in further  
contempt of the modes of honourable war-  
fare supplying the place of a conquering  
force, by attempts to disorganize our poli-  
tical society, to dismember our confederat-  
ed Republic. Happily, like others, those  
will recoil on the authors: but they mark  
the degenerate councils from which they  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
emanate: and if they did net belong to a  
  
excite the greater wonder, as proceeding  
from a Government which founded the very  
war in which it has been so long engaged,  
on a charge against the disorganizing and  
insurrectional policy of its adversary.  
| To render the justice of the war on our  
part the more conspicuous, the reluctance  
to commence it was followed by the earliest  
and strongest manifestations of a disposition  
to arrest its progress. The sword was  
scarcely out of the scabbard before the  
enemy was apprized of the reasonable terms  
on which it would be re-sheathed. Still  
more precise advances were repeated,  
and have been received in a spirit for-  
bidding every reliance not placed in the  
military resources of the nation. ——  
These resources are amply sufficient to  
bring the war to an honourable issue.. Our  
nation is, in number, more than half that  
of the British Isles. It is composed of a  
brave, a free, a virtuous, and an intelligent  
people. Our country abounds in the ne-  
cessaries, the arts, and comforts of life. A  
general prosperity is visible in the public  
countenance. The means employed by the  
British Cabinet to undermine it, have re-  
coiled on themselves; have given to our  
national faculties a more rapid develope-  
ment; and, draining or diverting the pre-  
cious metals from British circulation and  
British vaults, have poured them into those  
of the United States. It is a propitious  
consideration, that an unavoidable war  
should have found this seasonable facility  
for the contributions required to support it.  
When the public yoice called for war, all  
knew, and still know, that without them it  
could not be carried on through the period  
which it might last; and the patriotism,  
the good sense, and the manly spirit of our  
fellow-citizens, are pledges for the cheer-  
fulness with which they will bear each his  
share of the common burden. To render  
the war short, and its success sure, ani-  
mated and systematic exertions alone are  
necessary; and the success of our arms  
now, may long preserve our country from  
the necessity of another resort to them.  
Already have the gallant exploits of our  
naval heroes proved to the world our inhe-  
rent capacity to maintain our rights on one  
element. If the reputation of our ar:  
has been thrown under clouds on the other,  
presaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure  
us, that nothing is wanting to correspon-  
dent triumphs there also, but the discipline  
and habits which are in daily progress,
