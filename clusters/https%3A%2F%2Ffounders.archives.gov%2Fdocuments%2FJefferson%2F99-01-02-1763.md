Dear Sir   
  
Washington May 21. 1805.  
  
An accumulation of business which I found on my return here from a short visit to Monticello, has prevented till now acknolegement of your favor of the 14th. Ult. this delay has given time to see the result of the contest in your state, and I cannot but congratulate you on the advance it manifests, &amp; the certain prospect it offers that another year restores Massachusets to the general body of the nation. you have indeed recieved the federal unction of lying &amp; slandering. but who has not? who will ever again come into eminent office unanointed with this chrism? it seems to be fixed that falsehood &amp; calumny are to be the ordinary engines of opposition: engines which will not be entirely without effect. the circle of characters equal to the first stations is not too large, &amp; will be lessened by the voluntary retreat of those whose sensibilities are stronger than their confidence in the justice of public opinion. I certainly have known, &amp; still know, characters eminently qualified for the most exalted trusts, who could not bear up against the brutal beatings &amp; hewings of these heroes of Billingsgate. I may say, from intimate knolege, that we should have lost the services of the greatest character of our country had he been assailed with the degree of abandoned licentiousness now practised. the torture he felt under rare &amp; slight attacks proved that under those of which the federal bands have shewn themselves capable he would have thrown up the helm in a burst of indignation.   yet this effect of sensibility must not be yielded to. if we suffer ourselves to be frightened from our post by mere lying, surely the enemy will use that weapon: for what one so cheap to those of whose system of politics morality makes no part? the patriot, like the Christian, must learn that to bear revilings &amp; persecutions is a part of his duty: and in proportion as the trial is severe, firmness under it becomes more requisite &amp; praiseworthy. it requires indeed self-command. but that will be fortified in proportion as the calls for it’s exercise are repeated. in this I am persuaded we shall have the benefit of your good example. to the other falsehoods they have brought forward should they add, as you expect, insinuations of any want of confidence in you from the administration generally, or myself particularly, it will, like their other falsehoods, produce in the public mind a contrary inference.

fect of sensibility mst not be yielded to. If we  
suffer ourselves to be frightened fr-m our- posts by  
mere lying, .urely the enemy will ue that weap­  
on; for what one so cheap to those of whose sy s­  
tem of politics morality makes no part! The  
patriot, like the Christian, must learn to bear re­  
viling and persecutions as a part of his duty, and  
in proportion as the trial is severe, firmness un­  
der it becomes more requisite and praiseworthy.  
It requires, indeed, self command. But that will  
bn fortified in proportion as the ca lis for its exer­  
cise are repeated.

scribblers, who, for the moat part, neither know nor care  
whether what they write U true or false. When such a  
state of things presents itself, the question will bo forced on  
the people of the United State* whether the blessing* of  
freedom of speech and of the preas art not more than  
counterbalanced by the evils attending their abuse. Even  
Mr. Jefferson, himself one of the most zealous advocates of  
the freedom of speech and writing, and one of the most illus­  
trious of its victims, thus expresses himself In a letter to  
Judge Sullivan, dated May Si, 1803. Speaking of the op­  
pofitioti he says :  
It seems to be fixed that falsehood and calumny are to  
be their ordinary engines of opposition?engines that will  
not be entirely without effect. The circle of characters  
equal to the first sUtioas is not loo large, and will tie feg­  
sened by the voluntary retreat or thfcse whose sensibilities  
are stronger thah tlleir confidence in the justice of pbblic  
opinion I certainly have known characters eminently  
qualified for the most exalted truats who could not bear up  
againat the brutal hacking* and haw ing* of those heroes  
of billingsgate. I may say, from intimate knowledge, that  
we should have lost the services of the greatest character  
of the country, bad he been assailed with the degree of  
abandoned licentiousness now practised. The torture he  
felt, under rare and alight attacks, proved that under  
those ot which the federal bands have shown themselves  
capable, he would have thrown up the helm iff a burst or  
indignation.&quot; There can he no doubt the country has  
thus loat, and will lose, the services or many or her tnost  
eminent citizens, whose ambition for honorable distinction  
in public life will bo effectually repressed by the appre­  
hension of having their characters defamed, and their most  
sensitive feelings lacerated by the unprincipled calumnies  
and licentious ribaldry of a press, restrained by no law, no  
conscience, no regard to truth, and no deference to public  
decency.  
Mr. Jefferson, in the fame letter, proceeds to say : &quot;The  
patriot, like the Christian, must learn to bear railings and  
persecutions as part or his duty, and, in proportion at the  
| trial is severe, firmness under it becomes more requisite  
and praiseworthy. It requires. Indeed, self-command;  
j but that will be fortified in proportion as the calls for its  
exerci*e are repeated.&quot; All thi* may be true; but I doubt  
that any man erer becomes insensible to Calumny an
