sen the obligations of Spain. Individuals may have made their applications to the French Government. But it will not be pretended that the merits of the question can be affected by that circumstance.  
The plea on which it seems that the Spanish Government now principally relies, is the erasure of the 2d Art. from our late Convention with France, by which France was released from the indemnities due for spoliations committed under her immediate responsibility to the United States. This plea did not appear in the early objections of Spain to our claims. It was an after thought resulting from the insufficiency of every other plea, and is certainly as little valid as any other. The injuries for which indemnities are claimed from Spain, tho’ committed by Frenchmen, took place under Spanish authority. Spain therefore is answerable for them. To her we have looked and continue to look for redress. If the injuries done to us by her resulted in any manner from injuries done to her by France, she may if she pleases resort to France as we resort to her. But whether her resort to France would be just or unjust is a question between her and France; not between either her and us, or us and Franc⟨e.⟩ We claim against her not against France. In releasing France therefore we have not released her. The claims, again, from which France was released were admitted by France and the release was for a valuable consideration in a correspondent release of the United States from certain claims on them. The claims we make on Spain were never admitted by France nor made on France by the United States; they made therefore no part of the bargain with her, and could not be included in the release. The only supposition on which Spain could turn us over to France, would be that of her being in a state of absolute duress, of her being merely the staff by which the blow was given by France. But even on t

into their merits at every step they would make toward the public treasury  
and their historic character made them sufficiently familiar to every man of  
even moderate information to invite further and a searching examination of  
the ground upon which they rested. Eminent American statesmen of the time  
have not been silent upon a topic of so much importance. Mr. Madison, then

That this was the interpretation and effect of the convention and  
the suppression of the 2d article, and the proviso inserted in behalf of  
France, is abundantly testified by the leading statesmen of that time and  
thereafter.  
  
In a letter of instructions from Mr. Madison (then Secretary of State,  
under President Jefferson) to Mr. Pinckney, our Minister to Spain, of  
February 6, 1804, the secretary states:  
  
“The claims from which France was released were admitted by France, and the  
release was fora valuable consideration in a correspondent release of the United States  
from certain claims on them.”  
  
In a letter from Timothy Pickering, who was Secretary of State  
between the years 1795 and 1800, to the late James H. Cansten, he writes:  
“Thus the Government of the U. States dartered the just claims of our merchants  
on France to obtain a relinquishment of the French claim for a restoration of the old  
  
treaties, especially the burdensome treaty of alliance by which we were bound to guaranty  
the French Territories in America.”  
  
The ex-Emperor Napoleon, among his statements at St. Helena, said:

“The claims from which France were released were admit-  
ted by France, and the release was for a valuable considera-  
tion, in a correspondent release of the United States from  
certain claims on them.”  
  
Mr. Pickering wrote, November 19th, 1824:  
  
“Then it seems clear that as our government applied the  
  
merchants’ property to buy off those old treaties, the sums so

plenipotentiaries, as we have seen, and with the very best of  
opportunities for judging of this matter, said he was satisfied

strongest obligation to compensate the sufferers by the Frenc

when Spain endeavored to resist the  
payment of claims against her, on the  
ground that there were French acts for  
which the United States had renounced  
indemnity, Mr. Madison wrote to Mr.  
Pinckney thus: “The claims, again,  
from which France was released were  
admitted by France, and the release was  
for a valuable consideration in a corre-  
spondent release of the United States

were pressed only after the testimony  
of those who knew the circumstance
