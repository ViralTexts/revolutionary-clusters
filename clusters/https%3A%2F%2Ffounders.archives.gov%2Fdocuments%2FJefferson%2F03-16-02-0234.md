JU0.NTICFL1.0, Sept.20, 1821.—I thank you  
Sn, lor tile copy ot your Republican, which  
jou have been so kind as to send me, and 1  
should have acknowledged it sooner, but that  
! just returned home after a I&#x27;Mig absence.  
I hat e not yet had time to read it seriously,  
but in looking over it cursorily, I see much in  
it to approve : and shall be glad if it shall lead  
our youth to the pi active of thinking on such  
subjects and for tliemsi Ives. That it will have  
this tendency may be expected, and for that  
reason I feel an urgency to note what I deem  
an error in it, the more requiring notice, as  
your opinion is strengthened by that of many  
others. It on seem, in pages *81 and 118, to  
consider the Judges as tile ultimate arbiters of  
all constitutional questions ; a very dangerous  
doctrine indeed, and one which would”place  
us under the despotism of an Oligarchy. Our  
Judges are as honest as other men, and not  
more so. They have, with others, tin-same  
passions for parly, for power, and the privile­  
ges, if their corps. Their maxim is, «• hnui  
judicis est amplicarejurisdiclionem,” and their  
power the more dangerous, as they are in of­  
fice for life, and not responsible, ns the other  
functionaries are, to the elective centroid.—  
.The constitution has erected no such single  
tribunal ; knowing that, to whatever hands  
confided, with the corruptions of time and pa -  
ty,its members would become despots. It has  
more wisely made all the departments co­  
i-quid and co-sovereign within themselves. If  
the Legislature fails to pass Ians for a census,  
for paying the Judges and other officers of go­  
vernment, for establishing a militia, for natu­  
ralization as prescribed by the constitution, or  
iftlicy fail to meet in Congress,the Judges can­  
not issue their mandates to them. Ifthe Presi­  
dent fails to supply the place of a Judge, to ap­  
point other civil or military officers, to issue re­  
quisite commissions, the Judges cannot force  
him. They ran issue their mandamus or distrin­  
gas to noexecutive or legislative officer toenforce  
tno fulfilment of their official duties, any more  
than the President or Legislature may issue  
orders to the Judges or their officers. Betray­  
ed by’ Lnglisli example, and unaware, as it  
iglirxill.l ennm . . ..1 C . •.

in this particular, they have at times o­  
\ erstepped tlieir limit by undertaking to com­  
maiid executive officers in the discharge ol  
tlieir executive duties. Rut the constitution,  
in keeping the three departments distinct and  
independent, restrains the authority of the  
judges to judiciary organs, as it does the exec­  
utive and legislative, to executive and legisla­  
tive organs. The judges certainly have more  
frequent occasion to act on constitutional  
questions, because the iawsofmeum and tumn,  
and of criminal action forming the great mass  
of the system of law, constitute their particu­  
lar department.  
\\ lien the legislative or executive functiona­  
ries net unconsfitutionally, they arc responsi­  
ble to the people in their elective capacity.—  
&#x27;Pile exemption of the Judges from that is  
quite dangerous enough. I know no safe de­  
pository of the ultimate powers of the society,  
but the people, themselves : and if we think  
them not enlightened enough to exercise their  
controul with a wholesome discretion, the re­  
medy is, not to take it from them, but to in­  
form their discretion by education. This is  
the true corrective of abuses of constitution­  
al power. Pardon me, sir, for this difference  
of opinion. My personal interest in such  
questions is entirely extinct—but not m vVislies  
for the longest possible continuance of our go­  
vernment on its pure principles. If the three  
powers maintain their mutual independence  
on each other,it may last long: but not so il  
either can assume the authorities of the other,  
I ask your candid re-consideration of this sub­  
ject, ami am sufficiently sure you will form a  
candid conclusion.  
Accept the assurance of my great respect,

JIONTICELLO, SEPT. 20, 182 L,  
Y thank you, sir, for the copy of your Repubk­  
can, which you have been so kind asto send me;  
and I shouid have acknowledged it sooner, but  
that I am just returned home after along absence.  
[ have not yet had time to read it seriously, but,  
in looking over is cursorily, I see much in it to  
approve, and shall be glad if it shall lead our  
youth to the practice of thinking on such sub-  
Jects, and for themselves. That it will have this  
tendency may be expected,and for that reason  
I feel an urgency te note what [ deem an error  
in it, the more requiring notice as your opinion  
is strengthenod by that of many others. You  
seem, in pages 84 and 148, to consider the judges  
as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional  
quastions ; a very dangerous doctrine in­  
deed, and one which would - place us under the  
despotisin of an oligarehy. Our judges are as  
honest as other men, and not more so. They  
have, with others. the same passions for party,  
for power, and the privileges of their corps.  
Their maxim is, “bont judicis est amplicare ju­  
risdictionem,’’ and their power the more danger­  
ous, as they are in office for life, and not respon­  
sible, as the other functionaries are, tv the elec­  
trive control. The censtitution has erected no  
such single tribunal; knowing that to whatever  
hands confided, with the corruptions of time and  
party, its members would become despots. It  
has more wisely made all the departments co­  
equal and co-sovereign within themselves. If the  
legislature fails to pass laws for a census, for  
paying the judges and other officers of goveru­  
ment, for establishing a militia, for naturaliza­  
tiom, as preseribed by the constitution ; or if they  
fail to meet in congress, the judges cunnet issue  
their mandates tothem.  
If the president fails to supply the place of a  
judge, to appoint other civil or military officers,  
to issue requisite coinmissions, the judges cannot  
force him. They can issue their mandauus or  
distringas to no executive or legislative officer to  
enforce the fulfi/iment of their official duties,  
any more than the president or legislature inay  
issue orders to the judges or their officers. Be­  
trayed by English exumple, and unaware, as it  
should seem, of the control of our constitution,  
in this particular, they have at timgs overstep­  
ped their limit, by undertaking to command exs  
ecutive officers in the discharge of their execn­  
tive daties. But the constitution, in keepiag the  
three departments distinct and independent, re­  
atrains the authority of the judgesto judiciary  
organs, as itdoes the executive and legislative,  
to exccutive and legislative organs. The judy­  
es certanly have more frequent occasion to act  
on constilutional gGuestions, hecause the laws  
meum and tuum, and of criminal action, form­  
ing ths great mass of the system of law, con­  
stitute theer particular depariuiens.  
Whan the legislative or exccative functiona­  
ries act unconstitutionally, thoy are responsible  
to the people im their elective capacity. The  
examption of the judges irom that 15 guite dan­  
gerous enough. [/hnow no safe depository of  
the wltimate powers of the society, but the people  
themscives : and if we think them not entightened  
enough to cxereise their conirol with a wholesome  
discretion, the remedy is, mot to tuke it from ticm,  
but to inform their DISCRETION BY EDUCATION.  
This is the true corrective of the abuses of con­  
etitutional power. Pardon me, sir, for this dif­  
ference of opinion. My personal interest in such  
queations is entirely extinct—but not my wislies  
for the longest possible continuance of our gov­  
ernment on its pure principles. If the thres pow­  
ers myintain their mutual independence on each  
other, it may last long: but not so if either can  
assume the authorities of the other. 1 ask yoar  
candid recoasideration of this subject, and am  
sufficiently sure you will forn a candid conclu­  
sion.

apology at any time, for quoting Mr. Jeflersom 3  
those who do not like his doctrines need not read  
our paper. e says:  
  
“ You seem, in pages 84 and 142, to consider  
the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constita­  
tional questions ; 2 very dangerous doctrine indeed,  
and one which would place us under the despotism  
of an ohgarchy. Our judges are as honest as other  
men, and not more so. ‘They have, with others,  
the same passions for party, for power, and the  
privileges of their corps. ‘F&#x27;heir waxim is, ¢ boni  
judicis est amplicare jurisdiction em,’” and their  
power the more dangerous, as they are in office for  
life, and not Iresponsible, as the other functionaries  
are, to the elective control. The constitution has  
erccted no such single tribunal 5 knowing that, to  
whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of  
timie and party, its members would become despots,  
Jt has more wisely made all the departments co­  
equal and co-sovereizn within themselves. If the  
legislatore fuils to pass laws for o census, for pay­  
‘\ ing the judges and other officers of government, for  
establishing a militia, for natoralization, as pre­  
! scribed by the canstitution ; or if they fuil to meet  
in congress, the judges cannot issue their mandates  
l to them.  
  
I_ If the president fails to supply the place of a  
judge, to appeint other civil or military officers, to  
issue requisite commussions, the judges cannot (oilce  
him. They can issve their mandamus or distiingas  
to no executive or legislative oflicer to enforce the  
fulfilment of their official duties, any more than the  
president ot legislature may issve orders to the  
Judges or their officers. Betrayed by English ex­  
ampe, and unaware, as it should seem, of the coti­  
trol of our constitution, in this particular, they have  
at tines overstepped their limit, by undertaking 1o  
command executive officers in the aischarge of their  
executive daties. Bat the constitution, in keeping  
the three departments distinct and independent, re­  
strains the authority of the judges to judiciary  
organs, as it does the executive and legislative, to  
executive and legislative organs. The judzes cer­  
taiily have more frequent occasion to acl on consti­  
tutionul queslions, because the laws meum and  
tnum, and of erimmal action, forming the greas  
mass of the system of law, constitute their partic­  
ular departiment. .  
When the legislative or exeeutive functionaries  
act unconstitutionally, they are responsible to the  
people in their elective capacity. The exemyption  
of the judges from that is quite dangerous eneugh.  
I know no sefe depository of the ultimate powers of  
the society, but the people themselves ; and if we  
think them not enlightened enough to exercise their  
control wilh ¢ wholesome discrelion, the remely is,  
not 1o take it from them, but to iaform their pis-  
CRETION BY EDUCATION. This is the true  
corrective of the abuses of constitutionol power.”’  
We intend, in our next, to publish or give some  
extracts from the opinion of the Attorney General,  
who fully suostains Mr. Kendall in the position ho  
has taken. We do not predict what may be the P.  
M. General’s success 1n his appeal to the Supreme  
Cows; the whole corps of judges are in fuct a party  
in the cause, and it is somewhat questionabl

You seem, in pages 34 and 18, to consider

despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as

The Constitution has created no such single  
tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands con  
fided, with the corruptions of time and party.  
its members would become despots. It has  
more wisely made all the departmncnts co-oqual  
and co-sovereign within themselver.  If the le  
gislature fails to pass laws for a census, for nave  
ing the judges and the other officers of govern  
ment, for establishing a militia, for naturalina  
tion as prescribed by the Constitution, or if they  
fail to meet in Congress, the judges cannot  
tssue their mandamus to them. it the President  
fails to supply the place of a judge, to appointl  
other civil or military afficers, to istue requisite  
commissions, the judges cannot force him.  
They can issue their mandamus or distringas to  
no executive or legislative officer to enforce the  
fulfilment of their official duties any more than­  
the President or legislature may issue orders th  
the iudges or their offisers. Betrayed by Eng­  
lish evample, and umaware, as it should seem  
of the control of our Constitution in this pars  
tienlar, they have at times overstenped their  
limit by unclertaking to command executive  
officers in the discharge of their executive due­  
ties; but the Constitution in keoping three da  
pariments distinct and independent restrains  
the authority of judges to judictary organs, ak  
it does the executive and legislative to executivel  
anth legislative orrans. The judges crtsinlel  
have more frequent occasion to actron constitos  
tional questions, because the laws of setim and  
teum and of criminal action, forming the great  
mass of system of law, constitute their particue­

ot all constitutional questions ; a very danger-  
ous doctrine indeed, and one which would  
— us under the despotism of an oligarchy.  
  
ur judges are as honest as other men, and  
not more so. They have, with others, the  
same passions for party, for power, and the  
privilege of their corps. Their maxim is,  
*‘boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem,”  
and their power the more dangerous as they  
are in office for life, and not responsible, as  
the other functionaries are, to the elective con-  
trol. The constitution has erected no such  
single tribunal, knowing that to whatever  
hands confided, with the corruptions of time  
and party, its members would become despots.  
It has more wisely made all the departments  
coéqual and cosovereign within themselves.  
If the legislature fails to pass laws for a cen-  
sus, for paying the judges and other officers  
of government, for establishing a militia, for  
naturalization as prescribed by the consti-  
tution, or if they fail to meet in congress, the  
judges cannot issue their mandamus to them,  
if the president fails to supply the place of a  
judge, to appoint civil or military officers, to  
issue requisite commissions, the judges cannot  
force him. They can issue their mandamus  
or distringas to no executive or legislative of-  
ficer, to enforce the fulfillment of their official  
duties, any more than the president or legis-  
lature may issue orders to the judges, or their  
officers. Betrayed by English example, and  
unaware, as it should seem, of the control of  
our constitution in this particular, they have  
at times overstepped their limit, by undertak-  
ing to command executive officers in the dis-  
charge of their executive duties; but the  
constitution, in keeping three departments  
distinct and independent, restrains the author-  
ity of the judges to judiciary organs, as it  
does the executive and legislative to execu-  
tive and legislative organs. The judges cer-  
tainly have more frequent occasion to act  
on constitutional questions ; because the laws  
of meum and tuum, and of criminal action,  
forming the great mass of the system of law,  
constitute their particular department.—  
When the legislative or executive functiona-  
ries act unconstitutionally, they are respensi-  
ble to the people in their elective capacity.  
The exemption of the judges from that is  
“quite dangerovs enough. I know no safe de-  
pository of the ultimate powers of the socie-  
ty, but the people themselves; and if we  
think them not enlightened enough to exercise  
their control with a wholesome discretion, the  
remedy is not to take it from them, but to in-  
form their discretion by education. This is  
the true corrective of abuses of constitutional  
power.  
  
“ Pardon me, sir, for this difference of opin-  
ion ; my personal interest in such questions is  
entirely extinct, but not my wishes for the  
longest possible continuance of our govern-  
ment on its pure principles. If the three pow-  
ers maintain their mutual independence on  
each other, it may last long, but not so if  
either can assume the authorities of the other.  
I ask your candid reconsideration of this  
subject, und am sufficiently sure you will  
forin acandid conclusion. Accept the assur-  
ance of my great respect.”

the decision of the Supreme Court as being

“It does not necessarily become a rule of  
political action. ’ * The people have not parted  
with their power of self-government in favor  
of either legislative, executive or the judicial  
branch of the Government. For the benefit  
of so-called Democrats who have criticised  
this plank in the platform, I would recall  
the language of Jefferson already quoted, and  
will add the following: In 1800 Mr. Jeffer­
