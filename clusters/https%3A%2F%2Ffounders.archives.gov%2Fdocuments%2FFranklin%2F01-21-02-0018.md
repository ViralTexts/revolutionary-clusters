The Doctor was dressed in a full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet, and stood conspicuously erect, without the smallest movement of any part of his body. The muscles of his face had been previously composed, so as to afford a placid tranquil expression of countenance, and he did not suffer the slightest alteration of it to appear during the continuance of the speech in which he was so harshly and improperly treated. In short, to quote the words which he employed concerning himself on another occasion, he kept his ‘countenance as immovable as if his features had been made of wood.’”

My Lords,  
The case, which now comes before your Lordships, is justly entitled to all that attention, which, from the presence of so great a number of Lords, and of so large an audience, it appears to have excited. It is a question of no less magnitude, than whether the Crown shall ever have it in its power to employ a faithful and steady servant in the administration of a Colony.  
In the appointment of Mr. Hutchinson, his Majesty’s choice followed the wishes of his people; and no other man could have been named, in whom so many favourable circumstances concurred to recommend him.  
A native of the country, whose ancestors were among its first settlers. A Gentleman, who had for many years presided in their Law Courts; of tried integrity; of confessed abilities; and who had long employed those abilities, in the study of their history and original constitution.  
My Lords, if such a man, without their attempting to alledge one single act of misconduct, during the four years, in which he has been Governor, is to be born down by the mere surmises of this Address, it must then become a case of still greater magnitude, and ever be a matter of doubt, whether the Colony shall henceforward pay respect to any authority derived from this country.  
A charge of some sort however is now preferred against these Gentlemen by this Address; and the prayer of it is, that his Majesty would punish them by a disgraceful removal.  
If they shall appear to have either betrayed the rights of the Crown, or to have invaded the rights of the People, your Lordships doubless will then advise his Majesty no longer to trust his authority with those, who have abused it.  
But if no crime is objected to them, no act of misconduct proved, your Lordships will then do the justice to their characters, which every innocent man has a right to expect; and grant them that protection and encouragement, which is due to officers in their station.  
My Lords, this is not the place to give any opinion about our public transactions relating to the Colonies, and I shall carefully avoid it. But the whole foundation of this Address rests upon events of five and six years standing; and this makes it necessary to take up the history of them from their first original.  
In the beginning of the year 1764,. …  
My Lords, After having gone through the history of this people, for the last ten years, and shewn what has been the behaviour of Mr. Hutchinson in all these occurrences, and the very laudable and friendly part he acted on every occasion for the good of the colony; I now come to consider the argument upon that footing, on which my learned friends have chosen to place it.  
They have read to your Lordships the Assembly’s address; they have read the letters; and they have read the censures passed on them: and, after praying the removal of his Majesty’s Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, they now tell your Lordships: There is no cause to try—There is no charge—There are no accusers—There are no proofs. They say that the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor are disliked by the Assemby, and they ought to be dismissed, because they have lost the confidence of those who complain against them.  
My Lords, This is so very extraordinary a proceeding, that I know of no precedent, except one: but that, I confess, according to the Roman poet’s report, is a case in point.  
  
  
  
Nunquam, si quid mihi credis, amavi  
Hunc hominem. Sed quo cecidit sub crimine? Quisnam  
Delator, Quibus Indicibus? Quo Teste probavit?  
Nil horum, Verbosa et grandis epistola venit  
A Capreis. Bene habet: nil plus interrogo.  
  
My Lords, The only purport of this important address is, that the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor have lost the confidence of the people, upon account of some papers, which they have voted to be unfriendly to them, and that they have been amongst the chief instruments in introducing a fleet and army into the province. Your Lordships have heard the letters read, and are the best judges of their tendency. I can appeal to your Lordships, that it was not these letters, but their own ill conduct, which made it necessary to order the four regiments. In point of time it was impossible: for in Mr. Hutchinson’s very first letter, it appears, that they had an expectation of troops. And they arrived in three months after. I could appeal too to their own knowledge: for the printed collection of Sir Francis Bernard’s and General Gage’s, &amp;c. letters were before them, which indisputably shew the direct contrary.  
  
But as my learned friends have not attempted to point out the demerits of these letters, I need not enter into the defence of them. To call them only innocent letters, would be greatly to depreciate them. They contain the strongest proofs of Mr. Hutchinson’s good sense, his great moderation, and his sincere regard to the welfare of that his native province. Yet, for these it is, that they tell us he has lost the confidence of the people.  
My Lords, There cannot be a more striking instance of the force of truth, than what the Committee, who drew up these papers, exemplify in their conduct. In their second resolution, they acknowledge the high character, in which Mr. Hutchinson stands upon account of his eminent abilities. In the very outset of their address, they acknowledge the good use which he had made of those abilities: for he could not have enjoyed their confidence, as they say he heretofore did, if he had made a bad one. They acknowledge that this confidence subsisted, at least till the time of his being made Governor. Else they could not express their thankfulness to his Majesty as they do, and applaud the appointment of him, as proceeding from the purest motives of rendering his subjects happy.  
In the heighth of their ill will therefore to Mr. Hutchinson, truth looks his enemies full in the face, and extorts from them a confession of his merit, even in the very act of accusing him.  
But, whatever be the censures, which the Assembly may have been induced to pass on him, I will now give your Lordships a proof of his enjoying the people’s confidence, to the very time of the arrival of these letters.  
Every one knows that there are few subjects, in which the people of the colonies have more eagerly interested themselves, than in settling the boundary lines between the several provinces. Some of your Lordships may remember the long hearings which have been held at this Board upon these disputes. Of late, they have taken upon themselves to fix the limits of the King’s charters. An agreement was made between the two Assemblies of New York and Massachusett’s Bay, that they should each appoint their Commissaries, to meet and settle the boundary line between the two provinces. Both of them no doubt looked out for the best men they had for that purpose. But the people of Massachusett’s Bay, after they had chosen their commissaries, still thought that they could more securely trust their interests in their hands, if Mr. Hutchinson would go along with them. To him they had been used to look, as the man, who best knew the history of their first settlements; him they considered as the ablest defender of the province’s rights: and had ever found in him the most zealous affection for their welfare. The party leaders perhaps might have been content to lose to the province any number of acres or a few townships, rather than owe to Mr. Hutchinson the preservation of them. But they did not dare to set their faces against the general sense of the people. The Governor was therefore requested to go with the Commissaries. He did so, and settled for them a much better line, than they had ever expected. And the New York and their own Commissaries both of them acknowledged, that the advantage gained to the province, was chiefly owing to the superior knowledge and abilities of Mr. Hutchinson.  
Thus far then the Governor’s character stands fair and unimpeached. Whatever therefore be the foundation of this Address for his removal, it must be something done by him, or known of him, since his return from this service just before the arrival of these letters. Your Lordships will observe, that his enemies don’t attempt to point out a single action, during the four years, in which he has been Governor, as a subject of complaint. The whole of this Address rests upon the foundation of these letters, written before the time, when either of these Gentlemen were possessed of the offices, from which the Assembly now ask their removal. They owe therefore all the ill will which has been raised against them, and the loss of that confidence, which the Assembly themselves acknowledge they had heretofore injoyed, to Dr. Franklin’s good office in sending back these letters to Boston. Dr. Franklin therefore stands in the light of the first mover and prime conductor of this whole contrivance against his Majesty’s two Governors; and having by the help of his own special confidents and party leaders, first made the Assembly his Agents in carrying on his own secret designs, he now appears before your Lordships to give the finishing stroke to the work of his own hands.  
  
  
How these letters came into the possession of any one but the right owners, is still a mystery for Dr. Franklin to explain. They who know the affectionate regard which the Whatelys had for each other, and the tender concern they felt for the honour of their brother’s memory, as well as their own, can witness the distresses which this occasioned. My Lords, the late Mr. Whately was most scrupulously cautious about his letters. We lived for many years in the strictest intimacy; and in all those years I never saw a single letter written to him. These letters I believe were in his custody at his death. And I as firmly believe, that without fraud, they could not have been got out of the custody of the person whose hands they fell into. His brothers little wanted this additional aggravation to the loss of him. Called upon by their correspondents at Boston; anxious for vindicating their brother’s honour and their own, they enquired; gave to the parties aggrieved all the information in their power; but never accused.  
Your Lordships know the train of mischiefs which followed. But wherein had my late worthy friend or his family offended Dr. Franklin, that he should first do so great an injury to the memory of the dead brother, by secreting and sending away his letters: and then, conscious of what he had done, should keep himself concealed, till he had nearly, very nearly occasioned the murder of the other.  
After the mischiefs of this concealment had been left for five months to have their full operation, at length comes out a letter, which it is impossible to read without horror; expressive of the coolest and most deliberate malevolence. My Lords, what poetic fiction only had penned for the breast of a cruel African, Dr. Franklin has realized, and transcribed from his own. His too is the language of a Zanga:  
  
“Know then ’twas—I.  
I forg’d the letter—I dispos’d the picture—  
I hated, I despis’d, and I destroy.”  
  
  
  
  
The letters could not have come to Dr. Franklin by fair means. The writers did not give them to him; nor yet did the deceased correspondent, who from our intimacy would otherwise have told me of it: Nothing then will acquit Dr. Franklin of the charge of obtaining them by fraudulent or corrupt means, for the most malignant of purposes; unless he stole them, from the person who stole them. This argument is irrefragable.  
I hope, my lords, you will mark [and brand] the man, for the honour of this country, of Europe, and of mankind. Private correspondence has hitherto been held sacred, in times of the greatest party rage, not only in politics but religion. He has forfeited all the respect of societies and of men. Into what companies will he hereafter go with an unembarrassed face, or the honest intrepidity of virtue. Men will watch him with a jealous eye; they will hide their papers from him, and lock up their escrutoires. He will henceforth esteem it a libel to be called a man of letters; homo trium literarum!  
But he not only took away the letters from one brother; but kept himself concealed till he nearly occasioned the murder of the other. It is impossible to read his account, expressive of the coolest and most deliberate malice, without horror. Amidst these tragical events, of one person nearly murdered, of another answerable for the issue, of a worthy governor hurt in his dearest interests, the fate of America in suspense; here is a man, who with the utmost insensibility of remorse, stands up and avows himself the author of all. I can compare it only to Zanga in Dr. Young’s Revenge.  
  
“Know then ’twas—I:  
I forged the letter, I disposed the picture;  
I hated, I despised, and I destroy.”  
  
  
I ask, my Lords, whether the revengeful temper attributed, by poetic fiction only, to the bloody African; is not surpassed by the coolness and apathy of the wily American?  
  
  
What are the motives he assigns for this conduct, I shall now more deliberately consider.  
My Lords, if there be any thing held sacred in the intercourse of mankind, it is their private letters of friendship. If there can be any such private letters, those which passed between the late Mr. Whately and Mr. Oliver are such. The friendship between the two families is of thirty years standing, during all that time there has been kept up an intercourse of letters; first with Mr. Whately, the father, and then with the late Mr. Thomas Whately, the son. In the course of this friendship, a variety of good offices have passed between the two families: one of these fell within the period of these letters. Upon Mr. Oliver’s daughter’s coming to England with her husband upon business, they were received at Nonsuch by Mrs. Whately and her sons, as the son and daughter of their old friend and correspondent. And accordingly your Lordships will find, that one part of these letters is to return thanks for the civilities shewn to Mr. and Mrs. Spooner at Nonsuch.  
These are the letters which Dr. Franklin treats as public letters, and has thought proper to secrete them for his own private purpose. How he got at them, or in whose hands they were at the time of Mr. Whately’s death, the Doctor has not yet thought proper to tell us. Till he do, he wittingly leaves the world at liberty to conjecture about them as they please, and to reason upon those conjectures. But let the letters have been lodged where they may, from the hour of Mr. Thomas Whately’s death, they became the property of his brother and of the Whately family. Dr. Franklin could not but know this, and that no one had a right to dispose of them but they only. Other receivers of goods dishonourably come by, may plead as a pretence for keeping them, that they don’t know who are the proprietors: In this case there was not the common excuse of ignorance; the Doctor knew whose they were, and yet did not restore them to the right owner. This property is as sacred and as precious to Gentlemen of integrity, as their family plate or jewels are. And no man who knows the Whately’s, will doubt, but that they would much sooner have chosen, that any person should have taken their plate, and sent it to Holland for his avarice, than that he should have secreted the letters of their friends, their brother’s friend, and their father’s friend, and sent them away to Boston to gratify an enemy’s malice.  
  
The reasons assigned for this, are as extraordinary as the transaction itself is: They are public letters, to public persons, on public affairs, and intended to produce public measures. This, my Lords, is the first; and the next reason assigned for publishing them is, because the writers desire that the contents of them should be kept secret.  
If these are public letters, I know not what can be reckoned private. If a letter whose first business is to return thanks to an old Lady of seventy, for her civilities at Nonsuch, be not a private letter, it will be necessary that every man should be particularly careful of his papers: for, after this, there never can be wanting a pretence for making them public.  
But says the Doctor, “They were written by public officers.” Can then a man in a public station have no private friends? and write no private letters? Will Dr. Franklin avow the principle, that he has a right to make all private letters of your Lordships his own, and to apply them to such uses as will best answer the purposes of party malevolence? Whatever may have been the confidence heretofore placed in him, such a declaration will not surely contribute to increase it.  
  
But they were written to persons in public stations. Just the contrary to this appears to have been the case: Dr. Franklin is too well acquainted with our history, not to know, that Mr. Whately, during both these years, and for two years before and after, was only a private Member of Parliament; and, as Mr. Oliver justly observes in a letter of his, They at Boston could not be supposed to apply to him as having an interest with the Ministers, when they knew that he was all that time voting in opposition to them.  
Does then the Doctor mean, that his being a Member of Parliament placed him in a public station? And will he then avow, that a Gentleman’s being in Parliament is ground sufficient for him to make his letters lawful plunder, and to send them to his enemies?  
But they were written on public affairs. A very grievous offence! But it is a crime, of which probably we all of us have been guilty, and ought not, surely, for that only, to forfeit the common rights of humanity.  
But they were intended to procure public measures. And does not every man, who writes in confidence to his friend upon political subjects, lament any thing which he thinks to be wrong, and wish to have it amended? And is this the crime of so heinous a nature, as to put Mr. Whately’s friends out of the common protection? and to give to Dr. Franklin a right to hang them up to party rage, and to expose them, for what he knew, to the danger of having their houses a second time pull’d down by popular fury.  
But the writers of them desired secrecy. True, they did so. And what man is there, who, when he is writing in confidence, does not wish for the same thing? Does not every man say things to a friend, which he would not chuse to have published to other people, and much less to his enemies? Would letters of friendship be letters of friendship, if they contained nothing but such indifferent things as might be said to all the world?  
If this is the case at all times with the confidential intercourse of friends, in times of party-violence, there must be a thousand things said in letters, which, though innocent in themselves, either by rival malice or party prejudice, may be turned to a very different construction. These letters themselves have been distorted in this manner; and some expressions in them cannot possibly be understood, without knowing the correspondent letters, to which they refer. And when a factious party had got possession of the Town meetings, and led the Assembly into what resolutions they pleased, and were watching for any pretence to abuse and insult their Governors, is it at all to be wondered, that they did not wish to have the contents of their letters told to their enemies?  
When we read in these letters such passages as these: “If there be no necessity for it, I think it would be best it should not be known that this intelligence comes from me.” Or this: “I have wrote with freedom, in confidence of my name’s not being used on the occasion. For though I have wrote nothing but what, in my conscience, I think an American may, upon just principles, advance, and what a servant of the crown ought, upon all proper occasions, to suggest; yet the many prejudices I have to combat with, may render it unfit it should be made public.” Or this of Mr. Hutchinson’s: “I must beg the favour of you to keep secret every thing I write, until we are in a more settled state, for the party here, either by their Agent, or by some of their emissaries in London, have sent them every report or rumour of the contents of letters wrote from hence. I hope we shall see better times both here and in England.” Or this again of Mr. Oliver’s: “I have wrote with freedom; I consider I am writing to a friend; and that I am perfectly safe in opening myself to you.” Upon reading these passages, which are all there are of this kind, a man, whose heart was cast in the common mould of humanity, would have been apt to say: These are letters irregularly obtained: The writers desire that every thing they write should be kept secret: they belong to Mr. Whately, who never injured me: I will therefore return them to the right owner. Dr. Franklin’s reasoning is of a very different cast. After having just before told us: These are public letters, sent to public persons, designed for public purposes, and therefore I have a right to betray them; he now says, these are letters which the writers desire may be kept secret, and therefore I will send them to their enemies. Prepared on both sides for his rival’s overthrow, he makes that an argument for doing him hurt, which any other man would consider as a principal aggravation of the injustice of it.  
But, if the desiring secrecy be the proof, and the measure of guilt, what then are we to think of Dr. Franklin’s case? whose whole conduct in this affair has been secret and mysterious? and who, through the whole course of it, has discovered the utmost solicitude to keep it so? My Lords, my accounts say, that when these letters were sent over to Boston, so very desirous was Dr. Franklin of secrecy, that he did not chuse to set his name to the letter which accompanied them. This anonymous letter expressly ordered, that it should be shewn to none but to a junto of six persons. If the Doctor chuse it, I will name the six. The direction of every letter was erased, and strict orders were given, that they should be carefully returned again to London. The manner in which they were brought into the Assembly, all shewed the most earnest desire of concealment. Under these mysterious circumstances have the Assembly passed their censures; and voted this Address to his Majesty against Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Oliver, upon account of a parcel of letters directed to some-body, they know not whom; and sent from some-body, they know not where. And Dr. Franklin now appears before your Lordships, wrapt up in impenetrable secrecy, to support a charge against his Majesty’s Governor and Lieutenant Governor; and expects that your Lordships should advise the punishing them, upon account of certain letters, which he will not produce, and which he dares not tell how he obtained.  
But the Doctor says, he transmitted them to his constituents.  
That Dr. Franklin sent these letters to such persons as he thought would in some way or other bring them into the Assembly, may be true. And accordingly, after an alarm of some dreadful discovery, these letters were produced by one single person, pretending to be under an injunction to observe the strictest secrecy, and to suffer no copies to be taken of them. After allowing two or three days for Fame to amplify, and for Party-malice to exaggerate; and after having thereby raised a general prejudice against the Governor; at length another Member tells the Assembly, that he had received from an unknown hand a copy of the letters; and wished to have that copy compared and authenticated with the originals. After this, when they had brought the Council into their measures, they then found their powers enlarged; and that they were at liberty to shew them to any one, provided they did not suffer them to go out of their hands; and the King’s Governor and Lieutenant-Governor were permitted to look upon them only in this opprobrious manner, in order to render the indignity so much the more offensive.  
This Dr. Franklin may call transmitting the letters to his constituents; and upon those who know nothing of the course of these proceedings, may easily impose the belief of it: But your Lordships will readily see, and every man who has been an agent very well knows, that this is not what is meant by transmitting to his constituents. My Lords, when an agent means to write to the Assembly, he addresses his letter to the Speaker, to be communicated to the House. And the Doctor knows, that there are many articles in the Journals of this tenor; “A letter from Dr. Franklin to the Speaker, was read.”  
But the course taken with these letters was just the reverse of this. The letter which came with them was anonymous; though the hand was well known: too well perhaps known to the selected few, who only were to be allowed the sight of it. Since therefore the Doctor has told us that he transmitted these letters to his constituents, we know now who they are. His constituents, by his own account, must be this particular junto: for to them, and them only, were the letters communicated. Dr. Franklin did not communicate them, as their agent, to the Assembly: For whatever may have been the whispers of this junto, the Assembly, as an Assembly, does not to this day know by whom the letters were sent. And so little do these innocent well-meaning farmers, which compose the bulk of the Assembly, know what they are about, that by the arts of these leaders, they have been brought to vote an Address to his Majesty to dismiss his Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, founded upon certain papers, which they have not named; sent to them from some-body, they know not whom; and originally directed to some-body, they cannot tell where: for, my Lords, my accounts say, that it did not appear to the House that these letters had ever been in London.  
I have pointed out to your Lordships, the manner in which this conspiracy against the Governor was conducted, with all its circumstances, as the letters from Boston relate them. And from this account your Lordships will not wonder that I consider Dr. Franklin not so much in the light of an agent for the Assembly’s purpose, as in that of a first mover and prime conductor of it for his own; not as the Assembly’s agent for avenging this dreadful conspiracy of Mr. Hutchinson against his native country; but as the actor and secret spring, by which all the Assembly’s motions were directed: the inventor and first planner of the whole contrivance. He it was that received and sent away Mr. Whately’s letters. By what means he laid his hands on them, he does not say; till he do, he leaves us at liberty to suppose the worst; I would wish to suggest the best. One case only must be excepted; Dr. Franklin will not add another injury, and say to the representative of the Whately family, that they were any of them consenting to the perfidy. And yet, my Lords, nothing but that consent could put him honourably in possession of them, and much less give him a right to apply them to so unwarrantable a purpose.  
My Lords, there is no end of this mischief. I have now in my hand an expostulatory letter from a Mr. Roome, not a native of America, but sent from London to Rhode Island, to collect in and sue for large outstanding debts there. This poor man, in a familiar letter to a friend in the same province, expresses a just indignation at the difficulties he met with in executing his trust, from the iniquitous tendency of their laws, and of the proceedings of their courts, to defraud their English creditors; and then gives him an invitation to come and spend some time with him at his country house, and catch perch and be of their fishing party. For this letter, the Assembly brought him under examination, and committed him to prison, because he would not answer to his printed name at the end of one of the letters in this book. Upon this occasion he writes a letter to one of his imployers, with whom he had served his clerkship here in London, expostulating on the cruelty and injustice of the executors suffering their dead brother’s papers to be applied to such a purpose. For he, my Lords, had no conception that any one else could have made this use of letters which did not belong to him. Mr. Roome had heard that the Boston letters had all been sent back again to London; and knew that their Speaker was directed to procure his original letter, in order to their proceeding against him still more severely. The Merchant here came with this letter to a friend of Mr. Whately’s, desiring that he would go with him to Mr. Whately, and join in intreating him, not to send back the letter to their Speaker, which would oblige him, he writes, either to fly the Province, or else to suffer a long imprisonment. My Lords, Mr. Whately’s friend had seen too much of the anguish of mind under which he had been suffering for the five months since this discovery. He knew that it would be giving him another stab to suffer a stranger abruptly to put this letter into his hands; he informed the merchant of the state of the affair, and prevented his going to him.  
But what had this poor man done to Dr. Franklin, that his letter should be sent back too? Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Oliver were public persons, and their letters, according to the Doctor’s new code of morality, may be lawful prize: But Mr. Roome’s is a name we had never heard of. Was he too a man in a public station? His friend, to whom he sent this invitation to come a fishing with him, was he a public person? Could Mr. Roome, when he was writing to New London, imagine that he was writing a letter to be shewn to the King? and to alienate his affections from that loyal people? Did the sailing of the four Regiments to Boston depend upon the intelligence of a man at Narragansett? The writer of this letter could not have a thought of its producing public measures. Surely then the returning of this letter might have been omitted; and this poor man at least might have been spared. But all men, be they in public stations or in private, be they great or small, all are prey that unfortunately fall into Dr. Franklin’s hands: He wantonly and indiscriminately sends back the letters of all; unfeeling of the reflection, which must arise in every other breast, that what is sport to him, may be imprisonment and death to them.  
But under all this weight of suspicion, in the full view of all the mischievous train of consequences which have followed from this treachery (for such there must be somewhere, though Dr. Franklin does not chuse to let us know where to fix it) with a whole province set in a flame; with an honest innocent man thrown into jail, and calling on Mr. Whately not to furnish the means of fixing him there; with a worthy family distressed, in the reflections cast on their own character, and in the sufferings brought upon their friends and correspondents; with the memory of one brother greatly injured, and the life of another greatly indangered; with all this weight of suspicion, and with all this train of mischiefs before his eyes, Dr. Franklin’s apathy sets him quite at ease, and he would have us think, that he has done nothing more than what any other Colony Agent would have done. He happened only to be the first Colony Agent who laid his hands on them, and he thought it his duty to transmit them to his constituents.  
My Lords, I have the pleasure of knowing several very respectable Gentlemen, who have been Colony Agents, and cannot but feel a little concern at seeing this strange imputation cast on that character. I have heard the sentiments of some of them. Upon being asked, whether, if they had laid their hands upon another Gentleman’s letters, they would have thought it their duty to make a like use of them: My Lords, they received the proposal with horror. One of them said, it was profaning the word Duty to apply it to such a purpose; another, that if he had been their Agent, he would sooner have cut off his right hand than have done such a thing.  
My Lords, Dr. Franklin’s mind may have been so possessed with the idea of a Great American Republic, that he may easily slide into the language of the minister of a foreign independent state. A foreign Ambassador when residing here, just before the breaking out of a war, or upon particular occasions, may bribe a villain to steal or betray any state papers; he is under the command of another state, and is not amenable to the laws of the country where he resides; and the secure exemption from punishment may induce a laxer morality.  
But Dr. Franklin, whatever he may teach the people at Boston, while he is here at least is a subject; and if a subject injure a subject, he is answerable to the law. And the Court of Chancery will not much attend to his new self-created importance.  
But, my Lords, the rank in which Dr. Franklin appears, is not even that of a Province Agent: he moves in a very inferior orbit. An Agent for a province, your Lordships know, is a person chosen by the joint act of the Governor, Council, and Assembly; after which, a commission is issued by the Secretary, under the province seal, appointing him to that office. Such a real Colony Agent, being made by the joint concurrence of all the three branches of the Government, will think it his duty to consult the joint service of all the three; and to contribute all he can to the peace, harmony, and orderly government of the whole; as well as to the general welfare and prosperity of the province. This at least is what I learn from the copy books of two Gentlemen, who at different periods were Agents for this very Colony. But Dr. Franklin’s appointment seems to have been made in direct opposition to all these. Upon a message from the Council to the Assembly, desiring that they would join in the choice of an Agent for the Colony, they came to a resolution, that they will not join with the Honourable Board in the choice of such an Agent; but resolve that they will choose an Agent of their own; and then, that Dr. Franklin should be that Agent. My Lords, the party by whom the Assembly is now directed, did not want a man who should think himself bound in duty to consult for the peace and harmony of the whole government; they had their own private separate views, and they wanted an agent of their own, who should be a willing instrument and instructor in the accomplishing their own separate purposes. Dr. Franklin therefore, your Lordships see, not only moves in a different orbit from that of other Colony Agents, but he gravitates also to a very different center. His great point appears to be to serve the interest of his party; and privately to supply the leaders of it with the necessary intelligence. Wheresoever and howsoever he can lay his hands on them, he thinks it his duty to furnish materials for dissentions; to set at variance the different branches of the Legislature; and to irritate and incense the minds of the King’s subjects against the King’s Governor.  
But, says the Doctor, the tendency of these letters was to incense the mother country against her colonies.  
There is a certain steadiness which is singularly remarkable in this case. These men are perpetually offering every kind of insult to the English nation. Setting the King’s authority at defiance; treating the parliament as usurpers of an authority not belonging to them, and flatly denying the Supreme Jurisdiction of the British empire: And have been publishing their votes and resolutions for this purpose; and yet now pretend a great concern about these letters, as having a tendency to incense the parent state against the colony. Not content with bidding defiance to our authority, they now offer insult to our understanding: And at the very time while they are flying in the King’s face, would have him turn out his Governor, because he has in the mildest terms intimated his opinion, that they do not pay the reverence, they used to do, to the British authority.  
My Lords, we are perpetually told of men’s incensing the mother country against the colonies, of which I have never known a single instance: But we hear nothing of the vast variety of arts, which have been made use of to incense the colonies against the mother country. And in all these arts no one I fear has been a more successful proficient, than the very man, who now stands forth as Mr. Hutchinson’s accuser. My Lords, as he has been pleased in his own letter to avow this accusation, I shall now return the charge, and shew to your Lordships, who it is that is the true incendiary, and who is the great abetter of that faction at Boston, which, in form of a Committee of Correspondence, have been inflaming the whole province against his Majesty’s government.  
My Lords, the language of Dr. Franklin’s peculiar correspondents is very well known. For years past they have been boasting of the countenance, which he receives in England, and the encouragement, which he sends over to them at Boston. One of their last boasted advices was: Go on, abstain from violence, but go on; for you have nothing to fear from the government here.  
My Lords, from the excess of their zeal, these men are apt sometimes to let out a little too much. In the Boston Gazette of the 20th of September last is a letter, understood at Boston to have been written by Mr. Adams, one of Dr. Franklin’s six constituents, which ends with the following passage. “The late Agent Mr. De Bert in one of his letters wrote, that Lord Hillsborough professed a great regard for the interest of America; and he thought the only thing that could be done to serve us, was to keep the matter of right out of sight. The professed design of that minister it seems was to serve us. But America has not yet thought it wise to agree to his Lordship’s political plan, to wink their liberties out of sight, for the sake of a temporary accommodation. Dr. Franklin, who is perhaps as penetrating a genius as his Lordship, extended his views a little farther. ‘I hope,’ says he, in a letter dated in 1771, ‘the colony Assemblies will show by repeated resolves, that they know their rights, and do not lose sight of them. Our growing importance will ere long compel an acknowledgment of them, and establish and secure them to our posterity.’ And he adds, ‘I purpose to draw up a memorial stating our rights and grievances, and in the name and behalf of the province, protesting particularly against the late innovations. Whether speedy redress is or is not the consequence, I imagine it may be of good use to keep alive our claims, and show that we have not given up the contested points.’ It seems to have been the judgment of this great man, that a state of rights should accompany a complaint of grievances; and that decent and manly protests aginst particular innovations, have the surest tendency to an effectual, if not a speedy removal of them.”  
Your Lordships will be pleased to observe the time of Dr. Franklin’s announcing his intention of drawing up for them such a memorial, was in 1771. At the proper season in the next year, there was produced a great work, under these very heads of a State of Rights, and a State of Grievances, and Protests against the new Innovations: But not from the press in London; that would not have answered the purpose. It was to be a memorial in the name and behalf of the province; and therefore was first to be sent thither, and receive the stamp of their authorities. A town meeting therefore was called, and a Committee of Correspondence chosen, to draw up a state of their rights and grievances, and from the form of the resolution it is pretty manifest, that the leaders knew already what the work was to be. After an adjournment the Committee met, and produced this great twelve-penny book, under the very heads of a State of their Rights, and containing a list of their Grievances, with remonstrances sufficiently strong against what they call Innovations. The work was received with the utmost applause, and instantly converted into votes and resolutions of the town of Boston. And doubtless it well deserved it: It is a set of ready drawn heads of a declaration for any one colony in America, or any one distant county in the kingdom, which shall chuse to revolt from the British empire, and say that they will not be governed by the King and Parliament at Westminster. They therefore voted that this report of their Committee of Correspondence should be printed in a pamphlet, and that six hundred copies of them should be disposed of to the select men of the towns of the province, with an inflammatory letter, sounding an alarm of a plan of despotism, with which the Administration (and the Parliament) intended to enslave them; and threatened them with certain and inevitable destruction: And desiring that they would call town-meetings, and send their votes and resolutions upon this book. In 60 or 70 villages or townships such meetings had been held: And all express the highest approbation of this excellent performance. And well they might; for it told them a hundred rights, of which they never had heard before, and a hundred grievances which they never before had felt. Your Lordships see the votes and instructions of these several townships, in the Boston gazettes here before me. They are full of the most extravagant absurdities. Such as the enthusiastic rants of the wildest of my countrymen in Charles the 2d’s days cannot equal. It is impossible to read them to your Lordships: Those of Pembrok and of Marble-head are particularly curious: but I shall take those of the town of Petersham.  
“Resolved, That the Parliament of Great-Britain, usurping and exercising a legislative authority over, and extorting an unrighteous revenue from these colonies, is against all divine and human laws. The late appointment of salaries to be paid to our Superior Court Judges, whose creation, pay, and commission, depend on mere will and pleasure, complete a system of bondage equal to any ever before fabricated by the combined efforts of the ingenuity, malice, fraud, and wickedness of man.  
Therefore, Resolved, That it is the first and highest social duty of this people, to consider of, and seek ways and means for a speedy redress of these mighty grievances and intolerable wrongs; and that for the obtainment of this end, this people are warranted, by the laws of God and nature, in the use of every rightful art, and energy of Policy, Stratagem, and Force.  
Therefore, it is our earnest desire, and we here direct you, to use your utmost influence (as one of the legislative body) to convince the nation of Great-Britain, that the measures that they have meted out to us, will have a direct tendency to destroy both them and us; and petition the King and Parliament of Great-Britain, in the most pathetic and striking manner, to relieve us from our aggravated grievances; but if all this should fail, we recommend it to your consideration, and direct you to move it to the consideration of the honourable Court, whether it would not be best to call in the aid of some Protestant Power or Powers, requesting that they would use their kind and Christian influence, with our mother country, that so we may be relieved, and that brotherly love and harmony may again take place.”  
These are the lessons taught in Dr. Franklin’s school of Politics. My Lords, I do not say that Dr. Franklin is the original author of this book. But your Lordships will give me leave to observe, in the first place, that it is not very likely, that any of the Doctor’s scholars at Boston, should attempt to draw up such a state of rights and grievances, when the great man, their master, had given them notice that he should himself set about such a work: and, in the next place, that if the Doctor should not chuse now to filiate the child, yet the time has been when he was not ashamed of it; for, after it had had its operation in America, the Doctor reprinted it here, with a preface of his own, and presented it to his friends.  
My Lords, I have said, that sixty or seventy of the townships had already voted their approbation of the book. The evil was catching from town to town (and if the greater part could have been engaged, they would have forced the rest) when the Governor thought it his duty to interpose. He therefore called upon the Assembly to disown these undutiful proceedings. Had he only mentioned the disloyalty and evil tendency of them, they would probably have passed a few resolutions, and have suffered the evil to go on. He was well aware, that the Assembly could easily vote themselves as many privileges as they pleased, but that it was not so easy to prove their right to them. He, therefore, disarmed them of their strength in voting, and put them under the necessity of proving; and there he knew they would fail. By opening the session with that very masterly speech in defence of the British American constitution, he, for a time, stunned the faction, and gave a check to the progress of their Town-Meetings. And though the same men [who] were in the Assembly created a Committee of Correspondence, to write to the Assemblies of the other provinces, yet the spirit of the design languished, and but little more was then done in it.  
This, my Lords, is the great and principal ground of their quarrel with Mr. Hutchinson. They want a Governor, who shall know less than themselves, whereas he makes them feel that he knows more. He stopped the train which Dr. Franklin’s constituents had laid, to blow up the province into a flame, which from thence was to have been spread over the other provinces. This was the real provocation: and for this they have been seeking for some ground of accusation against him.  
After sifting his whole conduct for the four years, in which he has been Governor, they are not able to point out a single action to find fault with. Their only recourse is to their own surmises of what were the sentiments of his heart five or six years ago. He was, they say, among the instruments in introducing a fleet and army into the province. Have they attempted any proof of this? No. But they fancy it from some letters of his, which do not say a single word of that sort. Is it possible to conceive of a more groundless accusation, or not to see their intent in it?  
My Lords, They mean nothing more by this Address, than to fix a stigma on the Governor by the accusation. Their charge, founded upon a pretence of knowing six years ago, what were Mr. Hutchinson’s thoughts, is not really designed for his Majesty in Council. They know that your Lordships will not take an accusation for a proof; nor condemn without evidence. They never desired to be brought to a hearing: and therefore the first instant when your Lordships call for their proofs, they fly off, and say they do not mean this as a charge, or a trial before your Lordships; and they say truly: they meant to bring it before the multitude, and to address the popular prejudices. The mob, they know, need only hear their Governors accused, and they will be sure to condemn. My Lords, they boast at Boston, that they have found this method succeed against their last Governor, and they hope to make it do against this; and by a second precedent to establish their power, and make all future Governors bow to their authority. They wish to erect themselves into a tyranny greater than the Roman: To be able, sitting in their own secret cabal, to dictate for the Assembly, and send away their verbosa et grandis epistola, and get even a virtuous Governor dragged from his seat, and made the sport of a Boston mob.  
Having turned out all other Governors, they may at length hope to get one of their own. The letters from Boston, for two years past, have intimated that Dr. Franklin was aiming at Mr. Hutchinson’s government. It was not easy before this to give credit to such surmises: But nothing surely but a too eager attention to an ambition of this sort, could have betrayed a wise man into such a conduct as we have now seen. Whether these surmises are true or not, your Lordships are much the best judges. If they should be true, I hope that Mr. Hutchinson will not meet with the less countenance from your Lordships, for his Rival’s being his accuser. Nor will your Lordships, I trust, from what you have heard, advise the having Mr. Hutchinson displaced, in order to make room for Dr. Franklin as a successor.  
With regard to his constituents, the factious leaders at Boston, who make this complaint against their Governor; if the relating of their evil doings be criminal, and tending to alienate his Majesty’s affections, must not the doing of them be much more so? Yet now they ask that his Majesty will gratify and reward them for doing these things; and that he will punish their Governor for relating them, because they are so very bad that it cannot but offend his Majesty to hear of them.  
My Lords, if the account, given in these letters, of their proceedings, five years ago, tended to alienate his Majesty’s affections, has their conduct ever since been in any respect more conciliating? Was it to confute or prevent the pernicious effect of these letters, that the good men of Boston have lately held their meetings, appointed their Committees, and with their usual moderation destroyed the cargo of three British ships? If an English Consul, in any part of France or Spain, or rather Algiers or Tripoli, (for European Powers respect the law of nations) had not called this an outrage on his country, he would have deserved punishment. But if a Governor at Boston should presume to whisper to a friend, that he thinks it somewhat more than a moderate exertion of English liberty, to destroy the ships of England, to attack her officers, to plunder their goods, to pull down their houses, or even to burn the King’s ships of war, he ought to be removed; because such a conduct in him has a natural and efficacious tendency to interrupt the harmony between Great-Britain and the colony, which these good subjects are striving by such means to establish.  
On the part of Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Oliver, I am instructed to assure your Lordships, that they feel no spark of resentment, even at the individuals who have done them this injustice. Their private letters breathe nothing but moderation. They are convinced that the people, though misled, are innocent. If the conduct of a few should provoke a just indignation, they would be the most forward, and, I trust, the most efficacious solicitors to avert its effects, and to excuse the men. They love the soil, the constitution, the people of New-England; they look with reverence to this country, and with affection to that. For the sake of the people they wish some faults corrected, anarchy abolished, and government re-established: But these salutary ends they wish to promote by the gentlest means; and the abridging of no liberties, which a people can possibly use to its own advantage. A restraint from self-destruction is the only restraint they desire to be imposed upon New-England.  
My Lords, I have said that the letter, which accompanied these in question, was anonymous, and that it was directed to be shown to six persons only.  
  
I am prepared to enter into the proof of this. I call upon Dr. Franklin, for my witness. And I am ready to examine him.  
N. B. Dr. Franklin being present, remained silent. But declared by his counsel, that he did not chuse to be examined.  
  
  
II. The Report of the Privy Council Committee  
At the Council Chamber Whitehall the 29th. day of January 1774.  
Your Majesty having been pleased by Your Order in Council of the 10th. of last Month, to referr unto this Committee, an address of the House of Representatives of the province of Massachusets Bay complaining of the Conduct of Thomas Hutchinson Esquire Governor, and Andrew Oliver Esquire Lieutenant Governor of that province; and humbly praying that Your Majesty would be pleased to remove the said Thomas Hutchinson Esquire and Andrew Oliver Esquire from their posts in that Government; The Lords of the Committee did in Obedience to Your Majesty’s said Order of Reference, proceed on the 11th. of this Instant to take the petition of the said House of Representatives into Consideration, and were attended by Benjamin Franklin Esquire, Stileing himself agent for the said House of Representatives (and from whom the said petition had been transmitted to the Right Honourable the Earl of Dartmouth One of Your Majesty’s principal Secretaries of State) and likewise by Israel Mauduit Esquire from whom application had been made to this Committee humbly praying on behalf of Your Majesty’s said Governor and Lieutenant Governor, that he might be heard by Counsel in relation to the Address of the House of Representatives of the said Province; and the said Benjamin Franklin Esquire having thereupon prayed, that he might in that Case be heard also by his Counsel at a future Day; The Lords of the Committee did in compliance with the petition of the said Israel Mauduit Esquire and at the Instance of the said Benjamin Franklin Esquire, think proper to appoint a further Day to resume the Consideration of the said petition of the House of Representatives of Massachusets Bay, and to allow Counsel to be heard on both sides thereupon. And their Lordships having been this Day attended by Counsel on both sides accordingly and heard all that they had to offer, and having maturely weighed and considered the whole of the Evidence adduced by the said Benjamin Franklin Esquire, upon which the said House of Representatives did come to the several Resolves, which are the foundation of their said Petition to Your Majesty; The Lords of the Committee take leave to represent to Your Majesty, that the said House of Representatives have by their said petition taken upon themselves to bring a general Charge against Your Majesty’s said Governor and Lieutenant Governor and to complain of their Conduct, “as having a natural and efficacious tendency to interrupt and alienate the affections of Your Majesty from that Your Loyal province, To Destroy that Harmony and good Will between Great Britain and that Colony which every honest Subject would strive to Establish, To Excite the Resentment of the Brittish Administration against that province, To defeat the Endeavours of their Agents and friends to serve them by a fair Representation of their State of facts, To prevent their Humble and repeated petitions from reaching the Ear of Your Majesty or having their Desired Effect; and finally Charging Your Majesty’s said Governor and Lieutenant Governor with having been among the Chief Instruments of introducing a Fleet and an army into that province; to Establish and perpetuate their plans, whereby Your Majesty’s said Governor and Lieutenant Governor have been not only greatly instrumental of Disturbing the peace and Harmony of the Government, and causing unnatural and hateful Discords and animosities between the several parts of Your Majesty’s Extensive Dominions, but are justly chargeable with all that Corruption of Morals, and all that Confusion Misery and Bloodshed, which have been the natural Effects of posting an Army in a Populous Town”; But the Lords of the Committee cannot but express their Astonishment, that a Charge of so serious and extensive a nature against the persons whom the said House of Representatives acknowledge by their said petition to have heretofore had the Confidence and Esteem of the people and to have been advanced by Your Majesty from the purest Motives of rendering Your Subjects happy to the highest places of Trust and Authority in that province, should have no other Evidence to support it but inflammatory and precipitate Resolutions founded only on certain Letters written respectively by them (and all but one before they were appointed to the posts they now hold) in the Years 1767, 1768 and 1769, to a Gentleman then in no Office under the Government, in the course of Familiar Correspondence, and in the Confidence of private Friendship, and which it was said (and it was not denied by Mr. Franklin) were surreptitiously obtained after his Death, and sent over to America, and laid before the Assembly of the Massachusets Bay; and which Letters appear to Us to contain nothing Reprehensible, or Unworthy of the Situation they were in. And We presume that it was from this Impropriety that the Counsel did Disclaim on behalf of the Assembly any Intention of bringing a Criminal Charge against the Governor and Lieutenant Governor; but said that the petition was founded Solely on the Ground of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor being as they alledged, now become obnoxious to the people of the Province; and that it was in this Light only that the said petition [was] presented to Your Majesty; And there being no other Evidence now produced than the said Resolutions and Letters, together with Resolutions of a Similar Import by the Council of the said province founded, as it was said on the same Letters; The Lords of the Committee do agree humbly to Report, as their Opinion to Your Majesty that the said petition is founded upon Resolutions, formed upon False and Erroneous allegations, and that the same is groundless, Vexatious and Scandalous and calculated only for the Seditious Purpose of keeping up a Spirit of Clamour and Discontent in the said province. And the Lords of the Committee do further humbly Report to Your Majesty that nothing has been laid before them, which does or can, in their Opinion in any manner or in any Degree, Impeach the Honour, Integrity or Conduct, of the said Governor or Lieutenant Governor. And their Lordships are humbly of Opinion that the said Petition ought to be Dismissed

MY LORDS,  
  
HE cafe, which now comes before vour Lord ſhips,  
is Juſti, entitled to all that attention, which, from  
the F of ſo great a number of Lords, and of lo large  
an ience, it appears to have excited. It is a queſtion of  
no leis magnitude, than whether the crown ſhall ever have  
it in its power to employ a faithful and ſteady ſervant a  
the adn..niſtration of a colony.  
In the appointment of Mr. Hetchinſon, his Majeſty $  
choice followed the wiſhes of his people; and no other  
man could have been named, in hon ſo many favourable  
_ circumſtances all concurred to recommend him.  
A native of the country , whole anceſtors were among  
its firſt ſettlers. A Gentleman who had for many years  
preſided in their law-courts; of tried integrity; of confeſſ-  
cd abilities; and who had long employed thole abilities, in  
the ſtudy of their hiſtory and original conſtitution.  
My Lords, if ſuch a man, without their attempting to  
alledge one ſingle act of miſconduct, during the four years  
in which he has been Governor, is to be born down by the  
mere ſurmiſes of this addreſs, it muſt then become a caſe of  
ſtill greater magnitude, and ever be a matter of doubt, whe-  
ther the colony ſhall henceforward pay reſpect to any au-  
thority derived from this country.  
A charge of ſome ſort however is now e againſt  
theſe Gentlemen by this addreſs; and the prayer of it is  
that his Majeſty would puniſh them by a dilgraceful re-  
moval.  
If they ſhall appear to have either betray od the rights of  
5 the crown, or to 0 have invaded the rights of the Pei your  
  
Lordſhips  
  
E |  
Lordſhips doubtleſs will then adviſe his Majeſty no longer to  
truſt his authority with thoſe, who have abuſed it.  
But if no crime is objected to them, no act of ts:  
duct proved, your Lordſhips will then do the juſtice to  
their characters, which every innocent man has a right to  
expect; and grant them that protection and encourage  
ment, which 1 15 duc to officers in their ſtation. 8  
My Lords, thus is not the place to give any opinion a-  
bout our public tranſaftions relating to the colonies, and I  
ſhall carefully avoid it. ut the whole foundation of this  
addreſs refts upon eve: 1+ of five and fix years ſtanding;  
and this makes it neceſſary to o take up the hiſtory of them  
jrom their firſt original. | |

i My Lords, after having gone through the Ee of this  
  
people, for the laſt ten years, and ſhewn what has been the  
behaviour of Mr. Hutchinſon in all theſe occurrences, and  
the very laudable and friendly part he acted on every occa-  
ſion for the good of the colony; I now come to conſider  
the argument upon that&#x27; W on which my learned friends |  
have choſen to place it.  
  
They have read to your 1 the aſſembly 0  
they have read the letters; and they have read the cenſures  
paſſed on them: and after praying the removal of his Ma-  
jeſty&#x27;s Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, they now tell  
your Lordſhips: there is no cauſe to try There is no  
charge There are no accuſers There are no proofs.—  
They fav that the Governor and Lieutenant Governor are  
diſſiked by the aſſembly, and they ought to be diſmiſſed,  
becauſe they have loſt the confidence of thoſe who _— ,  
againſt them.  
  
My Lords, This is ſo very extraordinary a proceeding  
that [ know of no precedent, Except one: but that, [ confeſs  
  
4 ccording  
  
| 1  
according to the Roman poet&#x27;s — is a caſe in point.  
  
| Nunquam, fi quid mihi credis, amavi  
Hunc hominem.—Sed quo cecidit ſub crimine?—Quiſfnam _  
Delator—Quibus Indicibus ?—Quo Teſte probavit—  
  
  
A Capreis—Bene habet nil plus interrogo.  
  
XI Lords, The only purport of this important addreſs is,  
. that the Governor and Lieutenant Governor have loſt the  
confidence of the people, upon account of ſome papers,  
which they have voted to be unfriendly to them, and fat  
they have been among ſt the chief inſtruments in introducing @ |  
fleet and army into the province. —Your Lordſhips have heard  
the letters read, and are the beſt judges of their tendency.  
I can appeal to yonr Lordſhips, that it was not theſe letters  
but their own ill- conduct, which made it neceſſary to or-  
der the four regiments. In point of time it was impoſſible,  
for in Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s very firſt letter, it appears, that  
they had an expectation of troops. And they arri ved in  
three months after. I could appeal too to their own know-  
ledge: for the printed collection of Sir Francis Bernard&#x27;s  
and General Gage&#x27;s &amp; c. letters were before them, which  
. nne ſhew the direct contrary.  
But as my learned friends have not attempted to point  
out the demerits of theſe letters, J need not enter into the  
defence of them. To call them only innocent letters would  
de greatly to depreciate them. They contain the ſtrongeſt  
proofs of Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s good ſenſe, his great moderati-  
on, and his ſincere regard to the welfare of that his native  
province. Yet, for theſe it is, that _ tell us he has loſt  
the confidence of the pcople.  
My Lords, there cannot be 2 more friking fines of  
7 the force of truth, than what the Committee, who drew ap  
theſe papers, exemplify in their conduct. In their ſecond  
reſolution they acknowledge the high character, in which  
Mr. Hutchinſon ſtands upon account of his eminent abilities,  
In the very outſet of their addreſg they acknowledge  
  
the  
  
T1  
  
  
could not have enjoyed their confidence, as they ſay he  
heretofore did, if he had made a bad one. They acknow-  
ledge that this confidence ſubſiſted, at leaſt till the time of  
his being made Governor. Elſe they could not expreſs  
  
  
x rendering his ſub j ects happy.  
  
  
act of accuſing him.  
  
  
may have been induced to paſs on him, I will now give  
  
  
: fidence, to the very time of the arrival of theſe letters.  
  
  
the ſeveral provinces. Some of your Lordſhips may re-  
  
  
board upon theſe diſputes. Of late, they have taken upon  
themſelves to fix the limits of the King&#x27;s charters. An  
  
  
line between the two provinces. Both of them no doubt  
looked out for the beſt men they had for that purpoſe.  
But the people of Maſſachuſett&#x27;s Bay, after they had cho-  
ſen their commiſſaries, till thought that they could more  
3 truſt their intereſts in their hands, if Mr. Hutch-  
inſon would go along with ther. To him they had been  
uſed to look, as the man, who beſt knew the hiſtory of  
  
  
defender of the province&#x27;s rights: and had ever found in  
him the moſt zealous affection for their velfare. The  
  
party  
  
1  
  
party leaders perhaps might have been content to loſe to  
the province any number of acres or a few townſhips, ra-  
  
  
them. But they did not dare to ſet their faces againſt the  
general ſenſe of the people. The Governor was therefore  
  
  
  
both of them acknowledged, that the advantage gained to  
  
  
Thus far then the Governor&#x27;s character ſtands fair and:  
  
  
him, or known of him fince his return from this ſervice  
juſt before the arrival of theſe letters. Your Lordſhips

whole contrivance againſt his Majeſty&#x27;s two Governors;

not reſtore them to the right owner— This Property is as  
I „„ ſacred  
  
6 ]  
  
ſacred and as precious to gentlemen of | integrity, as their fa-  
  
mily plate or jewels are. And no man, who knows the  
  
; W hately&#x27; s, will doubt, but that they would much ſooner  
have choſen, that any perſon ſnould have taken their plate,  
and ſent it to Holland for his avarice, than that he ſkould  
  
have ſecreted the letters of their friends, their brother&#x27;s  
  
  
ſton to gratify an enemy &#x27;s malice.  
The reaſons aſſigned tor this, are as extraordinary as the  
tranſaction itſelf is: They are public letters, to public per-  
ſons, on public affairs, and intended to produce public mea-  
ſures. This, my Lords, is the firſt; and the next reaſon  
aſſigned for publiſhing them is, becauſe the writers deſire  
. that the contents of them ſhould be kept ſecret. -  
If theſe are public letters, I know not what can be rec-  
5 koned private. If a letter whoſe firſt buſineſs is to return  
thanks to an old lady of ſeventy, for her civilities at Non-  
ſuch, be not a private letter, it will be neceſſary that every  
man ſhould be particularly careful of his papers: for after  
this, there never can be —_— a Pon for making  
them public *.  
But ſais the Doctor, 710 were written by public O.  
cer. Can then a man in a public ſtation have no private  
friends? and write no private letters? Will Dr. Franklin  
avow the principle, that he has a right to make all private  
letters of your Lordſhips his own, and to apply them to  
ſuch uſes as will beft anſwer the purpoſes of party male-  
volence? Whatever may have been the confidence here-  
  
tofore placed in him, ſuch a declaration will not ſurely con-  
| tribute to increaſe it.

TE  
  
But they were written to per ſons in public Hula. Juſt  
the contrary to this appears to have been the caſe: Dr.  
  
Franklin is to well acquainted with our hiſtory, not to  
2 know, that Mr. Whately during both thele Years, and for  
two years before and after, was only a private member  
  
  
having an intereſt with the Miniſters, when they knew that he  
_ was all that time voting in 6ppoſe tion to &#x27;em.  
Does then the Doctor mean, that his being a member of  
parliament placed him in a public ſtation ?—And will he  
then avow, that a gentleman&#x27;s being in parliament is ground  
ſufficient for him to make his letters lawful plunder and to  
| ſend them to his enemies?  
  
But they were written on public affairs. A very grievous  
offence! But it is a crime, of which probably we all of us  
have been guilty, and ought not ſurely, for that only, te to  
| forfeit the common rights of humanity.  
  
But they were intended no procure public RO I And  
  
dons not every man, who writes in confidence to his friend  
upon political ſubjects, lament any thing which he thinks  
to be wrong, and wiſh to have it amended? And is this  
the crime of ſo heinous a nature, as to put Mr. Whately&#x27;s  
friends out of the common protection? and to give to Dr.  
Franklin a right to hang them up to party rage, and to ex- |  
poſe them, for what he knew, to the danger of having  
their houſes a ſecond time pull&#x27;d down. IF: popular |  
fury.  
  
But the writers of them fred ſecrecy. Trae: they did  
  
ſo. And what man is there, who, when he is writing in  
| confidence, does not wiſh for the ſame thing? does not eve-  
  
ry men ſay things to a friend, which he would not chuſe  
to have publiſhed to other people, and much leſs to his e-  
nemies ? Would letters of friendſhip, be letters of friendſhip _  
  
if they contained nothing but ſuch indifferent things as  
£ might be ſaid to all the vw *orld ?  
  
  
C707  
  
If this is the caſe at all times with the confidential inter-  
courſe of friends, in times of party violence, there muſt  
be a thouſand things ſaid in letters, which, though inno-  
cent in themſelves, either by rival malice or party preju-  
dice, may be turned to a very different conſtruction. Theſe  
letters themſelves have been diſtorted in this manner; and  
ſome expreſſions in them cannot poſſibly be underſtood,  
without knowing the corretpondent letters, to which they  
refer. And when a factious party had got poſſeſſion of  
the town meetings, and led the aſſembly into what eſolu-  
tions they pleaſed, and were watching for any pretence to  
abuſe and inſult their GoWWnors, is it at all to be wonder-  
ed that they did not wiſh to have the contents of their let-  
  
ters told to their enemies?  
When we rcad in theſe letters ſuch paſſages as theſe:  
  
elf there be no neceſſity for it, I think it would be beſt  
« jt Hould, not be known that this intelligence comes  
from me.” Or this: “ have wrote with freedom, in  
« e of my name&#x27;s not being uſed on the occaſion.  
For though I have wrote nothing but what, in my con-  
„ ſcience, I think an American may, upon juſt principles,  
advance, and what a ſervant of the crown ought, upon  
all proper occaſions, to ſuggeſt; yet the many preju-  
«© dices I have to combat with, may render it unfit it  
* ſhould be made public.” Or this of Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s :  
„ muſt beg the favour of you to keep ſecret every thing  
cc I write, antil we are in a more ſettled ſtate, for the  
„party here, either by their agent, or by ſome of their  
© emiſſaries in London, have ſent them every report or  
«© rumour of the contents of letters wrote from hence. 1  
«* hope we ſhall ſee better times both here and in Eng-  
„land.“ Or this again of Mr. Oliver&#x27;s : © I have wrote  
e with freedom; I conſider I am writing tn a fro 3 and  
&lt;« that I am perfectly ſafe in opening u »elf to you.” Upon  
reading theſe paſſages, which are all of this kind, a man,  
whoſe heart was calt | in the common mould of humanity,  
would  
  
&quot;T 7 ]  
  
would have hoon apt to ſay : Theſe are letters irregularly  
  
obtained: The writers deſire that every thing they write  
ſhould be kept ſecret : they belong to Mr. Whately, who  
never injured me: I will therefore return them to the  
right owner. Dr. Franklin&#x27;s reaſoning is of a very diffe-  
rent caſt. After having juſt before told us: Theſe are  
  
  
purpoſes, and therefore I have a right to betray them; he  
now ſays, theſe are letters which the writers defire may  
be kept ſecret, and therefore I will fend them to their ene-  
mies. Prepared on both ſides for his rival&#x27;s overthrow,  
he makes that an argument for doing him hurt, which  
any other man would conſider as a principal —  
  
of the injuſtice of it.  
But, if the defiring ſecrecy be the proof, and the mea-  
  
ſure of guilt, what then are we to think of Dr. Franklin&#x27;s  
| caſe? whoſe whole conduct in this affair has been fecret  
and myſterious ? and who, through the whole courſe of it,  
  
  
Lords, my accounts ſay, that when theſe letters were ſent  
over to Boſton, ſo very deſirous was Dr. Franklin of fe-  
crecy, that he did not chuſe to ſet his name to the letter  
which acco:; panied them. This anonymous letter ex-  
preſsly ordered, that it ſhould be ſhewn to none but to a  
junto of fix perſons. If the Doctor chuſe it, I wil! name  
the ſix. The direction of every letter was eraſed, and  
ſtrict orders were given, that they ſhould be carefully re-

neſt deſire of concealment. Under theſe myſterious cir-  
cumſtances have the Aſſembly paſſed their cenſures; and

liberty to ſuppoſe the worſt ; I would wiſh to ſuggeſt the  
beſt. One cafe only muſt be excepted; Dr. Franklin will  
not add another injury, and ſay to the repreſentative * of

to the perfidy. And yet, my Lords, nothing but that con-

much leſs give him a _ to apply them to ſo unwarranta-

My Lords, there is no end of this e [ have now  
in my hand an expoſtulatory letter from a Mr. Roome, not  
a native of America, but ſent from London to Rhode Iſland,  
to collect in and ſue for large outſtanding debts there.  
This poor man, in a familiar letter to a friend in the ſame _  
  
  
met with in executing his truſt, from the iniquitous ten-  
dency of their laws, and of the proceedings of their courts,  
  
  
invitation to come and ſpend ſome time with him at his  
country houſe, and catch perch and be of their fiſhing  
party. For this letter, the Aſſembly brought him under  
examination, and committed him to priſon, becauſe he  
would not anſwer to his printed name at the end of one of  
the letters in this book f. Upon this occaſion he writes a  
letter to one of his employers, with whom he had ſerved his  
_ clerkſhip here in London, expoſtulating on the cruelty  
and injuſtice of the executors ſuffering their dead brother”;  
papers to be applied to ſuch a purpoſe. For he, my Lords,

| uſe of letters which did not belong to him. Mr. Roome  
had heard that the Boſton. letters had all been ſent back  
again to London; and knew that their Speaker was directed  
to procure his original letter, in order to their proceeding =  
  
  
with this letter to a friend of Mr. Whately&#x27;s defiring that  
he would go with him to Mr. Whately, and join in intreat-  
ing him, not to ſend back the letter to their Speaker, which  
would oblige him, he writes, either to fly the province, or.  
elſe to ſuffer a long impriſonment. My Lords, Mr.  
Whately&#x27;s friend had ſeen too much of the anguiſh of mind  
under which he had bcen ſuffering for the five months ſince  
this diſcovery. He knew that it would be giving him  
another ſtab to ſuffer a ſtranger abruptly to put this letter  
into his hands; he informed the merchant of the ſtate of  
the affair, and prevented his going to him. |  
But what had this poor man done to Dr Franklin, that  
is letter ſhould be ſent back too? Mr. Hutchinſon and  
Mr. Oliver were public perſons, and their letters, accord-  
ing to the Doctor&#x27;s new code of morality, may be a law-  
ful prize: but Mr Roome&#x27;s is a name we had never heard |  
of. Was he too a man in a public ſtation? his friend, to  
whom he ſent this invitation to come a fiſhing with him,  
was ie a public perſon? could Mr. Roome, when he was  
writing to New London, imagine that he was writing a  
letter to be ſhewn to the King? and to alienate his affecti-  
ons from that loyal people? Did the failing of the four  
_ regiments to Boſton depend upon the intelligence of a man  
at Narraganſett ? the writer of this letter could not have a  
5 thought of its producing public meaſures—Surely then the  
returning of this letter might have been omitted; and this  
Poor man at leaſt might have been ſpared. But all men,

Py  
own ; and then that Dr. Franklin ſhould be that agent.  
My Lords, the party by whom the Aſſembly is now direct- |  
ed, did not want a man who ſhould think himſelf bound  
in duty to conſult for the peace and harmony of the whole  
government; they had their own private ſeparate views,  
and they wanted an agent of their own, who ſhould be a  
willing inſtrument and inſtructor in the accompliſhing =  
their own ſeparate purpoſes. Dr. Franklin threfore, your  
Lordſhips fee, not only moves in a different orbit from  
that of other colony Agents, but he gravitates alſo to a ve-  
ry different center. His great point appears to be to ſerve  
  
  
leaders of it with the neceſſary intelligence. Wherefoever :  
and howſoever he can lay his hands on them, he thinks  
  
  
  
variance the different branches of the 8 and to  
  
  
incenſe the mother country againſt her colenies.  
here is a certain ſteadineſs which is ſingularly — |  
ble in this caſe. Theſe men are perpetually offering every  
kind of inſult to the Engliſh nation. Setting the King&#x27;s  
authority at defiance; treating the parliament as uſurpers  
of an authority not belonging to them, and flatly denying  
the ſupreme juriſdiction of the Britiſh empire: and have  
been publiſhing their votes and reſolutions for this purpoſe;  
and yet now pretend a great concern about theſe letters, as  
having a tendency to incenſe the parent ſtate againſt the  
colony. | Not content with bidding defiance to our autho-  
rity, they now offer inſult to our underſtanding: and at  
  
  
would have him turn out his Governor, becauſe he has in  
the mildeſt terms intimated his opinion, that they do not  
pay the reverence, they uſed to do, to the Britiſh autho-  
  
  
.  
My Lords: we are perpetually told of men&#x27;s incenſin  
the mother country againſt the colonies, of which I have  
never known a ſingle inſtance: but we hear noth:ng of the  
vaſt variety of arts, which have been made uſe of to incenſe  
the colonies againſt the mother country. And in all theſe.  
arts no one I fear has been a more ſucceſsful proficient, than  
the very man who now ſtands forth as Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s  
accuſer. My Lords, as he has been pleaſed in his own  
letter to avow this accuſation, I ſhall now return the charge  
and ſhew to your Lordſhips, who it is that is the true  
incendiary, and who is the great abetter of that fac-  
tion at Boſton, which, in form of a committee of correſ-  
pondence, have been inflaming the whole e againſt :  
his Majeſty&#x27;s government.  
My Lords, the language of Dr. Franklin 3 PORT I cor-  
reſpondents i is very well known. For years paſt they have  
deen boaſting of the countenance, which he receives in  
England, and the encouragement, which he ſends over to  
them at Boſton. One of their laſt boaſted advices was:  
Go on, abſtain from violence, but go on; for you have | |  
nothing to fear from the government here.  
My Lords, from the exceſs of their zeal, theſe men are  
| apt ſometimes to let out a little too much. In the Boſton |  
Gazette of the 20th of September laſt is a letter, under-  
ſtood at Boſton to have been written by Mr. Adams, one  
of Dr. Franklin&#x27;s ſix conſtituents*, which ends with the  
following paſſage.—** The late agent Mr. De Bert in one  
of his letters wrote, that Lord Hillſborough profeſſed a  
= great regard, for the intereſt of America, and he thought  
  
*  
  
* This Gentleman was the manager of the diſcovery of  
Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s letters in the Aſſembly; az ; Mr. Bowdoin,  
mother of the ſix, was in the Council.  
  
  
180  
cc the only thing that could be done to ſerve us, was to keep  
c the matter of right cut ſigit: The profeſſed deſign of  
cc that miniſter it ſeems was to ſerve us. But America has  
. not yet thought it wiſe to agree to his Lordſhips political  
« plan, to wink their liberties out of ſight, for the ſake of  
% temporary accommodation.” Dr. Franklin, who is  
perhaps as penetraling a genius as his Lordſhip, extended  
© his views a little farther. I hope, ſays he in a letter  
dated in 1771, „ the colony aſſemblies will ſhow by  
© repeated reſolves, that they know their rights, and do  
© mot loſe fight of them. Our growing importance will ere  
| © long compel an acknowledgment of them, and eſtabliſh  
and ſecure them to our poſterity . And he adds, I pur-  
poſe to draw up a memorial ſtating our rights and grievances  
  
  
particularly againſt the late innovations Whether ſpeedy  
© redreſs is or is not the conſequence, I imagine it may  
  
  
have not given up the conteſted points.“ ** It ſeems to  
© have been the judgment of this great man, that a ſtate of  
© rights ſhould accompany a complaint of grievances z and  
that decent and manly proteſts againſt particular inno-  
 &lt; vations, have the ſureſt tendency to an effectual, f not  
&lt; a ſpeedy removal of them.“  
  
| Your Lordſhips will be pleaſed to e the time of  
Dr. Franklin&#x27;s anouncing his intention of drawing up for  
them ſuch a memorial, was in 1771 At the proper ſeaſon  
in the next year, there was produced a great work under  
theſe very heads of a ſtate of rights, and a ſtate of griev-  
ances, and proteſts againſt the new innovations: but not  
from the preſs in London, that would not have anſwered.

half of the province; and therefore was firſt to be ſeni  
thither, and receive the {ſtamp of their authorities. A  
town meeting therefore was called, and a committee of  
correſpondence choſen, to draw up a ſtate of their rights  
and grievances, and from the form of the reſolution it is  
pretty manifeſt, that the leaders knew already what the  
work was to be. After an adjournment the committee  
met, and produced this great twelve-penny book, under  
the very heads of a ſtate of their rights, and containing a  
liſt of their grievances, with remonſtrances ſufficiently  
| ſtrong againſt what they call Innovations. The work  
was received with the utmoſt applauſe, and inſtantly con-  
verted into votes and reſolutions of the town of Boſton.  
And doubtleſs it well deferved it  
drawn heads of a declaration for any one colony in Ameri-  
ca, or any one diſtant county in the kingdom, which ſhall  
cChuſe to revolt from the Britiſh empire, and ſay that they  
  
  
minſter. They therefore voted that this report of their  
committee of correſpondence ſhould be printed in a pam-  
- Phlet, and that ſix hundred copies of them ſhould be diſ-  
poſed of to the ſelect men of the towns of the province,  
with an inflammatory letter, ſounding an alarm of a plan of |  
 deſpotiſm, with which the Adminiſtration (and the parlia-  
ment) intended to enſlave them; and threatened them with  
certain and inevitable de -flruftim: And deſiring that they  
would call town-meetings, and fend their votes and reſolu—  
tions upon this book. In 60 or 70 villages or townſhips  
ſuch meetings had been held: And all exprets the higheſt _  
approbation &#x27;of this excellent pertormance. And well they  
might; for it told them a hundred rights of which they  
never had heard before, anda hundred grievances which they  
never before had felt. Your Lordſhips ſee the votes and  
inſtructions of theſe ſeveral townſhips, in the Boſton ga-  
zettes here before me. They are full of the moſt extra-  
vagant abſurdities. Such as the enthuſiaſtic rants of the  
wildeſt of my countymen in Charles the 24&#x27;s days cannot

equal. It 15 impoſlible to read them to your Lordſhips:  
thoſe of Pembrok and of Marble-head are particularly  
curious: but I ſhall take thoſe of the town of Petertham.  
Reſolved, that the parliament of Great Britain, uſurp-  
ing and cxerciting a legiflative authority over, and ex-  
ec torting an untighteous revenue from theſe colonies, is a-  
«&lt; gainft all keike and human laws. The late appoint -  
ment of {alarics to be paid to our ſuperior Court Judges,  
« whoſe creation, pay, and commiſſion, depend on mere  
ill and pleature, complete a ſyſtem of bondage equal to  
T any ever before fabricated by the combined efforts of the  
„ jngenuity, malice, fraud, and wickedneſs of nan.  
„Therefore, Refolved, That it is the firſt and higheſt  
&amp; ſocial duty, of this people, to conſider of, and ſeek ways  
and means for a ſpeedy redreſs of theſe mighty grievan-  
* ances, and intolerable wrongs; and that for the obtain-  
  
  
„of God and nature, in the uſe of every rightful art, .  
*« energy of Policy, Stratagem, and Force.  
Therefore, it is our earneſt deſire, and we here direct  
  
7 you, to uſe your utmoſt influence (as one of the legiſſa-  
ative body) to convince the nation of Great-Britain, that  
  
c the meaſures that they have meted out to us, will have a  
&amp; chreCt tendency to deſtroy both them and us; and petiti- 85  
on the King, and parliament of Great-Britan, in the  
&quot;66 moſt pathe.1c and and ſtriking manner, to relieve us from  
our aggravated grievances ; but if all this ſhould fail, we  
  
recommend it to your conſideration, and direct you to  
« move it to the confideration of the honourable Court,  
&amp; whether it would not be beſt to call in the aid of ſome Prote-  
6 fant Power or Powers, requeſting that they would uſe  
« their kind and Chriſtian influence, with our mother  
6 country, that ſo we may be relieved, and that brotherly  
«love and harmony may again take place.” |  
Theſe are the leſſons taught in Dr. Franklin&#x27;s Check 5 5  
off litics. Aly Lords, do not fay that Dr. Franklin is the  
orig gina!  
  
bo ne  
  
original author of this book. But your Lordſhips wilt  
give me leave to obterve, in the firſt place, that it is not  
very likely, that any of the Doctor&#x27;s ſcholars at Bottor,  
ſhould attempt to drow up ſuch a ſtate of rights and griev-  
_ Unces, when the great man, their maſter, had given them  
notice that he ſhould himſelf ſct about ſuch a work: and,  
in the next place, that if the Doctor ſhould not chuſe now  
  
to filiate the child, yet the time has been when he was not  
  
aſhamed of it; for, after it had had its operation in Ame-  
  
| rica, the D er reprinted it here, with a preface of hi;  
  
_ own, and preſented it to his friends.  
My Lords, I have ſaid, that Ginny or ſeventy of the  
townſhips had already voted their approbation of the book.  
The evil was catching from town to town (and if the  
greater part could have been engaged, they would have  
forced the reſt) when the Governor thought it his duty  
to interpoſe. He therefore called upon the Aſſembly to  
diſown theſe undutitul proceedings. Had he only men-  
tioned the diſloyalty and evil tendency of them, they would  
probably have paſſed a few reſolutions, and have ſuffered  
the evil to go on. He was well aware, that the Aſſembly  
Could eaſily vote themſelves as many privileges as they  
Pleaſed, but that it was not ſo caſy to prove their right wo  
them. He, therefore, diſarmed them of their ſtrength in  
voting, and put them under the neceſſity of proving ; and  
there he knew they would fail. By opening the ſeſſion  
with that very maſterly ſpeech in defence of the Britith  
American conſtitution, he, for a time, ſtunned the faction,  
and gave a check to the progreſs of their Town-\Mleetings.  
And though the ſame men were in the Aſfembly created a  
Committee of Correſpondence, to write to the Aſſemblics  
of the other provinces, yet the ſpirit of the deſign languiſh-  
ed, and but little more was then done im it.  
  
This, my Lords, is the great and principal ground of  
their quarrel with Mr. Hutchinſon. They want a Go-  
vernor, who ſhall know leſe than themſelves, w hereas he  
  
= | make:  
  
  
makes them feel that he knows more. He ſtopped the train  
Which Dr. Franklin&#x27;s conſtituents had laid, to blow up the  
province into a flame, wh h trom thence was tv Have ben  
&#x27; ſpread over the other provinces. This was the real provo- -  
cation: and for this they have been leeking for ſome h  
of accuſation againſt him.  
After ſifting his u hole conduQ for the fur years, in  
which he has been governo, they are not able to point out  
a ſingle action to find fault with. Their only recourle is  
to their own ſurmiſes of what were the ſentuments © is  
heart five or fix years ago. He was, they ſay, among the  
inſtruments in introducing a fleet and army into the prov.nce.—  
Have they attempted any proot of this? No. But they  
fancy it from ſome letters of his, which do not lay a fingle  
word of that fort. Is it poſſible to conceive of a more  
groundleſs accuſation, or not to ſee their intent in it?  
My Lords, they mean nothing more by this Addreſs,  
than to fix a ſtigma on the Governor by the acculation.  
Their charge, founded upon a pretence of knowing ſix  
years ago, what were Mir. Hutchinion&#x27;s thoughts, is not  
really deſigned for his Majeſty in Council. They know  
that your Lordſhips will not take an accuſation for a proof;  
nor condemn without evidence. They never defired to  
be brought to a hearing: and therefore the firſt inſtant  
  
  
ſay they do not mean this as a charge, or a trial before  
your Lordthips; and they ſay truly: they meant to bring  
it before the multitude, and to addreſs the popular preju-  
dices. The mob, they know, need only hear their Go-  
  
vernors accuſed, and they will be ſure to condemn. My  
Lords, they boaſt at Boſton, that they have found this  
method ſucceed againſt their laſt Governor, and they hope  
to make it do againſt this; and by a ſecond precedent to  
eſtabliſh their power, and make all future Governors tow.  
to their authority. They wiſh to erect themtetves into a  
tyranny greater than the Roman : 10 be able, fitting in  
  
  
1  
  
their own ſecret cabal, to dictate for the Aſſembly, and fend  
awav their ve ofa et grandis er iſtola, and get even a v  
ous de. f dragged from his ſeat, and made the ſport of  
a Bef on nob. | |  
Having turned out all ch Governors; they x may at  
length hope to get one of their own. he letters from  
| Boſton, for two years paſt, have intimated that Dr. Frank-  
lin was aiming at Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s government. It was  
not eaſy before this to give credit to ſuch ſurmiſes: but no-  
thing urcly but a too eager attention to an ambition of this  
fort, could have vetrayed a wiſe man into ſuch a conduct  
as we have now ſeen. | Whether theſe ſurmiſes are true or  
not, your Lordſhips are much the beſt judges. If they  
ſhould be true, I hope that Mr. Hutchinſon will not meet  
with the lets countenance from your Lordſhips, for his  
| RivaPsbeing his accuſer. Nor will your Lordſhips, I truſt,  
from what yuu have heard, adviſe the having Mr. Hutch- |  
inſon diſplaced, | in order to make room tor Dr. Franklin 8  
0 ſucceſſor, 5 |  
With regard to his 1 the bien leaders at  
Boſton, who n ake this complaint againſt their Governor;  
if the relating of their evil doings be criminal, and tending  
to alienate his Mijeſty&#x27;s affections, muſt not the doing of  
them be much more ſo? Yet now they aſk that his Ma-  
jeſty will gratify and reward them for doing thet2 things;  
and that he will puniſh their Governor for relating them,  
becauſe they are ſo very bad that it cannot but offend his  
Majeſty to hear of them. -  
My Lords, if the account, given in theſe letters, of their  
proceedings, five years ago, tended to alienate his Majeſty&#x27;s  
affe ctions, has their corduct ever ſince been in any reſpect  
more conciliating? was it to confute or prevent the per-  
nicious effect of theſe letters, that the good men of Boſton  
have lately held their meetings, appointed their Committees,  
and with their uſual moderation deſtroyed the cargo of  
three Britiſh ſhips? If an Engliſh Conſul, in any part of  
55 e f France  
  
B  
Prance or Spain, or rather Algiers or Tripoli, (for Euro-  
pcan powers reſpect the law of nations) had not called this  
an outraue on his country, he would have deferved puniſh-  
ment. But if a Governor at Boſton ſhould preſume to  
| whiſper to a friend, that he thinks it ſomewhat more than  
a a moderate exertion of Engliſh liberty, to deſtroy the ſhips |  
of England, to attack her officers, to plunder their goods,  
to pull down their houſes, or even to burn the King&#x27;s ſhips  
of war, he ought to be removed; becauſe ſuch a conduct  
in him has a natural and effic 5 tendency to interrupt the  
harmony between Great Britain and the colony, which theſe  
good ſubjeQs are ſtriving by ſuch means to eſtabliſh  
On the part of Mr. Hutchinſon and Mr. Oliver, I am  
inſtructed to aſſure your Lordſhips, that they feel no ſpark  
of reſentment, even at the individuals who have done  
them this injuſtice. Their private letters breathe nothing  
but moderation. They are convinced that the people,  
though miſled, are innocent. If the conduct of a few  
ſhould provoke a juſt indignation, they would be the moſt  
forward, and, I truſt the moſt efficacious ſolicitors to avert  
its effects, and to excuſe the men. They love the ſoil,  
| the conſtitution, the people of New-England ; they look  
with reverence to this country, and with affection to that.  
  
  
anarchy aboliſhed, and government re-eſtabliſhed : but  
theſe ſalutary ends they wiſh to promote by the gentleſt  
means; and the abridging of no liberties, which a people  
can poſſibly uſe to its own advantage. A reſtraint from  
ſelf- deſtruction is the only reſtraint they deſire 1 to be im-  
5 poſed upon Neu England. |  
  
My Lords, I have ſaid that the letter, which accompa-  
nied theſe in queſtion, was anonymous, and that it was di—  
rected to be ſhown to ſix perſons only.

of this people, for the laſt ten years, and  
ſbewn what has been the behaviour of Mr.  
  
  
occaſion for the good of the colony; I now  
come to conſider the argument upon that foot-  
  
  
to place it.  
They have read to your Lordſhips the Aſſem-  
bly&#x27;s addreſs ; they have read the letters; and  
  
  
who complain againſt them.  
  
  
1 786  
My Lords, This is ſo very extraordinary a  
_ proceeding, that I know of no precedent, except  
one : but that, I confeſs, according to the Ro-  
man poet&#x27;s report, is a caſe i in point.

My Lords, The only purport of this agbe?  
tant addreſs is, that the Governor and Lieute-  
nant- Governor have loſt the confidence of the  
  
people, upon account of ſome papers, which:  
they have voted to be unfriendly to them, and  
that they have been amongſt the chief inftrunitnts i in  
  
introducing a fleet and army into the province. —  
Your Lordſhips have heard the letters read, and  
  
are the beſt judges of their tendency. J can  
appeal to your Lordſhips, that it was not theſe  
—_— but their own it conduct, which made  
  
it neceſſary to order the four regiments. In  
point of time it was impoſſible: for in Mr.  
Hutchinſon&#x27;s very firſt letter, it appears, that  
  
they had an expectation of troops. And they  
arrived in three months after. I could appeal  
  
too to their own knowledge: for the printed  
collection of Sir Francis Bernard&#x27;s and General  
  
Gage&#x27;s, &amp;c. letters were before them, Which  
e ſhew the direct contrary.  
  
But :  
  
1 39 J  
  
But as my learned friends have not attempted  
  
to point out the demerits of theſe letters, I need  
not enter into the defence of them. To call  
them only innocent letters, would be greatly to  
depreciate them, They contain the ſtrongeſt  
proofs of Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s good ſenſe, his great  
moderation, and his ſincere regard to&#x27;the welfare  
of that his native province. Yet, for theſe it  
is, that they tell us he has loſt the confidence of  
the people. |  
  
My Lords, There cannot be : a more ſtriking  
inſtance of the force of truth, than what the  
Committee, who drew up theſe papers, exem-  
plify in their conduct. In their ſecond reſolu-  
tion, they acknowledge the high character, in  
which Mr. Hutchinſon: ſtands upon account of  
his eminent abilities. In the very outſet. of their  
addreſs, they acknowledge the good : u/e which  
he had made of thoſe abilities: for he could not  
  
  
heretofore did, if he had made a bad one. They  
acknowledge that this confidence ſubſiſted, at  
leaſt till the time of his being made Governor.  
Elſe they could not expreſs their thankfulneſs to  
his Majeſty as they do, and applaud the appoint-  
ment of him, as proceeding from the . mo-  
tives of rendering his ſubjetts happy.  
  
In the heighth of their ill will 5  
  
to Mr. Hutchinſon, truth looks his enemies

full in the face, and extorts from them a con-  
feſſion of his merit, even in the a  
l AY das: ic ©  
But, whatever be the caſh: which the  
Aſſembly may have been induced to paſs on him,  
I will now give your Lordſhips a proof of his  
enjoying the people&#x27;s confidence, to. the ay  
time of the arrival of theſe letters. |  
- Every one knows that there are bew ſubjects,  
in which the people of the colonies Have more  
eagerly intereſted themſelves, than in ſettling the  
boundary lines between the ſeveral provinces.  
Some of your Lordſhips may remember the  
long hearings which have been held at this Board  
upon theſe diſputes. Of late, they have taken  
upon themſelves to fix the limits of the King&#x27;s  
charters. An agreement was made between the  
two Aſſemblies of New York and Maſſachuſett&#x27;s  
Bay, that they ſhould each appoint their Com-  
miſſaries, to meet and ſettle the boundary line  
between the two provinces. Both of them no  
doubt looked out for the beſt men they had for  
that purpoſe. But the people of Maſſachu-  
ſett&#x27;s Bay, after they had choſen their commiſſa-  
ries, ſtill thought that they could more ſecurely  
truſt their intereſts in their hands, if Mr. Hutch-  
inſon would go along with them. To him they  
Had been uſed to look, as the man, who beſt knew  
the hiſtory of their firſt ſettlements ; him they  
conſidered as the ableſt defender of the province&#x27;s  
9 1 5 rights:  
  
  
the preſervation of them. But they did not  
dare to ſet their faces againſt the general ſenſe of  
  
  
queſted to go with the Commiſſaries. He did  
| fo, and ſettled for them a much better line, than  
they had ever expected. And the New York  
and their own Commiſſaries both of them ac-  
knowledged, that the advantage gained to the  
province, was chiefly owing to the ſuperior  
knowledge and abilities of Mr. Hutchinſon.  
  
  
fore be the foundation of this Addreſs for his  
removal, it muſt be ſomething done by him, or  
known of him, ſince his return from this ſervice  
juſt before the arrival of theſe letters. Your  
  
  
  
  
dreſs reſts upon the foundation of theſe letters,  
  
  
which the Aſſembly. now aſk their removal.  
  
They owe therefore all the ill will which has

confidence, which the Aſembly&#x27; themſelves ac-  
knowledge they had heretofore inj joyed, to Dr.  
Franklin&#x27;s good office in ſending back theſe”  
letters to Boſton. Dr. Franklin therefore ſtands  
  
  
Mazeſty&#x27;s two Governors; and having by the  
Help of his own ſpecial confidents and party” |  
leaders, firſt made the Aﬀembly bis Agents &quot;m  
carrying on his own ſecret deſigns, he now ap-  
pears before your Lordſhips to give the pet  
ſtroke to the work of his own hands.  
  
Hoy theſe letters came into the poſſeſſion of  
any one but the right owners, is ſtill a myſtery  
for Dr. Franklin to explain.— They who know  
the affectionate regard which the Whatelys had  
for each other, and the tender concern they fen  
for the honour of their brother&#x27;s memory, as  
well as their own, can witneſs the diſtreſſes  
which this oecaſioned. My Lords, the late  
Mr. Whately was moſt ſcrupulouſly cautious -  
about his letters. We lived for many years in  
the ſtricteſt intimacy and in all thoſe years 1  
never ſaw a ſingle letter written to him. Theſe ©  
letters I believe were in his cuſtody at his death.  
And I as firmly believe, that without fraud,”  
they could not have been got out of the cuſtody  
of the perſon whoſe: hands they fell into. His  
brothers little wanted this additional aggravation

their brother&#x27;s honour and their own, they en-  
quired; gave to the parties aggrieved all the  
information in their power; but never accuſed.  
Lour Lordlhips. know the train of miſchiefs  
which followed. — But wherein had my late

My Lords, if there be any thing held facred  
in the intercourſe of mankind, it is their private  
letters of friendſhip—If there can be any ſuch  
private letters, thoſe which paſſed between the  
late Mr. Whately and Mr. Oliver are ſuch— The  
friendſhip between the two families is of thirty  
years ſtanding - during all that time there has  
been kept up an intercourſe of letters ; firſt with  
Mr. Whately, the father, and then with the late  
Mr. Thomas Whately, the ſon—In the courſe  
of this friendſhip, a variety of good offices have  
paſſed between the two families: one of theſe  
fell within - the period of theſe letters — Upon  
Mr. Oliver&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s coming to England with  
her huſband upon buſineſs, they. were received  
at Nonſuch by Mrs. Whately and her ſons, as the  
ſon and daughter of their old friend and cor.  
reſpondent —And accordingly your Lordſhips  
will find, that one part of theſe letters is to return  
thanks for the civilities ſhewn to Mr. and Mrs,  
Spooner at Nonſuch. .  
  
Theſe are the letters which Dr. F 155  
treats as public letters, and has thought proper  
to ſecrete them for his own private purpoſe.  
How he got at them, or in whoſe hands they  
were at the time of Mr, Whately&#x27;s death, the  
Doctor has not yet thought proper to tt us.  
Till he do, he wittingly leaves the- world at  
  
5 t 8 1  
  
5 liberty to conjecture about them as they .  
and to reaſon upon thoſe conjectures.— But let  
the letters have been lodged where they may,  
from the houf of Mr. Thomas Whately&#x27;s death,  
  
  
the Whately family. Dr. Franklin could not  
but know this, and that no one had a right to  
  
  
ceœͤivers of goods diſhonourably come by, may  
_ plead as a pretence for keeping them, that

. Gentlemen of integrity, 4 their family plate or

a private letter, it will he neceſſary that eyery

for, after this, there never can he wanting a pre  
tence for making them public .. 1255  
But ſays the Doctor, 40 7 bey. were written by  
« &lt; odd officers.” Can then a man in a public  
ſtation have no private friends ?and,;write 1no |  
private letters? Will Dr. Franklin avow;the  
principle, that he has a right to make all private  
letters of your Lordſhips his on, and to apply  
them to ſuch uſes as will beſt anſwer the pur-  
  
poſes of party malevolence ?, Whatever may

.  
ac üanbed with our hiſtory, not to know, that  
Mr. Whately, during both theſe years, and for  
two years before and after, was only a private  
  
Member of Parliament; z and, as Mr. Oliver  
  
juſtly. &quot;obſerves in a letter of his, They at Boſton  
could not be ſuppoſed to apply to him as having an  
| intereſt with the Mi niſters, when they knew that he  
as all that time voting in oppoſition to them. ©  
  
Does then the Doctor mean, that his being  
a Member of Parliament placed him in a  
public ſtation?—And will he then avow, that a&#x27;  
Gentleman&#x27;s being in Parliament is ground fuf-  
ficient for him to make his letters lawful plun-  
der, and to ſend them to his enemies ? |  
  
But they were written on public affairs. A  
very grievous offence! But it is a crime, of  
which probably we all of us have been guilty,  
and ought not, ſurely, for that only, to | forfeit  
the common rights of humanity.  
  
But they were intended to procure public 1 mea--  
ſures. And does not every man, who writes in  
confidence to his friend upon political ſubjects,  
Tament any thing which he&#x27;thinks to. be wrong,  
and wiſh to have it amended? And is this the  
crime of ſo heinous a nature, as to put Mr.  
Whately* s friends out of the common protection?  
and to give to Dr. Franklin a right to hang  
them up to party rage, and to expoſe them, for  
what he knew, to the danger of having their  
  
houſes :  
  
| 3. 1 +  
| houſes 2 ſecond time pull&#x27;d down a by popula 8  
fury.  
But the writers ; of thaw Aired es Ts. |  
they did ſo. And what man is there, who, when  
he is writing in confidence, does not wiſh fot the  
fame thing ? Does not every man ſay things to a  
friend, which he would not chuſe to have pub-  
liſhed to other people, and much leſs to his  
enemies? Would letters of friendſhip vs letters of  
  
  
- different things as might be ſaid to all the world?  
  
If this. is the caſe at all times with the confi-  
dential intercourſe of friends, in times of party-  
violence, there muſt be a thouſand things faid  
in letters, which, though innocent in themſelves,  
either by rival malice or party prejudice, may  
be turned to a very different conſtruction. Theſe  
letters themſelves have been diſtorted in this  
manner; and ſome expreſſions in them cannot  
poſſibly. be underſtood, without knowing the  
correſpondent letters, to which they refer. And  
  
  
Town meetings, and led the Aſſembly into  
| what reſolutions they pleaſed, and were watch-  
ing for any pretence to abuſe and inſult their  
Governors, is it at all to be wondered, that  
they did not wiſh to have the contents ad their  
letters told to their enemies ?  
  
When we read in. theſe letters ſuch ſites  
as theſe : «+ if there be no * for it, I think  
  
&amp;« it  
  
CWP -  
ts. jt, would be beſt it ſhould not be knowh that  
this intelligence cames from me.“ Or this!  
have wrote with freedom, in ebnfidence of  
my name&#x27;s not being uſed on the occaſion,  
Fer though IL have wrote nothing but What;  
in my cunſcience, I think an American may:  
&amp; upon juſt principles, advance, and what a  
&amp;-ſervant of the:crown ought; upon all proper  
* occaſions, to ſuggeſt; yet the many prejudices  
„ have to combat with, may render it unfit  
it ſhould be made public.“ Or this of Mr.  
Hutchinſon&#x27;s : .I maſt beg the favour of you  
* to keep. ſedret every thing I write, until we  
are in a more ſettled ſtate, for the party here,  
either by their Agent, or by ſome of their  
« .emiflaries in London, have ſent them every  
5. xeport or rumour of the contents of letters  
rote from hence: I hope we ſhall fee better  
1 times both hert and in England.“ Or this  
again of Mr. Oliver&#x27;s: . I hate wrote wwith free-  
% dom; I conſider I am wiiting ta a friend; and  
«-zbat T ans perfetthy ſaft in opening myſelf to you.”  
Upon reading theſe paſſages, which are all there  
are of this kind, a man, whoſe heart was caſt  
in the common mould of humanity, would  
bave been apt to ſay: Theſe are letters irregu-  
larly obtained : The writers deſire that every  
thing they write ſhould be kept ſecret : they be-  
1. e n who never injured me: I  
N | will

will therefore return them to the right owner:  
Dr. Franklin&#x27;s reaſoning is of à very different  
 eaſt;” After having juſt before told us: Theſe are  
public lettertz ſent to public perſons, deſigned for  
public purpoſes, and therefore I have a right to  
betray them ; be now ſays, theſe are letters which  
che writers deſire may be kept ſecret, | and-there-  
fore I will ſend them to their enemies. Prepared  
on both ſides for his rival&#x27;s overthrow, he makes  
that an argument for doing him hurt, which any  
other man would conſider as e ra-  
vation of the injuſtice of it.  
But, if the deſiring Gan 3 and  
the meaſure of guilt, what then are we to think  
of Dr. Franklin&#x27;s cafe ? whoſe whole conduct in  
this affair has been ſecret” and myſterious ? and  
who, through the whole courſe of it; has diſco-  
  
Lords, My accounts ſay, that when theſe letters  
were ſent over to Boſton; ſo very deſirous was Dr.  
Franklin of ſecrecy, that be did not chuſe to

them. This anonymous letter expreſsly ordered,  
that it ſhould; be ſhewn to none but to a junto of

„This Dr. Franklin may «call 83 the

But the courſe taken with theſe letters was juſt  
  
  
Few? was eee ; thaughs the hand was well  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
known : too well perhaps k non to the ſelected  
  
it. Since therefore the Doctor has told us that he  
tranſmitted theſe letters to his conſtituents, we  
know now who they are. His conſtituents, by his  
pwn account, muſt be this particular junto : for  
to them, and them any, were the letters commu-  
nicated. Dr. Franklin did not communicate  
them, as their agent, to the Aſſembly : For  
whatever may have been the whiſpers of this  
  
  
to this day know by whom the letters were ſent.  
And fo little do theſe innocent well-meaning  
farmers, which compoſe the bulk of the Aſſem-

of theſe leaders, they have been brought to vote

counts ſay, that it did not appear to the Houle -  
that theſe letters had ever been in London.  
I have pointed out to your Lordſhips, the  
  
  
verhor was conducted, with all its circumſtances,  
as the letters from Boſton relate them. &quot;And from  
  
that  
  
  
that I conſider Dr. Franklin not ſo much in the  
light of an agent for the Aſſembly&#x27;s purpoſe,  
as in that of a firſt mover and prime conductor  
of it for his on; not as the Aſſembly&#x27;s agent  
for avenging this dreadful conſpiracy of Mr.  
Hutchinſon againſt his native country; but as  
the aftor and ſecret” ſpring, by which. all the  
Aſſembly&#x27;s motions were directed: the inventor |  
and firſt planner of the whole contrivance. &quot;He  
it was that received and ſent away Mr. Whate-

us at liberty to ſuppoſe the worſt ; I would wiſh

the perfidy. And yet, my Lords, nothing but  
that conſent could put him honourably i in poſ-  
  
  
to apply them to ſo unwarrantable a purpoſe. /  
  
My Lords, there is no end of this miſchief.  
  
I have now in my hand an expoſtulatory letter

than what any other Colony Agent would have  
p dne. He happened only to be the firſt ©. | |  
&#x27; lony Agent who laid his hands « on them, and he  
thought it his duty to + roanſmir them to his =  
conſtituents. |  
My Lords, 1 have the peil of el  
ſeveral very reſpectable Gentlemen, who have  
been Colony Agents, and cannot but feel a little  
concern at ſeeing this ſtrange imputation caſt on  
&quot;that character. I have heard the fentiments of  
. ſome of them. Upon being aſked, whether, if.  
they had laid their hands upon another Gentle-  
man&#x27;s letters, they would have thought it their  
duty to make a like uſe of them: My Lords,  
they received the propoſal with horror. One of  
J them ſaid, it was profaning the word Duty to  
apply it to ſuch a purpoſe; another, that if he  
had been their Agent, he would ſooner have 1  
off his right hand than have done ſuch a thing. |  
My Lords, Dr. Franklin&#x27;s mind may have  
been fo poſſeſſed with the idea of a Great Ame-  
rican Republic, that he may eaſily ſlide into the  
language of the miniſter of a foreign indepen-  
dent ſtate“. A foreign Ambaſſador when reſiding  
here, juſt before the breaking out of a war, or  
upon particular occaſions, may bribe a villain to  
ow or ny any ſtate papers; he is under the

command of another ſtate, and is not amenable  
to the laws of the country where he reſides; and  
the ſecure exemption from puniſhment . in-  
duce a laxer morality.  
  
But Dr. Franklin, whatever he may wack the  
people at Boſton, while he is bere at leaſt is a  
lubject; and af a ſubject injure a ſubject, he  
is anſwerable to the law. And the Court of  
Chancery will not much attend to his new ſelf-  
created importance.  
  
But, my Lords, the k ! in ewhich Dr. F Franklin  
appears, is not even that of a Province Agent: he  
moves in a very inferior orbit. An Agent for a  
province, your Lord ſhips know, is a perſon choſen  
by the joint act of the Governor, Council, and  
Aſſembly; after which, a commiſſion is iſſued  
by the Secretary, under the province ſeal, ap-  
pointing him to that office. Such a real Colony  
Agent, being made by the joint concurrence of  
all the three branches of the Government, will  
think it his duty to conſult the joint ſervice of  
all the three; and to contribute all he can to  
the peace, harmony, and orderly government  
of the whole; as well as to the gencral welfare  
and proſperity of the province. This at leaſt is  
what I Jearn from the copy books of two Gen-  
tlemen, who at different periods were Agents for  
this very Colony. But Dr. Franklin&#x27;s appoint-  
ment ſeems to have been made an direct oppo-  
  
O 2 | ſition  
  
[ 160 J  
ſition to all theſe.” Upon a meſſage from tho  
  
Council to the Aſſembly, deſiring that they  
would join in the choice of an Agent for the  
Colony, they came to a reſolution, that they  
will not join with the Honourable Board in the  
choice of ſuch an Agent; but reſolve that they  
will chooſe: an Agent of their own; and then,  
that Dr. Franklin ſhould be that Agent. Mͤy  
Lords, the party by whom the Aſſembly is now  
directed, did not want a man who ſhould think  
himſelf. bound in duty to conſult for the peace  
and harmony of the whole government; they  
had their own private ſeparate views, and they  
wanted an agent of their own, who ſhould be a  
willing inſtrument and inſtructor in the accom-  
pliſhing their own ſeparate purpoſes. Dr. Frank-  
lin therefore, your Lordſhips ſee, not only moves  
in a different orbit from that of other Colony  
Agents, but he gravitates alſo to a very different  
center. His great point appears to be to ſerve  
the intereſt of his party; and privately to ſup-  
ply the leaders of it with the neceſſary intelli-  
gence. Whereſoever and howſoever he can lay  
his hands on them, he thinks it his duty to fur-  
niſh materials for diſſentions; to ſet at variance  
the different branches of the Legiſlature; and to

c Mr. De Bert in one of his letters wrote, that  
4 Lord Hillſborough profeſſed a great regard  
* for the intereſt of America; and he thought  
the only thing that could be done to ſerve us,  
e was to keep the matter of right out of fight. The  
* profeſſed aden of that miniſter it ſeems was to  
« ſerve us. But America has not yet thought it  
« wiſe to agree to his Lordſhip&#x27;s political plan,  
&amp; to wink their liberties out of ſight, for the  
« ſake of a temporary accommodation.“ Dr.  
Franklin, who is perhaps as penetrating a ge-  
© nius as his Lordſhip, extended his views a  
little farther. | I hope, ſays he, in a letter  
dated in 1771, the colony Aſſemblies will  
© ſhow by repeated reſolves, ibat they know their  
* rights, and do not loſe fight of them. Our  
* growing importance will ere long compel an  
« acknowledgment of them, and eſtabliſh and  
* ſecure them to our poſterity.” And he adds,  
I purpoſe to draw up a memorial fating otr  
© rights and grievances, and in the name and  
behalf of the province, proteſting particularly  
* againſt the late innovations Whether ſpeedy  
© redreſs is or is not the conſequence, I imagine  
it may be of good uſe to keep alive our claims,  
and ſhow that we have not given up the con-  
tr teſted points.” It ſeems to have been the  
  
« judgment of this great man, that à fate of  
rights ſhou&#x27;d accompany a complaint of grie-  
2 vances; and that decent and manly proteſts

Your Lordſhips will be pleaſed to Sllbfervs tire  
time of Dr. Franklin&#x27;s: announcing his intention  
of drawing up for them ſuch a memorial, Was  
in 1771. At the proper ſeaſon in the next year,  
there was produced a great work, under thefe  
very heads of a State of Rights, and a State of  
  
  
vations: But not from the preſs in London;  
  
  
was to be a memorial in the name and behalf of

a declaration for any one colony in America, or  
any one diſtant. county in the kingdom, which  
ſhall chuſe to fevolt from the Britiſh empire,  
and ſay that they will not be governed by the  
King and Parliament at Weſtminſter. They  
therefore voted that this report of their Com-  
mittee of Correſpondence ſhould be printed in a  
| pamphlet, and that ſix hundred copies of them  
ſhould be diſpoſed of to the ſelect men of the towns +  
of the province, with an inflammatory letter,  
ſounding an alarm of a plan of deſpotiſin, with  
which the Adminiſtration (and the Parliament)  
intended to enſiave them; and threatened them  
with certain and inevitable deſtruttion: And de-  
firing that they would call town- meetings, and  
ſend their votes and reſolutions upon this book.  
In 60 or 70 villages or townſhips ſuch meetings  
had been held: And all expreſs the higheſt  
approbation of this excellent performance. And  
well they might; for it told them a hundred  
rights, of which they never had heard before,  
and a hundred. grievances which they never  
before had felt. Your Lordſhips ſee the votes  
and inſtructions of theſe ſeveral townſhips, in the  
Boſton gazettes here before me. They are full  
of the moſt extravagant abſurdities. Such as  
the enthuſiaſtic rants of the wildeſt of my coun-  
  
trymen in Charles the 2d&#x27;s days cannot equal.  
is It

It is impoſſible to read them to your Lordſhips: 1  
Thoſe of Pembrok and of Marble-head are  
particularly curious : but I ſhall * thoſe of  
the town of Peterſham. |  
* Reſolved, That the Parliament of Gries  
66 Britain, uſurping, and exerciſing a legiſlative  
« authority over, and extorting an unrighteous  
revenue from theſe colonies, is againſt all  
divine and human laws. The late appoint-  
« ment of ſalaries. to be paid to our Superior  
* Court Judges, whoſe creation, pay, and com-  
&lt;« miſſion, depend on mere will and pleaſure,  
« complete a ſyſtem of bondage equal to any  
« ever before fabricated by the combined efforts  
« of the ingenuity, malice, fraud, and wick-  
« edneſs of man.  
„Therefore, Reſalyed, That it is the firſt  
and higheſt ſocial duty of this people, to  
«conſider of, and ſeek ways and means for a  
« ſpeedy redreſs of theſe mighty grievances and  
$ intolerable wrongs; and that for the obtain-  
«ment of this end, this people are &#x27; warranted,  
% by the laws of God and nature, in the uſe  
« of every rightful art, and energy of Policy,  
« Stratagem,. and Force.  
Therefore, it is our earneſt deſire, and  
e we here direct you, to uſe your utmoſt influ-  
« ence (as one of the legiſlative body) to con.  
«-yince the nation of Stent: Britain, that the  
  
  
L -167 ;]  
  
«. meaſures that they have meted out to us,  
« will have. a direct tendency to deſtroy both  
« them and us; and petition the King and Par-  
«-liament-of Great-Britain, in the moſt: pathe-  
«&#x27;tic- and ſtriking manner, to relieve us from  
our aggravated grievances; but if all this  
«ſhould fail, we recommend it to your conſi-  
« deration, and direct you to move it to the  
conſideration of the honourable Court,  
* hether it would not be beſt to call in the aid  
« of ſome Proteſtant Power: or Powers, requeſt-  
ing that they would uſe their kind and Chriſtian  
influence, with our mother country, that ſo  
+, we may be relieved, and that brotherly love  
“and harmony may again take place.”  
  
Theſe are the leſſons taught in Dr. F WT  
lin&#x27;s ſchool: of Politics. My Lords, I do. not  
ſay. that Dr. Franklin is the original author  
of this book. But your Lordſhips will give  
me leave to obſerve, in the firſt place, that  
it is not very likely, that any of the Doctor&#x27;s  
ſcholars at Boſton, ſhould: attempt to draw up  
ſuch a ſtate of rights and grievances, when the  
great man, their maſter, had given them notice  
that he ſhould himſelf ſet - about ſuch: a work:  
and, in the next place, that if the Doctor ſhould  
not chuſe now to filiate the child, yet the time  
has been when he was not aſhamed- of it; for,  
after it had had its operation in America, - the  
] F-2 Doctor  
  
  
  
own, and preſented it to his friends.  
My Lords, I have ſaid, that ſixty or ſeventy  
of the townſhips had already voted their appro-  
bation of the book. The evil was catching  
from town to town (and if the greater part  
could have been engaged, they would have  
forced the reſt) when the Governor thought it  
his duty to interpoſe. He therefore called upon  
the Aſſembly to diſown theſe undutiful proceed  
ings. Had he only mentioned the diſloyalty  
and evil tendency of them, they would pro-  
bably have paſſed a few reſolutions, and have  
ſuffered the evil to go on. He was well aware,  
that the Aſſembly could eaſily vote themſelves as  
many privileges as they pleaſed, but that it was  
not ſo eaſy to prove their right to them. He,  
therefore, diſarmed them of their ſtrength in vot-  
ing, and put them under the neceſſity of proving;  
and there he knew they would fail. By opening  
the ſeſſion with that very maſterly ſpeech in de-  
fence of the Britiſh American conſtitution, he,  
for a time, ſtunned the faction, and gave a  
check to the progreſs of their Town-Meetings.  
And though the ſame men were in the Aſſembly.  
created a Committee of Correſpondence, to  
write to the Aſſemblies of the other provinces,  
yet the ſpirit of the deſign languiſhed, and but  
little more was then done in it. |  
  
«3  
  
This,  
  
1 9 J  
  
This, my Lords, is the great and principal  
8 of their quarrel with Mr. Hutchinſon.  
They want a Governor, who ſhall know 1%  
than themſelves, whereas he makes them feel  
that he knows more. He ſtopped the train  
which Dr, F ranklin&#x27;s conſtituents had laid, to  
blow up the province into a flame, which from  
thence was to have been ſpread over the other  
provinces. This was the real provocation: and  
for this they have been ſeeking for ſome ground  
of accuſation againſt him. |  
  
After ſifting his whole conduct for che four  
years, in which he has been Governor, they  
are not able to point out a ſingle action to find  
fault with. Their only recourſe is to their own  
ſurmiſes of what were the ſentiments of his  
heart five or ſix years ago. He was, they lays  
among the. inſtruments in introducing a fleet and  
army into the province. — Have they attempted  
any proof of this? No. But they fancy it from  
ſome. letters of his, which do not ſay a ſingla |  
word of that ſort, Is it poſſible to conceive of  
a more groundleſs accuſation, or not to ſee their  
intent in it?  
  
My Lords, They mean er more by this  
Address, than to fix a ſtigma on the Governor  
by the accuſation. Their charge, founded upon  
a pretence of knowing ſix years ago, what were  
Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s thoughts, is not really de-  
  
ſigned

ſigned for his Majeſty in Council. They know  
that your Lordſhips will not take an accuſation  
for &#x27;a proof; nor condemn without evidence.  
They &quot;never defired .to be brought to a hear-  
ing: and therefore the firſt inſtant when ybur  
Lordſhips call for their proofs, they fly off, and  
  
  
before your Lordſhips ; and they ſay truly: they  
  
  
addreſs the popular prejudices. The mob,  
they know, need only hear their Governors  
accuſed, and they will be ſure to condemn. My  
Lords, they boaſt at Bofton, that they have  
found this method&#x27; ſucceed againſt their laſt  
Governor, and they hope to make it do againſt  
this; and by a ſecond precedent to eſtabliſh their  
power, and make all future Governors bow to  
  
  
into a tyranny greater than the Roman: To be  
able, ſitting in their own ſecret cabal, to dictate  
for the Aſſembly, and ſend away their verboſa  
et grandis epiſtola, and get even a virtuous Go-  
vernor dragged from his ſeat, and made the g  
ſport of a Boſton mob. |  
  
Having turned out all other Governors, they  
may at length hope to get one of their own.  
  
  
have intimated that Dr. Franklin was aiming at  
Mr, Hutchinſon&#x27;s government. It was not eafy  
ee 15 | before  
  
*  
  
141  
  
before this to give credit to ſuch ſurmiſes: But  
nothing ſurely but a too eager attention to an  
ambition of this ſort, could have betrayed a  
wiſe man into ſuch a conduct as we have now  
ſeen. Whether theſe ſurmiſes are true or not,  
your Lordſhips are much, the beſt judges. If  
they ſhould be true, I hope that Mr. Hutchin-  
ſon will not meet with the leſs countenance from  
your Lordſhips, for his Rival&#x27;s being his accuſer.  
Nor will your Lordſhips, I truſt, from what  
you have heard, adviſe the having Mr. Hutch-  
inſon diſplaced, in order to make room for Dr.  
Franklin as a ſucceſſor. 1 0  
  
With regard to his conflituents, the Laid  
leaders at Boſton, who make this complaint  
againſt their Governor; if the relating of their  
evil doings be criminal, and tending to alienate -  
his Majeſty&#x27;s affections, muſt not the doing of them  
be much more ſo? Yet now they aſk that his  
Majeſty will gratify and reward them for doing  
theſe things; and that he will puniſh their Go-  
vernor for relating them, becauſe they are ſo  
very bad that it cannot but offend his Majeſty  
to hear of them. |  
  
My Lords, if the account, given in theſe  
letters, of their proceedings, five years ago,  
tended to alienate his Majeſty&#x27;s affections, has  
their conduct ever ſince been in any reſpect more  
conciliating? Was. it to. confute or prevent the  
  
per-  
  
| L m2 ]  
  
pertiicious effect of: theks letters, that the good  
men of Boſton have lately held their meetings,  
appointed their Committees, and with their  
uſual moderation deſtroyed the cargo of three  
Britiſh ſhips? If an Engliſh Conſul, in any part  
of France or Spain, or rather Algiers or Tripoli,  
(for European Powers reſpect the law of na-  
tions) had not called this an outrage on his  
country, he would have deſerved puniſhment.  
But if a Governor at Boſton ſhould preſume to  
whiſper to a friend, that he thinks it ſomewhat  
more than a moderate exertion of Engliſh liberty,  
to deſtroy the ſhips of England, to attack her  
officers, to plunder their goods, to pull down  
their houſes, or even to burn the King&#x27;s ſhips of  
war, he ought to be removed; becauſe ſuch a  
conduct in him has a natural and efficacious: ten-  
  
 dency to interrupt the harmony between Great-Bri-  
tain and the colony, which theſe good ſubjects  
  
are ſtriving by ſuch means to eſtabliſh, :  
On the part of Mr. Hutchinſon and Mr.  
; Oliver, I am inſtructed to aſſure your Lordſhips,  
that they feel no ſpark of reſentment, even at  
the individuals who have done them this injuſ-  
tice. Their private letters breathe nothing but  
moderation. They are convinced that the peo-  
pie, though miſled, are innocent. If the con-  
duct of a few ſhould provoke a juſt indignation,  
they would be the moſt forward, and, I truſt,

the moſt efficacious ſolicitors to avert its effects,  
and to excuſe the men. They love the ſoil, the  
conſtitution, the people of New-England; they  
look with reverence to this country, and with  
affection to that. For the ſake of the people  
they wiſh ſome faults corrected, anarchy abo-  
liſhed, and government re-eſtabliſhed : But theſe  
ſalutary ends they wiſh to promote by the  
gentleſt means; and the abridging of no liber-  
ties, which a people can poſſibly uſe to its own  
advantage. A reſtraint from ſelf-· deſtruction is  
the only reſtraint they deſire to be impoſed upon  
New-England.  
  
My Lords, I have ſaid that the letter, which  
accompanied theſe in queſtion, was anonymous,  
and that it was directed to be ſhown to fix per-  
ſons only.  
  
I am prepared to enter into the proof of  
. this.—I call upon Dr. Franklin, for my wit-  
nels. And I am ready to examine him.  
  
N. B. Dr. Franklin being preſent, remained  
filent. But declared by his counſel, that he  
did not chuſe to be examined.

and, after praying the removal of his Majeſty&#x27;s  
Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, they now  
  
  
There is no charge There are no accuſers  
There are no proofs. They ſay that the Gover -

NI Lords, This is ſo very extraordinary a  
proceeding, that I know of no precedent, except  
one: but that, I confeſs, according to the Ro-  
man poet&#x27;s report, is a caſe in point.  
  
Nunquam, f quid mihi credis, amavi  
Hunc hominem.—Sed quo cecidit ſub crimine ?!—Quiſnam  
Delator—Quibus Indicibus ?—Quo Teſtes probavit—  
Nit horum—Verboſa &amp; grandis epiſtola venit |  
| A capreis—Bene habet: nil plus interrogo.  
  
”. .  
  
My Lords, The only purport of this inpor-  
tant addreſs 1s, that the Governor and Lieute-  
nant-Governor have loſt the confidence of the  
people, upon account of ſome papers, which  
they have voted to be unfriendly t to them, and  
that they have been amongſt the chief inftruments in  
introducing a fleet and army into the province, —  
  
_ Your Lordſhips have heard the letters read, and  
are the beſt judges of their tendency. 1 can  
appeal to your Lordſhips, that it was not theſe  
letters, but their own ill conduct, which made  
it neceſſary to order the four regiments. In  
point of time it was impoſſible : for in Mr.  
Hutchinſon&#x27;s very firſt letter, it appears, that  
they had an expectation of troops. And they  
arrived in three months after. I could appeal  
too to their own knowledge: for the printed  
collection of Sir Francis Bernard&#x27;s and General  
Gage&#x27;s, &amp;c. letters were before them, which  
indiſputably ſhew the direct contrary.  
hos But  
  
L 79 2]  
  
But as my learned friends have not n 3K  
to point out the demerits of: theſe letters, L need  
  
  
them only innocent letters, would be greatly to  
depreciate them. They contain the ſtrongeſt  
_ proofs of Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s good ſenſe, his great  
  
  
of that his native province. Yet, for theſe it  
is, that they tell us he has loſt the conhdence of ;  
the people: :: |  
My — There cannot abe a more e ſtriking  
inſtance of the force of truth, than what the  
Committee, who drew up theſe papers, exem-  
plify in their conduct. In their ſecond reſolu-  
- tion, they acknowledge the high character, in  
which Mr. Hutchinſon. ſtands upon account of  
his eminent abilities. In the very outſet. of their  
addreſs, they acknowledge the good g which  
he had made of thoſe abilities: for he could not  
have enjoyed their confidence, as they ſay he  
heretofore did, if he had made a bad one. They  
acknowledge that this confidence ſubſiſted, at  
leaſt till the time of his being made Governor.  
Elſe they could not expreſs their thankfulneſs to  
his Majeſty as they do, and applaud the appoint-  
ment of him, as proceeding&#x27; from the pureſt mo-  
tives of rendering his ſubjetts happy. &#x27; _. *  
In the heighth of their ill will, therefore  
to Mr. H utchinſon, truth looks his enemies

But, whatever be the ns hee  
  
  
I will now give your Lordſhips a proof of his

Every one knows that there are few ſubjects,  
  
  
eagerly intereſted themſelves, than in ſettling the  
  
  
upon theſe diſputes. Of late, they have taken  
upon themſelves to fix the limits of the King&#x27;s  
  
charters. An agreement was made between the  
two Aſſemblies of New York and Maſſachuſett&#x27;s  
  
  
miſſaries, to meet and ſettle the boundary line  
between the two provinces. Both of them no  
doubt looked out for the beſt men they had for  
  
  
ſett&#x27;s Bay, after they had choſen their commiſſa-  
  
  
truſt their intereſts in their hands, if Mr. Hutch-  
inſon would go along with them. To him they  
had been uſed to look, as the man, who beſt knew

rights: :

leaders perhaps might have been content to loſe  
  
  
knowledge and abilities of Mr. Hutchinſon.  
  
  
Gentlemen were poſſeſſed of the offices, from  
which the Aſſembly now aſk their removal.

for each other, and the tender concern they felt -  
for the honour of their brother&#x27;s memory, as  
  
well as their own, can witneſs the diſtreſſes  
which this occafioned. My Lords, the late 5  
Mr. Whately was moſt ſcrupulouſly cautious  
about his letters. We lived for many years in  
the ſtricteſt i intimacy and in all thoſe years 1  
never ſaw a ſingle letter written to him. Theſe  
letters I believe were in his cuſtody at his death.  
And I as firmly believe, that without fraud,  
they could not have been got out of the cuſtody  
of the perſon whoſe hands they fell into. His

and to reaſon upon thoſe conjectures: —But let  
the letters have been lodged where they may;  
from the hour of Mr. Thomas Whately&#x27;s death,  
they became the property of his brother and of  
the Whately family. Dr. Franklin could not  
but know this, and that no one had a right to  
diſpoſe of them but they only - Other re-  
ceivers of goods diſhonourably come by, may  
plead as a pretence for keeping them, that  
they don&#x27;t know who are the proprietors: In  
this caſe there was not the common excuſe of  
ignoranee; the Doctor knew whole” they were,  
  
and yet did not reſtore them to the right owner  
E This property is as ſacred and as precious to  
Gentlemen of integrity, as their family plate or  
j;ũewels are. And no man who knows the Whate-  
ly&#x27;s, will doubt, but that they would much  
ſooner have choſen, that any perſon ſhould have  
taken their plate, and ſent it to Holland for his  
avarice, than that he ſnhould have ſecreted the  
letters of their friends, their brother&#x27;s friend  
and their father&#x27;s friend, and ſent: them away to

The reaſons aſſigned. for this are as extraor-

But, my Lords, the bi in which: Dr. Franklin  
appears, is not even that of a Province Agent: he  
moves in a very inferior orbit. An Agent for a  
provinte, your Lordſnips know, is a perſon choſen  
by the joint act of the Governor, Council, and  
Aſſembly; after which, a commiſſion is iſſuad  
by the Secretary, under the province feal, ap-  
pointing hin to that office. Such a real Colony  
  
  
all the three branches of the Government, will  
think it his duty to conſult the joint ſervice f  
all the three; and to contribute all he can to  
the peace, harmony, and orderly government  
of the whole; as well as to the general welfare  
and proſperity. of the province.&quot; Fhis at leaſt is

Council to the Aſſembly, deſiring that they  
would join in the choice of an Agent for the  
Colony, they came to a reſolution, that they  
will not join with the Honourable Board in the  
choice of ſuch an Agent; but reſolve that they  
will chooſe an Agent of their own; and then,  
that Dr. Franklin ſnould be that Agent. My  
Lords, the party by whom the Aſſembly is now  
directed, did not want a man who ſnhould think  
himſelf bound in duty to conſult for the peace

Your Lordſhips will be: lead, to een this .  
time of Dr. Franklin&#x27;s announcing his intention  
of drawing up for them ſuch a memorial, was  
in 1771. At the proper ſeaſon in the next year;  
there was produced a great work, under thefe  
very heads of a State of Rights, and a State of  
Grievances, and Proteſts againſt the new Inno.

that would not have anſwered the purpoſe. It  
was to be a memorial in ibe name and bebalf of  
the province; and therefore was firſt to be ſent  
thither, and receive the ſtamp of their authorities?  
A town meeting therefore was called, and a  
Committee of Correſpondence choſen, to draw  
up a ſtate of their rights and grievances, and  
from the form of the reſolution it is pretty mani-  
feſt, that the leaders knew already what the work  
was to be. After an adjournment the Com-  
mittee met, and produced this great twelve.  
penny book, under the very heads of a State of  
their Rights, and containing a liſt of their  
Grievances, with remonſtrances ſufficiently ſtrong

mittee of Correſpondence ſhould be printed 1 in a  
pamphlet, and that ſix hundred copies of them  
ſhould be dif] poſed of to the ſelect men of the towns  
  
  
ſounding an alarm of a plan of deſpotiſi, with  
which the Adminiſtration (and the Parliament)  
intended to enſlave them; and threatened them  
with certain and inevitable deftrutiion : And de-  
ſiring that they would call town- meetings, and  
ſend their votes and reſolutions upon this book.  
In 60 or 70 villages or townſhips ſuch meetings  
had been held: And all expreſs the higheſt  
  
  
well they might; for it told them à hundred  
rights, of which they never had heard before,  
and a hundred grievances which they never  
before had felt. Your Lordſhips ſee the votes  
  
and inſtructions of theſe ſeveral townſhips, in the  
Boſton gazettes here before me. They are full  
of the moſt extravagant abſurdities. Such as

« and harmony may again take place“.  
  
Theſe are the leſſons taught in Dr. Frank-  
| lin&#x27;s ſchool: of Politics. My Lords, I do not  
| ſay that Dr. Franklin is the original author  
of this book. But your Lordſhips will give  
me leave to obſerve, in the firſt place, that  
it is not very likely, that any of the Doctor&#x27;s  
ſcholars at Boſton, ſhould attempt to draw up  
ſuch a ſtate of rights and grievances, when the  
great man, their maſter, had, given them notice  
that he ſhould himſelf ſet about ſuch a work:  
and, in the next place, that if the Doctor ſhould  
not chuſe now to filiate the child, yet the time  
has been when he was not aſhamed of it; for,  
after 1 it had had its operation in America, the  
P 2 Doctor  
  
  
own, and preſented it to his friends. 1 *  
  
My Lords, I have ſaid, that Eh or ld  
ef the townſhips had already voted their appro-  
bation of the book. The evil was catching  
from town to town (and if the greater part  
eould have been engaged, they would have  
forced the reſt) when the Governor thought it  
his duty to interpoſe. He therefore called upon  
the Aſſembly to diſown theſe undutiful proceed-  
mes. Had he only mentioned the diſloyalty  
and evil tendency of them, they would pro-  
bably have paſſed a few refolutions, and have  
fuffered the evil to go on. He was well aware,  
  
  
many privileges as they pleaſed, but that it was  
not ſo eaſy to prove their right to them. He,  
therefore, diſarmed them of their ſtrength in vot-  
ing, and put them under the neceſſity of proving;  
and there he knew they would fail. By opening  
the ſeſſion with that very maſterly ſpeech in de-  
  
  
for a time, ſtunned the faction, and gave a  
check to the progreſs of their Town-Meetings:  
And though the ſame men were in the Aſſembly  
created a Committee of Correſpondence, to  
write to the Aſſemblies of the other provinces,  
yet the ſpirit of the deſign langurthed, and but  
little more was then done in it. £7  
  
Th is,  
  
3 k  
- This, my Lords, is the great and principal  
ground of their quarrel with Mr. Hutchinſon,  
They want a Governor, who ſhall know leſs  
than themſelves, whereas he makes them feel  
that he knows more. He ſtopped the train  
which Dr. Franklin s conſtituents had laid, to  
  
  
thence was to have been ſpread over the other  
provinces. This was the real provocation: and  
for this they haye been ſeeking for lame . :  
of accuſation: againſt 1  
  
After ſifting his whole conduct for.the four  
years, in which he has been Governor, they  
are not able to point out a ſingle action to find  
fault with; Their only recourſe is to their own  
ſurmiſes of what were, the ſentiments of his  
heart five or ſix years ago. He. was, they ſay,  
among the. inſtruments in introducing a&#x27; fleet - aud  
army into the province. Have they. attempted  
any proof of this ? .No. But they fancy it from  
ſome. letters of his, which do not ſay a ſingle  
word of that ſort. Is it poſſible to conceive of  
| a more groundleſs accuſation, or not to ſee their  
intent in it? |  
  
. My Lords, They mean nothing more by this |  
Addreſs, than to fix a ſtigma on the Governor  
by the accuſation. Their ane founded upon  
a, pretence of knowing: ſix years ago, what were  
* Hutchinſon&#x27;s thoughts, 1 is not really de-  
  
ſigned  
  
i 1 1  
  
fened for his Majeſty in Council. They know  
  
that your Lordſhips will not take an accuſation  
for a proof; nor condemn without evidence.  
They never deſired to be brought to a hear-  
ing: and therefore the firſt inſtant when your  
Lordſhips call for their proofs, they fly off, and  
ſay they do not mean this as a charge, or a trial  
before your Lordſhips; and they ſay truly: they  
meant to bring it before the multitude, and to  
addreſs the popular prejudices. The mob,  
they know, need only hear their Governors  
accuſed, and hey will be ſure to condemn. My  
Lords, they boaſt at Boſton, that they have  
  
  
Governor, and they hope to make it do againſt  
this; and by a ſecond precedent to eſtabliſh their  
power, and make all future Governors bow to  
their authority. They wiſh to erect themſelves  
into a tyranny greater than the Roman : To be  
able, fitting in their own ſecret cabal, to dictate  
for the Aſſembly, and ſend away their verboſa  
et grandis epiſtola, and get even a virtuous Go-  
vernor dragged from his ſeat, and made the  
ſport of a Boſton mob. |  
  
Having turned out all other FRE they |  
may at, length hope to get one of their own.  
  
  
have intimated that Dr. Franklin was aiming at  
Mr. Hutchinſon&#x27;s government. It was not eaſy  
8 before  
  
* * 1  
  
  
nothing ſurely but a too eager attention to an  
ambition of this ſort, could have betrayed a  
wiſe man into ſuch a conduct as we have now  
ſeen. Whether theſe ſurmiſes are true or not,  
your Lordſhips are much the beſt judges. If  
they ſhould be true, I hope that Mr. Hutchin-  
ſon will not meet with the leſs countenance from  
  
  
Nor will your Lordihips, I truſt, from what  
  
: you have heard, adviſe the having Mr.” Hutch-  
  
inſon diſplaced, in order to make room for Dr.  
Franklin as a ſucceſſor.  
  
With regard to his pada the factious  
  
  
againſt their Governor ; if the relating of their  
evil doings be criminal, and tending to alienate  
his Majeſty&#x27;s affections, muſt not the doing of them  
be much more ſo? Yet now they aſk that his  
Majeſty will gratify and reward them for doing  
  
  
vernor for relating them, becauſe they are ſo  
  
  
to hear of them.  
  
My Lords, if the account, given in theſe  
Been of their proceedings, five years ago,  
  
tended to alienate his Majeſty&#x27;s affections, has  
  
  
cConciliating? Was it to confute or prevent the

men of Boſton have lately held their meetings,

(for European Powers reſpect the law. of na-

to deſtroy the ſhips of England, to attack her

look with reverence to this country, and with  
affection to that. For the ſake of the people  
they wiſh ſome faults corrected, anarchy abo-

the only reſtraint they deſire to be impoſed upon  
New-Engl and, |  
  
My Lords, I have ſaid that the letter, which  
accompanied theſe in queſtion, was anonymous,  
and that it was directed to be ſhown to ſix *

I am prepared to enter into the proof of  
this.—I call upon Dr. Franklin, for my wit-

N. B. Dr. Franklin being preſent, remained  
filent. But declared by his counſel, that he

man, Wedderburne, turning from the real question,  
employed all his cunning powers of distortion and  
misrepresentation to abuse. With an absurdity of  
application which the lords of the Privy Council  
were too much prejudiced to observe, he drew a  
parallel between Boston and Capri, Hutchinson and  
Sejanus, the humble petition of the Massachusetts  
assembly, and a verbose and grand epistle of the  
Emperor Tiberius. Franklin, whose character was  
most benign, and who, from obvious motives of

startling to read now the invectives which were  
heaped upon the heads of our Revolutionary  
sires, whom we hold in such reverence that it is  
difficult to believe any different opinion was  
ever held of them. But among the contem-  
porary evidences of the state of British feeling  
toward the American colonies at that time we  
have an extract from the invective of Wedder-  
burne, in Parliament, against Franklin, who  
said: ‘“‘Amidst these tranquil events here isa  
man who, with the utmost insensibility of re-  
morse, stands up and avows himself the author  
of all. Ican compare him only to ‘Zanga’ in

honour of this country, of Europe, and of mankind. Private corre-  
spondence has hitherto been held sacred in times of the greatest party  
rage, not only in politics, but in religion. The betrayer of it has  
forfeited all the respect of society, and of fellow-men. Into what  
companies will he hereafter go with an unembarrassed face, or the  
honest intrepidity of virtue? Men will watch him with a jealous  
eye, they will hide their papers from him, and lock up their  
escritoires. He will henceforth esteem it a libel to be called “a man  
of letters,” homo trium literarum. But he not only took away the

defensive. “The letters,’ said he,  
“could not have come to Dr. Frank-  
lin by fair means. The writers did  
not give them to him, nor yet did the  
deceased correspondent. Nothing,  
then, will acquit Dr. Franklin of the  
charge of obtaining them by fraudu-  
lent or corrupt means, for the most  
malignant of purposes; unless he stole  
them from the person that stole them.  
This argument is irrefragable. I  
hope, my Lords, you will mark and  
brand the man, for the honor of this  
country, of Europe, and of mankind,  
Private correspondence has hitherto  
been held sacred in times of the  
greatest party rage, not only in poli-  
tics, but religion. He has forfeited  
all the respect of societies and of  
men. Into what companies will he  
hereafter go with an unembarrassed  
face, or the honest intrepidity of vir-  
tue? Men will watch him with a  
jealous eye—they will hide their pa-  
pers from him, and lock up their  
escritoires. He will henceforth es-  
teem it a libel to be called a man of  
letters—homo trium literarum. But  
he not only took away the letters  
from one brother, but kept himself  
concealed till he nearly occasioned  
the murder of the other. It is impos-  
sible to read his account, expressive  
of the coolest and most deliberate  
malice, without horror. Amidst these  
tragical events, of one person nearly  
murdered, of another answerable for  
the issue, of a worthy governor hurt  
in his dearest interests, the fate of  
America in suspense—here is a man  
who, with the utmost insensibility of  
remorse, stands up and avows him-

These two eye-witnesses of the scene at the Privy Council  
therefore describe in general terms the character of the stuff  
of the dress worn by Franklin on that occasion. But, be-  
sides that, one of them, Dr. Priestley, it will have been

This property is as sacred and as precious  
to Gentlemen of integrity, as their family plate  
or jewels are. And no man who knows the  
Whatelys, will doubt, but that they would much  
sooner have chosen, that any person should have  
taken their plate and sent it to Holland for his  
avarice, than that he should have secreted the  
letters of their friends, their brother’s friend, and  
their father’s friend, and sent them away to Bos-  
ton to gratify an enemy’s malice. . . . A foreign  
Ambassador when residing here, just before the  
breaking out of a war, or upon particular occa-  
  
sions, may bribe a villain to steal or betray  
any state papers; he is under the command of  
another state, and is not amenable to the laws  
of the country where he resides; and the se-  
cure exemption from punishment may induce  
a laxer morality. But Mr. Franklin, what-  
ever he may teach the people at Boston,  
while he is here at least is a subject.
