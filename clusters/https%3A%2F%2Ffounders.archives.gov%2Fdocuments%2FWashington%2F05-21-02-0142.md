Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives  
In recurring to the internal situation of our country since I had last the pleasure to address you, I find ample reason for a renewed expression of that gratitude to the Ruler of the Universe, which a continued series of prosperity has so often and so justly called forth.  
The acts of the last session, which required special arrangements, have been, as far as circumstances would admit, carried into operation.  
Measures calculated to ensure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians, and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier, have been digested and adopted. In the framing of these, care has been taken to guard, on the one hand, our advanced settlements from the predatory incursions of those unruly individuals, who cannot be restrained by their Tribes; and on the other hand, to protect the rights secured to the Indians by treaty; to draw them nearer to the civilised state; and inspire them with correct conceptions of the power, as well as justice of the Government.  
The meeting of the deputies from the Creek nation at Colerain, in the State of Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their land by that State, broke up without it’s being accomplished; the nation having previous to their departure instructed them against making any sale: the occasion however has been improved, to confirm by a new treaty with the Creeks, their pre-existing engagements with the United States; and to obtain their consent to the establishment of trading  
  
houses, and military posts within their boundary; by means of which, their friendship and the general peace may be more effectually secured.  
The period during the late session at which the appropriation was passed, for carrying into effect the treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and his Britannic Majesty, necessarily procrastinated the reception of the posts stipulated to be delivered, beyond the date assigned for that event. As soon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addressed with propriety on the subject, arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded for their evacuation, and the United States took possession of the principal of them, comprehending Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michelimakinac and Fort Miami, where such repairs and additions have been ordered to be made as appeared indispensible.  
The Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great Britain, to determine which is the river St Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson Esqr. of New York, for the third Commissioner. The whole met at St Andrews, in Passamaquoddy bay, in the beginning of October, and directed surveys to be made of the rivers in dispute; but deeming it impracticable to have these surveys completed before the next year, they adjourned, to meet at Boston in August 1797, for the final decision of the question.  
Other Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States, agreeably to the seventh article of the treaty with Great Britain, relative to captures and condemnation of vessels and other property, met the Commissioners of his britannic Majesty in London, in August last, when John Trumbull Esqr. was chosen by lot, for the fifth Commissioner. In October following the board were to proceed to business. As yet, there has been no communication of Commissioners on the part of Great Britain, to unite with those who have been appointed on the part of the United States, for carrying into effect the sixth article of the Treaty.  
The Treaty with Spain required that the Commissioners for running the boundary line between the territory of the United States and his Catholic Majesty’s Provinces of East and West Florida, should meet at the Natchez before the expiration of six months after the exchange of the ratifications, which was  
  
effected at Aranjuez on the 25th day of April; and the troops of his catholic Majesty occupying any posts within the limits of the United States, were within the same period to be withdrawn. The Commissioner of the United States, therefore, commenced his journey for the Natchez in September, and troops were ordered to occupy the posts from which the Spanish garrisons should be withdrawn. Information has been recently received of the appointment of a Commissioner on the part of his catholic Majesty for running the boundary line; but none of any appointment for the adjustment of the claims of our citizens whose vessels were captured by the armed vessels of Spain.  
In pursuance of the act of Congress passed in the last session, for the protection and relief of American seamen, agents were appointed, one to reside in Great Britain, and the other in the West Indies. The effects of the agency in the West Indies are not yet fully ascertained; but those which have been communicated afford grounds to believe the measure will be beneficial. The agent destined to reside in Great Britain declining to accept the appointment, the business has consequently devolved on the Minister of the United States in London, and will command his attention, until a new agent shall be appointed.  
After many delays and disappointments, arising out of the European war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Algiers, will, in all present appearance, be crowned with success; but under great, though inevitable disadvantages in the pecuniary transactions, occasioned by that war; which will render a further provision necessary. The actual liberation of all our citizens who were prisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling heart, is itself an earnest, of a satisfactory termination of the whole negotiation. Measures are in operation for effecting Treaties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.  
To an active external commerce, the protection of a naval force is indispensible. This is manifest with regard to wars in which a State is itself a party. But besides this, it is in our own experience, that the most sincere neutrality is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of nations at war. To secure respect to a neutral flag, requires a naval force, organized and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression. This may even prevent the necessity of going to war, by discouraging  
  
belligerent powers from committing such violations of the rights of the neutral party as may first or last, leave no other option. From the best information I have been able to obtain, it would seem as if our trade to the Mediterranean without a protecting force will always be insecure, and our citizens exposed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but just been relieved.  
These considerations invite the United States to look to the means, and to set about the gradual creation of a navy. The increasing progress of their navigation promises them, at no distant period, the requisite supply of seamen; and their means in other respects favour the undertaking. It is an encouragement likewise, that their particular situation will give weight and influence to a moderate naval force in their hands. Will it not then be advisable to begin without delay, to provide and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of ships of war; and to proceed in the work by degrees, in proportion as our resources shall render it practicable without inconvenience; so that a future war of Europe may not find our commerce in the same unprotected state, in which it was found by the present?  
Congress have repeatedly, and not without success, directed their attention to the encouragement of manufactures. The object is of too much consequence not to ensure a continuance of their efforts in every way which shall appear eligible. As a general rule, manufactures on public account are inexpedient. But where the state of things in a country leaves little hope that certain branches of manufacture will, for a great length of time, obtain; when these are of a nature essential to the furnishing and equipping of the public force in time of war; are not establishments for procuring them on public account to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service, recommended by strong considerations of national policy, as an exception to the general rule? Ought our country to remain in such cases dependant on foreign supply, precarious, because liable to be interrupted? If the necessary articles should in this mode cost more in time of peace, will not the security and independence thence arising, form an ample compensation? Establishments of this sort, commensurate only with the calls of the public service in time of peace, will, in time of war, easily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the Government; and may even perhaps be made to yield a surplus for the supply of our citizens at large; so  
  
as to mitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade. If adopted, the plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already, or likely soon to be established in the country; in order that there may be no danger of interference with pursuits of individual industry.  
It will not be doubted, that with reference either to individual or national welfare, Agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as nations advance in population, and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more apparent; and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting it, grow up supported by the public purse: and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success, than the establishment of Boards, composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing information, and enabled by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase of improvement; by stimulating to enterprise and experiment; and by drawing to a common centre the results every where, of individual skill and observation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Experience accordingly has shewn, that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefits.  
I have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress, the expediency of establishing a National University; and also a Military Academy. The desireableness of both these Institutions, has so constantly increased with every new view I have taken of the subject, that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for all, recalling your attention to them.  
The assembly, to which I address myself, is too enlightened not to be fully sensible how much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contributes to national prosperity and reputation. True it is, that our country, much to its honour, contains many seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful; but the funds upon which they rest, are too narrow to command the ablest professors in the different departments of liberal knowledge, for the Institution contemplated; though they would be excellent auxiliaries.  
Amongst the motives to such an Institution, the assimilation  
  
of the principles, opinions and manners of our countrymen, by the common education of a portion of our Youth from every quarter, well deserves attention. The more homogeneous our citizens can be made in these particulars, the greater will be our prospect of permanent union; and a primary object of such a national institution should be, the education of our Youth in the science of Government. In a Republic, what species of knowledge can be equally important? and what duty more pressing on its Legislature, than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those, who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?  
The institution of a Military Academy, is also recommended by cogent reasons. However pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge for emergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character, and both would hazard its safety, or expose it to greater evils when war could not be avoided. Besides, that war might often not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as the observance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation from the necessity of practicing the rules of the military art, ought to be its care in preserving and transmitting by proper establishments, the knowledge of that art. Whatever argument may be drawn from particular examples, superficially viewed; a thorough examination of the subject will evince, that the art of war is at once comprehensive and complicated; that it demands much previous study; and that, the possession of it, in its most improved and perfect state, is always of great moment to the security of a nation. This, therefore, ought to be a serious care of every Government; and for this purpose, an academy, where a regular course of instruction is given, is an obvious expedient, which different nations have successfully employed.  
The compensations to the officers of the United States, in various instances, and in none more than in respect to the most important stations, appear to call for Legislative revision. The consequences of a defective provision are of serious import to the Government. If private wealth is to supply the defect of public retribution, it will greatly contract the sphere within which the selection of character for office is to be made; and will proportionally diminish the probability of a choice of men able as well as upright. Besides that it would be repugnant to the vital  
  
principles of our Government, virtually to exclude from public trusts talents and virtue, unless accompanied by wealth.  
While in our external relations, some serious inconveniencies and embarrassments have been overcome, and others lessened, it is with much pain, and deep regret I mention, that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature, have lately occurred. Our trade has suffered, and is suffering extensive injuries in the West-Indies, from the Cruisers, and agents of the French Republic; and communications have been received from its Minister here, which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its authority; and which are, in other respects, far from agreeable.  
It has been my constant, sincere and earnest wish, in conformity with that of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and a perfectly friendly understanding with that Republic. This wish remains unabated; and I shall persevere in the endeavour to fulfil it, to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with a just, and indispensable regard to the rights and honor of our Country: nor will I easily cease to cherish the expectation, that a spirit of justice, candour and friendship, on the part of the Republic, will eventually ensure success.  
In pursuing this course, however, I cannot forget what is due to the character of our Government and nation; or to a full and entire confidence in the good sense, patriotism, self-respect and fortitude of my countrymen.  
I reserve for a special message, a more particular communication on this interesting subject.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
I have directed an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the service of the ensuing year, to be submitted from the proper department; with a view of the public receipts and expenditures to the latest period to which an account can be prepared.  
It is with satisfaction I am able to inform you, that the revenues of the United States continue in a state of progressive improvement.  
A reinforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public debt, was mentioned in my address at the opening of the last session. Some preliminary steps were taken towards it, the maturing of which will, no doubt, engage your zealous attention during the present. I will only add, that it will afford me a  
  
heart-felt satisfaction to concur in such further measures, as will ascertain to our country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the Debt. Posterity may have cause to regret, if from any motive, intervals of tranquillity are left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
My solicitude to see the Militia of the United States placed on an efficient establishment, has been so often, and so ardently expressed, that I shall but barely recall the subject to your view on the present occasion; at the same time that I shall submit to your enquiry, whether our Harbours are yet sufficiently secured.  
The situation in which I now stand, for the last time, in the midst of the Representatives of the People of the United States, naturally recals the period when the administration of the present form of Government commenced; and I cannot omit the occasion to congratulate you, and my country, on the success of the experiment; nor to repeat my fervent supplications, to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations, that his Providential care may still be extended to the United States; that the virtue and happiness of the People, may be preserved; and that the Government, which they have instituted, for the protection of their liberties, may be perpetual.

Dec. 7, 1796.  
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate,  
  
and Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
N recurring to the internal fi-  
  
tuation of our country fince  
I had laft the pleafure to addrefs  
you, I find ample reafon for a re-  
newedexpreflion of that gratitude  
to the Ruler of the Univerfe,  
which a continued feries of prof-  
perity has fo often and fo juitly  
ealled forth.  
  
The aéts of the laf fefhon,  
which required fpecial arrange-  
ments, have been, as far as cir-  
cumftances would admit, carried  
into operation.  
  
Meafures calculated to enfure  
2 continuance of the friendfhip  
of the Indians, and to preferve a  
peace along the extent of our in-  
terior frontier, have been digett-  
ed and adopted. In the framing  
of thefe, care has been taken to  
guard on the one hand, our ad-  
vanced fettlement from the pre-  
datory incurfions of thofe unruly  
individuals, who cannot be re-  
{trained by their tribes ; and on  
the other hand, to protect the  
rights fecured to the Indians by  
‘treaty ; to draw them nearer to  
the civilized ftate—and infpire  
  
them with correct conceptions of  
the power, as well as juftice of  
government. ’  
  
The meeting of the deputies  
from the Creek Nation at Coler-  
aine, inthe ftate of Georgia, which  
had for a principal object, the  
purchafe of a parcel of their land  
by that ftate, broke up without  
being accomplifhed ; the nation  
having previous to their depar-  
ture inftructedthem againft make  
ing any fale : The occafion, how-  
ever, has been improved, to con-  
firm by a new treaty with the  
Creeks, their pre-exifting engage-  
ments with the United States;  
and to obtain their confent to  
the eftablifhment of trading hou-  
fes, and military pofts within  
their boundaries : by means of  
which, their friendthip and the  
general peace may be more effec-  
tually fecured.  
  
The period during the late  
feflion at which the appropria-  
tion was pafled, for carrying in-

tween the United States and his  
Britannic Majefty, neceffarily

ed, beyond the date afligned for  
that event. As foon, however,

da could be addrefsed with pro-  
priety on the fubject, arrange-  
ments were cordially and prompt-  
ly concluded for thetr avacuation,  
and wie United States took pof-  
fevlicn of the principal of them,  
comprehending Ofwego, Niagara,  
  
roit, Michilumakinac and Fort  
Miami, where fuch repairs and  
additions bave been ordered to be  
made as appeared indifpenfible.  
  
ihe commiflioners appointed  
on the part of the United States  
and of Gréat-Britain,to determ ine  
which is theriver St. Croix, men-  
tioned in the treaty of peace of  
1753, agreed in the choice of Eg-  
bert Benton, Eig. of New York,  
for the third commitlioner. The  
whole met at St. Andrews, in  
Pailamaquaddy Bay, in the be-  
ginning of October, and directed  
jurveys to be made of the rivers  
in difpute ; but deeming it im-  
practicable to have thefe furveys  
completed before the next year,  
they adjourned to meet in Boiton,  
in Augult,.1797, for the final  
decifion of the queftion.  
  
Other commitloners appoint-  
ed on the part of the United  
States, agreeably to the feventh  
articie of the treaty with Great-  
Britain, relative to captures and  
condemnation of veflels and oth«  
€r property, met the commiffion-  
ers of his Brittannic Majefty in  
London, in Auguft laft, when  
John ‘Trumbull, Efg. was chofen  
by lot, for the fifth commiffion-  
er. In October following, the  
board were to proceed to bufi-  
neis. As yet, there has been no  
communication of commiffioners  
on the part of Great-Britain to  
  
unite with thofe who have bees  
appointed on the part of the Us  
nited States, for carrying into efs  
fet the fixth article of the treaty.  
  
The treaty with Spain requir.  
ed that the Commiiioners for  
running the boundary line be.  
tween the territory of the United  
States and his Catholic Majetty’s  
provinces of Eaft and Wett Flo.  
rida, fhould meet at the Naicheg  
before the eapiration of fix  
months aiter the exchange of  
the ratifications, which was ef  
fected at Aranjuez on the 2gth  
day of April; and the troops of  
his Catholic Majefty occupying  
any pofts within the limits ot the  
United States, were within the  
fame period to be withdrawn.  
The commiihoner of the United  
States, therefore, commenced his  
journey for the Natchez in Sep-  
tember, and troops were ordered  
to occupy the potts from which  
the Spanifh garrifon fhould be  
withdrawn. Informationhasbeen  
recently received of the appoint-  
ment of a Commiffioner on the  
part of his Catholic Majefty for  
running the boundary line ; but  
none of any appointment for the  
adjuftment of the claims of our  
citizens whofe veffels were cap-  
tured by thearmed veffels ofSpain.  
  
In purtuance of the act of con-  
grefs pafled in the laft fefhon, for  
the protection and relief oi A-  
merican feamen, agents were ap-  
pointed, one to refide in Great-  
  
Britain, and the other in the  
  
Weit-Indies. The effects of the  
agency in the Weit-Indies are  
10t yet fully afcertained ; but

nicated afford grounds to believe  
the meafure will be beneficial.  
The agent deftined to refide ia  
Great-Britain declining to accept  
the appointment, the bufinefs has  
eonfequently devolved on the Mi-  
nifter of the United States in  
London, and will command his  
attention, until a new agent fhall  
be appointed.  
  
After many delays and difap-  
pointments, arifing out of the  
European war, the final arrange-~  
ment for fulfilling the engage-  
ments made with the Dey and  
Regency of Algiers, will in all  
prefent appearances be crowned  
with fuccefs ; but under great;  
though inevitable difadvantages  
in the pecuniary tranfactions, oc-  
cafioned by that war; which  
will render a further provifion ne-  
cefiary. The adtual liberation  
of all our citizens who were pri-  
foners in Algiers, while it prati-  
fies every fecling heart, 1s : icfelf an  
earneft of a fatisfactory termina-  
tion of the whole negociation,  
Meafures are ia preparation for  
effecting treaties with the regen-  
cies of ‘Lunis and ‘{&#x27;ripoli.  
  
To an active external com-  
merce, the protection of a naval  
  
force is indifpenfible. ‘Lhis is  
manifelt with regard to war in  
which a flate is itfelf a party.  
  
But befides this, it isin our own  
experience, that the moit fincere  
neutrality is not a fuficient guard  
againft the depredations of na-  
tions at war. ‘To fecure refpect  
to a neutral flag, requires a na-  
val force, organiz zed and ready  
to vindicate it from infult or ag-  
greflion. This may even pre-

by difcouraging belligerent pow-  
ers from committing fuch viola  
tions of the rights “of the neu-  
tral party as may, ‘fivit or lait,  
leave no other option Prom  
the beit information I have been  
able to obtain, it would -feem  
that our trade to the Mediterva-  
nean without a protecting force  
will always be infecure, and our.  
citizens expofed to the calamities  
from which a number of them  
have but juft been relieved.  
  
Thefe confiderations invite  
thie United States to look to the  
means, and to fet about the gra-  
dual ‘creation of anavy. ‘lhe  
increafing progrefs of their navi-  
gation promifes them, at no dif-  
tant period, the requifite fupply  
  
of feamen ; and their means. in  
othe refpects favour the under-.  
taking. It is an encouragement  
likwife, that their particular fit-  
uation will give weight and in-  
iluence to a moderate naval force  
in their hands. Will it notthen  
be advifcable ta begin without  
delay, to provide and lay up the  
materials for building and equip-  
ping fhips of war; and to pro-  
ceed in the work by degrees in  
proportion as our refources fhall  
render it practicable without in-  
convenience: fo that a future  
war with Europe may not find  
cur commerce in that, fame’ un-  
protected ftate, in which it was  
found by the prefent ?  
  
Congrefs have repeatedly, and  
not without fuccefs, direéted  
their attention to the encourage-  
ment of manufactures. The ob-

not to infure a continuance of  
their efforts in every way which  
thall appear eligible. Asa gen-  
eral rule, manufactures on pub-  
lic account are inexpedient ; but  
where the ftate of things in a  
country, leaves little hope, that  
certain branches of manufacture  
will, for a great‘length of time,  
obtain ; when thefe are of a na-  
ture efiential to the furnifhing  
and equipping of the public force  
in time of war, are not eftablifh-  
ments for sare them on  
public account, to the extent of  
the ordinary demand for the pub-  
lic fervice, recommended by  
{trong confiderations of national  
policy, as an exception to the  
general rule ? Ought our coun-  
try to remain, in fuch cafes, de-  
pendent on foreign fupply, pre-  
carious, becaufe liable to be in-  
terrupted ?  
  
If the neceffary articles fhould  
in this mode, coft more in time  
of peace, will not the fecu-  
rity and independence thence a-  
rifing, form an ample compen-  
fation ? Eftablifhments of this  
fort, commenfurate only with  
the calls of the public fervice in  
the time of peace, will in time  
of war, eafily be extended in  
proportion to the exigences of  
the government; and may even  
perhaps be made to yield a fur-  
plus for the fupply of our citi-  
zens at large, fo as to mitigate  
the privations from the inter-  
ruptions of their trade. If adopt-  
ed, the plan ought to exclude  
all thofe branches which are al-  
ready, or likely foon to be eftab-  
iithed in the country ; in orde  
  
that there may be no danger of  
icterference with purfuits of in-  
dividual induftry.  
  
It will not be doubted, that  
with reference either to indivi-  
dual or national welfare, agricul-  
ture is of primary importance.  
In proportion as nations increafe  
in population, and other circum.  
{tances of maturity, this truth  
becomes more apparent; and  
renders the cultivation of the foil  
more and more an object of pub-  
lic patronage. Inftitutions for  
fupporting it, grow up fupport-  
ed by the public purle; and to  
what object can it be dedicated  
with greater propriety ? Among  
the means which have been im-  
proved to this end, none have  
been attended with greater fuc-  
cefs, than the eftablifhment of  
Boards, compofed of proper  
characters, charged with col-  
leéting and diffufing information,  
and enabled by premiums and  
{mail pecuniary aids, to encour-  
age and affit a fpirit of difcovery  
and improvement. ‘This {pecies  
of eftablifhment contributes dou-  
ble to the increafe of improve-  
ments ; by ftimulating to enter-  
prife and experiment: and by  
drawing toa common centre the  
refults every where, of individu-  
al ikill and obiervation, and  
fpreading them thence over the  
whole mation. Experience ac-  
  
cordingly has fhewn, that they  
  
are very cheap inftruments of  
immenfe national benefits.  
  
I have heretofore propofed to  
the confideration of Congrefs,  
the expediency of eftablithing a

Military Academy. The defira-  
blenefs of both thefe inftitutions  
has fo conitantly increafed with  
every new view I have taken of  
the iubject, that I cannot omit  
the opportunity of once for all,  
recalling your attention.  
  
The ailembly to which I ad-  
drefs myfelf, is too enlightened  
not to be fully fenfible how much  
a flourifhing ftate of the Arts and  
Sciences contributes to national  
profperity and reputation. True  
it is, that our country, much to  
its honor, contains many Semi-  
naries of Learning highly refpec-  
table and ufeful; but the funds  
upon which they reft, are too  
narrow to command the ableft  
Profeffors in the different de-  
partments of liberal knowledge,  
for the inftitution contemplated ;  
though they would be excellent  
auxiliaries.  
  
Amongft the motives to fuch  
an inftitution, the aflimulation  
of the principles, opinions and  
manners of our countrymen by  
the common education of a por-  
tion of our youth, from every  
quarter, well deferves attention.  
‘The more homogeneous our citi-  
zens can be made in thefe parti-  
culars, the greater will be our  
profpect of permanent union ;  
and a primary object of fuch na-  
tional inftitutions, flould‘be the  
education of our youth in the {ct-  
ence of Government. Ina Re-  
public, what fpecies of knowl-  
edge can be equally important ?  
and what duty more prefling on  
its Legiflature, than to patron-  
ize a plan for communicating it  
to thofe who are to be the future  
  
685  
  
guardians of the liberties of the  
country ?  
  
“Fhe ‘inftitution of a Military  
Academy, isalfo recommended  
by cogent reafons. However  
pacific the general policy of a  
nation may be, it ought never to  
be without an adequate ftock of  
military knowledge for emergen-  
cies. ‘The firft would impair the  
energy of its character, and both  
would hazard its fafety, or ex-  
pole it to greater evils when  
war could not be avoided. Be-  
fides, that war might often not  
depend upon its own choice. In  
proportion as the obfervance of  
pacific maxims might exempt 2  
nation from the neceflity of prac-  
tifing the rules of the military  
art, ought to be its care in pre-  
ferving and tran{mitting by pro-=  
per eftablifhments, the knowl-  
edge of that art. Whatever are  
gument may be drawn from par-  
ticular examples, fuperiicially  
viewed ; a thorough examina-  
tion of the fubject will evince  
that the art of war is at once  
comprehenfive and complicated 5  
thatit demands much previous  
ftudy ; and that the pofleffion of  
it, in its moft improved and pers  
fect ftate, is always of great mo-  
ment to the fecurity of a nation.  
This therefore ought to be a feri-  
ous care of every government 5  
and for this purpofe, an acade-  
my, where a regular courfe of  
inftruction is given, is an obvi-  
ous expedient, which different  
  
‘nations have fuccefsfully employ-  
  
ed.

ortant ftations, appear to call  
Foe legiflative revifion. ‘The con-  
feguences of a defective provi-  
fion are of a ferious import to  
the government.  [f- private  
wealth is to fupply the defect of

the felection of characters for  
officers is to be made 3; and will  
roportionally diminifh the pro-  
Bability of a choice of men able  
as well as upright. Defides that  
it would be repugnant to the vi-  
tal principal of our government,  
virtually to exclude from public  
traft, talents and virtue, unieis  
accompanied by weaith.  
  
W hie in our external relations  
fome ferious inconveniences and  
embarraflments hzve been over-  
come, and others leflened, it is  
with much pain, «nd deep regret  
{ mention, that circumftances of  
a very unwelcome nature have  
Jately occurred. Ovr trade has  
fuffered, and is fuffering exten-  
five injuries in the Weit-Indics,  
from the cruifers and agents of  
the French Republic ; a:.4 com-  
munications have been received  
from its miniller here, which in-  
dicate the danger of further dif-  
turbance of our commerce, by  
its authority ; and which are in  
otherrefpects, far from agreeable.  
  
It has been my conttant, fin-  
cere, and earnelt wifh, in con-  
formity with that of our nation,  
to maintain cordial harmony, and  
a perfeCly friendly underftand-

wilh remains unabated ;-and I

to fulfill it, to the utmoft extent

Delivered to both Houses of Congress, on Wednesday, Dec. 7, 1796.  
  
  
  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives,  
  
N recurring to the internal situation of our country, since 1 had last  
the pleasure to address you, I find ample reason for a renewed exe  
  
pression of that gratitude to the Ruler of the Universe, which a con-  
tinued series cf prosperity has so often and so justly called forth,  
  
The a¢ts of the last session, which required special arrangements,  
have been, as far as circumstances would admit, cartied into operation.  
  
Measures calculated to ensure a continuance of the friendship of the  
Indians, and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier,  
have heen digested anc adopted.—In the framing of these, care has  
been taken to guard, on the one hand, owr advanced settlements frora  
the predatory incursions of those unruly individuals, who cannot.be  
restrained by their tribes; and, on the other hand, to protect the rights  
secured to the Indians by treaty—to draw them nearer to the civilized  
state, and inspire them with correét conceptions of the power, as weil  
as justice of the government. ;  
  
The meeting of the deputies from the Creek aation, at Coleraine,  
in the state of Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase  
of a parcel of their land by that state, broke up without its being accom  
plished ; the nation having previous to their departure, instructed them  
against making any sale: The occasion, however, has been improvec,  
to confirm, by a new treaty with the Creeks, their pre-existing engage-  
  
‘ - . &gt; on. . : ly os  
ments with the United States; and to obtain their consent to the esta-  
blishment

blishment of trading houses, and military posts within their boundaries;  
by means of which, their friendship and the general peace may be more  
effectually secured. | sian’  
  
The period during the late session, at which:the appropriation was  
passed, tor carrying into effect the treaty of amity, commerce, and  
navigation, between the United States and his Britannic Majesty, neces-  
sarily procrastinated the reception of the posts stipulated to be delivered,  
beyond the date assigned for that event. As soon, however, as the  
Governor-general of Canada could be addressed with propriety on  
the subject, arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded for  
their evacuation, and the United States took possession of the princi-  
pal of them, comprehending Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michilima-  
kinac, and Fort Miami, where such repairs.and additions have been  
ordered to be made as appeared indispensible, |  
  
The commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and  
of Great-Britain, to determine which is the river St. Croix, mentioned  
in the treaty of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson,  
Esq; of New-York, for the third commissioner. The whole met at  
St. Andrews, in Passamaquody bay, in the beginning of Oétober,  
and directed surveys to be made of the rivers in dispute; but deeming  
it impracticable to have these surveys completed before the next year,  
they adjourned, to meet at Boston, in August, 1797, for the final de-  
cision of the question.  
  
Other commissioners appointed on the part of the United States,  
agreeably to the seventh article of the treaty with Great-Britain, rela-  
tive to captures and condemnation of vessels and other property, met  
the commissioners of his Britannic Majesty in London, in August  
last, when John Trumbull, Esq; was chosen by lot, for the filth  
commissioner. In Oétober following the board were to proceed to  
business. As yet, there has been no communication of commissiony  
ers on the part of Great-Britain, to unite with those who have been  
appointed on the part of the United States, for carrying into effec  
the sixth article of the treaty. P  
  
The treaty with Spain required that the commissioners for runnmg  
the boundary line between the territory of the United States and his  
Catholic Majesty’s provinces of East and West-Fiorida, should meet  
at the Natches before the expiration of six months after the exchange  
of the ratifications, which was effected at Aranjuez, on the 25th day  
of April; and the troops of his Catholic Majesty occupying any posts  
within the limits of the United States, were, within the same period,  
to be withdrawn. The commissioner of the United States, thereiore,  
commenced his journey for the Natches in September, and troops  
were ordered to occupy the posts from which the Spanish garrison  
should be withdrawn.—Information has been recently received of the  
#ppointment of a commissioner, on the part of his Catholic Maesty;  
for running the boundary line; but none of any appointment for tue  
adjustment of the claims of our citizens whose vessels were captured  
by the armed vessels of Spain. j Doe  
  
In pursuance of the aét of Congress, passed in the just session, !of  
the protection and relief of American seamen, agents were appowilesy

The effects of the agency in the West-Indies are not yet fully ascer-  
tained; but those which have been communicated afford grounds to  
believe the measure will be beneficial. The agent destined ta reside  
in Great-Britain declining to accept the appointment, the business  
has consequently devolved on the minister of the United States, in  
London, and will command his attention, until a new agent shall be  
appointed.  
  
After many delays and disappointments, arising out of the Europe-  
an war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to  
the Dey and Regency of Algiers, will, in all present appearance, be  
crowned with success; but under great, though inevitable disadvant-  
ages in the pecuniary transactions, occasioned by that war, which  
will render a further provision necessary. The actual liberation of all  
our citizens who were prisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every  
fecling heart, is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the  
whole negociation. Measures are in operation for effecting treaties  
with the regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.  
  
To an active external commerce, the protection of a naval force is  
indispensible. ‘This is manifest with regard to wars in which a state  
is itself a party. But besides this, it is in our own experience, that  
the most sincere neutrality is not a sutheient guard against the depreda-  
tions of nations at war. ‘To secure respect to a neutral flag, requires  
a naval force, organized and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggres-  
sion. This may even prevent the necessity of going to war, by dis-  
couraging the belligerent powers from committing such violations of  
the rights of the neutral party as may, first or last, leave no other option.  
From the best information I have been able to obtain, it would seem  
as if our trade to the Mediterranean, without a prote¢ting force, will  
always be insecure, and our citizens exposed to the calamities from  
which numbers of them have but just been relieved.  
  
These considerations invite the United States to look to the means,  
and to set about the gradual creation of a navy. The increasing pro-  
gress of their navigation promises them, at 9 distant period, the requi-  
site supply of seamen; and their means in other respects favor the un-  
dertaking. It isan encouragement likewise, that their particular situa-  
tion will give weight and influence to a moderate Raval force in their  
hands. Wiil it not then be adviseable to begin, without delay, to pro-  
vide and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of ships  
of war; and to proceed in the work by degrees, in proportion as ou  
resources shali render it practicable without inconvenience; so that a  
future war of Europe may not find cur commerce in the siime unpro-  
tected state in which it was found by the present?  
  
Congress have repeatedly, and not without snecess, dire&amp;ted their  
attention to the encouragement of manufaétures. The object is of too  
much consequence not to ensure a continuance of their efforts in every  
way which shall appear eligible. As a general rule, manufactures on  
public account are inexpedient. But where the state of things in a  
country leaves little hope that certain branches of manufacture wail, for  
a great length of time, obtain ;—-when these are of a nature essential  
to the furnishing and equipping of the public force in time of war, are  
not establishments, for procuring them on public account, ta the extent

Ought our country to remain in such cases dependent on ioreign sup-  
pl Ivy precarious, because ben to be interrupted ? If the necessary

public service in time of peace, w all, in time of war, easily be extended

mitigate the privations from the interrupt on of their trade. - if adopt.  
ed, the plan ougiut to exciude ail those branches which are already, or  
likely soon to be established in the country ; in order that there may be  
10 danger of interference with pursuits of individual | industry.  
  
It will not be doubted, that, with reference either to individual or  
national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance. In proportioa  
as nations advance in population, and other circumstances of maturity,  
this truth becomes more ap parent, and renders the cultivation of the  
soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for  
promoting It, grow up supported by the prnic, purse: and to what  
object can it be dedicated with greater p: ‘opriety ? Among the means  
wuich have been employ ed to this end, none have been attended with  
greater success than the establishment of Boards, composed of proper  
characters, charged with colie¢ting and diffusing information, and ena-  
bled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist a  
spir rit of disco very and improvement. ‘This species of “establisament  
contributes doubly to the increase of improvement, by stimulating to  
enterpiize and-experiment; and by drawing to a common centre the  
results every where, of in dividual skill and observation, and spread-  
ing them thence over the whole nation. Experience accordingly has  
shewn, that they are very cheap insttuments of immense national bene-  
fits.  
  
I have heretofore preposed to the consideration of Congress, the ex-  
pediency of estabishing a National University; and also a Military  
Academy. he desireableness of both these institutions has so con-  
stantly increasca with every new view I have taken of the subject, that  
I cannot omit the opportunity of once for all pereting:} your attention  
to them.  
  
The assembly to which I address myself is too enlightened not to  
  
be fully sensible Low much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences  
  
e?  
  
contributes to national presperity and reputation. True it is, that our  
  
country, much to its honor, contains many seminaries of learning,  
highly respectable and useful; bt ut ihe funds upon which they rest, are  
too narrow to command the ablest professors in the different depart  
ments of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplated, though  
they would be exccilent auxiliaries.  
  
Amongst the motives to such an institution, the assimilation of the  
  
WinciDies, Opinions and manners of our countrymen, by the common  
es (on Of a porticn of cur youth, from every quarter, well deserves  
ention. ‘The more liomogeneo. 1s our Citizens can be made in these

a primary object of such a national institution, should be the education  
of our youth in the science of government.—In a republic, what species  
of knowledge can be equally important? And what duty more pres-  
sing on its legisl ature, than to patr onize a P lan for communic: iting it to  
those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country: ?  
  
The institution of a Military Academy is also recommended by co-  
gent reasons. However pacific the general policy of a nation may be,  
it ought never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge  
for emergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character,  
and both would hagard its safety, or expose it to greater evils w hen  
war could not be avoided. Besides, that war might not often depend  
upon itsown choice. In proportion as the observance of pacific max-  
ims might exempt a nation from the necessity of practising the rules of  
the military art, ought to be its care in preserving and transmitting, by  
proper establishments, the knowledge of that art. Whatever argument  
may be drawn irom pa ticular example eS, superficially viewed, a tho-  
rough examination of the subjeét w il ev Ince, that the art of war is at  
once comprehensive and com plicated ; that it demands much previous  
study; and that the possession of it, in its most improved and perfect  
state, is always of great moment to the security of a nape This,  
therefore, ought to be a serious care of every government; and for this  
purpose, an Ac ademy, where a regular course ot Sombie is given,  
is an obvious expedient, which different nations have successtully em-  
ployed.  
  
The compensation to the officers of the United States, in various in-  
stances, and in none more than in respect to the most important sta-  
tions, appear to call for legislative revision.—The consequences of a  
defective provision, are of serious import to the government. If pri-  
vate wealth is to sup ply the deteét of public retribution, it will greatly  
contract the sphere within which the selection of charaéter for office is  
to be made; and will proportionably d iminish the p robability of a choice  
of men able as well as upright. Besides that, it would be repugnant  
to the vital principles of our government, virtually to exclude from  
public trusts, talents and virtue, unless accompanied by wealth.  
  
While in our external relations, some serious inconveniencies and  
embarrassments have been overcome, and others lessened, it is with  
much pain and deep regret I mention, that circumstances of a very  
unwelcome nature have | lately occurred. Our trade has suffered, and  
is suffering extensive injuries, in the West-Indies, from the cruizers  
and agents of the French Republic : and communications have been  
received from its minister here which indicate the danger of a further  
disturbance of our commerce, by its authority; and ‘which are, in  
other re spects, | ar from : earn  
  
It has been my cons tan t, sin ere, and earnest wish, in conformity  
with that o f our nation, to maintain core lial harmony, and a perfectly  
  
friendly underst: anding with that Republic.—This wish remains una-  
  
bated ;—and I shai! persevere in the endeavor to fulfil it to the utmost:  
  
extent of what shall be consistent with a just and indispensible regard,  
&gt; the rights and honor of our country : nor will I easily céase to che-  
rish the ¢: xpeCtation, that a spirit of justice, candor, and friendship, on  
  
the part of the Republic, will eventually insure success. :

668 Monthly Regifter.  
  
In pursuing this course, however, I cannot forget what is due to  
the character of our government and nation, or to the full and entire  
confidence in the good sense, patriotism, self-respect, and fortitude of  
my countrymen.  
  
{ reserve, for a special message,  
on this interesting subject.  
  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
  
[ have directed an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the  
ensuing year, to be submitted from the proper department, with a  
view of the public receipts and expenditures to the latest period to  
which an account can be prepared.  
  
ft is with satisfaction 1 am able to inform you, that the revenues  
of the United States continue in a state of progressive improvement.  
  
A reiniorcement of the existing provisions for discharging our pub-  
lic debts, was mentioned in my address at the opening of the last  
session. Some preliminary steps were taken towards it; the maturing  
of which will, no doubt, engage your zealous attention during the  
present. I will only add, that it will afford me a heart-felt satisfaction  
to concur in such further measures as will ascertain to our country the  
prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the debt. Posterity may have  
catise to regret, if, from any motive, intervals of tranquillity are lett  
unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.  
  
Geutlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives,  
  
My solicitude to see the militia of the United States placed on an  
efficient establishment, has been so often, and so ardently expressed,  
that I shall but barely recall the subje&amp; to your view on the present  
occasion: at the same time that I shail submit to your inquiry, whe-  
ther our harbors are yet sufficiently secured.  
  
The situation on which I now stand, for the last time, in the midst  
of the representatives of the people of the United States, naturally re-  
calls the period when the administration of the present form of govern-  
ment commenced—and I cannot omit the occasion to congratulate  
you, and my country, on the success of the experiment—nor to re-  
peat my fervent suyolications to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe  
and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations, that his providential care may still  
be extended to the United States—that the virtue and happiness of the  
people may be preserved, and that the government, which they have  
instituted for the protection of their liberties, may be perpetual.

perity has fo often and fo juitly called forth.  
  
The acts of the laft feflion, which required fpecial ar-  
rangements, have been, as far as circumftances would ad-  
mit, carried into operation.  
  
Meafures calculated to enfure a continuance of the  
friendthip of the Indians, and to preferve peace along the  
extent of our interior frontier, have been digefted and  
adopted. In the framing of thefe, care has been taken to  
guard on the one hand, our advanced fettlements from  
the predatory incurfions of thofe unruly individuals, who  
cannot be reftrained by their tribes ; and on the other  
hand, to protect the rights fecured to the Indians by trea-  
ty; to draw them nearer to the civilized {tate ; and in-  
{pire them with correct conceptions of the power, as well  
as juftice of the goverument.-  
  
The meeting of the deputies from the Creek nation at  
Coleraine, in the State of Georgia, which had for a princi-  
al object the purchafe of a parcel of their land by that  
State, broke up without its being accomplifhed ; the na-  
tion having, previous to their departure, inftructed them  
again{ft making any fale; the occafion however has been  
improved, to confirm by a new treaty with the Creeks,  
their pre-exifting engagements with the United States ;  
and to obtain their confent to the eftablifhment of trading  
houfes, and military pofts within their boundary; by  
means of which their friendfhip and the general peace may  
be more effectually fecured.  
  
The period during the late feffion, at which the appro-  
priation was pafled, for carrying into effect the Treaty of  
Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United  
States and his Britannic Majefty, neceflarily procraftinated  
the reception of the pofts ftipulated to be delivered, be-

evacuation, and the United States took poffeflion of the  
principal of them, comprehending Ofwego, Niagara, De-  
troit, Michilimackinac and Fort Miami, where fuch re-  
pairs and additions have been ordered to be made as ap-  
peared indifpenfable.  
  
The commiflioners appointed on the part of the United  
States and of Great Britain, todetermine which is the ri-  
ver St. Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace of 1783,  
agreed in the choice of Egbert Benfon, Efq. of New-  
York, for the third commiflioner. The whole met at Sc.  
Andrew&#x27;s, in Paflamaquody Bay, in the beginning of Oc-  
tober, and directed furveys to be made of the riversin dif-  
pute ; but deeming it impracticable to have thefe furveys  
completed before the next year, they adjourned, to meet  
at Bofton in Auguft 1797, for the final decifion of the  
quettion.  
  
Other commiflioners appointed on the part of the Unit-  
ed States, agreeably to the feventh article of the treaty  
with Great-Britain, relative to captures and condemna-  
tion of veffels and other property, met the commiffioners  
of his Britannic majefty in ].ondon, in Auguft laft, when  
John Trumbull, Efg. was chofen by lot, for the fifth com-  
miffioner- In Odtober following, the board were to pro-  
ceed to bufinefs. As yet, there has been no communica-  
tion of commiflioners on the part of Great-Britain,to unite  
with thofe who have been appointed on the part of the  
United States, for carrying into effect the fixth article of  
  
the treaty-  
  
The treaty with Spain required that the commiffioners  
for running the boundary line between the territory of the  
United States, and his Catholic Majefty’s provinces of Eaft  
and Weft Florida, fhould meet at the Natchez before the  
expiration of fixth months after the exchange of the rati-  
fications, which was effected at Aranjuez on the twenty-  
fifth day of April ; and the troops of his Catholic Majef-  
ty, occupying any potts within the limits of the United  
States, were within the fame period to be withdrawn.—  
The commiffioner of the United States, therefore, com-  
menced his journey for the Natchez in September, and  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
( 8 )  
  
troops were ordered to occupy the pofts from which the  
Spanith garrifons fhould be withdrawn. Information has  
been recently received of the appointment of a commif-  
fioner on the part of his Catholic Majefty,for running the  
boundary line ; but none of any appointment for the ad-  
juftment of the claims of our citizens, whofe vefiels were  
captured by the armed veflels of Spain.  
  
Ia purfuance of the a&amp; of Congrefs pafled in the laft fef-  
fion, for the protection and relief of American feamen,  
agents were appointed, one to refide in Great Britain,  
and the other in the Weft-Indies. The effects of the  
agency in the Weft-Indies are not yet fully afcertained ;  
but thofe which have been communicated afford grounds  
to believe the meafure will be beneficial. The agent def-  
tined torefide in Great-Britain declining to accept the  
‘ appointment,the bufinefs has confequently devolved on the  
minifter of the United States, in London, and will com-  
mand his attention, until a new agent fhall be appointed.  
  
After many delays and difappointments arifing out of  
the European war, the final arrangements for fulfilling  
the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Al-  
giers, will, in all prefent appearance, be crowned with  
juccefs ; but under great, though inevitable difadvantages  
‘jn the pecuniary tranfactions, occafioned by that war «  
which will render a further provifion neceflary. The  
actual liberation of all our citizens who were prifoners  
in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling heart, is itfelf  
an earneft of a fatisfactory termination of the whole ne-  
gociatione Meafures are in operation for effecting trea-  
ties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.  
  
To an aétive external commerce, the protection of a  
naval force is indifperfable. This is manifeft with regard  
to wars in which a ftateis itfelf a party. But befiles this,  
it isin our own experience, that the moft fincere neutrality  
is not a fuflicient guard againft the depredations of nations  
at war. To fecurerefpect toa neutral flag, requires a  
naval force, organized and ready to vindicate it from in-  
fult or agoreffion. This may even prevent the neceflity  
of going to war, by difcouraging belligerent powers from  
  
  
  
Oo  
  
committing fuch violations of the rights of the neutral  
party, as may, firft or Jaft, leave no other option. From  
the beft information I have been able to obtain, it would  
feem as if our trade to the Mediterranean, without a pro-  
tecting force, will always be infecure ; and our citizens  
expofed to the calamities from which numbers of them  
have but juft been relieved.  
  
Thefe confiderations invite the United States to look  
to the means, and to fet about the gradual creation of a  
navy: The increafing progrefs of their navigation pro-  
mifes them, at no diftant period, the requifite fupply of  
feamen; and their means, in other refpects, favour the  
undertaking. It isan encouragement likewife, that their  
particular fituation will give weight and influence to a  
moderate naval force in their hands. Will it not then  
be advifable to begin without delay to provide and lay up  
the materials for the building and equipping of thips of  
war; and to proceed inthe work by degrees, in propor-  
tion as our refources fhall render it practicable without  
inconvenience ; fothat a future war of Europe may not  
find our commerce in the fame unprotected {tate in which  
it was found by the prefent?  
  
Congrefs have repeatedly, and not without fuccefs, di-  
rected their attention to the encouragement of manufac-  
tures. The objectis of too much confequence not to en-  
fure a continuance of their efforts in every way which  
fhall appear eligible. Asa general rule, manufactures on  
public account are inexpedient- But where the ftete of  
things in a country leaves little hope that certain  
branches of manufacture will for a greatlength of time  
obtain ; when thefe are of a nature eflential to the fur-  
nifhing and equipping of the public force in time of war ;  
are not eftabliihments for procuring them on public ac-  
count, to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public  
fervice, recommended by ftrong confiderations of national  
policy, as an exception to the general rule? Ought our  
country to remain in fuch cafes dependent on foreign fup-  
ply, precarious, becaule liable to be interrupted ?  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
, iJ  
  
If the neceffary articles fhould in this mode coft more in  
time of peace, will not the fecurity and independence  
thence arifing, form an ample compenfation? Eftablith-  
ments of this fort, commenfurate only with the calls of the  
public fervice in time of peace, will, in time of war, eafily  
be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the govern-  
ment ; and may even perhaps be made to yield a furplus  
for the fupply of our citizens at large, fo as to mitigate the  
privations from the interruptions of their trade. If adopt-  
ed, the plan ought to exclude all thofe branches which are  
already, or likely foon to be eftablifhed in the country ; in  
order that there may be no danger of interference with  
purfuits of individual induftry.  
  
Tt will not be doubted, that with reference either to  
individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary  
importance. In proportion as nations advance in popula-  
tion, and other circumftances of maturity, this truth be-  
comes more apparent ; and renders the cultivation of the  
foil more and more an object of public patronage. Inftitu-  
tions jor promoting it, grow up fupported by the public  
purfe: and to what object canit be dedicated with greater  
propriety ? Among the means which have been employed  
to this end, none have been attended with greater fuccefs,  
than the eitablifhment of Boards, compofed of proper cha-  
ratters, charged with collecting and diffufing information,  
  
and enabled, by, premiums and final] pecuniary aids, to en-  
courage and aflift a fpirit of difcovery andi improvement-—  
This fpecies of eftabliihment contributes doubly to the in-  
creafé of improvement ; by ftimulating to enterprize and  
experiment ; and by drawing toa common centre the re-  
fults every where of individual {kill and obfervation, and  
{preading them thence over the whole nation. Experi-  
ence accordingly has thewn, that they are very cheap in-  
ftruments of immenfe national benefits.  
  
I have heretofore propofed to the confideration of Con-  
grefs, the expediency of eftablifhing a National Univerfi-  
tv; and alfo a Military Academy. ‘The defirablenefs  
of both thefe inftitutions, has fo conftantly increafed with  
every new view I have taken of the fubject, that I cannot  
  
( i )  
  
Morein 4 mit the opportunity of once for all, recalling your atten  
t ‘  
endence tion to them.  
  
ftablith. .  
Is of the The aflembly to which I addrefs myfelf, is too enlight-  
, afily ened not to be fully fenfible how much a flourithing itate  
overn. of the arts and fciences contributes to national profperity  
furplus and reputation. Trueitis, that our country, much to its  
ate the honor, contains many feminaries of learning highly refpec-  
adopt. table and ufeful; but the funds upon which they reft, are  
ch are too narrow to command the ablett profeffors in the diffe-  
Y3 in rent departments of liberal knowledge, for the inftitution  
‘With contemplated : though they would be excellent auxiliaries.  
Amongft the motives to fuch an inftitution, the aflimila-  
T to tion of the principles, opinions and manners of our coun-  
lary trymen, by the common education of a portion of our youth  
ula. from every quarter, well deferves attention. The more  
be. homogeneous our citizenscan be made in thefe particulars,  
the the greater will be our profpect of permanent union; and  
tu- a primary object of fuch a national inftitution fhould be,  
lic the education of our youth in the fcience of government.  
er In a republic, what fpecies of knowledge can be equally  
ed important? And what duty more prefling on its legifla-  
S, ture, than topatronife a plan for communicating it to thofe  
: who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the  
  
, country ?  
  
: The inftitution of a military academy, is alfo recom-  
mended by cogent reafons- However pacific the general  
policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an  
adequate ftock of military know ledge for emergencies.  
The firft would impair the energy of its character, and  
both would hazard its fafety, or expofe it to greater evils  
when war could not be avoided. Befides, that war might  
often not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as  
the obfervance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation  
from the neceflity of practifing the rules of the military  
art, Ought to be its care in preferving and tranfinitting by  
proper eftablijhments, the knowledge of that art. W hat-  
ever argument inay be drawn from part cular examples,  
fuper ficially viewed, a thorough examination of the fub-  
ject will evince, that the art of war is at once comprehen-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
five and complicated; that it demands much previous  
ftudy ; and that the poffeffion of it, in its moft improved  
and perfect ftate, is always of great moment to the fecurity  
of anation. This, therefore, ought to be a ferious care  
of every government ; and for this purpofe, an academy,  
where a regular courfe of inftruction is given, is an ob-  
vious expedient, which different nations have fuccefsfully  
employed.  
  
The compenfations to the officers of the United Staces,  
in various inftances, and in none more than in refpect to  
the moft important ftations, appear to call for legiflative  
revilion- The confequences of a defective provifion are of  
ferious import to the government. If private wealth is  
to fupply the defect of public retribution, it will greatly  
contract the fohere within which the felection of character  
for oflice is to be made; and will proportionally diminith  
the probability of a choice of men, able as well as upright.  
Betides that it would be repugnant to the vital principles  
of our government, virtually to exclude from public trufts,  
talents and virtue, unlefs accompanied by wealth.  
  
While in our external! relations, fome ferious inconve-  
niencies and embarraflments have been overcome, and  
others leflened, it is with much pain, and deep regret, I  
mention, that circumftauces of a very unwelcome nature  
have lately occurred. Our trade has fuffered, and is fuf-  
fering extenfive injuries in the Weft-Indies, from the  
cruizers and agents of the French republic; and communi-  
cations have been received from its minifter here, which  
indicate the danger of a further difturbance of our com-  
merce by its authority ; and which are, in other refpects,  
far from agreeable.  
  
Tt has been my conftant, fincere and earneft wifh, in  
conformity with that of our nation, to maintain cordial  
harmony, anda perfectly friendly underftanding with that  
republic- This with remains unabated ; and | fhall per-  
fevere in the endeavour to fulfil it, to the utmoft exrent  
of what fhall beconfiftent with a juft, and indifpenfable  
regard to the rights and honour of our country : nor will  
I eattly ceafe to cherifh the expectation, that a fpirit of juf-  
  
  
  
( 13 )  
  
tice, candor and friendthip, on the part of the republic, wild  
eventually enfure fuccefs.  
  
In purfuing this courfe, however, I cannot forget what  
is due to the character of our government and nation; or  
to a full and entire confidence in the good fenfe, patriotifm,  
felf-refpect and fortitude of my countrymen.  
  
I referve for a fpecial meflage, a more particular come  
munication on this interefting fubject.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
I have directed an eftimate of the appropriations necef-  
fary for the fervice of the enfuing year, to be fubmitted  
from the proper department ; with a view of the public  
receipts and expenditures to the lateft period to which an  
account can be prepared.  
  
It is with fatisfaction I am able toinform you, that the  
revenues of the United States continue in a ftate of pro-  
greflive improvement.  
  
A reinforcement of the exifting provifions for difcharg-  
ing our public debt, was mentioned in my addrefs at the  
opening of the laft feflion. Some preliminary fteps were  
taken towards it, the maturing of which will,no doubt, en-  
gage your zealous attention during the prefent. I will  
only add, that it will afford me a heartfelt fatisfaction to  
concur in fuch further meafures, as will afcertain to our  
country the profpect of a fpeedy extinguithment of the  
debt. Pofterity may have caufe co regret, if from any mo-  
tive, intervals of tranquillity are left unimproved for acce-  
lerating this valuable end.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the Houfe of  
Reprefentatives,  
  
My folicitude to fee the militia of the United States  
placed on an efficient eftablifhment, has been fo often, and  
fo ardently expreffed, that I fhall but barely recall the fub-  
ject to your view on the prefent occafion ; at the fame  
time that I fall fubmit to your inquiry, whether our har-  
bours are yet fudiiciently fecured.

The fituation in which I now ftand, for the laft time,  
in the midft of the reprefentatives of the people of the U-  
nited States, naturally recalls the period when the admi-  
niftration of the prefent form of government commenced :  
and I cannot omit the occafion to congratulate you, and  
my country, on the fuccefs of the experiment ; nor to re-  
peat my fupplication to the Supreme Ruler of the uni-  
verfe, and Sovereign Arbiter of nations, that his provi-  
dential care may {till be extended to the United States ;  
that the virtue and happinefs of the people may be pre-  
ferved ; and that the government, which they have infti-  
vw for the protection of their liberties, may be perpe-

“ The fituation in which I now fland, for the  
Jat time, in the midft of the Keprefentatives of  
the People of the United States, naturally recalls  
the period when the adminittration of the prefent  
form of Government commenced ; and I can-  
pot omit the occafion to congratulate you, and  
my country, on the fuccefs of the experiment ;  
nor to repeat my fervent fupplications to the  
  
Arbiter of Nations, that his providential care  
may ttillbe extended to the United States ; that  
the virtue and happinefs of the péople may be  
referved 3 amd that the government, which  
they have inftituted for the protection of their  
Liberties, may be perpetual.”

FeJ/onv- Citizens of the Senate,  
and of’the ihuje of R(prejentaii&#x27;v::,  
IN recurring to t he internal fituation of ruf conn­  
try lince 1 had ialt the plealure to addrefs you,  
1 find ample reafon for a renewed ertpreflion of that  
gratitude to the Ruler of the Univerle, which a con­  
tinued feries of profperity has io often and lo juftly  
called forth.  
The acts of the laft fefsion, which required fpe­  
cial arrangements, have been, as far as cirtumfun­  
ces would admit, carried into operation.  
Meafures calculated toenlure a continuance of the  
rriendlhip of the Indians, and to prelerve peace a­  
long the extent of our interior frontier, have been  
• digefted and adopted. In the framing of thel’e, care  
..has been taken to guard, on the other hand, our  
advanced fetrUlnems front the predatory i&#x27;ncurfions

tect the rights iecured to the Indians by treaty } to  
draw them nearer to the civilized hate ; and in -  
fpire them with correct conceptions of the powtr,  
as well as juft ice of the government.  
The Steeling of the ciiputies from the Cret k Na­  
tion at Colerain, in the hate of Georgia, which  
had foCa principal object the purchafe of a parcel  
.of their land by that Hate, broke tip without its be.

their departure intruded them cgainfi making a  
ny fale f the occafion however has been improved,  
to confirm by a new treat) with the Creeks, their  
pre-exiliing engagements with the Unired States ;  
and to obtain their confent to the cltablilhment of  
trading houles, and military pofts within their  
boundaries ; by means of whim, their friendlhip  
and the general peace may be n»ore effectually fc­  
cured;  
The period during the late feffion at which the  
app*opriation was pafsed, forcarryirg into effect  
the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, be­

As iodh however as the Governor General rf  
Canada could be aadre.sed with propriety cu ipe  
lubject, arrangements were cordially and promptly  
concluded tor their evacuation, ard the Lniied  
States took polselsion of the principal of tbtm  
comprehending Olwrgo, Niagara. Detroit, Mi^he.

Oilier conuuiflioncrs appointed on the part of ihe  
United States, agreeably to the ieventh article of  
the treaty with Grtai-Bi itain, relative to captures  
and condemnation of velsels and other property,

on of conintilsiontrs on the part of Great-Britain,  
to unite will) il.ole who have been appointed on  
the part of the United Mates, for carrying into tf­  
ieci the fixth article of the treaty.  
The treaty with Spain required that the conimif.  
lioners for running, the boundary fine between the  
territory of the United Stattsand his Catholic ma­  
j&lt;lty’s provinces of Kafr and Welt Morida, ihctdd  
meet at the Natchez .before the expiration ot fix  
months aftsr the exchange of the raiilitai ions,which  
was effected at. Aranjuex on the tweniv-fifth day of  
April ; and the troops of his Cat holic M je,&#x27;rVj Pc.  
copying any pufts within the limits .of the United  
States, were within the fame period to be with­  
drawn.&#x27; &#x27;I he cotnruiljiontr of the United Struts,  
therefore, commenced .his journey for the Natchez,  
in September, otul troops, were ordered to occupy  
the polls from v/hich the Spanifh garriloo lhouid  
be withdrawn.&quot; Information has been recently re­  
ceived of the appointment of a cormnilsioner on tl:s  
part of his Catltulic majHty.ior running the boun­  
dary line ; but none of any&#x27;appointment for the ad­  
juitmerit of the claims of our citizens, whole vet­  
icls were captured by the arps d velsels of Spain.  
In purfuance of the act of Congreis palscd in the  
1 a ft lefsion, for rhe protection and relief of Ameri­  
can 1‘cameri, agents were appointed, one to rUio&#x27;e in  
Great-Britain, and t|ie other in ,the Wx-fr-Indies.  
The effect&#x27;) ol the agency in the Weft-Indies are not  
yet fully alcertained ; but thole which have been  
communicated afford grounds to believe the mca­  
I&#x27;ure willbe beneficial, &#x27;ihe agent deftined to re*  
licle in Great Britain declining to accept the ap­  
pointment, the buiintls li &gt; conte qutnily devolved  
on the miniiter of the Unitcd States in London,  
and will command his attention, until a new agent  
  
After many delays and difappointmenrs, a riling  
out of the European war, the final arrat&#x27;eancn:s lor  
fulfilling the engagenienis made to the D;y and Re­  
gency of Algiers, will, in all pretem appearance,  
be crowned with (uccrls ; but under great, though  
inevitable diladvantages in J he pecuniary tranlacu­  
ons, occafioned by that war; which will render a  
further provilion necelsary. The actual lihe ration  
of all our citizens who were prifontrs in Aiguis,  
while it gratifies tvery I ceding heart, is it fell an car­  
nelt of a fatislactory lesniinatiori of the win le ne­  
gociation. Mealures are in operation ii*r tfn-efing  
treaties with the Regencies of Tunis and T lipoii.  
To a ri act ive external comtoerce, the protect inti  
of a naval force is indilpenlab&#x27;ie. T his is ntanifeU  
with regard to wars in which a ftate is it.lelf c par-,  
ty. But bolides this, it is in our own experience*  
that the .molt lincere neutrality is not a It-fticien:  
guatd againlt the depredations of nations at war.  
■To fdcure relpect to a national fl.ig, requires a na*  
v:.I force, organ;led, and ready to vindicate it from  
;inlulr or aggrelsion, ri his :n«y even prevent the  
neceflity of going to war, by ’difeouragmg bellige­  
rent powers from copimitting luch violation of ibe  
rights of the neutral party, as may firft or la ft lenv d  
no other option. From the^eft information I have  
been able to obtain, it would lei nt as it our trade to  
the Mediterranean, wit hout n protecting force, w.lt  
always he inlet ore, and ourcinzer* expoiicl to ’he  
calamities from which numbers ft) them have but  
.juit been relieved. &#x27;  
Thefe cotiliderations invite the United Stater fo  
look ro the means, and to fet about the gradual  
creation of a navy. T he encreafing pregreis of  
their navigation promilcs them, at no diltant peri­  
od, the requilite lupply offeanten ; and their means  
in other rctpccts favor the undertaking. It ’• *n  
encouragem: nt likcwil’e, that their particular litua­  
tion will give1 weight and it fluence to a moderate  
naval force in their hands. Will it not then be rd­  
viie&amp;ble to begin without delay to provide and lay  
up the materials for the building and equipping of  
jhips of war „• and to proceed in the work by de­  
grees, in proportion as our relources ihnll render it  
practicable without inconvenience ; lothat a future  
war of Europe niay not find our commerce in the  
fame unprotected ltate in which it was found by

of public retribution, it will greatly contract the  
fphere within which the felection of character for  
office is to be made ; and will proportionally dimi­  
mill the probability of a choice of men, able at well  
as upright. Belides that it would be repugnant to  
the vital principles of our government, virtually to  
exclude from public rrtifrs, talents and virtue, un­  
left adcompaoied by wealth.  
While in our external relations, fome ferious in­

and deep regret, 1 mention, rhat circumftances ofa  
very unwelcome nature, have lately occurred. Our  
trade has ruffered, and is (offering extenlive it juries  
in the Weir-Indies, from the crui/.er*, and* agents of  
i he French Republic ; and communications have been  
received from its mioftter here, which indicate the  
danger of a further d&#x27;Hrurbanee of our commerce by  
its au&#x27;.hori&#x27;.y ; and which &gt;are, in- other relpects,  
far from agreeable.

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, -  
- and of the Houfc of Representatives,  
IN recurring to the internal situation of  
our country since I had last the pleasure to  
address you, I find ample reason for a re­  
newed expreflion of that gratitude to the  
Ruler of the Universe, which a continued  
series of prosperity has so oftenand {o just­  
ly called forth.  
The A&amp;sof the lalt feflion, which re­  
ouired special arrangements, have been, as  
far as circumstances would admit, carried  
1o operation.  
Measures calculated to ensure a continu­  
ance of the friendfhip of the Indians, and  
to preserve peace along the extent cf our  
interior frontier, have been digested and  
adppted, In the framing of thele care  
has been taken to guard on the one hand,  
our advanced settlements from the preda­  
tory incursions of these unruly individuals,  
who cannot be reltrained by their tribes ;  
and on the other hand, to proteét therights  
secured to the Indians by treaty ; to draw  
them nearer to the civilized state—and In.  
spire them with correét conceptions of the  
power, as well as justice of the govern­  
ment.  
  
- The meeting of the deputies from the  
Creek Nation at Coleraine, in the state of  
Georgia, which had fora principal obje&amp;,  
the purchase of a parcel of their land by that  
slate, broke up without its being accom­  
plished ; the nation having previous to  
their departure inftrutted chem against ma­  
king any.fale : The occasion, bowever,  
has been improved, to confirm by a new  
treaty with the Creeks, their pre-exifting  
engagements with the United States ; and  
to obtain their consent to the eflablifhment  
of trading houses, and military posts with­  
in their boundaries ; by means of which,  
their friendthip and the general peace may  
be more effettually secured. -  
The period during the late feflion at  
which the appropriation was palfled, for  
carrying into effeft the treaty of Amity,  
Commerce and Navigation betwecen the  
United States and his Britannic Majelty,  
neceflarily procrastinated the reception of  
the posts fhpulated to be delivered, beyond  
the date afligned for that event. As soon,  
however, 3s the Governor General of Ca­  
nada could be addressed with propriety on  
the fubje, arrangements were cordially  
and promptly concluded for their evacua­  
tion, and the United States took pofleflion  
of the principal of them, comprehending  
Ofwego, Niagara, Detroit, Michelimaki­  
nac and Fort Miami, where such repairs  
and additions have been ordered to be made  
as appeared indispensable.  
The commiflioners appointed on the  
part of the United States and of Great-  
Britain, to determine which is the river  
St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty of  
Peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of  
Egbert Benson, Efg. of New-York, for  
the third commiflioner, The whole met  
at St. Andrews, in Paflamaquody Bay, in  
the beginning of O&amp;tober, and direfted  
surveys to be made of the rivers in dispute ;  
but deeming 1t impralicable to have these  
surveys completed before the next year,  
they adjourned, to meet at Boston, in Au­  
gult 1797, for the final decision of the quel-  
Lion. ’  
  
Other commissioners appointed on the  
part of the United States, agreeably to the  
seventh article of the treaty with Great­  
‘Britain, relative to captures and condem­  
nation of vellels and other property, met  
the commiflioners of his Britannic Majes­  
ty in London, in August last, when&#x27; John  
Trumbull, Efg. was chosen by lot, for the  
hfth commissioner. In Oftober following  
the board were to proceed to -bufinels,  
As yet, there has been no communication  
of commissioners on the part of Great Bri­  
tain to unite with thole’who have beenap­  
pointed on the part of the United States,  
for carrying into effett the sixth article of  
the treaty.  
The treaty with Spain required that the  
Commiflioners for running the boundary  
‘line between the territory of the United  
States and his Catholic Majesty’s provinces  
of Eatt. and W. Florida, should meet at the  
Natchez before the expiration of fix months  
after the exchange of the ratifications,  
which waseffefied at Aranjuez on the 25th  
day of April ; and the troops of his Ca­  
tholic Majelly occupysng any posts within  
the limits of the United States, were with­  
irf the fame period to be withdrawn, The  
commiflioner of the United States, there­  
fore, commenced his journey for the Nat­  
chez in Sept. and troops were ordered to  
occupy the pofls from ‘which the Spanith  
garrison should be withdrawn.—lnforma­  
tion has been recently received of the ap­  
pointment of a Commiflioner on the part  
of his Cailslic Majelly for running the­  
- line ; but none of any appoint­  
ment for the adjustment of the claims of  
our citizens whose veflels were captured  
by the:armed veflels of Spain. o  
In pursuance of the a&amp; of Congrels  
pafied in the last session, for the protegio&#x27;n  
and relics of American seamen, agents’  
were appointed, one to reside .in_ Great-  
Britain, and the other in the Weft-Indies. !  
The effefls of-the agency in the Weft-In-+  
dies are not yet fully ascertained ; but!  
‘thofe which have been communicated as-&quot;  
ford grounds to believe the measure willi  
be beneficial. The agent deflined to re­  
side in Great-Britain declined to accept’  
the appointment, the bufinels has conle­  
&#x27;cnSy devolved on the Minister of ther  
%‘nited’ States in London, and will com­  
mand’ his aitention, until 3 new ageng  
shall be appointed, . - b P &#x27;  
  
A frér matiy delays and disappointments,  
arising out of the European war, the- final  
arrangement for fulfilling the engagements  
made to the De&#x27;Y and Regency of Al­  
giers, will in all&#x27; present appearance be  
crowned with success ; but under great,  
though inevitable&#x27; ‘difadvantages in the  
pgcuniary tranfa&amp;ions, occalioned by that  
war ; which will render a further provi­  
sion necessary. The ‘aftual: liberation’ of  
all our citizens who were prisoners in Al­  
giers, while it gratifies every feeling heart,  
is itlelf an‘earnelt of a fatisfa&amp;lory termi­  
nation of the whole negociatron. Measures  
are in operation for effeéling treaties with  
the regencics of Tutis and Tripoli. -  
To an aftive external commerce, the  
proteétion of a naval force is indilpenfi­  
ble. This is manifeft with regard to wars  
in which a slate is itfelf a party. But be- &#x27;  
‘fides this, itls in our own-experience, that  
the most fiacere neutrality 1s not a fuffi- -  
cient guard against the depredations of na­  
tions at war, - To secure refpett to a neu­  
‘tral flag, requires a naval force, organized  
and ready. to vindicate it from insult or  
aggreflion. This may even prevent the  
neceflity of going to war, by discouraging  
‘belligerent powers from committing such  
‘violations of the rights of the neutral par­  
ty as may, firlt or lafl, leave no. other op­  
tion. From the best information I have  
been able to obtain, it would seem as if  
our trade to the Mediterranean without a  
proteéling force will always be “insecure,  
and our citizens exposed to the calamities  
from which numbers of them have but  
jult been relieved. :  
These considerations invite the United  
States to look to the means, and to set  
about the gradual creation of a navy. The  
increasing progrels of their navigation  
promises them, at no distant period, the  
requisite supply of seamen ; and their  
means 1n other refpeéls favor the underta­  
king, Itis an encouragement likewise,  
that their particular situation will give  
weight and inflaence to a moderate naval  
force intheir hands. Will it not then be  
advifeable to begin without delay, to pro­  
vide and lay up the matenals for the build­  
ing and equipping of ships of war ; and to  
proceed in the work by degrees, in pro­  
portion as our resources shall renderit  
prafticable without inconvenience : so  
that a futare war of Europe may not find  
our commerce in the fame unprotefied  
state, in which it was found by the pre­  
sent ? ;  
  
Congress have repeatedly, and not with­  
out {uccefs, dirc&amp;cf their attention to the  
encouragement of manufaltures. The ob-  
Je€t 1s of too much consequence not to in­  
{ure a contintiance of their efforts in every  
way which shall appear cligible. Asa  
general rule, manufattures on public ac­  
count are inexpedient ; but where the  
state of things in;a country, leaves little  
hope that certain branches of manufatture,  
will, for a great length of time, obtain ;  
when these are of a nature eflential to the  
furnifhing and equipping of ~‘the public  
force in time of war, are not establish­  
ments for procuring them . on publiciac­  
count, to the extent of the ordinaryde­  
mand_for the public service, recommended  
by firong considerations of national policy,  
as an exception to the general rule ?  
Ought our country to rémain, in fuch’ca:  
{es, dependent on foreign supply, preca­  
rious, because liable to be interrupted.  
If the neceflary articles should in this  
mode, cost more ila ume of peace, will  
not the {ecurity and independence thence  
arising, form an ample compensation ? |  
Establishments of this fort, commenf{urate 1  
only with the calls of the public service -  
in time of peace, will, in time of war, |  
cafily be extended in proportion to the ex­  
igencies of the government ; and may even |  
perhaps be made to yield a surplus for the 1  
supply of our citizens at large, so as to mi- l  
tigate the privations from the interruptions |  
of their trade. 1f adopted, the plan ought  
to exclude all those branches which are  
already, or likely soon to be eftablithed  
in the country ; in order that there may be |  
no danger of interference: with pursuits of |  
individual industry, S 3  
It will not be doubted, that with refer­  
ence cither to individual or mnational wels  
fare, Agricultureis of primary importance.  
In progortion as nations advance in popu­  
lation, and other circumstances of maturi­  
ty, this truth becomes more apparent ; and |  
renders the cultivation of the {oil more and  
more an objett of public. patronage. In­  
stitutions for promoting it, grow up sup­  
ported by the public purse ; and to what  
objelt can 1t be dedicated with greater pro­  
priety ? Among the means which have  
been emploved to this end, none have.been  
attended &#x27; with greater f{uccefs, than the  
eftablithment of Boards, composed of pro- -  
per charafters, charged with colie€ting and -  
diffufing information, and enabled by pre- !  
miums and {mall pecuniary aids, to encou- |  
rage and assist a spirit of discovery and im­  
provement ; This species of establishment  
contributes doubly to the increase of im­  
provements ; by stimulating to enterprize  
and experiment ; and by dfawing to a  
common centre the results ‘evéry where, &#x27;  
‘of individual skill and observation, and  
{preading them thence over the whole na-.  
tion, Experience accordingly has shewn,  
that th?{ are very cheap mftrumgnts” of &#x27;  
immenf{e national benefits. &#x27; - 3  
  
1 have heretofore proposed to ‘the consi­  
deration of Congress, -the expediency of  
eftablithing a National University ; and  
also a Military Academy. The defirable­  
nels of both thefle inflitutions, has so con­  
stantly increased with every new view I  
have taken of the fabje€t; that P cannot’  
omit the opportunity of onte for -all, &#x27; re­  
calling your attention to them. &#x27;  
. The Assembly to which 1 addrels my-,  
felf, is too enlightened.not to be fully fen­  
{ible how much a flourifhing, state of the&#x27;  
Ans and Sciences contributes to national  
prosperity and reputation, ~T&#x27;rue it is, that.  
our country, much to its honor, contains,  
many Seminaries of Learning highly re-.  
{pe€lablé and ufeful ; but the funds upon  
which tlfey rest, &#x27;are too ‘narrow: to&#x27; com­  
mand the ablest Profeffors.an the different  
departments of liberal kpowledge, for the  
  
‘inflitutidn contemplated ; though they  
would be excellent auxiliaries, °  
Amonglt the motives 6f {uch an inflitu­  
tion the assimilation of the principles, opin­  
ions and manners of our countrymen by  
the common &amp;ducation of a portion of our  
youth, from every quarter, well deserves  
‘attention. &quot; (The more homogéneous our  
citizens can be made in these particulars,:  
the greater will be our profpe&amp;t of perma­  
nent union ; and a primary obje&amp; of such  
a national inflitution, should be the educa­  
tion of our youth in the fecience of Goverz­  
ment. In a. Republic, what species of  
knowledge can be equally important ? And  
what daty more prefling on its Legislature,  
than to patronize 2 plan fqr- cocmmunica­  
ting it to those who are to be the future  
guardians of the liberties of the country ?  
-The inftitations of a Military Academy,  
is also recommended by cogent reasons,  
However pacific the general policy of a  
nation may be, it ought néver to be with­  
out an adequate flock of military, know­  
ledge for emergencies. The firt would  
impair the energy of its charalter, and both  
would hazard its fafety,” or expose it to  
greater evils when war could nor be avoid­  
cd.—Befides, that war might often not  
depend upon its own choice. - In propor­  
tion as the observance of pacific maxims  
might exempt a nation from the necessity  
of praltifing the rules of the military art, -  
ought to-be its care in preserving and trans­  
mitting by proper establishments, the  
knowledge of that art. . Whatever . argu­  
ment may be drawn from particular exam­  
ples, fuperficially viewed; a thorough ex­  
amination of the fubje&amp;t vill evince that  
the art of war is at once conprehenfive and  
complicated ; that.it demanls much pre­  
vious study ; and that the pofeffion of it,  
in its.moft improved and perfet slate, is  
always of great moment to the security of  
a nation. This therefore ought 0 be a  
serious care of every government ; qnd for  
this purpose, an academy, where a regular  
course of inftrution is given, is an obvious  
expedient, .which different nations have  
fuccefstully empleyed. .  
The.compenfations to the officers of the  
United @tates, in various instances, and in  
none more than in refpeét to the most im­  
portant stations, appear to call for legisla­  
tive revision. The consequences of a de­  
feftive provision are of serious import to.  
the government. If private wealth is to  
{ppply the defett of public retsibution, it&#x27;  
will greatly comra&amp;u the sphere within  
which the {elettion of charatters for office  
1s to he made ; and will proportionally di­  
minith the probability of a choice of men  
able as well as upright. Besides that it  
would be repugnant to the vital principles  
of our government, virtually to exclude  
trom public trufls, talents and virtue, unless  
accompanied by wealth, |  
- While in our external relations, Jome fe­  
7ious. inconveniences and embarrassments  
have been overcome, and others lessened, it  
25 with muck pain, and decp regret I men­  
tion, that circumflances of a very unwelcome  
nature has lately occurrcd. - Qur trade has  
Suffered, and is Juffering extemfive enjurics  
in the Weft-Indies, from the cruizers and  
agents of the Frenck Republic ; and com­  
munications have been received from its Mi­  
nifler, here, whick indicate the danger of a  
Jfurtker disturbance of our commerce, by its  
authority 3 and whick are, in other re-  
Jpelts, far from agreeable. \ :  
It has been my constant, sincere and ears  
nest wifk, in conformity with that of our  
nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and  
a perfellly friendly underfianding with  
that Republic. This wifk remains unabat­  
ed ; and 1 fhiall persevere in the endeavor  
to fulfil it, to the utmost extent of what  
Jhall be consistent with a just, and indifpen-  
Jable regard to the rights and honor of our  
country ; nor will I easily cease to cherish  
the expellation, that a [pirit of justice,  
candour and jfriendfhip, on the part of the  
Republic, will eventually insure success.  
In_purfuing this course, however, I can­  
not_forget what s due to the charaller of  
our government and nation ; or to a full  
and entire . confedence in the good sense, pa­  
triotyfm, felf refpeit and jfortitude of: my

th Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of  
&amp; the Houfe of Representatives,  
In recurring to the internal fituatiori of our  
country fince I had laft the pleafure te addrefs  
you, I find mple resign for a reniwtd expref­  
?ion, of that gratitudeio the Ruler of -the&quot;. Uni­  
vcrfe,, which ar continued feries of profperity  
ha (o often and (0 juttly called forth.  
The acts of the lift feflion which required  
fvccial atrangments, have been, as farascir­  
cumftances would admit, carried into operati  
  
on.  
  
Meafures calculated to erifure a continuance  
of &#x27;the friendfhip of the Indians,, an,4 to pre­  
ferve peace along the extent of our interior fron­  
&#x27; tier, have been digefted and adopted. In the fra­  
$ nung ot thefe,&#x27; care has been taken to guard&quot;  
on the one hand, our advanced fettlements from  
the predatory incurfiont of thofe unruly indi­  
viduals, who cannot be rettrainel by tlieir  
tribe 5 and on the other hand, to protect the  
rights (ecu red to the Indians by treaty j to  
draw them nearer to the ci.vilircd ftate j and  
infpire them with correct conceptions of the  
power, ai well as ju ft ice of the government. ,  
The nieeiing of the deputies from the C&#x27;rtek  
Nation at Coleraine,&#x27; in the ftate of Georgia,  
which had for a principal object the purclule  
of a parcel of their land by that ftate, broks  
tip without iti being accomplilhed ; the nation  
.having previous to their departure instructed  
them againft making any lale : the occalion  
however has been improved, to confirm by a  
new treaty with the Ciceks, their pre exifting  
engagements with the United States ; and to  
.obtain their content to the eltablifhment of tra  
ding houfes, and militaiy polls within their  
boundaries ; by means of which, their friendship  
-and the general peace may be more effectually  
iecured. &#x27;  
The period duting the lar fefllcu at which  
v the appropriation was palled, for carrying into  
frVct the treaty of amity, commerce and navi.  
gatjonj between the United States and his Bri  
tannic Majefty, neceffanly &quot;procrallinated the  
rtception of the polls ftipulated to be delivered,  
beyond the date aifigned for that event.  
As foon however as the Governor: GeneraTof  
&#x27; .Canada could be addreffed with propriety on  
the fubject, arrangements were &#x27;cordialfy and  
promply.concluded for their evacuation, and  
the United States took poffe (lion of the princi  
pal of. them, comprehending Ofwego, Niagara,  
Detroit, Michilimackinak and Fort Mia.  
. mi, where fuch repairs and additions have been

The Commiffioners appoifHedon the p3rt of  
the United States and of Great-Britain, to de­

ed in the treaty of peace of 1783, agreedinthe

for tke third Ccmm ffijner. The whole met  
at St. Andrew&#x27;s, in Paffamaquody Bay, in

Veys to be made 01 the rivers in difpote ; but  
deeming it impracticable to have theL lurveys  
completed before the next year, they adjourned,  
to meet in Bolton, in Auguft 1797, lor the fi­  
nal dfcifion of the queition.  
Other commilfioners appointed on the part of  
the UniteckStates, agreeably to the feventh ar­  
ticle of the treaty with Great. Britain, relative  
to captures and condemnation of vsffels and  
other property, met the comnjiffioners of his

In purfuance oFthe a5l of Con&#x27;grefs-&#x27;jpatTecf  
in the laft feilion, for the protection and relief­  
of American feamen, agents were appointed

in the Weft-Indies are not yet fully alcerta o  
ed j bot thole which have been coinmur.icated  
atferd grounds to believe the mealure will be

on the Minifter of the -United States in L n  
don, and will command his attention, until a  
new agent lhall be appointed. . j  
.After many delays and difappointmenfs,  
Tarifing out of the European war, the fu.il ar.  
rangements for fulfilling the engagements  
made totheDey and Regency of ALgicr, will.  
  
in all prelent appearance, be crowned with (uc  
eels but under great, though inevitable dii  
advantages in the pecuniary tranlactionsocca­  
hond by that war j which will render a further,  
provifion neceffary. The actual liberation ci  
ail our citizens who were pTilboers in Algiers,  
while it gratifies every feeling heart, is itleif  
an earned of a fatisfaclory termination of the  
whole negocation. Meafur&#x27;es are in operation  
for effecting treaties with the Keg nciea ofTu  
nis and Tripoli  
To an alive external commerce, the pro  
teclion of a naval force is indifpenfable. T&#x27;is  
is manifeft wiihicard to wars in which a ftate  
isitLlf a party. But befides this, it is in our  
own cxpsrience.that the moll fincere neutrality  
is not a fufauient guard agiinft the depredati  
ons of nations at wr. To lecure relpect to a  
neutral flag, requires a naval force, organoid  
and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggrel­  
fion. This may even prevent tl.e neccllijy of  
going t war, by difcouraging belligeiert pow­  
ers frorr. committing luch -violations t the  
rsghts of toe neutral party, as. may fir it or laft,  
leave no other option. From the bell informa­  
tion I have been able loobtain, it would ieein  
as if our trade to the Mediterranean,--withoat  
a protedling force, will always b ipfecuie,  
and i-nr citaens expol&#x27;ed to the cahmitirs tjoin  
which numbers or thcin have but jull been re.  
lieved. &quot;&#x27;  
Thefe confiderations invite the United States  
to Jook to the means, and to let about the gra­  
dual creation -of a navy; ; T-he encrcafing pro  
grtfs of thejr navigation promifes them, at no  
diftbnt period, the reqoilite fuply&#x27;of feamen j  
and their means in other reloecti favour the un  
dcrtakmg. It is an encouragement like-i.fe,:  
that their particular fituation will give wrght  
andnfluence to a moderate r.aval force in theu  
hands. Will it not then be advifable to begin  
&#x27;without delay, to provide and lay up the mi

December 7th, 1796.  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the Houſe of Repreſentatives,  
  
IN recurring to. the internal ſituation of our country ſince I had  
laſt the pleaſure to addreſs you, I find ample reaſon for a renewed  
expreſſion of that gratitude to the Ruler of the Univerſe, which a  
continued ſeries of proſperity has ſo often and ſo juſtly called forth.  
  
The acts of the laſt ſeſſion, which required ſpecial arrangements,  
have been, as far as circumſtances would admit, carried into ope ·  
ration,  
  
Meaſures calculated to enſure a continuance of the friendſhip of  
the Indians, and to preſ:rve peace along the extent of our interior  
frontier, have been digeſted and adopted. In the framing of theſe,  
care has been taken to guard, on the one hand, our advanced ſettle-  
ments from the predatory incurſions of thoſe unruly individuals, who  
cannot be reſtrained by their tribes; and, on the other hand, to pro-  
tect the rights ſecured to the Indians by treaty ; to draw them nea  
to the ciyilized ſtate, and inſpire them with correct conceptions  
the power, as well as juſtice of the government.  
  
The meeting of the deputies from the Creek nation at Coleraine,  
in the State of Georgia, which had for a principal object the pur-  
chaſe of a parcel of their land by that State, broke up without its  
being accompliſhed; the nation having, previous to their departure,  
inſtructed them againſt making any ſale ; the occaſion however has  
been improved, to contizm by a _ treaty with the Creeks, their pre ·  
  
  
  
The period during the late ſeſſion, at which the appropriation was  
p_ for carrying into effeft the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and  
  
avigation, between the Uni ed States and his Britannic Majeſty,  
neceſſarily procraſtinated the reception of the poſts ſtipulated to be  
delivered, beyond the date aſſigned for that event.  
  
As ſoon however as the Governor General of Canada could be ad-  
dreſſed with propriety on the ſubject, arrangements were cordially  
and promptly concluded for their evacuation, and the United States  
took poſſeſſion of the principal of them, comprehending Oſwego,  
Niagara, Detroit, Michilimackinac and Fort Miami, where ſuch re-  
pairs and additions have been ordered to be made as appeared indiſ-  
penſable.  
  
The commiſſioners appointed on the part of the United States and  
of Great Britain, to determine which is the river St. Croix, men-  
tioned in the treaty of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert  
Benſon, Eſq. of New York, for the third commiſſioner. The whole  
met at St. Andrew&#x27;s, in Paſſamaquody Bay, in the beginning of Oc-  
tober, and directed ſurveys to be made of the rivers in diſpute ; but  
deeming it impracticable to have theſe ſurveys completed before the  
next year, thev adjourned, to meet at Boſton in Auguſt 1797, for  
the final deciſion of the queſtion. |  
  
Other commiſſioners appointed on the part of the United States,  
agreeably to the ſeventh article of the treaty with Great Britain, re-  
lative to captures and condemnation of veſſels and other property,  
met the commiſſioners of his Britannic Majeſty in London, in Au-  
guſt laft, when John Trumbull, Eſq. was choſen by lot, for the. fifth  
commiſſioner. In October following, the board were to proceed to  
buſineſs. As yet, there has been no communication of commiſſioners  
on the part of Great Britain, to unite with thoſe who have been ap-  
COIs on the part of the United States, for carrying into effect the  
  
xth article of the treaty. |  
  
The treaty with Spain required that the commiſſioners for running  
the boundary line between the territory of the United States and his  
Catholic Majefty&#x27;s provinces of Eaſt and Weſt Florida, ſhould meet  
at the Natchez before the expiration of fix moni hs after the exchange  
of the ratifications, which was effected at Aranjuez on the twenty-  
fifth day of April; and the tro ps of his Catholic Majeſty, occupying  
any poſts within the limits of the United States, were within the ſame  
period to be withdrawn, — The commiſſioner of the United States,  
therefore, commenced his journey for the Natchez in September, and  
troops were ordered to occupy the poſts from which the Spaniſh gar-  
riſons ſhould be withdrawn. Information has been recentiy received  
of the appointment of a commiſſioner on the part of his Catholic  
  
(3-4  
  
Majeſty, for running the boundary line; but none of any appoint»  
ment for the adjuſtment of the claims of our citizens, whoſe veſſels  
  
were captured by the armed veſſels of Spain,  
  
In purſuance of the aft of Congreſs paſſed in the laſt ſeſſion, for  
the protection and relief of American ſeamen, agents were appointed;  
one to reſide in Great Britain, and the other in the Weſt Indies.  
The effetts of the agency in the Weſt Indies are not vet fully aſ-  
certained , but thoſe w hich have been communicated, afford grounds  
to believe the meaſure will be beneficial, Ihe agent deſtined to re-  
fide in Great Britam declining to accept the appointment, the buſi.  
neſs has conſequently devolved on the min ſter cf the United States,  
in London, and will command his attention until a new agent ſhall  
  
be appointed.  
  
After many delavs and diſappointments ariſing out of the Euro-  
pean war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made  
to the Dey and Regency of Algiers, will, in all preſent 1  
be crowned with ſucceſs; but under great, though inevitable, diſad-  
vantages in the pecuniary tr.nſaCtions, ecaſioned by that war; which  
will render a further proviſion neceſſary. The aua liberation of  
all our citizens who were priſoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every  
feeling heart, is itſelf an earneſt of a ſatisfactory termination of the  
whole negociation. Meaſures are in operation for eſſecting treaties  
with the Reyencies of Tunis and Tripoli,  
  
To an active external commerce, the protection of a naval force is  
indiſpenſable. This is manifeſt with regard to wars in which a ſtate  
is irſelf a party. But beſides this, it is in our own experience that  
the moſt ſincere neutrality is not a ſufficient guard againſt the depre-  
dations of nations at war. To ſecure reſpect to a neutral flag, re-  
quires a naval force, organized and ready to vindicate it from inſult  
er aggreſſion. This may even prevent the neceſſity of going to war,  
by diſcouraging belligerent powers from committing ſuch violations  
of the rights of the neutral party, as may, firſt or laſt, leave no other  
option. From the beſt information I have been able to obtain, it  
would ſeem as if our trade to the Mediterranean, without a protect-  
ing force, will always be inſecire ; and our citizens expoſed to the  
calamities from which numbers of them have but juſt been relieved.  
  
Theſe conſiderations invite the United States to look to the means,  
and to ſet about the gradual creation of a navy. The increafing pro-  
eſs of their navigation promiſes them, at no diſtant period, the requi-  
lite ſupply of ſeamen ; and their means, in other reſpects, favour the  
undertaking. It is an encouragment likewiſe, that their particular ſi-  
tuation will-give weight and influence to a moderate naval force in  
their hands. Will it not then be adviſeable to begin without delay  
to provide and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of  
ſhips of war; and to proceed in the work by degrees, in proportion  
as our reſources ſhall render it practicable without inconvenience; ſo  
that a future war of Europe may not find our commerce in the lame  
  
unprotected ſtate in which it was found by the preſent ? |

Congreſs have repeatedly, and not without ſucceſs, directed their  
attention to the encouragement of manutaftures. The object is of  
too much conſequence not to enſure a continuance of their efforts in  
every way which ſhall appear eligible. As a general rule, manu-  
factures on public account are inexpedient. But where the ſtate of  
things in a country leaves little hope that certain branches of manu-  
facture will for a great length of time obtain; when theſe are of a  
nature eſſential to the furniſhing and equipping of the public force  
in time of war; are not eſtabliſhments for procuring them on public  
account, to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public ſervice, re-  
commended by ſtrong conſiderations of national policy, as an ex  
tion to the general rule &gt; Ought our country to remaiu in ſuch caſes  
dependent on foreign ſupply, precarious, becauſe liable to be in-  
terrupted ? |  
  
If the neceſſary articles ſhould in this mode coſt more in time of  
peace, will not the ſecurity and independence thence ariſing, form an  
ample compenſation ? Eſtabliſhments of this ſort, commenſurate only  
with the calls of the public ſervice in time of peace, will, in time of  
war, eaſily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the govern-  
ment; and may even perhaps be made to yield a ſurplu for the my  
Ply of our citizens at large, ſo as to mitigate the privations from  
interruptions of their trade. If adopted, the plan ought to exclude  
all thoſe branches which are already, or likely ſoon to be, eſtabliſhed  
in the country, in order that there may be no danger of interference  
with purſuits of individual induſtry.  
  
It will not be doubted, that with reverence either to individual or  
national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance, In propor-  
tion as nations advance in population, and other circumſtances of  
maturity, this truth becomes more apparent; and renders the culti-  
vation of the foil more and more an object of public patronage. In-  
ſtitutions for promoting it grow up, ſupported by ue public purſe :  
and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propricty ? Among  
the means which have been employed to this end, none have been  
attended with greater ſucceſs than the eſtabliſhment of Boards, com-  
  
ſed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffuſing in-  
  
ormation, and enabled, by premiums and ſinall pecuniary aids, to  
encourage and aſſiſt a ſpirit of diſcovery and improvement.— This  
ſpecics of eſtabliſhment contributes doubly to the increaſe of improve»  
ment, by ſtimulating to enterprize and experiment, and by drawing  
to a common centre the reſults everywhere of individual {kill and  
obſervation, and ſpreading them thence over the whole nation. Ex-  
perience accordingly has — that they are very cheap inſtruments  
  
ofimmenſe national benefits.  
  
J have heretofore propoſed to the conſideration of Congreſs, the  
expediency of eſtabliſhing a National Univerſity ; and alſo a Military  
Academy. The deſireableneſs of both theſe inſtitutions, as ſo.con-  
was | increaſed with every new view I have taken of the ſubject,  
that I cannot omit the opportunity of, once for all, recalling your at-  
rention to them. |  
  
a  
  
The aſſembly to which I addreſs myſelf, is too enlightened not to  
de fully ſenſible how much a flouriſhing ſtate of the arts and ſciences  
contributes to national proſperity and reputation. True it is, that  
our country, much to its honour, contains many {eminaries of learn-  
ing, highly reſpectable and uſeful; but the funds upon which they  
reſt, are too narrow to command the ableſt profeſſors in the different  
departments of liberal knowledge, for the inſtitution contemplated,  
though they would be excellent auxiliaries, |  
  
Amongſt the motives to ſuch an inſtitution, the aſſimilation of the  
principles, opinions, and manners of our countrymen, by the common  
education of a portion of our youth from every quarter, well deſerves  
attention. The more homogeneous our citizens can be made in theſe  
particulars, the greater will be our proſpect of permanent union; and  
a primary object of ſuch a national inſtitution ſhould be, the educa-  
tion of our youth in the ſcience of government. In a blic, what  
ſpecies of knowledge can be equally important? And what duty  
more preſſing on its legiſlature, than to patronize a plan for commu-  
nicating it to thoſe who are to be the future guardians of the liberties  
of the country ?  
  
The inſtitution of a military academy, is alſo recommended by  
cogent reaſons. However pacitic the general policy of a nation may  
be, it ought never to be without an adequate ſtock of military know-  
ledge for emergencies. The firſt would impair the energy of its cha-  
rafter, and both would hazard its ſafety, or expoſe it to greater  
evils when war could not be avoided : beſides, that war might often  
not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as the obſervance of  
pacific maxims might exempt a nation from the neceſſity of —  
the rules of the military art, ought to be its care in preſerving  
tranſmitting by proper eftabliſhments, the knowledge of that art.  
Whatever argument may be drawn from particular exam ſu-  
perficially viewed, a thorough examination of the ſubject will evince,  
that the art of war is at once comprehenſive and complicated; that it  
demands much previous fiudy ; and that the poſſeſſion of it, in its  
moſt improved and perfect ſtate, is always of great moment to the  
ſecurity of a nation. This, therefore, ought to be a ſerious care of  
every government ; and for this purpoſe, an academy, where a regu-  
lar courſe of inſtruction is given, is an obvious expedient, which dif-  
ferent nations have ſucceſsfully employed.  
  
The compenſations to the officers of the United States, in various  
inſtances, and in none more than in reſpect to the moſt important ſta-  
tions, appear to call for legiſlative reviſion, The conſequences of a  
defeCtive proviſion are of ſerious import to the government. If pri-  
vate wealth is to ſupply the defect of public retribution, it will greatly  
contract the {ſphere within which the ſelection of character for office  
is to be made; and will proportionally diminiſh the probability of a  
choice of men, able as well as upright. Beſides that, it would be  
repugnant to the vital principles of our government, virtually to  
  
exclude from public truſts, talents and virtue, unleſs accompanied  
by wealth,  
  
  
While in our external relations ſome ſerious inconveniences and  
embarraſſments have been overcome, and others leſſened, it is with  
much pain and deeper regret, I mention that circumſtances of a very  
unwelcome nature have lately occurred. Our trade has ſuffered, and  
is ſuffering extenſive injuries in the Weſt Ind es, from the cru zers  
and ayents of the French republic ; and communications have been  
received from its miniſter here, which indicate the danger of a fur-  
ther diſturbance of our commerce by its authority ; and which are,  
  
  
It has been my conſtant, fincere, and earneſt wiſh, in conformity  
with that of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and a perfectly  
friendly underſtanding with that republic. This wiſh remains un-  
abated ; and I ſhall perſevere in the endeavour to fulfil it to the ut-  
moſt extent of what ſhall be conſiſtent with a juſt and indiſpenſable  
regard to the rights and honour of our country; nor will I eaſily  
ceaſe to cheriſh the expeCtation, that a ſpirit of juſtice, candour, and  
friendſhip, on the part of the republic, will eventually enſure ſucceſs.  
  
In purſuing this courſe, however, I cannot forget what is due to  
the character of our government and nation; or to a full and entire  
confidence in the good ſenſe, patriotiſm, ſelf- reſpect, and fortitude of  
my countrymen.  
  
I reſerve for a ſpecial meſſage, a more particular communicaticn  
on this intereſting ſubject,  
  
Gentlemen of the Houſe of Repreſentatives,  
  
I have directed an eſtimate of the appropriations neceſſary for the  
ſervice of the enſuing year, to be ſubmitted from the proper depart-  
ment; with a view of the public receipts and expenditures to the  
lateſt period to which an account can be prepared.  
  
It is with ſatisfaction I am able to inform you, that the revenues  
of the United States continue in a ſtate of progreſhve improvement.  
  
A reinforcement of the exiſting proviſions for diſcharging our-pub-  
lic debt, was mentioned in my addrefs at the opening of the laſt ſeſ-  
fion. Some preliminary ſteps were taken towards it; the maturing  
of which will, no doubt, engage your zealous attention during the  
preſent. I will only add, that it will afford me a heartfelt ſatisfac-  
tion to concur in ſuch further meaſures as will aſcertam to our coun-  
try the proſpect of a ſpeedy extinguiſhment of the debt. Poſterity  
may have cauſe to regret, if, from any motive, intervals of tranquillity  
are left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.  
  
T3  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the Houſe of Repreſentatives,  
  
My ſolicitude to ſee the militia of the United States placed on an  
efficient eſtabliſhment, has been ſo often and fo ardently expreſſed,  
that I ſhall but barely recall the ſubject to your view on the preſent  
occaſion; at the ſame time that I ſhall ſubmit to your eaquiry, whe-  
ther our harbours are yet ſufficiently ſecured,  
  
The fituation in which I now ſtand, for the laſt time, ia the midſt  
of the repreſentatives of the people of the United States, naturally re-  
calls the period when the adminiſtration of the preſent form of go-  
vernment commenced ; and I cannot omit the occaſion to congratu-  
late you and my country on the ſucceſs of the experiment; nor to re-  
peat my ſ pplication to the Supreme Ruler of the univerſe, and Sove-  
reign Arb ter of nations, that his providential care may ſtill be ex-  
tended to the United States ; that the virtue and happineſs of the  
people may be preſerved ; and that the government, which they have  
inſtituted for the protection of their liberties, may be perpetual,

to both Houfes of ConGress, December 7, 1796.  
  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of  
the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
1% recurring to the interval fituation of  
  
our country, fince I had iait the plea-  
fure to addrefs you, I find ample reafon  
for a renewed expreflion of that gratitude  
to the Ruler of the Univerfe, which a con-  
tinued feries of profperity has fo often and  
to juitly called forth.  
  
The a&amp;ts of the jaf ion, which re-  
quired fpec.al arrangements, have been,  
as far as circumftances would admit, car-  
ried into operation.  
  
Meafures calculated to enfure a conti-  
nuance of the frendfhip of the Ind ans,  
and to preferve peace along the extent of  
our interior frontier, have been digetted  
and adopted. In the framing of thefe,  
care has heen taken to guard on the one  
hand, our advanced fettlements fron the  
predatory incuriions of thofe unruly indi-  
viduals, who cannot be rettrained by their  
tribes ; and on the other hand, to proteét  
the rights fecured to the Indians by trea-  
ty; todraw them nearer to the civililed  
ftate, and infpire them with correct con-  
ceptions of the power, as well as juttice  
of the government.  
  
Lhe meeting of the deputies from the  
Creek nation at Oolerain in the ttate of  
Georgia, which had tor a principal ob.  
ject the purchale of a parcel of their land,  
by that tate, broke up without its being  
accompitfhed 5 the nation having, previ.  
ous to thar departure, mdructed them a-  
unit making any fale; the occalion,  
owever, has besu improved, to confirm  
  
€  
Q  
  
by a new treaty with the Creeks, theic  
pre-exifting engagements with the United  
States, and to obtain their confent to the  
eltablifhment of trading houfes and mili-  
tary poits within their boundary, by means  
of which their friendfhip and the general  
peace may he more effectuaily fecured.  
  
The period during the late feffion, at  
which the appropriation was pafled for  
carrying into effect the treaty of amity,  
commerce, and navigation between the  
United States and his Bittannic majetty,  
neceflarily procraitinated the reception of  
the potts ttipulated to be delivered beyond  
the date afligned for that event. As foon  
however, as the governor general of Ca-  
nada could be addrefled with propriety on  
the fubject, arrangements were cordially  
and promptly concluded for their evacua-  
tion, and the United States took pollet-  
fion of the principal of them, compre-  
hending Ofwego, Niagara, Detroit, Mi-  
chalimakinac and Fort Miami, where fuch  
repairs and additions have been ordered to  
be nade as appeared inditpeniible.  
  
The commiffioners appointed on the  
part of the Uniied States and of Great  
Britain, to determine which is the river  
St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace  
of 1783, agreed in the choice of Fybert  
Benton, efg. of New York for the third  
commillioner. The whole met at St.  
Andrews Paffaminguodday Bay in. the  
L ¢ aning of OStober, and directed fur-  
veys to be made of the rivers in difpute ;

por , in Auguit lait, when John  
‘Trumbull, efq. was chofen by lot for the  
fitth commiffioner. In Otober follow.  
ing the board were to proceed to bufinefs.  
As yet there has been no communication  
et commifioners on the part of Great Bri-  
tain to unite with thofe who have been ap-  
pointed on the part of the United States,  
tor carrying into effect the fixth article of  
the treaty.  
  
The treaty with Spain required that the  
commilfioners for running the boundary  
line between the territory of the United  
States and his catholic majefty’s provinces  
of Eaft and Weit Florida, thould meet at  
the Natches before the expiration of fix  
months after the exchange of the ratifica-  
tions, which was effected at Aranjuez on  
the 25th day of April; and the troops of  
his catholic maieily occupying any poits  
within the limits of the United States,  
were within the fame period to be with-  
drawn.— The commillioner of the United  
States, therefore, commenced his journey  
from Natches in September, and troops  
were ordered to occupy the pelts from  
which the Spanifh garritons fhould be  
withdrawn. Information kas been re-  
cently received of the appointment of a  
commiflioner on, the part of his catholic  
majetty for running the boundary line,  
but none of any appointment tor the ad-  
juitment of @e claims of our citizens,  
whofe veffels were captured by the armed  
vellels of Spain.  
  
Tn puriuance of the a&amp;t of congrefs,  
paffed in the lait fefion, for the protection  
and rechef of American feamen, agents  
were appointed, one to refide in Great  
Britain, and the other in the Weitt Indies.  
“Phe effeéts of the agency in the Weit In-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
i oe Cite  
dics ave not yet fully alcertatued ; but  
thofe which have been commniunicated af-  
ford grounds ta believe, that the meaiure  
will prove beneficial. The agent deltined  
to refide in Great Britain, declining to  
accept the appointment, the bufineis has  
conleqnently devolved on the muinitter of  
the United States in London; and @ !l  
command hisattention, untd a aew agent  
fhall be appointed.  
  
After many de ays and di. appointzent  
  
sale Bares  
  
arifing out of the European war, the finaf  
arrangements for fulfilling the engage-  
ments made to the dey and regency of  
Algiers, will, in all prefent appearance,  
be crowned with fuccefs ; but under great,  
though inevitable difadvantages, in the  
pecuniary trantactions occationed by that  
war ; which will render a further provifion  
neceflary. ‘he aétual liberation of ail  
our citizens who were prifoners in Algiers,  
while it gratifies every fecling heart, is it-  
fclf an carnett of a fatistactory termina-  
tion of the whole negoctation.  
  
Meafures are in operation for effeting  
treaties with the regencies of Tunis and  
Tripoli.  
  
To an a&amp;tive external commerce, the  
protection of a naval force is indifpentfable.  
This is manifeit with regard to wars in  
which a ttate is itfelf a party, but befide  
this, it is in our own experience, that the  
mott fincere neutrality is not a fufficient  
guard againft the depredations of nations  
atwar. To fecure refpe&amp;t to a neutrat  
flag requires a naval force, organized and  
ready to vindicate it from indult or ag-  
grefion. This may even prevent the  
necellity of going to war, by difcouraging  
belligerent powers from committing fuch  
violations of the rights of the neutral  
party, as may, firft or laft, have no other  
opticn.—From the beft information I  
have becn able to obtain, it would feem  
as if our trade tothe Mediterranean, with-  
out a protecting force, will always be in-  
fecure ; and our citizens expofed to the  
calamitics, from which numbers of them  
have but juft been relieved.  
  
Thefe contiderations invite the United  
States to —_ to the means and to fet  
about the gradual creation of anavy. The  
increafing progrefs of their navigation  
promifes them, at no diitant period, the  
requiite fupply of feamen ; and their  
means in other re{peéts favour the under-  
taking. It is an encouragement likewile,  
that their particular fituation will give  
weight and intluence to a moderate naval  
force in their hands. Will it not then be  
advilfeable to begin without delay to pro-  
  
ide and lay up the materials for the build-  
ing and equipping fhips of war; and to  
208 in the work by degrees, in pro-  
on as our refources fhail render it  
practic able, without inconvenience; fo  
that.a future war of Europe may not &quot;find

FOR JANUARY, 1797:  
  
the encouragement of manufs&amp;ures.—  
The obje&amp; is of too much confequence  
not to infure a continuance cf their efforts,  
ir every way which fhal! appear eligible.  
As a general rule, manufactures on pub-  
lic accounts are inexpedient. But where  
the ftate of things in a country leaves lit-  
tle hope that certain branches of manu-  
faGure will, for a great length of time,  
obtain ;—when thefe are of a nature ef-  
fential to the furnifhing and equipping of  
the public force in the time of war, are  
not eftablifhments for procuring them on  
public Account to the extent of the ordi-  
nary demand for the public fervice, te-  
commended by ftrong confiderations ot  
national policy, as an exception to the  
general rule? Ought our country to re-  
main in fuch cafes dependent on foreign  
fupply, precarious, becaule liable to be  
interrupted ? If the neceflary articles  
fhould is this mode coft more in time of  
peace, will not the fecurity and independ-  
ence thence arifing form an ample com-  
penfation ? Eftablifhments of this fort,  
commenfurate only with the calls of the  
public fervice in the time of peace, will,  
sn the time of war, eafily be extended in  
proportion to the exigencies of the govern-  
ment, and may even perhaps be made to  
yield a furplus, for the fupply of our citi-  
zens at large; fo as to mitigate the priva-  
teers from the interruption of their trace.  
If adopted, the plan ought to exclude ail  
thofe branches which are already, or likely  
foon to be eftablifhed in the country, in  
order that there may be no danger of in-  
terference with puriuits of individual in-  
duttry.  
  
It will not be doubted, that with re-  
ference either to individual or national  
welfare, agriculture is of primary import-  
ance. In proportion as nations advance  
in population, and other circumftances of  
maturity, this truth becomes more appa-  
rent, and renders the cultivation of the  
foil move and more an objeét of public pa-  
tronage. Inftitutions for promoting it grow  
up, fupported by the public purfé ; and  
to what obje&amp; can it be dedicated with  
greater propriety? Among the means  
which have been employed to this end,  
none have been attended with greater Luce  
cefs than the eftablifhment of boards, com-  
poled of proper characters, charged with  
collecting and diffufing intormation, and  
enabled, by premiums and fmall pecu-  
niary aids, to encourage and aflift a {pirit  
of difcovery and improvement. This  
fpecies of eftablifhnent, contributes dou-  
bly to the increafe of improvement ; by fti-  
  
&#x27;  
  
65  
  
mulating to enterprife and experiment,  
and by drawing to a common centre the  
refults every where of individual {kill and  
obfervation, and {preading them thence  
over the whole nation. Experience ac-  
cordingly has fhewn, that they are very  
¢heap inftruments of immenfe national  
benefits.  
  
I have heretofore propofed to the con-  
fideration of congrefs the expediency of  
eftablithing a national univerfity, and alfo  
a military academy. The defirablenefs  
of both thefe inftitutions has fo conftantly  
increafid withevery new view T have taken  
of the fubje&amp;, that I cannot omit the op-  
portenity of once for all recalling your at-  
leniicn to them.  
  
The aflembly to which I addrefs my-  
felf is too enlightened not to be fully fen-  
fible how much a flourifhing ttate of the  
arts and f{ciences contributes to national  
profperity and reputation, ‘True it is,  
that our country, much to its honour,  
contains many feminaries of learning,  
highly refpe@able and ufeful; but the  
funds upon which they reft are too yarrow  
to command the ablett profeffors in the  
different departments of liberal knowledge  
for the inftitution contemplated, though  
they would be excellent auxiliaries.  
  
Among the motives to fuch an inftitu-  
tion, the affimilation of the principles,  
Opinions, and manners of our country-  
men, by the common education of a por-  
tion of our youth from every quarter, well  
deferves attention. ‘The more homogene-  
ous our citizens can be made in thefe par-  
ticulars, greater will be our profpect of  
permanent union ; and a primary obje&amp;  
of fucha national inftitution fhould be, the  
edugation of our youth in the fcience of  
government. Ina republic, what f{pecies  
ot knowledge can be equally important :  
and what duty more prefling on its legifla-  
ture, than to patronize a plan for com-  
municating it to thofe who are to be the  
future guardians of the liberties of the  
country ? :  
  
The inftitution of a military academy  
is slfo recommended by cogent reafons.  
However pacific the general policy of a  
nation may be, it ought never to be with-  
out an adequate ftock of military know-  
ledge for emergenciss. The firft would  
impair the energy of its charagter, and  
both would hazard its fafety, or expofe it  
to greater evids when war could not be  
avoided.—-Befides, that war might not  
often depend upon its own choice, In  
proportion as the obfervance of pacific  
— might exempt a nation from the  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
neceffity of pra&amp;tifing the rules of the mi-  
litary art, thefe ought to be its care in  
prelerving, and tranfinitting by proper  
eltablithments, the knowledge of that art.  
Whatever argument may be drawn from  
particular examples, fuperficially viewed,  
a thorough examination of the fubje&amp; will  
evince that the art demands much previous  
ftudy, and that the poffeflion of it, in its  
moft improved and perfect ttate, is always  
of great moment to the fecurity of a ma-  
tion. This therefore ought tobe a ferious  
care of every government; and for this  
purpew an academy, where a regular  
courte of inftrudtion ts given, is an obvious  
expedient, which different nations have  
fucecisfully employed.  
  
The compentation to the officers of the  
United States, in various inftances, and  
in none more than in refpeét to the moft  
important ftations, appear to call for le-  
giflative revilion. The confequences of a  
defeQlive provition are of ferious import  
to the guverninent.  
  
If private wealth is to fupply the defect  
of public retribution, it will greatly con-  
traét the fphere within which the fele&amp;tion  
ef charaéier for office is to be made, and  
will proportionally diminifh the probabi-  
lity of a choice cf men, able as well as  
upright. Befide that, it would be re-  
j pugnant to the vital principles of our ga-  
| vernment, virtually to exclude from pub-  
{ Sic trutts, talents and virtue, unlefs ac-  
/ companied by weaith.  
  
While in our external relations, fome  
@rious inconveniencies and embarraff-  
ments have heen overcome, and others lef-  
jened, it is with much pain, and deep re-  
gret, I mention, that circumftances of a  
very unwelcome nature have lately oc-  
\ eurred. Our trade bas fuffered, and is  
  
fuffering, extenfive injuries in the Weit  
  
Indies, from the cruifers and agents of  
  
the French republics and communica-  
  
“tions have been received from its minitter  
  
here, which indicate the danger of a fur-  
  
ther difturbance of our commerce, by its  
  
/ authority, and which are in other refpeéts  
tar from agreeable.  
  
{ It has been my conftant, fincere, and  
  
! earneft wilh, in conformity with that of  
  
Our nation, to maintain cordial harmony,  
  
and a perfectly triendly underftanding with  
  
} the republic. This with remains un-  
  
abated ; and I fhali perievere in the en-  
  
dcavour to fulfil it, to the utmoft extent  
  
of what fhall be contiltent with a juft and  
  
indiipenfable regard to the rights and ho-

In purfuing this courfe, however, I  
cannot forget what is due to the character  
of our government and nation; or to 2  
full an entire confidence in the good fenfe,  
patriotifin, felt-refpe&amp;t, and fortitude of

Gentlemen of the Houfe of Repre+

I have direéted an eftimate of the ap-  
propriations neceflary for the fervice of  
the enfuing year to be fubmitted from the  
proper department, with a view of the  
public receipts and expenditures, to the  
latett period to which an account can be  
prepared.  
  
It is with {atisfa&amp;tion I am able to in-  
form you, that the revenues of the United  
States continue in a ftate of progreflive  
improvement.  
  
A reinforcement of the exifting pro~  
vifions for diicharing our public debt,  
was mentioned in my addrefs at the  
opening of the Jaft feffion. Some pre-  
liminary fteps were taken toward it, the  
maturing of which will, no doubt, en~  
gage your zealous attention during the  
prefent.—I will only add, that it will af-  
tord mea heart-felt fatisfaction, to concur  
in fuch further meafures, as will afcertain  
to our country the profpeét of a fpeedy,  
extinguifhment of the debt.—Poiterity’  
may have caufe to regret, if from any moe  
tive, intervals of tranquillity are left un-  
  
improved for accelerating this valuable _  
  
end,  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of  
the Houtfe of Reprefentatives.  
  
My folicitude to the militia of the  
United States placed on an efiicient elta-  
bhfhment, has been fo often and fo ar-  
dently exprefled, that I fhall but barely  
recal the fubject to your view on the pre-  
fent occafion : at the fame time that I fhall  
fubmit to your inquiry, whether our har-  
bours are yet fufficiently fecured ?  
  
The fituation in which I now ftand, for  
the lafttime, in the midit of the repre-  
fentatives of the people of the United  
States, naturally recalls the period, when  
the adminiftration of the prefent form of

The inftitution of a Military Academy, he alfo obferves, is recom  
mended by cogent reafons. Howeyer pacific, fays he, the gencral polic;  
of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate ftock ¢/  
military knowledge, foremergencies. Whatever argument may be draw,  
from particular, examples, faperficially viewed, a thorough examination «|  
the fubject, will evince that the art of war is at once comprehenfive 2»;  
complicated; that it demands much previous ftudy; and that the polit  
fion of it, in its moft improved and perfect ftate, is always of great m.  
ment to the fecurity of a nation.  
  
The following important paragraph is verbatim, “ ‘The compenfations  
to the Officers of the United States, in various inftances, and in none  
more than in refpe&amp; to the moft important ftations *, appear to call f+  
legiflative revifion. ‘The confequences of a defective provifion are of  
ferious import to the government. If private wealth is to fupply the de.  
fe&amp; of public contribution, it will greatly contra&amp;t the fphere, within  
which the felection of character for office is to be made, and wi!! pro.  
portionably diminifh the probability of a choice of men able, as well 2  
upright. Befides, that it would be repugnant te the vital princip!s  
of our government, virtually to exclude from public trufts, talents and  
virtue, unlefs accompanied by wealth.”

nejday, the “th December, 1796.  
  
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and  
of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
IN recurring to the internal fitu-  
ation of our country, fince I had  
laft the pleafure to addrefs you, I  
find ample reafon for a renewed ex-  
preflion of that gratitude to the ru-  
ler of the univeric, which a conti-  
nued feries of profperity has 0 often  
  
and fo juftly called forth,  
  
The. acts of the lat fethen, which  
required {pecial arrangements, have  
been, as far as circumftances would  
admit, carried into operaticn.  
  
Meafurescalculated toenfure a con-  
tinuance of the friendfhip of the Indi-  
ans, &amp; to preferve peace along the ex-  
tent of our interior frontier, have been  
digeited and adopted. In the fram-  
ing of thefe, care has been taken to  
guard on the one hand our advanced  
fettlements from the predatory incur-  
fions of thofe unruly individuals,  
who cannot be reltrained by their  
tribes; and on the other hand, to  
peprect the rights fecured to the In-  
dians by treaty ; to draw them near-  
er to the civilized {tate ; and infpire  
them with correét conceptions of the  
power, as well as juitice of the go-  
yernment.  
  
The meeting of the deputies from  
the Creek nation at Eclerein, in the  
fiate of Georgia, which had for a  
principal object the purchafe of a  
parcel of land, by that ftate, broke  
up without its being accomplithed  
the nation having, previous to their  
departure, inftructed them againtt  
making any fale: the occafion, how-  
ever, has been improved, to confirm  
by a new treaty with the Creeks their  
pre-exiliting engagements with the  
United States, and to obtain their  
confent to the eftablifhment of tra-  
ding houies and military poits with-

Univerfe, which a continued feries of profperity has fo often  
and fo juftly called forth.  
  
The aéts of the laft feflion, which required {pecial arrange  
ments, have been, as far as circumftances would admit, carried  
into operation.  
  
Meatures calculated to enfure a continuance of the friend-  
fhip of the Indians, and to preferve peace along the extent of  
our interior frontier, have been digefted and adopted. In the  
framing of thefe, care has been taken to guard on the one  
hand, our advanced fettlements from the predatory incurfions  
of thofe unruly individuals, who cannot be reltrained by their  
tribes; and on the other hand, to protec the rights fecured to  
the Indians by treaty; to draw them nearer to the civilized  
ftate, and infpire them with corre conceptions of the power  
as well as juftice of the government.  
  
The meeting of ‘the deputies from the Creek nation at  
Oolerain, in the State of Georgia, which had for a principal  
obje&amp;t the purchafe of a parcel of their land by that ftate,  
broke up without its being accomplifhed ; the nation having,  
previous to their departure, inftructed them againft making  
any fale; the occafion, however, has been improved, to con-  
firm by a new treaty with the Creeks, their pre-exifting en=  
gagements with the United States, and to obtain their confent  
to the eftablifhiment of trading houfes and military pofts within  
their boundary, by means of which their friendfhip and the  
general peace may be more effetually fecured.  
  
The period during the late feflion, at which the appropriation  
was pafled, for carrying into effect the treaty of amity, com-  
merce, and navigation, between the United States and his Bri-  
tannic Majefty, neceflarily procraftinated the reception of the  
poits ftipulated to be delivered beyond the date affigned for  
that event. As foon, however, as the Governor-General of  
Canada could be addreffed with propricty on the fubject, ar-  
rangements were cordially and promptly concluded for their  
evacuation, and the United States took poffeffion of the prin-  
cipal of them, comprehending Olwego, Niagara, Detroit,  
Michalimakinac, aid Fort Miami, where fuch repairs and ad-  
ditions have been ordered to be made as appeared indifpenfable.  
  
The Commiffioners appointed on the part of the United

The treaty with Spain required that the Commiffioners for  
running the boundary line between the territory of the United  
States and his Catholic Majefty’s provinces of Eaft and Weft  
Florida, fhould meet at the Natches, before the expiration of  
fix months after the exchange of the ratifcations, which was  
effe&amp;ted at Aranjuez on the 25th day of April, and the troops  
of his Catholic Majefty occupying any pofts within the limits  
of the United States, were within the fame period to be with  
drawn. The Commiffioner of the United States, therefore,  
commenced his journey for the Natches in September, and  
troops were ordered to occupy the pofts from which the Spae  
nifh garrifon fhould be withdrawn. Information has been re  
cently received of the appointment of a Commiilioner on the  
part of bis Catholic Majefty for running the boundary line,  
but none of any appointment for the adjuitment of the claims  
of our citizens, whofe veilels were captured by the armed vels

were appointed, one to refide in Great Britain, and the other  
inthe Weft Indies. The effe&amp;s of the agency in the Weft  
Indies are not yet fully afcertained; but thofe which have been  
communicated afford grounds to believe the meafure will be  
beneficial, ‘The agent deftined to refide in Great Britain de~

68 THE WEEKLY ENTERTAINER,  
  
After many delays and difappointments arifing out of the  
European war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engages  
ments made to the Dey and regency of Algers, will, in all  
pref ent appearance, be crowned with fuccefs ; but under great,  
though inevitab le difadvantages, in the pecuniary tranfactions,  
occafioned by that war ; which will render a further provifion  
necetlary. The aétual liberation of all our citizens who were  
prifoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling heart, is  
itlelf an earneft of a fatisfaQory termination of the whole  
negociation,  
  
Meafures are in operation for effecting treaties with the re-  
gencies of Tunis and Tripoli.  
  
To an active external commerce, the protetion of a naval  
force isindifpenfable. ‘This is manifeft with regard to wars,  
in which a flate is itfelf a party; but befides this, it is in our  
own experience, that the moft fincere neutrality is nota fuf-  
ficient guard againft the depredations of nations at war. To  
fecure refpect toa neutral flag, requires a naval foree, organized  
and ready to vindicate it from infult or aggreflion, This may  
even prevent the neceflity of going to war, by difcouraging  
belligerent powers from committing fuch violations of the  
right of the neutral party, as may, firit or Jaft, leave no other  
option. From the beft information I have been able to obtain,  
it would feem as if our trade to the Mediterranean, without a  
protecting force, will always be infecure ; and our citizens  
expofed to the calamities from which numbers of them have  
but jutt been relieved. Thefe confiderations invite the United  
States to look to the means, and to fet about the gradual crea-  
tion of a navy. The increafing progrefs of their navigation  
promiies them, at no diftant period, the requifite fupply of fea-  
men; and their means in other refpecis, favour the under-  
taking. It isan encouragement likewife, that their particular  
fituation will give weight and influence to a moderate naval  
force in their hands. Will it not then be advifable to begin  
without delay, to provide, and lay up the materials for the  
building and equipping of fhips of war; and to proceed in the  
work by degrees, in proportion as our refources fhall render it  
practicable, without inconvenience; fo that a future war of  
Europe may not find our commerce in the fame unprotected  
ftate in which it was found by the prefent?  
  
Congrefs have repeatedly, and not without fuccefs, directed  
their attention to the encouragement of manufactures, ‘The  
object is of too much confequence, not to infure a continuance  
of their efforts in every way which fhall appear eligible. As

dient. But where the ftate of things in a country leaves little  
hope that certain branches of manufacture will for a great  
length of time obtains when thefe are of a nature effential to  
the furnifhing and equipping of the public force in the time  
of war, are not eftablifhments for procuring them on public  
account to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public  
fervice, recommended by ftrong confiderations of national  
policy, as an exception to the general rule ?—Ought our  
country to remain, in fuch cafes, dependent on foreign fupply,  
precarious, becaufe liable to be interrupted ? If the neceflary  
articles fhould in this mode coft more in time of peace, will  
not the fecurity and independence, thence arifing, form an  
ample compenfation ? Eftablifhments of this fort, commenfu-  
rate only with the calls of the public fervice in the time of  
peace, will, in time of war, eafily be extended in proportion  
to the exigencies of the government, and may even perhaps be  
made to yield a furplus, for the fupply of our citizens at large 5  
fo as to mitigate the privateers from the interruption of their  
trade. If adopted, the plan ought to exclude all thofe branches  
which are already, or likely foon to be eftablifhed in the coun-  
try, in order that there may be no danger of interference with  
purfuits of individual induftry.

¥ T will not be doubted, that with reference either to indivi«  
SK dual or national welfare, agriculture is &lt; f primary mapa  
ance. Ia proporticn as nations advance in population, and  
other circumftances of maturity, this truth becomes more ap-  
parent, and renders the cultivation of the foil more and  
more an object of public patronage. Inftitutions for pro-  
moting it grow ups fupported by the public purfe; and to  
what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety ?- Among

liberal knowledge, for the inftitution contem plated, though  
they would be excellent auxiliaries,  
  
Amongtt the motives to fuch an inftitution, the affimnilation  
of the wineiolct, opinions, and manners of our countrymen,  
by the common education of a portion of our youth from  
every quarter, weil deferves attention. ‘The more homoges  
neous our citizens can be made, in thefe particulars, the greater  
will be our profpeét of permanent union; and a primary o&#x27; ject  
of fuch a national inftitution fhould be, the education of our  
youth in the fcience of government. Ina — what  
fpecics of knowledge can be equally important? and what  
duty more preffing on its legiflature, than to patronize a plan  
for communicating it to thofe who are to be the future guar  
dians of the country?  
  
The inftitution of a Military Academy is alfo recome  
mended by cogent reafons. However pacific the general  
policy of a nation may ” it ought never to be etthew! an  
  
adequate {tock of military kno eds ge foremergencies. The  
firft would impair the energy of its chara@er, and both would  
hazard its fafety or expole it to greater evils when war could  
not be avoided. Gefides, that war might often not depend  
  
  
  
upon itsown choice. In proportion as the obfervance oi pa-  
cific maxims might exempt a nation from the neceffity of  
practifing the rules of the military art, ought to be its care in  
preferving, and tranfmitting, by proper eftablifaments, the  
knowledge of that art. What ver arcument m ay be drawn

tion of character for office is to be made, and will proportion-  
ally diminifh the probability of a choice of men, able as well  
as upright. Befides that, it would be repugnant to the vital  
principles of our government, virtually to exclude from public  
trufts, talents and virtue, unlefs accompanied by wealth.  
  
While in our external relations, fome ferious inconveniencies  
and embarrafiments have been overcome, and others leffened, it  
is with much pain, and deep regret, I mention, that circum-  
ftances of a very unwelcome nature have lately occurred.  
Our trade has fuffered, and is fuffering, extenfive injuries in  
the Weft Indies, from the cruizers and agents of the French  
republic ; and communications have been reccived from its  
Minifter here, which indicate the danger of a further difturb-  
ance, of our commerce, by its authority, and which are, in  
other refpects, far from agreeable.  
  
Ithas been my conitant, fincere, and earneft with, in confor-  
mity with that of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony,  
anda perfectly friendly underftanding with that republic. This  
wifh remains unabated; and I fhall perfevere in the endeavour  
to fulfil it, to the utmoft extentof what fhall be confiftent with  
a juft and indifpenfable regard to the rights and honour of our  
country; nor will I eafily ceafe to cherifh the expectation,  
that a {pirit of juftice,candour, and friendfhip, on the part of  
the republic, will eventuaily enfure fuccefs,  
  
In purfuing this courfe, however, I cannot forget what is  
due to the character of our government and nation; or to a  
full and entire confidence in the good fenfe, patriotifm, felf-re=  
fpect, and fortitude of my countrymen.  
  
I referve for a fpecial meflage, a more particular communi-  
cation on this interefting fubject.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
Ihave direSted an ettimate of the appropriations neceflary  
for the fervice of the enfuing year, tobe fubmitted from the  
proper department, with a view of the public receipts and ex-

prepa:ei.  
  
It is with fatisfaétion I am able to inform you, that the re-  
venues of the United States continue in a ftate of progrefiive  
improvement.  
  
A reinforcement of the exifting provifions for difcharging  
our public debt, was mentioned in my addrefs at the opening

My fclicitude to fee the militia of the United States placed

exprefied, that I fhall but barely recail the fubject to your view  
on the prefent occafion; at the fame time that I fhall fubmie  
to your inquiry, whether our harbours are yet {ufficiently  
fecured ?  
  
The fituation in which I now ftand, for the laft time, in  
the midft of the Reprefentatives of the people of the United  
States, naturally recalls the period, when the adminiftration of  
the prefent form of government commenced ; and I cannot  
omit the occafion, to congratulate you and my country on the  
fuccefs of the experiment ; nor to repeat my fervent fupplica-  
tions to the Supreme Ruler of the Univerfe, and Sovereign  
Arbiter of Nations, that his provideatial care may fill be exe  
tended to the United States ; that the virtue and happinefs of  
the people may be preferved ; and that the government which  
my have inftituted, for the protection of their liberties, may  
be perpetual.

over the whole Nation. Expciience ac¬  
cordingly has (hewn, that they arc very  
chejp inilnimcnts of immenfe national  
benefits.  
  
1 have heretofore propofed to the confi-  
deratlon of Congiefs, the expediency of  
ettablifhing a National Univeruty; and alfo  
a Military Academy. The dcrneableners  
tf both thefe IniHtutiuns has fo con-  
ftintly incrcaled with every new view I  
bare taken of the fubjetift that I cannot  
omit tlie opportunity of once for all recal-  
bng yonr attention to them.  
  
The Alfembly to which 1 addrefs my-  
fclf is too enlightened* not to l&gt;e fully  
fenlible how much a flourifliing date of  
tlie Arts and Sciences contributes to na¬  
tional profpcrliy and reputation.—Titic  
it is, that our Country, much to its  
honour, contains many Stiniiiarics of  
Learning highly refpc^lablc and ureful ;  
but the funds upon which thev rrd arc  
too narrow to command the ablctl Pro-  
fenWs in the differcnl departments of lil&gt;e-  
ral knowledge, for the InlHtutidn con¬  
templated, though they would be excellent  
auxiliaries.  
  
Amongll the motives to fuch an Infli-  
tution, the adimilation of the pr nciples,  
•pillions, and manners of our Country¬  
men, by the common education of a por¬  
tion of our youth from every quaricr,  
•ell deferves attention. I&#x27;he more ho¬  
mogeneous our Citizens can be made,  
in thefe particulars, the greater will be  
our prol&#x27;^Ki^f of permanent union} and a  
piimary ubjeft of fucli a National Indi-  
tution Ihould be, the education of our  
youth in the fcience of Government. In  
a Republic, what fpecits ot knowledge can  
be equally important, and what duty  
more prciiing on. its Legiilaiure, than  
to patronize a plan for communicating  
It to thole, wito are to be the future  
guardians of the Liberties of the Coun¬  
try ?  
  
The inftituiionof a Military Academy  
is alio recommended by cogent rcalbn*..  
However pacific the general policy cf  
a N..tiun nuy be, it ought never to be  
without an adequate flock of Military  
knowledge for cmcrgencieb. The firlt  
would impair the energy of its charac¬  
ter, and uoth would fuzard its lafety,  
or expofe it to greater evils when War  
could not be avoided. Bcfidcs, that War  
might often not depend upon its own  
chuicc. In proporti )n as the obfer-  
vance of pacitic maxims might exempt  
a Nation from the ncccfruy of pradtif.  
big the rules of the Military art, ought  
tv oe lu care in prclerving and iraol-  
  
P A P E R S&gt; ij{  
  
mltting, by proper eftablifliments, the  
knowledge of that art. Whatever ir*  
gument may be drawn from particular  
examples, luperficially viewed, a tho^  
rough examination of the fubje^ will  
evince that* the art of War is at once  
comprehenlive and complicated i that it  
demands nauch previous dudy ; and that  
the pofTciBon of it, in its mud im¬  
proved and perfect date, is always of  
great moment to the lecurity of a Na¬  
tion. This, therefore, ought to be a  
ferious care of every Government;  
and for this purpofe an Academy,  
where a regular courl&#x27;c of indruflion i«  
given, is an obvious expedient which  
diti&#x27;crenc Nations have lucccrsfuiiy cm*  
plovcd.  
  
The compenfations to the OfEcers  
of &#x27;the Ciiitcd States, in various in-  
dances, and in none inure than in rc-  
rpc6l lo the mod important daiioirs,  
appear to call for Legiflativc revtikm.  
The conl&#x27;ec^uences of a dcfcdllvc pro-  
vifion arc ot a ferious import to the Go¬  
vernment. &gt;  
  
If private wealth is to fupply the  
defeff of public retribution, it will  
gre illy contrail the fphere within which  
the Ideation of charaftcr for OiEcc  
is to be made, and will proportionally  
diminiih the probability of a choice of  
men able as well as upright.—Beddes  
that. It would be repugnant to the vital  
principles of our Government virtunliy  
to exclude from public truds talents  
and virtue, unlcls accompanied by  
wealth.  
  
While, in our external relations, fome  
ferious inconvcnicncies and embamff-  
nicnts have been overcome, and otners  
Ictfened, it is with inucii pain and deep  
regret I mention, that circuinltinccs  
of a very unwelcome nature have UieJr  
occurred. Our trade has fuffered, and  
is t&#x27;utFerine, extenfive injuries in il.c  
Wed Indies, from the cruizers and  
agents of the French Republic ;—and  
communications have been received  
from its Minidcr here, which indicate  
the dinger of a further didurbance of  
our cotnmcrcc by its authority, and  
which are, in other rcl&#x27;pedfs, far from  
agreeable.  
  
It has been my condant, (incere, ind  
earned wilh, in conformity with that  
of our Nation, to maintain cordial har¬  
mony, and a perfect friendly undcr-  
flandmg with that Republic. This

of every American citizen. “ To an act-  
IVE EXTERNAL COMMERCE THE PROTEC-  
TION OF A NAVAL #ORCE IS INDISPENSA-  
BLE.”  ‘Ihis,” saysthe President, “ is  
manifested, with regard to wars, in which  
the state is itselfaparty. But besides this,  
itis in our own experience, that the most  
sincere neutrality is not a sufficient guard  
avrainst the depredations of nations at war.  
To secure respect a neutral flag requires a  
naval furce ORGANIZED and READT to vin-  
dicate it from insult and aggression. This  
may even prevent the necessity of going to  
war by discouraging belligerent powers  
from committing such violations of the  
rights of the yieutral party, as may first or  
last have nootheroption. These consider-  
ations invite the United States to look to the  
means and set about the gradual creation of  
a Navy.” He advises the congress there-  
fore “ to begin without delay to provide for  
and lay up the materials for building and  
equipping suips of war, and to proceed in  
the work by degfees in proportion as our  
resources shall render it practicable with-  
out inconvenience, so that a future war of  
Europe may not find our commerce in the  
Same unprotected state im which it was

“ After many delays and disappointments, arising out of the  
  
European war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engage-  
  
ments made to the Dey and regency of Algiers, will in all.  
  
present appearances, be crowned with success; but under great,  
though inevitable disadvantages, in the pecuniary transactions,  
occasioned by that war, which will render a further provision  
necessary. The actual liberation of all our citizens, who  
  
were prisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling,  
  
heart, is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the  
whole negotiation. Measures are in operation for effecting  
treaties, with the regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.”  
  
“To an active external commerce, the protection of a naval  
force is indispensable. ‘This is manifest with regard to wars,  
in which a state is itselfa party. But, besides this, it is in our  
own experience, that the most sincere neutrality is not a suf-  
ficient guard against the depredations of nations at war. Zo  
secure respect to aneutral flag, requires a naval force, organ-  
ized, and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression. This  
may even prevent the necessity of going to war, by discourag-  
ing belligerent powers from committing such violations of the  
rights of the neutral party, as may, first or last, leave no other  
option. From the best information I have been able to ob-  
tain, it would seem as if our trade to the Mediterranean, with-  
out a protecting force, will always be insecure, and our citi-  
zens exposed to the calamities from which numbers of them  
have but just been relieved.  
  
“These considerations invite the United States to look to  
the means, and fo set about the gradual creation of a Navy.  
The increasing progress of their navigation promises them, at  
no distant period, the requisite supply of seamen; and their  
means, in other respects, favor the undertaking. It is an en-  
courgement, likewise, that their particular situation will give  
weight and influence to a moderate naval force in their hands.  
Will it not then be .advisable to begin, without delay, to pro-  
vide and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of  
ships of war; and to proceed in the work, by degrees, in propor.  
tion, as our resources shall render it practicable, without incon-  
venience; so that a future war of Europe, may not find our  
commerce in the same wnprotected state, in which it was  
found by the present.”

gress, December 7, 1796, observes: “ While in our external  
relations, some serious inconveniences and embarrassments  
have been overcome, and others lessened, it is with much pain,  
and deep regret, I mention, that circumstances of a very un-  
welcome nature have lately occurred. Our trade has suffered,  
and is_ suffering, extensive injuries in the West Indies, from  
the cruizers and agents of the French republic; and communi-  
cations have been received from its minister here, which indi-  
cate the danger of a further disturbance of our commerce, by its  
authority, and which are, in other respects, far from agreeable.  
  
“It has been my constant, sincere, and earnest wish, in con-  
formity with that of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony,  
and a perfectly friendly understanding with that republic.  
This wish remains unabated, and I shall persevere in the en-  
deavor to fulfil it, to the utmost extent of what shall be consis-  
tent with a just and indispensable regard to the rights and ho-  
nor of our country; nor will [easily cease to cherish the ex-  
pectation, thata spirit of justice, candor and friendship, on the  
part of the republic, will eventually ensure success.  
  
“In pursuing this course, however, I cannot forget what is  
due to the character of our government and nation; or toa full  
and entire confidence in the good sense, patriotism, self-re-  
spect, and fortitude of ray countrymen.”

recommendation by the executive, of a naval policy. “To an  
active external commerce, (says the President) the protection  
of a naval foree is indispensable. This is manifest of wars to  
which a state itself is a party. But besides this, it is in our  
own experience that the most sincere neutrality, is not a suf-  
oe tent guard against the depredations of nations at war. To  
  
‘ure respect to a neutral flag, requires a naval force orga-  
ead and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression. This  
may even prevent the necessity of going to war, by discouraging  
belligerents from committing such violations of the rights of  
the neutral party, as may first or last leave no other option.  
From the best information [ have been able to obtain, it would  
seem as if our trade to the Mediterranean, without a protecting  
force, will always be insecure, and our citizens exposed to the  
calamities from which numbers of them have but just been re-  
lieved. ‘These considerations invite the United States to look  
to the means, and to set about the gradual creation of a navy.  
Will it not then be advisable to begin without delay to provide  
and lay up the materials for building and equipping of ships  
of war, and to proceed in the work by “degrees, in proportion as  
our resources shall render it practicable without inconvenienc e,  
so that a future war of Europe may not find our commerce in  
the same unprotected state in which it was found by the pre-  
sent?”

tary academy is also recommended by cogent  
reasons. However pacific the general policy  
of a nation may be, it ought never to be with-  
out an adequate stock of military knowledge  
for emergencies.—-Whatever argument may  
be drawn from particular examples, superfi-  
cially viewed, a thorough examination of the  
subject will evince that the art of war is  
extensive and complicated ; that it demands  
much previous study; and that the possess-  
ion of it, in its most improved and perfect  
state, is always of great moment to the secu-  
rityofanation. This, therefore, ought to be  
a serious care of every government ; and for  
this purpose, an academy, where a regular  
course of instruction is given, is an obvious  
expedient which different nations have suc-

“ It will not be doubted that, with reference  
either to individual or national welfare, agriculture  
is of primary importance. In proportion as na¬  
tions advance in population, and other circum¬  
stances of maturity, this truth becomes more ap¬  
parent, and renders the cultivation of the soil  
more and more an object of public patronage.—  
Institutions for promoting it grow up, supported  
by the public purse ; and to what object can it be  
dedicated with greater propriety? Among the  
means which have been employed to this end,  
none have been attended with greater success  
than the establishment of Boards, composed of  
proper characters, charged with collecting and  
diffusing information, and enabled by premiums  
and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist  
a spirit of discovery and improvement. This  
species of establishment contributes doubly to  
the increase of improvement, by stimulating to  
enterprize and experiment, and by drawing to a  
common centre the results, every where, of indi-  
vi^al skill and observation, and spreading them  
over the whole nation. Experience accoiiingly

of Congress to foster and promote. “ I have here-  
tofore proposed to the consideration of Congress,  
the expediency of establishing a National Univer-  
sity, and also a Military Academy. ‘The desirable-  
ness of both these institutions, has so constantly in-  
  
creased with every new view I have taken of the |  
  
subject, that I cannot omit the opportunity of once  
for all recalling your attention to them. The As-  
sembly whom I address, is too enlightened not to be  
fully sensible how much a flourishing state of the  
arts and sciences contributes to national prosperity  
and reputation. ‘True it is, that our country con-  
tains many seminaries of learning highly respecta-  
ble and useful, but the funds upon which they rest  
are too narrow to command the ablest professors  
in the different branches of liberal knowledge.  
Amongst the motives to such an Institution, the as-  
similation of the principles, opinions and manners  
of our countrymen, by the common education of a  
portion of our youth, from every quarter, well de-  
serves attention. ‘The more homogeneous our  
citizens can be made in these particulars, the  
greater will be our prospect of permanent union;  
and a primary object of such a National Institution  
should be, the education of our youth in the sci-  
ence of Government. In a Republic, what species  
ot knowledge can be equally important, and what  
duty more pressing onits Legislature than to pat-  
ronize a plan for communicating it to those who  
are to be the future guardians of the liberties of  
the country.” Again: in his Farewell Address, he  
says ; ‘‘ Promote, then, as an object of primary im-

“Tt will not be doubted that, with reference either  
to individual or national welfare, agriculture is of  
primary importance. In proportion as nations advance  
in population, and other circumstances of maturity,  
this truth becomes more apparent, and renders the  
cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public  
patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow up,  
supported by the public purse; and to what object can  
it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the  
means which have been employed to this end, none  
have been attended with greater success than the  
establishment of Boards, composed of proper charac-  
ters, charged with collecting and diffusing informa-  
tion, and enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary  
aid, to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and  
improvement, by stimulating to enterprise and exper-

soil more and more an object of public patronage.  
Institutions for promoting it grow up, supported  
by the public press; and to what object can it be  
dedicated with greater propriety? Among the  
means which have been employed to this end, none  
have been attended with greater success than the  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
establishment of boards, composed of proper  
characters, charged with collecting and diffusin

ecuniary aids, to encourage and assist a spirit of  
Sesovery and improvement, by stimulating to en-  
terprise and experiment, and by drawing to a  
common centre the results, everywhere, of indi-  
vidual skill and observation, and spreading them  
thence over the whole nation. Experience accor-  
dingly has shown that they were very cheap in-.

the general policy of a nation may be, it oaght never

establishment contributes doubly to the increase of improvement,  
by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a

returns to the expediency of establishing a national university, and  
also a military academy ; and proceeds :—  
  
The assembly to which I address myself, is too enlightened not to be fully  
sensible how much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contributes to  
national prosperity and reputation. True it is, that our country contains many  
seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful; but the funds upon which  
they rest are too narrow to command the ablest professors, in the different  
departments of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplated, though they  
would be excellent auxiliaries.  
  
Amongst the motives to such an institution, the assimilation of the principles,  
opinions and manners of our countrymen, by the common education of a por-  
tion of our youth from every quarter, well deserves attention. The more  
homogeneous our citizens can be made in these particulars, the greater will be  
our prospect of permanent union; and a primary object of such a national  
institution should be, the education of our youth in the science of government.  
In a republic, what species of knowledge can be equally important, and what  
duty more pressing in its legislation, than to patronize a plan of communicating  
it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country.

The establishment of some kind of an in­

warmly recommended by our beloved Wash­  
ington. He says, clearly and forcibly, &quot;It  
  
will not be doubted that with reference either  
  
to individual or national welfare, agriculture  
is of primary importance. In proportion as  
nations advance in population, and other cir­  
cumstances of maturity, this truth becomes  
more apparent, and renders the cultivation of  
the soil more and more an object of public  
patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow  
  
up, supported by the public purse, and to what  
  
object can it be dedicated with greater suc­  
cess than the establishment of agricultural  
boards, composed of proper characters, charg-  
  
ed with collecting and diffusing information,  
  
and enabled by premiums, and small pecunia  
ry aid, to encourage and assist a spirit of im  
  
provement, by drawing to a common centre  
the result every where, of individual skill and  
  
observation, and by spreading them thence

 decide upon the result.&quot;  
In his annual address on the 7th of  
December 1796, when he met, for the last  
time, the two houses of Congress, he said :  
It will not be doubted .that, with refer  
ence to either individual or national &quot;wel  
fare, agriculture is of primary importance.  
In proportion as nations advance in popu­  
lation, and other circumstances of matur­  
ity, this truth becomes more apparent, and  
renders the cultivation 01 the soil more  
and more an object of public patronage  
Institutions for promoting it grew up  
supported by the public purse; and to  
what obiect can it be dedicated with great&#x27;  
er propriety ? Among the means which  
have fieen employed to this end, none have  
been attended with greater success than  
the establishment of boards, composed of  
proper characters, charged with collecting  
and diffusing information, and enabled by  
premiums, and procuring aids, to encour  
age ana assist a Bpini oi discovery ana  
improvement.  
This species of establishment contributes  
doubly to the lrrcreaee-ot improvement, by  
stimulating to .enterprise and experiment.  
and bv drawing to a common centre the  
results, everywhere of individual skill and  
observation, and spreading them thence  
over the whole nation. Experience ac  
cordingly, has shown that they are very  
cheap&quot; instruments of immense national

Not only did Washington promulgate this doctrine, but he maintained  
that ‘to secure respect to a neutral flag requires a naval force organized  
and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression.’ He furthermore  
advocated the ‘gradual creation’ of a navy, and said, ‘ Will it not be  
advisable to begin without delay to provide and lay up the materials

However pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it ought  
never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge for  
emergencies. This lack would impair the energy of its character  
and hazard its safety or expose it to greater evils when war could  
not be avoided; besides that, war might often not depend upon its  
own choice. In proportion as the observance of pacific maxims  
might exempt a nation from the necessity of practicing the rules  
of the military art ought to be its care in preserving and trans-

The art of war is at once comprehensive and complicated. It  
demands much previous study, and the possession of it in its

ters of Their Profession.  
George E. Waring, in the Outlook.  
“In proportion as the observance of pa­  
cific maxims might exempt a nation from  
tho necessity of practicing the rules of the  
military art, ought to be its care in pro­  
curing and transmitting by proper establish­  
ments the knowledge of that art.”—Wash-  
ington.  
The great use of education is to prepare  
us for “the pursuit of happiness,” which  
is the best aim in life, and which becomes  
a higher and higher aim as education raises  
its standard. The most complete and last­  
ing happiness of which we are capable  
comes from a sense of duty done. To  
achieve this is the noblest human aspira­  
tion, as it is the crowning glory of tech­

row to command the ablest professors in the different departments  
of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplated, though  
they would be excellent auxiliaries. Among the motives to such  
an institution, the assimilation of principles, opinions and man¬  
ners of our countrymen by the common education of a portion of  
our youth from every quarter, well deserves attention ; the more  
homogeneous our citizens can be made in these particulars, the  
greater will be our prospects of permanent union ; and a primary  
object of such a national institution should be the education of  
our youth in the sciejice of government.”

of history and review the grand memories of the past learning by  
no other lamp but that of experience. Washington also attempted  
to impress upon Congress “ how much a flourishing state of the  
arts and sciences contributes to national prosperity and reputa¬

professors, in the different departments of liberal knowledge, for  
the institution contemplated, though they would be excellent
