I  
By the State of MarylandA Declaration  
Whereas the General Assembly of Maryland hath heretofore Resolved “That the Delegates from this State should be instructed to remonstrate to the Congress that this State esteem it essentially necessary for rendering the Union lasting that the United States in Congress assembled should have full Power to ascertain and fix the western Limits of those States that claim to the Mississipi or South Sea.”  
“That this State considered themselves justly entitled to a Right in  Common with the other Members of the Union to that extensive Tract of Country which lies to the Westward of the Frontiers of the united States, the property of which was not vested in, or granted to Individuals at the Commencement of the present War; That the same had been or might thereafter be gained from the King of Great Britain, or the native Indians by the Blood and Treasure of all, and ought therefore to be a common Estate to be granted out on Terms beneficial to all the united States, And that they should Use their utmost Endeavours that an Article to that Effect be made part of the Confederation.  
That this State wou’d contribute their Quota of Men and Money towards carrying on the present War with Great Britain for the Purpose of establishing the freedom and Independence of the United States according to such Rule of Proportion as should be determined by the united States in Congress assembled, and would pay their proportion of all Money issued or borrowed by Congress or which might thereafter be issued or borrowed for the purpose aforesaid. And that this State would accede to and faith[fully] execute all Treaties which had been or should be made by Authority of Congress, and would be bound and governed by the Determination of the United States in Congress assembled, relative to Peace or War.  
That this State hath upon all Occasions shewn her Zeal to promote and maintain the general Welfare of the United States of America: That upon the same principle they are of Opinion a Confederation of perpetual Friendship and Union between the united States is highly necessary for the Benefit of the whole; and that they are most willing and desirous to enter into a Confederation and Union, but at the same time such Confederation should in their Opinion be formed on the Principles of Justice and Equity.[”]  
Which Resolves, Remonstrances, and Instructions were by our Delegates laid before Congress and the Objections therein made to the Confederation were submitted in Writing to their Consideration, and the several Points fully discussed and debated, And the Alterations and Amendments proposed by our Delegates to the Confederation in Consequence of the aforesaid Instructions by us to them given, were rejected, and no satisfactory Reasons assigned for the Rejection thereof.  
We do therefore declare that we esteem it fundamentally wrong and repugnant to every principle of Equity and good Policy, on which a Confederation between free, Sovereign and independent States ought to be founded, That this or any other State entering into such Confederation, should be burthened with heavy Expences for the subduing and Guarranteeing immense Tracts of Country, if they are not to share any part of the Monies arising from the Sales of the Lands within those Tracts, or be otherwise benefited thereby. In Conformity to this our Opinion, the Sentiments of our Constituents, in Justice to them and Ourselves,—And least such Construction, should hereafter be put on the undefined Expressions contained in the third Article of the Confederation, and the proviso to the ninth (according to which no State is to be deprived of Territory for the Benefit of the United States) as may subject all to such Guarranty as aforesaid, and deprive Some of the said States of their Right in Common to the Lands aforesaid.  
  
We declare that we mean not to subject ourselves to such Guaranty nor will we be responsible for any part of such Expences, unless the third Article and Proviso aforesaid, be explained so as to prevent their being hereafter construed in a Manner injurious to this State. Willing however to remove as far as we can consistently with the trust conferred upon us every other Objection on our part to the Confederation, and anxiously desirous to cement by the most indisoluble Ties, that Union, which has hitherto enabled us to resist the Artifices and the Power of Great Britain and concieving ourselves, as we have heretofore declared, justly entitled to a right in Common with the other Members of the Union to that extensive Country lying to the Westward of the Frontiers of the united States, the Property of which was not vested in or granted to Individualy at the Commencement of the present War.  
We declare that we will accede to the Confederation, provided an Article or Articles be added thereto, giving full power to the united States in Congress assembled to ascertain and fix the Western Limits of the States claiming to extend to the Mississipi, or South Sea, and expressly reserving and securing to the united States a Right in Common in, and to all the Lands lying to the Westward of the Frontiers as aforesaid, not granted to, surveyed for, or purchased by Individuals at the Commencement of the present War, in such Manner that the said Lands be sold out, or otherwise disposed of for the Common Benefit of all the States, and that the Money ariseing from the Sale of these Lands, or the Quit Rents reserved thereon, may be deemed and taken as part of the Monies belonging to the United States, and as such be appropriated by Congress towards defraying the Expences of the War, and the payment of Interest on Monies borrowed or to be borrowed on the Credit of the United States from France or any other European Power, or for any other joint Benefit of the United States.  
We do further declare that the exclusive Claim set up by some States to the whole western Country by extending their Limits to the Mississipi or South Sea, is in our Judgment without any solid Foundation, and we religiously believe, will if submitted to, prove ruinous to this State, and to other States similary circumstanced, and in process of Time be the Means of subverting the Confederation, if it be not explained by the additional Article or Articles proposed, so as to obviate all Misconstruction and Misinterpretation of those parts thereof that are hereinbefore specified.  
We entered into this just and necessary War, to defend our Rights against the Attacks of Avarice and Ambition; We have made the most strenuos Efforts during the Prosecution of it; And we are resolved to continue them until our Independence is firmly established: Hitherto we have successfully resisted, and we hope, with the Blessing of Providence, for final Success. If the Enemy encouraged by the Appearance of Divisions among us, and the Hope of our not confederating, should carry on Hostilities longer than they otherwise would have done, let those be responsible for the Prolongation of the War, and all it’s consequent Calamities, who by refusing to comply with Requisitions so just and reasonable, have hitherto prevented the Confederation from taking  Place and are therefore justly chargeable with every Evil, which hath flowed and may flow from such Procrastination.

Enclosure II  
Instructions of the General Assembly of Maryland to George Plater, William Paca, William Carmichael, John Henry, James Forbes, and Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, Esquires.  
  
Gentlemen,  
  
Having conferred upon you a trust of the highest nature, it is evident, we place great confidence in your integrity abilities and zeal to promote the general welfare of the United States, and the particular interest of this State where the latter is not incompatible with the former. But to add greater weight to your proceedings in Congress and to take away all suspicion that the opinions you there deliver and the votes you give may be the mere opinions of Individuals, and not resulting from your knowledge of the sense and deliberate judgement of the State you represent, we think it our duty to instruct you as followeth on the subject in which unfortunately a supposed difference of interest has produced an almost equal division of sentiments among the several states composing the union. We say a supposed difference of interests: for if local attachments, and prejudices, and the avarice and ambition of Individuals would give way to the dictates of a sound policy founded on the principles of justice (and no other policy but what is founded on these immutable principles deserves to be called sound) we flatter ourselves this apparent diversity of Interests would soon vanish and all the States would confederate on terms mutually advantageous to all, for they would then perceive that no other confederation than one so formed can be lasting. Altho’ the pressure of immediate calamities, the dread of their continuance from the appearance of disunion, and some other peculiar circumstances may have induced some States to accede to the present confederation contrary to their own interests and Judgments, it requires no great share of Foresight to predict, that when these causes cease to operate, the States which have thus acceded to the confederation, will consider it as no longer binding, and will eagerly embrace the first Occasion of asserting their just rights and securing their Independence. Is it possible that those States, who are ambitiously grasping for territories, to which in our judgement they have not the least shadow of exclusive right, will use with greater moderation the increase of Wealth and power derived from those territories, when acquired, than what they have displayed in their endeavours to acquire them? We think not. We are convinced the same spirit which hath prompted them to insist on a claim so extravagant, so repugnant to every principle of justice, so incompatible with the general welfare of all the States, will urge them on to add oppression to injustice. If they should not be  incited by a superiority of Wealth and strength to oppose by open force their less wealthy and less powerful neighbours, yet the depopulation, and consequently the impoverishment of those States will necessarily follow, which by an unfair construction of the confederation may be strip’d of a common interest in and the common benefits derivable from the western country. Supposed, for instance, Virginia indisputably possessed of the extensive and fertile country, to which she has set up a claim, what would be the probable consequences to Maryland of such an undisturbed and undisputed possession? They cannot escape the least discerning—Virginia, by selling on the most moderate terms a small proportion of the lands in question, would draw into her treasury, vast sums of money and in proportion to the sums arising from such sales, would be enabled to lessen her taxes. Lands comparatively cheap and taxes comparatively low with the Lands and taxes of an adjacent State, would quickly drain the State thus disadvantageously circumstanced of its most useful inhabitants; its wealth and its consequence in the scale of the confederated States would sink of course.  
A claim so injurious to more than one half, if not to the whole of the United States, ought to be supported by the clearest evidence of the right. Yet what evidences of that right have been produced? What arguments alledged in support either of the evidence or the right? None that we have heard of deserving a serious reputation.  
It has been said that some of the delegates of a neighbouring State have declared their opinion of the impracticability of governing the extensive dominion claimed by that State; hence also the necessity was admitted of dividing its territory and erecting a new State under the auspices and direction of the elder from whom no doubt it would receive its form of government, to whom it would be bound by some alliance, or confederacy, and by whose councils it would be influenced. Such a measure, if ever attempted would certainly be opposed by the other States as inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the proposed confederation, should it take place, by establishing a Sub-confederacy Imperium in Imperio. The State possessed of this extensive dominion must then either submit to all the inconveniences of an overgrown and unwieldy Government, or suffer the authority of Congress to interpose at a future time, and to lop off a part of its territory to be erected into a new and free State and admitted into the confederation on such conditions as shall be settled by nine States. If it is necessary for the happiness and tranquillity of a State thus overgrown, that Congress should hereafter interfere, and divide its territory, why is the claim to that territory now made and so pertinaciously insisted on? We can suggest to ourselves but two motives; either the declaration of relinquishing at some future period a portion of the country, now contended for was made to lull suspicion asleep, and to cover the designs of a secret ambition, or if the thought was seriously entertained, the lands are now claimed to reap an immediate profit from the sale. We are convinced, Policy and Justice require that a country unsettled at the commencement of this war claimed by the British crown, and ceded to it by the treaty of Paris, if wrested from the common enemy by the blood and treasure of the thirteen States, should be considered as a common  property subject to be parcelled out by Congress into free convenient and Independent governments in such manner, and at such times as the wisdom of that Assembly shall hereafter direct. Thus convinced, we should betray the trust reposed in us by our constituents, were we to authorize you to ratify on their behalf the confederation unless it be farther explained. We have cooly and dispassionately considered the subject, we have weighed probable inconveniences and hardships against the sacrifice of just and essential rights; and do instruct you not to agree to the confederation unless an article or articles be added thereto in conformity with our declaration: Should we succeed in obtaining such article or articles then you are hereby fully empowered to accede to the confederation.  
That these our sentiments respecting the confederation may be more publickly known and more explicitly and concisely declared, we have drawn up the annexed declaration, which we instruct you to lay before congress, to have it printed, and to deliver to each of the delegates of the other States in Congress assembled, copies thereof signed by yourselves or by such of you as may be present at the time of the delivery to the intent and purpose that the copies aforesaid may be communicated to our brethren of the United States, and the conte

I  
Virginia to Wit. In General Assembly the 14th. December 1779. The Remonstrance of the General Assembly of Virginia to the delegates of the United American States in Congress Assembled.  
The General Assembly of Virginia ever attentive to the recommendations of Congress, and desirous to give the great Council of the United States every Satisfaction in their power, consistent with the rights and Constitution of their own Commonwealth, have enacted a Law to prevent present Settlements on the North West Side of the Ohio River, and will on all occasions endeavour to Manifest their attachment to the Common interest of America, and their earnest wishes to remove every cause of Jealousy and promote that mutual confidence and harmony between the different States so essential to their true Interest and Safety.  
Strongly impressed with these Sentiments, the General Assembly of Virginia cannot avoid expressing their Surprize and concern upon the information that Congress had received and countenanced petitions from certain persons stiling themselves the Vandalia and Indiana Company’s, asserting claims to lands in defiance of the Civil Authority, jurisdiction and Laws of this Commonwealth, and offering to erect a  separate government within the Territory thereof. Should Congress assume a Jurisdiction, and arrogate to themselves a right of adjudication not only unwarranted by, but expressly contrary to the fundamental principles of the Confederation; superseding or controuling the internal policy, Civil regulations, and Municipal Laws of this or any other State, it would be a violation of public faith, introduce a most dangerous precedent which might hereafter be urged to deprive of Territory or Subvert the Sovereignty and Government of any one or more of the United States; and establish in Congress a power which in process of time must degenerate into an intolerable despotism.  
It is notorious that the Vandalia and Indiana Company’s are not the only Claimers of large tracts of Land under titles repugnant to our Laws; that Several Men of great influence in some of the neighbouring States, are concerned in partnerships with the Earl of Dunmore, and other Subjects of the British Kind, who under purchases from the Indians, claim extensive tracts of Country between the Ohio and Mississipi Rivers; and that propositions have been made to Congress evidently calculated to secure and guarranty such purchases; so that under colour of creating a common fund, had those propositions been adopted, the public would have been duped by the Arts of Individuals, and great part of the value of the unappropriated Lands converted to private purposes.  
Congress have lately described and ascertained the Boundaries of these United States, as an ultimatum in their terms of peace. The united States hold no territory but in right of some one individual State in the Union: the territory of each State from time immemorial, hath been fixed and determined by their respective Charters. There being no other rule or criterion to judge by, should these in any instance (when there is no disputed territory between particular States) be abridged without the consent of the States affected by it, general confusion must ensue; each State would be Subjected, in its turn to the incroachments of the others, and a field opened for future Wars of bloodshed; nor can any arguments be fairly urged to prove that any particular tract of Country, within the limits claimed by Congress on behalf of the United States, is not part of the chartered territory of some one of them, but must militate with equal force against the right of the United States in general; and tend to prove such tract of country (if North West of the Ohio river) part of the British province of Canada.  
When Virginia acceded to the Articles of Confederation, her rights of Sovereignty and jurisdiction within her own territory were reserved and secured to her, and cannot now be infringed or altered without her consent. She could have no latent views of extending that territory; because it had long before been expressly and clearly defined in the Act which formed her new Government.  
The General Assembly of Virginia have heretofore offered Congress to furnish lands out of their territory on the North West side of the Ohio river without purchase Money, to the troops on Continental establishment of such of the Confederated States as had not unappropriated Lands for that purpose; in conjunction with the other States holding unappropriated Lands, and in such proportion as should be adjusted and  settled by Congress; which offer when accepted they will most chearfully make good to the same extent, with the provision made by Law for their own troops; if Congress shall think fit to allow the like quantities of Land to the other troops on Continental establishment. But altho the General Assembly of Virginia would make great sacrifices to the common interest of America, (as they have already done on the subject of representation) and will be ready to listen to any just and reasonable propositions for removing the ostensible causes of delay to the complete ratification of the Confederation; they find themselves impelled by the duties which they owe to their Constituents, to their posterity, to their Country and to the United States in general, to remonstrate and protest; and they do hereby, in the name and on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia expressly protest against any jurisdiction, or right of adjudication in Congress, upon the petitions of the Vandalia or Indiana Company’s or on any other matter or thing Subversive of the internal policy, civil government or Sovereignty of this or any other of the United American States; or unwarranted by the Articles of the Confederation.

Enclosure IV  
An Act to facilitate the completion of the articles of confederation and perpetual union, among the United States of America.  
Whereas nothing under divine providence, can more effectually contribute to the tranquillity and safety of the United States of America, than a fœderal alliance on such liberal principles, as will give satisfaction to its respective members; and whereas the articles of confederation, and perpetual Union, recommended by the Honorable Congress of the United States of America, have not proved acceptable to all the States; it having been conceived that a portion of the waste and uncultivated territory, within the limits and claims of certain States, ought to be appropriated, as a common fund for the expences of the war. And the people of the State of New York being on all occasions, disposed to manifest their regard for their sister States; and their earnest desire to promote the general interest and security; and more especially to accelerate the fœderal alliance; by removing, as far as it depends upon them, the before mentioned impediment to its final accomplishment.  
Be it therefore enacted by the people of the State of New York represented in senate and assembly, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same; that it shall and may be lawful to and for the Delegates of this State in the Honble. Congress of the United States of America, or the major part of such of them, as shall be assembled in Congress, and they the said delegates or the major part of them, as assembled, are hereby fully authorised and empowered, for and on behalf of this State, and by proper and authentic acts or instruments to limit and restrict the boundaries of this State, in the western parts thereof by such line or lines, and in such measures and form as they shall judge to be expedient;  either with respect to the jurisdiction as well as the right, or preemption of Soil; or reserving the jurisdiction, in part, or in the whole over the lands which may be ceded or relinquished, with respect only to the right or pre-emption of the Soil.  
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid: That the territory which may be ceded or relinquished by virtue of this act, either with respect to jurisdiction, as well as the right or pre-emption of Soil; or the right or pre-emption of soil only; shall be and enure for the use and benefit of such of the United States, as shall become members of the fœderal alliance of the said States, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever.  
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid: That all the lands to be ceded and relinquished by virtue of this act for the benefit of the united States, with aspect to property; but which shall nevertheless remain under the jurisdiction of this State, shall be disposed of and appropriated, in such manner only, as the Congress of the said States shall direct and that a warrant, under the authority of Congress, for surveying and laying out any part thereof, shall entitle the party in whose favour it shall issue, to cause the same to be surveyed, and laid out and returned, according to the directions of such warrant; and thereupon letters patent, under the great seal of this State shall pass to the grantee for the estate specified in the said warrant; for which no other fee or reward shall be demanded or received, than such as shall be allowed by Congress.  
Provided always, and be it further enacted by the authority afore-said: That the trust reposed by virtue of this act, shall not be executed by the Delegates of this State, unless at least three of the said Delegates shall be present in Congress.

In Congress Septr. 6th. 1780.  
Congress took into Consideration the Report of the Commit[tee] to whom were referred the Instructions of the General Assembly of Maryland to their Delegates in Congress respecting the Articles of Confederation, and the Declaration therein referred to; the Act of the Legislature of New York on the same Subject, and the remonstrance of the General Assembly of Virginia which Report was agreed [to] and is in the Words foll[owing,] to wit,  
“That having duly considered the several Matters to them submitted they conceive it unnecessary to examine into the Merits or the Policy of the Instructions or Declaration of the General Assembly of Maryland, Or of the Remonstrance of the General Assembly of Virginia, as they involve Questions, a Discussion of which was declined on mature Consideration when the Articles of Confederation were debated: Nor in the opinion of the Committee can such Questions be now revived with  any Prospect of Conciliation: That it appears more adviseable to press upon those States which can remove the Embarrassment respecting the Western Country, a liberal Surrender of a Portion of their territorial Claims, since they cannot be preserved entire without endangering the Stability of the general Confederacy to remind them how indispensibly necessary it is to establish the fœderal Union on a fixed and permanent Basis, and on Principles acceptable to all its’ respective Members, how essential to public Credit and Confidences, to the support of our Army, to the Vigour of our Councils and the Success of our Measures, to our tranquillity at home and our Reputation abroad, to our present Safety and our future Prosperity, to our very existence as a free sovereign and independent People.—That they are fully persuaded, the Wisdom of the respective Legislatures will lead them to a full and impartial Consideration of a Subject so interesting to the united States and so necessary to the happy Establishment of the fœderal Union. That they are confirmed in these Expectations by a review of the before mentioned Act of the Legislature of New York submitted to their Consideration. That this Act is expressly calculated to accel[er]ate the fœderal Alliance by removing as far as it depends on that State the Impediment arising from the western Country, and for that purpose to yield up a portion of territorial Claim for the general Benefit,” Whereupon,  
Resolved that Copies of the several Papers referred to the Committee be transmitted with a copy of the Report, to the Legislatures of the several states: And that it be earnestly recommend[ed] to those States, who have Claims to the Western Country, to pass such Laws and give their Delegates in Congress such powers as may effectually remove the only obstacle to a final Ratification of the Articles of Confederation. And that the Legislature of Maryland be earnestly requested to authorize their Delegates in Congress to subscribe the said Articles.

and Georgia laid claim in the same way to the lands  
lying south of the 35th degree of north latitude.—  
From all these states, the United States have, at dif-  
ferent times, obtained cessions, by which all these  
conflicting rights were extinguished and merged  
in that of the national government.  
  
By an act of the legislature of this state, passed  
Feb. 19th, 1780, the delegates representing the  
state of New-York, in congress, were “fully authori-  
zed and empowered, for and on behalf of this state,  
and by proper and authentic acts and instruments,  
to limit and restrict the boundaries of this state, in  
the western part thereof, by such line or lines, and  
in such manner and form, as they shall judge to be  
expedient, either with respect to the. jurisdiction,  
as well as the right of pre-emption of soil, or reserv-  
ing the jurisdiction in part orin whole.” In pur-  
suance of this authority, the delegates, on the Ist  
March, 1781, executed an instrument of cession and  
restriction of the limits of this slate, whereby they,  
in the name of the people, and for and in behalf of  
the state of New-York, «did, cede, transfer, and for-  
ever relinquish, to and for the only use and benefit  
of such of the states, as are orshall become parties to  
the articles of confederation, all the right, title, inter-  
est, jurisdiction, and claim, of New-York, toali lands  
and territories to the northward and westward of  
the boundaries to which the said state is limited  
and restricted, to be granied, disposed of and ap-  
propriated, in. such manner only, as the congrees of the  
said United States shall order or direct.” - .

State of New-York in 1730, 1o pass ““an act to  
facilitate the completion of the Articles of Con­  
federation and perpetual Union »mong the Unit­  
ed States of America.”” The preamble to this  
act sets forth the difficulties which had risen in  
these words : —*“Whereas the Articles ot Con­  
federation and perpetual Union, recommended  
by the honorable Congress of the United States .  
of America have not proved acceptable to all the  
States, it having been conceived that a portion of  
the waste and incultivated territory, within the lim­  
its or claims of certain Slales, ought to be appro­  
priated as a common fund for the expenses ojp the  
war.” &amp;c. The act proceeds to au&#x27;horize the  
delegates of the State in Congress to cede to the  
United States all the right of New-York to the  
soil and jurisdiction of the western territory  
“for the use and benefit of such of the United States  
as shall become members of the Federal Alliance of  
the said States, and for no other use or purpose  
whatsocver.”’  
  
It seems that Virginia, whose claims were per­  
haps the best defined, having alrem’?i,; extended  
her settlements into Kentucky, and haying con­  
quered from the enemy the posts of Kaskaskias  
and Vincennes, remonstrated against the claims  
of other states to a surrender of her territory in  
that quarter. The memorial of Maryland, the  
proposal of New-York, and the remons&#x27;rance of  
Virginia were all referred to a committee. Up­  
on their report, Congress, on the 6th day of Sep­  
tember, 1780, adopted the following preamble  
and resolution, viz. L e \
  
| That having duly considered the several mat­  
ters to them submitted, they conceive it unnec­

**Whereas nothing under Divine Providence can more effec  
tually contribute to the tranguillity and safety of the United  
States of America than a federal alliance on such liberal prin  
ciples as will give satisfaction to its respective members; aud  
whereas, the articles of confederation and perpetual union re-  
commended by the honorable congress of the Uniied States of  
America have not proved acceptable to all the states, it baving  
been conceived that a portion of the waste and uneultivated  
territory within the limits or claims of certain states, ouglit to  
be appropriated as a common fund for the expenses of the war;  
aud the people of the state of New York being on all occasions  
disposed to manifest their regard for their sister states and their  
earnest desire to promote the general interest and security, and  
more especially to accellerate the federal alliance, by removing,  
as far as it depends upon them, the beforementioned impedi-  
ment to its final accomplishment,” &amp;e.  
  
This act of New York, the instructions of Maryland, and a  
remonstrance of Virginia, were referred to a committee of con-  
gress, who reported a preamble and resolutions thereon, which  
were adopted on the 6th of September, 1780; so much of which  
as is necessary to elucidate the eubject is to the following ef-  
fect, viz:  
  
“That it appears advisable to press upon those states which  
can remove the embarrassments respecting the western coun-  
try, a liberal surrender of a portion of their territorial claims,  
since they cannot be preserved entire without endangering the  
stability of the general confederacy; to remind them how in-  
dispensably necessary it is to establish the federal union on a  
fixed and permanent basis and on principles acceptable to all  
its respective members; how essential to public credit and con-  
fidence, to the support of our army, to the vigor of our councils  
and success of our measures, to our tranquillity at home, our  
reputation abroad,to our very existence as a free, sovereign  
and independent people, that they are fully pursuaded the wis-  
dom of the several legislatures will lead them to a full and im-  
partial consideration of a subject so interesting to the United  
States and so necessary to the happy establishment of the fe-  
deral union, thatthey are confirmed in these expectations by a  
review of the before mentioned act of the legislature of New  
York, submitted to their consideration,” &amp;e.  
  
** Resolved, That copies of the several papers, referred to the  
committee, be transmitted, with a copy of the report, to the le-  
gislatures of the several states, and that it be earnestly recom-  
mended to those states who have claims to the western coun-  
try, to pass such laws and give their delegates in congress such  
powers as may effectually remove the ouly obstacle toa final  
ratification of the articles of confederation; and that the legisla-  
ture of Maryland be earnestly requested to authorise their dele-  
gates in congress to subscribe the said articles.??

place great confidence in your integrity, ability and zeal, lo promote the gene­  
ral welfare of the United States and the particular interests of this Stale, when  
the latter i not incompatible with the former ; but to add greater weight to your  
proceedings in Congress, and take away a&#x27;l suspicions, that the opinions you  
are to deliver, and the votes you give, may be the mere opinion of individuals  
and not resulting from your knowledge of lho aense and deliberate judgment  
of the State you represent, we think it our duty to instruct a followeth on  
the subject of the Confederation a subject-&#x27;oh which, unfortunately, a sup­  
posed difference of interests has produced an almost equal division of senti­  
ment among the several 8tates comprising the Union. We say a supposed  
difference of interest t for if local attachments and prejudices, and the avarice  
and ambition of individuals, would give way to the dictates of a sound poli­  
cy, founded on die principles of justice (and no other policy but what is  
founded on those immutable principles deserves to be called sound) we flatter  
ourselves this apparent diversity of interests would aoon vanish and all the  
States would confederate on terms, mutually advantageous to all Sot they  
would then perceive that no other confederation than one so formed could be  
lasting. &#x27; Although the pressure of immediate calamities, the dread of their  
continuance from; the appearance of disunion, and some oiher peculiar cir­  
cumstances, may have induced some States to accede to the present eon feds  
  
ration; contrary to their own interests and judgments, it requires no great  
  
which ore arabiUoaxly grasping at Tcrritorfc? to which, in our iadrmenL  
  
they have not the least shadow of exclusive right, will us6 with greater mKle  
tation the increase of wealth and power derived from those Territories, when  
acquired, than what they have displayed in their endeavors t4 acquire theml  
  
e inins noi we are convincea toe same spirit which bath promp ed them  
to fftsist oir a, Claim so extravagant, so repugnant to every principle of justice,  
so incompatible with the general welfare oflhe States, will, urge them on to  
add oppression to injustice. If they should not tie incited by a sueriority of&#x27;  
wealth aruTstrength, to oppress by open force their less wealthy and less djw-  
  
rrtut neighbors, yet depopulation and. consequently, the impoverishment of  
  
tnose otates, will necessarily totlow, which,- by an unfair construction of the  
confederation, may be stripped of a common interest and the common benefits  
  
desirable from the Western Country. Suppose Virginia, for instance, indis  
  
putably possessed of the extensive and fertile country to which she bis set up  
  
claim, what would be the probable consequences to Maryland of such an un­  
disturbed and undisputed possession. They cannot escape the least discern  
  
ing. Virginia, by selling ttfi the most moderate trms a small proportion tf  
the lands in question, would draw into her treasury, vast sums of money, and  
in proportion to the suma arising from such sales, would be enabled to lessen  
  
her Taxes, Lands comparatively cheap, and Taxes rompar .tively low. with  
  
the land and Taxes of an adjacent State, would quickly drain the State, thus  
disadvantageously circumstanced, of its most useful inhabitants. Its wealth  
  
and its consequence, in the scale of the confederated States, would sink of  
  
course. A claim so injurious to more than one-half, if not the whole of the  
United States, ought to be supported by the clearest evidence of the right.  
Yet what evidence of that right Mb been produced ! What arguments alleged  
in support, either of the evidence or the right1! None that we have heard  
of. deserving a serious refutation- We are convinced policy and justice  
require that a country, unsettled at the commencement of this War, claimed  
  
by the British Crown and ceded to it by the Treaty of Paris, if wrested from  
the common enemy by the blood arid treasure of the 13 States, should lie con-;  
sidered as a common property subject to be parcelled out by Congress, into  
free, convenient, and independent Governments, in surh manner, and at sach !  
times as the wisdom of that Assembly shall hereafter direct­  
Thus convinced, we should betray the trust reposed in us by our constitu­  
ents, were we to authorize you to ratify on their behalf, the Confederation, un­  
less it be further explained. We have coolly, and dispassionately, considered  
the subject; we have weighed probable inconvenience and hardships, against  
the sacrifice of just and essential rights, and do instruct you not to agree to the  
Confederation, unless an article or articles be added thereto,&#x27; in&#x27; conformity  
with our declaration. Should we succeed in obtaining such article or article,  
then you are hereby fully empowered to accede to the Confederacy ,M  
&quot; The political sagaci:y, the insight into the future, manifested  
by the authors ot these instructions, is indeed most admirable.  
Thearticles insisted on by Maryland were inserted; and yet, in  
little more than half a century, we witness the overwhelming pre­  
ponderance of some of the States in the Councils of the Nation,  
i When the apportionment of representation was made at the&#x27;ad op

Slates, which are ambitiously grasping at  
Territories to which in our judgment, ihey  
have not the, least shadow, of exclusive  
rnd.t, will use with greater mode ration the  
increase of wealth and power d( rived from  
those Territories, when acquired than what

be incited by a superiority-of wealth and  
strength, to oppress by open force thc.r less  
wealthy and Yess&#x27; powerful neighbor., yet  
depopulation ,dr consequently, the impo­  
verishment of thos Stater, will neeessanly  
follow, which, by an unfair .conatiuction of  
the confederation may be stripped of a com­  
tndn interest and the common . benefits de­  
sirable from the Western Country. Sup­

puled &quot;po?sf 8sio:i T They cannot ewape  
the least disctruing. Virginia, by selling  
on the most moderate&#x27; terms a small pronoi-  
pion of tho lands in question, would draw in  
toner treasury, vast sums of money, and in  
proportion to tho sums arising Irom such  
sales, would be enabled to lessen her tax­  
es. Lands comparatively cheap, and taxes  
comparatively low, with the land and taxes  
of an adjacent Stat, would quickly drain  
the State, thus disadvantageous circum­  
stanced, of its most useful inhabitants. Its  
wealth and its consequence in the scalo of  
the confederated States, would sink of  
course. A claim so injurious to more than  
ne half, if not the whole of the United  
States, ought to ne supported by the clear­  
est evidence of ihe right. Yet what evi­  
dence of that right has been produced?  
What argunienfs Alleged m&#x27;snnporl, either  
of tin; evidi rice or the right ? None that  
we have heard of, deserving a serious refu­

justice require, that a country, unsettled at  
ihe commencement of this War, claimed  
by the British Crown and reded to it by  
the Treaty of Paris, if wrested from tins  
common enemy by the blood and treasure  
of the 13 istates, should c consrdt-red. as a

official documents.  
  
of THE TITLE ToTHE puBLIC LANds.  
edct of Cession from the State of Vew York, Feb. 19,  
  
1780.  
  
&quot;Whereas nothing under divine Providence,  
can more effectually contribute to the tranquility  
and safety of the United States of America, than  
a federal alliance, on such liberal principles as will  
give satislaction to its respective members; and  
  
whereas the articles of confederation and perpet-  
  
ual union, recommended by the honorable Con­  
gress of the United States of America, have not  
proved acceptable to all the states, it having been  
conceived that a portion of the waste and uncul­  
tivated territory within the limits or claims of cer-  
  
tain states, ought to be appropriated as a common  
  
fund for the expenses of the war; and the people  
of this state of New York, being, on all occasions,  
disposed to manilest their regard for their sister  
states, and their earnest desire to promote the  
general interest and security; and, more especial-  
ly, to accelerate the federal alliance, by removing,  
as far as it depends upon them, the before men­  
tioned impediments to its final accomplishment:  
&quot;Be it enacted, &amp;c. the first section provides  
for ceding the lands, the second is in these words,  
That the territory which may be ceded or relin­  
quished by virtue of this act, either with respect  
to the jurisdiction as well as the right or pre­  
emption of soil, or the right or pre-emption of  
  
soil only, shall be and innure for the use and bene­  
fit of such of the United States as sha! become mem­  
bers of the federal alliance of the said states, and for  
no other use or purpose wchatsoever.&quot; Laws an

Evidently, the most feasible way was for the particular  
States to cede their claims to the Union, under guaran-  
ty that they should be disposed of for the common ben-  
efit of all the members of the federal alliance. It was  
on this ground, that New York passed the act to which  
we have referred, an act which she entitled ‘“‘ an act to  
facilitate the completion of the articles of confederation  
and perpetual union among the United States of Amer-  
ica.”” On this ground, too, Congress resolved, on the  
6th of September, 1780, “that it be earnestly recom-

land to the other States was not without effect;  
for in March, 1730, the Legislature of New York  
passed an act proposing to make the cession on  
terms entirely satisfactory, and which were ul­  
timately carried into effect. Some of the ex­  
pressions in the preamble to thatact deserve to  
be noticed, as they furnish strong evidence of the  
motives and objects of the cession which was’  
subsequently nade. It asserts among’ other  
things, that—notking under Divine Providence  
can more effectually conlribule to the tranquilily  
of the United Slales of America than a federal  
alliance on such liberal principles as will give  
salisfaclion to ils respective members.” And al­  
ludes to the fact that “the arlicles of confeder~  
ation have not proved acceplable to all the  
States.” And assigus_the reason that it had  
been conceived that a portion of the waste and  
uncultivated territory ought to be. appropriated  
as a common fund for the expenses of the war  
and concludes with the expression of an ear­  
nest desire in behalf of the people of the State  
toremove ‘‘the beforementioned impediment.”’  
The whole subject was afterwards reviewed by  
a ecommittee of Congress, in which had been  
referred the law of New York, the instructions  
of the Maryland delegates, and a remonstrance  
of Virginia,ina very able and lucid report, set;  
ting forth the necessity for the corcession, aad  
the object to be obrained by it, and the uses to  
which the lands ought to be appropriated under

«That having duly considered the several matters to them submitted,  
_ they conceive it unnecessary to examine into the merits or policy of the  
instructions or declaration of the general assembly of Maryland, or of the  
remonstrances of the general assembly of Virginia, as they involve ques-  
tions, the discussion of which was declined on mature deliberation, when  
the articles of confederation were debated ; nor, in the opinion of the com-  
mittee, can such questions be now revived with any prospect of concilia-  
  
remove the embarrassments respecting the western country, a liberal sur,  
render of a portion of their territorial claims, since they cannot be preserv-  
ed entire without endangering the stability of the general confederacy ; to  
remind them how indispensably necessary it is to establish the federal uni-

persuaded the wisdom of the respective legislatures will Jead them to a full  
and impartial consideration of a subject so interesting to the United States,  
and so necessary to the happy establishment of the federal union; that they |  
are confirmed in these expectations by a view of the before mentioned act  
of the legislature of New York, submitted to their consideration ; that this  
act is expressly calculated to accelerate the federal allianee, by removing, as  
far as depends on that state, the impediment arising from the western coun-  
try, and for that purpose to yield up a portion of territorial claim for the  
general benefit ; Whereupon,  
  
«+ Resolved, ‘That copies of the several papers referred to the committee  
be transmitted, with a copy of the report, to the legislatures of the several  
states, and that it be earnestly recommended to those states, who have  
claims to the western country, to pass such laws, and give their delegates  
in Congress such powers, as may effectually remove the only obstacle to a  
final ratification of the articles of confederation ; and that the legislature of  
Maryland be earnestly requested to authorize their delegates in Congress to  
subscribe the said articles.*’

“ We think it our duty to instruct on the subject of the confederation, a |  
subject in which, unfortunately, a supposed difference of interest has pro-  
|| duced an almost equal division of sentiments among the several states com-  
posing the union. We say a supposed difference of interests, for if local |  
attachments and prejudices, and the avarice and ambition of individuals, |  
would give way to the dictates of a sound policy, founded on the principles  
of justice (and no other policy but what is founded on those immutable  
principles deserves to be called sound) we flatter ourselves, this apparent  
diversity of interests would soon vanish, and all the states would confeder-  
ate on terms mutually advantageous to all; for they would then perceive  
that no other consideration than one so formed can be lasting. Although  
the pressure of immediate calamities, the dread of their continuance from  
the appearance of disunion, and some other peculiar circumstances, may  
have induced some states to accede to the present confederation, contrary to  
their own interests and judgments, it requires no great share of foresight to  
predict, that when those causes cease to operate, the states which have  
thus acceded to the confederation will consider it as no longer binding, and  
will eagerly embrace the first occasion of asserting their just rights, and se-  
curing their independence. Is it possible that those states who are ambi-  
tiously grasping at territories, to which in our judgment they have not the  
least shadow of exclusive right, will use with greater moderation the in-  
crease of wealth and power derived from those territories, when acquired,  
than what they have displayed in their endeavors to acquire them? We  
think not. We are convinced the same spirit which prompted them to in-  
sist on a claim so extravagant, so repugnant to every principle of justice, so

ineompatible with the gone: wales of all the states, wil urge pam on to  
add oppression to injustice. If they should not be incited by a superiority  
of wealth and strength to oppress by open force their less wealthy and  
less powerful neighbors ; yet depopulation, and consequently the impover- |  
ishment of those states will necessarily follow, which, by an unfair con- |  
struction of the confederation, may be stripped of a common interest, and |  
the common benefits derived from the western country. Suppose, for in- |  
stance, Virginia indisputably possessed of the extensive and fertile country |  
to which she has set up a claim, what would be the probable consequence  
to Maryland of such an undisturbed and undisputed possession? ‘They |  
cannot escape the least discerning.  
  
«+ Virginia, by selling on the most reasonable terms a small proportion of |  
the lands in question, would draw into her treasury vast sums of money ;  
and in proportion to the sums arising from such sales, would be enabled  
to lessen her taxes. Lands comparatively eheap, and taxes comparatively  
low, with the lands and taxes of an adjacent state, would quickly drain the |  
state thus disadvantageously circumstanced of its most useful inhabitants ; |  
its wealth and its consequences in the scale of the confederated states would |  
sink of course. A claim so injurious to more than one half, if not the |  
whole of the United States, ought to be supported by the clearest evidence  
of the right. Yet what evidences of that right have been produced? What ||  
arguments alleged in support either of the evidence or the right? None |  
that we have heard of deserving a serious refutation. ]  
  
“Tt has been said, that some of the delegates of a neighboring state have }  
declared their opinion of the impracticability of governing the extensive |  
  
| dominion claimed by that state. Hence also the necessity was admitted of ||  
  
dividing its territory, and erecting a new state under the auspices and di- !  
rection of the elder, from whom no doubt it would receive its form of gov- |  
ernment, to whom it would be bound by some alliance or confederacy, and 1  
by whose councils it would be influenced. Such a measure, if ever attempt-  
ed, would certainly be.opposed by the other states as inconsistent with the |  
letter and spirit of the proposed confederation. Should it take place by es- |  
tablishing a sub-confederacy, imperium in imperio, the state possessed of |  
  
this extensive dominion must then either submit to all the inconveniences |  
of an overgrown and unwieldly government, or suffer the authority of Con. | |  
gress to interpose at a future time, and to lop off a part of its territory, to | |  
be erected into a new and free state, and admitted into the confederation on !  
such conditions as shall be settled by nine states. If it is necessary for the  
happiness and tranquillity of a state overgrown, that Congress should here-  
after interfere and divide its territory, why is the claim to that territory now  
made, and so pertinaciously insisted on? We can suggest to ourselves  
but two motives ; either the declaration of relinquishing at some future pe-

State of New York set the example, and made the sacrifice

&quot;Wlirreas nothing under Divine Providence can more

vor the wasto and uncultivated territory within the limits 01

to ai-cclerale tiro federal alliance, by removing, as lar as

Its iitral accomplishment: lie it there lore unacted.&quot;  
Arid then followed a resolution of the old Congress accepting  
this territorial grant from tho State of New York, and  
inviting the other Slates to do the like. Sir, the next State  
in order was Virginia. There had been a strong rernonsirance  
presented by Virginia to this claim of New York to

the Northwest, the whole of which was forg

That that State “ considered themselves justly  
entitled to a right, in common with the other  
members of the Union, to that extensive tract of  
country which lies to the westward of the fron-  
tiers of the United States, the property of which  
was not vested in or granted to individuals at the  
commencement of the present war: That the  
same had been or might thereafter be gained from  
the King of Great Britain, or the native Indians,  
BY THE BLOOD AND TREASURE OF ALL, and ought,  
therefore, to bea common Estate, to be granted  
out on terms beneficial to all the United States.”  
  
And again she says, in instructions to her dele-  
gates in the Congress of the United States:  
  
“We are convinced, policy and justice require  
that a country, unsettled at the commencement of  
this war, claimed by the British Crown, and ced-  
ed to it by the treaty of Paris, if wrested from the  
COMMON ENEMY, BY THE BLOOD AND TREASURE OF  
THE THIRTEEN S1aTes, should be considered as a  
COMMON PROPERTY, subject to be parcelled out by  
Congress into free, convenient, and independent  
Governments, in such manner, and at such times,  
as the wisdom of that assembly shall hereafter  
direct.”

fore the Lsnd Committee of the House of  
Representatives, seems to be more in con­  
formity to the objects of the cession of tile  
public lands made both by New York and i  
Virginia than any measure heretofore propo- &#x27;  
eed.  
The deed of cession from the State of New  
York was made on the 1st of March, 1781,  
and was accepted by Congress the 29th of  
October, 1782. One of the conditions was, :  
that the lauds ceded to the United .States,  
“shall be and enure for the use and benefit ot  
such of tho United States as shall become  
members of tho federal alliance of the said  
States, and fur no other use or benefit what­  
ever”  
The Virginia deed of cession was executed &#x27;  
and Accepted on the lstduy of March, 1784. :  
One of the conditions of this cession is as fol­  
lows ;  
“That all the lands within the territory so  
ceded to the United States, and not reserved 1

&quot;Instrućtions of the General Assembly of Mary­  
land to George Plater, William Paca, William Car­  
michael, John Henry, James Forbes, and Daniel of St  
Thomas Jenifer, Esqs.  
&quot;&quot;Gentlenen: Having conferred upon you a trust  
of the highest nature, it is evident we place great  
confidence in your integrity, abilities, and seal to  
promote the general welfare of the United States and  
the particular interest of this State, where the latter  
is not incompatible with the former; but, to add  
greater weight to your proceedings in Congress, and  
take away all suspicion that the opinions you there  
deliver and the votes you give may be the mere opin­  
ions of individuals, and not resulting from your  
knowledge of the sense and deliberate judgment of  
the State you represent, we think it our duty to in­  
struct as followeth on the subject of the Coufedera­  
tion--a subject in which, unfortunately, a supposed  
difference of interest has produced an almost equal  
division of sentiments among the several States com­  
posing the Union. We say a supposed difference of  
interests; for, if local attachments and prejudice  
and the avari e and ambition of individuals would  
give way to the dictates of a sound policy, founded on  
the principles of justice, (and no other policy but  
what is founded on those immutable principles de­  
serves to be called sound.) we flatter ourselves this  
apparent diversity of interests would soon vanish, and  
all the States would confederate on terms mutually ad  
vantageous to fl., for they would then perceive that no  
other Confederation than one so formed can be lasting.  
Ithough the pressure of immediate calamities, the  
dread of their continuance from the appearance of  
disunion, and some other peculiar circumstances may  
have induced some States to accede to the present  
Confederation, contrary to their own interests and  
judgments, it requires no great share of foresight to  
predict that, when those causes cease to operate, the  
States which have thus acceded to the Confederation  
will consider it as no longer binding, and will eager­  
ly embrace the first occasion of asserting their just  
rights and securing their independence. Is it possible  
that those States who are ambitiously grasping at  
territoties to which, in our judgment, they have not  
the least shadow of exclusive right, will use with  
greater moderation the increase of wealth and power  
derived from those territories, when acquired, than  
what they have displayed in their endeavors to ac­  
  
am  
I quire them? We think  
 same spirit which hath prompted them to insist on a  
claim so extravagant, so repugnant to every pe  
ple of justice, so incompatible with the general wel­  
fare of all the States, will urge them on to add op­  
pression to injustice. If they should not be incited  
by a superiority of wealth and strength to oppress  
open force their less wealthy and less powerful  
neighbors, yet depopulation, and consequently the  
impoverishment of those States, will necessaril  
 low, which, by an unfair consarnction of the Con­  
federation, may be stripped of a common interest and  
 the common benents derivable from the western  
 country. Suppose, for instancee, Virginia indispu­  
tably possessed of the extensive and fertile country  
to which she has set up a claim, what would be the  
probable consequences to Maryland of such an undis  
turbed and undisputed possession? They cannot es­  
cape the least discerning. Virginia, by selling on  
the most moderate terms a small proportion of the  
lands in question, would draw into her treasury vast  
sums of money, and in proportion to the sums a­  
rising from such sales, would be enabled to lessen  
her taxes. Lands comparatively cheap and taxes  
comparatively low, with the lands and taxes of an  
adjacent State, would quickly drain the State thus  
advantageonsly efrcumstanced of its most useful in­  
habitants; its wealth and its consequence in the scale

fused to become members ot the Confederation  
unless Virginia and other land States would a­  
gree to share their lands with all the members  
of the Confederacy. The General Assembly of  
Maryland, in 1770, sent instructions to the dele­  
gates of that State in Congress, of which the  
following is un oxtract:  
“Virginia, by selling on the most moderate  
terms a small proportion of the lauds iu question,  
would draw into her treasury vast sums of  
money, and, in proportion to the sums arisiug  
from such sales, would ho enabled to lessen her  
taxes. Lands comparatively cheap, and taxes  
comparatively low, with the lands and taxes of  
an adjacent State, would quickly draiu tho State  
thus disadvantageously circumstanced, ot its  
most useful inhabitants: its wealth, and its con­  
sequence iu the scale of tho confederated States,  
would sink, of course.”  
To remove this obstacle iu tho way ot tho U­  
nion, Virgiuia, iu 1784, executed her deed ot  
cession, granting all her territory beyond the  
Ohio river to tho United States, for the use aud  
benefit of all tho States, “Virginia inclusive.”—  
From that day to the present, however, iu spite  
of the conditions of tho deed,Congress has graut  
ed these lands to particular States to tho great  
injury of Virginia. What Maryland said would  
be Virginia&#x27;s condition if she retained her lauds,  
is now the condition of tho Western States t

proportioned to the charge and expenditure  
in each.  
In order to show the state of feeling which  
existed at that early day in relation to the  
waste land, I quote a portion of the instruc­  
tions given by the Legislature of the State  
of Maryland, in 1779, to her delegates to  
Congress:  
&quot;It is possible, that those States, which are  
ambitiously grasping at Territories to which,  
in our judgment, they have not the least  
shadow of exclusive right, will use with  
greater moderation the increase of wealth  
and power derived from those territories,  
when acquired, than what they have display­  
ed in their endeavors to acquire them? We  
think not- we are convinced the same spirit  
which hath prompted them to insist on a claim  
so extravagant, so repugnant to every prin­  
ciple of justice, so incompatible with the gen­  
eral welfare of the States, will urge them on  
to add oppression to injustice, If they should  
strength, to oppress by open force their less  
wealthy and less powerful neighbors, yet de  
population and, consequently, the impover  
ishment of those States, will necessarily fol-

low  
confe  
interest and the common benefits derivable  
from the Western Country. Suppose Vir­  
ginia, for instance, indisputably possessed of  
the extensive and fertile country to which  
she has set up claim; what would be the pro­  
bable consequences to Maryland of such an  
indisturhed and undisputed possession?  
They cannot escape the least discerning.  
Virginia, by selling on the most moderate

lands became a subject of controversy be­  
tween the colonies even before the Confed­  
eration, and was an early obstacle to the  
organization of any Government for the  
protection of their common interests.  
The colonies whose charter from the Crown  
extended over none of the unoccupied lands  
claimed, in the language of the instructions  
of Maryland in 1779, to her delegates in  
Congress:  
That a country unsettled at the com­  
mencement of this war, claimed by the  
British Crown, and ceded to it by the treaty  
at Paris, if wrested from the common  
enemy by the blood and treasure of the  
thirteen States, should be considered as a  
common property, subject to be parcelled out  
by Congress into free, convenient, and in­  
dependent Governments, in such manner  
and at such times as the wisdom of that as­

26 Maryland’s Influence upon  
  
will eagerly embrace the first occasion of asserting their just  
rights and securing their independence. Is it possible that  
those States, who are ambitiously grasping at territories, to  
which, in our judgment, they have not the least shadow of  
exclusive right, will use with greater moderation the in-  
crease of wealth and power derived from those territories,  
when acquired, than what they have displayed in their en-  
deavors to acquire them? We think not... . Suppose, for  
instance, Virginia indisputably possessed of the extensive  
and fertile country to which she has set up a claim, what  
would be the probable consequences to Maryland? . .  
Virginia, by selling on the most moderate terms, a small  
proportion of the lands in question, would draw into her  
treasury vast sums of money and . . . would be enabled  
to lessen her taxes: lands comparatively cheap and taxes  
comparatively low, with the lands and taxes of an adjacent  
State, would quickly drain the State, thus disadvantageously  
circumstanced, of its most useful inhabitants, its wealth; and  
its consequence, in the scale of the confederated States, would  
sink of course. A claim so injurious to more than one-half,  
if not the whole of the United States, ought to be supported  
by the clearest evidence of the right. Yet what evidences of  
that right have been produced? . . . We are convinced,  
policy and justice require that a country unsettled at the  
commencement of this war, claimed by the British crown,  
and ceded to it by the treaty of Paris, if wrested from the  
common enemy by the blood and treasure of the thirteen  
States, should be considered as a common property, subject  
to be parcelled out by Congress into free, convenient and  
independent governments, in such manner and at such time  
as the wisdom of that assembly shall hereafter direct. . . .

That having duly considered the several matters  
to them submitted, they conceive it unnecessary to  
examine into the merits or policy of the instructions  
or declaration of the general assembly of Mary-  
land, or of the remonstrance of the general assem-  
bly of Virginia, as they involve questions, a discus-  
sion of which was declined on mature consideration,  
when the articles of Confederation were debated;  
nor, in the opinion of the committee, can such  
questions be now revived with any prospect of con-  
ciliation: that it appears more advisable to press  
upon those states which can remove the embarrass-  
ments respecting the western country, a liberal sur-  
render of a portion of their territorial claims, since  
they cannot be preserved entire without endanger-  
ing the stability of the general Confederacy; to  
remind them how indispensably necessary it is to  
establish the Federal Union on a fixed and perma-  
nént basis, and on principles acceptable to all its  
respective members; how essential to public credit  
and confidence, to the support of our army, to the

wisdom of the respective legislatures will lead them  
to a full and impartial consideration of a subject so  
interesting to the United States, and so necessary to  
the happy establishment of the Federal union; that  
they are confirmed in these expectations by a  
review of the before-mentioned act of the legislature  
of New York, submitted to their consideration; that  
this act is expressly calculated to accelerate the Fed-  
eral alliance by removing, as far as depends on that  
state, the impediment arising from the western coun-  
try, and for that purpose to yield up a portion of  
territorial claim for the general benefit; whereupon,  
Resolved, That copies of the several papers re-  
ferred to the committee, be transmilted, with a copy  
of the report, to the legislatures of the several states,  
and that it be earnestly recommended to those  
states, who have claims to the western country, to  
pass such laws, and give their delegates in congress  
such powers as may effectually remove the only ob-  
stacle to a final ratification of the Articles of Con-  
federation; and that the legislature of Maryland be

States in congress assembled, and would pay their propor-  
tions of all money issued or borrowed by congress, or  
which might thereafter be issued or borrowed for the

and faithfully execute all treaties which had been or

United States in congress assembled, relative to peace

proposed by our delegates to the confederation in conse-

rejection thereof.  
  
We do therefore declare that we esteem it fundamen-.

sovereign and independent states ought to be founded ;.  
that this or any other State entering into such confedera-

out, or otherwise disposed of for the common benefit of  
all the states; and that the money arising from the sale  
of those lands, or the quit rents reserved thereon, may be  
deemed and taken as part of the monies belonging to the  
United States, and as such be appropriated by congress  
towards defraying the expences of the war, and the pay-  
ment of interest on monies borrowed, or to be borrowed,  
on the credit of the United States from France or any  
other European power, or for any other joint benefit of  
the United States.  
  
We do further declare that the exclusive claim set up by  
some states to the whole western country by extending  
their limits to the Mississippi or South Sea, is in our judg-  
ment without any solid foundation, and we religiously  
believe, will, if submitted to, prove ruinous to this state,  
and to other states similarly circumstanced, and in pro-  
cess of time be the means of subverting the confederation,  
if it be not explained by the additional article or articles  
proposed, so as to obviate all misconstruction and misin-  
terpretation of those parts thereof that are hereinbefore  
specified. .  
  
We entered into this just and necessary war to defend  
our rights against the attacks of avarice and ambition;  
we have made the most strenuous efforts during the  
prosecution of it, and we are resolved to continue them  
until Independence is firmly established. Hitherto we  
have successfully resisted, and we hope, with the bless-  
ing of Providence, for final success. If the enemy,  
encouraged by the appearance of divisions among us,  
and the hope of our not confederating, should carry on  
hostilities longer than they otherwise would have done,  
let those be responsible for the prolongation of the war,  
and all its consequent calamities, who by refusing to  
comply with requisitions so just and reasonable have

VIRGINIA, to-wit:  
IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THE 14TH DECEMBER, 1779,  
  
THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF  
VIRGINIA TO THE DELEGATES OF THE UNITED  
AMERICAN STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.  
  
The general assembly of Virginia, ever attentive to the  
recommendations of congress, and desirous to give the  
great council of the United States every satisfaction in  
their power, consistent with the rights and constitution of  
their own commonwealth, have enacted a law to prevent  
present settlements on the north-west side of the Ohio  
river, and will on all occasions endeavour to manifest their  
attachment to the common interest of America, and their  
earnest wishes to remove every cause of jealousy and pro-  
mote that mutual confidence and harmony between the  
different states so essential to their true interest and  
safety.  
  
Strongly impressed with these sentiments, the general  
assembly of Virginia can not avoid expressing their sur-  
prise and concern, upon the information that congress  
had received and countenanced petitions from certain per-  
sons stiling themselves the Vandalia and Indiana company’s,  
asserting claims to lands in defiance of the civil authority,  
jurisdiction and laws of this commonwealth, and offering  
to erect a separate government within the territory thereof.  
Should congress assume a jurisdiction, and arrogate to  
themselves a right of adjudication, not only unwarranted  
by, but expressly contrary to the fundamental principles  
of the confederation ; superseding or controuling the inter

nal policy, civil regulations and municipal laws of this or  
any other state, it would be a violation of public faith,  
introduce a most dangerous precedent which might here-  
after be urged to deprive of territory or subvert the sov-  
ereignty and government of any one or more of the United  
States, and establish in congress a power which in pro-  
cess of time must degenerate into an intolerable despotism.  
  
It is notorious that the Vandalia and Indiana company’s  
are not the only claimers of large tracts of land under  
titles repugnant to our laws; that several men of great in-  
fluence in some of the neighboring states are concerned in  
partnerships with the Earl of Dunmore and other subjects  
of the British king, who, under purchases from the Indians,  
claim extensive tracts of country between the Ohio and  
Mississippi rivers; and that propositions have been made  
to congress evidently calculated to secure and guarranty  
such purchases; so that under colour of creating a common  
fund, had those propositions been adopted, the public would  
have been duped by the arts of individuals, and great part  
of the value of the unappropriated lands converted to  
private purposes.  
  
Congress have lately described and ascertained the  
boundaries of these United States, as an ultimatum in  
their terms of peace. The United States hold no territory  
but in right of some one individual state in the Union;  
the territory of each state from time immemorial, hath  
been fixed and determined by their respective charters,  
there being no other rule or criterion to judge by; should  
these in any instance (when there is no disputed territory  
between particular states) be abridged without the con-  
sent of the states affected by it, general confusion must  
ensue ; each state would be subjected in its turn to the  
encroachments of the others, and a field opened for future  
wars and bloodshed; nor can any arguments be fairly urged  
to prove that any particular tract of country, within the °  
limits claimed by congress on behalf of the United States,  
is not part of the chartered territory of some one of them,

but must militate with equal force against the right of  
the United States in general; and tend to prove such tract  
of country (if north-west of the Ohio river) part of the  
British province of Canada.  
  
When Virginia acceded to the articles of confedera-  
tion, her rights of sovereignty and jurisdiction within her  
own territory were reserved and secured to her, and can-  
not now be infringed or altered without her consent. She  
could have no latent views of extending that territory;  
because it had long before been expressly and clearly de-  
fined in the act which formed her new government.  
  
The general assembly of Virginia have heretofore  
offered congress to furnish lands out of their territory on  
the north-west side of the Ohio river, without purchase  
money, to the troops on continental establishment of such  
of the confederated states as had not unappropriated  
lands for that purpose, in conjunction with the other  
states holding unappropriated lands, and in such propor-  
tion as should be adjusted and settled by congress; which  
offer when accepted they will most cheerfully make good  
to the same extent, with the provision made by law for  
their troops, if congress shall think fit to allow the like  
quantities of land to the other troops on continental  
establishment. But although the general assembly of  
Virginia would make great sacrifices to the common inter-  
est of America (as they have already done on the subject  
of representation ) and will be ready to listen to any just  
and reasonable propositions for removing the ostenszble  
causes of delay to the complete ratification of the con-  
federation, they find themselves impelled by the duties  
which they owe to their constituents, to their posterity,  
to their country, and to the United States in general, to  
remonstrate and protest; and they do hereby, in the name  
and on behalf of the commonwealth of Virginia, expressly  
protest against any jurisdiction or right of adjudication  
in congress, upon the petitions of the Vandalia or Indiana
