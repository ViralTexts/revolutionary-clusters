a safe and permanent one. It is proper that we should examine this matter. We contend that the radical vice in the old confederation is, that the laws of the Union apply only to States in their corporate capacity. Has not every man, who has been in our legislature, experienced the truth of this position? It is inseparable from the disposition of bodies, who have a constitutional power of resistance, to examine the merits of a law. This has ever been the case with the federal requisitions. In this examination, not being furnished with those lights, which directed the deliberations of the general government; and incapable of embracing the general interests of the Union, the States have almost uniformly weighed the requisitions by their own local interests; and have only executed them so far as answered their particular conveniency or advantage. Hence there have ever been thirteen different bodies to judge of the measures of Congress—and the operations of government have been distracted by their taking different courses: Those, which were to be benefited have complied with the requisitions; others have totally disregarded them. Have not all of us been witnesses to the unhappy embarrassments which resulted from these proceedings? Even during the late war, wh

cuted them in some degree. But New Hampshire, who has not suffered at all, is totally delinquent: North-Carolina is totally delinquent: Many others have contributed in a very small proportion; and Pennsylvania and New-York are the only states, which have perfectly discharged their Federal duty.  
From the delinquency of those States who have suffered little by the war, we naturally conclude, that they have made no efforts; and a knowledge of human nature will teach us, that their ease and security have been a principal cause of their want of exertion. While danger is distant, its impression is weak, and while it affects only our neighbours we have few motives to provide against it. Sir, if we have national objects to pursue, we must have national revenues. If you make requisitions and they are not complied with, what is to be done? It has been well observed, that to coerce the States is one of the maddest projects that was ever devised. A failure of compliance will never be confined to a single State: This being the case, can we suppose it wise to hazard a civil war? Suppose Massachusetts or any large State should refuse; and Congress should attempt to compel them; would they not have influence to procure assistance, especially from those states who are in the same situation as themselves? What picture does this idea present to our view? A complying state at war with a non-complying state: Congress marching the troops of one state into the bosom of another: This state collecting auxiliaries and forming perhaps a majority against its Federal head. Here is a nation at war with itself. Can any reasonable man be well disposed towards a government which makes war and carnage the only means of supporting itself? a government that can exist only by the sword? Every such war must involve the innocent with the guilty. This single consideration should be sufficient to dispose every peaceable citizen against such a government.  
But can we believe that one state will ever suffer itself to be used as an instrument of coercion? The thing is a dream. It is impossible. Then we are brought to this dilemma: Either a federal standing army is to enforce the requisitions, or the Federal Treasury is left without supplies, and the government without support. What, Sir, is the cure for this great evil? Nothing, but to enable the national laws to operate on individuals, in the same manner as those of the states do. This is the true reasoning upon the subject, Sir. The gentlemen appear to acknowledge its force; and yet while they yield to the principle, they seem to fear its application to the government.  
What then shall we do? Shall we take the Old Confederation, as the basis of a new system? Can this be the object of the gentlemen? certainly not. Will any man who entertains a wish for the safety of his country, trust the sword and the purse with a singl

We have shewn how they have been conducted, and how they have been destroyed. Weakness in the head has produced resistence in the members: This has been the immediate parent of civil war: Auxiliary force has been invited, and a foreign power has annihilated their liberties and their name. Thus Philip subverted the Amphyctionic, and Rome the Achæan Republic.  
We shall do well, sir, not to deceive ourselves with the favorable events of the late war. Common danger prevented the operation of the ruinous principle, in its full extent: But since the peace, we have experienced the evils; we have felt the poison of the system in its unmingled purity.  
Without dwelling any longer on this subject, I shall proceed to the question immediately before the committee.  
In order that the committee may understand clearly the principles on which the general convention acted, I think it necessary to explain some preliminary circumstances.  
Sir, the natural situation of this country seems to divide its interests into different classes. There are navigating and non-navigating States. The Northern are properly the navigating States: The Southern appear to possess neither the means nor the spirit of navigation. This difference of situation naturally produces a dissimilarity of interests and views respecting foreign commerce. It was the interest of the Northern States, that there should be no restraints on their navigation, and that they should have full power, by a majority in Congress, to make commercial regulations in favour of their own, and in restraint of the navigation of foreigners. The Southern States wished to impose a restraint on the Northern, by requiring that two thirds in Congress, should be requisite to pass an act in regulation of commerce: They were apprehensive that the restraints of a navigation law, would discourage foreigners, and by obliging them to employ the shipping of the Northern States would probably enhance their freight. This being the case, they insisted strenuously on having this provision engrafted in the constitution; and the Northern States were as anxious in opposing it. On the other hand, the small states seeing themselves embraced by the confederation upon equal terms, wished to retain the advantages which they already possessed: The large states, on the contrary, thought it improper that Rhode Island and Delaware should enjoy an equal suffrage with themselves: From these sources a delicate and difficult contest arose. It became necessary, therefore, to compromise; or the Convention must have dissolved without affecting any thing. Would it have been wise and prudent in that body, in this critical situation, to have deserted their country? No. Every man who hears me—every wise man in the United States, would have condemned them. The Convention were obliged to appoint a Committee for accommodation: In this Committee, the arrangement was formed, as it now stands; and their report was accepted. It was a delicate point; and it was necessary that all parties should be indulged. Gentlemen will see, that if there had not been a unanimity, nothing could have been done: For the Convention had no power to establish, but only to recommend a government. Any other system would have been impracticable. Let a Convention be called to-morrow. Let them meet twenty times; nay, twenty thousand times; they will have the same difficulties to encounter; the same clashing interests to reconcile.  
But dismissing these reflections, let us consider how far the arrangement is in itself entitled to the approbation of this body. We will examine it upon its own merits.  
The first thing objected to, is that clause which allows a representation for three fifths of the negroes. Much has been said of the impropriety of representing men, who have no will of their own. Whether this be reasoning or declamation, I will not presume to say. It is the unfortunate situation of the Southern States, to have a great part of their population, as well as property in blacks. The regulation complained of was one result of the spirit of accommodation, which governed the Convention; and without this indulgence, no union could possibly have been formed. But, Sir, considering some peculiar advantages which we derive from them, it is entirely just that they should be gratified. The Southern States possess certain staples, tobacco, rice, indigo, &amp;c. which must be capital objects in treaties of commerce with foreign nations; and the advantage which they necessarily procure in these treaties, will be felt throughout all the States. But the justice of this plan will appear in another view. The best writers on government have held that representation should be compounded of persons and property. This rule has been adopted, as far as it could be, in the Constitution of NewYork. It will however by no means be admitted, that the slaves are considered altogether as property. They are men, though degraded to the condition of slavery. They are persons known to the municipal laws of the states which they inhabit, as well as to the laws of nature. But representation and taxation go together—and one uniform rule ought to apply to both. Would it be just to compute these slaves in the assessment of taxes; and discard them from the estimate in the apportionment of representatives? Would it be just to impose a singular burthen, without conferring some adequate advantage?  
Another circumstance ought to be considered. The rule we have been speaking of is a general rule, and applies to all the States. Now, you have a great number of people in your State, which are not represented at all; and have no voice in your government: These will be included in the enumeration—not two fifths—nor three fifths, but the whole. This proves that the advantages of the plan are not confined to the southern States, but extend to other parts of the Union.  
I now proceed to consider the objection with regard to the number of representatives, as it now stands: I am persuaded the system, in this respect, stands on a better footing than the gentlemen imagine.  
  
It has been asserted that it will be in the power of Congress to reduce the number. I acknowledge, that there are no direct words of prohibition. But, I contend, that the true and genuine construction of the clause gives Congress no power whatever to reduce the representation below the number, as it now stands. Although they may limit, they can never diminish the number. One representa

Mr. Hamilton. In order that the committee may understand  
clearly the principles on which the General Convention acted, I think  
it necessary to explain some preliminary circumstances.  
  
Sir, the natural situation of this country seems to divide its inter-  
ests into different classes. There are navigating and non-navigating  
States —the Northern are properly the navigating States : the South-  
ern appear to possess neither the means nor the spirit of navigation.  
This difference of situation naturally produces a dissimilarity of  
interest and views respecting foreign commerce. It was the interest  
of the Northern States that there should be no restraints on their  
navigation, and that they should have full power, by a majority in  
Congress, to make commercial regulations in favor of their own, and  
in restraint of the navigation of foreigners. The Southern States  
wished to impose a restraint on the Northern, by requiring that two-  
thirds in Congress should be requisite to pass an act in regulation of  
commerce: they were appprelensive that the restraints of a naviga-  
tion law would discourage foreigners, and by obliging them to employ  
the shipping of the Northern States would probably enhance their  
freight. ‘This being the case, they insisted strenuomsly on having  
this provision engrafted in the constitution ; and the Northern States  
were as anxious in opposing it. On the other band, the small States  
seeing themselves embraced by the confederation upon equal terms,  
wished to retain the advantages whicl they already possessed: the  
large States, on the contrary, thought it improper that Rhode Island  
and Delaware should enjoy an equal suffrage with themselves: from  
these sources a delicate and difficult contest arose. It became neces-  
sary, therefore, to compromise; or the Convention must have  
dissolved without effecting any thing. Would it have been wise and  
prudent in that body, in this critical situation, to have deserted their  
country? No. Every man who hears me—every wise man in the  
United States, would have condemned them. The Convention were  
obliged to appoint a committee for accommodation. In this com-  
mittee the arrangement was formed as it now stands; and their  
  
report was accepted. It was a delicate point; and it was necessary  
that all parties should be indulged. Gentlemen will see, that if there  
had not been a unanimity, nothing could have been done: for the  
Convention had no power to establish, but only to recommend a gov-  
ernment. Any other system would have been impracticable. Let a

Convention be called to-morrow—-let them meet twenty times; nay,  
twenty thousand times; they will have the same difficulties to encoun-  
ter ; the same clashing interests to reconcile.  
  
But dismissing these reflections, let us consider how far the ar-  
rangement is in itself eutitled to the approbation of this body. We  
will examine it upon its own merits.  
  
The first thing objected to, is that clause which allows a represen-  
tation for three-fifths of the negroes. Much has been said of the  
impropriety of representing men, who have no will of their own.  
Whether this be reasoning or declamation, I will pot presume to say.  
It is the unfortunate situation of the southern states, to have a great  
part of their population, as well as property, in blacks. The regula-  
tions complained of was one result of the spirit of accommodation,  
which governed the convention; and without this indulgence, no  
union could possibly have been formed. But, sir, considering some  
peculiar advantages which we derived from them, it is entirely just  
that they should be gratified. The southern states possess certain  
staples, tobacco, rice, indigo, &amp;c., which must be capital objects in  
treaties of commerce with foreign nations ; and the advantage which  
they necessarily procure in these treaties will be felt throughout all  
the states. But the justice of this plan will appear in another view.  
The best writers on government have held that representation should  
be compounded of persons and property. This rule has been adop-  
ted. as far as it could be, in the Constitution of New-York. It will,  
ho vever, by no means, be admitted, that the slaves are considered  
altogether as property. ‘They are men, though degraded to the con-  
dition of slavery. They are persons known to the musicipal  
laws of the states which they inhabit as well as to the laws of na-  
ture. But representation and taxation go together—and one uni-  
form rule ought to apply to both. Would it be just to compute  
these slaves in the assessment of taxes, and discard them from the  
estimate in the apportionment of representatives ? Would it be just  
to impose a singular burthen, without conferring some adequate  
advantage ?  
  
Another circumstance ought to be considered. The rule we have  
been speaking of is a general rule, and applies to all the states.  
Now, you have a great number of people in your state, which are not  
represented at all; and have no voice in your government: these  
will be included in the enumeration — not two-fifths — nor three-  
fifths, but the whole. This proves that the advantages of the plan  
are not confined to the southern states, but extend to other parts of  
the Union.  
  
Mr. M. Smith. I shall make no reply to the arguments offered by  
the hon. gentleman to justify the rule of apportionment fixed by this  
clause: for though Lam confident they might be easily refuted, yet  
Iam persuaded we must yield this point, in accommodation to the  
southern states. The amendment therefore proposes no alteration to  
the clause in this respect.

then, what was the intention of the Constitution? The  
words of it were used out of delicacy, so as not to offend  
some in the convention whose feelings were abhorrent ty  
slavery ; but we there entered into an agreement that siaves  
should be considered as property. Slavery would stil! hayo  
  
continued, if no Constitution had been made.  
  
the principles on which the general convention acted, I |  
  
think it necessary to explain some preliminary circutn-  
stances.  
  
** Sir, the natural situation of this country seems to divide  
its interest into different classes. ‘There are navigating and  
non-navigating States—the northern are properly the navi-  
gating States ; the southern appear to possess neither the  
means nor the spirit of navigation. This difference of sit-  
uation naturally produces a dissimilarity of interests and  
It was the interest  
of the northern States that there should be norestraints on  
their navigation, and that they should have full power, by  
a majority in Congress, to make commercial regulations in  
  
| favor of their own, and in restraint of the navigation of  
  
foreigners. The southern States wished to impose a re-  
straint on the northern, by requiring that two thirds ia  
  
Congress should be requisite to pass an act in regulation of |  
  
commerce; they were apprehensive that the restraints of  
  
a navigation law would discourage foreigners, and by oblig- |  
  
ing them to employ the shipping of the northern States,  
would probably enhance theirfreight. This being the case,  
  
they insisted strenuously on having this provision engrafted |  
in the Constitution; and the northern States were as anx- |  
  
ious in opposing it.” * * ° ° 7

When the Constitution was submitted to  
the State for ratification, Alexander Hamil-  
ton, in the New York Convention, remarked:  
  
&quot;It has been observed, to coerce the States  
is one of the maddest projects that was ever  
devised. A failure of compliance will ever  
bo confined to a single State. This being the  
case, can we suppose it wise to hazard a civil

to our view. A complying State at war with  
a non-oomph Iiil&#x27; State; Congress marching  
the troops of one State into the bosom of an-  
other; this State collecting auxiliaries and ;  
forming, perhaps, a majority against the Fed-  
eral head. Here is a nation at war with itself.  
Can any reasonable man be well disposed to- j

a government that can exist only by the  
sword. Every such war must involve the in-  
nocent with the guilty. This single consider-  
ation should be sufficient to dispose every !  
peaceable citizen against such a government.  
But can we believe that one State will ever ,  
puffer itself to be used as an instrument of co- j  
ercion? The thing is a dream; it is impossi-  
ble.&quot;  
  
Gov. Ellsworth, of Connecticut, who was a  
prominent member of the Federal Conven-  
tion, while explaining the proposed Constitu- &#x27;  
tion to the Conventiop of that Stato which  
subsequently ratified it, said:  
  
&quot;Hence we see how necessary for the Union  
is a coercive force. The only question is,  
shall it be a coercion of law, or a coercion of |  
arms? There is no other possible alternative.  
Where will those who oppose a coercion of  
law come nut? Where will they end? A  
necessary consequence of their principles is a  
war of the States, one against the other. I

In the New York Convention, Mr. Hamilton (who was also  
. a member of the Federal Convention) said: ‘“ We contend  
that the radical vice in the old confederation is, that laws of  
the Union apply only to States in their corporate capacity.  
Has not every man who has been in our Legislature expe-  
rienced the truth of this position? It is inseparable from  
the depositions of bodies who have a constitutional power of  
resistance, to examine the merits of a law. In this exami-

nation, not being furnished with those lights which directed  
the deliberations of the General Government, and incapable  
of embracing the general interests of the Union, the States  
have almost uniformly weighed the requisitions by their own  
local interests, and have only executed them so far as answered  
their particular convenience and advantage. Hence there  
have been thirteen different bodies to judge the measures of  
Congress, and the operations of Government have been dis-  
tracted by their taking different courses. Those which were  
to be benefitted have complied with the requisition, others  
have totally disregarded them. Have not all of us been  
witnesses of the unhappy embarrassments which resulted  
from these proceedings? Then, after some details, showing  
that two States only “had perfectly discharged their federal  
duty,” “that two others had been totally delinquent,” and  
the remaining nine partially so, he continues: ‘ What, sir,  
is the eure for this great evil? Nothing, but to enable the  
national laws to operate on individuals in the same manner as  
those of the States do. This is the true reasoning upon the sub-  
ject, sir. The gentlemen appear to acknowledge its force;  
‘yet while they yield to the principle, they seem to fear its  
application to the Government.” (2 Elliot’s Debates, 231-3.)  
Those who will take the trouble to read this speech will per-  
ceive the speaker did not refer exclusively to requisitions  
either for men or for money, but to the whole subject of  
requisitions upon which the Congress of the Confederation  
were dependent for both. His reasoning is alike applicable  
to each. Indeed, it must be so in the nature of things. Th

** Much has been sald of the impropriety of representing  
men who have no will of theirown. Whether this be rea-  
soning Or declamation I will not presume tosay. It isthe  
unfortunate situation of the southern States to have a  
eat part of their population, as well as property, in blacks.  
  
The regulation complained of was one result of the spirit  
  
| of accommodation which Cee the Convention, and  
  
without thisindulgence no Union could possibly have been  
formed. And, sir, considering some peculiar advantages  
which we derive, it is entirely just that they should be  
gratified. The southern States possess certain staples, to-  
bacco, rice, indigo, &amp;c., which must now be capital objects  
in treaties of commerce with foreign nations; and the ad-  
vantages which they necessarily procure in these treaties  
will be felt throughout all the States.  
  
“It became necessary, therefore, to compromise, or the  
Convention would have dissolved without effecting any-  
thing. Would it have been wise and prudent in that body  
in this critical situation, to have deserted their country &gt;  
  
No. Every man who hears me, every wise man in the  
United States, would have condemned them. The Conven-  
tion were obliged to appoint a committee for accommoda-  
tion. In this committee the arrangement was formed as it  
now stands, and theirreport was accepted. It was a deli-  
cate point, and it was necessary that all parties should be  
indulged.”’

mises, a just and equal legislation.  
And, to secure the right of States whose  
interests were represented by a minority  
in 5oth Houses, the Veto power was  
needed, of a President, owing his elee­  
tion, not to the People, but to the  
States.  
Nor was the compromise simply be­  
tween the large States and the small.  
Other interests, equally as selfish, had a  
hand in it. &quot;It was,&quot; Mr. Hamilton  
  
said, in the Convention of New York,  
&quot;the interest of the Northern States,  
that there should be no restraints on their  
navigation, and that they should have  
full power, by a majority in Congress, to  
make commercial regulations in favour  
of their own navigation, and in restraint  
of that of foreigners. The Southern  
States wished to rnpose a restraint on  
the Northern, by requiring that two­  
thirds in Congress should be requisite to  
pass an act in regulation of commerce.  
They were apprehensive that the re­  
straint of a navigation law would dis­  
courage foreigners, and by obliging them  
to employ the shipping of the North  
  
ern States, would probably enhance  
  
their freight. This being the case, they  
insisted strenuously on having that pro  
vision engrafted in the Constitution; and  
the Northern States were as anxious in  
opposing it. On the other hand, the  
  
small States, seeing themselves embraced  
by the Confederation upon equal terms,  
wished to retain the advantages which  
they already possessed. The large States,  
on the contrary, thought it improper  
that Rhode Island and Delaware should  
enjoy an equal suffrage with themselves.  
From these sources arose a delicate and  
  
difficult contest. It became necessary,

vention of New York. Let us see what he said  
in the latter body. &quot;It has been observed,&quot;  
said Hamilton, &quot;that to coerce the States is  
one of the maddest projocts that was everde  
A failure of compliance will never be  
confined to a single State; this being the case,  
can we suppose it wise to hazard a civil war?  
Suppose Massachusetts or any large State  
should refuse, and Congress should attempt to  
compel them; would they not have influence to  
procure assistance, especially from those States  
which are in the same situation as themselves?  
What picture does this idea present to our view?  
A complying State at war with a non-complying  
State, Congress marching the troops of one State  
into the bosom of another, this State collect­  
ing auxiliaries and forming, perhaps, a ma­  
jority against its Federal head. Here is a na­  
tion at war with itself. Can any reasonable  
man be well disposed toward the Government  
which makes war and carnage the only means  
of supporting itself, a Government that can  
exist only by the sword?&quot; And again: &quot;Can  
we believe that one State will ever suffer itself  
to be used as an instrument of coercion? The  
thing is a dream, it is impossible. Then we  
are brought to this dilemma, either a Federal  
standing army is to enforce requisitions or the  
Federal Treasury is left without supplies. What,  
sir, is the cure for this great evil?  
Nothing but to enable the national laws  
to operate on individuals.&quot; Replying

posed Constitution would root out the last ves

lation, as well as property, in blacks. The regulation complained of was  
one result of the spirit of accommodation which governed the Convention,  
and without this indulgence no union could have been formed. But, con-  
sidering the peculiar advantages we derive from them, it is entirely just  
that they should be gratified. The Southern States have certain staples,  
tobacco, rice, indigo, which must be capital objects in treaties of com-  
merce with foreign nations, and the advantages which they necessarily  
procure will be felt throughout all the States. But the justice of this  
plan will appear in another view. The best writers on government have  
held that representation should be compounded of persons and property.  
This rule has been adopted, as far as it could be, in the Constitution of  
New York. It will, however, be by no means admitted that the slaves are  
altogether property. They are men, though degraded to the condition of  
slavery. They are persons, known to the municipal laws of the States they  
inhabit, as well as to the laws of nature. But representation and taxation  
ought to go together, and one uniform rule to apply to both. Would it  
be just to compute the slaves in the assessment of taxes, and discard them  
from the estimate in the apportionment of representation? Another cir-  
cumstance ought to be considered. The rule is a general rule, and applies  
to all the States. You have a great number of people in your State who  
are not represented at all and have no voice in your government. These  
will be included in the enumeration ; not three-fifths, but the whole. This  
proves that the advantages of the plan are not confined to the Southern  
States, but extend to other parts of the union.” As to the future number  
of representatives, he “admitted that there were no direct words of pro-  
hibition against a reduction, but the true and genuine construction of the  
clause does not give Congress power to reduce representation below the  
number as it stood.” Upon the proper number to send a representative,  
he argued, “that the proper number was a matter of opinion, between wha
