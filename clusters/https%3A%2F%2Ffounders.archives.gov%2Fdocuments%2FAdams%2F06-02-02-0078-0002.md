Avowing our Allegiance to the King: our affection and regard for Brittons in all parts of the World, affected with the deepest anxiety and the most alarming apprehensions at those grievances and distresses with which Brittish Americans are oppressed, And having taken under our most Serious Deliberation the state of the whole Brittish Continent so far as our abilities and opportunities permitted, we find that the present unhappy situation of our affairs is occasioned by a ruinous System of Colony Administration adopted by the Brittish Ministry about the year 1763 evidently calculated for enslaving these Colonies, and with

s contrary to this association the same ought forthwith to be sent back again without breaking any of the packages thereof.  
Eleventh That the Committee of Correspondence, the Committee of observation in this Town together with John Adams, Elisha Niles Esqrs., Mr. Joshua Hayward, Mr. Eliphalet Sawen, Deacon Benjamin Bass, Deacon Ebenezer Adams, Mr. Seth Spear, Mr. Samll. Holbrook, Mr. John Vinton, Mr. Azariah Faxon, Mr. Ebenr. Thayer 3d, Mr. Seth Turner and Mr. Joshua Hayward Jr. be one Committee whose business it shall be attentively to observe all persons touching this Association, and when it shall appear to the Satisfaction of a Majority of said Committee that any person within the limits of their appointment has violated this association that such Majority do forthwith cause the truth of the Case to be published in the Gazette, to the end all such foes to the rights of British America may be publickly Known and universally Contemned as the enemies of American liberty and thence forth We respectively will break off all dealings with him or her.  
Twelfth That all Manufactures of this Country be sold at reasonable prices, so that no undue advantage be taken of a future scarcity of goods.  
Thirteenth. And We do further agree and resolve that We will not have any trade, dealings, Commerce, or intercourse with any District, Town, Colony, or Province in North America which shall not acceed to, or which shall hereafter violate said association of the Continental Congress, but will hold them as unworthy of the rights of Freemen, and as inimical to the Liberties of their Country.  
And whereas it is of the utmost importance that the Salutory association of the Continental Congress be effectually executed; and the plans of the foes to America defeated, who aided by Tyrannical power intend to import goods, wares and Merchandize prohibited by said association, by assistance of such Merchants and Traders as to this intent shall basely prostitute themselves; and it will be extreamly difficult to distinguish between goods imported before the first day of December last and such as after said day shall be imported and Secretly dispersed throughout the Colony.  
And whereas it is expresly recommended by the Continental Congress to the Provincial Conventions and to the Committees in the respective Colonies, to establish such farther regulations as they may think proper for carrying into execution their association, We do farther resolve, That from and after the tenth day of october next it will be indispensibly necessary that all goods, Wares or Merchandize directly or indirectly imported from Great Brittain, or Ireland, Molasses, Syrups, paneles, Coffee or Piemento from the British Plantations, or from Dominica; Wines from Madeira or the Western Islands and foreign Indigo, should cease to be sold or purchased in this Colony, notwithstanding they shall have been imported before the first day of December aforesaid; unless the acts, and parts of acts of Parliament particularly enumerated in the Close of this association be then repealed. And it is strongly recommended to the Inhabitants of this Town that from and after the said Tenth Day of October, they cease to Sell or purchase, and prevent being exposed to Sale within this Town any goods, Wares or Merchandize and above enumerated, which shall at any time have been imported into America, whether before or since the first day of December aforesaid, unless said acts of Parliament shall be then repealed.  
And it is strongly recommended to the Committee named in the 11th. article of this association, that they exert themselves in causing the same to be strictly executed, And that after the said Tenth of October (unless the acts and parts of acts of Parliament as aforesaid are repealed) that they apply to all the Merchants and Traders in this Town and take a full inventory of all the goods, Wares or Merchandize in their possession whether they shall have been imported before or since the first day of December, aforesaid, requiring them to offer no more for Sale until said acts be repealed.  
And if any Merchant, Trader, or others shall refuse to have an inventory taken or shall offer for Sale after the said tenth of October, any such goods, Wares, or Merchandize, it is expressly recommended to the abovenamed Committee that they take the goods into their possession, to be stored at the risque of the proper owner untill the repeal of the Acts aforesaid, and publish the Names of such refractory Merchants, Traders, or Purchasers, that they may meet with the merits of enemies to their Country. And be it advised to the inhabitants of this Town that they by no means fail vigorously to assist and Support their Committees in discharging this as well as all other duties of their offices.  
Provided, Always, That in Case the last resolve in this as
