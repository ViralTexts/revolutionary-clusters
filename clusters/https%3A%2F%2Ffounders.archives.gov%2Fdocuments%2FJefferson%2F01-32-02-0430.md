it is confidently believed that to-morrow  
there is to be a coalition. I know of no  
foundation for this belief. If they (referring  
to the Administration party) could have  
been permitted to pass a law for putting  
the Government into the hands of an officer,  
they would certainly have prevented an

Four days of balloting have produced not a  
single change of a vote. Yet it is confidently be­  
lieve by most that to morrow there is to be a co­  
alition. I know of no foundation for this belief.  
If they could have been permitted to  
pass a law for putting the Gorerament into the  
hands of an officer, they would certainly have  
prevented an election. But we thought it best to  
declare openly and firmly, one and all, that the  
day such an act passed the Midale States tcould  
arm, and that ho such usurpation, even for a sin­  
gle day, should be submitted to. This first shook  
them, and they were completely alarmed at the  
resource for which we declared, to wit, a conven-  
tion to reorganize the Government and to amend  
it. The very word convention gives them the hor­  
rors, as in the present democratical spirit of  
America they lear they should lose some of the  
favorite morsels of the Constitution. Many at  
tempts have been made to obtain terms and  
promises from me. I have declared to them  
unequivocally that I would not receive the Gov-  
ernment on capitulation; that I would not go  
into it with my hands tied--Jefferson&#x27;s Works,
