Washington May 25th. 1813  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
At an early day after the close of the last Session of Congress, an offer was formally communicated from His Imperial Majesty, The Emperor of Russia, of his mediation, as the common friend of the United States and Great Britain, for the purpose of facilitating a peace between them. The high character of the Emperor Alexander, being a satisfactory pledge for the sincerity and impartiality of his offer, it was immediately accepted; and as a further proof of the disposition on the part of the United States, to meet their adversary in honorable experiments for terminating the War, it was determined to avoid intermediate delays, incident to the distance of the parties, by a definitive provision for the contemplated negociation. Three of our eminent Citizens were accordingly commissioned, with the requisite powers to conclude a Treaty of peace, with persons cloathed with like powers on the part of Great Britain. They are authorized also, to enter into such conventional regulations of the commerce between the two Countries, as may be mutually advantageous. The two Envoys who were in the United States at the time of their appointment, have proceded to join their Colleague, already at St. Petersburg.  
The Envoys have received another commission, authorizing them to conclude with Russia, a Treaty of commerce, with a view to strengthen the amicable relations, and improve the beneficial intercourse, between the two Countries.  
The issue of this friendly interposition of the Russian Emperor, and this pacific manifestation on the part of the United States, time only can decide. That the sentiments of Great Britain towards that Sovereign, will have produced an acceptance of his offered mediation, must be presumed. That no adequate motives exist, to prefer a continuance of war with the United States, to the terms on which they are willing to close it, is certain. The British Cabinet, also, must be sensible, that, with respect to the important question of impressment, on which the war so essentially turns, a search for, or seizure of British persons, or property, on board Neutral vessels on the high Seas, is not a belligerent right derived from the law of nations; and it is obvious that no visit, or search, or use of force, for any purpose, on board the Vessels of one independent power, on the high Seas, can, in war or peace, be sanctioned by the laws or authority of another power. It is equally obvious, that, for the purpose of preserving to each state, its seafaring members, by excluding them from the Vessels of the other, the mode heretofore proposed by the United States, and now enacted by them, as an Article of municipal policy, cannot for a moment be compared with the mode practised by Great Britain, without a conviction of its title to preference; inasmuch as the latter, leaves the discrimination between the mariners of the two nations, to officers exposed, by unavoidable bias, as well as by a defect of evidence, to a wrong decision; under circumstances precluding for the most part, the enforcement of controuling penalties; and where a wrong decision, besides the irreparable violation of the sacred rights of persons, might frustrate the plans and profits of entire voyages: Whereas the mode assumed by the United States, guards with studied fairness and efficacy, against errors in such cases; and avoids the effect of casual errors, on the safety of navigation, and the success of mercantile expeditions.  
If the reasonableness of expectations, drawn from these considerations, could guaranty their fulfilment, a just peace would not be distant. But it becomes the wisdom of the national Legislature, to keep in mind the true policy, or rather the indespensable obligation, of adapting its measures to the supposition, that the only course to that happy event, is in the vigorous employment of the resources of war. And painful as the reflection is, this duty is particularly enforced, by the spirit and manner, in which the war continues to be waged by the Enemy; who, uninfluenced by the unvaried examples of humanity set them, are adding to the savage fury of it, on one Frontier, a system of plunder and conflagration, on the other, equally forbidden by respect for national character, and by the established rules of civilized warfare.  
As an encouragement to persevering and invigorated exertions, to bring the contest to a happy result, I have the satisfaction of being able to appeal to the auspicious progress of our arms, both by land, and on the water.  
In continuation of the brilliant atchievements of our infant navy, a signal triumph has been gained by Captain Lawrence and his companions in the Hornet sloop of war; which destroyed a British sloop of war, with a celerity so unexampled, and with a slaughter of the Enemy, so disproportionate to the loss in the Hornet, as to claim for the conquerers the highest praise, and the full recompence provided by Congress, in preceding cases. Our public ships of war in general, as well as the private armed vessels, have continued also their activity and success against the commerce of the Enemy; and by their vigilence and address, have greatly frustrated the efforts of the Hostile Squadrons distributed along our Coasts, to intercept them, in returning into port, and resuming their cruises.  
The augmentation of our naval force, as authorized at the last Session of Congress, is in progress. On the Lakes our superiority is near at hand, where it is not already established.  
The events of the Campaign, so far as they are known to us, furnish matter of congratualation, and shew that, under a wise organization and efficient direction, the Army is destined to a glory not less brilliant, than that which already encircles the navy. The attack and capture of York is, in that quarter, a presage of future and greater victories; while, on the western Frontier, the issue of the late seige of Fort Meigs, leaves us nothing to regret, but a single act of inconsiderate valor.  
The provisions last made, for filling the ranks and enlarging the Staff of the Army, have had the best effects. It will be for the consideration of Congress, whether other provisions depending on their authority, may not still further improve the military establishment, and the means of defence.  
The sudden death of the distinguished Citizen, who represented the United States in France, without any special arrangements by him for such a contingency, has left us without the expected sequel to his last communications: Nor has the French Government taken any measures for bringing the depending negociations to a conclusion, through its representative in the United States. This failure adds to delays, before so unreasonably spun out. A successor to our deceased minister has been appointed, and is ready to proceed on his mission. The course which he will pursue in fulfilling it, is that prescribed by a steady regard to the true interests of the United States, which equally avoids an abandonment of their just demands, and a connexion of their fortunes with the systems of other powers.  
The receipts into the Treasury from the 1st. of october to the 31st day of March last, including the sums received on account of Treasury Notes, and of the loans authorized by the Acts of the last and the preceding Sessions of Congress, have amounted to fifteen Millions, four hundred and twelve thousand dollars. The expenditures during the same period amounted to Fifteen million, nine hundred and twenty thousand dollars, and left in the Treasury on the 1st of April, the sum of one million, Eight hundred and fifty seven thousand dollars. The loan of sixteen millions of dollars authorized by the act of the 8th. of February last, has been contracted for. Of that sum, more than a million of dollars had been paid into the Treasury, prior to the 1st of April, and formed a part of the receipts as above stated. The remainder of that loan amounting to near fifteen millions of dollars, with the sum of five millions of dollars authorized to be issued in Treasury notes, and the estimated receipts from the Customs, and the sales of public Lands amounting to nine millions three hundred thousand dollars, and making in the whole, twenty nine millions three hundred thousand dollars to be received during the last nine months of the present year, will be necessary to meet the expenditures already authorized, and the engagements contracted in relation to the public debt. These engagements amount during that period to ten millions five hundred thousand dollars, which with near one million for the Civil, miscellaneous and diplomatic expences, both foreign and domestic, and Seventeen millions eight hundred thousand dollars for the military and naval expenditures, including the ships of war building, and to be built, will leave a sum in the Treasury at the end of the present year, equal to that on the first of April last. A part of this sum may be considered as a resource for defraying any extraordinary expences already authorized by law beyond the sums above estimated; and a farther resource for any emergency, may be found in the sum of one million of dollars, the loan of which to the United States, has been authorized by the state of Pennsylvania; but which has not yet been brought into effect.  
This view of our finances, whilst it shews that due provision has been made for the expences of the Current year, shews at the same time, by the limited amount of the actual revenue, and the dependence on loans, the necessity of providing more adequately for the future supplies of the Treasury. This can be best done, by a well dijested system of internal revenue, in aid of existing sources; which will have the affect, both of abridging the amount of necessary loans, and on that account, as well as by placing the public credit on a more satisfactory basis, of improving the terms on which loans may be obtained. The loan of Sixteen millions, was not contracted for at a less interest than about seven and a half percent; and although other causes may have had an agency, it cannot be doubted, that with the advantage of a more extended, and less precarious revenue, a lower rate of interest might have sufficed. A longer post-ponement, of this advantage, could not fail to have a still greater influence on future loans.  
In recommending to the National Legislature, this resort to additional Taxes, I feel great satisfaction in the assurance; that our Constituents, who have already displayed so much zeal and firmness in the cause of their Country, will cheerfully give every other proof of their patriotism which it calls for. Happily, no people, with local and transitory exceptions, never to be wholly avoided, are more able than the people of the United States to spare for the public wants, a portion of their private means; whether regard be had to the ordinary profits of industry, or the ordinary price of subsistance, in our Country, compared with those, in any other. And in no case could stronger reasons be felt, for yielding the requisite contributions. By rendering the public resources certain, and commensurate to the public exigences, the constituted authorities will be able to prosecute the war, the more rapidly, to its proper issue; every hostile hope founded on a calculated failure of our resources, will be cut off; and by adding to the evidence of bravery and skill, in combats on the ocean and the land, an alacrity in supplying the treasure necessary to give them their fullest effect; and thus demonstrating to the world, the public energy, which our political institutions combine with the personal liberty distinguishing them, by the best security will be provided against future enterprizes on the rights or the peace of the nation.  
The contest in which the United States are engaged, appeals for its support, to every motive that can animate an uncorrupted and enlightened people; to the love of Country; to the pride of liberty; to an emulation of the glorious Founders of their Independence, by a successful vindication of its violated attributes; to the gratitude and sympathy which demand security from the most degrading wrongs, of a class of Citizens, who have proved themselves so worthy the protection of their Country, by their heroic Zeal in its defence; and finally, to the sacred obligation of transmitting, intire, to future generations, that precious patrimony of national rights and independence, which is held in trust by the present, from the goodness of Divine Providence.  
Being aware of the inconveniences to which a protracted Session at this Season, would be liable, I limit the present communication to objects of primary importance. In special messages which may ensue, regard will be had to the same consideration.

At an early day alter the last session  
•f congress, an offer was formally com¬  
municated from the Emperor of Rus¬  
sia of his mediation, as the common  
friend of the United States and Great  
Britain, for the purpose of facilitating  
a peace between them. The high  
character of the Emperor Alexander  
being a satisfactory pledge for the sin¬  
cerity and impartiality of his offer, it  
was immediately accepted ; and, as a  
further proof of the disposition on the  
part of the United States to meet their  
adversary in honourable experiments  
for terminating the war, it was deter¬  
mined to avoid intermediate delay, in¬  
cident to the distance of the parties,  
by a definitive provision for the con¬  
templated negociation. Three of our  
eminent citizens were accordingly com¬  
missioned, with the requisite powers,  
to conclude a treaty of peace, with  
persons clothed with like powers on  
the part of Great Britain. They were  
authorised also to enter into such con¬  
ventional regulations of the commerce  
between the two countries as may be  
mutually advantageous. The two en¬  
voys, wHo were in the United States  
at the time of their appointment, have  
proceeded to join their colleagues al¬  
ready at St Petersburgh.  
  
The envoys have received another  
commission, authorising them to con¬  
clude with Russia a treaty of com¬  
merce, with a view to strengthen the  
amicable relations, and improve the&#x27;  
  
beneficial intercourse between the twe  
countries.  
  
The isSue of this friendly intercourse  
of the Russian emperor, and this paci¬  
fic manifestation on the part of the  
United States, time only can dedde.  
That the sentiments of Great Britain  
towards that sovereign will have pro¬  
duced an acceptance ef his olferedime-  
diation, must be presumed. That no  
adequate motives exist to prefer a con¬  
tinuance of war with the United States  
to the terms on which they are willing  
to close it, is certain.  
  
The British cabinet also must be  
sensible, that with respect to the im-  
portant question of impressment, on  
which the war so essentially turns, a  
search for or seizure of British persons  
or property on beard neutral vessels  
on the high seas, is not a belligerent  
right derived from the law of nations;  
and it is obvious, that no visit or search,  
or use of force, for any purpose, on  
board the vessel of one independent  
power on the high seas, can, in war or  
peace, be sanctioned by the laws or  
authority of another power. It is  
equally obvious, that for the purpose  
of preserving to each state its sea-faring  
members, by excluding them from the  
vessels of the other, the mode hereto¬  
fore proposed by the United States,  
and now enacted by them, as an article  
of municipal policy, cannot for a mo¬  
ment be compared with the mode prac¬  
tised by Great Britain without a con¬  
viction of its title to preference, inas¬  
much as the btter leaves the discrimi¬  
nation between the mariners of the two  
nations to officers exposed to unavoid¬  
able bias, as well as, by a defect of  
evidence, to a wrong decision under  
circumstances precluding, fur the most  
part, the enforceaient of controlling  
penalties, and where a wrong decision,  
besides the irreparable violation of the  
sacred rights of persons, might frus¬

▼oytgea; whereas the mode assumed  
by the United States guards with stu*  
died fairness and efficacy against errors  
in such cases, and avoids the effect of  
casual errors on the safety of naviga¬  
tion and the success of mercantile ex¬  
peditions.  
  
If the reasonableness of expectations,  
drawn from these considerations, could  
guarantee their fulfilment, a just peace  
would not be distant. But it becomes  
the wisdom of the national legislature  
to keep in mind the true policy, or ra¬  
ther the indispensable obligation of  
adapting its measures to the supposi¬  
tion that the only course to that happy  
event is in the vigorous employment  
of the resources ot war. And, pain¬  
ful as the reflection is, this duty is  
particularly enforced by the spirit and  
manner in which the war continues to  
be waged by the enemy, who, uninflu¬  
enced by the unvaried examples of hu¬  
manity set them, are adding to the sa¬  
vage fury of it on one frontier, a system  
of plunder and conflagration on the  
other, equally forbidden by respect for  
national character, and by the esta¬  
blished rules of civilized warfare.  
  
As an encouragement to persevering  
and invigorated exertions to bring the  
contest to a happy result, I have the  
satisfaction of being able to appeal to  
the auspicious progress of our arms  
both by land and on the water.  
  
In continuation of the brilliant a-  
chievements of our infant navy, a sig¬  
nal triumph has been gained by Cap¬  
tain Lawrence and his companions in  
the Hornet sloop of war, which de¬  
stroyed a British sloop of war, with a  
celerity so unexampled, and with a  
slaughter of the enemy so dispropor¬  
tionate to the loss in the Hornet, as  
to claim for the conquerors the high¬  
est praise, and the full recompense pro¬  
vided by congress in preceding cases.  
Our public ships of war, in general, as  
well as the private armed vessels, have  
continued also their activity and sue-  
  
VOL. Vu PART lU  
  
cess against* the commerce of the ene¬  
my, and by their vigilance and address  
have greatly frustrated the efforts of  
the hostile squadrons distributed along  
our coasts, to intercept them in re¬  
turning into port and resuming their  
cruises. The augmentation of our  
naval force, as authorised at the last  
session of congress, is in progress.  
On the lakes our superiority is near at  
hand, were it not already established.  
  
The events of the campaign, so far  
as they are known to us, furnish mat¬  
ter of congratulation, and shew that,  
under a wise organization and efficient  
direction, the army is destined to a  
glory not less brilliant than that which  
already encircles the navy. The at¬  
tack and capture of York is, in that  
q^arter, a presage of future and great¬  
er victories—while, on the western  
frontier, the issue of the late siege of  
Fort Meigs leaves nothing to regret  
but a single act of inconsiderate va¬  
lour.  
  
The sudden death of the distinguish¬  
ed citizen who represented the United  
States in France, without any special  
arrangements by him for such a con¬  
tingency, has left us without the ex¬  
pected sequel to his last communica¬  
tions; nor has the French government  
taken any measures for bringing the de¬  
pending negociations to a conclusion  
through its representative in the Uni¬  
ted States. This failure adds to de¬  
lays before so unusually spun out. A  
successor to our departed minister has  
been appointed, and is ready to pro¬  
ceed on his mission. The course which  
he will pursue in fulhlling it, is that  
prescribed by a steady regard to the  
true interests of the United States,  
which equally avoids an abandonment  
of their just demands^ and a connection  
of their features with the systems of  
other powers.

count of treasury notes, and of the  
loans authorised by the acts of the last  
and the preceding session of congress,  
hare amounted to 15,412,000 dollars.  
The expenditures during the same pe¬  
riod amounted to 15,920,000, and left  
in the treasury on the 1st of April  
1,857,000 dollars. The loan of 16  
millions of dollars, authorised by the  
act of the 8th of February last, has  
been contracted for. Of that sum  
more than a million of dollars had  
been paid into the treasury, prior to  
the 1st of April, and formed a part of  
the receipts as above stated. The re¬  
mainder of that loan, amounting to  
near 15 millions of dollars, with the  
sum of five millions of dollars, autho¬  
rised to be issued in treasury notes,  
and the estimated receipts from the  
customs and the sales of public lands,  
amounting to 9,000,000 dollars, and  
making in the whole 29,300,000 dol¬  
lars, to be received during the last nine  
months of the present year, will be ne¬  
cessary to meet the expenditures al¬  
ready authorised, and the engagements  
contracted in relation to the public  
^bt. These engagements amount,  
during that period, to 10,500,000 dol¬  
lars, which, with near one million for  
the civil, miscellaneous, and diploma¬  
tic expences, both foreign and domes¬  
tic, and 17,800,000 for the military  
and naval expenditures, including the  
ships of war building, and to be built,  
will leave a sum in the treasury at the  
end of the present year equal to that  
of the Ist of April last. A part of  
this sum may be considered as a re¬  
source for defraying any extraordinary  
expences already authorised by law,  
beyond the sums above-mentioned ;  
and a further resource for any emer¬  
gency may be found in the sum of one  
million of dollars, the loan of which  
to the United States has been autho¬  
rised by the state of Pennsylvania, but  
which has not yet been brought into  
effect.  
  
This view of our finances, whilst it  
shows that due provision has been  
made for the expences of the current  
year, shows at the same time, by the  
limited amount of the actual revenue,  
and the dependence on loans, the ne¬  
cessity of providing more adequately  
for the future supplies of the treasury.  
This can best be done by a well-di¬  
gested system of internal revenue, in  
aid of existing sources; which will  
have the effect both of abridging the  
amount of necessary loans, and on  
that account, as well as by placing the  
public credit on a more satisfactory  
basis, of improving the terms on wliich  
loans may be obtained.  
  
The loan of sixteen millions was not  
contracted for a less interest than about  
seven and a half per cent. ; and al¬  
though other causes may have had an  
agency, it cannot be doubted that,  
with the advantage of a more extend¬  
ed and less precarious revenue, a low¬  
er rate of interest might have sufficed.  
A longer postponement of the advan¬  
tage could not fail to have a still grea¬  
ter influence on future loans.  
  
In recommending to the national  
legislature this resort to additional  
taxes, I feel great satisfaction in the  
assurance, that our constituents, who  
have already displayed so much zeal  
and firmness in the cause of their coun¬  
try, will cheerfully give other proofs

to the ordinary profits of industry, or  
the ordinary price of subsistence in  
our country, compared with those in  
any other. And in no case could  
stronger reasons be felt for the yield¬

more rapidly to its proper issue; every  
hostile hope, founded on a calculated  
failure of our resources, will be cut  
ofiF; and by adding to the evidence of  
bravery and skill, in combats on the  
ocean and on the land, an alacrity in  
supplying the treasury necessary to  
give them their fullest effect; and  
thus demonstrating to the world the

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
; of the House of Representatives,  
  
At an early day after the close of the last session of Congress, an offer was  
formally communicated from his imperial majesty, the emperor of Russia, of his  
mediation, as the common friend of the U. States and Gieat Britain, for the  
purpose’ of facilitating a peace between them. ‘The high character of the Em-  
peror Alexander being a satisfactory pledge for the sincerity and impartiality.  
of his offer, it&#x27;was immediately accepted ; and’as a further proof of the disposi-  
tion on the part of the U. States to meet their adversary in honotrable experi-  
ments fo- terminating the war, it was determined to avoid intermediate delay,  
incident to the distance of: the parties, by a definitive provision for the contem-  
plated negociation. Three of our eminent citizens were accordingly commis-  
sioned with the requisite powers to conclude a treaty of peace with persons  
clothed with like powers on the part of Great Britain. They are authorised  
also to enter into such conventional regulations of the commerce between the two  
countries, as may be mutually advantageous. The two envoys who were in the  
United States at the time of their appointment, haveyreceetet to joip their col  
  
——  
  
  
  
  
  
140 PRE MONTHLY RECORDER.  
  
- The envoys have received another commission authorising them to conclude  
with Russia a treaty of commerce, with a view to strengthen the amicable re-  
fations, and improve the beneficial intercourse between the two countries.  
  
The issue of this friendly interposition of the Russian emperor, and this pa-  
cific maniféstation on the part of the U. States, time only can decide. That the  
sentiments.of Great Britain towards that sovereign will have produced an ac-  
éeptance of his offered mediation, must be presumed. That no adequate motives  
éxist to prefer a continuance of war with the U. States, to the terms on which  
they are willing to close it is certain. The British cabinet also must be sensible  
that with respect to the imiportant question of impressment, gp which the war so  
essentially turns, a search for, or seizure of British persons or property on board  
neutral vessels on the high seas, is not a belligerent right derived from the law  
of nations; and it is obvious, that no visit or search, or use of force for any pur-  
pose, on board the vessels of one independent power on the high seas, can in  
war or peace be sanctioned by the laws or authority of another power. It is  
equally obvious that for the purpose of preserving to each state its seafaring  
members, by excluding them frem the vessels of the other, the mode heretofore  
proposed by the United States, and now enacted by them as an article of mupi-  
cipal policy, cannot for a moment be compared with the mode practised by  
Great Britain, without a conviction of its title to preference; inasmuch as the  
latter Jeaves the discrimination between the mariners of the two nations, to  
officers exposed by unavoidable bias, as well as by a defect of evidence, to a  
wrong decision under circumstances precluding, for the most part, the enforce  
ment of controlling penalties, and where a wrong decision, besides the irrepara-  
ble violation of the sacred rights of persons, might frustrate the plans and profits  
of entire voyages; whereas, the mode assamed by the U. States guards, with  
studied fairness and efficacy, against errours im such cases, and avoids the effect  
of casual errours on the safety of navigation, and the success of mercantile ex-  
peditions.  
  
If the reasonableness of expectations, drawn from these considerations, could  
puarantee their fulfilment, a just peace would not be distant. But it becomes  
the wisdom of the national legislature, to keep in mind the true policy, or rather  
the indispensable obligation of adapting its measures to the supposition, that  
the only course to that happy event isim the vigorous employment of the re-  
sources of war. And painful as the reflection is, this duty is particularly enforced  
by the spiritand manner in which the war continues to be waged by the enemy,  
who, uninflueneed by the unvaried examples of humanity set them, are adding  
to the savage fury of it on one frontier, a system of plunder and conflagration  
on the other; equally forbidden by respect for national character, and by the  
established rules of civilized warfare.  
  
- As an encouragement to persevering and invigorated exertions to bring the  
contest to a happy result, I have the satisfaction of being able to appeal to the  
auspicious progress of our arms, both by land and on the water.  
  
- In continuation of the brilliant achievments of our infant navy, a signal tri-  
umph has been gained by Captain Lawrence and his companions, in the Hornet  
sloop of war, which destroyed a British sloop of war, with a celerity so unex.  
ampled, and with a slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the loss in the  
_ Hornet, as to claim for the conquerors the highest praise, and the full recom-  
pense provided by congress in preceding eases. Our public ships of war in gene-  
ral, as well as the private armed vessels, have continued also their activity and  
suecess against the commerce of the enemy, and by their vigilance and addres

The augmentation of our naval foree, as authorised at the last session of con-  
  
gress, isin progress. On the lakes our superiority is near at hand, where it is  
not already established.  
&#x27; ‘The events of the campaign, so far as they are known to us, furnish matter of  
congratulation, and show, that under a wise organization and efficient direction,  
the army is destined to a glory not less briiliant than that which already encir-  
clés the navy. The attack and capture of York is, in that quarter, a presage of  
future and greater victories ; while on the western frontier, the issue of the late  
siege of Fort Meigs leaves nothing to regret but a single act of inconsiderate  
valour.  
  
The provisions last made for filling the ranks and enlarging the staff of the  
army, have had the best effects. It will be for the consideration of Congress,  
whether other provisions depending on their authority, may not still further  
improve the military establishment and the means of defence.

States in France, without any special arrangements by him for such a contin-

has the French government taken any measures for bringing the depending ne  
gociations to a conclusion, through its representative in the United States. This  
failure adds to delays, before so unreasonably spun oyt. A successor to our de-  
ceased minister has been appointed, and is ready to proceed on his mission; the  
course which he will pursue in fulfilling it, is that prescribed by a steady regard  
to the true interests of the United States, which equally avoids an abandonment  
of their just demands, and a connexion of their fortunes with the systems of  
other powers.  
  
The receipts into the Treasury from the Ist. of October to the 3lst day of  
March last, including the sums received on account of Treasury Notes, and of  
the loans authorized by the acts of the last and the preceding sessions of Congress,  
lave amounted to fifteen millons four hundred and twelve thousand dollars.  
The expenditures during the same period amounted to fifteen millions nine hun-  
dred and twenty thousand dollars, and left in the Treasury on the first of April,  
the sum of one million eight hundred and fifty-seven thousand dollars. The  
toan of sixteen millions of dollars, authorized by the act of the 8th of February  
last, has been contracted for. Of that sum, more than a million of dollars  
had been paid into the Treasury prior to the first of April, and formed a part  
of the receipts as above stated. The remainder of that loan, amounting to near  
fifteen millions of dollars, with the sum of five millions of dollars, authorized to  
be issued in Treasury Notes, and the estimated receijits from the customs and  
the sales of public lands, amounting to nine millions three hundred thousand  
dollars, and making, in the whole, twenty-nine millions three hundred thousand  
dollars to he received duriag the last nine months of the present year, will be  
necessary to meet the expenditures already authorized, and the engagements  
contracted in relation to the public debt. These engagements amount, during  
that period, to ten millions five hundred thousand dollars, which, with near  
one million for the civil, miseellaneous, and diplomatic expenses, both foreign  
and domestic, and seventeen millions eight hundred thousand for the military  
and naval expenditures, including the ships of war building and to be built, will  
leave a&#x27;sum in the treasury at the end of the present year, equal to that on the  
first of April last. A part-of this sim may be considered as a resource for d

fraying any extraordinary expenses already,authorized by law, beyond the sume  
above estimated ; and afurther resource for any emergency may be found in the  
sum of one miliion of dollars, the loan of which to the United States has been  
authorized by the state of Pennsylvania; but which has not yet been brought  
into effect. ,  
  
This view of our finances, whilst it shows that due provision has been made  
for the expenses of the current year, shows at the same time, by the limited  
amount of the actual revenue, and the dependence on loans, the necessity of pro-  
viding more adequately for the future supplies of the Treasury. This can best  
be done by a well digested system of internal revenue, in aid of existing sources ;  
which will have the effect, both of abridging the amount of necessary loans,  
and on that account, as well as by placing the public credit on a more satisfac-  
tory basis, of improving the terms on which loans may be obtained. The loan  
of sixteen millions was not contracted for at a less interest than about seven and  
a half per cent ; and although other causes may have had an agency, it can-  
not be doubted, that with the advantage of a more extended and less precarious.  
reyenue, a lower rate of interest might have sufficed. A longer postponement  
of this advantage could not fail to have a still greater influence on future loans.  
  
In recommending to the National Legislature this resort to additional taxes,  
{ fee! great satisfaction in the assurance, that our c onstituents, who have already  
displayed so much zeal and firmness in the cause of their country, will cheerfully  
give every other proof of their patriotism which it calls for. Happily no peo-  
ple, with local and transitory exceptions never to be wholly avoided, are more  
able than the people of the United States to spare for the public wants a portion  
of their private means, whether regard be had to the ordinary profits of indus-  
try, or the ordinary price of subsistence in our country, compared with those in  
any other. And in no case couid stronger reasons be felt for yielding the re-  
quisite contributions. By rendering the public resources certain, and commen-  
surate to the public exigencies, the constituted authorities will be able to prose-  
cute the war more rapidly to its proper issue ; every hostile hope, founded on a  
calculated failure of our resources, will be cut off ; and by adding to the evi-

prove the military establishment and the  
means of tit fence.  
The sudden death of (he distin­  
guished citizen who represented the  
United States in France, without a­  
nv special arrangements by him for  
such a contingency, has left us with­  
out the expected sequel to his last  
communications ; nor has the Frencli  
government taken any measures for  
bringing the depending negeciations  
to a conclusion, through its repre­  
sentative in the United States. This  
failure adds to delay s, before so un­  
reasonably spun out. A successor  
to our deceased Minister has been  
appointed, and is ready to proceed on  
his mission : the course which he  
will pursue in fulfilling it is that pre­  
scribed by a steady regard to (lie  
true interests of the United States,  
which equally avoids an abandon­  
ment of their just demands, and a  
connexion of their fortunes w ith the  
systems of other powers.  
The receipts into the Treasury  
from the 1st of Oct. to the 31st day  
of March last, including the sums  
received on account of flic Treasury  
Note^, and of the loans authorised  
by the acts of the last and the pre­  
ceding sessions of Congress, have a­  
ifiounted to fifteen millions four hun­  
dred and twelve thousand dollars.  
The expenditures during the same  
period amounted to fifteen millions.  
  
nine hundred am) twenty thousand  
dollars, and left in the Treasury on •  
the first of April, the sum of oncfmil­  
lion eight hundred and fifty-seven  
thousand dollars. The loan of six­  
teen millions of dollars authorised by  
the act of the Sth of February&#x27; last,  
has been contracted for. Of that  
sum, more than a million of dollars  
had been paid into the Treasury, pri­  
or to the 1st of April, and formed a  
part of the receipts as above stated.  
The remainder of (hat loan, amount­  
ing to near fifteen millions of dol­  
lars, with the sum of five millions  
of dollars authorised to be issued in  
Treasury Notes, &amp; the estimated re­  
ceipts from the customs &amp; the sales of  
public lands amounting to nine mil­  
lions three huudred thousand dollars,  
making in (he whole twenty-nine  
millions three hundred thousand  
dollars to be received during the  
last nine months of the present  
year, will he necessary to meet  
(he expenditures already authoris­  
ed, and the engagements contract­  
ed in relation to the public debt.  
These engagements amount during  
that period to ten millions five-hun­  
dred thousand dollars, which with  
near one million for the civil, mis­  
cellaneous and diplomatic expences,  
both foreign and domestic, and se­  
venteen millions eight hundred thous­  
and for the military and naval ex­  
penditures ineluding the ships of  
war building and to be built, will  
leave a sum in the treasury at the  
end of the present year, equal to  
that on the first of April last. A  
part of this stun may be considered  
as a resource for defraying any ex­  
traordinary expences already au­  
  
thoriied by law, beyond the sums  
above estimated ; ahd a further re­  
source for any emergency may be  
found in the *um of one million of  
dollars, the loan of which to the  
United States lias been authorised  
hy the state of Pennsylvania; but  
which lias nbl yet been brought in­  
to effect.  
This view of our finances, whilst  
it shew s that due provision has been  
made for the e*pences of the cur­  
rent year, shews at the same time,  
hy the limited amount of the actual  
revenue, and the dependence on loans,  
the necessity of providing more ade­  
quately for the future supplies of the  
treasury. This can best be done by  
a well digested system of internal  
revenue, in aid of existing sources;  
which will have the effect, both of  
abridging the aiiount of necessary  
loans, and oil that account, as well  
as hy placing the public credit on a  
more satisfactory basis, of improv­  
ing! lie terms on which loans may  
be obtained. The loan of six­  
teen millions was not contracted  
for at a less interest than about  
seven and a half per cent. : and al­  
though other* causes may have had  
an agency, it cannot he doubted,  
that with the advantage of a more  
extended and less precarious reve­  
nue, a lower rate of interest might  
have sufficed. A longer postpone­  
ment of this advantage could not  
fail to have a still greater influence  
on future loans.  
In recommending to the National  
Legislature this resort to additional  
taxes, I feel great satisfaction in the  
assurance,&#x27; that our const ilucnts, who  
have already displayed so much  
zeal and firmness in the cause of

Fellow citizens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives  
AT an early day alter the close ol the U»i  
session ot Congress, an offer was formally  
communicated from his Imperial Majesty  
the Hinperor of Russia, ot hismediation, as  
the common friend of the U. S. and G- Bri­  
tain, fur the purpose of facilitating a. peace  
between them. The high character of the  
limperor Alexander being a satisfactory  
pledge for the sincerity and impar­  
tiality of his offer, it was immediately ac­  
cepted ; and as a further proof Qf the dis­  
position on the part of the U. S. to meet  
their adversary in honorable experiments  
for terminating the war, it war, de&#x27;ermin­  
ed to avoid intermediate delav, incident  
to the distance of the parties, by a definitive  
provision for the contemplated negociation.  
Three of our eminent citizens were accor  
dingiy commissioned with the requisite  
powers to conclude a treaty of peace, with  
persons cloathed with like powers on the  
part of G. Britain. They are authorised al­  
so to enter into such conventional regula­  
tions of the commerce between the^two  
countries, as may be mutually advantage  
ous, The two envoys who were in the U.  
S. at the time of their appointment, have  
proceeded to join their colleague already  
at Petersburg. •  
The envoys have received another com­  
mission authorising them to conclude with  
Russia a treaty of commerce, with a view  
to strengthen the amicable relations, and  
improve the beneficial intercourse between  
the two countries.  
  
1 lie; issue of this friendly interposition of  
the Kussian Emperor, and this pacific  
manifestation on the part of the U. States,  
time only can decide. That the sentiments  
of U. Britain towards that Sovereign will  
have produced an acceptance of his offered  
mediation, must be presumed. That no  
adequate motives exist to prefer a continu­  
ance of war with the U. States, to the  
terms oh Which they are willing to close ii,  
is certain. The British cnbii t also must  
be sensible that with respect to the impor­  
tant question of impressment, on which  
the war so essentially turns, 9 search for,  
or seizure of British persons or properly on  
board neutral vessels on the high seas, is  
not a belligerent right derived from the  
law of nations; and it is obvious, that no  
visit or search, or use of force, for any  
purpose, on board the vessels of one inde­  
pendent power on the high seas, can in war  
or peace he sanctioned by the laws or au­  
thority (&#x27; another power. It is equally ob­  
vious tliat for the purpose of preserving to  
each state its seafaring members, by ex­  
cluding them from the vessels of the other,,  
die nn.rte heretofore proposed by th&lt;* Uni  
I ted States, and now enacted by them as an  
article of municipal policy, cannot for a  
moment be compared witn the mode prac­  
tised by (i, Britain, without a conviction n(  
its title to preference ; inasmuch as thelat  
ter leaves the discrimination between the  
mariners of the two nations, to officers ex­  
posed b) unavoidable bias, as well as by a  
defect ot evidence, to a wrong decision un­  
der circumstance j precluding, torthe most  
part, the enforcement, of controlling penal  
t.e», and where a wrong decision, besides  
tbe irreparable violation of the sacred  
rights of persons, might frustrate the plans  
in I protits of enti-&#x27;e voyages ;,wlicr&#x27;*ns the  
mwIc cry aid U States gbards with  
  
[studied fairness And efficacy against error?]  
^in such coses, and avoid* the effect of casu­  
t nl errors on the *.ite’.y of nav^mimi, hiui  
I tit*- success u{ mercantile expedition*.  
| it the reasonableness ot expect at ions,  
! drawn f.&#x27;om these considerations, could rua  
( rantee their fulhlutcnt, a jus? peace woulrt  
. not be distant. ttut &gt;t becomes the wis­  
| &#x27;loiii of the National Legislature to keep  
jin mind the true policy, or ratlier the i»i­  
. disp-nsable obligation i&gt;f adapting its mea­  
sures to the supposition, tilut the only  
course to that happy event is in the vigo­  
rous employment of the resources of war.—  
And painful as the reflection is, this duty is  
particularly enforced by the spirit and  
manner, in wlutb the war com nines to be  
waged by the enemy, who umnP.uenCed by  
I the unv tried examples of humanity set  
them, are adding to the savage fu.iy ot it  
jon our frontier, a system at plunder autl  
c nflagi ation on the other, equally forbidden  
by respect for oatw.iml character, and by  
the established roles of civiiind warfare.  
As an encouragement • i persevering and  
invigorated exeitioi.s tubing the contest  
to a happy result, 1 have the satisfaction &lt;»!  
being able to appeal to the auspicious pio  
gress of our arms, both by land, and on tnc  
water.  
In continuation of tlic brilliant achiev­  
ments of our infant navy, a signal triumph  
has bteu gained by Captain Lawrence and  
his companions in the Hornet sloop of war,  
which destroyed a British sloop of war,  
with a celerity so unexampled and with a  
slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate  
to trie loss in the Hornet, as To* Claim for  
the c Mpirrors the hignest praise and the  
lull recompense provided by Congress in  
preceding cases. Our public ships of war  
ingener d, as well as the private armed  
vessels, have continued also their activity  
and success against the commerce of the  
ienemy, and by their vigilance and address  
!have greatly frustrated the efforts of the  
hostile squadrons distributed along our;  
coasts to intercept them in returning intd  
port, and resuming their ciuizes.  
The augmentation of our naval farce, as  
authorised at the 1 ist session »f Congress, is  
in progress. On the Lakes our superior! &#x27;  
ty is near at hand where it is not aircadv  
established.  
The events of the campaign, so far as  
they are known to us, furnish matter of  
congratulation, and shew that under a wise  
organization and efficient direction, the ar­  
my is destined to a glory not less brilliant  
than that which already encircles the navy.  
The attack and capture of York is, in that  
quarter, a presage of future and gi eater  
victories ; while on the western frontier tne  
issue of the late siege of Tort Meigs leaves  
nothing to regret but a single act of incon  
siderate valor.  
  
J he provisions last made for filling the I  
ranks and enlarging the staff of the army,  
have had the best effect* It will be for the  
consideration of Congress, whether other  
provision* depending on their authority,  
m*y not still further improve the tniiitary  
establish-nent and the means of defence.  
The sodden death of the distinguished !  
Citizen who represented the United Status |  
in France, without any special arrangements !  
by him for such a contingency, has left us  
without the expected sequel to his l is;  
communications ; nor has the French go  
vemment taken any measures for bringing i  
the depending negociations to a conclusion, &#x27;  
through its representative in the U. States. I  
This failure adds to delays, before so un ]  
reasonably spun out. A successor to our  
deceased Minister has been appointed, and  
is ready to proceed on his mission ; the i  
course which he will pursue in fulfilling it is I  
that prescribed by a steady regard to the  
true interests of the U. S. which equally a­  
void* an abandonment of tlieii* just demands  
and a connection of their fortunes with the  
systems of other powers.  
The receipts into the Treasury from the  
1st of October to the 31st day of March last,  
including the sums recei\ed on account of  
Treasury Notes, and of the loans authorised  
by the acts of the last and the preceding ses­  
sions of Congress, have amounted to fifteen  
millions four hundred and twelve thousand  
dollars. I lie expenditures during the same  
period amounted to fifteen millions, nine  
hundred and twenty thousand dollars, and  
left in.the Treasury on the 1st of April, the  
sum oi one million eight hundred and fiftv­  
seven thousand dollars. The loan of sixteen  
millions of dollars authorised by the act of  
the 3th of February last, Has been contract  
ed for. Of that sum, more than a million of  
dollars had been paid into the Treasury, pri­  
or to the 1st of April, and formed a part of  
the receipts as above stated. The remain  
der of that loan, amounting to near fifteen  
millions of dollars, with the sum of five.mil  
lions of dollars authorised to be issued in  
Treasury Notes, and the estimated receipts  
from the customs and the sales of public  
lands amounting to nine millions three bun  
di ed thousand dollars, and maki .g In the  
whole twenty nine millions three hundred  
thousand dollars to be received during the  
l ist nine months of the present year, will he  
necessary to meet the expenditures already  
authorised and the engagements contracted  
  
I i insulin mine purjnc debt. These engage­  
ments amount during that period to ten  
millions live hundred thoiumd dollars,  
which With near one million for the civil*  
miscellaneous and diplomatic expences, b-uli  
foreign and domestic, and seventeen millions  
eight hundred thousand for the military and  
naval expenditures including the tlups ol  
war building and to b* baht, will ler.ve a  
sum in toe treasury at the end of the pre­  
sent year, equal to that on the first of April  
last. A part of this sum may be considered  
as A re* ,urce for defraying any efctraordina  
ry expjnces already a jt-icalsed by law, be  
yond the sums above estimated; and a fur­  
ther resource for h:iv emergency may lie  
found in the Hum of one million of dollar*,  
the loan of which to the Untied St iles has  
been authorised by Uie s&#x27;ate of Penn«&gt; Iva  
nia ; but which has not yet been brought  
into effect.

the tjerms on which tliey Sr«w illin;A(i close it

If the reasonableness of expectations, drawn  
from these consider rations osiilil guarantee  
their fulfilment, a just peaoe would no be dis­  
tant. But it bsr.oiuea tin: wisdnu of the Na­

licy, or rather the indispsasable obligation of  
adapting its measures to the supposition, that  
the only course to that happy event is in the  
vigorous employment ol die resources of war  
--And paiuful as the reflection is, this du­  
ty is particularly enforced by the spirit  
and manner, in whioh thcw.rr contiuues to he  
Waged by the enemy, who, fthinfluenced by tho  
unvaried ojrtTThples of butnaiiity set them, are  
adding to the savago fury of it on one frontier,  
a system oi plunder smd cdfUlagra lion on the  
other, equally forbidden by respect fur nation- I  
al character, and by the cstablisliad rules of ci  
viliscd warfare.  
  
As an rncourngrmrnt to persevering and In- |  
vigorated exertion# to bring the contest to *  
happy result, I htore t lie satisfaction of being a­  
hie to appeal u» ti&lt;« auspicious prof resa of our  
urins, both by land, and on the water.  
In continuation of the brilliant achievement*  
of our infant »ury, a signal triumph has been  
gained by capt. I.awrence and his companions  
hi the Hornet s*oop of war, which destroyed a  
British aloop of&#x27;war, with u calerityso unex­  
ampled and with a slaughter of the cue my so  
disproportionate to the Has in the Hornet, as  
to claim for the conquerors tho highest praise,  
sad the full reoo mpe use provided by Cong res*  
in preceding cases. Our puMic ships ol war  
in general, as well as the private nrinod vuaacls.  
Iisve continued also their activity and surras  
agaiual the commerce of the enemy, and by  
their vigilance and address have greatly frits­  
trutod the elforta of the hostile squadrons iJu

The augmitntsYion of *ur nsvsl forre, ss au­  
thorized at the last session ol * (ingress, is in

at. hand where it is wot already estiihlixtied.  
The • vent a of the campaign, so f*r as they  
sre known to us. furnish nialUjir ofcougratulw  
lion, slid shew that under a wise organization  
and «flicietit direction, the army is destined t»  
a glory not I»»h brilliant than that which alrea­

o‘ York is, in that quarter, a presage of liiturc

consideration of Congress, wlicihcr other  
provi-ions deponing on their Authority, may  
not still further improve the military estab­  
lishment and the means of defence.  
The sudden death of the distinguished cit­  
izen who represented the United States in  
France, without any special arrangements

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Fellow-citizens of the Senate,  
  
and of the House of Representatives,  
  
At an early day after the close of the late session  
or congress, an offer was formally communicated  
from his imperial majesty the emperor of Russia, of  
his mediation, as the common friend of the United  
States and Great Britain, for the purpose of facili-  
tating a peace between them. The high character  
of the Emperor Alexander being a satisfactory  
pledge for the sincerity and impartiality of his olier,  
was immediately acccpted; and as a further proot  
of the disposition on the part of the United States to  
meet their adversary in honorable experiments for  
terminating the war, it was determined to avoid  
the intermediate delay incident to the distance of  
the parties, by a definite provision for the contem-  
plated negociation. Three of our eminent citizens  
were accordingly commissioned with the requisite  
  
powers to conclude a treaty of peace with persons)  
  
cloathed with like powers on the part of Great Bri-  
tain. They are authorised also to enter into such  
conventional regulations of the commerce between  
  
* the two countries, as may be mutually advantage-  
  
ous. The two envoys who were in the United  
States at the time of the appointment have pro-  
ceeded to join their colleague already at St. Peters-  
burg.  
  
The envoys have received another commission  
authorising them to conclude with Russia, a treaty  
of commerce, with a view to strengthen the amica-  
ble relations and improve the beneficial intercourse  
between the two countries.  
  
The issue of this friendly interposition of the  
Russian emperor, and this pacific manifestation  
on the part of the United States, time only can de-  
cide. That the sentiments of Great Britain towards  
that sovereign will produce an acceptance of his of-  
fered mediation must be presumed. That no ade-  
quate motives exist to prefer a continuance of war  
with the United States, to the terms on which they  
are willing to close is certain. The British cabinet  
also, must be sensible, that with respect io the im-  
portant question of impressment, on which the war  
so essentially turns, a search for, or seizure of,  
British persons or property on board neutral vessels!  
on the ].~ h seas, is not a belligerent right derived  
trom the law of nations; and it is obvious that no  
Visit or search, or use of force, for any purpose, on  
board vessels of one independent power, on the high  
Seas, can in war or peace be sanctioned by the laws|  
or authority of another power. It is equafly obvious  
that for the purpose of preserving to each state its  
sea-furing members, by excluding them from the  
vessels of the other,the mode heretofore proposed by  
the United States, and now enacted by them as an  
article of municipal policy, cannot for a moment be  
compared with the mode practised by Great Britain,  
without a conviction of its title to preference ; _ in-  
asmuch as the latter leaves the discrimination he-  
  
posed by an unavoidable bias, as weil as by a defect  
of evidence, to a wrong decision; under circum.  
stances precluding for the most part, the enforce-  
ment of controlling penalties; and where a wrong  
decision, besides the irreparable violation of the  
rights of persons might frustrate the plans and  
profits of entire voyages: whereas the mode as-  
sumed by the United Siates, guards with studied  
fairness and delicacy against errors in such cases,  
and avoids the eflect of casual errors on the safe-  
ty of navigation, and the success of mercantile ex-  
ped tions.  
  
If the reasonableness of expectution, drawn. from  
these considerations could guarantee their fulfil.  
ment, a just peace would not be distant. But it  
becomes the wisdom of the national legislature to  
keep in mind the true policy, or rather the indispen-  
sible obligation of adzpting its measures to the sup-  
position, that the only course to that happy event  
is in the vigorous employment of the resources of  
war. And painful as the reflection is, this duty is  
particularly enforced by the spirit and manner in  
which the war continues to be waged by the enemy,  
who, uninfluenced by the unvaried examples of hu-  
manity set them, are adding to the savage fury of it  
on one frontier, 2 system of plunder and conflagration  
on the other equally forbidden by respect for nation-  
al character, and by the established rules of civilized  
warfare.  
  
As an encouragement to persevering and invigo-  
  
rated exertions to bring the contest to a happy re-  
sult, I have the satisfaction of being ale to appeal  
to the auspicious progress of our arms, both by land  
and on the water.  
In continuation of the brilliant achievements of  
our infant navy, a signal triumph has been gained by  
‘captain Lawrence and his companions in the Hornet  
sloop of war with a celerity so unexampled, and a  
slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the  
loss in the Hornet, as to claim for the conquerors  
ithe highest praise, and the full recompense provid-  
ed by congress in preceding cases. Our public  
ships of war in general, as well as the private armed  
vessels, have continued also in their activity and suc-  
cess against the commerce of the enemy, and by  
their vigilance and address have greatly ttustrated  
the efforts of the hostile squadrons distributed a-  
long our coast, to intercept them in returning into  
port, and resuming their cruizes.  
  
The augmentation of our force as authorised at the  
iast session of congress, is in progress. On the  
Lakes our seperiority is at hand where it is not al-  
ready established.  
  
The events of the campaign, so far as they are  
known to us, furnish matter of congratulation, and  
shew that under a wise organization and efficient di-  
rection the army is destined to a glory not less  
brilliant than that which already encircles the navy.  
The attack and capture of York is, in that quarter, a  
presage of future and greater victories; while, on  
the western frontier, the issue of the late siege of  
Fort Meigs, leaves us nothing to regret but a single  
act of inconsiderate valor.  
  
The provisions last made for filling the ranKs and

fects. It will be for the siicubdeoatian of congress,  
whether other provisions depending upon their 2U- |  
thor.ty may not still further improve the military  
establishment and the means of defence.  
  
The sudden death of the distinguished citizen  
who represented the United States in France, w ith-  
out any special arrangements by him fer such a con-,  
tingency, has left us without t the expected sequel to  
his last communications; nor has the French go-|  
vernment taken any measures for bri-ging the de-  
pendiag negociations to a conclusion, “through its  
fepresentative in the United States. This failure  
adds to delays, before so unreasonably spun out. A  
Successar to our deceased minister has been ap-  
pointed, and is ready to proceed on his mission; the  
course W hich he will pursue in fuifilling it, is that  
  
rescribe-d by a steady regard to the true interests of  
the United States, wh: ch equally avoids an aban-  
donment of their just demands, and a connexion of  
  
  
  
the terms on which latins may be obtained. The  
loa» of 16 millions was not contacted for at a less  
in.evest than seven and a half per cent. and although  
other causes may have had an agency, it cannot be  
doubted, that with the advantage of a more extend-  
ed and leseprecarious revenue, a lower rate of in-  
  
terest might have sufficed. A longer postponement  
of this advantage could not fail to have a still great-  
er influence on future loans.  
  
In recommending to the national legislature this  
resort to additional taxes, I feel great satisfaction  
in the assuranee, that our constituents, who have  
already displayed so. much zeal and firmness in the  
cause of their country, will cheerfully give every  
other proof of their patriotism which it calls fr. Hap-  
pily no people, with Jocal and transitory exceptions  
never to be wholly avoided, are more «bly than the  
people of the United States, to spare for the public  
wants a portion of their private means, whether re

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives.  
  
At an early day after the close of the  
last session of Congress, an offer was for-  
mally communicated from his Imperial  
Majesty, the Emperor of Russia, of his  
mediation, as the common friend of the  
es at oer ~~ Great Britain, nt  
  
purpose o ilitating a peace be-  
tween them. The high sicenion of  
the Emperor Alexander being a satisfac-  
ue pledge for the sincerity and impar-  
tiality of his offer, it was immediately  
accepted; and as a further proof of the  
disposition on the part of the U. States  
to meet their adversary in honorable ex-  
periments for terminating the war, it  
was determined to avoid intermediate  
delay, incident to the distance of the  
parties, by a definitive provision for the  
contemplated negociation. Three of  
our eminent citizens were accordingly  
commissioned with the requisite powers  
to conclude a treaty of peace, with per-  
sons clothed with like powers on the  
part of Great Britain. They are autho.  
rised also to enter into such conventional!  
regulations of the commerce between  
the two countries, as may be mutually  
advantageous. The two envoys who  
were in the United States at the time of  
their appointment, have proceeded to  
join their colleague already at St. Peters-  
  
bare.  
he envoys have received another  
commission authorizing them to con-  
clade with Russia a treaty of commerce,  
with a view to strengthen the amicable  
relations, and improve the beneficial in-  
tercourse between the two countries.  
The issue of this friendly.interposition  
of the Russian Emperor, and this pacific  
manifestation on the part of the U. S.  
  
  
  
  
  
time only can decide.  
ments of G. B. towards that Sovereign  
will have produced an acceptance of his  
offered mediation, must be presumed.—  
That no adequate motives exist to pre-  
fer a continuance ofthe war with the U.  
S.to the terms on which they are wil-  
ling to close itis certain. The British  
cabinet also must be sensible that with  
respect to the important question of im-  
pressment, on which the war so essen-  
tially turns, a search for, or seizure of  
British persons or property on board  
menivel pajosia on the high seas, is not a  
belligerent right derived from the law  
of nations ; and # is obvious, ihat no  
visit or search, or use of force, for any  
purpose on board the vessels of one in-  
dependent power on the high seas, can  
in war or peace be sanctioned by the  
laws or authority of another power,—  
It is equally obvious that for the purpose  
of preserving to each state iis seafariag  
members, by excluding them from the  
vessels of the other, the mode heretofore  
proposed by the United States, and now  
enacted by them as an article of munici-  
pal policy, cannot for a moment be com-  
ared with the mode practiced by G.  
ritain, without a conviction of its title  
to preference ; inasmuch as the latter  
leaves the discrimination between the  
mariners of the two nations, to officers  
exposed by unavoidable bias, as well as  
by a defect of evidence, to a wrong de-  
cision under circumstances precluding,  
for the most part, the enforcement of  
controlling penalties, &amp; where a wrong  
decision, besides the irreparable viola-  
tion of the sacred rights of persons,  
might frustrate the plans and profits of  
entire vovages ; whereas the mode assu-  
med by the United States guards with  
studied fairness and efficacy against er-  
rors iw soch cases, 2nd avoids the effect  
of casual errors on the safety of naviga-  
tion, and the success of mercantile expe-  
dition,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
If the reasonablences of expectutions,  
drawn from these considerations could  
guarantee their fulfilment, a just peace  
  
would not be distant’ But it becomes  
the wisdom of the Nationul Legislature  
to keep in mind the true policy, or rath-  
er the indispensable obligation of adapt-  
ing its measures, to the supposition,  
thut the only @ourse tothat happy event  
is in the vigorous employment of the re-  
sources of war. And _ painful as the re-  
flection is, this duty is particularly en-  
forced by the spirit &amp; manner, in which  
the war continues to be waged by the  
_ enemy, who, uninfluenced by the unva-  
  
ried examples of humanity set them, are  
“adding to the savage fury of it on one  
frontier, a system of plunder and confla-  
gration on the other, equally forbidden  
by respect for national character and by  
the established rules of civilized ware-  
fare.  
  
Asan encouragement to persevering  
and invigorated exertions to bring the  
contest to a happy resuit, I have the sa  
tisfaction of being able to appeal to the  
auspicious progress of our arms, both by  
land, and on the water.  
  
In continuation of the brilliant at-  
chievements of our infant navy, a signal  
triumph has been gained by Captain  
Lawrence and his companions in the  
Hornet sloop of war, which destroyed a  
British sloop of war, witha celerity so  
anthainplalt and with a slaughter to the  
enemy so disproportionate to the loss in  
the Hornet, as toclaim for the conque-  
rors the highest praise, and the full re-  
compense provided by Congress in pre-  
ceding cases. Our public ships of war  
in general, as wcil as the private armed  
vessels, have continued also their activi-  
ty and success against the commerce of  
the enemy, and by their vigilance and  
address have greatly frustrated the ef-  
forts of the hostile squadrons distributed  
along our coasts to intercept them in re-  
turning into port, and resuming their  
cruises,  
  
The augmentation of our naval force,  
as authorised at the last session of Con-  
gress, is in progress. On the Lakes  
our superiority is near at hand where it  
  
is not already established.  
  
The events of the campaign, so far as  
they are known to us, furnish matter of  
congratulation, and shew that under a  
wise organization, and efficient direc.  
tion, the army is destined to a flory not  
less brilliant that which already encir-  
cles the navy. The attack and capture  
of York is, im that quarter, a presage of  
future and r victories ; while on  
the western frontier the issue of the late  
siege of Fort Meigs leaves nothing to  
regret but 2 single act of inconsiderate  
valour.  
  
“£8144  
  
The provisions last made for filling  
the ranks and enlarging tire staff of the  
army, have had the best effects. It  
will be for the consideration of Con-  
gress, whether other provisions ov  
ing on their ae may not still fur-  
ther improve the military establishment  
and the means of defence.  
  
The sudden death of the distinguished  
citizen who represented the United  
States in France, without any special  
arrangements by him for such a contin-  
gency, has leftus without the expected  
sequel to his last communications ; nor  
has the French government taken any  
measures for pone ie the depending  
negociations to ‘a conclusion, threugh its  
representative in the United States. «  
  
This failure adds to delays, before so  
unreasonably spunout, A successor, to  
our daecauad Minister has been appoint-  
ed, and is ready to proceed on his mis  
sion; the course which he will pursue  
in fulfilling it is that prescribed by a  
steady regard to the true interests of the  
U. States, which equally avoids an  
abandcnment of their just demands, and  
a connexion of their fortunes with the  
systems of other powers.  
  
The receipts into the Treasury from  
the 1st of October to the 3ist of Mareh  
last, including the sums received on ac-  
count of Treasury Motes, and of the  
loans authorized by the acts of the last  
and the preceding scssions of Congress,  
have amounted to fifteen millions four  
hundred and twelve thousand dollars —  
The expenditures during the same _pe-  
riod amounted to fifteen millions nime  
hundred and twenty thousand dollars,  
and left in the Treasur; on the Ist of  
April, the sum of one million eight hun-  
dred and fifty-seven thousand dollars.  
The loan of sixteen millions of dollars  
authorized by the act of the 8th of Fe-  
bruary last, has been contracted for. Of  
that sum, more than a million of dollars  
had been passed into the Treasury, prior  
to the 1st of April, and formed a oy of  
the receipts as above stated. ‘The re-  
mainder of that loan, amounting to  
near fifteen millions of dollars, with the  
sum of five millions of dollars authorized  
to be issued in Treasury Notes, and the  
estimated receipts from the customs and  
the sales of public lands amounting to  
nine millions three hundred thousand  
dollars, and making in the whole twen-  
1 Bay millions three hundred thousand  
  
ols. to be received during the last nine  
months of the present year, will be ne-  
cessary to meet the expenditures already  
authorized, and the engagements cov-  
tracted in relation to the public debt.—

that period to ten millions five hundre

adding to the evidence of bravery and

“Fellow-Citizeugof the Sennte, and #3575  
A of thz House of Representatives,, : _ Loyt  
AT an early day after the close of the last f:ffion of Congrels, an offer  
was‘formally communicated from hislmperial Majzßy.theEmperor of Raflia,  
of his meditation, as the common friend of the U. States and G. Britain, for  
the purpose of facilitating a peace betwen them. The high chara&amp;er of the  
Empergr Alexaander being a fatisfa@ory pledge for the sincerity and impar­  
tialicy of his offery it was immediately accepted ; and as a further proof of  
the difpoiition on tie part of the U. States to meet their adversary in honor,  
~able experiments for terminating the. war, it-was determined to avoid inter­  
mediate degay,}ind‘:ien‘t to the distance of the parties, by 2 definitive provision  
for the contemplated negociation. Three of our eminent citizens were ac.  
cording&#x27;y commiffiuned with the requifice powers to conelude a treaty of  
peace, with persons. clothed with the like powers on‘the part of G. Britain,  
‘They are authorifed also to enter into such conveational regulations of the  
commerce between the two cotntriss, as may be mutnally advantageous,  
The two envoys who were in the U. States at the time of their appointinent,  
have proceeded to jsin their collezgue already at St. Petersburg. :  
The envovs have received another commiflion authorifing them to con­  
clude with Ruflia a treaty of commerce, with a view to fkrengthen the ami.  
cable gelations, and improve the beneficial iftercourfe betyeen the two coun­  
tries. , R 281 &#x27;  
~ The iffuz of this friendly interposition of the Ruffiln Emperor, and this&#x27;pa­  
cific manifellation on the part of the U S. time only cdn decide.—That the  
sentiments of G. Brivain towards that Sovereign will huve produced an accep­  
tance of his offcred mediation, must be presumed. That no adequate motives  
exist to prefer a contindauce of war with the U. States, to theterms on which  
they are willing to close it, is certain. The Britith cabinet also must be enfi­  
ble that with refpe@ to the important queltion of impreflment, on which the  
war f{o cfentially turns, a search for, or seizure of Britith persons or property  
on board neutral veflels on the high seas, is. not a belligerént right derived  
‘from the law of nations ; and it is obvious, that no visit or feirch, or use of  
force for any purpose, on board the veflels of one independent power on the  
high seas, can in wAr or peace be fané&amp;ioned by the laws or authority of anoth.  
er power- It is equally obvious that for the purpose of preserving to each  
state 115 feafaring members, by excluding them froa# the veffzls of the ether,  
the mode heretofore proposed by the United States, and gow enaded by them  
~as an article of municipal policy, cannot for 2 moment be compared with the  
mode practifed by G Britain, without a convi&amp;icn cf its title to preference ;  
inafmuch’as the latter leaves the difcrimindtion between the mariners of the  
- two mations, to officers exposed by unavoidable bias, as well as by a defc@ of  
evidence, to a wrong decision under circumstances precluding, for the most  
- part, the enforcement of controling penalties. and where a wrong decision, be­  
sides the irteparable violation of the sacred rights of persons, might frafirate  
the plans and profits of entire voyages ; whereas the mogde aflumed by the U.  
“States guards with Rudied fairnefs and efficacy againf errors in such cases,  
and avoids the effe@ of cafusl errors on the fafety of navigation, and the fuc­  
c:fs of mercantile expeditions. &#x27; &#x27;  
If the reafonablenc(s of expe&amp;ations, drawn from thef aonfiderations could  
guarantee their fulfilment, a just peace would not be distant. But it becomes  
the wisdom of the National Legislature, to keep in mind the true policy, or  
rather the indifpenf{able obligation of adapting its measures to the fupp~firion  
that the only course to that happy event is in the vigorous empioyment of the  
resources of war. = And painful as the refl:&amp;ion is, their duty is particulariy  
enforced by the spirit and msanner in which the war contipues to be waged by  
the enemy, who, uninflucnced by the unvaried examples of humanity set them,  
are adding to the savage fury of it on one frontier, a fyflem of plunder and  
conflagration on the other, equilly forbidden by a refpe&amp; for naiional char.  
“after, and by the eltablithed rules of civilized warfare.  
As an encouragement to parfevering and invigorated gxertions to biing the  
_contel 1o a happy result, I have the fatisfa&amp;ion of being able to appeal to the  
auspicious progress of our arms, both by iand and on the water. .  
In continuation of the brilliant achievements of our infant navy, a- signal  
triumph has been gained by Capiain Lawrence and his companions in the  
Hornet sloop of war, which defiroyed a British sloop of ‘war with a celerity  
so unexampled, and with a slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the  
loss in the Horaet, as to claim for the conqueror, the highest praise, and the  
full recompence provided by Congress in preceding cifes. Our pablic ships  
of war in general, as well as the private armed veficls, have continued also  
their a&amp;ivity and success againß the commerce of the enemy, and by their  
vigilance and address have greatly fruftrated the efforts -of the hostile squad­  
rons difiributed along our coaltsto intercept them jin returniog into port,  
and resuming their cruises. £ B b 7 a i  
The augmentation of our naval force, as authorifed at the lakt session of  
Congress, is in progress. Oa the Lakes our {uperiority is near at hand, where  
itis not already eftablithed. = R N RR I  
~_The events of the campaign, so far as they are known to us, {urnith matter  
. of congratulation, ‘and shew that under a wife organization and efhicient di .  
~ redion, the army is destined to a glory not less brilliant than -that which al  
- ready encircles the navy. The attack and capture of York, is, in that quar­  
ter,a presage of futtre and greater viories ; while on the weltern frontier,  
. the iflae of _the late siege of Fort Meigs leaves nothing, to regret but a single  
@&amp; of inconsiderate valor. ~« 2 P h  
The provisions last made for filling the ranksand enlarging the &amp; &amp; of  
. the army, have had the best effects. It will be for the &#x27;confideration of Con­  
- grels, whether other provisions depending on their authority, may not fill:  
further improve the military edablifhmient and the means of defence,  
The sudden death of the distinguished citizen who represented »‘he-Umtfd  
i States in France, without any special arrangements byhim for such a contin  
-+ gedey, has left us without the expe@ed fegael to his last communications ; nor  
- hras the French government taken any ‘meafures for bringing the depending  
- megociations to a conclusion, thmuglfyité representative in the United Stdtes.  
. This failure adds to delays, befote so nareafonably {pun aut. “ A successor to  
| our decealed Minister has been appointed, and is ready to proceed on his  
mission ; the course which he will pursue in fulfilling it, is that prescribed by  
- a fleady regard to the true interests of the Uhited States, which equally

for the expznles of the current year,&#x27;thews at the {lme time, by the limiccd  
amount of the a&amp;tual revenue, and the depen &#x27;ence ow lozns, the neceility of  
providing more adequately for the fature {applies of the tzealury. This can .  
belk be done by a well digefled fyßem of internal revenu-, in aid of exiting  
sources ; which will have the eff:&amp;, both of abridging ths amount of neceffa  
ry loans, aad on that account, as weli as by placing.the public ciediton a -  
more fatisfa&amp;ury basis, of improving the terms on which loans may be eb:  
tained. The loan of fixt=en millions was not cortr:@:4 for at a less intercfk  
than about seven and a half per cent ; and although other causes may have  
had an agency, it cannot be doubted, that with tha advantage of a more  
extended and less precarious revenue, a lower rate of interelt miylat have fuf­  
ficed.. A longer poitponement of this advantage could not fail to have a  
ill greater influence on future loans.

Fellow citisena of the Senitey and  
of the House of Keprescitatives, :  
AT an early day alicr the cluse of the last  
sedsion of Congress, an offer was formnally  
cotmmunicated from bis lmperial - Majesty,  
the Emperor of*Russia, of Ais mediauon, us  
the cotnmon friend of the United States and  
Gireat Britain, for the purposé of facilitaiing  
a peace between them. ‘L&#x27;he high character  
of the Bm}:cror Alexander being a sajisfacio­  
ry pledge for the sincerity and impurtiality ol  
his offer, it was immediately accepted ; und  
as a further proof of the disposiuen on the  
part of the United States to meet their ac­  
versary in honorabde experiments for termio­  
ating the war, jt wus determined o avoid in­  
termedinte delay, incldent 1o the distance ol  
the parties, by a definitive provision for the  
conicmplated negociution, ‘Yhree ol our em­  
inent citizens were accordingly -commission­  
ed with the requisitg- potvers 1o conclude a  
treaty of peace, with. persous cloathed witl  
like powers on the part of Great Britain.  
They are authovised also to emer into such  
conventional regulations of the eommerce be­  
tweca the two countries, as may be mutually  
advantageous. ‘The two Envoys who ‘were  
in the United States at the time of their ap­  
pointmenty have proceeded 1o joio théir cole  
leaguo slready at St, Patersburgh. The En.  
voys have received another commmission au­  
thorizing them to conclude with Russia a  
treaty of commerce, with a view to strength­  
en the amicable relations, and improve the  
beneficial intercourse between the two couy:  
tries. T&#x27;he igsue of this friendly interposition:  
of the Russian Emperor, and this pacific  
manifestation on the part of the Uniied Staces,  
time only ean decide.~=That ‘the sedtiments  
of Great Britain towurds that Sovereign wiil  
have produced an acceptance of his proffered  
‘mediation, must be presumed. “That no ade­  
quate motives exist to prefer a coutinuance  
of war with the United Staies, to the terms  
on which they are willing 1o close it, is. cer­  
tsin. The British cabinet.also must be seo­  
‘sible thut with respect to the important ques­  
tion of impressinent, on Wwhich the war so s  
sentiolly tuins, a s@urch for, or seizure of  
British persons or property &#x27;on board neutral  
vessels on the high seus, iv not a belligerent  
right detived from the law of nutions ; wod  
it ils ebvious, that no visit or seuarch, or use  
&#x27;of force for any purpose, on board‘ the vese,  
sels of one independent power oa the high  
seas, can in war €r peace be sanctioned by  
the laws or authority of another power. It is  
equally obvious that for the purpnse of pres  
serving to each state its-seafaring - members;  
by excluding them from the vessels of the .  
other, the mode heretofore .propesed by the  
United States, and now enacted by them as  
an article of municipal - policy, cannot for &amp;  
moment be compared with the&#x27;mode practis­  
ed by Great Britain, without a conviciion ot  
its title to preference ; inasmuch as the lat­  
ter leaves the discrimimation ‘between the -  
mariners of the two nations, to officers éxpo. -  
sed by unavoidable biasy; as well by a defect  
of evidence, to a wrong decision under cire  
cumstances precluding, for the most part,the  
enforcement of controiing penalties, and  
where a wrong; decision; besides the irrepar­  
able violation of the sacred rights of persons,  
might frustrate the plans and profits of entire’  
voyases ; whereas the mode assumed by the  
United States guards with studied fairness  
and efficacy against errors in such cases, and  
avoids the effect of casunl errors on the safe- 1  
t{ of navigation, and the success of mercans  
“tile expeditions. ~ If the reasonablencss of  
expectations, drawn from these considera- ‘  
tions could guarantee their fulfilment, » just  
peace could not be distant.—~But it becomes  
the wisdom of the Nutionul Legislature, 1o |  
‘keep it mipd the tree policy, or rather the |  
indispensable obligation of adapiing its wen:  
_sdres to the supposition, that the only course  
to that happy ecvent is in the vigorous em-.  
- ployment of the resources of war. And pain«  
~ ful as thie ggflection is, this duty is particolers  
; ly enforced by the spirit and mannersin whick&#x27;  
- the war contiaues to be waged by the enemy,  
- who, urinfluenced by the unvaried examples  
- of bumahit{ set them, are adding to the sav.  
- age fury of it on one frontier, asystem of-plun­  
~der and conflagration on the other, equally’  
forbidden by a respect for » national’ ¢harac.  
ter, and by the established rules of civilized  
| &quot;&quot;&amp;uo R :  
+As an encouragement to persevering and  
invigorated exeriions to bring the contest to  
« happy result, I bave the sstisfaction of be­  
ing able to appeal to the auspicious vrogress  
of our arms, both by land and on the water.  
In continuation ol’ the brilliuntachievements  
of our infant navy, a signal triumph has Yeen  
geined by Capt. Lawrence and his compan­  
tons in the Hornet sloop of war, which de­  
stroyed &amp; British sloop of war with a celerity  
so wnexampled, and with a slaugter of the en­  
emy so disproportionate to the loss in the  
‘Hornet, ds to claim for the conqueors the  
highes praiset, and the full recompence pro­  
vided by Coavo.h g Cases. Our  
Apubdlic sbips of war in 89 well as the  
  
private armed vessels, -have continued also  
their activity sad succcss agsinst the coin  
mérce of the enemy, and by their vigilance  
and address have greatly frustrated the efforts  
of the hastile squadrops distributed along ou  
coasts to intercept thedd A Feturning into  
port, snd reswming their cruises. .  
The augmentation of our uaval force, as  
authorized at the last session.of Congress, is  
in progress.—On the Lakes our superiorily  
is near ot band, where it is not alrcady estab­  
lished. o  
The events of the campaign, so far as they  
are known to us, furnish matter of congratu­  
lation, and’shew that Under a 4 wise organization  
&amp; efficient dircction,the army 1s destined o o  
glory not less brilliant than that which al­  
ready éncircles the navy The attuck and chp­  
ture of York, is, i that quarter, a presage of  
filth &amp; dnd gheater victyries ; while on the  
Western frontier, the issue of the late siege  
of Fort Meigs leaves norhing 10 regret but a  
single act of Ihconsiderate valar.  
The provisions last made for fillidg the  
ronks and enlarging the siaff of the army,  
have had the best efiects, It will be for the  
consideration of Congress, wnether other  
provisions depending on their authotity, may

the sum of 5 miltions of deo&#x27;iars suthorized 1o

liotis thice hundred thousand dollars, and  
making in the whole twenty-ning willions  
three bundred thousand dollars to be feteiv­  
ed during the last nine months of the present  
year, will be necessary to meet the cupendi­  
tures already authorized,and the engagements  
cofitructed in relution to the public debt.  
These engagements amount during that per­  
iod to ten milliony Gve hundred thoussnd dol­  
lars, which with near one miilion for the civ­  
il, miscellancous and diplomatic expenses,  
both foreign and domestic, and seventeen  
  
millions eight hundred thousand dollars for  
the militafy and naval expenditures, includ­  
ing the ships of war building and 10 be buiiy,  
will leave a sum in the treasury at the end of  
the present year, equal to that on the first of  
April lust. 44  
A part of this sum may be considered as a  
resource for defruying&#x27; any extraordinary ex­  
penscs alieady authorized by law, beyond the  
sums esbove estimated ; and a further résource  
for any emergency way be found _in sum of  
ane million of dollars, whe loan of which te,  
the United States has been authorized by the  
State of Pennsyivania ; but which bas not yet  
‘been brought into-effect.. °  
  
This view of our finunces, whilst it shews  
thot due provision has been made for the ex­  
penses of the current year, shews at the samc  
tlne, by the limited amount of the actval re­  
venye, and the dependence on doans, the nec­  
essity of providing more adequately for the  
futare supplies of the treasury —=This can  
best be done by a well dizested system of in­  
ternal revenue, in aid of existing sources ;  
which will have the e&amp;cct, buth of - abridging  
the amount of necessary loans, and on thut  
account, as weli as by placwng the public cred­  
it oo a more satisfactory basis, of improving  
the terms on which loans may be obtained  
The loan of sixteen millions was not contract­  
ed for ata less interest thug about seven and  
  
a hulf‘per cent : and although other causes  
tuy hate had v agency, it cannot be doubted,  
thug with the adv:m_agc!a more extended  
~and Tess precarious revctiue, a lower rete of  
interast might have sufficed. A longer pos:-  
ponghent of this advantage &lt;ould wor fuil  
to have a still greater influence on futore  
  
loans.  
o recommending to the Naﬁood‘ Legis-  
Jature this resort to sdditional raxes, 1 feel  
great satisfaction in the assurafice, that our  
constituents, who have alreudy displayed so  
much zeal and firmness in the canse of their  
‘countly, will cheerfully give every other  
prooi of their pairiotisn wkich it calls for.  
Happily no people, wich local andd trensiiory  
enceptiobs never 1o be wholly avoided, are  
fore dble than the pemlo of the United  
Swied, w 0 spars W pudbile whity, &amp; peiiee

had to tiis ordinary profits of industry or the  
ordinary price of subsistence in our mwx  
compased with those in apy other.—And  
no case . could stronger reasons be felt for  
yielding the requisite contributions. By ren­  
dering the public resources certain, and com­  
mensurate 10 the public exigeocies, the con­  
stituted authorities will be able to prosccute  
the war more repidily to its proper issue ;  
evéry hostile hope founded on a calculated  
failuie of our resources, will be cot-off ; and  
by «dding 10 the evidence of bravery and skill,  
in combats en the ocean and on . the land, an  
alacrity in supplying the treature necessary  
to give them their fullest effect, and thus de­  
@ onsirating to the world the public energy  
which our political institutions combine with  
the personai liberty distinguishing them, the  
best security will be provided sgainst future  
enterprizes on the rights, or the peace of the  
pation. i  
  
The contest in which the United States are  
ehgaged, appeals for its support to every mo­  
iive that cah ahitmotle an uncorrupted and en,  
lighted people ; to&#x27;the love of country ;. to  
thé pride of liberty ; to ah emulation of the  
glorious Founders of their independence, by  
a successful vindication of its violated aftri­  
butes ; to the gratitude and sympaiby which  
demand security from the rhost degrading:  
wrofigs of a class of citizens, who have prov­  
ed themselves so worthy the protection of  
their country, by their heroic zeal in its des

that preeious patrimony of nuional rightsand­  
independence, which&#x27; is Held in trust by tha  
presenty from the goodness of Diviné - Provis .

due prpvision has been made for the expences of  
the cutf ent year, shews at the same time,&#x27; by the  
limited amount of tbe actual revenue, and in­  
dependence on loans, the necessity of providing  
more adequately for the future supplies of the  
treasury. This can bst be done by a well diges­  
ted system ot&#x27; internal revenue, in aid of existing&quot;  
sources ; which, wilt &#x27;have the effect, both of a  
bridging&#x27; the Amount of necessary loans, and rm  
that account, ra well as by placing ths public cred­  
it on a more satisfactory basis of improving the  
terms on which loans may be obtained. , The  
loan of sixteen millions-was not Contracted for at  
a less interest than about seven, and a half per  
cent, and although other causes may have bad  
an agency? it cannot be doubtedflhat withlhead-r  
vantage of a more extended and less precarious  
revenue, a lower rate of interest mighr liavty suf  
Gced. A longer postponement, of this advantage  
couM not fail to have a still greater Influence on­  
future loans, i , :N  
In recommending to the national legislature this  
resort to adHiiional taxes, I feel great satisfaction  
  
in, the assurance JhaWour constituents, ho have  
alrcaay displayed so much zeal and firmness in  
  
ery other proof of their patriotism which U calis

I&#x27;eltow ciiizcna of ihe Senate,  
  
and of the ilouae of Hcfireeentatives.  
  
At an early day after the close of the  
last session of Congress, an offer was  
formally conimunicated from his Imperi-  
al Majesty, liie Linrieror of Kussia, of  
his mediation, as the common friend oi  
the U. States and G. Britain, for the pur-  
pose of facilitating a peace between  
them. Tlie high character of the Em-  
peror Alexander being a satisfactory  
pledge for the sincerity and impartiality  
of his offer, it was imiiiudiately accepted ;  
and as a further proof ot the disposition  
on the pan of the U. States to meet their  
adversary in honorable experiments for  
terminating the war, it was determined to  
avoid intermediate delay, incident to the  
clisiance of the parlies, by a definitive  
provision for the contemplated negocia-  
tion. Three of our eminent citizens  
were accordingly commissioned with the  
Tequisite powers to conclude a treaty of  
peace, with persons clothed with like  
powers on the pan of Great Britian.— .  
They are authorised also to enter into  
such conventional regulations of the com-  
merce between the two countries, as may  
be niutuaiiy advantageous. The two  
envoys who were in the United States  
at the time of their appointment, have  
proceeded to join their colleague already  
•at St. Petershurg.  
  
The envoys have received another  
eomniission authorising them to conclude  
with Russia a treaty of commerce, with  
a view to strengthen the amicable rela-  
tions, and improve the beneficial inter-  
course between the two countries.  
  
The issue of this friendly interposition  
of the Russian Emperor, and this pacific  
manifestation on the part of the United  
States, lime only can decide. That the  
sentim-ents of G. Britain towards that  
Sovereign will have produced an accep-  
tance of his offered medijition, must be  
presumed. &#x27;I&#x27;hat no adequate motives  
exist to preief a coniinuunce of war with  
the U. States, to tlie terms on which they  
are willing to close it is certain. The  
Jlritish cabinet also must be sensible that  
SVith respect to the important question of  
ampi tssment, on which the war so essen-  
tially turns, a search for or seizure ol  
Ui ilish persons or property on board neu-  
tral vessels on the high seas, is not a bcl-  
iigerent right dciivcd from the law of  
nations ; and it is obvious that no visit or  
search, or use o*&#x27; force, for any purpose  
on board the vessels of one independent  
power on the liigli seas, can in war or

The uugmentation of our nav.il force, as au-  
thorised at the last session of Cuntn&#x27;tss, is in  
progress. On the lakes our superiority is near  
at hand where |it is not already established.  
  
The events of the campaign, so i&#x27;aras they are

licr the issue of the late seige of Fort Meigs  
leaves nothing to regret but u single act ot in-  
considerate valor.  
  
The provisions last made for filling the  
ranks and enlarging the staff of the army, have  
had the best effects U will be for the consid-  
eration of congress, whether other piovisions  
depending t&gt;n their authority, may not still fur-  
ther improve the military establishment and  
the means of iletence.  
  
The sudden death of the distinguished citi-  
zen who irpresented the U. States in Franre,  
without any special at raiigemrnts by him for  
such a contingency, has left us without the ex-  
pected sequel to Ids last communications;  
nor has the French government taken any mea-  
sures for bringing the deiiei&#x27;ding negociations  
to a conclusion, through its representative in  
the United States. Thistailure adds to delays  
before so unreasonably spun out. A successor  
to our deceased Minister has been appointed,  
and is ready to proceed on his mission ; the  
course which he will puisne in fulfilling it, is  
that prescribed by a steady regard to the true  
interests of the United States, which equally  
avoids an abandonment of their just demands,  
and a connexion of their fortunes with the sys-  
tems of other powers.  
  
The receipts into the treasury from the 1st  
ofOctober to tlie 31st day of March last, in-  
cluding the sums received on account of trea-  
sury notes, and of the loans authorised by the  
acts of the last and the preceding sessions of  
Congresa, have amounted to fifteen millions  
  
tour hundred and twelve thousand dollars  
  
The expenditures during the same period a-  
mounted to fifteen millions, nine hundred and  
twenty thousand dollars, and left in the tre.isu-  
ry on the 1st of April, the sum of one million  
eight hundred and fifty-seven thousand dollars.  
The loan of sixteen millions of dollars author-  
ised by the act of the 8th of February last, has  
been contracted for. Of that sum, more than  
a million of dollars had been paid into the trea-  
sury, prior to the 1st of ,\pril, and formed a  
part of the receipts as above stated. The re-  
mainder of that loan, amounting to near fifteen  
millions of dollars, with the sum of five niil-  
lions of dollars authorised to be issued in trea-  
sury notes, and the estimated receipts from  
the customs and the sales of public lands a-  
mountiiig to nine, iiillllons three hundred flmu.  
sand dollars, atid making in the whole tweiitv-  
nine millions three hundred thousand dollars  
to be received during the last nitie months of  
the present year, will be necessary to meet the  
expenditures already atithorised, and the en-  
gagements contracted in relation to the public  
debt. These engagements amount during that  
period to ten millions five hundred thousand  
dollars, which with near one million for the ci-  
vil, miscellaneous and diplomatic expences,  
both foreign and domestic, and seventeen mil-  
lions eight hundred thou-aiiH for the military  
and naval expenditures including the ships of  
war building and to be built, will leave a sum

day, after the close of the last. Session of  
Congress, an offer was formally comnruni-  
cated from the Emperor of Russia of his  
mediation as the common friend of. the  
United States and Great Britain, for the  
purpose of facilitating a peace between  
them. The high character of the Emperor  
Alexander being a satisfactory pledge for  
the sincerity and impartiality of bis offer, it  
was immediately accepted; and_as a farther  
proof of the disposition on the part of the  
United States to mect their adversary in  
honourable expeniments for terminating the  
war, it was determined 10 avoid interme-  
diate delay, incident to the distance of the  
parties, by a definitive provision for the  
contemplated negociation. . Three of our  
emiuent citizens were accordingly eommis-  
sioned, with the requisite powers, to cont  
clude a Treaty of Peace, .with persons  
clothed with like powers on the part of  
Great Britain. They were authorized also  
to enter into such conventional regulations  
of the commerce between the two countries  
as may be mutually advantageous. The  
two Envoys who were in the United States  
at the time of their appeintment, have pra-  
  
ceeded to join their colleague already. at.Ss. |  
  
Petersburgh. The Eavoys have received  
  
  
  
another commission, authorizing them to’  
conclude with, Russia a» Treaty; of Cam-.  
  
merce, with a view to strengthen the ami-  
  
cable relations, and improve the beneficial  
  
intercourse between the two countries. —~  
The issue of this friendly intercourse of the  
Russian, Emperor, and this pacific mani-  
festation on the part of the United States,  
time only can decide. That the:sentiments  
of Great Britain towards that Soyereign  
will have produced an acceptance, of jis of-  
fered mediation, must be presumed. That  
no adequate motives exist to.prefer a conti-  
nuance of war with the United States to the  
terms on Which they are willing to close it,  
is certain.——The British, Cabinet also  
must. be sensible that with :respect. to the’  
important question . of Impressment, on  
which the war so essentially turps, a search  
for, er seizure of British persens .pr pro-

the last nine months of the present ‘year,

ous, and diplomaticexpenses, botl foreign

litary and naval expenditures, including the

April last. A. part of this sum anay be  
considered as. a resource for defraying ary

by Jaw, beyond the sums above mentioned ;  
and a further resource for any emergency  
may be found in the sum of one million of

tion has been made for the expenses of the

the limited amount of the actual revenue,  
and the: dependence on toans, the necessity  
of providing more adequately for the future  
supplies of the Treasury. ‘This can bestibe  
done by a well:digested system of internal  
revenue, in aid of existing sources ; which  
will have the effect !both of :abridging the  
amount of necessary loans, and on that at-  
count,&#x27;as well as. by placing: the’ public ere-  
dit on a more satisfactory basis, of improy-

the advantage of a more extended and less  
precarious revenue, a lower rate of interest  
might have sufficed. A longer postpone-  
ment of the advantage could not fail to have  
a still greater influence on future loans.

Kon of Impressment, on which the war so es­  
sentially turns, a search for, or seizure of  
British persons or property on board neutral  
vessels, on the high seas, is not a belligerent  
right derived from the law of nations: and it is  
obvious, that no visit or search, or use of  
force for any purpose, on hoard the vessel of  
one independent Power on the high seas, can,  
in war or peace, be sanctioned by the laws or  
authority of another Power. It is equally  
obvious, that for the purpose of preserving to  
each State its seafaring members, by excluding  
them from the vessels of the other, the mode  
heretofore proposed by the United States,  
and now enacted by them as an article of  
municipal policy, cannot for a moment,  
be compared with the mode practis­  
ed by Great Britain, without a convic­  
tion of its tide to preference inasmuch as the  
latter leaves the discrimination between the  
mariners ofthe two nations to officers exposed  
fo unavoidable bias, as well as by a defect of  
evidence, to a wrong decision under circum­  
stances precluding for the most part, the en­  
forcement of controlling penalties, and where  
a wrong decision, besides the irreparable viola,  
tion of the sacred rights of persons, might  
frustrate the plans and profits of entire  
voyages; whereas the mode assumed by the  
United Slates guards, with studied fairness and  
efficacy, against errors in such cases, and  
avoids the 7dect of casual errors, or the safety  
of navigation, and the success of mercantile  
expeditions.  
&quot;If the reasonableness of espectations,  
drawn fron these considerations, could guaran­  
tee iheir fulfilment, a just peace would, not be  
distant. But it becomes the wisdom of the  
National Legislature to keep in mind the true  
policy, or rather the indispensable obligation  
of adapting its measures to the supposition,  
that ihe only Course to that happy event is iv  
the vigorous employment of the resources of  
war: and painful as the reflection is, this duty  
is particularly enforced by the spirit and  
manner in which the war continues to be waged  
by the enemy, who uninfluenced by the unva­  
ried example of humanity set them, are adding  
to the savjige fury of it on our frontier, a  
system of plunder and conflagration on the  
other, equally forbidden by respect fur national  
charac &lt;-r, and the established rule of civilized  
warfare.  
&quot;Ah an encouragement to persevering and  
invigorating exertions to bring the contest  
to a happy result, I have the satifaction of  
being able to appeal to the auspicious pro­  
gress of our o«u arras both by land and oil  
the water.  
&quot;In continuation ofthe brilliant achieve­  
ments of our infant navy, a signal triumph has  
been gained by Captain I»awrence and his  
companions in the Hornet sloop of war, which  
destroyed a British sloop of war, with a cele­  
rity so unexampled, and with a slaughter ofthe  
enemy so disportiotmte to the loss in the  
Hornet, as to claim for the conquerors the  
iiigh&#x27;St praise, and the full recompence provided  
by Congress in preceding cases Our public  
ships of war in general, as well as the private  
armed vessels, have continued also their  
activity and success against the commerce of  
the enemy, and by their vigilance and address  
have greatly frustrated the efforts of the  
hostile squadrons along our coastsj to intercept  
them in returning into port, and resuming  
their cruises. The augmentation of our naval  
force, as authorised at the last Session of  
Congress, is in progress. On the lakes our  
superiority is near at hand where it is not  
already established.  
&#x27;•The events of the campaign, so far as they  
are known to us, furnish matter of congratu­  
lation, and shew, that under a wise organization  
and efficient direction, (he army is destined  
to a glory not less brilliant than that which  
already encircles the navy. The attack and  
capture of York is, in lhat quarter, a presage  
of future «ud greater victories,—.while, on the  
western fontiers, the issue of the late siege of  
Fort Meigs leaves nothing to regret but a  
single act of&#x27; inconsiderate valour.  
.** The sudden death of the distinguished  
Citizen who represented the United States in  
France, withoui any special arrangements by  
him far such a contingency, has left us  
without the expected sequel to his last com­  
munications, n.ir hjis the French Government  
tjikeu any measures for bringing the depending  
negotiation to a conclusion through its  
Representative in thé United States. This  
failure adds to delays before so unusually  
spun out. A successor to our departed  
Minister h:is been appointed, and is ready to  
proceed on his mission. The course which he  
will pursue in fulfilling it, is that prescribed  
by a steady regard to the true interests of the  
United States, which, equally ay an  
abandonment of their just demands, ard a  
connectnn of their features with the system  
of ofher powers.  
&quot;The receipts into Ihe. Treasury from the  
lstof Oct. to the 31st of March last, includ­  
ing the sums received on account of Treasury  
notes, and ofthe laons authorised by the Acts  
of the last and the preceding Session of  
Congress, hive amounted&#x27; to &#x27;15,412,000  
dollars. Tho expenditures during the same  
period amounted to 16,920,000, and left in  
the Treasury on the Ist April 1,857,000  
dollars. The lojiii of 16,000,000 of dollars,  
authorised by the-Act.of the Bth of February  
last, has been contracted for. Of that sum  
more than a, c;i!iiou. of dollars had been paid  
into the Treasury prior to Ist of April, and  
formed a part of the receipts as above stated.  
The remainder of that loan, amounting to  
near 15,000,000 of dollars, with the sum of  
of 5,000,000 of dollars authorised to be  
issued in Treasury noies, and (he estimated  
receipts from the customs, and fhe sales of  
public lands, amounting to 9,000,000 dollars,  
and making&#x27;in the whole 29,300,000 dollars,  
to be received during (he last nine months of  
the present year, will be necessary to meet  
the&#x27;expetidilures already authorized&quot;, and the  
engagements contracted in relation to (he  
public debt. These engagements amount,  
during that period, to 0,50.000 dol lars, which,  
with near one million for the civil, miscel.  
lancous, and diplomatic expences, both foreign  
and domestic, and 17,800,000 for ihe military  
and naval expenditures, including the ships of  
war building, and to be built, will leave a  
sum in the Treasury at the end of&#x27; the present  
year, equal to that of the Ist of April last.  
A part of this sum may be considered as a  
resource for defraying anj extraordinary  
expences already authorised by law, beyond  
the sum above mentioned; and a further  
resource&#x27;of any emergency may be found in  
the sum of 1,000,000 of dollars, the, loan of  
which to the United states has been authorised  
by the State of Pennsylvania, but which has  
not yet been brought into effect.  
&quot; This view of our finances, whilst it shews  
that due provision has been made for the ex.  
pences of the current year, shews at the same  
time, by the limited amount of the actual  
revenue, and fhe dependence on loans, the  
necessity of providing more adequately for  
the future supplies of the Treasury. This  
can best be done by a w.dl digested system of  
internal revenue, in aid of existing sources;  
which will have the effect both of abridging  
the amount of necessary loans, and on that  
account, as well as by placing the public  
credit on a more satisfactory basis, of improv­  
ing the terms on Which loans may be obtained.  
&quot; The loan of sixteen millions was not con.  
tracted for at a less interest than about seven  
and an half per cent, and although other  
causes may have had ati agency, it cannot be  
doubted, that with the advantage of a more  
extended and less precarious revenue, a lower  
rate of interest might have sufficed. A longer  
postponement of the advantage could not fail  
to have a still greater influence on future  
loans.  
&quot;In recommending to the National Legis.  
lature this resort to additional taxes, [ feel  
grejit satisfaction in the assurance, that our  
constituents, who have already displayed so  
much zeal and firmness in the cause of their  
country, will cheerfully give other pniofs of  
their patriotism which it calls for. Happily  
no people, with local &#x27;arid territorial excep.  
tions never to be wholly avoided, are more  
able than the people of the United States to  
spare for the public wants a portion of their  
private means, whether regard be h;id to tho  
ordinary profits of industry or the ordinary  
price of subsistence in our Country, eompar.  
Ed with those iv any other. And in no case  
could stronger reasons be felt for the yield.  
iug the requisite contributions.  
&quot; By rendering the public resources, cer.  
tain, and commensurate to the public exigen.  
cies, the Constituted Authorises will be able  
to prosecute the war more rapidly to its pro.  
per issue : every hostile hope founded on a  
calculated failure of our resources, will be  
cut oil&#x27;; and by adding to the evidence of  
bravery and skill, in combats on the ocean  
and on the land, an alacrity in supplying the  
Treasury, necessary to give them thi&#x27;ir fullest  
effect, and thus demonstrating to the world  
the public energy which our political institu.  
lions combine, with the personal liberty distin.  
guishing them, the best security will be pro.  
vided against future enterprises on the rights,  
or the peace of the nation.  
&quot; The contest in which the United States  
are engaged appeals for its support to every  
motive that can animate an uncorrupted and  
enlightened people,—to the love of country,  
—to the pride of liberty,—to the glorious  
founders of their independence,—by a success,  
ful vindication of its violated attributes • to  
the gratitude and sympathy which demands  
security from the most degrading wrongs, of  
a ciass of citizens, who have proved so wor.  
thy of the protection of their country by their  
heroic zeal in its defence ; and finally to the  
sacred obligations, of transmitting eutire to  
future generations that precious patrimony of  
national rights and independence, which is  
heldin trust by the present from the goad,  
ness of Divine providence.  
&quot; Being aware of the inconveniencies to  
which a. protracted Session would be liable,  
I limit the present communication to objects  
of primary importance. In special messages  
which may ensue, regard will be had to the  
same consideration,

The war of 1812, again, made it  
necessary for the Government to re­  
sort to some system ofinternal-revenue  
taxes, and President Madison  
in his message to the extra session  
of Congress in 1813, after stating the  
condition of the national finances,  
says:  
This view ef our finances, while it shows  
that due provision has been made for the  
expenses of the current year, shows at the  
same time, by the limited amount of the  
actual revenue and the dependence on loans,  
the necessity of providing more adequately  
be done by a well-digested system of internal  
revenue in aid of existing sources, which  
will have the effect both of abridging the  
amounts of necessary loans, and on that ac­  
count, as well as by placing the public credit  
on a more satisfactory basis, of improving  
the terms on which loans may be obtained.  
In accordance with this recom  
mendation of President Madison,  
Mr. Albert Gallatin presented a plan

With this curious message Mr. Jefferson  
sent in the name of a minister to Russia,  
who was confirmed. From that time to the  
present the friendly relations between the  
two countries have not been interrupted for  
a moment. Following are some evidences of  
the sentiment on Russia&#x27;s part:  
Shortly after the beginning of the war of  
1S12 between the United States and Great  
Britain the Czar tendered his services as  
mediator to bring about reace. His offer was  
accepted by the United States, but declined  
by Great Britain. President Madison, in a  
special message to Congress May 25, 1S13,  
said:  
The high character of the Emperor Alex­  
ander being a satisfactory pledge for the  
sincerity and Impartiality of his offer, it  
was Immediately accepted. The is­
