rthern boundary. we will now therefore proceed to examine the state of that boundary, as between Gr. Britain &amp; the US.  
Disputes having arisen between Gr. Britain &amp; France as to the limits between Canada &amp; Louisiana on the one side, &amp; the countries of the Hudson’s bay, &amp; North Western companies on the other, it was agreed by the treaty of Utrecht (1713) Art. X. that ‘Commissaries should be forthwith named by each party to determine the limits between the bay of Hudson and the places appertaining to the French, &amp; to describe &amp; settle the boundaries between the other British &amp; French colonies in those parts’ these Commissaries accordingly fixed the Northern boundaries of Canada &amp; Louisiana, by a line beginning on the Atlantic, at a Cape or Promontory in 58°-30’ N. Lat. thence South Westwardly to the lake Misgosink, or Mistasin, thence farther S.W. to the lat. of 49.° North from the Equator, and along that line indefinitely. [Hutchins’s topographical description of Louisiana. pa. 7.] thus the Northern boundary of Canada and Louisiana became fixed, &amp; the latter particularly became changed to the parallel of 49.° from the Equator, instead of the highlands inclosing the Northern waters running directly or indirectly into the Misipi, as settled by Louis XIV. Canada being, by the peace of 1763. transferred to England, it’s Southern boundary was settled by the treaty of 1783. with the US. along the St. Croix &amp; highlands bounding the Southern waters of the St: Laurence, the 45th. degree of latitude to the water communication between the lakes, and along that communication to the lake of the woods; whence the line of the US. was to run due West, till it should strike the Missisipi. now, according to the maps of that time, and particularly Mitchell’s on  
*the identical map used by the negociators, with their MS. marks on it, is deposited in the office of state.  
which the boundary of 1783. was predicated, the line of 49.° passes through the Southern part of the lake of the Woods: and the NorthWestern point of the lake of the Woods, as observed by Thompson, Astronomer to the North West company, is in Lat. 49°-37.’ [Mc.Kenzie’s 2. voyage chapt. 13.] at that lake therefore the English negotiators ceased to pursue the water communication, because, South of the latitude of that lake, they owned nothing: and to have followed the water line furth

point of the lake of tlie Woods, was at least as  
high moth as the latitude 43. By the observati­  
ons of Mr. Thompson, astronomer to the North­  
Western company, it appears to be in latitude  
49 degrees 37 minutes. By joining then the  
western boundary of Canada to its northern in the  
lake of the Woods, and closing both there, it  
follows that it was the obvious intention of the  
ministers who ncgociated the treaty, and of their  
respective governments, that the United States&#x27;
