son; but I rather think, the design of Genl Howe, is to possess himself of Philadelphia this Winter, if possible, and  
  
in truth, I do not see what is to prevent him, as ten days more will put an end to the existence of our Army; that One great point, is to keep us as much harrassed as possible with a view to injure the recruiting service, and hinder a collection of Stores; and other necessaries for the next campaign, I am as clear in, as I am of my existence; If therefore we have to provide in this short interval and make these great &amp; arduous preparations, every matter that in its nature is self evident, is to be referred to Congress, at the distance of 130 or 40 miles, so much time must necessarily elapse as to defeat the end in view.  
It may be said, that this is an application for powers, that are too dangerous to be intrusted. I can only add, that desperate diseases, require desperate remedies, and with truth declare, that I have no lust after power but wish with as much fervency as any man upon this wide extended Continent for an Opportunity of turning the Sword into a ploughshare; But my feelings as an Officer and a man, have been such, as to force me to say, that no person ever had a greater choice of difficulties to contend with than I have. It is needless to add, that short inlistments, and a mistaken dependance upon Militia, have been the Origin of all our misfortunes, and the great accumulation of our Debt.  
We find Sir, that the Enemy are daily gathering strength from the disaffected; This strength, like a Snowball by rolling, will increase, unless some means can be devised to check effectually, the progress of the Enemy’s Arms: Militia may possibly do it for a little while; but in a little while also, the Militia of those States which have been frequently called upon, will not turn out at all, or if they do, it will be with so much reluctance and sloth as to amount to the same thing—Instance New Jersey! Witness Pensylvania! could any thing but the River Delaware have saved Philadelphia? can any thing (the exigency of the case indeed may justifye it), be more destructive to the recruiting service, than giving Ten dollars bounty for Six weeks service of the Militia, who come in, you can not tell how—go, you cannot tell when—and act, you cannot tell where—consume your provisions—exhaust your Stores, and leave you at last at a critical moment. These Sir, are the men, I am to depend upon, Ten days hence. This is the Basis on which your Cause will and must for ever depend, till you get a large standing Army, sufficient of itself to oppose the Enemy. I therefore beg leave to give it as my humble Opinion, that 88 Batallions are by no means equal to the opposition you are to make, and that a moments time is not to be lost in ra

It may be thought, that, I am going a good deal out of the line of my duty, to adopt these measures, or to advise thus freely. A character to loose—an Estate to forfeit—the inestimable blessing of liberty at Stake, and a life devoted, must be my excuse.
