The total amount of the debts which the said Corporation shall at any time owe whether by bond bill note or other contract shall not exceed the sum of ten millions of Dollars over and above the monies then actually deposited in the bank for safekeeping: unless the contracting of any greater debt shall have been previously authorised by a law of the United States. In case of excess the Directors under whose administration it shall happen shall be liable for the same in their natural or private capacities; and an action of debt may in such case be brought against them or any of them or any of their heirs executors or administrators in any Court of record of the United States or of either of them by any creditor or Creditors of the said Corporation and may be prosecuted to judgment and execution any condition covenant or agreement to the contrary not withstanding.

clares, that “the lands it shall hold are only such as  
shall be requisite for its immediate accommodation in  
relation to the convenient transacting of tis business,  
and such as shall be mortgaged to it by way of secu-  
rity or conveyed in the satisfaction of debts provi-

chased ut sales upon judgments,which shall have been  
obtained for such debts.” Ifthe bank should acquire  
lands in any other mode, or for any other purpose,  
than this article allows, would its title be valid?  
The court presumes not. Consequently, among  
the same articles adopted for its government, the  
court will look for its power and capacity to acquire  
or hold personal estate. Accordingly, in the 9th  
article of the same section, this emphatic restric-  
tion is found: The said corporation shall not direct-  
ly nor indirectly deal or trade in any thing, except  
biils of exchange, gold or silver bullion, or in the

Corporation shall at any time owe, whether

ment of a considerable proportion of its capital. In New York  
no bank can make loans or discounts until all its capital is paid in.  
  
The fifth section provides that ‘the total amount of debts  
which any banking corporation shall at any time owe, whether  
by bond, bill, note, or other contract, shall not exceed twice the  
amount of its capital stock actually paid in, exclusive of sums due  
on account of deposits, nor shall there be due to any corporation  
at any one time, more than double the amount of its capital  
stock actually paid in. In case of excess of debts so due from  
said bank, the directors under whose administration it shall  
happen, shall be liable for the same in their private capacities.’  
  
This regulation of the amount of business to be done by a bank  
by the amount of its capital, is undoubtedly judicious. The  
propriety of some regulation of this kind, is now well under-  
stood in all parts of our country, though the provisions are  
various. Thus the United States Bank is only allowed to owe  
the amount of its capital beyond its deposits. In Connecticut

interest;-nor shall there be due to such bank, at any

thf. directors, under whose administration it shall  
happen, shall be liable for the excess, in their private  
capacities; and an action of debt may in such case be

creditor of such corporation, and may be prosecuted

may have aremedv by a bill in equity against them,

may have dissented from the resolution or act where­  
by the same was contracted, may exonerate them­

By the 8th rule of the Commercial Bank of Macon, it is  
provided that “ The total amount of the debts which the said  
corporation shall atany time owe, whether by bond, bill, note  
or other contract, shall not exceed three times the amount  
of their stock paid in, over and above the amount of money  
actually deposited in their vaults for safe keeping ; in case of  
excess, the directors under whose administration it shall  
happen, shall be liable for the same, in their individual,  
natural, aud private capacity ; and an action of debt may,  
in such case, be brought against them, orany of them, their  
executors or administrators, in any Court of record in the  
United States having competent jurisdiction, or either of  
them, by any creditor or creditors of the same corporation,  
and may be prosecuted to judgment and execution, any con-  
dition, or covenant or agreement, to the contrary notwith-  
standing. But this shall not be construed to exempt the  
said corporation, or the lands and tenements, goods and  
chattles of the same, from being also liable for, and charg-  
able with the said excess; and each of the said directors

lor, the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. The ques-  
tion turned upon the construction of the 3rd and 9th sections  
of the plaintiffs’ charter of incorporation. The 3rd section  
provided that they “shall be in law capable of purchasing,  
holding and conveying estate, real and personal, for the use  
the said corporation.” The 9th section enacted “That the lands,  
tenements and hereditaments, which it shall be lawful for the  
said corporation to hold, shall be only such as shall be required  
for its accommodation, in relation to the convenient transaction  
of its business, or such as shall have been bona fide mortgaged  
to it by way of security, or conveyed to it in satisfaction of  
debts previously contracted in the course of its dealings, or  
purchased at sales, upon judgments which shall have been  
obtained for such debts.”  
  
Upon the argument, the defendant, in support of his demur-  
rer, contended that the plaintiffs were not authorized by their  
eharter to make such a contract as that stated in their bill;  
that the buying and selling of real estate, except in the cases

TAXES AND THE BANK Ol&#x27; TEN­  
NESSEE.There appears to be an erroneous impres­  
sion as to the extent to which the notes of  
the Bank of Tennessee arc receivable for  
taxes under the late decision of the Su  
  
preme Court of the United States. Neither  
  
that decision nor the charter of the bank  
authorizes the holders of the notes of that  
institution to pay their county or coqiora­  
tion taxes with ouch notes. The twelfth  
section of the charter provides as follows:  
&quot;That the bills or notes of the said corr  
poration, originally made payable, or  
which shall have become payable on de­  
mand, in gold or silver coin, shall be re­  
ceivable at the treasury of the State, and  
by all tax collectors and other public offi­  
cers, in all payments for taxes or other  
monies due to the State.  
It will be seen that this section makes  
no provision as to tho paj&#x27;ment of county  
or corporation taxes with the issues of the  
bank. In the case decided by the Supremo  
Court of the United States, the parties only  
offered to pay the State taxes with the  
  
notes of the Bank of Tennessee. For  
the taxes due to the county they made a  
tender of greenbacks. J3o there was no  
issue before the court involving the ques­  
tion of the right to pay county a

ty, to receive from him one hundred  
and thirty dollars in the notes of the  
Bank of Tennessee, issued after May 6,  
1861, in payment of his State taxes for  
the year 1872. The attorney-general  
for the State assigned various causes of  
demurrer, which were sustained by  
Judge Guild, and the petition dismissed.  
The first question raised by the de­  
murrer, is as to the jurisdiction of the  
common law court to grant the writ of  
mandamus. The petitioner bases his  
application upon a right secured to him  
by section twelve of the charter of the  
Bank of Tennessee, which provides,  
that &quot;the bills or notes of the said cor­  
poration, originally made payable, or  
which shall have become payable on  
demand, in gold or silver coin, shall be  
receivable at the Treasury of the State,  
and by all tax-collectors and other pub­  
lic officers in all payments for taxes or  
other moneys due the State.&quot; It is as­  
sumed that by this provision of the  
bank charter, the State entered in to a  
contract with every holder of any of the

of the said Mechanics’ Bank at the time said deed purports  
to have been executed, and that they or either of them was  
not authorized to act for said Bank in that behalf.” She  
also alleged “that the legal and equitable title to said prop-  
erty was still in said Mechanics’ Bank, and that said W. T.  
Gould has no interest in or title to said property or any in-  
terest therein.”  
  
The charter of the corporation provided that the directors  
“who shall be chosen at any election shall be capable of  
serving as directors by virtue of such choice until the end of  
the first Monday in January next, ensuing the time of such  
election, and no longer ; and the said directors at their first  
meeting after each election, shall choose one of their num-  
ber as president.” The same section of the charter also  
contained a provision, “that in case it should at any time  
happen that an election of directors should not be made  
upon any day when pursuant to this act it ought to have  
been made, the said corporation shall not for that cause be  
deemed to be dissolved, but it shall be lawful on any other day  
to hold and make an election of directors, in such manner  
as shall have been regulated by the rules and by-laws of  
said corporation.”  
  
The evidence showed that the board of directors was  
elected in 1865, but that no election was held in 1866; and  
that “the president and other officers” held “ over and” dis-  
charged “the duties of their respective offices till the date of  
the assignment.” The testimony also tended to show that  
there was a meeting of the stockholders of the bank in Janu-

The bank was to continue until March 3, 1836. It was  
forbidden, except for deposits, to contract debts in excess of  
its capital without the authority of Congress. It was for-
