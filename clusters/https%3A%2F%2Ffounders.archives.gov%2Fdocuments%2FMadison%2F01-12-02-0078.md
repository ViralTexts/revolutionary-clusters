M again possess so much power and influence.  
  
[30 April 1789]  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.  
Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the fourteenth day of the present month. On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years: a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my Country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens, a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with dispondence, one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration, ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver, is, that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance, by which it might be affected. All I dare hope, is, that, if in executing this task I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof, of the confidence of my fellow-citizens; and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me; my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me, and its consequences be judged by my Country, with some share of the partiality in which they originated.  
Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station; it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official Act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe, who presides in the Councils of Nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the People of the United States, a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes: and may enable every instrument employed in its Administration, to execute with success, the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of my fellow-citizens at large, less than either. No People can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand, which conducts the Affairs of men more than the People of the United States. Every step, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency. And in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their United Government, the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities, from which the event has resulted, cannot be compared with the means by which most Governments have been established, without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me I trust in thinking, that there are none under the influence of which, the proceedings of a new and free Government can more auspiciously commence.  
By the article establishing the Executive Department, it is made the duty of the President “to recommend to your consideration, such measures as he shall Judge necessary and expedient.” The circumstances under which I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that subject, farther than to refer to the Great Constitutional Charter under which you are assembled; and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications, I behold the surest pledges, that as on one side, no local prejudices, or attachments; no seperate views, nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great Assemblage of communities and interests: so, on another, that the foundations of our National policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality; and the pre-eminence of free Government, be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its Citizens, and command the respect of the world. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my Country can inspire: since there is no Truth more thoroughly established, than that there exists in the œconomy and course of nature, an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness, between duty and advantage, between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy, and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity: Since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven, can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven itself has ordained: And since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of Government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.  
Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide, how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the Fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present Juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the System, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them.  
Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good: For I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an United and effective Government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience; a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen, and a regard for the public harmony, will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified, or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.  
  
To the preceeding observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed to the Hous[e] of Representatives. It concerns myself, and will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honoured with a call into the service of my Country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departe[d.] And being still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myself, any share in the personal emoluments, which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the Executive Department; and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the Station in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.  
Having thus imparted to you my sentiments, as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the human race, in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to [favour] the American people, with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility, and dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a form of Government, for the security of their Union, and the advancement of their happiness; so this divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.

 obedience to -  
peblic fammons, repsired to the Pty  
fent ttauon: it wou ‘ld be pe =e  
improper to omit, ia thi s fir cfficiz 1  
2ét, my fervent fupplications to that  
Al ni hey Being W ho ules over the  
  
Nip TuUIeCS  
univerfe—who prec ides in the coun-  
cils of nations—and whofe provicen-  
tial aids can fupply every human de-  
feét—-that his benedi@ion may confe-  
crate to the liberties and happinefs of  
the people of the United States, a  
government inftituted by themfelves  
for thefe effential purpofes ; and may  
enable every inftrument employed in  
its adminifiration, to execute with  
fuccefs the funGions allotted to his  
charge. In tendering this anne to  
the great author of every public and  
private good, I affure myfelf thatit  
exprelies your fentiments not lefs  
than my own; nor thofe of my fel-  
Jow citizens at large, lefs than either.  
No people can be bound to acknow-  
ledge ond adore the invilible hand,  
which condu@s the affairs of men,  
more than the people of the United  
States.  
  
Every f epby which they have ad-  
vaneed to the charaGer of an inde-  
pendent nation, feems to have been  
Ciftinguifhed by fome token of pro-  
vidential agency. And in the im-  
portant revolution jutt 2 ecomplifhed  
inthe fyflem of their united govern-  
ment, the tranquil deliber ations ,and  
voluntary confent of fo many diftingt  
communities, from which the event  
has refulted, cannot be compared  
  
with the means by which moft go-  
vernments have been eftablithed,  
without fome return of pious grati-  
tuce, along with an humble anticipa-  
tion of the future blefiings which the  
patt feem to prefage. ‘Dhefe reflec-  
tions, arifing out of the prefent cri-  
fis, have forced themfelves too ftrong-  
ly on my mind to be fuppretied.—  
Yoo will join with me, I truft,  
  
thinking, that there are none under  
the intiuence of which the proceed-  
ings of a new and free government  
can more aufpicioufly commence.  
  
By the article eftablithing the exe-  
cutive depart ent, itis made the cu-  
ty of the Preticent ‘to recommend  
to your confideration fuch meafures  
as he thail judge neceflary and expe-  
dient.” The circumftances under  
wiich IL now meet you, will acquit  
ine from entering imto that fubje ét,  
farther than to reter to the great con-  
fiitutional charter under which you  
are affembled, and which, in defining  
your powers, defignates the objects to  
which your attention is to be given.  
li will be more confifent with thofe  
circumttances, and far more conge-  
nial with the feelings which actuate  
me, tu fubftitute, in place of a recom-  
mendation of particular meafures, the  
tribute that is due to the talents, the  
rectitude, and the patriotifm which  
adorn the charaéters {elected to de-  
vife and adopt them. In thefe honor-  
able qualifications, I behold the fureft  
pledy lves, that as on one fide no local  
pre}. adices, or attachments—no fepa-  
rate views, nor party animofiues,  
will mifdire&amp;t the comprehenfive and  
equal eye which ought to watch over  
this great affemblage of communities  
and interefls; fo, on another, that  
the foundations of our national polt-  
cy wili be laid in the pure and immu-  
table principles of private morality ;  
and the ef eminence of free govern-  
ment be exemplified by all the ateri-  
  
butes which can win the affe@tions of  
its citizens, and command the refpect  
of the world.—I dweil on this prof-  
pett with every fatisfaction which an  
  
  
  
  
  
ardent love for my country can in-  
{pire.  
  
Since there is notruth more tho-  
roughly ettablithed, than that there  
extiis in the economy and courfe of  
nature, an indifieluble union between  
virtue and happinefs, between cuty  
and advants . between the ge nuine  
maxims Qt “dn act and magiaan: m-  
ous poly, and the folid rewards of  
pubic profperity and felicity. Since  
we ought to be nm lely perfa: aided that  
the propitious {miles of heaven, can  
never be expected on a nation that  
difregards the eternal rules of order  
and nght, which Heaven itfeif has  
ordained. And fince the prefervati-  
on of the facred fire of liberty, and  
the deftiny of the republican moéel  
of government, are ju iftly confidered  
as deeply, pe chaps as finally ftaked on  
the experiment entrutted to the hands  
of the American people. °  
  
Befides the ordinary objeéts fub-  
mitted to your care, it will remain  
with your judgment to cecide, how  
far anexercife of the occafional pow-  
er delegated by the fifth article of the  
op Crea is rendered expedient  
at the prefent janéture by the nature  
of vu! ject ions which have been urged  
again! e fyftem, or by t] e degree  
oO} it maeiante which has given birth  
to them.  
  
Inflead of undertaking particular  
recommendations on this fubjeét, in  
which I could be guided by n a high its  
derived from official opportunities, I  
fhall again give way to my entire  
contick ace in vour difcernment and  
puriuit of the pub lic good,  
  
For I  sfhawe myfeif, that whilf

which might endanger the benefits

438 Addrefs to the prefident of the united fates, (May,  
  
eye which onght to waich over this  
great affeinblage of communities and  
interefts; fo, on another, that the  
foundations of our national policy  
will be laid in the pure and immutable  
principles of private morality; and  
the pre-eminence of free government,  
be exemplihed by all the attributes  
which can win the alletions of its ci-  
tizens, and command the refpect of  
the world. I dwell on this profpett  
with every fatisfaction which an ar-  
dent love for my country can in{pire :  
{ince there is no truth more thorough-  
ty eftablifhed, than that there exills in  
the economy and courfe of nature,  
an ind:ffoluble union between virtue  
and happinefs, between duty and ad-  
vaniave, between the genuine max-  
ims of an honeft and magnanimous  
policy, and the fold rewards of  
public profperity and felicity: fince  
we ought to be no lefs perfuaded, that  
the propitious fmmles of heaven can  
never be expecied on a nation that  
difregards the eternal rules of order  
and right, which heaven itfelf has  
orda ned: and {ince the prefervation  
of the facred fire of liberty, and the  
deftiny of the republican model of go-  
vernment, are jultly confidered as  
deeply, perhaps as finally ftaked, on  
the experiment entrufted to the hands  
of the American people.  
  
Befides the ordinary objeéts fub-  
mitted to your care, 1 will remain  
with your judgment to decide, how  
far an exercife of the occafional pow-  
er delegaied by the fifth article of the  
conflitution is rendered expedient at  
the prefent juncture, by the nature of  
objections which have been urged  
againft the fyltem, or by the degree  
of inquietude which has given birth  
to them, Inflead of undertaking  
pirticular recommendations on this  
fubject, in which I could be guided  
by no lights derived from official op-  
portunities, I fhall again give way to  
my eutire confidence in your difcern-  
ment and purfuit of the public good ;  
for I allure myfelf that whillt you  
carefilly avoid every alteration which  
might endanger the benefits of an  
united and efie¢étive government, or  
which ought to await the future lef-  
fons of experience ; a reverence for  
the charatteriftic rights of freemen,  
and a regard for the public harmony,  
will fufliciewtly influence your delibe-  
  
rations on the queflion, how far the  
former can be more impregnably for.  
tihed, or the latter be fafely and ade  
vantageoully promoted ?  
  
Vo the preceding obfervations |  
have one to add, which will be mog  
properly addrefled to the houfe of re.  
prefentatives, [t concerns myfeif  
and will therefore be as brief as pofi.  
ble. When I was firft honoured  
with a call into the fervice of my  
country, then on the eve of an ardy.  
ous firuggle for its liberties, the foly  
in which I contemplated my duty te.  
quired that 1 fhould renounce every  
pecuniary compentation, From ths  
refolution I have in no inflance ge  
parted. And being {till under the  
impreflions which produced it, £ mul  
decline, as inapplicable to mytelf, ayy  
fhare in the perfonal emolumeny,  
which may be indifpenfably included  
in a permanent provifion for the ex.  
ecutive department ; and mult accord.  
ingly pray that the pecuniary el.  
mates for the lation in which Jaa  
placed, may, during my continuance  
in it, be linnted to fuch atlual expen  
ditures asthe public good may ke  
thought to require.  
  
Having thus imparted to you my  
fentiments, as they have been awat-  
ened by the occafion which bring  
us together, I fhall take my_prefent  
leave ; but not without reforting onc:  
more to the benign Parent of ihe hi  
man race, in humble fupplicatron, tha  
fince he has been pleafed to favour  
the American people, with opportis  
nities for deliberating in perfett tra  
quility, and difpofitions for deciding  
with unparalleled unanimity on 2  
form of government, for the fecunty  
of their union, and the advancement  
of their happine(s; fo his divine biel  
fing may be equally confpicuows 2  
the enlarged views, the temperate con  
fultations, and the wife meafures 0  
which the fuccefs of this government  
mult depend. G. Wasnintos

MONG the viciflitudes incident

me with greater anxicties than that

on the 14th day of the prefent month.  
—On the one hagd, I was fummoned

which was rendered every day more

by the addition of habit or inclination,  
and of frequent interruptions in my

on itby time, On the other hand, the  
magnitude and difficulty of the trutt

between the genuine maxims of an honetft

wards of publick profperity and felicity.  
Since we ought to be no lefs perfuaded that

ed with a call into the fervice of my coun-  
try, then on the eve of an arduous ftruggle  
for its liberties, the light in which I con-  
templated my duty, required that 1 thould  
renounce every pecuniary compentfation.  
From this refolution I have in no inftance  
departed. And being fill under the im-  
preflions which produced it, I mutt de-  
cline, as inapplicable to myfelt, any thare in  
the perfonal emoluments, which may be in-  
difpenfably includad in a permanent provi-  
fion for the executive department ; and mutt

mates for the tation in which I am placed,  
nets Custas my continuation in it, be lim-  
ited to fuch actual expenditures as the pub-  
lick good may be thought to require.  
  
Having thus imparted to you my fenti-  
ments, as they have been awakened by the  
occafion which brings us together, I thall  
take my prefent leave ; but not without re-  
forting once more to the benign parent of  
the human race,in humble fupplication,  
that fince he has been pleafed to favour the  
American people with opportunities for de-  
liberating in perfect tranquillity, and difpo~  
fitions for deciding with unparalieled unani-  
mity on a form of government for the f{e-  
curity of their union, and the advancement  
of their happinefs ; fo his divine blefling

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
TE L LOW-Ct Tl ZENS OF THE SENATE,  
anp of the House of Representatives,  
AMONG the viciflitudes incident to life, no event could hafve  
filltd me with greater anxieties, than that of which the notification  
was&#x27; transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day ol  
the present month.—On the one hand, I was summoned by my  
country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and  
love, from a retre. which I had chosen with the fondeft predi­  
lection, and in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision,  
as the asylum of my declining years ; a retreat which was rendered  
every day more necefTary as well as more dear to me, by the ad­  
dition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my  
heal oh to the gradual waftc committed on it by time. On the  
other the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the  
voice of my country called me, being fufficient to awaken in the  
wisest and mod experienced of her citizens, a diftruflful scrutiny  
into his qualifications, &#x27;could not but overwhelm with despondence,  
one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature, and un­  
praftifed in the duties of civil adminillration, ought to be pecu­  
liarly conscious of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emo­  
tions, all I dare aver, is, that it has been my faithful study to col­  
lect my duty from ajuft appreciation of every circumstance, by  
v. hidi it might be afte&amp;ed. All 1 dare hope, is, that, if in execu­  
ting this task, I have been too much swayed by a grateful remcm­  
bran eof former inflances, or bv an affe&amp;ionate sensibility to this  
tranfeendant prods of the confidence of my fellow citizens; and  
have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disincli­  
nation, for the weighty apd untried cares before me; my error  
will be palliated by the motives which misled me, and its confe­  
rences b&amp; judged by my country, with some share of the parti­  
ality in which they originated.  
Such being the imprefTions under which I have, in obedience to  
the public furmnons, repaired to thp present flation ; it would be  
peculiarly improper to omit in this firfl official a£i, my fervent  
supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe;  
prefidcs in the councils of nations, and whose providential  
aids can supply every human defett, that hisbencdi&amp;ion may con­  
secrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United  
States, a government instituted by themselves for these effeii-al  
purposes ; and may enable every instrument employed in its ad­  
miniflration, to execute with success, the tunftions allotted to his  
charge. In tendering this homage to the great author of every  
public and private good, I aflurc myfelf that it exprelTes your feq­  
tiinents not less than my own; nor those of my fellow citizens at  
large, less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge  
and adore the invisible hand, which condu6ls the affairs of men  
more than the people of the United States. Every flep by which  
they have advanced to the character of an independent nation,  
seems to have been distinguished by fdme token of providential  
agency. And in the important revolution just accomplished in the  
system of their united government, the tranquil deliberations, and  
voluntary consent of so many diftinfl communities, from which  
the event has resulted, cannot be compared with the means by  
which moll governments have been eflablifhed, without some re­  
turn of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the  
future bleflings which the part; seem to presage. These reflections  
arising out of the present cr ris, have forced themselves too firong­  
ly orypy mind to be fupprefTed. You will join with me, I trust,  
in thinking, that there are none under the influence of which, the  
proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously  
commence.  
By the article establishing the executive department, it is made  
the duty of the President to &quot; recommend to your consideration,  
such meafuresas he shall judge neceflary and expedient.&quot; The cir­  
eumftances under which I now meet you,will acquit me fiom enter­  
ing into that fubjefl, farther than to refer to the great conilitutional  
charter under which you arc aflembltd, aud which, in defining  
your powers, designates the obje&amp;sto which your attention is to be  
given. It will be more confident with those circumstances, and  
far more congenial with the feeiings which actuate me, to substitute,  
in place of a rccommrndation of particular measure.% the tribute  
that is due to the talents, the reClitqde, and the patriotism which  
adorn the characters fele£ted to dcvifc and adopt them. In those  
honorable qualifications, I behold the surest pledges, that as on one  
fide no local prejudices, or attachments—no separate views,no par­  
ty nnimofities, will mifdircft the comprehensive and equal eye  
which ought to watch over this great aftemblage of communities  
and interests; so, on the other, that the foundations of our national  
policy will belaid in the pure and immutable principles of private  
morality; and the pre-eminence of free government, be exempli­  
fied by all the attributes which can win the affe&amp;ions of its citizens,  
and command the refpe£t of the world—l dwell on this profped  
with every fatisfaftion which an ardent love of my country can in­  
spire. Sincc there is no truth more thoroughly eflablifhed, than  
that there exists in the oeconotny and course of nature, an indiflo­  
lub:cunion between virtue and happiness ; between duty and ad­  
vantage, between genuine maximsof an honest and magnanimous  
policy, and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity.  
Since we ought to be no If fs pcrfuaded that the propitious smiles of  
heaven, can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eter­  
nal rules of order and right, which heaven itfelf has ordained. And  
since the prefcrvation of the sacred fire .of liberty, and the destiny  
of the republican model of government, are justly considered as  
deeply 1 perhaps as finally flaked on the experiment entrufled to the  
hands of the American people.  
Bcfides the ordinary objetls submitted to your care, it will re­  
main with your judgment to decide, how far an exercise of the  
occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is  
rendered expedient at the present jun&amp;ure by the nature of objec­  
tions which have been urged against the system, or by the degree  
of inquietude which has given birth to them.  
Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this fab­  
le#, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official  
opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in  
your difcernmpnt andpuifuit of the public good.  
  
•S.WDI}(O ITAI3  
  
For I allure myfelf that wnilAyou carefully avoid very altera­  
tion which lnjtfht endanger the benefit&#x27;* of an united and effective  
government, or which ought to await the future leflbn ot expe, -  
once ; a reverence for the chara&amp;eriilic rights ot freemen, and a ic­  
ard for the public harmony, will fufficiently influence your de­  
• Derations on thequcition how far th former can be more lmpreg­  
nably fortified, or the latter be fafely and advanta ;eoufly promoted.  
To the preceding observations I have one to add, which will he  
noil properly addrefled to the house of reprefentatives,it concerns  
myfelf, and will therefore be as brief as poflible.  
When I was firft honoured wfth a call into the service of my  
country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties,  
!he light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should  
renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I  
&#x27;.aVe in no instance departed. And being still under the impressions  
which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myfelf, any  
hare personal emoluments, which may be indispensably con­  
luded in a permanent provifionfor the executive department; and  
must accordingly prayi that the pecuniary estimates for the station  
id which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be li­  
mited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought  
o require.  
Having thus imparted to you my sentiments, as they have been  
rwakened by the occasion which brings us together—l shall take  
my present leave ; but not without resorting once more to the benign  
parent of the human race, in humble supplication, that since he  
ias been pleased tr» favour the American people with opportunities  
;or deliberating in perfett tranquility, and dispositions for deciding  
vith unparalleled unanimity on a form of government, for the  
fe urity of their union, and the advancement of their happiness ;  
so his divine blefllng rnay be equally conspicuous in the enlarged  
views, the temperate consultations, and the wife&#x27;meafure&#x27;s on which  
flhe success of fhis government must depend.

and, in my flattering hopes, with an  
immutable decision as the asylum of  
my declining years —A retreat  
which was rendered every day more  
neceflary as well as mcre dear to me,  
by theaddition of habit to inclination,  
and of frequent interruptions in my  
health to the gradual waite committed  
on it by time. Oa the other hand,  
the magnifude and difficulty of the  
trust to which the voice of my country  
called me, being fufficient to awaken  
in the wisest and most experienced of  
her citizens, a diftruitful scrutiny in­  
to his qualifications, could not but  
overwhelm with despondence, one,  
who inheriting inferior endowments  
from nature, and unpratifed in the  
duties of civil administration, ought  
to be peculiarly conscious of his own  
ceficiencies. In this confli¢t of emo­  
tions, all I dare aver is, that it has  
been my faithful study to colle&amp;t my  
daty from a just appreciation of every  
circumfitance by which it might beef­

THURSDAY, Mayi4, 1789,  
  
inexecuting this tatk I have been too  
much {waycd by a grateful rememb­  
rance of former initances, or by an  
affectionate sensibility to this trans­  
cendent proof of the confidence of my  
fellow-citizens ; and have thence too  
little consulted my incapacity as well  
as disinclination for the weighty and  
untried cares before me ; my error  
will be palliated by the motives which  
misled me, and its consequences be  
judged by my country, with {ome  
{hare of the partiality in which they  
originated.  
Such being the imprefiions under  
which I have, in obedience to the  
public summons, repaired to the pre­  
{ent station ; it would be peculiarly  
improper to omit in this firft official  
a&amp;t, my fervent supplications to that  
Almighty Being, who rules over the  
Universe-—who presides in the Coan­  
cils of nations—and whose providen­  
tial aids can supply every human de­  
fe@t—-that his benedition may ccafe­  
crate to the Jiberties and happiness of  
the pecple of the United States, a  
Government inltituted by themselves  
for these essential purposes, and may  
erable every instrument employed in  
its administration, to execute with  
success, the fun&amp;tions allotted to his  
charge. In tendering this homage to  
the Great Author of every publicand  
private good, I aflure myfelf that it  
exprefles your sentiments not less  
than myown ; nor those of my fellow­  
citizens at large, less than either.  
No people can be bound to acknow.  
ledge and adore the invisible hand,  
which condu@s the affairs of men  
more than the people of the United  
States. Every step, by which they  
have advanced to the charalter of an  
independent nation, seems to have  
beea diftinguithed by some token of  
providential agency. And in the  
importantrevolutionjuft accomplished  
in the {yftem of their United Govern­  
ment, the tranquil deliberations snd  
voluntary coafent cf so many distinct  
communities, from which the event  
has resulted, cannot be compared  
with the means by which most  
goverrments have been established,  
withoat some return of pious grati­  
tude along with an humble anticipa­  
tion of the future bleflings which the  
past seem to presage. These reflec­  
tions, arising out of the present crisis,  
have forced themselves too strongly on  
my mind to be fupprefled. You wiil  
join with me I traft in thinking, that  
there are none under the influence of  
which, the proceedings of a new and  
free government can more auspicious­  
ly commence.  
By the article establishing the Ex­  
ecutive Department, it is made the  
duty- of the President ‘¢ to recom­  
mend to your coafideration, such  
measures as he shall judge neceilary  
and expedient.”” The circamitances  
under which I now meet you, will  
acquit me from entering into that  
fubjeét farther than to refer to the  
Great Constitutional Charter under  
which we are aflembled ; ana which,  
in defining your powers, designates  
the objeéts to which your attention is  
to be given, It will be more consist­  
ent with those circumstances, and far  
more congenial with the feelings  
which a&amp;uate me, to fubflitute 1n  
place of a recommendation of parti­  
cular measures, the tribute that 1s due  
to the talents—the reftitude, and the  
patriotism which adorn the charalters  
selected to devise and adopt them,  
Ia these honorable qualifications, 1  
behold the surest pledges, that is on  
one fide, no local prejudices or at­  
tachments—no separate views nor  
party animosities, will mifdireét the  
comprehensive and equal eye which  
  
ought to watch over this great assem­  
blage of communities and interests :  
so, on another, that the foundations  
of ournational policy will be laid in  
the pure and immutable principles of  
private morality ; and the pre-emi­  
neace of a free government be exem­  
plified by all rthe attributes which  
can win the affeflions of its citizens,  
and command the refpe@ of the  
world.  
I dwell on this profpeét with every  
fatisfa&amp;ion which an ardent love for  
my country can inspire; since there  
is no truth more thoroughly cftablifh­  
ed, than that there exists in the ecano­  
my and course of nature, an indiflolu­  
ble union between virtue and bappi­  
nefs--between duty and advantage--  
between the genuine maxims of an  
honest and magnanimous policy, and  
the solid rewards of public prosperity  
and felicity. Since we ought to be  
vo less persuaded that the propitious  
{miles of Heaven can never be expelt­  
ed on anation that disregards the cter­  
nal rules of order and right, which  
Heaven itfelf has .ordained.-.-And  
since the preservation ofthefacred fire  
or liberty, and the destiny of the re­  
publican model of government, are  
juftily considered as deeply perhaps as  
Jfinally staked, on the experiment in­  
trufted to the hands of the American  
people.  
Besides the ordinary objeéts {ubmit­  
ted to your care, it will remain with  
your judgment to decide how far an  
exercise of the occasional power de­  
legated by the fifth Article of the  
Conftitation is rendered expedient at  
the present junéture by the nature of  
objeétions which have been urged a­  
gainst the system, or by the &#x27;degree of  
inquietude which has given birth to  
them. Instead of undertaking parti­  
cular recommendationson this fubje&amp;,  
in which I could be guided by no  
lights derived from official opporta­  
nities, I thall again give way to my  
intire confidence in your discernment  
and pursuit of the public&#x27;good : For  
I assure myfelf, that whilst you care­  
folly avoid every alteration which  
might endanger the benefits ¢f an u­  
nited and effeftive government, or  
which ought to await the future lessons  
of experience ; a reverence for the  
charatteriftick rights of freemen, and  
a regard for the public harmony, will  
fuficiently influence your delibera­  
tions on the question, how far the for­  
mer can be more impregnably fortifi­  
el,or the latter be fafely and ad­  
vantageou{ly promoted.  
To the preceeding observations I  
have one to add, which will be moit  
properly addressed to the House of  
Representatives. It concerns myfelf,  
and will therefore be as brief as pos­  
sible.--When I was firft honored with  
a call into the service of my country,  
then on the eve ofan arduous struggle  
for iis liberties, the light in which 1  
contemplated my duoty, required that  
I should renounce every pecuniary  
compensation. From this refoiution  
I have in no instance departed. And  
being {till under the impreflions which  
produced it, I must decline as inap­  
plicable to myfelf, any share in the  
perional emoluments, which may be  
indispensably included in a permanent  
provision for the Executive Depari­  
ment ; and mult accordingly pray  
that the pecuniary estimates for the sta­  
tion in which lam placed, may,  
during my continuation in it, be li­  
mited to such attual expenditures as  
the public good may be thought to re­  
quire.  
Having thus imparted to you my  
sentiments, as they have been awa­  
lkened by the occasion which brings us  
together, [fhalltake my present leave ;  
  
(Letter-Box in the window.  
  
but not without resorting once more  
to the Benign Parent of the human  
race, in humble supplication, that  
since he has been pleased to favour the  
American People with opportunities  
for delibefting in perfeét tranquility,

the notification was tranfmitted by your order, and received by  
me on the 14th day of the prefent month, On the other hand  
I was fammoned by my country, whole voice IT never can hear  
but with love and veneration, from a retreat which I had chofen  
with the fondeft predilection, and in my flattering hopes, with  
an immutable decifion, as thé afylum of my declining years ?  
a retreat which was rendered every day more neceflary as well as  
more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of  
frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual wafle_com-  
mitted on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and  
difficulty of the traft to which the voice of my country called mes  
being fofficient to awaken in the wifeft and molt expericaced of  
her citizens a diflruftful f{crutiny into his qualifications, could  
not but overwhelm with defpondency one, who, inheriting ine  
ferior endowments from nature, and unprattifed in the duties of  
civil adminiftration, ought to be peculiarly confcious of his owt  
deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver, 1s5  
that it has been my faithful fudy to collect my duty from an ap-  
preciation of every citcumftance by which it might be affected.  
All I dare hope, is, that if in executing this taf, 1 have been too  
mach iwayed by a grateful remembrance of former initances, or  
by an affectionate fenfibility to this tranfcendant proof of the  
confidence of my fellow citizens; and have thence too lictle cone  
fulte2 my incapacity as well as difinclination for the weighty

GENERAL WaSHINGTON’s SPEECH ¢o both Houses of CONGRESS,  
on the 30th of April 1789.  
  
Fellow citizens of the fenate, and of the  
houfe of reprefenta ives.  
AMonc the viciffitucles incident to life,  
no event could have filled me with  
greater anxieties than that of which the no-  
tification was tranfmitted by your order,  
and received on the 14th day of the pre-  
fent month:—On the one hand, I was  
fummoned by my country, whofe voice I  
can never hear but with veneration and  
love, from a retreat which I had chofen  
with the fondeft predilection, and, in my  
flattering hopes, with an immutable deci-  
fion as the afylum of my declining years :  
a retreat which was rendered every day  
more neceflary as well as more dear to me,  
by the addition of habit to inclination, and  
of frequent interruptions in my health to  
the gradual wafte committed on it by time.  
On the other hand, the magnitude and  
difficulty of the truft to which the voice of  
my country called me, being fufficient to  
awaken in the wifett and moft experienced  
of her citizens a diftruftful fcrutiny into  
his qualifications, could not but over-  
whelm with defpondence one who, inherit-  
ing inferior endowments from nature, and  
unpraétifed in the duties of civil admini-  
ftration, ought to be peculiarly con{fcious  
of his own deficiencies. In this conflict  
of emotions, all I dare aver, is, that it  
hath been my faithful fludy to collet my  
duty from a juft appreciation of every cir-  
cumftance by which it might be aff-Ged.  
All I dare hope is, that if in executing  
this tafk, I have been too much fiwayed by  
a grateful remembrance of former inftances,  
or by an affectionate fentibility to this  
tran{cendent proof of the confidence of my  
fellow-citizens ; and have thence too little  
confulted my incapacity as well as difin-  
clination for the weighty and untried cares  
before me; my error will be palliated by  
the motives which mifled me, and its con-  
feqnences be judged by my country, with  
fome fhare of the partiality in which they  
originated.  
Such being the impreffions under which  
T have, in obedieace to the public fus-  
mons, repaired to the prefent ftation ; it  
would be pecul arly improper to omit in  
thes firft official a&amp; my fervent fupptica-  
tions to that Almighty Being who rules  
x  
  
over the univerfe, who prefides in the  
councils of nations, and whofe providen-  
tial aids can fupply every human defect,  
that his benediétion may confecrate to the  
liberties and happinefs of the people of the  
United States, a government inftituted by  
themfelves for thefe effential purpofes, and  
may enable every inftrument employed in  
its adminiftration, to execute with fuccefs  
the functions allotted to his charge. In  
tendering this homage to the Great Au-  
thor of every public and private good, I  
affure myfelf that it expreffes your fenti-  
ments not lefs than my own; nor thole of  
my fellow citizens at large, lefs than ei-  
ther. No people can be bound to acknow-  
ledge and adore the invifible hand which  
conduéts the affairs of men, more than the  
people of the United States. Every ttep,  
by which they have advanced to the cha-  
raéter of an independent nation, fems to  
have been diftinguifhed by fome token of  
providential agency. And in the impor-  
tant revolution juft accomplifhed in the  
fyftem of their united government, the  
tranquil deliberations and voluntary con-  
fent of fo many diftiné&amp;t communities, from  
which the event has refulted, cannot be  
compared with the means by which moft  
governments have been eftablifhed, with-  
out fome return of pious gratitude along  
with an humble anticipation of the furure  
bleflings which the paft feem to ‘prefage.  
Thefe refletions, arifing out of the prefent  
crifis, have forced themifelves too ttrongly  
on my mind to be fuppreffed. You will  
join with me, I trutt, in thinking, that  
there are none under the influence of which  
the proceedings of a new and free govern-  
ment can more aufpicioufly commence.  
  
By the article eftablifhing the executive  
depaitment, tt is made the duty of the pre-  
fident ‘to recommend to your confidera-  
tion, fuch mea‘ures as he fhall judge ne-  
ceflary and expedient.” The civcumitances  
under which I now meet you, will acquit  
me from entering into that fubje&amp;t fariher  
than to refer to the Great Conititutional  
Charter under which you are affembled ;  
and which, in defining your powers, de-  
fignates the objects to wh:ch your attention  
is to be given. It will be more confitent  
with thofe circumfances, and far more

congenial with the feelings which aCtuate  
me, to fubftitute in place of a recommen-  
tion of particular meafures, the tribute  
that is due to the talents, the reétitude,  
and the patriotifm which adorn the cha-  
racters feleéted to devife and adopt them.  
  
In thefe honourab!e qualifications, I  
behold the fureft pledges, that as on one  
fide, no local prejudices or attachments,  
no {epa: ate views nor party animofities will  
milduweét the comprehenfive and equal eye  
which ought to watch over this great af-  
femblage of communities and interelts ;  
fo, on another, that the foundations of  
our national policy will be lard in the pure  
and immutable princip‘es of private mora-  
lity ; and the preeminence of free govern-  
ment be exemplified by all the attributes  
which can win the affections of its citizens,  
and command the refpect of the world.  
  
I dwell on this profpeét with every fatis-  
fagtion which an ardent love for my coun-  
try can infpre; fince there is no truth  
more thoroughly eitablifhed than that there  
exilts in the economy and courie of nature,  
an indifluluble uncon between virtue and  
happinefs ; between duty and advantage ;  
between the genuine maxims of an honeit  
and magnanimous policy, and the folid re-  
wards of public profperity and felicity.  
Since we ought to be no lefs perfuaded that  
the propitious {miles of Heaven can never  
be expected on a nation that difregards the  
éternal rules of order and right, which  
Heaven itflf has ordained ; and fince the  
prefervation of the faced fire of liberty,  
und the cettiny of the republican m: del of  
government, are jultly confidered as deep-  
ly, perhaps as finally, itaked on the experi-  
ment éntruited to ‘the hands of the Ame-  
rican pecple.  
  
Beiide the ordinary objets fubmitted to  
your care, it will remain with your judg-  
ment to decide how tar an exercife of the  
occational power delegated by the fifth  
article of the conftitution is rendered e pe-  
dent at the prefent juncture by the nature  
of objections which have been urged a-  
ganft the fyttem, or by the degree of in-  
quietude which has given bith to them.  
Inftead of undertaking particular recom-  
mendations on this fubject, in which I  
could be guided by no lighis derived from  
othcial opportunities, I thail again give  
way to my entire confidence in your dil-  
  
cernment and purfuit of the public good s  
for [ ailure myfelf that while you care-  
fully avoid every alteration which might  
endanger the benefits of an united and  
effeftive government, or which ought to  
await the future leffons of experience; 2  
reverence for the charatteiiftic righs of  
freemen, and a regard for the public har-  
mony, will fufficiently influence your de-  
liberations on the queition how far the for-  
mer can be more impregnably fortified, or  
the latter be fafely and advantageouily  
promoted.  
  
To the preceding obrvations I have  
one to add, which will be moft properly  
addvefled to the houfe of reprefentatives.  
It conceins myfe!f, and will therefore be  
as brief as poffible. When I was firt  
honoured w th a ca!l into the fervice of my  
country, then on the eve of an arduous  
ftruggle fer its liberties, the hght in which  
I contemplated my duty required that [  
fhou.d renounce every pecumary compen -  
fation. From this refolution [ have in no  
initance departed. And being ftill under  
the impreilicns which produced it, I muft  
decline, as inappl:cable to mylelf, any  
fhave in the perfonal emoluments which  
may be indilpenfably included in a perma-  
nent provifion for the executive depait-  
ment; and mutt accordingly pray that  
the pecuniary eltimates for the ttation in  
which I am placed, may, during my con-  
tinuation in it, be limited to fuch sétual  
expenditures as the public good may be  
thought to require.  
  
Having thus imparted to you my fenti-  
ments, as they have been awakened by the  
occafion which brings us together, 1 fhall  
take my prefent leave; but not without  
reforting once more to the Benign Parent  
of the human race, in humble fupplication  
that fince he hes been pleated to favour  
the American people with opportunities  
for delberating m perfect nanquillity, and  
difpofitions fur deciding with unparalleled  
unanunity, on a form of governinent for  
the fecurity of then umon, and the ad-  
vancement of their happinefs 5 fo his di-  
vine bieffing may be equally con/picuous  
in the enlarged views, the temperate con-  
  
_fultations, and the wile meafures, on  
  
which the fyccefs of this government muit  
depend.

GENERAL WASHINGTON’s SPEECH #0 both  
Houses gf ConGress, on the 30th of April 1789.  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the Hor  
  
of Reprefentatives, : te Sioa  
  
MONG the viciflitudes incident to life, no event  
could have filled me with greater anxieties  
  
than that of which the notification was tranfmicted  
by your, order, and received on the rath day of the  
prelent month :—On the one hand, I was fummoned  
by my country, whofe voice I can never hear but  
with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had  
chofen with the fondelt predileétion, and, in my fat-  
tering hopes, with an immutable decifion, as the afy-  
lum of my declining years : a retréat which was ren-  
dered every day more neceflary as well as more dear  
to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of  
pregpene interruptions in my health to the gradual  
watte committed on it by time. On the other hand,  
the pagpiryde and difficulty of the truft to which the  
voice of my country called me, being fufficient to.a-  
waken in the wifelt and moft experienced of her ci-  
  
tizens a diftruftful fcrutiny into his qualifieations,  
could not but overwhelm with defpondence one who,  
inheriting inferior endowments from nature, and un-  
practifed in the duties of civil adminiftration, ought  
to be peculiarly conicious of his own deficiencies. —  
In this conflict,of emotions, all I dare aver is, that it  
hath been my faithful {tudy to colleé&amp; my duty from  
a jult appreciation of eyery circumitance Vy which it  
might be affected. AllI dare hope is, that if in exe-.  
cutuig this talk, Ihave been too much fwayed by a  
gratetul remembrance of former initances, or by an  
alfeCtionaté fenfibility:to this, tranfeendent proof of

“ Among the viciflitudes in-  
cident to life, no event could  
  
have filled me with greater anxie-  
  
ties, than that, of which the no-  
tification was tran{mitted by y@ur  
order, and received on the tour-  
teenth day of the prefent month:  
on the one hand, I was fummen-  
ed by my country, whole voice I  
gan never hear but with venera-  
tion and love, from a retreat  
which I had chofen wich, the  
fondelt predile &amp;i ion, and, in my  
flattering hopes, with an immu-  
table decifion, as the afylum of  
my declining years: a retreat  
which was rendered every day  
more neceffary, as well as more  
dear to me, by the addition of  
habit to inclination, and of ne  
quent interruptions in healch, t  
  
the gradual wattle committed on  
it by time. On the other hand,  
the magnitude and difficulty of  
the truft, to which the voice of  
my country called me, being  
fufficient to awaken in the wileit  
and moft experienced of her ci-  
tizens, a diftruitful fcrutiny in-  
te his qualifications, could not but  
overwhelm with defpondence,  
one, who, inheriting inferior  
endowments from nature, and  
unpractifed in the duties of civil  
adminiitration, ought to be pe-  
culiarily confcious of his own ce-  
ficiencies. In this confii of e-  
motions, allI dare aver, is, that  
ithas been my faithful fnudy to  
collect my duty from a juit ap-  
preciation of every circumfiance,  
by which it might be affected.  
All I dare hope, is, that if, in

too much fwayed by a grateful

confequences be judged by my  
country, with fome fhare of the  
partiality in which they ‘orig  
nated.  
  
Such being the impreilteas un-  
der which I have, in obedience  
to the public fummons, repaired

be peculiarly improper to omit in  
this firft official ad, my fervent  
fupplications to that Almighty  
  
eing who rules over the tni-  
verfe, who prefides in the councils  
of nations,;—and whole provi-

rtant revolution jult accom-  
plithed in the fyftem of their Uni-  
nited government, the tranquil  
deliberations and voluntary coa-  
fent of fo many diftindét commu-  
nities, from which the event has  
refulted, cannot be compared  
with the means by which molt  
governments have been eftablith-  
ed, without fome return of pious  
gratitude, along with an humble  
anticipation of the future bletlings  
which the paft feem to prefage.  
Thefe reflexions, arifing out of  
the prefent crilis, have forced  
them{elves too Arongly on my  
mind tobe fupprefled. You will  
joia with me, I truft, in think-  
ing that there are none under  
the influense of which, the pro-  
ceedings of a new and free go-  
vernment can more aulpiciouily  
commence,  
  
By the article eftablifhing the  
executive department, it is made  
the duty of the prefident “ to re-  
commend to your confideration,  
fuch meafures as he fhall judge  
neceflary and expedient.” The  
circumftances under which I now  
meet you, will acquit me from  
entering into that fubject, farther  
than to refer to the great coniti-  
tutional charter under which you  
are aflembled; and which, in  
defining your powers, defignates  
the objects to which your atten-  
tion is tobe given. It will be  
more contiftent with thole cir-  
cumftances, and far more con-  
genial with the feelings which  
actuateme, to fubftitute in place  
of arecommendation of particular  
meafures, the tribute that is due  
to the talents, the rectitude, and  
the patriotifm which adorn the  
characters felected to devife and  
adopt them. In thefle honoura-  
  
ble qualifications, I behold the  
fureit pledges, that as, on one  
fide, no local prejudices or at-  
tachinents—no feparate views—  
nor party aniimolities, will mif-  
direct the comprehentive and  
equal eye which ought to watch  
over this great affemblage of com-  
munities and interelts: fo, on  
another, that the foundations of  
our national policy will be laid in  
the pureand immutable principles  
of private morality ; and the pre-  
eminence of free government, be  
exemplified by all the attributes  
which can win the affections of  
its citizens, and command the  
refpect of the world. I dwell on  
this profpect with every fatisfac-  
tion which an ardeit love for my  
country can infpire : fince there  
isno truth more thoroughly efta-  
biiihed, than that there exifts in  
the economy and courle of na-  
ture an indifloluble union be-  
tween virtue and happinefs, be-  
tween duty and advantage, be-  
tween the genuine maxims of an  
honeftand magnanimous policy,  
and the folid rewards of public  
proiperity and felicity: fince we  
ought to be no lefs perfuaded,  
that the propitious {miles of hea-  
ven can never be expected on a  
nation that difregards the eiernal  
rules of order and right, which  
heaven itfelf has ordained; and  
fince the prefervation of the fa-  
cred fire of liberty, and the delf-  
tiny of the republican model of  
government, are juitly confider-  
ed as deeply, perhaps as finally  
ftaked, on the experiment en-  
trufted to the hands of the A:nes

decide, how far an exercife of  
the oceafional power delegated by  
the fifth article of the conttitution  
jsrendered expedient at the pre-  
fent juncture, by the nature of  
objections which have been urged  
againft the fyitem, or by the de-  
gree of inquietude which has gi-  
ven birth to them. Initead of  
undertaking particular recom-  
mendations on this fubject, ia  
which I could be guided by no  
lights derived from official op-  
portunities, I fhall again give  
way to my entire confidence in  
your difcernment and purfuit of  
the public good : for I aflure my-  
felf that whilft you carefully  
avoid every alteration which  
might endanger the benefits of  
an united and effective govern-  
ment, or which ought to await  
the future Jeflons of experience ;  
areverence for the characterilt:c  
rights of freemen, and a regard  
for the public harmony, will  
fufficiently influence your delibe-  
rations on the queftion, how far  
the former can be more impreg-  
nably fortified, or the Jatrer be  
fafely and advantageoufly pro-  
moted.  
  
To the preceding obfervations  
I have one to add, which will be  
moit properly addrefied to the  
houfe of reprefentatives. It con-  
cerns myfelf, and will therefore  
be as brief as poflible. When I  
was firft honoured with a call in-  
to the fervice of my country,  
then on the eve of an arduous  
ftruggle for its liberties, the light  
in which I contemplated iny du-  
ty required that I fhould re-  
nounce every pecuniary compen-  
fation. Fron this retfolution I  
have in no inftance departed.  
And being fill under the impref-  
  
fions which produced it, I muft  
decline, as inapplicable to myfelf,  
any {hare in the perfonal emolu-  
ments, which may be indifpen-  
fably included in a permanent  
provifion for the executive de-  
partment; and muft accordingly  
pray that the pecuniary eftimates  
for the ftation in which I am  
placed, may, during my con-  
tiauance in it, be limired to fuch  
actual expenditures as the public  
good may be thought to require.  
  
‘Having thus imparted to you

rules over the universe ; who presides in the  
councils of nations, and whose providential aid  
can supply every human defect, that his benedic-

cannot be compared with the means by which  
most governments are established, without some  
return of pious gratitude, along with an humble  
anticipation of the future blessings which the past  
seems to presage. These circumstances have  
forced themselves too strongly upon my mind to

of the human race, in humble supplication, that since he has bee»  
pleased to favour the American people with opportunities for delibe-

public prosperity and felicity : since we ought to be no less persuad-  
ed that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a  
nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which  
heaven itself has ordained : and since the preservation of the sacred

‘‘ Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives,  
  
* Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no event could have filled me  
with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted  
by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present month. On  
the one hand, I was summoned by my country, whose voice I can never  
hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with  
the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable  
decision, as the asylum of my declining years : a retreat which was render-  
ed every day more necessary as well as more dear to me, by the addition  
of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the  
gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude  
and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, be-  
ing sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens  
a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with  
despondence, one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature, and  
unpractised in the duties of civil administration, ought to be peculiarly  
conscious of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare  
aver is, that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just  
appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All I  
dare hope is, that, if in accepting this task, I have been too much swayed  
by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensi-  
bility to this transcendent proof, of the confidence of my fellow citizens ;  
and have thence too little consulted my incapacity, as well as disinclination,  
for the weighty and untried cares before me; my error will be palliated  
by the motives which misled me, and its consequences be judged by my  
country with some share of the partiality in which they originated.  
  
“ Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the  
public summons, repaired to the present station, it will be peculiarly im-  
proper to omit in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that  
Almighty Being, who rules over the universe, who presides in the coun-  
cils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human  
  
  
  
92 WASHINGTON’S INAUGURAL ADDRESS.  
  
defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of  
the people of the United States, a government instituted by themselves for  
these essential purposes; and may enable every instrument employed in  
its administration, to execute with success the functions allotted to his  
charge. In tendering this homage to the great Author of every public and  
private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than  
my own; nor those of my fellow citizens at large, less than either. No  
people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which  
conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States,  
Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an indepen-  
dent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providen-  
tial agency ; and in the important revolution just accomplished in the sys-  
tem of their united government, the tranquil deliberations and voluntary  
consent of so many distinct communities, from which the event has result-  
ed, cannot be compared with the means by which most governments have  
been established, without some return of pious gratitude, along with an  
humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage.  
These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves  
too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me, I  
trust, in thinking that there are none, under the influence of which the  
proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously com-  
  
mence.  
“* By the article establishing the executive department, it is made the  
  
duty of the president to ‘recommend to your consideration, such meas-  
ures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.’ The circumstances  
under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering into that sub-  
ject, farther than to refer to the great Constitutional Charter under which  
you are assembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the  
objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent  
with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which  
actuate me, to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular meas-  
ures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism,  
which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these  
honorable qualifications, I behold the surest pledges, that as, on one side,  
no local prejudices or attachments, no séparate views nor party animosities,  
will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch  
over this great assemblage of communities and interests ; so, on another,  
that the foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and  
immutable principles of private morality, and the preéminence of free  
government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affec-  
tions of its citizens and command the respect of the world. I dwell on  
this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country  
can inspire ; since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that  
there exists, in the economy and course of nature, an indissoluble union  
  
  
  
WASHINGTON’s INAUGURAL ADDRESS. 93  
  
between virtue and happiness,— between duty and advantage, — be-  
tween the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy, and the  
solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity ;— since we ought to be  
no less persuaded, that the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be ex-  
pected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which  
Heaven itself has ordained ; —and since the preservation of the sacred fire  
of liberty, and the destiny of the republican model of government, are  
justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment  
intrusted to the hands of the American people.  
  
“ Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain  
with your judgment to decide, how far an exercise of the occasional power  
delegated by the fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient, at  
the present juncture, by the nature of objections which have been urged  
against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth  
tothem. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this sub-  
ject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportu-  
nities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment  
and pursuit of the public good: for I assure myself that whilst you care-  
fully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of a united  
and effective government, or which ought to await the future lessons of  
experience; a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen, and a  
regard for the public harmony, wiil sufficiently influence your deliberations  
on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified, or  
the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.  
  
“To the preceding observations I have one to add, which will be most  
properly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself,  
and will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honored with  
a call into the service of my country, then on the eve of an arduous strug-  
gle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required  
that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolu-  
tion I have in no instance departed. And being still under the impressions  
which produced it, I must decline, as inapplicable to myself, any share in  
the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a perma-  
nent provision for the executive department ; and must, accordingly, pray  
that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which I am placed, may,  
during my continuance in it, be limited to such actual expenditures as the  
public good may be thought to require.  
  
‘“‘ Having thus imparted to you my sentiments, as they have been awak-  
ened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present  
leave ; but not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the  
human race, in humble supplication, that, since he has been pleased to  
favor the American people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect  
tranquillity, and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity, on a  
form of government for the security of their union and the advancement

of their happiness ; so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in  
the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures, on  
which the success of this government must depend.

circumstances under which he had assumed the

said:  
&quot; It would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first  
official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty  
Being who rules over the universe, who presides in tha  
councils of nations, and whose Providential aids can sup- j  
ply every human dofebt, that his benediction may conse­  
crate to the liberties and happiness of the People of the  
United States a Government instituted by themselves for  
these essential purposes, and may enable every instru­  
ment employed in its administration to execute with suc­  
cess the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering  
this homage to the Great Author of every public and  
private good, I assure myself that,it expresses your sen­  
timents not less than my own, nor those of my fellow­  
citizens at large less than either. No people can be bound  
to acknowledge and adoro the invisible hand which con­  
ducts the affairs of men moro than the people of the  
United States. Every step by which they have advanced  
to the character of an independent nation seems to have  
been distinguished by some token of Providential agen­  
cy ; and, in the important revolution just accomplished in  
the system of their united government, the tranquil de­  
liberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct  
communities from which the event has resulted cannot  
be compared with the means by which most Governments  
have been established without some roturnof pious grati­  
tude, along with an humble anticipation of the future  
blessings which the past seem to pteBage. These reflec­  
tions, arising out of the present crisis, have forced them­  
selves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You  
will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there aro none  
under the influenoe of which the proceedings of a new  
and free Government can more auspiciously commence.&quot;  
&quot; It WTft bo nwtt wmitttat with oiroumstaaooe  
and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate  
me, to substitute, in ptaee of a recommendation ef parti­  
cular measures, the tribute tt?*t ifl due to the talents, the  
rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters  
selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable  
qualifications I behold the surest pledges that, as on one  
side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate  
views nor party animosities will misdirect the compre­  
hensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this  
great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on  
another, that the foundations of our national policy will  
be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private  
morality, and the pre-eminence of free Government be  
exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affec­  
tions of its citizens and command the respect of &#x27;the  
world. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction  
which an ardent love for my country can inspire, since  
there is no truth more thoroughly established than that  
there exists iu the economy and course of Nature an in­  
dissoluble union between virtue and happiness, between  
duty and advantage, between the genuine maxims of an  
honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of  
publio prosperity and felicity ; since we ought to be no  
less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can  
never be expected on a nation th^t disregards the eternal  
rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordain­

the people of the United States. Every step,  
by which they have advanced to the charac­  
ter of an independent nation, seems to have  
been distinguished by some token of provi­  
dential agency, and in the important revolu­  
lion just accomplished, in the system of their  
united government, the tranquil deliberations  
and voluntary consent of so many distinct  
communities, from which the event has re­  
sulted, cannot be compared with the means  
by which most governments have been es­  
tablished, without some return of pious grat­  
itude, along with an humble anticipation of  
the iuture blessings, which the past seem to  
presage. These rcllectious have forced them­  
selves upon my mind too slrongh/ to be snip­

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
of the House of Representatives :  
Among the vicissitudes incident to  
life, no event could have filled me  
with greater anxieties than that of  
which the notification was transmitted  
by your order, and received on the  
14th day of the present month. On  
the one hand, I was summoned by  
my country, whose Voice I can never  
hear but with veneration and love,  
from a retreat which I had chosen  
with the fondest prediction, and, in  
my flattering hopes, with an immuta­  
ble decision, as the asylum of iny  
declining years; a retreat which was  
rendered every day more necessary,  
as well as more dear to me, by the  
addition of habit to inclination, and  
of frequent interruptions in my health;  
to the gradual waste committed on  
it by time. On the other hand, the  
magnitude and difficulty of the trust  
to which the voice of my country call­  
ed me, being sufficient to awaken in  
the wisest a:id most experienced of  
her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into  
his qualifications, could not but over­  
whelm with despondence one, who,  
inheriting interior endowments from  
nature, and unpractised in the duties  
of civil administration, ought to be  
peculiarly conscious of his own de  
ficiencies. In this conflict of emo­  
tions, all I dare aver is, that it has  
been my faithful study t6 collect my  
duty from a just appreciation of every  
circumstance by which it might be  
affected. All I dare hope is that if.  
  
in executing this task, 1 have been  
too much swayed by a greater re­  
membrance of former instances, or by  
an effectionate sensibility of this  
transcendent proof of the confidence  
of my fellow-citizens, and have  
thence too little consulted my inca­  
pacity as well as disinclination for the  
weighty and untried cares before me,  
my error Will be palliated by the mo­  
tives which misled me, and its &quot;con­  
sequences be judged by my country,  
with some share of the partiality in  
which they originated

Such being the impressious under which I have, in

can supply every human defect, that His benedictio

“Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and of  
the House of Representatives : Among the  
vicissitudes incident to life, no event could  
have filled me with greater anxieties than that  
of which the notification w’as transmitted by  
your order, and received on the 14th day of the  
present month. On the one hand, I was sum­  
moned by my country, whoso voice I can never  
hear but with veneration and lose, from a re­  
treat which I had chosen with the fondest pre­  
dilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an  
immutable decision, as the asylum of my de­  
clining years; a retreat which was rendered  
every day more necessary, as well as more dear  
to me, by the addition of habit to inclination,  
and of frequent interruptions iu my health, to  
the gradual waste committed on it by time.  
On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty  
of the trust to which the voice of my country  
called me, being sufficient to awaken in the  
wisest and most experienced of her citizens a  
distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications,  
could not but overwhelm with despondency  
one, who, inheriting inferior endowments trom  
nature, and unpracticed, in the duties of civil  
administration, ought to be peculiarly conscious  
of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emo­  
tions, all I dare aver, is. that it has been my  
fauhful study to collect my duty from a just  
appreciation of every circumstance by which it  
might be affected. All I dare hope, is that if,  
in executing this task, 1 have been too much  
swayed by a grateful remembrance of former  
instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to  
this transcendant proof of the confidence of my  
fellow-citizens, and have thence too little con­  
sulted my incapacity as well as disinclination  
for the weighty and untried cares before me, my  
error will be palliated by the motives wnich  
misled me, and its consequences be judged by  
rny country, with some share of the partiality  
in which they originated.

paired to the present station, it would be pecu­  
liarly improper to omit, in this first official act,  
my fervent supplications to that Almighty Be­  
ing who rules over the universe—who presides  
in the councils of nations—and whose providen­  
tial aids can supply every human defect, that  
his benediction may consecrate to the liberties  
and happiness of the people of ti e United States,  
a government instituted by themselves for these  
essential purposes ; and may enable every in­  
strument employed in it’ administration to  
execute with success the lunctions allotted to  
his charge, &#x27;n tendering this homage to the  
Great Author of every public and private good,  
I assure myself that it expresses your senti­  
ment s not less than my own ; nor those of my  
fellow-citizens at large, less than either. No  
people can be bound to acknowledge and adore  
the invisible bond which conducts the affairs of  
men, more than the people of the United States.  
Every step by which they have advanced to the  
character of an independent nation, seems to  
have been distinguished by some token of provi­  
dential agency ; and in the important revolution  
just accomplished in the system their united  
government, the tranquil deliberations, and vol­  
untary consent of so many distinct ccmmuni­  
ti&quot;S, from which the event has resulted, can not  
be compared with the means by which most  
governments have been established, without  
some return of pious gratitude, along with an  
humble anticipation of the future blessings  
which th© past seem to presage. These reflec-   
  
tiofis. arising out &lt;of the present crisis, have  
forced themselves too strongly on my •mind to  
be suppressed. You will join with me, I trust,  
in thinking that there are none, under the influ­  
ence of which the proceedings of a new and free  
government can more auspiciously commence.   
“By the article establishing the executive de­  
partment, it is made the duty of the President  
‘to recommend to your consideration such  
measures as he shall judge necessary and ex­  
pedient.’ The circumstances under which I  
now meet you will acquit me from not entering  
into that subject, farther than to refer to the  
great constitutional charter under which you  
are assembled; and which, in defining your  
powers, designates the objects to which your at­  
tention is to be given. It will be more consist­  
ent with those circumstances, and. far more con­  
genial with the feeiings which actuate me, to  
substitute, in place of a recommendation of par­  
ticular measures, the tribute that is due to the  
talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism, which  
adorn the characters selected to devise and  
adopt them. In these honorable qualifications  
I behold the surest pledges that, as on one side,  
no local prejudices or atiachments, no separate  
views, nor party animosities, will misdirect the  
comprehensive and equal eye which ought to  
watch over this great assemblage of communi-   
  
tie-, and interests ; so, on unotner, tuau me iuun­  
dations of our national policy will be laid in the  
pure and immutable principles of private mor­  
ality ; and ihe pre-eminence of free government  
be exemplified by all the attributes which can  
win the affections of its citizens, and command  
the respect of the world. I dwell on this pros­  
pect with every satisfaction which an ardent  
love for my country can inspire ; since thero is  
no truth more thoroughly established, than that  
there exists in the economy and course of nature  
an indissoluble union b; tween virtue and hap­  
piness—between duty and advantage—between  
the genuine maxims of an honest and magnani­  
mous policy, and the solid rewards of public  
prosperity and felicity; since we ought to be no  
less persuaded that the propitious smiles of  
heaven can never be expected on a nation that  
disregards the eternal rules of order and right,  
which heaven itself has ordained; and since the  
preservation of the sacred lire of liberty, and  
the destiny of the republican model of govern­  
ment, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps  
as finally, staked on the experiment intrusted  
to the hands of the American people.   
“Besides the ordinary objects submitted to  
your care, it will remain with your judgment to  
decide, how far an exercise of the occasional  
power delegated by the fifth article of the Con­  
stitution is rendered expedient at the present  
juncture, by the nature of objections which  
have been urged against the system, or by the  
degree of inquietude which has given birth to  
them. Instead of undertaking particular rec­  
ommendations on this subject? in which I  
could be guided by no lights derived from official  
opportunities, I shall again give way to my en­  
tire confidence in your discernment and pursuit  
of the public good; for, I assure myself, that  
while you carefully avoid every alteration which  
might endanger the benefits of an united and  
effective government, or which ought to await  
the future lessons of experience, a reverence  
for the characteristic rights of freemen, and a  
regard for the public haimony, will sufficiently  
influence your deliberations on the question,  
how far the former can be more impregnably  
fortified, o - the lattjr be safely and advantage­  
ously promoted.   
“To the preceding observations I have one to  
add, which will be most properly addressed to  
the House of Representatives. It concerns my­  
self, and will, therefore te as brief as posaib&#x27;e.  
When I was first honored with a call into ihe  
service of my country, then on the eve of an  
arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in  
which I contemplated my duty required that I  
shcu d renounce every pecuniary compensation.  
From this resolution I have in no instance de­  
parted ; and being still under the impressions  
which produced it, I must decline, as inappli­  
cable to myself, any share in the personal emol­  
uments which may be indispensably included  
in a permanent provision for the executive de­  
partment; and must accordingly pray that the  
pecuniary estimates for the station in which I  
am placed, may, during my continuance in it,  
be limited to such actual expenditures as the  
public good may be thought to require.   
“Having thus imparted to you my sentiments,  
as they have been awakened by the occasion  
which brings us together, I shall take my pres­  
ent leave; but not without resorting once more  
to the benign Parent of the human race, in  
humble supplication, that, since he baa been  
pleased to favor the American people with op­  
portunities for deliberating in perfect tranquil­  
lity, and dispositions for deciding, with unpar­  
alleled unanimity, on a iorm of government for  
the security of their Union, and the advance­  
ment of their happiness, so his divine blessing  
may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged  
views, the temperate consultations, and the  
wise measures, on which the success of this  
Government must depend.”

APRIL 30, 178g.  
  
Fellow-citizens of the senate and of the  
  
house of representatives :  
  
Among the vicissitudes incident to life,  
no event could have filled me with greater  
anxieties than that of which the notifi-  
cation was transmitted by your order and  
received .on the fourteenth day of the  
present month. On the one hand I was  
summoned by my country—whose voice I  
can never hear but with veneration and  
love—from a retreat which I had chosen  
with the fondest predilection, and, in  
my flattering hopes, with an immutable de-  
cision, as the asylum of my declining years  
—a retreat which was rendered every day  
more necessary, as well as. more dear to  
me, by the addition of habit to inclination,  
and of frequent interruptions in my  
health to the gradual waste committed on  
it by time. On the other hand, the mag-  
nitude and difficulty of the trust to which  
the voice of my country called me being

success, the functions allotted to his.  
charge. In tendering this homage to the  
Great Author of every public and private  
good, I assure myself that it expresses  
your sentiments not less than my own, nor  
those of my fellow-citizens at large less  
than either. No people can be bound to  
acknowledge and adore the invisible hand  
which conducts the affairs of men more  
than the people of the United States.  
Every step by which they have advanced  
to the character of an independent nation  
seems to have been distinguished by some  
token of providential agency ; and in the  
important revolution just accomplished in  
the system of their united government,  
the tranquil deliberations and voluntary  
consent of so many distinct communities  
from which the event has resulted, cannot  
be compared with the means by which  
most governments have been established,  
without some return of pious gratitude,  
along with an humble anticipation of the  
future blessings which the past seems to  
presage. These reflections, arising out of  
the present crisis, have forced themselves  
too strongly on my mind to be suppressed.  
You will join with me, I trust, in thinking  
that there are none under the influence of  
which the proceedings of a new and free  
government can more auspiciously com-  
mence.  
  
By the article establishing the executive  
department, it is made the duty of the  
President “to recommend to your con-  
sideration such measures as he shall judge  
necessary and expedient.” The circum-  
stances under which I now meet you will  
acquit me from entering into that subject,  
further than to refer to the great constitu-  
tional charter under which you are  
  
525  
  
assembled, and which, in defining your  
powers, designates the objects to which  
your attention is to be given. It will be  
more consistent with those circumstances,  
and far more congenial with the feelings  
  
‘which actuate me, to substitute, in place  
  
of a recommendation of particular meas-  
ures, the tribute that is due to the talents,  
the rectitude and the patriotism which  
adorn the characters selected to devise and  
adopt them. In these honorable qualifi-  
cations I behold the surest pledges, that as  
on one side no local prejudices or attach-  
ments, no separate views nor party  
animosities, will misdirect the compre.  
hensive and equal eye which ought to  
watch over this great assemblage of com-  
munities and interests, so, on another,  
that the foundations of our National  
policy will be laid on the pure and  
immutable principles of private morality ;  
and the preéminence of free government  
be exemplified by all the attributes which  
can win the affections of its citizens and  
command the respect of the world.  
  
I dwell on this prospect with every  
satisfaction which an ardent love for my  
country can inspire. Since there is no  
truth more thoroughly established than  
that there exists, in the economy and  
course of nature, an indissoluble union  
between virtue and happiness ; between  
duty and advantage; between the genuine  
maxims of an honest and magnanimous  
policy, and the solid rewards of public  
prosperity and felicity ; since we ought to  
be no less persuaded that the propitious  
smiles of heaven can never be expected  
on a nation that disregards the eternal  
rules of order and right, which heaven  
itself has ordained ; and since the preserva-  
  
  
  
526  
  
tion of the sacred fires of liberty and the  
destiny of the republican model of govern-  
ment are justly considered as deeply»  
perhaps as finally, started on the experi-  
ment entrusted to the hands of the Ameri-  
can people.  
  
Besides the ordinary objects submitted  
to your care, it will remain with your  
judgment to decide how far an exercise of  
the occasional power delegated by the  
fifth article of the Constitution is rendered  
expedient at the present juncture, by the  
nature of objections which have been  
urged against the system, or by the degree  
of inquietude which has given birth to  
them. Instead of undertaking particular  
  
recommendations on this subject, in which  
I could be guided by no light derived  
from official opportunities, I shall again  
give way to my entire confidence in your  
  
discernment and pursuit of the public  
good; for I assure myself that while you  
carefully avoid every alteration which  
might endanger the benefits of a united  
and effective government, or which ought  
to await the future lessons of experience,  
a reverence for the characteristic rights of  
freemen, and a regard for the public har-  
mony, will sufficiently influence your  
deliberations on the question, how far the  
former can be more impregnably fortified,  
or the latter be safely and advantageously  
promoted.  
  
To the preceding observations I have  
one to add, which will be more properly  
addressed to the house of represent-  
atives. It concerns myself, and will,  
therefore, be as brief as possible.

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and of  
the House of Hepresentatives : Among the  
vicissitudes incident to life, no event could  
have filled me with greater anxieties than that  
of which the notification was transmitted by  
your order, and received on the 14th day of the  
present month. On the one hand, I was sum­  
moned by my country, whose voice I can never  
hear but with veneration and love, from a re  
treat which I had chosen with the fondest pre  
dilection, ana, in my nattering hopes, with an  
immutable decision, as the asylum of my de­  
clining years ; a retreat which was rendered  
every day more necessary, as well as more dear  
to me, by tne addition ol nabit to inclination,  
and of frequent interruptions in my health, to  
the gradual waste committed on it by time.  
On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty  
of the trust to which the voice of my country  
called me, being sufficient to awaken in the  
wisest and most experienced of her citizens a  
distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications,  
could not but overwhelm with despondency  
one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from  
nature, and unpracticed in the duties of civil  
administration, ought to be peculiarly conscious  
of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emo­  
tions, all I dare aver, is, that it has been my  
faithful study to collect my duty from a just  
appreciation of every circumstance by which it  
might be affected. All I dare hope, is that if,  
m executing this task, I have been too mncn  
swayed by a grateful remembrance of former  
instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to  
this transcendant proof of the confidence of my  
follow-citizens, and have thenoe too little con­  
sulted my incapacity as well as disinclination  
for the wtighty and untried cares before me, my  
error will be palliated by the motives which  
misled mo, and its consequences be judged by  
my country, with some share of the partiality  
in winch they originated.  
&quot;Such being the impressions under which I  
have, in obedience to the public summons, re-  
raired to the present station, it would be pecu­  
liarly improper to omit, in this first official act,  
my fervent supplications to that Almighty Be  
ing wno rujei over luc uuivcidc wiiu picaiuco  
in the councils of nations and whose providen­  
tial aids can supply every human defect, tnat  
his benediction may consecrate to the liberties  
and happiness of the people of the United States,  
a government instituted by themselves for these  
essential purposes ; and may enable every in­  
strument employt i in its administration to  
execute with success the muctions allotted to  
his charge, in tendering this homage to the  
Great Author of every public and private good,  
I assure myself that it expresses your senti­  
ments not less than my own ; nor those cf my  
fellow-citizens at large, less than either. No  
people can be bound to acknowledge and adore  
the invisible hand which conducts the affairs cf  
men, more than the people of the United States.  
Kverv step by which they have advanced to the

&quot;To the preceding observations I have one to  
add, which will bo most properly addressed to  
the House of Representatives. It concerns my­  
self, and will, therefore, te as brief as possible.  
Wh6n I was first honored with a call into the  
service of my conn ry, then on the eve of an  
arduous struggle for its&quot; liberties, the light in  
which I contemplated my duty required that I  
shou d renounce every pecuniary compensation.  
From, this resolution I have in no instance de­  
parted; and being still t-nder the impressions  
which produced it, I must decline, as inappli­  
cable to myself, any share in the personal emol­  
uments which may ha indispensably included  
in a permanent provision for the executive de­  
partment ; and must accordingly pray that the  
pecuniary estimates f or the s tatiou in which I  
am placed, may, during my continuance in it,  
be limited to such actual expenditures as the  
public good may be thougt-t to require.  
. &quot;Having thus imparted to you my sentiment3,  
as they have been awakened by the occasion  
which brings us together, I shall take my pres­  
ent leave ; but not without resorting onee more  
to the benign Parent of the human race, in  
humble supplication, that, since ho has been  
pleased to favor the American people with op­  
portunities for deliberating in perfect tranquil­  
lity, and dispositions for deciding, with unpar­  
alleled unanimity, on a form of government for

‘‘FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND  
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES :  
  
‘* Among the vicissitudes incident to life,  
no event could have filled me with greater  
anxieties than that of which the notification  
was transmitted by your order, and received  
on the 14th day of the present month. On  
the one hand, I was summoned by my coun-  
try, whose voice I can never hear but with  
veneration and love, from a retreat which  
I had chosen with the fondest predilection,  
and, in my flattering hopes, with an im-  
mutable decision as the asylum of my de-  
clining years—a retreat which was rendered  
every day more necessary as well as more  
dear to me, by the addition of habit to in-  
clination, and of frequent interruptions in  
my health to the gradual waste committed  
on it by time. On the other hand, the mag-  
nitude and difficulty of the trust to which  
the voice of my country called me, being  
sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most  
experienced of her citizens a distrustful  
  
scrutiny into his qualifications, could not  
but overwhelm with despondence one who,  
inheriting inferior endowments from nature,  
and unpractised in the duties of civil ad-  
ministration, ought to be peculiarly con-  
  
scious of his own deficiencies. In this con-  
flict of emotions, all I dare aver is, that it  
has been my faithful study to collect my duty  
from a just appreciation of every circum-  
stance by which it might be affected. All I  
  
dare hope is, that if in accepting this task, .  
  
I have been too much swayed by « remem-  
brance of former instances, or by an affec-  
tionate sensibility to this transcendent proof  
of the confidence of my fellow-citizens and  
have thence too little consulted my incapac-  
ity as well as disinclination for the weighty  
and untried cares before me, my error will  
be palliated by the motives which misled  
me, and its consequences be judged by my  
country with some share of the partiality in  
which they originated. Such being the im-  
pressions under which I have in obedience  
to the public summons repaired to the  
present station, it will be peculiarly im-  
proper to omit in this first official act my  
fervent supplications to that Almighty  
  
THE INAUGURATION OF THE FIRST PRESIDENT.  
  
Being who rules over the universe, who pre-  
sides in the councils of nations, and whose  
providential aids can supply every human  
defect, that His benediction may consecrate  
to the liberties and happiness of the people  
of the United States, a government insti-  
tuted by themselves for these essential pur-  
poses, and may enable every instrument  
employed in its administration, to execute  
with success the function allotted to its  
charge. In tendering this homage to the  
great Author of every public and private  
good, I assure myself that it expresses your  
sentiments not less than my own, nor those  
of my fellow-citizens at large less than  
either. No people can be bound to acknow!l-  
edge and adore the invisible hand which  
conducts the affairs of men more than the  
people of the United States. Every step by  
which they have advanced to the character  
of an independent nation seems to have  
been distinguished by some token of provi-  
dential agency. And the important revo-  
lution just accomplished in the system of  
their united government, the tranquil delib-  
erations and voluntary consent of so many  
distinct communities, from which the event  
has resulted, cannot be compared with the  
means by which most governments have  
been established, without some return of  
pious gratitude, along with an humble anti-  
cipation of the future blessings which the  
past seems to presage. These reflections,  
arising out of the present crisis, have forced  
themselves too strongly on my mind to be  
suppressed. You will join with me, I trust,  
in thinking that there are none under the  
influence of which the proceedings of a new  
and free government can more auspiciously  
commence. By the article establishing the  
Executive Department, it is made the duty  
of the President to recommend to your con-  
sideration such measures as he shall judge  
necessary and expedient. Thecircumstances  
under which I now meet you will acquit me  
from entering into the subject, further than  
to refer to the great constitutional charter  
under which you are assembled, and which,  
in defining your powers, designates the ob-  
jects to which your attention is to be given.  
It will be more than consistent with these  
circumstances and far more congenial with  
the feelings which actuate me, to substitute  
in place of a recommendation of particular  
measures, the tribute that is due to the

THE INAUGURATION OF THE FIRST PRESIDENT.  
  
talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism  
which adorn the characters selected to de-  
vise and adopt them. In these honorable  
qualifications I behold the surest pledges  
that as, on one side no local prejudices or  
attachments, no separate views nor party  
animosities, will misdirect a comprehen-  
sive and equal eye which ought to watch  
over this great assemblage of communities  
and interests ; so on another, that the foun-  
dations of our national policy will be laid in  
the pure and immutable principles of private  
morality, and the pre-eminence of free gov-  
ernment be exemplified by all the attributes  
which can win the affections of its citizens  
and command the respect of the world. I  
dwell on this prospect with every satisfac-  
tion which an ardent love for my country  
can inspire. Since there is no truth more  
thoroughly established than that there exists  
in the economy and course of nature an  
indissoluble union between virtue and hap-  
piness ; between duty and advantage; be-  
tween the genuine maxims of an honest and  
magnanimous policy, and the solid rewards  
of public prosperity and felicity ; since we  
ought to be no less persuaded that the pro-  
pitious smiles of Heaven can never be ex-  
pected on a nation that disregards the eternal  
rule of order and right, which Heaven itself  
has ordained ; and since the preservation of  
the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of  
the republican model of government, are  
justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally  
staked on the experiment entrusted to the  
hands of the American people. Besides  
the ordinary objects submitted to your care,  
it will remain with your judgment to de-  
cide how far an exercise of the occasional  
power delegated by the fifth article of the  
Constitution, is rendered expedient at the  
present juncture by the nature of objections  
which have been urged against the system,  
or by the degree of inquietude which has  
given birth to them. Instead of undertaking  
particular recommendations on this subject,  
in which I would be guided by no lights  
derived from official opportunities, I shall  
again give way to my entire confidence in  
your discernment and pursuit of the public  
good. For I assure myself that whilst you  
carefully avoid every alteration which might  
endanger the benefits of a united and effect-  
ive government, or which ought to await  
the future lessons of experience ; a reverence  
  
543  
  
for the characteristic rights of freemen, and  
a regard for the public harmony, will suffi-  
ciently influence your deliberations on the  
question, how far the former can be more  
impregnably fortified, or the latter be safely  
and advantageously promoted. To the pre-  
ceding observations I have one to add, which  
will be most properly addressed to the House  
of Representatives. It concerns myself, and  
will, therefore, be as brief as possible. When  
I was first honored with a call into the ser-  
vice of my country, then on the eve of an  
arduous struggle for its liberties, the light  
in which I contemplated my duty required  
that I should renounce every pecuniary  
compensation. From this resolution I have  
in no instance departed. And being still  
under the impressions which produced it, I  
must decline as inapplicable to myself any  
share in the personal emoluments which  
may be indispensably included in a perma-  
nent provision for the Executive Depart-  
ment, and must accordingly pray that the  
pecuniary estimates for the station in which  
I am placed may, during my continuance in  
it, be limited to such actual expenditures ‘as  
the public good may be thought to require.  
Having thus imparted to you my sentiments  
as they have been awakened by the occasion  
which brings us together, I shall take my  
present leave, but not without resorting once  
more to the benign Parent of the human race  
in humble supplication—that since he has  
been pleased to favor the American people  
with opportunities for deliberating in perfect  
tranquillity and dispositions for deciding  
with unparalleled unanimity on a form of  
government, for the security of their union  
and the advancement of their happiness, so  
His divine blessings may be equally conspic-  
uous in the enlarged views, the temperate  
consultations, and the wise measures on  
which the success of this Government must  
depend.”’

Every step by which they have advanced to the  
character of an independent nation seems to  
have been distinguished by some token of  
providential agency. And the important  
revolution Just accomplished in the system |  
of their united government, the tranquil de- &#x27;  
liberations and voluntary consent of so many J  
distinct communities, from which the event |  
has resulted, cannot be compared with the  
means by which mo?t governments have been  
established, without some return of pious |  
gratitude, along with an humble anticipation  
of the future blessings which the past seems to  
presago. These reflection*, arising out of the

there are none nnder the influence of which  
the proceedings of a new and free government

cle establishing the executive department, it is  
made the duty of the President to recommend  
to vour consideration such measures as hi&#x27; shall  
judge necessary and expedient. The circum­

a recommendation of particular measures, the  
tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude,  
and the patriotism which adorn the characters  
selected to devise and adopt them. In these hon­  
orable qualifications I behold the surest pledges  
that as, on one side no local prejudices or at- j  
tachineiits.no separate views nor party ani- I  
inositi?&#x27;s. will misdirect a comprehensive and  
equal eye which ought to watch over this  
great assemblage of communities and interests;  
so on another, that the foundations of our na­

pr -eminence of free government be exempli- j  
tied bv all the attributes which can win the af- &#x27;  
fections of its citizens and command tho re­

with every satisfaction which nn ardent love

to tie no less persuaded that the propitious  
smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a  
nation that disregards the eternal rule of I  
order and right, which Heaven itself |  
has ordained, and since the preservation of  
the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of  
the republican model of government, are  
justly considered as deeply, perhaps as linally

hands of the American people. Besides the  
ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will  
remain with your judgment to decide how far  
an exercise of the occasional power delegated  
by the fifth article of the Constitution, is rend­  
ered expedient at the present juncture by the  
nature of objections which have been urged  
Htrainst the system, or by the degree of inquie­  
tude which has given birth to them. Instead  
of undertaking particular recommendations on  
t is subject, in which I would be guided by no  
lights derived from official opportunities, I  
shall again give way to my entire confidence in  
your discernment and pursuit of the public  
? jiiiii

carefully avoid every alteration which might  
endanger the benefits of a united and effective  
government, or which ought to await the future  
lessons of experience: a reverence for the  
characteristic rights of freemen, and a regard  
for the public harmony, will sufficiently in­  
fluence your deliberations on the question, how  
far the former can be more impregnably forti­  
fied, or the latter be safely and advantageously  
promoted. To the preceding observations I  
have one to add, which will be most properly  
addressed to the House of Representative*. It  
concerns myself, and will, therefore, be as  
brief as possible. When I was first honored  
with a call into .the service of my  
country, then on the eve of an arduous  
struggle (or its liberties, the light in  
whicn I contemplated my duty required  
that I should renounce every pecuniary com­  
pensation. From this resolution I have in no  
instance departed. And being still under the  
impressions which produced it I must decline  
as inapplicable to mvself any share in the per­  
sonal emolument* which may be indispensably  
included in a permanent provision for the ex­  
ecutive department, and must accordingly  
pray*that the pecuniary estimates for the sta­  
tion in which I am placed may, during my con­  
tinuance in it, be limited to such actual ex­  
penditures as the public good may be thought to  
require. Having thus imparted to you my |  
sentiments as they have been awakened by the  
occasion which brings us together, I shall take  
my present leave, but not without resorting

Fellow citizens of the Senate and the House

incident to iife,no event could have filled  
me with greater anxiety than that of which  
the notification was transmitted by your or  
der I reoeived on the fourteenth day of the  
present montn. un tne other hand, 1 was  
summoned by my country, whose &#x27; voice I  
can never hear but with veneration and  
love from a retreat which I had chosen with  
the proudest predileotion, and in very flat  
tering hones, with an inimitable decision, as  
the asylum of my declining years; a retreat  
which was rendered every day more necessa  
ry as well as more clear to me, by the addi  
tion of habit to indication, and of frequent  
interruptions in wealth, to the gradual waste  
committed on it by time. On the other  
band, the magnitude and difficulty of the  
trust to which my country called  
me, being sufficient to awaken in  
the wisest and most experienced  
of her citizens, a distrustful scrutiny into his  
qualifications, could not but overwhelm with  
despondency, one, who, inheriting inferior  
endowments from nature, and unpracticed  
in the duties of civil administration, right to  
, be peculiarly conscious of his own dencien  
cies. a- m conflict of emotions, all I dare  
aver is, that it ha wa my faithful study to  
colleot my duty from a j aDpreoiation of  
every circumstance, by which ft xjzht be  
aneotea. aii i aare nope is that, if in tua

swayed by a grateful remembrance of former  
instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to

&quot;Among the vicissitudes incident to  
life, no event could have filled me with  
greater anxieties than that of which the  
notification was transmitted by your  
order, and received on the 14th day of  
the present month. On the one hand, I  
was summoned by my country, whose  
voice I can never hear but with venera­  
tion and love, from a retreat which I had  
chosen with the fondest predilection,  
and, in my flattering hopes, with an im­  
mutable decision, as the asylum of my  
declining years; a retreat, which was  
rendered every day more necessary, as  
well as more dear to me, by the addition  
of habit to inclination, and by frequent  
interruptions in my health to the gradual  
waste committed on it by time. Un the  
other hand, the magnitude and difficulty  
of the trust to which the voice of my  
country called me, being sufficient to  
waken in the wisest and most experi­  
enced of her citizens a distasteful ecru­  
tiny into his qualifications, could not but  
overwhelm with despondency one who,  
inheriting inferior endowments from  
nature and unpracticed ia the duties cf  
civil administration, ought to be pecu­  
liarly conscious of his own deficiencies.  
In this conflict of emotions, all I dare  
aver is that it has been my faithful study  
to collect my duty from a just apprecia­  
tion of every circumstance by wnich it  
might be affected. All I dare hope is  
that if in executing this task I have been  
too much swayed by a grateful remem­  
brance of former instances or by an  
affectionate sensibility to this transcend­  
ent proof of the confidence of my fellow­  
citizens, and have thence too little con­  
sulted my incapacity as well as disincli­  
nation for the weighty and untried cares  
before me, my error will be palliated by  
t ie motives which misled me, and its  
consequences be judged by my country  
with some share of the partiality in  
which they originated. Such being the  
impressions under which I have, in  
obedience to the public summons, re­  
paired to the present station, it would be  
peculiarly improper to omit, in this first  
official act, my lervent supplications to  
that Almighty Being who rules over the  
universe, who presides in the councils  
of nations, and whose providential  
aids can supply every human de­  
fect, that his benediction may  
consecrate to the liberties and the happi­  
ness of the people of the United States,  
a Government instituted by themselves  
for these essential purposes, and may en­  
able every instrument employed in its  
administration to execute with success  
the functions allotted to his charge. In  
tendering this homage to the great Au­  
thor of every public and private good, I  
assure myself that it expresses your sen­  
timents not less ttian my own; nor those  
of my fellow-citizens at large less than  
neither. No people can be bound to ac­  
knowledge and adore the invisible hand  
which conduits the affairs of men more  
than the people of the United States.  
Every step by which they have ad­  
vanced to the character of an indepen­  
dent nation seems to have been dis­  
tinguished by tone token of providen­  
tial agency. And, in the important rev­  
olution just accomplished, in the system  
of their united Government, and the  
tranquil deliberations and voluntary  
consent of so many distinct communities  
from which the event has resulted, can­  
not be compared with the means by  
which most Governments have been es­  
tablished, without some return ;of pious  
grut&#x27;.tude, along with an humble antici­  
pation of the future blessings which the  
patt seem to presage. Thege refl ctions,  
arising out of the present crisis, have  
forced them-elves too strongly on my  
mind to be suppressed. You will join  
with me, 1 trust, in thinking that there  
are none, unaer tbe influence of which  
tbe proceedings of a new and free Gov­  
ernment can more auspiciously com­  
mence.  
  
&quot;By the article establishing the Exec­  
utive Department it is made the duty of  
the President &#x27;to recommend to your con­  
sideration such measures as he ehall  
judge necessary and expedient.&#x27; The  
circumstances under which I now meet  
you will acquit me from entering into  
that subject further than to refer you to  
the great constitutional charter under  
which we are assembled; and which, in  
denning your powers, designates the ob­  
jects to which your attention is to be  
given. It will be more consistent with  
these circumstances and far more con­  
genial with the feelings which actuate  
me, to substitute in place of a recommen­  
dation of particular measures, the tribute  
tbat is due to the talents, the rectitude  
and the patriotism which adorn the  
characters selected to devise and adopt  
them. In these honorable qualifications  
I behold the surest pledges that, oo one  
side, no local prejudices or attachments,  
no separate views or party animosities,  
will misdirect the comprehensive and  
equal eye which ought to watch over this  
great assemblage of communities and in­  
terests ; so, on another, that the founda­  
tions of our national policy will be laid in  
the pore and immutable principles of pri­  
vate morality, and that the pre-eminence  
of a free government be exemplified by  
all the attributes which can win the affec­  
tions of its citizens and command the re­  
spect of the world.  
  
&quot;I dwell on this prospect with every sat­  
isfaction which an ardent love for my  
conntry can inspire; since there is no  
truth more thoroughly established than  
ihat there exists in the economy and  
course of natuie au indissoluble union  
between virtue and happiness, between  
duty and advantage, between the genuine  
maxims of an honest and magnanimous  
policy, and the solid rewards of public  
prosperity and felicity; since we ought to  
oe no less parsuaded that the propititious  
smiles of heaven can never be expected  
on a nation that disregards the ecernal  
rules of order and right which heaven  
itself has ordained; and since the preser­  
vation of the sacred fire of liberty, and  
the destiny of the Republican model of  
government, ars justly considered as  
deeply, perhaps as finally, staked on the  
experiment intrusted to the hands of the  
American people.  
&quot;Besides the ordinary objects sub­  
mitted to your care, it will remain with  
your judgment to decide hew far an ex­  
ercise of the occasional power delegated  
  
by the fifth article of the Constitution iB  
rendered expedient at the present junc­  
ture by the nature of objections which  
have been urged against the system, or  
by the degree of inquietude which has  
given birth to them. Instead of under­  
taking particular recommendations on  
this subject, in which 1 could be guided  
by no lights derived from official oppor­  
tunities, I shall again give way to my en­  
tire confidence in your discernment and  
pursuit of the public good; for I assure  
myself that whilst you carefully avoid  
every alteration which might endanger  
the benefits of a united and effective  
government, or which ought to await  
the future lessons of experience; a  
revenue for the characteristic rights of  
free men and a regard for the public  
harmony, will sufficiently influence your  
deliberations on tbe question, how far  
the former can be more impregnably  
fortified, or the latter be safely and ad­  
vantageously promoted.  
&quot;To the preceding observations I have  
one to add, which will be moat properly  
addressed to tbe House of Representa  
tives. It concerns myself and will there­  
fore be as brief as possible. When I was  
first honored with a call into the service  
of my country, then on the eve of an  
arduous struggle for its liberties, the light  
in which I contemplated my duty re­  
quired that I should renounce every pri­  
mary compensation. From this resolu­  
tion I have in no instance departed. And  
  
being still nnder the impressions which  
produced it, I must decline as inapplica­  
ble to myself any share in tbe personal  
emoluments which may be indispensably  
included in a permanent provision for  
tbe executive department, and must ac­  
cordingly pray that the pecuniary esti­  
mates for the station in which I am  
placed may, during my continuance in  
it, be limited to such actual expenditures  
as tbe public good may be thought to re­  
quire.  
&quot;Having thus imparted to you my  
sentimenta as they have been awakened  
by tbe occasion which brings us to­  
gether, I shall take my present leave,  
but not without resorting once more to  
the Benign Parent of the hnman race in  
humble supplication, that since He has  
been pleased to favor the American people  
with opportunities for deliberating in  
perfect tranquility and dispositions for  
deciding with unparalleled unanimity on  
a form of government for the security of  
their union and the advancement of their  
happiness, so His divine blessing may be  
equally conspicuous in the enlarged  
views, the temperate consultations and  
the wise measures on which the success  
of this Government must depend.&quot;

rendered more necessary as well as more  
dear to me by the addition of habit, of  
inclination, aud of frequent interrup­  
tions in health, to the gradual waste com­  
mitted on it by time. On the otbor hand,  
the magnitude and dililculty of  
trust to which my country called  
mu, lining sufficient to awaken in the  
wisest aud most experienced of ourclti­  
nous a distrustful scrutiny In its qunlill­

with dosnondoncy who, inheriting in­  
ferior endowments from nature anil un­

, been my faithful study to colloct my  
duty from a just appreciation of every  
circumstance by which it might be ef­  
fected. All I dare hope is, that if, in  
executing this task, I have been too  
much swayod by a careful remembrance  
of former instances or by an affectionate  
sensibility to this transcendent proof of  
thu confidence of my filial citizens, 1  
have thence too littlo concealed my in­

held me, and its consequences be judged  
by my country with some share of par­

From this resolution 1 have in no in­

THE CONSTITUTION AS A GUIDE  
By the article establishing the Executive  
D&lt;pirtment it is made the duty of the  
President ‘‘to recommend to your consid  
&#x27;.■ration snch measures as he shall judge  
nece8Qary and expedient.” The circum­  
stances under which I now meet yon will  
acquit me from entering into that snbject  
inrther than to reler to the great constitu­  
tional charter nnder which yon are assem­  
bled, and which, ir defioing your powers,  
designates the objects to which yonr atten­  
tion is given. It will be more consistent  
with those circumstances, and far more  
congenial with the feelings which actuate  
me, to snb;titute in place of a recommen­  
dation of paiticnlar miasnrss the tribute  
that is due to the talents, the rectitude  
and the patriotism which adorn the char­  
acters selected to devise aud adopt them.  
In these honorable qualifications I behold  
the surest pledges, that, as on one side no  
local prejudices or attachments, no separate  
views, no perty amines ties, will misdirect  
the coinprehen.-ive and iqual eye which  
onght to watch over this great assemblage ot

and the pre-eminence of tree government

can win the affections of its citizens and

dwell on this prospect with every satis­  
faction which an ardent love for my conn­

more thoroughly established than that  
there exists in the economy and course of

Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House  
  
of Representatives: Among the vicissi-  
  
tudes incident to life, no event could  
have filled me with greater anxieties  
than that of which the notification was  
transmitted by your order and received  
on the 14th day of the present month.  
On the one hand, I was summoned by  
my country, whose voice I can never  
hear but with veneration and love,  
from a retreat which I had chosen with  
the fondest predilection, and in my  
flattering hopes with an immutable  
decision as the asylum of my declinin  
years; a retreat which was rende  
every day more necesssary, as well as  
more dear to me, by the addition of  
habit to inclination, and by frequent  
ifterruptions in my health to the  
gradual waste committed on it  
time. On the other hand, the magni-  
tude and difficulty of the trust to  
which the voice of my country  
called me, being sufficient to waken  
in the wisest and most experienced  
of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny  
into his qualifications, could not but  
overwhelm with despondency one who,  
inheriting inferior endowments from  
nature and unpracticed in the duties  
of civil administration, ought te be  
uliarly conscious of his own de-  
ciencies. In this conflict of emo-  
tions, all 1 dare aver is that it  
has been my faithfulstudy to collect my  
duty from a just.appreciation of oe  
circumstance by which it might be af-  
fected. All I dare hope is that if in  
executing this task I have been too  
  
much swayed by a grateful remem- -  
  
brance of former instances or by an  
affectionate sensibility to this trans-  
cendent proof of the confidence of my  
fellow-citizens, and have thence too  
little consulted my incapacity as well  
as disinclination for the weighty and  
untried cares before me, my error will  
be palliated by the motives which mis.  
led me, and ite consequences be judged  
by my country with some share of the  
pany in which they origmated.  
uch being the impressions under  
which I bave in obedience to the  
public summons repaired to the present  
station, it would be pecvliarly  
to omit, in this first official act, my fer-  
vent supplications to that Almighty  
Being who rules over the universe, who  
presides in the council of nations, and  
whose providential aids can supply  
  
every human defect, that His ben  
  
tion may consecrate to the liberties and  
the happiness of the people of the  
United States, a government instituted  
by themselves for these essential pur-  
poses, and may enable every instru-  
ment employed in its administration to  
execute with success the functions al-  
lotted to his charge. In tendering this  
to the great Author of every  
public and private good, I assure my-  
self that it expresses your sentiments  
not less than my own; nor those of my  
fellow-citizens at large less than  
neither. No people can be bound to  
. and adore the invisible  
hand which conducts the affairs of men  
more than the people of the United  
States. Every step by which they have  
advanced to the character of an inde-  
ndent nation seems to have been dis-  
tinguished by some token of providen-  
tial agency. And, in the important

lows;  
&#x27;Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House  
of Represents tires:  
&quot;Among the vicissitudes incident to life,  
no event could have filled me with greater  
anxieties than that of which the notification  
was transmitted by your order, and received  
on the 14th day of the present month. On  
the one hand, I was summoned by my coun­  
try, whose voice I can never hear bnt with  
veneration and love, from a retreat which I  
had chosen with the fondest predilection,  
and, in my flattering hopes, with an im­  
mutable decision as the asylum, of my de­  
clining years a retreat which was rendered  
every day more necessary, as well as more  
dear to me, by the addition of habit to in­  
clination, and of frequent interruptions in  
my health to the gradual waste committed  
on it by time.  
&quot;On the other hand, the magnitude and  
difficulty of the trust to which tbe voice of  
my country called me, being sufficient to  
awaken in the wisest and most experienced  
of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his  
qualifications, could not bnt overwhelm with  
despondence one who, inheriting inferior  
endowments from nature, and unpracticed  
in the duties of civil administration, ought  
to be peculiarly conscious of his own de­  
ficiences. In this conflict of emotions, all I  
dare aver is that it has been my faithful  
study to collect my duty from a just appre­  
ciation of every circumstance by which it  
might be affected. All I dare hope is, that  
if in accepting this task, I have been too  
much swayed by a remembrance of former  
instances, or by an affectionate sensibility  
to this transcendent proof of the confidence  
of my fellow-citizens, and have thence too  
little consulted my incapacity as well as  
disinclination for the  
WEIGHTY AND UNTRIED  
cares before me, my error will he palliated  
by the motives which misled me, and its  
consequences be judged by my country with  
some share of the partiality in which they  
originated. Such being the impressions  
Washington&#x27; Residence lifter Inauguration.  
nnder which I have in obedience to the  
fjublic summons repaired to he present sta­  
tion, it will be peculiarly improper to omit  
in this first official act my fervent supplica­  
tions to that Almighty Being who rules  
over the universe, who presides in the coun­  
cils of nations, and whose providential aids  
can supply every human defect, that HU  
benediction may consecrate to tbe liberties  
and happiness of the people of the United

and may enable every instrument

homage to the great author of every public

expresses your sentiments not less than&#x27;my  
own, Jior those of my fellow citizens at large  
less than either. No people can be bound  
to acknowledge and adore the invisible  
hand which conducts the affairs of men  
more than the people of the United States.  
Every step by which they have advanced to  
tbe character of an independent nation  
seems to have been distinguished b&#x27;y some  
token of providential agency. And the  
important revolution just accomplished in  
the system of their united government, the  
tranquil deliberations and voluntary con­  
sent ot so many distinct communities, from  
which the event has resulted cannot be  
compared with the means by which most  
governments have been established, without  
some return of pleas gratitude, along with  
as hjuaW aa4lftte of Mm Meet

ings which the past seems io presage. .Thes J  
reflections, arising out of the present ctIsm, 1  
have forced themselves too strongly on asT.;  
mind to be suppressed. You will join with, j  
  
me, x trust, in tninsung ma mere re uuw :  
under the influence of which the proceed­  
ings of a new and free Government caa bom  
auspiciously commence. . , j  
&quot;By an article establishing the execatrrw ;  
department, it is made the duty ot th :  
President to recommend to your considera­  
tion such measures as he shall Judge neces­  
sarv and exnedient The circumstance &#x27;  
under which I now meet you will acquit  
me from entering into the subject further  
than to refer to the great  
CONSTITUTIONAIi CHABTEB  
under which you are assembled, and which) J  
in defining your powrs, designates the oh-&#x27; i  
jects to which your attention is to oe gtvea.  
It will be more than consistent with thes  
circumstances, and far more congenial with  
the feelings which actuate me, to substi­  
tute in place of a recommendation of par  
ticular measures, the tribute that is due t  
talent3, tbe rectitude and the patriotism  
which adorn the characters selected to  
devise and adopt them. In these honorable  
qualifications I behold the surestpledge  
that as,on one side no local prejudices or at­  
tachments, no separate views or party ani­  
mosities, will misdirect a comprehensive  
and equal eye which ought to watch over  
this great assemblage of communities and  
interests; so on another, that the founda­  
tions of our national policy will be laid in  
the pure and immutable principles of pri­  
vate.morality, and the pre-eminence of free  
tcovernment be exemplified bv all the attri  
butes which can win the affections of it r  
citizens ana command tne respect oi u  
world.  
&quot;I dwell on this prospect with every satis­  
faction which an ardent love for my coun­  
try can inspire. Since there is no truth  
more thoroughly established than that  
there exists in the economy and course of  
nature and dissoluble union between virtue  
and happiness; between dnty and advant­  
age; between the genuine maxims of an  
honest and magnanimous policy and the  
solid rewards of public prosperity and felici­  
ty; since we onght to be no less persuaded  
that tbe propitious smiles of Heaven caa  
never be expected on a nation that disre­  
gards the eternal rale of order and right  
which Heaven itself has ordained, and  
since the preservation of the  
SACKED riEE OF LTJJESTT,  
and the destiny of the republican model of  
government, are justly considered as deeply,  
perhaps as finally staked on the experiment  
entrusted to the hands of the American peo­  
ple. Besides the ordinary objects submit­  
ted to your care, if will remain with your  
judgment to decide how far an exercise of  
the occasional power delegated by the fifth  
article of the Constitution, is rendered ex­  
pedient at the present juncture by the na­  
ture pf objections whicb have been urged  
against the system, or by the degree of in­  
quietude which has given birth to them. In­  
stead of undertaEing particular recommen­  
dations on this subject, in which I would be  
guided by no lights derived from official op­  
portunities, I shall again giVe way to my  
entire confidence in onr discernment,  
and nnvenit f tTiA nnrilin ffruul

The Old Washington Hotel.  
For I assure myself that whilst voa.  
carefully avoid every alteration which  
might endanger the benefits of a united and,  
effective government or which ought to  
await the fnture lessons of experience, a  
reverence for the characteristic rights of  
freemen and a regard for the public har­  
mony will sufficiently influence your delib­  
erations on the question how far the former  
can be more impregnably fortified or the  
latter be safelv and aldvantageously pro  
moted. To the preceding observations&quot;!  
have one to add, which will be most, prop­  
erly addressed to the House of Bepresepta-J  
uves. t concerns myseji, auu iu, mere­  
fore, be as brief as possible.  
&quot;When I was first honored with a call  
into the service of my country, then on the  
eve of an arduous struggle lor its liberties,  
the light in which I contemplated my dnty  
required that I should renounce every pecu­  
niary compensation. From this resolution  
I have in no instance departed.  
And being still under the impres­  
sions which produced it I must decline at  
inapplicable to myself any share in the per­  
sonal emoluments which maybe indispensa­  
bly included in a permanent provision for  
the Executive Department, and must ac­  
cordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates  
for the station in which I am placed may,  
during my continuance in it be limited to  
such actual expenditures as the public good  
may be thought to require. Having thus  
imparted to you my sentiments a3 they have  
been awakened by the occasion which brings  
us together, I shall take my present leave,  
butnoi without resortintr once more to the  
benign Parent of the human race in humble ,i  
supplication that since He nas been pleasea,  
to favor the American people with oppor- &quot;

advancement of their happiness, so Hissi

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of  
the House of Representatives:—Among  
the vicissitudes incident to life, no  
event could have filled me with greater  
anxieties than that of which the notifi­  
cation was transmitted by your order  
and received on the 14th day of the  
present mouth. On the one hand I  
was summoned by my country, whose  
voice I can never hear bat with vener­  
ation and love, from a retreat which I  
had chosen with the fondest predilec­  
tion, and in my flattering hopes, with  
an immutable decision, as the asylum  
of my declining years; a retreat which  
was rendered every day more neces­  
sary, as well as mere dear to nie, by  
the addition of habit to inclination,  
and of frequent interruptions in my  
health to the gradual waste committed  
on it by time. On the other hand,  
the magnitude and difficulty of the  
trust to which the voice of my country  
called me, being sufficient to waken in  
the wisest and most experienced of  
her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into  
hie own qualifications, could not but  
overwhelm with despondence, one,  
who, inheriting inferior endowments  
from nature, and unpracticed in the  
duties of civil administration, ought  
to be peculiarly conscious of his own  
deficiences. In this conflict of  
emotions all I dare aver is that it has  
been my faithfu) study to collect ray  
duty from a just appreciation of every  
circumstance by whioh it might be  
affected. All I dare hope, is that if, in  
executing this task, I have been too  
much swayed by a greatful remem­  
brance of former instances, or by an  
affectionate sensibility to this trans­  
cendent proof of the confidence of my  
fellow-oitizens, and have thence too  
little consulted my incapacity as well  
as disinclination for the weighty and  
untried cares before me, my error will  
be palliated by the motives which  
misled me, and its consequence* be  
judged by my country with some  
share of the partiality in which they  
originated.  
Mark well the language of the man.

A Question.  
Mr. Editor: Was George Washington a  
fool, a crank or crazy ? Let politicians of the  
present day read the following extract from  
his inaugural address-then conscientiously  
answer :  
To the preceeding observations I have one  
to add, which will he most properly address?

cerns myself, and will therefore be as brief ai  
possible. When I was first honored with a  
call into the service of my country, then on  
the eve of an arduous struggle for its liber?  
ties, the light in which I contemplated my  
duty required that I should renounce every  
pecuniary compensation. From this resolu?  
tion I have in no instance departed ; and  
being still under the impressions which pro?  
duced it, I must decline, as inapplicable to  
myself, any share in the personal emoluments  
which may be indispensably included in a  
permanent provision for the executive de?  
partment, and must accordingly pray that  
the pecuniary estimates for the station in  
which 1 am placed, may, during my contin?

The Bible teaches that national virtue is indispensable to na-  
tional prosperity. Its revelation declares that “righteousness  
exalteth a nation.” To this fact Washington testified as fol-  
lows: “There is no truth more thoroughly established, than that  
there exists, in the economy and course of nature, an indissolu-  
ble union between virtue and happiness ; between duty and ad-  
vantage, between the genuine maxims of an honest and mag-  
naminous policy, and the solid rewards of public prosperity and  
felicity.”  
  
The sacred Scriptures teach that national sins are the certain  
precursors of national judgments and ruin. Nations are held  
responsible to God for their conduct ; hence, if they violate their  
obligations to him by their crimes, he must, as a righteous God,  
visit them with his chastisements in this world, as he does not  
deal with them as nations in the world to come; and if they re-  
fuse to repent of their sins, he will eventually destroy them

“The foundations of our national policy  
will be laid in the pure and immutable  
principles of private morality, and the pre-  
eminence of a free government be exem-  
plified by all the attributes which can win  
the affections of its citizens and command  
the respect of the world. I dwell on this  
prospect with every satisfaction which an  
ardent love for my country can inspire;  
since there is no truth more thoroughly  
established than that there exists in the  
economy and course of nature an indis-  
soluble union between virtue and happi-  
ness, between honor and advantage, be-  
tween the genuine maxims of an honest  
and magnanimous policy and the solid  
rewards “of public prosperity and felicity;  
since we ought to be no less persuaded  
that the propitious smiles of Heaven can  
never be expected on a nation that disre-  
gards the eternal rules of order and right,  
which Heaven itself has ordained; and  
since the preservation of the sacred fire of  
  
liberty and the destiny of the republican  
model of government are justly considered  
as deeply, perhaps as finally, staked on the  
experiment intrusted to the hands of the  
American people.”

inaugural address he says, &quot;No people  
can be bound to acknowledge and adore  
the invisible Hand which conducts the  
affairs of men. more than the people of  
the United States. Every step, by  
which they have advanced to the char­  
acter of an independent nation, seems  
to have been distinguished by some  
token of providential agency.&quot;
