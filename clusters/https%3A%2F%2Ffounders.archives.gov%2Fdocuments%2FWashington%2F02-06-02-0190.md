gligence tis said of the Captain.  
My Brother is safe arrivd but little benifitted in point of Health by his Trip to England. The longing desire, which for many years I have had of visiting the great Matrapolis of that Kingdom is not in the least abated by his prejudices because I think the Small share of Health he enjoyd while there must have given a Sensible Check to any pleasures he might figure to himself, and woud render any place Irksome—but, I am now tied by the Leg and must set Inclination aside.  
  
The Scale of Fortune in America is turnd greatly in our favour, and Success is become the boon Companion of our Fortunate Generals—Twoud be folly in me to attempt particularising their Actions since you receive Accts in a Channel so much more direct than from hence.  
I am now I beleive fixd at this Seat with an agreable Consort for Life and hope to find more happiness in retirement than I ever experiencd amidst a wide and bustling World—I thank you heartily for your Affectionate Wishes—Why wont you give me an occasion of congratulating you in the same manner?

He nientions in the same letter ‘the longing de-  
sire which for many years I have had of visiting  
the great metropolis of England.” ‘But,’ he  
adds, ‘I am now tied, and must set inclination  
aside.’ It is remarkable that his letters at that  
time, and until the colonial storm had burst, fre-  
quently use the word ‘home’ to designate the  
mother country.
