it now Stands, I beg you, to consider—it is almost impossible that a President Should ever have the Courage to make Use of his partial negative. what a Situation would a President be in, to maintain a  
  
Controversy against a Majority of both Houses, before the Tribunal of the Public. To put a stop to a Law, that more than half the Senate and House, and consequently We may Suppose more than half the Nation, had set their hearts upon.? it is moreover possible, that more than two thirds of the Nation, the Senate and House, may in times of Calamity Distress, Misfortune and ill success of the Measures of Government from the momentary Passion and Enthusiasm, demand a Law which will wholly Subvert the Constitution. The Constitution of Athens was overturned in such a moment by Aristides himself.— The Constitution Should guard against a Possibility of its Subversion.— But We may take Stronger ground and assert that it is probable, that Such Cases will happen and that the Consitution will in fact be Subverted, in this Way.— Nay I go farther and Say, that from the constitution of human nature and the constant Course of human Affairs it is certain, that our Constitution will be Subverted, if not amended, and that in a very Short time, merely for Want of a decisive negative in the Executive.  
There is another Sense, and another Degree, in which the Executive is blended with the legislatur

3. It has a natural Tendency, to excite Ambition in the Senate,— An active, ardent Spirit, in that House, who is rich, &amp; able; has a great Reputation and influence,; will be solicited by Candidates for Office. not to introduce the Idea of Bribery, because, tho it certainly would force itself in, in other Countries, and will, probably, here when We grow populous and rich, yet it is not yet, I hope to be dreaded.— But Ambition must come in, already.— A Senator of great Influence, will be naturally ambitious and desirous of increasing his Influence. Will he not be under a Temptation to Use his Influence with the President as well as his Brother Senators, to appoint Persons to Office in the several states who will exert themselves in Elections to get out his Ennemies or Opposers both in senate and House of Representatives, and to get in his Friends, perhaps his Instruments.? Suppose a Senator, to aim at the Treasury Office, for himself, his Brother, Father, or son—suppose him to aim at the President’s Chair, or Vice Presidents, at the next Election—or at the Office of War, foreign or domestic affairs, will he not naturally be tempted to make Use of his whole Patronage his whole Influence, in Advising to appointments, both with President and senators to get such Persons nominated, as will exert themselves for Elections of President Vice President, senators and H. of Representatives to increase his Interest and promote his Views.— in this Point of View I am very apprehensive that this defect in our Constitution will have an unhappy Tendency to introduce Corruption of the grossest Kinds both of Ambition and Avarice into all our Elections.

eration a correspondence took place be­  
tween John Adams and Roger Sher­  
man. Mr. Adams did not think the  
Senate ought to have anything to do  
with appointments. He wrote a long  
and strong letter giving seven reasons  
against adopting the proposition that  
nominations should be sent to the Sen­  
ate for confirmation or rejection. He  
foresaw that the power of rejection  
would be misused by selfish and ambi­  
tious men to gain control over nomin­  
ations, and employ them as patronage  
to promote personal ends. Here is a  
portion of his letter which is closely  
applicable to the controversy now going  
on :

naturally ambitious and desirous of
