The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the House of Representatives, the representation from the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on the subjects of the Cod and Whale Fisheries, together with the several papers accompanying it, has had the same under consideration and thereupon makes the following Report.  
The representation sets forth that, before the late war, about 4,000 Seamen and 24,000 Tons of shipping were annually employed from that State in the Whale Fishery, the produce whereof was about £350,000 lawful money a year.  
That, previous to the same period, the Cod Fishery of that  State employed 4000 men and 28,000 Ton of Shipping and produced about £250,000 a year.  
That these branches of business, annihilated during the war, have been in some degree recovered since: but that they labour under many and heavy embarrassments, which, if not removed, or lessened, will render the Fisheries every year less extensive and important.  
That these embarrassments are, heavy duties on their produce abroad, and bounties on that of their competitors: and duties at home on several articles particularly used in the Fisheries.  
And it asks that the duties be taken off, that bounties be given to the fishermen, and the national influence be used abroad for obtaining better markets for their produce.  
The Cod and Whale Fisheries, carried on by different persons, from different Ports, in different vessels, in different Seas, and seeking different markets, agree in one circumstance, in being as unprofitable to the adventurer, as important to the public. A succinct view of their rise, progress and present state with different nations, may enable us to note the circumstances which have attended their prosperity and their decline, to judge of the embarrassments which are said to oppress ours, to see whether they depend on our own will, and may therefore be remedied immediately by ourselves, or whether, depending on the will of others they are without the reach of remedy from us, either directly or indirectly.  
Their history being as unconnected as their practice, they shall be separately considered.  
Within 20 years after the supposed discovery of New-foundland by the Cabots, we find that the abundance of fish on it’s banks had already drawn the attention of the people of Europe. For as early

as 1517 or 1519. we are told of 50 ships being seen there at one time. The first adventurers in that fishery were the Biscayans of Spain, the Basques and Bas Bretons of France, all united anciently

in language and still in habits and in extreme poverty. The last circumstance enabled them long to retain a considerable share of the fishery. In 1577 the French had 150 vessels there, the Spaniards had still 100, and the Portuguese 50, when the English had only 15. The Spaniards and Portuguese seem at length to have retired silently, the French and English claiming the

fishery exclusively as an appurtenance to their adjacent Colonies, and the profits being too small for nations surcharged with the precious metals proceeding from their mines.  
  
Without materials to trace the intermediate progress, we only know

that so late as 1744 the French employed there 564 ships, and 27,500 seamen, and took 1,246,000 Kentals of fish, which was three times the extent to which England and her Colonies together carried this fishery at that time.

competitors, endeavoured to give them some advantage by prohibiting the importation of foreign fish: and, at the close of the century, they formed some regulations for their Government and

protection; and remitted to them some duties. A successful war

enabled them in 1713 to force from the French a cession of the Island of Newfoundland. Under these encouragements, the English and American fisheries began to thrive. In 1731 we find

the English take 200,000 Kentals of fish and the Americans 230,000 besides the refuse fish not fit for European markets. They continue to gain ground and the French to lose it, insomuch that

the French have only 259 vessels of 24,420 Tons, 9,722 seamen, taking 200,000 Kentals, while America alone for some three or four years before that, and so on to the commencement of

fish, and England a still greater quantity, 526,000 Kentals as is said.

the United States, the English and French, (for the last retained two small Islands merely for this object) the right of fishing was appropriated to them also.  
France, sensible of the necessity of balancing the power of England on the water, and therefore of improving every resource for raising seamen, and seeing that her fishermen could not maintain their competition without some public patronage, adopted the experiment of bounties on her own fish and duties on that of foreign nations brought into her markets. But notwithstanding  this her fisheries dwindle from a change taken place insensibly in the character of her navigation, which from being the most economical,  
  
1788. said by Grenville in parl.  
  
is now become the most expensive. In 1786 she is said to have employed but 7000 men in this fishery, and to have taken 426,000   
  
1788. said by Grenville in parl.  
  
Kentals; and in 1787 but 6000 men and 128,000 Kentals. She seems not yet sensible that the unthriftiness of her fisheries proceeds from the want of economy, and not the want of markets: and that the encouragement of our fishery abridges that of a rival nation whose power on the ocean has long threatened the loss of all balance on that element.  
The  
  
15. G. 3. c. 31; 18. G. 3. c. 55; 26. G. 3. c. 26.  
  
plan of the English Government since the peace has been to prohibit all foreign fish in their markets, and they have given from 18 to 50 pounds sterling on every fishing vessel complying with certain conditions. This policy is said to have been so far successful   
  
said by Pitt in parl. 1788.  
  
as to have raised the number of seamen employed in that business in 1786 to 14,000, and the quantity of fish taken to 732,000 Kentals. The Table No. 1. hereto annexed will present to the eye this history more in detail.  
The fisheries of the United States annihilated during the war, their vessels, utensils, and fishermen destroyed, their markets in the Mediterranean and British America lost, and their produce dutied in those of France, their competitors enabled by bounties to meet and undersell them at the few markets remaining open, without any public aid, and indeed paying aids to the public: Such were the hopeless auspices under which this important business was to be resumed. Yet it was resumed, and, aided by the more force of natural advantages, they employed during the years

And an official paper (No. 3) shews that in the last of those years our exportation amounted to 375,020 Kentals, and 30,461 barrels, deduction made of 3701 Kentals and 6343 barrels of foreign fish received and re-exported. See No. 4. Still however the calculations in No. 5. which accompany the representation shew, that the profits of the sales in the years 1787.8. were too small to afford a living to the fisherman, and on those of 1789 there was such a loss

as to withdraw 33 vessels of the Town of Marblehead alone from the further pursuit of this business: and the apprehension is that, without some public aid, those still remaining will continue to withdraw, and this whole commerce be engrossed by a single nation.  
  
This rapid view of the Cod-fishery enables us to discern under what policy it has flourished or declined in the hands of other nations, and to mark the fact that it is too poor a business to be left to itself, even with the nation the most advantageously situated.  
It will now be proper to count the advantages which aid, and the disadvantages which oppose us in this contest.  
Our advantages are  
  
1. The neighbourhood of the great Fisheries, which permits our fishermen to bring home their fish to be salted by their wives and children.  
2. The shore fisheries, so near at hand as to enable the vessels to run into port in a storm and so lessen the risk for which distant Nations must pay insurance.  
3. The winter fisheries, which like household manufactures, employ portions of time which would otherwise be useless.  
4. The smallness of the vessels, which the shortness of the voyage enables us to employ and which consequently require but a small capital.  
5. The cheapness of our vessels, which do not cost above the half of the Baltic fir vessels, computing price and duration.  
6. Their excellence as Sea-Boats which decreases the risk and quickens the returns.  
7. The superiority of our mariners in skill, activity, enterprise, sobriety and order.  
8. The cheapness of provisions.  
9. The cheapness of Casks, which of itself is said to be equal to an extra profit of 15 per cent.  
  
These advantages are of such force, that while experience has proved that no other nation can make a mercantile profit on the Newfoundland fishery, nor can support it without national aid, we can make a living profit, if vent for our fish can be procured.  
Of the disadvantages opposed to us, those which depend on ourselves are

Coarse woollens worn by the fishermen and the Poll tax levied by the State on their persons. The statement No. 6 shews the amount of these, exclusive of the State-tax and drawback on the fish exported to be 5.25 Dollars per man or 57.75 Dollars per vessel of 65. Tons. When a business is so nearly in equilibrio, that one can hardly discern whether the profit be sufficient to continue it, or not, smaller sums than these suffice to turn the scale against it. To these disadvantages add ineffectual duties on the importation of foreign fish. In justification of these last it is urged that the foreign fish received is in exchange for the produce of agriculture. To which it may be answered that the thing given is more merchantable than that received in exchange and that agriculture has too many markets to be allowed to take away those of the fisheries. It will rest therefore with the wisdom of the Legislature to decide whether prohibition should not be opposed to prohibition, and high duty to high duty, on the fish of other Nations: whether any and which of the naval and other duties may be remitted, or an equivalent given to the fisherman in the form of a drawback or bounty: and whether the loss of markets abroad may not in some degree be compensated by creating markets at home, to which might contribute the constituting fish a part of the military ration in stations not too distant from navigation, a part of the necessary sea-stores of vessels, and the encouraging private individuals to let the fisherman share with the cultivator in furnishing the supplies of the Table. A habit introduced from motives of patriotism would soon be followed from motives of taste: and who will undertake to fix limits to this demand, if it can be once excited, with a nation which doubles and will long continue to double at very short periods?  
Of the disadvantages which depend on others are  
  
1. The loss of the Mediterranean markets.  
2. Exclusions from the markets of some of our neighbours.  
3. High duties in those of others, and  
4. Bounties to the individuals in competition with us.  
  
The consideration of these will find its place more aptly after a review of the condition of our Whale fishery shall have led us to the same point. To this branch of the subject therefore we will now proceed.

The Whale fishery was first brought into notice of the southern nations of Europe in the 15th. Century by the same Biscayans  and Basques who led the way to the fishery of Newfoundland. They

began it on their own Coasts, but soon found that the principal residence of the Whale was in the Northern seas, into which therefore they pursued him. In 1578 they employed 25 Ships in that business. The Dutch and Hamburghers took it up after this, and about the middle of the 17th. Century the former employed about 200 ships and the latter 350.  
The English endeavoured also to participate of it. In 1672 they  
  
25 Car. 2. c. 7  
  
offered to their own fishermen, a bounty of six shillings a Ton on the oil they should bring home, and instituted, at different times,   
  
6 G. 2. c. 33  
  
different exclusive companies, all of which failed of success. They raised their bounty in 1733, to 20 shillings a Ton on the admeasurement

of the vessel. In 1740 to 30 shillings with a privilege to the fisherman against being impressed. The Basque fishery,   
  
Encycl. Meth. Planchs. Cetologie. Introdn. 24.  
  
supported by poverty alone, had maintained but a feeble existence before competitors aided by the bounties of their nation, and was in fine annihilated by the war of 1745, at the close of which, the English bounty was raised to 40 shillings. From this   
  
22. G. 2. c. 45.  
  
epoch their whale fishery went on, between the limits of 28 and

67 vessels till the commencement of the last war.  
The Dutch, in the mean time had declined gradually to about 130

ships, and have since that fallen down to less than half that number; so that their fishery, notwithstanding a bounty of 30 florins a man, as well as that of Hamburg, is now nearly out of competition.  
In  
  
Peleg Coffin’s letter.  
  
1715 the Americans began their whale fishery. They were led to it at first by the whales which presented themselves on their Coasts. They attacked them there in small vessels of 40 Tons. As

their adventures to 60, 100, and 200 Tons. Having extended their pursuit to the western Islands, they fell in accidentally with the   
  
Tradition  
  
Spermaceti whale, of a different species from that of Greenland, which alone had been hitherto known in Commerce: more fierce and active and whose oil and head matter was found to be more valuable, as it might be used in the interior of Houses without offending the smell. The distinction now first arose between the Northern and Southern fisheries; the object of the former being the Greenland whale, which frequents the Northern Coasts and Seas of Europe and America, that of the latter being  the Spermaceti whale, which was found in the Southern seas from the western Islands and Coast of Africa to that of Brazil, and still on  
  
Pugh and others.  
  
to the Falkland Islands. Here again, within soundings on the Coast of Brazil they found a third species of whale, which they called the Black or Brazil whale, smaller than the Greenland, yielding   
  
Pugh’s experiments.  
  
a still less valuable oil, fit only for summer use, as it becomes opaque at 50 degrees of Farenheit’s thermometer, while that of the Spermaceti whale is limpid to 41. and of the Greenland whale to 36. of the same Thermometer. It is only worth taking therefore when it falls in the way of the fishermen, but not worth seeking, except when they have failed of success against the spermaceti whale, in which case this kind, easily found and taken, serves to moderate their loss.  
In  
  
Statement by committee of Mass.  
  
1771, the Americans had 183 vessels of 13,820 Tons in the Northern fishery, and 121 Vessels of 14,020 Tons in the Southern, navigated   
  
Statement given me at Paris  
  
by 4059. men. At the beginning of the late war they had 177 vessels in the Northern and 132 in the Southern fishery.  
At that period, our fishery being suspended, the English seized the  
  
Seth Jenkins’s examn. before the H. of Commons in 1775.  
  
opportunity of pushing theirs. They gave additional bounties of 500. 400. 300. 200. 100 pounds sterling annually to the five Ships   
  
before the H. of Commons in 1775.  
  
which should take the greatest quantities of oil; the effect of which was such as by the year 1786 to double the quantity of   
  
15. G. 3. c. Jenkinson in parl. 1786.  
  
common oil necessary for their own consumption. Finding on a   
  
Jenkinson in parl. 1786.  
  
review of the subject at that time that their bounties had cost the Government £13–10 sterling a man annually, or 60 per cent on the cargoes, a part of which went consequently to ease the purchases   
  
26. G. 3. c.  
  
of this article made by foreign nations, they reduced the Northern bounty from 40 to 30 shillings the Ton of admeasurement.  
They had some little time before turned their attention to the Southern  
  
26 G. 3. c. 50.  
  
fishery, had given very great bounties in it, and had invited the fishermen of the United States to conduct their enterprizes. Under their guidance and with such encouragement, this fishery, which had only begun with them in 1784 or 1785, was rising   
  
28 G. 3. c. 20.  
  
into value. In 1788 they increased their bounties, and the temptations to our fishermen, under the general description of foreigners who had been employed in the whale fishery, to pass over with their families and vessels to the British Dominions either in America or Europe, but preferably to the latter. The effect of these measures had been prepared by our Whale Oils becoming subject in their market to the foreign duty of £18–5 sterling the Ton, which being more than equal to the price of the common oil,  operated as a prohibition on that, and gave to their own Spermaceti oil a preference over ours to that amount. The particulars of this history are presented to the eye more in detail in the table No. 7.  
The fishermen of the United States left without resource by the loss of their market began to think of accepting the british invitation, and of removing some to Nova Scotia, prefering smaller advantages in the neighbourhood of their ancient Country and friends, others to Great Britain, postponing Country and friends to high premiums.  
The Government of France could not be inattentive to these proceedings; they saw the danger of letting 4. or 5000 seamen, of the best in the world, be transferred to the marine strength of another nation, and carry over with them an art which they possessed almost exclusively. To give time for a counter plan, the Marquis de la Fayette, the valuable friend and Citizen of this as well as that Country, wrote to a Gentleman in Boston to dissuade the fishermen from accepting the british proposals, and to assure them that their friends in France would endeavour to do something for them. A vessel was then arrived from Halifax at Nantucket to take off those who had proposed to remove. Two families had gone aboard, and others were going. In this moment, the letter arriving, suspended their designs. Not another went aboard, and the vessel returned to Halifax with only the two families.  
The plan adopted by the French Ministry very different from that of the first mover, was to give a counter-invitation to the Nantucket men to remove and settle in Dunkirk, offering them a  
  
Convention with the Nantuckois Dec. 5. 1785.  
  
bounty of 50 Livres (between 9. and 10. dollars) a Ton on the admeasurement of the Vessels they should equip for the whale fishery, with some other advantages. Nine families only of 33 persons, accepted this invitation. This was in 1785. In 1786 the ministry   
  
Rotch.  
  
were led to see that their invitation would produce but little effect, and that the true means of preventing the emigration of our fishermen to the british Dominions, would be to enable them still to follow their calling from their native Country, by giving them a new market for their oils, instead of the old one they had lost; the duties were therefore abated on American whale oil immediately, and a further abatement promised by the letter No. 8, and in December 1787 the Arret No. 9 was passed.  
The rival fishermen immediately endeavoured to turn this  measure to their own advantage, by pouring their whale oils into the markets of France, where they were enabled by the great premiums received from their Government, perhaps too by extraordinary indemnifications, to undersell both the French and American fishermen. To repel this measure, France shut her Ports to all foreign fish oils whatever, by the Arret No. 10. The british whale fishery fell in consequence the ensuing year from 222 to 178 Ships. But this general exclusion had palsied our fishery also. On the 7th. of December 1788 therefore, by the Arret No. 11, the Ports of France, still remaining shut to all other Nations, were again opened to the produce of the whale fisheries of the United States, continuing however their endeavours to recover a share in  
  
Rotch. But Chardon says 6. in the Encycl. Meth. ubi supra. pa. 26.  
  
this fishery themselves, by the aid of our fishermen. In 1784. 1785. 1786. they had had 4 Ships. In 1787 three. In 1788. 17. in the two fisheries, of 4500 Ton. These cost them in bounty 225,000 Livres which divided on 1550 Tons of oil, the quantity they took, amounted to 145 Livres (near 27 Dollars) the Ton, and   
  
Rotch.  
  
on about 100 natives on board the 17 Ships (for there were 150 Americans engaged by the voyage) came to 2250 Livres, or about 416⅔ dollars a man.  
We  
  
Statement by Committee of Mass.  
  
have had during the years 1787. 1788. 1789. on an average 91 vessels of 5820 Tons in the Northern, and 31 of 4390 Tons in the Southern fishery. See No. 12.  
These details will enable Congress to see with what a competition we have to struggle for the continuance of this fishery, not to say it’s increase. Against prohibitory duties in one country, and bounties to the adventurers in both of those which are contending with each other for the same object, ours have no auxiliaries but poverty and rigorous economy. The business, unaided, is a wretched one. The Dutch have peculiar advantages for the Northern fishery, as being within 6 or 8. days sail of the grounds, as navigating with more economy than any other nation in Europe, their seamen content with lower wages, and their merchants with lower profit. Yet the Memorial No. 13 from a Committee of the Whale Merchants to the States General of Holland in the year 1775. states that 14 millions of guilders equal to 5,600,000 dollars, had been lost in that fishery in 47 years, being about 120,000 dollars a year. The States General thereupon gave a bounty  
  
Pugh.  
  
of 30 guilders a man to the fishermen. A person intimately acquainted with the british whale fishery, and whose information merits confidence, has given assurance that the Ships employed  in their Northern fishery in 1788, sunk £800 each on an average, more than the amount of the produce and bounties. An English ship of 300 Tons and 42 Seamen in this fishery generally brings home,  
  
Pugh.  
  
after a four months voyage 25 Ton of Oil, worth £437.10 sterling. But the wages of the Officers and seamen will be 400. There remain but £37.10 not worth taking into account, towards the outfit and merchants profit. These then must be paid by the Government, and it is on this idea that the british bounty is calculated.  
Our vessels for the Northern fishery average 64 Tons, and cost when built, fitted out and victualled for their first voyage about 3000  
  
Table No. 12.  
  
dollars. They have taken on an average the three last years, according to the statement No. 12. 18 Tons of oil, worth, at our market 900 dollars, which are to pay all expences, and subsist the fisherman and Merchant. Our vessels for the Southern fishery average 140 Tons, and cost when built, fitted out and victualled for their first voyage about 6500 dollars. They have taken on an average the three last years according to the same statement 32 Tons of oil, each, worth at our market 3200 dollars, which are in like manner to pay all expences and subsist the owners and navigators. These expences are great, as the voyages are generally of 12 months duration. No hope can arise of their condition being bettered by an augmentation of the price of oil. This is kept down by the competition of the vegetable oils, which answer the same purposes, not quite so well, but well enough to become preferable, were the price to be raised, and so well indeed as to be more generally used than the fish oils for lighting Houses and Cities.  
The American whale fishery is principally followed by the inhabitants of the Island of Nantucket, a sand Bar of about 15 miles long  
  
Examination of Seth Jenkins  
  
and 3 broad, capable of maintaining by its agriculture about 20 families. But it employed in these fisheries before the war, between 5 and 6000 men and boys. And in the only harbour it possesses it had 140 vessels, 132 of which were of the larger kind, as being employed in the Southern fishery. In agriculture then they have no resource, and if that of their fishery cannot be pursued from their own habitations, it is natural they should seek others from which it can be followed, and preferably those where they will find a sameness of language, religion, laws, habits and kindred.   
  
Gore’s letter to Mr. Lear about Stokes  
  
A foreign emissary has lately been among them for the purpose of renewing the invitations to a change of situation. But attached to their native Country, they prefer continuing in it, if their continuance there can be made supportable.  
  
This brings us to the question what relief does the condition of this fishery require?  
  
1. A remission of duties on the Articles used for their calling.  
2. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to seek a competition with them in or from our Ports.  
3. Free markets abroad.  
1. The remission of duties will stand on nearly the same ground with that to the Cod fishermen.  
2. The only Nation whose oil is brought hither for competition with our own, makes ours pay a duty of about 82. dollars the Ton in their Ports. Theirs is brought here, too, to be reshipped fraudulently under our flag into ports where it could not be received under theirs, and ought not to be covered by ours, if we mean to preserve our own admission into them.  
  
The 3d. and principal object is to find markets for the vent of oil.  
Portugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Prussia, Russia, the Hanse Towns, supply themselves and something more. Spain and Italy receive supplies from England, and need the less as their skies are clearer. France is the only Country which can take our surplus, and they take principally of the common oil, as the habit is but commencing with them of ascribing a just value to that of the Spermaceti whale. Some of this however finds it’s vent there. There was indeed a particular interest perpetually soliciting the exclusion of our oils from their markets. The late Government there saw well that what we should lose thereby would be gained by others, not by themselves. And we are to hope that the present Government, as wise and friendly, will also view us, not as rivals, but as co-operators against a common rival. Friendly arrangements with them, and accomodation to mutual interest, rendered easier by friendly dispositions existing on both sides, may long secure to us this important resource for our seamen. Nor is it the interest of the fisherman alone, which calls for the cultivation of friendly arrangements with that Nation. Besides five eighths of our whale oil, and two thirds of our salted fish, they take from us one fourth of our Tobacco, three fourths of our live Stock (No. 14), a considerable and growing portion of our Rice, great  
  
Bureau of the balance of commerce in France.  
  
supplies occasionally of other grain; in 1789. which indeed was extraordinary, four millions of bushels of wheat, and upwards of a million of bushels of Rye and Barley (No. 15.) and nearly the whole carried in our own vessels (No. 16). They are  a free market now, and will in time be a valuable one for our Ships and Ship timber, potash and peltry.  
England is the market for the greater part of our Spermaceti oil. They impose on all our oils a duty of £18.5. sterling the Ton, which, as to the common kind, is a prohibition as has been before observed, and as to that of the Spermaceti, gives a preference of theirs over ours to that amount, so as to leave in the end but a  
  
Proclamation of Apr. 1 1790.  
  
scanty benefit to the fisherman. And not long since, by a change of construction, without any change of the law, it was made to exclude our oils from their ports, when carried in our own   
  
Proclamation of Oct. 5. 1790.  
  
vessels. On some change of circumstances it was construed back again to the reception of our oils, on paying always however the same duty of £18.5. This serves to shew that the tenure by which we hold the admission of this commodity in their markets, is as precarious as it is hard. Nor can it be announced that there is any disposition on their part to arrange this or any other commercial matter to mutual convenience. The exparte regulations which they have begun for mounting their navigation on the ruins of ours, can only be opposed by counter-regulations on our part. And the loss of seamen, the natural consequence of lost and obstructed markets for our fish and oil, calls in the first place for serious and timely attention. It will be too late when the seaman shall have changed his vocation, or gone over to another interest. If we cannot recover and secure for him these important branches of employment, it behoves us to replace them by others equivalent. We have three nurseries for forming seamen. 1. Our coasting trade, already on a safe footing. 2. Our fisheries, which, in spight of natural advantages give just cause of anxiety. 3. Our carrying trade the only resource of indemnification for what we lose in the other. The produce of the United States which is carried to foreign markets, is extremely bulky. That part of it now in the hands of foreigners, and which we may resume into our own, without touching the rights of those nations who have met us in fair arrangements by Treaty, or the interests of those who by their voluntary regulations, have paid so just and liberal a respect to our interests, as being measured back to them again, places both parties on as good ground perhaps as Treaties could place them, the proportion I say of our carrying trade which may be resumed without affecting either of these descriptions of Nations, will find constant employment for 10,000 seamen, be worth 2 Millions of dollars annually, will go on augmenting with the population of the United States, secure to us a full indemnification for the Seamen we lose,  and be taken wholly from those who force us to this act of self-protection, in navigation.  
Hence too would follow that their Newfoundland ships, not receiving provisions from us in their bottoms, nor permitted (by a law of their own) to receive in ours, must draw their subsistance from Europe, which would increase that part of their expences in the  
  
Champion 119.  
  
proportion of 4. to 7. and so far operate as a duty towards restoring the level between them and us. The tables No. 2. and 12. will shew the quantity of Tonnage, and consequently the mass of Seamen whose interests are in distress, and No. the materials for indemnification.  
If regulations, exactly the counterpart of those established against us, would be ineffectual, from a difference of circumstances, other regulations equivalent can give no reasonable ground of complaint to any nation. Admitting their right of keeping their markets to themselves, ours cannot be denied of keeping our carrying trade to ourselves. And if there be any thing unfriendly in this, it was in the first example.  
The loss of seamen, unnoticed, would be followed by other losses in a long train. If we have no seamen, our ships will be useless, consequently our Ship timber, Iron and hemp: our Ship building will be at an end, ship carpenters go over to other nations, our  
  
The whole tonnage from the U.S. would have been about 650,000. had N. Carolina and R. isld. been included. This on a medium freight of D. to all parts of the world would be nearly 6. millions of dollars.  
  
young men have no call to the Sea, our produce, carried in foreign bottoms, be saddled with war freight and insurance, in times of war; and the history of the last hundred years shews that the nation which is our carrier has 3. years of war for any 4. years of peace (No. 18.); we lose, during the same periods, the carriage for belligerent powers, which the neutrality of our flag would render an incalculable source of profit, we lose, at this moment, the carriage of our own produce to the annual amount of 2 millions of dollars, which in the possible progress of the encroachment, may extend to 5. or 6. millions, the worth of the whole, with an increase in proportion to the increase of our numbers. It is easier, as well as better, to stop this train at it’s entrance, than when   
  
T. Coxe. But in another view 25 millions of dollars worth of exports @ 20. pr. cent freight, would be 5 millions.  
  
it shall have ruined or banished whole classes of useful and industrious Citizens.  
It will doubtless be thought expedient that the resumption suggested should take effect so gradually as not to endanger the loss of produce for the want of transportation: but that, in order to create transportation, the whole plan should be developed, and made known at once, that the individuals who may be disposed  to lay themselves out for the carrying business, may make their calculations on a full view of all circumstances.  
On the whole, the historical view we have taken of these fisheries proves they are so poor in themselves as to come to nothing with distant nations who do not support them from their Treasury. We have seen that the advantages of our position place our fisheries on a ground somewhat higher such as to relieve our Treasury from the necessity of giving them support, but not to permit it to draw support from them, nor to dispense the Government from the obligation of effectuating free markets for them: that for the great proportion of our salted fish, for our common oil, and a part of our Spermaceti oil, markets may perhaps be preserved by friendly arrangements towards those nations whose arrangements are friendly to us, and the residue be compensated by giving to the seamen thrown out of business the certainty of employment in another branch of which we have the sole disposal.

THE Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the House  
of Representatives, the representation from the General Court  
of the Commonwealth of iMaffachufetts, on the fubje&amp;s of the cod  
and whale fifhcies, together with the several papers accompany­  
ing it, has had the fame under consideration, and thereupon makes  
the following Report :  
The representation sets forth that, before the late war, about  
fourthoufand seamen, and twenty-four thousand tons of (hipping  
were annually employed, from that State, in the whale fifhery,  
the producc whereof was about three hundred and fifty thousand  
pounds a year.  
That thcfe branches of business, annihilated during the war,  
have been, in some degree, recovered since : but that they labor  
under many and heavy embarrassments, whieh, if not removed,  
or lessened, will render the fiiheries every year less extensive and  
important.  
That these embarrassments are, heavy duties on their produce  
abroad, and bounties on that of their competitors : and duties at  
home on several articles, particularly used in the fifheries.  
  
And it aflts that the duties he taken off ; that bounties be given  
to the fifbermen ; and the national influence be used abroad for .&#x27;  
obtaining better markets for their produce.  
The cod and whale fifberies, carried on by different persons,  
from different ports, in different veffe&#x27;.i, in different seas, and seek­  
ing different markets, agree in one circumstance, in being as un­  
profitable to the adventurer, as important to the public. A fuc­  
cinft view of their rife, progress, and present state, with different  
nations, may enable us to note the circumilances which have at­  
tended their profperitv, and their decline, to judge of the embar­  
rassments, which are said to opprefsours; to fee whether they de-.  
pend on our own will, and may, therefore, be remedied imme­  
diately by ourfelves,or, whether, depending on the will of others,,  
they are without the rcach of remedy, from us, either directly or  
indire£lly.  
Their history, being as unconncfted as their pra&amp;ice, they (ball  
be feparatelv considered.  
Within twenty years after the supposed discovery of Newfound­  
land, bv the Cabots, we find that ihe abundance of fifh on its:  
banks, had already drawn the attention of the people of Europe.  
For, as early as 1517, or 1519, we ate told of fifty Ibips being seen  
there atone time. The firll adventurers iu that filbery, were the  
Bifcavans of Spain, the Bafquesand Bas-Brctons of France, all uni­  
ted anciently in language, and still in habits and in extreme po­  
verty. The last circumstance enabled them long to retain a consi­  
derable share of the filberv. In 1,577, the French had one hun­  
dred and fifty vessels there ; the Spaniards had still one hundred ;  
and the Portuguese filtv, wben the English had only fifteen. The  
Spaniardsand Portuguese Teem, at length, to have retired silently,  
the French and Englith claiming the filhery excluiivelv, as an ap­  
purtenance to their adjacent colonies, and the profits being too  
small for nations surcharged with the precious metals pioceedmg  
from their mines.  
Without materials to trace the intermediate progress, we only  
know that so late as 1744, the French employed there five hnndred  
and fixtv-four ships, and twenty-seven thousand five hundred fca­  
men, and took one million two hundred and forty-fix thousand  
kentals of fifh. which w*t three times the extent to which England  
and her colonies together carried this filbery at that time.

The English, in the beginning of the feventeenrh century, hai  
employed, generally, about one hundred and fifty vefTels in the  
Newfoundland fifhery. About 1670, we find them reduced ro  
eighty, and one hundred, the inhabitants of New-England begin­  
ning now to supplant them. A little before this, the British par­  
liament, perceiving that their citizens were unable to subsist on the  
scan y profits which fufficed for their poorer competitors, endea­  
vored to give them some advantage by prohibiting the importation  
of foreign fifh ; and, at the close of the century, they formed some  
regulations for their government and protettion : and remitted to  
them some duties. A fuccefsfnl war enabled them in 1713 to force  
from the French, a ceflion of the island of Newfoundland. Un­  
der these encouragements, the English and American fifheries be­  
gan to thrive. In 1731, we find the English take two hundred  
thousand kcntals of fifh, and the Americans two hundred and thir­  
ty thousand, besides the refufe fifh not fit for European markets.  
They continue to gain ground, and the French to lose it, inso­  
much, that about 1755, they are said to have been on a par : and,  
in 1768, the French have only two hundred and fifty-nine vefTels  
of twenty-four thousand four hundred and twenty tons, nine thou­  
sand seven hundred and twenty-two seamen, taking two hundred  
thousand kentals, while America alone, for some three or four  
years before that, and so on to the commencement of the late war,  
employed fix hundred and fixty-five veirels, of twenty-five thou­  
sand fix hundred and fifty tons, and four thousand four hundred  
and five seamen, and took from three hundred and fifty thousand,  
to upwards of four hundred thousand kentals of fifh. and England  
a still greater quantity, five hundred and twenty-fix thousand ken­  
tals, as is said.  
  
Spain had formally relinquiflicd her pretensions to a participa­  
tion in these fiftieries, at the clofeof the preceding war ; and, at  
the end of this, the adjacent continent and ifiands, being divided  
between the United States, the EngliOi and French (lor the last re­  
tained two imall ifiands merely for this cbjed) the right of fifliing  
was apprqpriated to them also.  
  
Franc-e, fenlibleof the necessity of balancing the power of F,n&lt;r.  
land on the water, and therefore, of improving everv resource for  
raising fcamen, and feeing that her fifhermen could not maintain  
their competition without some public patronage, adopted the ex­  
periment of bounties on her own fifh, and dutie* on that of foreign  
nations brought into her markets. But, notwithftandins; this, her  
fifherics dwindle, from a change taken place, infenftbly, in the  
character of her navigation, which, from being the mod economi­  
cal, is now become the most expenfivc. In 1786, file is said to  
have employed but seven thousand men in this fi:hery, and to have  
taken four hundred and tweniv-fix thousand kentals ; and in 1787,  
hut fix thousand men, and and twenty-eighj thousand  
kentals. She seems not yet sensible that the unthrtftinefs of her  
.fifheries proceeds from the want of economy, and not the want  
of markets ; and that the encouragement of our fifhery abridge  
that of a rival nation, whose power on the ocean has long threat*  
ened the loss of all balance on that element.

THE plan of the English government, fmce the peace, has been  
to prohibit all foreign filh in their markets, and they have  
given from eighteen to fifty pounds (lerling, on every fifhirig ves­  
sel complying with certain conditions.- This policy ii said to  
have been so far fuccefstul as to have raised the number of lea­  
men employed in that business in 1786, to fourteen thousand, and  
the quantity of fifh taken, to seven hundred and thirty-two thou­  
sand kentals. The table No. 1, hereto annexed, will present to  
the eye, this history more in detail.  
The fifheiics of the United States, annihilated during the war ;  
their veffcls, utensils, and filherincn tleftroyed ; their markets in  
the Mediterranean and Biitifb-America loft, and their produce  
dutied in those of France, their competitors enabled by bounties  
to meet and under fell them at the few markets remaining open  
without any public aid, and indeed, plying aids to the public :  
Such werethc hopeless auspices, underwhich this important busi­  
ness was to be resumed. Yet it was resumed, and. aided by the  
mere forcc of natural advantages, they employed, during the years  
1786,—7,—8,— g, on an average, five hundred thirtv-nine vessels,  
of nineteen thousand one hundred eighty-five tons, three thousand  
two hundred cighty-feven seamen, and took two hundred fifty

that the profits of the sales in the years 1707,-8, were too (mall to  
afford □ living to the fifherman, and on those of 1789, ihere was  
such a loss as to withdraw thirty-thiee vessels, of the town of  
Marblehead alone, from the further pursuit of this business : And  
the apprehension is, that, without some public aid, those flill re­  
maining will continue to withdrawt and this whole commerce be  
engrofled by a firtgle nation.  
  
This rapid view of the cod-fifhery, enables us to discern under  
what policy it has flourifhed or declined in the hands of other na­  
tions, and to mark the fa&amp;,*that it is too poor a business to be left  
to it itfelf, even with the nation the most advantageously fttuated.  
  
It will now be proper to count the advantages which aid, and  
the disadvantages which oppose us in this contest.  
  
Our advantages are—  
  
1. The neighbourhood of the great fifheries, which permits our  
fifhermen to bring home their fifh to be salted by their wives and  
  
Jix&#x27;dd ren.  
f/1. The shore so near at hand as to enable the vefTels  
/so run into port in a storm, and so lefTcn the risk, for which dis­  
tant nations must pay insurance.  
  
3. The winter fifheries, which, like houftiold manufa&amp;ures,  
employ portions of time which would otherwise be useless.  
4. The fmallnefs of the vefTels, which the fhoitnefs of the voyage  
enables us to employ, and which, consequently, require but a {mail  
capital.  
5. The cheapness of our vefTels, which do not cost above the  
half of the Baltic fir vefTels, computing price and duration.  
  
6. Their excellence as sea boats, which decreases the rifle, and  
quickens the returns.  
7. Thefuperiority of our mariners in (kill, a&amp;ivity, entcrprize,  
fobrietv and order.  
  
8. The cheapness of provisions.  
  
9. The cheapness of casks, which, of itfelf, is said to be equal  
to an extra profit of fifteen per cent  
  
These advantages are of such force, that, while experience has  
proved that no other nation can make a mercantile profit on the  
Newfoundland fifhery, nor can support it without national aid,  
we can make a living profit, if vent for our filh can be procured.  
  
Of the diladvantages opposed to us, those which depend on our-  
I selves, are,—  
  
Tonnage, and naval duties on the vefTels employed in the fifhery.  
Impost duties on fait, on tea, rum, sugar, mo-1 TTf j • t  
lafles, hooks, lines and leads, duck, cordage and C fifh&#x27;ci 11C  
cables, iron, hemp, and twine. ) C 1  
Coarse woollens worn by the fifhermen ; and the poll-tax levied  
by the State on their persons. The statement, No. 6, shews the  
amount ofthefe, exclusive of the State tax. and drawback on the  
fifh exported, to be 5.25 dollars per man, or 57.75 dollars per ves­  
sel of fifty-five tons. When a business is so nearly in equilibrio,  
that one can hardly discern whether the profit be fuflicient to con­  
tinue it, or not, finaller sums than these fuffice to turn the scale  
against it. To these disadvantages, add ineffe&amp;ual duties on the  
importation of foreign fifh. In juftification of these last, it is ur­  
ged that the foreign fifh received, is in exchange for the produce  
of agriculture. To which it may be anfwercd, that the thing gi­  
ven, is more merchantable than that received in exchange, and  
that agriculture h«s too many markets to be allowed to take away  
thofeof the {liberies. It will reft, therefore, with the wisdom of  
the legislature, to decide, whether prohibition should not be op­  
-1 posed to prohibition, and high duty to high duty, on the fifh of  
other nations : Whether any, and which of the naval and other  
duties, may be remitted, or an equivalent given to the fifherman  
in the form of a drawback or bounty; and whether the loss of  
markets abroad may not, in some degree, be compensated by  
creating markets at home ; to which might contribute the consti­  
tuting fifh a part of the military ration, in flations, not too distant  
from navigation, a part of the necessary sea stores of vefTels, and  
the encouraging private individuals to let the fifherman share with  
the cultivator, in furnifiiing the fuppliesof the table. A habit in­  
troduced fiom motives of patriotism, would soon be followed,  
j from motives of taste : And who will undertake to fix limits to  
I this demand, if it can be once excited, with a nation whichdoubles,  
and will long continue to double at very short periods ?  
To be continued.

REPORT  
  
OF THE  
SECRETARY OF STATE,  
  
On the fubjefr of rhe  
COD AND WHALE FISHERIES,  
[continued.]  
OF the disadvantages, which depend on others,  
are   
  
1. The loss of the Mediterranean markets&#x27;.  
2. Exclusions from &quot;the markets of fonie   
neighbours.  
3. High duties in those of others, and —  
4. Bounties to the individuals in competition  
with us.  
  
The consideration of these will find its place  
more aptly, after a review of the condition of  
our whale fifhery, shalL have led us to the fame  
point. To this branch of the fubjecrt, therefore,  
we will now proceed.  
  
The whale fiihery was firft.btought into notice  
of the southern nations ofiEurope, in the fifteenth  
century, by the fame Bifcayansand Basques, who  
led the way to the fifhery of Newfoundland.—  
They began it on their own coasts, but soon found  
that the principal relidence of the whale, was in  
the northern seas, into which, therefore, they  
pursued him. In 1578, they employed twenty­  
five ships in that business; the Dutch and Ham­  
burghers tookit up afterthis, and about the mid­  
dle of the seventeenth century, the former em­  
ployed about two hundred ships, and the latter  
three hundred and fifty.  
  
The English endeavoured also to participate  
of it. In 1672, they offered to their own fiiher­  
men a bounty of fix (hillings a ton, 011 the oil they  
Ihould bring home, and inflituted at different  
times, different exclusive companies, all of which  
failed of success. They raised their bounty in  
1733, to twenty (hillings a ton on the admeasure­  
ment of the vell&#x27;el. In 1740, to thirty (hillings,  
with a privilege to the fi(herman against being  
imprefled. The Basque .fclhery, supported by po­  
verty alone, had maintained, but a feeble exig­  
ence, before competitors, aided by the bounties  
of their nation, and was, in fine, annihilated by  
the war of 1745, at the close of which, the Eng­  
lish bounty was raised 10 forty (hillings. From  
this epoch, their whale fifhery went on between  
the limits of twenty-eight and fixty-fev&#x27;en veflels,  
till the commencement of the last tvar.  
  
The Dutch, in-the mean time, had declined  
gradually to about one hundred and thirty (hips,  
and have since that-fallen down to less than half  
that number : so that their fifliery, notwith­  
flanding a bounty of thirty florins a man, as  
■well as that of Hamburgh, is now nearly out of  
competition.  
  
In 17r5, the Americans began their whale  
fidiery. They were led to it atfirft by the whales  
■which presented themselves on their coasts.  
They attacked them therein finall veflels of for­  
ty tons. As the whale, being infected, retired  
from the coast, they followed hi in farther and  
farther into the ocean, still enlarging their ves­  
sels, with their adventures, to fixry, one hun­  
dred and two hundred tons. Having extended  
their pursuit to the Western Islands, they fell  
in, accidentally, with the fpermacxti whale,  
of a different species from that of Greenland,  
•which alone had been hitherto known in com­  
merce ; more fierce and active, .and whose oil  
and head-matter was fotind to benrore valuable,  
as it might be used in the interior of houses  
■without oflending the finell. T*he diftindiion  
now firfl. arose between the northern and sou­  
thern fifheries; the objetft of the lormeribeincr  
the Greenland whale, which frequents the nor­  
thern coasts and seas of Europe and America,  
  
that of the latter being the fpermacsetS whale,  
which was found in the southern seas, from the  
Western Iflaijds and coast of Africa to that of  
Brazil, and still on to the Falkland Islands.  
Here again, within foundings, on the coast of  
Brazil, they found a third (pedes of whale,  
which they called the black, or Brazil whale,  
finaller than the Greenland, yielding a still less  
valuable oil, fit only for (ummer use, as it be­  
comes opaque at fifty degrees of Farenheit&#x27;s  
thermometer, while that of the fpermacxti whale  
is limped to forty-one, and of the Greenland  
whale to thirty-fix, of the fame thermometer.  
It is only worth taking therefore, when it falls  
in the way of the fifliernien, but not worth seek­  
ing, except when they have failed of success a­  
gainst the fperinacaeti whale, in which cale this  
kind, easily found and taken, serves to mode­  
rate their loss.

IN 1771, the Americans had one hundred and  
eighty-three vellels, of thirteen thousand eight  
liundi ed and twenty tons, in the northern fiih­  
ery, and one hundred and twenty-one vellels,  
of fourteen thoufaiul and twenty tons, in the  
louthern, navigated by four thouland and fifty­  
nine men. At the beginning of the late war,  
they had one hundred and leventy-feven vellels  
in the northern, and one hundred and thirty­  
two in tlie fotuliern fiftiery.  
  
Ac that period, our fiihery being suspended,  
the Engli/h seized the opportunity of pufliing  
theirs. They gave additional bounties of five  
hundred, four hundred, three hundred, two  
hundred, one hundred pounds ftetling, annual­  
ly, to the five ships, whicii Ihould take the great­  
est quantity of oil. The effect of which was  
such, as, by the year 1786, to double the quan­  
tity of common oil necellary for their own con­  
funiption. Finding, 011 a review of the fubjetf,  
at that time, that their bounties had cost the go­  
vernment thirteen pounds ten (hillings sterling  
a man annually, or sixty percent, on the cargoes,  
a part of which went coni&#x27;equently to ease the  
purchases of this article made by foreign nations,  
they reduced the northern bonnty from forty to  
thirty (hillings the ton of admeasurement.  
They had some little time before turned their  
attention to thefoiuhern fiihery, had given very  
great bounties in it, and had invited the fifhermen  
of the United States, to condutfl their enterpri­  
zes. Under their guidance, and with such en­  
couragement, this fiihery, which had only beo-un  
them in 1 784 or 1785, was rising into rafue.  
In 1788, they increased their bounties, and the  
temptations to our fiftiermen, under the general  
description ofJoreigners who had been employed in  
the lubale-fifliery, to pass over with their families  
and veflels to the Briti(h dominions either in A­  
merica or Europe, but preferably to the latter.—  
The effetfl of these measures had been prepared  
by our whale oils becoming fubjeifi, in their mar­  
ket, to the foreign duty of eighteen pounds five  
/hillings sterling the ton, which, being more than  
equal to the price of the common oil, operated  
as a prohibition on that, and gave to their own  
fpermacsti oil a preference over ours to that a­  
mount. The particulars of this history are pre­  
sented to the eye, more in detail, in the table  
No. 7.  
  
The fifhermen of the United States, left with­  
out resource by the loss of their market, began  
to think of accepting the British invitation, and  
of removing—some to Nova-Scotia, preferring  
lmaller advantages in the neighbourhood of their  
ancient country and friends, others to Great-Bri­  
tain, postponing country and friends to high  
premiums.  
  
The government of France could not be inat­  
tentive to these proceedings. They saw the dan­  
ger of letting four or five thousand feainen, of the  
best in the world, be transferred to the marine  
itrengtli of another nation, and carry over with  
them an art, which poHeffed almost exclusive-  
To give time for a counter plan, the Mar­  
quiMtlela Fayette, the valuable friend and citi­  
zen of this, as well as that country, wrote to a  
gentleman in Boston to difi&#x27;uade the fifhermen from  
accepting the British proposals, and to afl&#x27;ure them  
that their friends in France would endeavor to do  
something for them. A veflel was then arrived  
from Halifax, at Nantucket, to take off those who  
had proposed to remove. Two families had gone  
a board, and others were going. In this moment,  
the letter arriving, suspended their designs. Not  
another went aboard, and the veflel returned to  
Halifax with only the two families.  
  
The plan adopted by the French miniftrv, very  
different from that of the firft mover, was to give  
a counter invitation to the Nantucket men to re­  
move and fettle in Dunkirk, offering them a boun­  
ty of fifty livres (between nine and ten dollars)  
a ton on the admeasurement of the veflels thev  
ihould equip for the whale filhery, vvithfome other  
advantages. Nine families only, of thirty three  
persons, accepted this invitation. This was in  
178 J. In 1786, the ministry were led to fee, that  
their invitation would produce but little efFetft,  
and that the true means of preventing the emi­  
gration of our fifhermen to the British dominions,  
would be to enable them ltill to follow their call­  
ing from their native country, by giving them a  
Jiew market for their oils, initead of the old one  
they had loft. The duties were, therefore, aba­  
ted 011 American whale oil immediately, and a  
further abatement promised by the letter N. 8  
and in December, 1787, the arret, No. 9, was  
patted. To be continued.

COD AND WHALE FISHERIES,  
  
THE rival fifhermen immediately endeavoured to turn this  
measure to their own&#x27; advantage, by pouring their whale  
oils into the markets of France, where they were enabled, by  
the great premiums received from their governmeot, perhaps too  
by extraordinary indemnifications, to undersell both the French  
and American fifhermen. To repel this measure, France shut her  
ports to all foreign fifh oils whatever, by the arret No. 10. The  
British whale fiftiery fell, in confcquence, the ensuing year, from  
two-hundred and twenty-two to one hundred and feveiuy-eight  
ships. But this general exclusion had palsied our fishery alio.  
On the seventh of December, 1788, therefore, by the arret No.  
xi, the ports of France, still remaining (hut to all other nations,  
&quot;were again opened to the produce of the whale fifheries of the  
United States ; continuing, however, their endeavours to recover  
a ihare in this fi(hery themselves, by the aid of our fiftiermen.  
In 1784—5—6—they had had four ships ; in 1787, three ; in  
X/ 88, seventeen :n the two fifheries, of tour thousand seven hun­  
dred ton. These cost them in bounty, two hundred and twentv­  
fivc thousand livresTwilich divided on one thousand five hundred  
and fifty tons of oil, tWe quantity they took, amounted to one  
hundred and forty-five livres (near twenty-seven dollars) the ton ;  
and on about one hundred natives on board the seventeen ships,  
for there were one hundred and fifty Americans engaged by the  
voyage) came to two thousand two hundred and fifty livres, or  
about four hundred and sixteen dollars and two-thirds a man.  
  
We have had daring the years 1787—8—9—on an average,  
ninety-one veflels, of five thouf«ind eight hundred and twenty  
tons, in the northern, and thirty-one, of four thousand three  
hundred and ninctv-tons, in the southern fifhery. See No. 12.  
The details will enable Congress to fee with what a competition  
ye have to struggle for the continuance of this filhery, not to fay  
its inrreafe. Against prohibitory duties in one country, and  
bounties of the adventurers in both of tliofe which are contend­  
ing with each other for the fame object, ours have no auxiliaries  
but poverty and rigorous economy. The bufintfs, unaided, is a  
■wretched one. The Dutch have peculiar advantages for the nor­  
thern fifhery, as being within fix or eight days fail of the grounds,  
as navigating with more economy than *ny other nation in Europe,&#x27;  
their seamen content with lower wages, and their merchants with  
lower profits. Yet the memorial of No. 13, from a committee  
of the whale merchants to the States General of Holland in the  
year 1775, state* that fourteen millions of guilders, equal to five  
millions fix hundred thousand dollars, had been loft in that fifh­  
ery in forty-feven years, being about one hundred and twenty  
thousand dollars a year, &#x27;1 he States General thereupon gave a  
bounty or thirty guilders a man to the fifhermen. A person in­  
timately acquainted with the British whale fifhery, and whose  
Jnlormation merits confidence, has given afTurance that the ships  
employed in their northern filhery in 1788, funk eight hundred  
pounds each on an average, more than the amount of the pro­  
duce and bounties. An English {hip of three hundred tons, and  
forty.two seamen in this fifhery generally brings home, after a  
lour months voyage, twenty-five ton of oil, worth four hundred  
and thirty-seven pounds ten (hillings sterling ; but the wages of  
the officers and seamen will be four hundred pounds, theie re­  
main but thirty-seven pounds ten shillings, not worth taking in­  
to account towards the outfit and merchants profit. Thefc then  
must be paid by th? government; and it is on this idea that the  
Eritifh bounty is calculatcd.  
Our veflel for the northern fifhery average sixty-sour tons, and  
cod when built, fitted ouf, and victualled for their firft voyage  
about three thousand dollars. They have taken on an average The  
three lafl years, according to the flatement No. 12, eighteen tons  
of oil, worth, at our m3i ket, nine hundred dollars, which are to  
pay all expenees, and subsist the fiihermen and merchant. Our  
vessels for the fourhern fifhery average one hundred and forty tons,  
and cost, when built, fitted out, and victualled for their firft  
vc-yage, about fix thousand five hundred dollars. They have ta­  
ken on an average the three last years, according to the fame  
statement, thirty-two tons ot oil, each worth at our market three  
thousand two hundred dollars, which are, in like manner, to pjv  
all expenees and subsist the owners and navigators. Thcfe expen­  
ees are great, as the voyages are generally of twelvemonths du­  
ration. No hope can arise of their condition being bettered bv  
an augmentation of the price of oil. This is kept down by the  
competition ot the vegetable oils, which answer the fame purpo­  
ses, not quite so well, but well enough to becomc preferable,  
■were Ihe price to be raised, and so well indeed as to be moie&#x27;  
generally used than the fifh oils for lighting houses and cities.  
The A merican whale fifhery is principally followed by the in­  
habitants of the island of Nantucket, a sand bar of about fifteen  
miles long and three broad, capable of maintaing bv its agricul­  
ture about twenty-families : but it employed in these fifhenes be­  
fore the war, between five and fix thousand men and boys; and  
in the only harbour it pofTefles, it had one hundred and &#x27;forty  
veflels, one hundred and thirty-two of which were of the larger  
kind, as being employed in the southern fifhery. In agriculture  
then, theyha«.eno resource, and, if that of their fifhery cannot  
be pursued from their own habitations, it is natural they should  
seek others from which it can be followed, and preferably those  
they will find a lameness of language, religion, laws, ha­  
bits and kindred. A foreign emiflary has lately been   
them, for the purpose of renewing the invitations to a change oT  
situation. But attached to their native country, they prefer con­  
tinuing in it, if their continuance in it can be made supportable.  
This brings us to the question, what relief does the condition  
of this fifhery require ?  
lft. A remission of duties on the articles used for their calling.  
2d. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to seek a com­  
petition with them in or from our ports.  
3d. Free markets abroad.  
lft. The remiflion of duties will stand oa nearly the fame  
ground with that to the cod fifhermen.  
  
2d. The only nation whose oil is brought hither for competi­  
tion with our own, makes ours pay a duty of about eighty-two  
dollars the ton, in their ports. Theirs is brought here too, to  
be re-shipped fraudulently under our flag into ports where it  
could not be received under theirs, and ought not to be covered  
by ours, if we mean to preserve our own admission into them. The  
3d. And principal object, is to find markets for the vent of oil.  
Portugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Pru{fia,  
Rufiia, the Hanfe towns, supply themselves and something more.  
Spain and Italy receive supplies from England, and need the  
Icfs as their flues ai e clearer. France is the only country which  
can take our surplus, and they take principally of the common  
oil; as the habit is but commencing with them of ascribing a jufl  
value to that of the (permacaeti whale. Some of this, however,  
finds vent there. There was, indeed, a particular interest per­  
petually soliciting the cxclufion of our ofls from their maikets.  
The late government there saw well, thai what we should lose  
thereby, would be gained by others, not by themselves. And  
■we are to hope that the present government, as wife and friendly,  
will also view us, not as rivals, but asco-operators against a com­  
mon rival. Friendly arrangements with them, and accommo­  
dation to mutual interest, rendered easier by friendly dispositions  
exiftingon both fides, may long secure to us this important re­  
source lor our seamen. Nor is it the ir.tereft at the fifherman  
  
[continued.]  
  
alone, which calls for the cultivation of fri?ndly arrangements  
with that nation. Besides five-eighths of our whale oil, and two­  
thirds of our salted fifh, thty take from us one-fourth of our to­  
bacco, three-fourths of our Jive flock (No. 14.) a considerable  
and growing proportion ot our rice, great supplies occafionallv  
of other grain ; in 1789, whith, indeed, was extraordinary foui  
millions of buihels ot wheat, and upwards of a million of buQi­  
elsof rye and barley (No. 15.) and nearly the whole carried in  
our own vessels (No. 16.) They are a free market now, and will  
in a time be a valuable one for our (hips and ship-timber, potash  
and peltry. [To be continued.]

SECRETARY OF STATE,  
  
On the fubjc£t of rhe  
  
CODAND WHALE FISHERIES,  
  
[CONTI NUED.]  
ENGLAND is the market for the greater part of our spermaceti  
oil. They impose on allour oils, a duty of eighteen pounds  
five shillings sterling the ton, which, as to the common kind, is a  
prohibition, as has been before observed, ard as tothat of the sper­  
maceti, gives a preference of theirs over outs to that amount, so  
as to leave in the end, but a scanty benefit to the fifherman ; and  
not long since, by a change of conftru£tion, without any change  
of the law, it was made to exclude our oils from their ports, when  
carried in our own&#x27;vcflels. On some change of circumstance, it  
was construed back again to the reception of our oils ; on paying  
always, however, the fame duty of eighteen pounds five shillings.  
This fervesto (hew that the tenure by which we hold the admis­  
sion of this commodity in their markets, is as precarious as it is  
hard. Nor can it be announced that there is any disposition on  
  
25  
  
ELLA,  
  
  
[Whole No. 215.]  
  
&#x27;heir part, to arrange this, or any other commercial matter, to mu­  
tual convenience. The exparte regulations which they have he­  
gun for mounting their navigation on the ruins of ours, nan only  
_&gt;e opposed by counter regulations on our part. And the loss of  
seamen, the natural confequcnce of loft and obftruCled markets (or  
our fifh and oil, calls in the firft place, for serious and timely at­  
tention. It will be too late when the seaman (hall have changed  
his vocation, or gone over to another interest. If we cannot re­  
cover and secure for him these important branches of employ­  
ment, it behoves us to replace them by others equivalent. We  
have three nurseries for forming seamen  
1. Our coasting trade, already on a fafe footing.  
2. Our fifheries, which in spite of natural advantages, give just  
cause of anxiety. J  
3. Our carrying trade, the only refonrce of indemnification for  
what we lose in the other. The produce of the United States,  
which is carried to foreign markets, is extremely bulky. That  
part of it now in the hands of foreigners, and which we may re­  
sume into our own, without touching the rights of those nations  
who have met us in fair arrangements by treaty, or the interests  
of those, who, by their voluntary regulations, have paid so just and.  
liberal a refpeft to our interests, as being measured back to them  
again, places both parties on as good ground, perhaps, as treaties  
could place them : the proportion, I fay, of our carrying trade,  
which may be resumed without affecting either of these defcrip­  
tionsof nations, will find constant employment for ten thousand  
Icamcn, be worth two millions of dollars annually, will go on  
augmenting with the population of the United States, secure to us  
a lull indemnification for the seamen we lose, and be taken wholly  
from those who force us to this ast of felf-proteflion, in navigation.  
Hence too would follow that their Newfoundland (hips, not re­  
ceiving provisions from us in their bottoms, nor permitted (by a  
law of their own) to receive in ours, mail draw their fubfiltence  
from Europe, which would increase that part of their expences  
in the proportion of four to seven, and so far operate as a duty  
towards rcftoring the level between them and us. The tables No.  
2 and 12, will (hew the quantity of tonnage, and consequently  
the mass of seamen whose interests are in distress ; and No. 17,  
the materials for indemnification.  
  
If regulations, exattly the counterpart of those established a­  
gainst us, would be ineffe&amp;ual from a difference of circumftaices,  
other regulations equivalent can give no reasonable ground of  
complaint toany nation. Admitting their right of keeping their  
markets to themselves, ours cannot be denied of keeping our  
carrying trade to ourselves. And if there be any unfriend­  
ly in this, it was in the firft example.  
Thelofs of seamen unnoticed, would be followed by othei los­  
ses in a long train. If we have no seamen, our ships will be use­  
less, consequently our (hip timber, iron and hemp ; our (hip-build­  
ing will be at an end, (hip-carpenters go over to other nations,  
our young men have no call to the sea, our produce carried in fo­  
reign bottoms, be fadiled with warfreight and insurance in times  
of war; and the history of the last one hundred years, shews that  
the nation which is our carrier has three years of war for every  
four years of peace. (No. 18) We lose, during the fame periods,  
the carriage for belligerent powers, which the neutrality of our  
flag would render an incalculable source of profit; we lose at this  
moment the carriage of our own produce to the annual amount  
of two millions of dollars, which in the poflible progress of the  
encroachment, may extend to five or fix millions, the worth of  
the whole, with an increase in the proportion of the increase of  
our numbers. It is easier as well as better, to stop this train at its  
entrance, than when it (hall have ruined or banilhed whole clafies  
ofufeful and industrious citizens.  
  
It will doubtless be thought expedient that the resumption fug­  
geftcd should take effett so gradually as not to endanger the loss of  
produce for the want of transportation ; but that, in order to cre­  
ate transportation, the whole plan (hould be developed, and made  
known at once, that the individuals who may be disposed to lay  
themselves out for the carrying business may make their calcula­  
tions on a full view of all circumltances.  
  
On the whole, the historical view we have taken of these fifti­  
enes provts they arc so poor in themselves as to come to nothing  
with distant nations, who do not support them from their trca­  
furies. We have seen that the advantages of our pcfition place our  
fifheries on a ground lomewhat higher, such as to relieve our trea­  
sury from the neceflity of giving them support, but not to permit  
it to draw support from them, nor to dispense the government  
from the obligation of effectuating free markets for them, that for  
the great proportion ofour salted fifh, for our common oil, and a  
part ot our fpermacani oil, markets may perhaps, be prefeived by  
friendly arrangememstowards those nations whose arrangements  
are friendly to us, and the rcfidue be compeni&#x27;ated by giving to  
the seamen thrown out of business the certainty of employment in

HE fecretary of ftate, to whom was referred by the houfe of reprefenta-  
  
tives, the reprefentation from the general court of the commonwealth of  
Maffachufetts, on the fubje€ts of the cod and whale fifheries, together with  
the feveral papers accompanying it, has had the fame under confideration, and  
thereupon makes the following—  
  
REPORT:  
  
The reprefentation fets forth, that, before the late war, about four thou-  
fand feamen, and twenty-four thoufand tons of fhipping, were annually employ-  
ed, from that ftate, in the whale fihhery, the produce whereof was about three  
hundred and fifty thoufand pounds, lawful money, a year.  
  
That, previous to the fame period, the cod fithery of that ftate employed  
four thoufand men, and twenty-eight thoufand tons of thipping, and produced  
about two hundred and fifty thoufand pounds a year.  
  
That thefe branches of bufinefs, annihilated during the war, have been, in  
fome degree, recovered fince 3 but that ‘they labour under many and heavy em-  
barraffments which, if not removed er leffened, will render the fiteries every  
year lefs extenfive and important.  
  
That thefe embarraflments are, heavy duties on their produce abroad, and  
bounties on that of their competitors s and duties at home on fevera! articles, par-  
ticularly ufed in the fifheries.  
  
And itafks that the duties be taken off—that bounties be given to the fither-  
men, and the natiomal influence be ufed abroad, for obtaining better markets for  
their produce,  
  
The cod and whale fifheries, carried on by different perfons, from different  
ports, in different veflels, in different feas, and feeking different markets, agree in  
ene circumftance, in being as unprofitable to the adventurer, as important to the  
public. A fucciné view of their rife, progrefs, and prefent Rate, with different  
nations, may enable us to note the circumftances which have attended their prof-  
perity, and their decline, to judge of the embarraffments, which are faid to op-  
prefs ours 4 to fee whether they depend on our own will, and may, therefore, be  
remedied immediately by ourfelves, or, whether, depending en the will of o-  
thers, they are without the reach of remedy, from us, either divectly or indireatly,  
  
Their hiftory being as unconneéted as their practice, they fhill be feparately  
eonfidered.

‘ Cabots, we find that the abundance of fifh on its banks, had already drawa the  
  
  
  
  
  
attention of the people of Europe. For, as early as 1517 or 1519, we are told  
of fitty thips being feen there at one time. The firft adventurers in that fithery,  
were the Bifcayans of Spain, the Bafques and Bas Bretons of France, all unit-  
ed anciently in language, and ftill in habits and inextreme poverty. The laft cir-  
cumftance enabled them long to retain a confiderable fhare of the fithery. In  
1§77, the French had one hundred and fifty veflels there; the Spaniards had  
ftill one hundred; and the Portuguefe fifty; when the Englifh had only  
fifteen. The Spaniards and Portuguefe, feem at length to have retired filently,  
the French and Englith, ciaiming the fifhery exclufively, as an appurtenance to  
their adjacent colonies, and the profits being too {mall for nations furcharg-  
ed with the precious metals proceeding from their mines.  
  
Without materials to trace the intermediate progrefs, we only know, that  
fo late as 1744, the French employed there, five hunared and fixty-four thips,  
and twenty-feven thoufand five hundred feamen ; and took one million two hun-  
dred and forty-fix thoufand kentais of fith, which was three times the extent to  
which England and her colonies together carried this fifhery at that time.  
  
The Englifh in the beginning of the feventeenth century, had employed, ge-  
nerally, about one hundred and fifty veffels in the Newfoundland fifhery. About  
1670, we find them reduced to eighty, and one hundred, the inhabitants of  
New England beginning now to fupplant them. A little before this, the Britith  
parliament, perceiving that their citizens were unable to fubfilt on the fcanty pro-  
fits which {ufficed for their poorer competitors, endeavoured to give them fome  
advantage by prohibiting the importation of foreign fifth: and, at the clofe of the  
century, they formed jome regulations for their government and proteétion : and  
remitted to them fome duties. A fuccefsful war enabled them in 1713, to force  
from the French, a ceffion of the ifland of Newfoundland. Under thefe encou-  
ragements, the Englifh and American fitheries began to thrive. In 1731, we  
find the Englith take two hundred thoufand kentals of fith, and the Americans  
two hundred and thirty thoufand, befides the refufe fith, not fit for European  
markets. They continue to gain ground, and the French to loofe it, infomuch,  
that about 1755, they are faid to have been on a par: and, 1768, the French  
had onJy two hundred and fifty-nine veflels, of twenty-four thoufand four hun-  
dred and twenty tons, nine thoufand feven hundred and twenty-two feamen, ta-  
king two hundred thoufand kentals, while America alone, for fome three or  
four years before that, and fo on to the commencement of the late war, employ-  
ed fix hundred and fixty-five veffels, of twenty-five thoufand fix hundred and  
fifty tons, and four thoufand four hundred and five feamen, and took from  
three hundred and fifty thoufand, to upwards of four hundred thoufand kentals  
of tith, and England a {till greater quantity, five hundred and twenty-fix thoufand  
kentals, as is faid.  
  
Spain had formerly relinquifhed her pretenfions to a participation in thefe fith-  
eries, at the clofe of the preceding war ; and, at the end of this, the adjacent  
continent and iflands being divided between the united ftates, the Englifh and  
French (for the laft retained two fmall iflands merely for this obje&amp;t) the right of  
fithing was appropriated to them alfo.  
  
France, fenfible of the neceflity of balancing the power of England on the  
water, and therefore, of improving every vefource for raifing feamen, and fee-  
ing that her fifhermen could not maintain their competition without fome pub-  
lic patronage, adopted the experiment of bounties on her own fith, and duties  
on that of foreign nations, brought into her markets. But notwithitanding this,  
her fifheries dwindle, from a change taken place, infenfibly, in the charaéter of  
her navigation, which, from being the moft economical, is now become the moft

this fithery, and to have taken four hundred and twenty-fix thoufand kentals ;  
and in 1787, but fix thoufand men, and one hundred and twenty-eight thoufand  
kentals. She feems not yet fenfible that the unthriftinefs of her fitheries pro-  
ceeds from the want of economy, and not the want of markets; and that the  
encouragement of our fifhery abridges that of a rival nation, whofe power on  
the ocean has long threatened the lots of all balance on that element.  
  
The plan of the Engiith government, fince the peace, has been to prohibit all  
foreign fifth in their markets, and they have given from eighteen to fifty  
pounds fterling, on every fithing veflel complying with certain conditions. This  
policy is faid to have been fo far fuccefstul as to have raifed the number of {ea-  
men employed in that bufinefs in 1716, to fourteen thouland, and the quantity  
of -fith taken, to feven hundred and thirty-two thoufand kentals. The table No.  
1, hereto annexed will prefent to the eye, this hiftory more in detail.  
  
The fihheries, of the united ftates, annibilated during the war; their veffels,  
utenfils, and fithermen deftroyed ; their markets in the Mediterranean and Bri-  
tith. America loft, their produce dutied in thofe of France, their competitors en-  
abled by bountics to meet and underfell them at the few markets remaining open,  
without any public aid, and indeed, paying ails to the pubic: fuch were the  
hopele{s aufpices under which this important bufinefs was to be refuined. Yet it  
was refumed, and aided by the mere force of natural advantages, they employ-  
ed during the years 1786,—7,—8,—g9, on an average, five hundred and thirty-  
nine veffels, of nineteen thoufand one hundred and eighty-five tons, three thou-  
fand two hundred and eighty-feven feamen, and took two hundred and fifty  
thoufand fix hundred and fifty kentals of fith: (fee Number 2.) and an official  
paper (Number 4.) fhews that in the laft of thole years, our exportation  
amounted to three hundred feventy-five thoufand and twenty kentals, and thir-  
ty thoufand four hundred fixty-one barrels, dedu&amp;tion made of three thou-  
fand feven hundred and one kentals, and fix thoufand three hundred and forty-  
three barrels of foreign fith received and re-exported. (See No. 4.) Still how-  
ever, the calculations in (No. 5.) which accompany the reprefentation, thew,  
that the profits of the fales in the years 1787,—8, were too finall to afford aliv-  
ing to the fithermen, and on thofe of 178g, there was fuck a lofs as to withdraw  
thirty-three veflels, of the town of Marblehead, alone, from the further purfuit  
of this bufinefs: And the apprehenfion is, that, without fome public aid, thofe  
fill remaining will continue to withdraw, and this whole commerce be engrofled  
by a fingle nation.  
  
This rapid view of the cod-fithery, enables us to difcern under what policy it  
has flourifhed or declined in the hands of other nations, and to mark the faét,  
that it is too poor a bufinel’s to be left to itfelf, even with the nation the moft ad-  
vantageoully fituated.  
  
It will now be proper to count the advantages which aid, and the difadvan-  
tages which oppofe us in this contelt.  
  
Our advantages are—  
  
1. The neighbourhood of the great fitheries, which permits our fifhermen to  
bring home their fith to be falted by their wives and children.  
  
2. The fhore fitheries, fo near at hand as to enable the veffels to run into  
port in a ftorm, and fo leffen the rifk, for which diftant nations muft pay infur-  
ance.  
  
3. The winter fitheries, which, like houfhold manufa&amp;tures employ portions of  
time which would otherwile be ulele/s. *  
  
4. The fmallnefs of the veffels, which the thortnefs of the voyage enables us  
to employ, and which, confequently, require but a {mall capital.  
  
5. The cheapnefs of our veffels, which do not coft above the half of the Baltie

returns.  
  
7. The fuperiority of our mariners in kill, aétivity, enterprize, fobriety,  
and order.  
  
8. The cheapnefs of provifions.  
  
9- The cheapnefs of cafks, which, of itfelf, is faid to be equal to an extra  
profit of fifteen per cent.  
  
Thete advantages are of fuch force, that while experience has proved that na  
other nation can make a mercantile profit on the Newfoundland fithery, nor can  
fupport it without national aid, we can make a living profit, if vent for our fith  
can be procured,  
  
Of the difadvantages oppofed to us, thofe which depend on ourfelves are—  
  
Tonnage and naval duties on the veflels employed in the fithery,  
Impoft duties on falt, on tea, rum, fugar, melaffes, hooks, Uted in the  
  
ines and leads, duck, cordage and cables, iron, hemp, and fither  
twine a  
  
Coarfe woollens worn by the fifhermen ; and the poll-tax levied by the ftate  
on their perfons, The ftatement (No. 6,) fhews the amount of thefe, exclufive  
of the ftate tax, and drawback on the fith exported, to be 5. 25 dollars per  
man, or 57. 75 dollars per veffel of fixty-five tons. When a bufinefs is fo near-  
ly an equilibrio, that one can hardly difcern whether the profit be fufficient to  
continue it, or not, fmaller fums than thefe fuffice to turn the f{cale againft it.  
To thefe difadvantages, add ineffectual duties on the importation of foreign fith.  
In juftification of thefe laft, it is urged that the foreign fith received, is in exchange  
for the produce of agriculture, To which it may be anfwered, that the thing  
given, is more merchantable than that received in exchange, and that agriculture  
has too many markets to be allowed to take away thofe of the fifheries. It will  
reft, therefore, with the wifdom of the legiflature, to decide, whether pro-  
hibition fhould not be oppofed to prohibition, and high duty to high duty, on the  
fith of other nations: whether any, and which of the naval and other duties,  
may be remitted, or an equivalent given to the fifherman in the form of a draws  
back cr bounty ; and whether the lofs of markets abroad may not, in fome de-  
gree, be compenfated by creating markets at home; to which might contribute  
the conflituting fifh a part of the military ration, in ftations, not too diftant  
from navigation, a part of the neceffary fea ftores of veffels, and the en-  
couraging private individuals to let the fifhermen fhare with the cultivator, in  
furnifhing the fupplies of the table. A habit introduced from motives of pa-  
triotilm, would foon be followed from motives of tafte : and who will undertake  
to fix limits to this demand, if it can be once excited, with a nation which dou.  
bles, and wiil long continue to double at very fhort periods) -  
  
Of the difadvantages, which depend on others, are—  
  
1. The lofs of the Mediterranean markets.  
  
2. Exclufions from the markets of {ome of our neighbours.  
  
3. High duties in thofe of others, and—  
  
4. Bounties to the individuals in competition with us.  
  
The confideration of thefe, will find its place more aptly, after a review of the  
eondition of our whale fifhery, fhall haveled us to the fame point. To this  
branch of the fubje&amp;, therefore, we will now proceed.  
  
The whale fifhery was fir brought into notice of the fouthern nations of Eu-  
rope, in the fifteenth century, by the fame Bifcayans and Bafques, wholed the  
way tothe fithery of Newfoundland. They began it on their own coafts, but  
foon found that the principal refidence of the whale, was in the northern feas,  
into which, therefore, they purfued him. In 1578, they employed twenty-five  
  
fhips in that bufinefs; the Dutch and Hamburghers took it up after this, and

and about the middle of the feventeenth century, the former employed about twe  
hundred thips, and the latter three hundred and fifty.  
  
The Englith endeavoured alfo to participate of it. In 1692%, they offered te  
their own fithermen, a bounty of fix fhillings a ton, on the oil they thould bring  
home ; and inftituted at different times, different exclufive companies, all of which  
failed of fuctefs. They raifed their bounty in 1733}, to twenty fhillingsa ton  
onthe admeafurement of the veffel. In 1740, to thirty fhillings with a privis  
Jege to the fithermen againft being impreffed. The Bafque-fithery, fupported by  
poverty alone, had maintained, but a feeble exiltence, before competitors, aided by  
the bounties of their nation, and was, in fine, annihilated by the war of 17459  
at the clofe of which, the Englith bounty was raifed to forty fhillings. From  
this epoch, their whale fithery went on between the limits of twenty-eight and  
fixty-feven veffels, till the commencement of the laft war.  
  
The Dutch, in the mean time, had declined gradually to about one hjin-  
dred and thirty thips, and have fince that, fallen down to lefs than half that  
aumber: fo that their fithery, notwithftanding a bounty of thirty florins a  
man, as well as that of Hamburgh, is now, nearly out of competition.  
  
In 1735, the Americans began their whale fithery. They weve led to it at  
firft by the whales which prefented themfelves on their coafts. They attacked  
them there in fmall veffels of forty tons. Asthe whale, being infefted, retired  
from the coaft, they followed him farther and farther into the ocean, ftill en-  
Jarging their veffels, with their adventures, to fixty, one hundred and two  
hundred tons. Having extended their purfuit to the weitern iflands, they fell in  
accidentally with the fpermacati whale, of a differcnt {pecies from that of Green-  
Jand, which alone, had been hitherto known in commerce; more fierce and  
active, and whofe oil and head matter was found to be more valuable, as it  
might be ufed in the interior of houfes, without offending the fmell. The dif-  
tinction now firft arofe between the northern and fouthern fifherics ; the obje&amp;  
of the former, being the Greenland whale, which frequents the norther coafts  
and feas of Europe and America, that of the latter being the {permacati whale,  
which was found in the fouthern feas, from the weitern iflands, and coatt ot  
Africa to that of Brazil, and ftiil on to the Faulkland iflands. Here again,  
within foundings, on the coaft of Brazil, they found a third fpecies of whale,  
which they called the black or Brazil whale, fmailer than the Greenland ;  
yielding a {till lefs valuable oil, fit only for fummer ule, as it becomes opaque  
at fifty degrees of Favrenheit’s thermometer, while that of the {permaceti whale  
is limped to forty one, and of the Greenland whale to thirty-fix, of the fame  
thermometer. Jt is only worth taking therefore, when it falls in the way of  
the fihhermen, but not worth feeking, except when they have failed of fuccefe  
againit the fpermaceti whale, in which cafe, this kind, eafily found and taken,  
ferves to moderate their lofs.  
  
In 1971, the Americans had one hundred and eighty-three veffels, of thirteen  
thoufand eight hundred and twenty tons, in the northern fifhery, and one hun-  
dred and twenty-one veflels, of fourteen thoufand and twenty tons, in the fou-  
thern ; navigated by four thoufand and fifty-nine men. Atthe beginning of  
the late war, they had one hundred and feventy-feven veflcis in the northern, and  
one hundred and thiity-two inthe fouthern fithery.  
  
At that period, our fifhery being fufpended, the Englith feized the opportunity  
of puthing theirs. They gave additional bounties of five hundved, four hune  
dred, three hundred, two hundred, one hundred pounds fterling, annuily, to  
the five thips, which fhould take the greateft quantities of oil. The eect cf whigh

was fuch, 2s, by the year 1786, to double the quantity of common oil, ne-  
ceflary for their own confumption. Finding, on a review of the fubjeét, at that  
time, that their bounties had coft the government thirteen pounds ten fhillings  
fterling, aman annually, or fixty percent. on the cargoes, a part of which went  
confequently to eafe the purchates of this article made by foreign natioas, they  
reduced the northern bounty from forty to thirty fliilings the ton, of admea-  
furement.  
  
They had fome iittle time before turned their attention to the fouthern fithery,  
had given very great bounties in it*, and had invited the fithermen of the united  
ftates to conduct their enterprifes. Under their guidance, and with fuch escou-  
ragement, this filhery, which had only begun with them in 17%4 or 1785, was  
rifing into value. In 1788, they increafed + their bounties, and the temptations  
to our fifhermen, under the general defcription of foreigners who had been em-  
ployed in the whale fifhery, to pals over with their families and veficls to the  
Britihh domin ons either in America or Europe, but preterably to the latter.  
The effe&amp;t of theie meafures hal been prepared by our whale ols becoming  
fubje&amp;, in their market, to the foreign duty of eighteen pounds five fhillings  
fterling, the ton, which, beimg morethan equal to the price of the commen oil,  
operated as a prohibitionjon that,.and gave to their own {permaczeti oil, a prefer.  
ence over ours tothat amount. The particulars of this hiftory are prefented to  
the eye, more in detail, in the tabie, No. 7.  
  
The fithhermen of the united ftates, left without refource by the lofs of theie  
market, began to think of accepting the British invitation, and of removing —  
fome to Nova Scotic, preferring fmalier advantages in the neighbourhood of their  
ancient country and frends, others to Great Britain, poflponing country and  
friends to high premiums.  
  
The government of France could not be inattentive to thefe proceedings,  
They faw the danger of letting four or five thouiand feamen, of the beft in the  
world, be transferred to the marine ftrength of another nation, and carry over  
with them an art, which they pofleffed almoft excluiively. To give time for a  
counter-plan, the marquis de la Fayette, the valuable friend and citizen of this,  
as well as that country, wrote to a gentleman in Botton to diffuade the fither-  
men from accepting the Britith propoials, and to affure them that their friends  
in France, would endeavour do fomethimg for them. A veflel was then ar-  
rived trom Haiifax, at Nantucket, to take off thofe, who had propofed to remove.  
Two famiiies had gone aboard, and others were going. In this moment, the  
letter arriving, fufpended thew defigns. Not another went aboard, and the vefiel  
returned to Halifax with only the two families.  
  
The plan adopted by the French miniftry, very different from that of the firtt  
mover, was to give a counter invitation to the Nantucket men to remove and fet-  
tle in Dunkirk, «ffering a bounty of fifty livres (between nine and ten dollars) a  
ton on the admeaiurement of the veflels they fhould equip for the whale-fithery,  
with tome other advantages.. Nine families only, of thirty-three perfons, ac-

veflels for the fouthern fithery average one hundred and forty tons, and coft,  
when built, fitted out, and viétualled, for their firft voyage, about fix thoufand  
five hundred dollars. They have taken on an average, the three laft years, ac-  
eording to the fame ftatement, thirty-two tons of oil, each worth at our market,  
three thoufand two hundred dollars, which are in like manner, to pay all ex-  
penfes, and fubfift the owners and navigators. Thefe expenfes are great, as the  
voyages are generally of twelve months duration. No hope can arife of their  
condition being bettered by an augmentation of the price of oil. This is kept  
down by the compet.tion of the vegetable oils, which anfwer the fame purpofes,  
not quite fo well, bu well enough to become preferable, were the price to be  
raifed, and fo well indeed as to be more generally ufed than the fith oils for  
lightning houies and cities.  
  
The American whale fifhery is principally followed by the inhabitants of  
the ifland of Nantucket, a fand bar of about fifteen miles long and three broad  
eapable of maintaining by its agriculture about twenty families : but it employ-  
ed in thefe fitheries before the war, between five and fix thoufand men and boys ;  
and in the only harbour it pofleffes, it had one hundred and forty veflels, one  
hundred and thirty-two of which were of the larger kind, as being employed in  
the fouthern fithery. In agriculture then, they have no refource, and, if that of  
their fifhery cannot be purfued from their own inhabitants, it is natural that  
they fhould feek others, from which it can be followed, and preferably thofe  
where they will find a famenefs of Janguage, religion, laws, habits, and kin-  
dred, A foreign emiffury has lately been among them, for the purpole of re-  
mewing the invitations to a changeof fituation. But attached to their native  
country, they prefer continuing in it, if their continuance there, can be made  
fupportable.  
  
This brings us to the queftion, what relief does the condition of this fihhery  
require?  
  
aft. Aremiffion of duties on the articles ufed for their calling.  
  
ed. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to feek a competition with thena  
in or from our ports.  
  
3d. Free markets abroad.  
  
aft. The remiffion of duties will ftand on nearly the fame ground, with that  
to the cod fifhermen.  
  
ad. The only nation whofe oil is brought hither for competition with our  
ewn, makes ours pay a duty of about eighty-two dollars the ton, in their  
ports. Their’s is brought here too, to be re-fhipped fraudulently, under our  
flag into ports where it could not be received under theirs, and ought not to be  
covered by ours, if we mean to preferve our own admiffion intothem. The  
  
3d. And principal object, is to find markets for the vent of oil.  
  
Pertugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Pruffia, Ruffia, the Hanfe  
towns, fupply themfelves and fome:hing more. Spain and Italy receive fupplies  
from England, and need the lefs as their fkies are clearer. France is the only coun-  
try which can take our furplus, and they take principally of the common oil ;  
as the habit is but commencing with them of afcribing a juft value to that of  
the fpermaczti whale. Some of this, however, finds its vent there. There was,  
indeed, a particular intercft perpetually foliciting the exclufion of our oils fron  
their markets. The late government there faw well, that what we fhould lofe  
thereby, would be gained by others, not by theralelves. And we are to hope  
that the prefent government, as wifely and friendly, will alfo view us, not as ri-  
vals, but as co-operators againft a common riva!. Friendly arrangements with  
them, and accommod tion to mutual intereft, rendered eafier by friendly difpof-

fectuatung free markets for them ; that for the great proportion of our falted th,  
for our commer oil, and part of our fpermaczti oil, markets may, perhaps, be  
preferved by friendly arrangements towards thofe nations whofe arrangements  
ave friendly to us; and the refidue be compenfated by giving to the feamea

HE fecretary of ftate, to whom was referred, by the houfe of reprefentatives, the  
reprefentation from the gencral court of the commonwealth of Maffachufetts, on  
the fubjects of the cod and whale fitheries, together with the fevere! papers accompany-  
ing it, has had the fame under confideration, and thereupon makes the following—  
R27 OR, Tig  
  
The reprefentation fets forth, that, before the late war, about four thoufand feamen,  
and twenty-four thoufand tons of thipping, were annually employed, from that fate,  
in the whale fithery, the produce whereof was about three hundred and fifty thoufand  
pounds, lawful money, a year.  
  
That, previous to the fame period, the cod fithery of that flate employed four thou-  
fand men, and twenty-eight thoufand tons of thipping, and produced about two hun.  
dred and fifty thoufand pounds a year  
  
That thefe branches of bufinefs, annihilated during the war, have been, in fome de-  
gree, recovered fince; but that they labour under many and heavy embarraffments,  
which, if not removed or leflened, will render the fifheries every year lets extenfive  
and important.  
  
That thefe embarraflments are, heavy duties on their produce abroad, and boun-  
ties on that of their competitors: and duties at home on feveral articles, particularly  
ufed in the fitheries.  
  
And it afks that the duties be taken off—that bounties be given to the fithermen,  
and the national influence be ufed abroad, for obtaining better markets for their pro-  
duce.  
  
‘The cod and whale fitherics, carried on by different perfons, from different ports,  
in different veffels, in different feas, and feeking different markets, agree in one cir-  
cumitance, in being as unprofitable to the adventurer, as important to the public. A  
fuccinét view of their rile, progrels, and prelent Rate, with different nations, may ena-  
ble ws to note the circumftances which have attended their profperity, and their de-  
cline, to judge of the embarraflments, which are faid to opprefs ours ; to fee whether  
they depend on our own will, and may, therefore, be remedied immediately by our-  
felves, or, whether, depending on the will of others, they are without the reach of  
remedy, from us, either dire€ly or indiredtly.  
  
Their hiftory beiry as unconnected as their practice, they fhall be feparately confi-  
dered.  
  
Within twenty years after the fuppofed difcovery of Newfoundland, by the Cabots,  
we find that the abundance of fith on its banks, had already drawn the attention of  
the people of Europe. For, as early as 1517 or 1519, we are told of fifty thips being  
feen there at one time. ‘The firft adventurers in that fithery, were the Bifcayans of  
Spain, the Bafques and Bas-Bretons of France, all united anciently in language, and  
ftill in habits, and in extreme poverty. ‘The laft circumftance enabled them long to  
retain a confiderable fhare of the fifhery. In 1577, the French had one hundred and  
fifty veficls there; the Spaniards had ftill one hundred; and the Portuguefe fifty,  
when the E glith had only fifteen. The Spaniards and Portuguefe feem at length  
to have retired filently, the French and Englifh claiming the fithery exclufively, as  
an appurtenance to their adjacent colonies, and the profits being too {mall for nations  
furcharged with the precious metals proceeding from their mines.  
  
Without materials to trace the intermediate progrefs, we only know, that fo late  
as 1744, the French employed there, five hundred and fixty-four thips, and twenty-fe-  
ven thoufand five hundred feamen; and took one million two hundred and forty-fix  
thoufand kentals of fith, which was three times the extent to which England and her  
colonies together carried this fithery at that time.  
  
The Englith, in the beginning of the feventeenth century, had employed, generally,  
about one hundred and fifty vellels in the Newfoundland fifhery. About 1670, we

find them reduced to eighty, and one hundred, the inhabitants of New-Engiand be-  
giuning now to fupplant them. A little before this, the Britith parliament, perceiv-  
ing that their citizens were unable to fubfift on the fcanty profits which fufficed for  
their poorer competitors, endeavoured to give them fome advantage by prohibiting  
the importation of foreign fith : and, at the clofe of the century, they formed fome re-  
gulations for their government and protection ; and remitted to them fome duties.  
A fuccefsful war enabled them in 1713, to force fromthe French, a ceflion of the if-  
land of Newfoundland. Under thefe encourayements, the Englith and American fifh-  
eries began to thrive. In 1731, we find the Englith take two hundred thoufand ken~-  
tals of fifth, and the Americans two hundred and thirty thoufand, befides the refufe  
fith, not fit for European markets. They continue to gain ground, and the French to  
Jofe it, infomuch, that about 1755, they are faid to have been on a par : and, in 1768,  
the French had only two hundred and fifty-nine veffels, of twenty-four thoufand four  
hundred and twenty tons, nine thoufand feven hundred and twenty-two feamen, tak-  
ing two hundred thoufand kentals, while America, alone, for fome three or four years  
before that, and fo on to the commencement of the late war, employed fix hundred  
and fixty-five veflels, of twenty-five thoufand fix hundred and fifty tons, and four thou-  
fand four hundred and five icamen, and took from three hundred and fifty thoufand,  
to upwards ef four hundred thoufand kentals, of fith, and England a ftill greater quan-  
tity, five hundred and twenty-fix choufand kemtals, as is faid.  
  
Spain had formerly relinquifhed her pretenfions to a participation in thefe fitherics,  
at the clofe of the preceding war ; and,at the end of this, the adjacent continent and  
iflands being divided between the united ftates, the Englifh and French, (for the laft  
retained two {mall iflands merely for this ubje&amp;) the right of fithing was appropriat-  
ed to them alfo.  
  
France, fenfible of the neceflity of balancing the power of England on the water,  
and, therefore, of improving every refource for raifing feamen, and fecing that her  
fifhermen could not maintain their competition without fome public patronage, adopt-  
ed the experiment of bounties on her own fifth, and duties on that of foreign nations,  
brought into her markets. But notwithitanding this, her fitheries dwindle, from a  
change taken place, infenfibly, in the character of her navigation, which, from being  
the moft economical, is now become the mok expenfive. In 1786, the is faid to have  
employed but feven thoufand men in this fifhery, and to have taken four hundred and  
twenty-fix thoyfand kentals: and in 1787, but fix thoufand men, and one hundred and  
twenty-eight thouland kentals. She feems not yet fenfible that the unthriftinefs vf  
her fisheries proceeds from the want of economy, and not the want of markets; and  
that the encouragement of our ffhery abridges that of a rival nation, whofe power on  
the ocean has long threatened the lofs of all balance on that element.  
  
The plan of the Englith government, fince the peace, has been to prohibit all foreign  
fith in their markets, and they have given from eighteen to fifty pounds fterling, on  
every fithing veffel complying with certain conditions, This policy is faid to have  
been fo far fuccefsful,as to have raifed the number of feamen employed in that bufi-  
nefs in 1786, to fourteen thoufand, and the quantity of fith taken, to feven hundred  
and thirty-two thoufand kentals. The table No. 1, hereto annexed, will prefent to  
the eye, this hiftory more in detail.  
  
The fither&#x27;es of the united ttates, annihilated during the war; their veffels, utenfils,  
and fifhermen deitroyed; their markets inthe Mediterranean and Britith- America lef ;  
their produce dutied in thofe of France; their competitors enabled by bounties to meet  
and underfell them at the few markets remaining open ; without any public aid, and  
indeed, paying aids to the public: fuch were the hopelefs aufpices under which this  
important bufinefs was to be refumed, Yet it was refumed, and, aided by the mere  
force of natural advantages, they employed, during the ycars 1786,--7,--3,--9, on an  
average, five hundred and thirty-nine veflels, of nineteen thoufand one hundred and  
eighty-five tons, three thoufand two hundred and eighty-feven feamen, and took two

1737,—8, were too {mall to afford a living to the fithermen, and on thofe of 178  
there was fuch a lofs as to withdraw thirty-three veflels, of the town of Marblehead  
alone, from the further purfuit of this bufnefs : And the apprehenfion is, that, with.  
out fome public aid, thofe ftill remaining will continue to withdraw, and this whele  
commerce be engrofled by a fingle nation.  
  
This rapid view of the cod-fithery, enables us to difcern under what policy it hay  
flourifhed or declined in the hands of other nations, and to mark the fa@, that it js  
too poor a bufinets to be left to itfelf, even with the nation the moft ad vantageoufly  
fituated.  
  
It will now be proper to count the advantages which aid, and the difadvantage,  
which oppofe us in this conteft.  
  
Our advantages are---  
  
1. The neighbourhood of the great fitheries, which permits our fifhermen to bring  
home their fith to be falted by their wives and children,  
  
2. The fhore fitheries, fo near at hand as to enable the veffels to run into port in  
a ftorm, and fo leffen the rifk, for which diftant nations muft pay infurance.  
  
3- The winter fifheries, which, like houfhold manufactures, employ portions of time  
which would otherwite be ufclefs.  
  
4. The fmallnefs of the veffels, which the fhortnefs of the voyage enables us to  
employ, and which, confequently, require but a fmall capital.  
  
5. The cheapnefs of our veffels, which do not coft above the half of the Baltic fir  
veflels, computing price and duration.  
  
6. Their excellence as fea-boats, which decreafes the rik, and quickens the re.  
turn.  
  
7. The fuperiority of our mariners in kill, aivity, enterprize, fubriety and  
order. :  
  
8. The cheapnefs of provifions.  
  
9. The cheapnets of catks, which, of itfelf, is faid to be equal to an extra profit of  
fifteen per cent.  
  
Thefe advantages are of fuch force, that, while experience has proved that no other  
mation can make a mercantile profit on the Newfoundland fithery, nor can fupport it  
without national aid, we can make a living profit, if vent for our fith can be  
procured,  
  
Of the difadvantages oppofed to us, thofe which depend on ourfelves are---  
  
‘Tonnage and naval duties on the veflcls employed in the fithery.  
  
Impof duties on falt, on tea, rum, fugar, melafles, hooks, lines and leads, duck,  
cordage and cables, iron, hemp, and twine, ufed in the fithery.  
  
Coarfe woollens worn by the fithermen ; and the poll-tax levied by the ftate on  
their perfons. ‘The fatement, No.6. thews the amount of thefe, exclufive of the  
ftate tax, and drawback on the fith exported, to be 5. 25 dollars per man, or 57. 75  
dollars per vellel of fixty-five tons. When a bufinefs is fo nearly in equilibrio, that  
one can hardly difcern whether the profit be fufficient to continue it, or not, fmallec  
fums than thefe fuffice to tura the fcale againft it. To thefe difadvantages, add in-  
effe@tual duties on the importation of foreign fith. In juftification of thefe laf, it is  
urged that the foreign fith received, is in exchange for the produce of agriculture.  
‘To which it may be anfwered, that the thing given is more merchantable than that  
received in exchange, and that agriculture has too many markets to be allowed to  
take away thofe of the fitheries. It will reft, therefore, with the wifdom of the le-  
giflature, to decide, whether prohibition fhould not be oppofed to prohibition, and  
high duty to high duty, on the fith of other nations : whether any, and which, of the  
naval and other duties, may be remitted, or an equivalent given to the fifhermen im  
the form of a drawback or bounty ; and whether the lofs of markets abroad may not,  
in fome degree, be compenfated by creating markets at home ; to which might con-  
tribute the conftituting fifh a part of the military ration, in flations not too diftant  
from navigation, a part of the neceflary fea-ftores of veflels, and the. encouraging  
private individuals to let the fifhermen thare with the cultivator, in furnithing the  
fupplies of the table. A habit introduced from motives of patriotifm, would foon be  
followed from motives of taite : and who will uidertake to fix limits to this demand,  
if it can be once excited, with a nation which doubles, and will long continu to  
double, at very thort periods?

OF the difadvantages which depend on others, are—  
  
x. The lofs of the Mediterranean markets.  
  
2. Exclufions from the markets of fome of our neighbours,  
  
3. High duties in thofe of others, and—  
  
4 Bounties to the individuals in competition with us.  
  
The confideration of thefe will find its place more aptly, after a review of the con-  
dition of our whale fifhery {hall have led us to the fame point. To this branch of  
the fubje@, therefore, we will now proceed.  
  
The whale fithery was firft brought into notice of the fouthern nations of Europe,  
in the fifteenth century, by the fame Bifcayans and Bafques, who led the way to the  
fifhery of Newfoundland. They began it on their own coafts, but foon found that  
the principal refidence of the whale was in the northern feas, into which, therefore,  
they purfued him. In 1578, they empleyed twenty-five thips in that bufinels ; the  
Dutch and Hamburghers took it up after this, and ahout the middle of the feven-  
teenth century, the former employed about two hundred hips, and the latter three  
hundred and fifty.  
  
The Englith endeavoured alfo to participate of it. In 1672&quot;, they offered to their  
own fifhermen, a bounty of fix fhillings a ton, on the oil they fhould bring home ;  
and inftituted at different times, different exclufive companies, all of which failed of  
fuccefs. They raifed their bouuty in 1733+, to tweaty fhillings a ton on the ad-  
meafurement of the veffel. In 1740, to thirty fhillings, with a privilege to the fifher-  
men againft being impreffed. The Bafque-fithery, fupported by poverty alone, had  
maintained but a feeble exiftence, before competitors, aided by the bounties of their  
nation, and was, in fine, annihilated by the war of 1945, at the clofe of which, the  
Englifh bounty was raifed to forty fhillings. From this epoch, their whale fithery  
went on between the limits of twenty-eight and fixty feven veflels, till the com-  
mencement of the laft war.  
  
The Dutch, in the mean time, had declined gradually to about one hundred and  
thirty fhips, and have, fince that, fallen down to lefs than half that number : fo thae  
their fithery, notwithftanding a bounty of thirty florins a man, as well as that of Ham-  
burgh, is now nearly out of competition.  
  
In 1715,the Americans began their whale fifhery. They were led to it at fir by  
the whales which prefented themfelves on their coafts. They attacked them there ia  
{mall veffels of forty tons. As the whale, being infefled, retired from the coaft, they  
followed him farther and farther into the ocean, ftill enlarging their veffels, with their  
adventures, to fixty, one hundred, and two hundred tons. Having extended their  
purfuit to the weftern iflands, they fell in accidentally with the fpermacati whale, of  
a different fpecies from that of Greenland, which alone, had been hitherto known in  
commerce ; more fierce and active, and whofe oil and head matter was found to be  
more valuable, as it might be ufed in the interior of houfes, without offending the  
fmell. The diftinction now firft arofe between the northern and fouthern fihheries ;  
the object of the former, being the Greenland whale, which frequents the northera  
coafts and feas of Europe and America, that of the latter being the fpermacxti whak,  
which was found in the fouthern feas, from the weftern iflands, and coaft of Africa to  
that of Brazil, and ftill on to the Faulkiand iflands. Here again, within foundings,  
on the cvaft of Brazil, they found a third fpecies of whale, which they called the black  
or Brazil whale, {maller than the Greenland : yielding a ftill lefs valuable oil, fit on-  
ly for fummer ufe, as it becomes opaque at fifty degrees of Farenheit’s thermometer,  
while that of the fpermacati whale is limpid to forty-one, and of the Greenland  
whale to thirty-fix, of the fame thermometer. It is only worth taking therefore,  
when it falls in the way of the fifhermen, but not worth fecking, except when they  
have failed of fuccefs againft the fpermaceti whale, in which cafe, this kind, cafily  
found and taken, ferves to moderate their lofs.  
  
In 1771, the Americans had onc hundred and eighty-three veffels, of thirteen  
thoufand eight hundred and twenty tons, in the northern fithery, and one hundred and  
twenty-one veffels, of fourteen thoufand and twenty tons, in the fouthern; navigated  
by four thoufand and fifty-nine men. At the beginning of the late war, they had one  
hundred and feventy-feven veficls in the northern, and ome hundred and thirty-two  
in the fouthern fifhery.

274 Political Regifter.  
  
At that period, our fithery being fufpended, the Englith feized the opportunity of  
pufhing theirs. ‘They gave additional bounties of five hundred, four hundred, three  
hundred, two huntired, and one hundred pounds fterling, annually, to the five thips  
which fhould take the greateft quantities of oil. The effect of which was fuch, as, by  
the year 1786, to double the Quantity of common oil, neceflary for their own confump.  
tion. Finding, ona review of the fubje.2, at that time, that their bounties had cof  
the government thirteen pounds ten fhillings fterling a man, annually, or fixty per  
cent. on the cargoes,a part of which went confequently to eafe the purchafes of this  
article made by foreign nations, they reduced the northern bounty from forty to thir.  
ty fhillings the ton, of admeafurement.  
  
, They had fome little time before turned their attention to the fouthern fithery, had  
given very great bounties in t*, and had invited the fifhermen of the united tkates to  
conduét their wfiterprifes. Under their guidance, and with fuch encouragement, this  
fifhery, which had only begun with them in 1784 or 1785, was rifing into value. In  
1738, they increafed} their bounties, and the temptations to our fithermen, under the  
eeneral defcription of foreigners who had been employed in the whale fifhery, to pafs  
ever with their families and veffels to the Britifh dominions, either in America or  
Europe, but preferably to the latter. The effe@ of thefe meafures had been prepared  
by our whale oil’s becoming fubject, in their market, to the foreign duty of eighteen  
pounds five fhillings Rerling the ton, which, being more than equal to the price of the  
common oil, operated as a prohibition on that, and gave to their own fpermacati oil,  
a preference over ours tothat amount. ‘The particulars of this hiftory are prefented  
to the eye, more in detail, in the table No. 7.  
  
lhe fithermen of the united fates, left without refource by the lofs of their market,  
began to think of accepting the Britith invitation, and of removing—fome to Nova.  
Scotia, preferring fmaller advantages in the neighbeurhood of their ancient coun.  
try vad friends, others to Great Britain, poftponing country and friends to high  
Pp! miums.  
  
(he government of France could nat be inattentive to thefe proceedings. They  
{iw the danger of letting four or five thoufand feamen, of the beft in the world, be  
transferred to the marine ftrength of another nation, and carry over with them an  
art, which they poffeffed almolt exclufively. To give time for a counter-plan, the  
marquis de la Fayette, the valuable friend and citizen of this, as well as that country,  
wrote to agentleman in Boftoa to difluade the fifhermen from accepting the Britihh  
propofals, and to affure them that their friends in France would endeavour to do  
fomething for them. A veffel was then arrived from Halifax, at Nantucket, to take  
off thole who had propofed to remove. Two families had gone aboard, and others  
were &lt;. In this moment, the letter arriving fufpended their defigns. Not  
another went aboard, and the veilel returned to Halifax, with only the two  
families.  
  
The plan adopted by the French miniftry, very different from that of the firk  
mover, Was to give a counter-invitation to the Nantucket men to remove and fettle  
in Dunkirk, offering a bounty of fifty lvres (between nine and ten dollars) a ton on  
the admeafurement of the veffeis they fhould equip for the whale-fifhery, with fome  
other advantages. Nine families only, of thirty-three perfons, accepted this invita  
tion ‘This was in1785. In 1786,the miniftry were led to fee, that their invitation  
would produce but little effeQ, and that the true means of preventing the emigration  
of our fifhermen to the British dominions, would be to enable them ftill to follow their  
calling from their native couutry, by giving them a new market for their oils, inftead  
of the old one they had loft. The duties were, therefore, abated on American whale  
oil immediately, and a further abatement promifed by the letter No. 8; and in  
December, 1787, the arret No. 9. was paffed.  
  
the rival filsermen immediately endeavoured to turn this meafure to their own  
advantage, by pouring their whale oils into the markets of France, where they were  
enabled, by the great premiums received from their government, perhaps too by ex-  
traordinary indefnifications, to underfell both the French and American fifhermer.  
‘To repel this meafure, France fhut her ports to all foreign fith oils whatever, by the  
arret No. :o, The Britifh whale fifhery fell, in confequence, the enfuing year, from  
two hundred and twenty-two, to one hundred and feventy-cight fhips, But this ge-

own habitations, it is natural that they fhould feek others, from which it can be  
followed, and preferably thofe where they will find a famenefs of language, religion,  
Jaws, habits, and kindred. A foreign emiflary has lately been among them, for the  
purpofe of renewing the invitations to a change of fituation. But attached to their  
native country, they prefer continuing in it, if their continuance there can be made  
fupportable.  
  
This brings us to the queftion, what relief does the condition of this fihery  
require ?  
  
rit. A remiffion of duties on the articles ufed for their calling.  
  
ad. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to feck a competition with them  
in or from our ports.  
  
3d. Free markets abroad.  
  
1ft. The remiflion of duties will ftand on nearly the fame ground with that te  
the cod fifhermen.  
  
2d, The only nation whofe oil is brought hither for competition with our own,  
makes ours pay a duty of about cighty-two dollars the ton, in their ports. Theirs  
is brought here too, to be re-fhipped, fraudulently, under our flag, into ports where  
it could not be received under theirs, and ought not to be covered by ours, if we mean  
te preferve our own admiflion into them. The  
  
3d. And principal obje&amp;, is to find markets for the vent of oil.  
  
Portugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Pruflia, Ruffia, the Hanfe towns,  
fupply themfelves and fomething more. Spain and Italy receive fupplies from  
England, and need the lefs as their fkies are clearer. France is the only country  
which can take our furplus, and they take principally of the common oil ; as the habit  
is but commencing with them of afcribing a juft value to that of the fpermacati  
whale. Some of this, however, finds its vent there. There was, indeed, a particular  
iuterelt perpetually foliciting the exclufion of our oils from their markets. The late  
government there faw weil, that what we fhould lofe thereby, would be gained by  
others, not by themfelves. And we are to hope that the prefent government, as wife-  
ly and friendly, will alfo view us, not as rivals, but as co-operators againft a common  
rival. Friendly arrangements with them, and accommodation to mutual intereft,  
rendered eafier by frien #y difpofitions exifting on both fides, may long fecure to us  
this important refource for our feamen. Nor is it the intereft of the fifhermen alone,  
which calls for the cultivation of friendly arrangements with that nation. Befides  
five-eighths of our whale oil, and two-thirds of our falted fith, they take from us one-  
fourth of our tobacco, three-fourths of our live-ftock, (No. 14,) a confiderable and  
growing portion of our rice, great fupplies occafionally of other grain; in 1789,  
which, indeed, was extraordinary, four millions of bufhels of wheat, and upwards of a  
million of bufhels of rye and barley (No. 15,)and nearly the whole carried in our own  
veffels, (No. 16.) They are a free market now ; and will in time be a valuable one for  
our fhips and thip-timber, potafh and peltry.  
  
England is the market for the greater part of our fpermaceti oil. They impofe  
on ail our oils, a duty of eighteen pounds five fhillings fterling the ton, which, as to  
the common kind, is a prohibition, as has been before obferved, and as to that of the  
fpermaceti, gives a preference of theirs over ours to that amuunt, fo as to leave, in the  
end, but a feanty benefit to the fifhermen : and not long fince»by a change of con-  
ftruction, without any change of the law, it was made to exclude our oils from their  
ports, when carried in our own ¢effels. On fome change of circumftance, it was  
con(trued back again to the reception of our oils ; on paying always, however, the  
fame duty of eighteen pounds five fhillings. This ferves to thew, that the tenure, by  
which we hold the admiflion of this commodity in their markets, is as precarious 4s  
it ishard. Nor can it be announced, that there is any difpofition on their part to  
arrange this or any other commercial matter, to mutual convenience. ‘The exparte  
regulations, which they have begun, for mounting their navigation on the ruins of  
ours, can only be oppofed by counter-regulations on our part. And the lofs of fea-  
men, the natural conlequence of Joft and obftructed markets for our fith and oil, calls,  
in the firft place, for ferious and timely attention. It will be too late, when the fea-  
man fhail have changed his vocation, or gone over to another intereft. If we cannot  
recover and fecure for him thofe important branches of employment, it behooves  
us to replace them by others equivalent. We have three uurferics for forming

E N C B, too, would follow, that their Newfoundland fhips, not receiving  
  
provifions from us in their bottoms, nor permitted (by a law of their own)  
to receive in ours, muft draw their fubfiftence from Europe, which would increafe  
that part of their expenfes in the proportion of four to feven, and fo far operate as a  
duty towards rettoring the level between them and ws. The tables, No. 2, and 12,  
will thew the quantity of tonnage, and confequently the mafsof feamen whofe in-  
terefts are in diftrefs ; and No. 17, the materials for indemnification.  
  
If regulations, exactly the counterpart of thofe eftablithed again us, would be in-  
effeual, from a differcnce of circumfances, other regulations &lt;quivalent can give no  
reafonable ground of complaint to any nation. Admitting their right of kceping  
their markets to themfcives, ours cannot be denied of keeping our carrying trade  
to ourfelves. And if there be any thing unfriendly in this, it was in the firft  
example.  
  
The lofs of feamen unnoticed, would be followed by other loffes in a long train.  
If we have no feamen, our fhips wiil be ufelefs, confequently our fhip-timber, iron  
and hemp—our thip-building will be at an end—thip-carpenters go over to other  
nations—our young men have no call to the fea—our produce carried in foreign bot-  
toms, be faddled with war freight and infurance in times of war: and the hiftory of  
the laft one hundred years fhows, that the nation which is our carrier has three years  
of war for every four years of peace. (No. 18.) We lofe, during the fame periods,  
the carriage for belligerent powers, which the neutrality of our flag would render an  
incalculable fource of profit : we lofe at this moment the carriage of our.own produce,  
to the annual amount of two millions of dollars, which, in the poflible progrefs of the  
encroachment, may extend to five or fix millions, the worth of the whole, with an  
increafe in the proportion of the increafe of our numbers. It is eafier, as well as bet~  
ter, to ftop this train at its entrance, than when it fhall have ruined or bamiihed whole  
claffes of ufeful and induftrious citizens.  
  
It will, doubtlefs, be thought expedient, that the refemption fuggefted fhould take  
effe&amp;t fo gradually as not to endanger the lofs of produce for the want of tranfporta~  
tion : but that, in order to cfeate tranfportation, the whole plan fhould be developed,  
and made known at once, that the individuals, who may be difpofed to lay thems  
felves out for the carrying bufinefs, may make their calculations on a full view of all  
circumftances.  
  
On the whole, the hiftorical view we have taken of thefe fifheries, proves they ar  
fo poor in themfelves as to come to nothing with diftant nations, who do not fupport  
them from their treafury. We have fecn, that the advantages of our pofition place  
our fitheries on a ground fomewhat higher, fuch as to relieve our treafury from the  
neceflity of giving them fupport, but not to permit it to draw fupport from them, net  
to difpenfe the government from the obligation of effetuating free markets for  
them, that for the great proportion of our falted fith, for our common oil, and part  
of our fpermaczxti oil, markets may, perhaps, be preferved by friendly arrangements  
towards thofe nations whofe arrangements are friendly to us; and the relidue be  
compenfated by giving to the feamen thrown out of bufivels the certaiaty of employ-  
ment in another branch, of which we have the fole difpofal.

the French, a cession of the island of Newfoundland.  
Under these encouragements, the English and Ame.  
rican fisheries began to thrive. In 1731, we find the  
English take two hundred thousand kentals of fish,  
and the Americans two hundred and thirty thousand,  
besides the refuse fish, not fit for European markets,  
They continue to gain ground, and the French to

thousand four hundred and twenty tons, nine thou-  
sand. seven hundred and twenty-two seamen, taking  
two hundred thousand kentals, while America alone,  
for some three or four years before that, and so on

hundred and sixty-five vessels, of twenty-five thou-

hension is, that, without some public aid, those still

rated. pert gem Mali 2%  
It will now be proper to count the advantages

this contest. :  
Our advantages are—  
1. The neighborhood of the great fisheries,. which  
mits our fishermen to bring home their fish to be  
ited by their. wives and children.  
2. The shore fisheries, so near at hand as to enable  
&gt; vessels to run into port in a storm, am so lessen  
risk, for which distant nations must pay insu-  
nce.  
5. The winter fisheries, which, like household  
nufactures employ portions of time which would  
erwise be useless. -  
4. The smallness.of the vessels, which the short-  
8s of the voyage enables us to employ, and which,  
sequently, requires but a small capital.  
). The cheapness of our vessels, which do not cost  
ve the half of the Baltic fir. vessels computing  
e and duration. j  
. Their excellence as sea-boats, which decreases  
risk, and quickens the returns.  
- The superiority of our mariners in skill, acti-  
» enterprize, sobriety and order.  
: The cheapness of provisions.  
‘The cheapness of casks, which, of itself, is said  
be equal to an extra profit of fifteen per cent.

neighbors.  
  
5. High duties in those of others, and  
  
4. Bounties to the individuals in competition with  
us,  
  
The consideration of these, will find its place more  
aptly, after a review of the condition of our whale  
fishery, shall have led us to the same point. To this .  
branch of the subject, therefore, we will now pro-  
ceed. U  
  
The whale fishery was first brought into notice of  
the southern nations of Europe, in the fifteenth cen-  
tury, by the same Biscayans and Basques, who led  
the way to the fishery of Newfoundland. They began  
it on their own coasts, but soon found that the princi-  
pal residence of the whale, was in the northern seas,  
into which, therefore, they pursued him. In 1578,  
they employed twenty-five ships in that business; the  
Dutch and Hamburghers took it up after this, and  
about the middle of the seventeenth century, the  
former employed about two hundred ships, and the  
latter three hundred and fifty.  
  
The English endeavored also to participate of it.  
In 1672*, they offered to their own fishermen, 2  
bounty of six shillings a ton, on the oil they should  
  
| bring home; and instituted at different times, differ-  
  
ent exclusive companies, all of which failed of suc-  
cess. They raised their bounty in 1733f, to twenty  
shillings a ton on the admeasurement of the vessel.  
In 1740, to thirty shillings with a privilege to the  
fishermen against being impressed. The Basque-  
  
fishery, supported by poverty alone, had maintained, .  
  
but a feeble existence, before competitors, aided by  
the bounties of their nation, and was, in fine, annihi-  
lated by the war of 1745, at the close of which, the  
English bounty was raised to forty shillings. From  
this epoch, their whale fishery went on between the  
limits of twenty-eight and sixty-seven vessels, till  
the commencement.of the-last war.

ports of France, still remaining shut to all other  
nations; were again opened to the produce of the  
whale fisheries of the United States; continuing,  
however, their endeavors to recover a share in this  
fishery themselves, by the aid of our fishermen. In  
1784;—5,—6, they had four ships; in 1787, three;  
in 1788, seventeen in the two fisheriés,; of four thou-  
sand five hundred tons. These cost them in bounty  
two hundred and twenty-five thousand livres, which  
divided on one thousand five hundred and fifty tons  
of oil, the quantity they took, amotintéd to one hun-  
dred and forty-five livres (near twenty-seven dollars)  
the ton; and on about one hundred natives on board  
the seventeen ships, (for there were one hundred and  
fifty Americans engaged by the voyage) came to two  
thousand two hundred and fifty livres, or about  
four hundred and sixteen dollars and two-thirds a  
man.  
  
We have had during the years 1787, 1788, 1789,  
on an average, ninety-one vessels, of five thousand  
éight hundred and twenty tons, in the northern, and  
thirty-one, of four thousand three hundred and ninety  
tons, in the southern fishery. See No. 12.  
  
These detajls will enable congress to see with  
what a competition we have to struggle for the con-  
tinuance of this fishery, not to say incréase. Against  
prohibitory duties in one country, and bdunties to  
the adventurers in both of those which are contend-  
ing with each other for the same object, ours have  
no auxiliaries but poverty and rigorous economy.  
The business, unaided, is a wretched one. The  
Dutch have peculiary advantages for the northern  
fishery, as being within six or eight days sail of the  
grounds, as navigating with more economy than any  
other nation in Europe, their seamen content with  
lower wages, and their merchants with lower profits.  
  
et the memorial (No. 15,) from a committee of  
the whale merchants to the states general of Hol-  
Iund in the year 1775, states, that fourteen millions  
of guilders, equal to five millions six hundred thou-  
sand dollars, had been lost in that fishery in forty-  
Seven years, being about one hundred and twenty  
thousand dollars a year. The states general there-  
Upon gave a bounty of thirty guilders a man to the  
fishermen. A persott intimately acquainted with the  
British whale fishery, and whose information merits  
Confidence, has giten assurance that the ships em-  
ployed in their northern fishery in 1788, sunk eight  
hundred pounds each, on an average, more than the  
amount of produce and bounties. An English ship of  
three hundred tons, and forty-two seamen, in this  
ishery, generally brings home, after four months  
voyage, twenty-five tons of oil, worth four hundred  
ané thirty-seven pounds ten shillings, sterling; but  
the wages of the officers and seamen will be four  
hundred potinds, there remains but thirty-seven  
pounds ten shillings, not worth taking into account  
towards the outfit and merchant’s profit. These then  
must be paid by the government; and it is on this  
idea that the British bounty is calculated.  
  
Our vessels for the northern fishery average sixty”  
four tons; and cost, when built, fitted out, and vic-  
tualled for their first voyage, about three thousand  
dollars. They have taken on an average the last  
three years, according to the statement (No. 12,)  
€ighteen ton of oil, worth, at our market, nine hun-  
dred dollars, which are to pay all expenses, and sub-  
, Our vessels for  
the southern fishery average one hundred and forty  
tons, and cost, when built, fitted out, and victualled,  
for their first voyage, about six #housand five hun.  
dred dollars. They have taken on an average, the  
three last years, according to the same statement,  
thirty-two tons of oil, each worth at our market,  
  
three thousand two hundred dollars, which are in  
like manner, to pay all expenses, and subsist the  
owners and navigators These expenses are great,  
as the voyages are generally of twelve months du--  
rafion. No hope can arise of their condition being  
bettered by an augmentation of the price of oil. This  
is kept down by the competition of the vegetable  
oifs; which answer the same purposes, not quite so  
well; but well enough to become preferable, were  
the price to be raised, and so well indeed as to be  
more generally used than the fish oils for lightening  
houses and cities.  
  
The American whale fishery is principally fol-  
lowed by the inhabitants of the island. of Nantucket,  
a sand bar of about fifteen miles long and three  
broad, capable of maintaining by its agriculture  
about twenty families: but it employed in these fish-  
erics before the war, between five and six thousand  
men and boys; and in the only harbor it possesses, it  
had one hundred and forty vesselsy one hundred and  
thirty-two of which were of the largest kind, as  
being employed in the southern fishery. In agricul-  
ture then, they have no resource, and, if that of their  
fishery cannot be pursued from their own inhabi-  
tants, it is natural that they should seek others,  
from which it can be followed, and preferably those  
where they will find a sameness of language; reli-  
gion, laws, habits and kindred. A foreign emissary  
has lately been among them, for the purpose of re-  
newing the inVitations to a change of situation. But  
attached to their native country, they prefer conti-  
nuing in it, if their continuance there, can be made  
supportable.  
  
This brings us to the question, what relief does  
the condition of this fishery require?  
  
1st. A remission of duties on the articles used for  
their calling.  
  
2d. A retaliating duty on foreign oils, coming to  
seek a competition with them in or from our ports.  
  
31. Free markets abroad.  
  
Ist. The remission ef duties will stand on nearly  
the same ground, with that to the cod fishermen.  
  
2d. The only nation whose oil is brought hither for  
competition with our own, makes ours pay a duty of  
| about eighty-two dollars the ton, in their ports.—  
Their’s is brought here too, to be re-shipped frau-  
dulently, under our flag into ports where it could not  
be received under theirs, and ought not to be covered.  
by ours, if we mean to preserve our own admission  
into them. The  
  
3d. And principal object, is to’ find markets for  
the vent of oil.  
  
Portugal, England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark,  
Prussia, Russia, the Hanse towns, supply themselves  
‘and something more. Spain and Italy receive sup-  
iplies from England, and need the less as their skies  
are clearer. France is the only country which can  
jtake our surplus, and they take principally of the  
common oil; as the habit is but commencing with  
them of ascribing a just value to that of the sperma-  
exti whale. Some of this, however, finds fts vent  
there. There was, indeed, a particular interest per-  
petually soliciting the exclusion of our oils from  
itheir markets. The late rovernment there saw well;  
that what we should lose thereby, would be gained  
by others, not by themselves. And we are to hope  
that the present government, as wisely and friendly,  
|will also view us, not as rivals, but as co-operators  
against a common rival. Friendly arrangements with  
them, and accommodation to mutual interest, ren  
dered easier by friendly dispositions existing on  
| both sides, may long secure to us this important re-  
Jsource for our seamen. Nor is it the interest of the

of eighteen pounds five shillings sterling the ton,

ception of our oils; on paying always, however, the  
same duty of eighteen pounds five shillings. This  
serves to show, that the tenure, by which we hold  
the admission of this commodity in their markets, is  
as precarious as it is hard. Nor cai it be announced,  
that there is any disposition on the:r part to arrange  
this or any other commercial] matter, to mutual con-  
  
venience. The exparte regulations, which they have  
  
begun, for mounting their navigation on the ruin of,  
  
‘  
  
ours, can only be opposed by counter regulations on  
our part. And the loss of seamen, the natural conse-  
quence of lost and obstructed markets for our fish  
and oil, calls, in the first place, for serious and timely  
attention. It will be too late, when the seaman sliall,  
have changed his vocation, or gone over to another:  
interest. If we cannot recover and secure for him,  
those important branches of empiovyment, it behoves |  
us to replace them by others equivalent. We have  
three nurseries for forming seamen:—  
  
1..Our coasting trade already on a safe footing.  
  
2. Our fisheries, which, in spite of natural advan-  
tages, give just cause of anxiety.  
  
3. Our carrying trade, the only resource of indem-  
nification for what we lose in the other. The produce  
of the United States, which is carried to foreign  
markets, is extremely bulky. That part of it, now in  
the hands of foreigners, and which we may resume  
into our own, without touching the rights of those  
nations who have met us in fair arrangements by  
treaty, or the interests of those, whe, by their volun-  
tary regulations, have paid so just and liberal a  
respect to our interest, as, being measured back to  
them again, places both parties on as good ground,  
perhaps, as treaties could place them—the propor-  
tion, I say, of our carrying trade, which may be re-  
sumed without affecting either of these descriptions  
of nations, will find constant employment for ten

history of the last one hundred years, shows that the  
|Mation which is our catrier, has three years of war  
for every four years of peace. (No. 18.) We losey  
‘auring the same periods, the carriage for bellige-  
irent powers, which the neutrality of our flag would  
‘render an incalculnble source of profit: we lose at  
ithis moment the carriage of our own produce, to  
the annual amount of two millions of dollars, which;  
in the possible progress of the encroachment, may  
extend to five or six millions, the worth of the  
whole, with an increase ir the proportion of the  
increase of our numbers. It is easier, as well as bet-  
ter, to stop this train at its entrance, than when it  
shall have ruined or banished whole classes of  
useful and mdustrious citizens.  
  
It will, doubtless, be thought expedient, that the  
resumption suggested should take effect so gradu-  
ally as not to endanger the loss of produce tor the  
want cf transportation; but that, in order to create  
transportation, the whole plan should be developed,  
and made known at once, that the individuals, who  
may be disposed to lay themselves out for the car-  
rying business, may make their calculations on a  
full view of all circumstances.  
  
On the whole, the historical view we have taken of  
these fisheries, proves they are so poor in themselves  
as to come to nothing with distant nations, who do  
not support them from their treasury. We have seen,  
that the advantages of our position, place our fishe-  
ries on a ground somewhat higher, such as to re-  
lieve our treasury from the necessity of giving them  
support, but not to permit it to draw support from  
them, nor to dispense the government from the obli-  
gation of effectuating free markets for them; that for  
the great proportion of our salted fish, for our com-  
mon oil, and part of our spermacati oil, markets

many of the mwere on the eve of removing to Halifax, to prosecute the  
business there, and were only deterred by a letter from Lafayette declar-  
ing that France would abate her duties upon oil. The little Island  
of Nantucket is the great heart of these fisheries. A sand bar, said  
Mr. Jefferson, fifteen miles long and three broad, capable by its agri-  
culture of maintaining twenty families, employed in these fisheries be-  
fore the revolution, between 5 and 6,000 men and boys, and contained in  
its only harbor 140 vessels. In agriculture then they have no resource,  
and if that of their fisheries cannot be pursued from their own habita-

and principally those where they will find a sameness of language, re-

were on the eve of removing to Halifax, to prosecute the business there,  
and were only deterred by a letter from Lafayette, declaring that France  
would abate her duties upon oil. The little island of Nantucket is the  
great heart of these fisheries. A sandbar, said Mr. Jefferson, fifteen miles  
long and three broad, capable by its agriculture of maintaining twenty  
families, employed in these fisheries, before the Revolution, between five

hundred and forty vessels. In agriculture, then, they have no resource,  
and if that of their fisheries can not be pursued from their own habita-

charge of his office. The following paragraphs may well be  
quoted here :  
  
The produce of the United States which is carried to foreign markets  
is extremely bulky. ‘That part of it now in the hands of foreigners, and  
which we may resume into our own without touching the rights of those  
nations who have met us in fair arrangements by treaty, or the interests  
of those who by their voluntary regulation have paid so just and liberal  
a respect to our interests, —the proportion, I say, of our carrying-trade  
which may be resumed without affecting either of these descriptions of  
nations will find constant employment for ten thousand seamen, be worth  
$2,000,000 annually, will go on augmenting with the population of the  
United States, secure to us a full indemnification for the seamen we lose,  
and be taken wholly from those who force us to this act of self-protec-  
tion in navigation. . .  
  
If regulations the exact counterpart of those established against us  
would be ineffectual, from a difference of circumstances, other regulations  
equivalent can give no ground of complaint to any nation. Admittin  
their right of keeping their markets to themselves, ours cannot be denie  
of keeping our carrying-trade to ourselves; and if there be anything  
unfriendly in this it was in the first example.  
  
The loss of seamen unnoticed would be followed by other losses in a  
long train. If we have no seamen, our ships will be useless, consequently  
our ship timber, iron, and hemp; our shipbuilding will be at an end;  
ship carpenters will go over to other nations; our young men have no  
call to the sea; our products, carried in foreign bottoms, be saddled with  
war freight and insurance in time of war,—and the history of the last  
hundred years shows that the nation which is our carrier’ has three  
years of war for every four years of peace.  
  
We lose during the same periods the carriage for belligerent powers,  
which the neutrality of our flag would render an incalculable source of  
profit. We lose at this moment the carriage of our own produce to the  
amount of $2,000,000, which, in the possible progress of the encroach-  
ment, may extend to $5,000,000 or $6,000,000, with an increase in the  
proportion of the increase of our numbers. It is easier as well as better  
to stop this train at its entrance than when it shall have ruined or ban-  
ished whole classes of useful and industrious citizens.
