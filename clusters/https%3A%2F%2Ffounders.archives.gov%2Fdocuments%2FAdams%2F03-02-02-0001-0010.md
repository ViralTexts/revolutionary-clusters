11th.  
  
  
We had another Lecture at 11 from Mr. Williams, to give us the theory of solar and lunar eclipses. In the evening after tea, we held a court at Foster’s chamber, and tried a number of causes.

Superstition is a quality, which in all ages of the world, has had peculiar sway, over the human mind: it seems to have been implanted there by the hand of Nature: when two uncommon events happen in the same place, and in a short space of Time, the ignorant vulgar will immediately conclude, the one to be the effect of the othe

This evening, just before prayers about 40 horsemen, arrived here under the command of Judge Prescott of Groton, in order to protect the court to-morrow, from the rioters. We hear of nothing, but Shays and Shattuck: two of the most despicable characters in the community, now make themselves of great consequence. There has been in the course of the

If we have not entirely misstated the ba­

robust structure of our Union, those who  
have engaged in this rebellion have neith­  
er the merit ofhor.crty or good purposes ;  
they are simply traitors. The imperial na­

been any lingering doubts in the mind of  
any of the justice of Porter&#x27;s sentence, they  
have long ago been dispelled by his intimacy  
with northern copperheads; and it is surely  
a just opinion, that a man who associates ex­  
clusively with traitors cannot be very loyal  
himself. Genr Porter had a glorious chance  
to achieve honor for himself and good for the  
country, and he threw it away. We do not  
apprehend any one will care to pick it up  
for him again. The country does not want
