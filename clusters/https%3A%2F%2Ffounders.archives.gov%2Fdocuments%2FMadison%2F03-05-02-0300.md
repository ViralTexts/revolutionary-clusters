 VALlEY.&quot;  
Second War with Great Britain.  
On the 18th of June, 1812, an  
act was passed by the American  
Congress, declaring war with Great  
Britain; in the House, 79 to 49; in  
the Senate, 19 to 13. In October  
following, the Legislature of Ver­  
mont assembled at Montpelier, and  
Jonas Galusha being Governor, he  
urged the Assembly, in his Message,  
to aid the measure of the general  
government, provide the means for  
the defence of our own frontier, and  
for sustaining our national rights and  
honor. Upon this part of the Mes­  
sage, Mr. Rich, the member from  
Shoreham, introduced the following  
resolution:  
Resolved, That the constituted  
clared war between the Cnited Slates  
and Great Britain and her depend­  
encies, it is our duty, as citizens, to  
support the measure, otherwise we  
shall identify ourselves with the en­  
emy, with no other distinction than  
that of locality. We, therefore,  
pledge ourselves to each other, and  
to our Government, that with our in­  
dividual exertions, our examples and  
influence, we will support our gov­  
ernment and country in the present  
contest; and rely on the Great Arbiter  
of events for a favorable result.
