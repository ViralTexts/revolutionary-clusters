With a view to the more convenient management of the important and growing business connected with the grant of exclusive rights to Inventors &amp; Authors; I recommend the establishment of a distinct Office, within the Department of State, to be charged therewith, under a director, with a Salary adequate to his services; and with the privelege of franking communications by mail from and to the office. I recommend also that further restraints be imposed on the issue of patents to wrongful claimants, and further guards provided against fraudulent exactions of fees by persons possessed of patents.
