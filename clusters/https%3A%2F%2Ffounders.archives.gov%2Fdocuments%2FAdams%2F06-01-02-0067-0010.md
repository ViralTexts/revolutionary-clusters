If We go from Greece and Rome and Aegypt and Turkey and Persia, and fetch our Examples from England we shall not find them wanting. That selfsufficient Innovator, that arrogant pedantical Tyrant, King James the first the great School Master of the Kingdom as he affected to style himself, inculcated the same Maxim, upon his Pupils, the Parliament and People of England.  
In one of his Speeches to both Houses, in which he displayd all some of his exalted Notions of Monarchy and the Authority of Princes, he expressed himself in the following Terms. “I conclude then the Point, touching the Power of Kings, with this Axiom in Divinity, that as to dispute what God may do is Blasphemy, But what God wills that Divines may lawfully and do ordinarily dispute and discuss: so is it sedition in subjects to dispute what a King may do in the Height of his Power.

God may do is blasphemy, but what God wills, that divines

upon abundant authority when he infers that, ‘* from the first  
meeting of the Long Parliament, Charles had contemplated  
its dispersion, hoping in the mean time to derive from the  
peremptoriness of its proceedings arguments to persuade tlie  
more moderate part of the nation to acquiesce in the measures  
of the Court, and yield the reins into his hands.” For ‘ earl
