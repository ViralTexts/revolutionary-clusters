Dear Sir  
Monticello June 27. 22.  
  
Your kind letter of the 11th has given me great satisfaction for altho’ I could not doubt but that the hand of age was pressing heavily on you, as on myself, yet we like to know the particulars and the degree of that pressure. much reflection too has been produced by your suggestion of lending my letter of the 1st to a printer. I have generally great aversion to the insertion of my letters in the public papers; because of my passion for quiet retirement &amp; never to be exhibited in scene on the public stage. nor am I unmindful of the precept of Horace ‘solve senescentem, mature sanus equum, ne peccet ad extremum ridendus.’   in the present case however I se

I pant. I do not know how far you may suffer as I do, under the persecution of letters, of which every mal mail brings a fresh load. they are letters of enquiry for the most part, always of good will, sometimes from friends whom I esteem, but much oftener from persons whose names are unknown to me, but written kindly and civilly, and to which therefore civility requires answers. perhaps the better known failure of your hand in it’s function of writing, may shield you in greater degree from this distress, and so far qualify the misfortune of it’s disability. I happened to turn to my letter-list some time ago, and a curiosity was excited to count those recieved in a single year. it was the year before the last. I found the number to be 1267. many of them requiring answers of elaborate research, and all to be answered with due attention and consideration. take an average of this number for a week or a day, and I will repeat the question suggested by other considerations in mine of the 1st. is this life? at best it is but the life of a mill-horse, who sees no end to his circle but in death. to such a life that of a cabbage is paradise. it occurs then that my condition of existence, truly stated in that letter, if better known, might check the kind indiscretions which are so heavily oppressing the departing hours of life.

Earnestness is not incompatible with common prudence. Besides, the  
clergy of the Church of England are not, happily, a celibate clergy ; and  
those who for themselves might even dare to face the risk of grinding  
poverty, draw back when they reflect that they may not face it alone.
