Dear Sir  
  
Montpellier Feby. 22. 1828.  
  
The mail of last evening brought me your circular communication, by which I am informed of my being nominated by the Convention at Richmond on the 8th. of Jany. one of the Electors recommended for the next appointment of Chief Magistrate of the U. States.  
Whilst I express the great respect I feel to be due to my fellow Citizens composing that assembly, I must request that another name be substituted for mine on their Electoral ticket.  
After a continuance in publick Life, with a very brief interval, through a period of more than forty years, and at the age then attained, I considered myself as violating no duty, in allotting for what of life might remain,  
  
a retirement from scenes of political agitation &amp; excitement. Adhering to this view of my situation, I have forborne during the existing contest, as I had done during the preceding, to participate in any measures of a party character; and the restraint imposed on myself, is necessarily strengthened by an admonishing sense of increasing years. Nor, with these considerations could I fail to combine, a recollection of the public relations in which I had stood to the distinguished Individuals now dividing the favour of their country, and the proofs given to both, of the high estimation in which they were held by me.  
In offering this explanation, I hope I may be pardoned for not suppressing a wish, which must be deeply &amp; extensively felt, that the discussions incident to the depending contest, may be conducted in a spirit and manner, neither unfavorable to a dispassionate result, nor unworthy of the great &amp; advancing cause of Representative Government.

this view of my situation, I have forborne, dur­  
ing the existing contest, as I have done during  
the preceding, to participate in any measures of  
a party character; and the restraint imposed on  
myself, is necessarily strengthened by an admon­  
ishing sense of increasing years. Nor with these  
considerations could I fail to combine a recollec­  
tion of the public relations in which 1 stood to  
the distinguished individuals new dividing the  
favor of their country, and the proofs given to  
botl* of the high estimation in which they were  
held by me.  
j In offering this explanation, 1 hope I may be  
pardoned for not suppressing a wish which must  
be deeply and extensively felt, that the discus­  
sions incident to the depending Contest may be  
conducted in a spirit and manner, neither unfa­  
vorable to a dispassionate result, nor unworthy  
of the great and advancing cause of Representa­  
tive Government
