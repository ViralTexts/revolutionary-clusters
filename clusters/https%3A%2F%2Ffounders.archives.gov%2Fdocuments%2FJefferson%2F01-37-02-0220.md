riting by mr Dupont, I need use no cypher. I require from him to put this into your own &amp; no other hand, let the delay occasioned by that be what it will.  
The cession of Louisiana &amp; the Floridas by Spain to France works most sorely on the US. on this subject the Secretary of state has written to you fully. yet I cannot forbear recurring to it personally, so deep is the impression it makes in my mind. it compleatly reverses all the political relations of the US. and will form a new epoch in our political course. of all nations of any consideration France is the one which hitherto has offered the fewest points on which we could have any conflict of right, and the most points of a communion of interests. from these causes we have ever looked to her as our natural friend, as one with which we never could have an occasion of difference. her growth therefore we viewed as our own, her misfortunes ours. there is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural &amp; habitual enemy. it is New Orleans, through which the produce of three eighths of our territory must pass to market, and from it’s fertility it will ere long yield more than half of our whole produce and contain more than half our inhabitants. France placing herself in that door assumes to us the attitude of defiance. Spain might have retained it quietly for years. her pacific dispositions, her feeble state, would induce her to increase our facilities there, so that her possession of the place would be hardly felt by us, and it would not perhaps be very long before some circumstance might arise which might make the cession of it to us the price of something of more worth to her. not so can it ever be in the hands of France. the impetuosity of her temper, the energy &amp; restlessness of her character, placed in a point of eternal friction with us, and our character, which though quiet, &amp; loving peace &amp; the pursuit of wealth, is high minded, despising wealth in competition with insult or injury, enterprizing &amp; energetic as any nation on earth, these circumstances render it impossible that France and the US. can continue long friends when they meet in so irritable a position. they as well as we must be blind if they do not see this; and we must be very improvident if we do not begin to make arrangements on that hypothesis. the day that France takes possession of N. Orleans fixes the sentence which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark. it seals the union of two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive possession of the ocean. from that moment we must marry ourselves to the British fleet &amp; nation. we must turn all our attentions to a maritime force, for which our resources place us on very high ground: and having formed and cemented together a power which may render reinforcement of her settlements here impossible to France, make the first cannon which shall be fired in Europe the signal for tearing up any settlement she may have made, and for holding the two continents of America in sequestration for the common purposes of the United British &amp; American nations. this is not a state of things we seek or desire. it is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us, as necessarily as any other cause, by the laws of nature, brings on it’s necessary effect. it is not from a fear of France that we deprecate this measure proposed by her.

I should suppose that all these considerations might in some proper form be brought into view of the government of France. tho’ stated by us, it ought not to give offence; because we do not bring them forward as a menace, but as consequences not controulable by us, but inevitable from the course of things. we mention them not as things which we desire by any means, but as things we deprecate; and we beseech a friend to look forward and to prevent them for our common interests.

Franco had come Into possession of the

Jefferson had enunciated the proposition  
that it must pass to the ownership of the  
United States at whatever cost- In a letter  
to Minister Livingston on April IS, 1802, at  
the time when the French and Spanish  
tieaty was pending, the president wrote as  
follows: &quot;We have ever looked to France  
as our natural friend one with whom we  
could never have an occasion of difference;

“ The cession of Louisiana and Florida by  
Spain to France works most sorely on the  
United States. It plainly reverses all the  
political relations of the United States, and  
will form a new epoch in our political course.  
Of all nations of any consideration France Is  
the one which has hitherto offered the fewest  
points on which we could have any conflict  
of right, and the most points of a communion  
of interest. From these causes we have ever  
looked to her as our friend, as one with  
which we never could have occasion to differ.  
Her growth, therefore, we viewed as our  
own, her misfortunes ours.  
  
“There is on the globe one single spot, the  
possessor of which is our natural and habit-

placing herself in that door, assumes to

have maintained it quietly for years. Her  
pacific disposition, her feeble state, would  
induce her to increase our facilities there, so  
that her possession of the place would be  
hardly felt by us, and it would not, perhaps,  
be long before some circumstances might  
arise which might make the cession of it  
to us the price of something of worth to her.  
Not so can it ever be in the hands of France.  
The day that France takes possession of  
New Orleans fixes the sentence which is to  
restrain her forever within her low water
