In this same Year (1652) one Mr. Edwards, a Turky Merchant, brought home with him a Greek Servant, who understood the roasting and making of Coffee, till then unknown in England. This Servant was the first who sold Coffee, and kept a House for that purpose in London.  
  
The first Mention of Coffee in our Statute Books is Anno 1660 (12 mo Regni Car. II Cap. 24).

In 1732 it was cultivated in Jamaica, and an Act passed to encourage its Growth there. It had been cultivated before by the French at Martinica, Hispaniola and Ile Bourbon.
