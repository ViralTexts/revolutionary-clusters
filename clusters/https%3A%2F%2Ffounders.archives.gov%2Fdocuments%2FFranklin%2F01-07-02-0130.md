V, 503–6) as the recipient. But the religious position of the person now addressed and that of Huey, as reflected in Franklin’s earlier letter, seem strongly opposed. Franklin could have written the initials “J.H.” on the copy of this letter by mistake instead of on that of the Huey letter he sent Stiles in 1790. The editors have not been able to identify any particular “infidel” who might have sent Franklin a manuscript in 1757, nor have they located any particular tract which might be evidence that his advice against publication was disregarded.  
  
Dear Sir  
[Cravenstreet, Dec. 13. 1757]  
I have read your Manuscrit with some Attention. By the Arguments it contains against the Doctrine of a particular Providence, tho’ you allow a general Providence, you strike at the Foundation of all Religion: For without the Belief of a Providence that takes Cognizance of, guards and guides and may favour particular Persons, there is no Motive to Worship a Deity, to fear its Displeasure, or to pray for its Protection. I will not enter into any Discussion of your Principles, tho’ you seem to desire it; At present I shall only give you my Opinion that tho’ your Reasonings are subtle, and may prevail with some Readers, you will not succeed so as to change the general Sentiments of Mankind on that Subject, and the Consequence of printing this Piece will be a great deal of Odium drawn upon your self, Mischief to you and no Benefit to others. He that spits against the Wind, spits in his own Face. But were you to succeed, do you imagine any Good would be done by it? You yourself may find it easy to live a virtuous Life without the Assistance afforded by Religion; you having a clear Perception of the Advantages of Virtue and the Disadvantages of Vice, and possessing a Strength of Resolution sufficient to enable you to resist common Temptations. But think how great a Proportion of Mankind consists of weak and ignorant Men and Women, and of inexperienc’d and inconsiderate Youth of both Sexes, who have need of the Motives of Religion to restrain them from Vice, to support their Virtue, and retain them in the Practice of it till it becomes habitual, which is the great Point for its Security; And perhaps you are indebted to her originally that is to your Religious Education, for the Habits of Virtue upon which you now justly value yourself. You might easily display your excellent Talents of reasoning on a less hazardous Subject, and thereby obtain Rank with our most distinguish’d Authors. For among us, it is not necessary, as among the Hottentots that a Youth to be receiv’d into the Company of Men, should prove his Manhood by beating his Mother. I would advise you therefore not to attempt unchaining the Tyger, but to burn this Piece before it is seen by any other Person, whereby you will save yourself a great deal of Mortification from the Enemies it may raise against you, and perhaps a good deal of Regret and Repentance. If Men are so wicked as we now see them with Religion what would they be if without it? I intend this Letter itself as a Proof of my Friendship and therefore add no Professions of it, but subscribe simply Yours

foundations of all religion. For  
without the belief of a Providence  
that takes cognizance of guards and

persons, there is no motive to worship  
a Deity, to fear its displeasure, or to

‘*] have read your manuscript with  
some attention. By the argument it cqn-  
tains against a particular Providende,  
though you allow a general Providence,  
you strike at the foundations of all reli-  
gion. For without the belief cf a Proy-  
  
and guides, and may favour patticular  
  
ersons, there is n» motive to woyship a  
Deity, to fear its displeasure, or fo pray  
for its protection. I will not enter into  
any discussion of your principles though  
you seem to desire it. At present! shall

yourself, mischief to you, and no benefit  
to others. He that spits against the  
wind, spits in his own face. But were

a portion of mankind consists of weak  
and ignorant men and women, and of in-  
experienced, inconsiderate youth of both  
sexes, who have need of the motives of  
religion to restrain them from vice, to  
support their virtue, and retain them in}  
the practice of it till it beeomes habitual,  
which is the great point for its security.  
And perhaps you are indebted to her orig-

for the habits of virtue upon which you  
now justly value yourself. You might

Dear S-ir— 1 have teat! your manuscript

it contains against particular Providence,  
though you allow a general Providence,  
you strike at the foundation &lt;d all reli­

ihere is no motive to wot ship a Deity, to  
&#x27;ear its displeasure, or to prav for its pro­  
tection. I will not enter into any dis­

reasonings are -untie, and prevail with

sary, as among the Hottentots, that a

you allow a general Providence, you strike at  
the foundation of all religion. For without the

DEAR StR.—I have read your manu  
script with some attention. By the argu  
mont it contains against a particular  
Providence, you strike at the foundation  
of religion. For without the belief of a  
Providence that takes cognizance of,  
guards and guides, and favors particular  
persons, there is no motive to worship a  
Diety, to fear its displeasure, or to pray  
for its protection. I will not enter into  
any discussion of your principles, though  
you seem todesiae it- At present, I shall  
only give you my opinion, that, though  
your reasonings are subtile, and may pre  
vail with some readers, you will not sue*  
ceed so as to change the general senti  
ments of mankind on that subject, and  
the censequence of printing this piece  
will be, a great deal of odium drawn upon  
yourself, mischief to you, aud no benefit  
to others. He that spits against the  
wind spits in his own face. But were  
you to succeed, do you imagine any good  
will be done by it? You, yourself,  
may find it easy to live a virtuous Pfe  
without the assistance afforded by rclig  
ion ; you have a clear perception of the  
advantages ol virtue, and t &#x27;C disadvan­  
tage of vice, and possess a strength of  
resolution sufficient to enable you to re­  
sist common temptations. But think how  
great a portion of mankind consist of  
weak and ignorant men and women, and  
of inexperienced, inconsiderate youth of  
both sexes, who have need of the motives  
of religion to restrain them from vice, to  
support their virtue, and retain them in  
the practice of it tilt it becomes habitual,  
which is the great point for its security.  
And perhaps you are indebted to her  
originality, that is, to your religious  
education, for the habits of virtue upon  
which you justly value yourself. You  
might easily display your excellent tal­  
ents of reasoning upon a less hazardous  
subject, and thereby obtain a rank with

among us, it is notmcccessary, as among

Dear Sir:—l have read your manuscript ;  
with some attention, By the argument it con- ;  
tains against a particular Providence, though  
you allow a general Providence, you strike at ,  
the foundation of all religion. For without the &#x27;  
belief of a Providence that takes cognizance of, ’  
guards and guides, and favors particular per­  
sons, there is no motiveHn worship a Deity, to  
fear its displeasure, or ft&gt; pray for its protec­  
tion. I will not enter into\any discussion of  
your principles, thpugh.you seem ,to desire it.  
At present, I shall only give you -ray opinion,  
though your, reasonings are subtler and-may  
prevail with some readers, you will not succeed  
so as to change the general sentiment of man­  
kind on that subject, and the consequence of  
printing this piece will be a great deal of odium  
drawn upon yourself, mischief to you, and no  
benefit to olheis. He that spits against the  
wind spits in his own face. : But were you to  
succeed, do you imagine any, good will be done  
by it? You yourself may find it easy, to live  
a virtuous life withov.t the assistance afforded  
by religion: you have a clear perception of the  
advantages of. virtue, and the disadvantages of  
vice, and possess a strength of resolution suffi­  
cient td enable you to resist common tempta­  
tions. .  
But think how great a portion of1 mankind  
consists of weak and ignorant men and women,  
and of inexperienced, inconsiderate youth, of  
both sexes, who have need of the motives of re­  
ligion to restrain them from/vice, to support  
their virtue, and retain them in the practice of  
it until it becomes habitual, which is the great  
point for its security. , And perhaps you are  
indebted to her originality, that is, to your re­  
ligions education, for the habits of virtue upon  
which you justly value yourself. You might  
easily display your excellent talents Of reason­  
ing upon a less hazardous subject, and thereby  
obtain, rank with our .most distinguished au­  
thors. For among us, it is not necessary, as.  
among the Hottentots, that a youth, to bo raised  
into the company of men, should prove his  
manhood by beating his mother. I would ad­  
vise you, therefore, not to attempt unchaining  
the tiger, but to burn this piece-before it is  
seen by any other person, whereby vou will,  
save yourself a great deal of mollification from  
the enemies it may raise against.you, and per­  
haps a great deal of regret and repentance. If  
men are so wicked with religion, what would  
they be without it ? X intend this letter itself

to worship a deity, to fear its  
diapleasure, or to prey for its

only give you my opinion, that, though

succeed so as to change tbe geoeral  
sentiments of mankind on that subject,  
and the consequenoe of printing this  
piece will be a great deal of odiom  
drawn npoa yourself, mischief to you.  
and no benefit to others. He that spits  
against the wind spits in bis own face,  
But where you to aueceed, do you imagine  
any good will be done by it? You  
yourself may find it e&amp;dy to live a  
virtuous life without tbe Assistance  
afforded by religion; you have a clear  
perception of the advantages of virtue,  
and the dieadvsutagesof vice, and  
possess a strength of resolution  
sufficient to enable you to resist  
common temptations. Bat think bow great  
a portion of mankind consists of weak  
and ignorant men and women, and of  
inexperienced, inconsiderate youth of  
both sexes, who have need of tbe motives  
of religion to restrain them from vice,  
to support their virtue, and retain tbem

Dear Sir--I have read your manuscript with  
some attention. By the argument it contains  
against a particular Providence, though you alloy  
a general Previdence, you strike at the foundation  
of all religion. For without the belief of a provi­  
dence that takes coznizance of, guards and guides,  
and favors particular persons, there is no motive  
to worship a beity, to fear its displeasure, or to  
pray for its protection. I will not enter into any  
discussion of your principles, though you seem  
to desire it. At present I shall only give you my  
Wpiiiol tiaks bast ttt tessotraasles ai aatts  
and may prevail with some readers, you will  
not succeed so as to change the general  
entiments of mankind on that subject, and the  
consequence of printing this piece will be a great  
deal of odlum drawn upon yourself, mischief  
to you, and no benefit to others. He that spits  
against the wind spits in his own face. But we  
you to succeed, do you imagine any good will be  
done by it? You yourself may find it easy to live  
a virtuous life without the assistance afforded by  
reigion; you have a clear perception of the ad  
vantages of virtue, and the disadvantages of vice,  
and possess a strength of resolution sufficient to  
enable you to resist common temptations. But  
think now great a portion of manalad comnin of  
weak and ignorant men and women, and of inex­  
perienced, inconsiderate youth of both sexes, who  
have need of the motives of religion to restrain  
them from vice, to support mhear tirtue, ane retalit  
them in the practice of it till it becomes habiinal,  
which is the great point for its security. And  
perhaps you are indebted to her originally--that  
is for your religiots cadeatione te ai   
virtue upon which you now justly value yourself.  
You might easily display your excellent talents

it is not necessary, as among the Mot&#x27;entets, that

I would advise you, therefore, not to attempt un  
chaining the tiger, but to burn this piece before  
it is seen by any other person, whereby you will  
save yourself a great deal of mortification from the  
enemies it may raise against you, and, perhaps, a

general rrovidence, you stnko at tho  
foundation of all religion. For with  
out a belief of a Providenco that takes  
cognizance of, guards, and guides, and  
may favor particular persons, thero is  
no motivo to worship a Deity, to fear  
his displeasure, or to pray for his pro­

cussion of your principles, though you  
seem to desiro it. At present I shall  
only give you ray opinion, that, though  
your reasonings aro subtile, and may  
prevail with somo readers, you will not

deal of odium

and no benefit toothers. Ho that  
spits against tho wind, spits in his own  
lace.  
But, were you to succeed, do you  
imagine any good would bo douo by it!  
You yourself may find it easy to &#x27;live  
a virtuous life without tho assistance  
afforded by religion : you having a

tho motives of religion to restrain them  
from vice, to support their virtue, and  
retain them in tho praclico of it till it  
becomes habitual, which is tho great  
point for its security. And perhaps  
you aro indebted to her originally, that  
is, to our religious education, for the  
habits ol virtue upon which you now  
justly valuo yourself. You might  
easily display your excellent talents of  
reasoning upon a less hazardous object,

most distinguished authors. For among

I would abviso you, therefore, not to

other person ; whereby you will save  
yourself a great deal of mortification  
by tho enemies it may raise against you,  
and perhaps a good deal of regret and
