In the midst of these events, the news arrived  
in France of the death of Washington. Napoleon  
immediately issued the following order of the day  
to the army :—‘‘ Washington is dead! That  
great man fought against tyranny. He estab-  
lished the liberty of his country. His memory  
will be ever dear to the free men of both hemi-  
spheres ; and especially to the French soldiers,  
who, like him and the American troops, have
