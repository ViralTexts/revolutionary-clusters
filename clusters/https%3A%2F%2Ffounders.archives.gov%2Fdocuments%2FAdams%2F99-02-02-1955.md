ean the stipulations that free ships should make free goods—and that ship timber and naval stores should not be deemed contraband.—But on the other hand, as horses are free by the treaty with Great Britain, and as they are an article of some consequence in our exports, we should endeavour to strike them from the list of contraband in our treaty with France.—These alterations being made, the 14th article of the French treaty, which subjects the property of the neutral nation found on board the enemies ships, to capture and condemnation, must of course be abolished.

assments about condemning and selling prizes.But if prize ships are so disabled as to be incapable of putting to sea again until refitted, or if they are utterly disabled, what should be done with their cargoes? Both cases occurred last year. The Government permitted (tho’ with hesitation, doubts &amp; caution) the cargoes to be unladed, the vessels repaired – part of the prize goods to be sold to pay for the repairs, and the cargo of the prize vessel surveyed &amp; reported to be unfit ever to go to sea again, was allowed to be exported in neutral bottoms, as prize goods, &amp; consequently liable to recapture.Art. XXII. The express exclusion of foreign privateers, enemies of either party, from being fitted in the ports of the other, or selling what they have taken, has been (absurdly to be sure) construed by the French as an implied admission of French privateers to do both. To prevent this &amp; similar unfounded claims in future, more explicit language must be employed. The sale of the prizes of privateers, and even when made by public ships of war, may be wholly forbidden by treaty. If not forbidden, it may be left to the pleasure of each government, without either having a right to complain of the prohibition, should it take place.Art. XXIII. This stipulates for the freedom of commerce. The modification proposed is mentioned in the answer to the 2d question.Art. XXIV. This article also to be modified as stated in the answer to the 2d question.There have appeared so many disgracefully quibbling causes for capture &amp; condemnation, that it may be impossible to guard against them in any treaty that human ingenuity can devise, to be entered into with the French Republic. To state the shameful pretences that have been already advanced by their courts &amp; agents, &amp; even by their first minister of justice, as causes of capture &amp; confiscation of American vessels &amp; cargoes, for the purpose of expressly preventing their future application, would, I think, give pain to any man of sense whom they should employ to negociate another treaty or a modification of the treaties which exist, so that he would be unwilling to admit the possibility of such abuses: yet without being so explicit there will be no safety against repetitions of licensed piracies.  
  
  
  
  
  
1.Under pretence that certain ports were surrendered to the English by the treachery of the French or Dutch Inhabitants, Victor Hugues &amp; Lebas, Special Agents of the Directory at Guadaloupe, have declared that all neutral vessels bound to or from such ports shall be good prize.2.Under the false pretence that the English take all neutral vessels bound to or from French ports, the French Agents at St. Domingo decreed that all American vessels bound to or from English ports should be good prize.3.Under the absurd pretence that the sea-letters or passports, which were intended for the mutual convenience of the two nations, to save their commerce from vexations, are an indispensably requisite document, they confiscate our vessels which are destitute of them, even when they acknowledge the property to be American.4.Because horses and their military furniture when destined to an enemy’s port are by the 24th article of the Commercial treaty declared contraband, and as such, by themselves, liable to confiscation, Victor Hugues and Lebas decreed that all neutral vessels merely for having horses on board, should be good prize; &amp; they accordingly condemned vessels and cargoes.Art. XXV5. The ancient ordonnances of the French monarchs required a variety of papers to be on board neutral vessels, the want of any one of which is made a cause for condemnation; altho’ the 25th article mentions what certificates shall accompany our vessels &amp; cargoes, which by every reasonable construction ought to give them protection. Therefore it will be advisable to enumerate and describe the ships papers which shall be deemed necessary, and to declare that the want of any other shall not be a cause of confiscation.6. It will likewise be expedient to fix the mode of manning our vessels, as to the officers and propositions of men who must be natives, or naturalized citizens.—An accurate examination of the French Ordonnances concerning neutral vessels will be useful to the negociator of a ne

tral vessel into port; and by no means to supersede other proof of property. These two articles should be made conformable to each other. The 27th says that after the exhibition of the passport, the vessel shall be allowed to pass without molestation or search &amp;c. The 25th requires that besides the passport, vessels shall be furnished with certain certificates, which of course also must be exhibited.Art. XXVII.Art. XXVIII. The prohibited goods here mentioned, have no relation to contraband: but refer merely to such as by the laws of the country are forbidden to be exported. In the case of exporting horses from Virginia, this article was perversely applied by the French minister to horses which by the French treaty are contraband of war.Art. XXX. The commerce of the U. States ought not to be restricted to certain “free-ports” in France; but be admitted into all her ports in the same manner as the commerce of France is admitted into the ports of the U. States.—The commerce to her Colonies will doubtless be more or less restricted, according to the usage of other European nations: yet on account of the deranged and nearly annihilated condition of French commerce, probably a larger latitude of trade with their Colonies will be readily permitted for a term of years; and perhaps the mutual advantages thence resulting will be so great as to induce afterwards a prolongation of that term, to which the course or habit of business may contribute.Question 3. What articles of the treaty of alliance and of the treaty of commerce with France should be proposed to be abolished?Answered under the second question: excepting that I omitted to speak of the reception to be given to the public ships of war of all nations; which indeed goes rather to the abolition of a French claim, than of any article in the treaty with France.—The French ministers have demanded that her enemies ships which had at any time and in any part of the world made prize of a French vessel, should be excluded from the ports of the U. States, altho’ they brought in no prizes with them. In opposition to this demand, we have contended that they were to be excluded only when they came in with French prizes. And the kind of asylum to be afforded in all other circumstances, is described in Mr. Jefferson’s letter to Mr. Hammond, dated the 9th of Septr. 1793, published (page 77.) with the State papers of that year, in the following words. “Thus then the public ships of war of both nations (English &amp; French) enjoy a perfect equality in our ports, 1st, in cases of urgent necessity; 2d, in cases of comfort or convenience;—and 3d, in the time they chuse to continue.” Mr. Jefferson enlarged on this subject; saying, that there is a right secured neither to France nor Britain by treaty, “but due to both on the principles of hospitality between friendly nation

s ructions; such as under the present Article, that a Prohi-  
dition to an Enemy of either Party is a grant to the other of  
me thing forbidden.  
  
  
ed, and the alterations proposed have been mentioned.  
  
There have been so many unjust causes and pretences as-  
signed for capturing and contiscatiug American Vessels, it may  
perhaps be impossible to guard against a repetition of them in  
any Treaty which can be devised. To state the causes and  
pretences that have been already advanced by the Government  
oi France, its Agents and &quot;Tribunals, as the grounds of the  
  
capture and condemnation of American Vessels and Cargoes,  
would doubtless give pain to any man of-an ingenuous minds  
who should be employed on the part of France to negotiate an-  
other Treaty, or a modification of the Treaties which exist  
It is not desired therefore to g farther iato detail on these  
  
  
against future misconstruCtions and the mischiefs they will na.  
turally produce.  
  
Under pretence that certain Ports were currendered to the  
English by the treachery of the French aud Dutch Inhabitants,  
Victor Hugues and Lebas, the Special Agents of the Executive  
Directory, at Guadaloupe, have declared that all Neutral Ves-  
sels bound to or from such Ports shall be good prize.  
  
Under the pretence that the British were taking all Neutral  
Vessels bound to or from French Ports, that French Agents at  
St. Domingo (Santhonax and others) decreed that all Ameri-  
can Vessels bound to or from English Ports, should be captur-  
ed ; and they have since declared such captured vessels to be  
good prize. That French Consuls in Spain have on the same  
ground condemned a number of American Vessels merely be-  
cause they were destined to or coming from an English Port.  
  
Under the preteace, that the Sea- Letters or Patsports pre-  
seribed by the Commercial Treaty for the mutual ad vantage of  
the Merchants and Navigators, of the two Nations, to save  
their Vessels from detention and other vexations, when met  
with at sea, by presenting so clear a proof of the property, are  
an indispensible document to be found. on board the French  
confiscate American Vessels destitute of them, even when _  
acknowledge the property to be American.  
  
Because horses aud their military ſurniture, when Jeatined  
to any Enemy&#x27;s Port, are by the 24th Article of the Commer-  
cial Treaty declared contrabands, and as such by themselves  
only liable to confiscation, Hugues and Lebas decreed all Neu-  
tra! Vessels, having horses or any othef contraband goods on  
board, should be good prize ; and they ogy condemned  
Vessels and Cargoes.  
  
The antient Ordinances of the French Monarchs 1 a.  
variety of Papers to be on board Neutral Vessels, the want of  
any one of which is made a cause of condemnation; although.  
the 25th Article of the Commercial Treaty mentions what  
Certificates shall acco mpany the Merchant Vessels and Car-  
goes of each party, and which, by every reasonable construc-  
tion, ought to give them protection.  
  
It will therefore be advisable to guard —_—_ abuses by de-  
scending to particulars, to describe the Ships Papers which  
shall be required, and to declare that. the want of any other  
shall not be-a cause for confiscation; to fix the mode of man-  
ning Vessels as to the Officers, and the proportion of th

Article 28. The prohibited Goods here mentioned have no  
relation to contraband ; but merely to such as by the Laws of  
the Country are forbidden to be exported, Yet in the&#x27;case of  
exporting horses from Virginia, which no Law prohibited, in  
the winter of 1796, this Article was applied by the French Mi-  
nister to horses which by the French Treaty are contraband  
of War. And a Letter from the Minister to Victor Hugues  
and Lebas, informing them that the American Government  
re ſused to prevent such export of horses by the British, is made  
one ground for their Decree above mentioned.  
  
| Article 30. The Vessels of the United States ought to be ad-  
mitted into France in the same manner as the Vessels of  
France are admitted into the Ports of the United States. But  
such a $tipulation ought not to authorize the admission of Ves-  
zels of either party into the Ports of the other, into which the  
admission of all Foreign Vessels shall be forbidden by the Laws  
of France and of the United States respectively. With this  
restriction, the principles of the 14th Article of the Treaty  
with Great Britain afford a liberal and unexceptionable prece-  
dent. A restriction like that here referred to will be ſound in  
the first paragraph of the Third Article of the British Treaty.  
  
The Commerce to the French Colonies in the East and  
west Indies, will doubtless be more or less restricted, accor-  
ding to the usage of other European Nations. Yet on account  
of the disarranged condition of the French Navigation, pro-  
bably a larger latitude of Trade with their Colchies will be  
readily permitted for a term of years: and perhaps the mutual  
advantages thence resulting will be found so great as to induce

It will be expedient to fix explicitly the reception to be given  
to public Ships of War of all Nations. The French Miniſters  
have demanded, that the public Ships of the Enemies of  
France, which at any time, and in any part of the World,  
had made Prize of a French Veſſel, ſhould be excluded from  
the Ports of the United States; and although they brought in  
no Prize with them. In oppoſition to this demand, we have  
contended that they were to be excluded only when they  
came in with French Prizes. And the kind of aſylum to be  
afforded in all other circumſtances is deſcribed in Mr. Jeffer-

French Minifters have demanded, that  
the public fhips of the enemies of  
France, which at any time, and in  
any part of the world, had made

afforded in all other circumftances is

It will be expedient to fix explicitly the  
reception to be given to public ships of  
war of all nations. The French ministers  
have demanded that the tgublic ships of the  
enemies of France, which at any time, and  
in any part of the world, had made prize  
of a French vessel, should be excluded from  
the ports of the United States, although  
they brought in no prize with them. In  
opposition to this demand, we have con­  
tended that they were to be excluded only  
when they came in with French prizes.—  
And the kind of asylum to be afforded in  
all other circumstances is described in Mr.,  
Jefferfon’s letter to Mr. Hammond, dated  
the gth of September, 1798, in the follow­  
ing words : ¢“Thus thep the public ships of  
war of both nations (English &amp; French) enjoy  
a fperfc&amp; equality in our ports ; Ift, in cases  
of urgent neceflity ; 2d, in cases of comfort  
or convenience ; g3d, in the time they  
choose to continue.” And such shelter and  
accommodation are due to the public‘thips  
of all pations on the principles of hospitality  
among friendly nations.

Government of France, its agents and tri­  
bunals, as the grounds of the capture and  
condemnation of American veflels and car­  
goes would doubtlels give pain to any man  
of an ingenious mind who should be em.  
ployed on the part of France to negociate  
another Treaty, or a modification of the  
Treaties which exist. It is not desired,  
therefore to go farther into detail on these  
matters than shall be peceffary to guard by  
explicit stipulations, against future mifcon.  
ftru@ions and the mifchicfs they will naty­  
rally produce.  
Under pretence that certain ports were  
surrendered to the English, by the treachery  
of the French and Dutch inhabitants, ViQor  
Hughes and Lebas, the special agents of the  
Executive Dire&amp;ory at Guadaloupe, have  
declared that all neural veflels, bound to of  
from such ports shall be good prize,  
* Under the pretence that the British were  
taking all neutral vessels, bound to or from  
French gom, the French agents at St. Do­  
mingo, Santhonax and others, decreed that  
all American veflels bound to or from Ep.  
ﬁla“h ports, should be captured ; and they  
ve since declared such captured vessels to  
be good prize. The French Consuls in  
Spain, have on the fame ground, condemn­  
ed a number of American vellels, merely  
because they were deflined to or coming  
from an Englith port.  
Under the pretence, that the sea-letters  
or paflports prescribed by the commercial  
treaty, for the mutual advantage of the mer­  
chants and navigators of the two nations, to  
save their veflels from detention and other  
vexations, when met with at sea, by prefenta  
ing so clear a proof of the property, are an  
indifpenfible document to be found on boa: dy  
the French confifcate American vessels des­  
titute of them, even when they acknowledge  
the property to be American.  
Because horses and their military furnie  
ture, when deflined to any enemy’s port,  
are by the 24:h article oiy the commercial  
treaty declared contraband, and as such by  
themselves only liable to confifcation,w=  
Hugues and Lebas decreed all neutral vef=  
Jels having horses or any other contraband  
goods on board should be good prize ; and  
they accordingly condemned vefels and  
cargoes,  
The ancient ordinances of the French  
monarchs required a variety of papers to  
be on board neutral vessels, the want of any  
one of which is made a cause of condemnae  
tion, although the 25th article of the come  
mercial treaty mentions what cerrificates  
shall accompany the merchant vessels and  
cargoes of each party, and which by every  
realonable conftru@ion, ought to give them  
proteélion,  
It will therefore be advisable to guard  
against abuses by descending to particulars 3  
te describe the ships papers which shall be  
required, and 10 declare that the want of  
any other shall not be a cause for confifca­  
tion ¢ to fix the mode of manning vessels,  
as to the officers, and the proportion of the  
crews who shall be citizens ; endeavouring  
to provide, in refpeét to American vessels,  
that more than one third may be foreigners,  
This provision will be important to the  
Southern States, which have but few native  
seamen.

the mutual advantages thence resulting, will
