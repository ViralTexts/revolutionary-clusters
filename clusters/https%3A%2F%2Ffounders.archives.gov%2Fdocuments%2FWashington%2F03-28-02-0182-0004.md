be detained by you, without the  
greatest violation of flags, and  
contrary to the custom and usage  
of all natidns; and as I imagine  
you will see this in the same man-

neral Arnold, even that of taking  
a feigned name, and of course not  
liable to censure for it.  
  
I am, Sir, not forgetting our  
former acquaintance, your very  
humble servant,
