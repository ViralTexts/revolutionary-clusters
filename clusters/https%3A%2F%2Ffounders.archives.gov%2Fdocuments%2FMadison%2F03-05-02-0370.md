Dear SirChittenden Vt. Nov 23th. [sic] 1812.  
On the 30th. of last Month I addressed your Excellency, again, on the Subject of War.  
And I must exclaim, “My Bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart, my heart maketh a noise in me. I cannot hold my Peace, because thou hast heard O my Soul, the sound of the Trumpet, the Alarm of War.”

The Event has proved it—Genl. Tupper has confirmed it and he verifies an important consideration, I communicated to your Excellency, on the 11th. of May. He writes thus to General Harrison. “Thus Sir has terminated an Expidition at one time capable,” &amp;c. “The man whose courage and Patriotism expires when his Rations are reduced, ought never to place himself between his Country, and its enemies.”
