mist and cloud,  
No where seeing a happy distance.  
O! if ye long for bliss and ruth,  
Welcome the coming of queenly Truth.  
  
Over the turbulent sea she rides,  
Down from the realms of light descended;  
Smiling she governs the roaring tides—  
Hush! at her word the storm is ended.  
Shout! for the golden reign of Truth  
Is bringing this old world back to youth.  
  
On to the future’s peaceful shore!  
  
Soon shall hatred to love be turning;  
Vice and error shall be no more,  
  
Doubt shall flee from the halls of learning;  
See where the dark bird Night departs,  
Peace shall enter your homes and hearts.
