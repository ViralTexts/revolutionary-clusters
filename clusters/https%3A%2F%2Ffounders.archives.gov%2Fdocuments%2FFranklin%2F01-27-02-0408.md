hich the sight of the Ephemera brought to my Recollection.  
When shown the piece, the Doctor’s old friend and translator, Barbeu-Dubourg, was so enthusiastic that, taking his cue from its theme, he urged prompt publication: “Il est bien essentiel de faire  paroitre tres promptement la traduction de ce petit morceau exquis qui perdroit chaque jour, pour ne pas dire chaque heure, beaucoup de sa valeur.” Franklin, who at first had shied away from publication, as he told Carmichael, changed his mind and printed, as a bagatelle, a French translation called “Lettre à Madame B.” on his Passy press.  
  
Passy. Sept 20. 1778.  
You may remember, my dear Friend, that when we lately spent that happy Day in the delightful garden and sweet Society of the Moulin-Joli, I stopt a little in one of our Walks, and staid some time behind the Company. We had been shewn numberless Skeletons of a kind of little Fly, called an Ephemere, all whose successive Generations we were told were bred and expired within the Day. I happen’d to see a living Company of them on a Leaf, who appear’d to be engag’d in Conversation. You know I understand all the inferior Animal Tongues: my too great Application to the Study of them is the best Excuse I can give for the little Progress I have made in your charming Language. I listned thro’ Curiosity to the Discourse of these little Creatures, but as they in their national Vivacity spoke three or four together, I could make but little of their Discourse. I found however, by some broken Expressions that I caught now and then, they were disputing warmly the Merit of two foreign Musicians, one a Cousin, the other a Musketo; in which Dispute they spent their time seemingly as regardless of the Shortness of Life, as if they had been sure of living a Month. Happy People! thought I, you live certainly under a wise, just and mild Government, since you have no public Grievances to complain of, nor any Subject of Contention but the Perfections or Imperfections of foreign Music. I turned from them to an old greyheaded one, who was single on another Leaf, and talking to himself. Being amus’d with his Soliloquy, I have put it down in writing, in hopes it will likewise amuse her to whom I am so much indebted for the most pleasing of all Amusements, her delicious Company, and her heavenly Harmony.  
“It was, says he, the Opinion of learned Philosophers of our Race, who lived and flourished long before my time, that this vast World, the Moulin Joli, could not itself subsist more than 18 Hours; and I think there was some Foundation for that Opinion, since by the apparent Motion of the great Luminary that gives Life to all Nature, and which in my time has evidently declin’d considerably towards the Ocean at the End of our Earth, it must then finish its Course, be extinguish’d in the Waters that surround us, and leave the World in Cold and Darkness, necessarily producing universal Death and Destruction. I have lived seven of those Hours; a great Age, being no less than 420 minutes of Time. How very few of us continue so long! I have seen Generations born, flourish, and expire. My present Friends are the Children and Grandchildren of the Friends of my Youth, who are now, alas, no more! And I must soon follow them; for by the Course of Nature, tho’ still in Health, I cannot expect to live above 7 or 8 Minutes longer. What now avails all my Toil and Labour in amassing Honey-Dew on this Leaf, which I cannot live to enjoy! What the political Struggles I have been engag’d in for the Good of my Compatriotes, Inhabitants of this Bush; or my philosophical Studies for the Benefit of our Race in general! For in Politics, what can Laws do without Morals! Our present Race of Ephemeres will in a Course of Minutes, become corrupt like those of other and older Bushes, and consequently as wretched. And in Philosophy how small our Progress! Alas, Art is long, and Life short! My Friends would comfort me with the Idea of a Name they say I shall leave behind me; and they tell me I have lived long enough, to Nature and to Glory: But what will Fame be to an Ephemere who no longer exists? And what will become of all History, in the 18th Hour, when the World itself, even the whole Moulin Joli, shall come to its End, and be buried in universal Ruin? To me, after all my eager Pursuits, no solid Pleasures now remain, but the Reflection of a long Life spent in meaning well, the sensible Conversation of a few good Lady-Ephemeres, and now and then a kind Smile, and a Tune from the ever-amiable Brillante

OU may remember, my dear  
friend, that when we lately {pent  
that happy day in the delightful gar-  
den and {weet fociety of the Moulin  
Joly, I ftopt a little in one of our  
walks, and ftaid fometime behind the  
company. We had been fhewn num-  
berlefs fkeletons, of a kind of little fly,  
called an ephemera, whofe fucceiflive  
generations, we were told, were bred  
and expired within the day. I happened  
to fee a living company of them on a  
leaf, who appeared to be engaged in  
converfation ; you know I underftand  
all the inferior animal tongues: my  
too great application to the ftudy of  
them, is the beit excule I can give,  
for the little progrefs I have made in  
your charming language. I liltened  
through curiofity to the difcourfe of theie  
little creatures : but asthey in their nati-  
onal vivacity {poke,three or four together,  
I could make but little of their cons  
verfation: I found, however, by tome  
broken expreffions, that I heard now  
and then, they were dif{puting warmly on  
the merit of two foreign muficians, one  
a coufin, the other a muicheto; in  
which difpute they {pent their time,  
feemingly as regardlefs of the fhortneis  
of life, as if they had been fure of liv-  
inga month. Happy people! thougkt I,  
you live certainly under a wife, jutt,  
and mild government, fince you have  
no public grievances to complain of,  
nor any fubjeé&amp;t of contention, but the

mufic. I turned my head from them  
to an old grey-headed one, who was  
fingle on another leaf, and talking to

comfort me with the idea of a mame,

OU may remember, my dear  
  
_. friend, that when we lately  
fpént that happy day, in the de-  
lightful garden and {weet fociety  
of the Moulin Joly; I ftopt a little  
in-one of our walks, and ftaid  
fome time behind the company.  
We had been fhewn numberlefs  
fkeletons of a kind of little fly,  
calied an Ephemera, -whofe fuc-  
ecffive generations, we were told,  
were bred and —e within the  
day. I happened to fee a living  
company of them ona leaf, who  
appeared to be engaged in conver-  
fation.. You know I underftand  
all she inferior animal tongues :  
my too great application to the  
ttudy of them, is the beft excufe  
I can give for the little progrefs  
I have made in your charming  
language. I liftened through cu-  
riofitv to the difcourfe of thefe  
litle creatures; bui as they, in  
their uatural vivaciry, fpoke three  
or four cogether, ! could make  
but little of their converfation. {  
found, however, by fome broken  
expreilions that I heard now and  
then, they were difputing warm-  
ly on the merit of two foreign  
muficians, the one a covfm, the  
  
Go verfatian of &amp; Company of Ephererat®  
  
gaver  
  
other a mufeheto; in which dil-  
pute they fpent their time, feem-  
ingly as regardlefs of the fhortnefs  
of life as it they had been fure of  
living a month. Happy people,  
thought I, you live certainly an-  
der a wife, juft, and mild govern-  
ment, fince you have no public  
grievances to complain of, nor  
any {abject of contention, but the  
perfections or imperfections of  
fottign matic. I turned my head  
from their to an old-grey-headed  
one, who was fingle on another  
leaf, and talking to himfelf.. Be.  
ing amufed with his foliloguy, I  
put it down in writing, in hopes

tened through curiofity to the difcourfe of the little creatures ;  
but as they im their national vivacity, {poke three or four to2e-

which a difpute, they {pent their time, feemingly as regardleds  
of the fhortnefs of life, as if they had been fure of liv ing a

with his soliloquy, I put it down in writing, in hopes it will likewise  
amuse her to whom I am so much indebted for the most pleasing |  
of all amusements, her delicious company and heavenly harmony. |  
“Tt was,” says he, “ the opinion of learned philosophers of our  
race, who lived and flourished long before my time, that this vast |  
world, the Moulin Joly, could not itself subsist more than eighteen |  
hours, and I think there was some foundation for that opinion;  
since by the apparent motion of the great luminary that gives life to |  
all nature, and which in my time has evidently declined considera- |  
bly towards the ocean at the end of the earth, it must then finish its |  
course, be extinguished in the waters that surround us, and leave the |  
world in cold and darkness, necessarily producing universal death |  
and destruction. I have lived seven of those hours ; a great age—  
being no less than four hundred and twenty minutes of time! How |  
very few of us continue so long? I have seen generations born, |  
flourish and expire. My present friends, are the children and grand- |  
children of the friends of my youth, who are now alas no more!  
and I must soon follow them; for, by the common course of nature, |  
though still in health, I cannot expect to live more than seven or |  
eight minutes longer. What now avails all my toil and labour, in |  
amassing honey-dew on this leaf, which I cannot live to enjoy?  
What the political struggles I have been engaged in, for the good  
of my compatriot inhabitants of this bush, or my philosophical stu-  
dies for the benefit of our race in general ; for in politics (what can |  
laws do without morals ?) our present race of ephemera will, in the |  
course of a few minutes, become corrupt like those of other and older |  
bushes, and consequently as wretched! and in philosophy, how |  
small our progress! Alas! art is long, and life is short. My friends |

You may remember, my dear friend, that when we spent that  
happy day, in the delizhtful garden and sweet society of Moulin Joly, |  
I stopt a little in one of our walks, and staid some time behind the  
company. We had been shown numberless skeletons of a kind |  
of little fly, called an ephemera, whose successive generations, we  
were told, were bred and expired within a day. I happened to see a |  
living company of them on a leaf, who appeared to be engaged in  
conversation. You know I understand all the inferior animal tongues ; |  
my too great application to the study of them, is the best excuse I |  
can give for the little progress I have made in your charming lan-  
guage. I listened through curiosity to the discourse of these little  
creatures, but as they, in their national vivacity, spoke three or four  
together, I could make but little of their conversation. I found,  
however, by some broken expressions that I heard now and then,  
they were disputing warmly on the merit of two foreign musicians,  
one a cousin, (a sort of gnat,) the other a musquito, in which dis-  
pute they spent their time, seeming as regardless of the shortness

“You know, Madam, I understand the

to our own. The very close application I  
give to the study of them, is perhaps the  
best excuse I can offer for the little profi-  
ciency I have made in your charming  
tongue.  
  
“Curiosity led me to listen to the conver-  
sation of these little creatures; but from  
the vivacity peculiar to their nation, three  
or four of them spoke at once, and I could  
scarcely learn any thing from their dis-

puting about the merit of two foreign  
musicians, a drone and a gnat, and that  
they appeared to spend their time in those  
debates with as little concern for the bre-  
vity of life, as if they had been sure of  
living for a whole month. ‘Happy peo-  
ple!’ said I to myself: ‘you certainly live  
under a wise, equitable, and moderate go-  
vernment, since no public grievance calls  
forth your complaints, and your only  
source of complaint is, the perfection or  
imperfection of foreign music.’  
  
*T left them, to observe an aged ephe-  
meron with grey hairs, who, perched soli-  
tarily on a leaf, was talking to himself.—  
His soliloquy will, I believe, amuse that  
amiable friend to whom I am indebted for  
the most agreeable of my recreations, the  
charms of animated conversation, and the  
divine harmony of musical execution.  
  
“Tt was the opinion, said he, of the  
learned philosophers of our race, who lived  
and flourished before us, that this vast  
world itself could not subsist more than  
eighteen hours ; and the opinion appears  
to me to have some foundation, since, by  
the motion of the great luminary that gives  
life to the whole nation, and which, in my  
time, has, in a perceptible manner declined  
considerably towards the ocean that bounds  
the earth, it must necessarily terminate its  
course at that period, be extinguished in  
the waters that surround us, and deliver up  
the world to cold and darkness, the infal-  
lible forerunners of death and universal  
destruction. I have lived seven hours in  
these eighteen. It is a great age, amount-  
ing to no less than four hundred and  
twenty minutes. How few of us live so  
long! I have seen generations spring up,  
flourish, and disappear. My present  
friends are the children and grand-children  
of the friends of my youth, who, alas! are  
no more, and whom I must soon follow ;  
for in the ordinary course of nature 1 can-  
not expect, though in good health, to live  
more than seven or eight minutes longer.  
What avail at present all my labours, all  
my fatigues, to accumulate on a leaf a pro-  
vision of sweet dew, which I shall not live  
long enough to consume? What avail the  
political discussions in which I am engaged  
for the service of my countrymen, the inha-  
bitants of this bush; or my philosophical  
inquiries, devoted to the welfare of the spe-  
cies in general? In politics, what are laws  
without manners? A course of minutes  
will render the present generation as cor-  
rupt as the ancient inhabitants of other  
bushes, and of consequence as unhappy.  
And in philosophy, how slow is our pro-  
gress! Alas! art is long, and life is short!  
  
My friends would console me with the  
name which, they say, I shall leave behind  
me. They tell me that I have lived long  
enough for glory and nature. But what  
is fame to an ephemeron that will be no

## [CONVERSATION OF A COMPANY OF EPHEMERE. WITH THE SOLILOQUY OF AN ELDERLY EPHEMERA.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/97207553)

Correspondence.) You may remember, my  
dear mend, that when we lately spent  
that happy day in the deliffhtful garden  
and sweet society of the Moulin Joly, I  
stopt a little in one of our walks, and  
stayed some time behind the company. &#x27;We  
had been shown numberless skeletons of a  
luud of little fly, called an Ephemera,  
?whose successive generations, we are  
told, were bred and expired within the  
day. I happened to see a living company  
of tjiem en a leaf, who appeared to be  
engaged in conversation. You know I  
understand all the inferior animal  
tongues ;&#x27;my too great application to  
the study of *hem is the best excuse I  
can give for ihe little progress I have  
made in your charming language. I  
listened through curiosity to the  
discourse of these little creature?, but  
as they, in their national vivacity,  
spoke three or four together, I could  
make but little of their conversation. I  
found, however, by some broken  
expressions that I heard now aud* then,  
they were disputing warmly on the merit  
of two foreign musicians^ in which  
dispute they spent their time, seeming  
as regardless of the shortness of their  
life as if they had been sure of living  
a week. Happy people, thought I, you  
live certainly under a wise, jusf, and  
mild government, since you have no  
public grievances to complain of, nor  
any other subject of contention but the  
perfections or imperfections of foreign  
mjusic. I turned my head from them to au  
old grey-beaded one, who was single on*  
another leaf, and talking to himself.  
Being amused with his soliloquy, T put  
him &#x27;down in writing, in hope it will  
likewise a$mse others. &#x27;It was,&#x27; said  
the aged Ephemera, &#x27; the opinion of  
learned philosophers of our race, »bo  
lived and flourished Ions: before ray-  
time, that this vast world eighteen  
bours, and I think there was some  
foundation for that opinion, since, by  
the apparent motion of the great  
luminary that gives light to all nature,  
and which; in my time has evidently  
declined cqrsiderably towards &#x27;the ocean  
at the en3 of the earth, ifc must then  
finish its course, be extinguished in  
the waters that surround us, and leave  
the world in cold and darkness,  
necessarily producing; universal death  
and destruction. I have lived seven of  
those hours ; a grea- age, being no lesa  
than 420 minutes of time ! How very few  
of us continue so long ! I have seen  
generations born, flourish, and expire.  
My present friends are the children and  
grandchildren of the friends of my  
youth, who are a-sw, alas, no more ! and  
I must soon follojv them ; for, by the  
common course of &#x27;nature, though still  
in health, I cannot pxpect to live above  
seven or eight minuses longer. What now  
avails all my toil«and labor in amassing  
honeydew on tHis leaf, which I cannot  
live to enjoy! What the political  
struggles I haue been: engaged in, for  
the good of my compatriot inhabitnn&#x27;s of  
this bush, or my philosophical studies  
for the benefit of our ra£e in general;  
for in politics (what can laws do  
without morals ?) our present race of  
Ephemeras will in a course of a few  
mftmtes become corrupt, and  
consequently^ wretel e;l ! And in  
philosophy small our tprogress ! Alas !  
art is long, and life is short! My  
friends would comfort me with the idea  
of a name, they say, I shall leave  
behind me ; and they tell me I h.p,ve  
lived long enough to nature and to  
glory. But what will fame be to an  
ephemejra who no longer exists V and  
what will ^become of all history in the  
eighteenth &#x27;.hour., when the world  
itself shall come: to its end, and be  
buried in universal rain ?&#x27;* To me,  
after all my eager pursuits, no solid  
pleasures now remain but the reflection  
of a long life spent in meaning well,  
the sensible conversation of a few good  
lady emeptierae, and now and then a kind  
smile and ,a tune from the ever amiabl
