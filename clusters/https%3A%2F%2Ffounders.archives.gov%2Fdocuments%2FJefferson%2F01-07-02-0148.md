[30 April 1784]  
  
Be it ordained, by the United states in Congress assembled, that the territory ceded by individual states to the United states, when the same shall have been purchased of the Indian inhabitants, and laid off into states, shall be disposed of in the following manner. It shall be divided into Hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 feet and four tenths of a foot, by lines to be run and marked due North and South, and others crossing these at right angles, the first of which lines, each way, shall be at  ten miles distance from one of the corners of the state within which they shall be. But if the Indian purchase shall not have included any one of the corners of the state, the lines shall then be run at the termination of integral miles, as measured from some one of the corners, but shall be extended, by actual marks, only so far as the purchase extends. These Hundreds shall be subdivided into lots of one mile square each, or 850 acres and four tenths of an acre, by marked lines running in like manner due North and South, and others crossing these at right angles.  
For laying off the said territory, Surveyors shall be appointed by Congress, or the Committee of the states, who shall proceed forthwith, under the direction of the Register hereafter to be mentioned, to divide the same into hundreds, by lines in the directions, and at the intervals before mentioned, which lines shall be measured with a chain, shall be plainly marked by chaps or marks on the trees, and shall be exactly described on a plat, whereon shall be noted, at their proper distances, all watercourses, mountains, and other remarkeable and permanent things, over or near which such lines shall pass.  
The Hundreds being laid off and marked, nine of them shall be assigned as a district to each surveyor, who shall the

Until a temporary government shall be established in any state according to the resolutions of Congress of April1784. the lands therein shall pass, in descent and dower, according to the customs known in the common law by the name of Gavelkind: and shall be transferrable by deed or will proved by two witnesses. But so soon as a temporary government shall be so established, they shall become subject to the laws of the state, and shall never after, in any case, revert to the United states. Where a grant shall be made out to the heir or devisee of the person in whose name the warrant was originally issued, he shall be named in the said grant as heir or devisee.
