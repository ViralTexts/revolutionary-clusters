Many of the unfortunate  
eleven who fell sank never  
to rise again, and were  
borne hither attended by  
an immense throng ; the  
hearses, meeting near the  
scene of the tragedy, moved  
along the main street, pass-  
ed the closed shops, while  
the bells of Boston and the :  
neighboring towns raised =  
their sorrowful voices in ac-  
cord with the grieving land.  
A noticeable monument  
has here been raised above the parents  
and other relatives of Franklin, by a  
number of Boston citizens, who placed  
beneath it the tablet that had previously  
been erected.
