St. Croix, Nov. 11, 1769.  
  
Dear Epwarp: This serves to acknowledge the  
receipt of yours per Captain Lowndes, which was  
delivered me yesterday. The truth of Capt. Light-  
bowen and Lowndes’ information is now verified by  
the. presence of your father and sister, for whose  
eafe arrival I pray, and that they may convey that  
satisfaction to your soul, that must naturally flow  
from the sight of absent friends in health; and shall  
for news this way, refer you to them.  
  
As to what you say, respecting your soon having  
the happiness of seeing us all, I wish for an accom.  
plishment of your hopes, provided they are concomi-  
tant with your welfare, otherwise not ; though doubt  
whether I shall be present or not ; for to confess my  
weakneas, Ned, my ambition is prevalent, so that I  
contemn the grovelling condition of a clerk, or the  
like, to which my foriune condemns me, and would  
willingly risk my life, though not my character, to  
exalt my station. I amconfident, Ned, that my youth  
excludes me from any hopes of immediate prefer-  
ment, nor do I desire it; but I mean to prepare the  
way for futurity. I’m no philosopher, you see, and  
may be justly said to build castles in the air; my folly  
makes me ashamed, and beg you&#x27;ll conceal it ; yet,  
Neddy, we have seen such schemes successful,  
when the projector is constant. I shall conclude by  
saying, I wish there was awar. I am, dear Edward,  
yours, _ ALex. Hamizron.  
  
P. S. I this moment received yours by William  
Smith, and pleased to see you give such close ap.  
plication to study.
