				WHEN I had received that authentic act of the sovereign authority of France, a copy of which is inserted in my last letter to you, communicated by their Secretary of State, through their Secretary of Legation and Charge des Affaires and our Minister at the Hague, fully complying with all my requisitions, upon mature deliberation I determined to nominate a Minister to France. Some of the communications from France had been accompanied with intimations concerning the characters proper to be employed, which I thought exceptionable, and that they might be made a pretext for again rejecting a minister. I considered moreover, that France was an undulating ocean in a violent storm; party had exterminated party, and constitution had succeeded constitution, as billow rolls and roars, froths and foams after billow in the Gulph Stream. I knew, that in the nature of things, an executive authority in five persons could not last long in France or any where else: and we were already informed that the Directory was divided into parties, three against two, and that the majority in the Legislative Assembly adhered to the two, and the minority to the three. A revolution then was to be expected, and the new government might not feel themselves bound by the assurances given by their predecessors. To avoid the possibility of these inconveniences, I provided as cautiously and effectually against them as I could, in my message to the Senate, which never has been published. If this message had been made public, with its contents, the public despatch from France, I have confidence enough in the candor of the nation, to believe that it would have obviated many a silly and many a malicious criticism. It was in these words.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate,Feb. 18, 1799.I transmit to you a document which seems to be intended to be a compliance with a condition mentioned at the conclusion of my message to Congress, of the 21st of June last. Always disposed and ready to embrace every plausible appearance of probability of preserving or restoring tranquility, I nominate William Vans Murray, our Minister Resident at the Hague, to be Minister Plenipotentiary of the U. States to the French Republic. If the Senate shall advise and consent to his appointment, effectual care shall be taken in his instructions, that he shall not go to France without direct and unequivocal assurances from the French government, signified by their minister of foreign relations, that he shall be received in character; shall enjoy the privileges attached to his character by the law of nations, and that a minister of equal  
  
rank, title and powers shall be appointed to treat with him, to discuss and conclude all controversies between the two republics, by a new treaty.John Adams.In this manner effectual provision was made against any and every possible insidious use, of the insinuations concerning characters proper to be employed, and who would be likely to succeed. In this manner also, provision was made against the possible and indeed highly probable and fully expected revolution in the French government. Mr. Murray was not to advance a step towards Paris from the Hague, until after he should have received from the French government, whatever it might be, a repetition of assurances, officially communicated, that he in person should be received.When this message was received in Senate, it was postponed, as the greatest part of executive business usually was, for consideration. A great clamor was raised among the members of the House of Representatives and out of doors, and an abundance of squibs, scoffs and sarcasms in what were then called the federal newspapers, particularly Cobbett’s Porcupine and John Ward Fenno’s United States Gazette. And by whom were these written? As I was informed, by Macdonald, the Scottish British commissioner for adjusting the claims of British creditors, and by William Smith, the British agent for claimants before that board of commissioners, of whom Macdonald was one. There were other writers besides these; but I will not condescend to name any others at present. It was given out that John Ward Fenno was the writer of the most important of them, and he was represented as a masterly writer, possessed of a most eloquent pen. But the pen was not his.This was not all. Something much more serious to me soon took place. A committee of the Senate called upon me, whether appointed on record, or whether by private concert, I know not. I was distressed, because I thought the procedure unconstitutional. However, I was determined that not one disrespectful word should escape me concerning the Senate or any member of it, and to that resolution I carefully adhered; and in relating the conference with those honorable gentlemen, which shall appear in my next letter, the same decorum shall be observed.

feents to be intended to be a 2 compliance  
with a condition mentioned at the conclusion  
of my meflage to Congress, of the 21st of  
June last. Always disposed and ready to  
embrace every plausible appearance of  
probability of preserving or refltoring tran­  
quillity, I nominate William Vans Murry,  
our Minister Reflident at the Haglle, to be  
Min fter Plenipotentiary of the U. States to  
the French Republic. If the Senate shall  
advile aud consent to his appointmert, ef­  
fe@ual care thall be taken in his inftruc-’  
tions. that he shall not go to France with­  
out diret and uncquivocal assurances from.,  
the French government, fignified by their  
minister of forcign_ relations, that he shall  
be received in charadter; fhali eojoy the  
privileges attactied to his charaf¥er by the  
law of naticns, and that a minister of equal  
rank; title and powers fha!l be appointed to  
treat with him, to discuss and conclude all  
controversies between the two reputlics, by  
a new treaty. JOHN ADAMS.  
Feb. 18, 1799. ’ :  
In this manner effeCtual provision was  
made against any and every poflible insidi­  
ous ule of the insinuations concerning cha­  
racters proper to be employed, and who  
would be likely to succeed. In this man.  
ner allo, provision was made agaiaft the  
poflible and indeed highly probable and ful­  
ly expected revolution in the French gov- |  
ernment. Mr. Murray was not to advance  
a {tep towards Paris from the Hague, until -  
after he should have received from the  
French:government, whatever it might be,  
a repetition ‘of aflurances, officially com- |  
municated, that he in person thould be re­  
ceived. : : I‘  
When this meflage was received in Senate,  
it was postponed, as the greatest pari of i  
executive business ufpally was, for consider­  
ation. A great clamor was raised among  
the members of the House of Reprefenta- |  
tives and out of donrs and an abundance of  
squibs fcoffs and sarcasms in what were |  
then called the federal new{papers, particu­  
larly Cobbett’s Porcupine and John Ward  
Fenno’s United States Gazette. Add by  
whom were these written? As I was inform­  
ed, by Macdonald, the Scottish Britith com­  
miflioner for adjusting the cluims of Britith  
creditors,and by William Smith, the Britilh  
agent for claimants before that board of  
commissioners, of-whom Macdonald was  
one. There were other writers besides  
these ; but T will not condescend to name  
any othersat present. It was given out that  
John Ward Fenno was the writer of the  
most important of them, and he was repre­  
sented as a masterly writer, poflfeffed of 2  
most eloquent pen. Dut the pen wwar nothis.  
This&#x27;was not all. Something much mnre  
serious to me soon took place. A commit­  
tee of the Senate called upon me, whether  
appointed on record, or whether by private .  
concert, I know not. T was diftrefled; be­  
cause I thouglit the procedure unconstitu­  
tional. - However, I was determined that  
not one difrefpeétful word should escape  
me concerning the Senate or any member  
of it, and to that refnlution I carefuily ad­  
hered ; and in relating the conference with  
those honorable gentlemen, which shall ap­  
pear in my next letter, the fame decorum  
shall be observed. : | i

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
WHEN I had received that authentick  
act of the sovereign authority of France, a  
copy of which is inserted in my last letter to  
you, communicated by their Secretary of  
State, through their Secretary of Legation and  
Charge des Affaires and our Minister at the  
Hague, fully complying with all my requisi­  
tions, upon mature deliberation I determined  
to nominate a Minister to France. Some of  
the communications from - France had been  
accompanied with intimations concerning the  
characters proper to be employed, which I  
thought exceptionable, and that they might  
‘be made a pretext for again rejecting a minis­  
ter. I considered moreover, that France was  
an undulating ocean in a violent storm ; par­  
ty had exterminated party, and constitution  
had succeeded constitution, as billow rolls and  
rours, froths and foams after billow in the  
Gulph Stream. I knew, that in the nature of  
things, an executive authority in five persons  
could net last long in France or any where  
else ; and we were already informed that the  
Directory was divided into parties, three  
against two, and that the majority in the  
Legislative Assembly adhered to the two, and  
the minority to the three. A rc# ution then  
was to be expected, and the new government  
might not feel themselves bound by the as­  
surahces givet by their predecessors. To a­  
void the possibility of these inconveniencies,  
I provided as cautiously and effectually a­  
gainst them as I could, in my message to the  
Senate, which never has been publisired. If  
this message had been made publick, with its  
contents, the publick despatch from France,  
I have confidence enough in the candour of  
the nation, to believe that it would have ob­  
viated many a silly and many a malicous crit­  
icism. It was in these words.  
  
[3m.]  
  
. I transmit to you a document which seems  
to be intended to be, a compliance with a con­  
dition mentioned &amp; the conclusion of my  
message to Congress, of the 21st of June last.  
Always disposed and ready to embrace every  
plausible appearance or probability of pre­  
scrving or restoring tranquility, 1 nominate  
William Vans Murray, our Minister resident  
at the the Hague, to be Minister Plenipo­  
lcn:lfu&#x27;y of the U. States to the French Re-  
Tot obl aphieiagase 2hall advise snd comty  
be taken in his instructions, that he shall not&quot;  
go to France without direct and unequivocal  
assurances fram tlze French government, sig­  
nified by their minister of foreign reiptions,  
that he shall be received in character ; shall  
enjoy the privileges attached to his character  
by the law of nations, and that a minister of  
equal rank, title and powers shall be appoint­  
ed to treat with him, to discuss and conclude  
all contraversies between the two republicks,  
by a new treaty. JOHN ADAMS.  
Feb. 18, 1799. &#x27;  
In this manver effectual provision whs  
made against any and every possibic insidi­  
ous use, of the insinuations concerning char­  
acters proper to be employed, and who would  
be likely to succeed. In this manner also,  
provision was made against the possible and  
indeed highly probable and fully expected re­  
voluticn in the French government. Mr.  
Murray was not to advance a_step towards  
Paris from the Hague, until after he should  
have received from the French government,  
whatever it might be, a repetition of assur­  
ances, officially communicated, that he in pers  
son should be received.  
When this message was received in Sen­  
ate, it was postponed, as the greatest part of  
executive busines usually was, for considera­  
tion. A great clamour was raised among the |  
members of the House of Representatives  
and .out of doors, and an abundance of squibs,  
scoffs and sarcasms in what were then called  
the federal newspapers, particularly Cobbett’s  
Porcupine and John Weard Fenno’s United  
States Gazette. And by whom were these  
written &amp; As 1 was informed, by Macdonald,  
the Scottish British commissioner for adjust­  
ing the claims of British creditors, and  
by William Smith, the British agent for  
clzimants before that board of commissioners,  
of whom Macdonald was one. There were  
other writers besides these ; but I will not  
condescend fo name mimothers at present.  
It was given out that Jo Wanl Fenno was  
the writer of the most important of them, and  
he was represented as a masterly writer, pos­  
sessed of a most cloquear pen. But the fien  
was not his.  
This was not all. Something much more  
serious to me shon took place. A commit­

appointed on record, or whether by private  
concert, I know not. 1 was distressed, be­  
cause | thought the procedure unconstitution­  
al. Hov&amp;;er, I was determined that not one  
disrespectful word should escape me concern­  
ing the Senaie or any member of it, and to  
that resolution 1 carefully ‘adhered ; and in  
relating the conference with those honourable
