## Power of Congress to Tax Exports, [21 August] 1787

Mr Madison As we ought to be governed by national and permanent views, it is a sufficient argument for giving the power over exports that a tax, tho’ it may not be expedient at present, may be so hereafter. A proper regulation of exports may &amp; probably will be necessary hereafter, and for the same purposes as the regulation of imports; viz, for revenue—domestic manufactures—and procuring equitable regulations from other nations. An Embargo may be of absolute necessity, and can alone be effectuated by the Genl. authority. The regulation of trade between State and State can not effect more than indirectly to hinder a State from taxing its own exports; by authorizing its Citizens to carry their commodities freely into a neighbouring State which might decline taxing exports in order to draw into its channel the trade of its neighbours. As to the fear of disproportionate burdens on the more exporting States, it might be remarked that it was agreed on all hands that the revenue wd. principally be drawn from trade, and as only a given revenue would be needed, it was not material whether all should be drawn wholly from imports—or half from those, and half from exports. The imports and exports must be pretty nearly equal in every State—and relatively the same among the different States

“Mr. Mapison: As we ought to be governed by  
national and permanent views, it is a sufficient argu-  
ment for giving the power over exports, that a tax,  
though it may not be expedient at present, may be so  
hereafter. A proper regulation of exports may, and  
probably will, be necessary hereafter, and for the same  
purposes as the regulation of imports, viz., for revenue,  
domestic manufactures, and procuring equitable regula-  
tions from other nations. An embargo may be of abso-  
lute necessity, and can alone be effectuated by the gen-  
eral authority. The regulation of trade between State  
and State cannot effect more than indirectly to hinder  
a State from taxing its own exports, by authorizing its  
citizens to carry their commodities freely into a neigh-  
boring State, which might deciine taxing exports, in  
order to draw into its channel the trade of its neighbors.  
As to the fear of disproportionate burdens on the more  
exporting States, it might be remarked that it was  
agreed, on all hands, that the revenue would principally  
be drawn from trade, and as only a given revenue  
would be needed, it was not material whether all should  
be drawn wholly from imports, or half from those and  
half from exports. The imports and exports must be  
pretty nearly equal in every State, and, relatively, the  
same among the different States.
