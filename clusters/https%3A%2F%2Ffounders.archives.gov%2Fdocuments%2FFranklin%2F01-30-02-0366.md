 Southward— This Obliged me to Steer out of the Firth again to meet them— The Captains of the Pallas and Vengeance being come on board the Bon homme Richard I communicated to them my Project—to which many difficulties and Objections were made by them— at last however they appeared to think better of the design after I had assured them that I hoped to raise a Contribution of 200,000 Pounds Sterling on Leith, and that there was no Battery of Cannon there to oppose our landing.— So much time however was unavoidably spent in Pointed Remarks and Sage Deliberation that Night that the Wind became contrary in the Morning—We continued Working to windward up the Firth without being able to reach the Road of Leith till on the Morning of the 17th. when being almost within Cannon Shot of the Town having every thing in readiness for a Descent; a very severe Gale of Wind came on and being directly contrary Obliged us to bear away after having in Vain endeavoured for some time to withstand Its Violence the Gale was so severe that one of the Prizes that had been taken the 14th. sunk to the Bottom the Crew being with difficulty saved— As the alarm had by this time reached Leith by means of a Cutter that had watched our motions that Morning,— &amp; as the Wind continued contrary (tho’ more moderate in the evening) I thought it impossible to pursue the Enterprize with a good prospect of success especially as Edinborough where there is always a Number of Troops is only a Mile distant from Leith; therefore I gave up the Project—

e 21st. We saw and Chased Two Sail off Flambrough Head— The Pallas Chased in the N E Quarter while the Bon home Richard followed by the Vengeance Chased in the S.W.— The one I Chased a Brigantine Collier in Ballast belonging to Scarborough was soon Taken and sunk immediately Afterwards— As a Fleet then appeared to the Southward this was so late in the Day that I could not come up with the Fleet before night at length however I got so near one of them as to force her to run ashore between Flamborough Head and the Spurn— soon after I Took another a Brigantine from Holland belonging to Sunderland and at Day light the Next Morning seeing a Fleet Steering towards me from the Spurn I immagined them to be a Convoy bound from London for Leith which had been for some time expected—one of them had a Pendant Hoisted and appeared to be a Ship of Force— They had not however Courage to come on but kept back all except the one which seemed to be Armed and that one Also kept to Windward very near the Land and on the Edge of Dangerous Shoals where I could not with safety Approach— This induced me to make a Signal for a Pilot and soon afterwards two Pilot Boats came off— They informed me that the Ship that wore a Pendant was an Armed Merchantman And that a Kings Frigate lay there in sight at Anchor within the Humber waiting to take under Convoy a number of Merchant Ships bound to the Northward. The Pilots imagined the Bon homme Richard to be an English Ship of War and consequently communicated to me the Private Signal which they had been required to make— I endeavoured by this means to decoy the Ships out of the Port, but the wind then changing and with the Tide becoming Unfavourable for them; the deception had not the desired Effect; and they wisely put back.— The entrance of the Humber is exceedingly difficult and Dangerous— And as the Pallas was not in sight I thought it imprudent to remain off the Entrance—therefore Steered out again to Join the Pallas off Flamborough Head. In the Night We saw and Chased two Ships untill 3 OClock in the Morning When being at a very small distance from them I made the Private Signal of Reconnoisance which I had given to each Captain before I Sailed from Groa— One half of the Answer only was returned— In this Position both sides lay too till day light When the Ships proved to be the Alliance &amp; the Pallas— On the Morning of that day the 23d. the Brig from Holland not being in sight We Chased a Brigantine that appeared Laying too to Windward— About Noon We saw and Chased a large Ship that appeared coming round Flamborough head from the Northward and at the same time I Manned and Armed one of the Pilots Boats to send in Pursuit of the Brigantine which now appeared to be the Vessel that I had forced ashore— Soon after this a Fleet of 41 Sail appeared off Flamborough Head bearing NNE. This induced me to Abandon the Single Ship which had then Anchored in Burlington Bay; I also called back the Pilot Boat and hoisted a Signal for a general Chase.  
When the Fleet discovered us bearing down all the Merchant Ships Crowded Sail towards the Shore. The Two Ships of War that Protected the Fleet at the same time Steered from the Land and made the disposition for Battle— In approaching the Enemy I crowded every Possible Sail and made the Signal for the line of Battle to which the Alliance shewed no Attention. Earnest as I was for the Action I could not reach the Commodores Ship untill Seven in the Evening being then within Pistol Shot when He hailed the Bon homme Richard. We answered him by Firing a Whole Broadside— The Battle being thus begun was continued with Unremitting Fury—Every method was Practiced on both sides to gain an Advantage and Rake each other— And I must confess that the Enemies Ship being much more Manageable than the Bon homme Richard gained thereby several times an advantagious Situation in spite of my best endeavours to prevent it— As I had to deal with an Enemy of greatly Superiour Force I was under the necessity of closing with him to Prevent the Advantage Which he had over me in Point of Manoeuvre— It was my intention to lay the Bon homme Richard athwart the Enemies Bow but as that Opperation required great dexterity in the Management of both Sails and Helm And some of our Braces being Shot away it did not exactly succeed to my wish.  
The Enemies Bowsprit however came over the Bon homme Richards Poop by— the Mizen Mast and I made both Ships fast together in that Situation which by the Action the Wind on the Enemies Sails forced her Stern close to the Bon home Richards Bow so that the Ships lay square alongside of each Other the Yards being all entangled and the Cannon of each Ship touching the Opponents Side when this Position took Place it was Eight OClock Previous to which the Bonhomme Richard had received sundry Eighteen Pound Shot below the Water and leaked very much.  
My Battery of 12 Pounders on which I had Placed my Chief dependance being Commanded by Lieut. Dale and Col. Wybert and Manned Principally with American Seamen &amp; French Volunteers; was entirely Silenced and Abandoned—as to the Six old 18 Pounders that formed the Battery of the lower Gun Deck they did no service whatever except firing Eight Shot in all— Two out of them Burst at the first Fire and Killed almost all the Men who were stationed to Manage them.  
Before this time too Col. Chamillard who Commanded a Party of 20 Soldiers on the Poop had Abandoned that Station after having lost some of his Men.  
I had now only two Pieces of Cannon (9 Pounders) on the Quarter Deck that were not Silenced and not one of the heavier Cannon was fired during the remainder of the Action—The Purser Mr. Mease who Commanded the Guns on the Quarter Deck being dangerously Wounded in the head I was Obliged to fill his Place &amp; with great difficulty Rallied a few Men and shifted to get over one of the lee Quarter Deck Guns so that We afterwards played three Pieces of Nine pounders upon the Enemy The Tops alone seconded the Fire of this little Battery and held out Bravely during the Whole Action especially the Main Top where Lieutenant Stack Commanded. I directed the Fire of one of the three Cannon against the Main Mast with double Headed Shot while the other two were Exceedingly well served with Grape &amp; Canister Shot to Silence the Enemies Musquetry and Clear her Decks which was at last effected the Enemy were as I have since Understood on the Instant of Calling out for Quarters—When the Cowardice or Treachery of three of my Under Officers induced them to call to the Enemy— The English Commodore Asked me if I Demanded Quarters And I having Answered him in the most determined Negative They renewed the Battle with redoubled Fury— They were unable to stand the Deck but the Fire of their Cannon especially the lower Battery which was entirely form’d of 18 Pounders was incessant.— Both Ships were set on Fire in Various Places And the scene was dreadful beyond the reach of Language— To account for the Timidity of my Three under Officers, I mean the Gunner the Carpenter and the Master at Arms—I must observe that the two First were slightly Wounded And as the Ship had received Various Shot under Water And one of the Pumps being shot away the Carpenter expressed his Fears that she would Sink and the other two concluded that she was Sinking which Occasioned the Gunner to run aft on the Poop without my Knowledge to strike the Colours— Fortunately for me a Cannon ball had done that before by carrying away the Ensign Staff— He was therefore reduced to the Necessity of sinking, as he Supposed, or of Calling for Quarters and he prefered the Latter— All this time the Bon homme Richard had sustained the Action alone And the Enemy tho’ much Superior in Force would have been very glad to have got Clear as Appears by their own Acknowledgments and by their having let go an Anchor the Instant that I laid them on Board by which means they would have escaped had I not made them well fast to the Bonhomme Richard; at last, at half past Nine O’Clock the Alliance appeared &amp; I now thought the Battle at an End but to my Utter Astonishment he discharged a Broadside full into the Stern of the Bon homme Richard— We Called to him for Gods sake to forbear Firing into the Bon homme Richard— Yet he passed along the Off Side of the Ship and Continued Firing—There was no Possibility of his Mistaking the Enemy’s Ship for the Bon homme Richard there being the most essential difference in their appearance &amp; construction—besides it was then full Moon light, And the Sides of the Bon homme Richard were all Black while the Side of the Prize were Yellow—Yet for the greater security I shewed the Signal of our Reconnoissance by putting out Three Lanthorns, One at the head Another at the Stern and the third in the Middle in a Horrizontal line— Every Tongue cried that He was Firing into the wrong Ship but nothing availed. He passed round firing into the Bon homme Richard’s Head, Stern, &amp; Broadside and by one of his Vollies Killed Agreeable to Report several of my best Men and Mortally Wounded an Officer on The Fore Castle only. My Situation was really deplorable the Bon homme Richard received Various Shots under Water from the Alliance the leak gained on the Pumps and the Fire increased Much on board both Ships— Some Officers Persuaded me to Strike of whose Courage and good sense I entertain an High Opinion.— My Treacherous Master at Arms let loose all my Prisoners without my Knowledge and my Prospect became Gloomy Indeed— I would not however give up the Point—The Enemy’s Main Mast began to shake, Their Firing decreased Fast Our’s rather increased And the British Colours were Struck at half an hour Past Ten O’Clock— This Prize proved to be the British Ship of War the Serapis a New Ship of 44 Guns built on their most approved Construction with two Compleat Batteries one of them of 18 Pounders and Commanded by the Brave Commodore Richard Pearson.— I had yet two Enemies to encounter with far more formidable than the Britons I mean fire and Water. The Serapis was attacked only by the first but the Bon homme Richard was Assailed by both— There was five Feet of Water in the Hold and tho’ it was Moderate from the Explosition of so Much Gun Powder Yet three Pumps that remained could with difficulty only Keep the Water from gaining— The Fire broke out in Various Parts of the Ship in spite of all the Water that could be thrown in to quench it and at length broke out as low as the Powder Magazine and within a few Inches of the Powder— In that Dilema I took out the Powder upon Deck ready to be thrown overboard at the last extremity and it was Ten O’Clock the next Day the 24th before the Fire was entirely Extinguished. With respect to the Situation of the Bonhomme Richard The Rudder was cut almost entirely off; the Stern Frame &amp; Transoms Were almost entirely Cut away And the Timbers by the lower Deck especially from the Main Mast towards the Stern being greatly decayed with Age were Mangled beyond my Power of description and A Person must have been an Eye Witness to form a Just Idea of the tremendous Scenes of Carnage Wreck and Ruin which every where appeared— Humanity cannot but recoil from the Prospect of such finished Horror and lament that War should be capable of producing Such fatal Consequences.  
After the Carpenters as well as Captain Cottineau and other Men of sense had well examined &amp; Surveyed the Ship which was not Finished before five in Evening I found every Person to be convinced that it was Impossible to Keep the Bon homme Richard Afloat So as to reach a Port if the Wind should increase it being then only a very Moderate Breeze— I had but little time to remove My Wounded which now became Unavoidable and which was effected in the Course of the Night and Next Morning— I was determined to Keep the Bon homme Richard Afloat and if possible to bring her into Port For that purpose the first Lieutenant of the Pallas continued on board with a Party of Men to Attend the Pumps with Boats in waiting ready to take them on board in Case the Water Should gain on them too Fast; The Wind Augmented in the Night and the next Day on the 25th. So that it was impossible to prevent the Good Old Ship from Sinking—They did not abandon her ’till after Nine OClock— The Water was then up to the lower Deck and a little after Ten I saw with inexpressible Grief the last Glimpse of the Bonhomme Richard— No lives were lost with the Ship—but it was impossible to save the Stores of any Sort Whatever— I lost even the best Part of my Cloaths Books and Papers and several of my Officers lost all their Cloaths and Effects.  
Having thus endeavoured to give a Clear and Simple relation of the Circumstances and events that have attended the little Armament Under my Command I shall freely submit My Conduct therein to the Cencure of my Superiours and the impartial Public— I beg leave however to Observe that the Force that was put under my Command Was far from being well Composed And as the great Majority of the Actors in it have appeared bent on the pursuit of Interest only; I am exceedingly Sorry that they and I have at all been concerned

where I do not command in Chief I have no desire to be in the Secret.  
Captain Cottineau Engaged the Countess of Scarborough and took her after an Hours Action While the Bon homme Richard engaged the Serapis— The Countess of Scarborough is an Armed Ship of 20 Six Pounders and was Commanded by a King’s Officer—  
In the Action the Countess of Scarborough and the Serapis were at a considerable distance asunder and the Alliance as I am Informed Fired into the Pallas &amp; Killed some Men. If it should be asked why the Convoy was Suffered to escape I must answer that I was myself in no Condition to pursue; And that none of the rest shewed any inclination not even M. Ricot who had held off at a distance to Windward during the whole Action; and withheld by Force the Pilot Boat with my Lieutenant and Fifteen Men.— The Alliance too was in a State to pursue the Fleet not having had a Single Man Wounded or a Single Shot fired at her from the Serapis and only three that did Execution from the Countess of Scarborough at such a distance that One Stuck in the Side and the other two Just touched and then dropped into the Water— The Alliance Killed one Man Only on board the Serapis— As Captain Cottineau charged himself with Manning and Securing the Prisoners of the Countess of Scarborough— I think the Escape of the Baltic Fleet cannot so well be charged to his account.  
I should have mentioned that the Main Mast and Mizen Top Mast of the Serapis fell Over Board soon after the Captain had come onboard the Bonhomme Richard

the enemy. During the whole engagement  
the fire of this small battery was feeonded  
only by that of my men from the round tops  
especially the maintop, whete Lieut. Stack  
commanded, I direéted the fire of one of the  
three cannon, loaded with cross-bar shot, a­  
gainst the enemy’s main-mast, while the o-.

the enemy’s musketry and to clear her decks  
which was at length effected. I have fincé

induced them to beg for quarter frem the e­

to know if I asked for quarter ? Asl answer­  
ed in the negative in the most determined  
imanner, the fight began again with redoub­  
led fury ; they werenot able to stay upon  
deck ; but their fire, especially from their  
lower tire, entirely of eiﬁlhteen-pounderi,  
was continual ; the two thips were on fire  
in several-parts, and the fpeétacle they both  
presented was dread ful beyond all expreflion.  
To account for the timidity of my three  
subalterns, the Chief Gunirer, Master Car­  
penter, and Master at Arms, I must observe  
that the two firft were dangerously wounded.  
As the thip had received several thot between

All this time the Bon homme Richard had sustained the action alone,  
and the enemy, though much superior in force, would have been very  
glad to have got clear, as appears by their own acknowledgments, and  
by their having let go an anchor the instant that I laid them on board,  
by which means they would have escaped had I not made them well fast  
to the Bon homme Richard,  
  
At last, at half past 9 o’clock, the Alliance appeared, and I now  
thought the battle at an end; but, to my utter astonishment, he dis-  
ci.arged a broad side full into the stern of the Bon homme Richard.  
We called to him for God’s sake to forbear firing into the Bon homme  
Richard; yet he passed along the off side of the ship and continued fir-  
ing. There was no possibility of his mistaking the enemy&#x27;s ship for the  
Bon homme Richard, there being the most essential difference in their  
appearance and construction; besides, it was then full moon light, and  
the sides of the Bon homme Richard were all biack, while the sides of  
the prizes were yellow; yet for the greater security, I showed the sig-  
nal of our reconnoissance, by putting out three lanthorns, one at the  
head, (bow,) another at the stern, (quarter,) and the third in the middle,  
in a horizontal line. Every tongue cried that he was firing into the  
wrong ship, but nothing availed ; he passed round, firing into the Bon  
homme Richard’s head, stern, and broadside, and by one of his vollies  
killed several of my best men, and mortally wounded a good officer on  
the forecastle. My situation was really deplorable. The Bon homme  
Richard received various shot under water from the Alliance; the leak  
gained on the pumps, and the fire increased much on board both ships.  
Some officers persuaded me to strike, of whose courage and good sense I  
entertain a high opinion. My treacherous master-at-arms let loose all  
my prisoners without my knowledge, and my prospect became gloomy  
indeed. I would not, however, give up the point. The enemy’s main-  
mast began to shake, their firing decreased, ours rather increased, and  
the British colours were struck at half an hour past 10 o’clock,

with an enemy ot greatly «ufirmr force, i

to prevent the advantage which he had over j  
me in point of manœuvre. It was my inten- I  
tion to lav the Boa Homme Richard athwart j  
the enemy s bows, but as that operation  
required great dexterity in the manage- !  
meat of both sails and helm, and some of ;  
our braces being shot away, it did not exact­

the other two were exceedingly well, served  
with grape andcannister tihot to silence the  
enemy &#x27;s musketry, and clear her decks,  
which was at lust effected. The enemy  
were, as I have since understood, on the in­  
fctant of calling for quarters, when the cow­  
firdice or treachery of three of my under offi­  
cers induced them to call to the enemy,  
The English commodore asked me if I Ai­  
mantled quarters, and l having answered  
&quot;him in the most determined negative, they  
renewed the battle with double fury; they  
were unable to stand the deck, but the fire  
of their cannon, especially the lowei battery  
which was entirely formed of 18 pounders,  
was incessant. Both ships were set on fire  
in venous places, and the scene was dread­  
ful !u-yond the reach of language. To ac- ;  
co »at for the timidity of my three under offi­  
cers, 1 mean the gunner, the carpenter, and  
tlr-master-at-arm. I must onserve that the  
tw first were slight!) wounded, and as the  
ship had reçoit cd various shots under wu&amp;(  
ter, anil one of the pumpsfjeing shot away,  
the carpenter expressed his fear that she  
would sink, and the other two concluded  
that shewn* Sinking; which occasioned tin­  
gui.m-r to run alter on the poop without in;

by C : rrying away the ensign staff: he was i  
theremre reduced to the necessity ot sink- !

anu he preferred the latter.  
A.ltms time the Bon Homme Richard had  
su.stameu the action alone, and the enemy, j

There was no possibility of his mistaking the  
enemy&#x27;s ship for the lion Homme Richard,  
there being the most essential difference in  
t their appearance and construction; besides,  
, it was then full moonlight, and thé sides of

I while the sides of the prizes were yellow;  
j vet, for the greater security, I showed the

three lantliorns, one at the head, (bow,) an­  
other at the stern, (quarter,) and the third  
in the middle, in a horizontal line. Every  
i tongue cried that lie was firing into the  
wrong ship, but nothing availed; lie passed  
round, firing into the Bon homme Richard s  
head, stern, and broadsule, and by one of bis  
vollies killed several of my best men, and  
j mortally wounded a good officer, on the  
forecastle. Mv situation was really deplor­

various shot under water tram the Alliance;

in a line; the Bon Homme ran her bows into the stern of the  
Serapis, and Pearson hailed the Bon Homme to know  
whether she had struck. Jones answered, that * he had not  
yet begun to fight.” By this time, however, his ship had  
received several 18 pounders under water, and bathed very  
much: he backed her top-sails, and those of the Serapis  
being filled, the ships separated. By some misfortune the  
bowsprit of the Serapis now came over the Bon Homme’s  
poop by the mizen-mast. Jones immediately grappled. The  
action of the wind on the sails of the Serapis forced her stern  
close to the Bon Homme’s bow, “so that the ships lay square  
alongside of each other, the yards being all entangled, and  
the cannon of each ship touching the opponent&#x27;s side.”  
  
‘« The battle,” to use Jones’s own words, “ was fought with un-  
remitting fury.” ‘The rammers were run into the respective ships  
to enable the men to load. The Serapis now fought with the  
actual view of sinking the enemy, and her broadsides were inces-  
sant. The battery of twelve pounders, on which Jones had placed  
his chief dependance, which was commanded by his only lieutenant,  
and manned by Americans, was entirely silenced and abandoned ;  
of the six old eighteen pounders that formed the battery of the  
lower gun-deck, most burst, and killed almost all the men who  
were stationed to manage them. At the same time, Colonel Cha-  
millard, who commanded a party of twenty French volunteers on  
the poop, abandoned his station, after having lost nearly all his  
band. There were only two nine pounders on the quarter-deck, that  
were not silenced. The purser, who commanded the party that  
worked these guns, was shot through the head; and Jones, in this  
critical moment, when he almost required the faculty of ubiquity,  
was obliged to fill the purser’s place. With great difficulty he  
rallied a few men, and shifted over one of the lee-quarter-deck  
guns ; these three nine pounders played well, but not one of the  
heavier cannon of the Bon Homme was fired during the rest of the  
action.—  
  
‘ Jones directed the fire of one of the three cannons against

few movements brought them in a line 3 the  
Bon Homme ran her bows into the stern of  
the Serapis, and Pearson hailed the Bon  
Homme, to know whether shagnad strack.  
Jones answered, that “he had not yet be-  
gun to fight.” By this time, however, his  
ship had received several 18 pounders un-  
der water, and leaked very much : he back-  
ed her top-sails, and those of the Serapis  
being filled, the ships separated. By some  
misfortune the bowsprit of the Serapis now  
came over the Bon Homme’s poop by the  
mizen mast. Jones immediately grappled  
The action of the wind on the sails of the  
Serapis forced her stern close to the Bon  
Homme’s bow, ‘so that the ships lay  
square along side of each other, the yards  
being all entangled, and the cannon of cach  
ship touching the ofipronent’s side.”  
  
“The battle,” to use Jones’s own words,  
“was fought with unremitting fury.” The  
rammers were run into the respective ships  
to enable the men to load. he Serapis  
now fought with the actual view of sinking  
the enemy, and her broadsides were inces-  
sant; The battery of twelve pounders, on  
which Jones had placed his chief depend-

Licutenant, and manned by Americans, was  
entirely silenced and abandoned ; of the six  
old eighteen pounders that formed the bat-  
tery of the lower gun-deck, most burst,  
and killed almost all the men who were  
stationed to manage them. At the same  
time, Col. Chamillard, who commanded a  
party of twenty French volunteers on the  
poop, abandoned his station, after having  
lost nearly all his band. ‘here were only  
twonine pounders on the quarter deck, that

‘ In approaching the enemy, I crowded every ;  
Kssible sail. and mile the signal for the line of

Earnest as I was for the action, I could not reach

* The battle being thus begun, was continued  
with unremitting fury. Every method was prac­  
tised on both sides to gain an advantage, an ra  
each other; ar.d I mu3t xonfess that the enemy s  
ship, being much more manageable than ic on  
Homme Richard, gained therein&#x27; several times ,  
an advantageous situation in spite of my bes en­  
deavors to prevent it. As I had to deal with an  
enemy of greatly superior force, I was under the  
necessity of closing with him, to prevent the at -  
vantage which he bad over me in poi;it of man­  
oeuvre. It was my intention to lay the B&lt;m Horn-,  
me Richard athwaft the enemy’s bows; but as that I  
operation required great wsterity m the manage­  
ment of bo&#x27;h-sails apd helm, and some of our bra­  
ces being shot away, it did not exactly succeed  
to my wish. The enemy’s bowsprit, however,  
came over the Bon Homme Richard s poop by the  
wizen mast, ai&gt;d I made both ships fast together  
in that situation, which, bv the action of the wind  
on the enemy’s sails,forced her stern close to the :  
Bon Homme Richard&#x27;s bow, so that the ships lay  
• piare alongside of each other, the varus being  
all entangled, and the cannon of each ship touch­  
ing the opponent’?. When this position took place  
it was eight o&#x27;clock, previous to which the Hon  
Homme Riclmrd had received sundry eighteen­  
pound shots below the vva’er, and leaked very  
much. M v batterv of twelve-pounders, on w hicli  
I had placed my chief dependence, being com­  
manded by Lieutenant Dale and Colonel W ai­  
bert, and manned principally with American sea­  
men ami French volunteers, was entirely silenc ed  
a yd abandoned. As to the six old eighteen-poun­  
ders that formed the battery of the lower gun­  
  
deck, they did no service whatever, except nnng  
eigh shot in all. Two out of three ot them burst  
out at the first fire, and killed almost all the men  
who were stationed to manage them. Before this  
tune, too, Colonel de Chamillard, who command­  
ed a party of twenty soldiers on the poop, had  
abandoned that station after having lost some of  
his men. I had now only two pieces of cannon,  
(&#x27;nine pounders,) on the quarter deck, that were  
not silenced, and not one of the heavier cannon  
was fired during the rest of the action. T he pur­  
ser, M. Mease, who commanded the guns on the  
quarter-deck, being dangerously wounded in toe  
head, I was obliged to fill his place, and with great  
difficulty rallied a few men. and shifted over one  
of the lee quarter-deck guns.so that we afterwards  
played thro&lt;^ pieces of nine-pounders upon the  
eocmv. The topsail one seconded the fire of this  
little battery, and held out bravely during the  
whole of the action, especially the main top.  
where Lieutenant Stack commanded. I directed  
the fire of one of the three cannon against the main­  
mast, with double-headed shot, while the other  
two were exceedingly well served with grape and  
canister shot, to silence the enemy’s musketry,  
and clear her decks, which was at last effected.  
The enemy were, as I have since understood, on  
the instant of calling for quarters, when the  
cowardice or treachery of three of my under offi­  
cers induced them to call to the enemy. The  
English Commodore asked me if I demanded  
Suarters, and I having answered him in the most  
etermined negative they renewed the battle with  
double fury. They were unable to stand the deck;  
but the fireoLtheir cannon, especially the lower  
battery, which was entirely formed of ten-poun­  
ders, was incessant; both ships were set on fire in  
various places, and the scene was dreadful bevond  
the reach of language. To account for the timi­  
dity of my three under-officers, I mean the gun­  
ner, the carpenter, &amp;. the master-at-arms, I must  
observe, that the two first were slightly wounded,  
and, as the ship had received various shots under  
water, and one of the pumps being shot away,the  
carpenter expressed his fears that she would sink,  
and the other two concluded that she was sinking,  
which occasioned the gunner to run aft on the

therefore reduced to the necessity of sinking, as  
he supposed, or of calling for quarter, and he  
preferred the latter.  
4 All this time the Bon Homme Richard had  
sustained the action alone, and the enemy, though  
much superior iu force, would have been very  
glad to have got clear, as appears by their own ac­  
knowledtnents, and bv they having let go an an­  
chor the very instant that 1 laid them on board,by  
which means they would have escaped, had I not  
made them well fast 10 the Bon Homme Richard.  
• At last, at half past nine o&#x27;clock, the Alliance  
appeared, and I now thought the battle at an end;  
but to my utter astonishment, he discharged a  
broadside full into the stern of the Bon Homme  
Richard. We called to him for God&#x27;s sake to  
forbear tiring into the Ron Homme Richard; yet  
they passed along the off side of the ship, and con­  
tinued firing. There was no possibility of his  
mistaking the enemy’s ships for the Bon Homme  
Richard, there being the most essential difference  
in their appearance and construction. Besides,  
it was then full moonlight, and the sides of the  
Bon Homme Richard were all black, while the  
sides of die prize were all vellow. Yet, for the  
greater security, I show ed the signal of our re­  
connoissance, by putting out three lantherns, one  
at the head, another at the stern, and the third in  
the middle, in a horizontatil*e. Every tongue  
cried that he was firing into the wrong ship, but  
nothing availed; he passed round, firing into the  
Bon lfomme Richard’s he-d, stern, and broad­  
side, and by one of his volleys killed several of j  
my best men, and mortally wounded a good offi­  
cer on die forecastle only. My situation was |  
really deplorable; the Bon Hotnrae Richard re-!  
ceivetl various shotunder water from the Alliance;  
the leak gained on the pumps, and the fire increas­  
ed much on board both ships. Some officers per­  
suaded me t(f strike, of whose courage and good  
sense l entertain a high opinion. M v treacher­  
ous master-at-arms let loose all my prisoners with­  
out my knowledge, and my prospects became  
gloomy indeed. I would not, however, give up  
the point. The enemy’s main-mast began to  
shake, the firing decreased fast, ours rather in­  
creased, and the British colours were struck at  
half an hour past ten o&#x27;clock.

continued on board w ith a partyjofnien, to attend

the water was then up to her lower deck, and a  
little after ten. I saw with inexpressible grief,  
the last glimpse of the Bon Hi mine Richard.—  
No lives were lost with the ship, but it was im­  
possible to save the stores of any sort whatever.  
I lost even the best part of my clothes, books,

itants. We have now the history of this most  
daring enterprise from Jones himself, as given  
helow. Lieutenant Dawe, referred to in the  
account, died in this city about five years  
sinee—  
  
Sepremper 23, 1779.—In approaching the  
enemy I crowded every possible sail, and  
made the signal for the line of battle, to which  
the Alliance showed no attention. Earnest  
as 1 was for the action, I could not reach the  
Commodore’s ship until -7 in the evening,  
being then within pistol shot, when he hailed  
the Bon Homme Richard. We answered  
him by firing a whole broadside.  
  
The battle thus begun, was continued with  
unremitting fury. Every method was practis-  
ed on both sides to gain an advantage, and  
rake each other; and I must confess that the  
enemy’s ship being much more manageable  
than the Bon Homme Richard, gained there-  
by several times an advantageous situation, in  
spite of my best endeavors to prevent it. As  
I had to deal with an enemy of greatly super-  
ior force, I was under the necessity of closing  
with him, to prevent the advantage which he  
  
had over me in point of maneuvre. It was  
my intention to lay the Bon Homme Richard  
athwart the enemy’s bows; but as the opera-  
tion required great dexterity in the manage-  
ment of’ both sails and helm, and some of our  
sails being shot away, it did not succeed ex-  
actly to my wish. The enemy’s bowsprit  
came over the Bon Homme Richard’s poop  
by the mizen mast, and I made both ships fast  
together in that situation, which, by the action  
of the wind on the enemy’s sails, forced her  
stern close tothe Bon Homme Richard’s bow,  
so that the ships lay alongside of each otter,  
the yards being all entangled, and the cannon  
of each ship touching the opponent’s. When  
this position took place, it was eight o&#x27;clock,  
previous to which the Bon Homme Richard  
had received sundry eighteen pound shot® be-  
low the water, and leaked very much. My  
battery of twelve-pounders, on which I had  
placed my chief dependence, being command-  
ed by Lieutenant Dale and Colonel Werbert,  
and manned principally with American sea-  
men and French volunteers, was entirely si-  
lenced and abandoned—As to the six old eigh-  
teen pounders that formed the battery of the  
lower gun deck, they did no service whatev-  
er, except firing eight shots in all. Two out  
of three of them burst out at the first fire, and  
killed almost all the men who were stationed  
to manage them. Before this time, too, Col-  
onel de Chamillard, who commanded a party  
of twenty soldiers on the poop, had abandoned  
that station after having lost some of his men.  
[ had only two pieces of cannon, (nine pound-  
ers) on the quarter deck, that were not si-  
leneed, and not one of the heavier cannon was  
fired during the rest of the action. The purs-  
er, M. Mease, who commanded the guns on  
the quarter-deck, being dangerously wound-  
ed in the head, I was obliged to fill his place,  
and with great difficulty rallied a few men  
and shifted over one of the lee quarter-deck  
guns, so that we afterwards played three  
pieces of nine pounders upon the enemy.—  
‘The tops alone seconded the fire of this little  
battery, and held out bravely during the  
whole of the action, especially the main top,  
where Lieutenant Stack commanded. I di-  
rected the fire of one of the three cannon  
against the main-mast with double-headed  
shot, while the other two were exceedingly  
well served with grape and canister shot to  
silence the enemy’s musketry, and clear the  
  
decks, which was ast effected. The enemy |.  
  
were, as I have since understood, on the in-  
stant of calling for quarters, when the cowar-  
dice or treachery of three of my under offi-  
cers, induced them to call to the enemy. The  
English Commodore asked me if I demanded  
quarter, and [ having answered him in the  
most decided negative, they renewed the bat-  
tle with double fury. They were unable to  
stand the deck; but the fire of the cannon, es-  
pecially. the lower battery, which was entire-  
ly formed of ten pounders, was incessant: both  
ships were set on fire in various places, and  
the scene was dreadful beyond the reach of lan-  
guage. ‘To account for the timidity of my  
three under officers, ] mean the gunner, the  
carpenter and the master at arms, | must ob-  
serve, that the two first were slightly wound-  
ed, and, as the ship had received various shots  
under water, and one of the pumps being shot  
away, the carpenter expressed his fears that  
she would sink, and the other two concluded  
she was sinking, which occasioned the gunner  
to run aft on the poop, and, without my knowl-  
  
edge, strike the colors. Fortunately for me,  
a cannon ball had done that before, by carry-  
ing away the ensign staff, he was therefore  
reduced to the necessity of sinking as he sup-  
posed, or of calling for quarter, and he pre-  
ferred the latter.  
  
All this time the Bon Homme Richard had  
sustained the action alone, and the enemy,  
though greatly superior in force, would have  
been very glad to have got clear, as appears  
by their own acknowledgment, and by their  
having let go an anchor the instant that I laid  
them on board, by which means they would  
have escaped, had I not made them well fe  
to Bon Homme Richard. -  
  
Atlast, at half past eight o’clock, the Alli-  
ance appeared, and I now thought the battle  
atan end; but, to my utter astonishment, he  
discharged a broadside full into the stern of the  
Bon Homme Richard. We called to him for  
God’s sake to forbear firing into the Bon  
Homme Richard ; yet they passed along the  
offside of the ship, and continued firing.—  
There was no possibility of hismistaking the  
enemy’s ship for the Bon Homme Richard,  
there being the most essential difference in  
their appearance and construction, Besides,  
the moon was then at full, and the sides of the  
  
Bon Homme Richard were all black, while | °&quot;  
| pumps,  
  
the sides of the prize were all yellow. Yet,  
for the greater security, | immediately show-  
ed the signal of our reconnoisance, by putting  
out three lanterns, one at the head, another at  
the stern, anda third in the middle, in hori-  
zontal line. Every tongue cried that he was  
firing into the wrong ship, but nothing avail-  
ed; he passed round, firing into the Bon  
Homme Richard&#x27;s head, stern, and broadside ;  
and by one of his volleys killed several of my  
best men, and mortally wounded a good officer  
on the forecastle. My situation was truly de-  
plorable; the Bon Homme Richard received  
various shots under water, from the Alliance !  
the leak gained on the pumps, and the fire in-  
creased much on board both ships. Some of-  
ficers persuaded me to strike, of whose cour-  
age and good sense I entertain a high opinion.  
My treacherous master at arms let loose all  
my prisoners, without my knowledge; my  
prospects became gloomy ‘indeed ; I wogie not  
however, give up the point. The en@my’s  
main-mast began to shake, their fire decreased  
fast, ours rather increased ;—the British colors  
were struck at half past ten o’clock.  
  
war Serapis, a new ship of forty-four guns,  
built on the most approved construction, with  
two complete batteries, one of them of eigh-  
teen-pounders, and commanded by the brave  
Commodore Pearson. I had yet two enemies  
  
to encounter, far more formidable than the |  
  
Briton—I mean fire and water. The Serapis  
Was attacked only by the first, but the Bon  
Homme Richard was assailed by both; there  
was five feet water in the hold, and though  
it was moderate, from the explosion of so much  
gunpowder, yet the three pumps that remain-  
ed, with difficulty only kept the water froz.:  
gaining.  
of the ship, in spite of all the water that could  
be thrown in to quench it, and broke out as  
low as the powder magazine, and within a  
few inches of the powder. In that dilemma,  
I took out the powder upon deck, ready to be  
thrown overboard at the last extremiiy, and  
it was ten o&#x27;clock the next day (the 24th) be-  
fore the fire was entirely extinguished. With  
respect to the situation of the Bon Homme  
  
Richard, the rudder was cut entirely off, the  
stern frame and transoms, were almost entire-  
ly cut away, and the timbers by the lower  
deck, especially from the main-mast toward  
the stern being greatly decayed with age,  
were mangled beyond my power of descrip-  
tion, and a person must have been an eye wit-  
ness, to form a just idea of the tremendous  
scene of carnage, wreck, and ruin, which ev-  
ery where appeared. Humanity cannot but  
recoil from the prospect of such finished hor-  
ror, and lament that war should be capable of  
producing such fatal consequences. *  
  
After the carpenters, as well as Captain  
otineau and other men of sense had well ex-  
‘amined and surveyed the ship, (which was  
not finished before five in the evening,) ] found  
every person to be convinced that it was im-  
possible to keep the Bon Homme Richard  
afloat, so as to reach a port, ifthe wind should  
increase, it being then a moderate breeze. I  
had but little time to remove my wounded,  
which now became unavoidable, and which  
was effected in the course of the night and  
the next morning. I wasdetermined to keep  
the Bon Homme Richard afloat, and if  possi-  
  
The prize proved to be the British ship of  
  
The fire broke out in various parts |  
  
ble to bring her into port. For that purpose,  
| the first Lieutenant of the Pallas continwed  
board with a party of men to attend the  
with boats in waiting, ready to take  
&#x27; them on board in case the water should gain  
| too fast. The wind augmenting in the night  
and the next day, the 25th, so that it was Im-  
&#x27; possible to prevent the good old ship from sink-

deck, and a little after ten, I saw, with inex-  
pressible grief, the last glimpse of the Bon  
Homme Richard. No lives were lost with  
the ship, but it was impossible to save the  
stores of any sort whatever. I Jost even the  
best part of my clothes, bcoks, and papers;  
and several of my officers lost all their clothes  
and effects.

every one of the truthful simplicity and can­  
dor of his statement, speaks of the Alli­  
ance as coming to help Capt. Jones, but in­  
juring the Richard as much by his broadside  
as he did the Serapis. Capta Jones charges  
that Landais fired into him intentionally.  
He says:  &quot;At last, at half-past nine o&#x27;clock,  
the Alliance appeared, and I now thought the  
battle at an end; but, to my utter astonish­  
ment, he discharged a broadside full into the  
stern of the Bon Homme Richard. We called  
to him, for God&#x27;s sake to forbear firing into  
the Bon Homme Richard, yet he passed along  
the off-side of the ship and continued firing.  
  
There was no possibility of his mistaking the  
enemy&#x27;s ship for the Bon Homme Richard,  
there being the most essential difference in  
their appearance and construction; besides,  
it was then full moonlight, and the sides of  
the Bon Homme Richard were all black, while  
the sides of the prizes were yellow; yet, for  
the greater security, I showed the signal of  
our reconnoisance, by putting out three lan­  
therns, one at the bow, another at the stern,  
and the third in the middle, in a horizon tal  
line. Every tongue cried that he was firing  
into the wrong ship, but nothing availed; he  
passed round, firing into the Bon Homme  
Richard&#x27;s head, stern and broadside, and by  
one of his vollies killed several of my best men,  
and mortally wounded a good officer on the  
forecastle. My situation was really deplorable.  
The Bon Homme Richard received various  
shots under water from the Alliance; the leal­  
gained on the pumps, and the fire increased  
much on board both ships. Some officers per­  
suaded me to strike, of whose courage and  
good sense I entertain a high opinion. My  
treacherons Master-at-Arms let loose all my  
prisoners without my knowledge, and my  
prospects became gloomy indeed. I would not,  
however, give up the point. The enemy&#x27;s  
mainmast began to shake, their flring decreased,  
ours rather increased. The British colors  
were struck at half an hour past ten o&#x27;clock.

He was anxious to keep the Richard afloat, and to bring

laden with ? ” to which the Americans shouted,  
“ Round, grape, and double-headed shot!”  
  
With the best dispositions to fight in the  
world, the two ships did not come to close  
quarters until seven in the evening. The Bon  
Homme Richard fired the first broadside, which  
was promptly returned. Of what followed Paul  
Jones himself, in his official report, tells the  
story better than anybody else.  
  
The battle being thus begun Was Continued  
with unremitting fury. Every method was prac-  
tised on both sides to gain an advantage and rake  
each other; and I must confess that the Enemie’s  
ship being much more manageable than the  
B. h. R. gained thereby Several times an advan-  
tageous Situation in Spite of my best endeavors  
to prevent it, as I had to deal with an Enemy of

of Closing with him to prevent the advantage  
which he had over me in point of manceuvre. It

Enemie’s bow, but as that operation required  
great dexterity in the management of both Sails,  
and helm and Some of our braces being shot  
away, it did not exactly succeed to my Wishes.  
the Enemie’s bowsprit came over the B. A. R’s.  
poop by the mizenmast and I made both ships fast  
together.  
  
At this point occurred an incident which  
marks Paul Jones’s coolness in desperate cir-  
cumstances ; for, as told by him further on, his  
ship was aleak and afire in a dozen places, her  
batteries were silenced, a hundred prisoners be-  
low were ready to spring up, and some of his  
petty officers were calling for quarter. Whe

ever mark him as one of the bravest of the brave.

nate mistake, as no man took up a pike but him-  
self.  
  
The Serapis was well manned, but her crew  
was probably out-of heart before their officers  
were.  
  
The American topmen had then climbed into  
the Serapis’s tops, carrying with them a tub of  
water to put out the fire which had begun to  
smolder in the maintop. They succeeded in  
doing this, and then completely commanded  
the spar-deck, upon which no man but Cap-  
tain Pearson was permitted to show himself.  
  
They Were unable to Stand the deck, but the  
fire of their Cannon especially the lower battery  
which was Entirely formed of 18 pounders Was  
incessant. Both Ships were set on fire in Various  
places and the scene was dreadful beyond the reach  
of Language. to account for the timidity of my  
three under officers I mean the gunner, the Car-  
pinter and the master-at-arms, I must observe  
that the two first were slightly Wounded and as  
the Ship had received various shots under Water,  
and one of the pumps being shot away, the Car-  
pinter expressed his fear that she should sink,  
and the other two Concluded that she Was sink-  
ing; Which occasioned the gunner to run aft on  
the poop Without my knowledge to strike the  
Colours. fortunately for me a Cannon ball had  
done that before by Carrying away the Ensign  
staff. he was therefore reduced to the necessity  
of Sinking, as he Supposed, or of Calling for quar-  
ter, and he prefered the Latter.  
  
Paul Jones does not mention that he knocked  
the gunner down with his pistol-butt. The  
only punishment given the man afterward was  
to stand him at the mast.  
  
All this time the 2. 2. &amp;. had sustained the ac-  
tion alone, and the Enemy tho’ much Superior in  
force Would have been Very glad to have got  
clear, as appears by their own acknowledgments,  
and by their having let go an anchor the instant  
that I Let them on board, by Which means they  
would have escaped, had I not made them Well  
fast to the B. 2. R.  
  
At Last, at half past nine o’clock the A//iance  
appeared and I now thought the battle at an end,  
but to my utter astonishment he discharged a  
broadside full into the Stern of the B. 4. R. We  
called to him for god’s sake to forbear firing into  
the B. 4. R. Yet he passed along the off side of  
the Ship and continued firing. there Was no pos-  
sibility of his mistaking the Enemie’s ship for the  
B. h. R. there being the most essential difference  
in their appearance and Construction, besides it  
Was then full moon Light and the Sides of the  
B. h. R. Were all black, While the Sides of the  
prises were yellow. Yet for the greater Security

I had yet two Enemies to encounter far more  
formidable than the britons, I mean fire and  
Water. the Sevafis Was attacked only by the  
first, but B. 4. &amp;. Was assailed by both, there was  
five feet Water in the hould, and tho’ it Was  
moderate from the Explosion of so much gun  
powder, yet the three pumps that remained could  
with difficulty only keep the Water from gaining.  
the fire broke out in Various parts of the Ship in  
spite of all the Water that Could be thrown (im-  
mediately) to quench it, and at lenth broke out  
as low as the powder magazine and within a few  
(feet) inches of the powder. in that dilema I took  
out the powder upon deck ready to be thrown  
overboard at the last extremity, and it Was ten  
O’clock A. M. the next day the 24 before the fire  
Was entirely extinguished. With respect to the  
Situation of the B. 4. R. the rudder Was cut En-  
tirely off the stern frame and transoms Were al-  
most Entire Cut away (and) the timbers by the  
lower Deck especially from the mainmast to the  
stern, being greatly decayed With age, were

a Just idea of the tremendous scene of carnage,  
Wreck and Ruin (which) that Every Where ap-  
peared. humanity cannot but Recoil from the  
prospect of such finished horror and Lament that  
War should (be capable of producing) produce  
such fatal consequences.  
  
After the Carpinters as well as Captain De  
Cottineau and other men of Sense had well ex-  
amined and Surveyed the Ship (which was not  
finished before five in the Evening) I found every  
person to be convinced that it was Impossible to  
keep the B. A. R. afloat So as to reach a port if

the Wind Should increase it being then only a

remove my Wounded, which now became un-  
avoidable and which Was effected in the Course
