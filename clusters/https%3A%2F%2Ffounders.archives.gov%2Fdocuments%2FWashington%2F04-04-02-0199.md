Dear Sir  
Mount Vernon 15th Augt 1786  
  
I have to thank you very sincerely for your interesting letter of the 27th of June, as well as for the other communications you had the goodness to make at the same time.  
I am sorry to be assured, of what indeed I had little doubt before, that we have been guilty of violating the treaty in some instances. What a misfortune it is the British should have so well grounded a pretext for their palpable infractions?—and what a disgraceful part, out of the choice of difficulties before us, are we to act?  
Your sentiments, that our affairs are drawing rapidly to a crisis, accord with my own. What the event will be is also beyond the reach of my foresight. We have errors to correct. We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation. Experience has taught us, that men will not adopt &amp; carry into execution, measures the best calculated for their own good without the intervention of a coercive power. I do not conceive we can exist long as a nation, without having lodged somewhere a power which will pervade the whole Union in as energetic a manner, as the authority of the different state governments extends over the several States. To be fearful of vesting Congress, constituted as that body is, with ample authorities for national purposes, appears to me the very climax of popular absurdity and madness. Could Congress exert them for the detriment of the public without injuring themselves in an equal or greater proportion? Are not their interests inseperably connected with those of their constituents? By the rotation of appointment must they not mingle frequently with the mass of citizens? Is it not rather to be apprehended, if they were possessed of the powers before described, that the individual members would be induced to use them, on many occasions, very timidly &amp; inefficatiously for fear of loosing their popularity &amp; future election? We must take human nature as we find it. Perfection falls not to the share of mortals. Many are of opinion that Congress have too frequently made use of the suppliant humble tone of requisition, in applications to the States, when they had a right to assume their imperial dignity and command obedience. Be that as it may, requisitions are a perfect nihility, where  
  
thirteen sovereign, independent⟨,⟩ disunited States are in the habit of discussing &amp; refusing compliance with them at their option. Requisitions are actually little better than a jest and a bye word through out the Land. If you tell the Legislatures they have violated the treaty of peace and invaded the prerogatives of the confederacy they will laugh in your face. What then is to be done? Things cannot go on in the same train forever. It is much to be feared, as you observe, that the better kind of people being disgusted with the circumstances will have their minds prepared for any revolution whatever. We are apt to run from one extreme into another. To anticipate &amp; prevent disasterous contingencies would be the part of wisdom &amp; patriotism.  
What astonishing changes a few years are capable of producing! I am told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical form of government without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking, thence to acting is often but a single step. But how irrevocable &amp; tremendous! What a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves, and that systems founded on the basis of equal liberty are merely ideal &amp; falacious! Would to God that wise measures may be taken in time to avert the consequences we have but too much reason to apprehend.  
Retired as I am from the world, I frankly acknowledge I cannot feel myself an unconcerned spectator. Yet having happily assisted in bringing the ship into port &amp; having been fairly discharged; it is not my business to embark again on a sea of troubles. Nor could it be expected that my sentiments and opinions would have much weight on the minds of my Countrymen—they have been neglected, tho’ given as a last legacy in the most solemn manner. I had then perhaps some claims to public attention. I consider myself as having none at present. With sentiments of sincere esteem &amp; frie

Congress with the power of laying an impost of five per cent., to  
provide for the discharge cf the public debts and engagements,  
was defeated by the ots!inate refiisal of a single state. So that,  
in fact, there was a virtual dissolution of the confederation, and  
Congress was left at once powerless and moneyless, without  
influence and without support. ‘ Requisitions,’ says Geueral  
Washington, in a letter written to Mr Jay in 1786, ‘ sre a perfect  
nullity, where thirteen independent, disunited states are in the  
habit of discussing and- refusing, or complying with them at

-Your sentiments, that our affairs are drawing rapid.­  
ly to a crisis, accord with my own what the  
event will be, is also beyond the reach of my  
foresight. We have errors to correct; we­  
have probably had too good an opinion of  
  
human nature in forming our confederation. Ex  
has taught us that men will not adopt and  
sarry into execution i easures the best calculated for  
their own good without the intervention of coercive  
power I do not conceive we can exist long as a na  
tion without lodging somewhere a power which will  
the whole Union, in as energetic a manner as  
the authority of the State Governments extends over  
the several States. To be fearful of investing Congress,  
constituted as that body is, with ample authoritias for  
national purpeses, appears to me the very climax of  
pepular absurdity and madness. Could Congress  
exert them for the detriment of the people, without  
injurieg themselves in an equal or greater propor.­  
tion? Are not their interests inseparably connect.­  
e with those of their constituents? By the ro-­  
tation of aspeintment, must they not mingle fre.­  
qently with the mass of citizens? Is it not  
rather to be apprenended, if they were possess.  
ed of the powers before described, that the in  
dividual members would be induced to use them, on  
 many occarions very timidly and inefficaciously, for  
tear of locing their popularity and futare election  
We must take human nature as we find it perfectio  
falls not to the share of mortals. Many are of wpinion  
that Congress have too frequently made use of the  
suppliant humble, tone of requisition, in apolications  
to the states when they had a right to exert their im  
perial dignity, and command obedience He that as it  
 may requisitions are a perfect uullity, where thirteen  
covereign independent disunited States, are in the  
habit of discussing, and refusing or complying with  
them at their option. Requisitions are astually little  
better than a jest and a bye word throughout the land  
I you tell the legislatures they have violated th  
tresty of peace, and invaded the prerogatives of th  
confederacy they will laugh in your face What, then,  
is to be ene? Things cannot go on in the sam  
train forever. It is much to be feared, as you obe­  
serve that the better kind of people, being disgusted  
with these circumstances, will have their minds pre-­  
pared for any kind of revolution whatever We are

&#x27;I am told that even respectable  
characters speak of a mouarchial form  
of government without horror. From  
thinking proceeds speaking ; thence to  
acting is often but a single step. But  
how irrevocable and tremendous ! &quot;What

on the basis of equal liberty are merely  
ideal and fallacies ? Would to God that  
wise measures may be taken in time to  
avert the consequences we have but too  
much reason to apprehend.
