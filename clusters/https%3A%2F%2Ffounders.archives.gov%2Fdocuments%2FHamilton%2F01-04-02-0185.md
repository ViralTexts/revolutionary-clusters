[New York, December 26, 1787]  
  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
THAT there may happen cases, in which the national government may be necessitated to resort to force, cannot be denied. Our own experience has corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of other nations; that emergencies of this sort will sometimes arise in all societies, however constituted; that seditions and insurrections are unhappily maladies as inseparable from the body politic, as tumours and eruptions from the natural body; that the idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law (which we have been told is the only admissible principle of republican government) has no place but in the reveries of those political doctors, whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of experimental instruction.  
Should such emergencies at any time happen under the national government, there could be no remedy but force. The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief. If it should be a slight commotion in a small part of a State, the militia of the residue would be adequate to its suppression: and the natural presumption is, that they would be ready to do their duty. An insurrection, whatever may be its immediate cause, eventually endangers all government: Regard to the public peace, if not to the rights of the Union, would engage the citizens, to whom the contagion had not communicated itself, to oppose the insurgents: And if the general government should be found in practice conducive to the prosperity and felicity of the people, it were irrational to believe that they would be disinclined to its support.  
If on the contrary the insurrection should pervade a whole State, or a principal part of it, the employment of a different kind of force might become unavoidable.

Independent of all other reasonings upon the subject, it is a full answer to those who require a more peremptory provision against military establishments in time of peace, that the whole power of the proposed government is to be in the hands of the representatives of the people. This is the essential, and after all the only efficacious security for the rights and privileges of the people which is attainable in civil society.  
  
Its full efficacy will be examined hereafter.  
  
  
If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defence, which is paramount to all positive forms of government; and which, against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success, than against those of the rulers of an individual State. In a single State, if the persons entrusted with supreme power became usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions or districts, of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defence. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. The usurpers, cloathed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo. The smaller the extent of territory, the more

rease with the increased extent of the state; provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. The natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small; and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny. But in a confederacy the people, without exaggeration, may be said to be entirely the masters of their own fate. Power being almost always the rival of power; the General Government will at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of the state governments; and these will have the same disposition towards the General Government. The people, by throwing themselves into either scale, will infallibly make it preponderate. If their rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other, as the instrument of redress. How wise will it be in them by cherishing the Union to preserve to themselves an advantage which can never be too highly prised!  
It may safely be received as an axiom in our political system, that the state governments will in all possible contingencies afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority. Projects of usurpation cannot be masked under pretences so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men as of the people at large. The Legislatures will have better means of information. They can discover the danger at a distance; and possessing all the organs of civil power and the confidence of the people, they can at once adopt a regular plan of opposition, in which they can combine all the resources of the community. They can readily communicate with each other in the different states; and unite their common forces for the protection of their common liberty.  
The great extent of the country is a further security. We have already experienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign power. And it would have precisely the same effect against the enterprises of ambitious rulers in the national councils. If the fœderal army should be able to quell the resistance of one state, the distant states would be able to make head with fresh forces. The advantages obtained in one place must be abandoned to subdue the opposition in others; and the moment the part which had been reduced to submission was left to itself its efforts would be renewed and its resistance revive.  
We should recollect that the extent of the military force must at all events be regulated by the resources of the country. For a long time to come, it will not be possible to maintain a large army: and as the means of doing this increase, the population and natural strength of the community will proportionably increase. When will the time arrive, that the fœderal Government can raise and maintain an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the people of an immense empire; who are in a situation, through the medium of their state governments, to take measures for their own defence with all the celerity, regularity and system of independent nations? The apprehension may be considered as a disease, for which there can be found no cure in the resources of argument and reasoning.

Alexander Hamilton favored the doctrine  
of secession; and the 28th number of the  
Federalist is cited to prove it. We call the  
reader&#x27;s attention to the language of the  
writer as the best refutation of this pre­  
tension: &quot;The natural strength of the peo­  
ple in a large community, in proportion to  
the artificial strength of the Government, is  
greater than in a small; and of course more  
competent to a struggle with the attempta  
of the Government to establish a tyranny.  
But in a confederacy, the people, without  
exaggeration, may be said to be entirely  
masters of their own fate. Power being  
almost always the rival of power, the gene­  
ral government will, at all times, stand ea­  
dy to check the usurpations of the state  
governments, and these will have the same  
dispositions to the general government.  
The people, by throwing themseives into  
either scale, will infallibly make it prepon­  
derate. If their rights are invaded by es­  
ther, they can make use of the other as the  
instrument of redress. How wise will it  
be in them, by cherishing the Union, to  
preserve to themselves an advantage which  
can never be too highly prized.  
&quot;It may safely be received as an axiom  
  
in our political system, that the State gov­  
cinments will, in all possible contingencies,  
afford complete security against invasions  
of the public liberty by the national authori­  
ty. Projects of ursurpation cannot be  
masked under pretences so likely to es­  
cape the penetration of select bodies of  
men as of the people at large. The legis­  
lature will have better means of informa­  
tion; they can discover the danger at a dis­  
tance; and possessing all the organs of civil  
power, and the confidence of the people,  
they can at once adopt a regular plan of  
opposition, in which they can cemlane all  
the resources of the community. They  
can readily communicate with cach other  
in the disferent states; and unite their com­  
mon forces for the protection of the come  
mon liberty.&quot; Ill this to enable a state to  
take up her bed and walk ont of the

peaceable secession&quot;?? Or was it neces­  
sary for the attendance of all these other

aknowledged the right of the separate States to form  
armed cembinations against the Federal authority, but  
even urged the undoubted possession of that right as ar­  
gument for their permanent security from encroachment,  
an argument so powerful as, in his judgment, to render  
all apprehensions chimerical:  
&quot;It may safely be received as an axiom in our political  
system, that the State Governments will, in all possible  
contingencies, afford complete security against invasions  
of the public liberty by the national authority. Projects  
of usurpation cannot be masked under pretences so like­  
y te csape the penctraion of selest bodies of mena  
of the people at large. The Legislatures will have bet­  
  
ter means of information; they can discover the danger

and the confidence of the people they can at once

combine all the tespbyces of the community. They can  
readily commeidicat, with each other in the different  
States; and unite their commion forces for the protection  
of their common liberty.  
&quot;The great extent of the country is a further security.  
We have already experienced its ultility against the at­  
tacks of a foreign enemy. And it would have precisely  
the same effect against the enterprises of ambitious  
rulers in the National Councils. If the federal army  
should be able to quell the resistance of one State, the  
distant States would have it in their power to make head  
with fresh forces. The advantages obtained in one place  
must be abandoned, to subdue the opposition in others;  
and the moment the part which had been reduced to sub  
mission was left to itself, its efforts would be renewed  
and its resistance revive.  
&quot;We should recollect that the extent of the military  
force must, at all events, be regulated by the resources  
of the country. For a long time to come, it will not be  
possible to maintain a large army; and as the means of  
doing this increase, the population and the natural  
strength of the community will proportionably increase.  
When will the time arrive, that the Federal Government  
can raise and maintain an army capable of erecting a  
despotism over the great body of the people of an im­  
mense empire, who are in a situation, through the medi­  
um of their State Governments, to take measures for  
their own defence, with all the celerity, regularity and  
system of independent nations? The apprehension may  
be considered as a disease for which there can be found  
no cure in the resources of argument and reasoning

people of the States? Who has power  
to punish such a violation of trust?  
Certainly no one but the people of the  
States, whuse trusts are thus abused.  
In such case the delegated powers ne-  
cessarily revert to the State Govern-  
ments, which may arraign and punish  
the delinquents, wherever found within  
their jurisdiction, This great truth is  
  
THOUGHTS ON THE NATURE OF THE UNION,  
  
[October,  
  
affirmed by Hamilton in the 28th num-  
ber of the Federalist, where he says ;  
  
‘If the representatives of the people be-  
tray their constituents, there is then no re.  
source left but in the execation of that origi-  
nal right of self-defence, which is paramount  
to all positive forms of government; and  
which against the usurpation of the national  
rulers may be exacted with infinitely better  
prospect of success than against those of the  
rulers of an individual State.”  
  
Now what does this mean? Why,  
plainly that it is the eternal right of a  
State to punish a member of Congress  
for usurping powers not delegated to  
that body, or fur aiding in the passage  
of acts which are intended to rob, and  
do rob, the State of its property and  
its rights. For instance, if Congress  
passes an act by which the sovereign-  
ty of a State is actually violated, and  
its property destroyed, it is clearly the  
right of the injured State to seize and  
punish every member of Congress aid-  
ing in the passage of such act, when-  
ever found within its jurisdiction. Th

The States have the right, and we de-  
voutly trust in God that the time is  
not far off when they will fully regain  
their power to punish all the violators  
of their sovereignty. Alexander Ham-  
ilton, in writing to the people of New  
York to induce them to adopt the Fe  
deral Constitution, said :  
  
“It may be safely received as an axiom in  
our political system, that the State Govern-  
ments will, in alt possible contingencies, af-  
ford complete security against invasions of  
the public liberty by the national authority.  
Projects of usurpation cannot escape the  
penetration of select bodies of men, as the  
people at lerge. The legislatures (of the  
States) will have better means of information.  
They (the Slates) can discover the danger at  
a distance ; and possessing all the organs of  
civil power, and the confidence of the people,  
they cin at once adopt a regular plan of op-  
positicn in which they can combine all the  
resources of the community. They can  
readily communicate with each other in the  
States ; and can unite their common forces,  
for the protection of their common liberty  
(against the usurpaltions of the Federal Govern-  
ment.) The great extent of the country is a  
further security. We have already expe-  
rienced its utility against a foreign power,  
and it would have precisely the same effect  
against the enterprises of ambitious rulers  
in the national councils. 1f the federal ar-  
my should be able to quell the resistance of  
one State, the distant States would have it  
in their power to make head with fresh  
forces. The advantages obtained in one  
place must be abandoned to subdue the op-  
position in others ; and the moment the  
part which had been reduced to submission  
was left to itself, its efforts would be renewed,  
and its resistance revive. * * When

ated the lessons taught by the ex  
  
amples of other nations; that  
emergencies of this sort will sometimes  
exist in all societies, however consti­  
tuted; that seditions and insurrections  
are, unhappily, maladies as inseparable  
from the body politic, as tumors and  
eruptions from the natural body; that  
the idea of governing at all times by  
the simple force of law, (which we have
