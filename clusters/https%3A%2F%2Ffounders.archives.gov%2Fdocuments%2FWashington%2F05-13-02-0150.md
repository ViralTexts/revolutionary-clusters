Sir,  
Philadelphia 14 July 1793  
  
For all the above Overseers.  
It being indispensably necessary that I should have some person at Mt Vernon through whom I can communicate my orders; who will see that these orders are executed; or, if not obeyed, who will inform me why they are not; who will receive the Weekly reports &amp; transmit them; receive money &amp; pay it; and in general to do those things which do not appertain to any individual Overseer. I have sent my Nephew mister Howell Lewis (who lives with me here) to attend to them until I can provide a manager of established reputation in these matters. You will therefore pay due regard to such directions as you may receive from him, considering them as coming immediately from myself. But that you also may have general knowledge of what I expect from you, I shall convey the following view (which I have of the business committed to your charge) as it appears to me, &amp; direct you to  
  
govern yourself by it: as I am persuaded nothing inconsistent therewith will be ordered by Mr Lewis, without authority from me to depart from it.  
1st. Altho’ it is almost needless to remark that the Corn ground at the Farm you overlook ought to be kept perfectly clean &amp; well ploughed—yet, because not only the goodness of that Crop depends upon such management; but also the wheat crop which is to succeed it, I cannot forbear urging the propriety &amp; necessity of the measure, in very strong terms.  
2d. The wheat is to be got into the barns—or into stacks, as soon as it can be done with any sort of convenience, that it may not (especially the bearded Wheat which is subject to injury by wet weather) sustain loss in shocks—&amp; because the shattered Grain in the fields may be beneficial to the stock; but no Hogs are to be put on stubble fields in which Grass seeds were sown last fall, Winter or spring; other stock, however, may be turned on them, as it is rooting that would be prejudicial.  
For Hyland Crow alone.  
3d. The whole swamp from the Road by Manley’s bridge up to the Lane leading to the New barn, is to be got in the best &amp; most complete order for sowing Grass seeds in August—or, at farthest by the middle of September. The lowest &amp; wettest part thereof is to be sown with Timothy seed alone. All the other parts of it are to be sown with Timothy &amp; Clover seeds mixed. The swamp on the other side of the aforesaid Lane (now in Corn &amp; oats) is to be kept in the best possible order, that the part not already sown with Grass-seeds, may receive them either this autumn (as soon as the Corn can be taken off with safety)—or in the Spring as circumstances shall dictate.  
For Hy McKay alone.  
No exertion, or pains are to be spared at Dogue-run to get the swamp from Manley’s bridge up to the meadow above; &amp; the two Inclosures in the Mill swamp, in the highest order for Grass, to be sown in the time &amp; manner above mentioned. But that no more may be attempted than can be executed well, proceed in the following order with them; accordingly as the weather may happen to be; for this must be consulted—as dry weather will answer to work in the low parts best, whilst the higher grounds may be worked at any time. 1st—begin with the swamp from Manley’s bridge upwards, &amp; get all that is not already in grass, well prepared for it, &amp; indeed sown. 2d. that part of the lower Meadow on the Mill run, which lies between the old bed of it, &amp; the race, &amp; within the fences—3d. After this is done, take that part in the Inclosure above (which was in Corn last year) lying between the Ditch &amp; fence of No. 1. up &amp; down to the cross fences. 4th. then go over the Ditch, &amp; prepare slipe after slipe as the Ditch runs, from one cross fence to the other, &amp; continue to do this as long as the season will be good, or the seed can be sown with propriety &amp; safety.  
For both Crow &amp; McKay.  
I conceive that the only way to get these grounds in good order, &amp; with expedition, is to give them one good ploughing &amp; then to tear them to peices with heavy harrows. Whether it be necessary to cut down &amp; take off the weeds previous to these workings can be decided better by experiments on the spot, than by reasoning on it at a distance. My desire is that the ground shall be made perfectly clean &amp; laid down smooth; without which Meadows will always be foul—much grass left in them, &amp; many Scythes broken in cutting what is taken off.  
McKay alone.  
4th. The Buck Wheat which has been sown for manure, ought to be ploughed in the moment a sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the ground a second time; otherwise, so far from it’s answering the purpose of manure, it will become an exhauster. For this reason, if the plows belonging to the Farm are unable to turn it in time, those of Muddy hole, Dogue run &amp; Union Farm must combine to do it. the work to be repaid by the Farm which receives the benefit, as soon as this work is accomplished thereat.  
For Crow &amp; McKay both.  
5th. Where Clover &amp; Timothy seeds are mixed &amp; sown together, allow five pints of the first &amp; three of the latter, to the acre; and where Timothy only is sown allow four quarts to the acre. Let the Seed be measured in the proportions here allotted &amp; put into an half bushel, &amp; the half bushel filled with sand or dry earth, &amp; extremely well mixed together in your own presence, or by yourself, which will answer two good purposes vizt 1st—to prevent theft, for seeds thus mixed would not sell—and 2dly. the seedsman being accustomed to sow a bushel of wheat to the acre would be at no loss to cast a bushel of this or anything else, regularly on that quantity of Ground.  
For all of them.  
6th. It is expected you will begin to sow wheat early in August, &amp; in ground perfectly clean &amp; well ploughed. I would have, &amp; do accordingly direct that not less than five pecks of seeds be sown on each acre. The plan of the Farm over which you look is given to Mr Lewis, from which the contents of each field may be known. And it is my express direction that every watch, &amp; the best attention may be given, to see that this quantity actually is put in; for I have strong suspicions (but this ought not to be hinted to them) that the seedsmen help themselves to a pretty large toll.  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing, &amp; even before if it can be done conveniently, you are to set heartily about threshing, or treading out the Wheat; and as fast as it is got out, to have it delivered at the Mill, or elsewhere according to directions. The longer this business is delayed the more waste &amp; embezzlement will there be of the Crop. The wheat is to be well cleaned; the chaff &amp; light wheat are to be properly taken care of for the Horses or other Stock; &amp; the straw stacked &amp; secured as it ought to be against weather &amp; other injuries; and until the whole be delivered, it will require your constant &amp; close attention.  
8th. The Oats at the farm you overlook are, I presume, all cut; in that case, let all the Scythes &amp; Cradles, &amp; Rakes which you have received be delivered over to the Mansion House; or, if you chuse to keep them against next Harvest, you must be responsible for them yourself.  
McKay alone.  
9th. The presumption also is, that the Flax is, ’ere this, pulled; let it be well secured, &amp; at a proper season stripped of it’s seed &amp; spread to rot. During this operation let it be often &amp; well examined, that it be not over done, or receive injury in any other respect by lying out too long  
For all.  
10th. Get the cleanest &amp; best wheat for seed, &amp; that which is freest from Onions. I would have about one third of my whole Crop sown with the common wheat; One third with the white; &amp; the other third with the yellow bearded wheat. The Overseers (with Davy, as he knows the state of his own farm &amp; the quality of  the wheat which grows upon it) may meet &amp; decide among themselves whether it would be best to have some of each of these sorts on every Farm; or, in order more effectually to prevent mixture, to have one sort only on a farm. In the latter case, the cutting of that which ripens first and so on, must be accomplished by the force of all the farms, instead of each doing its own work. If the seed on one farm was to be sown on another—especially if seed which grew on a light soil was to be sown on a stiff one; and that which grew on a stiff one sown on light ground, advantages would unquestionably result from it.  
Crow alone.  
11th—The Potatoes at the Mansion House must be worked by the ploughs from Union farm, &amp; when this is required it would be best, I conceive, to accomplish the work in a day.  
For all.  
12th—It is expected that the fences will be made secure, &amp; no damage permitted within them by creatures of any kind, or belonging to anybody—mine any more than others.  
13th. The greatest attention is to be paid to the stocks of all kinds on the farms; and the most that can, be made of their manure &amp; litter. They are to be counted regularly, that no false reports may be made; &amp; missing ones, if any, hunted for until found, or the manner of their going can be accounted for satisfactorily.  
14th. A Weekley Report, as usual, is to be handed to Mr Lewis. In this report, that I may know better how the work goes on, mention when you begin to plough, hoe, or otherwise work in a field, &amp; when that field is finished. The increase, decrease, &amp; changes are to be noted as heretofore—and let me ask.  
15th. Why are the Corn harrows thrown aside, or so little used, that I rarely of late ever see or hear of their being at work? I have been run to very considerable expence in providing these, &amp; other implements for my farms; &amp; to my great mortification &amp; injury find, generally speaking, that wherever they were last used, there they remain, if not stolen, ’till required again; by which means they, as well as the Carts, receive so much injury from the wet weather &amp; the heat of the sun, as to be unfit for use. To repair or supply the place of wch with new ones, my Carpenters (who ought to be otherwise employed) are continually occupied in these jobs. Harrows, after the ground is well broken, would certainly  weed, &amp; keep the Corn clean with more ease than ploughs. I hope therefore they will be used. And it is my express orders that the greatest care be taken of the Tools of every kind, Carts &amp; plantation implements in future for I can no longer submit to the losses I am continually sustainting by neglect.  
16th—There is nothing I more ardently desire; nor indeed is there anything more essential to my permanent interest, than raising of live fences on proper Ditches or banks: Yet nothing has ever been, in a general way, more shamefully neglected or mismanaged; for instead of preparing the ground properly for the reception of the Seed, &amp; weeding &amp; keeping the plants clean after they come up—the Seeds are hardly scratched into the ground, &amp; are suffered to be smothered by the weeds &amp; grass if they do come up; by which means the expence I have been at in purchasing &amp; sending the seeds (generally from Philada) together with the labour, such as it is, that has been incurred, is not only lost, but (&amp; which is of infinite more importance to me) season after season passes away, &amp; I as far from the accomplishment of my object as ever. I mention the matter thus fully to shew how anxious I am that all the seeds which have been sown or planted on the Banks of the Ditches, should be properly attended to; and the deficient spots, if any made good, if you have, or can obtain the means for doing it.  
17th. There is one thing I must caution you against (without knowing whether there be cause to charge you with it or not)—and that is, not to retain any of my Negroes who are able &amp; fit to work in the Crop, in or about your own house, for your own purposes. This I do not allow any Overseer to do. A small boy or girl for the purpose of fetching wood or water, tending a child or such like thi⟨n⟩gs, I do not object to; but so soon as they are able to work out, I expect to reap the benefit of their labour myself.  
18th. Tho’ last mentioned, it is not of the least importance; because the peace &amp; good government of the negroes depend upon it—&amp; not less so my interest &amp; your own reputation. I do therefore in explicit terms enjoin it upon you to remain constantly at home (unless called off by unavoidable business or to attend Divine Worship) &amp; to be constantly with your people when there. There is no other sure way of getting work well done, &amp; quietly by negroes; for when an Overlooker’s back is turned, the most of them will slight their work, or be idle altogether. In which  case correction cannot retrieve either; but often produces evils which are worse than the disease. Nor is there any other mode but this to prevent thieving &amp; other disorders, the consequence of opportunities. You will recollect that your time is paid for by me, &amp; if I am deprived of it, it is worse even than robbing my purse, because it is also a breach of trust; which every honest man ought to hold most sacred. You have found me, &amp; you will continue to find me faithful to my part of the agreement which was made with you, whilst you are attentive to your part; but it is to be remembered that a breach on one side releases the obligation on the other; if therefore it shall be proved to me that you are absenting yourself from either the Farm or the people witho⟨ut⟩ just cause, I shall hold myself no more bound to pay the wages, than you do to attend strictly to the charge which is entrusted to you, by one who has every disposition to be, Your friend &amp; servant

Gentlemen,?It being indispensably necessary  
that I should have some person at Mount Vernon  
through whom I can communicate my orders;? \
who will see that thise orders arc executed ; or, if  
not obeyed, who w.ll inform me why thry are  
not;?who Will receive the weekly reports and |  
transmit them ; receive money and pay it; and in &#x27;  
general to do those things which do not appertain ;  
? ?ntr individual overseer?I have sent iny ncph­  
  
w J .  
_w, Mr. Howell Lewis, (who lives with me here)  
to attend to them until I can provide a manager  
of established reputation in these matters. You  
will, therefore pay due regard to such directions as  
you may receive from him, considering them as  
coining immediately from myself. But that you  
also may have a general knowledge of what 1 expect  
from you, I slialj convey the following view  
(which I have of the bus.ness committed to your  
charge) as it appears to me, and direct you to  
govern yourseli by it: as I am persuaded nothing  
inconsistent therewith will be ordered by Mr. !  
.  
Lewis, without authority from rnc to depart from :  
jk |  
1st. Although it is almost needless to remark I  
that the com ground at the farm you overlook  
ought to bo kept perfectly clean and well ploughed  
?yet, because not only the goodness of that crop  
depends upon such managcnicut, but also the  
wheat crop which is to succeed it, I cannot forbear  
urging the propriety and necessity of the measure  
in very strong terms.  
ild. The wheat is to be got into the barns or &#x27;  
into stacks as soon as it can be done with any sort  
of convenience, that it may not (especially the j  
bearded wheat, which is subject to injury by wet  
weather,) sustain loss in shocks?and because the  
&quot; J ? *-?*&#x27;A* mm Kp hfMirfioiiil to  
  
iDuitcrcu grain m u^iuo muj  
the stock; but no hogs arc to be put on stubble  
fields in which grass seeds were sown last fall,  
winter or spring; other stock, however, may  
be turned on them, as it is rooting that would be  
prejudicial.  
3d. The whole 6wamp from the road from  
Manlcy&#x27;s bridge up to the lane leading to the new  
barn, is to be got -.nto the best and most complete  
order for sowing giseeds in August?or, at the  
farthest, by the middle of September. The lowest  
and wettest part thereof is to be sown with timothy  
seed alone. Ail the other parts of it are to be sown  
with timothy and clover seeds mixed. Tho  
swamp on the other side of the aforesaid lane (now  
in corn and outs) is to be kept in the best possible  
order, that the part not already sown with grass,  
seeds, may receive them cither this autumn (as  
soon as the corn can be taken off w.tli safety) or  
in the spring, as circumstances shall dictate.  
No exertion or pains arc to be spared at Dagucrun  
to get the swamp from Manley s bridge up  
to the meadow above, and the two enclosures in  
the mill swamp, in the highest order for grass, tc  
be sown in the time and manner above mentioned  
But that no more may be attempted than can b&lt;  
executed well, proceed in the following order with  
them accordingly as the weather may happen tc  
  
be, for this must be consulted, as dry wcathei  
will answer to work in the low parts best, while:  
JP the higher grounds may be worked at any time.  
1st. Begin with tho swamp from Manley*  
bridge upwa^ls, and get ull that is not already ii  
grass well prepared for it, and indeed sown. 2d  
That part of the lower meadow on tho mill rur  
which lies between the old bed of it and the ract  
and within the fences. 3d. After this is don&lt;  
take that part in the enclosure above (which wa  
in com last year) lying between tho ditch an  
fence of No. 1, up and down to cross fences. 4tl  
Then go over the ditch and prepare slipe aft&lt;  
slipc as the ditch runs from the one cross fence 1  
the other, and continue to do this as long as tl  
season will be goo 1, or the seed can be sown wil  
propriety and sifety.  
: ?U.? t&#x27;n. #?nl? ii-..,­  
  
X conceive *11 H4V w aij nuj W  
grounds in good order and w;th expedition, if  
jive tliem one &lt;**?! ploughing vid *hcn to tc  
  
j them to pieces with heavy harrows. Whether it j  
be necessary to cut down and take off the weeds  
previous to these workings can be decided better j  
by experiments on the spot than by reasoning on  
it at a distance. My desire is that the ground i  
shall be made perfectly clean, and laid down  
smooth; without which meadows will always be  
foul?much grass left in them, and many scythes j  
broken in cutting what is taken off.  
&lt;4th Tho. hurkwheat which has been sown for &#x27;  
  
manure ought to be ploughed in the moment a  
sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the ground a ! ]  
second time; otherwise, so far from its answering  
the purpose of manure, it will become an exhauster.  
For this reason, if the ploughs belonging to the 1  
farm are unable to turn it in time, those of Muddy 1  
hole, Dague run and Union farm, must combine &#x27;  
to do it, the work to be repaid by the farm which ; i  
receives the benefit, as soon as the work is accom- ! !  
plished thereat. &lt;  
5th. Where clover and timothy seeds are mix- &#x27;  
ed and sown together allow five pints of the first, &#x27;  
and three of the latter to the acre ; and where tim. &#x27;  
othy only is sown, allow four quarts to the acre. &#x27;&lt;  
Let the seed be measured in the proportions here i  
allotted and put into a half bushel, and the half  
bushel filled with sand or dry earth, and extremely 2  
well mixed together in your own presence or by t  
yourself, which will answer two good purposes, &#x27;  
viz: 1st, to prevent theft, for seeds thus mixed, j 1  
would not sell?and 2dly, the seedsman being ac- ! J  
customed to sow a bushel of wheat to the acre (  
would be at no loss to cast a bushel of this or 1  
anything else, regularly on that quantity of J  
ground. t  
Gth. It is expected you will begin to sow wheat &lt;  
early in August, and in ground perfectly clean and  
* l.J T I.I i ?i ,1 1  
  
?V6II piougnea. l wuuiu uuw, auu uu awtviuuig* i ly  
direct that not less than five pecks of seed be  
sown on each acre. The plan of the farm over  
which you look is given to Mr. Lewis, fiom which  
the contents of each field may bo known. And  
it is my express direction that every watch, and  
the best attention may be given, to sec that this  
quantity actually is put in ; for I have strong  
suspicions (but this ought not to be hinted to them)  
that the seedsmen hdp themselves to a pretty large  
toll.  
7th. As 6oon as you have done sowing, and  
even Ivfore, if it can be done conveniently, you  
are to let heartily about threshing or treading out  
the wheat; and as fast as it is got out, to have it  
delivered at the mill or elsewhere, according to directions.  
The longer this business is delayed, the  
more waste and embezzlement will there be or the  
crop. The wheat is to be well cleaned ; the chaff  
and light wheat are to be properly taken care of for  
the horses or other stock?and the straw stacked  
and secured as it ought to be against weather and  
other injuries; and until the whole be delivered it  
will require ycur constant and close attention.  
8th. The oats at the farm you overlook, arc, I  
presume, all cut; in tl. I case, let all the sycth&#x27;.s,  
and cradles, and rakes which you have received,  
be delivered over to the mansion house ; or if you  
choose to keep them against next harvest, you ;  
must be responsible for them yourself.  
9th. Ti.e presumption also is, that the flax is, :  
ere this, pulled; let it be well secured, and at a  
proper season stripped of its seed and spread to  
rot. During this operation let it be often turned  
and examined, that it be not overdone, or receive  
injury in any other respect by lying out too long.  
10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat for seed, j  
and that which is freest from onions. I would ,  
have about one third of my whole crop sown with j  
the common wheat; one third with the white ; j  
and the other third w ith the yellow bearded wheat.  
The overseers (with Davy, as he knows the state  
of his own farm and the quality of the wheat  
which grows upon it,) may meet and decide among  
themselves whether it would be be6t to have some &#x27;  
of each of these sorts on every farm ; or, in order  
more effectually to prevent mixture, to have one !  
| sort only on a farm. In the latter ease, the cutI  
ting of that which ripens first, and so on, must be  
accomplished by the force of all the farms, instead j  
of each doing its own work. If the seed on one  
farm was to be sown on another, especially if seed  
which grew on a light soil was to be sown on a  
stiff one; and that which grew on a stiff* one i  
! sown on light ground, advantages would unquce­  
  
tionubly result from it.  
11th. Thepotutcos at the mansion house must j  
be worked by the plough? from Union farm, and i  
when this i3 required, it would be best, I conceive, i  
i to accomplish the work in a day.  
12th. It is expected that the fences will be ;  
i made secure, and no damage permitted within :  
them by creatures of any kind or belonging to any  
body?mine any more than others.  
13th. The greatest attention is to be paid to  
the stocks of all kinds on the farms ; and the most 1  
that can be made of their manure and litter.?  
They are to be counted regularly, that no false  
reports may be made ; and missing ones, if any,  
: hunted for until found, or the manner of their go.  
i I ing can be accounted for satisfactorily,  
i j 14th. A weekly report, as usual, is to be handi  
\ cd to Mr. Lewis. In this report, that I may

i field, and when that field is finished. The in.  
&gt; crease, decrease and changes are to be noted as  
r heretofore?and let mc ask?  
t &#x27; 15th. Why arc the corn harrows thrown aside,  
or so little used that I rarely of late ever see or  
s hear of their being at work ? I have been run to  
i very considerable expense in providing these and  
1. j other implements for my farms ; and to my great  
i, mortification and injury, find, gen rally speaking,  
?, that wherever they were last used there they remain,  
if not 6tolrn, till required again ; by which  
is means they, as well the carts, receive so much ind  
jury from the wet weather and the heat of the sun

?r &#x27; of which with newom s, my carpenters (who ought  
:o to be otherw.se employed) arc continually occupied  
ie in these jobs. Harrows, after the ground is well  
:h broken, would certainly weed and keep the corr  
clean with more ease than ploughs. I ho;&gt;c, there  
se fore, they will be used. And it is my express or  
to der that the greatest care be taken cf tho tools o  
ar every kind, carts and plantation implements, in fu  
1  
  
turc?for I can no longer submit to tho losses I am ,  
continually sustaining by neglect. I  
16th. There is nothing I more ardently desire,  
nor indeed is there any more essential to my permanent  
interest, than of raising of live fences on  
proper ditches or banks; yet nothing has ever  
been, in a general way, more shamefully neglected  
or mismanaged; for instead of preparing the  
ground properly for the reception of the seed, and  
weeding and keeping the plants clean after they  
come up?the seeds are hardly scratched into the ^  
ground and arc suffered to be smothered by the  
weeds and grass if they do come up : by which  
means the expense I have been at in purchasing  
and sending the seeds (generally from Philadel.  
phia) together with the labor, such as it is. that  
has been incurred, is not only lost, but (and which  
s of infinite more importance to mc) season after  
?eason passes away and 1 am as far from the ac.  
:omplishment of my object as ever. I mention  
  
Ihe matter thus fully to show how anxious i am  
hat all these scedB which have been sown or plan.  
:ed on the banks of the ditches should be properly  
ittendcdto; and the deficient spots made good  
f you have or can obtain the means for doing it.  
17th. There is one thing I must caution you  
igainst (without knowing whether there be cause  
o charge you with it or not)?and that is not to ,  
etain any of my negroes who are able and fit to  
york in the crop, in or about your own house, for  
four own purposes. This I do not allow any  
ivcrsccr to do. A small boy or girl for the purkjsc  
of fetching wood or water, tending a child, or  
iuch like things, I do not object to; but so soon as  
hey are able to work out I expect to reap the ben.  
ifit of their labor myself.  
18th. Though last mentioned, it is not of the  
east importance, because the peace and good gov.  
.&#x27;rmncnt of the negroes depend upon it?and not  
ess so my interest and your own reputation. I do,  
hercfore, in explicit terms enjoin it upon you to  
einain constantly at home, (unless called off by  
m-ivoidabic business or to attend Divine worship)  
ind to be constantly with your people when there.  
There is no other sure way of getting work well  
lone and quietly by negroes; for when an overookcr&#x27;s  
back is turned the most of them will slight  
heir work, or be idle altogether. In which case  
jorrection cannot retrieve cither, but often produ.  
:es evils which are worse than the disease. Nor is  
here any other mode but this to prevent thieving  
ind other disorders, the consequence of opportu.  
litics. You will recollect that your time is paid  
  
or by me, and U 1 am aopnvea 01 11, 11. W WUI tt j  
:ven than robbing my purse, because it is also a  
jreachof trust, which every honest man ought to  
loM most s irred. You have found mc, and you  
ivill continue to find me faithrul to my part of the  
igrc-ement which was made with you, whilst you  
xrc attentive to your part; but it :s to be remembered,  
that a breach on one side releases the oblit  
ration on the other. If, therefore, it shall be pro- I  
red to ine that you are absenting yourself from  
:he farm or the people w fhout ust cause, I shall j  
acid myself no more bound to pay the wages than j  
pu do to attend strictly to the charge which is !

-iewv (which I have of the business com­

herewith will be ordered ly Mir. Lewtb,  
%itbout authority from mc to depart firom  
L  
lst. Although it is almost needless to rc­  
nark that the corn ground at the farm you  
verlooik ought to be kept perfectly clean  
ud well ploughed-yet. tsecause not oity  
he goodness of the crop depends upon  
uch management. but also the whient cropi  
vbich is to succeed it, I cannot forbear  
irging the .propriety and necesbity of the  
reasure it very strong terms.  
ed. The wheat 13 to be got into the barns  
ir into stacks as soon as it can he done  
rih any ort of convenience. thiet it may

tubble fields int whticht grass seeds were  
owvn last fall, wintter or sprng;: other stock,  
owever, may be turned oin them, as it is  
uoing that would be prejudicial.  
3d. The whole swamp from the rtiad  
rom Manley&#x27;s bridge up to the lane lead­  
ng to the new ban, is to be got into the  
est and most complete order for sowitng  
~rass seeds in A ugust-or. a t farthest, by  
lie middle of September. Tho lowest and  
wettest part thereof is to be sown witht  
imuotby beed alone. All the other parts  
&gt;f it are toibo sown with timothy atd  
,lover seeds&#x27;ixed. The swamp on the&#x27;  
thier side,&#x27;T the aforesaid lanec (now in  
orn and ont1s) is to be kept in the best pos-I  
ible order, that the part not already sown a  
with grass-s&#x27;ieds, may receive thetm either  
hiii auttumd,(as soon as the corn can be  
aken off&#x27; with safety) or in the spring, as  
ircumstad~s shall dictate.  
Nu exeion or pains arc to be spared at  
[)aguertun to get the swamp rwm Mlalcy&#x27;sj  
iridge up to the meadow above, and thel  
wo enclosuires int the mill swamp, in thel  
tighest order for grass, to be sown in the  
ime and manner above mentioned. But  
baa no more may 40 attempted thin cano  
e executed well, proceed in the following1  
arder with them accordingly as the wean­  
her may happen to be, for this mitst he  
:onsulted, as dry weather will answer to  
stork in the low parts best, whilst the  
sigher grounds may be workcd at any  
1st. Begin with the swamp from Mlan­  
cy&#x27;s bridge upwards, and get all that is  
sot already in grass well prepared for it,  
titd indeed sown. 2d. That part of the  
ower meadow ont the mill run, which lies  
setween the old bed of it and the race.I  
and within the fences. 3d. After this i  
lone, take that part in the enclosure above  
which was in corn last year) lying be­  
ween the ditch and fence of N~o. 1, upl  
and down so the cross fence. 4th. Then .  
go over tbe ditch and prepare slipe aft.r.  
dlino as theditch runs from the one cross  
  
fence to the other, and coninue to do thit  
as long as the season will be good, or the  
seed can be sown with propriety and safety.  
I conceive that the mnily way to get tluse  
grounds in good orier und with eI)pdi­  
tion, is to give them one good pliatghing  
and then to tear them to pieces with heavy  
harrows. Whother it be necessary to cut  
down and take off the weeds previous to  
these works can be decided better by expe­  
riments oil thb spot than by reasoning ot  
it At i distance. Mv desire is that the  
ground shall be made perfectly clean, and  
laid down smooth; without which inead­  
ows will always he foul-:nuch grass left  
in theta, andl iany scythes btokcn in cut­  
ting what is taken oi.  
4th. The buckwheat which has been  
sown for manure ought to be plonghed in  
the moment a sufficiency of seed is ripe to  
stock the grouud a s-Cond time ; other-wise.  
ro fur froru its answering the purpsose of  
inanure, it will become an exhauster. For  
this reason. if the ploughs belonging to the  
farm are unable to turs it in its ime. thosc  
of Muddy hole, Dague run and Union  
farm, must combine to do it, the wurik to  
be repaid by the farm which receives the  
benefit, as soon as the work is accomplisth­  
ed thereat.  
5th. When clover and imothy seeds  
are mixed and sown together allow live  
punts of the first, and three of the latter tw  
the acre; aud where aiimoahy nly i, slown.  
allow four cluari to she ascre. Let the  
seed be massured in the proportions here  
allotted and put imo a half bushel, ual  
;he half bushel filled with sand or dry  
earti, and extremely well amixed together  
in your own presence or hby yourself, which  
will answer two good purposes. viz: II.  
to prevent theta, for soeis thus mixed.  
would not sell-and 2lly, the sesdsman  
being accusermed to sow a bushel of &quot; heat  
tu the acre would be at no loss to cast a  
bushel of tbis or anything else, regularly  
on that quanity of ground.  
6th. It is expected yot will begin to  
bow wheat early in August, and in ground  
perfectly cleats and well ploughd. I  
would have, and do accordingly direct ttat  
not less thau tive peeks of seed be sown  
on each acre. The plan of the farm over  
which you look is given to Mr. Lewis,  
from which the couents of each field may  
be known. And it is smy express direction  
that every watcb, and the best attention  
may be given, to see that this quantity ac­  
tually is put in; for I have strong suspi­  
-eiini (but this ought not to be hated to  
them) that the seedsaen help themselvc,  
to a pretty large toll.  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing.  
and even befosre, if it can he done conven­  
iently, you are to set heartily about  
threshing or treading out the wheat ; and,  
as fast as it is got out, to have it delivered  
at the mill or elsewhere. accordinig te di­  
rections. The longe- this bu3itnesa is de­

I have been run to very considerable ex­

mets for my farms; and to my great mor­  
tilication anal injury, Gutiu, generally speak­

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Gentlemen.—lt being indispensably necessary  
that I should have some person at Mount Vernon  
through whom I can communicate my orders ;  
who will see that these orders are executed ; or,  
if not obeyed, who will inform me why they are  
not; who will receive the weekly reports and  
transmit them ; receive money and pay it; and  
in general to do those things which do not apper-  
tain to any individual overseer—I have sent my  
nephew, Mr. Howell Lewis, (who lives with me  
here,) to attend to them until I can provide a  
manager of established reputation in these matters.  
You will, therefore, pay due regard to such direc-  
tions as you may receive from him, considering  
them as coming immediately from myself. But  
that you also may have a general knowledge of  
what I expect {rom you, I shall convey the follow-  
ing view (which I have of the business commit-  
ted to your charge) as it appears to me, and direct  
you to govern yourself by it: as f am persuaded  
nothing inconsistent therewith will be ordered by  
Mr. Lewis, without authority from me to depart  
from it.  
  
Ist. Although it is almost needless to remark  
that the corn ground at the farm you overlook  
ought to be kept perfecily clean and well plough-  
ed—yet, because not only the goodness of that  
crop depends upon such management, but also  
the wheat crop which is to succeed it, I cannot  
forbear urging the propriety and necessity of the  
measure in very strong terms.  
  
2d. The wheat is to be got into the barns or  
into stacks as soon as it can be done with any sort  
of convenience, that it may not (especially the  
bearded wheat, which is subject to injury by wet  
weather,) sustain loss in shocks—and because  
the shattered grain in the fields may be beneficial  
to the stock ; but no hogs are to be put on stubble  
fields in which grass seed’ were sown last fall,  
winter or spring ; other stock, however, may be  
  
judicial.  
  
3d. The whole swamp, from the road from  
Manley’s bridge up to the lane leading to the  
new barn, is to be got into the best and most  
complete order for sowing grass seeds in August  
—or, at the farthest, by the middle of Septem.  
ber. The lowest and wettest part thereof ia to be  
sown with timothy seed alone. All the other  
parts of it are to be sown with timothy and clover  
seeds mixed. The swamp on the other side of  
the aforesaid lane (now in corn and oats) is to  
be kept in the best possible order, that the part  
not already sown with grass seeds, may receive  
them either this autumn (as soon as the corn can  
be taken off with safety) or in the spring, as cir-  
cumstances shall dictate.  
  
No exertion or pains are to be spared at Pague-  
run to get the swamp from Manley’s bridge up  
to the meadow above, and the two enclosures in  
the mill swamp, in the highest order for grass, to  
be sown in the time and manner above mention-  
ed. But that no more may be attempted than  
can be executed well, proceed in the following  
order with them, accordingly as the weather may  
happen to be, for this must be consulted, as dry  
weather will answer to work in the low parts  
best, whilst the higher grounds may be worked  
at any times.  
  
lst. Begin with the swamp from Manley’s  
bridge upwards, and get all that is not already in  
grass well prepared for it, and indeed sown. 24d.  
Phat part of the lower meadow on the mill run,  
which lies between the old bed of it and the race,  
and within the fences. 3d. Afier this is done,  
take that part in the enclosure above (which was  
in corn last year) lying between the ditch and  
lence of No. 1, up and down to cross fences. 4th.  
Then go over the ditch and prepare slipe after  
slipe as the ditch runs from the one cross fence to  
the other, and continue to do this as long as the  
season will be good, or the seed can be sown  
with propriety and safety.  
  
1 conceive that the only way to get these  
grounds in good order and with expedition, is to  
give them one good ploughing and then to tear  
them to pieces with heavy harrows. Whether it  
be necessary to cut down and take off the weeds  
previous to these workings can be decided better  
by experiments on the spot than by reasoning on  
it at a distance. My desire is that the ground  
shall be made perfectly clean, and laid down  
smooth ; without which meadows will always be  
foul—much grass lefi in them, and many ecythes  
broken in cutting what is taken off.  
  
4th. The buckwheat which has been sown for  
manure ought to be ploughed in the moment a  
sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the ground a  
second time; otherwise, so far from its answering  
the purpose of manure, it will become an exhaust-  
er. For this reason, if the ploughs belonging to  
the farm are unable to turn it in time, those of  
Muddy hole, Dague run and Union farm must  
combine to do il, the work to be repaid by the  
farm which receives the benefit, as soon as the  
work is accomplished thereat.  
  
5th. Where clover and timothy seeds are mix-  
ed and sown together, allow five pints of the first,  
and three of the latter to the acre; and where  
timothy only is sown, allow four quarts to the  
acre. Let the seed be measured in the proportions

quantity actually is put in; for f have strong heretolore—and let me ask  
suspicions (but this ought not to be hinted to them)  
that the seedsmen help themselves to a pretty  
large toll.  
  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing, and  
even before, if itcan be done conveniently, you  
are to set heartily about thrashing or treading out  
the wheat ; and as fast as itis got-out, to have it  
delivered at the mill or elsewhere, according to di-  
rections. The longer this business is delayed, the  
more waste and embezzlement will there be ot the  
crop. The wheat is to be well cleaned ; the chaff  
and light wheat are to be properly taken care of for  
the horses or other stock—and the straw stacked  
and secured as it ought to be against weather and  
other injuries ; and until the whole be delivered it  
will require your constant and close attention.  
  
8th. The oats at the farm you overlook are, I  
presume; all cut ; in that case, let all the scythes,  
and cradles, and rakes which you have received,  
be delivered over to the mansion house ; or if you  
choose to keep them ayainst next harvest, you  
must be responsible for them yourself.  
  
9th. The presumption also is, that the flax is,  
ere this, pulled ; let it be well secured, and at a  
proper season stripped of its seed and spread to  
rot. During this operation let it be often turned  
and examined, that it be not overdone, or receive  
injury in any other respect by lying out too long.  
  
10ih. Get the cleanest and best wheat for seed,  
and that which is freest from onions. I would  
have about one third of my whole crop sown with  
the common wheat; one third with the white ;  
and the other third with the yellow bearded wheat.  
The overseers (with Davy, as he knows the state  
of his own farm and the quality of the wheat  
which grows upon it, ) may meet and decide among  
themselves whether it would be best to have some  
of each of these sorts on every farm ; or, in order  
more effectually to prevent mixture, to have one  
sort only on a farm. In the latter case, the cut-  
ting of that which ripens first, and so on, must be  
accomplished by the force of all the farms, instead  
ofeach doing its own work. If the seed on one  
farm was to be sown on another, especially if&#x27;seed  
which grew on alight soil was to be sown ona  
stiff one ; and that which grew on a atifl one  
sown on light ground, advantages would unques-  
tionably result from it.

15h. Why are the corn harrows thrown aside,  
  
or so little used that I rarely of late ever see or  
hear of their being at work? I have been run to  
very considerable expense in providing these and  
other implements for my farms: and to my great  
mortification and injury, find, generally speaking,  
that wherever they were last used there they re-  
main, i! not stolen, till required again ; by which  
means they, as well as the carts, receive so much  
injury from the wet weather and the heat of the sun  
as to be unfit for use ; to repair or supply the place  
of which with new ones, my carpenters (who ought  
to be otherwise employed) are continually occupied  
  
in these jobs. Harrows, afier the ground is well  
  
broken, would certainly weed and keep the corn  
cle in with more ease than ploughs. 1 hope, there-  
fore, they will be used. And it is my express or-  
der that the greatest care be taken of the tools of  
every kind, carts and plantation implements, in fu-  
  
ture—lor | can no longer submit to the losses I  
am continually sustaining by neglect.  
  
16th. There is nothing I more ardently desire,  
nor indeed is there any more essential to my per-  
manent interest, than of raising of live fences on  
proper ditches or banks; yet nothing has ever  
been, ina general way, more shamelully neglected  
or mismanaged ; for, instead of preparing the  
ground properly for the reception o! the seed, and  
weeding and keeping the plants clean after they  
come up—the seeds are hardly scratched. into the  
ground, and are suflered to be smothered by the  
weeds and grass if they do come up: by which  
means the expense I have been at in purchasing  
and sending the seeds (generally from Philadel-  
phia) together with the labor, such as it is, that  
has been incurred, is not only lost, but (and which

pose of fetching wood or water, tending a child, or  
such like things, I do not object to ; but so soon as  
they are able to work ou: I expect to reap the be-  
nefit of their labor mysell.  
  
18ih. Though last mentioned, it is not of the  
least importance, because the peace and good go-  
vernment of the negroes depend upon it—and not  
less so my interest and your own reputation. [ do,  
therefore, in explicit terms, enjoin it upon you to  
remain constantly at home, (unless called off by  
unavoidable business or to attend Divine worship, )  
and to be constantly with your people when there.  
There is no other sure way of getting work well  
done and quietly by negroes ; for when an over-  
looker’s back is turned the most of them will slight  
their work, or be idle altogether. In which case  
correction cannot retrieve either, but ofien pro-  
duces evils which are worse than the disease. Nor  
is there any other mode but this to prevent thieving  
and other disorders, the consequence of opportu-  
nities. You will recollect that your time is paid  
for by me, and if £ am deprived of it, it is worse  
even than robbing my purse, because it is also a  
breach of trust, which every honest man ought to  
hold most sacred. You have found me, and you  
will continue to find me, faithful to my part of the  
agreement which was made with you, whilst you  
are attentive to your part ; but it is to be remem-  
bered, that a breach on one side releases the obli-  
gation on the other. If, therefore, it shall be  
proved to me that you are absenting yourself from  
the farm or the people without just cause, { shall  
hold myselfno more bound to pay the wages than  
you do to attend strictly to the charge which is  
entrusted to you by one who has every disposi-  
tion to be your friend and servant,

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Gentlemen :—It being indispensably necessary that. I  
should have some person at Mount Vernon through whom  
I can communicate my orders ;—who will see that these  
orders are executed ; or, if not obeyed, who will inform  
me why they are not;—who will receive the weekly re-  
ports and transmit them ;—receive money and pay it;  
and in general to do those things which do not appertain  
to any individual overseer—I have sent my nephew, Mr.  
Howell Lewis, (who lives with me here) to attend to  
them until I can provide a manager of established repu-  
tation in these matters. You will, therefore pay due re-  
gard to such directions you may receive from him, con-  
sidering them as coming immediately from myself. But  
that you also may have a general knowledge of what I  
expect from you, I shall convey the following view  
(which | have of the business committed to your charge)  
as it appears to me, and direct you to govern yourself by  
it; as J am persuaded nothing inconsistent therewith will  
be ordered by Mr. Lewis, without authority from me to  
depart from it. .  
  
Ist. Although it is almost needless to remark that the  
corn ground at the farm you overlook ought to be kept  
perfectly clean and well ploughed—yet, because not only  
the goodness of that crop depends upon such manage-  
ment, but also the wheat crop which is to succeed it, I  
cannot forbear urging the propriety and necessity of the  
measure in very strong terms. :  
  
2d. The wheat is to be got into the barns or into the  
stacks as soon as it can be done with any sort of conve-  
nience, that it may not (especially the bearded wheat,  
which is subjected to injury by wet weather,) sustain loss  
in shocks—and because the shattered grain in the fields is  
beneficial to the stock ; but no hogs are to be put on  
stubble fields in which grass seeds were sown last fall,  
winter or spring; other stock, however, may be turned  
on them, as it is rooting that would be prejudicial.  
  
3d. The whole swamp from the road from Manley’s  
bridge up to the lane leading to the new barn, ia to be got  
into the best and most complete order for sowing grass

seeds in August—or, at furthest by the middle of Septem-  
ber:. The lowest and wettest part thereof is to be sown  
with timothy seed alone. All the other parts of it are to  
be sown with timothy and clover seeds mixed. T he  
swamp on the other side of the aforesaid lane (now in  
corn and oats) is to be keptin the best possible order,  
that the part not already sown with grass seeds, may re-  
ceive them either this autumn (as soon as the corn can  
be taken off with safety) or in the spring, as circuim-  
stances shall clictate.  
  
No exertion or pains are to be spared at Dagueran to  
  
et the swamp from Manley’s bridge up to the meadow  
above, and the two enclosed in the mill swamp, in the  
highest order for grass, to be sown in the time and man-  
ner above mentioned. But that no moze may be attempt-  
ed than cau be executed well; proceed in the following  
order with them accordingly as the weather may happen  
to be, for this must be consulted, as dry weather will  
answer to work in the low parts best, while the higher  
grounds may be worked at any time. :  
  
Ist. Begin with the swamp from Manley’s bridge up-  
wards, and get all thatis not already in grass well pre-  
pared for it, and indeed sown. 2d. That part of the  
lower meadow on the mill run, which lies between the  
old bed of it and the race, and within the fences. 3d.  
After this is done, take that part in the enclosure above  
(which was in corn last year) lying between the ditch  
and fence of No. 1, up and down to the cross fences. Ath.  
Then go over the ditch and prepare slipe after slipe as  
the ditch runs from the one cross fence to the other, and  
continue to do this as long as the season will be good,  
or the seed can be sewn with propriety and safety.  
  
I conceive that the only way to get these grounds in  
  
ood order and with expedition, is to give them one good  
ploughing and then to tear them in pieces with heavy  
harrows. Whether it be necessary to cut down and ti#ie  
off the weeds previous to these workings can be decided  
better by experiments on the spot than by reasoning on  
it at a distance. My desire is that the ground shall be  
made perfectly clean, and laid down sinooth; without  
which meadows will always be foul—much grass left in  
them and many scythes broken in cutting what is taken  
off.  
  
4th. The buckwheat which has been sown for manure  
ought to be ploughed in the moment a sufficiency of seed  
is ripe to stock the ground a second time; otherwise, so  
fat from its answering the purpose of manure, it will be-  
come an exhauster. For this reason, if the ploughs be-  
longing to the farm are unable to turn it in in time, those  
of Muddy hole, Daguerun and Union farm must combine  
to-do it, the work to be repaid by the farm which receives  
the benefit, as soon as the work is accomplished thereat.  
  
5th. Where clover and timothy seed are mixed and  
sown together, allow five pints of the first and three. of  
the latter to the acre; and where timothy only is sown,  
allow four quarts to theacre. Let the seed be measured  
in the proportions here allotted and put into a half bushel,  
and the half bushel filled with sand or dry earth, and ex-  
tremely well mixed together in your own presence or by  
yourself, which will answer two good purposes, viz : Ist,  
to prevent theft, for seed thus mixed, would not sell—and  
2d, the seedsman being accustomed to sowing a bushel  
of wheat to the acre would be at no loss to cast a bushel  
of this or any thing else, regularly om that quantity of  
ground.  
  
6th. It is expected you will begin to sow wheat early  
in August, and in ground perfectly clean and well plough-  
ed.. | would have, and do accordingly direct that not  
less than five pecks of seed be sown on each acre. The  
plan of the farm over which you look is given to Mr.  
Lewis, from which the contents of each field may be  
known. And it is my express direction that every watch,  
and the best attention may be given to see that this quan-  
tity actually is put in; for Ihave strong suspicions (but  
this ought not to be hinted to them) that the seedsmen  
help themselves to a pretty large toil. :  
  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing, and even be-  
  
fore, if it can be done conveniently, you are to set hearti-  
Jy about threshing or treading out the wheat; and as fast  
as it is got out, to have it delivered at the mill or else-  
where, according to directions.. The longer this business  
is delayed, the more waste and embezzlement will there  
be of the crop. The wheat is to be well cleaned; the  
chaff and light wheat are to be properly taken care of for  
the horses or other stock—and the straw stacked arid  
secured as it ought to be against weather and other inju-  
ries ; and until the whole be delivered it will require your  
constant and close attention.  
  
Sth. The oats at the farm you overlook, are fT presume,  
all cut; in chat case, let all the seythes, and cradles and  
rakes which you have received be delivered over to the  
mansion house; or if-you choose to keep them against  
next harvest, you.must be responsible for them yourself.  
  
9th. ‘The presumption also is, that the flax is ere this  
pulled; let it be well secured, and at a proper season  
stripped of its seed and spread to rot. During this epe-  
ration let it be often examined, that it be not overdone,  
or receive injury. in any other respect by lying. out too  
long.  
  
10th. Get the cleanestand best wheat for seed, and that  
which is freest from onions. 1 would have about one-  
third of my whole crop sown with the common wheat;  
one-third with the white ; and the other third with the vel-  
low bearded wheat. ‘The overseers (with Davy, as he  
knows the state of his own farm and the quality of the  
wheat which grows upon it) may meet and decide among  
themselves whether it would be best to have some of-each  
of these sorts on every farm; or in order more effectually  
to prevent mixture, to have one sort only ona farm. In  
the latter case, the cutting of that which ripens first, and  
so on, must be accomplished by the force of all the farms,  
instead of each doing its own work. Jf the seed on one  
farm was to be sown on another, especially if seed which  
grew on a light soil was to be sown ona stiff one; and  
that which grew ona stiff one sown on light ground, ad-  
vantages would unquestionably result from it.  
  
11th. The potatoes at the mansion house must be work-  
ed by the ploughs from Union farm, and when this is re-  
quired, it would be best, 1] conceive, to accomplish the  
work ina day.  
  
12th. ltis expected that the fences will be made secure,  
and no danger permitted within them by creatures of any  
kind or belonging to any body—mine any more than  
others.  
  
13th. The greatest attention is to be paid to the stocks  
of all kinds on the farms; and the most that can be made  
of their manure and litter. They are to be counted regu-  
larly, that no false reports may be made; and missing ones,  
ifany, hunted for until found, or the manner of their go-  
ing can be accounted for satisfactorily.  
  
14. A weekly report, as usual, is to be handed to Mr.  
Lewis. In this report, that | may know better how the  
work goes on, mention when you begin to plough, hoe,  
or otherwise work in the field, and when the field is  
finished. ‘The increase, decrease and changes are to be  
noticed as heretofore—and Jet me ask—  
  
15th. Why are the corn harrows thrown aside, or so  
little used that I rarely of late ever see or hear of their be-  
ing atwork? I have been run to very considerable ex-  
pense in providing these and other implements for my  
farm; and to my great mortification and injury, tind, gener-  
ally speaking, that wherever they were last usec there  
they remain, if not stolen, till required again; by which  
means they, as well as the carts, receive so much injury  
from the wet weather and the heat of the sun as to be un-  
fit for use: to repair or supply the place of which with  
new ones, my carpenters (who ought to be otherwise em-  
ployed) are continually occupied by these jobs. Har-  
rows, after the ground is well broken, would certainly  
weed and keep the corn clean with more ease than  
ploughs. I hope, therefore, they will be used. And itis  
my express order that the greatest care be taken of the  
tools of every kind, carts and plantation implements, in  
future—for | can no longer submit to the losses] am con-  
tinually sustaining by neglect.  
  
16th. There is nothing | more ardently desire, nor in-  
deed is there any more essential to my permanent interest,  
than raising of live fences or proper ditches or banks ; yet  
nothing has ever been, in a general way, more shamelully  
neglected or mismanaged ; for instead of preparing the  
ground properly for the reception of the seed, and weed-  
ing and keeping the plants clean after they come up—the  
seeds are hardly scratched into the ground and are suffer-  
ed to be smothered by the weeds and grass if thev do come  
up: by which means the expense | have been at in pur-  
chasing and sending the seeds (generally from Phil-  
adelphia) together with the labor, such as it is, that  
when incurred, is not only lost, but (and which is of infi-  
nite more importance to me) season after season passes  
  
away and J amas far from the accomplishment of my ob- |.  
  
jectas ever. I mention the matter thus fully to show how  
anxions Tam. all these seeds which have been sown or  
planted on the banks of the ditches should be properly  
  
  
  
attended tp; and the deficjgnt spots made good if you have  
orcan obtain the means of doing it.  
  
17th. There is one thing [ must’ caution you against  
(without knowing whether there be cause to charge you  
with it or not)—and that is not to retain ‘any of my  
negroes who are able and fit to work in the crop, in or  
about your own house, for your own purposes,—  
This Ido not allow any overseer to do, A small  
boy or girl for the purpose of fetching wood or  
water, tending a child, or such like things,-[ do not object  
to; but so soon as they are able to work out 1 expect to  
reap the benefit of their labor myself. ee  
18th. Though last mentioned, it is not of the least im-  
portance, because the peace and good government of the  
negroes depend upon it—and not less to my interest and  
your own reputation. Ido therefore, in explicit terms  
enjoin it upon you to remaimnconstantly at home, (unless  
called off by unavoidable business or to attend Divine  
worship) and to be constantly sith your people when  
there. There is no other sure way of getting work well  
done and quietly by negroes; for. when an overlooker’s.  
back is tirned the most of them will slight their work, or  
be idle altogether. In which case correction cannot re-  
trieve either, but often produces evils which are worse  
than the disease. Nor is there any other mode but this  
to prevent thieving and other disorders, the consequence  
of opportunities. You will recollect that your time is  
paid for by me, and if I am deprived of jit, it is worse  
even than robbing my purse, because it is also a breach  
of trust, which every honest man ought to hold most  
sacred. You have found me, and you will continue to  
tind me faithful to my part of the agreement which was  
made with you, whilst you are attentive to your part; but it  
is to be remembered, thata breach on one side releases the  
obligation on the other. If, therefore, it shall be proved  
to me that you are absenting yourself from either the farm  
or the people without just cause, J shall hold myself no  
more bound to pay the wages than you do to attend  
strictly to the charge which is entrusted to you by one  
who has every disposition to be  
Your friend and servant,

goodness of that crop depends upon such  
  
management, but also the wheat crop which  
is to succeed it, I cannot forbear urging the  
propriety and necessity of the measure in  
very strong terms.  
2d. The wheat is to be got into the barns  
or into stacks as soon as it can be done with  
any sort of convenience, that it may not (es­  
pecially the bearded wheat, which is subject  
to injury by wet weather,) sustain loss in  
shocks; and because the shattered grain in  
the fields may be beneficial to the stock.  
But no hogs are to be put on stubble fields in  
which grass seeds were sown last fall, win-  
ter, or spring; other stock, however, may be  
turned on them, as it is rooting that would be  
prejudicial.  
3d. The whole swamp from the road  
from Manley&#x27;s bridge up to the lane leading  
to the new barn, is to be got into the best and  
most complete order for sowing grass seeds  
in August---or, at fartherest, by the middle  
of September. The lowest and wetest part  
therefore is to be sown with timothy seed a  
lone. All the other parts of it are to be sown  
with timothy and clover seeds mixed. The  
swamp on the other side of the aforesaid lane,  
now in corn and oats,) is to be kept in the  
best possible order, that the part not already  
sown with grass seeds, may receive them ef  
ther this autumn (as soon as the corn can be  
taken off with safety, or in the spring, as  
circumstances shall dictate.  
No exertion or pains are to be spared at  
Daguerun to get the swamp from Manley&#x27;s  
bridge up to the meadow above, and the two  
enclosures in the mill swamp, in the highest  
order for grass, to be sown in the time and  
manner above mentioned. But that no more  
may be attempted than can be executed well,  
proceed in the following order with them  
accordingly as the weather may happen to  
be, for this must be consulted, as dry weath­  
er will answer to work in the low parts best,  
whilst the higher grounds may be worked at  
any time.  
1st. Begin with the swamp from Manley&#x27;s  
bridge upwards, and get all that is not already  
in grass well prepared for it, and indeed sown.  
2d. That part of the lower meadow on the  
mill run, which lies between the old bed of  
it and the race, and within the fences. 3d.  
After this is done, take that part in the enclo  
sure above (which was in corn last year,)  
lying between the ditch and fence of No. 4,  
up and down to the cross fences. 4th. Then  
go over the ditch and prepare slipe after slipe,  
as the ditch runs from the one cross fence  
to the other, and continue to do this as long  
as the season will be good, or the seed can  
be sown with propriety and safety.  
I conceive that the only way to get these  
grounds in good order and expedition is, to  
give them one good plowing and then to tear  
them to pieces with heavy harrows. Wheth­  
er it be necessary to cut down and take off  
the weeds previous to these workings, can be  
decided better by experiments on the spot  
than by reasoning on it at a distance. M  
desire is that the ground shall be made per-  
fectly clean, and laid down smooth; without  
which meadows will always be foul--much  
grass left in them, and many scythes broken  
in cutting what is taken off.  
4th. The buckwheat which has been sown  
for manure, ought to be plowed in the mo  
ment a sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the  
ground a second time; otherwise, so far from  
its answering the purpose of manure, it will  
become an exhauster. For this reason, if  
the plows belonging to the farm are unable  
to turn it in in time, those of Muddy hole,  
Dague-run, and Union farm, must combine  
to do it, the work to be repaid by the farm  
which receives the benefit, as soon as the  
work is accomplished thereat.  
5th. Where clover and timothy seeds are  
mixed and sown toge ther, allow five pints;  
of the first and three of the latter to the acre  
and where timothy only is sown, allow four  
quarts to the acre. Let the seed be meas  
ured in the proportions here allotted, and put  
into a half bushel, and the half bushel filled  
with sand or dry earth, and extremely well  
mixed together in your own presence or by  
yourself, which will answer two purposes,  
viz: 1st to prevent theft, for seeds thus mix  
ed would not sell; and 2dly, the seedsman  
being accustomed to sow a bushel of wheat  
to the acre, would be at no loss to cast a  
bushel of this or any thing else, regularly on  
that quantity of ground.  
6th. It is expected that you will begin to  
sow wheat early in August, and in ground  
perfectly clean and well plowed. I would  
have, and do accordingly direct, that not less  
than five pecks of seed be sown on each  
acre. The plan of the farm over whch you  
look is given to Mr. Lewis, from which the  
contents of each field may be known. And  
it is my express directions that every watch,  
and the best attention may be given to see  
that this quantity actually is put in; for I  
have strong suspicions (but this ought not to  
be hinted to them,) that the seedsmen help  
themselves to a pretty large toll.  
th. As soon as you have done sowing,  
and even before, if it can be done convenient  
ly, you are to set heartily about threshing or  
treading out the wheat; and as fast as it is  
got out, to have it delivered at the mill or  
elsewhere, according to directions. The  
longer this business is delayed, the more  
waste and embezzlement will there be of  
the crop. The wheat is to be well cleansed;  
the chaff and light wheat are to be properly  
taken care of for the horses or other stock;  
and the straw stacked and secured as it ought  
to be against weather and other injuries;  
and until the whole be delivered, it will re­  
quire your constant and close attention.  
8th. The oats at the farm you overlook,  
are, I presume, all cut; in that case, let all  
the scythes, and cradles, and rakes which you  
have received, be delivered over to the man­  
sion house; or if you choose to keep them  
against next harvest, you must be responsi  
ble for them yourself.  
9th. The presumption also is, that the flax  
is, ere this, pulled; let it be well secured,  
and at a proper season stripped of its seed  
and spread to rot. During this operation  
let it be often examined, that it be not over­  
done, or receive injury in any other respect  
by lying out to long.  
10th. Get the cleanost and best wheat for  
seed, and that which is freest from onions.  
I would have about one third of my whole  
  
third with the white; and the other third  
  
with the yellow bearded wheat. The over  
seers (with Davy, as he knows the state of  
his own farm and the quality of the wheat  
which grows upon it,) may meet and decide  
among themselves whether it would be best  
to have some of each of these sorts on every  
farm; or, in order more effectually to pre­  
vent mixture, to have one sort only on a farm.  
In the latter case, the cutting of that which  
ripens first, and so on, must be accomplished  
by the force of all the farms, instead of each  
doing its own work. If the seed on one  
farm was to be sown on another, especially  
if the seed which grew on a light soil was to  
be sown on a stiff one; and that which grew  
on a stiff one, sown onlight ground, advanta­  
ges would unquestionable result from it.  
IIth. The potatoes at the mansion house  
must be worked by the plows from Union  
farm, and when this is required, it would be  
best, I conceive, to accomplish the work in  
a day.  
12th. It is expected that the fences will be  
made secure, and no damage permitted with­  
in them by creatures of any kind or belong­  
ing to any body,-mine any more than oth­  
19th. The greatest attention is to be paid to  
the stocks of all kinds on the farms; and the  
most that can be made of their manure and  
litter. They are to be counted regularly,  
that no false report may be made; and miss  
ing ones, if any, hunted for until found, or the  
manner of their going can be accounted for  
satisfactorily.  
14th. A weekly report, as usual, is to be  
handed to Mr. Lewis. In this report, that I  
may know better how the work goes on, men­  
tion when you begin to plow, hoe, or other­  
wise work in a field, and when that field is  
finished. Then increase, decrease and chan­  
ges are to be noted as heretofore,-and let  
me ask  
15th. Why are the corn harrows thrown  
aside or so little used that I rarely of late  
ever see or hear of their being at work?  
I have been run to very considerable ex­  
pense in providing these and other imple­  
ments for my farms; and to my great mor­  
tification and injury, find, generally speak  
ing, that wherever they were last used, there  
they remain, if not stolen, till required again;  
by which means they, as well as the carts,  
receive so much injury from the wet weath­  
er and the heat of the sun as to be unfit for  
use; to repair or supply the place of which  
with new ones, my carpenters (who ought to  
be otherwise employed,) are continually oc­  
cupied in these jobs. Harrows, after the  
ground is well broken, would certainly weed  
and keep the corn clean with more ease  
than plows. I hope, therefore, they will be  
used. And it is my express order that the  
greatest care be taken of the tools of every  
kind, carts and plantation implements, in  
future--for I can no longer submit to the  
losses I am continually sustaining by neglect.  
16th. There is nothing I more ardently  
desire, nor indeed is there any thing more  
essential to my permanent interests, than  
raising of live fences on proper ditches or  
banks; yet nothing has ever been in a gen­  
eral way, more shamefully neglected or mis  
managed; for instead of preparing the ground  
properly for the reception of the seed, and  
weeding and keeping the plants clean after  
they come up--the seeds are hardly scratch­  
ed into the ground, and are suffered to be  
smothered by the weeds and grass if they do  
come up; by which means the expense I have  
been at in purchasing and sending the seeds  
(generally from Philadelphia,) together with  
the labor, such as it is, that has been incurr­  
ed, is not only lost, but (and which is of infi­  
nite more importance to me) season after  
season passes away and I am as far from the  
accomplishment of my object as ever. I  
mention the matter thus fully to show how  
anxious I am that all these seeds which have  
been sown or planted on the banks of the  
ditches should be properly attended to; and  
the deficient spots made good if you have or  
can obtain the means for doing it.  
17th. There is one thing I must caution  
you against (without knowing whether there  
be cause to charge you with it or not)- and  
that is, not to retain any of my negroes who  
are able and fit to work in the crop, in or a­  
bout your own house, for your own purposes.  
This I do not allow any overseer to do. A  
small boy or girl for the purpose of fetching  
wood and water, tending a child, or such like  
things, I do not object to; but so soon as they  
are able to work out I expect to reap the  
benefit of their labor myself.  
18th. Though last mentioned, it is not of  
the least importance, because the peace and  
good government of the negroes depend up­  
on it,-and not less so my interest and your  
own reputation. I do, therefore, in explicit  
terms enjoin it upon you to remain constantly  
at home, (unless called off by unavoidable  
business or to attend Divine worship) and be  
constantly with your people when there.  
There is no sure way of getting work well  
done and quietly by negroes; for when an  
overlooker&#x27;s back is turned the most of them  
will slight their work, or be idle altogether.  
In which case correction cannot retrieve ei­  
ther but often produces evils which are worse  
than the disease. Nor is there any other  
mode but this to prevent thieving and other  
disorders, the consequence of opportunities.  
You will recollect that your time is paid for  
by ne, and if I am deprived of it, it is worse  
even than robbing my purse, because it is also  
a breach of trust, which every honest man  
ought to hold most sacred. You have found  
me, and you will continue to find me faith­  
ful to my part of the agreement which was  
made with you, while you are attentive to  
your part; but it is to be remembered, that a  
breach on one side releases the obligation on  
the other. If, therefore, it shall be proved  
to me that you are absenting yourself from  
either the farm or the people without just  
cause, I shall hold myself no more hound to  
pay the wages than you do to attend strictly  
to the charge which is entrusted to you by  
one who has every disposition to be.  
Your friend and servant,

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Gentlemen:—It being indispensably necessary  
that I should have some person at Mount Vernon,  
through whom I can communicate my orders ;  
who will see that these orders are executed ; or  
if not obeyed, who will inform me why they are  
not; who will receive the weekly reports and  
transmit them ; receive money and pay it; and  
in general to do these things which donotapper­  
tain to any individual overseer—l have sent my  
nephew, Mr. Howell Lewis, (who lives with me  
here) to attend to them until 1 can provide a  
manager of established reputation in these mat­  
ters. You will therefore pay due regard to such  
directions as you may receive from him, consid­  
ering them as coming immediately from myself.  
But that you also may have a general knowledge  
of what I expect from you, I shall convey the  
following view (which I have of the business  
committed to your charge) as it appears to me,  
and direct you to govern yourself by it; as I am  
persuaded nothing inconsistent therewith will be  
ordered by Mr. Lewis, without authority from me  
to depart from it,  
1st. Although it is almost needless to remark  
that the corn ground at the farm you overlook  
ought to be kept perfectly clean and well plough­  
ed—yefc because not only the goodness of that  
crop depends upon such management, but also  
the wheat crop, which is to succeed it, I cannot  
forbear urging the propriety and necessity of the  
measure in very strong terms.  
3d, The wheat is to be got into the barns or  
iuto stacks as soon as it can be done with any  
sort of convenience, that it may not (especially  
the bearded wheat, which is subject to injury  
by wet weather,) sustain h ss in shocks ; and  
because the shattered grain in fields may be ben­  
eficial to the stock ; but no hogs are to be put on  
stubble fields in which grass seeds were sown last  
fall, winter, or spring ; other stock, however,  
may be turned on them, as it is rooting that would  
be prejudicial.  
». The whole swamp from the road from  
Manley’s bridge, up to the lane leading to the  
new ham, is to be got into the best and most  
complete order for sowing grass seeds in Au­  
gust—or, at the furthest, by the middle of Sep­  
tember. The lowest and wettest part thereof, is  
to be sown with timothy seed alone. All the  
other parts of it are to be sown with timothy and  
clover mixed. The swamp on the other side of  
the aforesaid lane (nmv in corn and oats) is tobe  
kept in the best possible order, (hat the part not  
already sown with grass seeds may receive them  
either this autumn (as soon as the corn can Ire  
taken off with safety) or in the spring, ascircnm­  
stances shall dictate. , *  
  
No exertions or pains are tobesparedatDague  
run lo get the swamp from Manley’s bridge up  
to the meadow above, and&#x27; the two enclosures in  
the mill swamp, in the highest order for grass, to  
be sown in the time and manner above mentioned.  
But that no more may be attempted than can be  
executed well, proceed in the following order  
with them accordingly as the weather may hap­  
pen to be, for this must be consulted, as dry  
weather will answer to work in the low parts  
best, whilst the higher grounds may be worked  
at any time.  
1st. Begin with the swamp from Manley’s  
bridge upwards, and get all that is not already  
in grass, well prepared for it, and indeed sown.  
2d. That part of the low meadow on the mill  
run, which lies between the old lied of it and the  
race, and within the fences. 2d. After this is  
done,, take that part of enclosure above (which  
was in corn last year,) lying between the ditch  
and fence No. 1, up and down to cross fences.  
4th. Then go over the ditch and prepare slipe  
after slipe as the ditch runs from the one cross  
fence to the other, and continue to do this as long  
as the season will be good, or the seed can be  
sown with- propriety and safety.  
I conceive that the only way to get these  
grounds in good order and with expedition, is to  
give them one good ploughing and then to tear  
them to pieces with heavy harrows. • Whether  
it be necessary to cut down and take off the  
weeds previous to these workings can be decided  
better by experiments on the spot than by rea­  
soning on it at a distance. My desire is that the  
ground shall be made perfectly clean, and laid  
down smooth ; without which meadows will al­  
ways be foul; much grass left in them, and ma­  
ny scythes broken in cutting what is taken off.  
4th. The buckwheat which has been sown  
for manure ought to be ploughed in the moment  
a sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the ground  
a second time; otherwise, so far from its answer­  
ing the purpose of manure, it will become an  
exhauster. For this reason, it the ploughs be­  
longing to the farm are unable to turn it in time,  
those of Muddy hole, Dague run and Union farm,  
must combine to do it, the work to be repaid by  
the farm which receives the benefit, as soon as  
the work is accomplished thereat.  
5th. Where clover and timothy seeds are mix­  
  
eu ana sown togetner, allow nve pints or tnenrst,  
and three of the latter to the acre ; and where  
timothy only is sown, allow four quarts to the  
acre. Let the seed be measured in the propor­  
tions here allotted, and put into a half bushel  
filled with sand or dry earth, and extremely well  
mixed together iii your own presence or by your­  
self, which will answer two good purposes, viz :  
1st, to prevent theft, for seeds thus mixed would  
not sell—and 2dly, the. seedsman being accus­  
tomed to sow a bushel of wheat to the acre would  
he at no loss to cast a bushel of this or anything  
else, regularly on that quantity of ground.  
6th. It is expected you will begin to sow  
wheat early in August, and in ground perfectly  
clean and well ploughed. I would have, and  
do accordingly direct, that not less than fivep&lt;cks  
of seed be sown on each acre. The plan of the  
farm over which you look is given to Mr. Lewis,  
from which the contents of each field may be  
known. And it is my express direction that  
every watch and the best attention may be giv­  
en to see that this quantity actually is put in ;  
for I have strong suspicions (but this ought not  
to be hinted to them) that the seedsmen help  
themselves to a pretty large toll.  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing and  
even before, if it can be done conveniently, you  
are to set heartily about threshing or treading  
out the wheat; and as fast as it is got out, tc  
have it delivered at the mill or elsewhere, accord­  
ing to directions. The longer this business it  
delayed, the more waste and embezzlement wil  
there be of the crop. The wheat is to be wel  
cleaned ; the chaff and light wheat are to be  
properly taken care of for the horses or other  
stock-arid the straw stacked and secured as il  
ought to be against weather and other injuries ;  
and until the whole be delivered, it will require  
your constant and close attention  
Wth. The oats at the farm you overlook, are, I  
presume, all cut, in that case, let all the scythes,  
and cradles, and rakes, which you have received,  
be delivered over to the mansion house : or if  
you choose to keep them jigainst next harvest you  
must be responsible for them yourself,  
9th. The presumption also is, that the flax is,  
ere this, prulled j let it be Well secured and at a  
proper season stripped of its seed and spread tc  
rot. During this operation, let it be often turned  
and examined that it be not overdone, or receive  
injury in any other respect by laying out too long.  
10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat for seed,  
and that which is freest from onions. I would  
have about one-third of my whole crop sown  
with the common wheat ; one-third with the  
white ; and the other third with the yellow  
bearded wheat. The overseers (with Davy, as  
he knows the state of his own farm and the qual­  
ity of the wheat which grows upon it,) may  
meet and decide among themselves whether  
it would be best to have some of each ol  
these sorts on every farm ; or in order more ef­  
fectually to prevent mixture, to have one sort on  
ly on a farm. In the latter case, the cutting of  
that which ripens first, and so on, must be&quot;ac­  
complished by the force of all the farms instead  
of each doing its own work. If the seed on one  
farm was to be sown on another, especially if  
seed which grew on a Jighf sojl was to be sown  
on a stiff one, and that which grew on a stiff  
one sown on a light ground, advantages would  
unnnestionablv result from it.  
  
11th. The potatoes at the mansion house must  
he worked by the ploughs from Union farm, and  
when this is required, it would be best,^conceive,  
to accomplish the work in a day,  
l‘2th. It is expected that the fences will be  
made secure, and no damage permitted within  
them by creatures of any kind, or belonging to  
any body—mine any more than others.  
18th. The greatest attention is to be paid to  
stocks of all kinds on the farms; nnd the most  
than can be made of their manure and litter.  
They are to be counted regularly, that no false  
reports may be made ; and missing ones if any,  
hunted for until found, or the manner of their  
going can be accounted for satisfactorily,  
14th. A weekly report, as usual,is to be bandr  
ed to Mr. Lewis. In this report, that 1 may  
know better how the work goes on, mention  
when you begin to plough, hoe, or otherwise  
work in a field, and when that field is finished.  
The increase, decrease and changes are to be no?  
ted as heretofore?—and let me ask :  
15th. Why are the corn harrows thrown  
aside, or so little used that I rarely of late ever  
see or hear of their beingat work? I havebeen  
run to very considerable expense in providing  
these and other implements for rny farms ; and  
to my great mortification and injury, find, gen­  
erally speaking, that wherever they were last  
used they remain, if not stolen, till required  
again : by which means they, as well as the  
carts, receive so much injury from the wet wea­  
ther and the heat of the sun as to he unfit  
for use ; to repair or supply the place of which,  
wilh new ones, my carpenters (who ought to Ik­  
otherwise employed) are continually occupied in  
these jobs. Marrows, after the ground is well  
broken, would certainly weed and keep the corn  
clean with more ease than the ploughs. 1 hope,  
therefore, they will be used. And it is my ex­  
press orders that the greatest care Ire taken of  
the tools of every kind, carts and plantation im­  
plements, in future ; for I can no longer submit  
to the losses I have continually sustained by  
neglect.  
lflth. There is nothing I more ardently desire,  
nor indeed is there any more essential to my  
  
permanent interest, than the raising of live fer,  
cea on proper ditches or banks ; yet nothing has  
ever been, in a general way, more shamefully  
neglected or mismanaged ; for instead of prepar­  
ing the ground properly for the reception of the  
seed, and weeding and keeping the plants after  
they come up—the seeds are nardly scratched  
into the ground, and are suffered to be smother­  
ed by the weeds and grass if they do come up ;  
by which means the expense I have been at in  
purchasing and sending the seeds, (generally  
from Philadelphia,) together with the labor, such  
as it is, that has been incurred, is not only lost,  
but (and which is of infinitely more importance  
to me) season after season passes away, and l  
am as far from the accomplishment of my object  
as ever, 1 mention the matter thus fully tpsnow  
how anxious I am that all the seeds which have  
been sown or planted on the banks of the ditches  
should be properly attended to ; and the defi­  
cient spots made good, if you have or can obtain  
the means for doing it.  
17th. There is one thing I must caution you  
against (without knowing whether there be  
cause to charge you with it or not)—and that is  
not to retain any of my negroes who are able and  
fit to work in the crop, in or about your own  
house, for your own purposes. This I do not  
allow any overseer to do. A small boy or girl  
for the purpose of fetching wood or water, tend­  
ing a child* or some such thing, I do not object  
to ; but as soon as they are able to work out, I  
expect to reap the benefit of their labor myself.  
18th. Though last mentioned, it is not of the  
least importance, because the peace and good  
government of the negroes depend upon it ;  
and not less so my interest and your own repu­  
tation. I do, therefore, in explicit terms, enjoin  
it upon you to remain constantly at home, (un­  
less called off by unavoidable business, or to at­  
tend Divine worship) and to be constantly with  
your people when there. There is no other  
sure way of getting work well done and quietly  
by negroes ; for when an overseer’s back is  
turned the most of them will slight their work,  
or be idle altogether. In which case correction  
cannot retrieve either, but often produces evils v  
  
wnicn are worse man me disease. i&gt;or is mere  
any other mode but this to prevent thieving  
and other disorders, the consequence of oppor­  
tunities. You will recollect that your time is  
paid for by me, and if I am deprived of it, it is  
worse than the robbing my purse, because it is  
also a breach of trust, which any honest man  
ought to hold most sacred. You have found  
me, and you will continue to find me, L thful to  
my part of the agreement which was made with  
you, whilst you are attentive to your part ; but  
it is to be remembered that a breach on one  
side releases the obligation on the other. If,  
therefore, it shall be proved to me that you are  
absenting yourself from the farm or the people  
without just cause, I shall hold myself no morp •  
bound to pay the wages, than you do to attend  
strictly to tne charge which is entrusted to you  
by one who has every disposition to be  
Your friend and servant,  
Geo. Washington

tion in these matters. Von will, therefore, pay  
due regard to such directions as you may receive  
fioin him, considering them as coming immedi­  
ately from rmself. But that you may have a  
general knowledge of what I expect from you, I  
shall convey the following view which I have  
of the business committed te \our chaige, as it  
appears to me, and direct you to govern y°ur­  
self by it, as f am persuaded nothing inconsis­  
tent therewith will be ordered by Mr. Lewis  
without authority from me to depart from it.  
1st. Althoughit is almost needless to remark  
that the corn ground at the farm &gt;on overlook  
ought to be kept clean and well ploughed, yet,  
because not only the goodness of that crop de­  
pends upon such management, hut also the  
wheat crop which is to succeed it. I cannot for­  
bear urging the propriety and necessity of the  
measure in very strong terms.  
2d. The wheat is to he got into the barns or  
into stacks as soon as it can be done with any  
sort of convenience, that it may not (especially  
wTheat, which is subject to injury by bad weath­  
er,) sustain loss in shocks; and because the  
shattered grain in fields may be beneficial to the  
stock: but no hogs are to be put on stuhble­  
fitdds in which grass seeds were sown last fail,  
winter, or spring; other stock, however, may be  
turned on them, as it is rooting that would be  
  
prejudicial.  
3d. The w*ho!e swamp, from the road fiom  
Manley&#x27;s bridge up to the lane leading to the  
new barn, is to be got into the best and most  
complete order for sowing grass seeds in Au­  
gust. or, at the furthest, by the middle of Sep­  
tember. The lowest and wettest part thereof is  
to be sown with timothy seed alone. All the  
other paits of it are to be sown with timothy  
and clover seeds mixed. The swamp on the  
other side of the aforesaid Jane (now in corn  
and oats) is to lie kept in the best possible order,  
that the part not already sown with grass seeds  
may receive them this autumn (as soon as the  
corn can he taken off with safety) or in tlie  
spring, as circumstances shall dictate.  
No exertions or pains are to he spared at  
Dogue run to get the swamp from Manley&#x27;s  
bridge up to the meadow above, and the two  
enclosures in the mill swamp, in the highest or­  
der for grass, to he sown in the time and man­  
ner above mentioned; but, that no more may he  
attempted than can be executed well, proceed in  
the following order with them, accordingly ns  
the weather may happen to be; for this must be  
consulted, as dry weather will answer to woik  
in the low parts best, whilst the higher grounds  
may be woiked at any time:  
1st Begin with the swamp from Manley’s  
bridge and get all that is not already in grass  
well prepared for it, and indeed sown. ‘2d.  
That part of the low meadow on the mill run  
which lies between the old bed of it and the race  
and within the fences. 3. After this is done,  
take that part of enclosure above (which was  
in corn last year) lying between the ditch and  
fence No. 1, up and down to cross fences. 1th.  
Then go over the ditch, and prepare slipt after  
slipe as the ditch runs from the one cross fence  
to the other, and continue to do this as long as  
the season will he good or the seed can be sown  
with propriety and safety.  
I conceive that the only way to get these i  
grounds in good order and with expedition is to ]  
give them one good ploughing and then to tear  
them to pieces with heavy harrows. M hethcr  
it be necessary to cut down and take off the  
weeds previous to these workings can be decided  
better by experiments on the spot than by reason-1  
mg on ft at a distance. My desire is that the i  
ground shall he made perfectly clean, and laid  
down smooth : without which meadows will al­  
ways be foul, much grass left in them, and  
manvsevthes broken in culting what is taken off.  
1th. The Buckwheat which has been sown for  
manure ought to be ploughed in the moment a  
sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the ground a  
second time : otherwise, so far from its answer­  
ing the purpose of manure,- it will become an  
ex hauster. For this reason, if the ploughs be­  
longing to the farm are unable to turn it in time,  
those of Muddy hole. Dogue run and Union farm  
must combine to do it. the work to be repaid by  
the farm which receives the benefit as soon as  
tiie work is accomplished thereat.  
5th. VV&#x27;here clover and timothy seeds are  
mixed and sown together, allow five pints of  
the first and three of the latter to the acre: and  
where timothy only is sown allow four quarts to  
the acre. Let the*seed he measured in the pro­  
portions here allotted, and put into a half bushel  
and the half bushel filled with sand or dry earth  
and extremely well mixed together in your own  
presence or by yourself, which will answer two  
good purposes, viz. 1st to prpvent theft, for seeds  
thus mixed would not sell : and. 2dlv, the seeds­  
man being accustomed to sow a bushel of wheat  
to the acre would be at no loss to cast a bushel  
of this or any thing else regularly on that quan­  
tity of ground.  
Oth. It is expected you will begin to sow­  
wheat early in August, and in ground perfectly  
clean and well ploughed. I would have and  
do accordingly direct&quot;, that not less than five  
jK-cks of seed be sown on each acre. The  
plan of the farm over which you look is given  
to Mr. Lewis, from which the* contents of each  
field mav be known. And it is my express di­  
rection that every watch and the best attention  
may he given to see that this quantity actually  
is put in; for 1 have strong suspicions (but this  
ought not to be hinted to them) that the seeds­  
men help themselves to a pretty large toll.  
  
7th. As soon as \oii have (lone sowing, ana  
even before, if it can be done conveniently, &gt;on  
are to set heartily about threshing or treading  
the wheat, and as fast as it is got out to have  
it delivered at the mill or elsewhere, according  
to directions. The longer this business is de­  
layed the more waste and embezzlement will  
there be of the crop. 1 he wheat is to he well  
cleaned, the chaff and light wheat are to he pro­  
perly taken care of for the horses or other  
stock, and the straw stacked and secured as it  
ought to be against weather and other injuries;  
and, until the whole be delivered, it will re­  
quire }our constant and close attention.  
Sth. The oats at the farm you overlook are,  
I presume, all cut. In that case, let all scythes,  
and cradles, and rases wInch you have receiv­  
ed he delivered over to the mans on house: or.  
if yod choose to keep them against next har­  
vest, you must be responsible for them your­  
  
9 The presumption also is, that the flax is  
ere this pulled. Let it be well secured, and at  
a proper season stripped of its seed and spread  
to rot. During this operation let it be often  
turned and examined, that it be not overdone  
or receive injury in any other respect by lying  
out too long.  
10th Get the cleanest and best wheat for  
seed, and that which is freest from onions. 1  
would have about one-third of my whole cron  
sown with the common wheal; one third witn  
the white: and the other third with the yellow  
bearded wheat. The overseers (with Davy, as  
he knows the stafe ot his own farm and the  
quality of wheat which grows upon it) may  
meet and decide among themselves whether it  
  
wpuld be best to have some of each of these  
sorts on every/arm; or, in order more effectual­  
ly to prevent mixture, to have one sort only on  
a farm. In the latter case, the cutting of that  
which ripens first, and so on, must be accom­  
plished by the force of all the farms instead of  
each doing its own work. If the seed on one  
faim was to be sown on another, especially  
if seed which grew on a light soil was to be  
sown on a stifl one, and that which grew on a !  
still one sown on a light ground, advantages)  
would unquestionably result from it.  
lllh. The potatoes at the manson house  
must be worked bv the ploughs from LVion  
farm, and, when tins is required, it would be  
best, 1 conceive, to accomplish the work id a  
i:&gt;th. It is expected that the fences will be  
made secure, and no damage permitted within  
them by creatures of anykimi, or belonging to  
any body—mine any more than others.  
13th. The greatest attention is to he paid to  
stocks of all kinds on the farms; and the most  
that can be made of the manure and litter.—  
  
\ hey :ire to he counted regularly, that no laise  
reports may he made; and missing ones, ii any,  
hunted for un.il found, or the manner of their  
going can be accounted for satisfactorily.  
14th. A weekly report, as usual, is to be  
handed to Mr. Lewis. In this report, that I  
may know better how the work goes on. men­  
tion when you begin to plough, hoe, or other­  
wise work in a field, and when that field is  
finished. The increase, decrease, and changes  
to be noted as heretofore—and let me ask :  
15th. Why are the corn harrows thrown  
aside, or so little used that I rarely of late see  
or hear of their being at work? 1 have been  
run to very considerable expense in providing  
these and other implements for my faims: and.  
to my great mortification ami injury, find, gen­  
eially speaking, that wherever they were last  
used they remain, if not stolen, t.ll required  
again; by which means they, as well as the  
carts, receive &gt;o much injury from the wet  
weather and the heat of the sun as to be unfit  
for u&gt;c; to repair or supply the place of which  
with new ones my carpenters (who ought to be  
otherwise employed) are continually occupied  
in these jobs. Harrows, after the ground is  
well broken, would certainly weed and keep the  
corn clean with more ease than the ploughs.­  
I hope, theiefore, they will be used. And it is  
my express orders that the greatest care be ta­  
ken of the tools of every kind, carts, and plan­  
tation implements, in future: for 1 can no long­  
er submit to the losses I ani continually sus­  
taining hv neglect.  
loth. There is nothing 1 more ardently de­  
sire, nor indeed is there any more essential to  
my permanent interest, than the laising of live  
fences on proper ditches or banks: vet nothing  
has ever been, in a general way, more shame­  
fully neglected or mismanaged; for, instead of  
preparing the ground for the reception of the  
seed, and weeding and keeping the plants clean  
after they come up, the seeds are hardly scratch­  
ed into the ground, and are suffered to be smoth­  
ered by the weeds and grass if they do come  
up; by which means the expense L have been  
at in purchasing and sending the seeds, (gener­  
ally from Philadelphia,) together with the la­  
bor. such as it is, that has been incurred, is not  
only lo&gt;t, but (and which is ot more im­  
portance to me) season alter season passes  
away, and I am as far from the accomplish­  
ment of mv object as ever. I mention the mat­  
ter thus fully io show how anxious I am that  
ail the seeds which have been sown or planted  
on the banks of the ditches should be pioper­  
ly attended to, and the deficient spots made  
goo !, if you have or can obtain the means for  
doing it.  
17th. There is one that I must caution \ou  
against, (without knowing whether there be  
cause to charge sou with it or not,) and that i«.  
not to retain any of my negroes who are able  
and fit to work &quot;in the crop, in or about your  
own house for your own purposes. This I do  
not allow any overseer to do. A small boy or  
girl, for the purpose of fetching wood or wajrr.  
tending a child, or some such thing, 1 do not  
object to: but, so soon as they aie able to work  
oni. I expect to reap the benefit of their labor  
mvself.  
&quot;]&gt;th Though last mentioned it is not of the  
least importance, because the peace and good  
government of the negroes depend upon it. and  
not 1 ess so my interest and vourown reputa­  
tion. I do, therefore, in explicit terms, enjoin  
it upon you to remain constantly at home, (un­  
less called otf by unavoidable business, or to  
attend Divine worship,) and to be constantly  
with your people when there. There is no  
other sure way of getting work well done by  
negroes: for when an overseer&#x27;s back is turned,  
the most of them will slight their work or be  
idle altogether, in which ca^e correction cannot  
retrieve either, hut often produces evils which  
are worse than the disease. Nor is there any  
other mode than this to prevent thieving and  
other disorders, the consequence of opportuni­  
ties. You will recollect that your time is paid  
for bv me, and. if 1 am deprived of it, it is  
worse than the robbing of my purse, because  
it is a breach of trust, which any hone.-t man  
ought to hold most sacred. Aon have found  
me, and von will continue io find me. faithful  
to my part of the agreement which was made  
with vou. whilst \ on are attentive to your part:  
but it is to he remembered that a breach on one  
side releases ihe obligation on the other. If,  
therefore, it shall he proved to me that you are  
absenting yourself from the fatm or the people  
without |iM cause, 1 shall hold mvsell no more  
bound to pay the wages than sou do to attend  
strictly to the charge which is entrusted to you  
hv one who has eveiy disposition to he

Gentlemen:-It being indispensably  
necessary that I should havo some per­  
son at Mount Vernon, throfigh whom I  
cn communicate mj orders; who will  
see that these orders-are. executed; or if  
nor obeyed, who .w-ill inform me why  
hey are not; who will receive the week­  
y resort&#x27; and transmit them; receive  
money and pay it; and in general to doI  
hose thiis which do&#x27; tot apertain to  
Mny individi:l overseer-1 have sen  
y nephew, Mr. I1owell Lewis, (who  
lives with we here),j attend to ilie  
ntil I can provido a manaiger of estab­  
islhed reputation.in these matter-. You  
vill-therefore pay due sregard to such  
directions aSyp ia reegfve rom 1iim.  
:onsidering thenfmi- oming imiiediateTy  
iom myself. But that you also nmay  
iave a geheral knihledge of what I  
-,xpct from yot I shall convey the  
following view (which I have of the hu.  
siness committed to your charge) as i  
appeals to me, antd direct you to govern  
ourself by it; as I am p-rsuadrd no­  
hing inconsistent t&#x27;tcrewiih will be or­  
ered by Mr. Lewis, without atithurity  
rom me to &#x27; depart from it.  
1st. Although it is almdst needless 40  
remar k that the corn ground at the Thiri  
you overlook ought to be kept perfectly  
lean and well plouihed-yet, because  
nct only the goodness of thait crop de­  
pends upon such management. but alsn  
the wheat crop, whie:h is to succeed it, I  
cannot foibear uiging the propriety and  
necessity of the measure in very strong.  
terms.  
2d. The wheat.is to be got into the  
barns or into stacks as it can be done  
with any, scrt of convenience that it may  
not (especially the bearded wheat, which  
is subject to injury&#x27; by wet weather,)  
sustain loss in shocks ; and because the  
shattered grain in fields mayt be, benci­  
ial to the stock; but no loL&#x27;s are to be  
ut on stubble fields in&#x27;lhich grass seers  
were sown hlast farll, winter, or s;.ring;  
ohier stock, l-owever, mary be turned on  
thm, as it is rooting that would be pre­  
judici!  
2. The idhole swamp from the road  
fromt Manley&#x27;s bridge, up to the larne  
leading to the new barn, is to be got  
iito the best and must complete order  
for sovwing grass seeds in A-enst.-or,  
t the farthest *by the mid dle of Septem­  
br. The lheest iind wtv.est part ther eof,  
is to be sown with tliaothy seed alone.  
All the other parts of it are to b.e sowni  
with tinmolij and clottr hceds iize~rd.  
The. swamp on the othrer side of the  
aforesaid lane (now in corn and oats) is  
to be kept in the best p)ossible order, that  
thepart not already sown idhtl grass  
seeds ma&#x27;y receive them either this no  
timn (as soon as tho cord can be taken  
off with safety) or in tho, spring; as cir­  
cumstances shall dictate.  
No exertions or pains aire to be spared  
at Dague run to -get the swamp from  
Manley&#x27;s bridge uip -to the meadow a bove,  
nd iihe two enciosures in the nill swabmp,  
in te hiest order for grass, to be  
sown in the time and manner above  
meftionecd. . But that no more may be  
attemipted thanecan be executed well,  
proceed ..n th~e following&#x27; order- iwith  
them .accordingly- as, thre..weather may  
happen to be, for this must be consulted,  
as dry weather- will -tinswer to work in  
the s..kw.-parts best, --whiist ther higher  
grounids may be wrorked at any time.  
FVs.&#x27;B~gin with the swamp frotWManL  
TefsBridg&quot;irpwards, and get till that is  
ntira vin .grass, ivell prepared for  
i,det sown. &#x27;2&#x27;hat piart .01  
the low meadow on the mill trn,&#x27; whichi  
lies between thb old. bed, pf..it .anid the  
  
this is Iono. lake that pait of encisure  
above (which vas in corn last year,)  
lying between the ditch and fence No. 1,  
up and down to cross fences. 4th. Then  
go over the ditch and propare slipo after  
sliiji as the ditch runs from the one cross  
fencee to the other&#x27;, and contnun to do  
this as long as the season will be good,  
or the seed can be sown with propriety  
and safety.  
- I conceive that the only way to get  
these grounds in goad order and with ex­  
pedition. is to give them one good  
ploughing and then to tear them to pie­  
res with heavy harrows. Whether it be  
necessaty to cut down and take off the  
weeds previous to these workings can  
be decided better by experiments on  
the.spot than by reasonir.g on it at .a  
distance. My desire is that the grournd  
shall be made perfectly clean, and laid  
down smooth; without which meadows  
will always be foul; much grass left in  
them, and many schythes broken in cut­  
ting vhat is taken off.  
4th. The buckwheat which has been  
sown for manure ought to be ploighed in  
the moment a suffiriency of seed is ripe  
to stock the ground asecond time; other­  
wise, so far from its answeking the pur­  
pose of manuie; it will become an cx­  
hauster. For this reason, if the ploughs  
belonging to the fairm are unable to tuin  
it in time. those of luddy hole; Dague  
run and Union farm, must combine to do  
i.t, the work to be repaid by the farm  
which receives. the benefit, as soon as  
tie i&#x27;ork is acconiplised thereat.  
5th. Wudre clover and tinothy seeds  
are mixed and sown toqether, allow five  
pints of the first, and thrae of the latter  
to tho acre; cund where timothy only is  
sown, allow four quarts to the acre. Let  
the seed be measured in the proportions  
here allotted, and put into a half bushel,  
and the half busbel filled vith sand or  
dry earth, and extremely well mixed to­  
gethtr in your own presence or by youtr -  
self, which will answer two good purpo­  
sesviz: 1i, to prevent theft, for sPeds  
thus mixed -would not sell-and dly,  
bushel of wheat to the acre would be at  
no loss to cast a bushel of this or any­  
thing else, regularly on that quantity of  
ground.  
6th. It is expected you will begin to  
sow wheat early in August,and in ground  
perfectly clean and well ploughed. I  
would have, and do a.:cordingly direct,  
that not less than five pecks of seed he  
sown on each acre. The plan of the  
farm ovier which jou look is given to  
Mr. Lewis, from which tli contents of  
each field may be&#x27; known. And it is  
my express direction that every watch  
and the hest attention may be given to  
see that this quantity actually is put in;  
for I have stiong susplicions (but this  
ought not to be hinted to them) that the  
seedsmen help themselves to a prelty  
large tol.  
&#x27;7th. As soon as you have done sow­  
ing and even before, if it can he done  
conveniently, you are to set heartily  
about threshing or treading out the  
wheat; and as fast as it is got out, to  
have it delivered at the mill or elsewhere,  
accordintg to directions. Tic longer this  
business is del.ayed, the more waste and  
em1bizzt.htment will there be of lie crop.  
The wheat is to bc well leaited; thle  
cha;ff andl light wheatt are to be properly  
taken care of for the horses or other  
sock--and the straw stacked and se­  
e-ured as it ought to be aigainst wveather  
aind other injuries; a::d until the whe  
be delivered, it will require your con­  
stant and close ;ittention...  
Slh. The Oats at the f.irm you over­  
look, are, I pi esume, all cut, in that  
case. let all thle scythles, and craidhes, and  
rakes, wvhich you haive. received, be de­  
livered over to the mansion hotise; or if  
you choose, to keep them against next  
harvest you must be responsible for themi  
yourself..­  
9th.&#x27;The liresnmption ailso is, that  
the flax is, ere this&#x27;pulled; let it be well  
sectured and at a-proper seison stripped  
ol its seed, and spread to rot. During  
I this operation, 1l.t it be often turned and  
exaimine&#x27;d tha.t it be not overdone, or re­  
ceive injury ini any other respect by lay­  
ing out too long..  
10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat  
for seed, and that which is freest from  
onions. I woula have about onesthiid  
of my whole crop sown wvith the comn­  
mon wheat; one-third with the white;  
and tho othier third with the yellow  
bearded wvheat.. The overseers (with  
Dlavy, as lhe knpows the state of his own  
faztm and the qunlity of the wheat whlich  
grows uipon it,)1miay meet ,and* decide  
among themselves whethier it would be  
best to-havesome of..each of these forts  
on evet y farm; or. in or deer iore effectu­  
ally to prevent mixture, to.have one sort  
only on a fari. , n.theo latter case, the  
cutting of thit which rippns first, and so  
oo, rntasbe ac~c.otinphliedI by the force  
of all thob farmis instead of e (acding its  
own work. Wfthe seed on eti farior was  
to be sown- on anotheaneci11yv if ied  
  
which grew on &#x27;a light soil was to be  
sown on a stiff one; and that which grew  
onl a sif one sow&#x27;n on a light ground,  
advantags would-unquestionably result  
from it  
11th. Ihe potatoes at the mansion  
houset, nist be worked: by the ploughs  
from Uirlon farm, and when this requir­  
ed, it wotid beo best, I conceive, to ac­  
complis &#x27; tho wiolkin a day.  
12th 9i is expected that the fences  
will .bnaide secure- and no dampge  
permitted-withiri them by creatuies of  
any kind&amp;or belonging to any body­  
minn any&#x27; more than others. -  
183irdi7&#x27;ne greatest attention is to be  
paid tolstocks of allskinds on the farms;  
andthe ostthit an be made of their  
manuro .id litter. They are to be  
counted ieguilarlv, that no false reports  
may beMadE: and missing ones if .any,  
hunted fr until found, or the manner of  
of their going can be accounted for sat­  
isfactorily  
14th. kweekly report, as ustual, is to  
be handedito Mr. -Lewis. In this report,  
that I i.&#x27;anow better how the w ork  
goes on, 4nintion when you begin to  
plough; hoe or otherwise work in a field,  
and when tbe fiid is finished. The in­  
crease, &#x27;direase and changes are to be  
noted as heretofore-and let me ask:  
15th&#x27;j- are the corn harrows  
throtn de, or so little used that I  
rarely. o te ever see or hear of their  
being it rk I have been run to very  
consider :expense in providing these  
and othe Mplenits-for my farms; and  
to myi mortu cation and injury,  
t1rd, bqlly speaking, that wherever  
they (v st used they remain, if not  
stolen ~ -anted again; by whic!i means  
they as as the carts, receive so much  
injury the wet ..weather and the  
heat of t n as to be unfit for use; to  
repair oriply the place of which; with  
r.ewv one my carpenters (who ought to  
be other. . employed) are eontinually  
occupied if thesejobs. H nrrows, after  
the gaunt&#x27;s well broken, would cer­  
taindgw and keep the corn.clean  
hope, therefore, they will be used. And  
it is my express orders that the greatest  
care he taken of the toolsofevery kind,  
carts and plantation implements,t in fu­  
iurt&#x27;; for I can no longer submit to the  
losses I am c.mntinually sustaining by  
neglect. .  
16th. Thie is no:hing I more ar­  
dently desire, nor indeed is there any  
more essential to my permanent interest,  
than the raising of live fences on proper  
ditches or banks; yet nothinig has ,.ever  
been, in a general way, more shamefull&#x27;  
neglectid dr niismanged; for insiead of  
preparing the ground properly for the  
reception of the seed and weedinfand  
keeping the plants clean after they conie  
up-the seeds. are hardly scratched into  
the ground, and are suffered to be smoth­  
cred by the weeds and grass if they do  
come up; by Which means the expense I  
have been at in po chasing. and sending  
the seeds (generally front Philadelphia,)  
together with the labor, such as it is,  
tha: has been incurred, is not only lost,  
but (and which is of infnitely more im­  
portance to me) season after season  
paises away, and I am as far from the  
;ccomplishrment of my objct as ever. I  
mention the matter thtus buy to showv  
how anxious I am that all the seeds  
which htave bee&#x27;n SOWn or planted orn the  
banksof the ditch.&#x27;s should be prope&#x27;rhy  
attended to; and the deficient spots made  
good, if you have or can obtain the  
means for doing it. . ,  
17th. There is one thing I must caut­  
tionyoui ngainst (withont knowing taheth,  
er therre be cause to charge you.ith it  
or noi)-and that is not to retain any of  
my ne&#x27;groes who are able atid fit to. wvomk  
in the crop., in or about your own house,  
for y our own pur poses. .,This 1 do not  
allow eily overseer to do. . A small -boy  
oi-gitl for the puirpose of fetching wood  
or wvater, tending a chuild, or some such  
thing, 1 do not object to; but so soon as  
they are able to wvork out, I expect to  
reap the k;enefit of their labor muyself.,  
18th. Thoughi last mentioned, it .is  
not of the least importance,&#x27;because the  
peace and good government of the ne­  
groes dep&#x27;end upon i; ,and net less so  
my interest and four owni reputation. I  
do, therefore, in eitplicit termis, enjoin it  
upon you to remain consta&#x27;ntly at home,  
unless called off bi unavoidable sbtisi-.  
ness, or, to attand Divine worship) and,  
to be constantly with your peoplhe ,when  
there. There is no other sure waf of  
getting work well done, and qudily by  
ntegroos;&#x27; for wvhen on overseer&#x27;s b&#x27;ack is  
turned the most of them will slight their  
work, or be idle altogether. In which  
case correction ,cannot retrievpe either,  
but often prodnees evils which are ,worse  
than the disease. Nor is there and~other  
mode but this to prevent1 thieving and  
ether disorders, the consequnce of op­  
portunies. You will recollect that your  
time is paid for by me, and if I am doe  
prived of it, it is worse than the robbing  
my &#x27;purse;&#x27; because it is also a&#x27;breach oi  
  
trust, which any honest man ought to  
hold most sacred. You have found mr,  
and you wilf continue to find me faithful  
to my part of the agreement which was  
made with you, whilst you are attentive  
to your part; but it is to be remembered  
that a breach on one. side releases tho  
obligation on the other. 1, thwrefore,  
it shall be proved to me that you areb  
senting yoursell from the farm of the  
people nithout just&#x27; cause I shall hold  
myself no more bound to pdiy the wages,  
than you do to attend strictly to the  
charge which is entrusted to yoi: by ond  
who has every disp&#x27;xition to be  
Your friend and servant,.

Gentlemen: It being indispensably necessary th  
should have some person at Mount Vernon throi  
whom I can communicate my orders, who will see I  
those orders are executed, or, if not obeyed, who will  
form me why they are not; who will receive the wee  
reports and transmit theui: receive money and pay  
and, in general, to do those things which do not apper  
to any individual overseer, 1 have sent my nephew,  
Howell Lewis, (who lives with me here,) to attend  
thern until I can provide a manager of established repi  
tron in these matters. You will, theiefore, pay due  
gard to such directions as you may receive from h  
considering thern as coming immediately from myr  
O-.a H a ? I - I. ... 1,  
  
19ill Mini yuu may uavc a gcnciai kiiuwicu^c ui wu  
expect from you, I shall convey the following v  
which 1 have of the business committed to your cha  
as it appears to me, and direct you to govern yoursel:  
it, aa 1 am persuaded nothing inconsistent therewith  
be ordered by Mr. Lewis without authority from in  
depart from it.  
1st. Although it is almost needless to remark that  
corn ground at the farm you overlook ought to be I  
I clean and well ploughed, yet, because not only the gc  
ness of that crop depends upon sucb management,  
also the wheat crop which is to succeed it, 1 cannot  
bear urging the propriety and necessity of the measur  
very atrong terms.  
Ud. The wheat is to be got into the barns or into sta  
as soon as it can be done with any sort of convenie  
that it inav not (especially wheat, which is subiei  
  
I injury by bad weather) sustain loss in shocks; ami  
I cause the shattered grain in fields may be henetici.  
the stock ; but no hogs are to be put on stubble-field  
f which grass seeds were sown last fall, winter, or spri  
[ other stock, however, may be turned on (hem, as i  
rooting that would be pvjuJicial.  
3d. The wbole swamp, from the road from Manli  
bridge up to the lane leading to the new barn, is t&lt;  
, got into the best and most complete order for sow  
i grass seeds in August, or, at the furthest, by the ini&lt;  
&#x27; of September. The lowest and wettest nart thereof i  
be sown with timothy seed alone. All the other part  
i it are to be sown with timothy and clover seeds mis  
i The swamp on the other side of the aforesaid lane (r  
in corn ana oats) is to be kept in the best possible or  
that the part not already sown with grass seeds may  
ceive them this autumn (as soon as the corn can be ta  
off&quot; with safety) or in the spring, as circumstances si  
dictate.  
! No exertions or pains are to be spared at Dogue rui  
get the swamp from Manley&#x27;s bridge up to the mean  
above, and the two enclosures in the mill swamp, in  
highest order for grass, to be sown in the time and m  
ner above mentioned; but, that no more may be atten  
ed than can be executed well, proceed in the follow  
order with them, accordingly as the weather may hap  
to be; for this must be consulted, as dry weather ^  
answer to work in the low parts best, whilst the big  
grounds may be worked at any time:  
1st. Begin with the swamp from Manley&#x27;s bridge,  
i get all that is not already in grass well prepared fo  
and indeed sown. 2d. That part of the low meadow  
the mill run which lies between the old bed of it  
the race and within the fences. 3d. After this is dc  
&quot; take that part of enclosure above (which was in corn  
year) lying between the ditch and fence No. 1, up ;  
down to cross fences. 4th. Then go over the ditch,  
prepare slipe after slipe as the ditch runs troin the  
cross fence to the other, and continue to do this as 1  
as the season will be good or the seed can be sown v  
  
propriety mm wticiy.  
I conceive (hat the only way to get these ground  
good order and with expedition is to give them one g  
ploughing and then to tear them to pieces with he  
narrows. Whether it he necessary to cut down and t  
off the weeds previous to these workings can be deci  
better by experiments on the spot than by reasoning o  
at a distance. My desire is that the ground shall be in  
perfectly clean, and laid down smooth, without wh  
meadows will always be foul, much grass left in th  
and many scythes broken in cutting what is taken off  
I 4th. Tne buckwheat which has Decn sown for man  
ought to be ploughed in the moment a sufficiency of s  
is ripe to stock the ground a second time; olheiwise.  
far rom its answering the purpose of manure, it will  
come an exhauster. For this reason, if the ploughs  
longing to the farm are unable to turn it in time, th  
of Muddy hole, Dogue run, and Union farm must cl  
. bine to do it, the work to he repaid by the farm wh  
&lt; receives the benefit as soon as the work is accouiplml  
1 thereat  
5th. Where clover and timothy seeds are mixed j  
i sown together, allow five pints of the first and three  
i the laUer to the acre ; and where timothy only is sot  
, allow lour quarts to the acre. Let the seed he measu  
  
in tne proportions nere allotted,and put into a h.ilt bust  
and the half bushel tilled with sand or dry earth, and  
tremely well mixed together in your own presence, or  
yourself, which will answer two good purposes, viz :  
; to prevent theft,for seeds thus mixed would notsell; a  
2dly, the seedsman being accustomed to sow a bushe  
wheat to the acre, would be at no loss to cast a bus  
of this or anything else regularly on that quantity  
ground.  
6th. ft is expected you will begin to sow wheat ea  
in August, and in grouud perfectly clean and well plouj  
cd. I would have, and do accordingly direct, thai  
less than five pecks of seed be sown on each acre. 1  
plan of the farm over which you look is given to 1  
Lewis, frosi which the contents of each lield may  
known. And it is my express direction that every wa  
and the best attention may be given to see that thisqu;  
tity actually is put in; fori have strong suspicions (  
this ought not to he hinted to tliein) that the seedsu  
help themselves to a pretty large toll.  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing, and even  
fore, if it can be done conveniently, you are to set he;  
ily about threshing or treading the wheat, and as fas  
it is got out to have it delivered at the mill or elsewhi  
according to directions. The longer this business is  
layed, the more waste and embezzlement will there bi  
the crop. The wheat is to be well cleaned, the chaff* i  
light wneat are to be properly taken care of for the hoi  
or other stock, and tne straw stacked and secured a  
ought to be against weather and other injuries ; and,  
til the whole oe delivered, it will require your const  
and close attention.  
8th. The oats at the farm you overlook are, I presu  
all cut. In that case, let all scythes, and cradles,;  
rakes which you have received be delivered over to  
mansion house; or, if you choose to keep them aga  
next harvest, you must he responsible for them yours  
9th. The presumption also is, that the flax is ere i  
pulled. Let it be well secured, and at a proper sea  
, stripped of its seed and spread to rot. During this c  
1 ration let it be often turned anil examined, that ir he  
  
&#x27; overdone or receive injury in any other restart by ly  
out too long.  
10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat for seed, i  
that which is freest from onions. I would have ab  
one-third of my whole crop sown with the eomn  
wheat; one-third with the white; and the other tl  
j with the vellow bearded wheat. The overseers (w  
Davy, as he knows the state of his own farm anil  
3n.il.ty of wheat which grows upon it) may meet i  
ecide among themselves whether it would be besl  
have some of each of these sorts on every farm; or  
order more effectually to urevent mixture, to have i  
^ aart only on a farm. In the latter case, the culling  
that which ripens first, and so on, must be aecoinpiis  
by the force ol all the farms instead ot each doing its o  
work. If the seed on one farm was to be sown on  
other, especially if seed which grew on a light soil t  
to be sown on a stiff one, and lhat which grew on a i  
one sown on a light ground, advantages would unqt  
lionably result from it.  
llth. The potatoes at tbe mansion house must  
worked by the ploughs from Union farm, and, when I  
is required, it would be best, I conceive, to accompl  
the work in e day.  
12th. It is expected that the fences will be made  
cure, and no damage permitted within them by create  
of any kind, or belonging to anybody?mine any m  
than others.  
13th. The greatest attention is to be paid to stocki  
all kinds on the farms; and the most that can be inadi  
the manure and litter. They are to be counted regulai  
that no false report* maybe made; and missing ones  
any, hunted for until found, or the manner of their go  
can be accounted for satisfactorily.  
14th. A weekly report, as usual, is to he handed to 1  
I.swis. In this report, that 1 may know better how  
work go.ts on, mention when you begin to plough, b  
or otherwise Wink ill a field, and when that field is f  
  
ished. The increase, decrease, and changes to be noted  
as heretofore?and let me ask:  
^ 13th. Why are the corn harrows thrown aside, or so  
little used, that 1 rarely of late see or hear of their being  
/_ at work .&#x27; 1 hare been run to very considerable expense  
. in providing these and other implements for my farms;  
i * and, to my great mortihcation and injury, find, generally  
I I speaking, that wherever they were last used they remain,  
I if not stolen, till required again ; by which means they,  
, as well as the carts, receive so much injury from the wet  
, weather and the heal of the sun as to be unfit for use ;  
to repair or supply the place of which with new ones my  
caipenters (who ought to be otherwise employed) are  
continually occupied in these jobs. Harrows, after the  
!&quot;&#x27; ground is well broken, would certainly weed and keep  
ibe corn clean with more ease than the ploughs. 1 hope,  
;ein therefore, they will be used. And it is my express orders  
**&#x27; that the greatest care be taken of tbe tools of every kind,  
I carts, and plantation implements, in future: for 1 can no  
:.r, longer submit to the losses 1 ain continually sustaining  
m.&quot; by neglect.  
16th. There is nothing I more ardently desire, nor h  
indeed is there any more essential to my permanent in- f  
the tereKl &#x27;ban the raising of live fences on proper ditches or a  
j banks, yet nothing lias ever been, in a general way, &#x27;  
irst ,nofe shamefully neglected or mismanaged; for, instead t  
of preparing the ground for the recejition of the seed, and &gt;  
t weeding and keeping the plants clean alter they come up, r  
&#x27; the seeds are hardly scratched into the giound, and are  
at &#x27; suffered to be smothered by tbe weeds and grass if they do &#x27;  
come up; by which means the expense I huve been at in *  
&#x27;?at purchasing and sending the seeds, (generally from Phila- _  
delphia,) together with the labor, such as it is, that has |  
k.&#x27;y been incurred, is not only lost, but (and which is of more t  
&#x27;f&gt; importance to me) season after season passes away, and t.  
lain I (... / r.i;?i,m.?t ??  
  
ever. I mention the matter thus fully to show how o  
1 t0 anxious I am that all the seeds which have been sown 0  
ula&quot; or planted on the banks of the ditches should be properly  
re attended to, and the deficient s|?ota made good, if you a  
&#x27;&quot;J1&#x27; have or can obtain the means for doing it.  
K&#x27;&#x27;: 17th. There is one thing that 1 must caution you against,  
at&#x27; (without knowing whether there be cause to charge you  
,ew with it or not,) and that is, not&#x27;to retain any of my neJt?e?  
groes who are able and fit to work in the crop in or ,  
&#x27; hy about your own house for your own purposes. This 1 do  
wl&quot; not allow any overseer to ao. A small boy or girl for the ]  
e 10 purpose of fetching wood or water, tending a child, or ?  
some such thing, f do not object to; but so soon as they i  
&#x27;he are able to work out 1 expect to reap the benefit of their &lt;  
py labor myself. t  
18th. Though last mentioned it is not of the least im- c  
but portance, because the peace and good government of the  
for- negroes depend ufion it, and not less so my interest and  
6 ,n your own reputation. I do, therefore, in explicit terms,  
enjoin it upon you to remain constantly at home, (unless  
icks called oft by unavoidable business, or to attend Divine  
nce&gt; worship,) and to be constantly with your people when  
:t to there. There is no other sure way ef getting work well  
he- done by negroes; for when an overseer&#x27;s back is turned,  
&quot; the most of them will slight their work or be idle alto8  
ln gether, in which case correction cannot retrieve either,  
&#x27;?(?; but often produces evils which arc worse than the dis&#x27;  
18 ease. Nor is there any other mode than this to prevent  
thieving and other disorders, the consequence of opportuB&gt;.&#x27;s  
nities. You will recollect that your tune is paid for by  
&quot;e | me, and if 1 atn deprived of it, it is worse than the rob­  
  
lnl? bing of my purse, because it is a breach ol trust, which  
Idle llt,y honest mail ought to hold most sacred. You have  
8 to found me, and you will continue to find me, faithful to  
so&#x27; my part of the agreement which was made with you,  
:ed. whilst you are attentive to your part; but it is to be relow  
membered that a breach on one side releases the obligaaer&gt;  
tion on the other. If, therefore, it shall be proved to me  
re&quot; that you are absenting yourself from the farm or the peo*erJ  
pie without just cause, 1 shall hold myself no more bound ,  
^ill to pay the wages than you do to attend strictly to the [  
charge which is intrusted to you by one who has every c  
P t0 disposition to be your friend and servant,

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Gentlemen being indispensably necessary   
that I should have some person at Mount Vernon,   
through whom I can communicate my orders; who   
will- see that these orders are executed ; or if not   
obeyed, who will -inform me why they are not;   
who will receive the weekly report&#x27;s, and transmit   
them; receive money, and pay it; and in general   
to do those things which do not appertain to any   
individual overseer—l have sent my nephew, Mr.   
Howell Lewis, (who lives with me here,) to attend   
to them until I can provide a manager of established   
reputation in these matters. You will therefore   
pay due regard to such directions as you may re­  
ceive from him, considering them as coming imme­  
diately from myself. But that you also may have   
a general knowledge of what I expect from you. T   
shall convey the following view (which I have of   
the business committed to your charge) as it appears   
to me, and direct you to govern yourself by it; as   
I am persuaded nothing inconsistent therewith will   
be ordered by Mrs. Lewis, without authority from   
me to depart from it:   
Ist. Although it is almost needlesslo-.remark   
that the corn-ground at the farm you overlook   
ought to be kept perfectly clean and well ploughed   
—yet, because not only the goodness of that crop   
depends upon such management, but also the wheat   
crop, which is to succeed it, I cannot forbear urging   
the propriety and necessity of the measure in very   
strong terms.   
  
al. The wheat is to be got into the barns or into   
stacks as soon as it can be done with any sort of   
convenience, that it may not (especially the bearded   
wheat, which is subject to injury by wet weather)   
sustain loss in shocks; and because the shattered   
grain in the fields may be beneficial to the stock ;   
but no hogs are to be put on stubble fields in which   
grass seeds were sown last fall, winter, or spring;   
other stock, however, may be turned on them, as it   
is rooting that would be prejudicial.   
3d. The whole swamp, from the road-frcim Man­  
ley&#x27;s bridge, up to the lane leading to the new barn,   
is to be got into the best and most complete order   
for sowing grass seeds in August, or, at the furthest,   
by the middle of September. The lowest and wet­  
test part thereof is to be sown with timothy seed   
and clover seed mixed. The swamp on the other   
side of the aforesaid lane (now in corn and oats) is   
to be kept in the best possible order, that the part   
not already sown with grass seeds may receive   
them eitheir this Autumn (as soon as the corn can   
be taken off with safety) or in the Spring, as cir­  
cumstances shall dictate.   
  
No exertions or-pains are to be spared at Dague   
run to get the swamp from Manley&#x27;s bridge up to   
the meadow above, and the two enclosures in the   
mill swamp, in the highest order for grass, to be   
sown in the time and manner above mentioned.   
But that no more be attempted than can be execu­  
ted well, proceed in the following  
order with them   
as the weather may happen to be, for this must he   
consulted, as dry weather will answer to work in   
the low parts best, whilst the higher grounds may   
be worked at .any time :   
Ist. Begin with the swamp from Manley&#x27;s bridge   
upwards, and get all that is not already in grass,   
well prepared for it, and indeed sown. 2d. That   
part of the low meadow on the mill run, which lies   
between the old bed of it and the race, and within   
the fences. 3d. After this is done, take that part   
of the .enclosure above (which was in corn last   
&#x27;year,) lying between the ditch and-fence&#x27; No. 1, up   
and down to cross fences. 4th.. &#x27;rhea go over the   
ditch and prepare slipe after slipe, as the ditch   
runs from one cross fence to the other ; and con­  
tinue to do this as long as the season will be good,   
or the seed can be sown with propriety and safety.   
1 conceive that the only way to get these grounds   
in good order and with expedition, and then to tear   
them to pieces .with heavy harrows. Whether it   
be necessary to cut down and take off the weeds   
previous to these workings, can be decided better   
by experiments on the spot than by reasoning on it   
at a distance. My desire is that the ground shall   
be perfectly clean, and laid down smooth ; without   
which meadows will always be foul, much grass   
left in them,-and many scythes broken in cutting   
what is taken off.   
4th. The&#x27; bnckwheat which has been sown for   
manure ought to be ploughed in the moment a suffi­  
ciency of seed is ripe to stock the ground a second   
time ; othervvise,_so far from its answering the pur­  
pose of manure, it will become an exhauster. For   
this reason, if the ploughs belongi4g to the farm   
are unable to turn it in time, those a Muddy hole,   
Dague run, and Union farm, must dill:thine to do it   
—the work to be repaidby the fdim.vhich receives   
the benefit as soon as the work is -accomplished   
thereat.   
  
sth. Where clover and timothy seeds.,are mixed   
and sown together, allow five pints of the first and   
three of the latter to the acre and where timothy   
only is sown, allow four quarts to the acre. Let   
the seed be measured in the proportions here allot­  
ted,and put into a half-bushel, and the half-bushel   
filled with sand or dry earth, and extremely well   
mixed together in your own presence or by your­  
self; which will answer two good purposes, viz: Ist   
to prevent theft—for seeds thus mixed would not   
sell; and 2dly the seedsman being accustomed to   
sow a bushel of wheat to the acre, would be at no   
loss to cast a bushel of this or any thing else regu­  
larly on that quantity of ground.   
6th. It is expected that you: will begin to sow   
wheat early in August, and in ground perfectly   
clean and well-ploughed. I would have, and do   
accordingly direct, that not less than live pecks of   
seed, be sown on each acre. The plan of the   
farm over which you look is given to Mr. Lewis,   
from which the contents of eachfield may be known.   
And it is my express direction that every watch   
and the best attention may be given to see that this   
quantity actually is put in; for I have strong sus.   
picions (but this ought not to be hinted to them)   
that the seedsmen help themselves to a pretty large   
toll.   
  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing, and even   
before, if it can be done conveniently, you are to   
set heartily about threshing or treading out the   
wheat; and as fast as it is got out, to have it de-   
livered at the mill or elsewhere, according to direc•   
tions. The longer this business is delayed, the   
more waste and embezzlement will there be of the   
crop. The wheat is to be well cleaned; the chaff   
and light wheat are to be properly taken care of   
for the horses or other stock, and the straw stacked   
and secured as it ought to be against weather and   
other injuries; and until the whole be delivered, it   
will require your constant and close attention.   
Bth. The oats at the farm you overlook are, I   
presume, all cut;&#x27;in that case let all the scythes,   
and cradles, and rakes which you have received, be   
delivered over • to the mansion house ; or if you   
choose to keep them against next harvest, you must   
be responsible for them yourself.   
9th. The presumption &#x27;also is, that the flax is,   
ere this, pulled; let it be well secured, and at a   
proper season stripped of its seed and Spread to rot.   
During this operation, let it be often turned and ex   
ambled that it be not overdone, or receive &#x27;injury   
in any other respect by Paying out too long.   
10th. Get the cleaheit&#x27;and best wheat for seed,   
and that which is-freest from onions. I would   
have about inteithird of my whole crop sown with   
  
the common wheat; one-third with the white; and   
the other third with the yellow bearded wheat.—  
The overseers (with Davy,_as..he-knows the state   
of his&quot; own farm and the quality, of the wheat   
which grows upon it) may meet and decide among   
themselves whether it would be best to have some   
of each of these sorts on every farm; or; in order   
more effectually to prevent mixture, to. have one   
ort only on a farm. In the latter case, the cutting   
of that which ripens first, and so on, must be ac­  
complished by the force of all the farnig, instead of   
each doing its own work. If the seed on one farm   
was to be sown on another, especially if seed which   
grew on a light soil was to be sown on a stiff one,   
and that which grew on a stiff one sown on a light   
ground, advantages ...would unquestionably result   
from it. •   
  
11th. The potatoes at the mansion house must   
be worked by the ploughs from Union Earth, and   
when this is required, it would be best, I conceive,   
to accomplish the work in a day.   
11th. The potatoes at the mansion house must   
be worked by the ploughs from Unfona farin, and   
when this is required, it would be best, &#x27;I conceive,   
to accomplish the work in a day,   
12th. It is expected that the fences will be made   
secure, and no damage permitted within them by   
creatures of any kind, or belonging to anybody—  
mine any more than others.   
  
13th. The greatest attention &#x27;is to be paid to   
stocks of all kinds on the farms; and the most that   
can be made of their manure and litter. They are   
to be counted regularly, that no false reports may   
be made; and missing ones, if any, hunted for until   
found, or the manner of their going can be accoun­  
ted for satisfactorily.   
11th. A weekly report, as usual, is to be handed   
to Mr. Lewis. In this report, that I may know   
better how the work goes on, mention when you   
begin to plough, hoe, or otherwise work in a field,   
and when that field is finished. The increase, de­  
crease, and changes are to be noted as heretofore—  
and let me ask:   
  
15th. Why are the corn harrows thrown aside,   
or so little used that I rarely of late ever see or   
hear of their being at work? I have been run to   
very considerable expense in providing these and   
other implements for my farms; and to my great   
mortification and injury, find, generally speaking,   
that wherever they were last used they remain, if   
not stolen, till required again; by which means   
they, as well as the carts, receive so much injury   
from the wet weather and the heat of the sun as   
to be unfit for use : to repair or supply the place of   
which, with new ones, my carpenters (who ought   
to be otherwise employed) are continually occupied   
in these jobs. Harrows, after the ground is well   
broken, would certainly weed and keep the corn   
clean with more ease than the ploughs. I hope,   
therefore, they grill be used. And it is my express   
orders that the greatest care be taken of the tools   
of every kind, carts, and plantation implements, in   
future; for I can no longer submit to the losses I   
am continually sustaining by neglect. -   
16th. There is nothing I more ardently desire,   
nor• indeed is there any more essential to my per­  
manent interest, than the raising of live fences on   
proper ditches or banks; yet nothing has ever been,   
in a general way, more shamefully neglected or   
mismanaged; for instead of preparing the ground   
properly for the reception of the seed-and weeding   
and keeping the plants clean after they come up—  
the seeds are hardly scratched into the ground, and   
are suffered to be smothered by the weeds and grass   
if they do come; by which means the expense r   
have been at in purchasing and sending the seeds   
(generally from -Philadelphia,) together with the la­  
bor, such as it is, that has been incurred, is not only   
lost, but. (and which is of infinitely more impor­  
tance to me) season after season passes away, and I   
am as far from the accomplishment of my object as   
ever. I mention the matter thus fully to show how   
anxious I am that all the seeds which have been   
sown or planted on the banks of the ditches should   
be properly attended to ; and the deficient spots   
made good, if you have or can obtain the means   
for doing it. -   
  
17th. There is one thing I must caution you   
against (without knowing whether there be cause   
to charge you with it or not)—and that is, not to   
retain any of my negroes who are able and fit to   
work in the crop, in or about your own house, for   
your own purposes. This Ido not allow any over­  
seer to do. A small boy or girl for fetching wood   
or water, tending a child, or some such thing, I Jo   
not object to; but so soon as they are able to work   
out, I expect to reap the benefit of their labor &#x27;my­  
self. &#x27;   
  
18th: Though last mentioned, it is not of the   
least importance, because the peace and good gov­  
ernment of the negroes depend upon it;, and not   
less so my interest and your own reputation. I do,   
therefore, in explicit terms, enjoin it upon you to   
remain constantly at home, (unless called off by   
unavoidable business, or to attend Divine worship,)   
and to be constantly with your people when there.   
There is no other sure way of getting work well   
done and quietly by negroes; for when an over­  
seer&#x27;s back is turned, the most of them will slight   
their work, or be idle altogether. In which case   
correction cannot retrieve either, but often produces   
evils tvhicb are worse than the disease. Nor is   
there any other mode but this to prevent thieving   
and other disorders, the consequence of opportuni­  
ties. You will recollect that your time is paid for   
by me, and if I am deprived of it, it is worse than   
the robbing my purse, because it is also a breach   
of trust, which any honest man ought to hold most   
sacred. You have found me, and you will continue   
to find me faithful to my part of the agreement   
which was made with you, whilst you are attentive   
to your part; but it is to be remembered that q   
breach on one side releases the obligation on the   
other. If, therefore, it shall be proved to me that   
you are absenting yourself from the farm or the   
people without just cause, I shall hold myself no   
more bound to pay the wages, than syou do to   
attend strictly to the charge which is intrusted to   
you by one who has every disposition to be your   
friend and servant, GEO. WASHINGTON.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Gentlemen : It being indispensably ne­  
cessary that I should have a person at.Mouut  
Vemoii.thro&#x27; whom I can communicate my  
orders ; who will see that these orders arc  
executed; or if not obeyed, who will in  
form me why they are not ; who will re­  
ceive the weekly reports, and transmit them  
receive money, and pay it; and in gen­  
eral to do those things which do not apper  
tain to any individual overseer, I have  
sent my nephew, Mr. Howell Lewis, (who  
lives with me here,) to attepu to them until  
I can provide a manager of established  
reputation in these matters. You will  
therefore pay due regard to such direc­  
tions us you may receive from him. ronsid-  
  
ering llicm as coming directly from myself.  
But that you also may have a general knowl­  
edge of what I expect from you, I sb ill con­  
vey the following view (which 1 have the.  
business committed to your charge) as it  
appears to me, and direct yon to govern  
yourself by it: I am persuaded nothing in­  
consistent therewith will be ordered by Mr.  
Lewis, without authority from me to depart  
from it :  
1st. Although it is almost needless to re­  
mark that the corn &quot;round at the farm you  
overlook ought to be kept perfectly clean  
and well plowed yet, because not only the  
goodness of that crop depends upon such  
management, but also the wheal crop which  
is to succeed it, I cannot l&#x27;irbc.ir urging  
the propriety and necessity of the inc isure  
in very strong terms.  
2d. The wheat is to be got into the barns  
or into stacks as soon as it can be done with  
any sort of convenience, that it may not  
(especially the bearded wheal, which is sub­  
ject to injury by wet weather) sustain loss  
in shocks; and because the shattered grain  
in fields may be benelici.il to the stock; but  
no hogs are to be put on stubble- fields in  
which grass seeds were sown la-t fall, win­  
ter or spring; other slock however, may be  
  
tirrimd on iboin, as it ii rootinj that would  
be prejudicial.  
iJd. The whole swamp from the road from  
Mtulry&#x27;s liridire up to the l.mo leading lo  
the new lir.ru, is to he pot into (he best and  
most complete order for sowing grass seeds  
in August, or at the furtheresi, by the mid­  
dle of September. The lowest and wet­  
test part thereof is to be sown wit&#x27;i tiin.  
othy seed alone. All the oilier pans are to  
he sown with timolliy and clover seeds mix­  
ed the swamp on the other side of the  
aforesa&#x27;d lane (now in corn and oats) is to  
be kept in the best possible order, that the  
pait not already sown v.ith:oass se.eih way  
receive them either ibis autumn (:;s so ei  
as the corn can be e.kcn elf with safely) or  
in the spring as circumstances shall dictate.  
No exertions or pains are to lie spared r,t  
Dague run to get the swamp from Mauley&#x27;s  
j bridge up to the incid.nv and the two en­  
closures in the mill swamp, in the highest  
I order for grass, to be sown in t-c time and  
! in inner above mentioned. But that no more  
I may be attempted than can be executed  
j well, proceed with the IMiowiug order wilh  
them ;ieeirli:i:&#x27;ly as tioi weather i.nv h  
pen tn he, fur thi-i must t o cnn-nlleil, as  
will answer tn work in Hie I nv p uis l.e-l,  
whilst the highest grounds may l.-o worked  
at any time :  
1st. Begin wit&#x27;i the swanm nt Mauley&#x27;s  
bruise upwards, and get all that is not al­  
ready in graf, well prepared for it, and in­  
deed sown. !!d. Th.it part of (lie meadow  
on the mill run, which lie; bet-vien th,; old  
lied of it and ihe raee, mid within the fen-e.cs  
lid. After this dune take that part of  
pen to lie. lor tln.i must lie con-nil  
tht! enclosure nljove, ( which was 111 corn  
last year) lying between the ditch and fence j  
.o. 1, up ami rinwn to cross teiices. -1 1 11.  
Thou go over the diieh and prepare slipe  
after slipc, as the ditch, runs Irem one cross  
fence to the other; and conlinue to i.i  
this us long as the season will hp good,  
or the seed can be sown with propriety mid  
safely.  
I conceive that the only way to r;et these.  
oioiitiiis in gnoii tinier wilh cxpiibtinii, is  
to ivg tlmiu ono  
plowing., anil then  
nigs, can netier decided by experi­  
ments on the spot than by reasor.&#x27;iig on  
it at a distance. My desire is that the  
ground should he made perfectly cle-n:, and  
laid down smooth ; without which meadows  
will always be foul, much grass !Ht in them  
and many scy lliea broken in cutting what is  
tskeu ell&#x27;.  
1th. The buckwheat which has been  
sown for manure ought to be plowed in the  
.... .. , .  
inomoiiient a siilhcie!i&quot;y ul fcetj is ripe to  
J 1  
stock the ground a second time; otherwise  
so far from answering the purpose of man­  
ure, it will become an ehaus!er. For this  
reason, if the plows belonging to the firm  
are unable to turn it in time, those of Mud-  
dy hole, Dague run, and I.&#x27;uion farm must  
Combine lo do it the work to he repaid by  
tho farm which receives the benefit s .iou  
as the work is accomplished thereat.  
&quot;. Where clover and timothy seeds are  
mixed and sown together, allow five pints of  
the first and three of the latter to the acre ;  
and where timothy only is sown, allow four  
quarts to the acre. Let the seed Le mea­  
sured in tho proportions here allotted, nnd  
put into a half bushel filled will) sand or  
dry earth, and extremely well mixed togeth­  
er in your own presence or l y yourself,  
which will answer two good purposes, viz :  
1st, to prevent limit for seeds ihus mixed  
would not sill ; affd Mildly llit; seedsman  
being accustomed to sow a bushel of wheat  
to the acre, would be at a loss to ct t a  
bushel of this or anything else regularly on  
that quantity of ground.  
It is expected you will begin to sow  
wheat early m August, and in ground per­  
fectly clean and well-plowed. I would have  
and do accordingly direct, that not less than  
five pecks of seed be sown on each acre.  
The plan of the farm over which vou look  
. .. t l - r. t - i i  
tel. . ol each held may be known. And it  
is mi, iiiiiiL-i tiin mai every waicu  
and the best attention may be given to see  
that this quantity is actually put in; furl  
have pretty strong suspicions (but this ought  
not to be hinted to them) that the seeds­  
men help themselves lo a pretty large toll.  
7th. As soon as you have done sowino­  
and even before, if it can bo done couven&quot;  
ieutly, you are to set heartily about thresh­  
ing or treading out the wheat ; and us fast  
as it is got nut to have it delivered at the  
mill or elsewhere, according to directions.  
The longer this business is delayed ths  
more waste mid embezzlement will there  
be of the crop. The wheat is to ,(! well  
cleaned ; the chaff and light wheat are prop,  
erly taken euro ol for the horses or oilier  
stock, and the straw stacked and secured  
as it ought lo be against tho weather and  
other injuries : and until the whole be de­  
livered, it will require your constant and  
close attention .  
fth. The oats at tho farm you overlook are, I  
preaiiuie ul! cut ; in that case let all the cradles,  
and scythes and rakes which you have received  
be delivered over lo iho Mansion House : or if  
you choose to keep them against next harvest,  
you must be responsiblo for them yourself.  
!th. The presumption is, also that the flax ul­  
so is, ere this pulled ; let it be well secured and  
at a proper season stripped of its seed ami spread  
to rut. During this opeiation lot it be often  
turned and examined that it may not be over-,  
done, or receive injury in any other respect by  
laying out too long.  
Gut the cleanest and best wheat for seed and  
that which is freest from onions. I would have  
about ono third of my whole crop sown wilh tho  
common wheat; one third with tho white; nml  
the other third with the jellow-bcartled wheat.  
The overseers (with Pavy, ns he knows the state  
  
of his own firm am tlC quality of wheat which  
grows upon it) nv ru,ot and decide among  
themselves, whother it would be best to have  
some of each of these sails on every firm; or, in  
order more effectually to prevent mixture, to  
have one sort only on a farm. In the latter case  
the cutting 0ftlmt KtAi ripens first, and bo on  
must be accoiniili,u,i hv the force of all the  
  
firms, instead of each doing its own work. If  
the seed on one f,,rm was to be sown on anoth­  
er, espaeially iviii-ii grew on a light soil  
was to he sown on a slilf one, and that which  
grew on a stiff one sown on a light ground, ad­  
vantages would unquestionably result Ironi it.  
1 Uli. The potatoes ct tlie inan aon house must  
bo worked by the plows from Union farm and  
when this is required it wiild bo be.-t, I con­  
ceive, to accomplish the work in a day.  
Dtli. It is expscteJ tint the fences will be  
made secure, an. no damage permitted within  
thorn by creaturosof uiry kind, or belonging to  
any body mine more than any others.  
13th. The gre.nqpt attention is to be paid to  
stocks of all liinia&#x27;on t!i a fanes ; and the most  
that can 1.; wi ,,f their manure or litter.  
They an; to be rcijuN regularly, that no false  
reports xoiN benujj-j; and missing inos, if an

GE.TTT.nME.v : It being indispensably tic j &#x27;  
* ces&lt;nrythnt I should have some pursuit all  
Mount Vernon through whom I can com-&#x27; &#x27;  
j tnuuicatc my orders, who will see that those &#x27; &#x27;  
orders arc execute I, or, if not obeyed, who !  
will inform me why they arc not ; who will &#x27;  
receive the weekly reports and transmit &#x27;  
them, receive money and pay it ; and in j !  
general to do those things which do n &gt;t ap-: &#x27;  
pertain to any individual overseer, I have I &#x27;  
sent my nephew, Mr. Howell Lewis, (who j &#x27;  
lives with inc here,) to attend to them until j  
) can provide a manager of established re &#x27;  
putntion in these matters. You will, there- &#x27;  
lore, pay due irgnrd to such directions as ?  
voti may receive from him, considering thein 1  
as coming immediately from inysdfi Hut ;  
that you a&#x27;s&lt;&gt; may have a general knowledge s  
of what I expect from you, I shall co ivey &#x27;  
the following view which I have ol&#x27;tlie bustI&#x27;css  
committed to your charge, as it appears  
to mo, and direct you to govern yourself by f  
it, as 1 am persuaded nothing inconsistent 1  
&lt; therewith will bo ordered by Mr. Lewis; &#x27;  
without authority from me to depart from it. &#x27;  
t 1st. Although it is almost needless to rcmatk j &#x27;  
that the corn ground at the larni vou over- &#x27;  
K look ought to he kept clean and well plough-&#x27; &#x27;  
ed, yet, hecanse not only the goodness ol i f  
that crop depends upon such management.; I  
but also the wheat crop which ts to succeed i f  
it. I cannot forbear urging the propriety and [ J  
ncccsity of the measure m very strong terms. ; 1  
  
2d. The wheat is l&lt;&gt; l&gt;c g??t into the bartis  
or into stacks as soon as it can be clone with r  
any sort of convenience, that it may not I  
# (especially wheat, which is subject to injure I  
by bul weather) sustain loss in shocks; and :  
* because the shattetc I grain in fields may he  
beneficial to the stock ; hut no hogs are to he I  
out on stJibhle.fields in which grass seeds &lt;  
  
were sown last fall, winter, or spring ; oilier &lt;  
stock, however, may be turned on ilium, as i  
it is rooting that would be prejudicial.  
4d. The whole swamp, from the road i  
from Manlcv\s bridge up to the lane leading i  
to ihc new barn, is to l?; got into lite best I  
and most complete order for sowing grass I  
u seeds in August, or, at the furthest, by the i  
L middle of September. The lowest and i  
W wettest parts are to be sown with timothy I  
seed alone. All the other parts are to be  
  
;&lt;&gt;\vn in timothy and clover mixed. The  
:\vainf&gt; on the other side of the aforesaid  
ar.c (now in corn and oats) is to be kept in  
he best possible order, that the part not al oady  
sown With pass seeds may receive  
hem either this autumn (as soon as the  
torn &#x27;-an be taken off* with safety) or in the  
spring, as cirenms&#x27;ances shall dictate.  
No exettions or pains arc to be spared at  
Dagoe run to gel the swamp from Mauley&#x27;s  
iridge up to the meadow above, and the  
wo enclosures iu the mill swamp, in the  
ugliest order for grass, to be sown in tlie  
imc and manner above mentioned , but,  
bat no more tnav be attempted than can be  
xecutcd well, proceed in the following offer  
with them, accordingly as the weather  
nay ha; pen to be ; f ?r this must be consult­  
  
: I, wlnl&gt;i ilic !i glicr grounds urn be wukni  
it any tunc.  
1st Ij.-gin with the swamp from Manny&#x27;s  
bridge upwards, and get all that is riot  
t&#x27;tvady in grass well prepared for it, and inland  
sown. 2d. That part of the low uiead?w  
on the.tyiii.i&#x27;U# winch lies between tlie  
?ld l&gt;ed of h and the rare atid within the  
enres. 3d. Alter this is done, take that  
art of enclosure above (which was in corn  
nst yeai) lying between the ditch and fence  
V?. |, tip and down to cross fence 4th.?  
Then go over the ditch, and prepare slipe  
ifter slipe as the ditch runs from one cross  
nee to the other, and continue to do this as  
org as the season wi&#x27;l be good or the seed  
an ho sown with propriety and safely.  
1 conceive that the only way to gel these  
[rounds in good order and with expedition  
s to give tin in one good ploughing and then  
o tear thmii to pieces with heavy harrows  
iVheth r it be necessary to cut dow n and  
ake o|] the tveeds previous to these workI...

% 14 I I ??U 1.1.1 &lt;??\*?? WV-.lv .  
lie spot than bv reasoning?in it at a d.stance.  
VIv desire is tJ.at the ground shall be made  
C  
lean and laid down smooth ; without which  
neadnws alwavs will he lotjI with grass h it  
n them, and inaiiv seethes broken in cutting  
a hat is taken oft*  
&#x27;ldi. The buckwheat which has been  
own f&lt;&gt;r ma ure might to be |?l??n??li? tl in  
he moment a sufficiency of seed are ripe to  
lock the ground the second time; other\isr.  
so far from its answering lie purpose  
&gt;1 manure, it will become an exhauster.?  
Mr tliis reason, if the ploughs belonging to  
he farm are unab&#x27;e to turn it in lime, tlmse  
if Muddy hole, Dague run, and LTui &lt;n farm  
nust combine to do it, the work to lie repaid  
&gt;y the farm which receives the benefit as  
icon as the work is accomplished thereat.  
G:!i. It ts expected you will begin to sow  
vlieal early in August, and in ground perecllv  
clean and well ploughed. 1 would  
tave, and do accord.ng!v direct, that not less  
&lt;- i-. ? ... . r *i i.. . ... ..  
  
ilUll live nt:r;v&gt; hi auru .? . .. ....  
i err. The plan of I lie farm over which  
mi I ? ?!; is jjivm to Mr. Lewis, from whicli  
he (&#x27;&#x27;intents of em it lie.&#x27;d may lie known,?  
^imI it is my express direction thai every  
vateli ami the best attcnii -n may be uivim  
0 see &#x27;hat this (j inntity actually is put in ;  
or I have strong suspicions (hut this ought  
lot to lie hinted to them) that the seedsmen  
irlp themselves to a pretty largo l??M.  
7lh. As so ui as Voii have d eie sowing,  
ni l even before, if .1 can he done coiivcmrntly.you  
are to s&lt; t heartily ahout threshing  
&gt;r treading the wheat, and as fast as it is out  
nit to have it delivered at the null or elsewhere,  
according to d ructions. The longer  
his business is delavrd the more waste ami  
MiihrzzaMTient there will lie of tiie cr ip-1  
he wheat is to lie well cleaned, the ehalf  
ind iitwlit wheat are to lie well taken care of  
or lli&quot; h &gt;r?&lt;:s or other stock, and the straw  
stacked and secured as it ought to he against  
ivealher and other injures ; an I, until the  
whole lie delivered, it will require your  
tonstant and close attention.  
8th. The oats at the firm you over!.ink  
ire, 1 pivs ime, all cut. In that case, let all  
;ev!h:s, and era lies, and rakes which you  
iave received lie delivered over to the man I..i?  
I, ...?i,r if vim &lt;&#x27;!i lose to keen them  
  
ijrtiiH next harvest, you must b: responside  
for them yourself.  
9. Thepresumption :*!-?&#x27;? is, lint the fiix  
ft; this is pulled. l/.&#x27;t it I)&#x27; well secured,  
i.ul at a proper season stripped o| its  
&gt;:ed and spread I rot. Daring ties ojiera,ion  
let it lie often turneil and examined,  
hat it he not over done or receive injury in  
my other respect hy l\ in?j out too lonj*.  
10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat f &gt;r  
iced, and that winch is freest from onions.  
I would have about otic-third of my whole  
:rop sown with I lie common wheat ; one.bird  
with the white ; and the oth r third  
villi the vellow bearded wheal. The overtec  
s (with Davy, as he knows the state of  
lis ow n farm and the (jiia&#x27;ilyol wheat which  
Iiows upon it) may meet and decide among  
lietnselves whether it would he host to have  
ionic of each of the sorts on every farm; or,  
n order more clVecluaHy to prevent mixture,  
o have one sort only on a farm. In the  
alter ease, the culling of that which tipeiis  
irsl.and so on, uiiiM he accomplished l&gt;v all  
he farms instead ol each doing its own  
votk. If the seed on one farm was to he  
town on another, especially il seed winch  
irew on a liyhl soil was ?&gt; he sown on a  
ttilf one, and that which &quot;few on a still One  
  
sown on a Ii?21 it ground, advantages wonlil  
inqticsltonnlily result from it.  
12th. The potatoes at tin: mnnsidh house  
nusl lie worked l?y the ploughs from Union  
arm. and. when th:s is refpiireil, it would he  
jest, i conceive, to accomplish the work in  
i day.  
12th. It is expected that the fences will  
&gt;e made serine, and no damage permitted  
ivithm iliem hv any creatures of any kind,  
ir belonging to any body?mine any more  
:han others.  
13th. The greatest attention is to he paid  
lo storks of all kinds on the farms; and the  
most that can he made of their manure and  
litter. They ate to he counted regularly,  
that no false report may he made ; and missing  
ones, if any, hunted for until found; or  
the manner of their going can he accounted  
, . DO  
for satisfactorily.  
Hlh. A weekly report, as usual, is to he  
  
handed to Mr. Lewis. In this report, that I  
may know how the work goes on, mention  
when yon begin to pi nigh, hoe, or otherwise ^  
work in a field, and when that field is finish- 1  
cd. The increase, decrease, and changes to  
be noted as heretofore?and let me ask:  
15th. Why arc the corn harrows thrown  
aside, or so little used that I rarely of late  
see or hear of their being at work 1 have jj  
been rim to very considerable expense in  
providing these and other implements for  
my farms; and, to my great mortification  
and injury, find, generally speaking, that  
wherever they wete last used there they tc- ^  
main, if not stolen, til! required again ; by ^  
wliieli means tliov, as well as the earls, re- j  
reive so much injury from the wet weather ^  
and the heat of the sun as to he unfit lor use;  
to repair or supply the place of which with ^  
  
new ours my carpenters (who ought 10 uc i |  
otherwise citi[&gt;l&lt;&gt;yc&lt;l) arc continually occu- I  
pied in tlie-.e jobs. Harrows, alter t!u: ! J  
ground is well broken, would rcitniulv weed ! j  
and keep the corn clean willi moio case  
than flie pimglisn I hope, therefore, they (  
will be used. And it is my express orders j  
that the greatest rare should be taken of the |  
tools of every kind, earts. and plantation im- ,  
j plemcnls, in fiirurc; for i ran no longer  
| submit to the losses I am continually sus- &#x27;  
j mining by neglect.  
IGtli. There is nothing I more ardently  
I desire, nor indeed is there any more esscn. &quot;  
I tial to my perinanent interest, than the ratsI  
irtg of live fences on proper ditches or hanks; j  
j yet nothing lias ever been, in a general way,  
more sham; fully neglected 11 mismanaged; ,,  
for. instead of preparing the ground properly j&#x27;  
for the reception of the seed, and weeding

ground, and arc suffered to l&gt;o smothered hy  
J the weeds and grass if they do conic up, hy  
j which means the expense I have hoen at in .  
! purchasing and sending the seeds, (genera&#x27;lv  
! from Philadelphia,) together with the Iahor, .  
&#x27; siifli as it is. that has ho??n inciiired, is not .  
I only Tost, hut (and is of infinitely more in:­  
portance to me) season after season passes ,  
away and I atri as far from the accomplish

that all the seeds which have hoen sown or ,  
! planted on the h inks o: the ditches should  
: lie properly attended to, and the deficient ,  
; spots made good, if you have or rati obtain  
i the moans I or doing it.  
17. There is one thing I must caution voti  
against, (without knowing whether there he  
! cause to charge you with it or not,) and that ..  
! is, not to retain any of my negroes who are ^  
i able and tit to work in the nop, in or about  
| your own house for your own purposes.  
  
j This I do m&gt;i allow any overseer lodo. a .

| complete order for sowing grass seedsin August,  
| Or, at the farthest, by the middle of September.  
|The lowest and wettest part thereof is to be  
| Sown with umothy seed alone. Ail the other  
| Parts of it are to be sown with timothy and clo-  
| Yer seeds mixed. The swamp on the other side  
of the aforesaid lane (now in corn and oats) is to  
be kept in the best possible order, that the part  
| hot already sown with grass seeds may receive  
| them this autumn (as soon as the corn ean be  
| taken off with safety) or in the sping, as circum-  
| stances sha!! dictate.  
No exertions or pains are to be spared at  
| Dogue run to get the swamp from Manley’s  
bridge up to the meadow above, and the two en-  
closures in the mill swamp, in the highest order  
for grass, tc be sown in the time and manner  
above mentioned; but, that no more may be at-  
pee than can be excuted well, proceed in  
| the following order with them, according ag the  
|  
&#x27;  
  
weather may happen to be; for this must be con-  
sulted, asdry weather will answer to work in  
the low paris best, whilst the higher grounds  
may be worked at any time.  
  
Ist. Begin with the swamp from Manley’s  
  
| part of the low meadow on the mill ran which  
| hes between the old bed of it and the race and  
| within the fences. 3d. After this is done, take |  
| that part of enclosure above (which was in corn  
| last year) lying between the ditch and fence No. |  
| 1, up and down to cross fences. 4th. Then go  
j over the ditch, and prepare slipe after slipe as |  
the ditch runs from the one cross fence to the  
other, and continue to do this as long as the sea-  
son will be good or thé seed can ‘be sown with  
propriety and safety. ~ |  
| | conceive thatthe ouly way to get these |  
| grounds in good order and with expedition is to |  
| give them one good ploughing and then to tear |  
| them to pieces with heavy barrows. Whether }  
it be necessary to ent down and take off the |  
weeds previous to these workings can be decid- |  
ed better by experiments on the spot than hx  
reasouing Ovi. tae perfectly clean, and  
laid down smooth, without which meadows will  
always-be foul, much grass left io. them, mee  
ny 8, bro: i ‘ting what is .taken  
Te ee i ean —  
4th. The buckwheat which has been sown for  
manure ought to be ploughed in the moment a  
sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the ground a  
second time; otherwise, so far from its answer-  
ing the purpose of manure, it will become an |  
exbauster. For this reason, if the ploughs be- |  
longing to the farm are unable to turn it in time,  
those of Maddy hole, Dogue ran, and Unien  
farm must combine to do it, the work to be re- |  
paid by the farm which receives the benefit as  
soon as the work is accomplished thereat. |  
5th. Where clover and timothy seeds are mix- |  
ed and sown together, allow five pints of the first |  
and three of the latter to the acre; and where |  
timothy only is sown, allow four quarts to the  
acre. Let the seed be measured in the propor- |  
tions here allotted, and put into a half bushel, |  
and the half bushel filled with sand or dry earth, |  
and extremely well mixed together in your own |  
presence, or by yourself, which will answer two |  
good purposes, viz: Lst, lo prevent theft, for seeds  
thus maxed would not scll; and, 2dly, the seeds-  
man deing accustomed to sow a bushel of wheat |

of ihis or any thiog else regularly on that quan- |  
uty of ground,  
6th. It is expected you will begin to sow |  
wheat early in August, and in ground perfectly |  
clean and well ploughed. I would have, and |  
do accordingly direct, that not less than five |  
pecks of seed be sown on each acre. ‘Che plan |  
of the farm over which vou look is given to Mr.  
Lewis, from which the contents of each field |  
may be known. And it is my express direction  
that every watch and the best attention may be  
given to see that this quantity actually is |  
put in; for I have strong suspicions (but this |  
ought not to be hinted to them) that the seedsmen  
help themselves to a pretty large toll.  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing, and  
even before, if it can be done conveniently, yon  
are to set heartily about threshing or treading  
the wheat, and as fast as it is got out to have it  
delivered at the mill or elsewhere, according to  
directions. The longer this husiness is delayed,  
the more waste and embezzlement will there be  
of the crop. ‘The wheat is to be well cleaned,  
the chaff and light wheat are to be properly  
taken care of for the horses and other stock, |  
and the straw stacked and secured as it  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
and, until the whole be delivered, it will re- |  
quire your constant and close attention,  
  
8th. The oats at the farm you overlook are,  
I presume alicut. In that case, let all scythes,  
and cradles, and rakes which you have received |  
be delivered over to the mansion house; or,  
if you choose to keep them against next har- |  
vest, you must be responsible for them yourself. |  
th, ‘The presumption also is, that the flax is |  
ere this pulled. Let it be well secured, and at  
a proper season stripped of its seed and spread |  
to ret. During this operation let it he often |  
turned and examined, that it be not overdone or |  
receive injury in any other respect by lying out)

would have about one-third of my whole crop)  
  
|  
  
sown with the common wheat; one-third with |  
the white wheat ; and the other third with the |  
yellow bearded wheat. The overseers (with |  
Davy, as he knows the state of his own farm |  
and the quality of wheat which grows upon it) |  
may meet and decide among themselves wheth-  
er it would be best to have some of each of these  
sorts on every farm ; or, in order more effectual-  
ly to prevent mixture, to have one sort only on a  
farm. In the latier case, the catting of that  
which ripens first, and so on, must be accom-  
plished by the force of all the farms instead of  
each doing his own work. If the seed on one  
faim was to be sown ou another, especially if  
  
peads upon such management, butalsothe wheat  
propriety and necessity of ihe measuie

into stacks as soon as it can be done with any  
sort of convenience, that it may not (especially  
wheat, which is subject to injary by bad weather)  
sustain loss in shocks; and because the shatter-  
ed grain in fields may be beneficial to the stock;  
but no hogs are to be puton stubble fields in  
which grass seeds were sown last fall, winter,

-} ton When you begin to plough, boe, or otherwise  
Work in the field, and when that field is tnished,  
- | The increase, decrease, und change to be noted  
  
as beretofore—and let me ask :  
  
15th. Why are the corn harrows thrown aside,  
or 80 little used, that I rarely of late see or hear of  
their being at work, | have been run to very con-  
siderable expense in Providing these and other  
implements for my farms; and, to my great mor-  
“ication and injary, find generally speaking,  
that wherever they were last used thy remain,  
HW not stolen, till required again; by which means  
they, as well as the earts, receive so much jojury  
fromthe wet weather and the heat ot the sun as  
to be unfit for use; to repair or supply the place  
of which with new ones my carpenters (who  
e employed) are continually  
jobs. Harrows, after the  
n, would certainly weed and  
| Keep the corn clean with more ease than the  
| ploughs, I hope, therefore, they will be used.  
And it is my express oders that the greatest  
care be taken of the tools of every kind, carts,  
| and plantation implements, in future; for 1 ean  
| no longer submit to the losses | am continually  
| Sustaining by neglect.  
  
16th. There is nothing | more ardently de-  
Sire, nor indeed is there any more essential to  
‘by permanent interest than the tuising of live  
fences on proper ditches or banks; yet nothing  
has ever been, in a general way, more shame-  
fully neglected or mismanaged ; for, instead of  
Preparing the ground for the reception of the  
seed, and weeding and keeping the plants clean  
after they come up, the seeds are hardly seratch-  
ed into the ground, and are suffered to be smoth-  
ered by the weeds and grass if they do come  
up; by which means the expense I have been  
| atin purchasing and sending the seeds, (gene-  
j rally from Philadelphia.) together with the la- |  
| bor, such as it is that has been incurred, is not  
| only lost, but (and what is of more importance  
  
&#x27;o me) season after season passes away, and |  
  
| 4m) a8 far from the accomplishment of my object  
  
  
  
  
  
{  
  
I mention the matter thus fully to |  
  
have been sown or planted on the banks of ditch-  
es should be properly attended to, and the defi- |  
cient spots made good, if you have or can obtain  
the means for doing it.  
17th. There is one thing that I must caution  
you against, (without knowing whether there  
be cause to charge you with it or not,) and that  
is. not to retain any of my negroes who are able |  
  
and fit to work in the crop in or about your own  
| house for your own purposes. ‘  
  
This I do not al-  
low any overseer to do. A small boy or girl  
for the purpose of fetching wood or water, tend-  
ing @ child, or someesuch thing, I do not object  
to; but so soon as they are able to work out I  
expect to reap the benefit of their Jabor myself,  
18th. Though last mentioned it is not of the |  
leust importance, because +hepowu upon It, and {  
aoc ress SO TY interest and your own reputation  
Udo, therefore, in explicit terms, enjoin it upon |  
you to remain constantly at home, (unless called  
off by unavoidable business, or to attend Divine |  
worship.) and to be constantly with your people |  
when there. There is no other sure way of |  
getting work well done by negroes; for when |  
an overseer’s back is turned, the most of them  
will slight their work or be idle altogether, in |  
which case correction cannot retrieve either, but |  
it often produces evils which are worse than the  
disease. Nor 1s there any other mode than this  
to prevent thieving and other disorders, the con-  
sequence of opportunities. You will recollect  
that your time is paid for by me, and if I am de-  
prived of it, it is worse than the robbing of my  
purse, because it is a breach of trust, which any  
honest man ought to hold most sacred. You  
have found me, and you will continue to find me, |  
faithful to my part of the agreement which was |  
made with you, whilst you are attentive to your |  
part; but it is to be remembered that a breach  
on one side releases the obligation on the other. |  
If, therefore, it shall be proved to me that you |  
  
&#x27;

Genllemen. It being indispensably necessary that I  
should have some personat Moent Vernon, through w hom  
I can communic te my orders, who will see that those  
or i not eed  
me why they afe not; who will receive the weekly re­  
ports and transmit them; receive money ande pay it;  
aid, in general.  
ilual overseer, I have sent my nephew  
Mr. Howell newis, (who lives with me here,) to attend  
then, until I cain provide a manager of established re­  
Yoe  
regard to such directions as you may receive from him,  
considering them as coming  
that von may have a general knowledge of what I  
expect from yoh, I shall convey the following view  
which I have of the business committed  to you charge,  
 and uiel you to govern yours  
it, as I am persualed nothing inconsistent therewith will  
be ordered by Mr. Lewis without authority from me to  
deparr from it.  
1st. Although it is almost needless to remark that the  
corn ground at the farm you overlook ought to kept clean  
and well ploughed, yet because not only the goodness  
of that crop depends upon such management, but also the  
wheat crop which is to succeed it, I cannot forbear urg  
fing the propriety and necessity of the measure in ver y  
strolg terins.  
2. The wheat is to be got into the barns or inte stacks  
as soon as it can be done with any sort of convenience,  
that it niay not, (especially wheat which is sub­  
ject to tnjury by bad weather,) sustain loss in shocks;  
and because the shattered grain in fields may be bene­  
ficial to the stock; but no hogs are to be put on stubble­  
fields in which grass seeds were sown last fall, winter  
 or sprink; other stock, however, may be turned on  
them, as it is rooting that would be prejudicial  
3d. The whole swamp, from the road from Manley&#x27;s  
bridge up to the lands leading to the new barp, is to be  
into the best and most complete order for sowing grass  
seeds in August, or at the furthest, by the middle of  
September. The lowest and wettest part thereof is to  
be sown with timotky seed alone. All the other partsof  
it are to be sown with timothy and clover seeds mixed.  
The swamp on the other side of the aforesaid lane (now  
in corn and eats) is to be kept in the best possible order,  
that the part not already sown with grass seeds may re­  
ve them this autunin (as soon as the corn can be taken  
off with safety) or in the spring, as circumstances shall  
dictate.  
No exertions of pains are to be spared at D gue run to  
get the swamp from Manley&#x27;s bridge to the meadows a­  
bove, and the two enchsures in the mill swawp, in the  
highest order for grass, to be sown in the time and manner  
above mentioned;but that no more may be aftemp&#x27;ed than  
can be executed well proceed in the follow ing order with  
them, according as the weather may happen to be; for  
this fhust be consulted, as the dry wntther will answer  
to work in the low parts best, whilst the higher grounds  
may be worked at any time:  
  
18t. Begin with the swamp from Manley&#x27;s bridge,  
and get all that is not already in grass well prepared for  
it, and indeed sown. 2. That part of the low meadow  
on the mill-run, which lies between the old bed of i  
the race and within the fences. 3d. After this is dore,  
take that part of the enclosure above ( which we in cor  
las! year) lying between the ditch and fence No. I, up  
nd down to cross fences. 4th. Then go over the ditch,  
a lle callp as the diich runs  
tence to the other, and continue tod  
season will be good or the seed can be sowdd with propri­  
ety and safety.  
I conceive that the only way to get these grounds in  
plougllitg a  
berrows. Whether it be necessary to cut down and  
take n the weeds previous to these workings can be de  
ing at a  
be made perlectly clean, and laid down smooth, without  
Which neadows will always be foul, much grass  
hem, and many scythes broken in cutting what is taken  
olf.  
4th. The buckeheat which has been swn for ma  
a sulliclency  
of seed is ripe to stock the ground a second time; other­  
wise, so far trom answering the purpse of manure, it  
will become an exhauster. For this reason, if the ploughs  
the larm are unable to turn it in time, those  
t ea  
ate be repad by the farm whichr­

ilow five pin&#x27;s of the first and three of  
the latter to the acte; and where timothy only iss

10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat for seed, and  
that which is freest from ontons. I would have about  
one-third of my whole crop sown with the common  
wheat; one-third with the white; and the other third  
th the vellow bearled wheat. The overseers (with  
Davy, as he knows the state of his own farm and the­  
quality of wheat which grows upon it) may meet and  
decide among themselves whether it would be best to  
nave some of each of these sorts on every farm; or, in  
order more effectuatly to prevent mixture, to have on­  
sort only on a farm. In the latter case, the cutting of  
that which ripens first, and so on, must be accomplished  
by the force of ell the farms instead of each doing its work.  
if the seed on one farm was to be sown on another, es  
pecially if seed which grew on a light soil was to be  
sown on a stiff one, and that which grew on a stiff one  
sown on a lightground, advantages would unquestionably  
result from it.  
11th. The potatoes at the mansion house must be  
worked by the ploughs from Union farm, and, when this  
is required,it would be best, I conceive, to accomplish the  
work in a day.  
12th. It is expected that the fences will be made se­  
cure, and no damage permitted within them by creatures  
of any kind, or belonging to any body--mine any more  
than others..  
13th. The greatest attention is to be paid to stocks of  
of all kinds on the farms, and the most that can, be male  
of the manure and litter. They are to be counted regu­  
tarly, that no false reports may be made; and missing­  
onesg if any, hupted for until found, or the manner of  
their going can be accounted for satisfactorily.  
I 4th. A weckly report, as usual, is to be handed to  
Mr. Lewis. In this report, that I may know better how  
the work goes on, mention when you begin to plough  
boe, or otherwise work in a field, and when the field is  
sinished. The increase, and changes to be noted as here­  
oforeand let me ask;  
15th. Why are the corn harrows thrown aside, or so  
that I rarely of late see or hear of thety being  
at work? I have been run to a considerable expense&#x27;in  
providing these and other implements for my farms, and  
to my great mortification and injury, find, generally  
speaking, that wherever they were last used they re­  
main, if not, stolen, till required again; by which means  
they, as well as the carts, receive so much injury from  
the wet weather and the heat of the sun as to be unfit  
for use; to repair or supply the place of which with new  
my carpenters (who ought to be otherwise employ­  
ed) are continually occupied in these jbs. Harrows,  
after the ground is well broken, would certainly weed and  
seep the corn clean with more ease than the ploughs. I  
hope, therefore, they will be used. And it is my express  
orders that the greajest care be taken off the tools of  
every aind, carts and planration implements, in future;  
can no senger subthit to the losses I am continually  
sustaining by neglect.I  
16th. There is lothing I more ardently desire, nor  
indeed is there any more essential to my permanent inter­  
est than the raising of live fences on proper ditches of  
banks; yet nothing has ever bean, in a general way  
more shamefully neglected or mismanaged; for  
of praparing the ground for the reception of the seed, and  
weeding and keeping the plants clean after they come up,  
the seeds are hardly scratched into the ground, and are  
suffered to be smothered by the weeds and grass if they  
come up; by which means the expense I have been at  
in purchasing and sending the seeds, (generally from  
Philadelphia,) together with the labor, such as it is, that  
has been incurred, is not only lost, but (and which is of  
more importance to me) season after season passes away  
and I am as far from the accomplishment of my objec  
as ever. I mention the matter thus fully to show liow  
  
anxious I am that all the seeds, which have been sown  
or planted on the banks of the ditches, should be properly  
auended to, and the deficient spots made good, if you  
have or can obtain the means for doingit.  
17th. There is one thing that I most caution you a­  
gainst, (without knowing whether there be cause to  
charge you with it or not,) and that is, hot so retain any  
of my negroes, who are able and fit to work in the crop,  
in or about your own purposes. This I do not allow any  
overseer to do. A small boy or girl for the purpose of  
fetching wood or water, tending a child, of some such  
thing, I do not olqect to; but so soon as they are able to  
  
worl out I expect to reap the benefits of their labor lny-  
18th. Though last mentioned, it is not of the least  
importance, because the peace and good government of  
the negroes depend upon it, and not less so my interest  
and your own reputation. I do, therefore, in explicit  
you to remain constantly at home,  
funless called off by unavoidable business, or to attend

“I7th. There is one thing that I must caution  
you against, (withont knowing whether there be  
cause to charge you with it or not,) and that is  
not to retain any of my negroes who are able and  
fitto work in the crop’in or abont your own house  
for your own purposes. This Ido not allow any  
overseer to do. A small boy or girl for the Knr­  
pose of fetching wood or waler, tending a child,  
or some such thinﬁ. Ido not ob{&#x27;oc! to; but so  
soon as they are able to work out expect to reap  
the benefit of their labor myself.  
IlBth. Though last mentioned itis not of the  
least importance, because the peace and po:d&#x27;ov­  
ernment of the negroes depend upon it, and not  
less omy interest und your own reputation. I  
do, u.ml{m. in explicit ter:ns. enf.i.n it upon you  
to remain constantly at home, (unless called ot by  
unavoidable business, or to attend Divine wor­  
*hip,) and 10 be constantly with your poorlc when  
there. There is no other sure way ol getting  
work well done by n‘gmu: for when an over­  
seer&#x27;s back is turned, the most of thewn will slight  
their work or be idle nltogether, in which case  
correction cannot retrieve either, but ofien pro­  
duces evils which are worse than the disease

Gentlemen: It being indispensably neces­  
sary that I should have some person at Mount  
Verjpoii through whom I can communicate my&#x27;  
orders, who will see that those orders are ex­  
ecuted, or, if not obeyed, who inform me why  
they are not; who will receive the weekly re­  
ports, and trasmit them; receive money and pay  
it; and in general to do those things which do  
not appertain to any individual overseer, I have  
bent my nephew, Mr. Howell Lewis, (who lives?,  
with me hère.) to attend to them until I can pro-*  
vide a manager of established reputation in  
these matters. You will, therefore, pay due  
^d to such directions as you may receive  
from . h &#x27;?&#x27; con3 &#x27; der &#x27;- n fe&#x27; as comtng tmme­  
diately from myself. But that you may have  
a&quot; general knowledge of what I expect from  
you, I shall convey the following views which I  
have of the business committed to your charge,  
as it appears to me, and direct you to govern  
yourself by it, asl am persuaded nothing in­  
consistent therewith will be ordered by Mr. ?  
Lewis witho«» authority from me to depart fromj  
1st Although it is almost needlees to remark  
that the-com ground at the farm you overlook  
ought to be kept clean and well ploughed, yet,  
because not only the goodness of that crop de­  
pends upon such management, bnt also ~ the  
wheat crop which is tosueceed it, I cannot for­  
bear urging the propriety and necessity of the  
measure in very strong terms.  
2d. The wheat is to be got into the bams or  
into stacks as soon as it can be done with any  
sort of convenience, that jt may not (especially  
wheat, whieh is subject to injury by had wea­  
ther) sustain loss in shocks; and because the  
shattered grain in fields may be beneficial to the  
stock; but no hogs are to be put on stubble­  
fields in which grass aeeds were sown laat fell,  
winter, or spring; other stock, however, may be  
turned on them, as it is rooting that would be  
prejudical.  
3d. The whole swamp, from the road from  
Manley&#x27;s bridge up to the lane leading to the  
new barn, is to be got into the bèst and most  
complete order for sowing, grass seeds in Au­  
gust or, at the farthest, by the middle of Sep­  
tember.. The lowest and wettest part thereof  
is to be sown with timothy seed alone. AS  
the other parts ofit are to be sown with timothy  
and clover seeds mixed. The swamp on the  
other side of the aforesaid lane) now in corn  
arid oats) is to be kept in the best possible or­  
der, that the put not already sown with pass  
seeds may receive them either this ^autumn (as  
soon as the corn can be taken off with safety)  
or in the spring^ aa circuumstances shall dic­  
tate. &quot; r &#x27;&quot;&#x27;  
No exertions or pains are to be spared at  
Dague run to get the swamp from Manley&#x27;s  
bridge up to the meadow above» and the two  
enclosures in the mill swamp, in the highest  
order for grass, to be sown in the time. dec. aa  
above mentioned; but, that no more may be at*  
mpted than can be executed well, proceed i

ptea than can be executed wen, proceed in  
follo wing order with them, accordingly m J  
weather may happen to be; for this mnst be  
the weather  
consulted, as dry weather will answer to work  
in the low parts best, whilst the higher grounds  
may be worked at any time.  
1st. Begin with the swamp from Manley&#x27;s  
bridge upwards, and get all that is not already  
in grass well prepared for it,and indeed sown.  
3d. That part of the low meadow on the mill  
run which lies between the old bed of it and the  
race and within the fences. 3d. After this is  
done, take that part of the enclosure above  
(which was in corn last year) lying between the  
ditch and fence number 1, upand down to cross  
«ces. 4th. Then go over the ditch and pre­  
pare slipe after slipe as the ditch runs from the  
one cross fenae to the other, an) coatiboe to  
do this as long as the season will lw food or  
the seed can be sown with propriety ana safety.  
I eonceive that the only may to get these  
grounds in good order, aod with expedition, is  
to give them ooe good ploughing and then to  
  
tear them to pieces with heavy harrows. Whe­  
ther it be necessary to cut down and take off the  
weeds previous to these workings can be decid­  
ed better by experiments on the spot than by  
reasoning on it at a distance. My desire is that  
the ground shall be made perfectly clean, and  
laid down smooth; without which meadows will  
always be foul, much grass left in them, and  
many scythes broken in cutting what is taken  
off.  
4th. The buckwheat which has been sown  
for manure, oupht to be ploughed in the mo­  
ment a sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the  
ground a second time; otherwise, so far from  
its answering the purpose of manure, It will be­  
seed, and that which is freest from onions.  
come an exhauster. For this reason, if the  
ploughs belonging to the farm are unable to  
iurn it in time, those of Muddy hole, Dague run,  
TOnd Union farm must combine to do it, tho  
•work to be repaid by the farm which receiver  
the benefit as soon as the work is accomplished  
thereat.  
5th. Where clover ^nd timothy seeds are  
mixed and sown together, allow five pints of  
the first and three of the latter to the acre; and  
where-timothy only is sown allow four quarts  
to the acre. Let the seed be measured in the  
proportions here allotted, and put into a half  
bushel, and one half bnshel filled with sand or  
dry earth, and extremely well mixed together  
in your own presence or by yourself, which  
will answer two good purposes, namely: 1st, to  
prevent theft, for seeds thus mixed would not  
sell; and, &#x27;idly, the seedsman being accustomed  
to sow a bushel of wheat, to the acre, would be  
at no loss to cast a bushel of this or any thing  
else regularly on that quantity of ground.  
6th. It is expected that you will begin to  
sow wheat early in August, and in ground per­  
fectly clean ana well ploughed. I would have,  
and do accordingly direct, that not less than five  
pecks of seed be sown on each acre. The plan  
of the farm over which you look is given to Mr.  
Lewis, from which the contents of each field  
may be known. And it is my express direction  
that every watch and the best attention may be  
given to see that this quantity actually is put  
in; for I have strong suspicions (but this ought  
not to be hinted to them) that the seedsmen  
help themselves to a pretty large toll,  
7th. As soon as yon have done sowing, and  
even before, if it can be done conveniently, you  
are to set heartily about threshing or treading  
the wheat, and as fast as it is got out to have  
it delivered at the mill or elsewhere, according  
to directions. The longer this business is de­  
layed, the more waste and embezzlement cf the  
crop. The wheat is to be well cleaned, the  
chaff and light wheat are to be properly taken  
care of for the horses or other stock, und the  
straw stacked and secured as it ought to be  
against weather, and other injuries; and, until  
the whole be delivered, it will require your  
constant and dtose attention.  
8th. The oats àt the farm you oversee, are,  
I presume, all cut In that case, let the scythes  
and cradles and rakes jwhich you have received  
be delivered over to the mansion house; or, if  
you choose to keep them against next harvest,  
you must be responsible for them yourself!  
9th. The presumption also is, that the flax is  
ere this pulled. I «t it be well secured, and at  
a proper season stripped of its seeds and spread  
to rot. During this operation, let it be often  
turned andexamined, that it be not overdone or  
receive injury in any other respect by lying  
out to too long.  
10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat for  
I  
would have about one-third of my whole crop  
sown with the common wheat; one-third with  
the white; and the other th rd with the yellow  
bearded wheat The overseen, (with Davy,  
as he knows the state of his own fkrm and the  
quality of wheat which grows upon it) may  
meet and decide among themselves whether it  
would be best to have some of each of these  
sorts on every farm; or, in ordermore effectu­  
ally to prevent mixture, to have one sort only  
on a farm. In the latter case, the cutting of  
that which ripens first, and so on, must be ac­  
complished by the force of all the forms in­  
stead of each doing its own work. If the seed  
of one fkrm waa to be sown onanother, eape­  
pecially if seed which grew on a light soil was  
to be sown on a stiff one, and that which grew  
on a stiff one sown on a light ground, advan­  
tages would unquestionably result from it  
11th. The potatoes at the mansion-house  
must be worked by the ploughs from Union  
farai, and, when tlus is required it would be  
best, 1 conceive, to accomplish the work in a  
day.  
13th. It is expected that the fences will be  
made secure, and no damage permitted within  
them by creatures of any kind, or belonging to  
anybody, mine any more than others.  
ISth. The greatest attention is to be paid to  
ÜtoekB of all kinds on the farms; and the most  
to be made of their manure and litter. They  
are to be counted regularly, that no false re­  
rts may be made; and missing ones, if any,  
unted&#x27; for tthtil found, or the manner of their  
14th. A weekly report, as usual, is to bè  
handed to Mr. Iiewis. In this report, that I  
may know better bow the work goes on, men­  
tion When you begin to plough, hoe, or other­  
wise work In afield, and when that field is fin­  
ished. The increase, decrease, and chargea to  
be noted as heretofore—and let me ask:  
15tb . Why ^ ^ corn harrows thrown  
mdde, or so Uttle used that I rarely of late iee.  
0 , hear of their being at work? I have been  
gen­  
b -last  
run to very considerable expense in  
these and other implements for my farms;  
to ray great mortification and injjory, find,  
erally speaking, that wherever they were  
used they remain, if not stolen, till required  
again;by which means they, as well as tl}e carts,  
receive «o much injury from the wet weather  
and the heat of the sun «s to be unfit for use;  
to repair or supply the place of which with new  
ones my carpenters, who ought to be other­  
wise employed,»« continually occuped in these  
jobs. Harrows, after thcjjround is well bro­  
ken, would certainly weea and keep the com  
clean with more ease than the ploughs. i hope,  
therefore, they will bemused. And H is my ex­  
press orders that the greatest care be taken  
with the tools of every kind, carta, snd  
tion implements, in future; for I can no  
«cbmit to the losses i am continually  
ing by neglect.  
  
16th. Thjre is nothing I more ardently de­  
sire, nor indeed is there any more essential to  
uiy permament interest, than the raising of live  
fences on proper ditches or banks; yet nothing  
has ever been, in a general way, more shameful,  
ly neglected or mismanaged; for, instead of pre­  
paring the ground properly for the reception  
of seed, and weeding and keeping the plants  
clean after they come up, the seeds are hardly  
scratched into the ground, are suffered to be  
smothered by the weeds and grass if they do  
come up; by which means the expense I have  
i been at in purchasing and sending the seeds,  
I (generally from Philadelphia,) together with  
the labor,&quot;such as it is, that has been incurred,  
is not only lost, but (and which is of infinitely  
more importance to me) season after season  
passes away, and I am as far from the accom.  
plishment of my object as ever. I mention the  
matter thus fully to show how anxious I am  
that all the seeds which have been sown or  
planted on the banks of tqe ditches should be  
properly attended to, and the deficient spots  
made good, if you have or can obtain the means  
for doing it.  
17th. There is one thing I must caution you  
against, (without knowing whether there be  
cause to charge you with it or not,) and that is,  
not to retain any of my negroes who are able  
and fit to work in crop, in or about your own  
house for your swn purposes. This I do not  
allow any oversder to do. A small boy or girl,  
for the purpose of fetching wood or water, tend­  
a child, or some such thing, I do not object to;  
but, so soon as they are able to work out, I ex­  
pect to reap the benefit of their labor.  
18th. Though last mentioned, it is not of the  
least importance, because the peace and good  
government of the negroes depend upon it, and  
not1es8 so my interest and your own reputation.  
I do, therefore, in explicit terms, enjoin it upon  
you to remain constantly at home, (unless call­  
ed off by unavoidable business, or to attend  
Divine worship,) and to be constantly with  
your people when there. There is no other  
sure way of getting work well done and quiet­  
ly by negroes; for when an overseer&#x27;s back is  
turned the most of them will slight their work  
or be idle altogether, in which ease correction  
cannot retrieve either, but often produces evils  
which are worse than the disease. Nor is there  
any other mode than this to prevent thieving  
and other disorders, the consequence ot oppor­  
tunities. You will recollect that youmtime is  
paid for by me, and, if I am deprived or it, it is  
worse than the robbing of my purse, because it  
is also a breach of trust, which any honest man  
ought to hold most sacred. You have found  
me, and you will continue to find me, faithful  
to my part of the contract between us, an

Gentlemen-. It being indispensably neces­  
sary that 1 should have some person at Mount  
Vernon through whom I can communicate my  
orders, who will see that those orders are ex­  
ecuted, or. if not obeyed, who will inform me why  
they are not; who will receive the weekly re­  
ports, and transmit them; receive money and pay

not appertain to any individual overseer, I have  
sent my nephew, Mr. Howell Lewis, (who lives  
with me here,) to attend to them until I can pro­  
vide a manager of established reputation in  
these matters. You will, therefore, pay due  
regard to such directions as you may receive  
from him, considering them as coming imme­  
diately from myself. But that you may have  
a genera] knowledge of what I expect from  
yon, I shall convey the following views which I  
have of the business committed to your charge,  
as it appears to me, as I am pesuaded nothing  
consistent therewith will be ordered by Mr.  
Lewis without authority from mo to depart  
from it.  
1st. Although it is almost needless to remark  
that the corn ground at the farm you overlook  
ought to be kept clean and well ploughed, yet,  
because not only the goodness of that crop de­  
pends upon such management, but also the  
wheat crop which is to succeed it, I cannot for­  
bear urging the propriety and necessity of the  
measure in very strong terms.  
2d. The wheat is to be got into the barns or  
into stacks as soon as it can be done with  
any sort of convenience, that it may not (espe­  
cially wheat, which is subject to injury by bad  
weather) sustain loss in shocks; and because  
the shattered grain in fields may be beneficial  
to the stock; but no hogs are to beput on stub­  
blefields in which grass seeds were sown last  
fall, winter, or spring; other stock, however,  
may be turned on them, as it is rooting that  
would be prejudical.  
3. The whole swamp, from the road from  
Mauley&#x27;s bridge up to the lane leading to the  
new barn, is to be got into the best and most  
complete order for sowing grass seeds in August  
or at the furthest by the middle of Sep­  
tember. The lowest and wettest part thereof  
is to be sown with timothy seed alone. All  
the other parts of it are to be sown with timo­  
thy and clover seeds mixed. The swamp on  
the other side of the aforesaid lane) now in corn  
and oats) is to be kept in the best possible or­  
der, that the part not already sown with grass  
seeds may receive them either this autumn (as  
soon as the corn can be taken off with safety)  
or in the spring, as circumstances shall dic­  
tate.  
No exertions or pains arc to be spared at  
Dague run to get the swamp from Mauley&#x27;s  
bridge up to the meadow above, and the two  
enclosures in the mill swamp in the highest or­  
der for grass, to be sown in the time &amp;c. as  
above mentioned; but that 110 more may be at­  
tempted than can be executed well, proceed in  
the following order with them, accordingly as  
the weather may happen to be; for this must be  
consulted, as dry weather will answer to work  
in the low parts best, whilst the higher grounds  
may be worked at any time.  
1st. Begin with the swamp from Manley&#x27;s  
bridge upwards, and get all that is not already  
in grass well prepared for it, and indeed sown.  
2d. That part of the low meadow on the mill  
run which lies between theold bed ofitandthe  
race and within the fences. 3d. After this is  
done, take that part of the enclosure above  
(which was in corn last year) lying between the  
ditch and fence number 1, up and down to cross  
fences 4th. Then go over the ditch and pre­  
pare slipe after slipe as the ditch runs from the  
one cross fence to the other, and continue to  
do this as long as the season will be good or  
the seed can be sown with propriety and safety.  
I conceive that the only way to get these  
grounds in good order, and with expedit&#x27;on, is  
to give them one good ploughing jmd then to  
tear them to pieces with heavy harrows. Whe­  
ther it be necessary to cut down and take off  
the weeds previous to these workings can be  
decided better by experiments ori the spot than  
by reasoning on it at a distance. My desire is  
that the ground shall be made perfectly clean,  
and laid down smooth; without which meadows  
will always be foul, much grass left in them,  
and many scythes broken in cutting what is ta­  
ken off.  
4th. The buckwheat which has been sown  
for manure, ought to be ploughed in the mo­  
ment a sufficiency of seed is ripe to stock the  
ground a second time; otherwise, so far from  
its answering the purpose of manure, it will be­  
come an exhauster. For this reason, if the  
ploughs belonging to the farm arc unable to  
turn it in time, those of Muddy hole, Dague  
run, and Union farm must combine to do it, the  
work to be repaired by the farm which receives  
the benefit as soon as the work is accomplished  
thereat.

mixed and sown together, allow five pint» of  
tbe first and three of the latter to the acre; and

to the acre. Let the seed be measured in tbe  
proportions here allotted, and put into a half  
bushel, and one half bushel tilled with sand or  
dry earth, and extremely well mixed together  
in your own presence or by yourself, which  
will answer two good purposes, namely : 1st, to  
prevent theft, for seeds thus mixed would not  
sell; and, 2dly, the seedsman being accutomed  
to sow a bushel of wheat to the acre, would  
be at no loss to cast a bushel of this or any  
thing else regularly on that quantity of ground.  
6th. It is expected that you will begin to  
bow wheat early in August, and in ground per­  
fectly clean and well ploughed. I » ould have,  
and do accordingly direct, that not less than  
five pecks of seed be sown on each acre. The  
plan of the farm over which you look is given  
to Mr, Lewis, from which the contents of each  
field may be known. And it is ray express di­  
rection that every watch and the best attention  
may be given to see that this quantity actually  
is putin; for I have stong suspicions (but this  
ought not to be hinted to them) that the seeds­  
men help themselves to a pretty large toll.  
7th. As soon as you have done sowing, and  
even before, if it can be done conveniently, you  
are to set heartily about threshing or treading  
the wheat, and as fast as it is got out to have  
it delivered at the mill or elsewhere, according  
to directions. The longer this business is de.  
layed, the more waste and embezzlement of  
the crop. Tho wheat is to be well cleaned, the  
chaff and light wheat are to be properly taken  
care of for the horses or other stock, and the  
straw stacked and secured as it ought to be  
against weather and other injuries: and until  
the whole be delivered, it will require your con­  
stant and close attention.  
8th. The oats at the farm you oversee, are  
I presume, all cut. In that case, let the scythes  
and cradles and rakes which you have received  
be delivered over to the mansion house; or, if  
you choose to keep them against next harvest  
you must be reponsible for them yourself.  
9th. The presumption also is, that the flax is  
ere this pulled. Let it be well secured, and at  
a proper season stripped of its seeds and spread  
to rot. During this operation, let it be often  
turned and examined, that it be not overdone  
or receive injury in any other respect by lying  
out too long.  
10th. Get the cleanest and best wheat for  
seed, and that which is freest from onions. I  
would have about one-third of my whole crop  
sown with the common wheat; one-third with  
the white; and the other third with the yellow  
bearded wheat. The overseers, (with Davy,  
as he knows the state of hs own farm and the  
quality of wheat which grows upon it) may  
meet and decide among themselves whether it  
would be best to have some of each of these  
sorts on every farm; or, in order more effectu­  
ally to prevent mixture, to have one sort only  
on a farm. In the latter case the cutting of  
that which ripens first, and so on, must be ac­  
complished by the force of all the farms instead  
of each doing its own work. If the seed of  
one farm was to be sown on another, especial­  
ly if seed which grew on a light soil was to be  
sown on a stiff one, and that which grew on a  
stiff one sown on a light ground, advantages  
would unquestionably result from it.  
lltb. The potatoes at the mansion-house  
must be worked by the ploughs from Union  
farm, and, when this is required it would be  
best, I conceive, to accomplish the work in a  
day.  
12th. It is expected that the fences will be  
made secure, and no damage permitted within  
them by creatures of any kind, or belonging to  
any body, mine any more than others.  
13th. The greatest attention is to be paid to  
stocks of all kinds on the farms; and the most  
to be made of their manure and litter. They  
are to be counted regularly, that no false reports  
may be made; and missing ones, if any, hunted  
for until found, or the manner of their going  
can be accounted for satisfactorily.  
14th. A weekly report, as usual, is to be  
handed to Mr. Lewis. In this report, that I  
may know better how the work goes on, men­  
tion when you begin to plough, hoe, or other­  
wise work in a field, and when that field is fin­  
ished. The increase, decrease, and charges to  
be noted as heretofore—and let me ask :  
15. Why are the corn harrows thrown aside,  
or so little used that I rarely of late see or  
hear of their being at work? I have been  
run to very considerable expenso in providing  
those and other implements for my farms; anc!  
to my great mortification and injury, find, gen­  
erally speaking, that wherever they were last  
used they remain, if not stolen, till required  
again; by which means they, as well as the carts,  
receive so much injury from the wet weather  
and the heat of the sun as to be unfit for use;  
to repair or supply the place of which with new  
ones my carpenters, who ought to be other­  
wise employed, are continually occupied in  
these jobs. Harrows, after the ground is well  
broken, would certainly weed and keep the corn  
clean with more ease than the ploughs. I hope  
therefore they will be used. And it is my ex­  
press orders that the greatest care be taken  
with the tools of every kind, carts, and planta­  
tion implements, in future; for I can no longer  
submit to the losses I am continually sustain­  
ing by neglect.  
16. There i8 nothing I more ardently desire,  
nor indeed is there any more essential to my  
permanent interest, than the raising of live  
fences on proper ditches or banks; yet nothing  
ha« ever been, in a general way, more shame*  
fully neglected or mismanaged; for instead of  
the  
ed,  
if  
the  
for  
on  
the  
is  
ed  
the  
way  
ted  
  
preparing the ground properly for the reception  
of seed, and weeding and keeping the plants  
clean after they come up, the seeds are hardly  
scratched into the ground, «re suffered to be  
smothered by the weeds and grass if they do  
come up; by which means the expense I have  
been at iu purchasing ar.d sending the seeds,  
(generally from Philadelphia,) together with  
the labor, such as it is, that has been incurred,  
is not only lojt, but (and which is of infinitely  
more importance to me) season after season  
passes away, and I am as far from the accom­  
plishment of my object as ever. I mention the  
matter thus fully to show how anxious I am  
that all tbe seeds which have been sown or  
planted on the banks of the ditches should be  
properly attended to, and thedefficient spots  
made good, if you have or can obtain the means  
tor doing it.  
17. There is one thing I must caution you  
against, (without knowing whether there be  
cause to charge you with it or not,) and that is,  
not to retain any of my negroes who are able  
and nt to work in crop, in or about your own  
house for your own purposes. This I do not  
allow any overseer to do. A small boy or girl,  
for the purpose of fetching wood or water, tend­  
ing a child, or some such thing, I do not object  
to; but, so soon as they are able to work out, I  
expect to reap the benefit of their labor.  
18th. Though last mentioned, it is not of the  
least importance, because the peace and irood  
government of the negroes depend upon it, and  
not less so my interest and your own reputa­  
tion. I do therefore, in explicit terms, enjoin  
it upon you to remain constantly at home (un.  
less called off by unavoidable business, or to  
attend Divine worship,) and to be constantly  
with your people when there. There is no  
other sure way of getting work well done and  
quietly by negroes ; for when an overseer&#x27;s  
lack is turned the most of them will slight  
  
their work or be idle altogether, in which case  
correction cannot retrieve either, but often pro­  
duces evils which are worse than the disease.  
Nor is there any other mode than this to pre»  
vent thieving and other disorders, the oonse­  
quence of opportunities. You will recollect  
that your time is paid for by me, and, if I am de­  
prived of it, it is worse than the robbing of ray  
purse, because it is also a breach of trust,  
which any honest man ought to hold most sa­  
cred. Vou have found me, and you will con­
