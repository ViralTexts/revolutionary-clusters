Dear Son  
Cambridge Head Quarters, Oct. 19 [-24]. 1775.  
We hear you have had an Alarm at Philada. I hope no ill consequences have attended it. I wonder I had no Line from you. I make no doubt of our People’s defending their City and Country bravely, on the most trying Occasions.  
I hear nothing yet of Mr. Goddard, but suppose he is on the Road. I suppose we shall leave this Place next Week. I shall not return in Company with the other Delegates, as I must call for my Sister, and we shall hardly be able to travel so fast, but I expect to be at Philada within a few Days of them.  
There has been a plentiful Year here as well as with us: And there are as many chearful Countenances among those who are driven from House and Home at Boston or lost their All at Charlestown, as among other People. Not a Murmur has yet been heard, that if they had been less zealous in the Cause of Liberty they might still have enjoy’d their Possessions. For my own Part tho’ I am for the most prudent Parsimony of the publick Treasure, I am not terrified by the Expence of this War, should it continue ever so long. A little more Frugality, or a little more Industry in Individuals will with Ease defray it. Suppose it £100,000 a Month or £1,200,000 a Year: If 500,000 Families will each spend a Shilling a Week less, or earn a Shilling a Week more; or if they will spend 6 pence a Week less and earn 6 pence a Week more, they may pay the whole Sum without otherwise feeling it. Forbearing to drink Tea saves three fourths of the Money; and 500,000 Women doing each threepence Worth of Spinning or Knitting in a Week will pay the rest.  
*How much more then may be done by the superior Frugality and Industry of the Men?  
I wish nevertheless most earnestly for Peace, this War being a truly unnatural and mischievous one: but we have nothing to expect from Submission but Slavery, and Contempt. I am ever Your affectionate Father   
B F  
Love to dear Sally and the Children

ples. Strange to say, however, there is not a  
lawyer there, and the reason assigned is, that  
the people know enough to get alang without them.  
If one lawyer was to get among them he would  
teach them the contrary.  
There was a snow storm, of a severe charac­  
ter in Albany on Monday night. The snow fell  
a foot thick.  
  
BeniaMin FrAnkian, at the commencement of  
the Revolutionary war, wrete the following:  
&quot;I am not terrified at the expenses of war, should  
it continue ever so long. Suppose it was $100,000  
a month, or $1,200,000 a year. If 500,000 fam­  
ilies will each spend od per week less, and earn  
od week more, they may pay the whole sum  
without feeling it.--Forbearing to drink tea  
saves three fourths of the money, and 409,000  
women doing each 3d worth of spinning or knit­  
ting in a week will pay the rest. How much  
more may be done by the superior industry of  
ithe man.
