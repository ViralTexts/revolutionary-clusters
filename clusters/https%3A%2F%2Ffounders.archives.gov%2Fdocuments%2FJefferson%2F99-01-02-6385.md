 jurisdiction, a bench warrant issued by the said Court, into a different District from that  
in which the indictment was found, would not be considered a sufficient authority to arrest the offender—It could, even  
in those instances of offences of the highest grade, have no operative force or effect, beyond the limits of the District  
from which it issued—Congress have, it is to be presumed for this reason, prescribed a mode of arresting criminals &amp;  
transmitting them to the proper District for the trial of their offences. By the thirty third section of the act of the  
24. Septr. 1789. (1 Vol. p. 72.) it is provided—“That for any crime or offence against the United States, the offender  
may, by any justice or judge of the U. States, or any justice of the peace, or other magistrate of any of the United  
States where he may be found, agreeably to the usual mode of proceeding against offenders in such State, and at the expence  
of the United States, be arrested, &amp; imprisoned or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United  
States as by this act has cognizance of the offence: And copies of the process shall be returned as speedily as may be  
into the clerk’s office of such court, together with the recognizances of the witnesses for their appearance to testify in  
the case; which recognizances the magistrate before whom the examination shall be, may require on pain of imprisonment.  
And if such commitment of the offender, or the witnesses, shall be in a district other than that in which the offence is  
to be tried, it shall be the duty of the judge of that district, where the delinquent is imprisoned, seasonably to issue,  
&amp; of the marshal of the same district to execute, a warrant for the removal of the offender, &amp; the witnesses, or  
either of them, as the case may be, to the district in which the trial is to be had.”  
By this law the manner &amp; the means of arresting an offender are pointed out, &amp; an officer designated who  
is to take him in custody to the place of trial.

isfied by awarding the compulsory process defined &amp; described by the authorities that have been cited.  
I would not be understood as denying the authority of the Circuit Courts to issue an attachment within the  
limits of their respective jurisdictions against a witness who has disobeyed a subpoena duly served. This has been done in  
many instances. Some of the judges considering the court from its very nature &amp; constitution as inherently vested with  
such an authority, whilst others have drawn the power from the general provisions of the act of Congress of Sep. 24. 1789.  
This act in Sec. 17. Vol. 1. p. 60. declares “That all the said courts of the United States shall have power to grant new  
trials, in cases where there has been a trial by jury; for reasons for which new trials have usually been granted in the  
courts of law; and shall have power to impose &amp; administer all necessary oaths or affirmations, and to punish by fine or  
imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before the same; and to  
make and establish all necessary rules for the orderly conducting of business in the said courts, provided such rules are  
not repugnant to the laws of the United States.”  
In England according to modern practice, when a witness has neglected to attend a trial in obedience to a  
subpoena, the party injured may proceed either civilly or criminally against him. He may bring—1. A Special action on the  
case at common law—2. A suit on the Statute, or 3. He may apply to the Court for an attachment.  
In the case now under consideration, I presume it will not be said, for I beleiv

e an attachment “By the Court. An attachment is the  
process of the court, regularly issuing for the administration of justice; and, therefore, must be served by the  
Marshall.”  
From this it would appear that the attachment must be served by the Marshall of that district from which it  
issues. Indeed the warrant must be directed to him. But by the 27. Sec. of the act of Congress of the 24. Sep. 89. Vol. 1.  
p. 65. the Marshall is only authorized to serve the process of the Court within his own district. It is thus provided in  
the section just referred to, “That a Marshall shall be appointed in &amp; for each District for the term of four years, but  
shall be removable from office at pleasure, whose duty it shall be to attend the district &amp; circuit courts when sitting  
therein, &amp; also the Supreme Court in the district in which that court shall sit. And to execute throughout the district,  
all lawfull precepts directed to him.”  
What authority can the court of one District have over the Marshall of another District, unless specially  
given by positive law: He is not an officer of that court which issues the process nor is he amenable to them for any  
mission. It cannot be regularly issued to him. He is not therefore bound to execute it in his own District, nor could he  
take the

The defendant had been outlawed, for robbery; and being  
afterwards apprehended, the present issue was joined upon the identity of the person. Bradford, Attorney General, prayed  
the assistance of the court in sending a subpoena for witnesses into Bucks County, as he could not employ the Sheriff on a  
service out of his jurisdiction. The application was for a special messenger; the Attorney General observing, that if, as  
in England, the Judges were attended by Tipsters, those would be the proper officers to employ on the occasion.  
But the Courts recommended, that he should consult with the Sheriff, on a proper person to be hired for the  
special service.

 question. I cannot express the opinions I entertain on this  
subject, better than by quoting the language of Judge Chase in the above case. “The constitution gives to every man,  
charged with an offence, the benefit of compulsory process, to secure the attendance of his witnesses. I do not know of  
any privilege to exempt members of congress from the service, or the obligations, of a subpoena in such cases. I will not  
sign any letter of the kind proposed. If, upon service of a subpoena, the members of congress do not attend, a different  
question may arise, and it will then be time enough to decide, whether an attachment ought, or ought not to issue. It is  
not a necessary consequence of non attendance, after the service of a subpoena, that an attachment shall issue. A  
satisfactory reason may appear to the court, to justify, or excuse, it

” This manifestly  
presents in my humble opinion the correct idea. It is true there is a constitutional provision that exempts members of  
Congress from arrest except for treason, felony or breach of the peace. But I beleive independent of this the court could  
not have forced a member of congress to abandon his seat, perhaps at a moment when a question of the first consequence to  
the particular State he represented, or of the greatest natio

 provisions in the constitution, the supreme law of the U.S. &amp; in the acts of Congress requiring &amp;  
commanding the discharge of official duties. This must be construed a repeal of the general law, whenever the duties  
conflict. In the same manner as if it had been declared in so many words, that when the discharge of official duties  
interfered with those of a witness an officer should be exempted from the discharge of the latter. Such is beleived to be  
the most correct mode of construing statutes.  
III. The 30. Sec. of the act of 24. Sep. 1789. Vol. 1. page 68. prescribes the mode of taking depositions.  
It provides—“When the testimony of any person shall be necessary in any civil cause, depending in any district in any  
court of the U.States, who shall live at a greater distance from the place of trial than one hundred miles, or is bound on  
a voyage to sea, or is about to go out of the U. States, or out of such District, &amp; to a greater distance from the place  
of trial than as aforesaid, before the  time of trial, or is ancient  
or very infirm, the deposition of such person may be taken de bene esse before any justice or judge of any of the  
courts of the U. States, or before any chancellor, justice or judge of a Supreme or superior court, mayor or chief  
magistrate of a City, or judge of a county court or court of common pleas of any of the U. States, not being of counsel or  
attorney to either of the parties, or interested in the event of the cause, provided that a notification from the  
magistrate before whom the deposition is to be taken to the adverse party, to be present at the taking of the same, &amp; to  
put interrogatories, if he think fit, be first made out &amp; served on the adverse party or his attorney as either may be  
nearest, if either is within one hundred miles of the place of such caption, allowing time for their attendance after  
notified, not less than at the rate of one day, Sundays exclusive, for every twenty miles travel. And in causes of  
admiralty &amp; maritime jurisdiction, or other cases of seizure when a libel shall be filed, in which an adverse party is  
not named, &amp; depositions of persons circumstanced as aforesaid shall be taken before a claim be put in, the like  
notification as aforesaid shall be given to the person having the agency or possession of the property libelled at the  
time of the capture or seizure of the same, if known to the libellant. And every person deposing as aforesaid shall be  
carefully examined &amp; cautioned, &amp; sworn or affirmed to testify the whole truth, &amp; shall subscribe the testimony by  
him or her given after the same shall be reduced to writing, which shall be done only by the magistrate taking the  
deposition, or by the deponents in his presence. And the depositions so taken shall be retained by such magistrate, until  
he deliver the same with his own hand into the court for which they are taken, or shall, together with a certificate of  
the reason, as aforesaid of their being taken, &amp; of the notice if any given to the adverse party, be by him the said  
magistrate sealed up &amp; directed to such courts &amp; remain under his seal until opened in court. And any person may be  
compelled to appear &amp; depose as aforesaid in the same manner as to appear &amp; testify in court. And in the trial of any  
cause of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction in a District court, the decree in which may be appealed from, if either party  
shall suggest to &amp; satisfy the court that probably it will not be in his power to produce the witnesses there testifying  
before the circuit court should an appeal be had, &amp; shall move that their testimony be taken down in writing, it shall  
be so done by the clerk of the court. And if an appeal be had, such testimony may be used on the trial of the same, if it  
shall appear to the satisfaction of the court which shall try the appeal, that the witnesses are then dead or gone out of  
the U.States, or to a greater distance than as aforesaid from the place where the court is sitting, or that by reason of  
age, sickness, bodily infirmity or imprisonment, they are unable to travel &amp; appear at court, but not otherwise. And  
unless the same shall be made to appear on the trial of any cause, with respect to witnesses whose depositions may have  
been taken therein, such depositions shall not be admitted or used in the cause. Provided, that nothing herein shall be  
construed to prevent any court of the U. States from granting a dedimus potestatem to take depositions according to common  
usage, when it may be necessary to prevent a failure or delay of justice; which power they shall severally possess, nor to  
extend to depositions taken in perpetuam sei memoriam, which if they relate to matters that may be cognizable in any court  
of the U. States, a circuit court on application thereto made, as a court of equity may, according to the usages in  
chancery direct to be taken.”  
From this it appears that a particular method is directed by the act for taking the testimony of persons in  
certain situations with a saving of the usual modes of proceeding on the subject.  
You may therefore take the statutable remedy or adopt the other. Under the Statute you may compel within the  
jurisdictional limits of the court the attendance of wi

does there say, that the act of congress must be so construed

The statute provides that United States commissioners and cer-  
tain magistrates ‘“‘for any crime or offence against the United  
States,” may “‘arrest and imprison, or bail the offender for trial  
before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of  
the offence.” Rev. Stats. sec. 1,014. An information was filed  
before Commissioner Clarke, who committed the prisoner to the  
custody of.the marshal. In such a case the further provision is  
that “‘ where any offender is committed in any district, other than  
that where the offence is to be tried, it shall be the duty of the  
judge of the district where such offender is imprisoned, seasonably  
to issue, and the marshal to execute a warrant for his removal to  
the district where the trial is to be had.” Rev. Stats. sec. 1,014.  
On the proceedings before him the district judge refused to issue  
the warrant of removal and discharged the prisoner; and the  
question is whether his action in this case ought to be reversed.  
  
The district judge, in making this order, proceeded upon the  
ground that he might properly look into-the indictment, and if it  
was fatally defective in essential averments to constitute an offence  
triable in the District of Columbia, he might refuse to issue the

curing the issuance of this warrant, if they

that, for any crime or offence against the
