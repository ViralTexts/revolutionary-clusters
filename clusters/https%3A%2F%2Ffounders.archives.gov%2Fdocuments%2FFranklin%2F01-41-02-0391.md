INFORMATION  
TO THOSE WHO WOULD REMOVE TO AMERICA.  
  
  
Many Persons in Europe having directly or by Letters, express’d to the Writer of this, who is well acquainted with North-America, their Desire of transporting and establishing themselves in that Country; but who appear to him to have formed thro’ Ignorance, mistaken Ideas &amp; Expectations of what is to be obtained there; he thinks it may be useful, and prevent inconvenient, expensive &amp; fruitless Removals and Voyages of improper Persons, if he gives some clearer &amp; truer Notions of that Part of the World than appear to have hitherto prevailed.  
  
He finds it is imagined by Numbers that the Inhabitants of North-America are rich, capable of rewarding, and dispos’d to reward all sorts of Ingenuity; that they are at the same time ignorant of all the Sciences; &amp; consequently that strangers possessing Talents in the Belles-Letters, fine Arts, &amp;c. must be highly esteemed, and so well paid as to become easily rich themselves; that there are also abundance of profitable Offices to be disposed of, which the Natives are not qualified to fill; and that having few Persons of Family among them, Strangers of Birth must be greatly respected and of course easily obtain the best of those Offices, which will make all their Fortunes: that the Governments too, to encourage Emigrations from Europe, not only pay the expence of personal Transportation, but give Lands gratis to Strangers, with Negroes to work for them, Utensils of Husbandry, &amp; Stocks of Cattle. These are all wild Imaginations; and those who go to America with Expectations founded upon them, will surely find themselves disappointed.  
The Truth is, that tho’ there are in that Country few People so miserable as the Poor of Europe, there are also very few that in Europe would be called rich: it is rather a general happy Mediocrity that prevails. There are few great Proprietors of the Soil, and few Tenants; most People cultivate their own Lands, or follow some Handicraft or Merchandise; very few rich enough to live idly upon their Rents or Incomes; or to pay the high Prices given in Europe, for Paintings, Statues, Architecture and the other Works of Art that are more curious than useful. Hence the natural Geniuses that have arisen in America, with such Talents, have uniformly quitted that Country for Europe, where they can be more suitably rewarded. It is true that Letters and mathematical Knowledge are in Esteem there, but they are at the same time more common than is apprehended; there being already existing nine Colleges or Universities, viz. four in New-England, and one in each of the Provinces of New-York, New-Jersey, Pensilvania, Maryland and Virginia, all furnish’d with learned Professors; besides a number of smaller Academies: These educate many of their Youth in  
  
the Languages and those Sciences that qualify Men for the Professions of Divinity, Law or Physick. Strangers indeed are by no means excluded from exercising those Professions, and the quick Increase of Inhabitants every where gives them a Chance of Employ, which they have in common with the Natives. Of civil Offices or Employments there are few; no superfluous Ones as in Europe; and it is a Rule establish’d in some of the States, that no Office should be so profitable as to make it desirable. The 36 Article of the Constitution of Pensilvania, runs expresly in these Words: As every Freeman, to preserve his Independence, (if he has not a sufficient Estate) ought to have some Profession, Calling, Trade or Farm, whereby he may honestly subsist, there can be no Necessity for, nor Use in, establishing Offices of Profit; the usual Effects of which are Dependance and Servility, unbecoming Freemen, in the Possessors and Expectants; Faction, Contention, Corruption, and Disorder among the People. Wherefore whenever an Office, thro’ Increase of Fees or otherwise, becomes so profitable as to occasion many to apply for it, the Profits ought to be lessened by the Legislature.  
These Ideas prevailing more or less in all the United States, it cannot be worth any Man’s while, who has a means of Living at home, to expatriate himself in hopes of obtaining a profitable civil Office in America; and as to military Offices, they are at an End with the War; the Armies being disbanded. Much less is it adviseable for a Person to go thither who has no other Quality to recommend him but his Birth. In Europe it has indeed its Value, but it is a Commodity that cannot be carried to a worse Market than to that of America, where People do not enquire concerning a Stranger, What IS he? but What can he DO? If he has any useful Art, he is welcome; and if he exercises it &amp; behaves well, he will be respected by all that know him; but a mere Man of Quality, who on that Account wants to live upon the Public, by some Officer or Salary, will be despis’d and disregarded. The Husbandman is in honor there, &amp; even the Mechanic, because  
  
their Employments are useful. The People have a Saying, that God Almighty is himself a Mechanic, the greatest in the Universe; and he is respected and admired more for the Variety, Ingenuity and Utility of his Handiworks, than for the Antiquity of his Family. They are pleas’d with the Observation of a Negro, and frequently mention it, that Boccarorra (meaning the Whiteman) make de Blackman workee, make de Horse workee, make de Ox workee, make ebery ting workee; only de Hog. He de Hog, no workee; he eat, he drink, he walk about, he go to sleep when he please, he libb like a Gentleman. According to these Opinions of the Americans, one of them would think himself more oblig’d to a Genealogist, who could prove for him that his Ancestors &amp; Relations for ten Generations had been Ploughmen, Smiths, Carpenters, Turners, Weavers, Tanners, or even Shoemakers, &amp; consequently that they were useful Members of Society; than if he could only prove that they were Gentlemen, doing nothing of value, but living idly on the Labour of others, mere Fruges consumere nati*, and otherwise good for nothing, till by their Death, their Estates like the Carcase of the Negro’s Gentleman-Hog, come to be cut up.  
With Regard to Encouragements for Strangers from Government, they are really only what are derived from good Laws &amp; Liberty. Strangers are welcome because there is room enogh for them all, and therefore the old Inhabitants are not jealous of them; the Laws protect them sufficiently, so that they have no  
  
need of the Patronage of great Men; and every one will enjoy securely the Profits of his Industry. But if he does not bring a Fortune with him, he must work and be industrious to live. One or two Years Residence give him all the Rights of a Citizen; but the Government does not at present, whatever it may have done in former times, hire People to become Settlers, by Paying their Passages, giving Land, Negroes, Utensils, Stock, or any other kind of Emolument whatsoever. In short America is the Land of Labour, and by no means what the English call Lubberland, and the French Pays de Cocagne, where the Streets are said to be pav’d with half-peck Loaves, the Houses til’d with Pancakes, and where the Fowls fly about ready roasted, crying, Come eat me!  
Who then are the kind of Persons to whom an Emigration to America may be advantageous? and what are the Advantages they may reasonably expect?  
Land being cheap in that Country, from the vast Forests still void of Inhabitants, and not likely to be occupied in an Age to come, insomuch that the Propriety of an hundred Acres of fertile Soil full of Wood may be obtained near the Frontiers in many Places for eight or ten Guineas, hearty young labouring Men, who understand the Husbandry of Corn and Cattle, which is nearly the same in that Country as in Europe, may easily establish themselves there. A little Money sav’d of the good Wages they receive there while they work for others, enables them to buy the Land and begin their Plantation, in which they are assisted by the Good Will of their Neighbours and some Credit. Multitudes of poor People from England, Ireland, Scotland and Germany, have by this means in a few Years become wealthy Farmers, who in their own Countries, where all the Lands are fully occupied, and the Wages of Labour low, could never have emerged from the mean Condition wherein they were born.  
From the Salubrity of the Air, the Healthiness of the Climate, the Plenty of good Provisions, and the Encouragement to early Marriages, by the certainty of Subsistance in cultivating the  
  
Earth, the Increase of Inhabitants by natural Generation is very rapid in America, and becomes still more so by the Accession of Strangers; hence there is a continual Demand for more Artisans of all the necessary and useful kinds, to supply those Cultivators of the Earth with Houses, and with Furniture &amp; Utensils of the grosser Sorts which cannot so well be brought from Europe. Tolerably good Workmen in any of those mechanic Arts, are sure to find Employ, and to be well paid for their Work, there being no Restraints preventing Strangers from exercising any Art they understand, nor any Permission necessary. If they are poor, they begin first as Servants or Journeymen; and if they are sober, industrious &amp; frugal, they soon become Masters, establish themselves in Business, marry, raise Families, and become respectable Citizens.  
Also, Persons of moderate Fortunes and Capitals, who having a Number of Children to provide for, are desirous of bringing them up to Industry, and to secure Estates for their Posterity, have Opportunities of doing it in America, which Europe does not afford. There they may be taught &amp; practice profitable mechanic Arts withut [without] incurring Disgrace on that Account; but on the contrary acquiring Respect by such Abilities. There small Capitals laid out in Lands, which daily become more valuable by the Increase of People, afford a solid Prospect of ample Fortunes thereafter for those Children. The Writer of this has known several Instances of large Tracts of Land, bought on what was then the Frontier of Pensilvania, for ten Pounds per hundred Acres, which, after twenty Years, when the Settlements had been extended far beyond them, sold readily, without any Improvement made upon them, for three Pounds per Acre. The Acre in America is the same with the English Acre or the Acre of Normandy.  
  
Those who desire to understand the State of Government in America, would do well to read the Constitutions of the several States, and the Articles of Confederation that bind the whole together for general Purposes under the Direction of one Assembly called the Congress. These Constitutions have been printed by Order of Congress in America; two Editions of them have also been printed in London, and a good Translation of them into French has lately been published at Paris.  
Several of the Princes of Europe having of late Years, from an Opinion of Advantage to arise by producing all Commodities &amp; Manufactures within their own Dominions, so as to diminish or render useless their Importations, have endeavoured to entice Workmen from other Countries, by high Salaries, Privileges, &amp;c. Many Persons pretending to be skilled in various great Manufactures, imagining that America must be in Want of them, and that the Congress would probably be dispos’d to imitate the Princes above mentioned, have proposed to go over, on Condition of having their Passages paid, Lands given, Salaries appointed, exclusive Privileges for Terms of Years, &amp;c. Such persons on reading the Articles of Confederation will find that the Congress have no Power committed to them, or Money put into their Hands, for such purposes; and that if any such Encouragement is given, it must be by the Government of some separate State. This however has rarely been done in America; and when it has been done it has rarely succeeded, so as to establish a Manufacture which the Country was not yet so ripe for as to encourage private Persons to set it up; Labour being generally too dear there, &amp; Hands difficult to be kept together, every one desiring to be a Master, and the Cheapness of Land enclining many to leave Trades for Agriculture. Some indeed have met with Success, and are carried on to Advantage; but they are generally such as require only a few Hands, or wherein great Part of the Work is perform’d by Machines. Goods that are bulky, &amp; of so small Value as not well to bear the Expence of Freight, may often be made cheaper in the Country than they can be imported; and the Manufacture of such Goods will be  
  
profitable wherever there is a sufficient Demand. The Farmers in America produce indeed a good deal of Wool &amp; Flax; and none is exported, it is all work’d up; but it is in the Way of Domestic Manufacture for the Use of the Family. The buying up Quantities of Wool &amp; Flax with the Design to employ Spinners, Weavers, &amp;c. and form great Establishments, producing Quantities of Linen and Woollen Goods for Sale, has been several times attempted in different Provinces; but those Projects have generally failed, Goods of equal Value being imported cheaper. And when the Governments have being [been] solicited to support such Schemes oy [by] Encouragements, in Money, or by imposing Duties an [on] Importation of such Goods, it has been generally refused, on this Principle, that if the Country is ripe for the Manufacture, it may be carried on by private Persons to Advantage; and if not, it is a Folly to think of forceing [forcing] Nature. Great Establishments of Manufacture, require great Numbers of Poor to do the Work for small Wages; these Poor are to be found in Europe, but will not be found in America, till the Lands are all taken up and cultivated, and the excess of People who cannot get Land, want Employment. The Manufacture of Silk, they sey [say], is natural in France, as that of Cloth in England, because each Country produces in Plenty the first Material: But if England will have a Manufacture of Silk as well as that of Cloth, and France one of Cloth as well as that of Silk, these unnatural Operations must be supported by mutual Prohibitions or high Duties on the Importation of each others Goods, by which means the Workmen are enabled to tax the home-Consumer by greater Prices, while the higher Wages they receive makes them neither happier nor richer, since they only drink more and work less. Therefore the Governments in America do nothing to encourage such Projects. The People by this Means are not impos’d on, either by the Merchant or Mechanic; if the Merchant demands too much Profit on imported Shoes, they buy of the Shoemaker: And if he asks to [too] high a Price, they take them of the Merchant: thus the two Professions are Checks on each other. The Shoemaker however has on the whole a considerable Profit upon his Labour in America, beyond what he had in Europe, as he can add to his Price a Sum nearly equal to all the Expences of Freight &amp; Commission,  
  
Risque or Insurance, &amp;c. necessarily charged by the Merchant. And the Case is the same with the Workmen in every other Mechanic Art. Hence it is that Artisans generally live better and more easily in America than in Europe, and such as are good œconomists make a comfortable Provision for Age, &amp; for their Children. Such may therefore remove with Advantage to America.  
In the old longsettled Countries of Europe, all Arts, Trades, Professions, Farms, &amp;c. are so full that it is difficult for a poor Man who has Children, to place them where they may gain, or learn to gain a decent Livelihood. The Artisans, who fear creating future Rivals in Business, refuse to take Apprentices, but upon Conditions of Money, Maintenance or the like, which the Parents are unable to comply with. Hence the Youth are dragg’d up in Ignorance of every gainful Art, and oblig’d to become Soldiers or Servants or Thieves, for a Subsistance. In America the rapid Increase of Inhabitants takes away that Fear of Rivalship, &amp; Artisans willingly receive Apprentices from the hope of Profit by their Labour during the Remainder of the Time stipulated after they shall be instructed. Hence it is easy for poor Families to get their Children instructed; for the Artisans are so desirous of Apprentices, that many of them will even give Money to the Parents to have Boys from ten to fifteen Years of Age bound Apprentices to them till the Age of twenty one; and many poor Parents have by that means, on their Arrival in the Country, raised Money enough to buy Land sufficient to establish themselves, and subsist the rest of their Family by Agriculture. These Contracts for Apprentices are made before a Magistrate, who regulates the Agreement according to Reason and Justice; and having in view the Formation of a future useful Citizen, obliges the Master to engage by a written Indenture, not only that during the time of Service stipulated, the Apprentice shall be duly provided with Meat, Drink, Apparel, washing &amp; Lodging, and at its Expiration with a compleat new suit of Clothes, but also that he shall be taught to read, write &amp; cast Accompts, &amp; that he shall be well instructed in the Art or Profession of his Master, or some other, by which he may afterwards gain a Livelihood, and be able in his turn to raise a Family. A Copy of this Indenture is given to the Apprentice or his Friends, &amp; the Magistrate keeps a Record of it, to which  
  
Recourse may be had, in case of Failure by the Master in any Point of Performance. This Desire among the Masters to have more Hands employ’d in working for them, induces them to pay the Passages of young Persons, of both Sexes, who on their Arrival agree to serve them one, two, three or four Years; those who have already learnt a Trade agreeing for a shorter Term in Proportion to their Skill and the consequent immediate Value of their Service; and those who have none, agreeing for a longer Term, in Consideration of being taught an Art their Poverty would not permit them to acquire in their own Country.  
The almost general Mediocrity of Fortune that prevails in America, obliging its People to follow some Business for Subsistance, those Vices that arise usually from Idleness are in a great Measure prevented. Industry and constant Employment are great Preservatives of the Morals and Virtue of a Nation. Hence bad Examples to Youth are more rare in America, which must be a comfortable Consideration to Parents. To this may be truly added, that serious Religion under its various Denominations, is not only tolerated but respected and practised. Atheism is unknown there, Infidelity rare &amp; secret, so that Persons may live to a great Age in that Country without having their Piety shock’d by meeting with either an Atheist or an Infidel. And the Divine Being seems to have manifested his Approbation of the mutual Forbearance and Kindness with which the different Sects treat each other, by the remarkable Prosperity with which he has been pleased to favour the whole Country

and thoſe who go to America with expec-  
tations founded upon them, will ſurely  
find themſelves diſappointed. FT,  
  
The truth is, that though there are in  
that country few people ſo. miſerable as  
the poor of Europe, there are alſo very  
few that in Europe would be called rich:  
It is rather a general happy mediocrity  
that prevails. There are few great Pro-

follow ſome handicraft or merchandiſe I  
very few rich enough to live idly upon  
their rents or incomes ; or to pay the high  
prices given in Europe, for Painting, Sta-

Art that are more curious than uſeful.  
Hence the natural geniuſes that have ariſen

labour being generally too dear there, and  
hands difficult to be kept together, every  
one defiring to be a maſter, and the cheaps

for agriculture. Some indeed have met

defeription of the prefent date of North America, with regard to  
the occupations, purfuits, wants, and temper of its inhabitants,  
&#x27;Fhe pradical inference drawn from the whole of his remark, is,  
that it is the laborious and indudrious labourer and mechanic that  
is bed fitted to thrive in America.  
  
• It cannot be worth any man’s while, Dr. Franklin fays, who has  
a means of living at home, ‘ to expatriate himfelf in hopes of ob¬  
taining a profitable civil office in America; and as to military offices,  
they arc at an end with the war, the armies being difbanded. Much  
lefs is it advifable fpr ^ perfon to go thither, who has no other qua¬  
lity to recommend him but his birth. In Europe it has indeed its  
value ; but it is a commodity that cannot be carried to a worfe mar¬  
ket than to that of America, where people do not enquire concerning a  
fh^nger, M7jat is be f but JVhat can he dvf If he has any ufcful art,

refp^cd by all that know him ; but a mere man of quality, who on  
that account wants to live upon the public, by fome office or falary^  
will be defpiled and difregarded. The huibandman is in honour  
there, and even the mechanic, bccaufe their employments are uleful.  
The people have a faying, that God Almighty is himfclf a mechanic,  
the greatell ir&gt; the univerfe ; and he is refpeded and admired more for  
the variety, ingenuity, and utility^ of his handiworks, than for the  
antiquity of his family. They are plcafedwith the obfervation of a  
negro, and frequently mention it, . that Boccarorra (meaning the  
white man) make de black man workee, make de horfe workee,  
make de ox workee, make ebery ting workee ; only de hog. He  
(Ic hog, no workee ; he eat, he drink, he walk about, he go to fleep  
when he pleafe, he libb like a gentleman. According to thefe opi¬  
nions of the Americans, one of them wquld think himfelf more  
obliged to a genealogift, who could prove for him that his anceftors  
and relations for ten generations had been ploughmen, fmiths, car¬  
penters, turners, weavers, tanners, or even fhoemakers, and conr  
fcquently, that they were ufeful members of fociery; than if he  
could only prove thatt hey were gentlemen, doing nothing of  
value, but living idly on the labour of others, intvt fruges confumere  
nati^ and otherwife for nothings till by their death, their cllates,  
like the carcafe of the negro&#x27;s gentleman-hog, come to be cutups  
The remarks concerning the favages of North America are very  
curious. They difeover enlarged views of human nature, and

Information to thofe who would  
remoue to America.  
  
[By Dr. FRANKLIN. }  
  
ANY perfons in Europe  
  
having directly or by let-  
ters, exprefied to the writ-  
er of this, who is well  
acquainted with North  
America, their defire of tranf-  
porting and eftablifhing themfelves  
in thatcoustry; but who appear to  
him to have formed, through a  
rance, miflaken ideas and expettati-  
ons of what is to be obtained there ;  
he thinks it may be ufeful, and pre-  
vent inconvenient, expenfive and  
fruitiefs removals and voyages of im-  
proper perfons, if he gives (ome clear-  
er and truer notions of that part of  
the world than appear to have nither-  
to prevailed.  
  
He finds it isimagined by numbers,  
that the inbabitants of Nori: Ameri-  
ca are rich, capable of rewarding,  
and difpofed to reward all forts of in-  
fenuity; that they are at the fame  
lime ignorant of ali the fciences; and  
confequently that Nrangers poffe fling  
talents in the belles-letters, fine  
  
  
  
arts, &amp;&gt;. muft be highly efieemed, |  
  
and [&gt; well paid asto become ealily  
  
rich themfelves; that there are alfe  
abundaace of profitable officesto be  
difpofed of, which the natives are not  
qualified to fill ; and that having few  
perfons of family among them, firan-  
gers of birth muff be greatly refpe&amp;-  
ed, and of courfe eafily obtam the bef  
of thofe offices, which will make all  
their fortunes : That the governments  
tao, to encourage emigrations from  
Europe, not only pay the expence of  
perfonal tranfportation, but give  
lands gratis to firangers, with negroes  
to work for them, utenfils of huiban-  
dry, and flocks of cattle. Thefe are  
ail wild imaginations ; andthofe whe  
go to America with expeations  
founded upon them, will furely fad  
themfelves difappointed.  
  
The truth is, that though there are  
inthat country few people fo mife-  
rable as the poor of Europe, there are  
alfo very few that in Europe would  
be called rich: Itisrather a general  
happy mediocrity that prevails.  
There are few great proprietors of the  
foi, and few tenants; moft peopie  
cultivate their own lands, or follow  
fome handicraft or merchandife; ve-  
ry few rich enough to live idly upon  
their rents or incomes; orto pay the  
h&#x27;gh prices given in Europe, for paint-  
ing, flatues, architeure, and the  
other works of art that are more curi-

geniufes that have arifen in America  
with fuch talents, iiave uowermly  
guitted that Country for Europe,  
where they can be more fultabiy re-  
warded. fItistrue that ietters and  
smRathematical knowledge are ina efteem  
there, butghey are at the fame t:me  
more Common thaa is apprehended ;  
there being already exifting nine Col-  
legesor Univerfitiesy viz. fourin New  
Engiand, and oe in each of the pro-  
vinces of New York, New Jerfey,  
Pennfilvania, Maryland, and Virginia,  
all furmfhed with learned profeffors ;  
befides 2 number of fmatles Acade-  
mies: Thefe educate many of their  
youth in the languages, and thofe  
fciences that qualify mem for the pro-  
feifions of divinity, law, or: phy fic.  
Strangers indeed are hy no means ex-  
cluded from exercifing thofe profefiz-  
ons; and the quick tacreafe of inha-  
bitants every where gives them a  
chaace of employ, which they havein  
common with’ the natives. OF civil  
offices or employ ments, there are few ;  
no fuperfuows ones as in Europe; and  
it is a@ rule efablifhed in fome of the  
States, that no office fhould be fo pro-  
fitable as to make it defirable. The  
36th article of the conflitution of  
Penofivania, runs exprefsty in thefe  
words: ‘“Asevery freeman, to pre-  
“&lt;&lt; ferve his indepeudence (if he has  
“not a fufficieut eftate) ought to  
‘have fome profeffion, calling, trade,  
‘© or farm, whereby he may honeftly  
“ fubfift, therecan be no neceffity for,  
* norufe in, eftablifhing offices of pro-  
‘Ht; the ufual effeds of which are  
“« dependence and fervilirv,unbecom-  
‘ing freemen,in the poffeffors and  
*“‘expeGants; fattion, contention,  
** corruption, and diforder among the  
** peoble, Wherefore, whenever an  
“ office, through increafe of fees or  
** otherwife, becomes {fo profitable as  
‘*&#x27;to occafroa many to apply for it,  
“the profits ought to be lsffened by  
** the legiflature.”  
  
Thefe tdeas prevaiFng more or lefs  
tin al! the Gaired Srates, it cannot be  
werth any man’s witile, who his 2  
mens of living at iume, to expatri-  
ate himfelf in hepes of obtaining a  
proftabis civil cficein America ; and  
as to mulitary offices, they are at an

ble for a perfon to go thither who  
  
has no other quality to. recommend

indeed its value ; but it is a cammo-  
  
dity that canuot be carried toa worfe  
  
Market thin to thar of America,  
  
where people do not enquire concern-  
  
ing a ftranger, whatis he? but what  
  
ean he do! If he has any ufeful art  
  
he is welcome ; andif he exercifes it,  
  
aod behaves wei, be will be refpected  
  
by ail that KXuow him; but a mere  
  
man of quality, who on that account  
  
wants to live upoa the public, by  
  
fome office or falary, will be de(pifed  
and difregarded. The hutbandman  
  
is in honour there, and even the me-  
chanic, becaufe their employments  
are ufeful. The people havea faying  
thatGod Almighty is himfelf a me-  
chanic, the greateft in the univerfe;  
and he is refpe&amp;ted and admired more  
for the variety, ingenuity, and utility  
of his handy works, than for the anti-  
quity of his family. They are pleaf/  
ed with the obfervation of a negro,  
and frequently mention it, that Boc-  
Carorra (meaning the white man)  
make de black man workee, make de  
horfe workee, make de ox workee,  
make ebery ting workee; only de  
hog. He de hog, no workee; he eat  
he drink, he waik about, he go to  
fleep whea he pleas, he libb like a gen-  
tleman. According to thefe opinions  
of the Americans, ove ofthem would  
think himfelf more obliged to a gene-  
alogift, who ceuld prove for him that  
his anceftors and relations for ten ge-  
Rerations had been ploughmen,  
fmiths, carpenters, turners, weavers,

confequently that they were ufeful

death, their eftates, like the carcafe  
of the negro’s gent&#x27;eman-hog come  
to be cut up.  
  
With regard to encourzgements

are really only what arederived from  
good jaws and liberty. Strangers

One or two years refidence give him

of the good wages they receive there  
while they work for others, enables  
them to buy the land and begin their  
-plantation, in which they are affiited  
by the good will oftheir neighbours,  
and fomecredit. Multitudes of poor  
peopie from England, Ireland, Scot-  
jand, and Germany, have by this  
meansin afew years become wealthy

by the acceflion of flrangers; hence  
there is acontinual dymand for more  
artifans ofall tue neceflary and ufe-  
fulkinds, to fupply tholfe cultivators  
of the earth with houfes, and with

tue dire€&amp;tion of one aifembiy called

commodities and manufattures with-  
in their own domiuions, fo as to di-

if any fuch encouragement is given,  
it mut be by the government of fome

America produce indeed a good deal  
of wooland fax ; and none Is export-  
ed, it is ail worked up; but it is in  
the way of domeftic manufacture for  
tue ule of the fam:ly.. The buying up  
quantities of wool and flax with the  
defign to employ {pinners, weavers,  
&amp;c. and form great efiablifhments,  
prodacing quantities of liven and  
woollen goods for fale, has been feve.  
ral times attermpted in different pro-  
vinces ; but thofe proje@s have gene-  
rally failed, goods of equal value be-  
ing imported cheaper. And when  
the governments have been folicited  
to fupport fuch fchemes by encou-  
ragements, in money, or by impofing  
duties on importation of fuch goods,  
it has been generally refufed, on this  
principle, that if the country is ripe  
for the manufatture, it may be car-  
ried on by private perfons to advan-  
tage ; and if not, it isa folly to think  
of forcing nature. Great eftabtifh-  
ments of manufatture, require great  
numbers of poor to work for {mail  
wages ; thefe poor are to be found ih  
Europe, but will not be fousd ia  
America, tiil the lands are al! taken  
up and cultivated, and the excefs of  
people, who cannot get land, want  
employment. The manufa&amp;ure of  
fiik, they fay, is natural in France, as  
that of cloth in England,becaufe each  
country produces in plenty the frft  
material : But if England will have  
a matufacture of filk as well as that  
  
of cloth, and France one of cloth as °  
  
well as that of Mlk, thefe unnatural  
operations muft be fupported by mu-  
tual prohibitions, or high duties on  
the importation of each others goods;  
by which means the workmen are  
enabled to tax the home coufumer by  
greater prices, while the higher wages  
they receive makes them neither hap-  
pier or richer, fince they only drink  
more and work lefs. Therefore the  
goveraomentsin America do nothing  
to encourage fuch projects. The peo-  
ple, by this means, are not impofed  
on, either by the merchant or mecha-  
nic; if tie merchant demands too  
much profit on imported fhoes, they  
buy of the fhoemaker; and:f he aiks  
too nigh a price, they take them of  
the merchant : Taus the (we profefit-

fhoemaker, however, has on the  
whole, a Confiderable profit upon his  
labour in America, beyond what he  
had in Europe, as he can add to his  
price afum nearly equal to all the ex-  
pences of freight and commiffion,  
rifque or infurance, &amp;c. meceffarily  
charged by the merchant. Aud the  
cafe isthe fame with the workmen  
in every other mechanic art. Hence  
it is, that artifans generaiiy live better  
and more eafily in America than in  
Europe; and fuch as are good ceco-  
nomifts, make a comfortable provifi-  
on for age, and for their children.  
Such may, therefore, remove with  
advantage to America.  
  
In the old long fettled countries of  
Europe, all arts, trades, profeffions,  
farms, &amp;c. are fo full, that it is defhi-  
cult for a poor man,who has children,  
to place them where they may gain,  
orlearnto gain a decent Itveiinood.  
The artifans, who fear creating fu-  
ture rivals in bufinefs, refufe to take  
apprentices, but upon conditions of  
money, maintenance, or the like,  
which the parents are unable to com-  
ply with. Hence the youth are drag-  
ged up in ignorance of every gainful  
art, and obliged to become folders  
or fervants, or thieves, for a fubfift-  
ence. In America, the rapid increafe  
of inhabitants takes away that fear of  
rivaifhip, and artifans willingly re-  
ceive apprentices from the hope of  
profit by their labour, during the  
remainder of the time ftipulated, af-  
ter they fhall be inftru@led. Hence  
itis eafy for poor families to get the:r  
children inftru@ted ; for the artifans  
are fo defirous of apprentices, that  
many of them will even give money  
to the parents, to have boys from ten  
te fifteen years of age bound appren-  
tices to them, till the age of twenry-  
one ; and many poor parents have,  
by that means, on their arrival in the  
country, raifed money enough to  
buy land fufficient to eftablifh them-  
felves, and to (ubfiit the reft of theic  
family by agriculture. Thefe con-  
tra&amp;s for apprentices are made be-  
fore a magiftrate, who regulates the  
agreement according to reafon and  
juflice ; and having in view the for-  
mation of a future ufeful citizen,  
obliges the mafter to engage by a  
written indenture, not oniy that

the apprentice fhall be duly provid-  
ed with meat, drink, apparel, wafh-  
ing, and lodging, and at its expira-  
tion with a compiete new fut of  
clothes, but aifo that he fhall be  
taught to read, write, anid caft ac-  
compts ; and that he fhall be well  
inftructed in the art or profeffion of  
his mafter, or fome other, by which  
he may afterwards gain a livelihood,  
and be able in his turn to raife a fami-  
ly. A copy of this indesture is given  
to the apprentice or nis friends, and  
the magifirate keeps a record of it,  
to.which recourfe may be had, in  
cafe of failure by the mafler inany  
point of performance. This defire  
among the mafters to have more  
hands employed in working for  
them, induces them to pay the paf-  
fages of young perfons, of both fexes,  
who on their arrival agree io ferve  
them one, two, three, or four years ;  
thofe who have already learned a  
trade, agreeing for a fhorter term,  
im proportion to their fkill, and the  
confequent immediate value of their  
fervice ; and thofe who have none,  
agresing for a longer term, in con-  
fideration of he:ng taught en art their  
poverty would not permit them te  
acquire in their own country.  
  
The almoft general mediocrity of  
fortune that prevails in Amertca,  
obliging its peopte to follow fome bu-  
fine!s for fabfilence, thofe vices that  
arife ufuaily from idleneis, are in 2  
great mesfure prevented. Induftry  
and conflant employment are great  
prefervatives of the morals and virtue  
ofanation. Hence bad examples to  
youth are more rare inAmerica,which  
mufi be a comfortable confideration  
to parents. To this may be truly  
added, that ferious religion, under its  
various denomisations, is not only  
tolerated, but refpefted and praftifed.  
Atheifm is unkoown there ; inSdelity  
rareand fecret; fo that perfons may  
live to a great age in that country  
without having their piety fhocked  
by meeting with either an atheift or  
aa infidel. And the Divine Being feems  
to have minifefied his approbation of  
the mutual! forbearance and kindnefs  
with which the different fetts treat  
each other, by the remarkable prof-  
pe rity with which he has been pleated  
to favour the whole country. p

having few perſons of family among them,  
ſtrangers of birth muſt be greatly reſpected,  
and of courſe eaſily obtain the beſt of thoſe  
offices, which will make all their fortunes :  
that the governments too, to encourage emigra-  
tions from Europe, not only pay the expence  
of perſonal tranfportation, but give lands gratis  
to ſtrangers, with negroes to work for them,  
utenſils of huſbandry, and ſtocks of cattle.  
Theſe are all wild imaginations ; and thoſe who  
  
  
them, will ſurely find themſelves diſappointed.  
The truth is, that though there are in that  
  
country few people ſo miſerable as the. poor of  
  
Europe, there are alſo very few that in ee  
  
  
happy mediocrity that prevails. There are few  
great proprietors of the ſoil, and few tenants ;

time more common than is apprehended ; there  
being already exiſting nine colleges, or univer-  
lities, viz. four in New-England, and one in  
each of the provinces of New- Vork, New-Jer-  
ſey, Pennſilvania, Maryland, and Virginia, all  
furniſhed with learned Profeſſors ; beſides a  
number of ſmaller academies : theſe educate ,  
many of their youth in the languages, and thoſe  
ſciences that qualify men for the profeſſions  
  
of divinity, law, or phyſic. Strangers indeed  
are by no means excluded from exerciſing thoſe  
profeſſions; and the quick increaſe of inhabi-  
tants every where gives them a chance of em-  
ploy, which they have in common with the  
natives. Of civil offices or employments, there  
are few ; no ſuperfluous ones as in Europe; and  
it is a rule eſtabliſhed in ſome of the States, that  
no office ſhould be ſo profitable as to make it  
deſirable. The 36th article of the conſtitution  
of Pennſilvania runs expreſsly in theſe words:  
« As every freeman, to preſerve his independ-  
* ence (if he has not a ſufficient eſtate) ought  
* to have ſome profeſſion, calling, trade, or  
« farm, whereby he may honeſtly ſubſiſt, there  
ce can be no neceſſity for, nor uſe in, eſta-  
„ bliſhing offices of profit; the uſual effects  
„of which are dependence and fervility,  
„ unbecoming freemen, in the poſſeſſors and

146 INFORMATION TO THOSE WHO  
  
« as to occaſion many to apply for it, the pro-  
« fits ought to be leſſened by the legiſlature.”  
Theſe ideas prevailing more or leſs in all the  
United States, it cannot be worth any man&#x27;s  
while, who has a means of living at home, to  
expatriate himſelf in hopes of obtaining a pro-  
fitable civil office in America; and as to mi-  
litary offices, they are at an end with the war,  
the armies being diſpanded. Much leſs is it ad-  
viſeable for a perſon to go thither who has no  
other quality to recommend him but his birth.  
In Europe it has indeed its value; but it is a  
commodity that cannot be carried to a worſe  
market than to that of America, where people  
do not enquire concerning a ſtranger, What ts  
he ? but M hat can be do? If he has any uſeful  
art, he is welcome; and if he exerciſes it, and  
behaves well, he will be reſpected by all that  
know him; but a mere man of quality, who  
on that account wants to live upon the pub-  
lic, by ſome office or ſalary, will be deſpiſ-  
ed and diſregarded. The huſbandman is in  
honour there, and even the mechanic, becauſe  
their employments are uſeful. The people have  
a ſaying, that God Almighty is himſelf a me-  
chanic, the greateſt in the univerſe; and he is  
reſpected and admired more for the variety, inge-  
nuity, and utility of his handiworks, than for  
the antiquity of his family. They are pleaſed

of the Americans, one of them would think  
himſelf more obliged to a genealogiſt, who  
could prove for him that his anceſtors and re-  
lations for ten generations had been plough-  
men, ſmiths, carpenters, turners, weavers, tan-  
ners, or even ſhoemakers, and conſequently  
that they were uſeful members of ſociety ; than  
if he could only prove that they were gentle-  
men, doing nothing of value, but living idly  
on the labour of others, mere fruges conſumere  
nati *, and otherwiſe good for nothing, till by  
by their death, their eſtates, like the carcaſe  
of the negro&#x27;s gentleman-hog, come to be  
cut up. | |  
  
With regard to encouragements for ſtrangers  
from government, they are really only what  
are derived from good laws and liberty. Stran-  
gers are welcome becauſe there is room enough  
for them all, and therefore the old inhabitants  
are not jealous of them; the laws protect them  
ſufficiently, ſo that they have no need of the  
| patronage of great men; and every one will en-  
joy ſecurely the profits of his induſtry. But if  
he does not bring a fortune with him, he muſt

In ſhort, America is the land of labour, and by  
no means what the Engliſh call Zubberland,  
and the French Pays de Cocagne, where the

where the fowls fly about ready roaſted, cry-

Who then are the kind of perſons to whom  
an emigration to America may be advantage-  
ous? And what are the N they may  
reaſonably expect?  
  
Land being cheap in that country, from the  
  
  
likely to be occupied in an age to come, inſo-  
  
  
fertile ſoil full of wood may be obtained near  
the frontiers, in many places, for eight or ten  
guineas, hearty young labouring men, who  
  
  
which 1s nearly the ſame in that country as in  
Europe, may eaſily eſtabliſh themfelves there.  
A little money ſaved of the good wages they re-  
ceive there while they work for others, enables  
  
  
in which they are affiſted by the good will of  
  
their neighbours, and ſome credit. Multitudes  
1 of  
  
  
land, and Germany, have by this means in a  
few years become wealthy farmers, who in their  
own countries, where all the lands are fully oc-  
  
  
ver have .emerged from the mean condition  
wherein they were born. ;  
From the falubrity of the air, the healthi-  
neſs of the climate, the plenty of good provi-  
ſions, and the encouragement to early marriages,  
by the certainty of ſubſiſtence in cultivating the  
earth, the increaſe of inhabitants by natural ge-  
neration 1s very rapid in America, and becomes  
  
  
there is a continual demand for more artiſans of  
all the neceſſary and uſeful kinds, to ſupply  
thoſe cultivators of the earth with houſes, and  
with furniture and utenfils of the groſſer ſorts,  
  
  
Tolerably good workmen in any of thoſe me-  
chanic arts, are ſure to find employ, and to be  
well paid for their work, there being no re-  
ſtraints preventing ſtrangers from exerciſing  
any art they underſtand, nor any permiſſion ne-  
ceſſary. If they are poor, they begin firſt as  
tervants or journeymen; and if they are ſober,  
induſtrious, and frugal, they ſoon become maſ-  
ters, eſtabliſh themſelves in buſineſs, marry,  
  
raiſe familes, and become reſpectable citizens.  
Alſo, perſons of moderate fortunes and ca-  
pitals, who having a number of children to

rica, which Europe does not afford, There  
they may be taught and practiſe profitable me-  
chanic arts, without incurring difgrace on that  
account ; but on the contrary acquiring reſpect  
by ſuch abilities. There ſmall capitals laid out  
in lands, which daily become more valuable by  
the increaſe of people, afford a folid proſpect of  
ample fortunes thereafter for thoſe children,  
  
The writer of this has known ſeveral inſtances  
of large tracts of land, bought on what was then  
the frontier of Pennſilvania, for ten pounds per  
hundred acres, which, after twenty years, when  
  
the ſettlements had been extended far beyond  
  
them, fold readily, without any improvement  
  
made upon them, for three pounds per acre.  
  
The acre in America is the ſame with the Eng-  
  
liſh acre, or the acre of Normandy.  
  
Thoſe who deſire to underſtand the ftate of  
government in America, would do well to read  
the conſtitutions of the ſeveral ſtates, and the  
articles of confederation that bind the whole  
together for general purpoſes, under the direc-  
tion of one aflembly called the Congreſs. Theſe  
conſtitutions have been printed by order of  
Congreſs, in America; two editions of them  
have alſo been printed in London ; and a good  
tranſlation of them into French, has lately been  
publiſhed at Paris.

producing all commodities and manufaQtures  
within their own dominions, ſo as to diminiſh  
or render uſeleſs their importations, have en-  
deavoured to entice workmen from other coun-  
tries, by high ſalaries, privileges, &amp;c. Many  
  
perſons pretending to be ſkilled in various great  
manufactures, imagining that America muſt be  
  
  
probably be diſpoſed to imitate the princes  
above-mentioned, have propoſed to go over, on  
condition of having their paſſages paid, lands  
given, ſalaries appointed, excluſive privileges  
for terms of years, &amp;c. Such perſons, on read-  
ing the articles of confederation, will find that  
the Congreſs have no power committed to them,  
or money put into their hands, for ſuch pur-  
poſes ; and that if any ſuch encouragement 1s  
given, it muſt be by the government of ſome  
ſeparate ſtate. This, however, has rarely been  
done in America ; and when it has been done,  
it has rarely ſacreede ſo as to eſtabliſh a  
manufacture, which the country was not yet  
  
  
to ſet it up; labour being generally too dear  
there, and hands difficult to be kept toge-  
ther, every one deſiring to be a maſter, and  
the cheapneſs of land inclining many to leave  
trades for agriculture. Some indeed have met  
with er and are carried on to ad van-  
tage; but they are generally ſuch as require  
only a few hands, or wherein great part of the  
work 1s periormngs by machines. Goods that  
  
. — Al

are bulky, and of ſo ſmall value as not well to  
bear the expence of freight, may often be made  
cheaper in the country than they can be im-  
  
orted ; and the manufacture of ſuch goods  
will be profitable wherever there 1s a ſufficient  
demand. The farmers in America produce in-  
deed a good deal of wool and flax ; and none 1s  
exported, it is all worked up; but it is in the  
way of domeſtic manufacture for the uſe of the  
family. The buying up quantities of wool and  
flax, with the deſign to employ ſpinners, wea-  
vers, &amp;c, and form great eſtabliſhments, pro-  
ducing quantities of linen and woollen goods  
for ſale, has been ſeveral times attempted in -  
  
  
nerally failed, goods of equal value being im-  
ported cheaper. And when the governments  
have been ſolicited to ſupport ſuch ſchemes by  
encouragements, in money, or by impoſing du-  
ties on importation of ſuch goods, it has been  
generally refuſed, on this principle, that if the  
country 1s ripe for the manufacture, it may be  
carried on by private perſons to advantage; and  
if not, it is a folly to think of forcing nature.  
Great eſtabliſhments of manufacture, require  
great numbers of poor to do the work for ſmall  
wages ; thoſe poor are to be found in Europe,  
but will not be found in America, till the  
lands are all taken up and cultivated, and the  
exceſs of people who cannot get land want  
employment. The manufacture of filk, they  
ſay, is natural in France, as that of cloth in  
  
| England,  
  
*

England, becauſe each country produces in  
plenty the firſt material : but if England will  
have a manufacture of filk as well as that of  
cloth, and France of cloth as well as that of  
. filk, theſe unnatural operations muſt be, ſup-  
ported by mutual prohibitions, or high duties  
on the importation of each others goods ; by  
which means the workmen are enabled to tax  
the home conſumer by greater prices, while the  
higher wages they receive makes them neither  
happier nor richer, ſince they only drink more  
and work leſs. Therefore the governments in  
America do nothing to encourage ſuch projects.  
The people, by this means, are not impoſed  
on, either by the merchant or mechanic; if the  
merchant demands too much profit on import-  
ed ſhoes, they buy of the ſhoemaker ; and if he  
| aſks too high a price, they take them of the  
merchant : thus the two profeſſions are checks  
on each other. &#x27;The ſhoemaker, however, has,  
on the whole, a conſiderable profit upon his  
labour in America, beyond what he had in Eu-  
rope, as he can add to his price a ſum nearly  
equal to all the expences of freight and com-  
miſſion, riſque or inſurance, &amp;c. neceſſarily  
charged by the merchant. And the caſe is the  
ſame with the workmen in every other mechanic  
art. Hence it 1s, that artiſans generally live  
better and more eaſily in America than in Eu-  
rope; and ſuch as are good œconomiſts, make  
a comfortable proviſion for age, and for their  
| children.

Hence the youth are dragged up in ignorance  
of every gainful art, and obliged to become ſol-  
diers or ſervants, or thieves, for a ſubſiſtence.  
  
In America, the rapid increaſe of inhabitants  
takes away that fear of rivalthip, and artiſans  
willingly receive apprentices from-the hope of  
profit by their labour, during the remainder of  
the time ſtipulated, after they ſhall be inſtruct-  
ed. Hence it is eaſy for poor families to get  
their children inſtructed; for the artiſans are ſo  
deſirous of apprentices, that many of them will  
even give money to the parents, to have boys  
from ten to fifteen years of age bound appren-  
tices to them, till the age af twenty-one; and  
many poor parents have, by that means, on their  
arrival in the country, raiſed money enough to  
buy land ſufficient to eſtabliſh themſelves, and  
to ſubſiſt the reſt of their family by agricul-  
ture, Theſe contracts for apprentices are made  
before a magiſtrate, who regulates the agree-

and that he ſhall be well inſtructed in the art  
or profeſſion of his maſter, or ſome other, by  
which he may afterwards gain a livelihood, and  
be able in his turn to raiſe a family. A copy  
of this indenture is given to the apprentice or  
his friends, and the magiſtrate keeps a record  
of it, to which recourſe may be had, in caſe of

employment are great preſervatives of the mo-

mily among them, flrangers of birth  
muft be greatly refpetted, and of  
courfe eafily obtain the bef of thofe  
offices, which will make all their for-  
tunes; that the governments, too,  
to encourage emigrations from Eu-  
rope, not only pay the expenfe of  
erfonal tranfportation, but give  
feed gratis to itrangers, with negroes  
to work for them, utenfils of huf-  
bandry, and flocks of catile. Thefe  
are all wild imaginations : and thofe  
who go to America, with expetta-  
tions founded on them, will furely  
be difappointed,  
  
The truth is, that though there  
are, in that country, few people fo  
miferable as the poor of Europe—  
there are alfo very few that in Eu.  
rope would be called rich. It is ra-  
ther a general happy mediocrity that  
prevails, There are few great pro-  
prietors of the foil, and few tenants,  
Moft people cultivate their own  
lands, or follow fome handicraft or  
merchandife—very few rich enough  
to live idle upon their rents or in-  
comes; or to pay the high prices  
given in Europe, for painting, fla-  
tues, architecture, and the other  
works of art, that are more curious  
  
«shan ufeful, Hence, the natural ge-  
  
niufes, that have arifen in America,  
with fuch talents, have uniformly  
quitted that country for Europe,  
where they can be more fuiabdly  
  
  
  
Rig  
  
rewarded. It is true that letters and  
mathematical knowledge are in ef-  
teem there : but they are atthe fame  
time more common than is appre-  
hended ; there being already exifting  
mine colleges of univerfities, viz.  
four in New England, and one in  
each of the provinces of New York,  
New Jerfey, Pennfylvania, Mary-  
land, and Virginia, all furnifhed  
with learned profellors; befides a  
number of {maller academies: thefe  
educate many of their youth in the  
languages, and thofe feiences that  
qualify men for the profeflions of  
divinity, law, or phytic. Strangers,  
indeed, are by no means excluded  
from exercifing thofe profeffions ; and  
the quick increafe of inhabitants  
every where, gives them a chance of  
employ, which they have in common  
with the natives. Of civil offices or  
employments, there are few ; no fu-  
erfluous ones as in Europe: and it  
1s a-rule eftab! fhed in fome of the  
fiates, that no office fhould be fo pro-  
fable as to make it defirable. The  
  
a6th article of the confiution of  
  
ennfylvania, runs exprefsly in thefe  
words : ‘* As every freeman, to pre-  
ferve his independence (if he has not  
a fufhicient eflate) ought to have fome  
profeliion, caliing, trade, or farm,  
whereby he may honeflly fubfift,  
there can be no neceflity for, nor ufe  
in, efablifhing offices of profit ; the  
ufual effeéts of which are Siacadetas  
and fervilitv, unbecoming freemen,  
in the pofleffors and expeétants ; fac-  
tion, Contention, corruption, and dif-  
order among the people. Wherefore  
whenever an office, through increafe  
of fees or otherwife, becomes fo pro-  
fitable as to eccafion many to apply  
for it, the profits cught to be leflened  
by the legiflature.’’  
  
Thefe ideas prevailing more or lefs  
in all the united flates, it cannot be  
worth any man’s while, who has a  
means of living at home, to expatri-  
ate himfelf in hopes of obtaining a  
  
profitable civil office in America ; and

ently, fe thatthey have no need of  
the patronage of great men; and  
every one will enjoy fecurely the  
profits of his mduiiry, But if he does  
not bring a fortune with him, he  
muft work, and be induflrious, to  
hve. One or two years refidence  
give him all the rights of a citizen:  
but the government does not at pre-  
fent, whaiever it may have done in  
former times, hire people to become  
fettlers, by paying their paffages,  
giving land, negroes, utenfils, flock,  
or any other kind of emolument  
whatfoever., In fhort; America ts the  
Jand of jabour, and by no means  
what the Englith call lubberland,  
and the French pays de cocagne,  
where the ftreets are faid to be paved  
with half peck loaves, the heufes  
tiled with pancakes, and where the  
fowls fly about ready roafled, cry-  
ing, ** come eat me !”’  
  
Who then are the kind of perfons  
to whom an enngration to America  
may be advantageous ? And what are  
the advantages they may realonably  
expect ?  
  
Land being cheap im that country,  
from the vail foreils tii] void of in-  
habitants, and not likely to be occu-  
pied in aa age to come, infomuch  
that the property of an handredacres  
of fertile foil, full of wood, may be  
obtained near the frontiers in many  
places, for eight or ten guineas, hear-  
ty, young, labouring men, who under-  
fiand the hufbandry of corn and cat-  
tle, which is nearly the fame 1m that  
country as in Europe, may eafily ef-  
tablith themfelves there, A little imo-  
  
ney, faved of the good wages they re-  
ceive there while they work fog  
others, enables them to buy the laad  
‘and begin their plantation, in which  
they are allilied by the good will of  
their neighbours, and iome credit,  
Multitudes of poor peopie from Eng-  
land, Ireland, Scotland; and Germa-  
ny, have, by this means, in a few  
years, become wealthy farmers, who  
in their own countries, where ail the  
ar are fully occupied, and the  
wages of labour low, could never  
have emerged from the mean conditi-  
on wherein ihey were born,  
  
From the falubrity of the air, the  
healihinefs of the climate, the pienty  
of geod provifions, and the encou-  
ragement to early marriages, by the  
certainty of fubhitence in cultivaiing  
the earth, the increafe of mhab:nans  
by natural generation 1s very rapid  
in America, and becomes ft:!! more  
fo by the atcelhon of flrangers.  
Hence there ts aconiinual demand for  
more arttians of all the neceflary and  
Gieful kinds, to fupply thofe cultiva-  
tors of the earth with houfis, and  
with furniwure and uterhi!s of the  
grofler forts, which cannot fo well be  
brought frem Europe. Tolerably  
good workmen in any of thofe me-  
chamie aris, are jure to find employ  
and to be well paid for their work.  
there being no reflra:nts preventing  
ilrangers from exercifing any art  
they underfland, nor any perimiflion  
necefiary, If they are poor, they be-  
gin fifl as fervants or journeymen j

and frugal, tiey fo@a become xn inka

on that aceount ; but on the conirary  
acquiring refpett by their abilities.  
Their finall capitals, laid out in laods,  
which daily SR oeene more valuable  
by the increafe of people, afford a  
folid profpeét of ample fortune there-  
after for thofe children. The writer  
of this has known feveral inflances of  
large traQls of land, bought on whar  
was then the frontiers of Pennfylva-  
pia, for ten pounds per hundred  
acres, which, after twenty years,  
when the fetrlements had been ex-  
sended far beyond them, fold readily  
without any improvement made up-  
on them, for three pounds per acre.  
The acre in America is the fame  
with the Englith acre, or the acre of  
Normandy, —  
  
‘Thofe who defire to underfland  
the fate of government in America,  
would do well to read the conflitun-  
ons of the feveral flaces, and the arti-  
cles of confederation that bind the  
whole together for .general purpofes,  
under the direftion of one allembly  
called the congrefs, Thefe conftiw-  
tions have been printed by order of  
congrefs in America: two editions  
of them have alfo been printed in  
London: and a good tranflation of  
them into French, has lately been  
publithed at Paris.  
  
Several of the princes of Europe  
having of late, from an opinion of  
advantage to arife by producing ail  
qethentitiin and manufattures within  
their own dominions, fo as to dimi-  
mith or render ufele{s their importa-

men from other countries, by  
high falaries, privileges, &amp;c.—many

Such perfons, on reading the articles

too dear there, and hands difhcwk to

to be a matier, and the cheapne(s of

for” agriculture, Some indeed have  
met with fuccefs, and are carned on  
to advantage : but they are generally  
fuch as require only a few hands, or  
wherein great part of the work is  
performed by machines. Goods thae  
are bulky, and of fo fmail value as  
not well to bear the ecxpenfe of  
freight, may often be made cheaper  
in the country than they can be ime  
ported ; and the manufatture of fuch  
goods will be profuable wherever  
there isa fufhcient demand. The far-  
mers in America produce indeed a  
good deal of peal and flax; and  
none is exported; « 1s all worked

counts; and that he thallbe well in-  
flructed in the art or profeflion of  
his matler, or in fome other, by  
which he may afterwards gain a live-  
hhood, and be able im his turn to  
raife a family. A copy of this in-  
denture is given to the apprentice or  
his friends, and the magiflrate keeps  
arecord of it, to which recourfe may  
be had, in cafe of failure by the maf-  
ter in any point of performance.  
This defire among the mailers to  
have more hands employed in work-  
ing for them, induces them to pay  
the paffages of young perfons, of both  
fexes, who on their arrival agree to  
ferve them one, two, three, or. four  
years; thofe, who have already learn-  
ed a trade, agreeing for a fhorter  
erm, in proportion to their {kill,  
and the confequent immediate vatue  
of their fervice ; and thofe who have  
none, agreeing fora longer term, in  
confideration of being taught an art  
their poverty would not permit them  
to acquire in their own couniry.  
  
The almoft general mediocrity of  
fortune that prevails in America,  
obliging ics people to follow fome  
bulinefs for fubfiftence, thofe vices  
that arife ufually from idlenefs, are  
in a great meafure prevented. Induf-  
try and conitant employment are  
great prefervatives e morals and  
virruc ofa nation, se bad exam-  
pies to youth are more rare in Ame-  
rea, which muft be a comfortable  
confideration to parents, To this may  
be iruly added, that ferious religion,  
under its various denominations, is  
net orly tolerated, but refpeéted and  
pratifed, Atheifmis unknown there ;  
anitdelity rare and fecret ; fo that per-  
fons may live to a great aye in that  
country without having their piety  
fhocked by meeting with either an

- © In the old, long ſettled countries of Europe (obſerves  
Dr. Franklin) all arts, trades, profeſſions, farms, &amp;c. are  
ſo full, that it is difficult for a poor man who has children,  
to place them, where they may gain, or learn to gain a  
decent livelihood. The artiſans, who fear creating future  
rivals in buſineſs, refuſe to take apprentices but upon condi-  
tions of money, maintenance, or the like, which the parents  
are unable to comply with. Hence the youth are too fre-  
  
uently dragged up in ignorance of every gainful art, and  
obliged to become ſoldiers, or ſervants, or thieves, for a  
ſubſiſtence. In America the rapid increaſe of inhabitants  
takes away that fear of rivalſhip, and artiſans willingly re-  
ceive apprentices from the hope of profit by their labour  
during the remainder of the time ſtipulated, after they ſhall be  
inſtructed. Hence it is eaſy for poor families to get their  
children inſtructed, for the artiſans are ſo deſirous of ap-  
prentices, that many of them will even give money to the  
parents to have boys from ten to fifteen years of age bound  
apprentices to them, till the age of twenty-one: and many  
poor parents have by that means, on their arrival in the  
country, raiſed money enough to buy land ſufficient to  
eſtabliſh themſelves, and to ſubſiſt the reſt of the family by  
agriculture. &#x27;Theſe contracts for apprentices are made be-  
fore a magiſtrate, who regulates the agreement according to  
reaſon and juſtice : and, having in view the formation of  
ſome uſeful citizen, obliges the maſter to engage by a written  
indenture, not only that during the time of ſervice ſti-  
pulated, the apprentice ſhall be duly provided with meat,  
drink, apparel, waſhing and lodging, and at its expiration  
with a complete ſuit of clothes; — but alfo that he ſhall be  
  
taught to read, write, and caſt accompts, and that he hal

INFORMATION TO THOSE WHO WOULD  
REMOVE TO AMERICA.  
  
ANY perſons in Europe having, directly, or  
| by letters, expreſſed to the writer of this,  
who is well acquainted with North America, their  
deſire of tranſporting and eſtabliſhing themſelves  
in that country; but who appear to him to have  
formed, through ignorance, miſtaken ideas and ex-  
pectations of what is to be obtained there; he  
thinks it may be uſeful, and prevent inconvenient,  
expenſive, and fruitleſs removals&#x27; and voyages of  
improper perſons, if he gives ſome clearer and tru-  
er notions of that pait of the warld, than have hi-  
therto prevailed.  
  
He finds it imagined by 3 that the i in  
habitants of North America are rich, capable of  
rewarding, and diſpoſed to reward, all ſorts of in-  
genuity; that they are at the ſame time ignorant  
of all the ſciences, and conſequently that rangers,  
poſſeſſing talents in the belles-lettres, fine arts, &amp;c. -  
muſt be highly eſteemed, and ſo well paid as to  
become eaſily rich themſel v es; that there are alſo  
abundance of profitable offices to be diſpoſed of,  
which. the natives are not qualified to All; ane! a  
that having few perſons of family among enn, |  
ſtrangers of birth muſt be greatly reſpected, and

which will make all .their fortunes”; ; that the go-  
vernments too, to encourage emigrations from Eu-

The truth is, that though there are in that coun-  
try few people ſo miſerable as the poor of Europe,  
there are alſo few that in Europe would be called  
rich: it is rather a general happy mediocrity that  
prevails. There are few great proprietors of the  
foil, and few tenants ; muſt people cultivate their  
own lands, or follow ſome handicraft or- merchan-  
  
  
in Europe for painting, ſtatues, architecture, and  
the other works of art that arc more curious than  
uſeful. Hence the natural geniuſes that have ari-

words: As every freeman, to preſerve his inde-

x unbecoming freemen, in the poſſeſſors and expec-  
  
tants ; faction, contention, corruption, and diſor-

1 office, through increaſe of fees or otherwiſe, be-  
comes ſo profitable as to occaſion many to apply

N Theſe ideas prevailing more or leſs in all the  
rs. Vnited States, it cannot be worth any man&#x27;s while,  
„ who has a means of living at home, to expatriate  
an  
  
himſelf in hopes of obtaining a profitable civil of-  
fice in America; and as to military offices,, they,  
d, are at an end with the war, the armies being diſ-  
  
K, banded. Much leſs is it adviſeable for a perſon to  
gl- go thither, who has no other quality to recommend  
les him but his birth. In Europe, it hasi ndeed its va-  
na- lue; but it is a commodity that cannot be carried  
ſcl- to a worſe market than to that of America, where  
vi-  
  
people do not enquire concerning a ſtranger, What  
  
it he? but What can be do? Ik he has any uſeful  
art, he is welcome; and if he exerciſes it, and be-  
  
haves well, he will be reſpected by all that know  
  
him; but a mere man of quality, who on that ac-  
count wants to live upon the public by ſome office

or falary, will be deſpiſed and 7 The  
 huſbandman is in honour there, and even the me-  
chaaic, becauſe their employments are uſeful. The  
people have a ſaying, that God Almighty is him-  
felf a mechanic, the greateſt in the univerſe ; and  
he is relpected and admired more for the variety,  
ingenuity, and utility of his handi works, than for  
  
  
the obſervation of a negro, and frequently mention  
n, that Boccarorra (meaning the white man) make  
de black man workee, make de horſe workee,  
make de ox workee, make ebery ting workee ; on-  
15 de hog. He de hog, no workee; be eat, he  
drink, he walk about, he go to ſleep when he pleaſe,  
he libb like a gentleman. According to theſe o-  
pinions of the Americans, one of them would think  
Himſelf more obliged ro a genealogiſt, who could  
prove for him that his anceſtors and relations for  
ten generations had been ploughmen, ſmiths, car-  
penters, turners, weavers, tanners, or even ſhoe-  
makers, and conſequently that they were uſeful  
members of ſociety ; than if he could only prove  
that they were gentlemen, doing nothing of value,  
but living idly on the labour of others, mere fruges

years become wealthy farmers, who in their own  
cquntries, where all the lands are fully occupied and  
the wages of labour low, could never have emerged  
from the mean condition wherein they were born.  
From the ſalubrity of the air, the healthineſs of  
the climate, the plenty of good proviſions, and  
tlie encouragement to early marriages, by the cer-  
tainty of ſubſiſtence in cultivating the earth, the  
increaſe of inhabitants by natural generation is  
very rapid in America, and becomes ſtill more ſo  
by the acceſſion of ſtrangers ; hence there is a con-  
tinual demand for more artiſans of all the neceſſa-  
ry and uſeful kinds, to ſupply thoſe cultivators of  
the earth with houſes, and with furniture and uten-  
fils of the groſſer ſorts, which cannot ſo well be  
brought from Europe. Tolerably good workmen  
in any of thoſe mechanic arts, are ſure to find em-  
ploy, and to be well paid for their work, there be-  
ing no reſtraints preventing ſtrangers from exerciſ-  
  
ing any art they underſtand, nor any permiſſion |  
neceſſary. If they are poor, they begin firſt as ſer-  
vants or journeymen ; and if they are ſober, induſ-  
trious, and frugal, they ſoon become maſters, eſta- ;  
bliſh themſelves in bufneſs, marry, raiſe families, c  
and become reſpectable citizens. t  
Alſo, perſons of moderate fortunes and capitals, \
who having a number of children to provide for, | »  
are defirous of bringing them up to induſtry, |  
and to ſecure eſtates for their poſterity, have tl  
opportunities of doing it in America, which Eu- t!  
rope does not afford. There they may, be taught tl  
and practiſe profitable mechanic arts, without in- 0

1 hoſe who defire to underſtand the ftate of go-  
vernment in America, would do well to read the  
conſtitutions of the ſeveral ſtates, and the articles  
of confederation that bind the whole together for  
  
eneral purpoſes, under the direction of one aſſem⸗  
ly, called the Congreſs. Theſe conſtitutions have  
been printed, by order of Congreſs, in America;  
two editions of them have alſo been printed in  
Londen ; and a good tranſlation of them into  
French, has lately been publiſhed at Paris.  
  
Several of the princes of Europe having of late,  
from an opinion of ad vantage to ariſe by produc=  
ing all commodities and manufactures within theit  
own dominions, ſo as to diminiſh or render uſeleſs  
their importations, have endeavoured. to entice  
wordt nen from other countries, by high ſalaries,  
privileges, &amp;c. Many perſons eie to bs  
ikilled in various great manufactures, imagining  
that America muſt be in want of them, and that  
the Congreſs would probably be diſpoſed to imitate

To as to eſtabliſh a manufacture, which the coun-  
try was not yet ſo ripe for as to encourage private  
  
erſons to ſet it up; labour being generally too dear  
there, and hands difficult to be kept together, eve-  
  
  
of land inclining many to leaye trades for agricul-  
ture. Some indeed have met with ſucceſs, and are  
carried on to advantage; but they are generally  
ſuch as require only a few hands, or wherein great  
part. of the work is performed by machines. Goods  
that are bulky, and of ſo ſmal] value as not well  
to bear the expence of freight, may often be made  
cheaper i in the country, than ny: can be import-  
ed; and the manufacture of ſuch goods will. be  
profitable whereyer there is a ſufficient demand.  
The farmers in America produce indeed a- good  
deal of wool and flax; and none is exported, it is  
all worked up; but it is in the way of domeſtic  
inanufacture, for the uſe of the family. The buy-  
ing up quantities of wool and flax, with the deſign  
to employ ſpinners, weavers, &amp;c. and form great  
elkabliſhments, producing quantities of linen and  
woollen goods for ſale, has been ſeveral times at-  
tempted in different provinces ; but thoſe projets  
ave generally failed, goods of equal value being  
1mported cheaper. And when the governments  
have been ſolicited to ſupport ſuch ſchemes by en-

refuſed, on this principle, that if the country is ripe  
for the manufacture, it may be carried on by pri-  
vate perſons to advantage; and if not, it is a folly  
  
  
do the work for ſmall wages; thoſe poor are to  
be found in Europe, but will not be found in A-  
merica, till the lands are all taken up and cultivas  
ted, and the exceſs of people who cannot get land  
want employment. The manufacture of ſilk, th  
  
  
land, becauſe each country produces in plenty the  
firſt material; but if England will have a manu+  
facture of ſilk as well as that of cloth, and France  
of cloth as well as that of ſilk, theſe unnatural o-  
perations mult be ſupported by mutual probibiti-  
ons, or high duties on the importation of each  
other&#x27;s goods; by which means the workmen are  
enabled to tax the home conſumer by greater  
prices, while the higher wages they receive  
makes them neither happier nor richer, ſince  
  
  
are not impoled on, either by the mercbant or we-  
  
  
on imported ſhoes, they. buy of the ſhoemaker ;  
and if he aſks&#x27;too high a price, they take them —  
the merchant; thus che two profeſſions are checks  
on each other. The ſhoemaker, however, has, on  
  
  
America, beyond what he had in Europe, as he can  
add to his price a ſum nearly equal to all the ex-  
ee of freight and commifſion, riſque or 3nſar-

ande, &amp;c. neceſſarily pn? by the merchant.  
Auch it is the ſame with every other mechanic art.  
  
Hence it is, that artiſans generally live better and  
  
more eaſily i in America than in Europe; and ſuch  
us ate good œconomiſts make a comfortable pro-  
* viſion for age, and for their children, Such may,  
  
therefore, remove with advantage to America.  
  
In the old long-ſetiled countries of Europe, all  
arts, trades, profeſſions, farms, &amp;c. are ſo full, that  
it is difficult for a poor man who has children to li  
place them where they may gain, or learn to gain, I  
a decent livelihood, The artiſans, who fear cre- p  
_ ating future rivals in buſineſs, refuſe to take ap- r

nance, or the like, which the parents are unable  
to com ply with. Hence the youth are dragged up  
  
F wt ignorance of every gainful art, and obliged to tl  
become ſoldiers, or ſervants, or thieves, for a ſub- ſ  
| ſiftance. In America, the rapid increaſe of ihhabiz 0  
tants takes away that fear of rivalſhip, and artiſans re  
  
* willingly receive apprentices from the hope of pro- ir  
- fit by their labour, during the remainder af the- ir  
time ſtipulated, after they ſhall be inſtructed. h  
  
Hence it is eaſy for poor families to get their chil- Al  
dren inſtructed; for the artiſans are fo deſirous of n  
apprentices, that many of them will even give mo-  
  
nney to the parents, to have boys from ten to fifteen p.  
; years of age bound apprentices to them, till the” |} fo  
age vf twenty: one; and many poor parents haue, ul  
by that means, on their arrival in the country, raiſ- - ve  
  
ed money enough to buy land ſufficient to eſtabliſh gr  
themſelves, and to ſubſiſt the reſt of their family I tic  
by agriculture. Theſe contracts for apprentices in

ſtipulated, the apprentice ſhall be duly provided  
with meat, drink, apparel, waſhing, and lodging,  
and at its expiration with a complete new ſuit of  
clothes, but alſo that he ſhall be taught to read, .  
write, and caſt accounts; and that he ſhall be well  
inſtructed in the art or profeſſion of his maſter, or  
ſome other, by which he may aftgrwards gain a  
livelihood, and be able in his turn to raiſe a fami-  
ly. A copy of this indenture is given to the ap-  
prentice or his friends, and the magiſtrate keeps a  
record of it, to which recourſe may be had, in caſe |  
of failure by the maſter in any poiut of perform-  
ance. This deſire among the maſters to have more  
hands employed in work ing for them, induces  
them to pay the paſſages of young perſons, of both  
ſexes, who, on their arrival, agree to ſerve them N  
one, two, three, or four years : thoſe who have al-  
ready learned a trade, agreeing for a ſhorter term,  
in proportion to their kill, and the conſeguent 2  
immediate value of their ſervice ; ; and thoſe wha.  
have none, agreeing for a longer term, in conſider-  
ation of being taught an art their poverty would |

are all wild imaginations‘; and thofe who go to America with expec-  
tations founded upon them, will furely find? themnfelves difappointed.  
  
The truth is, thatthough there are in that country few people fo  
miferable as the poor of Raced, there are alfo very few that in Eu.  
rope would be called rich: it- is rather a general, happy mediocrity  
that prevails. ‘There are few great proprietors of the foil, and few te.  
nants ; moft people cultivate their own lands, or follow fome handi-  
craft or merchandife ; very few are rich enough to live idly upon their  
rents or incomes, or to pay the high prices given in Europe for  
painting, ftatues, architecture, and the other works of art that are  
more curious than ufeful. Hence, the natural geniufes that have arifen  
in America, with fuch talents, have uniformly quitted that country for  
Europe, where they can be more fuitably rewarded. It is true that let-  
ters and mathematical knowledge are in efteem there, bat they are at  
the fame time more common than is apprehended ; there being already  
exifting nine colleges, or univerfities, viz. four in New England, and  
one in each of the provinces of New York, New Jerfey, Pennfylvania,  
Maryland, and Virginia, all furnifhed with learned profeffors ; befides  
a number of fmaller academies; thefe educate many of their youth in  
the languages, and thofe fciences that qualify men for the profeffions  
of divinity, law, or phyfic. Strangers, indeed, are by no means ex-  
cluded from exercifing thofe profeffions ; and the quick increafe of in-  
habitants every where gives them a-chance of employ, which they have  
in common with the natives. P. 225.

\ FF ANY perſons in Europe having, directly or by let-  
VI ters, expreſſed to the writer of this, who is well  
acquainted with North America, their deſire of tranſport-  
ing and eſtabliſhing themſelves in that country; but who  
appear to him to have formed, through ignorance, mifta-  
ken ideas and expectations of what is to be obtained there;  
he thinks it may be uſeful, and prevent inconvenient, ex-  
  
penſive, and fruitleſs, removals and voyages of improper  
  
perſons, if he gives ſome clearer and truer notions of that  
part of the world than «7 ro to have hitherto prevailed.  
  
He finds it is imagined by numbers that the inhabitants  
ef North Amexica are rich, capable of rewarding and dif.  
poſed to rewarl all forts of &#x27; ingenuity ; that they are, at  
the ſame time, ignorant of all the ſciences; and, conſe-  
quently, that ſtrangers,  
tres, FA arts, &amp;c. muſt highly eſteemed, and fo well  
paid as to become eaſily rich themſelves; that there is  
alſo abundance of profitable offices to be diſpoſed of, which  
the natives are not qualified to fill; and that, having few  
perſons of family among them, oye dry birth muſt be  
greatly reſpected, and, of courſe, eaſily obtain the beſt of  
thoſe offices; which will make all their fortunes; that the  
governments too, to encourage emigrations from Europe,  
not only pay the expenſe of perſonal tranſportation, but  
give lands gratis to ſtrangers, with negroes to work for  
them, utenſils of huſbandry, and ſtocks of cattle.— Theſe  
are all wild imaginations: and thoſe, who go to America  
with expectations founded upon them, will ſurely find  
themſel ves diſappointed. e CETT  
  
The truth is, that, though there are in that country few  
people ſo miſerable as the poor of Europe, there are alſo  
very few that in Europe would be called rich. It is rather  
  
  
great proprietors of the toil, and few tenants; moſt peo-  
  
ple cultivate their own lands, or follow ſome handicraft or  
merchandiſe ; very few are rich enough to live id! upon  
their rents or incomes, or to pay the high prices given in  
  
Europe for paintings, ſtatues, architecture, and the other  
  
works of art that are more curious than uſeful. Hence  
  
the natural geniuſes that have ariſen in America, with ſuch  
  
talents, have uniformly quitted that country for Europe,  
  
where they can be more ſuitably rewarded. It is true, that  
  
letters wb  
  
  
V  
  
  
hended; there being already exiſting nine colleges, or u-  
niverſities, viz. four in New England, and one in each  
of the ſtates of New York, New Jerſey, Pennſylvania,  
Maryland, and Virginia; all furniſhed with learned pro-  
  
  
ducate many of their youth in the languages, and thoſe  
  
  
law, and phyſic. Strangers, indeed, are by no means  
  
excluded from ata, thoſe profeſſions ; and the increaſe  
  
of inhabitants every where gives them a chance of em-  
ploy, which they have in common with the natives. OF  
civil offices or employments, there are fe); no ſuperfluous:  
  
ones as in Europe: and it is a rule, eſtabliſhed in ſome of  
the ſtates, that no office ſhould be ſo profitable as to make  
  
it deſirable. The&#x27;36th article of the conſtitution of Penn-  
  
ſylvania runs expreſsly in theſe words: © As every free-  
  
man, to preſerve his independence, (if he has not a ſuf-  
«« ficient eſtate,) ought to have ſome profeſſion, calling,  
  
ce trade, or farm, whereby he may honeſtly ſubſiſt, there  
  
««. can be no neceſſity for, nor uſe in, eſtabliſhing offices of  
« profit; the uſual effects of which are dependence and  
re ſervility, unbecoming freemen, in the poſſeſſors and ex-  
«©. peants ; faction, contention, corruption, and diſor-  
«« der, among the people. - Wherefore, whenever -an of-  
ce fice, through increaſe of fees, or otherwiſe, becomes  
0 ſo-profitable as to occaſion many to apply for it, the pro-  
« fits ought to be leſſened by the legiſlature.”  
  
- Theſe ideas prevailing more or leſs in all the United  
States, it cannot be worth any man&#x27;s while, who has a  
means of living at home, to expatriate himſelf in hopes of  
obtaining a profitable civil office in America, And as to  
military offices, they are at an end with the war, the ar-  
mies being diſbanded. Much leſs is it adviſeable for a  
perſon to go thither Who has no other quality to recom-  
  
  
value; but it is a commodity that cannot be carried to a  
worſe market than to that of America, where N do  
not inquire, concerning a ſtranger, What is he ? but bat  
  
can he do? If he has any uſeful art he is welcome; and,  
if he exerciſes it and behaves well, he will be reſpected by  
all that know him. But a mere man of quality, who, on  
that account, wants to live upon the public, by ſome office  
  
  
Vs &amp;532.A.5,2.08  
  
th  
tha Almighty is himſelf a mechanic ; the greateſt in  
the univerſe: and he is reſpected and admired more for  
the variety, ingenuity, and utility, of his handiworks,  
than for the antiquity of his family. They are pleaſed  
with the obſervation of a negro, and frequently mention  
it; that Boccarorra (meaning the white man) make de  
black man workee, make de horſe workee, make de ox  
  
  
hog, no workee ; he eat, he drink, he walk about, he go  
to ſleep when he pleaſe, he libb like a gentleman. Ac-  
cording to theſe opinions of the Americans, one of them  
  
  
could prove for him that his anceſtors and relations for ten  
generations had been ploughmen, ſmiths, carpenters, tur-  
ners, weavers, or even ee 6 eng and, py;  
that they were uſeful members of ſociety, than if he could  
only prove that they were gentlemen, doing nothing of  
value, but living idly on the labour of others ; mere fruges  
camſumere nati s and otherwiſe good for nothing; till, by  
* their death, their eſtates, like the carcaſe of the negro&#x27;s  
gentleman-hog, come to be cut up. |  
With regard to encouragements to ſtrangers from go-  
vernment, they are really only what are derived from good  
laws and liberty. Strangers are welcome, becauſe there is  
room enough for them all, and therefore the old inhabitants  
are not jealous of them; the lays protect them ſufficiently,  
ſo that they have no need of the patronage of great men  
and every one will enjoy ſecurely the profits of his induſ-  
try. But, if he does not bring a fortune with him, he  
muſt work and be induſtrious to live. One or two years  
reſidence gives him all the rights of a citizen; but the  
government does not at preſent, whatever it may have  
done in former tines, hire people to become ſettlers, by  
paying their paſſages, giving land, negroes, utenſils, ſtock,  
or any other kind of emolument whatſoever. In ſhort,  
America is the land of labour, and by no means what the  
Engliſh call Lubberland, and the French, Pays de Cocagne ;  
where the ſtreets are ſaid to be paved with half-peck  
loaves; the hcuſes tiled with pancakes ; and where fowls  
fly about, ready roaſted, crying, Come, eat me.  
Who, then, are the kinds of perſons to whom an emi-  
gration to America may be advantageous? And what are  
the advantages they may reaſonably expect? |  
Land being cheap in that country, from the vaſt fo  
ſtill void of inhabitants, and not likely to be occupied in  
an age to come, (inſomuch, that the property of a hun-  
dred acres of fertile foil, full of wood, may be obtained  
near the frontiers, in many places, for eight or ten gui-

there. A little money, ſaved of the goed wages they re-  
ceive there while they work for others, enables them to buy  
the land and begin their plantation, in which they are at-  
filted by their neighbours and ſome credit. Multitudes of

poor people, from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Ger-  
many, have, by this means, in a few years become weal-  
thy farmers; who, in their own countries, where all the  
lands are fully occupied, and the wages of labour low,  
  
  
they were horn. Ele |  
  
rom the ſalubrity of the air, the healthineſs of the cli-  
mate, the plenty of good proviſions, and the encourage-  
ment to early 3 by the certainty of ſubſiſtence in  
cultivating the earth, the increaſe of inhabitants by natural  
generation is very rapid in America, and becomes ſtill  
more ſo by the acceſſion of ſtrangers. Hence there is a  
continual demand for more artiſans, of all the neceſſary and  
  
  
houſes, and with furniture and utenſils of the groſſer ſorts,  
which cannot ſo well be brought from Europe. Tolerably  
zood workmen, in any of thoſe mechanic arts, are ſure ta  
nd emplay, and to be well paid for their work ; there be-  
ing no reſtraints preventing ſtrangers from exerciſing any  
arts they underſtand, nor any permiſſion neceſſary. If they  
are poor, they begin firſt as ſervants or journeymen; and,  
if they are ſober, induſtrious, and frugal, they ſoon be-  
come maſters, eſtabliſh themſelves in buſineſs, marry, raiſe  
families, and become reſpectable citizens. | 5  
Alſo, perſons of moderate fortunes and capitals, who,  
having a number of children to provide for, are deſircus  
of bringing them up to induſtry, and of ſecuring eſtates for  
their poſterity, have opportunities of doing it in America  
which Europe does not afford. There they may be taught  
  
  
iſgrace on that account; but, on the contrary, acquiring  
  
  
lands, which daily become more valuable by the increaſe  
of people, afford a ſolid proſpe&amp; of ample fortunes here -  
after for thoſe children. The writer of this has known ſe-  
veral inſtances of large tracts of land, bought, on what  
was then tlie frontier of Pennſylvania, for ten pounds per  
  
  
ments had been extended far beyond them, ſold readily,  
without any improvement made upon. them, for three  
pounds per acre. The acre in America is the ſame with

ing their paſſages paid, lands given, ſalaries appointed, ex-  
clufive privileges for terms of years, &amp;c. Such perſons, on  
reading the articles of confederation, will find that Congreſs  
  
  
hands, for ſuch purpoſes. And that, if any ſuch encou-  
ragement is given, it muſt be by the government of ſome  
  
  
merica; and, when it has been done, it has rarely ſucceed-  
ed ſo as to eſtabliſh a manufacture, which the country was  
not yer ſo on for as to encourage private perſons to ſet it  
up; labour being generally too dear there, and hands dif-  
ficult to be kept together, every one deſiring to be a maſ-  
ter, and the cheapneſs of land inelining many to leave  
trades for agriculture. Some, indeed, have met with ſuc-  
ceſs, and are carried on to advantage; but they are gene-  
nerally. ſuch as require only a few hands, or wherein great  
  
  
are bulky, and of ſo ſmall value as not well to bear the  
expenſe of freight, may often be made cheaper in the  
country than they can be imported ; and the manufacture  
of ſuch goods will be profitable wherever there is a ſuffi-  
cient demand. The farmers in America produce, indeed,  
a deal of wool and flax; and none is exported, it is all  
  
  
for the uſe of the family. The buying up quantities of  
wool and flax, with the defigh to employ 5  
  
vers, &amp; c. and form great eſtabliſhments, producing quan-  
tities of linen and woollen goods for fale, has been ſeveral  
times attempted in different provinces; but thoſe projects  
have generally failed, goods of equal value being import-  
ed chea ernments have 2 ſoli-  
  
8 per. And, when the  
cited to ſupport ſuch ſchemes, by encouragements in mo-  
  
  
goods, it has generally refuſed, on this principle,  
that, if the country is ripe for the manufacture, it may  
be carried on by rags perſons to advantage; and, if not,  
it is a folly to think of forcing nature. phe eftabliſh-  
manufacture require great numbers of poor to do  
  
pe, but will not be found in America till the lands are  
all taken up and cultivated, and the exceſs of people, who  
cannot get land, want employment. The manufacture of  
filk, they fay, is natural in France, as that of cloth in En-  
gland, becauſe each country produces in plenty the firſt  
material. But, if England will have a manufacture of ſilk  
as well as that of cloth, and Prance one of cloth as well as  
that of ſilk; theſe unnatural operations muſt be ſupported  
by mutual prohibitions, or high duties on the importation  
of each other&#x27;s goods; by which means, the workmen are  
enabled to tax tae home-conſumer by greater prices, while  
the higher wages they receive make them neither happier  
nor richer, ſince they only drink more and work leſs.  
Therefore, the goveraments in America do nothing to en-  
  
3  
  
  
5  
  
  
the merchant demands too much pront on unporticu mocs;  
they buy of the ſhoemaker ; and, if he aſks too high a  
price, they take them of the merchant. Thus the two  
rofeflions are checks on each other. The ſhoemaker,  
  
owever, has, on the whole, a conſiderable profit on his  
labour in America, beyond what he had in Europe; as he  
can add to his price a ſum nearly equal to all the expenſes  
of freight and commiſſion, riſk, or inſurance, &amp;c. neceſ-  
farily —.— by the merchant. And the caſe is the ſame  
with the workmen in every other mechanic art. Hence it  
is, that artiſans generally live better and more eafily in  
America than in Europe; and ſuch as are good econo-  
miſts make a comfortable proviſion for age and for their  
children. Such may, therefore, remove with advantage  
to America,  
  
In the old long-ſcttled countries of E „all arts,  
trades, profeſſions, farms, &amp;c. are ſo full, that it is difficult  
for a poor man, who has children, to place them where  
they may gain, or learn to gain, a decent livelihood.  
The artiſans, who fear creating future rivals in buſineſs,  
refuſe to take apprentices but upon conditions of money,  
maintenance, or the like, which the parents are unable to  
comply with. Hence the youth are dragged up in igno-  
rance of every gainful art, and obliged to become ſoldiers,  
ſervants, or thieves, for a ſubſiſtence. In America, the  
rapid increaſe of inhabitants takes away that fear of rival-  
ſhip, and artiſans willingly receive apprentices for the hope  
of profit by their labour, during the remainder of the time  
ſtipulated, after they ſhall be inſtructed. Hence it is eaſy  
for poor families to get their children inſtructed; for, the  
artiſans are ſo defirous of apprentices, that many of them  
will even give money to the parents to have boys, from ten  
to fifteen years of age, bound apprentices to them till the  
age of twenty-one ; and many poor parents have, by that  
means; on their arrival in the country, raiſed money e-  
  
  
| the reft of their family by agricalture. &quot;Theſe con-  
tracts for apprentices are made before a magiſtrate, who  
regulates the agreement according to reaſon and juſtice ;  
— having in view the formation of a future uſeful ci-  
tizen, obliges the maſter to engage, by a written inden-  
ture, not only that, during the time of ſervice ſtipulated,  
the apprentice ſhall be duly provided with meat, drink,  
apparel, waſhing, and lodging, and at its expiration with  
a complete ſuit of clothes, but alſo that he ſhall be tauglit  
to read, write, and caſt accounts; and that he ſhall be well  
inſtructed in the art and profeſſion of his maſter, or ſome  
other, by which he may afterwards gain a livelihood, and  
be able, in his turn, to raiſe a family. A copy of this in-  
  
depture is given to the apprentice or his friends, and the  
magiſtrate keeps a record of it, to which recourſe may be  
had. in caſe of failure by the maſter in any point of per-  
  
formance. This defire among the maſters, to have more  
  
  
  
quent immediate value of their ſervice; and thoſe, who  
Hape Hans... agreaing-for a longer term. in conſideration of  
ing taught an art their poverty would not permit them,  
to acquire in their own country.  
The r mediocrity of fortune that prevails  
in America obliging its people to follow ſome buſineſs. for  
1 thoſe vices, that ariſe uſually from idleneſs,  
are in a great meaſure prevented. Induſtry and conſtant  
employment are great preſervatives of the morals and vir-  
tue of. a nation. Hence bad examples to youth are more  
rare in America, which muſt be a comfortable conſidera-  
tion to parents. To this may be truly added, that ſerious  
religion, under its. various denominations, is not only to-  
lerated, but r and practiſed. Atheiſm is unknown  
there, infidelity rare and ſecret ; ſo that perſans may live  
to a great age in that country without having their piety  
ſhocked. by meeting with either an atheiſt or an infidel.  
And the Divine Being ſeems to have manifeſted his appro-  
bation of the mutual forbearance and kindneſs with which  
the different ſects treat each other, by the remarkable  
proſperity with which he has been pleaſed to favour the  
whole country, _ A | &gt; LY p

Several of the princes of Europe, of late, from an opi-  
nion of advantage to arise by producing all commodities  
and manufactures within their own domirtiions, have endea-  
vored to entice workmen ffom other countries by high sala-  
rres, privileges,&amp;c. Many persons, pretending to be skill-  
ed in various great manufactures, imagining that America  
must be in want of them, and that the Congress would pro-  
bably be disposed to imitate the&gt; princes abovementioned,  
have proposed to go over, on condition of having their pas-  
sages paid, lands given, salares appointed, exclusive privi-  
leges for terms of years, &amp;c. Such persons, on reading  
the articles of confederation, will find, that the Congress  
have no power commuitted to them, or money put into their  
hands, for such purposes, and that if any such encourage-  
ment is given, it must be by the government of some sepa-  
rate state. This, however, has rarely been done in Ame-  
rica; and when it has been dove, it has rarely succeeded,  
so as to establish a manufacture, which the country was  
not yet so ripe for as to encourage private persons to set it  
up; labor being generally too dear there, and hands difh-  
cult to be kept together, every one desiring to be a master,  
and the cheapness of land inclining many to leave trades  
for agriculture. Some indeed have met with success, and  
are carried on to advantage ; but they are generally such as  
require only a few hands, or wherein a great part of the  
work is formed by machines. Goods that are bulky, and  
of so small value as not well to bear the expense of freight,  
may often be made cheaper in the country than they can  
be imported; and the manufacture of such goods will be  
profitable wherever there is sufficient demand. The farm-  
ers in America produce indeed a good deal of wool and  
flax; and none is exported, it is all worked up; but it is  
in the way of domestic manufacture, for the use of the fa-  
mily. The buying up quantitiesof wool and flax, with the  
  
design to employ spinners, weavers, &amp;c. and form great es-  
  
tablishments, producing quantities of line. and woollen  
  
goods for sale, has been several times attempted in differ-  
ent provinces; but those projects have generally failed,  
And  
when the governments have been solicited to support  
such schemes by encouragements, in money, or by impos-  
ing duties on importation of such goods, it has been gene-  
rally refused, on this principle, that if the country is ripe  
fer the manufacture, it may be carried on by private per-  
sows to advantage; and if not, it is a folly to think of  
Great establishments of manufacture re-  
quire great numbers of the poor to do the work for small

be found in America, till the lands are al] taken up and

Pie finds,it is imagined by bers, that the inhabitants of  
North America are rich, capable of r ling, and disposed  
to reward, all sorts of ingenuity: that they are at the same  
time ignorant of all the an juently that stran-  
gers, possessing talents in the belles lettres, fine arts, &amp;c.  
must be highly esteemed, and so well paid as to become easily  
rich themselves ; that there are also abundance of profitable  
offices to be disposed of which the natives are not qualified to  
fill; and that having few persons of cows | among them,  
strangers of birth must be greatly respected, and of course  
easily obtain the best of those olfices, which will make all  
their fortunes; that the governments too, to encourage emi-  
grations from Europe, not only pay the expense of personal  
transportation, but give lands gratis to strangers, with negroes  
to work for them, utensils for husbandry, and stocks of cattle,  
These are all wild imaginations ; and those who go to Ame-  
rica with expectations founded upon them, will surely find  
themselves disappointed.  
  
The truth is, that though there are in that country few peo-  
le so miserable as the poor of Europe, there are also very  
be that in Europe would be called rich ; it is rather a gene-  
ral happy mediocrity that prevails. There are few great pro-

are not jealous of them; the laws protect them sufficiently,  
so that they have no need of the patronage of great men;  
and every one will enjoy securely the profits of his industry.  
But if he does not bring a fortune with him, he must work  
and be industrious to live. One or two years’ residence  
give him all the rights of a citizen ; but the government does  
not at present, whatever it may have done in former times,  
hire people to become settlers, by paying their age, give  
ing land, negroes, utensils, stock, or any other kind of emo-  
lument whatsoever. In short, America is the land of labor;  
and by no means what the English call Lubberland, and the  
French Pays de Cocagne, where the streets are said to be  
paved with half-peck loaves, the houses tiled with pan-cakes,  
and where the fowls fly about ready roasted, crying, Come  
eat me!  
  
Who then are the kind of persons to whom an emigration  
to America may be advantageous? And what are the ad-  
vantages they may reasonably expect ?  
  
Land being cheap in that country, from the vast forests  
still void of habitants, and not likely to be occupied in an  
age to come, insomuch that the property of a hundred acres  
of fertile soil, full of wood, may be obtained near the fron-  
tiers, in many places, for eight or ten guineas, hearty youn  
laboring men, who understand the husbandry of corn an  
cattle, which is nearly the same in that country as in Eu-  
rope, may easily establish themselves there. A little money,  
saved of the good wages they receive there while they work  
for others, enables them to buy the land and begin their  
plantation, in which they are assisted by the good-will of

their own lands, or follow some handicraft or merchandise ;  
very few rich enough to live idly upon their rents or incomes,  
orto pay the high prices given in Europe for painting, statues,  
architecture, and the other works of art that are more curious  
than useful. Hence the natural geniuses that have arisen in  
America, with such talents, have uniformly quitted that coun-  
try for Europe, where they can be more suitably rewarded.  
It is true that letters and mathematical knowledge are in es-  
teem there, but they are at the same time more common than  
is apprehended ; there being already existing nine colleges,  
or universities, viz. four in New England, and one in each of  
the provinces of New-York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,  
Maryland, and Virginia—all furnished with learned profes-  
sors; besides a number of smaller academies ; these educate  
many of their youth in the languages, and those sciences that  
qualify men for the professions of divinity, law, or physic.  
Strangers, indeed, are by no means excluded from exercising  
those professions ; and the quick increase of inhabitants every  
where gives them a chance of employ, which they have in  
common with the natives. Of civil offices or employments,  
there are few ; no superfluous ones, as in Europe; and it is a  
rule established in some of the States that no office should be  
so profitable as to make it desirable. The 36th article of the  
constitution of Pennsylvania runs expressly in these words :  
‘ As every freeman, to preserve his independence (if he has  
not @ sufficient estate), ought to have some profession, call-  
mg, trade, or farm, whereby he may honestly subsist, there  
can be no necessity for, nor use in establishing, offices of pro-  
fit; the usual effects of which are dependence and servility,  
unbecoming freemen, in the possessors and expectants ; fac-  
tion, contention, corruption, and disorder among the people.  
Wherefore, whenever an office through increase of fees or  
otherwise, becomes so profitable as to occasion many to ap-  
ply for it, the profits ought to be | d by the legislature,’  
These ideas prevailing more or less in the United States,  
it cannot be worth any man’s while, who has a means of liv-  
ing at home, to expatriate himself in hopes of obtaining a pro-  
fitable civil office in America ; and as to military offices, they  
are at an end with the war, the armies being disbanded,  
Much less is it advisable for a person to go thither, who has  
no other quality to recommend him than his birth. In Europe  
it has indeed its value ; but it is a commodity that cannot be  
carried to a worse market than to that of America, where  
people do not inquire concerning a stranger, What is he ? but  
What can he do? If he has any useful art, he is welcome ;  
and if he exercises it, and behaves well, he will be respected  
by all that know him; but a mere man of quality, who on  
that account wants to live upon the public by some office or  
salary, will be despised and « Leamguetiede The husbandman  
is in a there, and even the mechanic, because their em-  
ployments are useful. The people have a saying, that God  
Almighty is himself a mechanic, the greatest in the universe ;  
and he is respected and admired more for the variety, inge-  
nuity, and utility of his handicraft works, than for the anti-  
quity of his family. They are pleased with the observation  
of a negro, and frequently mention it, that Boccarorra (mean-  
ing the white man) make de black man workee, make de  
horse workee, make de ox workee, make ebery ting workee,  
only de hog. He, de hog, no workee; he eat, he drink, he  
walk about, he go to sleep when he please, he libb like a gen-  
tleman. According to these opinions of the Americans, one  
of thens would think himself more obliged to a genealogist,  
who could prove to him that his ancestors and relations for  
ten generations had been ploughmen, smiths, carpenters,  
turners, weavers, tanners, or even shoemakers, and conse-  
quently that they were usefial members of society ; than if he  
  
  
  
could only prove that they wete gentlemen, doing nothing of  
  
value, but living idly on the labors of others, mere fruges con-  
sumere nati,* and otherwise good for nothing, till by their  
death their estates, like the carcass of the negro’s gentleman-  
hog, come to be cut up.  
  
With regard to encouragements for strangers from go-  
vernment, they are really only what are derived from good  
laws and liberty. Strangers are welcome, because there is  
room enough for them all, and therefore the old inhabitants

their neighbors, and some credit. Multitudes of poor people  
from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Germany, have by  
this means in a few years become wealthy farmers, who in  
their own countries, where all the lands are fully occupied,  
and the wages of labor low, could never have emerged from  
the mean condition wherein they were born.  
  
From the salubrity of the air, the healthiness of the cli-  
mate, the plenty of good provisions, and the encouragement  
to early marriages, by the certainty of subsistence in culti+  
vating the earth, the increase of inhabitants by natural gene  
ration is very rapid in America, and becomes still more so,  
by the accession of strangers: hence there is a continual  
demand for more artisans of all the necessary and usefu.  
kinds, to supply those cultivators of the earth with houses,  
and with furniture and utensils of the grosser sorts, which  
cannot so well be brought from Europe. Tolerably good  
workmen in any of those mechanic arts, are sure to find  
employ, and to be well paid for their work, there being no  
restraints preventing strangers from exercising any art they  
understand, nor any permission necessary. If they are poor,  
they begin first as servants or journeymen ; and if they are  
sober, industrious, and frugal, they soon become masters,  
establish themselves in business, marry, raise families, and  
become respectable citizens.  
  
Also, persons of moderate tamilies and capitals, who, hav-  
ing a number of children to provide for, are desirous of bring-  
ing them up to industry, and to secure estates to their pos-  
terity, have opportunities of doing it in America, which Eu-  
rope does not afford. There they may be taught and prac-  
tise profitable mechanic arts, without incurring disgrace on  
that account: but, on the contrary, acquiring respect to  
such abilities. There small capitals laid out in lands, which  
daily become more valuable by the increase of people, afford  
a solid prospect of ample fortunes thereafter for those chil-  
dren, The writer of this has knewn several instances of  
large tracts of land bought on what was then the frontiers of  
Pennsylvania, for ten pounds per hundred acres, which, after  
twenty years, when the settlements had been extended far  
beyond them, sold readuy, without any improvement made  
upon them, for three pounds per acre. The acre in Ameri-  
ca is the same with the English acre, or the acre of Nor-  
mandy,  
  
Those who desire to understand the state of government  
in America, would do well to read the constitutions of the  
several States, and the articles of confederation which bind  
the whole together for general purposes, under the direction  
of one Assembly, called the Congress. Those constitutions  
have been printed, by order of Congress, in America; two  
editions of them have been printed in London; and a good  
translation of them in French, has lately been published at  
Paris,  
  
Several of the princes of Europe having of late, from an  
opinion of advantage to arise by producing all commodities  
and manufactures within their own dominions, so as to di-  
minish or render useless their importations, have endeavored  
to entice workmen from other countries, by high salaries,  
privileges, &amp;c. Many persons pretending to be skilled in  
various great manufactures, imagining that America must  
be in want of them, and that the Congress would probably  
be disposed to imitate the princes above-mentioned, have  
proposed to go over on condition of having their passages  
paid, lands given, salaries appointed, exclusive privileges for  
terms of years, &amp;c. Such persons, on reading the articles  
of confederation, will find that the Congress have no power  
committed to them, or money put into their hands, for such  
  
purposes ; and that, if any mc encouragement is given, it  
must be by the government of some separate State. This,  
however, has rarely been done in America; and when it  
has been done, it has rarely ded, so as to establish a  
manufacture, which the country was not yet so ripe for as  
to encourage private persons to set it up; labor being gene-  
rally too dear, and hands difficult to be kept together, every  
one desiring to be a master, and the cheapness of land in-  
clining many to leave trades for agriculture. Some indeed  
have met with success, and are carried on to advantage ;  
but they are generally such as require only a few hands, or  
  
  
  
  
  
wherein great part of the work 1s performed by machines.  
  
: Goods that are bulky, and of so small a value as not well to  
  
bear the expense of freight, may often be made cheaper m  
the country than they can be imported ; and the manufac-  
ture of such goods will be profitable wherever there is a sut-  
ficient demand. The farmers in America produce indeed a  
good deal of wool and flax, and none is exported—it is all  
worked up; but it is in the way of domestic manufacture, for  
the use of the family. The buying up quantities of wool and  
flax, with the design to employ spinners, weavers, &amp;c. and  
form great establishments, producing quantities of lmen and  
woollen goods for sale, has been several times attempted in  
different provinces ; but those projects have generally tailed,  
‘oods of equal value being imported cheaper. And when  
e governments have been solicited to support such schemes  
by encouragements, in money, or by imposing duties on im-  
portation of such goods, it has been generally refused, on  
this principle, that if the country is ripe for the manufacture,  
it may be carried on by private persons to advantage ; and,  
if not, it is folly to think of foreing nature. Great establish-  
ments of manufacture, require great numbers of poor to do  
the work for small wages; those poor are to be found in  
Europe, but will not be found in America, till the lands are  
all taken up and cultivated, and the excess of people who  
cannot get land want employment. The manufacture of  
silk, they say, is natural in France, as that of cloth in Eng-  
land, because each country produces in plenty the first ma-  
terial; but if England will have a manufacture of silk as well  
as that of cloth, and France of cloth as well as that of silk,  
these unnatural operations must be supported by mutual  
prohibitions, or high duties on the importation of each other’s  
joods ; by which means the workmen are enabled to tax the  
| on consumer by greater prices, while the higher wages  
they receive makes them neither ~— nor richer, since  
they only drink more and work less. Therefore the govern-  
ments in America do nothing to encourage such projects.  
The people by this means are not imposed on either by the  
merchant or mechanic: if the merchant demands too much  
rofit on imported shoes, they buy of the shoemaker; and if  
Re asks too high a price, they take them of the merchant ;  
thus the two professions are checks on each other, The  
shoemaker, however, has, on the whole, a considerable 4  
fit upon his labor in America, beyond what he had in Ev  
rope, as he can add to his price a sum nearly equal to all the  
expenses of freight and commission, risk or assurance, &amp;c  
necessarily charged by the merchant. And the case is the  
same with the workman in every other mechanic art.  
Hence it is, that the artisans generally live better and more  
easily in America than im Europe; and such as are good  
economists make a comfortable provision for age, and for  
their children. Such may, therefore, remove with advan-  
tage to America.  
In the old long-settled countries of Europe, all arts, trades,  
professions, farms, &amp;c. are so full, that it is difficult for a  
poor man who has children to place them where they may  
gain, or learn to gain, a decent livelihood. The artisans,  
who fear creating future rivals in business, refuse to take ap-  
prentices, but upon conditions of money, maintenance, or the  
like, which the parents are unable to comply with. Hence  
the youth are dragged up in ignorance of every gainful art,  
and obliged to become soldiers, or servants, or thieves, for a  
subsistence. In America, the rapid increase of inhabitants  
takes away that fear of rivalship, and artisans willingly re-  
ceive apprentices from the hope of profit by their labor, du-  
ring the remainder of the time stipulated, after they shall be  
instructed. Hence it is easy for poor families to get their  
children instructed ; for the artisans are so desirous of ap-  
prentices, that many of them will even give money to the pa-  
rents, to have boys from ten to fifteen years of be bound ap-  
prentices to them, till the age of twenty-one; and many poor  
parents have, by that means, on their arrival in the country,  
raised money enough to buy land sufficient-to establish them-  
selves, and to subsist the rest of the family by agriculture.  
These contracts for apprentices are made before a magistrate,  
who regulates the agreement according to reason and justice ;  
and, having in view the formation of a future useful citizen,  
obliges the master to engage by a written indenture, not only  
that, during the time of service stipulated, the apprentice  
shall be duly provided with meat, drink, apparel, washing,  
and lodging, and at its expiration with a complete new suit of  
clothes, but also, that he shall be taught to read, write, and  
cast accounts; and that he shall be well instructed in the art  
or profession of his master, or some other, by which he may  
afterward gain a livelihood, and be able in his turn to raise a  
family. A copy of this indenture is given to the apprentice  
or his friends, and the magistrate keeps a record of it, to  
which recourse may be had, in case of failure by the master  
in any point of performance. This desire among the masters  
to have more hands employed in working for them, induces  
them to pay the passage of young persons of both sexes, who,  
on their arrival, agree to serve them one, two, three, or four  
years; those who have already learned a trade, agreeing for  
a shorter term, in proportion to their skill, and the consequent  
immediate value of their service: and those who have none,  
agreeing for a longer term, in consideration of being taught  
an art their poverty would not permit them to acquire in their  
own country. ORS f  
The almost general mediocrity of fortune that prevails in  
America, obliging its people to follow some business for sub-  
sistence, those vices that arise usually from idleness, are in a  
great measure prevented. Industry and constant employ-  
ment are great preservatives of the morals and virtue of a  
nation. Hence bad examples to youth are more rare in Ame-  
rica, which must be a comfortable consideration to parents.  
To this may be truly added, that serious religion, under its  
various denominations, is- not only-tolerated, but respected  
and practised. Atheism is unknown there ; and infidelity rare  
and secret; so that persons may live to a great age in that  
  
  
  
country without having their piety shocked by meeting with

&quot;Several of the princes of Europe, hare of late,  
from an opinion of advantage to arise, by producing all  
commodities and manufactures within tlieir own do­  
minion&quot;, S3 as to diminish or render useless their im­  
portations, endeavored to entice work mi n Irom other  
countries, by high salaries, privileges, ?Vc. Miny  
persons, pretending to be skilled in various great ma­  
nufactures, imagining that America must be in want of  
them, and that the Congress would probably be dis­  
posed to imiiate the princes above mentioned, have  
proposed to go over, on condition of having their pas­  
sage paid, lands given, salaries appointed, exclusive  
privileges for terms of years, &amp;.C. Such persons, on  
reiding the articles of Confederation, will find that  
the Congress havs no power committed to them, nor  
money put into their hands for such purposes, and th. t  
if any Mich encouragement is given, it mast be by the  
Government of some separate State. This, however,  
lias rarrly been dune in America, and when it has been  
dune, it has rarely succeeded, so as to establish a ma­  
nufacture, which the country was not so ripe lor, as to  
encoumge private persons to set il up?labor being  
generally t o dear ihere, and hands diflicultto he kept  
tigt-tlier, every one desiring to be a master, anil t&#x27;ie  
cheapness of land inclining many to leave trades for  
agriculture. Some, indeed, have met with succebs,  
and are carried on to advantage, but tliey are generally  
such as require only a few hands, or wherein great  
part of the work is performed by machines Goods  
that are bulky, and r.f so small value, as not well to  
bear the expense of freight, may often be made cheaper  
in the country than they can be imported, and the ma­  
nufacture of such goods will be profitable wherever  
there is sufficient demund. The farmers in America  
produce, indeed, a good deal of wool and flax ? and  
none is exported, it is all worked up?but :t is in the  
way of domestic manufacture. The buying up quan­  
tities of wool and flax, with the design t &gt; employ spin­  
ners, weavers, Ac., and form great establishments,  
producing quantities of linen and wn&lt; lien goods for  
sale, has been several tunes nttempt* d in different pro­  
v nees, but those projec&#x27;s have generally filled, goods  
of equal value being imported cheaper. And when tfie  
Governments have been solicited to support such  
s hemes by encouragements in money, or by imposing  
duties on importation of such goods, it has been gene­  
rally refused on this principle, that if the country is  
ripe for the manufacture, it may be carried on by pri­  
vate persons to advantige, and if not, it is u fully to  
think of forcing nature.  
&quot;Great establishments of manufaclure require great  
numbers of poor to do tfie work for small wages; thote  
poor are to be found m Europe, but will n&lt; t be found  
in America till tlie lands are all taken up and culti­

““And when the governments have been solici­  
ted to support such schemes by encouragements  
in money, or by imposing duties on importation  
of such goods, it has been generally refused, on  
this principle, that if the country is ripe for the  
manufacture, it may be carried on by private  
persons to advantage ; and if not, itis a folly to  
think of forcing nature. Great establishments  
of mannufactures require great numbers of poor  
to do the work for small wages ; those poor are  
to be found in Europe, but will not be found in  
America, till the lands are all taken up and cul­  
tivated, and the excess of the people, who  
cannot get land, want employment. ‘The  
manufacture of silk, they say, is natura! in  
France, as that of cloth is in England, because  
each country produces in plenty the first materi­  
al ; but if England will have a manufacture of  
silk as well as that of cloth, and France of cloth  
as well as thatof silk, these unnatural operations  
must be supported by mutual prohibitions, or  
high duties on the importations of each other’s  
goods : by which means the workmen are ena­  
bled to tax the home consumer by greater pri­  
ces, while the higher wages they receive makes  
them neither happier nor richer, since they on­  
ly drink more and work less. &#x27;Therefore the  
governments in America do nothing to encour­  
age such projects, The people, by this means,  
are not imposed on either by the merchant or  
or mechanic: if the merchant demands to much  
profit on imported shoes, they buy of the shoe­  
maker; and if he ask too high a price, they  
take them of the merchant: thusthalwo profes­  
sions are checks on each other. T&#x27;he shoema­  
ker, however, has, on the whole, a coasidera­  
ble profit upon his labor in America, beyond  
what he had iu Europe, as he can add to his  
price a sum nearly equal to all the expences of  
freight and commission, risk or insurance, &amp;ec.,  
necessarily charged by the merchaat. And the

‘ «And when the governments have been solie­

&#x27;ripe for the manufacture, it may be c:n_&#x27;r_xed on  
| by private persous to advantage; and if not, it  
|is a folly to think of forcing nature. Great es­

but will not be tound in America, till the lands

‘The people, hy;tgis means, are not imposed on  
by either the merchant or mechanic: ifthe mer­  
chant demands too much profit on imported  
shoes, they buy of the shoemaker; and if he  
ask too high a price, they take them of the mer­  
chant: thus the two professions are checks on  
each other. &#x27;The shoemaker; however, has,on  
  
-the whole, a considerable profit upon his labor  
| in America, beyond what he had in Furope, as  
he can add to his price a sum nearly equal to  
&#x27; all his expenses of freight and commission, risk  
| of insurance, &amp;e., necessarily charged by the  
merchaut, And the case is the same with the  
} workmen in every other mechanic art.

lON OFUEMtFF IDEA.  
Several of the Princes of .&#x27;Europe,  
having of. late&#x27; from an opinion, of  
advantage to arise from producing  
all v commodities 1 and &#x27; manufactures­  
within their own dominions so as to  
diminish or render; useless their im­  
portationsi have endeavored to entice  
workmen from other countries by  
High salaries privileges, etc. Many  
persons pretending to be skilled in  
various great manufactures, imagin­  
ing that America must be in want of  
them, and that Congress would prob­  
ably, be disposed to imitate , the  
Princes above mentioned, have pro­  
mised to go over on condition of  
having their passages paid, lands  
given, salaries appointed, exclusive  
privileges for -terms of years, etc.  
Such persons on reading the Articles  
of Confederation will find that the  
Congress have no power submitted to  
them or money &quot;put into their hands  
for such purposes, and that if such  
encouragement is given it must be  
by the Government ofeome particu­  
lar State. The buying up of  
quantities of wool and flax with the  
design to employ spinners, weavers,  
eta, and form great establishments  
producing quantities of linen and  
woollen goods : for sale .has been  
several times attempted is; different  
provinces, but -those; projeots have  
generally &quot;failed, goods of equal  
value being imported cheaper. And  
when the Governments have &#x27;..been  
solicited to support such schemes by  
encouragements in money, or by im  
posing duties on importations of  
such goods, it has generally been re­  
fused on the principle that if the  
country is ripe for the manufacture  
it may be carried on by private per­  
sons to advantage, and if not it is a  
folly to think of forcing nature.  
Great establishments of manufacture  
require great numbers of poor to do  
the work for small wages those poor  
are to be found in Europe, but will  
not be found in America till the  
lands are all taken up and cultivated,  
and the excess of people who cannot  
get land want employment. The  
manufactnre of silk, they say, is  
natural in .France, as that of cloth in  
England, because each country pro­  
duces in plenty the first material;  
but if England will have a  
manufacture of silk as well  
as that of cloth, these un  
natural operations must be sup  
ported by mutual prohibitions, or  
hi;?h duties on the importations of  
each other&#x27;s goods; by which means  
the workmen are enabled to tax the  
home consumers by greater prices.  
while the higher wages they receive  
make them neither happier nor  
richer, since they only drink more  
and work less. Therefore the Gov­  
ernments of America do nothing to  
encourage such projects. The peo  
ple by this, means are not imposed  
on either by the merchant or me  
chanic; if the merchant demands too  
much profit on imported shoes they  
buy of the shoemaker; and if he asks  
too high a price they take them of  
the merchant; thus the two profes  
sions are checks on each other. The  
shoemaker, however, has, on the  
whole, a considerable profit upon his  
labor in America beyond what he  
bad in Europe, as he can add to his  
price a sum nearly equal to all the  
expenses of freight and commission,  
risk or insurance, etc., necessarily  
charged bv the merchant. And it  
is the same with every mechanic art.

Benj. Franklin&#x27;s Opinion of the Tariff Idea.  
Several of the Princes of Europe,  
having of late from an opinion of  
advantage to arise from producing  
all commodities and manufactures  
within their own dominion so as to  
diminish or render useless their im  
portations, have endeavored to en  
tice workmen from other - counrties  
by high salaries, privileges, etc.  
Many, persons pretendinff to be  
skilled in various great manufac­  
tures, imagining that America must  
be in want of them, and that Con­  
gress would probably be disposed  
to imitate the Princes above men­  
tioned, have promised to go over on  
condition of having their passages  
paid, lands given, salaries .. appoint­  
ed, exclusive privileges for terms of  
years, etc. Such persons on reading  
the Articles of Confederation wifi  
find that the Congress have no pow­  
er submitted to them or money put  
into their hands for such purposes,  
and that if such&#x27; encouragement is  
given it mustjbe by the Government  
of some particular State.  
The buying up of quantities of wool  
and flax with the design to employ  
spinners, weavers, etc., and form  
great , establishments producing  
quantities of linen and woolen goods  
for sale has been several times at­  
tempted in different pro vi nces, bu t  
those projects have generally failed,  
goods of equal value being imported  
cheaper. And when Governments  
have been solicited to support &#x27; such  
schemes by encouragements &#x27; in  
money, or ly imposing duties on im  
  
portation of&#x27; such goods , it has gen­  
erally been refused on the principle  
tJiat if the country is ripe for the  
manufacture it mad be carried on by  
  
private persons to advantage, and if  
noi ii is a jouy to inmc oj jorcing  
nature. Great establishments of  
&quot;manufacture require great numbers  
of poor to do the work for small  
wages, those poor are to be found in  
Europe, but will not be . found in  
America till the lands are all taen  
up and cultivated, and the excess of  
people who cannot get land want  
employment. &#x27;  
The manufacture of silk, they say  
is natural to France, as that of cloth  
in England, because each country  
prodI ucesjin plenty the finest material  
but if England will have a manufac­  
ture of silk as well as that of cloth,  
these unnatural operations must be
