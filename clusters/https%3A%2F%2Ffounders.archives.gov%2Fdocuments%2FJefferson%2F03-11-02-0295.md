ssion of party. the federalists who were truly American, and their great mass was so, have separated from their brethren who were mere Anglomen, and are recieved with cordiality into the republican ranks. even Connecticut, as a state, and the last one expected to yield it’s steady habits (which were essentially bigotted in politics as well as religion) has chosen a republican governor, and republican legislature. Massachusets indeed still lags; because most deeply involved in the parricide crimes and treasons of the war. but her gangrene is contracting, the sound flesh advancing on it, and all there will be well. I mentioned Connecticut as the most hopeless of our states. little Delaware had escaped my attention. that is essentially a quaker state, the fragment of a sect religious sect which, there, in the other states, in England, are a homogeneous mass, acting with one mind, and that directed by the mother-society in England. dispersed, as the Jews, they still form, as those do, one nation, foreign to the land they live in. they are protestant Jesuits, implicitly devoted to the will of their Superior, and forgetting all duties to their country in the execution of the policy of their order. when war is proposed with England, they have religious scruples, but when with France, these are laid by, and they become clamorous for it. they are however silent, passive, and give no other trouble than of whipping them along. nor is the election of Monroe an inefficient circumstance in our felicities. four and twenty years, which he will accomplish, of administration in republican forms and principles, will so consecrate them in the eyes of the people as to secure them against the danger of change. the evanition of party dissensions has harmonised intercourse, &amp; sweetened society beyond imagination. the war then has done us all this good, and the further one of assuring the world that, altho’ attached to peace from a sense of it’s blessings, we will meet war when it is made necessary.  
I wish I could give better hopes of our Southern brethren. the atchievement of their independance of Spain is no longer a question. but it is a very serious one what will then become of them? ignorance &amp; bigotry, like other insanities, are incapable of self-government. they will fall under military despotisms, and become the murderous tools of the ambition of their respective Bonapartes, and whether this will be for their greater happiness the rule of one only has taught you to judge. no one, I hope, can doubt my wish to see them and all mankind exercising self-government, &amp; capable of exercising it. but the question is not what we wish, but what is practicable? as their sincere friend and brother then, I do believe the best thing for them would be for themselves to come to an accord with Spain under the guarantee of France, Russia, Holland &amp; the US. allowing to Spain a nominal supremacy with authority only to keep the peace among them, leaving them otherwise all the powers of self-government, until their experience in them, their emancipation from their priests, and advancement in information shall prepare them for compleat independance. I exclude England from this confederacy because her selfish principles render her incapable of honorable patronage or disinterested co-operation: unless indeed, what seems now probable, a revolution should restore to her an honest government, one which will permit the world to live in peace

a, justice of the  
peace of Porto Rico, and guardian  
adlitem of the Phillipine Islande. He  
is brave as Censer and as meek as  
Moses. He is as flerce as a tiger and  
cool as cucumber. He wears the  
tail feathers of the eagle of France in  
his hat and the scalp of Mexico  
dangling at his belt. He laugha at  
the growl of the Russian bear; and is  
always ready for a schooner of Ger.­  
  
  
man beer. All that is left of Spain  
since her combat with &quot;Uncle Sam?  
is her honah.&quot; No longer the lion of  
England roars at our door, but the  
twain now stand together for human  
ity and liberty.  
Jefferson on Spanish Colonies  
I wish I could give better hopes of  
our Southern brethern. The achieve-­  
ment of their independence of Spain  
is a very serious question. What will  
then become of them? Ignorance and  
bigotry, like other insanities, are ine­  
copable of self-government. They  
will fall under military despotism,  
and become the murderous tools of  
the ambition of their respective  
Bonapartes; and whether this will be  
for their greater happiness, the rule of  
one only has taught you to judge. No  
one, I hope, can doubt my wish to see  
them and all mankind exercising self.­  
Governmeut, and capable of exercising  
it. But the question is not what we  
wish but what is practicable. As  
their sincere friend and brother then,  
do believe the best thing for them  
would be for themselves to come to  
an accord with Spain under the guar.­  
antee of France, Russia, Holland and  
United States, allowing to Spain a  
nominal supremacy, with authority  
only to keep the peace amoung them  
leaving them otherwise all the powers  
or self-Government, unol their ex­  
perience in them, their emanciption  
from their priests and advancement in  
in information shall prepare them for  
complete indepenednce.-Jefferso
