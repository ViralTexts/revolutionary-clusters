Monticello Oct. 6. 99.  
  
On recieving your favor of Sep. 29. I did believe it would be in my power to answer you satisfactorily on both the points on which you asked information. I knew indeed that I had not made any particular memorandum of the sum which the Ct. de Vergennes supposed a treaty with the Porte would cost; but I expected that I had mentioned it either in my letter on the subject to mr Jay, or in that to mr Adams my collegue in the Barbary negociations. after a very long search yesterday I found both letters, but in neither have I stated any particular sum. they are of May 1786. and only say generally that in a conversation with the Ct. de Vergennes on the subject he said that a treaty  with the Porte would cost us a great deal of money, as great presents are expected at that court &amp; a great many claim them; and that we should not buy a peace one penny the cheaper at Algiers: that the Algerines did indeed acknolege a certain dependance on the Porte, &amp; availed themselves of it whenever any thing was to be gained by it, but disregarded it when it subjected them to any demand: &amp; that at Algiers there were but two agents, money &amp; fear. this is the statement in those letters, and my memory does not enable me to fix any particular sum as having been named by him; but only generally that it was very far beyond any thing then at our command. all who were members of Congress in 1786. may be supposed to remember this information, and if it could be understood to come to you through some such channel, it would save the public from reading all the blackguardisms which would be vented on me were I quoted. not that this would weigh an atom with me, on any occasion where my avowal of either facts or opinions would be of public use; but whenever it will not, I then think it useful to keep myself out of the way of calumny.  
On the other point I can be more certain. Georgia, N. Carola. Tenissee Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland &amp; Pennsylvania chose their electors by the people directly. in Massachusets the choice is first by the people in districts. but if a candidate has not a majority of all the qualified voters of the district. it devolves on the legislature to appoint the elector for that district, besides, as they have but 14. districts (laid off for some state purpose) and are entitled to 16. electors, the legislature name the two extra ones in the first instance. again if any of those elected either by the people or legislature die, or decline to act, the residue of the electors fill up the vacancies themselves. in this way the people of Massachus. chose 7. electors on the last occasion &amp; the legislature 9. In New Hamp. Rho. Isld. Connect. Vermont, New York, Jersey Delaware &amp; South Carolina the legislature name electors. my information is good as to all these particulars except N. Hampshire &amp; Connecticut: and as to them I think I am right; but speaking only from memory it should be further ascertained before asserted. I thank you for the proof sheets you inclosed me. such papers cannot fail to produce the best effect. they inform the thinking part of the nation; and these again, supported by the taxgatherers as their vouchers, set the people to rights. you will know from whom this comes without a signature: the omission of which has been rendered almost habitual with me by the curiosity of the post offices. indeed a period is now approaching during which I shall discontinue writing letters as much as possible, knowing that every snare will be used to get hold of what may be perverted in the eyes of the publick.

Monticello Od. 6, 99-  
SIR,  
  
ON receiving your favour of Sept. 29, I  
did believe it would be in my power to an-  
{wer you fatisfa€torily on both the points on  
which you afked intormation. I knew in-  
deed that I had not made any particular mem-  
orandum of the fum which the C’de Vergen-  
nes fuppo‘ed a treaty with the Porte would  
coft; but I expeéed that I had mentioned it  
either in my [etter to Mr. Jay, on the fubjeé,  
or in that of Mr. Adams my colleague in the  
Barbary negociations. After a very long  
fearch yefterday | found both letters, but im  
  
  
  
neither have 1 fiated any particular fum. |  
  
They are of May 1786, and only fay gener-  
ally that in a converfation with the Ct. de  
Vergennes on the fubjett, he faid that « trea-  
  
ty with the porte would colt us @ great deal  
  
of money, as great prelents are expected at  
that court, and a great many claim them ;  
and that we fhould not buy a peace one pen-  
ny the cheaper at Algiers: that the Algerines  
did indeed acknowledge a certain dependence  
on the Porte, and availed themfelves of it  
whenever any thing was to be gained by it,  
‘but difregarded it when it fubjected them to  
any demand: and at Algiers there were but  
two agents, money and tear. ‘This is the  
flatement in thofe letters, and my memory  
«does not en:tble me to fix any particular fum  
as having been named by him; but only  
generally that it was very far beyond any  
thing then at our command. All who were  
members.of Congrefs in 1786. may be fup-  
poted to remember this information, and if  
it could be underftood to come to you  
through fome fuch channel, it would fave the  
‘public trom reading all the blackguardifm  
which would be vented on me were. I quoted  
not that this would weigh an atom with me,  
on any occafion where my avowal of cither  
fats or opinions would be of public ufe ; but  
whenever it will not, 1 then think it ufetulto  
keep myfelf out of the way of calumny.  
  
On the other point 1 can be more certain,  
Georgia, N. Carolina, Tenneflee, Kentucky,  
Virginia, Maryland and Pennfylvania, chofe  
their ele€tors by the people direétly. dn  
Malfachuletts the choice is firit by the people  
in diftrits. But if a candidate has not a  
majority of all the qualified voters of the  
diftriét, it devolves on the legithature to ap-  
point the ele&amp;tor for that diftriét, befides, as  
they have but «4 diftri€ts (laid off for fome  
ftate purpofe ind are entitled to 16 cleftors,  
the legillature name the two extra ones in  
the firft inflance. Again if any of thole  
eleéted either by the people or legiflature  
die, or decline to aét, the refidue of the elec-  
  
tors fill up the vacancy themfelves. In this  
way the people in Maflachufetts chose 7 e-  
*le€tors on the lait occafion, and the legifla-  
tureg. In New:Hamp. Rhode-liland, Con-  
neéticut, Vermont, New-York, Jerfey, Del-  
aware and Sonth Carolina, the legiflature  
‘name eleftors. My intormation is good as  
‘to all thefe particulars except N. Hampfhire

favor of September  
  
,On receiving yo  
29, I did believe it would be in my power to  
M you fatisfaetorily on both the points  
bich you afk information 1 know indeed  
Thud not made any particular memoran-

that to Mr. Adams my colleague in the Bar-  
bary negotiations. After a very long fearch  
yefterday I found both letters, but in neither  
ha\e I dated any particular fum. They are  
of May 1786, and only lay generally that in  
a converfation with the C&#x27;de Vergennes on  
the fubject he f aid that a treaty with the  
Porte would cad us a great deal of meney,  
is great prefei .s are expected at that coun  
uid a great many claim them ; and th it wt  
ihould net buy a peace one penny the cheap-  
-r at Algiers ; that the Algerines did in-  
deed ackno-.vh dge a certain dependance on  
he forte, and availed themfeiVes of it when-  
ever any thing was to be gained by it, but  
lifregarded it when it fubjectcd, them to any  
Jemand : and that at Algiers there were but  
two agents, money and fear. This is the  
llatement in thofe letters, and my memory  
Joes not enable me to fix any particular fum  
as having been named by him j but only ge-  
lcrally that it was very far beyond any thing  
then at our command. All who were mem-  
bers of congrefs in 1786, may be fuppofed  
to remember this information, and if it could  
be underdood to come to you through fome  
.&#x27;uch channel, it would lave the public from  
eading all the blackguardifm which would  
be vented on me were. I quoted not that  
this would weigh an atom with me, on any  
occafion where may avowal of either tV.cts or  
minion would be of public ufe ; but whene-  
ver it will not, I then think it ufeful to keep  
myl&#x27;clf out of the way of calumny.  
  
On the othet point I can be more cer-  
tain. Georgia, N. Carolina, TennefJee,  
Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland and Penn-  
fylvania cliofe their electors by the peo-  
pie directly. In MafTuchufetts the choice  
is, firft by the people in di(tri&lt;5l&lt;.. But if  
a candidate has not a majority of all the  
qualified voters of the diitrict, it devolves  
on the legillature to appoint the elector  
for that diftrict, befides, as they have but  
14. diOricts (laid off for fome ftate pur-  
pofe) and are entitled to 16 electors, the  
legiflature name the two extra ones in the  
firft mftance. Again if any of thofe e-  
lected either by the people or legifhtUre  
die, or decline to ait, the refidue of thi;  
electors fill up the vacancies therafelves.

Monticello, Oct. 6, ’99.  
  
Sir,—On receiving your favor of Sept. 29, I did believe it would be in  
my power to answer you satisfactorily on both the points on which you asked  
information: I knew indeed that I had not made any particular memo-  
randum of the sum which the Ct. de Vergennes supposed a treaty with the  
porte would cost; but I expect that I had mentioned it either in my letter  
on the subject to Mr. Jay, or in that to Mr. Adams my colleague in the Bar-  
bary negociations. After a very long search yesterday I found both letters  
but in neither have I stated any particular sum. They are of May 1786,  
and only say generally that in a conversation with the Ct. de Vergennes on  
the subject, he said that a treaty with the porte would cost us a great deal  
of money, as great presents are expected at that court, and a great many  
claim them; and that we should not buy a peace one peuny the cheaper at  
Algiers; that the Algerines did indeed acknowledge a certain dependence  
on the Porte, and availed themselves of it whenever anything was to be  
gained by it, but disregarded it when it subjected them to any demand: and  
that at Algiers there were but too (sic) agents, money and fear. This is  
the statement in those letters, and my memory does not enable me to fix any  
particular sum having been named by him; but only generally that it was  
very far beyond any thing then at our command.—All who were members  
of Congress in 1786, may be supposed to remember this information, and  
if it could be understood to come to you through some such channel, it  
would save the public from reading all the blackguardism which would be  
vented on me, were I quoted; not that this would weigh an atom with me  
on any occeasion where my avowal of either facts or opinions would be of  
public use; but whenever it will not, I then think it useful to keep myself  
out of the way of calumny.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
1896. ] Jefferson and Callender. 449  
On the other point I can be more certain. Georgia, N. Carolina, Ten-  
nessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania choose their elec-  
tors by the people directly. In Massachusetts the choice is, first by the  
people in districts: But if a candidate had not a pra coef of all the qual-  
ified voters of the district; it devolves on the legislature to appoint the  
elector for that district, besides as they have but 14. districts (laid off for  
some state purpose) and are entitled to 16. electors, the legislature name  
the two extra ones in the first instance. Again, if any of those elected  
either by the people or legislature die, or decline to act, the residue of the  
electors fill up the vacancies themselves. In this way the people of Massa-  
chus. chose 7. electors on the last occasion, and the legislature 9. In New  
Hamp. Rho. Isld. Connec. Vermont, New-York, Jersey, Delaware and  
South Carolina, the legislature name electors. My information is good as  
to all these particulars except N. Hampshire and Connecticut: and as to  
them I think I am right; but speaking only from memory it should be fur-  
ther ascertained before asserted. I thank you for the proof sheets you in-  
closed me. Such papers cannot fail to produce the best effect. They inform  
the thinking part of the nation; and these again supported by the tax-  
gatherers as their vouchers, set the people to rights. You will know from  
whom this comes without a signature; the omission of which has rendered  
almost habitual with me by the curiosity of the post offices. Indeed a period  
is now approaching during which I shall discontinue writing letters as much  
as possible, knowing that every snare will be used to get hold of what may  
be perverted in the eyes of the public.
