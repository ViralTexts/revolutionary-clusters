 your personal knowledge, you may probably recollect some explanation that may have been given of it, at the time it occurred. At least, your acquaintance with the members of the Convention that framed the constitution will enable you to decide whether a just inference has been drawn from their conduct.In the London Quarterly Review, published in October 1820. (No 46. page 551.) in the article entitled “New Churches,” the following occurs in a note, and is designed to support the insinuation, that the government of these states “profess a liberal indifference whether there be any religion in the country, or none.“When the American Convention were framing their constitution, Dr. Franklin asked them how it happened that while groping, as it were, in the dark to find political truth, they had not once thought of applying to the Father of lights to illuminate their understandings?—I have lived, Sir, (said he) a long time; and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings, that “except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.” I firmly believe this; and I also believe, that without his concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building, no better than the builders of Babel. We shall be divided by our little, partial, local interests; our projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a reproach and a bye-word to future ages”—He then moved, that prayers should be performed in that assembly every morning before they proceeded to business. “The Convention, except three or four persons, thought prayers unnecessary!!” These words, and these notes of admiration were written by Franklin himself.” Thus far the note in the Quarterly Review.Upon turning to Franklin’s works (Duane’s edition) Vol. 1. page 474. I find the same story related in nearly the same words; and the remark that the conv

ANECDOTES OF DR. FRANKLIN.  
  
WHEN the American Convention were  
  
framing their Constitution, Dr. Frank- —  
  
lin asked them how it happened, that  
while ‘ groping as it were in the dark,  
to find political truth,’ they had not  
once thought of humbly applying to  
the Father of lights to illuminate their  
understandings? “ I have lived, Sir,  
(said he) along time; and the longer  
I live, the more convincing proofs I  
see of this truth, that God governs in  
the affairs of men. And if a sparrow  
cannot fall to the ground without his  
notice, is it probable that an Empire  
can rise without his aid? We have  
been assured, Sir, in the sacred writ-  
ings, that, “‘ except the Lord build the  
house, they labour in-vain that build  
it.” I firmly believe this; and I also  
believe, that without his concurring  
aid, we shall succeed in this political  
building no better than the builders of  
Babel. We shall be divided by our  
little, partial, local interests, our pro-  
jects will be confounded, and we our-  
selves shall become a reproach and a  
by-word down to future ages.” He  
then moved, that prayers should be  
performed in that assembly every  
morning before they proceeded to bu-  
siness. ‘* The Convention, except three  
or four persons, thought prayers unne-  
cessary!!” These words, and these  
notes of admiration, were written by
