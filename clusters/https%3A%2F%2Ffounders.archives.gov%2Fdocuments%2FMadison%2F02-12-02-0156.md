Ogden, severally, in certain issues of traverse between the U. S. and the said William S. Smith, and Samuel G Ogden.

the President a particeps criminis. An  
amusing letter was read from Madison,  
Dearborn, and Smith, which stated, “ that  
the President, taking into view the state  
  
of our public affairs, has specially signi-

have to state to the court that the President of the  
United States, taking into view the state of our pub
