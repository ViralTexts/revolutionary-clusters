of State July 12. 18[1]3  
The Secretary of State, to whom was referred several resolutions of the House of Representatives of the 21st ult, requesting information on certain points relating to the French decree of the 28th April 1811, has the honor to make to the President the following report:  
In furnishing the information required by the House of Representatives the Secretary of State presumes that it might be deemed sufficient for him to state what is now demanded, what part thereof has been heretofore communicated, and to supply the deficiency. He considers it however more conformable to the views of the House, to meet, at this time, without regarding what has been already communicated, every enquiry, and to give a distinct answer to each, with the proper explanation relating to it.  
The House of Representatives has requested information, when, by whom, and in what manner, the first intelligence was given to this Govt. of the Decree of the Government of France, bearing date on the 28th April 1811, and purporting to be a definitive repeal of the decrees of Berlin and Milan; whether Mr. Russell late Charge d’Affaires of the United States to the Government of France ever admitted or denied to his Govt. the correctness of the declaration of the Duke of Bassano to Mr. Barlow, as stated in Mr. Barlows letter of the 12th May 1812 to the Secretary of State, that the said decree had been communicated to his, Mr. Barlows’ predecessor there, and to lay before the House any correspondence with Mr. Russell on that subject which it may not be improper to communicate, and also any correspondence between Mr. Barlow and Mr. Russell in possession of the Department of State; whether the Minister of France to the United States ever informed this Govt. of the existence of the said decree, and to lay before the House any correspondence with the said Minister relative thereto, not improper to be communicated; with any other information in possession of the Govt. which he may not deem it injurious to the public interest to disclose, relative to the said decree, tending to shew at what time, by whom, and in what manner, it was first made known to this Govt., or to any of its representatives or Agents; and lastly to inform the House whether the Govt. of the United States, hath ever received from that of France, any explanation of the reasons of that decree being concealed from this Govt., and its Minister for so long a time after its date, and if such explanation has been asked by this Govt., and has been omitted to be given by that of France, whether this Govt. has made any remonstrance or expressed any dissatisfaction to the Govt. of France at such concealment.  
These enquiries embrace two distinct objects. The first relates to the conduct of the Govt. of France in regard to this Decree. The second, to that, of the Government of the United States. In satisfying the call of the House on this latter point, it seems to be proper to meet it in a two fold view; first as it relates to the conduct of this Govt. in this transaction; secondly, as it relates to its conduct toward both belligerents, in some important circumstances connected with it. The resolutions do not call specially for a report of such extent, but as the measures of the Executive, and the acts of Congress, founded on communications from the Executive which relate to one of the belligerents, have by necessary consequence an immediate relation to the other, such a report seems to be obviously comprized within their scope. On this principle the report is prepared, in the expectation that the more full the information given, on every branch of the subject, the more satisfactory will it be to the House.  
The Secretary of State has the honor to report in reply to these enquiries, that the first intelligence which this Govt. received of the French decree of the 28th April 1811, was communicated by Mr. Barlow, in a letter bearing date on the 12th of May 1812, which was received by this Department on the 13th of July following: that the first intimation to Mr. Barlow, of the existence of that decree, as appears by his communications, was given by the Duke of Bassano in an informal conference on some day between the 1st and 10th of May 1812, and that the official communication of it to Mr. Barlow, was made on the 10th. of that month, at his request: that Mr. Barlow transmitted a copy of that decree, and of the Duke of Bassano’s letter announcing it to Mr. Russell, in a letter of May 11, in which he also informed Mr. Russell, that the Duke of Bassano had stated that the decree had been duly communicated to him: that Mr. Russell replied in a letter to Mr. Barlow of the 29th of May, that his first knowledge of the decree was derived from his letter, and that he has repeatedly stated the same since, to this Government. The paper marked A is a copy of an extract of Mr. Barlow’s letter to the Department of State of May 12—1812—B of the Duke of Bassano’s letter to Mr. Barlow, of the 10th of the same month: C of an extract of Mr. Barlow’s letter to Mr. Russell of May 11th: D of an extract of Mr. Russell’s answer of the 29 May, and E of Mr. Russell’s letter to the Dept of State of the 30th.  
The Secretary of State reports also, that no communication of the decree of the 28th Apl 1811 was ever made to the Govt. by the Minister of France, or other person, than, as is above stated, and that no explanation of the cause of its not having been communicated to this Govt. and published, at the time of its date, was ever made to this Govt., or, so far, as it is informed, to the representatives or Agents of the United States in Europe. The Minister of France has been asked to explain the cause of a proceeding apparently so extraordinary and exceptionable, who replied that his first intelligence of that decree, was received by the Wasp, in a letter from the Duke of Bassano of May 10th. 1812, in which he expressed his surprize that a prior letter of May 1811, in which he had transmitted a copy of the decree, for the information of this Govt. had not been received. Further explanations were expected from Mr. Barlow, but none were given. The light in which this transaction was viewed by this Govt. was noticed by the President in his message to Congress, and communicated also to Mr. Barlow, in the letter of the 14 July 1812, with a view to the requisite explanation from the French Government. On the 9th——day of May 1812 the Emperor left Paris for the North, and in two days thereafter the Duke of Bassano followed him. A negotiation for the adjustment of injuries, and the arrangement of our commerce, with the Government of France, long depending, and said to have been brought nearly to a conclusion, at the time of Mr. Barlow’s death, was suspended by that event. His successor, lately appointed, is authorized to resume the negotiation and to conclude it. He is instructed to demand redress of the French Govt. for every injury, and an explanation of its motive for withholding from this Govt. a knowledge of the Decree, for so long a time after its adoption.  
It appears by the documents referred to, that Mr. Barlow lost no time, after having obtained a knowledge of the existence of the French decree of the 28 April 1811, in demanding a copy of it, and transmitting it to Mr. Russell, who immediately laid it before the British Govt., urging on the ground of this new proof of the repeal of the French decrees, that the British orders in Council should be repealed. Mr. Russell’s note to Lord Castlereagh bears date on the 20 May; Lord Castlereagh’s reply on the 23d, in which he promised to submit the decree to the consideration of the Prince Regent. It appears, however, that no encouragement was given at that time, to hope that the orders in Council would be repealed, in consequence of that decree; and that altho’ it was afterwards made the ground of their repeal, the repeal was, nevertheless, to be ascribed to other causes. Their repeal did not take effect until the 23d June, more than a month after the French decree had been laid before the British Government; a delay indicating in itself, at a period so momentous and critical, not merely neglect but disregard of the French decree. That the repeal of the British orders in Council, was not produced by the French decree, other proofs might be adduced. I will state one, which, in addition to the evidence contained in the letters from Mr. Russell herewith communicated (marked G ⟨)⟩ is deemed conclusive. In the communication of Mr. Baker to Mr. Graham, on the 9th Augt, 1812, (marked H.) which was founded on instructions from his Govt., of as late date as the 17th June, in which he stated, that an official declaration would be sent to this Country, proposing a conditional repeal of the orders in Council, so far as they affected the United States, no notice whatever was taken of the French decree. One of the conditions then contemplated was, that the orders in Council should be revived at the end of 8 months, unless the conduct of the French Govt., and the result of the Communications with the Govt. of the UStates, should be such, as, in the opinion of the British Govt., to render their revival unnecessary: a condition which proves incontestibly that the French decree was not considered by the British Govt., a sufficient ground, on which to repeal the orders in Council. It proves also that on that day the British Govt. had resolved not to repeal the orders on the basis of that decree; since the proposed repeal was to depend, not on what the French Govt. had already done, but on what it might do, and on arrangements to be entered into with the UStates, unconnected with the French repeal.  
The French decree of the 28th April, 1811, was transmitted to the United States by the Wasp, a public vessel, which had been long awaiting, at the ports of Great Britain and France, dispatches from our Ministers relating to these very important concerns with both governments. It was received at the Department of State on the 13th. July, 1812, nearly a month after the declaration of War against Great Britain. Intelligence of the repeal of the orders in Council was not received until about the middle of the following month. It was impossible therefore that either of those acts, in whatever light they might be viewed, should have been taken into consideration, or have had any influence in deciding on that important event.  
Had the British Govt. been disposed to repeal its orders in Council, in conformity with the principle on which it professed to issue them, and on the condition which it had itself prescribed, there was no reason to delay the repeal until such a decree as that of the 28 April 1811 should be produced. The declaration of the French Government of Augt. 5 1810 had fully satisfied every claim of the British Govt. according to its own principles, on that point. By it the decrees of Berlin and Milan were declared to be repealed, the repeal to take effect on the 1st Novr. following, on which day it did take effect. The only condition attached to it, was, either that Great Britain should follow the example, and repeal her orders in Council, or that the United States should carry into effect against her, their non importation act. This condition was in its nature subsequent, not precedent, reserving a right in France to revive her decrees in case neither alternative was performed. By this declaration it was put completely in the power of Great Britain to terminate this controversy in a manner the most honorable to herself. France had yielded to her the ground on a condition, with which she had declared her willingness to comply. Had she complied the non importation act would not have been carried into effect, nor could the French decrees have been revived. By refusing to comply, she has made herself responsible for all that has since followed.  
By the decree of the 28 Apl 1811 the decrees of Berlin and Milan were said to be definitively repealed, and the execution of the non-importation act against G. Britain was declared to be the ground of that repeal. The repeal announced by the declaration of the 5th Augt 1810 was absolute and final, except as to the condition subsequent attached to it. This latter decree acknowledges that that condition had been performed, and disclaims the right to revive it, in consequence of that performance; and extending back to the 1st. of November, confirms in every circumstance the preceding repeal. The latter act therefore as to the repeal, is nothing more than a confirmation of the former. It is in this sense that those two acts are to be understood in France. It is in the same sense that they are to be regarded by other powers.  
In repealing the orders in Council on the pretext of the French decree of the 28th of April 1811, the British Govt. has conceded that it ought to have repealed them on the declaration of the 5th Augt 1810. It is impossible to discriminate between the two acts, or to separate them from each other, so as to justify on sound and consistent principles, the repeal of the orders in Council, on the ground of one act, and the refusal to repeal them, on that of the other. The second act makes the repeal definitive; but for what reason? Because the non-importation act had been put in force against Great Britain, in compliance with the condition subsequent, attached to the former repeal, and her refusal to perform it. That act being still in force, and the decree of the 28th April 1811 being expressly founded on it, Great Britain repeals her orders in Council on the basis of this latter decree. The conclusion is therefore irresistable that by this repeal, under all the circumstances attending it, the British Government has acknowledged the justice of the claim of the United States to a repeal on the former occasion. By accepting the latter repeal, it has sanctioned the preceding one; it has sanctioned also the conduct of this Government in carrying into effect the non importation act against Great Britain, founded on the preceding repeal.  
Other important consequences result from this repeal of the British Govt. By fair and obvious construction the acceptance of the decree of the 28th April 1811 as the ground of the repeal of the orders in Council, ought to be construed to extend back to the 1st Nov 1810, the day on which the preceding repeal took effect. The Secretary of State has full confidence that if the question could be submitted to the judgment of an impartial judicial tribunal, that such would be its decision. He has equal confidence that such will be the judgment pronounced on it by the enlightened and impartial world. If however these two acts could be separated from each other, so as that the latter might be made the basis of the repeal of the orders in Council, distinct from the former, it follows that bearing date on the 28th April 1811, the repeal ought to have relation to that date. In legal construction, between nations as well as individuals, acts, are to be respected from the time they begin to operate, and where they impose a moral or political obligation on another party, that obligation commences with the commencement of the act. But it has been urged that the French decree was not promulgated, or made known to the British Govt. until a year after its date. This objection has no force. By accepting an act bearing date a year before it was promulgated, it is admitted that in the interval nothing was done repugnant to it. It cannot be presumed that any Govt. would accept from another, as the basis, on which it was to found an important measure, an act of anterior and remote date, pledging itself to a certain course of conduct which that Govt. had in the interval departed from and violated. If any Government had violated an act the injunctions of which it was bound to observe by an anterior one, in relation to a third party, and which it professed to have observed, before its acceptance by the other, it could not be presumed that it would cease to violate it after the acceptance. The conclusion is irresistable that if the other Govt. did accept such act with a knowledge of its antecedent violation, as the foundation of any measure on its own part, that such act must have been the ostensible only, and not the real motive to such measure.  
The declaration of the Prince Regent of the 21st April 1811 is in full confirmation of these remarks. By this act of the British Govt. it is formally announced, on the authority of a report of the Secretary of foreign affaires to the conservative senate of France that the French decrees were still in force, and that the orders in Council should not be repealed. It cannot fail to excite considerable surprize that the British Govt. should immediately afterwards, that is, on the 23d. June, repeal its orders in Council, on the ground of the French decree of the 28th April 1811. By this proceeding the British Govt. has involved itself in manifest inconsistency. It has maintained by one act, that the French decrees were in full force, and by another that they were repealed during the same space of time. It admits also, that by no act of the French Govt., or of its cruizers, had any violation of the repeal announced by the declaration of the French Govt. of the 5th Augt 1810, been committed, or at least, that such violation had not had sufficient weight to prevent the repeal of the orders in Council.  
It was objected that the declaration of the French Govt of the 5 Augt 1810 was not such an act as the British Govt. ought to have regarded. The Secretary of State is thoroughly satisfied that this objection is altogether unfounded. It was communicated by the Emperor thro’ his highest official Organ, the Secretary of Foreign Affaires, to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris. It is impossible to conceive an act more formal, authentic or obligatory on the French Government, than that alluded to. Does one Government ever ask or expect from another to secure the performance of any duty, however important, more than its official pledge, fairly, and fully expressed? Can better security be given for its performance? Had there been any doubt on this subject, the conduct of Great Britain herself, in similar cases, would have completely removed it. The whole history of her deplomatic intercourse with other Powers, on the subject of blockade, is in accord with this proceeding of the French Government. We know that when her Government institutes a blockade, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs announces it to the Minister of other Powers at London, and that the same form is observed when they are revoked. Nor was the authenticity of either act, thus announced, ever questioned.  
Had a similar declaration been made by the Minister of France in the United States to this Government, by the order of his own, would it not have been entitled to respect, and been respected? By the usage of Nations, such respect could not have been withheld. The arrangement made with Mr. Erskine, is a full proof, of the good faith of this Government, and of its impartiality, in its transactions, with both the belligerents. It was made with that Minister on the ground of his public character, and the confidence due to it: on which basis the non-intercourse was removed to England, &amp; left in full force against France. The failure of that arrangement was imputable to the British Government alone, who, in rejecting it took on itself a high reponsibility, not simply, in regard to the consequences attending it, but in disavowing and annulling the act of its minister, without shewing that he had exceeded his authority. In accepting the declaration of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, in proof of the French repeal, the United States gave no proof of improper credence to the Government of France. On a comparison of both transactions, it will appear that if a marked confidence, and respect was shewn to either Government, it was to that of Great Britain. In accepting the declaration of the Government of France in the presence of the Emperor, the United States stood on more secure ground, than, in accepting that of a British Minister in this Country.  
To the demand made by the United States of the repeal of the British Orders in Council, founded on the basis of the French repeal of August 5th. 1810, the British Government replied, by demanding a Copy of the orders issued by the French Government for carrying into effect that repeal; a demand without example in the intercourse between Nations. By this demand it ceased to be a question whether the French repeal was of sufficient extent, or was founded on justifiable conditions. The pledge of the French Government was doubted; a scrutiny was instituted as to the manner in which it was to be discharged, and its faith preserved, not by the subsequent conduct of its cruizers towards the Vessels of the United States, but by a Copy of the orders given to its cruizers. Where would this end? If the French Government intended a fraud, by its declaration of repeal, announced to the Minister of the United States, and afterwards to this Government, might it not likewise commit a fraud in any other communication which it might make? If credit was refused by the British Government to the act of the French Government, thus formally announced, is it probable that it would have been given by it, to any document of inferior character, directed to its own people. Altho’ it was the policy, and might be the interest of the British Government to engage the United States in such a controversy with the French Government, it was far from comporting with their interests to do it. They considered it their duty to accept the repeal already made by the French Government, of its decrees, and to look to its conduct, and to that of its cruizers, sanctioned by the Government, for the faithful performance, or violation, of it. The United States having been injured by both powers, were unwilling, in their exertions to obtain justice of either, to become the instrument of the other. They were the less inclined to it in the present instance, from the consideration, that the party making the pressure on them, maintained in full force its unlawful edicts against the American Commerce, while it could not deny that a considerable advance, at least, had been made by the other towards a complete accommodation, it being manifest to the world, not only that the faith of the French Government stood pledged for the repeal of the decrees, but that the repeal did take effect on the 1st. of November 1810, in regard to the United States; that several American Vessels taken under them had been delivered up; and judicial decisions suspended on all, by its order, and that it also continued to give the most positive assurances that the repeal should be faithfully observed.  
  
It has also been urged that the French repeal was conditional, and for that reason could not be accepted. This objection has already been fully answered. It merits attention however that the Acts of the British Government relating to this subject, particularly the declaration of the 21st. April 1812, and the repeal of the 23d. June of the same year are equally, and in like manner conditional. It is not a little surprizing, that the British Government should have objected to a measure in another Government, to which it has itself given a sanction by its own acts. It is proper however to remark that this objection has been completely waved and given up by the acceptance of the decree of the 28th April 1811.  
The British Government has urged also, that it could not confide in the faithful performance by the French Government of any engagement it might enter into relative to the repeal of its decrees. This objection would be equally applicable to any other compact to be entered into with France. While maintained, it would be a bar to any Treaty, even to a Treaty of Peace, between them. But it also has been admitted to be unfounded by the acceptance of the decree of the 28th April 1811.  
The Secretary of State presumes that these facts and explanations, supported as they are by authentic documents, prove, first, that the repeal of the British orders in Council was not to be ascribed to the French decree bearing date on the 28 April 1811; and secondly, that in making that decree the basis of their repeal, the British Government has conceded that it ought to have repealed them on the ground of the declaration of the French Government of 5th. August 1810, so as to take effect on the 1st. November following. To what cause the repeal of the British orders in Council was justly attributable cannot now remain a doubt, with any, who have marked with a just discernment, the course of events. It must afford great consolation to the good people of these States, to know that they have not submitted to privations in vain.  
The discussion of other wrongs, particularly, that relating to impressment, had been closed some time before the period alluded to. It was unworthy the character of the United States to pursue the discussion on that difference, when it was evident that no advantage could be derived from it. The right was reserved, to be brought forward and urged again, when it might be done with effect. In the mean time the practice of impressment was persevered in with rigor.  
At the time when war was declared against Great Britain, no satisfactory arrangement was offered, or likely to be obtained respecting impressment, and nothing was more remote from the expectation of this Government, than the repeal of the Orders in Council. Every circumstance which had occurred tending to illustrate the policy and views of the British Government, rendered such an event altogether improbable. From the commencement of that system of hostility, which Great Britain had adopted against the United States, her pretensions had gradually increased, or at least become more fully unfolded, according to circumstances, until at the moment when war was declared they had assumed a character which dispelled all prospect of accommodation. The orders in Council were said to have been adopted on a principle of retaliation on France, altho’ at the time when the order of May 1806 was issued, no measure of France had occurred on which it could be retaliatory, and at the date of the next order, January 1807, it was hardly possible that this Government should have, even heard of the decree of Berlin, to which it related. It was stated at the time of their adoption, and for some time afterwards, that they should be revoked as soon as France revoked her decrees, and that the British Government would proceed with the Government of France pari passu in the revocation. After the declaration, however, of the French Government of the 5th. August 1810, by which the Berlin and Milan decrees were declared to be repealed, the British Government changed its tone, and continued, to rise in its demands, to the moment that war was declared. It objected first, that the French repeal was conditional, and not absolute; altho’ the only condition attached to it, was, that Great Britain should follow the example, or the United States fulfil their pledge, by executing the non-importation act against her. It was then demanded that France should repeal her internal regulations, as a condition of the repeal of the British Orders in Council. Next, that the French repeal should be extended to all neutral nations, as well as to the United States, and lastly, that the Ports of her Enemies and all Ports from which the British flag was excluded, should be opened to British manufactures in American Vessels: Conditions so extravagant, as to satisfy all dispassionate minds, that they were demanded not in the expectation, that they would, or could be complied with, but to terminate the discussion.  
On full consideration of all circumstances, it appeared that the period had arrived, when it became the duty of the United States to take that attitude with Great Britain, which was due to their violated rights, to the Security of their most important interests, and to their character as an independant nation. To have shrunk from the crisis would have been to abandon every thing valuable to a free people. The Surrender of our Seamen to British impressment, with the destruction of our navigation, and commerce, would not have been its only evils. The desolation of property however great, and widely spread, affects an interest which admits of repair. The wound, is incurable, only, which fixes a stigma on the national honor. While the spirit of the people is unsubdued, there will always be found in their virtue, a resource equal to the greatest dangers, and most trying emergencies. It is in the nature of free government, to inspire in the body of the people, generous and noble sentiments, and it is the duty of the constituted authorities, to cherish, and to appeal to those sentiments, and rely on the patriotic support of their constituents. Had they proved themselves unequal to the crisis, the most fatal consequences would have resulted from it. The proof of their weakness would have been recorded; but not on them alone, would its baneful effects have been visited. It would have shaken the foundation of the Government itself, and even of the sacred principles of the revolution, on which all our political institutions depend. Yielding to the pretentions of a foreign power, without making a manly effort in defence of our rights, without appealing to the virtue of the people, or to the strength of our Union, it would have been charged and believed, that in these sources, lay, the hidden defects. Where would the good people of these States, have been able to make another stand? Where would have been their ralying point? The Government of their choice, having been dishonored, its weakness, and that of their institutions, demonstrated, the triumph of the Enemy would have been complete. It would also have been durable.  
The constituted authorities of the United States neither dreaded or anticipated these evils. They had full confidence in the strength of the Union, in the firmness and virtue of the people, and were satisfied, when the appeal should be made, that ample proof would be afforded, that their confidence had not been misplaced. Foreign presure, it was not doubted would soon dissipate foreign partialities and prejudices, if such existed, and unite us more closely together as one people.  
In declaring war against Great Britain, the United States have placed themselves in a situation to retort the hostility, which they had so long suffered from the British Government. The maintainance of their rights was the object of the war. Of the desire of this Government to terminate the war on honorable conditions, ample proof has been afforded by the proposition made to the British Government immediately after the declaration of war, thro’ the chargé des affaires of the United States at London, and by the promptitude and manner of the acceptance of the mediation of the Emperor of Russia.  
It was anticipated by some, that a declaration of war against Great Britain would force the United States into a close connection with her adversary, much to their disadvantage. The Secretary of State thinks it proper to remark, that nothing is more remote from the fact. The discrimination in favor of France, according to law, in consequence of her acceptance of the proposition made equally to both powers, produced a difference between them in that special case, but in that only. The war with England was declared, without any concert or communication with the French Government; it has produced no connection between the United States and France, or any understanding as to its prosecution, continuance, or termination. The ostensible relation between the two countries, is the true and only one. The United States have just claims on France for spoliations on their commerce on the high Seas, and in the Ports of France, and their late minister was, and their present minister is, instructed, to demand reparation for these injuries, and to press it with the energy due to the justice of their claims, and to the character of the United States. The result of the negotiation will be communicated to Congress in due time. The papers marked (I) contain copies of two letters, addressed from this Department to Mr. Barlow, one of the 16th. June 1812, just before the declaration of war, the other of the 14th. July following, which shew distinctly the relation existing between the United States and France at that interesting period. No change has since occurred in it. All which is respectfully submitted

of what he deemed a duty to his constituents and  
his country. The declaration of the French mini-  
ster had a great bearing upon the reputation of the  
country—on the reputation of those persons who in  
their official characters represented the dignity of  
the nation. To place their conduct m a proper  
light, he presented to the consideration of the house,  
the following resolutions : ;  
“‘Resolved, That the President of the U. States  
be requested to inform this house, unless the public  
interest should, in his opinion, forbid such commu.  
n:cation, “when, by whom, and in what manner the  
first intelligence was given to this government of  
the decree of the government of France, bearing  
date on the 28th of April, 1811, and purporting to  
be adefinitive repeal of the decrees of Berlin and  
Milan.”

The report embraces the following facts  
sta’ed in distinct and unequivocal terms :—  
I&#x27;ll at the first intelligence which this govt,  
received of the Fr. decree of the 28th April  
1811, was c&gt; mmunicated b\ Mr. Barlow.in  
a letter bearing date on the 12th May, 1812,  
which was r» ceived by this department ons  
the 13tb July following * tnal the first inti  
mation to Mr. Birlow of the existence of  
that decree, ?s appears by his communicati­  
on , was given b» the 1) ike of Bussuno, in  
an informai confer* ’ice on some day between  
the 1st and lgtu of May, 1812, and that the  
  
•  
official communication of ft to Mr. RaHoir  
was made oil the loth of that month at his  
request : that Mr. barlow transmitted a co-*  
py of that decree, and of the Duke of b.,s,  
sano’s letter, announcing it, to Mr. Russell,  
in a letter ot May Jlth, in whicli he also in­  
formed Mr. Russell, that the Duke of Basso,  
! *&gt;o had stated that the decree had «eeu du­  
ly communicated to him : that Mr Russell  
replied in a letter to Mr barlow of the 29ih  
May. that his first knowledge of this decree  
was derived from his letter and that he has  
repeatedly suited the same since to this go,  
verniuent.  
J he Secretary of State np&lt; r s also that no  
commui icution of the decree of the 28i!t  
April, 1811, was ever made to this govern­  
ment by the Minister of France, or other  
person, than as is above stated, and that no  
explanation of the cau.e of its not having  
been communicated to this government and  
published at the timet.f its date, was ever  
made to this government, or s&lt;&gt; far as it i&lt;  
informed to the representatives or agents of  
the U. States in Europe. The Minister of  
France lias been asked to explsin the cause  
of a proceeding apparently s.» extraordinary  
and exceptionable, who replied that his first  
intelligence ot that decree was received by  
the \\ asp, in a letter from the duke of Ras­

- it was anticipated liy some, that a de •

force the U. States into a close connection  
with her adversary, much to iheir disadvan­

These enquiries embrace two distinct  
objects- The fit st relates to the conduct  
of the government of France, in regard  
to this decree. The second, ?o that of  
the government ot the U Slates. In  
satisfying the call of the li^use, on this  
Utter point, it seems tc be proprr to  
meet it to a two-fold view: first as it  
relates to the conduct of this govern­  
ment in this transaction ; secondly, as  
it* relates fo its conduct towards both  
Belligerents in some important circum­  
stances -connected jsiih it. The resolu­  
tions do not cal! specially lor a report of  
t»»ch extent, but as the measure* of the  
Executive, and the acts ot Congress,  
founded on communications from the  
Exscotive, which relate to one of the  
belligerents, have by necessary conse­  
quence an immediate relation to the o­

ly comprised within their scope. On  
Ibis principle the report is prepared, in  
the expectation, that the morn full the  
information given, on every branch of  
the subject, the more satisfactory will it  
v be to ths House  
The Secretary of State has the honor  
to report, iu reply to these enquiries,  
  
that the first intelligence which this go­  
vernment received of the French de­  
cree of the 28th April 1811, com

bearing date on the 12th May, 181 ,

minister of France has been asked to  
explain the cause of a proceeding ap­  
parently so extraordinary and exception­  
able, who replied that his first intelli­  
gence of that decree was received br  
the Wasp, in a fetter from the Duke of  
Bussaco of May 10th, 1812, in which he  
«xpressed his surprise, excited by Mr.  
Barlow&#x27;* communication, &#x27;that a prior  
letter of May, 1811. in which he had  
transmitted a copy of the decree for the

i-tcjice of the French decree of the 28tt.  
A [1 ri!, 1811, in demat^ling a copy of it, |  
and transmitting it to Mr. Russell, who !  
immediately laid it before the B iu*»h |  
government, urging, on the ground of  
this new proof of the repeal of the  
French decrees, that the British oiders j  
in council should be repealed. Mr. j  
Rufsell’s note to Lord Castlercagh bears |  
dale on the 20th of May ; Lord Castle- i  
rcagh&#x27;s reply on the 23d, in which he  
promised to submit the decree to the |  
consideration of the Prince Regent. It  
appears, however, that no encourage­  
ment was given at that time to hope that |  
the orders in council would be repealed  
in constquence of that decree; anfittat  
although it was afterwards made the  
ground of their repeal, the repeal was ;  
nevertheless to be ascribed to other  
&lt;.# ses. Their repeal did not take effect  
un’il the 2 .VI of June, more than a month  
after the French decree had been laid  
before the British government; a delay  
indicating, in itself, at a period so mo­  
mentous anc critical, not merely neglect j  
but disregard of »he French decree — ]  
That the repeal of the British orders in I  
council wis not produced by the French 1  
d‘ C &#x27;-e, other proofs might he adduced.  
I will state one. which in addition to the  
evidence contained in the letters from  
Mr Russell, herewith communicated  
marked G, is deemed conclusive. In  
the communica’:on of Mr BokertoMr.  
Graham on the 9th August, 1812, which  
was fotmdrd on instructions fiom hit  
government, of as late date as the 17th  
June, in which ht stated, that an official  
declaration would bo sent to this coun­  
try, proposing a conditional repeal ©i  
the orders in council, so far as they af­  
fected the U S. no notice whatever was  
»aken of the French decree. One of  
•be conditions then contemplated was,  
teat the orders in council should be re­  
vived at the end ef eight months, unless  
the conduct of i£e French government  
  
and th« result of the cowTnunicitions  
with the government of the U. S. should  
be such as in the opinion ©f the British  
government to render their revival un­  
necessary ; a condition which proves w­  
contcstibly that the French decree was  
oot considered by the Biilish govern­  
ment a sufficient ground on v» hicii to rc  
peal the orders in council* It proves  
-Ho that on that day the British govern­  
ment had resolved not to repeal the or*  
decs on the basis of that decree since  
the proposed repeal was to depend not  
on &quot; Hal the French government Had a!­

The French de***rc of the 23*h April,  
1 1811. was transmitted to the U. States  
I by the Wasp, a public vessel, whirk ha*&#x27;  
! been loni* awaiting, at the ports of Clrtat  
Brita n and France, dispa&#x27;chvs iirtn our  
ministers relating to these verv import­  
ant concerns with both government*. It  
was received at the Department of State  
on the 1 Sih July, 1S12- nearly a month  
alter the declaration of war against^G.  
Britain. Intelligence cf the repeal cf  
the orders in council was not receive cl

month. It was impossible* there*nrc,  
that either of those acts* in whatever  
light they might be viewed, should have  
been taken into consideration* o’ have  
h ,r! any influence in deciding on thut  
, i«v.po» lant ev* nt.  
Had the B*itHh government been dis­  
posed to rep&#x27; a- its orders in council* in  
conformity with the principle on which  
it professed to have itsuco them* and on  
the condition which it ha » itself pre­  
•cribt*d. * here was no reason to c.e&#x27;  
t1 * repeal until su h a decree as iha* ot  
Hr L&#x27;8th Apt *1, 181H should he pyi-duc­  
cd. The declaration of th° French go­  
vernment it August 5, IS!O, had lolly  
satisfied eve*y cl-im c»i tire I&gt; itish go­  
vernment according to its own princi­  
  
| pies on that p^ini. By it the decrees ot  
! Berlin and Milan were declared to be  
repealed. &gt;S;e repeal (o ’ike effect cn &#x27;he  
1st November f ilowit £• on whi »• da&gt;  
it did take effect. T e on&#x27;y condition

Bri ain should follow rl •- example, and  
! repeal her t rd*i s in council, or thai the  
United States should cam into eurct a*  
! gainst h r their non-mportatioo i.cf —  
j This condition was in its nature sub e­  
► quent. not precede.•!, reserving a right  
in France to revive her decrees in case  
neither alterna*:ve was p-erfurmed. By  
l t&#x27;ds deetara&#x27;ion it was put completely in  
; the po ver ,t Great Brvain to tcanma c  
this cuntmvr rsy. in a manner ilie most  
&#x27; honor-He to herself. France had yield  
*:c! to hr* • ground on a condition with  
| which ci’e h-d declared her willingness  
to comply. H?d *•!»♦* complied, ii»e non­  
importation art would rr*t have been C2r­  
&#x27; rivd into effect, nor could the french  
decrees have been revis&#x27;d. By reluming  
to comply. she lias m &gt;&lt;!•? herself respou­  
•;it»!e leraii that ha* since followed.  
B« the decree of the 23th Apt »1* 181 !,  
tliC decrees of Beilin mid Milan were  
said lo be definitively repealed : and the  
execution of the run imp &gt;rtation act »•  
gainst Great Biitain was declared to be  
the ground f*t that repeal. i he tepeal  
announced by the declaration oi the 5th  
August, 1810, was absolute and final,  
except as to the condition subsequent  
a.tached to it. This latter dcrrce ac­  
knowledges ihat tha: condition t.aJ been  
perforin&#x27;d, and disclaims tne light to  
revive it, in consequence of that per*  
fnfmsrrp nnrt rx tending back io the  
  
fi st of November, confirms in every cir­  
cumstance the preceding repeal. The  
latter act, therefore, as m tl*t repeal, is  
nothin* more than a cot firm alien oi tue  
former. It is in this sense that those  
t»- o acts are to be understood in France.  
I&lt;. is in the same sense that they arc to  
be regarded by other pow ers.  
In repealing the orders in council cn  
the pretext of the French decice oi the  
28t!i April, 1811, the British govern­  
ment ha* conceded that it ought to have  
repealed tbent on the declaration of the  
5th of August, 1810. It is impossible  
to discriminate between the two act*, or  
to separate them from each other, so as  
to justilv, on sound and consistent prin­  
ciples. the repeal of the orders in coun­  
cil on the ground of one act, and the re­  
fusal to repeal them on that of the other.  
The second act mckes the repeal defi­  
nitive : but for what reason i Because  
the non-importation act had been putin  
force against Great Britain, in compli­  
ance with the condition subsequent at­  
tached to the former repeal, ar.d her re­  
fusal to perforin it. That act being still  
in force, and the decree of the 28lh A­  
pril, 1811. being expressly founded on  
it, Great Britain repeals her orders in  
council on the J. asis oi this latter decree.  
The conclusion is, therefore, irresistible,  
that by this repeal, under all the cir­  
cumstances attending it, the British go­  
vernment has acknowledged the justice  
of the claim of &#x27;tire United States to a  
reper.l cm the former occasion. By ac­  
cepting the latter repeal, it has sanciion­  
cd the preceding one ; it has sanctioned  
also the conduce of this government in  
carrying into effect the non-importation  
act against Great Britain, founded on the  
preceding repeal.  
Other important consequences result  
ftom this repeal of the British govern­  
ment By fair and obvious construction  
the acceptance of the deci ce of the 28th  
April. 1811, as the ground of the repeal  
of the orders in council, ot&gt;%ht to be  
construed to extend back to the 1st No­  
vember, 1910; the day on which the pre­  
  
ceding repeal took effect. The Secre­  
cy of State has full confidence, that it  
the question could be submitted to tne  
judgment of an impartial judicial tnbu*  
ta|, such would be its decision. He has  
-&#x27;qual confidence that such will be tuc  
judgment pronounced on it by the en­  
lightened and impartial world If, bow­  
over, these two acts could be separated  
from each other, so as that the latiei  
might be made the basis of the repeal “1  
ihe orders in council, distinct fr«»in the  
former, it follow* that, bearing date on  
the 8th April, 1811, the repeal ought to  
have relation to mat date. In legal coo»  
sanction, between nations as wc * * «*&#x27; ***’  
dividuals. acts, are to be respected from  
1 the lime they begin to operate, and.  
where tha* impose a morjl or political  
obligation on another party, that obliga­  
tion commences wr: the commencement  
of the act. liut it bus been urged that  
the Fierrch decree was rot proniulgated  
or made known to the British govern­  
ment, until a year after its date. 1 hi?  
ob»cstinii h*^, r.,; force. By accepting  
an act hea&#x27;ing date a year before it &quot;a*  
promulgated, it is admitted that in the  
inter* a: nothing wus done repugnant to  
it. It cannot be pit«umed that any go­  
*crrrnent would scccptfrom another b=.  
the basis on which it v as to found a.;  
impo tunt measure, an act of am e nor  
a d remote ch-it, pledging itself t:i a cer­  
tain coursei&gt;f conduct which tS &gt; go­  
ver: ment Lad in *iie interval G*-p&amp;ned  
from and violated. If ur.y g »vci na.eiH  
i &#x27;d \ if.luted an act the injunctions ot  
wlrch it v,*s bound l» observe Ly an an­  
tf-rjo ■ one, ir, relation to a thiru party,  
•j J which i p&#x27;ofessed to have observed,  
!).r,rc its .c eptmee by the other, it  
f-. y &lt;\ not b.* presumed that it would  
. ,-c to violate ii alter tlic acceptance.  
The conclusion is irresistable, that if  
the other government did accept such  
j.&#x27;t with a kn&#x27;mJtdsC of its antecedent  
vi iaiion, as li.c foundation of any mea­  
sure i n its own part, that such act must  
* t i 1 _1  
  
have D&#x27;eii u.e ubiciaiui^ uiuy, &lt;u.u uui  
ll.e rca! motive of such measure.  
The declaration of the Prince Regent  
of the 2Ut April, 1811, is in full con­  
firmation of these remarks. By thisac:  
of the British government it is formally  
announced, on the authority of a report  
oi the Secretary of Fore; *1 Affairs to  
the C( nsrrva’ive Senate of France, that  
the French decrees were still in force,  
d that the oi tiers in council should not  
be repealed. It cannot fail to excite  
considerable su*pr ze that the British  
| government should immediately after­  
&#x27; wards, tiw is, on the Tod Joric, iej#c..;  
j its orders in c« unci!, on the groe* ri ui  
j the Fret rh decree of the ^ 8ii« April,  
1811 Bv this proceedingthe British  
government has involved useli in vn-ir\­  
fest inconsistency. It lus maintained  
by r*r»r act. that t- t French decree - Wf-re  
in full fo* cc. and by another that il.e^  
were repeal&#x27; d dur ngtne s me tpacc cf  
time. I* adiniu al*o, tbai by no act of  
tlte French government or its ernizers,  
had any violation of the repeal announc* ,  
ed bv the declaration of the French go- ;  
vcri»nient of the 5th August, 18.0. b^en  
commit’ed, or at le^t. that such viola*  
tion had not had sufficient weight to pre­  
vent the repeal of-tiie orders in council.  
It was objected that die declaration ol  
the French government of ti e 5th of  
August. 1810, was m: sur.h an act as  
the B’ittsh government ought to have  
rega ded The Sec t ctarv of State is tho­

highest off rial orpafi, the Secretary of  
Foreign Affairs, t»&gt; the Minister Piet.i­  
potciti irv c f the UnileJ States at Paris,  
ft is impossible to conceive an act more  
formal, authentic or obligatory on the  
French government, than that alluded  
tf&gt;. Does one government ever ask or  
expect from another to secure tlie per­  
formance of any duty, however impon­  
a. t, more than ifs official pledge, fairly  
and folly expressed l Cm better secu­  
rity be given for its performance ? Had  
there been anv doubt on this subject the  
conduct of Great Bitaia herself, in si­  
milar c;*sc«, wculd have completely re­  
moved it. The whole history cf her  
diplomatic intcicsurse with other pow­  
ers, on the subject cf blockade, is in ac­  
co&#x27;d with this proceedingof the French  
government. We know that when her  
government institutes a blockade, the  
secretary of foreign aft; irs announces it  
| »o the ministers of other powers at Lon­  
• don ; ar*d that the same form is observ­  
ed w hen they are revoked. Nor was the  
authenticity of either act, thu* announc­  
ed, ever questioned.  
Had a similar declaration been made  
by the minister of France in the United  
Slates to this government, by the order  
of his own, would it not have been enti­  
tled to respect, and been respected ? By  
the usage of nations such respect could  
not have been withheld. The arrange­  
ment made with Mr. Etskine is a full  
ptoof of the good faith of this govern­  
ment, and of its impartiality, in its trans­  
actions with both the belligerents. It  
was made with that minister on the  
ground of his public character, and the  
confidence due td it: on which basis the  
non-intercourse was removed as to Eng­  
land ar.d left in full force against France.  
The failure of that arrangement was im  
putable to the British government slone.  
who* io rejecting it, took on itself a high  
responsibility, not simply, in regard to  
the consequences attending it, but in  
disavowing and annulling the act of its  
minister, without shewing that be bad  
exceeded his authority. In accepting  
the declaration of the French minister  
  
a  
of forei*fl affair*, in prcofcf the Frer.c-M  
repeal, the United Slate* gave no pc.  
of improper cicdewe 10 the goreriiuict/ *

transactions, ii will appear that if a m«uk- J

of the 21st April 1812, and the icpeal oi  
the 23d June of the Same year, arec*  
quallv and in like mam.cr conditional.—  
It is not e little surprising. that the Bri­  
tish government should have objected  
to a measure in ai other government, to  
which it has itself gheu a sanction by its  
own acts. It is proper, however, tore*  
mark that this objection has been com­  
pletely waved Sc given up bv the accep­  
tance of the decree of the 28 th of Aj/ril.

also, that it could not confide in the

into relative to tl&#x27;.e repeal of its decree*

oidcrs in council was not to be ascril-r^ \
to the Fiench decree bearing dat**011  
the 28&#x27; h April 1811 ; and secondly that  
in making that decree the basis oi tie*  
repeal, the British government has t.

rat to those sentiments, and  
the patriotic support of their  
euls. Had they proved  
ves unequal to the crisis, the  
a! consequences w ould have  
from it. The proof of their  
*s v ould have been monied;  
on them alone would its  
effects have been veiled.  
I h. ve shaken the foundation  
government i‘self. and even  
►acted principles of the revo­  
on whit hall our political in­  
(is depend. Yielding to the  
ions of a foreign power, wit li­  
king a manly effort in defence  
rights, without appealing to  
ttie of the people, or to the  
h of ton l_iion.it would have  
jurged and believed that ix;  
►urces lay the hidden detects,  
would the good people ol  
lates have been able to make  
*stund? Where would have  
eir rallying point ? The go­  
nt of their choice bavin*:  
shoTvoved, its weakness and  
their institutions demonstrat ■  
triumph of the enemy would  
  
have been comptete. It vould alto  
have been durable.  
The constituted authorities of the  
U. States neither dreaded or antici­  
pated these evils. They had full  
confidence in the strength of the U­  
nion, in the firmness and virtue of  
(he people, and were satisfied, w hen  
the appeal should be made, that am­  
ide proof would be afforded, that  
tueir confidence had not hern mis­  
placed. Foreign pressure, it was  
not doubted, would soon dissipate fo­  
reign partialities and prejudices, if  
such existed, and unite us more  
closely together as one people.  
In declaring war against G. Bri­  
tain the U. States have placed them­  
selves in a situation to retort the  
hostility, which they had so long  
suffered from the British govern­  
ment. The niaintaiiianee of their  
rights was the object of the war.  
on he desire of this government to  
terminate the war on honorable  
conditions, ample proofhas been af­  
forded by the proposition made to  
ffoe British government, immediate­  
ly after the declaration of war,  
through the Charge d’AfTuires of  
thr United States at London, and by  
the promptitude an 1 manner of the  
acceptance of the Mediation of the  
Finperorof Russia.  
Jt was anticipated by sonic, that a  
declaration of war against G.Britain  
w ould force the Uniied Stares into a  
&lt;*!o«e connection with her adversary,  
much to their advantage. The Se­  
cretary of Stale thinks it proper to  
remark, that nothing is more re­  
mote from the fact. The.discrimi­  
nation in favor of France, according  
U law, in consequence of her accep­  
tance. of the proposition made equal­  
ly to both powers* produced a differ­  
ence between them in that special  
(ml in Mi of mi!v. vv i r Yvitii  
  
England was declared, wit limit any  
concert or cmumnnicsiiion with the  
French government; il has produced  
no connection between the United  
States and France, or any under­  
standing as to its prosecution, conti­  
nuance. or termination. The osten­  
sible relation between the two coun­  
tries, is the true and only one. The  
IJ. States have just claims on France  
for spoliations on their commerce on  
the high s**as. am! in the ports of  
France, and their fate Minister was  
and their present Minister is, in­  
structed, to demand reparation for  
theseir juries, and to press il with (ho  
energy due i»&gt; the justice of their  
claims and to the character of the  
U. States. Toe result of the nego  
elation wili he communicated to con  
gross hi due time. The papers (nark­  
ed I contain copies of two letters,  
addressed from this Department to  
Mr. Barlow, one of the 16th June.  
1812. just before the declaration of  
war, the other of the lith July fol­  
lowing, which shew distinctly, the  
relation existing between the United  
•States and France at that interest­  
ing period. No change has since  
&#x27; occurred in it.  
All of which is respectfully sub­  
mitted.

1811, has the honor to make to the president wh”  
  
following REPORT :—  
  
In furnishing the information required by the  
house of representatives, the secretary of state pre-  
sumes, that it might&#x27;be deemed sufficient for him to  
state what is now demanded, what part thereof has  
been heretofore communicated, and to supply the  
deficiency. He considers it however more contorm-  
able to the views of the house; to meet at this time,  
without regarding what has been already communi.  
cated, every enquiry, and to give 2 distinct answer  
to each, with the proper explanation relating to it.  
  
The house of representatives has requested infor.  
mation, when, by whom, and in what manner, the  
first intelligence was given to this government of the  
decree of the government of France, bearing date  
on the 28th of April, 1811, and purporting to bea  
definitive repeal of the decrees of Berlin and Milan;  
whether Mr. Russell, late charge d’affaires of the  
United States to the government of France, ever  
admitted or denied to his government the correct-  
ness of the declaration of the duke of Bassano, ta  
Mr. Barlow, as stated in Mr. Barlow’s letter of the  
12th May, 1812, to the secretary of state, that the  
said decree had been Communicated to his, Mr. Bar-  
low’s predecessor there, and to lay before the house  
any correspondence with Mr. Russell on that subject,  
whieh it may not be improper ‘te communicate, and  
also any correspondence between Mr. Bariow and  
Mr. Russell in possession oi the department of  
;state; whether the minister of France to the United  
| States ever informed this government of the exist-  
‘ence of the said decrees, and to lay before the house  
any correspondence with the said minister relative  
thereto not improper to be communicated; with  
any other information in possession of the executive,  
which he may not deem it injurious to the public  
interest to disclose, relative to the said decree,  
tending to shew at what time, by whom and in what  
manner, it was first made known to this government  
or to any of its representatives cT aremts ; and last-  
ly, to inform the house whether tie government of  
the United States hath ever received irem that of  
France any explanation of the reasons of that de-  
cree being concealed from this government, and its  
minister, for so long a time after its date, and if such  
explanation has been asked by this government, and  
has been omitted to be given by that of France,  
whether this government lias made any remorstrance  
or expressed any dissatisfaction to the government  
of France at such concealmert.  
  
These enquiries embraces two distinct objects.  
The first relates to the conduct of the government  
of France, in regard to this decree. The second, to  
that of the government of the United States. In  
satisfying the call of the house, on this latter point,  
it seems to be proper to meet it in a two fold view ;  
first, as it relates to the conduct of this government  
in this transaction; secondly, as it relates to its  
conduct towards both belligerents in some impor-  
tant circumstances connected with it. The resolu-

gree of the 28th April, 1811, was communicated  
by Mr. Barlow, m a letter bearing date on the 12th  
May, 1812, which was received by this department  
on the 13th July following ; that the first intimation  
to Mr. Barlow, of the existence of that decree, as  
appears by his communications, was given by the  
duke of Bassano, in an infarmal conference on some  
day between the Ist and 10th of May, 1812, and that  
the official communication of it to Mr. Barlow, was  
made on the 10th of that month, at his request : that  
Mr. Barlow transmitted a copy of that décree, and  
of the duke of Bassano’s letter, announcing it to  
Mr. Russell, in a letter of May 1ith, in which  
he also informed Mr. Russell, that the duke of  
Bassano had stated that the decree had been duly  
coramunicated to him: that Mr. Russell replied, in  
a letter to Mr. Barlow of the 29th May, that his  
first knowledge of the decree was derived from his  
letter, and that he has repeatedly stated the same  
since this government. The paper marked A isa  
copy of an extract of Mr. Barlow’s letter to the  
department of state, of May 12, 1812; B, of the  
duke of Bassano’s letter to Mr. Barlow, of the 10th  
of the same month ; C, of an extract of Mr. Barlow’s  
letter to Mr. Russell of May 11th; D, of an extract  
of Mr. Russeli’s answer of the 29th May, and E, of  
Mr. Russell’s letter to the department of state of  
the SOth.  
  
decrees, that the British orders, in council should  
be repealed. Mr Russell’s note to lord Castlerea;  
bears date on the 20th of May ; lord Castlereagh’s  
reply on the 23d, in which he promised to submit  
the decree to the consideration of the Prince Regent,  
It appears, however, that no encouragement was  
given at that time to hope that the orders in council  
would be repealed in consequence of that decree ;  
and that although it was afterwards made the  
ground of their repeal, the repeal was nevertheless  
to be ascribed to other causes. Their repeal did  
not take effect until the 23d of June, more thana  
month after the French decree had been laid before’  
the British government; a delay indicating, in it-  
self, at a peried so momentous and critical, not  
merely neglect but disregard of the French decree.  
That the repeal of the British orders in council was  
not produced by the French decree, other proofs  
might be adduced. Iwill state one, which in addi-  
tion to the evidence contained in the letters from Mr.  
RusseH, herewith communicated marked G. is deem-  
ed conclusive. In the communication of Mr. Baker  
to Mr. Graham, on the 9th August, 1812, which  
was founded on instructions from his government,  
of as late date as the 17th June, in which heéstated,  
that an official declaration would be sent to this  
country, proposing a conditional repeal of the or-  
ders in council, so far as they affected the United

French government and the result of the communi-

cited by Mr. Barlow’s communication, that a prior  
letter of May, 1811, in which he had transmitted a  
copy of the decree for the information of this go-  
vernment, had not been received. Further explana-  
tions were expected from Mr. Barlow, but ngne were  
given. The light in which this transaction was view-  
ed by this government was noticed by the President  
in hismessage to congress,and communicated also to  
Mr. Barlow ina letter of the 14th July, 1812, witha  
view to the requisite explanation from the French go-  
vernment. On the 9th day of May, 1812, the emperor  
left Paris for the north, and in two days thereafter  
the duke of Bassano followed him. A negociation  
for the adjustment of injuries, and the arrangement  
of our commerce, with the government of France,  
long depending, and said to have been brought near-  
ly to a conclusion, at the time of Mr. Barlow’s death,  
was suspended by that event. His successor, lately  
appointed, is authorised to resume the negociation,  
  
and to conclude it. He is instructed to demand re-|  
  
dress of the French government for erery injury,  
and an explanation of its motive for withholding  
from this government a knowledge of the decree  
for so long a time after its adoption,  
  
It appears by the documents referred to, that Mr.  
Barlow lost no time, after having obtained a know-  
ledge of the existence of the French decree of the  
28th April, 1811, in demanding a copy of it, and  
transmitting it to Mr. Russell, who immediately laid

ed repeal was to depend not on what the French  
government had already done, but on what it might  
do, and on arrangements to be entered into with  
the United States, unconnected with the French  
repeal.  
  
The French decree of the 28th April, 1811, was  
transmitted to the United States by the Wasp, a  
public vessel, which had been long awaiting, at the  
ports of Great Britain and France, despatches from  
our ministers relating to these very important con-  
‘cerns with both governments. It was received at  
the department of state on the 13th July, 1812, near-  
ly a month after the declaration of war against  
Great Britain. Intelligence of the repeal of the  
orders in council was not received until about the  
middle of the following month. It was impossible,  
therefore, that either of those acts, in whatever  
light they might be viewed, should have been taken  
into consideration, or have had any influence in de-  
ciding on that important event.  
  
Had the British government been disposed to re-  
peal its orders in council, in conformity with the  
principle on which it professed to have issued them,  
&#x27;and on the condition which it had itself prescribed,  
there was no reason to delay the repeal until such a  
decree as that of the 28th of April, 1811, should  
be produced. The declaration of the French go-  
yernment of August 5, 1810, had fully satisfied  
every claim of the British government according to  
its own principles on that point. By it the decrees  
of Berlin and Milan were declared to be repealed,  
the repeal to take effect on the first November fol

rench government, of its decrees, and to look to its conduct  
petite that Sr its cruizers, sanctioned by the government, for the  
faithful sk oy or violation of it. _The United States having  
been injured y both powers, were unwilling, in their exertions to  
obtain justice of either, te becume the instrument of the other.—  
They wert the less inclined to itin the prescnt instance, from the  
consideration, that the party making the pressure on them main-  
mined in full force its unlawful edicts against the American com-  
merce, While it could not a that a considerable advance, at  
Jeast, had been made by the other towards a complete accommoda-  
tion, it being manifest to the world, not only that the faith of the  
French governmeut stued pledged for the repeal of its degrees, but  
that the repealdid take effect on the Istof November, 1810, in re-  
ard to the United States; that several American vessels taken  
under them had been delivered up, and judicial decisions suspend-  
edon all, by its order, and that it also continued to give the most  
sitive assurances that the repeal should be faithfully observed.  
Ithas also been urged that the French repeal was conditional, |  
ed fur that reason could not be be acecpted. This objection has  
already been fully answered. It merits attention, however, that  
the acts of the British pepe relating to this subject, particu-  
larly the declaration of the 21st of April 1812, and the repeal of the  
o3d June of the same year, are equally and inthe like manner con-  
ditivnal. Itis nota little surprising, that the British government  
should have objected to a measure in anotber governme: t, to  
which it bas itself given a sanction by itsown acts. Itis proper,  
however, to remark, that this objection has been completely waved  
and given up by the acceptance of the decree of the 28th April,  
  
811. &gt;  
The British government has urged also, that it could not confide  
  
  
  
ju the faithful performanee by the French government of any en-  
gegement it might enter into relative to the repeal of its decrees, |  
This objection would be equally applicable to any other compact |  
ty be entered into with France. While maintained it wouid be aa bur |  
to any treaty, even toa treaty of peace, between them. Bat ital-|  
sy has been admitted to be unfounded by the acceptance of the de-  
cree of the 28th April, 1811.  
  
The secretary of state presumes that these facts and explana-  
tions, supported as they are by authentic documents, prove, first,  
that the repeal of the British orders in council was not to be aserib-  
ed tothe French decree bearing date on the 28th April, 1811; and  
secoudly, that in making that deeree the basis of their repeal, the |  
Rritish government has conceded that it ought to have repealed |  
them on the ground of the declaration of the French government  
  
  
  
of the 5th August 1810, so as to take eifect on the Ist November,  
  
following. To what cause the repeal of the British orders in|  
council was justly attributable, cannot now remain a doult, with  
any who have marked with a just discernment the course of events.

toa free people. To surrender our seamento British impress  
ment, with the destrucsion of our navigation and conunerce, would  
not have been its only evils. The desolation of property, however  
  
extand widely spread, affects au interest which adinits of repair.  
The wound is incurable only, which fixes a stigma on the national  
honor. While the spirit of the people is unsubdued, there will al-  
ways be found in their virtuea resource equal to the greatest dau-  
gersand most trying emergencics. Itis in the uature of free go-  
vernment, to inspire in the body of the people generous and nuble  
sentiments, and itis the duty of the constituted anthorities to che  
rish and ayers to those sentiments, and to rely on the patriotic  
support of Uicir constituents. Had they proved theinselves unequal  
to the crisis, the most fatal consequences would have resulted trom  
ite The proof of their weakness would have been recorded; but  
not on them alone would its baneful effects have been visited. It  
would have shaken the foundation of the government itself, aud  
even of the sacred principles of the revolution, on which ail our  
political institutions depend, Vielding to the pretensions of a fo-  
reigi power, Without making a manly effort in defence of our  
rights, without appealing to the virtue ot’ the people, or to the  
swength of our Union, it would have been charyced and believed  
that iu th se sources lay the hidden defects. Where would the good  
people of th. se states have been able to make another stand ?—  
Where would have been their rallying point? The government of  
their choiee having been dishonored, its weakness aud that of their  
institutions demonstrated, the triumph of the enemy would hare  
been complete. It would also have been durable.  
  
The constituted authoritics of the United States neither dreaded  
nor anticipated these evils. They had full confidence in the strength  
oi the Union, ia the firmness and virtue of the people, and were  
  
satisfied, when the appeal should be made, that ample f ,  
be atfo rded, that their confidence had not been misplaced.&quot; Foc  
  
pressure, it was not doubted, would soon dissipate foreign partiali-  
tics and projudiccs, if such existed, and unite us more close y loge

placed Uiemselyes in @ sitvation to retort the hostility, which the

ruught forward and urged again, when it wight be done with et-!  
feet. ln the meat Gime the practice of iimpressment was to be |  
  
p ts: Vered in with vigor.  
  
At the time when war was declared against Great Britain, no sa- |  
tisfactory arrangement was offered, or likely to be obtained, re- | the po  
  
sp-cting impressment, and nothing was nore remote from the ex-  
p ctation of this government, than the repeal of the orders in coun-  
cil. Every cireumstance which had occurred tending to illustrate  
the policy and views of the British government rendered such an  
event aliogether imprvbable. From the commencement of that  
system of hostility, which Great Britain had adopted against the  
United States, her pretensions had gradually increased, or at least  
me more fully unfulded, according to circumstances, until at  
the noment when war was dclared, they had assumed a charac-|  
ter which dispelled all prospect of accommodation. The orders  
in counci] were saidto have been adopted on a principle of reta-  
lietion on France, although at the time when the order of May  
1806, was issued, no measure of France had occurred on which it  
eould be retaliatory, and at the date of the next order January 1807,  
it was hardly possible this government should have even heard of  
the decree of Berlin to whieh it related. It was stated at the time  
of their adeption, and fur some time afterwards, that they should  
be revoked as soon as France revoked her decrees, and that che  
British government would procerd with the rovernment of France  
peri passu in the reyucation. After the r-vocation, however, of  
the French government of the 5th August 1810, by which the Ber-  
liu and Milan decrees were declared to be repealed, the British go-  
vernment changed its tone, and continued to rise ia its demands, to  
the Moment that war was declared. It objected first that the  
French repeal was conditional, and not absolute ; althongh the  
Oily condition attached to it, was, that Great Britain sheuld follow  
the example, or the United States fulfil their pledge by executing  
the non-importation act against her, It was then demanded that  
rance should repeal her internal regulations, as a condition of the  
repeal of the British orders in council. Next, that the French r-  
yo should be extended to all neutral nations,as well as to the U.  
iates ; and lastly, that the ports of her enemies, and all ports from  
which the British flag was excluded,should be opened to British ma-  
Dufactures in American vessels; conditions so extravagant as to sa-  
usly all dispassionate minds that they were demanded, not in the  
€xpectation that they would or could be complied with, but to ter-  
Minate the discussion.  
  
On full consideration of all cireumstances, it appeared that the  
Period had arrived, when it becaine the duty of the United States  
10 take that attitude with Great Britain, which was due to their  
Violated rights, to the security of their most important interests,  
  
  
  
aid to their character as an independent nation. To have shrunk

red several resolutions of the House cf  
Hefiresentativc* of the 21 st ult. request­  
ing information on certain jioir.ts r~lutu:g  
to the French decree of the 2Xth o/ sf/mt,  
1811. has the honor to make to the Freti­  
dent the following Report :—  
In furnishing the information required by  
the House of Representatives ihe Secretary  
of State psesumes, that it might be deemed  
sulheient fer him to state what is now de­  
^^nanded, what part thereof has been hereto­  
&#x27;ate communicated, and to supply the defi­  
&#x27;• cichcy. ll£ considers it however more con  
formable to the view* of Lite House, to meet  
at this time, without regarding ulint-has  
been abeady communicated, every enquiry,  
and to give a distinct answer to each with the  
proper explanation relating to it.  
The House of Representatives has re  
«|oer cd information, when, by whom, 8c in  
what manner, the first intelligence was gi  
\cu to this government of rtie decree cf the  
government of France, bearing date on the  
28ih April, 1811, and purport:, g to be n de­  
finitive repeal of the decrees of Berlin Jc M—  
Ian; whether Mr. Russell, late Charge d’­  
AflTuires of the United State* to the govern­  
ment of France, ever admitted or denied to  
his government the correctness of the decla­  
ration c! the Duke of Hassano, to Mr. Barlow,  
as stated in Mr. Harlow’s letter of the 12th  
May, 1812, to the Secretary t f State, that  
the said decree had been communicated to  
his, Mr. Barlow’s predecessor there, and to  
lay before Ute House any correspondence  
with Air. Russell on that subject, which it  
fr&gt;ay not be improper to communicate, and  
  
also any correspondence between Mr. Bar­  
low and Mr. Russell in possession of die De  
pact u ent of State ; whether the Minister of  
France to the United States ever informed  
this government ot the existence of the said  
decree, and to lay before the House any cor­  
respondence with .he said Minister relative  
thereto not improper to be communicated ;  
with any other information in possession of  
the Executive, which he mtfy not deem it in­  
jurious to the public interr-’t ,o disclose, ve­  
Jalive to the saidr decree,-tending to shew at  
what time, by whom and in what manner,  
It was first made known to this government  
or to any of its representatives or agents ;  
and hrt&#x27;.y, to infotm the House whether the  
government of the United States hath ever  
received from that of France any explanati­  
on oi&#x27; the reasons «»f that decree btirg «bn  
ccaled from this government and its minis­  
ter. for so long a time after its date, and it  
€lich explanatu n has been asked by tliiv go  
-verament, and hns been omitted to be given  
by that of France, whether this government&#x27;  
has made any remonstrance or expressed ti­  
ny dissatisfaction to the government of  
France at such concealment.  
Tuvse ei quince embrace two distinct ob­  
jects. The lit st relates to the conduct of the  
government ot France, in regaryl to this de~  
cree. The second, to that of the govern­  
ment of the United State a. In satisfying the  
call of the House, on this latter point, it seems  
to ba proper to meet it in a two-fold view;  
first, a» it relates to die conduct of this go­  
vernment in this transaction ; secondly, as it  
relates to us conduct towards both belliger­  
ents in some important circunutances con­  
nected with it. The resolutions do not call  
specially for a report of such extent, but as  
the measures of the Executive, and the nets  
of Congress, four,dv&#x27;doncommunications from  
the Executive, which relate to one of tne  
belligerents, have by ucccs-ai y consequence  
an immediate lelatim to the other, such a  
report seems to be obviously comprised with­  
in their scope. On this principle the report  
is prepared, in the expectation, that the  
mure lull the information given, on every  
bianch nl the subject, the more satisfactory  
will it he to the House.  
  
Ibo bccict-ry &lt;&gt;i state has tr.e honor  
to report* in reply to these enquiries,that the  
first intelligence which this government  
received of the Fr. decree of the 28th April  
1811, was communicated by Mr. barlow, in  
a letter bearing date on the 12th May, 1222,  
■which was received by this department on  
the 13th July following ; that the first inti­  
mation to Mr. Barlow of the existence of  
that decree* ?.s appears by his communicati­  
ons, was giien by the Duke of bassano, in  
un informal conference on some day between  
. the Ut and 10th ot May, 1812, and that the  
official communication of it to Mr. barlow  
war made on the 10th of that month at his  
request : that Mr. barlow transmitted a co­  
py of that decree, and of the Duke of bas.  
tano’s letter, announcing it, to Mr. Bussell,  
k in a lettt r ot M vy 11th, in which lie als&gt;o m* |

The Hecfetaryof State reports aFo that no  
C.cmiuunteatof the decree nf the 28‘dt  
April, ISll. was ever made to this govern­  
ment by the MMHsterofFrftr.ce, or other  
pCTsvn, than avis above atated, and thu* or,  
■a-i? *  
  
explanation of the cause of its not having  
been communicated to this government ani  
published «t the time of its date, was evci  
made to this government, or so far as it i­  
informed to the representatives or agents ni  
the U. States in Europe. The Minister ol  
France has beta asked to explain the cause  
ot a proceeding apparently so extraordinary  
and exceptionable, who replied that his first  
intelligence of that decree was received by  
the Wasp, in a letter from the duke of Bas­  
sano of May 10th, 13^2, in which he express  
ed his surprise excited by Mr. Barlow’s  
ct mmunieation, that a prior letter of May,  
1811, in which he had transmitted a copy ol  
the decree for the information of this govern  
ment had not been received. Further ex­  
planations were expected from Mr. Barlow,  
but none were given. The light in which  
this transaction was viewed by this govern­  
ment was noticed by the President in his  
message to Congress, and communicated al­  
io to Mr. Barlow in a letter of the 14th July,  
1812, with a view to the requisite explanati­  
on from the French government. On the  
9lh day of May, 1812, the Emperor left Pa­  
ris for the North, and in two days thereaf­  
ter the Duke of Bassano followed him. A  
negotiation for the adjustment of injuries,  
and the arrangement of our commerce,  
with the government of France, long depen­  
ding, and said to have been brought pearly  
to a conclusion, at the time of Mr. Barlow&#x27;s  
death, was suspended by that event. His  
successor, lately appointed, is authorised to  
resume the ncgociation, and to conclude it.  
He is instructed to demand redress of the  
French government for every injury, and an  
explanation of its motive fer withholding  
from this government a knowledge of the  
decree foi so long a time after its adoption.  
It appears by die documents referred to,  
that Mr. Barlow lost no time, after having  
obtained a knowledge of the existence of  
the French decree of the £Sih April, 1811,  
in demanding a copy of it, and transmitting  
it to Mr. Rusrell, who immediately laid it  
before the British government, urgi.ig, on  
the ground of this new proof of the repeal  
of the French decrees, that the British or­  
ders in council should be repealed. Mr.  
Russell’s rote to Lord Castlercagh bears  
date on the 20th of May ; Lord Castle­  
reagb’s reply on the 23 I, in which he pro­  
mised to submit live decree to the consider­  
  
au&#x27;inn me rnnce ltegent. It appears how­  
ever, that no encouragement was given at  
that time to hope that the orders in council  
wouid be repealed in consequence of that  
decree; and that although it was afterwards  
made the ground of their repeal, the repeal  
was nevertheless to be nscribed to other  
causes. Their repeal did not take effect un­  
til the 23d of June, more than a month af­  
ter the French decree had been Kid before  
the British government; a delay indicating  
in itself, at a period so momentous and cri­  
tical, not merely reglect but disregard of  
the French decrees. That the repeal of  
die British orders in council was not pro­  
duced by the French decree, other proofs  
might be adduced. I will state one, which  
in addition to the evidence contained in the  
letters from Mr. Russell, herewith commu­  
nicated htarked G, is dieim-d conclusive_  
lu thy communication of Mr. Baker toMr,  
Graham, on the 9th August, 1812, which  
was founded on instructions from his go­  
vernment. of as late date as the 17th June,  
in which he stated,that an official dcclara*  
tion would be stmt to this country, proposing  
a conditional repeal of the orders in coun­  
cil, so far us they affected the U. S. no no­  
tice whatever was taken of the French de­  
cree. One ot the conditions then contcm­  
plated was, that the orders in council  
should be revived at the end of 8 months.  
Unless ihe conduct of the French govern­  
ment and the result of the communications  
with the government of the U. S. should  
be such as in the opinion of the British go­  
vernment to render their revival unneces­  
sary ; a condition which proves incontesti­  
bly that the French decree was not consi­  
dered by the British government a suffici­  
ent ground on which to repeal the ci ders in  
t.ouucil. It proves also that on that day the  
British government had resolved not to re­  
peal the orders on the basis of that decree ;  
since tlie proposed repeal was to depend  
not on what ihe French government had al­  
ready done, but on what it might do, and  
on arrangements to be entered into with the  
U. Slates unconnected with the French re­  
peal.  
  
The French decree of the 28th April,  
1811, was transmitted to the U. States by  
the Wasp, a public vessel, which had been  
long awaiting, at the ports of Great Britain  
and France, dispatches from our ministers  
relating t» these very important concerns,  
with both governments. It was received at  
the Department of State on the 13th July,  
1812, nearly a month after the declaration  
of war against Greet Britain. Intelligence  
cf the repeal of the orders In council was  
not received until about the middle of the  
following month. It was impossible, there­  
fore, that either of those acts, in whatever  
light they might be viewed, should have been  
taken into Consideration, or have had any  
influence in deciding on that important e­  
vent.  
Had t!ie British government been dispik­  
ed to repeal its orders in council,,^.  
funnily with tlie principle.oil *hic.iMtPjprit«  
fessed to have issued them, and oritjfv con­  
dition Which it had itself prescribed! there  
wa.no reason to delay the repeal until such  
&#x27; h decree as that of the J?8ih April, 1811,  
should bo produced. The Declaration of  
the French government of August 5, 1H10,  
nail full/ satisfied every claim of the iiri­  
cis.. government according to its own prin­  
ciple* «n tna point. By it the decrees of  
Berlin and Mun i were declared to be re  
re peat-4, the repeal to take cll&#x27;ect on the  
1st K &#x27;. ember following, on which day it  
did take -fleet. The only condition attach -  
I td to it, was, either that G. Britain should  
l follow the example, and repeal her orders  
in council, «r that the UrtBed States should  
carry i’’t.» rdect against her their non-irnj or­  
tation ..ct. This condition was in Its natifre  
’ subsequent, net precedent, r-serving a right  
| .it France to revive her decrees in case nci  
  
; ther alternative was performed. By this  
i declaration it was put completely in the  
■ power of Great Britain to terminate this con­  
troversy in u manner the most honorable to  
&quot; herself. France had yielded to htr tlie  
ground on a condition with which site had  
declared her willingness to comply. Had  
she complied, the non importation act  
would not have been carried into effect, nor  
could the French decrees have been revi­  
ved. By tvfusing to comply, she has made  
herself responsible&#x27;for ail tii.it has since fol­  
lowed.  
By the decree of the 28th April, *811, the  
decrees of Berlin ar.d Milan were said to be  
definitively repealed ; and the execution of  
1 the non-importation act against G. Britain  
was declared to be the ground of that re­  
peal. The repeal announced by tlie decla»­  
ation of the 5th August, 1812, was absolute  
and final, except as to the condition subse­  
quent attached to it. This latter decree  
acknowledges that that condition had been  
performed, and disclaims the right to re­  
vive it, in consequence of that performance  
aird, extending back to the first of Novem­  
ber, confirms in e-. ery circumstance the pre  
ceding repeal. The latter act, therefore,  
as t j the repeal, is nothing more than a  
confirmation of the former. It is in this sense  
that those two acts are to he understood in  
France. It is in the same sense that they  
are to be regarded by other powers.  
In repealing the orders in council on the  
pretext of the French decree of the 28:h  
April, 1211, the British government lias con­  
ceded that it ought to have repealed them  
on the declaration c f the 5th of August, 1810.  
It is impossible to discrimatc between the  
two acts, cr to separate them from each  
other, so as to justify, on sound and consist­  
ent principles, the repeal of the orders in  
council on the ground of one act, anti the re»  
fusal to repeal them enthat of the other.—  
The see .»r.d act makes the repeal definitive ;  
but for vrhn: reason? Eecausc the non-im­  
portation act had been put in lorce against  
Great-Britain, in compliance with die con­  
dition subsequent attached to the former re­  
peal, and her refusual to perform it. That  
act being still in force, anil the decree of the  
23Ji April, 1811, being expressly founded  
on it, Great Britain repeals her orders in  
council on the basis of this latter decree.——  
The conclusion is, therefore, iriesistible,  
that by this repeal, under ull the circum­  
stances attending it, the British government  
has acknowledged the justice of the claim  
of the United States to a repeal cn the for­  
mer occasion. By accepting the latter re­  
peal, it has sanctioned the preceding one ;  
it has sanctioned also the conduct efthisgo­  
vernmcnt.in earn ing into effect the non-im­  
portation act against Great-Britain, found­  
ed on the preceding repeat.  
  
Other Important cpnsequeiTcr*: rc*it!t from  
this repeal of the lhitish government, by  
fair wild ubviotu Construction l’u acceptance  
of the decree of the 28th April. 1311, as the  
ground of the repeal of orders in council,  
ought to be construed to extend buck to the  
lst Nov. 1810, the day on which the p reced­  
ing repeal took effect. The Secretary of  
State has full confidei.ee, that if the question  
could be submitted to the judgment of an  
impartial judicial tribunal, such would be  
its decision. lie lias equal confidence that  
such will be the judgment pronounced on ir  
by the enlightend and impartial world. If,  
however, these two acts couid be separated  
from each other, so as that the la&#x27;ter might  
be made the basis of the repeal cf the or­  
ders in council distinct from the former, it  
follow;; that bearing date on the 28th April,  
1811, the repeal ought to have relation to  
that date, in legal construction, between  
nations as well ns individuals, acts, are tobc  
respected from the time they begin to ope­  
rate., and, where they impose a moral or po.  
l.tiCal obligation on another party, that ob­  
ligation commences with tii.* commencement  
  
me act. out it nusb. cn urged that the  
Flinch decree was not promulgated, or  
m:u!e&#x27;jtnown to the British government, un­  
til a year after its date. This objecti­  
on has no force. By accepting an act (leav­  
ing date a year before it was promulgated,  
it i3 admitted that in the interval nothing  
was done repugnant to it. It cannot be pre  
sumed that any government would accept  
from another, as the basio on which it was  
to found important measures, an act of ante­  
rior and remote date, pledging itself to n  
certain course of conduct which that govern­  
ment hud in the interval departed from and  
violated. If any government had violated an  
act the injunctions of which it was bound to  
observe by anterior one, in relation to a third  
’ party, £&lt; which it professed to have observed,  
before Its acceptance by the other, it could  
not be presumed that it would cense to vio­  
late it after the acceptance. The Conclusi­  
on is irresistible, that if the other govern­  
ment did accept such act with a knowledge  
of its antecedent violation, as the foundation  
of any measure on its own part, that such  
act must have been the extensible only, and  
not the real motive of such measure.  
The declaration of the Prince Urgent of  
tile 21st April 1811,13 in full confirmation of  
these remarks. By this act of the British go­  
vernment it is formally announced, on the  
authority of a report of the Secretary of  
Foreign Affairs to the Conservative Senate  
of France, that the French decrees were  
still in force, and that the orders In council  
should not be repealed, ltcannot fail to ex  
cite considerable surprise that the British  
government should immediate!? afterwards,  
that in, on the 23d June, repeal Its orders in  
council, on the ground of the French decree I  
of the 28th April 1311. By thin proceeding  
the British government has involved itself in  
manifest inconsistency. It has maintained  
by one act, that the French decrees were  
in full force, a:id by another that tiny were  
repealed during the same space of time. It  
admits also, that by no act of the Trench go*  
vrrnment or its end/ers, had any violation  
of the repeal announced by the declaration of  
the French government&quot;of the 3th August  
1310, been committed, or at lea-t that such  
violation had not ha&lt;l sufficient weight  
to prevent the repeal id tra order* in ♦ u.i­  
cil.  
  
It was objected that the declaration of the  
French governmc.it of the 5th of August  
*310, was nut such an act as the British go*  
vernment ought to have regarded. The Se­  
cretary of State is thoroughly satisfied that  
this objection is altogether unfounded. It  
was communicated by the Emperor thro’  
his highest official organ, the Secretary of  
Foreign Affairs, to the minister plenipotemia  
ry of the United States a; Paris. It is im­  
possible to conceive an act more formal, au­  
thentic or obligatory on the French govern­  
ment than that alluded to. Dots one govern­  
ment ever ask or expect from another to se­  
cure the performance of any duty however  
important, more than its official pledge, fair,  
ly «&#x27;*nd fully express* d t Can better securi­  
ty be given for its performance i Had there  
been any doubt on this subject, the conduct  
of Great Britain herself, in similar can’s,  
would have completely removed it. The  
whole history of her diplomatic intercourse  
with other powers, on the subject of block­  
ade, is in accord with this proceeding of the  
French government. We know that when  
her government institutes a blockade, the  
Secretary of Foreign Affairs announces it to  
the ministers of other powers at London ; fk  
that the same form is observed when  
they arc revoked. Ncr was the authentici­  
ty °f cither act, thus announced, ever qtiesli­  
oned.  
  
rlad a similar declaration been made by  
the minister ot France in the United States  
to this government, by the order of his own,  
would it not have been cn i leal to respect, 5c  
been respected? By the usage of nations  
such respect could not have been withheld.  
The arrangement made with Mr. Erskinc  
is a full proof of the good faith of this go  
vemnicm, and of its impartiality, in its  
transactions with b &gt;th the belligerents. It  
was made with that minister on the ground  
ot his public, character, and the ccnfuience  
due it: on which basis the non-intercourse  
was removed as to England and left in full  
torcc against France. The failure of that  
arrangement was imputable to the British  
government alone, who, in rejecting it, took  
«*u itself a high responsibility, not simply, in  
regard to the consequences attending it, but  
in disavowing anti annulling the net o&#x27;fit* mi­  
nister, without shewing that lie had exceed­  
ed hi» authority. In accepting the declara  
tion of the French minister of foreign af­  
fairs, in proof of the French repeal, the Uni­  
ted States gave no proof of improper cre­  
dence to the government of France. On a  
comparison of both transactions, it will ap­  
pear that if a marked confidence and res­  
pect was shewn to either government, it was  
to that ot Great Britain. In nreepting the  
declaration of the government of France in  
the presence ot the Emperor, the United  
Stulcs stood on more secure ground, than, in  
accepting that of a British minister in this  
country.  
To the demand made by the United States  
of the ropi al of the British orders i:i council  
founded or. the basis of^he French-repeal,  
ot August j, 1810, the Bluish government  
replied, by demanding a copy of the orders  
issued by the French government for car­  
rying into effect that repeal ; a demand  
without example in the intercourse between  
nations. By this demand it ceased to be 1  
question whether the French repeal was of  
sufficient extent, or was founded on justi  
fiable conditions. The pledge of the French  
government was doubted ; a scrutiny was to  
be instituted as to themanner in vvhich it was  
to be discharged, and its faith preserved  
net by the subsequent conduct of its cruisers  
towards the vessels of the U. States, but by  
a copy of die orders given to its cruizers.  
Whore would this end? If the French govern  
merit intended a fraud, by its declaration  
of repeal, announced to the minister of the  
United Slates,arid afterwards totliis govern­  
ment, might it not likewise commit a fraud  
in another communication which it might  
make ? If credit was refused by the British  
government to the net of the French govern  
ir.cnt, thus formally announced,is it probable  
that it would have b.en given by it, to any  
document of interior character, directed to  
  
• own pcopie r /vunojgn it was the pol­  
icy and might be the interest of the British  
government to engage the U. Suites in such  
a controversy with the French government,  
it whs fur from comporting with their inter­  
est to do it They considered it their duty  
to accept the repeal already made by the  
French government, of its decrees, £c to  
look its conduct and to that of its cruizcrs,  
sanctioned by the government, for the faith­  
ful performance or violation of it. The U.  
S having been injured by both powers, were  
unwilling, in their exertions to obtain jus­  
tice of either, to become the instrument of  
the other. They were the less inclined to  
it in the present- instance, from the curricl­  
eration, that the party making the pressure  
on them maintained in foil force its unlawful  
edicts against the American commerce,  
while it could not deny that a considerable  
advance, at least, had been made by the  
other towards a complete accommodation,  
it being manifest to the world, not only that  
the faith of the French government stood  
pledged for the repeal of its decrees, but that  
the repeal did take effect on the 1st of Nov.1  
lb 10, in regard to the United States; that  
several American vessels taken under them  
had been delivered up and judicial decisions  
suspended on all, by its order, and that it  
also continued to give the most positive as­  
surances that the repeal should be faithful­  
ly observed.  
It has also been ur~cd that the French  
repeal was conditi mal, and for that reason  
could not be accepted. This objection has  
already been fully answered. It merits at­  
tention, however, that the acts of the Brit&#x27;.h  
government relating to this subject, partic­  
ularly the declaration of the -21st April  
lb!2, and the repeal of the 23d June of the  
*\me year, are equally and in like manner  
conditional. It is not a little surprising, that  
the British government should have object­  
ed to a measure in another government, to  
whicn it h is itself given a sanction by itsow^  
acts. It is proper, however^to remark that  
this objec1 i«&gt;n has been Completely waved and  
given op.by the acceptance of the decree of  
the 28th April, 1;&gt;i t.  
  
The Britis government has urged also,  
that it could not confide in the faithful pet&#x27;  
furinunce by the French government ofauy  
engagement it might i nter into relative t*&gt;  
the repeal of its decrees. This objection,  
would be equally applicable to anv other  
compact to be entered into with Fr. nee.  
VY hile maintained it would be a ber to any  
treaty, even to a treaty of peace, between  
them. But it also ha-, been admitted to bo  
untounded by the acceptance ot the ce-.ree  
of the 28th April, 1811.  
, * he Secretary of State presumes that  
these tacts and explanation*, supported as  
luey are by authentic documents, or &gt;ve firs&#x27;­  
that the repeal cf the British order, h. coun -  
cH was not to be ascribe! to the French de­  
cree bearing date on the 28th April 1811 ;  
and secondly, that in making that decree  
the basis of their repeal, the British gov­  
ernment has conceded that it ought to have  
repealed them on the ground ot the declai a •  
tion of the French government of 5th Au­  
gust 1810, so as to take ellect cn the 1st  
; No&#x27; cm her following. To what cause the  
i repeal ot the lii iddi orders in council was  
j-i i. y attributable, cannot now remain a  
, doubt, with any, who have marked with a  
ju.st i.r-cemment tite course of events. It  
i umst u.Furd great cons dation to the good pco­  
i I* c of these states, to know that they have  
net submitted to privations in vain.  
Fne discussion of other wrongs, particu­  
Iatly tact relating to impressment, had been  
c!-ed some time before the period alluded  
to. It was unworthy of the character of the  
United .Jtatcs to pursue the di*mission on  
tnat diherence, when it was evident that no  
advantage could he devived from it. The  
ii;pu was reserved, to be brought forward  
and urged again, when it might be done  
v/itli rllcct. In the mean time the practice  
ot impicssmeut v.*ns persevered in with vi­  
lli’*  
  
At the time when war was declared a­  
gajust CJ. li. no satt.v&#x27;actory errangement  
was offered, or likely to be obtained re &#x27;  
specting impresMTK tit, and nothing \VIX&lt;  
more remote, from t!te expectation of this  
government, than the repeal of the orders  
to council. Every circumstance which lied  
occurred tending to illustrate the poiicv anil  
views ot the British government rendered  
saca an event 2I ( getiw r improbable. F.-i rn  
the conintencemem of that system of ho«  
tduy, which G Britain had adopted against  
the u. Slates, her pretensions Itad gradual’y  
increased, or at least become more fully  
moulded, according to circtiinstances «ntil­  
attiie moment when war was declared they  
nad assumed a character which dispelled  
ail pros; ect t.f accommodaiion. The or  
ders in council were said to have been a­  
dopted on apt inciplc of retaliation. »u France  
altlMMighat the time when the order qfAJay  
1806 was issued, no measure of France h ut  
occurred on which it could be retaliatory  
and at the date of the next order January  
1807, n was hardly possible that this ROy­  
ernment should have even heard of the de­  
cree of Berlin to which it related. It was  
suited at the time of their adoption, ard for  
some time afterwards, that tn.y aWl 1 b*  
revoked as soon asFr.ncc revoked herd*,  
crees, and that the British government  
would piocecd with the government cf  
- 1 uo&quot;e fiati fi&#x27;ussu in the revocation. Af­  
ter the declaration, however, of the French  
government of the Silt August 1810 bv  
which the Berlin and Milan decrees tv’ere  
declared to be repealed, the British govern  
ment changed its tone, and continued to rse  
m its demands, to the moment that war \v s  
declared. It objected first that the French  
repeal was conditional, and not absolute •  
although the only condition attached to r/  
was, that G. Britain should fodow th- ex­  
ample, or tic U. States fulfil their pJcdre  
by executing the non-importation act «­  
gamst her. It was then demanded that  
France should repeal her internal regulati­  
ons, as a Condition «&gt;1 tin: repeal of the Bri­  
tish orders in council. Next, that the Frendh  
repeal should be extended mail neutralna­  
tmns, as wtil us to the United States, and  
lastly, that the ports of her enemies’ amt  
all ports from which the British flag’ was  
excluded, should be opened to British m:»­  
nufactures in American vessels; conditions  
&amp;.&gt; extravagant as to satisfy all dispassion­  
ute minds that they were demanded, not ir,  
the expectation that they would or cnuhl  
be complied with, but to terminate the dis­  
cussion.  
  
On full consideration of all cirecms,v&#x27;-r,r \x  
appeared thu Hie period had arrived, wiien i  
became the duty of the United Sn,t*-» to u&gt;-“  
that attitude with Great Urit.in, which w.-.s due  
to their violated rights, to the security of ll t &gt;  
most important interests, and to their cliurae­

Washington, July 12, 18,13. • •  
The Secretary of State, to whom was referred  
several resolutions of the House of Representa­  
tives of the 21 st ult. requesting information on  
certain points relating to the French decree of  
of the 2Hth of Jlpril, 1811, has the honor to  
make to the~wresident the following keporv :  
* In famishing the information required by the  
House of Kepresentatives, the secretary of slate*  
presumes, that it might be deemed sufikieut for  
Kim to state what is now demanded, what parte  
thereof has been heretofore communicated, and  
to supply the deficiency. He consMers it how­  
ever more conformable to the views of the house,,  
to meet at this time, w ithout regarding what has.  
been already communicated, every enquiry, and  
to give a distinct answer to each, with the pro­  
per explanation relating to it.  
  
iiits tmujsr &lt;u nepmtrmuuves u&amp;s requested  
information, when, by whom, and in what inau­  
Ser, the first intelligence was given to this gov­  
ernment of the decreejiof the government of  
France, bearing date on tbe 281 h April, 1811,  
*Hd purporting to be a -definitive repeal of the  
Berlin and Milan decrees; whether Mr. Kussell,  
late Charge d’Affaire* of the United .States to  
the government of France, ever admitted or  
denied to this government the correctness of the  
declaration of the Duke Bus*turn, to Mr.,Bar­  
low, as stated in Mr. Barlow’s letter of the 12th  
May. 1812, to the secretary of state, that the  
said deoree had been eomimiuicated to his, Mr.  
Barlow’s predecessor there, and to lay before the  
house any correspondence with Mr. Kussell on  
that subsert, which it majf not be improper to  
communicate, and also any eorrespomlef.ee be- &#x27;  
tween Mr. Bartow and Mr. Kussell in possession  
of the department of slate; w hether the minis­  
ter of France to the United States ever infurm­  
- fd this government of the existence of the said  
decree, ami to lay before tbe house any corres­  
pondence with the said minisier relative thereto  
not improper to he communicated^ with any oth­  
er information in, possession of the executive,  
Which he may not deem it injurious to the public  
interest to disclose, relative to tbe saiu deeree,  
tending to shew at what time, by whom and, in  
.&#x27;*■What manner, it was first made known lo this  
government or to any of its representatives or  
agents; and lastly, to inform the house whether  
t|ie government of the United States hath ever  
tceeived from that of France any explanation of  
the reasons of that decree being concealed from  
this government, and its minister, for so long a  
time after its date, and if such explanation has  
been asked by this government, and has been o­  
. milted to he given by that of France, whether  
this government lias made any remonstrance or  
expressed any dissatisfaction to the government  
of. France at such concealment. ,

&#x27;1 he secretary of state reports also that %o  
communication of the tlecree of the 28th April,  
18*11, was ever made to this government by the  
minister of France, or other perso^, than as is  
above stated, and that no explanation of the  
cause of its not having been communicated to  
this government and published at the time of its  
date,.^Was ever made to this government, or^ so  
fur as it is informed, to the representatives or  
agents of the United States in Europe. The  
minister of France has been asked to explain  
the cause of a proceeding apparently so extra­  
ordinary and exceptionable, who replied that his  
Qrst intelligence of that deeree was received by  
the Wasp, in a letter from the Duke of Bassano  
of May 10th, 1812, in which h« expressed his  
surprise, excited by Mr; Barlow’s communica­  
tion, that afprior le,ter of May, 1811, in w hich  
he had transmitted i^copy of the deeree lor the  
information of this government, had not seen re­  
ceived. Farther explanations were expected  
from Mr. Barlow, but none were given. The light  
in which this transaction was viewed by this go­  
vernment was noticed by the President in his  
message to Congress, and communicated also to  
Mr. Barlow in a letter of the 14th July, 1812,  
with a view to the requisite explanation from the  
French government. Ou the 9lh day of MaJ»  
1812, the emperor left Paris for the North, and  
  
■u mu iiiureuner me niiae jDitssanoioi­  
lowed him. A negociation lor the adjustment of  
injuries, and the arrangemeHt’lt&#x27; our Commerce,  
with the government of France, long depending,  
and said to have been brought nearly to a conclu­  
sion, at the time of,Mr. Barlow’s death, was  
suspended by that event. His successor, lately  
appointed, is authorised to resume the negocia- j  
lion, and to conclude it. He is instructed to de- j  
maud redress of the Frgpch government for eve- |  
ry injury, and an explanation of its motive for j  
withholding froilf this government a knowledge  
of (he decree for so long a time after its adoption, j  
l.i appears by the documents referred to, that J  
Mr. Barlow lost no timi* after having obtained  
ft knowledge of the existencc.of the Freneh de­  
cree of the 28;li April, 1811, in demanding a co­  
py of it, and transmitting it to Mr. Russell, who  
immediately laid it before the BritiMi govern­  
ment, urging, on the ground of this new proof  
of the repeal of the French decrees, that the  
British orders in council should he repealed.  
Mr. Russell’s note to Lord CastUreagh bears  
date on the 20th of May; Lord Custlereagh’a  
reply on the 23d, in which lie promised to sub­  
mit the decree to the consideration of the Prince  
Regent. It appears, however, that no eucou-j  
ragemeut was given at that time to hope jjiat tike  
orders in council would be repealed iti® conse­  
quence of that decree; and that although it was  
afterwards nskde the ground of their repeat* the  
repeal was nevertheless to he ascribed to other  
causes. Their repeal did not take effect until  
the 23d of June, more than a mouth after tlu|  
French decree had been laid before the British  
  
government; a delay indicating, in itself, at a  
hat  
as  
not produced % the French.decree, other proofs  
might be*adduced. 1 will state one, whiehjn  
addition to the evidence ehntaincd ft the letter*  
from Mr. Russell, herewith communicated,  
marked G, is deemed .conclusive. ft tbs eom­

Wtates^ po notice whatever wats taken of the  
French decree. One of the conditions then con­  
templated was, that tlfti orders in council should  
foe Revived at the end of eight months, unless  
inPeo&#x27;bduct of the French government and the  
risii^ of the communications with the govern­  
ment of the United State#, should be su&lt;3&gt; as in  
tfoaopinion pf the British government to render  
their revival unnecessary&#x27;! a condition which  
jjioves incontestably that the French decree was  
not considered by tj»e British government a suf­  
ficient ground on which to repeal the orders in  
council. It proves also’that On that day the Bri­  
tish government ha&lt;^ resolved ugt to repeal the  
orders..oh&gt; the basis of that decree p since the  
proposed repeat was to depend not «a what the

therefore, that either of those acts, io whatever  
light they might be viewed, should have tjeeri fa*  
ken iuto consideration^ or have had any iutiuil  
euce io deciding on that important event. - ■ • 1­  
\ Had the British government beln disposed t£  
repeal its orders in council, in&#x27;-eoYi fortuity with  
the principle on which it professed id have issu­  
ed them, and on tlm condition which it hud it­  
self prescribed, there&#x27;was no reason to delay the  
repeal until sueh afjfecree as that ofjhe 28th  
April, 1811 should be produced, live decia­  
J^tiun of the French government of August 8,  
1810, had fully sutistied every claim of the Bri­  
tish government according to its own principles  
on that point. Bj it the decrees of Berlin and  
•Milan were declared to be repealed, the repeal  
to take efteet on the 1st November following, on  
which day it did take effect. ‘ The only condi­  
tion attached to it, was, either that Great Bri-i  
tain should follow the example, and repeal her  
orders in council, or that the United States  
should carry into effect against her their non­  
importation act. This conditiot#*was in its na­  
ture subsequent, not precedent, reserving a right  
in France to revive her decrees in case neither  
alternative was performed.. By this declaration  
it was put completely in the power of Great Bri­  
tain to terminate tkit eontrover.sj&#x27; in a manner  
the most honorable tt^litrself. France hodyield­  
ed to her the ground on a condition &lt;vith*Vhich  
.she had declared her williBeuess to cottinlv.—  
  
Had she complied, the non-unpoctatioD act would  
not hive been carried into effect, nor «;auld the  
French decrees have been revived. By refusing  
to comply, she has made herself responsible for  
all that h&amp;s since followed. &#x27;  
By the decree of the 23t|| April, 1811, the  
decrees of Berlin and Milan were said to be de­  
finitively repealed—and the execution of the  
non-importation act against Great Britain was  
declared to be the grnaud of that repeal. The  
repeal announced by the declaration of the dill  
August, l8to, was absolute and finut^ exeept as  
to the condition subsequent attached to it. T hie  
latter decree acknowledger that that condition  
had been-performed, and disclaims the rigty to  
revive it, in consequence of that performance,  
and, extending back to the first of November,  
confirms in&#x27;every circumstance the preceding re­  
peal. The latter act, therefore, as to the re­  
peal, is nothing tnore.lhnn a confirmation of the  
former. It is in this sense that those two acts  
are to be understood in Franee. It is in the same  
sense that they are to be regarded by other pow­  
ers.  
In repealing the orders in council on the pre­  
text of the Freneb decree of Ihb 28th April,  
1811, the British government has conceded that  
it ought to have repealed them on the declara­  
tion of the 3th of August, 1810. It is impossi­  
ble to discriminate between the two act., or to  
separate them from each other, so as to justify,  
on sound and consistent principles-, the repeal of  
the o(de||| iu council on the ground of one act,  
and the refusal to repeal them,on that of the  
other. The second act mokes the repeat defi­  
nitive—but for w hat reason ? Because the nqn­  
impertgtjou net had been putin Wrce agairttt  
Greit Britain, in compliance with the condition  
subsequeBt^iUuched to the funner repeal, and  
her refusal to perfulm it. That att being still  
in force, and the decree of the 28th April, 1811,  
beirtg expressly founded on it, Great Britain re.  
I tea Is her orders in ceuneil on the^atis of this  
alter decree. The&#x27;conclusion is, therefore, irre­  
  
jisiaoie, mat oy ims jepeal, under all the cir­  
cumstances attenijlgW, the British governmeiit  
Jias acknow lodged the justice of the claim of the  
Uajted States to u repeal on the former occasi­  
on. By accepting the latter repeal, it has sanc­  
tioned the preceding one ) it has sanctioned also  
the conducted this government in carrying.into  
effect the mm-importation act against Great Bri­  
tain, founded ou the preceding repeal.  
^ Other important consequences result from this  
&#x27;repeal of the British government, By fair and  
obvious construction the acceptance of jfte de­  
cree of the 3&amp;lW April, 1S11, gytbe ground of  
the repeal of the orders in counting ought to bn  
construed to extend back to the 1st November,  
1810, the day on w hich the preceding repeal  
foot effect. The secretary of state has full eon-&#x27;  
fidence, that if the.question cpuld be Submitted  
to the judgment ofw impartial judicial tribunal,  
such would be its decision. He has equal con­  
fidence tlu^such will be the judgment pronoun­  
ced on it b^t he enlightened and impartial world.  
If, howevpr, these two aets could be separated  
from eachHwher, so as that the latter might be  
made the basis of the repeal of&#x27;the .»op£jefri in  
espieil, distinct from the former, it follows that,  
bearing data on the SStl* April, t*fl, the repeat  
ought to hive relation to that date. Hi legal  
consttuclion, between nations as well al individu­  
als, aets, aw to be respg$|ed from the time they;  
begin lo epm-ate, and, sphere they impose a  
moral or political obUgnftonon another party,  
that obligation eemmehees wJtVlhe coin men ce­  
ment of tltf aet. But it has been urged that the  
Fireneh decree WiA not promulgated or made  
known tethe Britislvacovyiinient^.until A.year  
aftgr its date. This sR$e|fiuii lias ngforli? By

terval nothing W*»&#x27;dom? repugnant urit.&#x27;rlii  
cannot be presumed that uny government would  
aeeept from another, as the basis on g&amp;iel’ .ft was  
to found an important measure, an act of anterior  
and rcRiotedafo, pledging itself W&gt; a certain  
course of conduct which that government had  
in the interval deported fro ih,and violated. If

The deckiraljun of the Prince tlegeut of%|fii?  
21st April, 1812,i* in full confirmation of these  
remarks. By this act of the British government  
it is formally announced, on the authority of is  
report of the secretary of foreign affairs to the  
conservative senate thatt he French  
deereeewVre slillin fiwle,. and #at t^e orders  
in couiifcil should not borepealed. It citnnot fail  
to excite considerable surprise, that the British  
government should immediately afterwards.&#x27;Thftt  
is, on lue 23d of June, repeal its orders in coutt­  
cil, on the ground of the French deeree&#x27;oftBft­  
281,1 April, 1811. By (|us primeediu* the Bri-&#x27;  
Ush government has inTolved itself in manifest  
inconsistency. If has, mnltttamed by one act,  
thuit the French decreed were in fgll force, «ndl  
byomother that they wer^Tepealed during thh  
same space of time. It admits also, th&#x27;ithy up  
act of the Fretieh government orJdt eruiKer#,  
had any violation ofthe repeal emmuinced by  
  
iuv ucuaruuon oi me r rencn government orj|»  
3th August 1810, been conMgttcd, or at least,  
that such violation hail not aKI sufficient weight  
! to prevent the repeal of tlie orders in council,  
it was objected that the declaration of the  
French government of the 3th of&#x27;fjijiisf isitV  
was not such an acit as theBritish; government;  
ought to have regarded! The secretary ofstute  
is thoroughly satisfied that, tilts objection s al­  
together unfounded. It was Communicated by  
the emperor through his highest official organ,  
the secretary of foreign afFairs^&#x27;fiLthe minister  
plenipotentiary of (he United St&#x27;4Sp;..|^rParis. *  
It is impossible to conceive an aofcfiiore for mat,.  
authentic ormbligatory on the French govern­  
ment, than that alluded to. Dees one govern­  
ment ever ask nrjapeet from another 4o oegpre  
the performance of any duty, however import  
tant, more than its official pledge, fairly and  
fully expressed ? Can bettsr security be given  
for its performance ? Had there beef any^iouht^  
on this subject, the eapdact of Great Britain  
herself, in similar cases, Would have completa}*  
removed it. The whole history of&#x27;heT diple^ •

Unwilling, in their eaerliea* to obtain ju*$ce of

They »w the lefs inclined to it in Hid present

rable advance, at least, had been made by the  
other towards &lt;a complete accommodation, it be­  
ing manifest to the world, net only that the  
faith of the;  
for the rep?«  
french government stood pledged  
of its decree*, but that the repeal

up, and jtidM|| decisions stispeaded oil all,  
W its order, n defeat it also coutiuued to give  
the most positive assurances that the repeal  
should be faithfully observed.  
It has also been urged that the French repeal  
CU eunditionij. and for that reason could not  
he accepted. This objection has already been  
fully answered. It merits attention, however,  
thnt thc acts of the British government relating  
V&gt; this subject, particularly the declaration os&#x27;  
tlieSUtnf April, 1812, and the repeal of the  
43d June of tile same year, are equally and in  
like.manner conditional. It is not a little sur*  
  
prising, tn At tlie rcruish government should have  
objected to a measure in another government, to

•«}»• It is proper, however, to remark, &#x27;that  
this objection ha* been completely waved and  
given op by the acceptance of the decree of the  
SSthofApril, I8tl.  
. ThefHtisb government has urged also, that  
fOoulunot ee.iGde in the, faithful performance  
by the French government of any engagement it  
might enter iuto relative to the repeal of its ffe­  
trres. This objection would be equally appli­  
cable to aoy other compact to be entetrd into  
yith France. While maintained it would be a  
bor to kuy treaty, even to a treaty of peuee, be*  
tween them, but it also has been admitted to  
be Unfounded by the acceptance of the deeree of  
theStith April, 1811.. &#x27; •&lt;’ i&quot;

facts ami explanation*, supported as they are  
bjf authentic document,, prove, iirst, that the  
repeal of the Uritish orders in council was not  
to he ascribed to the French deeree bearing date  
on the 28th April tSttj and secondly, that in  
making that decree the basis of their repeal, the  
British government has conceded that it ought  
to have repealed tItem an the ground of the de*  
duration of the French government of the Sth  
&#x27; August’ 1816, to as to take effect on the 1st No*

uie British orders in council was justly Attribut­  
able, cannot row remain a d&lt;rtibt,wjth any, who  
s havit*markcd with a jdft discernment the course

fke goud popple of thise*Miites, to know that  
v they have ifot .submitted to privations in tain.  
i&#x27;ihe discussion of other wrongs, particularly  
.that relating toimpsesiment, had been closed!  
some, time before the period alluded to. It  
V%*s nnworthy of the character of the United  
plates to pursue the diseussiomisn that difference,  
When it was evident that lioidvaniage could be  
&#x27; fleriVtfd from it. The right was reserved, to be  
brought forward and urged again, when it might  
. b* done with effect. In the mean time the prac­

Onfall eomideratton of at! circumstances, it  
appeared that thri petjpd bud arrived, when if  
, became the duty n the United Stales in take  
that altitude Willi Great iinUin, which was  
• due to thMg violated right*, to the security of  
tiidir uieflntnpurtaufinterests, arid to their eba­  
i racier as an iuflrpeoiieut natiuu.io Pave shrunk  
&#x27; from the erieis would have beeu to abandon every  
&quot; thing valuable to a free people, The surrender  
of our feameu to British impressment, with the  
‘ destruction of our navigation and commerce,  
would Sot have been its only evils, c &#x27;the deso­  
iation • of property, how ever great and widely  
spread, alive is an interest Which admits of re&gt;  
pair. The wound is incurable oniy, which til­  
es a stigma on the national honor. Wuiie the  
spirit of the people is unsubdued, there will al­  
ways be found in their virtue a resource equal  
to the greatest dangers and most trying emergen­  
cies. it is in the nature of free got eminent, to  
inspire in the body of the people generous aud  
noble sentiments, and it is the duty of the con­  
stituted authorities to cherish and appeal to those  
sentiments, and rely on the patriotic suppm t of  
their constituents. Had they proved themselves  
unequal to the crisis, the most fatal, consequen­  
ces would have resulted frpm it. i iie pi oof of  
their W eakness would have been recorded ; but  
not on them alone would its baneful effects have  
been visited. It would have shaken the founda­  
tion of the government itself, and even of the sa­  
cred principles of the&gt;re\olution, on which ail  
our political insliutions depend. Yielding to  
the |&gt;re(engioii8 of a foreign power, without ma­  
king a manly&#x27; effort in defence of our right*, with­  
out appealing to the virtue of the people, or to  
the strength of our Union,-it would have been  
charged and believed that in these sources lay  
the hidden defects. Where would the good peo­  
ple of these states have been able to make ano­  
ther stand? Where would have-been their rally­  
tag point ? The government of their choice hav­  
ing been dishonored, its weakness and that of  
their institutions demonstrated, the triumph of  
the enemy would have been complete. It would  
also have been durable! |.  
The- constituted authorities of the United  
9tate§ neither dreaded or anticipated these evils.  
They had flail confidence in the strength of the  
Union, iu the firmness and virtue of the people,  
and were satisfied, when the appeal sho-tild be  
made, that ample proof would be afforded, that  
their confidence had riot been misplaced. Fo­  
rein&#x27;s pressure, it was not doubled, would soon  
dissipate foreign partialities and prejudices, if  
such existed, and unite us more close!i tnirethpi­  
  
a* one people. ? -i  
In declaring war against Great-Britain the  
United Slates have placed themselves in a situa­  
tion to retort the hostility, which they had so  
long suffered from the British government. The  
maintenance of their rights w as the object of the  
war. Of the desire of this government to termi­  
nate the war on honorable conditions, ample  
proof has been afforded by the proposition made  
to the British government immediately after the  
declaration of war, through (he Charge d’Affaires  
of the United Slates at London, and by the promp­  
titude and manner of the acceptance of the me­  
diation of the Eripoi or of Ka^sia.  
It was anticipated by some, that a declaration  
of war against Great-Britain would force the  
United States into a close connection with her  
adversary,.much to their disadvantage. The  
Secretary of State thinks it proper to remark,  
that nothing is more remote from the fact.&#x27; The  
discrimination in favor of France, according to  
law, in consequence of her acceptance of the proJ  
position made equally to both powers, produced  
a difference between them in that special ease,  
bat in that only, &#x27;fha war with England was  
declared, without aij|i*nii$ert or commufnieatioig  
with the French government; it has produced  
no connection between the United States and  
France orjtny understanding as to its prosecution,  
continuance, or. termination. The ostensible re­  
lation between the two countries, is the true and  
only one. The United States have just claims  
on Francoifbr spoliations on their commerce w  
the high seas, and in the ports of F ranee, and  
their lute minister w as, and (heir present minis­

for that reason could not be accepted.  
This objection has already been Jul­

however that the acts of the; British  
government relating to this J subject,  
particulaily the declaration of the 21st  
April 112, and the -repeal of , 23d  
Jurie of thecsaroe year, are equal!)

is not a little surprising, that the Ur 1­

to a measure in another government,  
to which it h 23 itself given a sanction  
by its owg actv It is pr&#x27;opery how.

of the 28th April, 1811.  
The lintiih gdvernraent has urged  
also, that it could not confide in the  
faithful, performance by the French  
government of any &quot;engagement it  
might enter imp relative to the repeal  
of its decreeV; ThN objection would  
be equals-applicable to anyother com­  
pact to be enteretl into with France.  
&quot;While maintained it would be a bar  
to any treaty, even to a treaty of peace  
between them. , I3ut&#x27;KaJo has been

which the Berlin and MiUi decrees  
.were declared ta be jeelcdthe- Bri­  
tish government changed tts.trineand  
continued to, rise; in its demands, to  
the moment that !war was declared.  
It objected first that the French &#x27;repeal  
was conditional, and riot absolute ; al  
though the only condition attached to  
it, was that G. Britain should follow  
the example, or the United States  
fulfil their; pledge by executing the  
nonimportation act against her. It  
was then, demanded that France  
should repral her internal regulations  
as a condition of the repeal ul the liri­  
tish orders in count U Next that thr  
Frenth repeal should be extended to  
all, neutral nations, as well as to the  
Uniter: States, and lastlj &quot;that the ports  
of &#x27;her enemies,&#x27; and ail ports from  
which the British flag wds excluded  
should be opened to British manutac-  
lures in Ameritao vessels ; condi  
Hons so extjavagr.nt as to&#x27;atisly all  
dispassionate minds that they .were  
demanded,1 not in the expectation  
tht thty would or couhs be coaipljtd  
with, but to terminate the discussion.  
On full consideration of ajl circum­  
stances, it appeared that the &#x27;period  
had arrived, when it becamt thc du;y  
of the L7. S to,t.,ke that attitude with  
G. Britain, which was due to their  
violated rights, to the security&#x27; of  
j their most important interests, ;:nd to

highest o8icia! organ, the Secrctaiy Of Foreign  
  
Affairs, to the mmisUr plenipotentiary ot the Unit­  
rd Statis at Paris. It is impossible Uj&#x27;ton .cive an  
  
uct more formal, authentic or obligatory on the  
Frencn government than thai alluded to.&#x27; poes  
one government ever asX or expect from another  
to 3ccure tlie performance of u .y duty, however  
important, more than hs official pledge, tuiriy and  
tully expressed i Can better security be given lor  
its performance ? Had there been any douut on this  
subject, the conduct of Great Britain herself, in si­  
milar case9,Mould have completely removed it  
The whole. History of her dipioraslic intercom sc  
with other powers, on the sui jectof blockade, is in  
accord with this proceeding of the Frencn govern­  
ment. We know that when her government in­  
stitutes a blockade, the Secretary of Foreign Af­  
fairs announce ii. to the mir.istcrs of ot.:er powers  
at London ; ,.ti(l that the same form is onsevved  
when they ure revoked. Nor was the authenticity  
ot either ac.&#x27;, ihus anni unced,ver questioned.&#x27;  
Had a similar declaration been made by the mi­  
nister of France in the United States to this go  
  
vernment, by the order of his own, would it not  
hftve been entitled to respect, and been respected i  
  
11&#x27;.&#x27; tiie usage of nations, such respect coulu not have  
  
t ,c n withheld. The arrangement made wjth Air  
Iv.flvina is a full proof of the good faith of this go  
  
vernment, and of its impartiality, in its transitions  
  
with both tlie belliirereiUs. It was made with that  
  
minister on the ground of his public character, and  
the confidence duo to it ; on which basis the non­

vernment ot the 5 th August, 1810. so as to  
  
take effect oft the 1st November knowing.  
To what cause, the repeal of the British orders  
  
hi council wasju uy attributable, cannot now  
remain a doubt, with any, who have marktd  
with a just discernment the course of events,. It  
must atTe-rd gi eat consolation to the good peo­  
ple of Vneso starcs, to know that they have not  
submitted to privatiems in vain.  
Th? discussion of other wrongi, particular­  
ly that relating to impressment, had been clvs­  
ed some time before the period alluded to.  
It was unworthy of the character cf the Unit  
  
ed States to pursue the discussion on that dif  
  
ference, wuen it was evident that no advan­  
tage could be derived from it. I he rig!&#x27;.;  
was resvi ve r.l, to b brought f rw.ird and urg  
  
ed again .&#x27;.when it might be done wi.h elitct.  
  
tn the. hvtan time the practice of impressment  
  
)vas persevered in with vigor.  
At the time when narw.ii ieclnred against  
G.&#x27;.Britain, no satisfactory at ra;.geme.t vas  
  
offered, r likely to br. obtained, respecting  
impresSrrient, and noting wai more rem t.  
from ths expectation of this governm.:ut, -han  
the repsal i.f th-: .orders i?iiouoil. Every  
circumstance which had occurred tending to  
illustrate the policy and views of the British  
  
government rendered such an event altoii,t  
improbable. From the comrruncenKut of  
that system cf hostility, nich Great Britain  
iiad adopted aga-i&#x27;sLtte United States, her  
pretensions h-ti gradually increase.i, or at  
j least bcoe more fully unioldtd, accprding  
  
.&#x27;circumstances, until at the motunt v.h.-i:

which dispelled all prospect of accommoda

of May, A&amp;jo was issued, no measure, cf  
  
France hail occurred on which it could be re-  
  
(Uitory, and at the date of the next order  
January, 18C7, it was hardly possible that this  
  
government should p,ave even heard of the de­  
cree of Berlin to which it related. It was  
  
stated at the time of beir adoption, and fur  
some time afterwards, that they shouid be .re  
  
voked as soon as rr.mce&#x27; revoked her decrees,  
and that the British government&#x27; would pro

Washington, July 12, 1813.  
The secret nr p nf state, to whom iras rr­  
j&#x27;err l several resolutions of the ho us,  
of representatives of the 2ist ult. re  
ijUtUiftg infufmhrhn on certain  
p ints relating to the. French decrees  
of the 28th of April l«i1, has the­  
honour to make to the Vresident tiu  
following Repobt :  
In furnishing the information requir­  
ed by tfir, house of representatives, the  
secretary of state presumes, that i;  
might lie deemed S&#x27;llTieient for him to  
stale what i.&lt; now demanded, what part  
thereof has been heretofore communi­  
cated, and to supply the deficiency.  
Ile.eonsiders it however more conform*  
able t&lt;» the views of the house, to meet  
at this time, without regarding what  
has been already communicated, every  
inquiry, and to give a distinct answer  
to each, with the proper explanation  
relating to it.  
The house of representatives has re.  
quested information by whom, and in  
what manner, the first intelligence was  
given to this government of the decree  
of the government of France, hearing  
date on the 29th of April, 1811, and  
purporting to be a definitive repeal of  
the decrees of llerlin and Milan : whe­  
ther Mr. Russell, late charge d*ai’­  
fain s of the United States to the i?o­  
  
vcrnment of r ranee, ever admitted or  
denied to his government the correct­  
ness of the declaration of (lie duke of  
Bassano to Mr. Barlow, as stated in  
Mr. Barlow’s letter of the 12th of May  
4sl 2, to the secretary of slate, that the  
.laid decree had been communicated tu  
his, Mr. Barlow’s, predecessor there,  
ami to lay before the house any «’orrrts«  
pondeuce with Mr. iiussel! on the sub­  
ject, which it may not he improper to  
communicate, and also any correspon­  
dence&#x27;ret ween Mr. Barlow and Mr  
Kussell in possession of the depart  
nr-tit of state ; whether the minister ol  
France to the United States ever in.  
firmed this government of the exist  
tree of the said decree, and to lay be­  
fore the house any correspondence w ill  
the said minister relative thereto not  
improper to he communicated; with  
any other information in the possessor  
of the executive, which he may not  
deem injurious to the pnldiqk interest  
to disclose, relative to the said decree  
tending to show at what lime, by whom  
and in what manner, it was first mailt  
known to this government, or tc  
any of its representatives or agents an*  
lastly, to inform the house, whethei  
the government of the U. States hall  
ever received from that of France anj  
explanation of the reasons of that de  
cree being concealed from this govern.  
Bient nnd its minister, for so long f  
time after its date, and if such cxpla  
nation has been asked by this govern  
ment, and has been omitted In lie givei  
by that of France, whether thi* go  
vcrnment hasina&lt;*&gt;». any re^ionMranci  
  
or expressed any dissatisfaction to  
I lie government of France against such  
concealment.  
These enquiries embrace two dis­  
tinct objects. The first relutes to the  
conduct of the government of France,  
in regard lo this decree. The .second,  
to that of t’ne government of the U.  
•States. In satisfying the call of the  
house, on this latter point, it seems to  
be proper to meet it in a two-fold  
view ; first, as it relates to the conduct  
of this government in this transaction ;  
secondly, as it relates to its conduct to­  
wards both belligerents in some impor­  
tant circumstances connected with it.  
I&#x27;lie resolutions do not call specially  
for a report of such extent, hut us the  
measures of the executive, and nets of  
congress, founded on communications  
fr»*»« the Exccuttie, which relate to  
one of the belligerents, have by neces­  
sary consequence an immediate relation  
to the other, such a report seems to he  
obviously comprised within theirscope.  
On this principle the report is prepar­  
ed in the expectation, that the more  
jfuil the information given, on every  
thrauciiof the subject, the more satisfac­  
tory will it he to the house.  
The Secretary of State has the hon­  
our to report, in reply to these enqui­  
ries, that the first intelligence which  
this government received of the  
  
I rimcti decrees o! the 2Si!i of April,  
tail, was communicated by Mr. Bar­  
low, in a letter bearing date on the  
12lh May. 1S12, which was received  
by this department na the 13th Julv  
following : thut the first intimation to  
Mr. Barlow of the existence of that  
decree, as appears by his communica­  
tions, was given by the duke of Bussa­  
uo in an informal conference on some  
Jay between the Island 10th of May,  
1312, and that the official communica­  
tion of it to Mr. Iiarlow was made on  
the loth of that mouth at his request :  
that Mr. Barlow transmitted a copy of  
that decree, ;tnd of the duke of Bassa­  
no &#x27; letter, announcing it to Mr. lius­  
*c&#x27;l,iti a letter of May 11th, in which  
itC&#x27;dlso informed Mr Russell that the  
jlukc of Bassano Imd stated that the  
decree had been duly communicated to  
(him : that Mr. Russell replied in a let­  
|*er to Mr. Barlow of the 29th May.  
{that his Urst knowledge of the decree  
(u .s derived from his letter, and that  
ji*c has repeatedly stated the same since  
to this government. The paper mark  
jed A is a copy of an extract of Air  
(Barlow’s letter to the department oi  
Utate, of May 12, I8t3; IV, of th­  
; Duke of Bassano&#x27;s letter to Mr. Bar

the VJth May, and E, of Mr. Russell’s  
l &#x27;tter to the department of state of tin  
: .SOtil.  
j The secretary of state reports alsn  
(that no communication of the decree ol  
jibe 23tii April, ISM, was ever made t-i  
this government hy the minister ol  
France, or other person, than as is a­  
bove stated, and that no explanation o$  
| the cause of its not having been eoni­  
|innnieated to fliis government and pub­  
lished at the time, of its date, was ever  
fina le to this government, or so far as  
fit is informed, to the representatives or  
I the agents of the U. States in Europe.  
jThe minister of France has been asked  
to explain the cause of a proceeding ap­  
parently so extraordinary and exerp  
tioimble, who replied, that his first in­  
telligence of that decree was received  
  
;t&gt;y tli» v» asp, in a letter trom lue dukel  
of Hnssauo of May, 10. 1S12. in which1  
lie expressed his surprize excited bv:  
Mr. Harlow&#x27;s communication, that a  
prior letter of May. tStl.in which he;  
had transmitted a copy of the decreei  
for the information of this government,  
&#x27;had not been received. Further ex­  
planations, were expected from Mr.  
Barlow, but none were given. The  
&#x27;•ght in which this transaction was  
viewed by this government was noticed  
by the President in bis message to Con­  
gress, and communicated also to Mr.  
&#x27; Barlow in a letter of the I MIt July,  
1ISI2, with a view to the requisite ex­  
planation from the French govern­  
ment. On the 9th day of May, !S12.  
the Fmperour left Paris for the Vorth,  
and in two days thereafter the Duke of  
Hnssauo followed him. A nogociation  
for the adjustment of injuries, and the  
&#x27;arrangement of our commerce, with the  
.&#x27;government of France, long depending,  
jand said to have been brought nearly  
,to a conclusion, at the time of Mr.  
Barlow’s death, was suspended by that  
.event. Hi* .uceessoiir, lately appoint­  
ed, is authorized to resume the nego­  
ciation, and to conclude it. He is in­  
1 stmeted to demand redress of the  
’Trench government for every injury,  
■ land an explanation of its motive for  
..withholding from this government a  
. knowledge of the decree for so long a  
■ time after its adoption.  
It appears hv the documents refer­  
I’red to that Mr. Barlow lost no time, af­  
■ ter having obtained a knowledge of the  
^existence of the French decree of the  
  
,28th April, 1811, in demanding a copy  
(of it, and transmitting it to Mr. Kus­  
jsell, who immediately laid it before the  
&#x27;British government, urging, on the  
ground of this new proof of the repeal  
of the French decrees, that the British  
orders in council should he repealed.  
Mr. Russell&#x27;s note to Lord Castlereagh  
ihoars date on the 20th of May ; Lord  
Castle*-eagh&#x27;s reply on the 23(1, iu  
which he promised to submit the de­  
cree to the consideration of the  
(Prince Regent, It appears, however,  
that no encouragement was given at  
that time to hope that the orders in  
council would be repealed in conse­  
quence of that decree j and that al­  
though it was afterwards made the  
ground oftheir repeal, the repeal was  
nevertheless to he a s&lt; ibe«l to other  
Icnuscs. Their rdprr did not take  
effect until the 23(1 of June, more than  
ja mouth after the French decree had  
jbeen laid before the British govern­  
jinent ; a delay indicating, in itself, at  
{a period so momentous and critical,  
not merely neglect but disregard of the  
French decree.-That the repeal ol  
&#x27;the British orders in council was not  
{produced by the French dec.reo, other  
proofs might he adduced. I will state  
one, whi.di in addition to the evidence  
obtained iu the letters from Mr. Rus­  
sell, herewith communicated marked  
If, is deemed conclusive. Iu the coin­  
j nuuicat ion of Mr. Baker to Mr. lira­  
ham, mi the 9th August 1813, whicl  
  
was iouiuk&#x27;ri on instructions trnm his  
government, of as late date as the IV th  
June, in which he staled, that an dlii­  
cial declaration would he sent to this  
country, proposing a conditional repeat  
of the orders in council, so far as they  
adected the U. S. no notice whatever  
was taken of the French decree. One  
of the conditions then contemplated  
was, that the orders in council should  
lie revived at the end of S months, un­  
less the conduct of the French govern­  
ment and the result of the communica­  
tions with the government of the U. S.  
should be such as in the opinion of the  
British government to render their re­  
vival unnecessary ; a eouJitiou which  
proves incontestably that the French  
decree was not considered hy the Bri­  
&#x27;ish government a sufficient ground on  
which to repeal the orders in council.  
It proves also that on that day the  
British government had resolved not  
|u» -r-opeal ilia o.dcr.ti as** ^filial  
decree ; since the proposed repeal was  
&gt;o depend not on wliat the French go­  
vernment had already done, but on  
what it might do, and on arrangements  
to be entered into with the. U. •*&gt;. un­  
connected with the French repeal.  
The French decree of the 38ih A­  
pril, lStl, whs transmitted to the U.  
States hy the Wasp, a publick vessel,  
which had been long awaiting, at the  
•ports ofttreat Britain and France, dis­  
patches from our ministers relating to  
1 these very important concerns with  
loth governments. It was received at  
. tiie Department of State on the Uili  
July, 181 3, nearly a month after the  
. leclaration of war against G. Britain.  
Intelligence of the repeal of the orders  
in council was not received until about  
the middle ol* the following month. It  
was impossible, therefore, that cither  
of those acts, in whatever light they  
night ha viewed, should have been  
taken into consideration, or have had  
any influence in deciding on that im­  
portant event.  
  
Had the British government been  
dispose&#x27;! to repeal its orders in council,  
in conformity with the principle on  
which it professed to have issued them.;  
and on the condition which it had itself  
prescribed, there was no reason to de-j  
lay the repeat until such a decree as|  
that of the jsth April, IS It, should he I  
produced. The declaration of tlicl  
French government of August 5, 1810,j  
had fully satisfied every claim of the!  
|British government according to its!  
.own principles on that point. By it  
,the decree* of Berlin and Milan  
.were declared *o be repealed, the re­  
peal to take effect on the 1st November  
[following, cmi which day it did take  
[effect. The only condition attached to  
;it, was either that Great Britain  
&#x27;should follow the example, and repeal  
her orders in council, or that the Uni­  
ted States should carry into effect a­  
[gainst her their non-importation act.  
1 This condition was in its nature sub­  
isequont, not precedent, reserving a  
right in France to revive her decrees  
in case neither alternative was per­  
formed. By this declaration it wax  
put completely in the power of Great  
Britain to terminate this controversy  
in a manner the. most honourable to  
herself. Franee had yielded to her  
the ground on a condition with which  
she had declared her willingness to  
comply. Had she complied, the non­  
importation act would not have been  
carried into effect, nor could thr  
] French decrees have been revived. By  
! refusing to comply, she had made her­  
self responsible for all that has since  
&gt; followed.  
| By the 4eerco of the 23th April,  
  
1811,the decrees of Berlin and Milan  
! were said to be definitively repealed,  
and the execution of the non-importa­  
tion act against G. Britain was declar­  
ed to be the ground of that repeal.  
The repeal announced by the declara­  
tion of the 5th August, istO, was ab­  
solute and final, except as to the condi­  
tion subsequent attached to it. This  
latter decree acknowledges that Ihat  
condition had been performed, and dis­  
claims tlie right to revive it, in con­  
sequence of that performance, and,  
extending hack to the 1st of Nov. con­  
firms in every circumstance the preced­  
ing repeal. The latter act, therefore,  
as to the. repeal, is nothiug more than  
a confirmation of the former.—-It is in  
.this sense that those two uets are to he  
&#x27;understood in France. It is in the  
same scare that they are to he regard­  
ed by other powers.  
In repealing tiie orders in council on  
the pretext of the French decree of the  
28th April, 1811, the British govern­  
jment lias conceded that it ought to  
.have repealed them on the declaration  
jof the 3th of August, 1810, It is iin­  
jpossihle to discriminate between the  
&#x27;two acts, or to separate them from  
leach other, so as to justify, on sound  
and consistent principles, the repeal of  
the orders in council on the ground of  
one act, and the refusal to repeal them  
jon that of the other. The second act  
I makes the repeal definitive ; but for  
I what reason ? Because th*nou-impor­  
Itation act hud beeu put in force against  
  
&#x27;Great Britain, in compliance with the  
&#x27;condition subsequent attached to the  
(former repeal, and her refusal to per­  
form it. That act being still in force,  
land the deercc of the 3Sth April, 1811.  
dieing expressly founded on it. G. Bri.  
tain repeals her orders in council on  
the basis of this latter decree. The  
conclusion is, therefore, irresistable,  
that by this repeal, under all the cir­  
cumstances attending it, the British go­  
vernment has acknowledged the justice  
of the.claim of the U. States to a re­  
peal on the former occasion. By ac­  
cepting the latter repeal, it has sanc­  
tioned the preceding one ; it has sanc­  
tioned also the conduct of this govern­  
ment in carrying into effect the non­  
importation act again! G. Britain,  
founded on the preceding repeal.  
Glher important consequences result!  
from repeal of the Rri&#x27;iife jpjveru-j  
ment. By fair and obvious construc­  
tion the acceptance of the decree of the  
2Sth April, 1811, as the ground of the  
1 repeal of the orders in council, ought  
1 to be construed to extend back, to the  
1st .November l Sin* the day on which  
the preceding repeal took effect. The  
^Secretary of State has full confidence,  
that if the question could be submitted  
to the judgment of an impartial judicial  
tribunal, such would he its decision  
He lias equal confidence that such will  
be the judgment pronounced on it by  
th • enlightened and impartial world.  
If, however, these two acts could be  
separated from each other, so as that  
tile latter might be made the basis of  
the repeal of the orders in council, dis­  
tinct from the former, it follows that,  
bearing date on the 38th April, 18 11,  
&#x27;the repeal ought to have relation to  
that date. In legal construction, be­  
itween nations as well as individuals,  
(acts, are to be respected from the time  
&#x27;they begin to operate, and. where they  
impose a moral or political obligation!  
on another party, that obligation com-i  
;mpiiees with the commencement of the|  
  
-tel. nut it lias been urged that the,  
French decree was not promulgated,  
nr made known to the British govern­  
ment, until a year after its date This  
objection lias^io force. By acceptin&#x27;  
an act bearing dale a year before it  
was promulgated, it is admitted that in;  
the interval nothing was done repug-!  
mint to it. It cannot he presumed ilia!&#x27;  
any government would accept fromauo*  
(her. as the basis on which it was to|  
found an important measure, an act of  
anterionr and remote date, pledging it-^  
self to a certain course of conduct;  
which that government had in the in­  
terval departed from and violated. If  
any government had violated an act the  
injunctions of which it wu„ bound to  
[observe by an anterionr one, in relation  
jto a third party, and which it profes­  
sed to have observed, before its accep­  
tance by the other, it could not be pre­  
sumed that it would cease to violate it  
after the acceptance. The conclusion  
i« irresistible, that if the other govern­  
ment did accept such act with a know­  
ledge of its antecedent violation, as the  
foundation of any measure on its own  
part, that such act must have heen the  
ostensible only, and not the real motive  
of such measure.  
The declaration of the prince regent  
of the 2tst April 1S11, is in fall con  
firmation of these remarks. By this  
set of the British government it is for­  
mally announced, on the authority of a  
report, of the secretary of foreign af­  
fairs to the conservative senate o!  
France, that the French decrees weri  
(still in force, and that the orders i»  
/council should not bo rrpc&amp;U4&lt; l  
  
cannot fail to excite considerable sur­  
prize that the British government  
should immediately afterwards, that is,  
on the 2.id June, repeal its orders in  
council, on the ground of the French  
decree ofthe 2*th April tail, Bv  
this proceeding the British government  
has involved itself in manifest incon­  
sistency. It has maintained by one  
act. that the French decrees were in  
full force, and by another that they  
were repealed during the same space  
of time. It admits also, that by no  
act of the French government or it*  
cruizer.s, and any violation of. the re­  
peal announced by the declaration of  
the French government ofthe oth Au­  
gust 1810, been committed, or at least,  
that such v iolation had not had suffi­  
cient weight to prevent the repeal of  
tilt; orders in council.  
It was objected that the declaration  
ofthe French government ofthe 5th  
of August 1810, was not such an act as  
the British government might to have  
regarded. The secretary of stale is  
thoroughly satisfied that this objection  
is altogether unfounded. It was com­  
municated by the emperor through his  
highest official orsan, the secretary of&#x27;  
foreign affairs to the minister plenipo­  
tentiary ofthe United States at Paris,  
&#x27;[ It is impossible to conceive an act more  
formal, uullieutbiek or obligatory on  
the French government than that allu­  
ded to. Does the government ever ask  
or expect from another to secure ihe  
performance of any duty, however im­  
portant more than its official pledge,  
fairly and fully expressed ? Can bet­  
ter security be given for its perfor­  
mance ? Had there beeu anv doubt no  
  
i Lis subject, the conduct of Great Bri­  
tain horself, in similar cases, would  
hiva completely removed it. The  
whole history of her diploinatick inter­  
course with other powers, or the sub­  
ject of blockade, is in accord with this  
proceeding of the French government*  
\Ve know that whenever government  
institutes a blockade, the secretary of  
foreign affairs announces it to the mi­  
nisters of other powers at L &gt;ndo&gt;i ;  
and that the same form is observed  
when they are revoked. Nor was the  
authenticity of either act, thus announ­  
ced ever questioned.  
Had a s imilar declaration been made  
by the minister of France in the United  
‘Stages to this *^»v-rrt&#x27;i«!«t, t&gt;v or­  
der of bis own, would it not have ueen  
entitled to respect, and been respected P  
By the usage of nations such respect  
could not have been with held. The  
arrangement made with Mr. Krskina  
is a full proof of the good faith of this­  
government, and of its impartiality, in  
its transactions with both the bellige­  
rents. It was made with that minis­  
ter on the ground of his (niblick cha­  
ncier, and the confidence due to it : on  
which basis the non-intercourse wui  
removed as to Fnglaud and left in full  
force against France, The failure of  
that arrangement was imputable to tha  
British government alone, who, in re­  
jecting it. took on itself a high respon­  
sibility, not simply, in regard to the  
consequences attending it, but in disa­  
vowing and annulling the act of its mi­  
nister. without shew ing that he had ex­  
ceeded his authority. In accepting the  
declaration of the French minister of  
foreign affairs in proof of the French  
repeal, the United States gave no proof  
of improper credence to the govern­  
jinent of France. On a comparison of  
jooth transactions, it will appear that  
if a marked confidence and respect was  
  
shown to either government, it was lo  
that of O. Britain. In accepting the  
declaration of the government of France  
in the presence of the emperour, the  
L&#x27;. States stood on more secure ground,  
than, in accepting that of a British mi­  
nister in this country.  
To the demand made by the United  
States of the repeal of the British or­  
ders in council founded on the basis of  
the French repeal, of August J. 1910,  
the British government replied, bv de­  
manding a copy of the orders issued bv  
the French government for carrying  
into effect that repeal ; a demand with­  
out example in the intercourse between  
nations. By this demand it ceased to  
he a question whether the French re­  
peal was of sufficient extent, nr was  
founded on justifiable conditions. The  
pledge of the French government was.  
doubted ; a scrutiny was to be institut­  
ed as to the manner in which it was to  
he discharged, and its faith preserved,  
not by the subsequent conduct of its  
cruizors towards the vessels of the  
•States, hut by a copy of the orders giv­  
en to it* erui/.ers. Where would tliio  
end? If the French govcmiucut in­  
tended a fraud, by its declaration of  
repeal, announced to the minister of iho  
U. States, and afterwards In this go­  
vernment, might it not likewise com­  
mit a fraud in any other communica­  
tion which it might make ? If credit  
w as refused by the British government  
to the act of the French government,  
thus formally announced,!* it proba*  
ble that it would have been given by it  
to any document of infgrunr Jutaoiar,

directed to its own people. Although it (  
was the policy and might he the inte­  
rest of the. British government to en­  
gage the U. States in such a controver­  
sy with the French government, it was  
far from comporting with their inte­  
rests to do it. They considered it their  
duty to accept the repeal already made  
bv the French government, of its de­  
crees. and to look, to its conduct and to  
that of its cruiz«‘rs. sanctioned by the  
government, for the faithful perfor­  
mance or \ iol.iti &gt;o of it. I he U. S.  
having b*&#x27;cn injured l*y both powers,  
were unwilling, in their exertions to  
obtain justice of cither, to become the  
instrument of the other. They were  
the less inclined to it in the present in­  
stance, from the consideration, that the  
party making the pressure oil them  
maintained in full three its unlawful  
edicts against the American commerce,  
while it. could not deny that a conside­  
rable advance, at least, had been made  
by the other towards a complete accom­  
modation, it being manifest to the  
world, not only that the faith of tlit  
French government stood pledged for  
the repdal of its decrees, hut that tlie  
repeal did take effect on the 1st ol  
Nov. 1810. in regard to the U. Slates  
that several American vessels takci  
under them had been delivered up. uni  
Judicial decisions suspended on a I. by  
its order, and that it also continued ti  
give the most positive assurances that  
the repeal should be faithfully observ­  
ed.  
  
It lias also been urged that the  
French repeal was conditional, and  
for that reason could not he accepted.  
This objection has been fully ansxvar­  
ed. It merits attention, however, that  
the acts of live British government re­  
lating to this subject, particularly the  
declaration of the 31st of April 1812  
and the repeal of tin* 2^d Jifne of the  
same year, are equally and iti like  
manner conditional. It is not a little  
surprising that the British government  
should have objected to a measure in  
another government to which it has it­  
self given a sanction by its own acts.  
It is proper however, to remark, that  
this objection lias been completely  
waved and given up by the acceptance  
of the decree of the 38th April 1811.  
The British govern meat have urg­  
ed also, that it could not confide in  
the faithful performance by t lie  
French government of any engage­  
ment it might enter into relative to the  
repeal of its decrees. This objection  
would be equally applicable to any o­  
ther compact to be entered into with  
France. While maintained it would  
he a bar to any treaty, even to a treaty  
of peace, between them. But it also  
has been admitted to be unfounded by  
the acceptance of the decree of the 28th  
April 1811.  
The Secretary of state presumes that  
these facts and explanations supported  
as they are by authentic!: documents  
prove, first, that the repeal of the Bri­  
tish orders in council was not to he as­  
cribed to the French decree bearing  
date on the ISth April 18Lt; and se­  
condly, that in making that decree the  
basis of their repeal, the British go­  
- vernment lias conceded that it ought to  
have repealed them on the ground of  
the declaration of the French govern­  
ment of 5th of August 181-1, so as to  
take effect on the 1st November fol­  
lowing. To what cause the repeal of  
the British orders in council was justly  
attributable, cannot now remain a  
doubt with any who have marked with  
a just discernment (he. course of events.  
It must afford great consolation to the  
good people of these states, to know  
that they have not submitted to priva­  
tions in vain.  
The discussion of other wrongs, par­  
ticularly that relating to impressment,  
had been closed some time before the  
period alluded to. It. was unworthy of  
the character of the United States to  
pursue the discussion on that differ­  
ence, when it was evident that no ad  
vantage could be derived from it. The  
right was reserved, to he brought for­  
ward and urged again, when it might  
b&#x27;done with effect. In the mean time  
the practice of impressment was per­  
severed in with vigor.  
  
At. the time when war was declared  
against G Britain, no satisfactory ar­  
rangement was offered, or likely to he  
oh ain&quot;.I respecting impressment, it no­  
thing was more remote from (he ex­  
pectation of this government, than the  
repeal of the orders in council. Eve­  
ry cireum-wanee, which had occurred  
tending to illustrate the policy and  
views of the British government ren­  
dered such an event altogether impro­  
bable. From the commencement of  
that system of hostility, w hich G. Bri­  
tain had adopted against the (J. States,  
her oretensioos had &#x27;radii;.Ilv iucreas­  
  
ed. or at least become more fully no  
foldej according to circumstance*?, un­  
til, the moment when war was de­  
clared thev h id assumed a character  
which dispelled all prospect of accom­  
modation. The orders in council were  
said to have been adopted on a princi­  
ple of.reta nation on France, nltho&#x27; at  
the ti ne when (he order of May iSOO  
w is issued, oo measure of France had  
oecure I on whi-.h it e »uM be retaliato­  
ry, and at l!i; date of the next order  
January, 1«?&gt;7, it *v is hardly possible  
tii it this ijuvernmcut should have  
ov&#x27;»n heard of the decree of Berlin to  
w • — ii if related, ft was stated at the  
ti.ae of their adoption, and fur some  
  
lime p flerwartla, that they should be  
revoked as soon as France revoked he.  
lecrees, and that the British govern  
meot would proceed with the govern  
meat of France pari passu in the revo  
cation. \ft**r the declaration, howe­  
ver, of the French government of tin  
3th August into, by which the Beilin  
and Milan decrees were declared tube  
repealed, the British govermneu  
jchang.&#x27;d its tone, and continued to rise  
in its demands,to the moment that war  
was declared. It objected tirsl that  
’.lie French repeal was conditional, and  
not absolute ; although the only condi­  
tion attached to it, was, that (.*. Bri­  
tain should follow the example, or the  
United States fulfil their pledge by ex­  
jecuting the non-importation act against  
liter, it was then demanded that  
| Franee should repeal her internal regu­  
lation*. a* a condition of the repeal ol  
(the British orders in council. Next,  
that the French repeal should he ex  
&#x27;tended to all neutral nations, as well a­  
to the United States, and lastly, that  
&#x27;the ports of her enemies, and all ports  
from which the British was Hag exclu­  
ded, should be opened to British maim­  
* fact ures in American vessels, conditions  
: so extravagant as to satisfy all dis­  
i passionate minds that they were dema:i­  
ded.not in the expectation that they  
would or could be complied with, but  
to terminate the discussion.  
  
On full consideration of all oireii&#x27;.n­  
•tances. it appeared that the period  
m 1 arrived, when it became the duty!  
&gt;f • he IT. States to take that attitude]  
aiihG. Britain, which was due to  
heir violated rights, to the security’ of  
heir most important iaterests, and to.  
heir character as an independent ua-j  
i(.&gt; . r,» have shrunk from the crisis  
.vol have been to abandon every&#x27;  
ihing alcalde to a free people. The  
tuvrer or of our seamen to British im­  
lrcssm lit, with the destruction of ourl  
iavig.itt mi and commerce, would not]  
tave been its only evils. The dcsoia­  
don of property, however great and  
widely spread, affects an interest.&#x27;  
.vliich u &#x27;mits of repair. The wound  
is incurable only, which fixes a stigma,  
jii the national honour. While the!  
spirit of the people is unsubdued, there  
will tilw.-r s be found in their virtue a  
rcsoui -c equal to the greatest dangers  
mid most ’rviug emergencies, it is in!  
the nat or. f free government, tain­  
spire in t! « body ofthe people gene­  
rous and *■ e. sentiments, ami it is the!  
Juty «f»’ ustituted authorities to  
cherish eal to those sentiments,!  
a ml rely patrintick support ofj  
tlieir eon-. .’s. Had they provedj  
themselves 1 «pial to the crisis, the|  
most fatal consequences would have re-]  
suited from it. The proof of their]  
weakness would have been recorded,  
yet not on them alone would its bane­  
ful effects hive been visited. It would  
have shaken the foundation ofth go­  
vernment itself, ar- ven of the sacred  
principles ofthe r Itiiion, on which  
a!! our political ulions depend.  
Yielding to the p .ons of a foreign  
power, without i . a manly effort  
in defence of our , without ap­  
pealing to the virtu:- the people, or  
to the strength of-»u,*l niou.it would  
have been char, d and believed that in  
these sources &gt;» the. hidden defects.]  
Where would .he good people of these  
states have been able to make another  
stand ? Where would have been their  
rallying point ? The government ofj  
their eh •»-c having been dishonored,  
its weakness and that of their institu­  
tions demonstrated, the triumph of the  
enemy would have been complete. It  
would also have durable.  
The constituted authorities of the T*.  
States neither dreaded or anticipated  
these evils. They bad full confidence  
mi the strength ofthe union, in the  
firmness and virtue of the people, and  
were satisfied when the appeal should  
oe made, that ample proof would hr* af­  
forded, that their confidence had not  
been misplaced. Foreign pressure, it  
&gt;vas not doubted, would soon dissipate  
foreign partialities and prejudices, if  
uch existed, and unite us more close Iv  
together as one people.  
  
iii declaring war against arreat Uri­  
tain tli&lt;* United States have placed  
themselves iti a situation to retort the  
hostility, which (hey had so long siil­  
r*wed from (lie British government.  
The maintenance of their rights was  
the object of the war. Of the desire

nothing it more remote from the f oe*.  
The discrimination in fa van r of Franc-.!  
according? to law, in consequence of her  
acceptance of (lie proposition mad&#x27;*  
equally to both powers, produced a

Kurland was declare&#x27;! without an&#x27; &#x27;

French government; it h is produced  
no couuexion between the. U. Htates*  
  
ft ml France, or any understanding as  
to its prosecution, continuance, or ter­  
mination. The ostensible relation be­

only one. The United blntes ha\*

As respects the British, it appears that  
Mr. Russel in a note of the 20th May 1812 laid  
a copy of the French decree before the Bri-  
tish government, that no encouragement was  
at that time given that the orders in council

considers it however more conformable  
to views of the House, to mect at this  
time, without regarding what has becn  
already communicated, every imquiry,  
and to givea distinct answer to ecaca,  
with the proper explanation relating to  
  
The House of Representatives has re-  
quested information, when, by whom  
and in what manner, the first intelligence  
was given to this government of the de-  
cret bearing date on the 28th April 1811  
and purporting to be a definitive repeal  
of the decrees of Berlin and Milan ;  
whether Mr. Russell, late Charge d’-  
Affairs of the United States to the go-  
vernment of France, ever admitted or  
denied to his government the correct-  
ness ofthe declaration of the Duke of  
Bassano, to Mr. Barlow, as stated in  
Mr. Barlow’s letter of the 12th of May  
1812, to the Secretary of State, that the  
said decree had been communicated to  
his, Mr, Barlow’s predecessor there,  
and to lay before the House any. corres-  
pondence with Mr. Russell on that sub-  
ject, which it may not be improper to  
communicate, and also, any correspon-  
dence between Mr. Barlow and Mr.  
Russell in possession of the Department  
of State ; whether the minister of France  
to the United States ever informed this  
government of the existence of the said  
decree, and to lay before the House any  
correspondence with the said minister  
relative theféto not improper to be com  
municated ; with any other information  
in the possession ofthe Executive, which  
he may not deem it injurious tothe public  
interest to disclose, relative to the said  
decree, tending to show at what fsime, by  
whom and in what manner, it was first  
made known to this government or to  
any of its representatives or agents ; and  
lastly, to inform the House whether the  
government of the United States hath  
ever reccived from that of France any  
explanation of the reasons of that decree  
bemg concealed from this government,  
and its minister, for so longatime after  
ite date, and it such explanation has been  
asked by this government, and has been  
omitted to be given by that of France,  
whether this government had made any  
remonstrance or expressed any disatis-  
faction to the government of France at  
such concealment.  
  
These inquiries embrace two distinct  
objects. The first relates to the conduct  
  
Ldeeree, as appears by his communica  
  
  
  
[ 383 ]  
  
eonduct towards both belligerents in  
sume important circumstances connected  
with it. ‘The resolutions do not call spe-  
cially for a report of such extent, bot as  
the measures of the Executive, and the  
acts of Congress, founded on communi-  
cations trom the Executive, which re-  
late to one of the beiligerents, have by  
necessary consequence an immediate re-  
lation to the other ; such a report seems  
to be obviously comprised within their  
scope. On this principle the report is  
prepared, in the expectation, that the  
more tuli the information given, on every  
branch of the subject, the more satisfac-  
tory it will be to the House.  
  
Mhe Secretary of State has the ho  
vor to report in reply to these inquiries,  
that the first intelligence which this go-  
vernment received of the French decree  
of tie 28th April, 1811, was communi-  
cated by Mr. Barlow, ina letter bearing  
date on the 12th May, 1812, which was  
received by this department on the 13th  
July following: that the first intimation  
to Mr. Barlow, of the existence of that  
  
tions, was given by the Duke of Bassa-  
no,in an iwformal conference on some  
day between the Ist and 10th: of May,  
1812, and that the official communica-  
tion of it to Mr. Barlow, was made on  
the 10th of that month, at his request :  
that Mr. Barlow transmitted a copy of  
that decree, and of the Duke of Bassa  
no’s letter announcing it, to Mr. Russell,  
in a letter of May 11th, in which he also  
infarmed Mr. Russell, that the Duke of  
Bassano had stated that tne decree had  
been duly communicated to him ; that  
Mr. Russell replied, in a letter to Mr.  
Barlow of the 29th May, that his first  
knowledge of the decree was derived  
from his letter, and that he has repeat  
edly stated the same since to this go-  
vernment. The paper marked A isa  
copy of an extract of Mr. Barlow’s let.  
ter to the Departinent oi State. of May  
12, 1812; B of the Duke ot Bassano’s  
letter to Mr. Barlow, ofthe 10th of the  
same month, C, of an extract of Mr.  
Barlow’s letter to Mr. Russell of May  
Lith; D, of an extract of Mr. Russell’s  
answer ofthe 29th May, and EB, of Mr.  
Russell’s letter to the Department of  
State of the 30th.  
  
The Secretary of State reports also  
  
that no communication of the Decree of  
‘the 28th April, 1811, was ever made to  
of the government of France, in regard’  
lo this decree ; the second, to that of the;  
government of the United States: In.

latter point, it seems to be proper to meet ,

Barlow’s communication, that a prior  
letter of May 1811 in which he had  
transmitted a copy of the deeree for the  
information of this government had not  
been received. Further explanations  
were expected from Mr. Barlow, but  
none were given. The light in which  
this transaction was viewed by this go-  
vernment was noticed by the President  
in his message to congress, and commu-  
nicated also to Mr. Barlow in a letter of  
the 14th July, 1812, with a view to the  
requisite explanation from the French  
government, On the Sth day of May,  
1812, the Emperor left Paris for the  
  
north, and in two days thereafter the’  
  
Duke of Bassano followed him. A ne-  
  
| gotiation for the adjustment of injuries,  
  
und the arrangeinent of our commerce,  
with the government of France, long  
depending, and said to have been  
brought nearly to a conclusion, at the  
time of Mr. Barlow&#x27;s death, was sus-  
  
nded by that event. His successor,  
ately appoipted, is authorised to resume  
the negotiafion, and to conclude it. He  
is instructed to demand redress of the  
French government for every injury  
and an explanation of its motive for with-  
holding from this government a know-  
ledge of the decree for so long a time  
ufter its adoption.  
  
It appears by the documents referred  
to, that Mr. Barlow lost no time, after  
having obtained a knowledge of the ex-  
istence of the French decree of the 28th  
April, 1811, in demanding a copy of it,  
and transmitting it to Mr. Russell, who  
immediately laid it before the British  
government, urging, onthe ground of  
this new proof of the repeal of the French  
decrees, that the British orders in coun-  
cil should be repealed. Mr. Russell’s  
note to lord Castlereagh bears date on  
the 20th of May; lord Castlereagh’s  
reply on the 23d, in which he promised  
to submit the decree to the consideration  
of the Prince Regent. It appears, how-  
ever, no encouragement was given at  
that time to hope that the orders in coun-  
cil would be repealed in consequence of  
that decree ; and that although it was  
afterwards made the ground of their re-  
peal, the repeal was nevertheless to be  
ascribed to other causes. ‘Their repeal  
  
‘lid not fake effect until the 23d of June,  
nofe than a month after the French de- °  
  
  
  
cree had been laid before the British go-

verninent ; a delay indicating, in itself,  
at a period so momentous and critical,  
not merely neglect, but disregard of the  
  
French decree That the repeal of the  
British orders in council was not produ  
eed by the French decree, other proofs  
might be adduced. I will state one,  
which in additionto the evidence contain-  
ed in the letters from Mr. Russell here-  
with communicated marked G, is deem  
ed conclusive. In the communication  
of Mr. Baker to Mr. Graham on the 9th  
August, 1812, which was founded on  
instructions from his government, of as  
late date as the 17th June, in which he  
stated, that an official declaration would  
be sent to this country, proposing a con  
ditional repeal of the orders. in council,  
so far as they affected the United States,  
no notice whatever was taken of the  
French decree. One of the conditions  
then contemplated was, that the orders  
in council should be revived at the end  
of 8 months, unicss the conduct of the  
French government and the result of the  
communications with the government of  
the U. States should be such as in the  
opinion of the British government to  
render their revival unnecessary ; a con-  
dition which proves incontestably that  
the French decree was not considered  
by the British government a sufficient  
ground on which to repeal the orders in  
council. It proves also that on that day  
the British government had resolved not  
to repeal the orders on the basis of that  
decree ;’since the proposed repeal was to  
depend not on what the French govern-  
ment had already done, bot what it  
might do, and on arrangements to be  
entered into with the U. S. unconnect-  
ed with the French repeal

.h;‘ st Awngult 18, by which the  
} clin and Milan decrees were declar.  
3d 1o be repeaded, the Britith govern.  
ment chaoged its tone, and continued  
orifzin its demands, to the morent  
. hat war was declared. It objeted  
firti that the French repeal was con­  
ditional, and not absolute : althsegh.  
the only condition atrached to it, was,  
that G. Britain thonld follow the ex­  
gmple, or the United Statet fulfil their  
pledge by executing the non importa-’  
tion a&amp;t against her. 1t was then de­  
manded that France should repeal  
_her iaternal regulations, as a condi.  
_tion of the repeal of the British orders  
“in council. . Next, that the French  
repeal fhonld be extended to all nea­  
tral nations, as well as to the United  
.States. and lastly, that the ports of  
“her enemies, and all ports from which  
the Britith flag was excleded, thould  
‘be opened to the Britith mantfa&amp;ures  
1 American vessels ; conditions {o ex  
‘travagant as to fatisfy all difpaflion.  
ate minds that they were demanded,  
not in the expegtation that they would  
or cculd be complied with, but to ger.  
minate the discussion.  
~On full consideration o§all circum­  
stances, it appeared that the period  
“had arrived, when it became the duty  
of the United States to take that at.  
titude with G. Britain, which was  
due to their violated rights, to these.  
‘curity of their most important interelts,  
and to their charaer as an‘indepen.  
‘dent nation. To have shrunk from  
‘the crisis would have been to abandon  
“every thing valuable to a free people.  
The surrender of our seamen to Brit.  
‘ifh imprefiment, with the deftru&amp;ion  
of our mnavigation and commerce,  
would not have been its oniy evils.  
The desolation of property, however  
‘great and widely spread, affects anin­  
terelt which admits of repair. The  
wound is incurable only, which fixes  
&#x27;a stigma &#x27;on the national hogor.  
While the spirit of the people is in­  
{ubdued, there will always be found  
in their virtue a vefource equal to the  
greate@ dangers and most trying em.  
ergencies. It igin the natire of free  
government, to inspire in the body of  
the people generous and noble senti­  
ments, and it is the duty of the confii­  
tuted authorities to cherilh and ap­  
peal to those {entiments, and rely on  
the patriotic fapport of théir confita­  
ents. Had they proved themselves  
tmequal to the cnifis, the Hiolt faral  
confcquences would have resulted  
from it- The proof of their weakness  
would have been recorded ; bitt&#x27;not on  
them alone would its banetul effe&amp;ts  
have been visited: It would have  
shaken the foundation of the- govérn.  
ment itfelf, snd even of the sacred  
principles of the revolution, on which  
all our political inficutions depend.  
i’ielding to the pretensions of a for.  
eign power,without making a manly  
effort ini defence of our rights, with.  
out appealing to the virtue of the peo.  
ple, or to the Rrength&#x27; of onr Udion,  
it would havé been charged &#x27;and be-  
Yieved that in these sources lay the hid­  
den defeéts. Where would the good  
people of these slates have beén able  
to miake another (sand ® Where  
wotld hdve béen their rallying point ?  
The government of their chaice hav.  
iag beeri difionored, its weakaefs &amp;  
that of their institutions démonftrated,  
the trinmph of the enemy would have  
been complete. It would also have  
been durable. i Gaa - g  
  
The constituted authoriiés of the  
United States peither dreadéd or an­  
ticipatéd thele evils. They had full  
confidence in the firength of the Uni­  
on, in the firmaefs and.virtue of the  
people, and were farisfied, when the  
appeal should be made, that ample  
proof would be afforded, that their  
confidence had nor beén misplaced.  
Foreign pressure, it was&#x27;not doubted,’  
would foen dissipate foreign partiali.

The Secretary of State, to whom s referved several  
resolutions of the House of Kepresentavves of the 21st  
wlt. requesting information on certain pointa relating  
to the French Decree of the 28tk of April, 1811, has  
she honor so make the President the following  
REPORT ;  
~IN furnishing the information requird by the House  
of Representatives, the Sccretary of ftate presumes,  
that it might be decmed sufficient br him to state  
what is now. demanded, what part thereof has been  
heretofore communicated, und to supply the defic­  
fency:. He considers it however mowx conformuble  
&quot; to the views of the House, to meet at this time,  
without regardiog what has been alvendy communi.  
cated, every enquiry, and 10 give &amp; dstinct answer  
to each, with the proper explanationrelating to it  
The House of R-presentatives has requested in­  
formation, when, by whom, and in what manner,  
the first intelligence was given to thisgovernment of  
the decree of the government of Flance, bearing  
date on the 28th April, 1811, and ’mporting to be  
a definitive lepeal of the decrecs of Brlin and Mi­  
lan; whether Mr. Russell, late Charg d’Afiaires of  
the United States to the government f France, ev­  
er admitted or denied to hLis government the cor­  
rectuess of the declaration of the Dule of Bassano,  
to Mr. Barlow, as stated in Mr Barbw’s letter of  
the 12th Muy, (812, to the Secretaryuf State, that  
the said decree had been commuuicata 1o his, Mr  
Barlow’s predecessor there, and to liy before the  
House any correspopdence with Mr. Rwsell on that  
subject, which it may not be improperto communi­  
cate, and also any correspondence bet%en Mr. Bar­  
low and Mr. Russell in possession of the Department  
of State; whether the Minister of Fraice to the U­  
nited States everinformed this government of the ex­  
istence of the said decree, and to lay before the  
House any, correspondence with the sid. Minister  
relative thereto not improper to be communicated ;  
®ith any other information in poesessionof the Ex.  
ecutive, which he may not deem it in&#x27;;:}om to the  
public interest to disclose, relative to tie said de­  
cree, tending to shew at what time, by whom and  
ir. what manner, it was firs. made known to this go­  
vernment or to any of its representatives or agents,  
and lastly, to inform the House whether the governe  
ment of the United States hath ever received from  
that of France any explanation of the reasons of  
that decree being &#x27;concealed from this ‘fovemment,  
and its minister, for so long a time aflerits date,  
and if such explanation has been asked by this gov­  
ernment, and has been omitted to be given by that  
of France, whether this goveinment has mn&amp; any  
remonstrance or expressed any dissatisfaction to the  
government of France at such concealment.  
These enquii ies embrace two distinct objects. The  
first relates to the conduct of the government of  
France, in regard to this decree. Ihe second, to  
that of the government of the United States In  
satisfying the call of the House, on this latter point,  
it seems to be proper to meetit in two-fold view;  
first, as it relates to the conduct of this government  
in this transaction; secondly, as it relates to its con­  
duct towards both belligerents in some important  
circumstances connected with it. The resolutions  
do not call specially for a report of snch extent, but  
as the measures 01 the Executive, and the acts of  
Congress, founded on communications from the Ex­  
ecutive, which rclate to onc of the belligerents,  
have by necessary consequence an immediate rela­  
tion to the other, such a report seems to be obvi­  
ously comprised githin their scoi:e On this prin.  
ciple the report is prepared, n the expectation, that  
the more full the information given, on every branch  
of the subject, the more satisactory will it be to the  
kouse.  
The Secretary of State has the honor to renort, in  
reply to these enquiries, that the first intelligence  
which this government received of the French de­  
cree of the 28th April, 1811, was communicatad b  
Mr. Barlow, in a letter bearing date on the llti  
May, 1812, which was received by this department  
on the 13th July following : that the first intimation  
to Mr. Barlow, of the existence of that decree, as  
appears by his communications, was givén by the  
Duke of Bassano, in an informal conference on some  
day between the Ist and 10th of May, 1812, and  
that the official communication of it to Mr Barlow,  
was made on the 10th of that month, at his request :  
that Mr. Barlow transmitted a copy of that decree,  
and of the Duke f Bassano’s letter announcing it  
to Mr. Russell, in a letter of May 11th, in which  
he also informed Mr. Russell, that the Duke of Has.  
sano had stated that the decree had been duly com­  
municated to him: that Mr. Rassell replicd, in o  
letter to Mr. Barlow of the 29th May, that his first  
knowledge of the Jecree was dcrivei from his letter,  
apd that he has repeatedly stated the same since to  
this government. The paper marked Ais a copyof  
an extract of Mr. Barlow’s letter to the Department  
of State, of May 12, 1812; B, of the Duke of Bas­  
sano’s letter to Mr. Barlow, of the 10th of the same  
month; C, of an extract of Mr. Brriow’s letter to  
Mr. Russell of May 11th; D, of an extract of M~  
Russeli’s answer of the 20th M;{. and E, of M..  
Russell’s letter to the Department of State of the 30th

munication of the decree of the 28:h April, 1811,  
was ever made to this government bLt: minister of  
France or other person, than as is a stated, and  
that no explanation of the cause of its not baving  
been commaunicated to this government and publish­  
ed at the time of its date, was ever made to this

tons were expected from Mr. Barlow, but wene  
were sivcn. The light in which this transuction was  
view.d by this government was noticed by the Pres­  
ident in his message to Congress, and communicats  
ed also to Mr. Barlow in a ﬁm of the 14th Juiy,  
1812, with a view to the requisite explanation from  
the French government, On the 9th day of May,  
1812, the Emperor left Paris for the North, and n  
two days thereafter the Duke of Bassano followed  
him. A negociation for the adjustment of injuries,  
and the arrangement of our commerce, with the  
government of France, long depending, and ssid to  
have been brought nearly to a conclusion, at the  
time of Mr. Barlow’s deat‘. was suspended by that  
event. His successor, lately appointed, is authoiiz.  
ed to resume the negociation, and to conclude it.  
He is instructed to mmd redress of the French  
fovernment for every injury, and an explanation of  
ts motive for withholding from this governmept a  
knowledge of the decree sor s 0 long a time aftef its  
adoption !  
  
It appears by the documents referred to, that Mr.  
Barlow lost no time, afier having obtsined a knowl  
cdge of the existence of the French decree of ih¢  
28th April, 1811, in demanding a copy of it, and  
transmitting it to Mr, Russell, who Jmme.  
diately laid it before the British government, urging,  
‘on the ground of this new proof of the repeal of  
the French decrees, that the Rritish orders in coun­  
cil should be repealed. Mr. Russell’s note to Lord  
Castlercagh beurs date on the 20th of May; Lord  
Custlereagh’s reply on the 23d, in whick he promis­  
ed to submit the decree to the consideration of the  
Prinee Regent. It appears, however, that no en.  
couragement was given at that time to hope that the  
orders in council would be repealed in&#x27;consequence  
of that decree ; and that although it wus afterwards  
made the ground of their repeal, the repeal was  
nevertheless to be ascribed to other causes. Their  
repesl did not take effect until the 23d of June,  
more than a month after the French decree had been  
laid before the British government ; a delay indicat.  
ing, in itself, ata period so momentous and criticsl,  
not me rely neglect but disregard of the French de­  
cree.’ That the repeal of the British orders in coun.  
cil was not produced by the French decree, other  
proofs might be adduced. 1 will state one, which  
in addition to the evidence contained in the letters  
from Mr. Russell, herewith communicated marked  
G, is deemed conclusive In the commuuication of  
Mr. Baker to Mr. Graham, on the 9th August, 1812,  
which was founded on instructions from his gover­  
ment, of as late date as the 17th June, in wg‘i)ch he  
stated that an official declaratiun would be sent to  
this country, proposing a conditional repea) of the  
orders in council, so far as they affected the United  
States, no notice whatever was taken of the French  
decree. One of the conditions then contemplated  
was, that the orders in council should be revived ut  
the end of eight months, unless the conduct of the  
Freach government and the result of the communi­  
cations with the government of the Ueited States,  
should be such us in the opinion of the Briiish gov­  
ernment to render their revival unnecessary , a can.  
dition which proves incontestibly that the French  
decree was not considered by che British governrnt  
a sufficient ground on which to repesl the in  
council. It Km&#x27;” also \lat on that day the British  
government had resolved not to repeal the ordeps on  
the basis of that decree ; since the proposed gul  
was to depend not on what the French government  
had already done, but on what it might do, and on  
arrangements to be entered into with the U, w.  
unconnected with the Freach repeal. -  
The French decree of the 28&amp; April, 1811, was  
transmitted to tl.e United States by the Wasp, a  
public vessel, which had been loog a waiting, at the  
ports of Great Britain and France, despatches from  
our ministers relating to these very important con­  
cerns with both governments. It was received ag  
the Department of State on the 13th July, 18i2,  
nearly a month after the declaration of war ag:’mst  
Great Britain, Intelligence of the repeal of the or­  
ders in council was not received until about the mid­  
dle of the following month. It was impossible,  
therefore, that either of those scts, in whatever  
light they might be viewed, should have been taken  
into consideration, or have had any influence in des  
ciding on that important event  
Had the British government been dispesed to repeal  
its orders in council, in conformity with the princi:  
ple on which it professed to have issued them, and  
on the condition which it had itself prescribed, there  
Was no reason to delay the repeal until such a decrep  
as that of the 28th April, 1811, should be produced.  
Fhe declaration of the French government of Au­  
gust 5, 1810, had fully satisfied every claim of the  
British government according to its own principles  
on that point. 3y it the decrees of Berlin and Mi.  
lan were declarcdy to be repealed, the repeal to take  
effect on the Ist November following, on which day  
it did take effect. The only condition attached to  
it, was, either that Great Hritain should follow the  
example, and repeal her orders in council, or that  
the Unitcd States should carry into effect against her  
their non-importation act. ‘This condition was in its  
nature subsequent, not greccdent, reserving a right  
in France to revive her decrees in case neither alter­  
native was performed. By this dcclaration it was  
put completely in the power of Great Britain to ter­  
minate this controversy in a manncr the most honor­  
able to herself. France had yielded to her the  
round on a condiiion with which she had declared  
ger willingness to comply. Had she complied, the  
non-imp-rtation act would not have been catried into  
efiect, nor could the French decrees have been re.  
vived By refusing to comply, she has made berself  
respunsible for all ihat has since followed.  
Ry the decree of the 28th April, 1811, the decrees  
of Berlin and Milan were said to be definitively re.  
pealed ; and the execution of the non.importation  
act against Great Britain was declared to be the  
greund of that repeal. The repeal announced by  
the declaration of the sth August, 1810, was abso­  
lute and final, except as to the condition subsequent  
attached toit. This latter decree acknowledges that  
that condition had been performed, and disclaims  
the right to revive it, in consequence of that perfor­  
mance, und, extending back to the Ist of Novem.  
ber, confirms in every ciscumstance the gfeeedl:g  
repeal. The latter act, therefore, as to the repe  
i nothing more than a confirmation of the former,  
It is in this sense that those two acts are 10 be un­  
derstood in France. It is in the same sense that  
they are to be regarded by other powers.  
In repcaling the orders ia council on the pretext  
of the French decree of the 28:h April, 1811, the  
British government has conceded that it ought to  
have repealed them on the declaration of the sth of  
August, 1810. It is impossible to discriminate be.  
tween the (\wo acts, or to separate them from each  
other, 50 as to justify, on sound and consistent prin­  
ciples, the repeal J the orders in council on the  
gmndofooeaet.mdunnfuultomm  
on that of the other The second act the re­  
peal definitive; but l.&#x27;o: .;.ht nnoah f&#x27; m“u:  
nen-importation act h put in force  
Britain, in compliance with the condition omqm  
attached to the former repeal. and her refusal to  
perform it That act being still in force, and the  
decree of the 28th Apul, 1811, being expressly  
founded on it, Orealc:‘b repeals ber orders in  
council on the basis of this latter decree. The con­  
clusion is, therefore, irresistable, that by this repea),  
  
under al the e cumstances attending it, the Brish  
government has acknowledged the justice of the  
claim of the United States 10 a repeal on the foymer  
occasion. By acocpting the lauver nc.l, it has  
sanctioned \he preceding one ; ithas saficttoneh also  
the conduct of this guvernment in carrying into’ ef­  
fect the nondmportation act .‘um Great Britain,  
founded on the preceding repeal.  
Other important consequences result from this re­  
peal of the British government. By faie and obvious  
construction the acceptunce of the decree of the 281 h  
April, 1811, as the of the repeal of the or­  
ders in council, “md be construed to extend  
back to t e Ist November, 1810, the day on which  
the preCcdinf repeal took effect. The S’unm‘y of  
State has full confidence, that if the question could  
be submitted to the judgment of an impartial judi­  
cial tribunal; such would be its decision He has  
tqual confidence that such will be the judgment pro.  
nounced onit by the enlightened and impartial world,  
If, however, these two acts could be separated from  
cach other, 30 as that the latter might be made the  
basis of the iepeal of the orders in council, distinet  
from the former, it follows that, beu&#x27;ing date on the  
28th April, 1811, the repeal ought to have relation  
to that date. In legal conatruction, between nations  
us well as individuals, acts, are o be respected  
from the time they begin to operate, and, where  
they impose a moral or politieal obligation on anoth­  
er party, that obligation commences with the com­  
mencement of the act. Bt it has been urged that  
the French dcerce was not promulgated, or made  
known to the British government, until a year after  
its date. This objection hasno force. By accepting  
an aet bearing date a year before it was promulgat­  
ed, it is admitted that in the interval nothin’ wus  
dune repugnant to it. It cannot be presu that  
sny government would sceept from another, as the  
basis on which it was to found an important measure,  
an act of anterior and remote date, pledging iself  
10 a certain course of conduct which that govera  
ment had in the interval departed from and violated  
I auy government had violated «m act the injunc­  
tons of which it was boeund to observe by an anteri  
or one, in relation to a third ?urty. and which it pro.  
fessed to have obseived, before its acceptance by  
the other, it could not be presumed that it would  
cease to violate it afier the acceptance. The con.  
clusion is irresistable, that if the other Fovemmcm  
did accept such act with a knowledge of its anteces  
dunt violation, s the foundation of any measure on,  
its own purt, that such act must bave been the os­  
tensible only, and not the real motive of such measure.  
The declaration of the Prince Regent of the 21st  
April, 1812, is in full confirmation of these remarks.  
By this act of the British government it is formally  
annpunced, on the authority of a report of the Se.  
cretary of Foreign Affairs 1o the Conservative Sen­  
ate of France, that the French decrees were still in  
forcs, and that the orders in council sheuld not be  
repealcd. It cannot fail to excite considersble sur  
prize that the Britidh government should immedinte.  
ly afterwards, thatis, 6n thie 23d June, repeal its  
orders in council, on the ground of the French de.  
cree of the 28un Aprii, 1811. By this proceeding  
the British government has invelved itself in mani.  
fest inconsistency. It has maintained by one act,  
that the French decrees were in full force, and by  
another that thc{ wele rcreuled during the same  
space of time It admits alse, that by no act of the  
French government or its cruizers, had any viola.  
tion of the repesl annonnced by the declaration of  
the ¥ government of the Sth August, 1810,  
heen&#x27;c &#x27; op #tleust, that such ’ﬁ&quot;‘w  
not had sufficient weight to prevent the repeul ofthe  
orders in couneil.  
  
It was objected that the declaration of the French  
government of the sth of Aum 1510, &#x27;was not  
such an uct as the British government ought to have  
regurded. The Secretary of Stute is thorvughl  
isatisfi~d (hat this objection is altogether untwn«‘l«(  
/It was comimunicated by the Emperor through his  
&quot;hifhelt official orgun, the Secretary of Foreign Af­  
fairs, to the minister plenipotentiary of the United  
. States at Paris. It is impossible to com?&amp; an act  
more formal, authentic or obligatory on the French  
government than that ulluded to oes one govern:  
ment ever ask or expect from another to secure the  
performance of any duty, huwever important, more  
than its official pledge, fiirly und fully expressed?  
Cun better security be given for its performance ?  
Had there been any doubt on this subject, the eon­  
duct of Great Britain herself, in simil r cases, would  
have completely removed it. The whole history of  
“her diplomatic intercourse with other powers, on  
the subject «f blockade, is in uccoid with this pro.  
ceeding of the French government. We know that  
when her government institutes &amp; blockade, the Se.  
cretary of Foreign Affuirs announces it to the min.  
isters of other powers at London ; and that the same  
form is observed when they are revoked. Nor waus  
the authenticity of either act, thus announced, ever  
  
questioned,  
Haud 4 similar declaration been made b{ the minis­  
teu France in &#x27;he Unied States to this govern.  
men®; by the ovder of his own, would it not have  
been ertitied to ‘fespect, respected ! By  
the usuge of nations stch id not bavz&#x27;  
been withhcld The arrange de with Mr.  
Erskine is o full proof of the good faith of this go.  
vernment, and of its impartislity, in its transactiond  
with both the belligerents. It was made with that  
minister on the ground of his public character, and  
¢he confidence &amp;:h : on which basis the nonan.  
tercourse wus 1 as to England and left in fail  
force against France The fuilure of that urrange  
ment was imputable to the British government alone,  
who, in rejecting it, took un itself a high responsi­  
billz. not simply, in regard to the conscquences at:  
tending it, but in disavowing and annuling (he act  
of its minister, without shiewing that he had ¢xceed­  
ed bhis authority. In accepting the dcclaration of  
the French minister of l»rc&#x27;:?n uffairs, in proof of  
the French repeal, the United States gave no proof  
of improper credence to the government of France.  
On a comparison of both trunsactions, it will appesr  
~that if « marked confidence and respect was shewn  
to cither government, it was 10 that of Great Britain,  
In accepting the declarution of the governmefit of  
France in the presence of the Emperor, the United  
ftates stood on more gecure ground, than in aceept.-  
ing that of a Bricish minister in this conntry,  
. To the demand made by the United States of the  
repeal of* the British orders in council founded on  
the basis of the Prench repeal, of August 5, (810,  
the Betish government replied, by demanding » co  
py of the orders issued by the Freach government  
for carrying into effect that repeal; a demand with­  
out example in the intercourse between na ions. By  
this demand it ceased to be u question whether the  
French repeal was of sufficient extent, or was found.-  
ed on justifisble condivons. The pledge of the  
French government was doubted , a seratiny was to  
be instituted as to the manner in which it was to be  
discharged, and its faith “rnun«l. not by the sub.  
scquent conduct of its cruizers towards the vessels  
of the United States, but by a copy of the orders  
q:cn to its cruizers. Where would this end ! I  
the French government intended a fraud, by its de­  
claration ol‘o repeal, announced to the minister of  
the United States, and sfterwards to this government,  
might it not hkewise commit a fraud in any other  
core municatics which it might make ! If credit was  
relared by the fritich goretament to the wct of the  
  
French government, thus formally auwnounceu, IB+  
probuble that it would huve been given by it, ”‘tx&quot;  
document %«_hferhfcbuscur. directed to its own  
people Al &amp;it was the policy and might be  
the mw British government to enguge the  
United States in such a controversy with the rm  
govérament, it was far from mronm‘ with thei  
Amemtbt:d&#x27;:pi‘th &#x27;l“::‘yd eonndc.d rbe’d‘lbte\ eir duty to  
accept t a Y made French .  
ernment, of its decrees, and to look to its conm  
and to that of s cruizers, sanctioned by the gov­  
ernment, for tge faithful performance or violation of  
it. The United States having been iq!:ted by botly  
powers, were unwilling in their exertions to obtain  
Justice of gither, to become thc instrument of the  
other They were the less inclined ta it in the pres­  
ent instance, from the consideration, that the parcy  
making the pressure on them maintained in full force  
its unlawtul edicts against the American commerce,  
while it could rot dens that a considerable advance,  
at least, had been gade by the other towurds a com.  
plete accommodation, it being manifest to the world,  
not only shiy the faith of the French government  
stood plycd&#x27;cd for the repeal of its decrees, but thag  
the repealdid take effect on the 3st of November,  
1810, in yegard to the United States; that severa)  
American vessels taken under them had been deliv.  
ered up,y the judicial decisions suspended on all, by  
its ordery and that it also continued to give the most  
positive assurances that the repeal shouid .be faity.  
fally observed. :  
It has also been nrﬁed that the French repeal was  
conditional, and for that reason could fot be accept.  
ed. This objection has already been fully answe red,  
It merits attemtion, however, that Ihe acts of the  
British government relating to this subject, particu.  
lurly the declaration of the 21st of Apnil 1812, and  
the repeal of the 23d June of \he same year, are ¢-  
qually wnd in like manner conditional. It is not a  
little surprising, that the British government should  
have ob{rtted to &amp; measure in another government,  
to which it has itself givén a sanctio:. by its own acts.  
luis prog::. however, to remak that this objecs  
tion hus been completely waved and given up by the  
acceptance of the decree of the 28th April, 1811,  
The British &amp;overnmcnt has urged ilso, that it  
could not confide in the fuithful performance by the  
French government of any engugement it migl?t en­  
ter into relstive to the rc’nal o;‘ its decrees. Thig  
objection woltld be «-%ual y spplicable to any other  
compact to be entered into with France. While  
maintained it would be a bar ta any tréaty, even tog  
treaty of peace, between them But it also has becy  
admitted to be unfounded by the acceplance of the  
dcxof the 28h April, 1811,  
Secretury of State presumes that these fucty  
and explanations, supported us they are by authens  
tic documents, pl‘ow.&#x27;ﬁut, thut tze repeal of the  
British ordars in council was not to be uscribed to&#x27;  
the French decree bearing date on the 28th April  
1811, and ucondl{, that in meking that dedree the  
basis of their repeul, the British government has con/  
ceded that it ought to have repealed them on the  
ground of the declaration of the French government  
of &amp;th Angust, 1810, so as 0 take effect on the 1o  
November following. To what cuuse the repeal of  
the Briush orders in council was ?uuly utiributable,  
caanot now remain a doubt, with any, who haveg  
marked with a just discernment the course of events,  
I must afford great consolution 10 the good people  
of these States, to know that they have not submit.  
ted to privations in vain, \ ‘  
~ The discussion of other wrongs, particulurly thae  
-relating to nnpressment, had been closcd some time  
hefore the period aituded o, T wan nnwuoithy of  
the character of the United Stutes to pursue the  
discussion on that diffcrence, when it wis evident  
thut no advantuge could be devived from it. The  
ri&#x27;fht was pegerved, to be brought forward and wige  
e lg&#x27;am.f‘*a it might be do e with eflect. In the  
me n time practice of impressment was peise­  
vered in vith vigor, .  
At the time when war was declared against Great  
Britain, no satisfactory arrangement wae offcred, o  
_likcly to be obtained, respecting impressment, and  
nothing was more remate from the expectation of  
this government, than the repeal of the orders in  
council. Ewry circumstance which had oceurred  
tending to ilustrate the puliey and views of the Bri.  
tish government rendercd such an event alogethey  
improbuble, From the commencement of that sys­  
tem of hostility, Jvhich Gl:: Britain Mh a:llopicd  
aguinst the United States, her pretentions had grad­  
ually increased, o n&#x27;:&#x27;m, h:ﬂﬂ nmore fullyg une  
folded, according to circumstances, until st the mo.  
ment when war was deciarea they hud ussumed o  
characier which dispelied all prospect of accomnioda­  
tion The orders in council were said to have been 1.  
depted on a princi{g\e of retaliution on France, althe’  
at the time when the order of May, 186, was issted,  
no measure of France had oc:zrred on which it  
couid be retaliatory, and at the date of the vext or­  
der, Jan. 1807, it was hardly poasible that this gov.  
ernment should have even heard of the decree of  
Berlin to which it related. It was stated at the time  
of their adoption. and for some time afterwards, that  
{hey should be revoked us soon as France revoked  
‘her decrees, and that the British government would  
proceed with the government of France parn pass  
‘in the revocation. After the declarution, however,  
of the French government of the Sth Aug. 1810, by  
which the Berlin and Milun decrees were declared  
to be repcaled, tbe British government changed its  
tone, and continued to rise ﬁito demands, to the  
moment war was declared. It objected first that the  
French repeal wus conditionhal, and not absolute ; a}-  
though the enly condition attached to it, was, that  
G. Britain should follow the example, or the United  
#tates fuifil their pledfe by executing the non-ime  
portation act agamst her. It was then demanded  
u‘n France should repesl her internsl rey glations,as  
a&quot;condition of the repeal of the British vrders in  
countcil, Neit, that the French repeal shouid be ex.  
tended to all neutral nations, as well as to the Units  
ed States, and lastly, that the ports of her encmies,  
and all ports from which the British ﬂu’ wius exclud­  
ed, should be opened to British munutuctures in A­  
merican vessels ; conditions s 0 exXtravagant ug to sate  
isfy all dispassionate minds that they were demand.-  
ed, not in the expectation that they would or could  
be complied with, but to terminate the discus.ion  
On full consideration of all circumstances, it «p­  
-peared that the period had arrived, when it becomo  
the Auty of the United States to take that attitude  
with Grest Britain, which was due to their violated  
rights, to the security of their most important intere  
ests, and to their character as an independent na­  
tion. To haveshiruok from the cr::io would have  
been to abandon every thing valuable to a free peo­  
ple. The surrender of our sestoen to British ime  
pressment, with the destruction of our navig:.tion  
and commerce, ;rould not b&#x27;:;c been its o:inyd c:‘ill:.‘  
The desolation of proper y, however tand w

on the national honor. While the lﬁdtof the m

most trying emergencies. It is in the nature of free:  
government, to inspire in the body of the

The French decree of the 28th April,  
1811, was transmitted to the U. States  
by the Wasp, a public vessel, which had  
been long awaiting at the ports of Great  
Britain and France, despatches from our  
ministers relating tu these very impor-  
tant concerns with both governments.  
It was received at the Department of  
State on the 13th July, 1812, nearly a  
month after the declaration of war a  
gainst G. Britain. Intelligence of the  
repeal of the orders in council was not  
received until about the middle of the  
following month. It was impossible,  
therefore, that either of those acts, in  
whatever light they might be viewed,  
should have beer:.taken into considera  
tion, or have had any influence in decid.  
ibg on that important event.  
  
ad the British government been  
disposed to repeal its orders in council,  
m conformity with the principle on  
which it professed to have issued them,  
and on the-condition which it had itself  
prescribed, there was no reason to delay  
the repeal until such a decree as that of  
the 28th April, 1811, should be produ-  
ced, The declaration ofthe French go  
vernment of August 5, 1810, had fully  
satisfied every claim ofthe British go.  
vernment according to its own princi  
  
Ee on that poitit. ‘By it the decrees of  
rlin and Milan were declared to be  
repealed, the repeal to take effect on the  
  
Ist November following, on which day  
it did take effect. The only condition  
attached to it, was, either that Great  
Britain should follow the example, and  
repeal her orders in council, or that the  
United States should carry into effect a-  
gainst«her their non-importation act.—  
This condition was in its nature subse-  
quent, not precedent, reserving a right  
im France to revive her decrees in case  
neither alternative was performed. By  
this declaration it was put completely in  
the power of Great Britain to-terminate  
  
[ 300 }  
  
ing to comply,  
  
sed responsible for all that has since follow-;  
The Secretary of State, to whom were ed  
  
By the decree ofthe 28th April, 1811,  
‘the decrees of Berlin and Milan were  
said to be definitively repealed ; and  
ithe execution of the non importatiwn act  
| against Great Britain was declared to  
be the ground of that repeal. The re-  
peal aumeunced by the declaration of  
the 5th August, 1810, was absolute and  
final, except as to the condition subse-  
quently attached to it. This latter decree  
acknowledges that that condition had  
been performed, anc disclaims the right  
ito revive it, in consequence of that per.  
furmance, and extending back to the  
first of November, confirms in every  
circumstance thé preceding repeal.—  
Vhe latter act, therefore, as to tiie repeal,  
‘is nothing more than a confirmation of  
‘the former. Itis in this sense that those  
ltwo acts are to be understood in France.  
It is in the same sen$e that they are to  
be regarded by other powers.  
  
In repealing the orders in couneil on  
the pretext of the French decree of the  
28th April, 1811, the British govern-  
ment has coneeded that it ought to have  
repealed them on the declaration of the  
5th of August 1810. It is impossible to  
discriminate between the two acts, or tu  
separate them from each other, so as to  
justify, on sound and consistent princi-  
ples, the repeal of the orders in council  
on the ground of one act, and the refusal  
to repeal them on that of the other.—  
The second act makes the repeal defini-  
tive ; but for what reason? Because  
the non-importation act had been put in  
force against Great Britain, in compli  
ance with the condition subsequently. at  
tached to the former repeal, and her  
refusal to perform it. That act bein  
still in force, and the decree of the 28t  
April, 1881, being pm hg 3 founded on  
it, G. Britain repeals her orders in  
| council on the basis of this latter decree.  
—The conclusion is, therefore, irresis-  
tible, that by this ei Mo under all: the  
circumstances attending it, the British  
government has acknowledged the jus.  
tice of the claim of the United States to  
a repeal on the former occasion. By  
accepting the latter repeal, it has satic-  
tioned the preceding one; it has sanc-  
tioned also the conduct of this govern-  
ment m carrying into effect the non-im-  
rtation act against Great Britain,

Other important consequences result  
from this repeal of the British govern.  
ment. By fair and obvious construction  
the accertance of the decree of the 28th  
April, 1811, as the ground ofthe repeal  
of the orders in council, ought to be  
construed to extend back to the 1st No-  
  
  
  
  
  
she has made herself; vember 1810, the day en which the  
  
| preceding repeal took effect. ‘The Se-  
icretary of State has full confidence, that  
ifthe questiun could be submitted to the  
judgment of an impartial judicial tribu-  
nal, such would be its decision. He  
has equal confidence that such will be  
the judgment pronounced on it by the  
enlightened and impartial world, If,  
  
rated from each other, so as that the  
latter might be made the basis of the re-  
peal of the orders in council, distinct  
irom the former, it follows that, bearing  
date on the 28th Apri), 1811, the repeal  
ought to*have relation to that date. In  
legal construction, between nations as  
well as individuals, acts are to be res-  
pected trem the time they begin ta epe-  
rate, and, where they impose a moral or  
political obligation on another party, that  
obligation. commences with the com.  
mencement of the act,  
  
- Bat it has been urged thatthe French  
decree was not promulgated, or made  
known to the British government, until  
a year after its date. Phis objection has  
no force. By accepting an act bearing  
date a year before it was promulgated,  
it is admitted that in the interval nothing  
was done repugnant to it. It cannot be  
presumed that any government would  
accept from another, as the basis on  
which it was to found an important  
measure, an act of anterior and remote  
date, pledging itself to a certain course  
of conduct which that government had  
in the interval departed from and vio-  
lated. Ifany government had violated  
an act the injunctions of which it was  
bound to observe by an anterior one, in  
relation to a third party, and which it  
professed to have observed, before it’s  
acceptance by the other, it could not be  
oresamed that it would cease to violate  
it after the acceptance. The conclusion  
is irresistible, that if the other govern-  
inent did accept such act with a know-  
edge of its antecedent violation, as the  
foundation of any measure on it’s own  
part, that such act must have been the  
ostensible only, and not the real motive  
of such measure.  
  
The declaration of the Prince Regent  
ofthe 2ist April 1811, is in fall confir-  
mation of these remarks, By this act of  
the: British government, it is formally  
announced, on the authority of a report  
of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to the  
Conservative Senate of France, that the  
French decrees were stillin foree, and  
thatthe orders in council should not be  
repealed. It cannot fail to excite consi-  
derable surprize that the British govern-  
ment should immediately afterwards,  
thatis,on the 23d June, repeal its or-  
ders in council, on the ground of the

By tiis proceeding the British govern-

consistency. It has maintained by one

It. admits also, that by no act of the  
French government or its cruisers, had  
any violation of the repeal announced by  
the declaration of the French govern-  
meat of the 5th August 1810, been com.  
mitted, or at least, that such violation  
had not had sufficient weight to prevent  
the repeal of the orders in eattesil,  
  
It was objected that the declaration of  
the French government of the 5th Au-  
  
st 1810, was not such an act as the  
  
ritish government ought to have regar-  
ded. The Secretary of State is thorough-  
ly satisfied that this objection is entirely  
It was communicated by  
tae apse through his highest official  
organ, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs,  
tothe minister plenipotentiary of the UO.  
States at Paris. Itis impossible to con-  
  
obligatory on the French government  
than that alluded to. Does one govern-  
ment ever ask or expect from another,  
to secure the performance of any duty,  
however important, more than its official  
pledge, fairly and fully expressed ? Can  
  
etier security be given for its perfor-  
mance ? Had there been any doubt on  
this subject, the conduct of G. Britain  
herself, in similar cases, would have  
completely removed it, The whole his-  
tory of her diplomatic intercourse with  
other powers, on the subject of block-  
ade, is in accord with this proceeding of  
the French government. We know  
that when her government institutes a  
blockade, the Seeretary of Foreign Af-  
fairs announces itto the ministers ofother  
powers at London; and that the same  
form is observed when they are revo  
ked.. Nor was the authenticity of ei-  
he act, thus announced, ever question-  
ed.  
  
Had a similar declaration been made  
by the minister of France in the United  
States to this government, by the order  
of his own, would it not have been enti-  
tled to respect, and been respected, ? By  
  
asage of nations such respect could  
Rot have been withheld. The pevatige.  
Ment made with: Mr, Erskine is a tull  
proof of the good faith of this govern  
ment, and of its impartiality, in its trans.  
actions with both the belligerents, It was  
Made with that minister on.the ground

lence due to it ; on which basis the non-

to either government, it was to that of  
Great Britain. In accepting the decla-

&#x27; OCR RELATIONS WITH FRANCE.  
REPORT  
Of the Secretary of State, to whom •.it referred tent­  
ral reioiuttons of the Hnite cf Reprete-.tanvn of  
the 21tt uit reqvettirg information on certain point*  
relating to thiFrench aecr*eofthe2Uth rj April, 1811.  
[CONCLUDED 3  
To the demand made by the United States of the  
repeal of the British orders in council founded on ’  
the basis of tlie French repeal, of August 5, 1810, I  
the British government replied, by demanding * ;  
copy of the orders issued By tlie French government  
for carrying into effect that repeal j a demand with  
Out example in the intercourse between nations.— j  
By this demand it ceased to be a ques ion whether  
the French repeal w.t* AC - fV t •&#x27;tent, ■■■ vr i  
founded on justifiable conditions. Tiie pledge of  
the French government was doubted ; a scrutiny  
was to be inst&#x27;tuted as to the manner in which t  
was to be discharged, and its faith preserved, not  
by the subsequent conduct of its cruisers to warIs  
the vessels of the U. States, but by a copy of the  
orders given to its cruizers. Where would this  
end? if the French government intended a fraud, i  
by its declaration of repeal, announevd to the minis­  
ter of the United States, and afterwards to this  
government, might it not likewise commit a fraud  
in any other communication which it might make ?  
If credit was refused by the British government to  
the act of the French government thus formally an­  
nounced, is it probable that it would have been  
given by it, to any document of inferior character,  
directed to its own people ? Although it was tlie  
policy and might be the interest of the British go­  
vernment to engage the U. States in such a contro­  
versy with the French government, it was far from  
comporting w.th their interest to do it. They con­  
sidered it their duty to accept the repeal already  
made by the French government, of its decrees,  
and to look to its conduct and to that of its cruizers,  
sanctioned by the government, for ’heftithfil per­  
formance or violation of it. The U. S, having been  
injured by both power:-, were, unwilling, in tlieir  
exertions to obtain justice of either, to become the  
instrument of the other. They were the less in­  
clined to it in the present instance, from the *&#x27;onsi­  
deration, that the party making the pressure on  
them maintained in full force its unlawful edicts  
against the American commerce, while it could not  
deny that a considerable advance, at least, had been  
made by the other towards a complete accommoda­  
tion, it being manifest to the world, not only that  
the faith of the French government stood pledged  
tor the repeal of its decrees, but that the repeal did  
take effect on the 1st of November, 1810, in regard  
to the U. States ; that several American vessels ta­  
ken under them had been delivered up, god judi­  
1 cial decisions suspended on all, by its order, ar, i that  
j it also continued to give the most positive *h»u­  
1 ranees that the repeal should be faithfully observe&#x27;!  
it itai ..1*0 oeen urged that the French repeal  
was conditional, and for that reason could not be  
accepted. This objection has al-e:idy been fully  
answered. It merits attention, however, that the  
acts of the British government relating to this sub­  
ject, particularly the declaration of tlie 21st April,  
1812, ami the repeal of the 23d June of the same  
year, are equally and in like manner conditional.  
It is not a little surprising, that the British govern­  
ment should have objected to a measure in another  
government, to which it has itself given a sanction  
by its own acts. It is proper, however, to remark  
that this objection has been completely waved and  
given up bv the acceptance of the deci ee of the 26ih  
April, 1811.  
  
i ne British government has urged also, that it  
; could not confide in the faithful performance by the  
French government of any engagement it might en­  
ter into relative to the repeal ot its decrees. This  
objection tvould be equally applicable to any other  
compact to be entered into with France. ’ While  
maintained it would be a bar to any treaty, even to  
a treaty of peace, between them. But it also has  
been admitted to be unfounded by the acceptance  
of the decree of the 28th April, 1811.  
The Secretary of State presumes that these facts  
and explanations, supported as they are by authen­  
tic documents, prove, tirst, that the repeal of the  
British orders in council was not be ascribed to the  
French decree bearing date on the 28th April 1811;  
and secondly, that in making that decree the basis  
ot their repeal, the British government has conce­  
ded that it ought to have repealed them on the  
ground of tinsdeclaration of the French government  
of 5th August 1810, so as to take effect on the 1st  
Nave miter following. To what cause the repeal  
of the British orders in council was justly attributa­  
ble, there cannot now remain a doubt, with any,  
who have m irked with a just discernment the  
course ot events. It must afford great consolation  
to the good people of these states, to know that  
they have not submitted to privations in vain.  
1&#x27;lie discussion of other wrongs, particularly that  
relating to impressment, had been closed some time  
l»etore the period alluded to. It was unworthy ot  
the character ot the L nited States to pursue the  
discussion on that difference, when it was evident  
that no advantage could be derived from it. The  
right was reserved, to be brought forward and urg­  
ed again, when it might be done with effect. In  
the mean time the practice of impressment was per­  
severed in with vigor.  
At the time when war was declared against G.  
Britain, no satisfactory arrangement was offered,  
or likely to be obtained, respecting impressment,  
arui nothing was more remote from the expectation  
of this government, than the repeal of the orders  
in council, fcvery circumstance which had occur­  
red tending to illustrate the policy and views of the  
British government, rendered such an event alto­  
gether improbable. From the commencement of  
that system ot hostility, which G. Britain had adupt­  
ed against the U. Slates, her pretensions had gra­  
dually increased, or at least become more fully un­  
folded, according to circumstances, until at the  
moment when war was declared they had assumed  
a character which dispelled all prospect ct accom­  
modation. The orders in council were said to have  
been adopted on a principle of retaliation on France,  
although at the time when the order of May, 1806,  
was issued, no measure of France had occurred on  
which it coukl be retaliatory, and at the date of the  
next order January, 18uf, it was hardly poss ble  
that this government should have even heard of the  
decree of Berlin to which it related. It was stated  
at the time of their adoption, and for some time af­  
terwards, that they should be revoked as icon as  
France revoked her decrees, and that the British

government would proceed with the government tl  
f F.ioce pan p.tss* in the revtication After the n  
declaration, however, of the French government  
of the 5th August, 181U, by which the Berlin and •  
Milan decrees were declared to be repealed, the  
British government changed its lone, ami continued  
to r.se in its demands, to the moment that war was 1  
declared. It objected first that the French repeal r  
waa conditional, and not absolute 5 although the ^  
only condition attached to it, was, that G Britain  
should follow tiie example, or the U. States fulfil 0  
»hei&gt; pledge by executing the non-importation act 4

mu sit .tie ex pec&#x27;at ton that they would or could be  
complied w.th, but to terminate the discussion.  
On full r-s&#x27;*&gt;dt rition of all circumstances, it ap- &lt;  
pcs red tin.t the period? had arrived, when it became  
the duty of the U. States to take that attitude with ,  
G. Britain, w/uch w-s due to their violated rights,  
to the *(■ urity of their most important interests,  
and to i. ir character as an independent nation. To  
h-ve shrunk from the crisis vould have been to  
abandon every thing valuable to a free people. The  
surrender of our seamen to British impressment,  
with the destruction of our navigation and com­  
merce, would not have been its only evils. The  
desolation &lt; f property, however great and widely  
spread, afi. cts an interest which admits of repair.  
The wound 1* incurable only, which fixes a stigma  
on the national honor. While 1 he spirit of the peo­  
ple is unsubdued, there wnl always be found in  
their virtue a resource equal to the greatest dangers  
:&lt;nd most trying emergencies It is in the nature of  
free governments, to inspire in the body of the peo­  
ple generous and noble sentiments, and it is the  
duty of the constituted authorities to cherish and  
appeal to those sentiments, and elv on the patriotic  
support of their constituents. Had they proved  
themselves unequal to the crisis, the most fatal con­  
sequenct s would have resulted from it. The proof  
nf their weakness would have been recorded ; but I  
not on them alone would its baneful effects have  
been visited. It would have shaken the foundation !  
of the government itself, and even of the sacred  
principles of the revolution, on which all our politi­  
cal institutions depended. Yielding to the preten­  
sions of a foreign power, without making a manly  
effort in defence of our rights, without appealing  
to the virtue of the people, or to the strength of our  
Union, it would have been charged and believed  
that in these sources lay the hidden defects. Where  
Would the ,&#x27;ood people of these states have been  
able to make ahotber stand ? Where would have  
been the&#x27;.r rallying point? The government of  
their 1 hoice having b-cn dishonored, its weakness  
and th-t of their ingt.’ ,.ons demonstrated, the tri- !  
i uTOPh &gt;* 1 e rurpv w-’tdd h we comply -,e. It  
win id also have been durable.  
T he constituted authorities of the IT. States nei­  
ther dreaded or anticipated these evils. They had  
full confidence in the strength of the Union, in the  
firmness and virtue of the people, and were satisfi­  
ed, when the appeal should bo made, that ample  
proof would be afforded, that their confidence had  
not been misplaced. Foreign pressure, it was not  
den tiled, would soon dissipate foreign partialities  
and prejudices, if sucit existed, and unite us more  
j dose!)&#x27; together as one people.  
In declaring war against G. Britain the U. States  
have placed themselves tn a situation to retor: the  
hostility, which they had so long suffered from the  
British government. The m:unt&lt; nance of their  
rights was the object of the w.tr. Of the desire of  
this government to terminate the war on honorable  
conditions, ample proof has been afforded by the  
proposition made to the British government imme­  
diately after the de&lt; larstion of war, through the  
Charge d* Affaires of the United States at London,  
and bv the promptitude and manner of the accept­  
ance of the Mediation of the Emperor of Kusaia.  
It was anticipated by some, that a declaration of  
war against G. Britain would force the U. States in­  
to a close connection with her adversary, much to  
their disadvantage. The Secretary of State thinks  
it proper to remark, that nothing is more remote  
from the fact. The discrimination in favor of  
France, according to law, in consequence of her  
acceptance of the proposition made equally to both  
powers produced a difference between them in that  
special case, but in that only. The war with Eng­  
land was declared, without any consent or commu­  
nication with the French government j it has pro­  
duced no connection between the United States and  
France, or any understanding as to Its pros culion,  
continuance, or termination. The ostensible rela­  
tion between the two countries, is the true and only  
one. The U. States have just claims on France for  
spoliations on their commerce on the high seas, and  
in the ports of France, and their late Min.stir was,  
and their present Minister is, instructed, to de­  
mand reparation for these Injuries, and to press it  
with the energy due to the justice.of their claims  
and to t he character of the U. States. The result  
of the negotiation will be communicated to Con­  
gress in due time. The papers marked I contain  
copies of two letters, addressed from this Depart­  
ment to Mr. Barlow, one of the 16th June, 1812, (  
just before the declaration of war, the other ot the 1  
14&gt;lh July following, which shew distinctly the rela­  
tion existing between the United States and France  
at that interesting period. No change ha# since  
occurred in it.  
All of which is respectfully submitted,  
James monkoe

To the demand made by the United  
States of the repeal of the British orders  
in-council founded on the basis of the &gt;  
French repeal, of August 5, 1819, the  
British government replied, by demand-  
ing a copy: of the orders issued’ by the -  
French government, for carrying into  
effect that repeal ; a demand without ex-  
ample in the intereourse between na-  
tions. By thisdemand;it ceased to be  
a question whether the French repeal  
was of sufficient extent, or was» founded  
on justifiable conditions. &#x27;The~ pled  
of the French government was doubted;  
a scrutiny was to be instistuted as to the  
manner in which it was to be discharged  
and its faith preserved, pO re ‘sttb-  
sequent conduct of its cruisers towards

the vessels of the Uniied Siates. but by a  
a copy of the orders given to its cruisers.  
Where would this end? If the French  
government intended a fraud, by its de-  
claration of repeal, announced to the mi-  
nister of the United States, and alter-  
ward to this government, might it not  
likewise commit a fraud in any other  
communication which it might make ?  
If credit was refused by the British go-  
vernment tothe act of the French go-  
vernment, thus formally announeed, is it  
robable that it would have been given  
y it, to any document of inferior charac-  
ter, directed to its own people ? Although  
it was the policy and might be the inte-  
rest of the British government toengage  
the United States in sucha controversy  
with the French government, it was far  
from comporting with their interest to do  
it. They considered it their duty to ac-  
cept the repeal already made by the  
French government, of its decress, and  
to look to its conduct and to that of its,  
cruisers, stationed by the government,  
for the faithful performance or violation  
ofit. . The U. 8, having been injured  
by both powers, were unwilliag, in their  
exertion to obtain justice of either, to be  
come the instrument of the other. “They  
were the less inclined to it in the present  
instance, from the consideration, that the  
party making the pressure on them  
maintained in full force its unlawful edicts  
  
agaifist the American commerce, while}consolation to the good pcuple of these  
  
it could not deny that a considerable ad-  
vance, at least, had been made by the  
other towards a complete accomodation,  
it being manifest to the world, not only  
that the faith ofthe French government  
stood pledged for the repeal of its de-  
crees, but that the repeal did take effect  
on the 1st of Novermber 1810, in regard  
to the United States,that several Ame-  
rican vessels taken under them had been  
delivered up, and judicial decisions | sus-  
pended on all, by its order, and that it  
also continued to give the most positive  
assurances that the repeal should be  
faithfully observed.  
  
It has also been urged that the French  
repeal was conditional, and for that rea  
son could not be accepted. This ob-  
jection has already been fully answered.  
It merits attention, however, that the  
acts of the British government relating  
to this subject, particularly the declara-  
tion of the + i 1812, and the re-  
peal of the 23d June of the same year,  
are y and in like manner condi-  
tional.  
  
is not a little sarprizing, that  
the British government should have ob-.  
jected to a measure in another govern-  
ment, to which it has itself given a  
  
sanction by its own acts. It is proper,  
however, to remark, that this object  
  
ion  
has been completely waved and given  
  
also, that it could not confide in the faith

up by the acceptance of the decree of  
the 28th April, 1811.  
  
The British government has urged  
  
fal performance by the Fiench govern-  
ment of any engagement it might enter  
into relative to the repeal of its decrees.  
This objection would be equally appli-  
cable to any other compact to be entered  
into with France. While maintained,  
it would be a bar to any treaty, even to  
a treaty of peace, between them. But  
it also has been adinitted to be unfound-  
ed by the acceptance of the decree of the  
28th April, 1811.  
  
The Secretary of State presumes that  
these facts and explanations, supported  
as they are by authentic documents,  
prove, first, that the repeat of the Bri-  
tish orders in council was not to be as-  
cribed to the French decree bearin  
date on the 28th April, 1811; an  
secondly, that in making that decree the  
basis of their repeal, the British govern-  
ment has conceded that it ought to have  
repealed them on the ground of the de  
claration of the French government of  
5th August, 1810, so asto take effect on  
the Ist November following. ‘To what  
cause the repeal of the British orders in  
council was justly attributable, cannot  
now remain a doubt with any, who have  
marked with a just discernment the  
course of events. It must afford great  
  
states,to know that they have not sub.  
mitted to privations in vain.

when war was declared they had as.  
sumed a character which dispelled al|  
prospect of accommodation. The or.  
ders in counci) were said to have been  
adopted on principle of retaliation on  
France, although at the time when  
the order of May 1806 was issued, no  
meusure of France had occured on  
which it could be retaliatory, and at the  
date of the next order, January 1807, it  
was hardly possible that this govern.  
ment should have even heard of the de.  
cree of Berlin, to which it related. It  
was stated at the time of their adoption,  
and for some time afterwards, that they  
should be revoked as soon as France  
revoked her decrees, and that the Bri.  
tish Government would proceed with  
the government of France pari passu in  
the revocation. After the revocation,  
however, of the French government of  
the 5th August, 1810, by which the  
Berlin and Milan decrees were declared  
to be repealed, the British government  
anand its tone, and continued to rise  
in its demands, to the moment that war  
was declared. It objected first that the  
French repeal was conditional, and not  
absolute ; although the only condition  
attached to it was, that G. Britain should  
follow the example, or the U. States  
fulfil their pledge by executing the non-  
importation act against her. It was  
then demanded that France should re-  
peal her internal regulations, as a condi-

ticularly that relating to impressment,

period alludedto, It was unworthy of!  
the character of the United States to  
pursue the discussion on that difference,  
when it was evident that no advantage  
could be derived from it. The right

rangement was offered, or likely to be  
obtained, respecting impressment, and  
nothing was more remote from the ex  
pectation of this government, than the  
repeal of the orders in council. ytd

the British government rendered such  
  
nations, as well as to the U. States;  
and lastly, thatthe ports ofher enemies,  
and all ports from which the British flag  
was excluded, should be opened to Bri-  
tish manufactures in American vessels ;  
conditions so extravagant as to satisly  
all dispassionate minds that they were  
demanded, not in the expectation that  
they would or could be complied with,  
but to terminate the discussion.  
  
On full consideration of all circam-  
stances, it appeared that the period had  
arrived, when it became the duty of the  
U. States to take that attitude with G.  
Britain, which was due to their violated  
rights, to the security of their most im  
portant interests, and to their character  
as an independent nation. To have  
shrunk from the crisis would have been  
to abandon every thing valuable to a  
free people. ©The surrender of our sea

States, III) notice whatever was taken of the  
Frencli decree. One of the conditions then  
contemplated was, ihat i he orders in council  
should he revived at the end of 8 months, un-  
less the conduct of (he French government &amp;  
the resnk of the commiinic.atiniis with the go-  
veinmi nt of the U. Slates should l&gt;e such as  
in theopin on .f the British government to ren-  
d&#x27; r their rcviial iinnecessai y ; a condition  
which pro es incontestably iliat the Frencli de-  
cree was not considered by the Britisli govern-  
ment a sufficient ground on winch to repeal the  
or-l.-rs in conned It proves also that on that  
day the British gove. nmcin hud resolved not to  
repeal titc orders on ihe basis of that decree ;  
8. nee t&#x27;.ie pr-iposed repeal was to depend not on  
what die French government had already done,  
hut w hat it might do, and on arrangements to  
b*&#x27; entered into w&#x27;ith tlie U. S unconnected  
with th&quot; French repeal.  
  
The French decree of the 28tb April, 1811,  
  
was transmitted to the TT. States by the AA’asp,  
a public vessel, which had been long awaiting  
at the ports of G. Britain .and France, despatch-  
es from our minister relating to these very im-  
portant concerns with both governments. It  
was received at the Department of Stale on the  
13th July, 1812, nearly a month after the Dec-  
laration of AV’ar against G Britain. Intelli-  
gence of the repeal of the orders in council  
was not received until ahmit the middle of the  
following month. It was impossible, therefore,  
that either of those acts, in whatever light!  
they might be viewed, should have been taken I  
into eonsider.ation, or have bad :uiy influence &#x27;  
in deciding on that important event. j  
  
Had the British government been disposed .  
t&gt; repeal its orders in council, in conformity |  
with the principle on which it professed to&#x27;  
have issued them, and on the condition which |  
it had itself prescribed, there was no reason  
to delay the repeal until such a decree .as that  
of the 28th .April, 1812, should be produced. —  
Tlie declaration of the French government of  
August 5, 1810, had fully satisfied every claim |  
of (he Brit sh government according to its own  
principles on that point. By it the decrees of  
Berlin and Milan were declared to be repeal-  
ed, the repeal to take effect on the 1st Novem-  
ber following, on which day it did take effect. .  
The only condition attached to it, was, either I  
that Great Britain should follow the example, |  
and repeal her orders in council, or that the  
U. States should carry into effect against her  
their non-importation act. This condition was  
in its nature subsequent, not precedent, reserv- 1  
ing a right in France to revive her decrees in |  
case neither alternative was pt-rformed. By ,  
this declaration it was put completely in the  
power of Great Britain to terminate this con-  
troversy in a manner the most honorable to j  
herself France had yielded to her the ground  
on a condition with which she had declared]  
lier willingness to comply Had she compli- 1  
ed, the non-importation act would not have j  
been carried into effect, nor could the French ;  
decrees have been revived. By refusing to  
comply, she has made herself responsible for  
all that has since followed.  
  
By the decree of the 28ih April, 1811, the  
decrees of Berlin and Milan were said to be  
definitively repealed ; and the execution of the  
non-importation act against G. Britain was de-  
clared to be the ground of that repeal. The  
repeal announced by the .declaratien of the Stli  
August, 1810, was absolute and final, except  
as to the condition subsequent attached to it.  
riiis latter decree acknowledges that that con-  
dition bad been performed, disclaims the right  
to rev ve it, in consequence of that performance,  
and, extending back to the first of November,  
confirms in every circumstance the preceding  
repeal. The latter act, therefore, as to the re-  
peal, is nothing more than a confirmation of  
the former It is in this sense that those two  
acts are to to be understood in France. It is  
in the same sense that they are to be regarded  
by other powers.  
  
In repealing the orders in council on the pre-  
text ol the F’rench decree of the 28ili April,  
1811, the British government has conceded  
that it ought to have repealed them on the de-  
claration of the 5th August, 1810. Ii is im-  
possible to di.scriminate between the two acts,  
or to separate them from each other, so as to  
justify, on sound and consistent principles, the  
repeal of the orders in council on the ground  
of one act, and the refusal to repeal them on  
(hat of the other. The second act makes the  
repeal definitive; but for what reason ? Be-  
cause the non-importation act had been put  
III force against G Britain, in compliance with  
the condition subsequent attached to the for-  
mer repeal, and her refusal to perform it. That  
art being still in fone, and the decree of the  
28th April, 1811, being expressly founded on  
It, G. Britain repeals her orders in council on  
Ihe basis of tills latter decree. The conclu-  
sion is, therefore, irresistable, that by this re-  
peal, under all the circumstances attending it,  
the British government has acknowledged the  
justice of the claim of the U. S. to a repeal on  
&#x27;he tbrmer occasion. By accepting the latter  
■epeal, it has sanctioned the preceding one ;  
u has s.anctioned also the conduct of this go-  
vernment in carrying into effect the non-  
mpoi&#x27;tatioii act against G Britain, founded on  
the preceding repeal.  
  
Other important consequences result from  
this repeal of the British government. By fair  
and obvious construction the acceptance of the  
decree of the 28lh April, 1811, as the ground  
of the repeal of the orders in council, ought to  
be cons&#x27; ru d to extend back to the IstNovem-  
her, 181o, be day on which the preceding re-  
peal took effect. The secretary of slate has  
all confidence, that if the question could be  
submitted to the judgment of an impartial ju-  
dicial tribunal, such would be its decision. He  
has equal confidence that such will be the  
judgment pronounced on it by the enlightened j  
;ind imparlud world. If, however, these two  
acts could Ih; separated from each other, so as  
that the latter might be made the basis of the  
repeal of the orders in council, distinct from  
the former, it follows that, bearing date on the  
28th April, 1811, the repeal ought to have re-  
lation to that date. In legal construction, be-  
tween nations as well as individuals, .acts are  
to lie respected fr.im the time they begin to  
operate, and where they impose a moral or po-  
litical oblig.alioi&gt; on another party, that obliga-  
tion commtiices with the commencement of  
the act.  
  
But it has been urged that the French de-  
cree was not promulgated, or made known to  
tlie British government, until a year after its  
date. 3&#x27;his objection was of no force. By ac-  
cepting an act bearing date a tear before it  
was promulgated, it is ailmiUcd that in the in-  
terval, nothing was done re|)ugnant to it. It  
cannot be presumed that any government  
would accept from another, as the basis on  
which it was to found an important measure,  
an act of anterior and remote date, pledging it-  
self to a certain course of conduct which that  
government load in the interval departed from  
and violated If any government had violated  
an act the injunctions of which it was bound to  
observe by an anterior one, in relation to a  
third party, and which it profes.sed to have ob-  
served, bclore ils acceptance by the other, it  
could not lie presumed that it would cease to  
; violate after the acceptance. The conclusion  
■ is iiTesistible, that if the otiier government  
‘did accept such act with a knowledge of its  
antecedent violation, as the foundation of any  
measure on its own part, that such act must  
have been the ostensible only, and not the real  
motive of such measure  
  
The declaratio&quot; of the Prince Regent of the  
21st April, 1811, is in full confirmation of  
! these remarks. By this act of the British go-  
  
  
  
&#x27;emment, it is lormally announced, on uie ao- u..; wo auur m me  
  
ihqrity of a report of the Secretary of Foreign in like manner conditional. It is not a 1. tile  
Aftaiis to the Conservative Senate of France, surprising, that tlie British government should

Tlie discussion of other wrongs, p&#x27;U&#x27;ticiilar-  
ly that relating to impressment, had been clo-  
sed some time before the period alluded to. It  
was unworthy of the character of the United  
Slates to pursue the discussion on that diff-t(.  
ence, when it was evident tliat no advantage&#x27;  
could be derived from it. The right was re-  
served to be brought forward and urged again,  
when it might he done with effect. In ilte  
mean time the practice of impressment was  
persevered in with vigor.  
  
At the time when war was declared againsi  
Great Britain, no satisfactory arrangemei.t Was  
offered, or likely to be obtained, respeciing im*  
preasment, and nothing was more ren.iite from  
the expectation of this government, &#x27;han the

security be given for ils performance ! Had  
there been any doubt on this subject, the con-  
duct of Great Britain herself in similar cases,  
would have completely removed it. The whole  
history of her diplomatic intercourse with  
other powers, on the subject of blockade, is  
ill accord with this proceeding of the French  
government. AVe know that when her govern-  
ment institutes a blockaue, the Secretary of  
Foreign Aft’airs announces it to the ministers  
of other powers at London , a-d that the same  
form is observed when they are revoked. Nor  
was the authenticity of either act, thus an-  
nounced, ever questioned.  
  
Had a similar declaration been made by the  
minister of F&#x27;rance in the United States to this  
government by the order of his own, would it  
not have been entitled to respect, and been res-  
pected ! By the usage of nations such respect  
could not have been withheld. The .arrange-  
ment made with Mr. Erskine is a full proof of  
the go(xl faith of this government, and of its

To the demand made by the United States  
of the repeal of the British orders in council  
founded on the basis of the French repeal, of  
August 5, 1810, the British government repli-  
ed, by demanding a copy of the orders issued  
bv the French government for carrying into  
effect that repeal, a demand without example  
in the intercourse between nations By this  
demand it ceased to be a question whether the  
Frencli repeal was of sufficient extent, or was  
founded on justifiable conditions. The pledge  
of the French government was doubted ; a  
scrutiny was to be instituted as to the manner  
in which it was to be discharged, and its faith  
preserved, not by the subsequent conduct of  
its criiizers towards the vessels of the United  
Slates but by a copy of the orders given to its  
criiizers. Where would this en(f!&gt; If the  
French government intended a fraud, by its  
declaration of repeal, announced to the minis-  
ter of live United States, and afterwards to  
this government, might it not likewise commit  
a fraud in any other communication which it  
might make? If credit was refused by the  
British government to the act of tlie F&#x27;rench  
government, thus formally announced, is it  
probable that it would have l&gt;een given by it,  
to any document of inferior character, directed  
to its&#x27; own people &gt; Although it was ihe poll-  
cy and might be the mterest of the British  
government to engage the United States in  
such a controversy with the French govern-  
ment, it was far from comporting with their  
interest to do it. — They considered it their

runistances, until at the moment when wa  
was declared they had assumed a cliaracte  
which dispelled all prospect of aecommodat ior  
The orders in council were said to have hcei  
  
although at tlie time when the orders of Ma  
1806 was issued, no measure of F&#x27;rance ha  
occurred on which it could be retaliatory, .an  
at the date of the next order, January, l&#x27;807, i  
was hardly possible that this g(?vernmcn  
should have even heard of the decree of Rei  
lin to which it related. It was stated at th  
time of their adoption, and for some time a  
terwards, that they should be revoked as soo  
as France revoked’ her decrees, and itiattb  
British government would proceed witli th  
government of F&#x27;rance pari-passu in the revi  
cation. — After the declaration, however, of th  
French government of the 5tli August 18K  
by which the Berlin and Milan decrees wei  
declared to be repealed, the British govt rr  
mfnt changed its tong, and continued to ns  
in its demands, to the moment that war wa  
declared. It objected first that the French n  
peal was conditional, and not absolute — alth(  
the only condition attached to it, was, that &lt;  
Britain should follow the example, or the I  
States fulfil their pledge by executing lfi« noi  
importation act ag.ainst ti’cr.— It was th-.n di  
manded that France should repeal her interni  
regulations, as a condition of the repeal of th  
British orders in council. — Next, that th  
French repeal should be extended to all net  
tral nations, as well as to the U. States, sii  
lastly, that the ports of her enemies, and a  
ports from which the British flag was excU  
ded should be opened to British manufacture  
in American vessels— conditions so extra vagar  
.&#x27;.s to satisfy all dispassionate minds that the  
were demanded, not in the expectation iha  
they would or could be complied with, but t  
leryninate the discussion.  
  
On full consideration of all circumstances i  
appeared that &lt;be period bad arrived, when’i  
became the duty of the United Rtatea to tak  
that attitude with Great Britain, which wa  
due to their violated rights, to the securitv c  
their most important interests, and to thei  
character as an independent nation. To hav  
shrunk from the crisis would have been t

suade the people of America, that the  
present war with England was not en-  
tered into in concert with France.—  
The following are the concluding pa-  
ragraphs:  
  
‘** It was anticipated by some, that  
a declaration of war against Great  
Britain would force the United States  
into a close connection with her ad-  
versary, much to their disadvantage.  
The Secretary of State thinks it pro-  
per to remark, that nothing is more  
remote from the fact. The discrimi-  
nation in favour of France, according  
to law, in consequence of her dccept-  
ance of the proposition made equally  
to both powers, produced a difference  
between them in that special case,  
but in that only.  
  
** The war with England was de-  
clared without any concert or com-  
munication with the French govern-  
ment; it has produced no connection  
between the United States and France,  
‘or any understanding as to its prose-  
cution, continuance, or termination.  
The ostensible relation between the  
two countries is true and only one.  
  
“The United States have just  
claims on France for spoliations on  
their commerce on the high seas, and  
in the ports of France; and their late  
minister was, and their present minis-  
ter is, instructed to demand repara-  
tion for these injuries, and to press it  
with the energy due to the justice of  
their claims, and to the character of  
the United States.”

To our last we adverted to. the enquiry then

ceived of the French Decree of April 28, 1811,  
‘was communicated by Mr. Barlow, in a letter  
of May 12, 1812, received by this department  
  
“Joly 13, following ; That the first iutimauon  
to Mr. Barlow of ihe existence of that Decree  
was given by the Duke of Bassano, in an  
informal conference on some day between  
May 1, and 10, 1812, the official commu-

Mr. Barlow&#x27;s letter, and he has repeatedly

The secretary of state reports, also, that

28, I18l1, was ever made to this government  
‘By ‘the winister of France, or other per-
