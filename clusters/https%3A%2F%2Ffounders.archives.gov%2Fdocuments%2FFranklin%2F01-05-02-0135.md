 than that of Mr. Davenants published in the year 1698. This Gentleman tells us, that he has seen a Scheme for the general Government of the Northern Colonies, which seems contrived with very good Judgement, upon which account, he says, he thought it not unreasonable to offer the heads of it to the public consideration.  
1. That the Colonies may be authorised to meet once a year, or oftner if need require, by their stated and appointed Deputies, and resolve on such measures, as shall be most adviseable at any time to take, for their public tranquility and safty.  
  
2. That in order to it Two persons well qualified for their understanding, sobriety, and substance, be appointed by such province, as their Representatives, or Deputies, which in the whole will make the Congress twinty (now 26) persons.  
3dly. That the Kings Commissioner for that purpose especially to be appointed, shoud have the Chair and preside in the said Congress.  
4thly. That they shoud meet as near as conveniently may be, to the most Central Colony, for the ease of the Deputies.  
5thly. Since that in all probability may be Newyork, both because it is near the Center of the Colonies, And for that it is the Chief Frontier, and the Governor in the Kings Nomination: That the Gov. be the Kings High Commissioner during the session, after the manner of Scotland. (Formerly)  
6thly. That their business shoud be to hear and adjust all matters of complaint, or difference between Province and Province &amp;c. as first to consider of ways and means to support the union, and Safty of these Provinces against their Common Enemies. In which Congress the Quotas of men, and charges will be much easier and more equally allotted and proportioned than it is possible for any other establishment to do. For the Provinces knowing their own condition, and one anothers can debate that Matter with more freedom, and Satisfaction, and better adjust, and ballance their affairs in all respects, for their common Safty.  
7. That in times of war the Kings High Commissioner shoud be General, or Commander in chief of the several Quota’s upon service against the Common Enemy. (And I will beg leave to add that all proceedings ought to be laid before the Parlament only.)  
  
This Constitution has some resemblance with the Court of the Amphictiones which was a kind of Council, where the General affairs of Greece were debated, which if they had preserv’d in its original purity,
