Whereas, by an act of Congress, passed on the third day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, it was provided, that so much of the several acts imposing duties in the tonnage of ships and vessels, and on goods, wares, and merchandise, imported into the United States, as imposes a discriminating duty of tonnage, between foreign vessels, and vessels of the United States, and between goods imported into the United States in foreign vessels, should be repealed, so far as the same respects the produce or manufacture of the nation to which such foreign ships or vessels may belong; such repeal to take effect in favor of any foreign nation, whenever the President of the United States should be satisfied that the discriminating or countervailing duties of such foreign nation, so far as they operated to the disadvantage of the United States, have been abolished. And whereas, it sufficiently appears, that, by an order in council of the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, dated the seventeenth day of August in the year of our Lord  
  
one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, it was provided and declared, that, from and after the said day, there should be paid, on the importation into the said kingdom, from the territories of the United States of America, in vessels of the said states, of any goods, wares, or merchandise, being of the growth, manufacture, or production, of the said territories, the same duties of customs that were payable on such goods, wares, or merchandise, when imported from the said United States in British ships, and no other or higher duties of customs: Now, be it known that I. J——M——President of the United States of America, in execution of the act of congress aforesaid, do issue this my proclamation declaring and making known, that, reconing from the said seventeenth day of August, one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, there will be due and payable, on the importation into the United States or their territories, from the said

The first treaties made by the United States, as with Sweden, in 1783,  
and France, in 1785, were on principles of equality and reciprocity, and  
in the year 1815 they passed a law repealing all discriminating duty of  
tonnage between foreign vessels and those of the United States, and of  
impost, so far as respected the produce and manufactures of the nations  
to which such foreign ships might belong; this repeal to take effect in  
favor of any foreign nation which should abolish similar duties in respect  
to the United States. In the year 1817, March Ist., they framed the  
following clause :  
  
“ Be it enacted, &amp;c. That after the 30th day of September next, no goods,  
wares or merchandise, shall be imported into the United States from any foreign  
port or place, except in vessels of the United States, or in such foreign vessels
