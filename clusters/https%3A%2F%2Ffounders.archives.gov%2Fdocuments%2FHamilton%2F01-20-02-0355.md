fficers and Tribunals in the West Indies, it is certain that the British Government almost as soon as their construction was known in England not only disclaimed it, but issued a new order dated the 8th of January 1794 revoking that of the 6th of November, and expressly restraining the power to detain and carry in vessels for adjudication to such as were laden with the produce of a French Island going from a port in the Island to a port Europe—to such as were laden with the like produce belonging to subjects of France whithersoever bound—to such as should be found attempting to enter a blockaded port—to such as were laden in whole or in part with naval or military stores bound to a French Island.  
This last order obviated in a great measure the mischief of the former; and though its principles were in some respects such as we ought never to recognise; yet were they conformable with the practice of the principal maritime powers in antecedent modern wars, especially of France &amp; Great Britain.  
These acts comprise the whole of those on which the British Spoliations have been founded. Taken with all the latitude of construction adopted by the British Officers and Courts in the West Indies they amount to this and to no more—“the seizure and appropriation of our corn flour and meal going to a French port, on the condition of paying for them—the seizure and confiscation of our vessels with their cargoes—when laden with the produce of a French Colony or in act of carrying provisions or other supplies for the use of such colony.” Our Trade with France herself except in corn flour &amp; Meal and in contraband articles has in the worst of times remained unmolested, and has even been allowed to be carried on directly from British Ports.  
Iniquitous and oppressive as were the acts of G B how very far short do they fall of the more iniquitous and oppressive decrees of France, as these have been construed and acted upon—not only by its Colonial Administrations but by some of its Tribunals in Europe. The decree of the 2d. of July 1796 purports in substance that France will treat the neutral powers as they have permitted her enemies to treat them. But under this masked battery the whole of our trade with the enemies of France has been assailed. The two Edits of her proconsuls in the West Indies

proclaim the capture of all neutral vessels bound to or coming from English Ports and the uniform consequence is confiscation of vessel and cargo. We are now likewise officially informed that a French consular Tribunal at Cadiz has condemned neutral vessels carried in there on the same broad principles.

tion of the partial injuries which neutral nations had suffered from the enemies of France were denounced—who could have dreamt that a universal war on their Trade was meditated? Who that has a spark of the American in his soul can refuse his utmost indignation as well at the manner as at the matter of this atrocious proceeding? Not only the partisans of France, the advocates for the honor of Republican Government, but the friends of human nature must desire that the final explanation may reject as a criminal abuse the practice upon that decree and repair as far as possible the mischief which it ha⟨s⟩ occasioned.  
But the Treaty with Great Britain, (still exclaim the dupes or hirelings of France) that abominable instrument is the Pandora’s box from which all our misfortunes issue—when that instrument was confirmed who could have

ike the prey of a devouring rapacity? Will ye still persist then in the barefaced imposture of ascribing to the treaty grievances which are the mere effects of a spirit of Oppression &amp; Rapine?  
Read the letter of Mr Skipwith to Mr Monroe dated at Paris the 3d of October 1794 prior to the signature of the Treaty by Mr. Jay. Remember that he is an American Agent, acting under the eye of an American Minister, and that both the Minister and the Agent are distinguished by a partiality for France which exempt them from the suspicion of exaggerating her misdeeds. What does that letter tell us? Why in express terms, that “innumerable embarrassments and difficulties had for a long time oppressed our commerce in different Ports of the Republic—that if the French Government did not soon remedy, the incessant abuses and vexations practiced dayly upon our Merchants the trade of the U States with France must cease.”  
Hence may ye learn that long before our Treaty with Great Britain the vexations of our Trade in the ports of France were so extreme as to have become intolerable; that “the indiscriminate capture of our vessels at sea by the vessels of War of the Republic”  
  
Note *This also is a passage verbatim from Mr. Skipwiths letter. And he produces a long list of cases to support his assertions.  
  
formed only one class of the injuries which our Commerce had sustained—in a word that the predatory system of France existed before the Treaty and has only of late acquired greater activity from the cravings of an exhausted Treasury.

With respect to the injuries sustained by our commerce,  
some idea of them may be formed, from Mr. Skipwith’s letter,

which the-following are extracts:

« At your request, I now lay before you, a statement of the  
innumerable embarrassments and difficulties, which our com-  
merce has, for a long time, and continues still to labor under,  
in the different ports of the French republic. It is evident, if  
their government does not soon remedy the incessant abuses  
and vexations, practised daily 4p our merchants, vessels,  
captains, and crews, the trade of the United States with France  
must cease. I can assure you, that there are near three hun-  
dred sail of American vessels now in the ports: of France, all  
of whom have suffered, or are suffering, more or less delay and  
difficulties. The hardships of which I have chiefly to com-
