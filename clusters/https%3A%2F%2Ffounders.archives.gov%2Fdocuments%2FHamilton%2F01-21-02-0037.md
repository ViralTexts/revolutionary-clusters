ffairs are so liable, they have been since much reduced and broken up. Myself at about sixteen came to this Country. Having always had a strong propensity to literary pursuits, by a course of steady and laborious exertion, I was able, by the age of Ninteen to qualify myself for the degree of Batchelor of Arts in the College of New York, and to lay a foundation, by preparatory study, for the future profession of the law.  
The American Revolution supervened. My principles led me to take part in it. At nineteen I entered into the American army as Captain of Artillery. Shortly after, I became by his invitation Aide De Camp to General Washington, in which station, I served till the commencement of that Campaign which ended with the seige of York, in Virginia, and the Capture of Cornwallis’s Army. This Campaign I made at the head of a corps of light infantry, with which I was present at the seige of York and engaged in some interesting operations.  
At the period of the peace with Great Britain, I found myself a member of Congress by appointment of the legislature of this state.  
After the peace, I settled in the City of New York in the practice of the law; and was in a very lucrative course of practice, when the derangement of our public affairs, by the feebleness of the general confederation, drew me again reluctantly into public life. I became a member of the Convention which framed the present Constitution of the U States; and having taken part in this measure, I conceived myself to be under an obligation to lend my aid towards putting the machine in some regular motion. Hence I did not hesitate to accept the offer of President Washington to undertake the office of Secretary of the Treasury.  
In that office, I met with many intrinsic difficulties, and many artificial ones proceeding from passions, not very worthy, common to human nature, and which act with peculiar force in republics. The object, however, was effected, of establishing public credit and introducing order into the finances.  
Public Office in this Country has few attractions. The pecuniary emolument is so inconsiderable as too amount to a sacrifice to any man who can employ his time with advantage in any liberal profession. The opportunity of doing good, from the jealousy of power and the spirit of faction, is too small in any station to warrant a long continuance of private sacrifices. The enterprises of party had so far succeeded as materially to weaken the necessary influence and energy of the Executive Authority, and so far diminish the power of doing good in that department as greatly to take the motives which a virtuous man might have for making sacrifices. The prospect was even bad for gratifying in future the love of Fame, if that passion was to be the spring of action.  
The Union of these motives, with the reflections of prudence in relation to a growing family, determined me as soon as my plan had attained a certain maturity to withdraw from Office. This I did by a resignation about two years since; when I resumed the profession of the law in the City of New York under every advantage I could desire.  
It is a pleasing reflection to me that since the commencement of my connection with General Washington to the present time, I have possessed a flattering share of his confidence and friendship.  
Having given you a brief sketch of my political career, I proceed to some further family details.  
In the year 1780 I married the second daughter of General Schuyler, a Gentleman of one of the best families of this Country; of large fortune and no less personal and public consequence. It is impossible to be happier than I am in a wife and I have five Children, four sons and a daughter, the eldest a son somewhat passed fifteen, who all promise well, as far as their years permit and yield me much satisfaction. Though I have been too much in public life to be wealthy, my situation is extremely comfortable and leaves me nothing to wish but a continuance of health. With this blessing, the profits of my profession and other prospects authorise an expectation of such addition to my resources as will render the eve of life, easy and agreeable; so far as may depend on this consideration.  
It is now several months since I have heared from my father who continued at the Island of St V

** I came tothis country ataboutthe age  
of 16, and having always had a {trong pro-  
penfity to literary purfuits, by a courfe of  
ffeady and laborious exertions, I was able  
at the age of 19 to qualify myfelf for the  
Degree of Batchelor of Arts, in the Col-  
Jege of New-York, and to lay a foundation  
by preparatory ftudy for the future profef.  
fion of the law. The American Revolu-  
tion fupervened. My principles led me to  
take partinit. At agI entered into the  
American army as Captain of Artillery,  
and fhortly ater [ became by his invitation  
aid-de-camp to General Weathingtor. ; in  
which fkation I ferved till the commence.  
ment oliuat Campaign, which ended with  
  
  
  
  
  
the fiege-of York Town, Virginia, and |  
  
the capture of Lord Cornwallis’s army.  
This campaign 1 made at the head of a  
corps of light infantry, with which I was  
prefent atthe fiege of York, and engaged  
in fome interefting operations. At the  
period of the peace with Great Britain, 1  
found myfelt a Member of Congrefs by  
appointment of the Legiflature of this ftate.  
After the peace I fettlec in the city of New-  
York, in the praétice of the law, and was  
in a very lucrative courfe of pra€tice,  
when the derangement of our public at-  
tairs, by the teeblenefs of the general con-  
federation drew me again selu@lantly into  
public life. I became a Member of the  
Convention which framed the prefent Con-  
flitution ofthe United States, and having  
taken part in this meafure, I conceived  
myfelt to be under an obligation to lend  
my aid towards putting the machinein mo-  
tion. HenceI did not hefitate to accept  
the offer of Prefident Wafhington, to un-  
dertake the oflice of Secretary of the Trea-  
fury. In that office I met with many in-  
trinfic difficulties, and many artificial ones  
proceeding from paffions not very worthy  
but common to Human Nature, and which  
a&amp; with peculiar force in Republics—The  
obje&amp;t, however, was effeétual of eftablith-  
ing public credit and introducing order in-  
to the finances.  
  
‘* Public office in this country has few  
attraétions, ‘The pecuniary emolument is  
fo inconfiderable as to amount to a facrifice  
to any man who can employ his time with  
advantage in any liberal profeffion. The  
opportunity of doing good, from the jeal-  
oufy ot power and the fpirit of fa€tion, is  
too {mall in any flation to warrant a long

terprifes of party had fo far fucceeded, as  
materially to weaken the neceffary influ-

ity, and fo far diminifhed the power of do-  
ing good in that department, as greatly to  
take away the motives which a virtuous  
mai might have for meking {uch facrifices.  
The profpeét was even bad, tor gratifying  
in future the love of fame, if that paffion  
wasto be the {pring of a€tion, The un-  
ion of thefe motives, with the refle€tions of  
prudence, in relation to a growing family,  
determined me as foon as my plan had at-  
tamed acertain maturity to withdraw from  
‘fice. Thisl did in the year 1795, by  
refignation, when I refumed the prot: {lion

be perused at the present moment with  
lively interest.  
“ I came to this country at about the age  
ol ir&gt;, and having always had a strong pro­  
pensity to literary pursuits, by a course of  
steady and laborious exertions, I was able  
by the age of 19 to qualify myself for the  
degree of Bachelor of Arts, in the college of  
New-York, and toluy a foundation by pre­  
paratory study for the future profession of  
the law. The American IIevolution su­  
pervened. My principles led me to take  
part in it. At 19 1 entered into the Arm:  
rirrm nrmv as Captain of artillery, and  
. shortly after 1 became by his invitation aid­  
i de-camp to Gen. Washington ; in which  
I station 1 served till the commencement ol  
j thnt campaign, which e nded with the siege  
• of York Town, Virginia, and the capture  
j of Cord Cornwiiilis’s army. This cam­  
paign 1 made at t&#x27;.ie head of a corps of  
light infantry, with which I was present at  
the siege of York, and engaged in some  
interesting operations. At the period of  
! peace with Great Britain, I found myself  
■ Member of Congress by the appointment  
| of the legislature of thi^ state. Alter the  
i peace 1 settled in the city of New-York in  
the practice of the law, and was in a very  
j lucrative course oT practice, when the de­  
rangement of our public affairs,by the fee­  
bleness of the general confederation drew  
me again reluctantly into public life. T  
became u member of the convention which  
  
1  
framed the present Constitution of the t%  
nited States, and having taken part in thir.  
measure, I conceived myself to be under  
j «n obligation to lend my aid inwards put­  
| ting the machine in motion. Hence 1 did  
I not hesitate to accept the offer of Presi­  
dent Washington, to undertake the office  
| of Secretary of tire Treasury.—In that of­  
&#x27; Ace I met with many intrinsic difficulties,  
and many artificial ones, proceeding from  
passions not very Worthy but common to  
human nature, and which act with pecu­  
liar force in republics.—The object how­  
ever, was cflcXnul of establishing public  
credit and introducing order into the fi­  
nances.  
“ Public office in this country has few  
attrations. 1 he pecuniary emolument  
is so inconsiderable as to amount to u sa­  
crifice to any man who can employ his  
time with advantage in any liberal profes­  
sion—The opportunity of doing good,  
from the jealousy of power and the spirit  
of faction, is too small in any station to  
warrant a long continuance of private sa­  
crifices. The enterprises of parly had so  
far succeeded, as materially to weaken the  
necessary influence and energy of the  
Executive Authority and so far diminished  
the power of good in that department, as  
greatly to take away the motives which  
a virtuous man might have for making  
sucli sacrifices. The prospeCf was even  
bad, for gratifying in future the love of  
fame, if that passion was to be the spring  
of action. &#x27;I lie muon ol these mo iveS,  
with the reflexions of prudence, in relati­  
on to a growing family, determined me as  
soon as my plun had attained a certain  
matnru* to withdraw from office. This  
I did .n the year 1795, by resignation,  
when timed the profession of the law  
romello&#x27;) in New-Yoik, undei every  
ad&#x27;T.nf-ge I could desire* It is a pleasing  
rcfletlioi to me, that since the commence­  
ment of my connexion with Gen. Wash­  
ington to the present time, 1 have posses­  
tTb ri finffprinm* ■ Iwifo /vf liie — .1  
  
ndship. In the year 1780, 1 married  
the second daughter of General Schuyler,  
a gentleman of one of the best families of  
this country, of large fortune, and of riu  
less peisonal and public consequence. It  
is impossible to be happier than I am in a  
wife, and I have eight children* the eldest,  
a son, somewhat passed seventeen, who  
all promise well as far as their years per  
mit, and promise me much satisfaction.  
Though I have been too much in public  
, life to be wealthy, my situation is ex­  
tremely confoitable, and leaves me noth­  
ing to wish but a continuance of health,

*¢ [| CAME to this country at about  
  
the age of 16, and having always  
bad a strong propensity to literary pur-  
suits, by a course of steady and Iabori-  
‘ous exertions, I was able, by the.age of  
19, to qualify myself for the: degree of  
Bachelor of Arts in the college of New-  
York, and to lay a foundation, by pre-  
paratory study, for the future profes-  
sion of the law. The American Revo-  
lution supervened. My principles led  
me to take part in it. At 19 I entered  
  
|} into the American army as Captain of  
  
Artillery, and shortly after I became,  
by his invitation, Aide-de-Camp to  
General Washington ; in which station  
I served till the commencement ef that  
campaign, which ended with the siege  
of*York-Town, Virginia,.and the cap-  
ture of Lord Cornwallis’s army... This  
campaign I made at the head of a corps  
of light infantry, with which I was pre-  
sent at the siege of York, and engaged  
in some interesting operations.| Atthe  
period of the peace with Great Britdig,  
  
  
  
I found myself Member of Con

by the appointment of the Legislature  
of this State. After the peace I settled  
in the city of New-York, in the prac-  
tice of the law, and was in a very lu-  
crative course of practice, when the  
derangement of our public affairs, by  
the feebleness of the general confede-  
ration, drew me again, reluCtantly, into  
public life. I became a Member of the  
Convention which framed the present  
Constitution of the United States, and  
having taken part in this measure, I  
conceived myself to be under an obliga-  
tion to lend my aid towards putting the  
machine in motion. Hence, I did not  
hesitate to accept the offer of President  
Washington, to undertake the office of  
Secretary of the Treasury.—In that  
office I met with many intrinsic difficul-  
ties, and many artificial ones proceed.  
ing from ions not very worthy,  
but common to human nature, and  
which aé€t with peculiar force in Re-  
tomer ge co object, however, was ef-  
e€tual of establishing publit credit,  
and introducing order into the finances.  
  
“ Public office in this country has  
few attractions. The pecuniary is so  
inconsiderable as. to amount to a sacri-  
fice to any tan who can employ his  
time with advantage in any liberal pro-  
fession. The opportunity of doing  
good, from the jealousy of power and  
  
_the spirit of fa€tion, is tog small in any  
  
station to warrant a long continuance  
of private sacrifices. The enterprises  
of party had so far succeeded as mate-  
rially to weaken the necessary influ-  
ence and energy of the Executive Au-  
thority, and so far diminished the pew-  
er of doing good in that department,  
as greatly to take away the motives  
which a virtuous man might have for  
making such sacrifices. The prospect  
was even bad, for gratifying in future  
the love of fame, if that jon was to  
be the spring of a€tion. The union of  
these motives, with the refle€tions of  
prudence, in relation to a growing fa-  
mily, determined me as soon as my  
plan had attained a certain maturity, to  
withdraw from office. This I did in  
  
the year 1795, by resignation, when I  
  
resumed the profession of the law, (as  
counsellor) in New-York, under eVery  
advantage I could desire. ft is a plea-  
sing ion to me, that since the  
commencement of my connexion with  
General Washington to the present  
time, I have possessed a flattering share  
  
his confidence and friendship. In  
  
e year 1780, I married the second  
daughter of General Schuyler, a gen-

in a wife, and I have eight children,  
the eldest a son, somewhat passed se-

as their years permit, and promise me  
much satisfaCtion. Though I have been  
too much in public life to be wealthy,  
my situation is extremely comfortable,  
and leaves me nothing to wish but a
