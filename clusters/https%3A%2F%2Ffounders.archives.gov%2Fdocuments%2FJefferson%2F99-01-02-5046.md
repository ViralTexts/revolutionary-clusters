Sir  
  
Washington 8th Febry. 1807.  
  
In consequence of a conversation which I had the honor to hold with you yesterday, on the Subject of Gunboats  
I venture to state my reasons for supposing them, the proper kind of Vessels, to afford the most effectual means of Defence  
and Annoyance within the Bays &amp; Rivers of the United States.  
The small draft of water enables them to take such positions, as to attack (in a measure) with impunity  
Vessels of any Size, and are enabled to approach or retire, as may best suit, to discomfit their Enemy, and protect  
themselves.  
My Residence having been always near the Chesapeake enables me to remark more particularly, on the effect of  
GunBoats, opposed to Ships, within the Capes of virginia.  
The middleground, the Horse-shoe &amp; Willoughby’s Point are proper positions, for GunBoats to take, to repel  
attempts to enter the Bay &amp; James River. York Spit affords the same advantage in preventing an entry into that River,  
&amp; near each River is a plat which affords a safe position to annoy, without fearing the near approach of large Ships.  
Ten or twelve of these Boats would probably be sufficient to compell to remove from her position, a Frigate, and so on, in  
proportion to the Size and number of the Enemys Ships. To do more than annoy would be difficult. With those Vessels a  
great number &amp; a long time would be necessary to capture a Ship of war, but few Commandors would feel secure while upon  
to the attack of an Enemy which however inferior, he could not destroy. An attempt to board might be better opposed by  
small arms, Cutlasses &amp;c and in case of the necessity of Retreat, the small Rivers adjacent &amp;c would be  
found of easy access to the Boats and inaccessible to the Enemy. I do suppose that twenty GunBoats stationed in Hampton  
Roads, and its vicinity would be sufficient to repel any predatory attack in that quarter, and be very formidable to a  
larger force. It is impossible for me to enlarge on this Subject, being incapable of estimating the force which might be  
brought in opposition to this mode of Defence. I can recollect perfectly, the manner &amp; by what means, two small Boats  
belonging to the State of Virginia, during the revolutionary war, often intercepted (almost under the Guns of large Ships)  
the Supplies which were frequently attempted to be afforded them, this was done by means of a light draft of water and  
good Sailing. They were however deficient of Heavy Cannon. The GunBoats building under my direction are so constructed as  
to sail fast and to mount one heavy Cannon (and can if necessary) mount some smaller Guns in the waist; so that they can  
be used in Attack on Privateers or Ships of war, and are competent to an employment (during Summer) on the Sea coast where  
the Inlets will generally admit them, in case of tempestus weather, or the necessity of Retreat from a superior force.   
I  
have the Honour to be With Great Respect, Sir Your most Hu Sert

mited Marcs, dared Wafhingtor, Febru­  
ary 8, 1807. ;  
Slr, Inconfzgnence of a conversation  
which I had the henor ro hold with vou  
yelterday, on the fubje@ of gun boats,  
I venture to state my rezfons for fup­  
pefing them the proper kind of vefleis  
to afford the mos effe@ual means of  
defence and annoyance withia th: bays  
and rivers of the United States.  
The {mall draft of water enables  
them to take such positions, as to at­  
tack, in a meafire with impunity, vel.  
fels of any size, and are enabled to ap­  
proach or retire as may best suit to dis  
comfit their enemy and prote&amp; theni­  
felves. ;  
My residence having been aiways  
near the Chefipeake, enables me to re­  
mark more particuiarly on the effe&amp; of  
guna boats opposed to ships within the  
capes of Virginia.  
The ggiddle ground, the Horfz Shee,  
and Wiiioughby’s point, are proper po­  
ficions for gun boats 1o take to repel  
attempts to enter the bay and James  
river. York {pit affords the fume ad­  
‘vantage in preventing an entry into  
that river, and near each river is 2 flat  
which affords a {afe position to annoy,  
without fearing the near approach of  
large thips.—Ten or twelve of these  
boats would probably be fufficient to  
compel to remove from her position, a

size and number of the enemies ships.  
To do more than annoy would be dit­  
ficult. With those veflels# great num­  
ber and a ?g time would be neceflary  
to capture.d thip of war ; but few com­  
manders Woul?feel fecuré while open  
to the attack of an enemy, which how­  
ever infexior, Hg ¢ayld not destroy. An  
attempt to board r‘lx@ht be better op­  
posed by small arms, cutlasses, . and  
in case of the peceflity of retreat, the  
small ‘rivcrs = adjacent, &amp;c, would ,be  
faund of eafly access to the boats, and  
inacceflible to the enemy. Ido sup­  
pose that twenty gun boats {tationed in  
Hampton roads and its vicinity, would  
be fufficient to repel any predatory at­  
tack in thar quarter, and be very formi-=-  
dable to a larger force. It is impofh­  
ble for me to enlarge on this subject,  
being incapable of eltimating the force  
which might be brought in opposition  
to this mode of defence. I can recol­  
le&amp; perfeétly the manner and by what  
means two {mall boats belonging to the  
state of Virginia, during the revolution­  
ary war, often intercepted, almost un­  
der the guns of large thips. the supplies  
which were frequently attempted to be  
afforded them. This was done by  
means of a light draft of water and  
good failing. They were, however, de­  
ficiént of hzavy camnon.;. The gun-boats  
building under my dire@jon are {o con­  
fruéted, as to fail ‘fﬁ&amp;’@ﬂd to mount  
‘one heavy cannon, and can if neceflary  
mount some {maller guns in the wailt,  
{o that they can be used ip attack on  
privateers or {hips of war, and are com­  
petent to an employment (during {um­  
mer) on the feacoalt where &#x27; the inlets  
‘will generally adrhit themn 1n case of

positions for gun-boats&#x27;to take to repel attempts to enter the bay and James  
river. York spit affords the same advantage in preventing an entry into that  
river, and near each river is a flat which affords a safe position to annoy,  
without fearing the near approach of large ships. Ten or twelve of these  
boats would probably be sufficient to compel te remove from her position  
a frigate, and so on in proportion to the size and number of the enemies  
ships. Todo more than annoy would be difficult. With those vessels a  
great number and a long time would be necessary to capture a ship of war ;  
  
t few commanders would feel secure while open to the attack of an ene-  
my, which, however inferiour, he could not destroy. An attempt to board  
might be better opposed by small arms, cutlasses, &amp;c. and in case of the ne-  
cessity of retreat, the small rivers adjacent, &amp;c. would be found of easy ac-  
cess to the boats, and inaccessible to the enemy. I do suppose that twenty  
gun-boats stationed in Hampton roads and its vicinity, would be sufficient  
to repel any predatory attack in that quarter, and be very formidable to a  
larger force. It is impossible for me to enlarge on this subject, being inca-  
pable of estimating the force which might be brought in opposition to this  
mode of defence. I can recollect perfectly the manner and by what means  
2 small boats belonging to the state of Virginia,during the revolutionary war,  
often intercepted, almost under the guris of large ships, the supplies which  
were frequently attempted to be afforded them. This was done by means of  
a light draught of water, and good sailing. They were,however,deficient of  
heavy cannon. The gun-boats building under my direction are so construct-  
ed, as to sail fast det to mount one heavy cannon, and can, if necessary,  
mount some smaller guns in the waist, so that they can be used in attack on  
privateers or ships of war, and are competent to an employment (during  
summer) on the sea-coast, where the inlets will generally admit them in case  
of tempestuous weather, or the necessity of retreat from a superiour force.  
  
I have the honour to be, with great respect, your obedient servant, !
