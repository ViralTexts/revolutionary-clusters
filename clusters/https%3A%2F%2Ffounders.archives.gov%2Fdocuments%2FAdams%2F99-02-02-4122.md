nt, 5th January, 1800.  
The Secretary of War respectfully requests the attention of the President of the United States, to certain measures and arrangements, which appear to him to be indispensable to the improvement of our military system, and solicits, if it shall be thought proper, that the same may be submitted to Congress.No sentiment is more just than this, that, in proportion as the circumstances and policy of a people are opposed to the maintenance of a large military force, it is important that as much perfection as possible be given to that which may at any time exist.It is not, however, enough, that the troops it may be deemed proper to maintain be rendered as perfect as possible, in form, organization, and discipline; the dignity, the character to be supported, and the safety of the country, further require that it should have military institutions, should be capable of perpetuating the art of war, and of furnishing the means for forming a new and enlarged army, fit for service, in the shortest time possible, and at the least practicable expense to the State

ssity of disciplined troops, to the defence of a country. Would it be wise or expedient in us to pursue a different course, and shut our eyes against the innumerable facts on record, in favor of their essentiality. Are we without regular troops, we may soon lose the military art; are we without engineers, not a little of the money employed on fortifications will be always hazarded, if not actually thrown away, and generals of the most consummate genius forced to capitulate in the field, whose retreat might have been covered by a fortification, or the battle decided in his favor by a happily contrived intrenchment.Since, however, it seems to be agreed, that we are not to keep on foot numerous forces, and it would be impossible, on a sudden, to extend, to every essential point, our fortifications, military science, in its various branches, ought to be cultivated with peculiar care, in proper nurseries; so that a sufficient stock may always exist, ready to be imparted and diffused to any extent, and a competent number of persons be prepared and qualified to act as engineers, and others as instructors, to additional troops, which events may successively require to be raised. This will be to substitute the elements of an army to the thing itself, and will greatly tend to enable the Government to dispense with a large body of standing forces, from the facility which it will give of procuring officers, and forming soldiers promptly in all emergencies.No sound mind, after a fair view of the subject, can doubt the essentiality of military science in time of war, any more than the moral certainty that the most pacific policy on the part of Government, and the most solemn and well observed treaties, will not preserve a country from being engaged in war more or less frequently. To avoid great evils, we must either have a respectable force always ready for service, or the means of preparing such a force with certainty and expedition. The latter, as most agreeable to the genius of our Government and nation, is the object of the following propositions.1st. A Military Academy.This object has repeatedly engaged the favorable attention of the Legislature, and some laws towards its consummation have been passed. These, however, being yet inadequate to afford the requisite instruction to officers, and others, in “the principles of war, the exercises it requires, and the sciences upon which they are founded,” the adoption of a more perfect plan is conceived to be indispensable for these purposes. With this view, the following  plan is respectfully suggested, formed upon those of institutions of a similar nature, from which the nations who have founded them derive the most decided advantages.It is proposed, that this academy shall consist of four schools: one, to be called “The Fundamental School;” another, “The School of Engineers and Artillerists;” another, “The School of Cavalry and Infantry;” and a fourth, “The School of the Navy;” and be provided with the following officer

For this purpose, a piece of ground ought to be purchased, sufficient for experiments in tactics, gunnery, and fortification. The situation upon a navigable water is also requisite, to admit of specimens of naval construction and naval exercises.It would also tend greatly to the perfection of the plan, if the academy of artillerists and engineers was situated in the neighborhood of foundries of cannon and manufactories of small arms.Barracks and other proper buildings must be erected, for the accommodation of the directors, professors, and students, and for the laboratories and other works to be carried on at the respective schools.The cadets of the army, and a certain number of young persons, destined for military and naval service, ought to study at least two years in the Fundamental School; and if destined for the corps of engineers or artillerists, or for th

lication of very moderate means, may thus avert from its bosom the most expensive and calamitous wars.In treating upon such an institution, it was encouraging to reflect, that, happily, it coincided with your uniform wish to see our country placed in a situation which would entitle the just maxims of its policy to be respected, and enable it to meet any adverse accidents it may be reserved to encounter.The measure proposed has also the high sanction of our late venerated President, whose talents and services were devoted, not to produce personal results, but to render a whole people great, flourishing, and happy.“The institution of a Military Academy,” this great man observes, in his last impressive speech, “is also recommended by cogent reasons: however pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge, for emergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character; and both would hazard its safety, or expose it to greater evils, when war could not be avoided. Besides, that war might often not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as the observance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation from the necessity of practising the rules of the military art, ought to be its care in preserving and transmitting, by proper establishments, the knowledge of that art. Whatever argument may be drawn from particular examples, superficially viewed, a thorough examination of the subject will evince that the art of war is at once comprehensive and complicated; that it demands much previous study; and that the possession of it, in its most improved and perfect state, is always of great moment to the security of a nation. This, therefore, ought to be a serious care of every government; and, for this purpose, an academy, where a regular course of instruction is given, is an obvious expedient, which different nations have successfully employed.”Will not the patriotism and good sense of our country readily consent to found an institution, at a moderate expense, recommended by such authorities, and which must produce the happiest effects? And yet, it ought not to excite surprise, if, in a season of profound peace, the minds of a general

nstructed officers and troops are to a country, what anchors are to a ship, driven by a tempest towards a rocky shore.Second. A modification of the two Regiments of Artillerists and Engineers, so as to create, instead thereof, one Regiment of Foot Artillerists, another of Horse Artillerists, and a third of Engineers.It is conceived, that the entire union of the officers of artillerists and engineers, in one corps, as in our present establishment, is not advisable. The art of fortification, and the service of artillery, though touching each other in many points, are, in the main, distinct branches, and each so comprehensive, that their separation is essential to perfection in either. This has been ascertained by long experience. Among the powers of Europe, there is not one recollected, which, at the present day, is not conscious of this truth. When any of them have attempted to unite these corps, the disadvantages which resulted were soon felt to be so momentous, as to produce conviction that each required a separate organization. Such an union was once attempted in France.According to an ordinance of the 8th of December, 1755, the artillery and engineer corps of that nation, which had been separate, were combined into one. The experiment, however, was of short duration. In 1758, the engineer corps was disjoined from the corps of artillery, and called, as before, the corps of engineers; since which time these corps have remained separate

But let it be remembered, that this corps is too essential to the success of military operations, to be hurried in its formation, or composed of other than persons qualified to discharge its high and important functions. Is authority necessary to support this truth? A general, of the first reputation as a commander, observes on this subject, in speaking to his Government of an officer, who had been killed in action, “He was the best officer of engineers, a body on which so much of the success of campaigns and the fate of a country depend, and where the least fault may be attended with the most fatal consequences.”The horse artillery being a subject that cannot fail to attract attention, it will not, it is conceived, be deemed superfluous to submit a few observations and facts, relative to its structure, advantages, and importance.The Prussians were the first who employed horse artillery, invented by the great Frederick, at a time, when the league which was formed against him, called upon his genius to multiply his resources. It was then, that the same army, transported with a celerity and precision, till then unknown in war, was seen to triumph against superior forces during the same campaign, upon opposite frontiers, to the East and to the West of his states. It was then were seen horse artillery accompanying strong advanced bodies of cavalry without embarrassing, or retarding, their rapid marches and evolutions.Horse artillery was introduced into the Austrian army during the reign of Joseph II, but it was not made a principal object, and remained in a state of imperfection. The cannoneers were transported upon the ridges of covered caissons, stuffed in the attitude of men on horseback. These carriages were called Wurst-wagen.Some attempts were made in France to introduce the horse artillery before the revolution there; the subject, however, was not well understood; the general officers, who were present at the attempt, proposed to place the cannoneers, like the Austrians, on Wursts.In 1791, Mr. Duportail, Minister of War, authorized the commandant of the division of Mity to form two companies of horse artillery. The success of this experiment was decisive, and answerable to the minister’s expectations. The officers and men were in a few weeks in a condition to manœuver with light troops.In 1792, Mr. Narbonne, who succeeded to Mr. Duportail, composed a committee of the most enlightened officers of the army, to examine and decide upon the means of improving and extending, in the French army, the use of horse artillery.As no better idea can be given of this new military arm, than what is reported of the result of this conference, the Secretary takes the liberty to introduce it.These officers resolved, as fundamental points—1. That a numerous horse artillery well served, and kept complete in cannoneers and horses, was the most certain mean to protect the evolutions of troops indifferently instructed, to support their attack with bayonets, and to render null, by positions seasonably taken and with celerity, the advantage which troops better disciplined, might confidently promise themselves from superiority in manœuvers.2. That with respect to the employment of this arm, the rules of service, instruction, &amp;c. the horse artillery ought to differ from the field artillery only, in having its pieces so managed, as to be drawn with the utmost celerity wherever they can produce the greatest effect, and in the cannoneers being able to follow their guns, and commence action as soon as they are placed.3. That to fulfil this object, it is more convenient to have the cannoneers all mounted on horses, than a part of them on wursts, because on horses they are less subject to accidents, their movement more rapid, their retreat more secure, and the replacing of horses easy.4. That without excluding any caliber, it appears pieces carrying balls of eight and twelve pounds, and howitzers, may be most advantageously employed.5. That it is unnecessary to discipline a horse artillerist in the manœuvres of cavalry; that this would be a departure, without utility, from the principal object; that it is enough for him to know to sit firm on his horse, to mount and descend quickly, and conduct him boldly; that it is not requisite to oblige him to preserve any order in following his piece, leaving it to his intelligence to learn, if he chooses, to execute the manœuvres of cavalry.6. That the manœuvre, à la prolonge, ought to be employed in every case in which it is practicable to use it. That the horses remaining attached while the pieces are firing, one gains thereby all the time which would be lost in removing or replacing the avant train, and thus one may pass fosses and rivers with the utmost celerity, and profit of positions.7. That in order to form at once a requisite number of companies of horse artillery, without weakening the artillery regiments, it is sufficient to employ for every piece two skilful cannoneers, and to draw upon the infantry for the rest.On these principles the French have organized an establishment in their armies, from which they have derived the most important advantages in most, if not all their campaigns.The decisive agency of horse artillery in offensive war was manifested in the invasion of Belgium, by General Dumouriez, at the end of his campaign in 1792. The affair of Waterloo is equally in point, as to its superiority in defensive operations.Whilst General Pichegru commanded the army of Flanders, four thousand cavalry, manœuvring with his horse artillery, sustained the immense effort of an army of thirty thousand men, supporting an artillery chiefly of a different kind, of at least triple the force of that opposed to it.Bonaparte, at the battle of Castiglione, after raising the siege of Mantua, having re-assembled several divisions of his horse artillery in a well chosen position, under General Domartin, broke, by their means, the Austrian line, and thus decided a victory upon which depended the most important consequences in his favor.It is also certain, that the horse artillery contributed not a little to gain the battle of Etlingen, where General Moreau, very inferior in cavalry, maintained, by its means, his left wing against the whole cavalry of the Arch Duke. The application of the horse artillery procured to General Hoche, upon the Rhine, in the late affair of Neuvied, like success.The Arch Duke Charles, instructed by such events, has greatly augmented and improved this arm of the Austrian army. The English, also, have lately introduced horse artillery into their service, but, it is supposed, too sparingly to derive therefrom its full effect.Can an agent, so superior in all offensive and defensive operations, and so vastly important from its nature, as well as the use made of it by other nations, be dispensed with in the composition of our army, or neglected with impunity?The author of a recent work, entitled “Précis des évènements militaires,” published in numbers at Hamburg, from which most of the aforesaid facts respecting this powerful military agent have been taken, observes, “that it is become indispensable in all armies; it can accompany almost every where cavalry; it crosses rivers and morasses impassable to foot artillery; it thunders in mass and with great rapidity upon an unexpected point of attack; turns a body of the enemy; takes him in flank or rear; can perform the service of advance posts; of artillery position; of the rear guard; and, in fine, that of a corps of reserve, from which detachments may be made as wanted: it is free from the inconvenience ascribed to foot artillery, of retarding and restraining the manœuvres and marches of troops: the French have, therefore, already confined the use of foot artillery to the service of sieges, with the exception of four pounders, which they have yet left attached to battalions.”Horse artillery would seem to be peculiarly recommended to the United States by the reflection, that all attacks on the sea-board must be made by an enemy, water borne from a distant country, who will consequently be ill provided with horses, whereas, the United States, having a knowledge of this agent, and resorting to their resources in horses, might be able to oppose a horse artillery so superior and so promptly, as to give decided advantages in attack or defence, and relieve their territory from being ravaged, or long possessed in any part of it. If the United States shall prevent an enemy from procuring the horses of the country, and shall maintain a superiority in this forcible arm, they will have little to fear from invaders, however powerful in infantry.The two regiments of artillerists and engineers, as they now stand on the establishment,

resource from which reinforcements may be drawn to supply deficiencies in the regular army, in the event of a sudden invasion, or the wasting progress of a long war.To obtain their aid, however, with celerity and order, in such cases, other provisions are necessary than are to be found at present in the laws.The act of the 28th February, 1795, authorizes the President, whenever the United States shall be invaded, or in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe, to call forth such numbers of militia of the state, or states adjoining, most convenient to the place of danger, or scene of action, as he may judge necessary to repel such invasion, and to issue his orders for the purpose to such officer or officers of the militia as he shall think proper.To give effect to this power, and enable the President to carry upon an enemy with promptitude the force nearest to, or best calculated to, annoy him, it is indispensable that he should know the number and species of militia in each county of a State, and the names and places of residence of their officers respectively.If these particulars are not precisely known to the President, at the time the force

‘Since, however, it seems to be agieed, that we are not to keep on  
foot numerous forees—and it would be impossible, on a sudden, to ex-  
tend, to every essential point, our fortifications—military science, in its  
various branches, ought to be cultivated with peculiar care, in proper  
nurseries; so that a sufficient stock may always exist, ready to be  
imparted and diffused to any extent, and a competent number of persons  
be prepared and qualified to act as engineers, and others as instructers,  
to additional troops, which events may successively require to be raised.  
This will be to substitute the elements of an army to the thing itself, and  
will greatly tend to enable the government to dispense with alarge body  
of standing forces from the facility which it will give of procuring  
officers, and forming soldiers promptly in all emergencies. . . . .

knowledge of these things in the short space his usual avocations will

The plan recommended by the secretary was not adopted  
without amendment. He recommended five schools, viz: the  
fundamental, of engineers and artillerists, of cavalry and in-  
fantry, and of the navy. His reasons were, “that the entire  
union of the officers, artillerists, and engineers, in one corps, is  
not advisable. &#x27;The art of fortification, and the service of artil-  
lery, though touching each other in many points, are, in the  
main, distinct branches, and each so comprehensive that their  
separation is essential to perfection in either. This has been  
ascertained by long experience. Such a union was once  
attempted in France: according to an ordinance of the 8th  
December, 1755, the artillery and engineer corps of that nation,  
which had been separate, were combined into one. The expe-  
riment was, however, of short duration. In 1758, the engineer  
corps was disjoined from the corps of artillery, and called, as  
before, the corps of engineers ; since which time these corps  
have remained separate.

cision, till then unknown in war, was seen to triumph  
against superior forces, during the same campaign, upon  
Opposite frontiers, to the east and west of his states. It  
was then were seen horse artillery accompanying strong  
advanced bodies of cavalry, without embarrassing or  
retarding their rapid marches and evolutions.  
  
* Horse artillery was introduced into the Austrian  
army during the reign of Joseph IL., but it was not  
made a principal object, and remained in a state of im-  
perfection. The cannoneers were transported upon the  
ridges of caissons, stuffed in the attitude of men on horse-  
back. These carriages were called Wurst-wagen.  
  
“ Some attempts were made in France to introduce  
the horse artillery before the revolution there; the sub-  
ject, however, was not well understood; the general  
officers, who were present at the attempt, proposed to  
  
lace the cannoneers, like the ustr&#x27;ians, on Wursts.  
  
_ In 1791, Mr. Duportail, Minister of War, author-  
ized the commandant of the division of Mity to form two  
companies of horse artillery. The success of this ex-  
periment was decisive, and answerable to the minister’s  
expectations. The officers and men were in a few  
‘weeks in a condition to manceuvre with light troops.  
  
“In 1792, Mr. Narbonne, who succeeded to Mr. Du-  
portail, composed:a committee of the most enlightened  
officers of the army, to examine and decide upon the  
‘means of improving and extending, in the French army,  
‘the use of horse artillery.  
  
** As no better idea can be given of this new military  
arm, than what is reported of the result of this confer-  
ence, the Secretary takes the liberty to introduce it.  
  
* These officers resolved, as fundamental points—  
  
€1, That a numerous horse artillery well served, and  
kept complete in cannoneers and horses, was the most  
certain mean to protect the evolutions of troops indiffer-  
ently instructed, to support their attack with bayonets,  
and to render null, by positions seasonably taken and  
with cclerity, the advantages which troops better disci-  
plined, might confidently promise themselves from su-  
periority in manceuvres.  
  
‘2. That with respect tothe empluyment of this arm,  
the rules of service, instruction, &amp;c. the horse artillery  
ought to differ from the field artillery only, in having  
its pieces so managed, as to be drawn with the utmost  
celerity wherever they can produce the greatest effect,  
‘and in the canmoneers being able to follow their guns,  
and to commence action as soon as they are placed.  
  
‘3. That to fulfil this object, it is more convenient to  
have the cannoneers all mounted on horses, than a part  
of them on wursts, because on horses they are less sub-  
ject to accidents, their movement more rapid, their re-  
treat more secure, and the replacing of horses easy.  
  
£4. That without excluding any caliber, it appears  
proces carrying balls of eight and twelve pounds, and  
  
owitgers, may be most advantageously employed.  
  
‘5. That it is unnecessary to discipline a horse artil-  
lerist in the manceuvres of cavalry; that this would be  
a departure, without utility, from the principal object;  
that it is enough for him to know to sit firm on his horse,  
to mount and descend quickly, and conduct him boldly;  
that it is not requisite to oblige him to preserve any  
order in following his piece, leaving it to his intelli-  
‘gence to learn, ifhe chooses, to execute the manctuvres  
of cavalry.  
  
*6. That the manoeuvre, a la prolonge, ought to be  
employed in every case in which it is practicable to use  
it. That the horses remaining attached while the pieces  
are firing, one gains thereby all the time which would  
be lost in removing or replacing the avant train, and  
  
us one may pass fosses and rivers with the utmost ce-  
  
  
  
we and profit of positions.  
  
‘7. That in order to form at once a requisite number  
of companies of horse artillery, without weakening the |  
artillery regiments, it is sufficient to employ for every |  
piece two skilful cannoneers, and to draw upon the in- |  
fantry for the rest,’  
  
“ On these principles, the French have organized an |  
establishment in their armies, from which they have de-  
rived the most important advantages in most, if not ail  
their campaigns.  
  
* The decisive agency of horse artillery in offensive  
tar was manifested in the invasion of Belgium, by Gen.  
  
  
  
Dumouriez, at the end of his campaign in 1792. The  
affair of Waterloo is equally in point, as to its superi-  
vrity in defensive operations.  
  
“ Whilst Gen. Pichegru commanded the army of Flan-  
ders, four thousand cavalry, manoeuvring with his horse  
artillery, sustained the immense effort of an army of  
thirty thousand men, supporting an artillery chiefly of  
a different kind, of at least triple the force of that op-  
posed to it.  
  
* Bonaparte, at the battle of Castighone, after rais-  
ing the siege of Mantua, having re-assembled several  
divisions of his horse artillery in a well chosen position,  
under Gen. Domartin, broke, by their means, the Aus-  
trian line, and thus decided a victory upon which de-  
pended the most important consequences 1m his favor.  
  
“It isalso certain, that the horse artillery contributed  
not a little to gain the battle of Ettingen, when Gen.  
Moreau, very inferior in cavalry, maintained, by its  
means, his left wing against the whole cavalry of the  
Arch Duke. ‘The application of the horse artillery pro-  
cured to Gen. Hoche, upon the Rhine, in the late affair  
of Neuvied, like success.  
  
“Phe Arch Duke Charles, instructed by such events,  
has greatly augmented and improved this arm of the  
Austrian army. ‘The English, also, have lately intro-  
duced horse artillery into their service, but, it is sup-  
posed, too sparingly to derive therefrom its full effect.  
  
“Can an agent, so superior in all offensive and de-  
fensive operations, and so vastly important from its na-  
ture, as well as the use made of it by other nations, be  
dispensed with in the composition of our army, or neé-  
glected with impunity?  
  
‘¢&#x27;The author of a recent Work, entitled ‘ Precis des  
evenements militaires,’ published in numbers at Hani-  
burg, from which most of the aforesaid facts respecting  
this powerful military agent have been taken, observes,  
‘that it is become indispensable in all armies; it can ac-  
company almost every where cavalry; it crosses rivers  
and morasses impassable to foot artillery; it thunders  
in mass and with great rapidity upon an unexpected  
point of attack; turns a body of the enemy; takes him  
in flank or rear; can perform the service of advance  
posts; of artillery position, of the rear guard; and, in  
fine, that of a corps of reserve, from which detachments  
may be made as wanted: it is free from the inconveni-  
ence ascribed to foot artillery, of retarding and restrain-  
ing the manceuvres and marches of troops: the French  
have, therefore, already confined the use of foot artillery  
to the service of sieges, with the exception of four-  
pounders, which they have yet left attached to batta-  
lions.’  
  
“¢ Horse artillery would seem to be peculiarly recom-  
mended to the United States by the reflection, that all  
attacks on the sea-board must be made by an enemy,  
water-borne from a distant country, who will consc-  
quently be ill provided with horses; whereas, the U.S.,  
having a knowledge of this agent, and resorting to their  
resources in horses, might be able to oppose a horse ar-  
tillery so superior and so promptly, as to give decided  
advantages in attack or defence, and relieve their terri-  
tory from being ravaged, or long possessed in any patt  
of it. Ifthe United States shall prevent an enemy from  
procuring the horses of the country, ‘and shall maintain  
a superiority in this forcible arm, they will have little  
to fear from invaders, however powerful in infantry.

« Horse artillery was introduced into the Austrian army  
  
during the reign of Joseph I[., but it was not made a prin-  
  
cipal object, and remained in a state of imperfection. The  
  
cannoneers were transported upon the ridges of caissons,  
  
stuffed in the attitude of men on horseback. These car-  
riages were called Wurst-wagen.  
  
“ Some attempts were made in France to introdace the  
  
horse artillery before the revolution there ; the subject, how-  
ever, was not well understood ; the general officers, who  
were present at the attempt, proposed to place the can-  
noneers, like the Austrians, on Wursts.  
  
“In 1791, Mr. Duportail, Minister of War, authorized the  
commandant of the division of Mity to form two compa-  
nies of horse artillery. The success of this experiment  
was decisive, and answerable to the minister’s expecta-  
tions. The officers and men were in a few weeks in a  
condition to manceuvre with light troops.  
  
“In 1792, Mr. Narbonne, who succeeded to Mr. Dupor-  
tail, composed a committee of the most enlightened officers  
of the army, to examine and decide upon the means of im-  
proving and extending, in the French army, the use of  
horse artillery.  
  
“As no better idea can be given of this new military  
arm, than what is reported of the result of this conference,  
the Secretary takes the liberty to introduce it.  
  
“ These officers resolved, as fundamental points —  
  
‘1. That a numerous horse artillery well served, and  
kept complete in canvoneers and horses, was the mosf cer-  
tain means to protect the evolutions of troops indifferently  
instructed, to support their attack with bayonets, and to  
render null, by positions seasonably taken and with celerity,  
the advantages which troops better disciplined, might confi-  
dently promise themselves from superiority in mancuvres.  
‘2. That with respect to the employment of this arm,  
the rules of service, instruction, &amp;c., the horse artillery  
ought to differ from the field artillery only, in having its  
pieces so managed, as to be drawn with the utmost celerity  
wherever they can produce the greatest effect, and in the  
cannoneers being able to follow their guns, and to com-  
mence action as soon as they are placed.  
  
‘3. That to fulfil this object, it is more convenient to  
have the cannoneers all mounted on horses, than a part of  
them on Wursts, because on horses they are less subject to  
accidents, their movement more rapid, their retreat more  
secure, and the replacing of horses easy.  
  
4. That without excluding any calibre, it appears pieces,  
carrying balls of eight and twelve pounds, and howitzers,  
may be most advantageously employed.  
  
‘5, That it is unnecessary to discipline a horse artille-  
rist in the maneuvres of cavalry ; that this would be a de-  
parture, without utility, from the principal object; that it  
is enough for him to know to sit firm on his horse, to mount  
and descend quickly, and conduct him boldly ; that it is not  
requisite to oblige him to preserve any order in following  
his piece, leaving it to his intelligence to learn, if he  
chooses, to execute the mancuvres of cavalry.  
  
‘6. That the maneuvre, a la prolonge, ought to be em-  
ployed in every case in which it is practicable to use it.  
That the horses remaining attached while the pieces are  
firing, one gains thereby all the time which would be lost  
in removing or replacing the avant train, and thus one may  
pass fosses and rivers with the utmost celerity, and profit  
of postions.  
  
‘7. That in order to form at once a requisite number of  
companies of horse artillery, without weakening the artillery  
regiments, it is sufficient toemploy for every piece two skil-  
ful cannoneers, and to draw upon the infantry for the rest.’  
  
“On these principles, the Freneh have organized an es-  
tablishment in their armies, from whichthey have derived the  
most important advantages in most, if not all their campaigns,

proportion as the circumstances and policy of a peo-|

possible be given to that which may at any time

may be deemed proper to maintain, be rendered as}  
perfect as possible in form, organization, and disci-

and the safety of the cuuntry further require, that it  
should have military institutions capable of perpetu-

forming a new and enlarged army, fit for service in  
the shortest time possible and at the least practicable

President of the United States gets the authority |  
  
to use the Army,as he hasdone in Kansas? The  
first section provides—  
  
“That whenever the United States shall be invaded, or  
be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation

United States to call forth such number of the militia of the

I presume no one will contend that under that  
clause authority is given to employ the army in  
the Territory of Kansas. The second clause of  
the first section is this:
