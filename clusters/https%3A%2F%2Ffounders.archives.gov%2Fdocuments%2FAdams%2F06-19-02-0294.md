1 April 1789]  
  
Invited to this respectable situation by the suffrages of our fellow citizens, according to the Constitution, I have thought it my duty cheerfully and readily to accept it. Unaccustomed to refuse any public service, however dangerous to my reputation, or disproportioned to my talents, it would have been inconsistent to have adopted an other maxim of conduct, at this time, when the prosperity of the country, and the liberties of the people, require perhaps, as much as ever, the attention of those who possess any share of the public confidence.  
I should be destitute of sensibility, if, upon my arrival in this city, and presentation to this Legislature, and especially to this Senate, I could see, without emotion, so many of those characters, of whose virtuous exertions I have so often been a witness—from whose countenances and examples I have ever derived encouragement and animation; whose disinterested friendship has supported me, in many intricate conjunctures of public affairs, at home and abroad: Those celebrated defenders of the liberties of this country, whom menaces could not intimidate, corruption seduce, nor flattery allure: Those intrepid assertors of the rights of mankind, whose philosophy and policy, have enlightened the world, in twenty years, more than it was ever before enlightened in many centuries, by ancient schools, or modern universities.  
I must have been inattentive to the course of events, if I were either ignorant of the fame, or insensible to the merit, of those other characters in the Senate, to whom it has been my misfortune to have been hitherto personally unknown.  
It is with satisfaction, that I congratulate the people of America on the formation of a national Constitution, and the fair prospect of a consistent administration of a government of laws. On the acquisition of an House of Representatives, chosen by themselves; of a Senate thus composed by their own State Legislatures; and on the prospect of an executive authority, in the hands of one whose portrait I shall not presume to draw— Were I blessed with powers to do justice to his character, it would be impossible to increase the confidence or affection of his country, or make the smallest addition to his glory. This can only be effected by a discharge of the present exalted trust on the same principles, with the same abilities and virtues, which  
  
have uniformly appeared in all his former conduct, public or private. May I, nevertheless, be indulged to inquire, if we look over the catalogue of the first magistrates of nations, whether they have been denominated presidents or consuls, kings or princes, where shall we find one, whose commanding talents and virtues, whose over-ruling good fortune have so completely united all hearts and voices in his favor? who enjoyed the esteem and admiration of foreign nations and fellow citizens with equal unanimity? Qualities so uncommon, are no common blessings to the country that possesses them. By those great qualities, and their benign effects, has Providence marked out the head of this nation, with an hand so distinctly visible, as to have been seen by all men, and mistaken by none.  
It is not for me to interrupt your deliberations by any general observations on the state of the nation, or by recommending, or proposing, any particular measures. It would be superfluous, to gentlemen of your great experience, to urge the necessity of order. It is only necessary to make an apology for myself. Not wholly without experience in public assemblies, I have been more accustomed to take a share in their debates, than to preside in their deliberations. It shall be my constant endeavor to behave towards every member of this most honorable body with all that consideration, delicacy, and decorum which becomes the dignity of his station and character: But, if, from inexperience, or inadvertency, any thing should ever escape me, inconsistent with propriety, I must entreat you, by imputing it to its true cause and not to any want of respect, to pardon and excuse it.  
A trust of the greatest magnitude is committed to this Legislature; and the eyes of the world are upon you Your country expects, from the results of your deliberations, in concurrence with the other branches of government, consideration abroad, and contentment at home—prosperity, order, justice, peace, and liberty: And may God Almighty’s providence assist you to answer their just expectations

NVITED to this refpettable fitu-  
ation by the fuffrages of our fel-  
  
low-citizens, according to the confti-  
tition, I have thought it my duty,  
cheerfully and readily to accept it.  
Unaccuftomed to refufe any public  
fervice, however dangerous to my  
reputation, or difproportionate to my  
talents, it would have been inconfitt-  
enttohave adopted another maxim of  
conduct, at this time, when the prof-  
perity of the country, and the liberties  
of the people, require, perhaps as  
mich as ever, the attention of thofe,  
who poffefs any fhare of the public  
confidence,  
  
_ I thould be deftitnte of fenfibility  
  
if, upon my arrival in this city, an  
  
prefentation to this legiflature, and  
efpecially to this fenate, I could fee,  
without emotion, fo many of thofe  
charatters, of whofe virtuous exer-  
tions I have fo often been a witnefs—  
rom whofe countenance and exam-  
ples I have derived encouragement  
aad animation—whofe difinierefled  
  
friendfhip has fupported me, in many  
intricate conjunctures of public af-  
fairs, at home and abroad—thofe ce-  
lebrated do fenders of the libervies of  
this country, whom menaces could  
not mtimidate, corruption feduce, nor  
flattery allure—thofe intrepid affer-  
tors of the rights of mankind, whof-  
philofophy and policy have enlighten-  
ed the world, in twenty years, more  
than it was ever before ealishtened  
in many centuries, by ancient ichouls  
or modern univerlities. :  
  
I moft have been inattentive to the  
courfe of events, if I were either ig-  
norant of the fame, or infenfible ro  
the merit of thofe other characters in  
the fenate, to whom it has. heen my  
misfortune to have been, bitherto, per-  
fonally unknown.  
  
Iris with fatisfadion, that I con-  
gratulate the people of America, on  
the formation of a national conititu-  
tion, and the fair profyettof a con-  
filent adminiftration of a government  
of laws—on the acquilition of a  
houfe of reprefentatives, chofen by  
themfelves—of a fenate, thus com-  
pofed by theirown flare leigflatures—  
and on the profpeét of an executive  
authority, in the hands of one, whole  
portrait I fhall no: prefumeto draw.  
Were I blefied wuh powers to do  
juftice to his charatier, it would be  
impoffible to increafe the coniidence  
or affeétion of his country, or make  
the fimalleft addition to his glory.  
This can only be effected by a dit-  
charge of the prefent exalted truft,  
on the fame principles, with the fame  
abilities and virtues, which have um:  
formly appeared in all his former con-  
duét, publicor private. May I, ne-  
verthelefs, be indulged to enquire, if  
we look over the catalogue of the firit  
magiitrates of nations, whether they  
have been denominated pretidents, o  
confuls, kings, or princes, where  
{ha!l we find one, whofe commanding  
talents and virtues, whofe over-reling  
good fortune, have fo completely uni-  
ted all hearts and ail voicesin his fa-  
vour—who enjoyed the elicem and ad-  
miration of foreign nations, and fellow  
citizens, with equal unanimity ? Qua-  
lities fo uncommon, are no commen  
blefling to the country, tha pofleil -s  
them. By thofe great qualities, and  
their benign effects, has providence  
marked out the head of this nation,  
  
  
  
p8o An a&amp; of the fate of Riode Ifland, &amp;c.— Anecdetes,  
  
with ahand fo diftinéily vifible, as to  
have been feen by all men, and mif-  
taken by none.  
  
It is not for me, to interrupt your  
deliberations, by any general obdferva-  
tions on the ftate of the nation, or by  
recommending, or propofing any par-  
ticular meafures, It would be fuper-  
fluous, to gentlemen of your great ex-  
  
yerience, to urge the neceflity of or-  
  
der. It is only neceffary to make an  
apology for myfelf. Not wholly with-  
out experience in public affemblies,  
I have been more accuftomed to take  
a fhare in their debates, than to pre-  
fidein their deliberations. It fhall be  
my conflant endeavour to behave to-  
wards every member of this molt ho-  
nourable body, with all that confide-  
sation, delicacy, and decorum, which  
become the dignity of his ftation and  
charafter. Butif, from inexperience,  
or inadvertency, any thing fhould ever  
efcape me, inconfiftent with propriety,  
1 mutt intreat you, by imputing it to  
its true caufe, and notto any want of  
refpeét, to pardonand excufe it.  
  
Atrultef the greateft magnitude is  
committed to this legiflature—and the  
eyes of the world areupon you. Your  
country expetts, from the sefults of  
your deliberations, im concurrence  
wuh the other branches of govern-
