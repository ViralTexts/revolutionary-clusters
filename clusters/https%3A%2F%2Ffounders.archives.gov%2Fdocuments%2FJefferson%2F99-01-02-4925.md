To the Senate and House of Representatives   
of the US.  
  
Agreeably to the request of the House of Representatives, communicated in their resolution of the 16th.  
instant, I proceed to state, under the reserve therein expressed, information recieved touching an illegal combination of  
private individuals against the peace &amp; safety of the Union, and a military expedition planned by them against the  
territories of a power in amity with the US. with the measures I have pursued for suppressing the same.  
I had, for some time, been in the constant expectation of recieving such further information as would have  
enabled me to lay before the legislature the termination, as well as the beginning, &amp; progress of this scene of  
depravity, so far as it has been acted on the Ohio &amp; it’s waters. from this the state of safety of the lower country  
might have been estimated on probable grounds. and the delay was indulged the rather, because no circumstance had yet made  
it necessary to call in the aid of the legislative functions. information, now recently communicated, has brought us  
nearly to the period contemplated. the mass of what I have recieved, in the course of these transactions, is voluminous:  
but little has been given under the sanction of an oath, so as to constitute formal &amp; legal evidence. it is chiefly in  
the form of letters, often containing such a mixture of rumors, conjectures and suspicions as renders it difficult to sift  
out the real facts, and unadviseable to hazard more than general outlines, strengthened by concurrent information, or the  
particular credibility of the relator. in this state of the evidence, delivered sometimes too under the restriction of  
private confidence, neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing names, except that of the principal actor, whose  
guilt is placed beyond question.  
Some time in the latter part of September, I recived intimations that designs were in agitation in the Western  
country, unlawful, &amp; unfriendly to the peace of the Union; and that the prime mover in these was Aaron Burr, heretofore  
distinguished by the favor of his country. the grounds of these intimations being inconclusive, the objects uncertain, &amp;  
the fidelity of that country known to be firm, the only measure taken was to urge the informants to use their best  
endeavors to get further insight into the designs &amp; proceedings of the suspected persons, and to communicate them to me.  
It was not till the latter part of October, that the object of the conspiracy began to be percieved; but still  
so blended, &amp; involved in mystery, that nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit.   in this state of uncertainty,  
as to the crime contemplated, the acts done, and the legal course to be pursued, I thought it best to send to the scene,  
where these things were principally in transaction, a person in whose integrity, understanding &amp; discretion, entire  
confidence could be reposed, with instructions to investigate the plots going on, to enter into conference (for which he  
had sufficient credentials) with the Governors &amp; all other officers, civil &amp; military, &amp;, with their aid, to do on  
the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the designs, of the Conspirators, arrest their means, bring their persons  
to punishment, and to call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprize, in which it should be found  
they were engaged. by this time it was known that many boats were under preparation, stores of provisions collecting, and  
an unusual number of suspicious characters in motion on the Ohio, &amp; it’s waters. besides dispatching the confidential  
agent to that quarter, orders were at the same time sent to the Governors of the Orleans &amp; Missisipi territories, &amp; to  
the commanders of the land &amp; naval forces thire to be on their guard against surprise, &amp; in constant readiness to  
resist any enterprise which might be attempted on the vessels, posts, or other objects under their care: and on the 8th.  
of November, instructions were forwarded to Genl. Wilkinson to hasten an accomodation with the Spanish commandant on the  
Sabine, and, as soon as that was effected, to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the Missisipi, for  
the defence of the interesting points on that river. by a letter recieved from that officer on the 25th. of Nov. but dated  
Octob. 21. we learnt that a confidential agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him, with communications, partly written  
in cypher &amp; partly oral, explaining his designs, exaggerating his resources, &amp; making such offers of emolument &amp;  
command, to engage him &amp; the army in his unlawful enterprises as he had flattered himself would be successful. the  
General, with the honour of a soldier, and fidelity of a good citizen, immediately dispatched a trusty officer to me with  
information of what had passed, proceeded to establish such an understanding with the Spanish commandant on the Sabine, as  
permitted him to withdraw his force across the Missisipi, and to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise.  
The General’s letter, which came to hand on the 25th. of Nov. as has been mentioned, &amp; some other  
information, recieved a few days earlier, when brought together, developed Burr’s general designs, different parts of which  
only had been revealed to different informants. it appeared that he contemplated two distinct objects, which might be  
carried on either jointly or separately, and either the one, or the other first as circumstances should direct. one of  
these was the severance of the union of these states by the Alleganey mountains; the other an attack on Mexico. a third  
object was provided, merely ostensible, to wit, the settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the  
Washita, claimed by a Baron Bastrop. this was to serve as the pretext for all his preparations, an allurement for such  
followers as really wished to acquire settlements in that country, and a cover under which to retreat in the event of a  
final discomfiture of both branches of his real design.  
He found at once that the attachment of the Western country to the present union was not to be shaken; that  
it’s dissolution could not be effected with the consent of it’s inhabitants, &amp; that his resources were inadequate, as yet,  
to effect it by force. he took his course then at once, determined to sieze on N. Orleans, plunder the bank there, possess  
himself of the Military &amp; Naval stores, and proceed on his expedition to Mexico: and to this object all his means &amp;  
preparations were now directed. he collected from all the quarters where himself, or his Agents, possessed influence, all  
the ardent, restless, desperate &amp; disaffected persons who were ready for any enterprize analogous to their characters.  
he seduced good and well meaning citizens, some by assurances that he possessed the confidence of the government, &amp; was  
acting under it’s secret patronage; a pretence which procured some credit from the state of our differences with Spain:  
and others by offers of land in Bastrop’s claim on the Washita.  
This was the state of my information of his proceedings about the last of November; at which time therefore  
it was first possible to take specific measures to meet them. the Proclamation of Nov. 27. two days after the reciept of  
Genl. Wilkinson’s information, was now issued. orders were dispatched to every interesting point on the Ohio and  
Missisipi, from Pittsburg to New Orleans, for the emploiment of such force, either of the regulars or of the militia, and  
of such proceedings also of the civil authorities, as might enable them to sieze on all boats &amp; stores provided for the  
enterprise, to arrest the persons concerned, &amp; to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprize. a little  
before the reciept of these orders in the state of Ohio, our confidential agent, who had been diligently employed in  
investigating the conspiracy, had acquired sufficient information to open himself to the Governor of that state, &amp; to  
apply for the immediate exertion of the authority &amp; power of the state to crush the combination. Governor Tiffin &amp; the  
Legislature, with a promptitude, an energy &amp; patriotic zeal, which entitle them to a distinguished place in the  
affection of their sister states, effected the siezure of all the boats, provisions &amp; other preparations within their  
reach; &amp; thus gave a first blow, materially disabling the enterprise in it’s outset.  
In Kentucky a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice, without sufficient evidence for his conviction,  
had produced a popular impression in his favor, and a general disbelief of his guilt. this gave him an unfortunate  
opportunity of hastening his equipments. the arrival of the Proclamation &amp; orders, &amp; the application &amp; information  
of our confidential agent, at length awakened the authorities of that state to the truth, &amp; then produced the same  
promptitude &amp; energy of which the neighboring state had set the example. under an act of their legislature of Dec. 23.  
militia was instantly ordered to different important points, &amp; measures taken for doing whatever could yet be done. some  
boats (accounts vary from five to double or treble that number) and persons (differently estimated from one to three  
hundred) had in the mean time passed the falls of Ohio, to rendezvous at the mouth of Cumberland, with others expected  
down that river.  
Not apprised till very late that any boats were building on Cumberland, the effect of the Proclamation had  
been trusted to for some time in the state of Tennissee. but on the 19th. of Dec. similar communications &amp; instructions,  
with those to the neighboring states were dispatched by express, to the Governour, and a General officer of the Western  
division of the state: and on the 23d. of Dec. our confidential agent left Frankfort for Nashville, to put into activity  
the means of that state also. but by information recieved yesterday, I learn that on the 22d. of Dec. mr Burr descended the Cumberland, with two boats, merely of accomodation, carrying, from that state, no Quota  
towards his unlawful enterprise.   whether after the arrival of the Proclamation, of the orders, or of our Agent, any  
exertion which could be made by that state, or the orders of the Governor of Kentucky for calling out the militia at the  
mouth of Cumberland, would be in time to arrest these boats, &amp; those from the falls of Ohio, is still doubtful.  
On the whole the fugitives from the Ohio, with their associates from Cumberland, or any other place in that  
quarter, cannot threaten serious danger to the city of New Orleans.  
By the same express of Dec. 19. orders were sent to the Governors of Orleans &amp; Missisipi, supplementary to  
those which had been given on the 25th. of November, to hold the militia of their territories in readiness to cooperate  
for their defence with the regular troops and armed vessels then under command of Genl. Wilkinson. great alarm indeed  
was excited at N. Orleans by the exaggerated accounts of mr Burr, disseminated through his emissaries, of the armies &amp;  
navies he was to assemble there. Genl. Wilkinson had arrived there himself on the 24th. of Nov. and had immediately put  
into activity the resources of the place for the purpose of it’s defence, and on the 10th. of Dec. he was joined by his  
troops from the Sabine. great zeal was shewn by the inhabitants generally; the merchants of the place readily agreeing to  
the most laudable exertions &amp; sacrifices for manning the armed vessels with their seamen; and the other citizens  
manifesting unequivocal fidelity to the union, &amp; a spirit of determined resistance to their expected assailants.  
Surmises have been hazarded that this enterprize is to recieve aid from certain foreign powers. but these  
surmises are without proof or probability. the wisdom of the measures sanctioned by Congress at it’s last session has  
placed us in the paths of peace and justice with the only powers with whom we had any differences: and nothing has  
happened since which makes it either their interest or ours to pursue another course. no change of measures has taken  
place on our part; none ought to take place at this time. with the one, friendly arrangement was then proposed, and the  
law, deemed necessary on failure of that, was suspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue. with the same power  
friendly arrangement is now proceeding under good expectations, and the same law, deemed necessary on failure of that, is  
still suspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue.   with the other, negociation was in like manner then  
preferred, and provisional measures only taken to meet the event of rupture. with the same power negociation is still  
preferred, &amp; provisional measures only are necessary to meet the event of rupture. while therefore we do not deflect in  
the slightest degree from the course we then assumed, and are still pursuing, with mutual consent, to restore a good  
understanding, we are not to impute to them practices as irreconcileable to interest as to good faith, and changing  
necessarily the relations of peace &amp; justice between us to those of war. these surmises are therefore to be imputed to  
the vauntings of the author of this enterprise, to multiply his partisans by magnifying the belief of his prospects &amp;  
support.  
By letters from Genl. Wilkinson of the 14th. &amp; 18th. of December, which came to hand two days after the  
date of the resolution of the House of Representatives, that is to say, on the morning of the 18th. inst. I recieved the  
important affidavit, a copy of which I now communicate, with extracts of so much of the letters as comes within the scope  
of the resolution. by these it will be seen that of three of the principal emissaries of mr Burr, whom the General had  
caused to be apprehended, one had been liberated by Habèas Corpus, and two others, being those particularly employed in  
the endeavor to corrupt the General &amp; army of the US. have been embarked by him for ports in the Atlantic states,  
probably on the consideration that an impartial trial could not be expected, during the present agitations of New Orleans,  
and that that city was not as yet a safe place of confinement. as soon as these persons shall arrive, they will be  
delivered to the custody of the law, and left to such course of trial both as to place and process, as it’s functionaries  
may direct. the presence of the highest judicial authorities, to be assembled at this place within a few days, the means  
of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings here than elsewhere and the aid of the Executive means, should the judges  
have occasion to use them, render it equally desirable, for the criminal, as for the public, that, being already removed  
from the place where they were apprehended, the first regular arrest should take place here, and the course of  
proceedings recieve here it’s  proper direction.

deration that an impartial trial could  
not be expected during the present agi­

city was not as yet a safe place of con­  
finement. As soon as these persons  
shall arrive, th -y will be delivered to  
the custody, of the law, and left to such  
course of trial, both as to place ant! pro­

The presence of the highest judicial  
authorities, to be assembled at this place  
within a tew days, the means of pursu­  
ing a sounder course of proceedings  
here than elsewhere, and the aid of the.  
l.v cutiye means, should the judges  
have occasion to use them, render it  
equally desirable for the criminal, as  
tor the public, that, being air ady re­  
moved from tiie place where they were  
first, apprehended, the first regular  
arrest should tak.es. pl*ce here, and the  
course of proceedings receive here their  
ptoper direction.

the union, and a military expedition planned  
by them again!! the territories of a power in  
amity with the United States, with the mea­  
fures 1 have puifurd for fupprrfling the fame.  
I had, for fome time, been in the conftant ex­  
pectation of receiving fueh further information  
as would have enabled me to lay hefore the lc*  
g:flature the termination, as well as the begin*  
ning, and progrefs or this Irene of depravity,  
fo far as it has been aCted on the Ohio and its  
waters. From this the Hate of fafety of the  
lower country might have been eftimated on  
probable grounds ; and the delay was indulged  
the rather, becaufe no circumftance had yet  
| made it necefTary to call in the aid of the le­  
giflative functions. Information, now recently  
communicated, has brought us nearly to the  
period contemplated. The mafs of what I have  
received, inthcconrfe of thefe tranfaCtions, is  
voluminous : but litth* has been given under the  
function of an oath, fo as&#x27; to conftitute formal  
and legal evidence. It i« chiefly in the form of  
  
ieriers, ottcn containing Inch a mixture or ru­  
mors, conjectures and fufpicious, as renders it  
difficult to fift out the real facts, and unadvifable  
to hazard more thin general outlines, ftrength­  
cned by concurrent information, or the parti­  
cular credibility of the relator. In this Hate of  
the evidence, delivered fometimes too under  
the reft rution of private confidence, neither fafe­  
ty norjuAice &quot;ill permit the &lt;&#x27;Xpofing names,  
except that ofthe principal actor, whofe guilt  
is placed beyond queAion.  
Some time in the latter part of September,  
I received intimations that defigns were in agi­  
tation in the weftern country, unlawful, and un­  
friendly to the peace of the union ; and that  
the prime mover in thefe was Aaron Burr, here­  
tofore diAinguithed by the favor of his country.  
The grounds of thefe intimations being ineon­  
clufive, the objects uncertain, and the&#x27;fidclity  
of that country known to be firm, the only mea­  
sure taken was to urge the informants to ufc  
their befi endeavors to get further infight into  
the defigns and proceedings of the fufpeCted  
perfons, and to communicate them to me.  
It was not till the latter part cf October, that  
the objects of the confpiracy began to be percei­  
ved ; but Aill fo blended, and involved in mys­  
tery, that nothing difiinCt could be tingled out  
for purfuit. In this fiate of uncertainty, as to  
the crime contemplated, tlie acts done, and the  
legal courfe ter be puifwed, I thought it btfi to  
fend to the feene, where thefe things were prin­  
cipally in tranfaction, a perfon in whofe integri­  
ty, underfianding and diferetiou, entire confi­  
dence could be repofed, with inAruCtions to in­  
vefiigatc the plots going on, to enter into con­  
ference (for which he had futficient credentials)  
with the governors and all other oAicers, civil  
and military, and, with their aid, to do on the  
fpot whatever fhould be neceflary to difeover  
the drfigns of the confpirators, arrefi their  
means, bring their perfons to puuiAiment, and  
to call out the force of the country to ftipprefs  
any unlawful enterprize, in which it fiiould be  
found they were engaged. By this time it was  
known that many boats were under preparation,  
Aores of provilious collecting, and an unufual  
number of fufpicious characters in motion on  
the Ohio, and its waters. Befides difpatching  
the confidential agent to that quarter, orders  
were at the fame time fent to the governors of  
the Orleans and MiAiffippi territories, and to  
the commanders of the land and naval forces  
there, to be on their guard againA furprize, and  
in conflict readinefs to refiA any i enterprize  
which might be attempted on the vefiels, pods,  
or umci unufi mcir care j «..vi JTi uic  
eighth of November, iuArutfions were forward­  
ed to general Wilkinfon, to haAen an accom­  
modation with the SpaniAi commandant on the  
S ‘bine, and as foon as that was eflvCled, to fall  
back with his principal force to the hither hank  
of thelMifliflippi, for the defence of the intereA­  
mg points on that river. By a letter received  
from that officer on the twenty-fifth of Novem­  
ber, but dated October twenty-firfi, we learnt  
that a confidential agent of Aaron Burr, !•*]  
  
uiHuicu iu mm, wun communication!,  
partly written in cypher, and partly oral, ex­  
plaining Ida defigns, exaggerating his refources,  
and making fuch offers of emolument and com­  
mand to engage him and the army in his unlaw­  
ful enterprizesas he had flattered himfelfwould  
he fuccefiful. The general, with the honor of  
a fohlier, and fidelity of a good citizen, imme­  
diately difpatched a trufty officer to me, with  
information of what (had pafl&#x27;ed, proceeded to  
cftalilifli fuch an undemanding with the Spanifh  
commandant on the Sabine, aj permitted him to  
withdraw his force acrofs the Miffiffippi, and  
to enter on meafuresfor oppofing the projected  
enterprizc.  
The general’s letter, which came to hand on &#x27;  
the twenty.fifth of November, as has been men­  
tioned, Sc fomc other information received a few  
days^earlier, when brought together, developed  
Burr * general defigns, different part* of which  
only had been revealed to different informants.  
It appeared that, he contemplated twodiflinfl  
objects which might be carried on either jointly  
or feparately, and either the one or the other  
firft, as circumffances fhould dirert. One of  
thefe was the ftverance of the union ofthefe  
date* by the Alleghany mountains ; the other an  
attack on Mexico. A third object was provi­  
ded, merely oftcniihlc, to wit, the fcttlement of  
a pretended purchase of a traft of country on  
the Wufhita, claimed by a baron Baftrop. This  
was to ferve as the pretext for all his preparati­  
ons, art- allurement for fuch followers as leally  
withed to acquire frttlcments in that country,  
and a cover under which to retreat in the event  
of a final difeomfiture of both branches of his  
real defign.  
He found at once that the attachment of the  
weffern country fo the prrfent union, was not  
to be ffiaktn ; that its diffolution could not be  
ciTVrted with the content of its Inhabitants, and  
tint his ref &gt;urcc3 were inadequate, as yet. to  
effi fl it by force. He took his courfc then at  
once, determined to feizr on New-Orleans,  
plunder the bank there, putTefs himfelf of the  
military and naval (lores, and proceed on his  
expedition to Mexico; and to this obiciff all  
h.s means and preparations were now dire£led.  
l b- codecled from all the qu irters where him­  
A ifor i&gt;i* agents pofTeffed influence, all the  
ardent, refllcfs, defperate, and dtfaffefled per­  
Ions who were ready for any enterprizc analo­  
pous to their characters. lie fid need good and  
v-rll meaning citizens, fome by a.Turanccs that  
he pofTeffed the confidence of the governmei t,  
and was acting under its fecret patronage ; a  
pretence which procured tame credit from the  
ffatc of our differences with Spain ; and other*  
by offers cf land in Baftrop’s claim on the  
  
wainita.  
This was the Ante of my information of his  
proceedings, about the laft of Not. at which  
:i nc, therefore, it was firft poffible to take  
fpecific meafures to meet them. The prorla­  
mat ion of November twenty.frventh, two days  
alter the receipt of general Wilkinfon’s infor­  
mation, was now iiTctcd. Orders were dif­  
pafehed to every interning point on the Ohio  
and jMifliffippi, from Pittfburg to Ncw-Orlcans,  
for the employment of f\»ch forc e, cither ol the  
regulars or of the militia, and of fuch protccd­  
alfo of ifo: \;fv?; a^ljpri.u’s^ at mifht &lt;«*.  
  
We them to fetze on all boats and ft ores pro­  
vided for tW enterprize, t&lt;&gt; at reft the ptrfonsj  
concernedf and to fupprtfs cffedmlly the!  
further progrcfi of the cntcrpr’ze. A little&#x27;  
before the receipt of thefe orders in the dale of  
Ohio, our confidential agent, who had been  
debgently employed in iuveftigating the con­  
fpiraey, iiad acquired fiifficient information to  
open himfelf to the governor of that date, and  
to apply for the immediate exertion of the  
.authority and power of the date, to erulh the  
combination. Governor Tiffin and the legifla­  
! tore, with a promptitude, an energy, and pa­  
triotic zeal, which entitle them to a dillinguifti­  
ed place in the affection of their filler date#,  
I effected the feizure of all the boats, provifions,  
and other preparations within their reach;  
and thus pave a firft blow, materially difahling  
the enterprise in its outfet.  
  
iii KUMiicky a premature attempt to bung  
Burr to jufticc, without fufficient evidence for  
his conviction, had produced .» popular im­  
prefSon in his favor, and a general dilbeiicf of  
his guilt. This gav^ him an unfortunate op­  
portunity of battening iiis equipments. The  
arrival of the proclamation and orders, and the  
application and information of our confidential  
agent, at length awakened the authorities of  
that (late to the truth, and then produced the  
fame promptitude and energy of which the  
neighboring Hate*, had fet the&quot;example. Under  
an aCt of their legislature of Dec. twenty-third,  
militia w as infianily ordered to different impor­  
tant points, r.r.J measures taken for doing what­  
ever could yet be done. Some boats (accounts  
vary from fire to double or treble that number)  
and perfotis (differently e ft i mated from one to  
three hundred) had in the mean time palled the  
falls of Ohio, to rendezvous at the mouth of  
Cumberland, with others cxpeCled down that  
river.  
Not apprized, till very late, that any boats  
were building on Cumberland, the efRCt of the  
proclamation had been trufted to for foine time  
in the ftate of Tenncflee ; but on the nineteenth  
of Dec. fimilar communications and inftruCti­  
ons, with thofe to the neighboring flutes, were  
difpitched by exprefs, to the governor, and a  
gcntr.il officer of the weftern divifiou of the  
ftate; and on the twenty-third of Dec. our con­  
fidential agent left Frankfort for Naftiville.to  
put into adivitv, the means of that ftate alfo.  
But by information received yefterday, I learn  
that on the twenty-fecond of Dec. Mr. Burr de­  
feended the Cumberland, with two boats mere­  
ly of accommodation, carrying from that ftate  
no quota towards his unlawful enterprise.  
Whether after the arrival of the proclamation,  
of the orders, or of our agent, any exertion  
which could be made by that ttate, or the or­  
ders of the governor of Kentucky for calling out  
the militia at the mouth of Cumberland, would  
be in time to arreft thefe boats, and thofe from  
the falls of Ohio, is dill doubtful.  
On the whole, the fugitives from the Ohio,  
with their aflociatcs from Cumberland, or any  
other place in that quarter, cannot threaten fe­  
rious danger to the city of New-Orleans.  
By the fame exprefs of December nineteenth,  
orders were fent to the governors of Orleans  
and Mifiifiippi, fupplementary to thofe which  
had been given on the twenty-fifth of November,  
to hold the militia of their territories in rcadi­  
nefs to co-operate for their defence with the  
regular troops and armed vefiels then under  
command of general Wilkinfon. Great alarm  
indeed was excited at New-Orleans, by the ex­  
aggerated accounts of Mr. Burr, difi&#x27;eminated  
  
inrougn nis cminarie8, oc toe armies and navies  
he was to afiemble there. General Wiikinfon  
had arrived there himftlf on the twenty-fourth  
of November, and had immediately put into  
.1-rtfuu.v.. ut Un f..‘r (tu pur­  
pofe of its defence ; and on the tenth of De­  
cember, he was joined by his troops from the  
Sabine. Great zeal was {hewn by the inhabi­  
tants generally ; the merchants of the place  
readily agreeing to the moil laudable exertions  
and facrifices for manning the armed vcficls  
with their fcamcn ; and the other citizens ma­  
mfefting unequivocal fidelity to the union, and  
a fpirit of determined refinance to thtir expefl­  
td afiailants.  
Surinifca have been hazarded that this enter­  
prize is to receive aid from certain foreign pow-1  
ers. But thefe furmifes are without proof or i  
probability. The wifdom of the meafures fane-1  
tioned by Congrefi at its lad fefiion, has placed &#x27;  
us in the paths of peace and judice, with the on- &#x27;  
ly powers with whom we had any differences: j  
and nothing has happened fince which makes it &#x27;  
either their intered or ours to purfue another  
courfe. No change of meafures has taken  
place on our part : none ought to take place at  
this time. With the one, friendly arrangement  
was then propofed, and the law, deemed ne­  
cefiary on failure of that, was fufpendtd to  
give time for a fair trial of the ifiue. With the  
fame power friendly arrangement is now pio­  
cecding, under good expeditions, and the fame  
law, deemed necefiary on failure of that, is  
dill fufpended to give time for a fair trial of the  
ifiue. With the other, negociation was in like  
manner then preferred, and provifionil men­  
fores only taken to meet the event of rupture.  
With the fame power, negociation is dill pre­  
ferred, and provifional meafures only are necef­  
fary to meet the event of rupture. While there­  
fore we do no defleft in the flighted degree  
from the courfe we then afTumed, and arc dill  
purfuing, with mutual confent, to redore a  
good underdanding, we are not to impute to  
them practices as irreconcilable to intered as to  
good faith, and changing neceflarily the rela­  
tions of peace and judice between us to thnfe  
of war. Thefe furmifes are therefore to be im­  
puted to the vauntings of the author of this cn­  
terprize to multiply his partizans by magnify­  
ing the belief of his profpdls and fupport. &#x27;  
By letters from gen. Wiikinfon, of the four­  
teenth and eighteenth of December, which  
came to hand two days after the date of the re­  
futation of the Iloufc of Reprcfentativcs, that is  
to fay, on the morning ot the eighteenth indant,  
I received the important affidavit, a copy of  
which I now communicate, with extracts of fo  
much of the letters as comes within the fcopc ,  
of the refutation. By thefe it will be feen that I  
of three of the principal emifiarics of Mr. Burr, j  
whom the general had caufed to be apprehend-1  
cd, one had been liberated by habeas corpus, j  
and two others, being thofe particularly cm-&#x27;  
ployed in the endeavor to corrupt the general !  
and army of the United States, have been cm-1  
harked by him for ports in the atlantic dates, ■  
  
probably on the conlideration that an impartial  
trial could not be expeded, during the prefent  
agitations of New-Orleans, and that that city  
was not as yet a fafe place of confinement. As  
foon as tbefe perlons (hall arrive, they will be i  
delivered to the cufiody of the law, and left to  
fuch courfe of trial both as to place and procefs,  
as its functionaries may dired. The prcfrncc  
of the htgheft judicial authorities, to be aftem­  
bled at this place within a few days, the means  
rtf purfuing a founder cotirfe of proceedings  
here than clfewhere, and the aid of the execu­  
tive means, Arnold the judges have occafiun to  
ufe them, render it equally defirablc, for the  
criminal as for the public, that, being already  
removed from the place where they were appre­  
hended, thefiift .eguiar arrelt AimiUI take pi ce  
here, and l he courtc of proceedings receive here  
its proper direction.

AGIvIcEAULY to the request of the House  
©r Representatives, communicated in their reso­  
lution of the sixteenth instant, I p.-oceed to stare,  
cinder the reserve therein expressed, information  
received touching an illegal combination ot pri­  
vate individuals against the peace and safety of  
the union, and a military expedition planned by  
them against the territories of a power in amity  
with the United Stans, with the measuies 1 hare  
pursued for suppressing the same. %

Jo would have enabled me to In/ before the le*  
rislatuitre the termination, as well ns the begin­

far as it has been acted on the Ohio and its sca­  
urs From this the state of safety of the lower  
country might have been estimated on probable  
grounds ; %nd the delay was indulged the rarher,  
becauec no circumstance had yet made it n*ces­

•o as to constitute formal and legal evtdence. It  
is chiefly in the form of letters, often con­  
taming such a mixture of rumo-s. conjectures  
and suspicions, as renders it difficult to sift out  
the real facts, and unadvisaole V &gt; hazard more  
than general outlines, strengthened by concur  
rent information, or the particular credibility of  
the relator. In this state of the evidence, deli­  
vered sometimes to*&#x27; under the restriction of pri­  
vate confidence, neither safety nor justice will  
permit the exposing names, except that of the  
principal actor, whose guilt is placed beyond  
question.  
Some time in the latter part of September, I  
received intimations that designs were in agitati  
Cii in the western coantry, unlawful, and un­  
friendly to the peace of the union ; and that the  
prime mover in these was Aaron Burr, hereto­  
fore distinguished by the favor of his country.  
The grounds ct these intimations being incon­  
clusive, the objects uncertain, and the fidelity of  
that country known to be firm, the only mea  
sure taken, was to urge the informants to use  
their best endeavors to get iurthcr insigh: into  
the designs and proceedings of the suspected per  
sons, end to communicate them tome.  
It was uot till the latter part of October, that  
The objects of the conspiracy began to be&#x27;per.  
•rived 5 but still so blended and involved in mys­  
tify that rfothing distinct could he singled out  
f. v pur. uit. In this state of uncertainty, a*  
to the oime contemplated, the acts done, and  
the itgil course to be pursued, 1 thought it best  
to 1 id to the scene, where these things were  
, principally in transaction, a person in whose in  
tegrity, understanding and discretion, entire con­  
Science could be reposed, with irtstruc&#x27;ions to in*  
* vesticaie the plots going on, to enter mtoconfcr­

with the gevnnors and all other officers civil and  
military, and with their aid. to do on the spot  
whatever should be necessary to discover the de  
signs cf the conspirators, arrest their means,  
mj bring their persons to punishment, and to ca I  
out ms force of the country to suppress any un  
lawful emerprme. in which it should be found  
they v/cre cn-peg, d. By this time it wan known  
that many boats were under preparation, starei  
of provisionscollecting, and an unusual number  
of suspicious chat octets in motion on the OhioSi  
its waters. Besides dispatching the confidential  
ag.nt 10 t&#x27;; v. qtwter, orders were at the same  
time sent to the governors of thi Orleans and  
f.-TtsVis-.ippi territories, r.nd :o the c jnmj&#x27;ideri  
of the land and naval forces there, to be or

foT the defence of the interesting points on tha  
river. By a letter received from thfr officer 01  
the twenty fifth of November, but tk.ted Oc&#x27;-o  
ber twenty-first, v/c learnt that a confidentia  
agent of Aavon Burr, had been deputed to him  
with communications, partly writ&#x27;en in cypher  
and partly oral, explaining hia designs exai”*—  
ating his resources, and making such offers o  
emolument and command, »• engage him and tlv

standing with the Spanish commandant on th&lt;  
Sabirc, na permuted him to withdraw his forci  
Kcinss the Mississippi, and to enter hit measure  
for opposing the projected enterprize  
The general&#x27;s letter, which came to hand 01  
the tsventy*fif«h of November, as has been mm  
tinned, and some otner information, received  
frw days eat Her, when brought together, devt  
loped Burr&#x27;s general designs, different parts o  
which only had been revealed to different infoi  
manta. 1» appeared that he contemplated tw  
distinct objcc s, which might be carried on e  
ther jointly or separately, and either the oner  
the other first, as circumstance* ahould direc  
Ore of these was the severance of the union •  
three scares by the Allegany mountains; the c  
ther an attack on Mcxic&#x27;. A third object wi  
provided, merely ostensible, to wit, the • nl&lt;  
ment or a pretended pu&#x27;chase of a tract of com  
try ou the Washita, claimed by a ba&gt;on Ba:.tro  
Tnia was to nerve as the pretext for1 all his pr  
parauens, an allurement fur such followers  
  
really wished to acquire settlements in that coun­  
try, and a cover under which to retreat in the «•  
vent of* final discomfiture of bath branches of  
his real design.  
He found at once that the attachment of the  
western country to the present union, was not to  
be shaken j that its dissolution could not be ef­  
fected with the consent of its inhabitants, and  
that his resources were inadequate, as yet to ef­  
fect it by force. He took his course then at  
once,.determined to seise on New Orleans, piuu:  
dcr the hank there, po$«ess himself of the mili.  
tsry and nr.val stores, and proceed on his expe­  
dition to Mexico ; and to this object all his  
means and preparations were now directed. He  
collected from all the quarters where himself or  
his agents possecsed influence, ait the ardent,  
restle*s, desperate, and disaffected persons who  
were ready for any enterprise analtgous to their  
characters. He seduced good and well meaning  
citizens, some by assurances that lie possessed  
the confidence of the government, an 4 was act.  
ing under its secret patronage ; a preiencs which  
procured some credit fr&#x27;m the state of onr dif­  
ferences with Spain ; and others by offers of  
land in Bastrop’s claim on the Washita.  
This was the state of my information of his  
proceedings, about the last of Nc/ember: at  
which time, therefore, it was first possible to  
take specific measures to meet them. The pro.  
clamation of November twcnty.seveuth, two  
days after the receipt cf general Wilkinson’s in­  
formation, was now issued. Orders were di*.  
patched to every interesting point on the Ohio  
and Mississippi, from Pittsburg to New Orleans,  
for the employment of such force, cither of the  
regulars or of the militia, and of such preceed.  
ings also of the civil authorities, as might ena.  
ble them to seize on all boats and stores provi,  
ded for the enterprize, to arrest the persons con.  
eerned, and to suppress effectually the further  
progress of the enterprise. A little before the  
receiut of these orders in the state of Ohio, our  
confidential agent, who had been diligently em.  
ployed in investigating the conspiracy, had ac.  
quired sufficient information to open himself to  
the governot of that state, and to apply for the  
immediate exertion of the authority and power  
of lie state, to crush the combination. Governor  
Tiffin and the legislature, wi:h a promptitude,  
an energy, and patriotic acal, which entitle  
them to a distinguished place in the affection of  
their sister states, effected the seizure of al! the  
boats, provisions, indother preparations wirhin  
their reach t and thus gave a first blow, mate.  
  
ns ty (ns&amp;onng me vntci p&gt;iM. na i,g&lt;Ki&gt;  
In Kentucky a premature attempt to bring  
Burr to justice, without sufficient evidence fur  
his conviction, had produced a popular impressi­  
on ir. his favor, and a general disbelief of his  
guilt This gave him an unfortunate opportuni­  
ty of hastening his equipments- The arrival of  
the proclamation and orders, and the application  
and information of our confidential agent, at  
length awakened the authorities of that state to&#x27;  
the truth, and then produced the same promp&#x27;i.  
tude and energy of which the neighboring state  
had set the example Under an act of their le­  
gislature ol December t\venty»third, militia was  
instantly ordered to d-ffsrent important points,  
and measures taken for doing whatever could  
yet be denc Some boats (accounts vary from  
five to dot-.Cle or »ic:&gt;le that number) t*rid persons  
(differently estimated from One to three hun­  
dred) had in the mean time passed the fails of  
Ohio, to rendezvous at the mouth of Cumber­  
land, with others expected down that river.  
Not apprized, till very late, that any boats  
were building on Cumberland, the effect of the  
proclamation had been trusted to for some time  
in the stale of Tennessee; but on the nineteenth  
of December similar communications and in­  
structions, with those to the .ghboring states,  
were dispatched by t xpress to the governor, and  
a general officer ol the western division of the  
state ; and on the twenty third of i)eccm»&gt;cr,  
our confidential agsnt left Frankfort for Nab­  
vil,e, to put into activity, the means of that state  
also. But by information received yesterday, I  
learn that on the twenty-second of Dec rr.btr,  
Mr Burr descended ^he Cumberland, with two  
boats merely of accommoda&#x27;ion, carrying from  
that state no quota towards his unlawful ei :er­  
prise. Whether after the arrival of the pracla­  
matisn, of the orders, or of our agent, aov ex­  
ertion which could be made by that state, or the  
orders of the governor of of Kentucky for calling  
out the militia at the mouth of Cumberland!  
would he in time to arrest these boats, and those  
from the falls of Ohio, is slid doubtful.  
On the whole, the fugitives from the Ohio,  
with their associates from Cumberland, or any  
other place in that quarter, cannot thr»aten ten­  
ons danger to the city of NewO&gt; leans.  
By the &#x27;.tmt express of December nineteenth,  
orders wtie sent to the governors of Orleans  
and Mitsidppi, supplementary to those which  
had been riven on the twenty fifth of November.  
  
to hobi the militia of &#x27;heir territories in readi­  
, ness to co-operate for their defence with the  
regular troops and armed vessels then under  
command of general Wilkinson. Great alarm  
indeed was Peered at New Orleans, by ;he ex*  
, sggerated accounts of Mr Burr, disseminated  
throng* his emissaries, of the armies and navies  
, be was to assemble there. General Wilkinson  
had arrived there him»eJf on the twenty fourth  
of November, and had immediately put into ac­  
, tivitjr the resources of the place, lor the purpose  
, of its defence t and on the tenth of December,  
. he was joined l»y his croops from the Sabine,  
f Great zeal was shewn t&gt;y the inhabitants gene­  
: raily ; the merchants of the place readily agree­  
&gt; ing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices  
, for manni ig th-: armed vessels with their tea.  
F men j and the other citizens manifesting «ne­  
&#x27; quivocal fidelity to the union,and a tpir t of Or­  
1 termtned resistance to their expected astail­  
- ants.  
• Surmises have been hazarded that this enter­  
i prize is to receive aid (rom certain foreign pow­  
i era. But these surmises are without proof or  
probability. The wisdom of the measures sane­  
i tinned by congress at its lati session, has placed  
• us in the paths of peace and justice* wirh the on  
a 1y powers with whom we had any differences i  
and nothing has happened since which makes i  
f either their interest or ours to pursua anothc:  
• course. No thahge of measures ht~ taken plac&lt;  
i on our part t none ought to take place at thi:  
time. With the one, friendly arrangement wa  
r then proposed, a id the law, deemed ne essar;  
t on failure of that, was auspended to give timl  
f for a fair trial of the fl ue. W ith the same pow  
u er friendly arrangement it now proceeding un  
t der good expectations, and the same law deeme  
;• necessary on failure of that, is still gmpended t  
»• give time for a fair trial of the is*ue Wii  
[&gt;. the other, ncgociation v as n like manner t Ik  
r- preferred, and pmvi isnal mea tire s ofthr uk  
»s to meet the evc» t of ruptu e. With the san  
  
power, negotiation is still preferred, and provi*  
atonal measures only are nccessai. to meet the  
event of rupture. While therefore we do not  
deflect in the slightest degree from the course we  
then assumed, and are still pursuing, with mutu­  
al consent, to restore a good understating, we  
are not to impute to them practices as irrecon­  
cilable to interest as to good faith, and chang­  
ing necessarily the relations of peace and justice  
between us to those of war. These surmises are  
tketefore to be imputed to the vauntings of the  
author of this enterprise t? multiply his parti­  
sans by magnifying the belief of his prospects  
and support.  
tiy letters from gen, Wilkinson, of the four­  
tJeitth and eighteenth of December, which came  
to hand two days after the date of the resoluti.  
on of the House of Representatives, that is to  
**y» °” morning of the eighteenth instant,  
I received the important affidavit, a copy of  
which I now communicate, with extracts of so  
much of the letters as comes within the scope of  
the tesolmion, By these it will be seen that of  
three of the principal emissaries of Mr. Burr,  
whom the general had caused to be apprehend­  
ed, one had been liberated by habeas corpus,  
and two others, being those particular^ employ­  
ed in the endeavor to corrupt the general and ar­  
my of the United States, have been embarked by  
him for ports in the atlantic states, probably on  
the consideration that an impartial trial could  
not he expected, during the present agitations  
of New-Orleans, and that that city was not ao  
yet a safe place of confinement. As soon as  
these persons sh^ll arrive, they will be delivered  
to the custody of the law, and left to such course  
of trial both as to place and procees, as its func­  
tionaries may direct. The presence of the high­  
est judicial authorities, to be assembled at this  
place within a few days, the means of pursuing  
a sounder course of proceedings here than else- &lt;  
v, here, and the aid of the executive means,  
should the judges have occasion to use them&#x27;, 1  
render it equally desirable, for the criminal as  
ror the public, that, being already removed from j  
the place where they were apprehended,the first i  
regular arrest should take place hire, and the  
coarse of proceedings receive here its proper di­  
rection.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of thy  
United States. , ,  
Agreeably to the request of the house of represent  
tatives, communicated in their resolution of the six­  
teenth instant, I proceed to state, under the reserve  
therein expressed, information received touching an  
illegal combination of private individuals against the  
peace and safety of the union, and a military expe­  
dition planned by them against the territories of a  
power in amity with the United States, with the  
measures I have pursued in suppressing the same.  
I had, for some time, been in the constant ex­  
pectation of receiving such further information as  
would have enabled me to lay belore the legislature  
the termination, as well as the beginning, end pro­  
gress of this scene of depravity, so far as it has been  
acted on the Ohio and its waters. From this the  
state of safety of the lower country might have  
been estimated on probable grounds ; and the delay  
was indulged the rather, because no circumstance  
bad yet mude it necessary to call in the aid of the le­  
gislative functions. Information, now recently  
communicated, has brought us neaily to the period  
contemplated. The mass of what I have received,  
in the course of these transactions, is voluminous ;  
but little ha9 been given under the sanction of an  
oath, so as to constitute formal and legal evidence.  
It is chiefly in the form of letters, often containing  
such a mixture of rumours, conjectures, and suspici­  
ons, as renders it diflicult to sift out the real facts,’  
and unadviseable to hazard more than general put*  
lines, strengthened by concurrent information, or  
the particular credibility of the relator. In th»  
state of the evidence, delivered sometimes too under  
the restriction of private confidence, neither safety  
nor justice will permit the exposing names, except  
that of the principal actor, whose guilt is placed be­  
yond question. “ . .  
  
some time in the latter part of September, ^re­  
ceived intimations that designs were m agitation in  
tfce western country, unlawful, and unfriendly to  
the &quot;peace of the union ; and that the prime mover  
in these was Aaron Burr, heretofore distinguished  
by the favour of bis country. The grounds of these  
intimations being conclusive, the objects uncertain,  
and the fidelity of that country known to be&#x27; firm,  
the only measure taken was to urge the informants  
to use their best endeavonrs to get further insight in­  
to the designs and proceedings of the suspected per­  
sons, and to communicate them to me.  
It was not till the latter part of October, that  
the objects of the conspiracy began to be perceived;  
f but still so blended, and involved m mystery, that  
nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit.—  
In this state of uncertainty, as to the crime con­  
templated, the acts done, and the legal course to be  
pursued, I thought it best to send to the scene,  
where these things were principally in transaction,  
a person in whose integrity, understanding and dis­  
cretion, entire confideuce could be reposed, with in­  
structions to investigate the plots going on, to enter  
into conference (for which he had sufiicient creden­  
tials) with the governors and all other officers, civil  
and military, and with their aid, to do on the spot  
%hatever should be necessary to discover the de­  
• signs of the conspirators, arrest their means, bring  
&#x27; their persons to punishment, and to call out the  
force of the country to suppress any unlawful enter­  
* prize, in which it should be found (bey wereengag­  
; ed. By this time it was knowD that many boats  
were under preparation, stores of provisions collect­  
&quot; ing, and an ungual number of suspicious charac­  
ters in motion on the Ohio, and its waters. Be­  
sides despatching the confidential agent to that quar­  
ter, orders were at the same time sent to the gover­  
nors of the Orleans and Mississippi territories, and  
; to the commanders of the land and naval forces  
  
there, to be on their guard against any surprize,and  
in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which  
might be attempted on the vessels, posts, or other  
objects under theif care; and on the eighth of No­  
vember,&#x27;instructions were forwarded to genosnl Wil­  
kinson, to hastctjjuf accommodation with the Spa­  
nish commandant on the Sabine, and as soon as  
thut was effected, to fallback with1 his principal  
force to the hither bank of the Mississippi, for the  
defence of the interesting points on that river. By  
a letter received from that oBicer on the 25th Nov.  
but dated October 21, we learnt that a confidential  
agent of Aaron Burr, had been deputed to him,  
with communications, partly written in cypher, and  
partly oral, explaining his designs, exaggerating  
his resources, and making such otters of emolument  
and command to engage him and the army in his  
unlawful enterprizes as lie flattered himself would be  
successful. The general, with the honor of a sol­  
dier, and fidelity of a good citizen, immediately des­  
patched a trusty officer to me, with information of  
what had passed, proceeded to establish such an  
understanding with the Spanish commandant on the  
Sabine, as permitted him to withdraw his force  
across the Mississippi, and to enter &amp;n measures  
for opposing the projected enterprize.  
The general&#x27;s letter, which came to hand on the  
twenty-fifth of November, as has been mentioned,  
and some other information received a few days ear­  
lier, when brought together, developed Burr’s ge­  
neral designs, different parts of which only had  
been revealed to different informants. It appeared  
that he contemplated two distincts objects which  
might he carried on either jointly or separately,  
and either the one or the other first, as circumstan­  
ces should direct. One of these was the severance  
of the union of these states by the Alleghany moun­  
tains,; the other an attack on Mexico. A third ob­  
jact was provided, merely ostensible, to wit, the  
settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of  
country on the Washita, claimed by a baron Bas­  
trop. This wal to serve as the pretext for all his;  
preparations, an allurerioent for such followers as  
really wished to acquire settlements iu that country,  
  
and a cover under winch to retreat in the event of a  
final discomfiture of both branches of his real design.  
He found at once that thjs* attachment of the  
western countrj^to the present union, wqs not to be  
shaken ; that its dissolution could not be effected  
with the consent of its inhabitants, and that hie re­  
sources were inadequate, as yet, to effect it by foifee,:  
He took his Course then at once, determined no  
seise on New Oileans, plunder the bank there, pos­  
sess himself of the military and maval stores, and  
proceed on hiA expedition to Mexico ; and to this  
object all his ffieans and preparations were now di­  
rected. He collected from-all the quarters where  
himselfSor hia.a^ents possessedinfluence, all the ajfe  
(lent, restless,&#x27;&#x27;desperate and disaffected persons wR  
were ready foranenterprize analogous to their cha­  
racters. lie deduced good and well meaning citi$  
zens, some by assurances that he possessed the con­  
fidence of the government, and was acting under its  
secret patronage ; a prfltence whicfT’procured some  
credit from-ihe state of our differences with Spain ;  
and others by offer* of land in Bastrop’s claim on  
the Washita.  
This was the state of my imfornratiprr of his pro­  
ceedings, about the last of No**- at Jwhich time,  
therefore, it was first possiUe tn&#x27; tike specifick mea­  
sures to meet them. Thlp’o^lamation of Novem­  
ber twenty-seventh, two alays after the receipt of  
general Wilkinson&#x27;s iaformftion, Was now issued.  
Orders were dispatched to every interesting- point  
on the Ohio and Mississippi,&#x27; from Pittsburg to  
New Orleans, for the employment of such force,  
either of the regulars or of the militia*, pud of puch  
proceedings also of the civil authorities; *s might  
enable them to seize on. all bo^tf and- stores provided  
for the enWprize, to arrest Sre persons concerned,  
and to suppress effectually the further progress, of  
the enterprize; A little before the receipt of these  
orders in the state of Ohio, our dbnfidential agent,,  
who bad been diligently employed in inveatigatutjh  
the conspiracy, had acquired sufficient information  
to open himself to the governor of that state, and  
lOt^spply f6&gt; the immediate exertion of the abthoritf  
  
ana power oi tne state, to .crush, the coaroinatmB;  
Governor Tiffin and the legislature, with-it promp­  
titude, an energy, and patriotic z&amp;l, which entitle  
them to a distinguished place in the affection of their  
sister states, effected the seizure of all the boats,  
provisions, and other preparations within thj|if  
reach; and thus gave a first blow, materially dib­  
bling the enterprise in its outsit. t  
In Kentnck/ a premature attempt to bring Burr  
to justice, without sufficient evidence for his convic­  
tion, liad produced a popular impression in bis fa­  
vour, aud a general disbelief of his {$ilt. This,  
gavc*him tui unfortunate opportunity of hastening  
his equipments. The arrival of the proclamation^  
and orders, and the application and information of  
our confidential agent, at length awakened the autho­  
rities of that state to the truth, aud then produced  
the same promptitude andenerjMf which the neigh­  
bouring state (tad sft the example. Under an act  
of their legislature of December 23, the rflilitia was  
I instantly ordered to different important points, and  
measured taken for doing whatever could yet be  
done. Some boats (accounts vary from five to dou­  
ble or treble that number) and persons (differently  
estimated from one to three hundred) had in the  
mean time passed the falls of Ohio, to rendezvous  
at the ruquth of Cumberland, with others expected  
down that river.  
Not apprised, till very late, that any boats were  
building on Cumberland, the effect of the proclama­  
tion had bceu trusted to fer some time in the state  
of Teunessee—but on the 19th of December simi­  
lar communications and instructions, with those to  
the neighbouring states, were dispatched by express  
to the governor, and a general officer of the west­  
ern division of the state ; and on the 23d Decem­  
ber our confidential agent left Frankfort for Nash­  
ville, to put into activity the means of that state  
also. But by information received yesterday I learn  
that on the 22d of December, Mr. Burr descended  
(the Cumberland, with two boats merely of accom­  
modation, carrying from that state no quota to­  
wards his unlawful enterprise. Whether after the  
arrival of the proclamation of the orders, or of oar.  
agent, any exertion which could be made by that  
state, or the orders of the governor of Kentucky  
for calling oat the militia at the mouth of Cumber­  
land, would be in time to arrest these boats, aud  
those from the falls of Ohio, is still doubtful.  
On the whole, the fugitives from the&#x27;Ohio, with  
their associates from Cumberland, or any other  
place in that,.quarter, cannot threaten serious dan­  
ger to the cjjty of &#x27;Kew-Orleans. _ ,  
  
By tbe same express of Dec. 19, orders were,  
sent to the governors of Orleans and. Mississippi,  
supplementary to those which had been given on the  
&#x27;25th of November, to bold the militia of their ter­  
ritories in readiness to co-operate for their defence  
with tbe regular troops and armed vessels then un­  
der command of gen. Wilkinson. Great alarm in­  
deed was excited at New-Orleans, by the exaggera­  
ted accounts of Mr. Burr, disseminated through  
his emissaries, of the armies and navies he was to  
assemble there. Gen. Wilkinson had arrived there  
himself on the 24th of November, and had imme­  
diately put into activity the resources of the place,  
for the purpose of its defence ; and on the 10th of  
December, he was joined by his troops from the  
Sabine. Great zeal was shewn by the inhabitants  
generally, the merchants of the place readily agree­  
ing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices for  
manning the armed vessels with their seamen ; and  
the otfer citizens manifesting unequivocal fidelity  
to the union, and a spirit of determined resistance  
to their expected assailants.  
Surmises have been hazurded that this enterprise  
is to receive aid from certain foreign powers. But  
these surmises are without proof or probability.—  
The wisdom of the measures sanctioned by congress  
at its last session, has placed us in the paths of  
peace and justice, with the only powers with whom  
we had any differences—and nothing has happened  
since which makes it either their interest or ours to  
pursue another course. No change of measures  
has taken place on our part—none ought to take  
place at this time. With the one, friendly arrange­  
ments was then proposed, and the law, deemed ne­  
cessary on failure of that, was suspended to give  
fair trial of the issue. With the other, negociation  
was in like manner then preferred, and provisional  
measures only taken to meet the event of rupture.  
With the same power, negociation is still preferred,  
and provisional measures only taken to meet the  
event of rupture.  
  
While therefore we do not deflect in the slightest  
degree from the course we then assumed, and are  
still pursuing, with mutual consent, to restore a  
good understanding, we are not to impute to them  
practices as irreconsilable to interest as to good  
faith, and changing necessarily the relations of  
peace and justice between us to those of war. These  
surmises are therefore to be imputed to the vaunt­  
iftgs of the author of this enterprise to multiply his  
,parti?ans by magnifying the belief of his prospects  
and support.  
■ By letters from gen. Wilkinson, of the 14th and  
18th of December, which came to hand two days  
alter the.date of the resolution of the house of re­  
presentatives, that is to say, on the morning of the  
11th instent, I received the important affidavit, a  
copy of which I now communicate, with extracts  
of so much of the letters as come within the scope  
of Uie resolution. By these it will be seen that of  
thresh of the principal emissaries of Mr. Burr,  
whom the general had caused to be apprehend­  
ed, one had been liberated by habeas corpus, and  
two others, being those particularly employed  
in the endeavour to corrupt the general and army of  
the United States? have been embarked by him for  
ports in the atlantick states, probably on the con­  
sideration that an impartial trial could not be ex­  
pected, during the preseut situation of N. Orleans,  
and that that city was not as yet a safe place of con­  
finement. As Soon as these persons shall arrive1,  
they will be delivered to the custdny of the law,  
and left to such course of trial both as to place  
and process, as its functionaries may direct. The  
presence of the highest judicial authorities, to be  
assembled at this place within a few days, the  
means of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings),  
here than elsewhere, and the aid of the executive  
means, should the judges have occasion to use  
them, render it equally desirable, for the criminal  
as for the publich, that being already removed from  
the place wherq they were apprehended, the first  
regular arrest should take place here, and the course  
of proceedings receive here its proper direction. &amp;

THE WEEKLY INSPECTOR.  
  
  
  
I had, for some time, been in the constant | time it was known that many boats were un-  
  
expectation of receiving such further infor-  
mation as would have enab ed me to lay be-  
fore the legis&#x27;ature the termination, as well  
as the beginning and progress, of this scene  
of depravity, so far as it bas been acted on the  
Ohio and its waters, From this the state of  
safety of the lower country might have been  
estimated on probable grounds, and the delay  
was indulged the rather, because no circum-  
stance had yet made it necessary to cali in  
the aid of the legislative functions. Informa-  
tion, now recently communicated, has brought  
us nearly to the period contemplated. The  
mass of what J] have received, in the course  
of these transactions, is voluminous: but  
little has been given under the sanction of an  
oath, so as to constitute formal and legal evi-  
dence. Itis chiefly in the form of letters,  
often containing such a mixture of rumours,  
conjectures, and suspicions, as renders it dif-  
ficult to sift out the real facts, and unadvis-  
‘able to hazard more than general outlines,  
strenghthened by concurrent information,  
or the particular credibility of the relator.  
In thi. state of the evidence, delivered some-  
times too under the restriction of private  
confidence, neither safety nor justice wil!  
permit the exposing names, except that of  
the principal actor, whose guilt is placed be-  
yond question.  
Some time in the latter part of September,  
I received intimatious that designs were in  
agitation in the western country, unlawful  
and unfriendly to the pvace of the union;  
and that the prime mover in these was Aaron  
Burr, heretofore ‘distinguished by the favour  
of his country.  
  
uncertain, and the fidelity of that country  
known to be firm, the oniy measure taken  
was to urge the informants to use their best  
endeavours to get further insight into the de-  
signs and proceedings of the suspected per-  
son, and to communicate them to me.  
  
It was not till the latter part of October,  
that the objects of the conspiracy began to be  
  
perceived ; but still so blended, aud involved | be carried on either jointly or separately,

der preparation, stores of provisiuns coilect-  
ing, and an unusual number of suspicious  
characters in motion on the Ohio, and its  
waters. Besides dispatching the eonfidential  
agent to that quarter, orders were at the  
same time sent to the govenors of the Orleans  
and Missisippi territories, and to the com-  
manders of the land and naval forces there,  
to be on their guard against surprise, and in  
constant readiness to resist any enterprise  
which might be attempted on the vessels,  
posts, or other objects under their care: and  
on the eighth of November, instructions were  
forwarded to general Wilkinson, to hasten an  
accommodation with the Spanish cominand-  
ant on the Sabine; and as soon as that was  
effected, to fail back with his principal force  
to the hither bank of the Missisippi, for the  
defence of the interesting points on that river.  
By a letter received from that officer on the  
twenty-fith of November, but dated October  
twenty-first, we learnt that a confidential  
agent of Aaron Burr, had been deputed to  
him, with communications, partly written in  
cypher, and partly oral, explaining his de-  
signs, exaggerating his resources, and making  
such offers of emolument and command, to  
engage him and the army in his unlawful  
enterprises, as he flattered himself would be  
successful. The General, with the honour of  
a soldier, and fidelity of a good citizen, imme-  
diately dispatched a trusty officer to me  
with information of what had passed, proceed-  
ed to establish such an understanding with  
the Spanish commandant on the Sabine, as  
permitted him to withdraw his force across  
the Missisippi, and to enter on measures  
fur opposing the projected enterprise.  
  
The general’s letter, which came to hand  
  
on the 25th of November, as has been men-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
tioned, and some other information received,  
a few days earlier, when brought together,  
developed Burr’s general designs, different  
parts of which only had been revealed to dif-  
ferent informants. It appeared that he con-  
templated two distinct objects, which might  
  
and either the one or the other first, as cir-  
cumstances shuuld direct. One of these was  
the severance of the union of these states  
by the Allegany mountains ; the other an at-  
tack on Mexico. A third object was provid-  
ed, merely ostensible, to wit, the settlement  
  
| of a pretended purchase of a tract of country  
  
on the Washita, claimed by a Baron Bastrop.  
This was to serve asa pretext fur all his pre-  
parations, an alluremeut to such followers as  
really wished to acquire settlements in that  
country, and a cover under which to retreat  
in the event of a final discumfiture of both  
branches of his real design.  
  
He found at once that the attachment of the  
western country te the present union, was  
not to be shaken; that its dissolution could  
not be effected with the consent of its inhab-  
itants, and that his rescources were inade-

quate, as yet, to effect it by force. He took |  
  
his course then at once, determined to seize  
  
on New-Orleans, plunder the bank there,  
  
possess himseif of the military and nava:  
  
stores, and proceed on his expedition to  
Mexico; and tothis object ail his means and  
preparations were now directed. He collected  
from all the quarters where himself or his  
agents possessed influence, all the ardent,  
rest&#x27;ess, desperate, and disaffected persons,  
who were ready for any enterprise analogous  
io their characters. He seduced good and  
well meaning citizens, some by assurances  
that he possessed the confidence of the go  
  
yernment, and was acting under its secret  
patronage ; a pretence which procured some  
credit from the state of our differences with  
Spain ; and others by offers of land in Bas-  
trop’s claim on the Washita.  
  
This was the state of my information of his  
proceedings, about the last of November; at  
which time, therefore, it was first possible to  
take specific measures to meet them. The  
proclamation of November 27th, two days  
after the receipt of Gen. Wilkinson’s infor-  
mation, was now issued. Orders were dis-  
patched to every interesting point on the  
Ohio and Missisippi, from Pittsburgh to  
New-Orieans, for ‘the employment of such  
force, either of the regulars or of the militia,  
and of such proceedings also of the civil au-  
thorities, asmight enable them to seize on all  
boats and stores provided for the enterprise,  
to arrest the persons concerned, and to sup-  
press effectually the further progress of the  
enterprise. A little before the receipt of  
these orders in the state of Ohio, our confi-  
dential agent, who had been diigently em-  
ployed in investigating the conspiracy, had  
acquired sufficient information to open him-  
self to the governor of that state, and to ap-  
ply for the immediate exertion of the autho-  
rity and power of the state, to crush the com-  
bination. Governor Tiffin and the legisla-  
ture, with a promptitude, an energy, and  
patriotic zeal, which entitle them to adis-  
tinguished place in the affection of their sister  
states, effected the seizure of all the boats,  
provisions, and other preparations within  
their reach, and thus gave a first biow, mate-  
riaily disabling the enterprise in its outset.  
  
{nu Kentucky a premature attempt to bring  
Burr to justice without sufficient evidence for  
his conviction, had produced a popular im-  
pressivn in his favour, and a general disbelief  
of his guilt. This gave him an unfortunate  
opportunity of hastening his equipments.—  
The arrival of the proclamation and orders,  
and the application and information of our  
confidential agent, at length awakened the  
authorities of that state to the truth, andthen  
produced the same promptitude and energy  
of which the neighboring state had set the ex-  
ample. Under an act of their legislature of  
December 23d, militia was instantly order-  
ed to different important points, and mea-  
sures taken for doing hatever could yet be  
  
  
  
done. Some boats (accounts vary from five  
to double or trebie that number) and persons  
(differently estimated from one to three bun-  
dred) had in the mean time passed the ialls of  
Ohio, to rendezvous at the mouth of Cumber-  
land, with others expected down that river,  
Nut apprized, till very late, that any boats  
were building on Cumberland, the effect of  
the proclamation had been trusted to fur some  
time in the state of Tennessee; but on the  
19th of December similar communications  
and instructions, with those to neighbouring  
states, were dispatched by express, to the  
governor, and a general officer of the wes-  
tern division of the state: andon the 23d  
uf Dec. our confidential agent left Frankfort  
for Nashville, to put into activity, the means  
of that state also. But jby information re-  
ceived yesterday, I learn thaton the 22nd  
of December, Mr. Burr descended the Cum-  
berland, with two boats merely of accommo-  
dation, carrying from that state no quota  
towards his unlawful enterprise. Whether  
after the arrival of the proclamation of the  
orders, or of our agent, any exertion which  
could be made by that state, or the orders  
of the governor of Kentucky for calling out  
the militia at the mouth of Cumberland,  
would be in time to arrest these boats, and  
those from the falls of Ohio, is still doubtful.  
  
On the whole, the fugitives from the Ohio,  
with their associates from Cumberland, or  
any other place in that quarter, cannot  
threaten serious danger to the city of New-  
Orleans.  
  
By the same express of December 19th,  
orders were sent to the governors of Orleans  
and Missisippi, supplementary to those  
which had been given on the 25th of Novem-  
ber, to hold the militia of their territory in  
readiness to co-operate for their defence with  
the regular troops and armed vessels then un-  
der command of General Wilkinson. Great  
alarm indeed wasexcited at New-Orleans, by  
the exaggerated accounts of Mr. Burr, disse-  
minated through his emissaries, of the armies  
and navies he was to assemble there. Gene-  
ral Wilkinson had arrived there on the 24th  
of November, and had immediately put into  
activity the resources of that place, for the  
purpose of its defence :—and on the 10th of  
December, he was joined by his troops from  
the Sabine. Great zeal was showed by the  
inhabitants generally ; the merchants of the  
piace readily agreeing to the most laudable  
exertions and sacrifices for manning the arm-  
ed vessels with their seamen, and the other  
citizens manifesting unequivocal fidelity to  
the union, anda spirit of determined resist-  
ance to their expected assuilants,  
  
Surmises have been hazarded that this en-  
terprise is to receive aid from certain foreign  
powers. But these surmises are without proof  
or probability. The wisdom of the measures  
sanctioned by Congress at its last session, has  
placed us in the paths ot peace and justice,

differences; and nothing has happened since  
which makes it either their interest or ours,  
to pursue another course. No change of mea-  
sures has taken place on our part ; none ought  
to take place at this time. With the one,  
friendly arrangemeut was then proposed, and  
the law deemed necessary on failure of that  
was suspended, to give time for a fair trial of  
the issue. With the same power, friendly  
  
arrangement is now proceeding, under good  
  
expectations, and the same law, deemed ne-  
cessary on failure of that, is still suspended,  
to give time for a fair trial of the issue. With  
the other, negociation was in like manner  
then preferred, and provisional measures on  
lytaken to meet the event ofa rupture. While,  
therefore, we do not deflect in the slightest  
degree from the course we then assumed, and  
are still pursuing, with mutuai consent, to  
restore a good understanding, we are not to  
impute to them practices as irreconcileable  
to interest as to good faith, and changing ne-  
cessarily the relations of peace and justice  
between us, tothose of war. These surmi-  
ses are, therefore, to be imputed to the  
vauntings of the author of this enterprise, to  
multiply his partizans, by magnifying the  
belief of his prospects and support.  
  
By letters from General Wilkinson, of the  
14th and 18th of December, which came to  
hand two days after the date of the resolution  
of the House of Representatives, that is to  
say, on the morning of the 18th instant, I  
received the important affidavit, a copy of  
which I now communicate, with extracts of  
so much of the letters as comes within the  
scope of the resolution. By these it will be  
seen, that three of the principal emi-saries of  
Mr. Burr, whom the General had caused to  
be apprehended, one had been liberated by  
habeas corpus, and two others, being those  
particuiariy employed in the endeavour to  
corrupt the general and army of the United  
States, have been embarked by bim for ports  
in the Atlantic states, probably on the con-  
sideration, that an impartial trial could not  
be expected, during the present agitations  
of New-Orleans, and that that city was not  
as yet a safe place of confinemeut. Assoon  
as these persons shall arrive, they will be  
delivered to the custody of the law, and ieft  
to such course ofthe trial, both as to place,  
and process, as its functionaries may direct.  
The presence of the highest judicial authori-  
ties, to be assembied at this place within a  
few days, the means of pursuing a sounder  
course of proceedings here than elsewhere,  
and the a:d of the executive means, should  
the judges have occasion to use them, ren-  
der it equally desireable for the criminal! and  
the public, that, being already removed from  
the place where they were apprehended, the  
first reguiar arrest should take place here,  
and the course of proceedings receive here  
its proper direction.

To the Senate, and  
House of Representatives, Ec.  
AGREEABLE to the request of the  
House of Representatives, communicated  
in their resolution of the 16th inst. 1 pro­  
ceed 1o slate under the reserve therein ex­  
prefied, information received touching an  
illegal combination of private individsals  
against the peace and fafety of the upion,  
end a military expedition planned by them  
againfl the territories of a 3 power in amity  
with the U. States, with the measures I have  
pursued for suppressing the fame.  
i I had, for some time, been in the constant  
g expeflation of receiving such further infor­  
| mation as would have enabled me to lay be­  
| fore the legislature the termination, as well  
a 8 the begirning and progrefls of this scene  
. of depravity, so far as it has been aßled on  
~ the Ohio and its waters. From this the  
~ slate of fafety of the lower couutry might  
~ bave been estimated on probable grounds,  
- and the delay was indulged the rather, be­  
~ caule no circumflance bad yet made it ne­  
- ceflary 10 call in the aid of the legislative  
~ funélions. Information now recently com­  
‘municated, has brought us nearly to the pe­  
riod contemplated.: The mals of what I  
bave received in the course of these tranf­  
alions is volaminovs : but little has been  
given under the {anélion of an oath, so as.to  
conflitute formal and legal evidence. Itis  
chiefly in the form of lectérs, ofien contain­  
ing {och a mixture of ramcurs, conjeflores  
and suspicions, as render it difficalt 1o fift  
_cat the real falls, and unadvifeable to hazard  
more than general outlines, ft:engthened by  
concurrent information, or the particolar  
credibility of the relator. In this slate of  
the evidence, delivered sometimes too uo­  
der the reftriftion of private confidence,  
neitber {afety nor justice will permit the  
exposing names, except that of the principal  
aétor, whole guilt is placed beyond question,  
Some time in the latier part of Septem­  
ber, I received intimations that designs were  
in agitation in the Weflern country, unlaw­  
-ful and unfriendly to the peace of the union;  
and that the prime moverio the(e was Aaron  
Bure, heretofore distinguished by the favor  
“of his country. - The grounds of these inti­  
mations being inconclofive, the objels un.  
‘certain, and the fidelity of that country  
  
known to be firm,* the otﬂ} measure  
- taken was to mgel‘the’wﬁmnts to  
i use their best indeavt fursher  
insight into the defignsand proceed­  
ings of the fulpected perions, and to  
communicate thdm to me.  
| It was not till the latter part of Oc.-  
tober that the objedts of the conspiracy  
began to be perceived, but ill so blen­  
ded and involved in myltery, that  
nothing diftin&amp; could be singled out  
for pursuit. In this fiate of uncer­  
taioty, as o the crime contemplated,  
the a&amp;s done, and the legal course to  
be pursued, I thought it befk to fend  
to the scene, where these things were  
principally in tranfa&amp;ion, a person in  
whose integrity, understanding and  
-discretion, entire confidence could be  
-reposed, with inftru&amp;ions to inveltigate  
~ the plots going en, to enter into con­  
ference (for which he had fufficient  
- credentiald) with the governors, and  
- all other officers, civil or mihtary, and  
with their aid, to do on the {pot what­  
ever should be necessary to discover  
the designs of the conspirators, arrest  
their means, bring their persons to pun­  
ilbment, and to call out the force of  
the country to suppress any unlawful  
enterprize, in which it should be found  
they were ¢ngaged. By this time it  
was known that many boats were un­  
der preparation, stores of provisions  
colle®ting, and an unusual number of  
suspicious chara&amp;ers in motion on the  
Ohio, and its waters. Besides dis­  
patching the confidential agent to that  
quarter, orders were at the {fame time  
sent to the governors of the Orleans  
and Mifliffippi territories, and to the  
commanders of the land and naval  
forces there, to be on their guard a­  
gainst furprize, and in constant readi­  
ness to refik any enterprize which  
might be attempted on the veflels,pofts  
or other obje@s under their care : and  
oa the Bth of November, infiru&amp;ions  
were forwarded to Gen.oWilkinfon to  
hasten an accommodation with the  
Spanith commandant on the Sabine,  
and, as soon as that was effe&amp;ed, to  
fall back with his principal force to the  
hither bank of the Miffifippi, for the  
defence of the interefling points on  
that river. By a letter received from  
that officer. of the 25th of Nov. but  
dated O&amp;. 21st, we learnt that a con­  
fidential agent of Aaron Burr had  
been deputed to him with communi­  
cations, partly written in cypher, and  
partly oral, explaining his designs, ex­  
aggerating his resources, and making  
{uch offers of emolument and com­  
mand, to engage him and the army  
in his unlawful enterprize, as he had  
flattered himfelf would be fuccefsful.  
The general, with the honor of a sol­  
dier, and fidelity of 2 good citizen,  
immediately dispatched a trulty offi­  
cer to me with information of what  
had passed, proceeded to establish such  
an underflanding with the Spanith  
commandant on the Sabine, as per­  
mitted him to withdraw his force a­  
cross the Mifliflippi, and to enter on  
measures for opposing the proje&amp;ted  
enterprize.  
The general’s letter, which came to  
band on the 2 sth of November, as has  
been mentioned, and some other in­  
formation, received a few days earlier,  
when brought together, developed  
Burr’s general designs, different parts  
of which only had been revealed to  
different informants. It appeared  
that he contemplated two diftin&amp; ob­  
jects, which might be carried on either  
jointly or separately, and either the  
one or the other firt as circumstances  
should direét. One of these was the  
severance of the union of these slates  
by the Allegany mountains, the other .  
an attack on Mexico. A third obje&amp;  
was provided, merely ostensible, to  
wit, the settlement of the pretended  
purchase of a tra&amp; of country on the  
Wafhita, claimed by a baron Baftrop.  
This was to serve as the pretext for all  
his preparations, an allurement for  
{uch followers as really wished to ac­  
quire settlements in that country, and  
a cover under which to retreat in the  
event of a final difcomfiture of both  
branches of his real design.  
He found at oace that the attach­  
ment of the western country to the  
present union was not to be thaken ;  
that its dissolution could not be effc&amp;-  
ed with the consent of its inhabitants 3  
and that his resources were inadequate  
as yet, to effe¢t it by force. He took  
his course then at once, determined to  
seize on New Orleans, plunder the  
baok there, possess himfelf of the mili­  
tary and naval stores, and proceed on  
his expedition to Mexice, and to this  
obje&amp; all his means and preparations  
were now dire&amp;ted. He colleéted from  
all the quarters where himfelf, or his  
agents poflefled influence, all the ar­  
dent, restless, desperate and difaffe&amp;-  
ed persons who were ready for any  
enterprize analogous to their charac­  
ters. He seduced good and well  
meaning citizens, some by aflurances  
that he poflefled the confidence of the  
government, &amp; was acting under its se­  
cret patronage ; a pretence which pro- -  
cured some credit from the l?ate of our  
differences with Spain ; and others by  
offers of land in&#x27; Baftrop’s claim on  
the Walhlter e o Suine o v

tion of Lis proceedings about the latk of  
November ; at which time therefore it  
was firlt possible to take fpecific measures  
to mecet thewn. The proclamation of  
November 27, two days after the receipt  
of general Wilkinson’s infaormation, was  
now issued. Orders were dispatched to  
every interelting point on the Ohio and  
Mifliippi, from Pitifburg to New Or­  
leans, for the employment of such force,  
either of the regulars or of the militia,  
and of such proceedings also of the civil  
authorities,as might enable them to seize  
on all boats and Rores provided for the  
enterprize, to arrest the persons concern­  
ed, and to suppress effe@tually the fur­  
ther progress of the enterprize. A little  
before the receipt of these orders in the  
state of Ohio, our confidential agent,  
who had been diligently employed in in­  
vestigating the conspiracy, had acquired  
fufficient information to open himfelf to  
the Governor of that state, and to apply  
for the immediate exertion of the author­  
ity and power of the @tate ro crush the  
combination. Guvernor Tiffin and the  
legislature, with a promptitude,an en­  
ergy and patriotic zeal, which entitle  
them to a diltingoifhed place in the af­  
feCtion of their filter {tates, effeéted the  
seizure of all the boats, provisions and  
other preparations within their reach,  
and thus gave a firk blow, matenally  
dilgbling the enterprize in its outset.  
In Kentucky a premature atteinpt to  
bring Barr to justice, without fufficient  
evidence for his convi&amp;ion, had produc­  
ed a popular impression in his favor, and  
a general difbelief of his guilt. This  
gave him an unfortunate oppor.unity of  
hiltening his equipments. The arrival  
ot the proclamation and orders, and the  
application and information of our con­  
fidcniial ageat, at length awakened the  
authorities of that state to the truth, and  
then produced the fame promptitude and  
energy of which the neighbouring state  
had set the example. Under an 2&amp; of  
their legislature of December 23, militia  
was Inltant&#x27;y ordered to different impor­  
tant points, and measures taken for doing  
whatever could yet be done. Some  
boats (accounts vary from five to double  
or treble that number) and persons (dif­  
ferently estimated from one to three huan­  
dred) had in the mean time passed the  
falls of Ohio to rendezvous at the mouth  
of Cumberland, with: others expeéed  
  
down that river. Not apprised till very  
late that any boats were building on  
Cuamberland, the effe&amp; of the proclama­  
tion had been trufled to for some time  
in the ®tate of Tenneflee. = But on the  
Igth of December similar communica­  
tions and inftru&amp;ions, with those to the  
neighboring states, were dispatched by  
express to the Governor, and a general  
officer of the western division of the Qtate,  
and on the 234 of December our confi­  
dential agent left Frankfort for Nashville  
to put into aéctivity the means of that  
state allo. But by information received  
yesterday, I learn that on the the 224 of  
December Mr. Burr descended the Cum­  
berland with two boats, merely of ac­  
commodation, carrying with him from  
that state no quota towards his unlawful  
enterprize. Whether after the arrival of  
the proclamation, of theordersyor of our  
agent, any exertion which could be made  
by that {tate, or the orders of the Gov­  
ernor of Kentucky for calling out the  
militia at the mouth of Cumberland,  
would be in time to arrest these boats,  
and those from the falls of Ohio,is still  
doubtful.  
Oa the whole the fugitives from the  
Ohio, with their aflociates from Cumber:  
land, or any other place in that quarter,  
cannot threaten serious danger to the ci­  
ty of New- Orleans.  
  
By the fame express of December 19,  
orders were sent to the Governors of  
Orleans and Miflifippi, supplementary  
to those which had been given on the  
25th of November, to hold the militia of  
their territories in readiness to co-operate  
for their defence wich the regular troops  
and armed vefiels then under command  
of Gen.Wilkinfon. Gureat alarm indeed  
was excited at New-Orleans by the ex­  
aggerated accounts of Mr. Burr, dissem­  
inated through his emissaries, of the ar­  
mies and navies he was to assemble there.  
Gen. Wilkinson had arrived there him--  
felf on the 24th of November, and had  
immediately put into a&amp;ivity the resour­  
ces of the place for the purpose of its  
defence, and on the 10th of December  
he was joined by his troops from the 3a­  
bine. Great zeal was shewn by the in­  
habitants generally ; the merchants of  
the place readily agreeing to the most  
laudable exertions and facrifices for man­  
ning the almed vessels with their seamen;  
and the other citizens manifefling une­  
quivocal fidelity to the union, and a {pi­  
rit of determined refiltance to their ex­  
pected assailants.  
Sarmifes have been hazarded that this enter.  
prizeis to receive aid from certain foreign pow­  
ers. Baut these surmises are wiihout proof or  
probability. The wisdom of the mcafures  
fan&amp;iooed by Congrels atits last feflion, has  
placed us in the paths of &amp;wd justice with  
the only powers with whom we had any diff. r­  
‘ences ; and nothing has happened fiace, which  
makes it cither their interest or ours to purfae  
another conrfe. No change of meaflures has  
“taken place on our part, nons ought 10 take  
place at this time. With the one, friendlv ars  
rangement was proposed, and the law, deemed  
_neccflary on the failare of thar, was suspended  
togive time for 2 fair trial of the issues. With  
the fame power, friendly arrangement is now  
proceeding, under good cxp:£ations, and the  
Kme law, deemed peceflary oo failare of thar,  
  
s ill fulpended 16 give time for a fair trial  
of the iffae. With the other negociation  
- was in like manner preferred, and provision.  
3l mealares enly taken to meet the event  
- ofruprure. Wehile therefore we do riot de­  
flett 1o the fl ghiet degree from the course  
we then sffumed, and are flill porfoing, with  
mautual consent, to restore a good under­  
flanding, we are not to impute to them  
preclices as irreconcileable 10 interest as to  
good faith, and changing neceflarily the re­  
lations of peace and justice between us to  
thole of war, Thele surmises are therefore  
to be imputed to the vauntings of the author  
of this enterprize, to multiply his parti­  
zaos, by magnifying the belicf of his prof­  
pcéls and support.  
By lewters from General Wilkinson of  
the 14th and 18:h of December, which  
Came t 0 hand two days afier the date of the  
Relolation of the House of Reprelentatives,  
that s to fay, on the morning of the 18th  
inst. I received the important afhdavit, a  
copy of which I now communicate, with  
exirafls of so much of the letters as comes  
within the {cope of the resolution. By thele  
it will be seen that of thres of the principal  
em:flaries of Mr, Burr, whom the general  
kad caused 19 be apprehended, one had been  
liberated by Habeas Corpus, and two oth.  
ers, being those particularly employed in  
the endeavor 1o corrupt the general, and ar­  
my of the U. S. have been embaiked by  
bim for poris in the Atlantic States, proba­  
bly on the consideration that au impartial  
trial coald not be expefled daring the pre.-  
sent agitations of New. Orleans, and that  
that city was not as yet a fafe place of con­  
finement. As soon as these persons shall  
srrive, they will be delivered to the cufio­  
dy ot the law, and left to such course of tri­  
al, both as to place and process, as its fanc­  
tionarics may dire&amp;t. The presence of the  
highe®t judicial authorities, to be aflembled  
at this place within a few days, the means  
of parfuing a founder course of proceedings  
here than el{ewhere, and the 2id of thke Ex­  
ecative means, should the judges have oc­  
casion to use them, render it equally desira­  
ble for the criminal, as for the public, thar,  
being already remored from the place where  
they were apprehended, the firft regular  
arrcft should take place here, and the courle  
of proceedings receive here their proper di­  
reflion, ‘

Yo the Senate and House of Representatives of the  
deh . United States.  
AGREEABLY. to the request of the  
of Representatives, communicated  
in their resolution of the sixteenth instant,  
I proceed to state, undef the reserve therein  
sed, information received touching  
an illegal combination of ie, oye  
against the peace end safety of the union,  
and a sabibory- ae ition pianped by them  
gainst the territories of a power in amity  
United States, wit the measures  
pursued for suppressing the same.  
_ Thad, for some time, been-in the con-  
stant tiow of receiving such further  
information as.would have enabled me to  
lay before the legislature the termination,  
as well as the be ing ad progress of this  
of depravity so fur as it has been acted  
Sn eho und its waters. From this: the  
.of safety of the lower country might  
pup been estimated on probable grounds,  
and the delay was indulged the ratfer, be-  
cause.no circumstance had made it necessa-  
ry ta call in the aid of the. legislative func-  
tions. Information now recently communi-  
  
  
  
cated, has brou us Reurly to the period  
contemplated. The mass of what 1 have  
  
received in the course of these. transac-  
tions is voluminous: but little has been  
given under the sanction of an gath, so as  
to constitute formal and le;zal evidence. It  
is chiefly in the form of Iciters, often con-  
taining such a mixture of Mien; con-  
jectures and suspicions,as renders it difficult  
to sift out the real facts, and «mnadvisable  
to. hazard more. than efiéral outlines,  
strengthened by concurrent formation, or  
the particular credibility of the relator. In  
this state of the evidence, deliyered some-  
times too under the restriction of private  
confidence, neither safety nor justice will  
permit the exposing ysmes, except thatbdf  
the principal actor, whose guilt is placed  
  
ie ad, cer .  
: time jo-the latter part of Septem-  
ber, I received intimations that designs  
  
were in agitation in the western country,  
  
unlawful, and unfriendly to the peace of the  
union ; and that the prime mover in these  
was. Aaron Burr, heretoforg distinguished  
by the favor of his covatry. The grounds  
of these intimations being inconclusive, the  
objects uncertain, and the fidclity of that  
country known to be firm, the only mexsure  
taken was to urge the informants to usc their  
best endeavors to get furiher insight into  
the designs and procee? 1:5 ofthe suspected  
&quot;persone; and to commusicete’them to me.  
It was not till the -la:tor part of Oct. that  
the of the conspirecy began to be  
os ved 5 but = so blended, and invol-  
v Mystery, nothing distinct could  
be singled out for pursuit. Lthoughe it  
best to stnd to the scene, where these  
things were principally in transaction, a  
person in whose integrity, understanding  
and discretion, entire cohilence could be  
reposed, with instructions to investigate  
‘the plots going on, to enter into «conference  
(for which he @.d suficient erecentials)  
with the governors and all other officers,  
civil and militery,and with their aid, to do on  
the spot whatevc? should be necessary to  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
discover the designs of the conspirators, ar-  
rest their means, bri; their persons to  
punishment, and to cui out the toree of the  
country to suppress any unlawiui enter-  
prize, in whici it shouid be founa tney were  
engaged. By this time it was Known that  
many boats were under preparation, stores  
of provisions coljecting,anti an uousual nusi-  
ber of suspicious characters in motion on  
the Ohio, and its waters. Besides ais-  
patching the confidential aget! to that quar-  
ter, orders were at the same time seat to  
the governors of the Orieans «ud Mississip-  
pi territories,and the ecominandaysol the land  
and naval forces there, tobe on vheir guard  
against surprize, and in consiant reaiiness  
to resist any enterprize whica mi,ziit be at-  
  
tempted on the vessels, posts, ar other  
  
objects under their care : and on tho eigath  
ef November, instructions were forwarded  
  
eneral Wiikinson, to hasten an accu A:mo-  
  
tion with the Spanish cominandurt on  
the Sabine, and as soon as that was e:fected,  
to fall back with his. principal jorce to che  
hither bank of the Mississippi, for the da-  
fence of the interesting poizits on that river.  
  
By a letter received trom that o:icer of  
  
Nove. 25, but dated Oct. 21, we searnt thie a  
confidential agent of A.Burr, bad been depu-  
ted ta hiny, with communications,partly writ-  
ten in cypher, and partly oral, explaining  
his designs, exaggerating his resources,  
and making such ofiers of eniolument and  
commend, to engage him and the army in  
bis uniawful enterprizes as he had iluttered  
himaseif would be successful. ‘Lhe general,  
with the honor ofa soidicr, and fidelity ofa  
good citizen, immediately dispetched a  
trusty officer to me, with information of  
What bad passed, proceeded to establish  
such an understanding with the Spauish  
commandant onthe Sabine, as permitted  
him to withdraw his force across the Mis-  
gissippi, and to enter on measures dor oppo-  
sing the projected enterprize.  
  
The gencrai’s letter, which came to hand  
on the twenty-fifth of November, as has  
been mentioned, and some other intorma-  
tion received a few days earlicr, when  
brought together, developed Burr’s general  
designs, different parts of which oniy had  
been revealed to different informunts. It  
uppeézred that he contemplated two distinct  
odyects, which might be carried on either  
jointly or separately, and either the one or  
the other first, as circumstances should di-  
rect, One of these was the severance of  
the union of these states by the Allegany  
mountains ; the other an aitack on Mexico.  
A third object was provided, mereiy osxten-  
sible, to wit, the settlement of a pretended  
purchase ofa tract of country on the Wash-  
ita, Claimed by a baron Bastrop. This was  
to serve as the pretext for all his prepara-  
tions, an allurement for such followers as  
really wished to acquire setthements in that  
country, and a cover under which to retreat  
in the event of a final discomfiture of both  
branches of his real design.  
  
Hie found at once that the attachment of  
the western country to the “present union,  
was not to be shaken ; that its dissolution  
could not be effected with the conseat of  
its inhabitants, and that his resources were  
inadequate, as yet, to effect it by force.  
He took his course then at once, determin-  
ed to seize on New-Orieans, plunder the  
bank there, possess himself of the military  
  
i and naval stores, and proceed ow his expe-  
  
dition to Mexico ; and to this obiect all his  
means and preparations were now directed,  
He collected from all quarters where him-  
|| Seal or his agent possessed inltwence, ali the  
  
aracnt, restiess, desperate, and disaf-  
lec\ed persons who were ready for any en-  
terpilze analogous to their charceters. He  
secuiced oud and well meaning citizens,  
soluc by assurances that he possessed the  
\ conliacnce of (uc government, and was act-  
|| Mg uncer ils Secret patronage ; a pretence  
| Ww hica procured some creuit irom the state  
  
  
  
,| by ofiers of land in Bastrop’s claim on the  
Washita.  
his was the state of my. information of  
his proceeding§ about the last of Novem-  
ber ; at which time, therefore, it was first  
possible to take! specific measures to meet  
them. ‘Lhe proclamation of November  
twenty-seventa, twodays after the receipt  
of general Wilkinson’s information, was  
now issued. Orders were dispatched to ev-  
ery interesting point on the Ohio and Mis-  
sissippl, from Pittsburg to New Orleans,  
for the employment of such force, either  
ot the reguicrs or of the militia, and of such  
\ proceedings ulso of ‘the civil authorities, as  
might enable them to seize on all boats and  
stores provided for the enterprize, to arrest  
the persons concerned, and to suppress ef-  
fegtuatly the further progress of the enter-  
prixe. A littie before the receipt of these  
orders in the state of Ohio, our confiden-  
tigluxent, who had been diligently craploy-  
ed in ivvestigating the conspiracy had ac-  
guired spilicient information to open him-  
selfto the governor oi that state, and to  
apply for the immediate exertion of the au-  
thority and power of the state, to crush the  
combination. Governor Tiffin and the ie-  
par with a promptitude, an energy,  
and pairiotic zeal, which entitle them toa  
distinguished place in the affection of their  
sister states, etiected the seizure of all the  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
boats, provisions, and other preparations  
withih their reach; and thus gave a first blow,  
materially disabling the enterprize in its  
outset.  
  
in Kentucky a premature attempt to  
bring Burr to justice, without sufficient ¢v-  
idence fof his cénvictiop, had produceda  
popular iaypression in his favor, and a gene  
j eral disbelief of his guilt. ‘This gave him  
an unfortunate opportunity of hastening bis  
equipments. ‘The arrival ef the proclama-  
tion and orders, and the appiicuiion and in-  
formation of our cenfidentiel agent, at length  
awakened the authoriies of thot state to the  
truth, and then produced the same promp-  
utude and energy of which the neighboring  
state had set the example. Uncer an act  
of their legislature of December twenty-  
third, roilitia was ivstantly ordered to  
different important points, and measures ti  
  
mess Bars  
  
  
  
ken for doing whatever could yet be cone.  
Some boats (uccounts vary from five to  
cpuble or treble that number) and persons  
(ciflerently estimated from one to three  
hundred) had in the mean time passed the  
“falls of Ohio, to rendezvous at the mouth ot  
Cumberland, with others expected cowl  
that river.  
Not apprized, till very late, that any  
beats were building on Cumberiand, the el-  
fect of the proclamation had been truste

put on the nineteenth of December similar  
courmunications and instructions, with those  
to the neighboring states,were ene by  
express,te the governor ce a general 0 pre  
of the western aivision Oo the state ; and on  
the 23d of December, our confidential agent  
loft Prankfort for Nashville, to put Into ac-  
tivity, the means of that state also. But  
by information received yesteriay, I learn  
that on the 22d of December, Ma Burr de-  
ecended the Cumberland, with two bots  
juerely of accomodation, carrying from that  
state no quota towards his unlawful enter-  
prize. Whe ther after the ervival of the  
proclamation, of the orders, or of our agent,  
any exerion which could be made by that  
state, or the orders of the governor of Ken-  
tucky for calling out the niilitia at the mouth  
of Cumberland, ‘would be in time to urrest  
these boats, and those from the falls of UO-  
hio, is still doubtful.  
}n the whole the fugitives from the Ohio,  
wich their associates from Cumberland, or  
cauay other place in that querter,cannot threat-  
en serious danger to the city of N.Grieans.  
By the same express of December nine-  
teenth, orders were sent to the governors  
of Orleans and Mississippi, supplementary  
to those which had been given on the 25th  
of November, to hold the militia of their  
territories in readiness to co-operate for  
their defence with the regular troops and  
armed vessels then under command of gen.  
Wiikinson. Great alarm indeed was exci-  
ted at N. Orleans, by the exaggerated ac-  
counts of Mr. Burr, disseminated through  
his emissarics, of the armies and navies he  
was to assemble there. Gen. Wilkinson  
had arrived there on the twenty-fourth of  
November, and had immediately put ‘into  
wctivity the resources of that place, for the  
purpose of its defence ;—and on the tenth  
of December he was joined by his troops  
from the Sabine. Great zeal was shewn  
by the inhabitants generally ; the mer-  
chants of the place readily agreeing to the  
most laudable exertions for manning the  
armed vessels with their seamen, and the  
other citizens manifesting unequivocal fi-  
deiity to the union, and a spirit of determin-  
ed resistance to their expected assailants.  
Surmises have been hazarded that this en-  
terprize is to receive id from certain for-  
eign powers. But these surmises are  
without proof or probability. ‘The wisdom  
aithe measures sanctioned by congress ut

of peace and justice, with the only powers  
with whom we had ‘any differences; and  
nothing has heppened sinct which makes

pursuing, with mutual consent, to restore a  
good understanding, we are not to impute  
*) them practices as irreconcileable to inter-  
  
‘&#x27;t as to good faith, and changing necessa-  
iy the relations of peace to those of war.  
I icse surmises are therefore to be inaputed  
to tie vauntings of the author of this en-  
terprize to multiply his partizans by m@gni-  
fying the belief ot his prospects and support.  
  
By lctters from gen. Wilkinson of the  
14th and 18th ef December, which came to  
hand two days after the date of the resa@lu-  
tion of the House of Representatives, that  
is to say, on the morning of the 18th instant,  
I received the important affidavit, a copy of  
which I now communicate, with extracts of  
so much of the lettets as comes within the  
scope of the resoiutiou. By these it will  
be seen that of three of the principal emis-  
saries of Mr. Burr, whom the general had  
caused to be apprehended,’ one had been  
liberated by habeas corpus, and two others,  
being those particularly employed in the  
endeavor to corrupt the general and army  
of the United States, have been embarked  
by him for ports, inthe Alantic States,  
probably on the consideration that an im-  
partial trial could not be expected, during  
the present assitations of New-Orieans, and  
that that city was not as yeta safe place of  
confinement. As soon as these persons  
shall arrive, they will be delivered to the  
custody of the law, and left to such course  
of triai both as to piace and process, as  
its functionaries may circct. The presence  
of the highest judicial authoritics, to be as-  
sembled at this plaee within a few davs, the  
means of pursuing a sounder course of  
proceedings here than elsewhere, and the  
aidof the executive means, should the judg  
es have occasion to use them, render it e-  
qually desirable, for the ciiminal as for the  
public, that, being already removed from  
the place where they were apprehended,  
the first regular arrest should take place

By a letter received from that offi­

he had Buttered himself would b« auc­

T he general*! letter which came to  
head on the fifth of November, as has  
been mentioned, and some other infor­  
mation, received a few days ftrlier, when  
brought together, developed Burr’s ge­

only had been revealed to different infer­  
j ttoaitts., it appeared that ha contemplated  
two distinct objects, which might he car*  
ried on either jointly ot separately, and  
cither the one or thy other first, as cir­

at once, determined to seine on New*  
Orleans, plunder the bunk there, pos­

Mexico, . end to this object all his means

some credit from the state of our U»fT«­  
Ranees with Spain j and others by tffers

. •This was the state of my bafurm uion  
of Ms proceedings about the last of Nov.  
attrhich time therefore it waa. first possi­  
ble to take specific measures to meet them.  
The proclamation of November 27. two  
day* after the receipt of general Wilkin*  
ton&#x27;s information, .was now issued. Or­  
ders were dispatched to every interesting  
point oo the Ohio and Misstuippi, from  
Pittsburg to New-Orfcans, for the em­  
ploy asent of aurb iorce, either of the,re­  
gulars or of the militia, and of such pro*  
cecdings also of the civil authorities, av  
might enable them to seize on all boats  
  
atm stores provioccf lor. me cnwrpriw:,  
to arrest the, persons concerned, and to  
•uppreM cCectujrily the farther progress  
afthe enterprise. , A little before tbs re­  
ceipt ofjhese orders ia tbe state of Ohio,  
our confidential agent, who had befctt di­  
ligently employed ig investigating the  
conspiracy,,had acquired sufficient in­  
formation to open hintsclf to the gover­  
nor of d»t state, and to npply for the im­  
mediate exertion of the authority and  
power of the stats to crush the. combina­  
tion.’ Governor Tifl&gt;n and the legisla­  
ture with a promptitude, and energy and  
patriotic zeal, which entitle them to a  
distinguished place in the atfectien of  
their sister states, .effected the seizure of  
all tbe boats, provisions and mtber pre­  
parations within their reach*, and thus  
gave a first blow, materially disabling  
the enurprize to tts outset. • 1 1  
la Kentackva on mature jfttempt to  
bring Burr to justice, without sufficient  
evidence for lug conviction, had produc­  
ed a popular iasptresaioe in his favor, and  
,a general dabettpf of his gout This  
gave an unfortunate opportunity of has­  
tening his equipments. Tile arrival qf  
the prodanfat ion and orders, and the ap-.  
pi test ion sad information of our confi­  
dential aghat, at length awakened the  
authorities of that state to the truth, sad  
IY  
nets  
amplitude St coer­  
cing state had. set  
■ an set oftheir le­  
gislature eTDnc. IT, militia was instant­  
ly ordered tn different important points,  
taken for doiag whatever  
)  
  
co&#x27;ill! yet be done. Some boats (accounts  
vary from five to dbubie or treble that  
7*  
$ron  
number) Mid person* (differently esti­  
mated from one to three hundred) had in  
the mean time passed the falls of Ohio to  
rendezvous at the aaouth of Cumberland,  
with others expected down that river.—  
Not apprised till very late that any boat*  
were building at Cumberland, the effect  
of the proclamation had been trusted to  
for some time iu the state of Tehnessee.  
But on the 19th of Dec. similar commu­  
nications and instructional with those to  
the neighboring states, were dispatched  
by oppress to the governor, and a gene.I  
ral,officer of the western division of the  
state, end on the 95d of December our  
confidential agent left Frankfort for  
Nashville to nut into activity the means  
of that statejuso. But by information  
received yesterday, I learn that on the  
Sided Dae. Mr. Burr descended the  
Cumberland with two boats, merely of  
accommodation, carrying with him from  
that state no quota towards his unlawful  
enterprise. Whether after the arrival  
of the proclamation, of the orders, or  
of our agent, any exertion which could  
be made by that state, or the orders of  
the go vernor of Kentucky for calling out  
the militia at the mouth of Cumberland,.  
would be in time to arrest these boat*,  
and those from the fads of Ohio, is mill  
..... ■. &#x27;  
On the whole the fugitives from the  
C hio, with their associates from Cum.  
bcrUad, or *n&gt; other place in that quar­  
ur, cannot threaten serious danger to the  
city of New.Orlesns.  
By the same express of December 19,  
order* were sent to the governors of Or.  
Wans and Mississippi, supplementary to  
those which had been given.on the 95th  
  
ot November, to hold the militiaof their  
territories in readiness to co-operate for  
the jr defence with the regular troops  
armed tcmU then under command of  
general Wilkinson. Great-alarm indeed  
w^s excited at New-Orlea«s by the ex.  
aggerated accounts of Mr. Burr, dis­  
seminated thro’ his emissaries, of the ar­  
mies and navies he was to assemble there.  
, General Wilkinson had arrived she re  
himself on the 24th&#x27;of November tnd  
had immediately pupinto activity the re­  
sources of die place for . the phrpose of  
its defence, and oiUheaeoth of Dccem-*  
her he was joined by his troops from th*  
Sabm?.^ Great zeal was shewn by thp  
inhabitants generally; the merchants of  
Ihfc pbee readily -agreeing to the most  
laudable .exertions and sacrifices for thd  
manning the armed vessels with their  
seamen ^,and the other citizens manifes­  
ts unequivocal fidelity to the union-,  
•pa a spirit of determined resistance (o  
their expected assailants. &lt; &gt; &lt; \

Some time in the latter p.urt of Septem­  
ber. I received informations that d^tigns  
were in agitation in the V\ eft.ern country,  
unlawful and unfriendly to the pc-ice iff  
the union : and that the pr me mover in  
th-fe was Aaron Hu r, heretofore diltm­  
guilhcd by the favor this country. The  
grounds of their iuliattiioM beiag ,r.c.’,n­  
cluhve, the objects uecertain, and the li*  
dclity of that country known to be firm,  
the only meafure taken was to urge the in­  
formants to uie their belt endeavors to  
get further inlight into the defignt and  
proceedings of the fufptded perfons, and  
to communicate them to me.  
It was not till the latter part of Octo­  
ber that the objects of the conlpiracy be­  
gan to be perceived, but ftiil lo blended  
and involved in mytUry that nothing tiif­  
tirnft could be ungied out for purfiuit, In  
this ftdte of uncertainty, as to the crime  
contemptlated, tnc ads done, and the le­  
gal c ouile to be puriued, i thought it bi ft  
to fend to the iccnt, where ikiC things  
were principally in tranfitctiOO* a perlon  
in whole integrity, unaerftaudirg and dif­  
cretion, entire confidence could be repo!  
ed, with inftrudionstoinvcftigaie the plots  
going on, to enter in conference,(for which  
he had fufficient credentials) with the gov-;  
ernors, and all other officers, civil and mil- \
Stary, and with their aid. to do on the lp . j  
whatever (hould be nccelfiary to difcovn

means, bring their perfons to punifhmcm,  
and to call out the force of the country t  
lupprefs any unlawful enterprize, in wfhicn j

By this t:ine it was known that rtiany boat- !  
were under preparition, ft ore* of provifi­  
on« collecting, and an unufual number ot  
• fufpicioub charadtrs in motion on the Ohio  
trd its waters. Bolides difpatchiug tn •  
confidential agt nt to that quarter, or lei  
were at the fime time to the Govern- ;  
or- of the Od^ana and Miftftppi teriit&gt;rics  
and to the commanders o* the land and na

fainft farprife, and in court ant readinefs to  
refift any enterprise, which might be at­  
tempted on the v-rtcis, polls or other r»U­  
jeds under ther care: and on the 8 h of  
K ivember, inftructions were forwarded to  
Gen. Wilkinl&#x27;oo to haften an accommo !a­  
tion with the Spanifh commandant on the

to fall back with his principal force to the  
hither bank of the M.lTilippi, for the de­  
fence of the intertfting points on that riv­  
er. By a letter received from |that offi­  
cer, of the 15th of November, but dated  
October lift, we learnt that a confidential  
agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to  
him with communications, partly written  
in cypher, and partly oral, explaining his  
defigns, exaggerating h » rsfources, and  
makmg fuch offer* of emolument and com­  
mand, to engage him and the army in his  
Unlawful enterprife, as he had fl ittered  
hiitnftff would be fuccefsful. The Gener­  
al, with the honor of a foldier, and fidelity  
of a good citilen, immediately difparchcd  
a trufty officer to me with information of  
what had parted, proceeded to cftablifli  
an underftanding with the Spanifh  
commandant on the Sabine as permitted  
mm to withdraw his force acrofs the Mif­  
fiflippi, and to enter on mtafures for op­  
poling the projected enterprise.  
The general&#x27;s letter which came to hand  
on the a$th of November, as hns been  
mentioned, and fom* other information,  
a few days earlier, when broygbt  
  
together, developed Burr’s general defigns,  
dirtcrent pans ot which only had been re­  
vealed to ditkrctil mtormauts. it appear­  
ed he contemplated two ddtmCt objects,  
which might be carried on cither jointly  
or icpuraitly, and either the one or the  
other hilt as circumfrances lhould dircCt.  
One ot theic was the teverauee of the un­  
ion ot dude dales by the Allegany moun­  
tains, the other an attack on Mexico. A  
thud oojcct was provided, merely ollenh­  
bit, to wit, the ktticmcut oi the pretenu­  
cd purehalc ot a trad ot country on rLe  
Wattiila, claimed by a baron Baitrop.  
inis was to lerve as the pretext lor uil  
his pieparatioiis, an allurement tor luck  
followeis as really wiUicd to acquire kt­  
tieinents m tuar country, and a cover un­  
der which to retica t in the event ot a hnal  
diicomhiurc ot botn brandies ot Uts real  
adicn.  
Ate round at once that the attachment of  
the we lien, country to the prclcnt un on  
was not to be Uiak.cn ; that its ditioiuUuu  
couid not be chected with the coiileul oi

ti.iguithed place in the attention of their

• iiig buri to julttce, without iulleicntev*  
auice tor his conviction, had ptoduced  
popular uuprcifion in his tavor, and a

•urn mi unfortunate opportunity ot halten­  
ig his equipments. The arrival of the  
proclamation and ordetS, and the appitca­  
ion and information ot our confidential a­  
.Tert, at length awakened the authorities  
if that Hate to the truth, and then produc­  
ed the lame promptitude and energy of  
which the neighbouring ft ate had fet the

from five to double or treble that number)  
anti perfons (differently eft 1 mated from ,  
one to three hundred) had in tht meantime ‘  
pa fled the falls of Ohio to rendezv usn

1 merely of accommodation, carrying with  
him from that Hate no quotn towards his

arrival of the proclamation, of the orders,  
or of our agent, auy exertion which could  
be made b/ that Hate, or the orders ot the  
Governor ot Kentucky for calling &lt;»ut the

be in time to arreft thefe boats, andthoic

By the fame exprefs of December 19,

leans and Mifliflippi, fuppltmentar.y to  
thofc which had been given on the xjth of  
November, to hold the militia of therr ter­  
ritories in readinefs to co-operate for then  
defence with the regular troops and arm­  
ed veflcls then under command of General  
Wilkinfon. Great alarm indeed was exci­  
ted at Ncw-Otleans by the exaggerated ac­  
counts of Mr. Burr, effeminated through  
hit. enuftaries, of the armies and navies he  
was to afftmble there. Geneial Wilkin­  
fon had arrived thtre himtelf on the 24th  
of November, and hid immediately put in­  
to activity, the r&lt;/ urces of the place for  
the puipoic of its dttence, and on the 10th  
ot December he was joined by his troops  
from the Sabine. Great zeal was fhewn  
by the inhabitants generally ; the mer­  
1 chants of the place readily agreeing to the  
molt laudable exertions and facrifrees foi  
manning the armed vcBcls with their (ea­  
rn c» ; and the other citizen* mamteBing  
unequivocal fidelity to the union, and a  
I&#x27;pirit of determined rcfittance lo their ex­  
pected affulant*.  
Surmifes have been hazarded that this  
enterprife is to receive aid from certain  
foreign powers. But thcle turn life* are  
without proof or probability. The witdom  
of the meafures fan&amp;ioned by emigref* at  
its laft leffion, has placed us in the paths  
of peace and juftice with the only powers  
with whom we had any differences, and  
nothing has happened lince, winch makes  
it either their inUrcft or outs to purfuca­  
nothcr cotirfc. No change of mcafiire  
has taken plate on our part, none ought  
to take place at this time. With the o:*  
friendly arrangement was propoltd, a*id  
the law, deeiried rrtcdlaiy iki the failure  
  
ot mat, was impended to give tune lor a  
fair trial of thr tlluc. With the faun pow­

under good expectations, and the fatoic  
law, &#x27;Veined i eceflary on failure of tl»at,  
i&amp; Hill lulpeiuied i«&gt; give time for a fair tri­  
al of tlie illue. With the other segocia­  
tion was in like manner preferred, and  
provtfional meafures only taken to meet  
the tvem of rupture. While therefore we  
do not defied in the fighteft dtgrer from  
the couric we then afiumed, and are Hill  
purfuing, with mutual confent, to itfiore  
a good under Handing*, we are not to im­  
pute to therr* pritheo as iireomcdeable  
to intend at to go xi fnith and changing  
nect flinly the relations of peace; and jul­

feis oi emolument and command, to en­  
gage him and th - army in his unlawful  
1 enterprise, as he had flattered himself  
v»ouicl be successful. The general, with  
1 the honor of a soldior, and fidelity of a.

the facts be fairly and fully stated. But until they  
are, we can only judge on the information before  
us. What is the amount olv this information ?  
The President, in his communication to congress,  
says,  
“ By a letter received from that officer (Wilkinson)  
on the 25th Nov. hut dated Oct. 21st, we learnt  
that a confidential agent of Aaron Burr had been  
deputed to him with communications, partly writ­  
ten in cypher, anu partly oral, explaining his de­  
signs, exaggerating his resources, and making such  
offers of emolument and command, to engage him  
and the army in his unlawful enterprize, as he had  
flattered himself would he successful. The general,  
with the honour of a soldier, and fidelity of a good  
citizen, immediately dispatched a trusty officer to  
me with information of what had passed, proceed­  
ed to establish such un understanding with the Spa­  
nish commandant on the Sabine as permitted him  
to withdraw his forces across the Mississippi, and  
to enter ^measures for opposing the projected en­  
terprize. &#x27; &#x27;  
  
“ The general s letterwhicli came to hand on the  
C5th of Nov. as has been mentioned, and some o­  
ther information, received a few days earlier, when  
brought together, developed Burr’s general designs,  
different parts of which only had been revealed to  
different informants. It appeared that he contem­  
plated two distinct objects, which might he carried  
on either jointly or separately, and either the oneor  
the other first as circumstances should direct. One  
of these was the severance of the union of tlje.se  
states by the Allegany mountains, the other an at­  
tack on Mexico. A third object was provided,  
merely ostensible, to wit, the settlement of the pre­  
tended purchase of a tract of country on the Wa­  
shita, claimed by a baron Bastrop. This was t&lt;v  
serve as the pretext for all his preparations, an al­  
lurement for such followers as really wished to ac­  
quire settlements in that country and a rover under  
which to retreat in the event of a final discomfiture  
of both branches of his real design.  
“ lie found at once that the attachment of the  
western country to the present union was not to he  
shaken ; that its dissolution could not be effected  
with the consent of its inhabitants ; and that his  
resources were inadequate, as yet, to effect it by  
force, lie took bis course then at once, determined  
to seize on New-Orleans, plunder the bank there,  
posses himself of the military and naval stores, and  
proceed on his expedition to Mexico, and to this  
object all his means and preparations were now di­  
rected. He collected from all the quarters where  
himself or his agents possessed influence, all the ar­  
dent, restless, desperate and disaffected persons who  
were ready for any enterprize analogous to their  
characters. He seduced good and well meaning ci­

had been revealed to different informants. It

or feparatcly, and either the one or the other  
firfl as circumftances fliould direct. One of  
thefewas the feverance of the union of thefe

This was to ferve as the pretex- for ajl hia pre­

event of a final difeomfiluie of both branches of  
his real defign.  
“ He found at once that the attachment of

To the Senate and +68  
House of Representatives, Wc.  
  
AGREEABLY to the request of the House of Representatives, com-  
municated in their resolution of the 16th inst. I proceed to state under the  
reserve therein expressed, information received touching an illegal combi-  
nation of private individuals against the peace and safety of the union, and a  
military expedition planned by them against the territories of a power in  
amity with the United States, with the measures I have pursued for sup-  
pressing the same.  
  
I had, for some time, been in the constant expectation of receiving such  
  
further information as would have enabled me to lay before the legislature  
the termination, as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of de-  
pravity, so far as it has been acted on the Ohio and its waters. From this  
the state of safety of the lower country might have been estimated on pro-  
bable grounds, and the delay was indulged the rather, because no circum;  
stance had yet made it necessary to call in the aid of the legislative func-  
tions. Information now recenly communicated, has brought us nearly to  
the period contemplated. The mass of what I have received in the course  
of these transactions is voluminous : but little has been given under the  
sanction of an oath, so as to constitute formal and legal evidence. It is  
chiefly in the form of letters, often containing such a mixture of rumours,  
conjectures and suspicions, as render it difficult to sift out the real facts,  
and unadviseable to hazard more than general outlines, strengthened by. con-  
current information, or the particular credibility of the relator. In this  
state of the evidence, delivered sometimes too under the restriction of  
private confidence, neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing names,  
except that of the principal actor, whose guilt is placed beyond qufestion.  
_. Some time in the latter part of September, I received intimations that  
dasigns were in agitation in the Western country, unlawful and unfriendly  
to the peace of the union; and that the prime mover in these was Aaron  
Burr, heretofore distinguished by the favour of his country. The grounds  
of these intimations being inconclusive, the objects uncertain, and the fi-  
delity of that country known to be firm, the only measure taken was to  
urge the informants to use their best endeavors to get further insight into  
ie designs and proceedings of the suspected persons, and to cemmunicate  
them to me.  
  
It was not till the latter part of October that the objects of the conspiracy |  
  
began to be perceived, but still so blended and involved in mystery, that  
nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit. In that state of un-  
certainty, as to the crime contemplated, the acts done, and the legal course  
to be pursued, I thought it best,to send to the scene, where these things  
were principally in transaction, a person in whose integvity, understanding  
and discretion, entire confidence could be reposed, with instructions to in.  
vestigate the plots going on, to enter into conference (for which he had suf-  
ficient credentials) with the governors, and all other officers, civil and mili-  
tary, and with their aid, to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to  
discover the designs of the conspirators, arrest their means, bring their  
persons to punishment, and to call out the force of the countrv to suppress  
any unlawfulenterprize, in which it should be found they were engaged. By  
this time it was known that many boats were under preparation, stores of  
provisions collecting, and an unusual number of suspicious characters in mo

tion on the Ohio and its waters. Besides dispatching the confidential agent,  
to that quarter, orders were ut the same time sent to the governours of the  
Orleans and Missisippi territories, and to the commanders of the land and  
  
naval forces there, to be on their guard against surprise, and in constant  
readiness to resist any enterprize which might be attempted on the vessels,  
posts, or other objects under their care: and on the 8th of November, ini-  
structions were forwarded to Gen. Wilkinson to hasten an accommodation  
with the Spanish commandant onthe Sabine, and, as soon as that was ef.  
fected, to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the Missi-  
sippi, for the defence of the urteresting points on that river. By a letter re-  
ceived from that officer, of the 25th of November, but dated October 2st,  
we learnt that a confidential agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him  
with communications, partly written in cypher, and partly oral, explaining  
his designs, exaggerating his resources, and making such offers of emolu-  
ment and comm: and, to engage him and the army in his unlawful enterprize,  
as he had flattered himself would be successful. The general, with the  
fonour of a soldier, and tidelity of a good citizen, immediately dispatched »  
trusty officer to me with information of what had passed, proceeded to es-  
tablish such an understanding with the Spanish commandant on the Sabine,  
as permitted him to withdraw his force across the Missisippi, and to enter  
on measures for opposing the projected enterprize.  
  
The General’s letter, which came to hand on the 25th of November, as  
has been mentioned, and some other information, received a few days ear-  
lier, when brought together, developed Burr’s general designs, different  
parts of which only had been revealed to different informants. It appeared  
that he contemplated two distinct objects, which might be carried on either  
jointly or separately, and either the one or the other first as circumstances  
should direct. One of these was the severance of the union of these states  
by the Allegany mountains, the other an attack on Mexico. A third object  
was provided, merely ostensible, to wit, the settlement of the pretended  
purchase of atract of country on the Washita, claimed by a baron Bastrop.  
This was to serve as the pretext for all his preparations, an allurement for  
such followers as really wished to acquire settlements in that country, and  
a cover under which to retreat in the event of a final discomfiture of both  
branches of his real design.  
  
He found at once that the attachment of the western eountry to the pre-  
sent union was not to be shaken ;_ that its dissolution could not be effected  
with the consent of the mhabitants ; and that his resources were‘inadequate,  
as yet, to effect it by force. He took his conrse then at once, ‘determined  
to seize on New-Orleans, plunder the bank there, possess himself of the  
military and nayal stores, and proceed on his expedition to Mexico, and te  
this object all his means and preparations were now directed. He collec-  
ted from all the quarters where himself, or his agents possessed influence,  
all the ardent, restless, desperate, and disaffec ted | persons, who were ready  
for any enterprize analagous to their characters. He seduced good and  
well-meaning citizens, some by assurances that he possessed the confidence  
of the rovernment, and was acting under its secret patronage ; a pretence  
which procured some credit from the state of our differences with Spain ;  
and others by offers of land in Bastrop’s claim on the Washita. = °  
  
This was the state of my inform: lone of his proceedings about the last of  
  
November; at which time therefore it was first possible to take specifick  
measures tomeetthem. The proclamation of November 27, two days after  
the receipt of Generzi Wilkinson’s information, was now issued. Orders  
were dispatched to every interesting point on the Ohio and Missi isippi, from  
Pittsburg to New-Or&#x27;leans, for the employment of such force, either of the  
regulars or of at Tilt tia, and of such proceedings also ef the civil author

‘anterprize, to arrest the persons concerned, and to suppress effectually the  
further progress of the enterprize. A little before the receipt of these or-  
ders inthe state of Ohio, our confidential agent, who had been diligently  
employed in investigating the conspiracy, had acquired sufficient information  
to open himself to the governour of that state, and to apply for the immedi-  
ate exertion of the authority and power of the state to crush the combina-  
tion. Governour Tiffin and the legislature, with a prompitude, an energy,  
and patriotick zeal, which entitle them to a distinguished place in the atiec-  
tion of their sister states, eflected the seizure of all the boats, provisions,  
and other preparations within their reach, and thus gave a first blow, mate-  
rially disabling the enterprize in its outset. ye  
  
In Kentucky a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice, without suf-  
  
ficient evidence for his conviction, had produced a popular impression im his  
  
favour, and a general disbelief of his guilt. This gave him an unfortunate  
  
opportunity of hastening his equipments. The arrival of the proclamation  
  
and orders, and the application and information of our confidential agent, at  
  
length awakened the authorities of that state to the truth, and then pro-.  
duced the-same promptitude and energy of which the neighbouring state  
had set the example. Under an act of their legislature of December 23,  
militia was instantly ordered to different important points, and measures  
taken for doing whatever could yet be done. Some boats (accounts vary  
irom five to double or treble that number) and persons (differently estimated  
from one to three hundred) had in the mean time passed the falls of Ohio,  
to rendezvous at the mouth of Cumberland with others expected down that  
river. Not apprised til very late that any boats were building on Cum-  
berland, the etiect of the proclamation has been trusted to for some time in  
the state of Tennessee. But on the 19th of December similar communica-  
tions and instructions, with those to the neighbouring states, were dis-  
patehed by express to the governour, and a general ofhcer of the western  
division of the state, and on the 23d of December our confidential agent left  
Frankfort for Nashville to put into activity the means of that state also.  
But by information received yesterday, I learn that on the 22d of December  
Mr. Burr descended the Cumberland with two boats, merely of accommo-  
dation, carrying with him from that state no quota towards his unlawful en-  
terprize. Whether after the arrival of the proclamation, of the orders, or  
of our agent, any exertion which could be made by that state, or the orders  
of the governour of Kentucky, for calling out the militia at the mouth of  
Cumbcriard, would be in time to arrest these boats, and those from the  
  
falls of Ohio is still doubtful.  
  
On the whole, the fugitives from the Ohio, with their associates from  
Cumberland, or any other pkice in that quarter, cannot threaten serious dan-  
ger to the city of New-Orleans.  
  
By the same express of December 19, orders were sent tothe governours  
of Orleans and Mississippi, supplementary to those which had been given on  
the 25th of November, to hold the militia of their territories in readiness to  
«o-operate for their defence with the regular troops and armed vessels then  
under command of Gen. Wilkinson. Great alarm indeed was excited at  
Wew-Orieans by the exaggerated accounts of Mr. Burr, disseminated through  
his emissaries, of the armies and navies he was to assemble there. Gen.  
Wilkinson had arrived there himself on the 24th of November, and had im-  
mediately put into activity the resources of the place for the purpose of its  
defence, and on the 10th of December he was joined by his troops from the  
  
Sabine. Great zeal was shewn by the inhabitants generally ; the merchants  
of the place readily agreeing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices  
for manning the armed vessels with their seamen ; andthe other citizens  
mamifesting unequivocal fidelity to the union, and a spirit of determined re-  
sistance to their expected assailants,

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
Surmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive aid from  
certain foreign powers. But these surmises are without proof or probabil.  
ity. The wisdom of the measures santioned by congress at its last session,  
has placed us in the paths of peace and justice with the only powers with  
whom we had any differences ; and nothing has happened since, which  
makes it either their interest or ours to pursue another course. No change  
of measures has taken place on our part, none ought to take place at this  
time. With the one, friendly arrangement was proposed, and the law,  
deemed necessary on the failure of that, was suspended to give time for a  
fair trialof the issue. With the same power, friendly arrangement is now  
proceeding, under good expectations, and the same law, deemed necessary  
on failure of that, is still suspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue.  
With the other negociation was in like manner preferred, and provisional  
Measures only taken to meet the event of rupture. While therefore we do  
not deflect in the slightest degree from the course we then assumed, and  
are still pursuing, with mutual consent, to restore a good understanding, we  
are not to impute to them practices as irreconcileable to interest as to good  
faith, and changing necessarily the relations of peace and justice between  
us to those of war. These surmises are therefere to be imputed to the  
vauntings of the author of this enterprize, to multiply his partizans, by mag-  
nifying the belief of his prospects and support.  
  
By letters from General Wilkinson, of the 14th and 18th of December,  
which came to hand two days after the date of the resolution of the House  
of Representatives, that is to say, on the morning of the 18th inst. I received  
the important affidavit, a copy of which I now communicate, with extracts  
of so much of the letters as come within the scope of the regolution. By  
these it will be seen that of three of the principal emissaries of Mr. Burr,  
whom the General had caused to be apprehended, one had been liberated by  
Habeas Corpus, and two others, being those particularly employed in the  
endeavour to corrupt the General and army of the United States, have been  
embarked by him for ports inthe Atlantick states, probably on the consid-  
eration that an impartial trial could not be expected during the present agi-  
tations of New-Orleans, and that that city was not as yet a safe place of  
confinement. As soon as these persons shall arrive, they will be delivered  
to the custody of the law, and left to such course of trial, both as to place  
and process, as its functionaries may direct. The presence of the highest  
judicial authorities, to be assembled at this place within a few days, the  
means of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings here than elsewhere,  
and the aid of the executive means, should the judges have occasion to use  
them, render it equally desirable for the criminal, as for the publick, that,  
being already removed from. the place where’they were apprehended,  
the first regular arrest should take place here, and the course of proceedings  
receive here their proper direction.

&quot; * he General&#x27;s (Wilkinson’s) letter which came  
to hand on thc2-rth November, as has hecn men­  
tioned, and some other information received a few  
•lays earlier, when brought together, developed  
: Burr’s general designs, different parts of w hich  
only, hail been revealed to ditrereut informants. It  
’appeared that he contemplated two distinct objects,  
which might he carried on either jointly or sepa­  
rately, and either the one or the other, first, as cir­  
cumstances should direct. One of these was the  
severance of the union of these States, by the Al­  
leghany mountains; tho other an attack on Mexi­  
“0. A third object was provided, merely ostensi­  
ble, to wit, the settlement of a pretended pur­  
chase ot a tract of country on the Washita, claim­  
ed by a Baron lfistrop. This was to serve as tho  
pretext tor all his preparations, an allurement for  
’-&#x27;iich followers as really wished to&#x27;acquire settle­  
ments in that countiy, and a cover, under which a  
retreat, in the event of a final discomfiture ot both  
branches of his real design.  
“lie found at once, that the attachment of the

I w ith the consent ol its inhabitants, and that his re­  
sources were inadequate as yet,to effect it by force.  
[ He took his course then at once, determined to  
; seize on New Orleans, plunder the hank there,pos­  
sess himsell of the military and naval stores, ami

object, all Iris means and preparations were now

“ Some time in the latter part of September I re­  
ceived intimations that designs were in agitation  
in the western countiry, unlawful and unfriendly  
to the peace of the Union, and that the prime  
mover in these was Aaron Burr, heretofore dis  
tinguished by the favor of his country. The  
grounds of these intimations Leing inconclusive,  
the objects uncertain, and the fidelity of that  
country known to be firm, the only measure tak­  
en was, to urge the informants to use their best  
endei vors to get furtlier insight into the designs  
and procecdings of the suspected persons and  
to coutinunicate them to me.”  
And again he says :—  
  
“The General&#x27;s [Wilkinsen’s] letter ywhich  
come to Lt nd on the 25th November, as has been  
mentioned, and some other information received  
a sow days carlier, when brought together, de­  
veloped Burr’s general designs, diffcrent paris  
of which only had been revealed to different in­  
formants. It eppeared that he contemplated two  
distinet objecis, which might be earried on either  
Jointly or separa‘ely, and either the one or the  
viber, first, as circumstances shouldedirect. One  
of these was the s :verance of the union of these  
States by the Aliegny mountains ; the other an  
attack on Mexico. A third object was provided,  
merely ostensible, to wit, the settlement ofa pre­  
tended purchase of a tract of country on the  
Washiia, claiiced by a .Baron Bastrop. This was  
to serve as the pretext f:r all his preparations, an  
alluremnent for sueh folla wers as really wished to  
acquire scitlements in tha&quot; country, and a cover  
under whieh a retreat in {\re eveni of a final dis­  
comfiture of both branches s &quot; his real design.  
“He found at once that th attachment of the  
Wesiern Country to the present union was not  
to be shaken ; that its dissolution could not be  
aficeted with the consent of its inhabitants, and  
that Lis resources were inadequute, as yet, to et­  
fect it by force. He tock his counn s then at once,  
determined to seize en New-Oplear. - nlunder the  
bank there, possess himselt oif %ﬁe matitary and’  
naval stores, and proeeed on his expudition to  
Mexico ; and o this object zll his means and pre­  
parations were now directed. Ile coliecivd from  
all the quarters where himself or his agents pa.s­  
sessed influence, all the ardent, resiless, des­  
perate und disaffected persons who were ready  
for any enterprize amalagous to their characters.  
He seduced good and we!l meaning citizens, some  
by assurances that he possessed the confidence  
of the government, and was acting under its se­  
cret patronage ; a pretence which procured some  
credit from the state of our differences with: Spain,  
and others by offers of land in Bastrop’s claim on  
the Washita.  
“This was the state of my information of his  
proceedings, about the last of November ; at  
which time, therefore, it was first possible to take  
specific measures to meet them.—The prociama­  
tion .of November the 27th, two days after the  
receipt of Gen. Wilkiuson’s informnation, was

fathers has enabled the government of the union  
to maintain its authority and to preserve the in­  
tegrity ot the natiou at the most critical periods  
of history. My predecessors in the executive of­  
fice have relied on this great principle. It was  
on this principle that President Washington sup­  
pressed the whisky rebellion in Pennsylvania in  
1794. In 1806, on the same principle,  
PRESIDENT JEFFERSON BROKE UP THE BURR CON­  
SPIRACY  
by issuing orders for the cmnloyment of such  
force, either of the regulars or of the militia, and  
by such proceeding of the civil authorities as  
might enable them to suppress effectually the  
further progress of the enterprise independent  
of state authority, and if need be, against the hos  
tile state governments. It should remain embod­  
ied in our statutes unimpaired, as it lias been  
from the very origin of the government. It should  
be regarded as hardly less valuable or less sacred  
than the provision of the constitution itself
