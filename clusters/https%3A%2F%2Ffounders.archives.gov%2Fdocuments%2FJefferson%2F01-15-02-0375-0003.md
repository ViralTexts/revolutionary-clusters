Paris September 6. 1789.  
  
I sit down to write to you without knowing by what occasion I shall send my letter. I do it because a subject comes into my head which I would wish to develope a little more than is practicable in the hurry of the moment of making up general dispatches.  
The question Whether one generation of men has a right to bind another, seems never to have been started either on this or our side of the water. Yet it is a question of such consequences as not only to merit decision, but place also, among the fundamental principles of every government. The course of reflection in which we are immersed here on the elementary principles of society has presented this question to my mind; and that no such obligation can be so transmitted I think very capable of proof.—I set out on this ground, which I suppose to be self evident, ‘that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living’: that the dead have neither powers nor rights over it. The portion occupied by any individual ceases to be his when himself ceases to be, and reverts to the society. If the society has formed no rules for the appropriation of it’s lands in severality, it will be  taken by the first occupants. These will generally be the wife and children of the decedent. If they have formed rules of appropriation, those rules may give it to the wife and children, or to some one of them, or to the legatee of the deceased. So they may give it to his creditor. But the child, the legatee, or creditor takes it, not by any natural right, but by a law of the society of which they are members, and to which they are subject. Then no man can, by natural right, oblige the lands he occupied, or the persons who succeed him in that occupation, to the paiment of debts contracted by him. For if he could, he might, during his own life, eat up the usufruct of the lands for several generations to come, and then the lands would belong to the dead, and not to the living, which would be the reverse of our principle.  
What is true of every member of the society individually, is true of them all collectively, since the rights of the whole can be no more than the sum of the rights of the individuals.—To keep our ideas clear when applying them to a multitude, let us suppose a whole generation of men to be born on the same day, to attain mature age on the same day, and to die on the same day, leaving a succeeding generation in the moment of attaining their mature age all together. Let the ripe age be supposed of 21. years, and their period of life 34. years more, that being the average term given by the bills of mortality to persons who have already attained 21. years of age. Each successive generation would, in this way, come on, and go off the stage at a fixed moment, as individuals do now. Then I say the earth belongs to each of these generations, during it’s course, fully, and in their own right. The 2d. generation receives it clear of the debts and incumberances of the 1st. the 3d of the 2d. and so on. For if the 1st. could charge it with a debt, then the earth would belong to the dead and not the living generation. Then no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of it’s own existence. At 21. years of age they may bind themselves and their lands for 34. years to come: at 22. for 33: at 23. for 32. and at 54. for one year only; because these are the terms of life which remain to them at those respective epochs.—But a material difference must be noted between the succession of an individual, and that of a whole generation. Individuals are parts only of a society, subject to the laws of the whole. These laws may appropriate the portion of and occupied by a decedent to his creditor rather than to any other, or to his child on condition he satisfies the creditor. But when a whole generation,  that is, the whole society dies, as in the case we have supposed, and another generation or society succeeds, this forms a whole, and there is no superior who can give their territory to a third society, who may have lent money to their predecessors beyond their faculties of paying.  
What is true of a generation all arriving to self-government on the same day, and dying all on the same day, is true of those in a constant course of decay and renewal, with this only difference. A generation coming in and going out entire, as in the first case, would have a right in the 1st. year of their self-dominion to contract a debt for 33. years, in the 10th. for 24. in the 20th. for 14. in the 30th. for 4. whereas generations, changing daily by daily deaths and births, have one constant term, beginning at the date of their contract, and ending when a majority of those of full age at that date shall be dead. The length of that term may be estimated from the tables of mortality, corrected by the circumstances of climate, occupation &amp;c. peculiar to the country of the contractors. Take, for instance, the table of M. de Buffon wherein he states 23,994 deaths, and the ages at which they happened. Suppose a society in which 23,994 persons are born every year, and live to the ages stated in this table. The conditions of that society will be as follows. 1st. It will consist constantly of 617,703. persons of all ages. 2ly. Of those living at any one instant of time, one half will be dead in 24. years 8. months. 3dly. 10,675 will arrive every year at the age of 21. years complete. 4ly. It will constantly have 348,417 persons of all ages above 21. years. 5ly. And the half of those of 21. years and upwards living at any one instant of time will be dead in 18. years 8. months, or say 19. years as the nearest integral number. Then 19. years is the term beyond which neither the representatives of a nation, nor even the whole nation itself assembled, can validly extend a debt.  
To render this conclusion palpable by example, suppose that Louis XIV. and XV. had contracted debts in the name of the French nation to the amount of 10,000 milliards of livres, and that the whole had been contracted in Genoa. The interest of this sum would be 500. milliards, which is said to be the whole rent roll or nett proceeds of the territory of France. Must the present generation of men have retired from the territory in which nature produced them, and ceded it to the Genoese creditors? No. They have the same rights over the soil on which they were produced, as the preceding generations had. They derive these rights not from their  predecessors, but from nature. They then and their soil are by nature clear of the debts of their predecessors.  
Again suppose Louis XV. and his cotemporary generation had said to the money-lenders of Genoa, give us money that we may eat, drink, and be merry in our day; and on condition you will demand no interest till the end of 19. years you shall then for ever after receive an annual interest of 12 ⅝ per cent. The money is lent on these conditions, is divided among the living, eaten, drank, and squandered. Would the present generation be obliged to apply the produce of the earth and of their labour to replace their dissipations? Not at all.  
I suppose that the recieved opinion, that the public debts of one generation devolve on the next, has been suggested by our seeing habitually in private life that he who succeeds to lands is required to pay the debts of his ancestor or testator: without considering that this requisition is municipal only, not moral; flowing from the will of the society, which has found it convenient to appropriate lands, become vacant by the death of their occupant, on the condition of a paiment of his debts: but that between society and society, or generation and generation, there is no municipal obligation, no umpire but the law of nature. We seem not to have percieved that, by the law of nature, one generation is to another as one independant nation to another.  
The interest of the national debt of France being in fact but a two thousandth part of it’s rent roll, the paiment of it is practicable enough: and so becomes a question merely of honor, or of expediency. But with respect to future debts, would it not be wise and just for that nation to declare, in the constitution they are forming, that neither the legislature, nor the nation itself, can validly contract more debt than they may pay within their own age, or within the term of 19. years? And that all future contracts will be deemed void as to what shall remain unpaid at the end of 19. years from their date? This would put the lenders, and the borrowers also, on their guard. By reducing too the faculty of borrowing within it’s natural limits, it would bridle the spirit of war, to which too free a course has been procured by the inattention of money-lenders to this law of nature, that succeeding generations are not responsible for the preceding.  
On similar ground it may be proved that no society can make a  perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation. They may manage it then, and what proceeds from it, as they please, during their usufruct. They are masters too of their own persons, and consequently may govern them as they please. But persons and property make the sum of the objects of government. The constitution and the laws of their predecessors extinguished then in their natural course with those who gave them being. This could preserve that being till it ceased to be itself, and no longer. Every constitution then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right.—It may be said that the succeeding generation exercising in fact the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law had been expressly limited to 19 years only. In the first place, this objection admits the right, in proposing an equivalent. But the power of repeal is not an equivalent. It might be indeed if every form of government were so perfectly contrived that the will of the majority could always be obtained fairly and without impediment. But this is true of no form. The people cannot assemble themselves. Their representation is unequal and vicious. Various checks are opposed to every legislative proposition. Factions get possession of the public councils. Bribery corrupts them. Personal interests lead them astray from the general interests of their constituents: and other impediments arise so as to prove to every practical man that a law of limited duration is much more manageable than one which needs a repeal.  
This principle that the earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead, is of very extensive application and consequences, in every country, and most especially in France. It enters into the resolution of the questions Whether the nation may change the descent of lands holden in tail? Whether they may change the appropriation of lands given antiently to the church, to hospitals, colleges, orders of chivalry, and otherwise in perpetuity? Whether they may abolish the charges and privileges attached on lands, including the whole catalogue ecclesiastical and feudal? It goes to hereditary offices, authorities and jurisdictions; to hereditary orders, distinctions and appellations; to perpetual monopolies in commerce, the arts and sciences; with a long train of et ceteras: and it renders the question of reimbursement a question of generosity and not of right. In all these cases, the legislature of the day could authorize such appropriations and establishments for their own time, but no longer; and the present holders, even where they, or their ancestors, have purchased,  are in the case of bonâ fide purchasers of what the seller had no right to convey.  
Turn this subject in your mind, my dear Sir, and particularly as to the power of contracting debts; and develope it with that perspicuity and cogent logic so peculiarly yours. Your station in the councils of our country gives you an opportunity of producing it to public consideration, of forcing it into discussion. At first blush it may be rallied, as a theoretical speculation: but examination will prove it to be solid and salutary. It would furnish matter for a fine preamble to our first law for appropriating the public revenue; and it will exclude at the threshold of our new government the contagious and ruinous errors of this quarter of the globe, which have armed despots with means, not sanctioned by nature, for binding in chains their fellow men. We have already given in example one effectual check to the Dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from the Executive to the Legislative body, from those who are to spend to those who are to pay. I should be pleased to see this second obstacle held out by us also in the first instance. No nation can make a declaration against the validity of long-contracted debts so disinterestedly as we, since we do not owe a shilling which may not be paid with ease, principal and interest, within the time of our own lives.—Establish the principle also in the new law to be passed for protecting copyrights and new inventions

be self-evident, that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living ;  
that the dead have neither powers nor rights over it. The

&#x27;he PTais, September 6, 1789.  
To James Madison : ...  
d, Dear Sir-I sit down to write to without know­  
ing by what occasion I shall send lter. I do it,  
bel because a subject comes into my had, which I would  
d, wish to develop a little more than is practicable in the  
hurry of the moment of making up general dispatches  
s; The question, whether one generationof men has a  
gs right to bind another, seems never to have been started  
on this or our side of the water. Yet it is a question  
of such consequences as not only to merit decision, but  
place also among the fundamental principles of- every  
n- government. Te course of reflection in which we are  
ts mmersed here, on the elementary principles of soci  
ety, has presented this question to my mind; and that&#x27;  
le. no such obligation can be so transmitted, I think very  
capable of proof. I set out on this ground, which I  
he supose to be self-evident, that the earth belongs in  
or sufruct to the living: that the dead have neither pow­  
ers nor rights over it. The portion occupied by any  
individual ceases to be his when himself ceases to be,  
te and reverts to the society. If the society has formed  
in no rules for the appropriation of its lands in severalty,  
ve it will be taken by the first occupants, and these will  
to generally be the wife and children, or to some one of  
he them, or to the legatee of the deceased. So they may  
d give it to his creditor. But the child, the legatee or  
Screditor, takes it not by natural right, but by a law of  
the societyof which he is a member, and to which he  
is subject. Then, no man can, by natural right, oblige  
rs the lands he occupied, or the persons who succeed him  
to in that occupation, to the payment of debts contracted  
ay by him. For if he could, he might during his own life,  
id eat up the usufruct of the lands for several generations  
to to come; and then the lands would belong to the dead,  
and not to the living, which is the reverse of our prin­  
of ciPWhat is true of every member of the society, indi-&#x27;  
o- vidually, is true of them all collectively; since the  
rights of the whole can be no more than the sum of the  
er rights of the individuals. To keep. our ideas clear  
,c- when applying them to a multitude, let us suppose a  
whole generation of men to be born on the same day,  
to attain matgre age on the same day, and to die on  
the same day, leaving a succeeding generation in the  
moment of attaining their mature age, all together.  
Let the ripe age be supposed of twenty-one years, and  
ih their period of life thirty-tour years more, that being  
at the average term given by the bills of mortality to per­  
d- sons of twenty-one years of age. Each successive gen­  
d- eration would, in this way, come and go off the stage  
- at a fixed moment, as individuals do now. Then I say,  
the earth belongs to each of these generations during  
its course, fully and in its own right. The second gen­  
eration receives it clear of the debts and incumbrances  
to of the first, the third of the second, and so on. For if  
; the first could charge it with a debt, then the earth  
u- would belong to the dead and not to the living genera­  
re tion. Then, no generation can contract debts greater  
r- than can be paid during the course of its own exis­  
in tence. At twenty-one years of age, they may bind  
it themselves and ther lands for thirty-four years to  
come; at twenty-three, for thirty-two; and at fifty­  
at four, for one year only; because these are the terms  
0 of life which remain to them at the respective epochs.  
re But a material difference must be noted, between the  
ir succession of an individual and that of a whole genera­  
is tion. Individuals are parts only of a society, subject  
d to the laws of the whole. These laws may appropri­  
ate the portion of land occupied by a decedent, to his  
creditor rather than to any other, or to his child, on  
condition he satisfies the creditor. But when a whole  
Y generation, that is, the whole society, dies, as in the  
I. case we have supposed, and another generation or so­  
et ciety succeeds, this forms a whole, and there is no su­  
.I perior who can give their territory to a third society,  
who may have lent money to their predecessors, be­  
s yond theirfaculties of paying.  
What is true of generations stcceeding one another  
n at fixed epochs, as has been supposed for clearer con­  
ception, is true for those renewed daily, as in the actual  
e course of nature. As a majority of the contracting gen­  
s eration will continue in being thirty-four years, and a  
new majority will then comne into possession, the for­  
mer may extend their engagements to that term, and  
no longer. The conclusion, then, is, that neither th

lidly engage debts beyond what they  
may pay in their own time, that is to say, within thirty­  
e four years from the date of the engagement.  
it To render this conclusion palpable, suppose that  
, Louis the XIV. and XV. had contracted debts in the  
si name of the French nation, to the amount of ten thou­  
sand milliards, and that the whole had been contracted  
in Holland. The interest of this sum would be five  
hundred milliards, which is the whole rent-roll or net  
proceeds of the territory of France. Must the present  
generation of men have retired from the territory in  
which nature produces them, and ceded it to the Dutch  
creditors? No; they have the same rights over the  
soil on which they were produced, as the preceding  
generations had. They derive these rights not from  
them, but from nature. They, then, and their soil are,  
I, by nature, clear of the debts of their predecessors. To  
present this in another point of view, suppose Louis  
e XV. and his cotemporary generation, had said to the  
Smoney lenders of Holland, give us money, that we may  
- eat, drink, and be merryin our day; and on condition  
you will demand no interest till the end of thirty-four  
d years, you shall then, forever after, receive an annual  
interest of fifteen per cent. The money is lent on these  
Sconditions, is divided among the people, eaten, drunk  
and squandered. Would the present generation be  
obliged to apply the produce of the earth and of their  
labor, to replace their dissipations? Not at all.  
I suppose that the received opinion, that the public  
debts of one generation devolve on the next, has been  
. suggested by our seeing habitually, in private life, that  
he who succeeds to lands is required to pay the debts  
of his predecessor; without considering that this re­  
quisition is municipal only, not moral, flowing from  
the will ofthe society, which has found it convenient  
to appropriate the lands of a decedent on the condition  
Sof a payment of his debts: but that between society  
and society, or generation and generation, there is no  
municipal obligation, no umpire but the law of nature.  
The interest of the national debt of France being, in  
fact, but a two-thousandth part ofits rent-roll, the pay­  
ment of it is practicable enough; and so becomes a  
question merely of honor or of expediency. But with  
respect to future debts, would it not be wise and just  
for that nation to declare in the constitution they are  
I forming, that neither the legislature nor the nation it­  
self, can validly contract more debt than they may pay  
- within their own age, or within the term of thirty-four  
years? And that all future contracts shall be deemed  
void, as to what shall remain unpaid at the end of  
thirty-four years from their date ? This would put the  
lenders, and the borrowers also, on their guard. By  
reducing too, the faculty of borrowing within its natu­  
rat limits, it would bridle the spirit of war, to which  
too free a course has been procured by the inattention  
Sof money lenders to this law of nature, that succeeding I  
- generations are not responsible for the preceding.  
On similar ground it may be proved, that no society  
can make aperpetual constitution, or even a perpetual  
law. The earth belongs alway to the living generation :  
Sthey may manage it, then, and what proceeds from it,  
as they please, during their usufruct. They are mas­  
Sters, too, of their own persons, and consequently may  
govern them as they please. But persons and prop­  
Serty make the sum of the objects of government. The  
constitution and the laws of their predecessors are ex­  
Stinguishedthen, in their natuaral course, with those  
whose will gave them being. This could preserve that  
being, till it ceased to be itself, and no longer. Every  
constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at  
the end of thirty-four years. If it be enforced longer,  
it is an act of force and not of right. It may be said,  
that the succeeding generation exercising,-in fact, the  
power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the con­  
stitution or law had been expressly limited to thirty­  
fouryears only. In the first place, this objection ad­  
mitsthe right, in proposing an equivalent. But the  
power of repeal is not an equivalent. It might be, in­  
deed, if every form of government were so perfectly  
contrived, that the willof the majority could always be  
obtained, fairly and without impediment. But this is  
true of no form. The people cannot assemble them­  
selves; their representation is unequal.and vicious.  
- Various checks are opposed to every legislative prop­  
osition. Factions get possession of the public coun­  
cils, bribery corrupts them, personal interests lead  
them astray from the general interests of their con­  
stituents; and other impediments arise, so as to prove  
to every pract:cal man, that a law of limited duration  
is much more manageable than one which needs a re­  
I peal.  
  
tpeal.  
This principle, that the earth belongsto the living  
and not-to the dead, is of very extensive application  
f and consequences in every country, and most espe­  
t cially in France. It enters into the resolution of the  
questions, whether the nation may change the descent  
of lands holden in tail; whether they may change the  
appropriation of lands anciently to the church, to hos­  
pitals, colleges, orders of chivalry, and otherwise in  
perpetuity; whether they may abolish the charges and  
privileges attached on lands, including the whole cata­  
logue, ecclesiastical and feudal; it goes to hereditary  
offces, authorities and jurisdictions, to hereditary or­  
ders, distinctions and appellations, to perpetual mo­  
noplies in commerce, the arts or sciences, with a long  
train ofet ceteras; and it renders the question of reinbt  
bursement, a question of generosity and not of right.  
In all these cases, the legislature of the day could an­  
thorise such appropriations and establishments for  
their own time, but no longer; and the present hold­  
ers, even where they or their ancestors have purchased,  
are in the case of bonafidepurchasers of what the sel­  
ler had no right convey.

Svelop it with that cogent logic which is so particularly

In a letter to James Madison, dated Paris, Sep-  
tember 6, 1789, Thomas Jefferson says: “* The ques-

to bind another, seems never to have been started

a question of such consequence as not only to

his creditor. But the child, the legatee or creditor  
takes it not by natural right, but by a law of the

oblige the lands he occupied, or the persons who

might, during his own life, eat up the usufruct of

the creation and validity of public debts,

Mr. Jefferson believed that no public  
debt should exist longer than one gen

tracted the debt should pay. This was  
a favorite idea with him, which was,  
however, controverted by James Mad

that this principle should be incorpo

. Our  
laws as a people have always been  
against monopoly.   
Jefferson waged war on the en­  
tailed estates of*Virginia,broke down  
the monopoly and threw the lands on  
the markets so that each idividual  
should have a fair chance to buy a  
home. Isn’t that right? [Great  
cheering.]   
Hear what Jefferson says. In a  
letter from Paris in 1789—written  
to Mr. Madison. He writes:   
The earth belongs in usufruct to the  
living.   
Analyze this sentence, and you  
will see it means precisely what we  
say in our platform. “The land is  
the heritage of all the people.”  
[Cheers.]   
Further, he says in the same let­  
ter:   
The earth belongs always to the living  
generation. They may manage it, and  
what proceeds from it, as they please  
during their usufruct.   
Further in the same letter he  
says:.   
The principle that the earth belongs to  
the living and not to the dead, is of very  
extensive application and consequences  
in every country.
