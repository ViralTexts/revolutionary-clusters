e 170 near the bottom “We must consider what kind of people they were and are that have and do transport themselves to our Foreign Plantations” New England as every one knows, was originally inhabited, and hath Since been Successively replenished by a Sort of People called Puritans, who could not conform to the Ecclesiastical Laws of England; but being wearied with Church Censures and Persecutions were forced to quit their Fathers Land, to find out New Habitations as many of them did in Germany and Holland, as well as at New England And had there not been a New England found for Some of them Germany and Holland probably had received the rest: but old England to be Sure would have lost them all.”  
“Virginia and Barbadoes were first peopled by a Sort of to loose migrant people, vicious, and destitute of means to live at home (being either unfit for labour, or such as could find none to employ themselves about, or had so misbehaved themselves by whoring thieving, or other debauchery, that none would set them on work) which Merchants, and Masters of Ships by their Agents (or spirits as they were called,) gathered up about the Streets of London, and other places, cloathed and transported, to be employed upon plantations; and these I say were such as, had there been no English foreign plantation in the world, could probably never have lived at home, to do service for their Country, but must have come to be hanged, or starved, or died untimely of some of those miserable diseases that proceed from want, and vice; or else have sold themselves for Soldiers to be knocked on the head, or starved in the quarrels of our neighbours, as many thousands of brave Englishmen were in the Low Countries, as also in the wars of Germany, France &amp; Sweden &amp;c; or else, if they could by begging or otherwise, arrive to the stock of 2 s. 6 d. to waft them over to Holland, become servants to the Dutch, who refuse none.”  
“But the principal grouth and increase of the aforesaid Plantations of Virginia and Barbadoes, happened in or immediately after, our late civil Wars, when the worsted party by the fate of War, being deprived of their Estates, and having, Some of them never been bred to labour, and others of them made unfit for it by the lazy habit of a Soldiers life, there wanting means to maintain them all abroad with his Majesty, many of them betook themselves to the aforesaid plantations; and great numbers of Scotch Soldiers of his Majesty’s Army, after Worcester, a Short Fight, were by then prevailing Powers voluntarily Sent thither.”  
“Another great Swarm or Accession of new Inhabitants to the aforesaid Plantations, as also to New England, Jamaica, and all other his Majesty’s Plantations in the West Indies, ensued upon his Majesty’s Restoration, when the former prevailing Party, being by a divine hand of Providence brought under, the Army disbanded many Officers displaced and all the new purchasers of publick Titles dispossessed of their pretended lands, Estates &amp;c many became impoverished and destitute of Employment; and therefore Such as could find no Way of living at home, and Some who feared the re-establishment of the Ecclesiastical Laws under which they could not live were forced to transport themselves, or sell themselves for a few Years to be transported by Others, to the foreign English Plantations. The constant Supply that the said Plantations have Since had, hath been Such vagrant loose People, as I have before mentioned, picked Up, especially about the Streets of London and Westminster, and Malefactors condemned for Crimes for which by the Law they deserved to die; and Some of those People called Quakers, banished for meeting on pretense of Religious Worship.”  
“Now, if from the premises it be duely considered, what kind of Persons those have been, by whom our Plantations have at all times been replenished, I suppose it will appear, that Such they have been, and under such Circumstances that if his Majesty had had no foreign Plantations, to which they might have resorted, England however must have lost them

To reſolve this Queſtion we mult conhder what  
Kind of People they were, and are, that have and  
do tranſport themſelves to our Foreign Plantations.  
  
New-England (as every one knows) was originally  
inhabited, and hath ſince ſucceſſively becn reple-  
niſh&#x27;d, by a Sort of People call&#x27;d Puritans, which  
could not conform to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of Eng-  
land; but being wearied with Church Cenſures and  
Perſecutions, were forc&#x27;d to quit their Father&#x27;s Land,  
to find out new Habitations, as many of them did in  
Germany and Holland, as well as New- England ; and

of them, Germany and Holland probably had re-  
ceiv&#x27;d the reſt: But old England to be ſure had loſt  
them all. | | |  
Virginia and Barbadoes were firſt peopled by a Sort  
of looſe vagrant People, vicious and deſtitute of  
Means to live at Home (being either unfit for Labour,  
or ſuch as could find none to employ themſelves a-  
bout, or had ſo miſbehav&#x27;d themſelves by Whoring,  
Thieving, or other Debauchery, that none would

Ships by their Agents (or Spirits as they were call&#x27;d)  
gather&#x27;d up about the Streets of London and other  
Places, cloath&#x27;d and tranſported to be employ&#x27;d up-  
on Plantations; and theſe, I ſay, were ſuch as, had  
there been no Engliſb Foreign Plantation in the  
World, could probably never have liv&#x27;d at Home to  
do Service for their Countrey, but muſt have come  
to be hang&#x27;d or ſtarv&#x27;d, or died untimely of ſome of  
thoſe miſerable Diſeaſes, that proceed from Want  
and Vice; or elſe have fold themſelves for Soldiers,  
to be knock&#x27;d on the Head, or ſtary&#x27;d, in the Quar-

Engliſhmen were in the low Countries, as alſo in the  
Wars of Germany, France, and Sweden, &amp;c. or elſe  
if they could by begging, or otherwiſe, arrive to the  
Stock of half a Crown to waft them over to Hol-
