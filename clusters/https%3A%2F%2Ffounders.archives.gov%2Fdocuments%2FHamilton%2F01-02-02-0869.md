 the midst of my letter, I was interrupted by a scene that shocked me more than any thing I have met with—the discovery of a treason of the deepest dye. The object was to sacrifice West Point. General Arnold had sold himself to André for this purpose. The latter came but in disguise and in returning to New York was detected. Arnold hearing of it immediately fled to the enemy. I went in persuit of him but was much too late, and I could hardly regret the disappointment, when on my return, I saw an amiable woman frantic with distress for the loss of a husband she tenderly loved—a traitor to his country and to his fame, a disgrace to his connections. It was the most affecting scene I ever was witness to. She for a considerable time intirely lost her senses. The General went up to see her and she upbraided him with being in a plot to murder her child; one moment she raved; another she melted into tears; sometimes she pressed her infant to her bosom and lamented its fate occasioned by the imprudence of its father in a manner that would have pierced insensibility itself. All the sweetness of beauty, all the loveliness of innocence, all the tenderness of a wife and all the fondness of a mother showed themselves in her appearance and conduct. We have every reason to believe she was intirely unacquainted with the plan, and that her first knowlege of it was when Arnold went to tell her he must banish himself from his Country and from her forever. She instantly fell into a convulsion and he left her in that situation.  
  
This morning she is more composed. I paid her a visit and endeavoured to sooth her by every method in my power, though you may imagine she is not easily to be consoled. Added to her other distresses, She is very apprehensive the resentment of her country will fall upon her (who is only unfortunate) for the guilt of her husband. I have tried to persuade her, her apprehensions are ill founded; but she has too many proofs of the illiberality of the state to which she belongs to be convinced. She received us in bed, with every circumstance that could interest our sympathy. Her sufferings were so eloquent that I wished myself her brother, to have a right to become her defender. As it is, I have entreated her to enable me to give her proofs of my friendship.  
Could I forgive Arnold for sacrificing his honor reputation and duty I could not forgive him for acting a part that must have forfieted the esteem of so fine a woman. At present she almost forgets his crime in his misfortune, and her horror at the guilt of the traitor is lost in her love of the man. But a virtuous mind cannot long esteem a base one, and time will make her despise, if it cannot make her hate.

[ &quot; Arnold heitring of the plot being detected, im­  
mediately fled lo the enemy. I went in pursuit   
of laimi,&#x27; but was much too late, and, could hardly I   
regret the disappointment. when, on, my return, I   
saw an amiable woman frantic with distress for   
the less of at-husband she tenderly loved—a trail   
for to his country and to his fame—a: disgrace to   
his connections: ft was the most allecting scene I   
ever was witness to., She for a considerable time   
entirely lost herself The General (Washington)   
went up to see her, and she upbraided-him with   
being in a plot to murder her child. One moment   
ehe rayed, *another. she incited into tears. Some­  
*nes she pressed her infant to her bosom, and la­  
mented its fate, occasioned by the imprudence of   
its father, in ,a manner that would have pier fed in:.   
Sensibility itself. All the sweetness of beauty-7,   
all the loveliness of innocence—all the tenderness   
&quot;Ora wife—and all the fondness of a mother, show­  
ed themselves in her appearance and conduct.   
We have every reason to believe that pho was.en­  
eirely &#x27;unacquainted with the plan; that the first   
knowledge of it was when Arnold went to tell her   
he mist banish himself from his country and ftoni   
her forever. She immediately fell into a coniml­  
sion, and he left her &#x27;in that condition. This   
morning ehe is more composed. &#x27;I paid her a visit   
and endeavored to soothe her by every method in   
my power, though you may imagine she is not   
easily to be consoled, Added to her other distress­  
esi. she is very apprehensive the resentment of her   
enntrY will . fall upon her (who is only unfort-   
~.   
nate) for the guilt of her husbana.   
penm   
Will not be c.,r ado that her lea &quot;ih av e tried   
to

einced. &#x27;She received us in bed,   
with ;:cry circumstance that interests our sympa­  
thy; and her sufferings were so eloquent, that I

the mind of this daughter of the Revolution; the  
welfare of her country was near her heart, she felt  
deeply for the misguided Andre, and sympathized  
in the afflictions which had befallen the lovely wife  
of the traitor Arnold. In her correspondence with  
Captain Hamilton, she often made anxious inquiries  
as to the supposed result of this unhappy affair,  
which drew from him the following letter, illustra-  
tive of the earnest of his affectionate and generous  
nature; in which he says :—  
  
“ Arnold, hearing of the plot being detected, im-  
mediately fled to the enemy. I went in pursuit of  
him, but was much too late, and could hardly regret  
the disappointment, when on my return I saw an  
amiable woman, frantic with distress for the loss  
of a husband she tenderly loved—a traitor to his  
country and to his fame—a disgrace to his con-  
nections; it was the most affecting scene I was  
ever witness to. She, for a considerable time,  
entirely lost herself. The general went up to see  
her, and she upbraided him with being in a plot  
to murder her child. One moment she raved; an-  
other she melted into tears. Sometimes she pressed  
her infant to her bosom, and lamented its fate, occa-  
sioned by the imprudence of its father, in a manner  
that would have pierced insensibility itself. All the  
sweetness of beauty, all the loveliness ofsinnocence,  
all the tenderness of a wife, and all the fondness of  
a mother, showed themselves in her appearance and  
conduct.  
  
“We have every reason to believe that she was  
entirely unacquainted with the plan, and that the  
first intimation of it was when Arnold went to teil  
her he must banish himself from his country, and  
from her forever.  
  
“This morning she is more composed. I paid  
her a visit, and endeavored to soothe her by every  
method in my power; though you may readily im-  
agine she is not easily to be consoled.  
  
“ Added to her other distresses, she is very appre-  
hensive the resentment of her country will fall  
upon her (who is only unfortunate) for the guilt  
of her husband. I have tried to persuade her thai  
her fears are ill-founded, but she will not be con-  
vineed. She received us in bed, with every circum-  
stance that would interest our sympathy; and her  
sufferings were so eloquent, that I wished myself  
her brother to have a right to become her de-  
  
fender. As it is, I have entreated her to enable me  
  
to give her proofs of my friendship. Could I for-  
give Arnold for sacrificing his honor, reputation,  
and duty, I could not forgive him for acting a part  
that must have forfeited the esteem of so fine a ;  
  
  
  
were  
  
  
  
eee  
  
  
  
an  
  
woman. At present, she almots forgets his crime in  
his misfortunes; and her horror at the guilt of the  
traitor is lost in her love of the man, But a virtu-  
ous mind cannot long esteem a base one; and time  
will make her despise, if it cannot make her hate.”
