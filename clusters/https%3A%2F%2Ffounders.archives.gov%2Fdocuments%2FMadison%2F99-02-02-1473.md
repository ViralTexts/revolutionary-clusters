Report on the University of Virginia  
  
We lay before our readers the following interesting View of the condition of the University of Virginia,  
submitted to the Legislature on Monday last:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Sir,  
 Richmond,13th December, 1828.  
  
  
I have the honor to lay before the General Assembly, the report adopted by the Rector and Visitors of the  
University of Virginia, at their meeting in July last, and received by me as President of the Literary Fund. I am, sir,  
with great respect, your most obedient servant,   
  
William B. Giles.  
The Honorable the Speaker of the House of Delegates.  
  
To the president and director of the literary fund.  
July 2[4], 1828.  
  
In obedience to the law, requiring that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia should make a  
Report, annually, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, (to be laid before the Legislature at their next  
succeeding meeting,) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the  
condition of the said University, the Rector and Visitors make the following REPORT:  
The provision, which requires that the Rector and Visitors should annually visit the University, for the  
purpose of enquiring into the proceedings and practices thereat, and of examining into the progress of the Students, was  
complied with by the stated yearly meeting, commencing on the 10th of July, the period of the Summer public examination.  
The Board continued their session until the 24th of the same month; a portion of their time being employed in attending,  
as had been desired by many of their fellow-citizens, the Convention at that time held in Charlottesville, to take into  
consideration the Internal Improvement of the State. The demand on them, as members of this body, was incompatible with  
the degree of attention which would otherwise have been bestowed on the examination of the students, then going on. So  
far, however, as this could be done, it served to confirm the high estimation in which the attainments and talents of the  
Professors have ever been held by them. They take pleasure in repeating the observations made in their Report of last  
year, concerning the improvement in the economy of the Institution, and the habits of the Students: points, in relation to  
which, they believe the University would not suffer from comparison with any similar establishment in the country. The  
anticipations expressed in the same Report, have been agreeably realized, by there being this year, in a portion of the  
schools, several successful aspirants, to the special certificates of proficiency which have been substituted for the  
&quot;Degrees&quot; usually conferred: in the Department of medicine, where particular reasons caused the title of Doctor to be  
retained, that degree has been acquired by several young gentlemen.  
The Board have to regret this year, again, the loss of one of the very able Professors, for the happy  
selection of whom, the University was indebted to the late Mr. Gilmer. Mr. Long, Professor of Antient Languages, while  
peforming the duties of his station here, received the flattering testimonials of the reputation he had left behind him,  
in a call to the Chair of Greek Literature, in the University of London. Under the contract subsisting between him and the  
University, he might have been retained one session longer: but, independently of the courtesy due to a kindred  
Institution, which promises no ordinary usefulness in the great work of instructing the rising generation, and extending  
the limits of human knowledge, Mr. Long had, by the very able and exemplary discharge of his duties, as well as by the  
perfect candor and propriety of his conduct, on the occasion, established claims, which, however averse the Board might be  
to sacrifice the interests of the University, would not allow them to insist rigorously on the contract with him. To fill  
the vacated Chair, during the approaching session, the Board have authorised the appointment, by the Rector, of Doctor  
Gesner Harrison, distinguished as a pupil of Mr. Long, and a graduate in the Medical School.  
Another duty, the discharge of which had been unavoidably delayed till this meeting, was to provide for the  
Chair of Natural Philosophy, vacated by the translation of Professor Bonnycastle to the School of Mathematics. The Board  
feel much gratification in having it in their power to state, that they have secured the services of Dr. Robert M.  
Patterson, late Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Pennsylvania His very high standing, where he was  
best known, both as a Professor and an accomplished member of society, leaves no doubt that he will prove, in every  
respect, a valuable acquisition to the University. In addition to the immediate duties of this school, those specially  
pertaining to the observatory, have been assigned to Doctor Patterson, with a compensation of five hundred dollars per  
annum.  
The fortnight’s recess for all the schools, provided for the Christmas holydays, having proved injurious in  
practice, has been discontinued, and the annual vacation fixed from the 20th of July to the 10th of September; the time  
for the public examination, required to precede the winter recess, being referred to the Faculty, with a direction that it  
be as near the middle of the session as conveniency will permit.  
With a view to a farther reduction of the expenses of the Students, the price paid to the Hotel Keepers for  
board, and all the supplies and services now rendered by them, except fuel and candles, has been fixed at one hundred dollars  
for the session of upwards of ten months: and provision has been made for supplying the two excepted articles on the most  
economical terms possible.  
The number of Students matriculated during the session is one hundred and thirty-one: the state of the  
schools being as follows:  
Antient Languages   48  
Modern Languages   46  
Mathematics   63  
Natural Philosophy   36  
Chemistry and Materia Medica   43  
Medicine 24  
Anatomy and Surgery  22  
Moral Philosophy  25  
Law   24  
The accounts for the receipts, disbursements, and funds on hand, as rendered by the Bursar and Proctor, are  
given with this report, as required by law.  
  
  
James Madison, Rector.

for the pdrpo-e ot enquiring into the proceedings

progress ot the Students, was complied with by  
the stated yearly meeting, commencing on tin­  
I°th of July, the jieriod of the Summer public  
examination. The Board continued their sc--ion  
until (lie 21th of the same month; a por’ion of  
their time being employed in attending, as had  
been desired by many ol their fellow-citizens, the  
Convention at that time held in Charlottesville, to  
t ike into consideration the Internal Improvement  
ot the State. The demand oh them, as mcmh-is  
of this body, was incompatible with the degree ol  
attention which would otherwise have been be­  
s owed on the examination of the students, then  
going on. So far, however, as this could be (&#x27;one,  
it served to confirm the high estimation in w hich  
the attainments and talents of the Professors have  
ever been held by them. &#x27;They take pleasure in  
tepeafing the observations made in their Report  
of last year, concerning the improvement in the  
  
economy ol the Institution, and the habit* of the  
Students: points, in relation to which, they be- |  
lieve the University would not sutler from ruin- |  
pari-son with any similar establishment in the  
country. The anticipations e apt eased in the some  
Report, have been agreeably realized, by there  
being this year, in a portion ol the school*, seve­  
ral successful aspirants, to the special certificates  
of pioficiency which have been substituted for the  
‘Do giees” usually conferred: in the Department  
of medicine, where particular reasons caused (he  
title of Doctor to he retained, that degree has been  
acquired by several young gentlemen.  
The Hoard have to regret this year, again, the  
Ins* of one of tbc very able Professors, lor the  
happy “election of whom, the University was in­  
debted to (he late Mr. Gilmer. Mr Long, Pro­  
fessor of Antient Languages, while p i forming  
the duties ot his sta&#x27;ion here, received the flatter­  
ing testimonials of the reputatbn he had left be­  
hind him, in a call to the Chair of Greek Litera­  
ture, in the University of London. Under the  
contract subsisting between him and the Univer­  
sity, ho might have been retained one session Ion  
ger. hut, independently of the courtesy due to a  
kindred Institution, which promises no ordinary  
usefulness in the great work of instructing the  
rising generation, and extending the limits ol hu­  
man knowledge, Mr. Long had, by the very aide  
and exemplary discharge of his duties, as well a*  
by tho perlcct candor and propriety of his con­  
duct, on the occasion, established claims, which,  
however aver-e the Hoard might he to sacrifice  
the interests of the University, would not allow  
them to insist rigorously on the contract with him.  
To lill the vacated Chair, during the approaching  
session, the Hoard have atithoi Led the appointment,  
by the Hector, of Doctor UVsne.r Harrison, dislin •

of the condition of the said university, the rector and  
visitors make the following  
  
REPORT:  
  
The provision, which requires that the rector and visi-  
tors should annually visit the university, for the purpose  
of oe into the proceedings sod. practices thereat,  
and of examining into the progress of the students, was  
complied with by the stated yearly meeting, commenc-  
ing on the LOth of July, the period of the summer public  
examination. ‘he board continued their session until the  
24th of the same’month; a portion of their time being em-  
ployed in attending, ashad been desired by many of their  
tellow citizens, the convention at that time held in Char-  
lottesville to take into consideration the internal improvec-  
ment of the state. The demand on them, as members of  
this body, was incompatible with the degree of attention  
which would otherwise have been bestowed on the exa-  
mination of the students, then going on. So far, how-  
ever, as this could be done, it served to confirm the  
high estimation in which the attainments and talents of  
the professors have ever been held by them. They take  
pleasure in repeuting the observations made in their re-  
port of last year, concerning the improvement in the econ  
omy of the institution, and the habits of the students;  
points, in relation to which, they believe the university  
would not suffer from comparison with any similar es-  
tablishment in the country. The anticipations express-  
ed in the samc report, have been agreeably realized, by

successful aspirants, to the special certificates of profi-  
cieney which have been substituted for the ‘‘degrees”  
coum conferred: in the department of medicine, where  
particular reasons caused the title of doctor to be retain-  
ed, that degree has been acquired by several-young gen-  
tiemen,.  
  
‘Lhe board have to regret this year, again, the loss of  
ooe of the very able proicssors, tor the happy selection  
of whom, the university was indebted to the late Mr.  
Gilmer, Mr. Long, protessor of ancient languages,  
while performing the dutics of his station here, received  
the flattering testimonials of the reputation he had. left  
Dohed bim, im a call to tie chair ot Greek literature, in  
he umversity @f London, Under the contract subsist-  
iug between him aud the University, he might have been  
retained on&amp; session longer; but, independently of the  
courtesy due toa kindred institution, which promises no  
ordinary usefuluess in the great work of instructing the  
rising generation, and extending the limits of human  
knowledge, Mr. Long had, by the very able and exen-  
plary discharge of tus dutics, as well as by the pertect  
candor and propriety of his conduct, on the occasion,  
established claims, which, however averse the board  
might be to sacrifice the terest of the university, would  
not allow them to insist rigorously on the contract with  
him. ‘To fill the .vacated chair, during the approaching  
session, the board have authorised the appointment, by  
the rector, of Doctor Gesner Harrison, distinguished as  
a pupil of Mr. Long and a graduate in the medical school.  
  
Another duty, the discharge of which had been una-  
voidably delayed till this meeting, was to provide for the  
chair of natural philosophy, vacated by the translation of  
professor Bonnyeastle to the school of mathematics.  
‘he board feel much gratification in having it in their  
»ower to state, that they have secured the services of Dr  
  
Robert M. Patterson, late professor of natural philoso-  
phy in the university of Pennsylvania.—His very high  
standing, where he was best known, both as a professor  
and an accomplished member of society, leaves&#x27;no doubt  
that he wiii prove, iv every respect, a valuable acquisition  
to the university. In addition tothe immediate duties of  
this school, those specially p-rtaining to the observatory  
have been assigned to doctor Patterson, with a com-  
pensation of five hundred dollars per annum.  
  
Fhe fortnigtt’s recess for all the schools, provided for  
the Christmas holy days, having proved injurious iv prac-  
tice, has been discontmred, and the annual vacation fix-  
ed trom the 20th July to the 10th of September; the time  
for the public examination, required to precede the win-  
ter recess, being referred to the faculty, with a direetion  
that it be asnear the middle of the session as convenien-  
ey will permit.  
  
With a view toa farther reduction of the expenses of  
the students, the price paid to the hotel keepers tor board,  
and all the supplies and services now rendered by them,  
except fuel and candles, bas been fixed at one hundred  
dollars tor the session of upwards of ten months, aud  
provision has been made tor supplying the two excepted  
articles of the most cconomieal terms possible.  
  
The number of students matriculated during the ses-  
sion, is one hundred and thirty one: the state of the schvuols  
heing as follows:  
  
Ancient languages 48  
Modern lauguages 46  
Mathematics 63  
Natural philosophy 36  
Chemistry and materia medica +3
