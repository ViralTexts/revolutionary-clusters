Washington January 30th 1815  
  
Having bestowed on the Bill, entitled, “An Act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States of America,” that full consideration which is due to the great importance of the subject, and dictated by the respect which I feel for the two Houses of Congress, I am constrained by a deep and solemn conviction that the Bill ought not to become a law, to return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with my objections to the same.  
Waving the question of the Constitutional authority of the Legislature to establish an incorporated Bank as being precluded, in my judgement, by repeated recognitions, under varied circumstances, of the validity of such an Institution, in acts of the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the Government, accompanied by indications, in different modes, of a concurrence of the general will of the nation; the proposed Bank does not appear to be calculated to answer the purposes of reviving the public credit, of providing a national medium of circulation, and of aiding the Treasury by facilitating the indispensable anticipations of the revenue, and by affording to the public more durable loans.  
1. The Capital of the Bank is to be compounded of specie, of public stock, and of Treasury Notes convertible into stock, with a certain proportion of each of which every subscriber is to furnish himself.  
The amount of the stock to be subscribed will not, it is believed, be sufficient to produce, in favor of the public credit, any considerable or lasting elevation of the market price, whilst this may be occasionally depressed by the Bank itself, if it should carry into the market the allowed proportion of its capital consisting of public stock, in order to procure specie, which it may find its account in procuring with some sacrifice on that part of its Capital.  
  
Nor will any adequate advantage arise to the public credit from the subscription of Treasury notes. The actual issue of these notes nearly equals at present, and will soon exceed, the amount to be subscribed to the Bank. The direct effect of this operation is simply to convert fifteen millions of Treasury notes into fifteen millions of six per cent stock, with the collateral effect of promoting an additional demand for Treasury notes beyond what might otherwise be negociable.  
Public credit might, indeed, be expected to derive advantage from the establishment of a national Bank, without regard to the formation of its Capital, if the full aid and co-operation of the Institution were secured to the Government during the war, and during the period of its fiscal embarrassments. But the Bank proposed will be free from all legal obligation to co-operate with the public measures, and, whatever might be the patriotic disposition of its Directors, to contribute to the removal of those embarrassments, and to invigorate the prosecution of the war, fidelity to the pecuniary and general interest of the Institution, according to their estimate of it, might oblige them to decline a connexion of their operations, with those of the National Treasury during the continuance of the war and the difficulties incident to it. Temporary sacrifices of interest, though overbalanced by the future and permanent profits of the charter, not being requirable of right in behalf of the public, might not be gratuitously made; and the Bank would reap the full benefit of the grant, whilst the public would lose the equivalent expected from it. For it must be kept in view, that the sole inducement to such a Grant, on the part of the public, would be the prospect of substantial aids to its pecuniary means, at the present crisis and during the sequel of the war. It is evident that the stock of the Bank will, on the return of peace if not sooner, rise in the market to a value which, if the bank were established in a period of peace, would authorize and obtain for the public, a Bonus to a very large amount. In lieu of such a Bonus the Government is fairly entitled to, and ought not to relinquish or risk, the needful services of the Bank, under the pressing circumstances of war.  
2. The Bank, as proposed to be constituted, cannot be relied on, during the war, to provide a circulating medium, nor to furnish loans, or anticipations of the public revenue.  
Without a medium, the Taxes cannot be collected; and in the absence of specie, the medium understood to be the best substitute, is that of notes issued by a national Bank. The proposed Bank will commence and conduct its operations, under an obligation to pay its notes in specie or be subject to the loss of its charter. Without such an obligation, the notes of the Bank, though not exchangeable for specie, yet resting on good pledges, and performing the uses of specie, in the payment of taxes, and in other public transactions, would, as experience has ascertained, qualify the Bank to  
  
supply at once a circulating medium, and pecuniary aids to the Government. Under the fetters imposed by the Bill it is manifest that, during the actual state of things, and probably during the war, the period particularly requiring such a medium and such a resource for loans and advances to the Government, notes for which the Bank would be compellable to give specie in exchange, could not be kept in circulation. The most the Bank could effect, and the most it could be expected to aim at would be to keep the Institution alive by limited and local transactions, which, with the interest on the public stock in the Bank, might yield a dividend sufficient for the purpose, until a change from war to peace should enable it, by a flow of specie into its vaults, and a removal of the external demand for it, to derive its contemplated emoluments from a safe and full extension of its operations.  
On the whole, when it is considered that the proposed Establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a national Bank, for a period of twenty years; that the monopolized profits will be continually growing, with the progress of the national population and wealth; that the nation will, during the same period, be dependent on the notes of the Bank for that species of circulating medium, whenever the precious metals may be wanted, and at all times for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium; and that the extensive employment of the notes in the collection of the augmented taxes will, moreover, enable the Bank greatly to extend its profitable issues of them, without the expence of specie capital to support their circulation; it is as reasonable, as it is requisite, that the Government, in return for these extraordinary concessions to the Bank, should have a greater security for attaining the public objects of the Institution, than is presented in the Bill, and particularly for every practicable accomodation, both in the temporary advances necessary to anticipate the taxes, and in those more durable loans which are equally necessary to diminish the resort to taxes.  
In discharging this painful duty of stating objections to a measure which has undergone the deliberations and received the sanction of the two Houses of the National Legislature, I console myself with the reflection, that, if they have not the weight which I attach to them, they can be constitutionally overruled, and, with a confidence that in a contrary event, the wisdom of congress will hasten to substitute a more commensurate and certain provision for the public exigencies.

Haviug bestowed on the bill, entitled “ An  
act to iuctrporale the subscribers to the bank of  
the United Stales ot America,” that full consi­  
deration which is due to the great importanee of  
the subject, and dictated by the respect which I  
feel lor the two houses of Congress, I am eon­  
strained, by a deep and solemn conviction, that  
tha bill ought not to become a law, to re­  
turn it to the Senate, in which ft originated, with  
my objections to the same.  
Waving the question of the constitutional au­  
thority of ihe legislature to establish an incor­  
porated hank, as being precluded, in my judg­  
ment, by repeated recognitions, under varied  
circumstances, of the validity of such an insti­  
tution, in acts of the legislative, executive, and  
judicial branches of the government, accompa­  
nied by indications, in different modes, of a con­  
currence of (he general will of the nation ; the  
proposed bank does not appear to be calculated  
to answer the purposes of reviving the public  
credit, of providing a national medium of circu­  
lation, and of aiding the treasury by facilitating  
the indispensable anticipations of the revenue,  
and lay affording to the public more durable loans.  
1. The capital of the bank is to be compound­  
ed of specie, of public stock, and of treasury  
notes convertible into stock, with a certain pro­  
portion of each of whieii every subscriber is to  
furnish himself.  
The amount of the stock to be subscribed will  
not, it i«, believed, be snffirient to produce^, in  
favor of the public credit, any considerable or  
lasting elevation of the market price, whilst this  
may be occasionally depressed by the bank itself,  
if it should carry into the market Unallowed  
proportion of its capital consisting of public  
*,or^’ *n #r^er to procure specie, which it may  
find its account in procuring, with ttma sacri*  
fice on that part of its eapitth  
  
Nor will any adequate advantage* arise tetbj  
public credit liorn ilia subscription of treasury  
notes. The actual issue of these notes&#x27;neatly  
equals, at present, and will soon exceed the a­  
nisuut to be subscribed to the bnuk. The direct  
effect at this operation is simply to convert fif­  
jeen millions ot treasury notes into fifteen mil­  
lions pf six per cent, stock, with the collateral  
effect of promoting an additional demand for  
treasury notes, beyond wbut might otherwise bo  
negotiable.  
Public credit might indeed be expected to de­  
rive advantage from the establishment of a na­  
Uoual bank, without regard to the formation of  
its capital, if the lull aid and co-operation of  
the institution were secured to the government  
during the war, and during the period of its fis­  
cal embarrassments.—BmI the bank proposed  
will be free trom all legal obligation to co-ope­  
rate with the public measures ; and whatever  
might be the patriotic disposition of its directors  
to contribute to the removal of those embarrass­  
ments, ami to invigorntv the prosecution of the  
war, fidelity to the pecuniary and general inler­  
est of the institution, according to their estimate  
of it, might oblige them to decline a connexion  
of their operations with those or the national  
treasury, during the continuance of the war and  
tlie (liifrculiits incident to it. Temporary earn­  
fiees ot interest, though overbalanced by the fu­  
ture and permanent profits of tbe charter, not  
being requirable of nghtin behalf of the public,  
might not be gratuitously made;.and the bank  
would reap (ho full benefit of the grant, whilst  
the public would lose the equivalent expected  
&quot;*m &#x27;*• ^or &gt;• must be kept in view, that the  
sole inducement to such a grant, on the part of  
the public, would be the prospect of substantial  
aids to its pecuniary means at the present crisis,  
and during the sequel of the war. It is evident  
that the stock of the bank will, on the return of  
peaee, if uot sooner, rise in I he market fo a va­  
lue which, if the hank were established in a pe­  
riod of peace, would authorise and obtain for tha  
puolic a bonus to a very large amount. In lira  
ot such a bonus the government is fairly entitled  
to, and ought not to relinquish or risk, the need­  
ful services of the bank, under the pressing cir­  
cumstances of war.  
  
i ne hank, as proposed fo he eeufttituted,  
oannut be relied ou during (lie war, tn provide ft  
circulat ing medium, nor to furnish loans, or an­  
ticipation* of the public revenue.  
Without a medium, the taxes cannot be col­  
lected ; and in the absence of specie, the medium  
understood to be tlie best substitute, is that of  
notes issued by a national bank. The proposed  
bank will commence aud conduct its operations,  
under an obligation to pay its notes iu specie, or  
be subject to the loss of its charter. Without  
such an obligation, file notes of the bank, though,  
not exchangeable for specie, yet resting on good­  
pledges, and performing the uses of specie, in  
the payment of taxes, and iu other public trans­  
actions, would, ns experience has ascertained,  
qualify the bank to supply at once a circulating  
medium, and pecuniary aids to the government.  
Under th? fetters imposed by the bill it is ma­  
nifest, that during the actual state of things, and  
probably during the war, the period particularly  
requiring such a medium and such a resource  
lor loan* and advances to the government, notes  
for which the bank would ba compellable to  
give *peeie in exchange could not be kept in cir­  
culation. The mast the Lank could effect, and  
the most it could be expected to aim at, would  
be to keep the institution alixro by limited and  
local transactions, which, with the interest on  
the public stock in the bank, might yield a divi­  
dend sufficient for the purpose, until a change  
from w..r to peace should enable it, by a flow of  
specie into its vaults, and a removal of the exter­  
nal demand for it, • to derive its contemplated  
emoluments from a safe and full extension of it*  
operations.  
  
On tlic whole, mien if is artnsidered (hat the  
proposed establishment will enjoy a monopoly of  
file profits of a national hank, for a period of  
twenty years^ that the monopolized profits will  
be continually growing with the progresaof the  
national population and wealth ; that the nation  
will, during the same period, he dependent on  
the Botes of the bank for that species of eircu­  
latiBg medium, whenever the precious metals  
may be wanted, and at all times for so mush  
thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a  
speeie medium ; and that the extensive employ*  
uient of the notes in the collection of the aug­  
mented taxes, will, moreover, enahle the bank  
greatly to extend its profitable issue* of them,  
without the expense of specie capital to support  
weir circulation ; it is as reasonable as it is re­  
quisite, that the government, in return fbrlhesa  
extraordinary concessions to the bank, should  
have a greutar security for attaining the publics  
objects of (he institution, than is presented in  
the bill, and particularly for every practicable  
accommodation both in the temporary advances  
neeessary to anticipate the taxes, and in those  
more durable leans whieh are equally neocssary  
to diminish the resort to taxes.  
In discharging this pninftil duty of stating ob­  
jection* to a measure whieh has undergone the  
deliberations and received the sanction of the  
two houses of the Natioal Legislature, I consols  
myself with the reflection, that if they have not  
the weight which I attach to them, they can ba  
constitutionally overruled : and with a confidence  
that, in a contrary event, the wisdom of con­  
gress will hasten to substitute a more commen­  
surate and certain provision for the public exi-“  
genetes. JAMKS MADISON

a value which if the bank were established

Without a medium, the taxes cannot be

medium understood to be iLe best substitute,  
is that of notes issued by a national bank_  
The pn p sed bank will commence and

public transactions would, as experience  
has ascertained, qualify the bank to sunplv

during the actual state of things, and on a.

requiring such a medium and such a re  
v&gt;uice for loans and advances to the gov­  
ernment, notes for rhich the bank would  
&gt;e compe’dable to give specie in exchange  
ceil&#x27;d not he kept in circulation. The most  
ihenankc old effect, and the tins&#x27; it could  
be expected to aim at, w mid be to keep  
‘he institution ilive by ii nite ! and l.ica&#x27;l

On the whole, when it was considered  
that the proposed establishment will enjoy  
* monopoly of &#x27;he profusofa national bank,  
for a period of tw nty years ; that the m &gt;•  
nopolized profits will lie continuady grow­

tals may be wanted, and at all times for s&lt;  
much thereof as may be xn eligible suboti­

tensive employment of the notes in the co&#x27; -  
lection of the augmented taxes, will, more­  
over. enable the bank greatly to cx&#x27;end  
its profitable issues of them, without the ex­  
pense of specie capital to support their  
circulation ; it is a* reajonftble as it is re­  
quisite, that government, in return for these  
extraordinary concessions to the bank,  
should have ? greater security for attain­  
ing &#x27;he public objects of the institution, than  
presented in the bil , and particularly  
tor every practicable accommodation b ah

In discharging this painful duty of stating  
objections »o a measure which has under­  
gone the dt liberations and received the  
sanction of the twolr;u*es of the National  
Legislature. I console myself with the re­  
daction, that if they have n .t the weight  
w.i’ch I attach to them, they can oe consu­

Nor will any adequate advantage arise to the

jieu of such a bonus the government is fairly enti-

ful services. of the bank, under the pressing circum-  
stances of war.  
  
2. The bank, as proposed to be constituted, can-  
not be relied on during the war, to provide a circu-  
lating medium, nor to furnish loans, or anticipations  
of the public revenue.  
  
Without a medium, the taxes cannnot be collect-  
ed; and inthe absence of specie, the medium un-  
derstood to be the best substitute, is that of notes  
issued by a national bank. ‘The proposed bank will  
commence and conduct its operations, under an ob-  
ligation to pay its notes in specie, or be subject to  
the loss ofits charter. Without such an obligation,  
the notes of the bank, though not exehangeable for  
specie, yet resting on good pledges, and performing  
the uses of specie, in the payment of taxes, and in  
other public transactions, would, as experience has  
ascertained, qualify the bank to supply at once a  
circulating medium, and pecuniary aids to the go-  
‘vernment. Under the fetters imposed by the biil,  
it-is manifest, that during the actual state of things  
and probably during the war, the period particular-  
iy requiring such a medium and such aresourte for  
loans and advances to the government, notes for  
which the bank wauld be compellable to give specie  
in exchange could not be kept in circulation. The  
most the bank could effect, and the most it could be  
expected to aim at, wouid be to keep the institution  
alive by limited and local transactions, which, with  
  
the interest on the public stock inthe bank, might |  
  
vield a dividend sufficient for the purpose, until a  
change from war to peace should enable it, by a flow  
of specie into its vaults, and a removal of the exter-  
nal demand forit, to derive its centemplated emol-  
uments from a safe and full extension of its opera-  
tions.  
  
Ou the whole, when it is consideved that the pro-  
posed establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the  
profits of a national bank, for a periodef twenty  
years; that the monopolized profits will be continu-  
ally growing with the progress of the national popu-  
lation and wealth; that the nation will during the  
same period, be dependent on the notes of the bank  
for that species of circulating medium, whenever  
the precious metals may be wanted, and at all times  
for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute  
for a specie medium; and that the extensive employ-  
ment of the notes in the collection of the augment-  
ed taxes, will, moreover, enable the bank greatly to  
extend its profitable issues of them, without the ex-  
pense of specie capital to support their circulation;  
it is reasonable as it is requisite, that the govern-  
ment, in return for these extraordinary Corcessions  
to the bank, should have a greater security for at  
taining the public objects of the institution, than is  
presented in the bill, and particularly for every prac-  
ticable accommodation both in the temporary ad-  
van¢es necessary to anticipate the taxes, and in  
those more durable loans whice are equally neces-  
sary to diminish the resort to taxcs.  
  
In discharging this painful diity of stating objec-

Such a grant, on the part of the Ewllc,wquld‘  
be the prospect of subsiantial aids to its pe­  
cuaniary mbahs at the present crisis, and dur­  
dog the sequel of the war. It is evident that  
the stock of the bank will, on the return of  
Peace, if not sooner, rise in the market to a  
value which, if the bank were established in

the extensive employment of the notes in the  
collection of the augmented taxes, will, more­  
over, onable the bank greatly to extend its  
profitable issues of them, without the expence  
of specie capital to support their circulation ;  
it is reasonable as it is requisite, that the gov­  
ernment, in turn for these extraordinary con­  
cessions to the bank, should bdve a greater  
security for attaining the public objects of the  
ingtitution, thun is presented in the bill, and  
particularly for every practicable accommo­  
dation in the temporary advances necessary  
to anticipate the taxes, and in those more dur­  
sble loans which are equally necessary to di­  
minish the resort to taxés,  
  
In disebarging this painful duty of stating  
objections to a measure which has undergone  
the deliberations and received the sanction of  
the two houses of the National Legislature, 1  
console m{’ul&#x27;f with the reflection, that it they  
have not the weight which I attach to them,  
they can be constitationally overruled ; and  
with a confidence that, ip &amp; contrary event,  
the wisdom of TCongressewill hasten to sub­  
stitute a more commensurate and certain pro­  
vision for the public exigencies.

Monday y January i9.  
Mr Coles, the President&#x27;s Secretary, . returned  
  
the bill &quot; to incorporate e subscribers to the  
Bank of the United States of America,&quot; with the  
following message  
  
To Ike Senate of the Unttea states.  
Having bestowed on the bill, entitled M An act  
  
to incorporate the - subscribers to the Bank of the  
  
United States ol America, mat lull consiocrauon  
wtlich is do to the great importance of the subject,  
  
and dictated by tho respect which I fell lor the  
two hoose of Congress, I am constrained, by  
  
deep and 6olem conviction, that the bill ought not  
  
to become . a law to return u 10 m cuic, ui  
  
which it originated, with my objections to the  
same. v  
  
Wavwfe the qurstton of th censoreiionai au-  
  
thoritv of the Leeklature to establish an incorpor  
  
rattdbsnk, as heme precluded, to my judgment,  
  
tov renotMi recocniunnsi under varied cuxumstan-  
  
Ces, oi tne vauoity 01 sucn an uiiuwuiiw, xm 01  
legislative, executive, and judicial, branches. 0! the  
eovernmenr, accompanied of indication, in differ-,  
  
nt modes, of a concurrence of the . generul trill oX  
  
the nation ;. the proposed bank does not appear to  
  
be calculated to answer the purposes 01 reviving the  
  
oubuc credib of providing uauoufcl medium ot  
  
circulation, and of aiding the treasury by facilitat-  
  
inir the toJienensftble snticiDatfons of the revenue,  
  
and by affording to the public more durable loans.  
  
1. The capital of the bank is to be compoundee  
  
of specie, of public stock, and of Treasury Notes  
convertible into stock, with a certain propot tion of  
each of widch every subscriber is to furnish him  
  
self.  
The amount of the stock to be subscribed will  
not, it is believed, be suAiuent to produce, in favor  
df the public credit, aty considerable or lasting ele­  
vation of the market price, whilst this ropy be occa­  
sionally depressed by the bank itself; il it should  
carry into market the allowed proportion of its ca­  
pital consisting of pubiic stock, in order to procure  
specie, which it m-.y fi&quot;d its account in procuring,  
with some sacrifice on that part of its capital.  
  
Nor will any adequate advantage arise to the  
public credit from the subscription of . Treasury  
Notes. The actual issue of these notes nearjy e­  
qual, at present, and will soon exceed the amount  
to be subscribed to the bank. The direct effect of  
this operation is simply to convert fifteen millions  
of Treasury Kotes into fifteen millions of six per  
cent slock, with the collateral effect, of promot­  
ing an additional demand for Treasury Notes, be­  
ydnd what might otherwise be negotiable.  
Public credit might indeed be expected to de­  
rive advantage from the establishment of a national  
bank, without regard to the formation of its capi.  
tal, if the full aid aod cooperation of the insthu­  
tion were secured to the government during the  
war, and during the peiiod of its fiscal embarrass­  
mcnts But the bank proposed will be free from  
  
all legaf obligations to co-operate with the public  
  
measures ; .arul whatever might be the patriotic  
  
disposition of its directors to ; contribute to the re  
muval of those emhatrassmentB, and to invigorate  
the prosecution of the war; fidelity to the pecuniary  
and general interest of the institution, according to  
tr.eir estimate of it, might oblige them to decline a  
connecuon of their operations with those of 4he na­  
tional treasur, during the continuance cf the war  
and the dim ulties incident , to it Temporary  
sacrifices oT interest, though overbalanced by the fu  
tute aha permanent, profits of the charter, not be­  
ing requirable of right in be)balf of the public,  
might not be gratuitously made ; and the. bank  
  
would reap the full benefit of the grant, whilst - the j  
  
public would lose the equivalent expected trom lb:  
For it must be kept in view, that , the sole induce  
  
ment to such a grant, on the pert of the public  
  
would be tne,rospect,oi subctanuai. aws iq b .pe-t.

Mr. Celes, the Presiderit’s secretary, retur­  
ned the bill ** to incorporate the subscribers to  
the Bank of the U. States of America,” with the  
following .  
MESSAGE:  
TO THE SENATE OF THE U, STATES,  
Having bestowed on the bill, entitled “ An  
et to incorporate the subscribers to the bank  
of the U, States of America.” that full consid.  
eration which is due to the great impeortance  
of the subject, and dictated by the respect  
which I feel for the two houses ¢f Congress, I  
am constrained, by a deep and .solemn convic­  
tion, that the bill ought not to become a law, to  
return it to the Senate, in which it originated,  
‘with my objections to the same.  
Waving the question of the cosstitutional au­  
thority of the Legislature to establish an incor­  
porated bank, as heing precluded, in my judge­  
ment, by repeated recognizations, under varied  
circumstances, of the validity of such an institu­  
tion, in acts of the legislative, executive, and  
Jjudieial branches of the goversment, accom­  
panied by indications, in differnment modes, of  
a concurrence of the general wil of the nation ;  
the proposed bank does not appéar to be calcu­  
lated to answer the purposes of reviving the  
public credit, of providing a national medium of  
circulation, and of aiding the treasury by faeilita­  
ting, theindispensable anticipations of the leve­  
nue, and by affording to the public more dura­  
. ble loans. - { e  
- 1. The capital of the bank is t 3 be compoun­  
ded of specie, of public stock, and of Treasury  
Notes convertible into stack, withi a certain pro­  
portion of each of which every smbscriber is to  
furnish himself. f% &lt;  
- The amount of the stock to be subscribed  
will not, it is believed, be sufficient to produce,  
in saver of the publie credit, any considerable  
or lasting elevatiom of the market price,  
whilst this may be occasiopally depressed by  
the bank itself, if&#x27;it should carry into the mar­  
ket the allowed proportion of its capital con­  
sisting of public stock, in ordel to procure  
specie, which it may find its acciount in pro­  
euring, with some sacrifice on thjat part of its  
€apital, - :  
Nor will any adequate advantag¢ arise to the  
public credit from the subscriptioa of Treasury  
Notes. The actual issue of these notes nearly­  
equals, at present, and will soon exceed the a­  
mount to be subscribed to the bank. The di­  
rect effect of this operation is simply to convert  
fifteen millions of six per cent stock; with the  
collateral effect of prometing an sdditional de­  
mand for treasuwry Notes, beyond what might  
otherwise be negotiable.  
Public credit might indeed be expected to  
derive advantage from the establishment of a  
national bank, without regard to the formation  
of its eapital, if the full aid and co-operation of  
the institution were secured to the government  
during the war, and during the paviod of his  
fiscal embarrassmeut.—But the bank proposed  
will be free from all legal obligatiom to ce-oper­  
ate with the public measures ; and whatever  
might be the patriotic disposition es its direc­  
tors to contribute to the removal of those em­  
barrassments, and to invigorate the prosecution  
of the war, fidelity to the pecuniary; and gener­  
al interest of the institution, according to then  
estimate of it, might oblige them teo decline-a  
connection of their operatiens with: those of the  
national treasury, during the contityuance of the  
“war and the diﬁ’;ulties incident to it. Tempo­  
rary sacrifices of interest, theugh @verbalanced  
by the future and permanent profit&#x27;3 of the char­  
ter, not being vequirable of right in behalf of  
the public, might neot be gratuitously made ; and  
the bank would reap the full benefit of the  
grant, whilst the public would lese the équiva-.  
lent expected from it. For it must be kept in  
view, that the sole inducement to swuch a grant,  
on the part of the public, would be the prospect  
of substantial aids to its pecuniary nheans at the  
present crisis, and during the sequel of the  
war. It is evidemnt that the stock of the bank  
will, on the retuin of peace, if not sooner, rise  
§n the market to m value which, if the: bank were  
‘established in a petiod of peace, would author­  
ise and obtain fer the public a bonis to a very  
large pmount. In lieu of such a bonus the  
government is fairly entitled to, and ought not  
to relinquish or risk, the needful services of  
the bank, under the pressing circurnstances of  
2. The bank as proposed to be ¢onstituted,  
cannet be relied on during the war, to provide  
a circulating medium, ner to furnish loans, or  
anticipations of the public revenue.  
Without a medium, the taxes cannot be col­  
lected ; and in the absense of specie, the medi­  
um understood to be the best substitute, is that  
of notes issued by a national bank. Whe propo­  
sed bank will commence and conduct its opera­  
tions, under apobﬁ?ﬁan tion to pay ity notes in  
’ ‘guio.or,.be subject to the loss of its charter.

state of things, and probably during tne wi .  
the period particularly requiring such a med:-  
um and sueh a resource for loans and advances  
‘o the government, wotes for which the bank  
vould be compeiluble to give specie in exchangc  
could not bektpt in circulation. Theé most the  
bank could effect, and the most it coild be ex­  
pected to aim at, would be to keep the insiitu­  
tion alive by limited and local transactions,  
which, with the interest on the public steck in  
bank, might yeild a dividend sufficient for the  
purpose, until a change from warto peace  
should enable it, by a flow of specie into its  
vaults, and a removal of the external demand  
forit, to derive its contemplated ‘emoluments  
from a safe and full extension of its opera­  
- tions.  
On the whole, when it is considered that the  
proposed establishment will enjoy a monopoly  
of the profits of a national bank, for a period of  
twenty years; that the monopolized profits  
will be continually growinz with the progress  
of the national population and weslth ; that the  
nation will during the same period, be depen­  
dent on the nates of the bank for that species  
of eirculating medium, whenever the precious  
metals may be - anted, and at all times for so  
much thereo® as 2y be an eligible substitute  
for a spechy et s rom hiothe extensive  
embloymient of the notes inthé collection of the  
augmented taxes, will, moreover, enable the  
bank greatly to extend’ its profitable issues of  
them, without the “expence of speeie capital te  
support their circulation ; it is reasonable as it  
it requisite, that the government, in turn for  
these extraordinary concessions to the bank,  
should have a greater security for attaining the  
public objects of the institution, than is presen­  
ted in the Lill, and particularly for every prac­  
ticable accommodation in the temporary ad­  
vances necessary to anticipate ‘the taxes,  
and in those more durable loans which are  
equally necessary to diminish the resort to  
taxes. b  
  
In discharging this painful duty of stating ob­  
jections to a measure which has undergone the  
deliberations and received the sunction of the  
two houses of ‘the National Legislature, I con­  
sole myself with the réflection, that if they have  
not the weight whieh I attach to them, they  
can be comstitutionally overruled ; and with a  
confidence that, in a cuntrary event, the wisdom  
of Congress will hasten to substitute a more.  
cemmensurate and certain provision for the  
public exigencies. b 5

•and&#x27;snch a resource fbr loans and adrances to the  
goFerninent, notes for which the bank would be  
compellable to give specie in exchange could not  
be kept in circulation.  
  
The most the bank could effect, and the most  
it could be expected to aim at, would be to  
keep the iustituliou alive by limited and local  
transactions, which, with the interest on the  
public stock in the bank, might yield a dividend  
sufficient for the purpose, until a change from  
war to peace should enable it, by a ffow of spe*  
eie into its vaults, and a removal of the exter¬  
nal demand for it, .to derive its contemplated  
emoluments from a safe and full extension of  
tis operations.  
  
On the whole, when it is considered that the  
proposed establishment will enjoy a monopoly  
of the profits of a national bank, for a peri&lt;^ of  
twenty years ; that the monopolized profits will  
be contiiuially growing with the progress of the  
national population and wealth; that the nation  
Will, during the same period, be dependent on  
the notes of the bank for tliat species of circula¬  
ting medium, whenever the precious metals may  
be wanted, and at all times for so much thereof  
as may be an eligible substitute for a specie me¬  
dium; and that the extensive employment of  
the notes in the collection of the augmented  
taxes, will, moreover, enable the bank greatly to  
extend its profitable issues of them, without the  
expense of specie capital 4o support their circu¬  
lation ; it is as reasonable as it is requisite, that  
the government, in return- for these extraordi¬  
nary concessions to the bank, should have a  
greater security for attaining the public objects  
of the institution, than is presented in the bill,  
and particularly for every piacticable accommo¬  
dation both in the temporary advances necessary&#x27;  
to anticipate the taxes, and in those more dura¬  
ble loans which are equally necessary to dimin¬  
ish the resort to taxes.  
  
In discharging the painful duty of stating ob¬  
jections to a measure which has undergone the  
deliberations and received the sanction of the  
two houses of the national legislature, 1 console  
myself with the reffection, that if they have not  
the weight which 1 attach to them, they can be  
constitutionally overruled; and with a confi¬  
dence that, in a contrary event, the wisdom of  
eongresB will hasten to substitute a more com¬  
mensurate and certain provision for the public  
exigencies.

Having bestowed on the bill, entitled, “ An  
act to incorporate tile subscribers to the bank  
of the United Sta&#x27;es of America,” that full con  
sideration which is due to the great importance  
of the subject, and dictated bv the respect  
which I feel for the two houses of c ngress, I  
am constrained, by a deep and solemn convic-  
tion, that the bill ought not to become a law,  
to return it to the senate, in which it origina-  
ted, with my objections to the same.  
  
Waving the question of the constitutional  
authority of the legislature to establish an in-  
corporated bank, as being precluded, in my  
judgment, by repeated recognitions, under va-  
ried circumstances of the validity of such an  
institution, in ac&#x27;s -if the legislative, execu-  
tive, and judicial branches of the (Jovernment,  
accompanied by indications, in different modes  
of a concurrence of the general will of the na-  
tion : the proposed hank does not appear to  
be calculated to answer the purposes of reviv-  
ing the public credit, of providing a national  
medium of circulation, and of aiding the trea-  
sury by facilitating the indispensable anticipa-  
tions of the revenue, and by affording to the  
public mi re durable loans.  
  
1. The capital of the bank is to be compound-  
ed of specie, of public stock, and of Treasury  
Notes convertible into stock, with a certain  
proportion -if each of which every subscriber  
is to furnish himself.  
  
The amount of the stock to be subscribed,  
will not it is believed, be sufficient to pro-  
duce, in favour of the public credit, any con-  
siderable or lasting elevation of the market  
price, whilst this may lie occasionally depress,  
ed by the bank itself, if it should carry into  
the market the allowed proportion of its  
capital consisting of public stock, in order to  
procure specie, which it may find its account  
in procuring, with some sacrifice on that pari  
of its capital.  
  
Nor will any adequate advantage arise to the  
public credit from the subscription, of treasu-  
ry notes. The actual issue of these notes near  
lv equals, at preseti&#x27;, and will soon exceed the  
amount to be subscribed to the bank. The  
direct effect of operation is simply to convert

&#x27;lie extensive employment of the notes in tilt  
collection of the augmented taxes, will, more-  
over, enable ihe bank greatly to extend it*  
profitable issues of them, without the expense  
of specie capital to support their circulation :  
it is as reasonable as it is requisite, that the  
government, in return for these extraordinary  
concessions to the ba k, should have a greater  
security for attaining the public bjects of the  
institution, than is presented in the. bill, and  
particularly for every practicable acdmmoda-  
Bon both in the temporary advances, necessa-  
ry to anticipate the taxes, and in those more  
durable 1 ans which are equally necessary to  
ry to diminish the resort to taxes.  
  
In discharging this painful duty of stating  
objections to a measure which lias undergone  
the deliberations and received the sanction of  
the two houses of the National Legislature, I  
console myself with the reflection, that  
if they have not the weight which I at-  
tach to them, they can be constitutionally over-  
ruled ; and with a confidence that, in a con-  
trary event, the wisdom of congress will has-  
ten to substitute a more commensurate and  
certain provision for the public exigencies.

of the pronts of a national bank for a  
period of twenfy years; that the monopohzed  
bronts will be continually growing with the

species of circulating medium  whenever the  
 precious metals may be wanted, and at all times  
lor so much thereof as may be an cligibic sub

them without the expeuse of specre capital to supe  
that carcutation, if is reasonable, as it is reik  
that the Government-th return for these

weight which he attaches to them &quot;they can be  
constitutionally overruled; and with a confidence

2849 to 1853, and the two-term administration of  
Abraham Lincoln are not notable for vetoes of  
any kind.  
 Our first abstract of these Presidential vetoes is  
that of President Washington, as follows:  
wASHINGTON&#x27;s verO.  
The veto of President Washington as explained  
above, was in reference to the cavalry arm of the  
military service, in which the President took the  
ground that it would be unwise to destroy the  
efficiency of the regular cavalry, as its ranks  
would have to be filled by volunteers.  
MADISON&#x27;S BANe VETO.  
Waiving the question of the Constitu­  
tional authority of the Legislature to establish an  
incorporated bank, as being prejudiced in my  
udgment, by repeated recognitions, under varied  
circumstancces, of the validity of such an institu­  
tion, in acts of the legislative, executive and judl-  
cial branches of the Government, accompanied by  
indications, in different modes, of a concurrence  
of the general will of the nation, the proposed  
ban does not appear to be calculated to answer  
the purposes of reviving the public credit, of pro­  
iding a national medium of circulation and of  
aiding the Treasury by facilitating the indispen­  
sable anticipations of the revenue, and by afford­  
tang to the public more durable loans.

When it is considered that the proposed estab-  
  
lishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a  
national bank for a period of twenty years;  
  
that the monopolized profits will be con­  
tinually growing with the progress of  
  
the national population and wealth; that  
the nation will, during the same period be  
dependent on the notes of the bank for that species  
 of circulating medium whenever the precious met­  
als may be wanted, and at all times for so much  
thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a spe­  
cie medium; and that the extensive employment  
of the notes in the collection of the augmented  
taxes will, moreover, enable the bank greatly to  
extend its profftable issues of them without the  
expense of specie capital to support that circula­  
tion, it is reasonable, as it is requisite, that the  
Government, in return for these extraordinary  
concessions to the bank, would have a greater  
security for attaining the public objects of the in­  
stitution than is presented in the bill, and parti­  
J cularly for every practicable accommodation, both  
  
in the temporary advances necessary to anticipate  
  
Y.  
  
the taxes, and in those more durable loans which  
  
are equally necessary to diminish the resort to  
  
taxes. President Madison concludes his message
