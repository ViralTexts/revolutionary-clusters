Head Quarters Newburgh 18th March 1783.  
  
The result of the proceedings of the grand Convention of the Officers, which I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency for the inspection of Congress, will, I flatter myself, be considered as the last glorious proof of Patriotism which will have been  
given by Men who aspired to the distinction of a patriot Army; and will not only confirm their claim to the justice, but will encrease their title to the gratitude of their Country.  
Having seen the proceedings on the part of the Army terminate with perfect unanimity, and in a manner entirely consonant to my wishes; being impressed with the liveliest sentiments of affection for those who have so long, so patiently, and so chearfully  
suffered &amp; fought under my immediate direction; having from motives of justice, duty &amp; gratitude, spontaneously offered myself as an advocate for their rights; and having been requested to write to your Excellency earnestly entreating the most speedy decision of  
Congress upon the subjects of the late address from the Army to that Honble Body—it now only remains for me to perform the task I have assumed—and to intercede in their behalf, as I now do, that the Sovereign Power will be pleased to verify the predictions I have pronounced  
of, and the confidence the Army have reposed in the justice of their Country.  
And here, I humbly conceive it is altogether unnecessary—(while I am pleading the cause of an Army which have done &amp; suffered more than any other Army ever did in the defence of the rights &amp; liberties of human nature—) to expatiate on their Claims to the most ample compensation for their meritorious Services—because they are perfectly known to the whole World—and because, (altho’ the topics are inexhaustible) enough has already been said on the subject.  
To prove these assertions, to evince that my sentiments have ever been uniform, and to shew what my ideas of the rewards in question have always been, I appeal to the Archives of Congress, and call on those sacred deposits to witness for me. And in order  
that my observations and arguments in favor of a future adequate provision for the Officers of the Army may be brought to remembrance again, and considered in a single point of view without giving Congress the trouble of having recourse to their files, I will beg leave to  
transmit herewith an Extract from a representation made by me to a Committee of Congress so long ago as the 29th of January 1778—and also the transcript, of a Letter to the President of Congress—dated near Passaic Falls Octr 11th 1780.  
That in the critical &amp; perilous moment when the last mentioned communication was made, there was the utmost danger a dissolution of the Army would have taken place unless measures similar to those recommended had been adopted, will not admit a doubt.  
That the adoption of the resolution granting half-pay for life has been attended with all the happy consequences I had foretold so far as respected the good of the service—let the astonishing contrast between the State of the Army at this instant, and at the former period  
determine. And that the establishment of funds; and security of the payment of all the just demands of the Army will be the most certain means of preserving the National faith &amp; future tranquillity of this extensive Continent, is my decided opinion.  
By the preceeding remarks it will readily be imagined that instead of retracting and reprehending—(from farther experience and reflection—) the mode of compensation so strenuously urged in the Inclosures, I am more &amp; more confirmed in the Sentiment—and  
if in the wrong suffer me to please myself with the grateful delusion.  
For if, besides the simple payment of their wages, a farther compensation is not due to the sufferings &amp; sacrafices of the Officers, then have I been mistaken indeed. If the whole Army have not merited whatever a grateful people can bestow, then have I  
been beguiled by prejudice &amp; built opinion on the basis of error—If this Country should not in the event perform every thing which has been requested in the late Memorial to Congress, then will my belief become vain, and the hope that has been excited void of  
foundation—And &quot;if&quot;—(as has been suggested for the purpose of inflaming their passions) &quot;the Officers of the Army are to be the only sufferers by this revolution: if retiring from the Field they are to grow old in poverty  
wretchedness and contempt—If they are to wade thro’ the vile mire of dependency and owe the miserable remnant of that life to charity, which has hitherto been spent in honor,&quot; then shall I have learned what ingratitude is, then shall I have realized a tale, which will  
imbitter every moment of my future life.  
But I am under no such apprehensions, a Country rescued by their Arms from impending ruin, will never leave unpaid the debt of gratitude.  
Should any intemperate or improper warmth have mingled itself amongst the foregoing observations, I must entreat your Excellency &amp; Congress it may be attributed to the effusion of an honest Zeal in the best of Causes, and that my peculiar situation may  
be my apology—and I hope I need not on this momentous occasion make any new protestations of personal disinterestedness, having ever renounced for myself the idea of pecuniary reward. The consciousness of having attempted faithfully to discharge my duty, and the approbation  
of my Country will be a sufficient recompense for my services. I have the honor to be, With perfect respect Yr Excellencys Most Obedt Servt

THE relult of the proceeding 8 of the grand con-

manner entirely conſonant to my wiſhes; being im-  
preſſed with the livelieſt ſentiments. of affection for

And here I humbly conceive it is altogether un-  
neceſſary (white I am pleading the cauſe of an army  
which have dene and ſuffered more than any other  
army ever did in the defence of the rights and liber-  
ties of human nature) to expatiate on their claims to  
the moſt ample compenſation for their meritorious

inexhauftible) enough has already been ſaid on the

my ſentiments have ever been uniform, and to ſhew

call on thoſe ſacred depoſits to witneſs for me. And  
in order that my obſervations and arguments ip fa-

of the army may be brought to remembrance again,

bliſhment ot funds, and ſecurity of the payment of  
all the juſt demands of the artny, will be the moſt  
certain means of preſerving the national faith and  
future tranquillity of this extenſive continent, is my.  
decided opinion.  
  
By the preceding remarks it will readily be! ima-  
gined, that inſtead of retracting and abe we

&quot; That, in the critical and perilous moment, when  
the last mentioned communication was made, there  
was the utmost danger that a dissolution of the ar­  
my would have taken place, unless measures similar  
to those recommended, had been adopted, will not  
admit of a doubt.  
&quot; That the adoption of the resolution granting  
half pay lor life, has been attended with all the  
happy consequences I had foretold, so far as respect­  
ed the good of the service, let the astonishing con­  
trast between the state of the army at this instant,

establishment ot funds, and the security for the

the most certain means of preserving the national  
faith, and the future tranquillity of this extensive  
continent, is my decided opinion ; by the preceding  
remarks, it will be readily imagined that, instead of  
retracting or reprehending from further experience  
and reflection, the mode so strenuously urged in the

then I shall have realized a tale which will embit­

not due tn the sufferings and sacrlfl­

mistaken indeed. If the whole army  
have not merited whatever u grateful

beguiled by prejudice and built opin­

everything ftvlilch has been requested  
in Ihelale memorial to congress, then  
will my belief become vatu and the  
hope that has been excited void of  
foundation. And if. as has been sug­
