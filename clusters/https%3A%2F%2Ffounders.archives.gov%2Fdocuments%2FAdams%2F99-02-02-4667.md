r Sir  
Phyladelphia October 27. 1800  
  
It is was only this morning  on Yesterday that I received the Letter you did me the honour to write me, on the Sixteenth of September. For the friendly and respectful Style in which it is written I pray you to accept of my hearty Thanks: and you shall receive in my answer all the Satisfaction in my Power to give you.  
Of The Letter which is published in my name I have no Copy, nor any very particular recollection. In General I remember that when Mr Core was assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, he was very assiduous in his Attentions to me: made me many Visits at my house and invited me often  many invitations to my own to his own, when I was at the Seat of Government, and wrote me many Letters when I was absent from it. I have also an indistinct Idea of his writting me a Letter before your Embarkation for Europe expressing a great Anxiety that an Interview should take place between You and me before you departed should depart, and an opinion that it would be in my Power to communicate to you, some usefull Information and Advice relative to the subject of your Mission.—As I knew of nothing that could make it necessary for you to take a Journey to Quincy or for me to go to Phyladelphia, it is very probable I wrote him something Like the Letter that is published. This however has been manifestly either so carelessly copied or unfaithfully printed that I must therefore refer to the original Letter,: which if it is in my hand writing, will, be easily known.  
It may not be easy for me to give you a clear Idea of the situation I was in, when that Letter was written. In order to accomplish this necessary purpose as well as I can, It must be observed that in May 1792 when that Letter was written, It was my misfortune to be I was wholly unacquainted with all the Gentlemen who bear the Name of Pinckney. I had never seen one of them in my Life, As I can recollect and knew not had many that there were more than two. When I hear of your appointment I recollected the Conversation with the Marquis of Carmarthen, now Duke of Leeds, and imagined it probable that his Lordship might have intimated directly or indirectly to some one near the President that one of the Mr Pinckneys would be agreable at Court. I never had an Idea of any other Influence, than that which is very common in Europe, When one Government causes intimations to be given to another, that the appointment of some particular Gentleman would be agreable. And I now fully believe that my suspicion of even that kind of Influence was wholly unfounded, in reality: though it had then some colour in Appearance.  
The other Insinuation concerning the Pinckney family had no other foundation than this. When I recd my Commission to the Court of st. James’s, I observed in it, a limitation to three Years. As I did not recollect any Example of this before, I was at a loss for the reason of it: but as I did not intend at that time to remain in Europe even so long a time as three Years I give my Self little thought very little of it, untill afterwards on my Arrival in London in 1785, I was received Information, without Inquiry, that Mr Pinckney a Member of Congress from South Carolina, had Said that, “the Limitation to three Years had been inserted in my Commission for the purpose of getting rid of me. That the Mission to London was too good a Thing for me, and that the Intention was as soon as I could be removed to send a Mr Man Pinckney of South Carolina in my room.” When I heard of a Mr Pinckneys appointment this London Information came into my Mind and diverted me because I supposed Mr Pinckney after Eight Years had carried his Point and occasioned the sentiment expressed in the Letter which from the Sportive playfull careless air of it, throughout, must be easily perceived, to have been confidential. It may easily be ascertained, who, was the Mr Pinckney who was a Member of Congress in 1784 or 1785 when my Commission was granted &amp; dated, and when the Limitations to three years was inserted.  
On this occasion it is but Justice and Duty in me to declare that I have not at this time the Smallest Reason to believe or Suspect that you or your Brother ever Solicited any Appointment under Government aboard or at home, that the whole Conduct of Both has Shewn Minds candid independant  as far as it has come to my Knowledge, and I have had considerable Opportunities to know the Conduct of both since 1792, has Shewn Minds candid able and independent wholly free from any kind of Influence from Britain, and from any improper Bias in favour of that Country or any other and that, both have rendered with honor and dignity to themselves great and important service to our Country. And I will Add in the sincerity of my heart that I know of no two Gentlemen whose Characters and conduct are more deserving of Confidence  
I cannot conclude without observing that We are fallen on evil times: –On evil times indeed are We fallen if every private conversation is immediately, to be betrayed and misrepresented in the Newspapers and if every frivlous and confidential Letter is to be dragged by the hand of Treachery from its Oblivion of Eight years and published by Malice and revenge for the purpose of making Mischief.  
I am, sir with great Truth and /  regard, your Friend and humble /  Servant,  
  
  
  
John Adams  
  
As your Letter has been so long on its way to me, I Shall publish this Answer immediately, which I hope you will excuse.  
I must beg your pardon for employing the hand of my son in copying a part of this letter, as it

which, if it is in my hand-writing,  
will be eafily known.  
  
it may not be eafy for me to give  
youa clear idea of the fituation I  
was in, when that letter was written,  
In order to accomplifh this neceflary  
purpofe, as well as I can, it muft be  
obferved, that in May 1792, 1t was  
my misfortune to be wholly unac-  
quainted with all the gen&#x27;lemen who  
bear the name of Pinckney. I had  
never feen one of them in my life, as  
I can recolle&amp;, and knew not that  
there were more thantwo, When I  
heard of your appointment, I recol-  
lef&amp;ted the converfation with the  
Marquis of Carmarthen, now duke  
of Leeds, and imagined it probable,  
that his lerdfhip might have intimat-  
ed dire@ily or indireétly to fome one  
near the prefident, that one of the  
Mr, Pinckneys would be agreeable  
at court. I never had an idea of  
any other influence than that, which  
is very common in Europe, when  
one government caufes intimations  
to be given to another, that the ap-  
pointment of fome particular gen-  
tleman would be agreeable. And I  
now believe, that my fufpicion of e-  
ven that kind of influence was whol-  
ly unfounded in reality though it had  
then fome color in appearance, ihe  
other infinuation, concerning the  
Pinckney family, had no other  
foundation than this: When I re-  
ceived my commiflion to the Court  
of St. James’s, I obferved in it a hi-  
mitation to three years. As 1 did  
not recolle&amp; any example of this  
before, 1 was at a lofs for the reafon  
of it, but as I did not intend at that  
time to remain in Europe, even fo  
Jong atime as three years, I thought  
very little of it, until afierwards on  
my arrival in Londonin 1785, I re-  
ceived information without inquiry,  
that Mr. Pinckney, a member of  
Congrefs from South-Carolina had

faid-that, ** the limitation ta three  
‘¢ years lad been inferted in my  
  
*¢ commillion for the purpofe “es  
  
‘© ting rid of me ; that the miffion  
‘6 to London was too good a  
‘¢ thing for me ; and that the in-  
** tention was, as foon as I could be  
‘© removed, to fend a Mr. Pinckney  
‘© of Soutk-Carolina in my room,”  
When I heard of a Mr, Pinckney’s  
appointment, this London informa-  
tion came into my mind, and divert.  
ed me, becaufe I fuppofed Mr. Pinck.  
ney after eight years had carried his  
point, and occafioned the fentiment  
expreffed in the letter, which, from  
the fportive, playful, carelefs air of  
it throughout, muff be eafily percei-  
ved to have been confidential, Ie  
may be eafily afcertained, who was  
the Mr, Pinckney, who was 3 mem-  
ber of Congrefs in 1784 or 1785,  
when my commiffion was granted,  
and dated,and when the limitation  
to three years was-inferted,  
  
On this occafion,it is but juftice &amp;  
duty in me to declare, that 1 have  
not at this time the {malleft reafon te  
believe or ifufpett, that you or your  
brotherever folicited any appointment  
under government abroad or at home,  
that the whole conduct of both as far  
as ithas came to my knowledge,(andf  
have had confiderable opportunities  
to know the condué of both fince  
1792) has fhown minds candid, able  
and independent, wholly free from  
  
any kind of influence from Britain °  
  
and from any improper bias in favor  
of that country or any other ; and that  
both have rendered, with honor and  
dignity to themfelves, great and im-  
portant fervices to our country.  
And I will add in the fincerity of my  
heart,that I know of no two gentlemen  
whofe characters and conduét are more  
deferving of confidence.

that there were more than two. W hen  
I heard of yoar appointment, I recol­  
lected the conversion with the Marquis  
of Carmarthen, now.Duke of Leeds,  
and imagined it probable, that his Lord-  
Ihip might have intimated dire&amp;ly or  
indireftly to some one near the President,  
that one of the Mr. Pinckney s would  
be agreeable at Court. I never had an  
idea of any other influence, than that,  
which is very common in Europe, when  
one government causes intimations to be  
given to another, that the appointment  
of some particular gentleman would be  
agbeeable. And I now fully believe,  
that my suspicion of even that kind of  
influence was wholly unfounded in rea­  
lity, though it had then some color, in  
appearance. The other insinuation, con­  
cerning the Pinckney family, had no  
other foundation than this When I  
received my commission to the Court of  
St. James&#x27;s. I observed in it a limitation  
to three years. As I did not recollect  
any example of this before, I was at a  
loss for the reason of it, but as I did not  
intend at that time to remain in Europe,  
even so long a time as three years, I  
thought very little of it, until afterwards  
on my arrival in London in 1785, I re­  
ceived information without inquiry, that  
Mr. Pinckney, a member of Congress  
from South Carolina, had said, that  
&quot; The limitation to three years had been  
&quot; inserted in my commission so&quot; the pur­  
&quot; pose of getting rid of me ; that the  
&quot; million to London Was too good a  
&#x27;\.thir.g for me ; and that the intention  
&quot; was, as soon as I could be removed,  
&quot;.to lend a Mr. Pinckney of SouthCa­  
&quot; roltaa in my room.&quot; When 1 heard  
of a Mr. Pinckney&#x27;s appointment, this  
London information came into my mind  
and diverted me, because I supposed Mr.  
Pinckney after eight years had carried  
his point, and occafioried the sentiment  
exprefled in the letter, -which, from the  
sportive, playful, careless- air of it  
throughout, must be easily perceived to  
have been confidential. It may be easily  
ascertained, who was the Mr. Pinckney,  
who was a member of Congress in 1784  
or 1785, when my commission was  
granted, and dated, and when ths limi­  
tation to three years was inserted.  
  
On this occaiion, it is but justice and  
duty in me to declare, that I have not  
at this time the smallest reason to believe  
or fufpe£t, that you or your brother ever  
folicitcd any appointment under govern­  
ment abroad or at home, that the whole  
conduft of both as far as it has come to  
my knowledge (and I have had conside­  
rable opportunities to know the conduft  
of both since 1792) has shown minds  
candid, able and independent, wholly  
free from any kind of influence from  
Britain, and from any improper bias, in  
favor of that country or any other ; and  
that both have rendered, with honor  
and dignity to themselves, great and  
important services to our country. And  
I will add in the fmcerity of my heart,  
that I know of no two gentlemen, whose  
characters and conduct are more deserv­  
ing of confidence.  
I cannot conclude without observing  
that we are fallen On evil times—or} evil  
times indeed are we fallen, if every pri­  
vate conversion is immediately to be  
betrayed and misrepresented in the news­  
papers, and if every frivolous and confi­  
dential letter is to be dragged by the  
hand of treachery from its oblivion of  
eight years, and published by malice  
and revenge, for the purpose of makilig  
mifchief.  
  
I am, -Sir,  
With great truth and regard,  
  
Your friend and humble servant,  
JOHN ADAMS.  
The Honorable  
Thomas Pinckney, Esq.  
Charleston, South Carolina.  
  
As your letter has been so long on its  
way to me, I lhall publish this answer  
immediately, which I hope you will ex­  
cuse. &lt;

“JT was only on yesterday that I  
, received the letter you did me  
the honor to write to me on the fix­  
teerth September, For the friendly  
and refpe@ful fyle in which it is  
wrilten, I pray you to accept of my  
heaity thanks, and you shall receive  
in my answer, all the fatisfacion in  
my/power to give you. :  
sOf the letter which is published  
inmy name, I have no copy nor any  
very. patticular recolledtion. In ge­  
?ral, I remember that when M.  
oxe was aflitant to the Secretary of  
the Treasury, he was very afliduous in  
his attention to me—made me many  
yifits at my house and many invita­  
tions to his own, when I was at the  
feat of government, and wrote me  
many letters when I was absent from  
it—l have also an indiftin&amp; idea of  
his writing me a letter, before your  
embarkation for Europe, expressing a  
% miﬂ;y, ﬂ;a; an Interview  
Iheuld take place, between you and  
me, before you should depart, and an  
opinion, that it would be in my pow­  
er to communicate to you some ufe­  
ful information, and advice, relative  
to the ftbje&amp;t of your mission. As I  
knew of nothing that could make it  
necessary for you, to take ;a journey  
to @y, or for me to go to Phila­  
delphia, it is probable, I wrote him  
fomethig’llgnlike the letter that is pub­  
lished—This however has been mani­  
fefily cither so. carelessly copied or  
unfaithfully printed, that I must re­  
fer to the original letter, which, if it  
is in my hand writing will be easily  
known.  
  
. “It may not be ealy for eto give  
. you a clear idea of the situation I  
Wwas 1, when that letter was written.  
In order to accomplish this neceflary  
purpose, as well as I can, it must be  
observed, that in® May 1792, it was  
my misfortune to be wholly unac­  
quainted with all the gentlemen who  
bear the name of Pinckney. I had  
never fe:n one of them in my life as  
I can :ecolle@, and knew not that  
there were more than two. When 1  
heard of your appointment, I recol­  
le@ed the conversation with the Mar­  
quis of Carmarthen, now Duke of  
Leeds, and imagined it probable, that  
his Lordhip might bave intimated  
dire&amp;ly or indireétly to some one  
near the President, that one of the  
Mr. Pinckneys would be agreeable at  
Court. I never had an idea of any  
-other infijßuce; than thar, which is  
very common- in Europe, when one  
government cayfes intimations to be  
given to another, that the appoint­  
ment of some particular gentleman  
would be agreeables &#x27; And I now  
fully believe, that my suspicion of e­  
ven that kind of influence was wholly  
unfounded in reality, though it had  
then some color, in appearance. The  
other information, concerning the  
Pinckney family, had no other foun­  
~dation than this : When I received  
‘my commission to the Court of St.  
James’, 1 observed in it a limitation  
to three years. As I did not recol­  
de&amp;t any example of this before, I was  
at a loss for thé reason of it, but as I  
did not intend at that time to remain  
in Europe -evén so- long a time as  
three years, I thought very little. of  
it, until afterwards o6n my arrwval in_  
London in 1785, I received informa­  
tion without inquiry, that Mr. Pinck­  
ney, a member of Congrefz from  
South-Carolina, had said, that *“lhe  
*hmitation to -three years had been  
  
inserted : mypcommiffion for “the  
~;rm‘ﬁpok of &#x27;gt,ﬁng rid of me ; that  
thes miiflion” to London was too  
““good a thing for me ; and that the  
“intention was, as foonas I could  
“be removed to fénd a Mr. Pinck­  
* ntey of South-Carolina in my room.”  
When I heard of a Mr. Pinckney’s  
appointment, this London informa­  
tion came into my mind and divert­  
ed me, because I supposed Mr, Pinck­  
ney after eight years had carried his  
point, and occasioned the sentiment  
exprefled in the letter, which, from  
the sportive, playful, careless air of it  
throughout, muit be easily perceived  
to have been confidential. It may  
be easily ascertained, who was the Mr.  
Pinckaey, who was a member of Con.  
grefs in 1784 or 1785, when my  
commission was granted, and dated,  
and when the limitation to three years  
was inserted.  
  
* On this otcafion, it is but justice  
and&quot;duty in me to declare, that I  
have not at this time the smallest rea­  
son to believe or fufpe&amp;, that you or  
your brother ever solicited any ap­  
pointment under governmenit abroad  
or at honte, that thé wbﬁtondti&amp;.of  
both as far as it has come @ty know­  
ledge (and I have had considerable  
opportunities to know the conduét of  
both since 1792) has shown minds  
candid, able and independent, wholly  
free from any kind of influénce from  
Britain, and from any improper bias  
in favour of that country or any oth­  
ér—and that” both™ have rendered,  
with Ronor and dignity to themielves,  
great and important services to our  
Country. And Iwill add in the since­  
rity of my heart, that I know of no  
two gentlemen, whose charaders and  
conduét are more deserving confi­  
dence.  
  
~ “1I capnot conclude without ob­  
serving that we are tallen on evii times  
—on evil times indecd are we fallen,  
if every private conversation is im­  
mediately to be betrayed and mis­  
represented in the newfpaptrs, and

It was only on yefle&#x27;day that I received the  
letter you tid me the honor to write me, on  
the fmeenth of Sepivmber. For the friendly  
and refpeilful ftyle, in which it is written, 1  
pi ay you to accept of my hearty thanks, and  
you fiiall receive in my anfwer, all the fatisfac­  
tion in my power to give you.  
Of the letter which is publlfhcd in try name,  
I have no copy nor any very particular recol­  
lection. In general, I remember, that whe«  
Mr. Coxe was afliftant to the Secretary of the  
Treafury, he was very afTidueus in his atten­  
tion to me—made me many vifits at my houfe  
and many invitations to his own, when I was  
at the feat of government, and wrote me many  
letters when I was abfent frem it. I have al­  
fo an indiflinCl idea of his writing me a letter,  
I before your embarkation for Europe, expreff.  
ing a great anxiety, that an interview fhould  
take place, between you and me, before you  
fhould depart, and an opinion, that it would  
be in my power to commnnicate to you fome  
ufeful information, and advice, relative to the  
fubjeCl of your million. As 1 knew of nothing  
that could make it neceflary for you to take a  
journey to Quincy, ot for me to go to Philadel­  
phia. it is probabk, 1 wrote hun fomething,  
like the letter, that is publifhed.—This how­  
ever, has been manifeflly ciiher fo carelefdy  
copied or unfaithfully printed, that I mull refer  
to the original letter, which, if it is in my hand­  
writing, will be cafilv known.  
** It may not be cafy for me to give you a  
clear idea of the fituation I was in. when that  
letter was written. In order to accomplifb this  
neceflary purpole, as well as I can, it mull be  
obferved, that in May, 1792, it was my mis­  
fortune to be wholly unacquainted with all the  
gentlemen who hear the name of Pinckney. I  
had never feen one of them in my life as 1 can  
recollect, and know not that there were more  
than two. When I heard of your appointment,  
I recollected the coaverfation with the Mar  
quis of Carmarthen now Duke of Leeds, and  
  
imagined it probable, that his Lordfhip might  
have intimated direftlv or indire&amp;ly to fome  
! one near th* Prefident, that one cf the Mr.  
Pinckneys would be agreeable at Court. J ne­  
ver had an idea of any other influence, than  
that, which is very common in Europe, when  
one government caufes intimations to be given  
to another, that the appointment of fome par  
ticular gentlemen would be agreeable. And I  
now fully believe, that my fufpicion of even  
that kind of influence was wholly unfounded  
in reality, though it had then fome color, in  
appearance. The other inflnuation, concerning  
the Pinckney family, had no other foundation  
than this ; When I received my commiffion to  
the Court of St. James&#x27;, I obferved in it a lim­  
itation to three yean. As I did rot recoiled  
any example of this before, I was at a lofs for  
the teafon of it, but as I did not intend at that  
time to remain in Europe even fo long a time  
as three years. I thought very little of it. un­  
til afterwards on my ai rival in London 1785.  
I received information without inquiry, that  
Mr. P’nckr.ey, a member of Congrefs from  
South Carolina, had laid, that “ The limitation  
“ to three yean had been inleitcd in my com.  
“ miflion for the purpofe of getting rid of me ;  
“ that the million to London was too good a  
“ thing for me ; and chat the intention was, as  
“ foon as I could be removed, to fend a Mr.  
“ Pinckney of South Carolina in my room.&quot;  
When i heard of a Mr. Pinckney’s appoint­  
ment, this London information came into my  
mind and diverted me, becaufe I fuppofed Mr.  
Pinckney after eight years had carried his point,  
and occafioned the fentiment exprefled in the  
letter, which, from the fportive, playful, care­  
lefs air of it throughout, muff be eafily per­  
ceived to have been confidential. It may be  
eafily afeertained, who was the Mr. Pinckney,  
who was a member of Congrefs in 1784, or  
1785, when my commiffion was granted, and  
dated, and when the limitation to three years  
was inferteJ.  
  
“ On this occafion, it is but jufiice and duty  
in me to declare that 1 have not at this time  
the fmalleft reafon to believe or fufpeft, that  
you or your brother even folicited any appoint,  
ment under government abroad or at home  
that the whole conduft of both as far as it has  
come to my knowledge (and I have had con­  
fiderable oppoitunities to k»ow the condinfl of  
both fince 1792) has fhown minds candid, able  
and independent, wholly free from any kind of  
influence from Britain, and from any improper  
bias in favor of that country or any other_  
and that both have rendered, with honor and  
dignity to thcmfelves great ar.d important fer­  
vices to our Country. And I will add In the  
fincerity of my heart that I know of no two  
gentlemen whofe characters and conduct are  
more deferring confidence.  
“ I cannot conclude without obfervlng that  
we are fallen on evil times—on evil times in­  
deed are welallen, if every private converfation  
is immediately to be betrayed and mifrepre­  
fented in the newfpapers, and if evetv fiivo­  
lous and confidential letter is to be d..kjgfed by  
the hand to treachery from its oblivion^eighi  
years and publifiicd by imlice and revenge for  
the purpofe &gt;1 making mifchict&#x27;.­  
I am Sir with great truth and regard your  
ft iend and humble fervant,  
JOHN ADAMS
