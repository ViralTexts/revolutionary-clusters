that they will sign the required declaration— 2dly that a number of persons who have heretofore obtained pre-emptions  
expect that Congress will convert them into absolute donations—3dly that there are considerations which ought to induce  
Congress to grant pre-emptions to persons who have settled on the public lands since the act of 1803.

expectations, a chearful compliance on their part with the law by signing the declaration &amp; thus acknowledging  
themselves to be tenants at will of the United States would not

law to prevent settlements is inapplicable to them: for their claims being   , recognised &amp; confirmed as pre-emptions, they will not be disturbed &amp; are positively excepted.
