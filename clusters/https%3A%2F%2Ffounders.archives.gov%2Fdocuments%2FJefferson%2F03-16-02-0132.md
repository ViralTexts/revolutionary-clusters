Monticello Aug. 4. 20.  
  
I owe you a letter for your favor of June 29. which was recieved in due time, and there being no subject of the day of particular interest I will make this a supplement to mine of Apr. 13. my aim in that was to justify the character of Jesus against the fictions of his pseudo-followers which have exposed him to the inference of being an impostor, for if we could believe that he really countenanced the follies, the falsehoods and the Charlatinisms which his biographers father on him, and admit the misconstructions, interpolations &amp; theorisations of the fathers of the early, and fanatics of the latter ages, the conclusion would be irresistible by every sound mind, that he was an impostor. I give no credit to their  falsifications of his actions &amp; doctrines; and, to rescue his character, the postulate in my letter asked only what is granted in reading every other historian. when Livy or Siculus, for example, tell us things which coincide with our experience of the order of nature, we credit them on their word, and place their narrations among the records of credible history. but when they tell us of calves speaking, of statues sweating blood, and other things against the course of nature, we reject these as fables, not belonging to history. in like manner, when an historian, speaking of a character well known and established on satisfactory testimony imputes to it things incompatible with that character, we reject them without hesitation, and assent to that only of which we have better evidence. had Plutarch informed us that Caesar &amp; Cicero passed their whole lives in religious exercises, and abstinence from the affairs of the world, we should reject what was so inconsistent with their established characters, still crediting what he relates in conformity with our ideas of them. so again, the superlative wisdom of Socrates is testified by all antiquity, and placed on ground not to be questioned. when therefore Plato puts into his mouth such fancies, such paralogisms &amp; sophisms as a schoolboy would be ashamed of, we conclude they were the whimsies of Plato’s own foggy brain, and acquit Socrates of puerilities so unlike his character. (speaking of Plato I will add that no writer antient or modern has bewildered the world with more ignes fatui than this renowned philosopher, in Ethics, in Politics &amp; Physics. in the latter, to specify a single example, compare his views of the animal economy, in his Timaeus, with those of mrs Bryan in her Conversations on chemistry, and weigh the science of the canonised philosopher against the good sense of the unassuming lady. but Plato’s visions have furnished a basis for endless systems of mystical theology, and he is therefore all but adopted as a Christian saint.—it is surely time for men to think for themselves, and to throw off the authority of names so artificially magnified. but to return from this parenthesis, I say that) this free exercise of reason is all I ask for the vindication of the character of Jesus. we find in the writings of his biographers matter of two distinct descriptions. first a ground work of vulgar ignorance, of things impossible, of superstitions, fanaticisms, &amp; fabrications. intermixed with these again are sublime ideas of the supreme being, aphorisms and precepts of the purest morality &amp; benevolence, sanctioned by a life of humility, innocence, and simplicity of manners, neglect of riches, absence of worldly ambition &amp; honors, with an eloquence and persuasiveness which have not been surpassed. these could not be inventions of the grovelling authors who relate them. they are far beyond the powers of their feeble minds. they shew that there was a character, the subject of their history, whose splendid conceptions were above all suspicion of being interpolations from their hands. can we be at a loss in separating such materials, &amp; ascribing each to it’s genuine author? the difference is obvious to the eye and to the understanding, and we may read; as we run, to each his part; and I will venture to affirm that he who, as I have done, will undertake to winnow this grain from it’s chaff, will find it not to require a moment’s consideration. the parts fall asunder of themselves as would those of an image of metal &amp; clay.  
There are, I acknolege, passages not free from objection, which we may with probability ascribe to Jesus himself; but claiming indulgence from the circumstances under which he acted. his object was the reformation of some articles in the religion of the Jews, as taught by Moses. that Seer had presented, for the object of their worship, a being of terrific character, cruel, vindictive, capricious and unjust. Jesus, taking for his type the best qualities of the human head and heart, wisdom, justice, goodness, and adding to them power, ascribed all of these, but in infinite perfection, to the supreme being, and formed him really worthy of their adoration. Moses had either not believed in a future state of existence, or had not thought it essential to be explicitly taught to his people. Jesus inculcated that doctrine with emphasis and precision. Moses had bound the Jews to many idle ceremonies, mummeries &amp; observances of no effect towards producing the social utilities which constitute the essence of virtue. Jesus exposed their futility &amp; insignificance. the one instilled into his people the most anti-social spirit towards other nations; the other preached philanthropy &amp; universal charity and benevolence.   the office of reformer of the superstitions of a nation is ever dangerous. Jesus had to walk on the perilous confines of reason and religion: and a step to right or left might place him within the gripe of the priests of the superstition, a bloodthirsty race, as cruel and remorseless as the being whom they represented as the family god of Abraham, of Isaac &amp; of Jacob, and the local god of Israel. they were constantly laying snares too to entangle him in the web of the law. he was justifiable therefore in avoiding these by evasions, by sophisms, by misconstructions and misapplications of scraps of the prophets, and of in defending himself with these their own weapons as sufficient, ad homines, at least. that Jesus did not mean to impose himself on mankind as the son of god physically speaking I have been convinced by the writings of men more learned than myself in that lore. but that he might conscientiously believe himself inspired from above, is very possible. the whole religion of the Jews, inculcated on him from his  infancy, was founded in this the belief of divine inspiration. the fumes of the most disordered imaginations were recorded in their religious code, as special communications of the deity; and as it could not but happen that, in the course of ages, events would now and then turn up to which some of these vague rhapsodies might be accomodated by the aid of allegories, figures, types, and other tricks upon words, they have not only preserved their credit with the Jews of all subsequent times, but are the foundation of much of the religions of those who have schismatised from them. elevated by the enthusiasm of a warm and pure heart, conscious of the high strains of an eloquence which had not been taught him, he might readily mistake the coruscations of his own fine genius for inspirations of an higher order. this belief carried therefore no more personal imputation, than the belief of Socrates that himself was under the care and admonitions of a guardian daemon. and how many of our wisest men still believe in the reality of these inspirations, while perfectly sane on all other subjects. excusing therefore, on these considerations, those passages in the gospels which seem to bear marks of weakness in Jesus, ascribing to him what alone is consistent with the great and pure character of which the same writings furnish proofs, and to their proper authors their own trivialities and imbecilities, I think myself authorised to conclude the purity and distinction of his character in opposition to the impostures which those authors would fix upon him: and that the postulate of my former letter is no more than is granted in all other historical works.  
M. Correa is here on his farewell visit to us. he has been much pleased with the plan and progress of our University and has given some valuable hints for it’s botanical branch. he goes to do, I hope, much good in his new country; the public instruction there, as I understand, being within the department destined for him. he is not without dissatisfaction, and reasonable dissatisfaction too with the piracies of Baltimore: but his justice and friendly dispositions will, I am sure, distinguish between the iniquity iniquities of that den of plunder and corruption, and the sound principles of our country at large, and of our government especially. from many conversations with him I hope he sees, and will promote, in his new situation, the advantages of a cordial fraternisation among all the American nations, and the importance of their coalescing in an American system of policy, totally independant of, and unconnected with that of Europe. the day is not distant when we may formally require a meridian of partition thro’ the ocean which separates the two hemispheres, on the hither side of which no European gun shall ever be heard, nor an American on the other: and when, during the rage of the eternal wars of Europe, the lion and the lamb, within our regions, shall lie down together in peace. the excess of population in Europe, and want of room, render war, in their opinion, necessary to keep down that excess of numbers. here, room is abundant, population scanty, and peace the necessary means for producing men, to whom the redundant soil is offering the means of life and happiness. the principles of society there and here then are radically different: and I hope no American patriot will ever lose sight of the essential policy of interdicting in the seas and territories of both Americas the ferocious and sanguinary contests of Europe. I wish to see this coalition begun. I am earnest for an agreement with the maritime powers of Europe assigning them the task of keeping down the piracies of their seas and the cani cannibalisms of the African coast, and to us the suppression of the same enormities within our seas: and for this purpose I should rejoice to see the fleets of Brazil and the US. riding together, as brethren of the same family, and pursuing the same object. and indeed it would be of happy augury to begin at once this concert of action here, on the invitation of either to the other government,

“There are, I acknowledge, passages  
not free from objection, which we may,  
with probability, ascribe to Jesus himself;  
but claiming indulgence from the circum-  
stances under which he acted. His ob-  
ject was the reformation of some articles  
in the religion of the Jews, as taught by  
Moses. That sect had presented for the  
object of their worship, a being of terri-  
fick character, cruel, vindictive, capricious  
and unjust. Jesus, taking for his type  
the best qualities of the human head and  
heart, wisdom, justice, goodness, and add-  
ing to them power, ascribed all of these,  
but in infinite perfection, to the Supreme  
Being, and formed him really worthy of  
their adoration. Moses had either not be-  
lieved in a future state of existence, or  
had not thought it essential to be expli-  
citly taught to his people. Jesus inculcat-  
ed that doctrine with emphasis and preci-  
sion. Moses had bound the Jews to many  
idle ceremonies, mummeries, and observ-  
ances, of no effect towards producing the  
social utilities which constitute the es-  
sence of virtue; Jesus exposed their futi-  
lity and insignificance. The one instilled  
into his people the most anti-social spirit  
towards other nations; the other preach-  
ed philanthropy and universal charity and  
benevolence. The office of reformer of  
the superstitions of a nation, is ever dan-

ous confines of reason and religion: and  
a step to right or left might place him

Dear Sip:i—l owe you a letter for  
yvousr favor of June the 20th, which was  
received in due time; and there being  
no subject of the day, of particutar inte­  
rest, I will moke this a supplement to  
ine OF LML M Y oa oo tha  
wns, 1o justify the R‘ﬂem of Jesus  
ngainst the fietions of his pseudo-follow­  
ers, which have exposed him to the infe­  
rence of being an unposter. Forif we  
could believe that he really countenanced  
the follies, the falsehoods, and the char­  
latanisms which his biographers father  
on htm, and admit the misconstructions,  
interpolations, and theorizations of the  
fathers of the early, and fanatics of the  
latter nges, the conelusion would be irre­  
cistible by every sound mind, that he was  
an imposter. I give no credit to their  
falsifications of his actions and doctrines,  
and to rescue his character, the postulate  
in my letter asked only what is granted  
in reading every other historian, When  
Livy and Siculus, for example, tell tu’  
things which coincide with our experi­  
ence of the order of nature, we eredit  
them on their word, aud place then nar­  
rations among the records of credible  
lustory. But when they tell us of colves  
speaking, of statues sweating blood, and |  
other things against the conrse of nuturc.&#x27;  
we reject these as fables not belonging to|  
history. In like manner, when an his-&#x27;  
torian, speaking of a charncter wvll‘  
known and established en satisfuctory |  
testimony, imputes to it things incom-|  
patible with that character, we reject  
thern without hesitation, and assent to  
that only of which we have be better cv-]  
idence. Had Plutareh informed us that |  
that Cesar and Cicero passed lllcir:  
whole lives in religions exercises, and’  
abstinence from the affairs of the world, |  
we should reject what was so incmmis-l  
tent with their established characters,  
atill erediting what he relates o confor- |  
mity with our ideas of them. So ngn_in.l  
the superlative wisdom of Socrates is  
testified by all antigmty, and placed on|  
ground not to be questioned. Wien,  
therefore, Plato putsinto his mouth such  
paralogism, such quibbles on words, nnd  
sophisms, as a school-boy would be  
ashamed of, we conclude they were the  
‘wihimsies of Plato’o own fogzy brain, and  
acquit Socrates of pucrlities so unlike  
his character. (Speaking of Plato, 1  
will add, that no writer, ancient or mod­  
ern, has bewildered the world with more  
ignes fatui, than this renowned philoso­  
pher, in Ethics, in Politics and Physics.  
In the latter, to specify a single example,  
compare Lis views of the animal econo­  
‘my, in his Timmus, aith those of Mre.  
Bryan in her Counversations on Chemis­  
‘try. and weigh the science of the canon­  
ized philosopher against the good sense  
of the unassuming lady. But Plato’s vis­  
ions haye furnished a basis for endless  
:systcms of mystical theology, and he is  
;thercfuro all &quot;but adopted a Chrisiian  
saint, It is surely time for men to think  
for themselyes, and to throw off the nu­  
thority of names so artificially magoified.  
But to return from this parenthesis.) |  
sny, that this free exercise of reason 18  
all 1 ask for the vindication of the char­  
acter of Jesus. We find in the writings  
of s biographers matter of two distinet  
  
VOL. 25.  
  
deseripyions. First, a grovnd-work of  
valgar ignoraunce, of things impossible,  
of superstitions, fanaticisms and fabrica­  
tions. Intermixed with these, ngain, are  
sublime ideas of the Supreme Being,  
aporisms, and precepts of the purest mo­  
rality and benevolence, sanctioned by a  
hife of humility, innocence, and simplici­  
ty of manners, neglect of riches, absence  
of worldly ambition and honors, with an  
eloquence and persusiveness which have  
not been surpassed. These could not be  
mventions of the grovelling authors who  
relate them. They are far beyond the  
powers of their feeble minds. They  
show that there was a charecter, the  
subject of their history, whose eplendid  
conceptions were above all suspicion of  
being interpolations from their hands.—  
Can we be at a loss in separaiing such  
‘materials, and asenbing each to its gen­  
wine anthor &#x27; &quot;The differonce is obvious  
to the eye and to the understanding, nnd  
‘we may read as we run to ench his part  
and I will venture to aflirm, hat he who,  
!lm I have done, will undertake to winnow  
this grain from its chafl, will find it not  
o require a moment’s consideration.—  
T&#x27;he parts fall asunder of thewsclves, as  
wonld those of an image f metal and  
clay.  
  
There are, 1 acknowledge, passages  
not free from objection, which we may,  
with probability, aseribe to Jesus lum­  
self; but elaiming indulgence from the  
circumstances under which he acted.—  
His object was the reformation of some  
articles in the religion of the Jews, as  
taught by Moses. &#x27;l&#x27;hat sect had presen­  
ted for the object of their worship, a be­  
ing of terrific character, cruel, vindie­  
tive, capricious and unjust. Jesus, taking  
for his type tho best qualities of the hu­  
man head and heart, wisdom, justice,  
goodness, and adding to them power, ns­  
cribed all of these, but in infinite perfec­  
tion, to the Supreme Being, and formed  
him really worthy of their adoration,—  
‘Moses had either not believed in a future  
state of existence, or had not thought it  
essontial to be explicitly taught to lus  
‘pcuplc. Jesus inculeated that doctrine  
with emphasis and precision, Muoses  
had bound the Jews to many idle cere­  
monieg, mummeries and observances, of  
no effect towards producing the cocial  
utilities which constitute the essence of  
vjrml‘.;JW‘ ilitymna -~  
insignificance. e ong instilled into  
his people the most anti-social spirit to­  
wards other nations 5 the other preached  
philanthropy and universal charity and  
benevolence. The office of reformer of  
the superstitions of a vation, is ever dan­  
gerous. Jesus had to walk on the peril­  
&#x27;oiis confines of reason and religion; and  
a step to right or left might place lnm  
within the gripe of the priests of the su­  
perstition, a blood-thirsty race, as cruel  
and remorscless as the being whom they  
represented as the family God of Abra­  
ham, of Isaae, and of Jacob, and the lo­  
cal God of Israel. &#x27;T&#x27;hey were constant­  
‘ly Inying snares, too, to entangle him in  
&#x27;the web of the law. 1e was justifinble,  
therefore, in avoiding these by evasions,  
hy sophisms, by nusconstructions, and  
misnpplications of scraps of the prophets,  
and in defending himsell with these their  
own weapons, ns sufficient, ad homincs,  
at lenst. That Jesus did not mean to im­  
pose himself on mankind as the Son of  
God, physically speaking, 1 have been  
convinced by the writings of men more  
loarned than myself in that lore. But  
that he might conscientionsly believe  
himself inspired from above, is very pos­  
gible. The whole religion of ‘he Jews,  
inculeated on him from his infancy, was  
founded in the belief of divine inspira­  
tion. &quot;The fumes of the most disordered  
imaginations were recorded i their re­  
ligious code, as special communications  
of the Deity ; and as it eould not but  
happen that, in the course of ages, events  
would now nnod then turn up to which  
some of these vague rhapsodies might be  
aceommodated by the aid of allegories,  
figures, types, and other tricks uwpon  
words, they have notonly preserved their  
eredit with the Jews of all subsequent  
times, but are the foundation of much of  
the religions of those who have schisma­  
tized from them. Elevated by the en­  
thusinsm of a warm and pure heart, con  
scious of the hig’ strains of an eloquence  
“ahich had not been taught him, he might  
readily mista&#x27; e the coruscations of ! s  
own fine geniue for inspirations of an  
&quot;lu’ghcr order. &quot;1 s belief, earried, there­  
fore, no more nersonal imputation, than

under the care and admonitions of a  
‘guardian Dmmon. And how many of  
!uur wisest men siill believe in the reality  
‘ul&#x27;lhcse inspirations, while pérfectly suue °  
on all other subjects. Excusing, there­  
‘,fnro, on these considerations, those pas­  
‘sages in the gospels which seem to bear  
‘marks of weakness in Jesus, ascribing to  
Lim what alone is consistent with the

of the later ages, the conclvrion sould be srerist  
sound mind that he was an importor.&quot;  
But he would vindicate the character of Jes  
from the New Testament, with its ground work of  
vulgar ignorance, of things impossible, of superst  
tions, fanaticiems and fabrications.&quot; He acknowl  
edges, nevertheless, that  
Jesus had to walk on the periious confnes of reason and  
religion; and a step to left or right might place him within  
the gripe of the priests of superstition a blood-thirsty race,  
as cruel and remorselees as the being whom they rep

sophirmt, by utaconsty wetiont and misopplicntions of  
serops of proghets, and in defending himself with these thei  
onen sccapons, as suflicient, ad homints, at least.&quot;  
Now the conduct which Mr. Jefferson thus sug­  
gests and justifies might do very well for a scursy  
politician, but we have an idea that he who at

The following extracts are from a letter to the same person,  
supplementary to the explanation of the Syllabus:  
  
“My aim in that was to justify the character of Jesus  
against the fictions of his pseudo followers, which have ex-  
  
him to the inference of being an impostor. For if we  
could believe that he really countenanced the follies, the  
falsehoods, the charlatanisms which his biographers father  
on him, and admit the misconstructions, interpolations, the-  
orizations, of the fathers of the early and the fanatics of  
the later ages, the conclusion is irresistible, by any sound  
mind, that he was an impostor. We find in the  
writings of his biographers matter of two distinct descrip-  
tions. First, a groundwork of vulgar ignorance, of things  
impossible, of superstitions, fanaticisms, and fabrications.  
Intermixed with these are sublime ideas of the Supreme  
Being, aphorisms and precepts of the purest morality and  
benevolence. These could not be the inventions of the  
groveling authors who relate them. They are far beyond the  
powers of their feeble minds, .... and I will venture to  
affirm that he who, as I have done, will undertake to winnow  
the grain from its chaff, will find it not to require a moment’s  
consideration. The parts fall asunder of themselves, as those  
of an image of metal and clay.”  
  
“There are, I acknowledge, passages not free from ob-  
jections, which we may with probability ascribe to Jesus  
himself; but claiming indulgence from the circumstances  
under which he acted, Jesus had to walk on  
the perilous confines of reason and religion; and a step to  
right or left might place him within the grasp of the priests.  
  
He was justified, therefore, in avoiding them by  
evasions, by sophisms, by misconstructions and misapplica-  
tions of scraps of the prophets, and in defending himself with  
these, their own weapons, as sufficient ad Aomines, at least.  
That Jesus did not mean to impose himself on mankind as  
the Son of God, physically speaking, I have been persuaded  
by the writings of men more learned than myself in that  
lore. But that he might conscientiously believe himself in-  
spired from above, is very possible. He might readil

&quot;20.. Correa is here on his farewell visit to us.  
  
He has beon much pleased with the plans and

valuable bints for its botanical branch. He goes  
to do, I hope, much good in bis new country,  
the public instruction there, as I understand,  
being within the department destined for  
him. He is not without - dissatisfaction,  
and reasonable dissatisfaction, too, with  
the piracies of Baltimore. But his justice and  
friendly dispositions will. I am sure, distinguish  
between the iniquities of that den of plunder  
and corruption and the sound - principles of  
our country at large, and of our government  
especially. From many conversations with  
him, I hope he sees and will promote in his  
new situation the advantages of a cordial frater­  
nization among all the American nations,  
and the importance of their coalescing in an  
American system of policy, totally independent  
of and unconnected with that of Europe. The

&quot;MoxTKKLr.o, Aug. 4, 1520.— The day

the ocean which separates the two hemi­

European gun shall ever be heard, nor

rope, the lion and the lamb, within our  
regions, shall lie down together in peace.  
Tho excess of population in Europe, and  
want of room, render war, in then* opin­  
ion, necessary to keej&gt; down that excess  
of numbers. Here room is abundant,  
population scanty, and peace the neoeSr

society here and there, then, are radically

of interdicting in the seas and territories

&quot;3IoxT!CELLO, Aug. 4,1820.?The day is  
not distant when we may formally require  
a meridian of partitition through the  
ocean which separates the two hemis?  
pheres, on the hither side of which no  
European gun shall ever be heard, nor an  
American on the other, and when, during  
the rage of the eternal wars of Europe,  
the lion and the lamb within our regions  
shall lie down together in peace. The ex?  
cess of population in Europe and want of  
room render war in their opinion neces?  
sary to keep down that excess of numbers.  
Here room is abundant, population scanty,  
and peace the necessary means for pro?  
ducing men, to whom the redundunt soil  
is offering the means of life and happi?  
ness. The principles of society here and  
there then are radically different, and 1

The strongest expression of the idea, so often heard,  
America for the Americans, is found in a private letter  
of August 4, 1820, of Jefferson to William Short. He  
says:  
  
‘*From many conversations with Mr. Corea, appointed. Min-

will promote in his new situation the advantages of a cordial fra-

MORE DISTANT THAN HE THOUGHT  
The day is not distant when we may  
formally require a meridian or parti­  
tion through the ocean which separ­  
ates the two hemispheres, on the hither  
side of which no European gun shall  
ever be heard, nor an American on the  
other and when, during the rage of  
the eternal wars of Europe, the lion  
and the lamb, within our regions, shall  
lie&#x27;down together in peace.—Thomas  
Jefferson.

&quot;From many conversations with him  
I hope ho sees, and will promote In his  
new situation, the advantages or a cor­  
dial fraternization among all the  
American nations, and the importance  
of their coalescing In an America sys  
tem of policy, totally Independent of  
and unconnected with that of Europe.  
The day Is not far distant when we may  
formally acquire a meridian or parti  
tion through the ocean which sep  
aratee tho two hemispheres, on the  
hither side of which no European gun  
ohall ever be hoard, nor an American  
. on &#x27;the1 other; and when, during&#x27; the  
rage of tho eternal wars of Europe, the  
lion and the lamb within our regions  
shall He down together in peace. . . . .  
The principles of society there and  
here, then, ar radically different, and  
I hope no American patriot will ever  
lose sight of the essential policy of In­  
terdicting in the Beas and territories  
of both Americas tho ferocious and  
sanguinary contests of Europe. I wish  
to see this coalition begun.
