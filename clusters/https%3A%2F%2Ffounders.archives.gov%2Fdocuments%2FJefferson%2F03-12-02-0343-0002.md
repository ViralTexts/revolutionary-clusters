In these 3. vols will be found copies of the official opinions given in writing by me to Genl Washington, while I was Secretary of state, with sometimes the documents belonging to the case. some of these are the rough draughts, some press-copies, some fair ones. in the earlier part of my acting in that office I took no other note of the passing transactions: but, after awhile, I saw the importance of doing it, in aid of my memory. very often therefore I made memorandums on loose scraps of paper, taken out of my pocket in the moment, and laid by to be copied fair at leisure, which however they hardly ever were. these scraps therefore, ragged, rubbed, &amp; scribbled as they were, I had bound with the others by a binder who came into my Cabinet, did it under my own eye, and without the opportunity of reading a single paper.   at this day, after the lapse of 25 years, f or more, from their dates, I have given to the whole a calm revisal, when the passions of the time are past away, and the reasons of the transactions act alone on the judgment. some of the informations I had recorded are now cut out from the rest, because I have seen that they were incorrect, or doubtful, or merely personal or private, with which we have nothing to do. I should perhaps have thought the rest not worth preserving, but for their testimony against the only history of that period which pretends to have been compiled from authentic and unpublished materials documents. could these documents, all, be laid

 of facts, omitted, or uncandidly stated in this history will shew that the contests of that day were contests of principle, between the advocates of republican, and those of kingly government, and that, had not the former made the efforts they did, our government would have been, even at this early day, a very different thing from what the succesful issue of those efforts have made it.  
The alliance between the states under the old articles of confederation, for the purpose of joint defence against the aggressions of Great Britain, was found insufficient, as treaties of alliance generally are, to enforce compliance with their mutual stipulations: and these, once fulfilled, that bond was to expire of itself, &amp; each state to become sovereign and independant in all things. yet it could not but occur to every one that these separate independancies, like the petty states of Greece, would be eternally at war with each other, &amp; would become at length the mere partisans &amp; satellites of the leading powers of Europe. all then must have looked forward to some further bond of union, which would ensure internal peace, and a political system of our own, independant of that of Europe. whether all should be consolidated into a single government, or each remain independant as to internal matters, and the whole form a single nation as to what was foreign only; and whether that National government should be a monarchy or republic, would of course divide opinions according to the constitutions, the habits and the circumstances of each individual. some officers of the army, as it has always been said and believed (and Steuben and Knox have even been named as the leading agents) trained to monarchy by military habits, are understood to have proposed to Genl Washington to decide this great question by the army before it’s disbandment, and to assume himself the crown, on the assurance of their support. the indignation with which he is said to have scouted this parricide proposition, was equally worthy of his virtue and his wisdom. the next effort was (on suggestion of the same individuals, in the moment of their

. the want of some authority, which should procure justice to the public creditors, and an observance of treaties with foreign nations, produced, some time after, the call of a convention of the States at Annapolis. altho’ at this meeting a difference of opinion was evident on the question of a republican or kingly government, yet, so general thro’ the states, was the sentiment in favor of the former, that the friends of the latter confined themselves to a course of obstruction only, and delay, to every thing proposed. they hoped that, nothing being done, and all things going from bad to worse, a kingly government might be usurped, and submitted to by the people, as better than anarchy, &amp; wars internal and external the certain consequences of the present want of a general government.  the effect of their maneuvres, with the defective attendance of deputies from the states, resulted in the measure of calling a more general convention, to be held at Philadelphia. at this the same party exhibited the same practices, and with the same views of preventing a government of concord, which they foresaw would be republican, and of forcing, thro anarchy, their way to monarchy. but the mass of that Convention was too honest, too wise, and too steady to be baffled or mislead by their maneuvres. one of these was, a form of government proposed by Colo Hamilton, which would have been in fact a compromise between the two parties of royalism &amp; republicanism. according to this, the Executive &amp; one branch of the legislature were to be for during good behavior, i.e. for life, and the Governors of the states were to be named by these two permanent organs. this however was rejected, &amp; on which Hamilton left the Convention, as desperate, &amp; never returned again until near it’s final conclusion. these opinions &amp; efforts, secret or avowed, of the advocates for monarchy, had begotten great jealousy thro’ the states generally; and this jealousy it was which excited the strong opposition to the conventional constitution; a jealousy which yielded at last only to a general determination to establish certain amendments as barriers against a government either monarchical or consolidated. in what passed thro’ the whole period of these conventions, I have gone on the information of those who were members of them, being absent myself on my mission to France.  
I returned from that mission in the 1st year of the new government, having landed in Virginia in Dec. 89. &amp; proceeded to N. York in March 90. to enter on the office of Secretary of State. here certainly I found a state of things which, of all I had ever contemplated, I the least expected. I had left France in the first year of it’s revolution, in the fervor of natural rights, and zeal for reformation. my conscientious devotion to these rights could not be heightened, but it had been arroused and excited by daily exercise. the President recieved me cordially, and my Colleagues &amp; the circle of principal citizens, apparently, with welcome. the courtesies of dinner parties given me as a stranger newly arrived among them, placed me at once in their familiar society. but I cannot describe the wonder and mortification with which the table-conversations filled me. politics were the chief topic, and a preference of kingly, over republican, government, was evidently the favorite sentiment. an apostate I could not be; nor yet a hypocrite: and I found myself, for the most part, the only advocate on the republican side of the question, unless, among the guests, there chanced to be some member of that party from the legislative houses. Hamilton’s financial system had then past. it had two objects. 1st as a puzzle, to exclude popular understanding &amp; enquiry. 2dly as a machine for the corruption of the legislature: for he avowed the opinion that man could be governed by one of two motives only, force or interest: force he observed, in this country, was out of the question; and the interests therefore of the members must be laid hold of, to keep the legislature in unison with the Executive. and with grief and shame it must be acknoleged that his machine was not without effect. that even in this, the birth of our government, some members were found sordid enough to bend their duty to their interest, and to look after personal, rather than public good. it is well known that, during the war, the greatest difficulty we encountered was the want of money or means, to pay our souldiers who fought, or our farmers, manufacturers &amp; merchants who furnished the necessary supplies of food &amp; clothing for them. after the expedient of paper money had exhausted itself, certificates of debt were given to the individual creditors, with assurance of payment, so soon as the US. should be able. but the distresses of these people often obliged them to part with these for the half, the fifth, and even a tenth of their value; and Speculators had made a trade of couzening them from the holders, by the most fraudulent practices and persuasions that they would never be paid. in the bill for funding &amp; paying these, Hamilton made no difference between the original holders, &amp; the fraudulent purchasers of this paper. great &amp; just objections were repugnance arose at putting these two classes of creditors on the same footing, and great exertions were used to pay to the former the full value, and to the latter the price only which he had paid, with interest. but this would have prevented the game which was to be played, &amp; for which the minds of greedy members were already tutored and prepared. when the trial of strength on these several efforts had indicated the form in which the bill would finally pass, this being known within doors sooner than without, and especially than to those who were in distant parts of the Union, the base scramble began. couriers &amp; relay horses by land, and swift sailing pilot boats by sea, were flying in all directions. active partners &amp; agents were associated &amp; employed in every state, town and country neighborhood, and this paper was bought up at 5/ and even as low as 2/ in the pound, before the holder knew that Congress had already provided for it’s redemption at par. immense sums were thus filched from the poor &amp; ignorant, and fortunes accumulated by those who had themselves been poor enough before. men thus enriched by the dexterity of a leader, would follow of course the chief who was leading them to fortune, and become the zealous instruments of all his enterprizes. this game was over, and another was on the carpet at the moment of my arrival; and to this I was most ignorantly &amp; innocently made to hold the candle. this fiscal maneuvre is well known by the name of the Assumption. independantly of the debts of Congress, the states had, during the war, contracted separate and heavy debts; and Massachusets particularly in an absurd attempt, absurdly conducted, on the British post of Penobscot: and the more debt Hamilton could rake up, the more plunderer for his mercenaries. this money, whether wisely or foolishly spent, was pretended to have been spent for general purposes, and ought therefore to be paid from the general purse. but  it was objected that nobody knows knew what these debts were, what their amount, nor what their proofs. no matter; we will guess them to be 20. millions. but of these 20. millions we do not know how much should be reimbursed to one state, nor how much to another. no matter; we will guess. and so another scramble was set on foot among the several states, and some got much, some little, some nothing. but the main object was obtained, the phalanx of the treasury was reinforced by additional recruits. this measure produced the most bitter &amp; bloody angry contests ever known in Congress, before or since the union of the states. I arrived in the midst of it. but a stranger to the ground, a stranger to the actors on it, so long absent as to have lost all familiarity with the subject, and as yet unaware of it’s object, I took no concern in it. the great and trying question however was lost in the H. of Representatives. so high were the feuds excited by this subject, that on it’s rejection, business was suspended. Congress met and adjourned from day to day without doing any thing., the parties being too much out of temper to do business together. the Eastern members particularly, who, with   some Smith from South Carolina, were the principal gamblers in these scenes, threatened a secession and dissolution. Hamilton was in despair. as I was going to the President’s one day, I met him in the street. he walked me backwards &amp; forwards before the door President’s door for half an hour. he painted pathetically the temper into which the legislature had been wrought, the disgust of those who were called the Creditor states, the danger of the secession of their members, and the separation of the states. he observed that the members of the administration ought to act in concert, that tho’ this question was not of my department, yet a common duty should make it a common concern; that the President was the center on which all administrative questions ultimately rested, and that all of us should rally around him, and support with joint efforts measures approved by him; and that the question having been lost by a small majority only, it was probable that an appeal from me to the judgment and discretion of some of my friends might effect a change in the vote, and the machine of government, now suspended, might be again set into motion. I told him that I was really a stranger to the whole subject; not having yet informed my self of the system of finance adopted, I knew not how far this was a necessary sequence; that undoubtedly if it’s rejection endangered a dissolution of our union at this incipient stage, I should deem that the most unfortunate of all consequences, to avert which all partial and temporary evils should be yielded. I proposed to him however to dine with me the next day, and I would invite another friend or two, bring them into conference together, and I thought it impossible but that reasonable men, consulting together coolly, could fail, by some mutual sacrifices, of opinion, to form a compromise which was to save the union. the discussion took place. I could take no part in it, but an exhortatory one, because I was a stranger to the circumstances which should govern it. but it was finally agreed that, whatever importance had been attached to the rejection of this proposition, the preservation of the union, &amp; of concord among the states was more important, and that therefore it would be better that the vote of rejection should be rescinded, to effect which some members should change their votes. but it was observed that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the Southern states, and that some concomitant measure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them.   there had before been propositions to fix the seat of government either at Philadelphia, or at George town on the Patomac; and it was thought that by giving it to Philadelphia for ten years, and to George town permanently afterwards, this might, as an anodyne, calm   
in some degree the ferment which might be excited by the other measure alone. so two of the Patomac members (White &amp; Lee,  but White with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive) agreed to change their votes, &amp; Hamilton undertook to carry the other point. in   
doing this the influence he had established over the Eastern members, with the agency of Robert Morris with those of  the middle states, effected his side of the engagement, and so the assumption was passed, and 20. millions of stock divided among favored states, and thrown in as pabulum to the stock-jobbing herd. this added to the number of votaries to the treasury and made it’s Chief the master of every vote in the legislature which might give to the government the direction suited to his political views. I know well, and so must be understood, that nothing like a majority in Congress had yielded to this corruption. far from it. but a division, not very unequal, had already taken place in the honest part of that body, between the parties now styled republican and federal. the latter being monarchists in principle, adhered to Hamilton of course, as their leader in that principle, and this mercenary phalanx added to them ensured him always a majority in both houses: so that the whole action of the legislature was now under the direction of the treasury. still the machine was not compleat. the effect of the funding system, &amp; of the assumption, would be temporary. it would be lost with the loss of the individual members whom it had enriched, and some engine of influence more permanent must be contrived, while these Myrmedons were yet in place to carry it thro’ all opposition. this engine was the Bank, of the US. all that history is known; so I shall say nothing about it. while the government remained at Philadelphia, a selection of members of both houses were constantly kept as Directors, who, on every question interesting to that institution, or to the views of the federal head, voted at the will of that head; and, together with the stock-holding members, could always make the federal vote that of the majority. by this combination, legislative expositions were given to the constitution, and all the administrative laws were shaped on the model of England, &amp; so passed. and from this influence we were not relieved until the removal to Washington, and from the precincts of the bank to Washington. here then was the real ground of the opposition which was made to the course of administration. it’s object was to preserve the legislature pure and independant of the Executive, to restrain the administration to republican forms and principles, and not permit the constitution to be construed into a monarchy, and to be warped in practice into all the principles and pollutions of their favorite English model. nor was this an opposition to Genl Washington. he was true to the republican charge confided to him; &amp; has solemnly and repeatedly protested to me, in our private conversations, that he would lose the last drop of his blood in support of it. and he did this the oftener, and with the more earnestness, because he knew my suspicions of Hamilton’s designs against it; &amp; wished to quiet them. for he was not aware of the drift, or of the effect of Hamilton’s schemes. unversed in financial projects &amp; calculations, &amp; budgets, his approbation of them was bottomed on his confidence in the man. but Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but for a monarchy bottomed on corruption. in proof of this I will relate an anecdote, for the truth of which I attest the God who made me. before the President sat out on his Southern tour in April 1791. he addressed a letter of the 4th of that month, from Mt Vernon to the Secretaries of State, the Treasury &amp; War, desiring that, if any serious and important cases should arise during his absence, they would consult &amp; act on them, and he requested that the Vice-president should also be consulted. this was the only occasion on which that officer was ever requested to take part in a Cabinet question. some occasion for consultation arising, I invited those gentlemen (and the Attorney genl as well as I remember) to dine with me in order to confer on the subject. after the cloth was removed, and our question agreed &amp; dismissed, conversation began on other matters and, by some circumstance, was led to the British constitution, on which mr Adams observed ‘purge that constitution of it’s corruption, and give to it’s popular branch equality of representation, and it would be the most perfect constitution ever devised by the wit of man.’ Hamilton paused paused and said, ‘purge it of it’s corruption, and give to it’s popular branch equality of representation, &amp; it would become an impracticable government: as it stands at present, with all it’s supposed defects, it is the most perfect government which ever existed.’ and this was assuredly the the exact line which divides separated the political creeds of these two gentlemen. the one was for two hereditary branches and an honest elective one: the other for a hereditary king with a house of lords &amp; commons, corrupted to his will, and standing between him and the people. Hamilton was indeed a singular character. of acute understanding, disinterested, honest, and honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private life, yet so fascinated bewitched &amp; perverted by the British example, as to be under thoro’ conviction that corruption was essential to the government of a nation. mr Adams had originally been a republican. the glare of royalty and nobility, during his mission to England, had made him believe their fascination a necessary ingredient in government, and Shays’s rebellion, not sufficiently understood where he then was, seemed to prove that the absence of want and oppression was not a sufficient guarantee of order. on his return to America, he his book on the American constitutions having made known his political bias, he was taken up by the monarchical federalists, in his absence, and on his return to the US. he was by them made to believe that the general disposition of our citizens was favorable to monarchy. he here wrote his Davila as a supplement to the former work, and his election to the Presidency confirmed him in his belief errors. innumerable addresses too, artfully and industriously poured in upon him, decieved him into a beli confidence that he was on the pinnacle of popularity, when the gulph was yawning at his feet which was to swallow up him and his decievers. for, when Genl Washington was withdrawn, these men, energumeni of royalism, kept in check till now hitherto by the dread of his honesty, his firmness, his patriotism, and the authority of his name now, mounted on the Car of state &amp; free from controul, like Phaëton on that of the sun, drove headlong &amp; wild, looking neither to right nor left, nor regarding any thing but the objects they were driving at; until, displaying these fully, the eyes of the nation were opened, and a general disbandment of them from the public councils took place.   mr Adams, I am sure, has been long since convinced of the treacheries with which he was surrounded during his administration. he has since thoroughly seen that his constituents were devoted to republican  government, and whether his judgment is re-settled on it’s antient basis, or not, he is conformed as a good citizen to the will of the majority, and would now, I am persuaded, maintain it’s republican structure, with the zeal and fidelity belonging to his character. for even an enemy has said ‘he is always an honest man, &amp; often a great one.’ but in the fervor  of the fury and follies of those who made a him their stalking horse, of him no man who did not witness it, can form an idea of their unbridled madness, and the terrorism with which they surrounded themselves. the horrors of the French revolution, then raging, aided them mainly, and using that as a raw head and bloody bones they were enabled by their stratagems of X.Y.Z. in which this historian was a leading mountebank their tales of tub-plots, Ocean massacres, bloody buoys, and pulpit lyings, and slanderings, and maniacal ravings of their Gardiners, their Osgoods and Parishes, to spread alarm into all but the firmest breasts. their Attorney General had the impudence to say to a republican member that deportation must be resorted to, of which, said he, ‘you republicans have set the example,’ thus daring to identify us with the murderous Jacobins of France. these transactions, now recollected but as dreams of the night, were then sad realities; and nothing rescued us from their liberticide effect but the unyielding opposition of those   
firm spirits who sternly maintained   
their post, in defiance of terror, until their fellow citizens could be arroused to their own danger, and rally, and rescue the standard of the constitution. this has been happily done. federalism &amp; monarchism have languished from that moment, until their treasonable combinations with the enemies of their country during the late war, their plots of dismembering the Union, &amp; their Hartford convention, has consigned them to the tomb of the dead: and I fondly hope we may now truly say ‘we are all republicans; we are all federalists,’ and that the motto of the standard to which our country will for ever rally, will be ‘federal union, and republican government:’ and sure I am we may say that we are indebted, for the preservation of this point of ralliance, to that opposition of which so unfavorable injurious an idea is so artfully insinuated &amp; excited in this history.  
Much of this relation is notorious to the world, &amp; many intimate proofs of it will be found in these notes. from the moment, where they end, of my retiring from the administration, the federalists got

unchecked hold of Genl Washington. his memory was already sensibly impaired by age, the firm tone of mind, for which he had been remarkable, was beginning to relax, it’s energy was abated; a listlesness of labor, a desire for tranquility had crept on him, and a willingness to let others act and even think for him. like the rest of mankind, he was disgusted with the atrocities of the French revolution, and was not sufficiently aware of the difference between the rabble who were used as instruments of their perpetration, and the steady &amp; rational character of the American people, in which he had not sufficient confidence. the opposition too of the republicans to the British treaty, and zealous support of the federalists in that unpopular, but favorite measure of theirs, had made him all their own. understanding moreover that I disapproved of that treaty, &amp; copiously nourished with falsehoods by a malignant neighbor of mine, who ambitioned to be his correspondent, he had become alienated from my self personally, as from the republican body generally of his fellow citizens; &amp; he wrote the letters to mr Adams, and mr Carrol, over which, in devotion to his imperishable fame, we must for ever weep as monuments of mortal decay.

B”t Hamilton was n &gt;t cn- v Munvchi.rt. hut f„. a  
Monarchy bottomed on corruption. In proof of this I  
will relate an anecdote, Tor the truth of which I attest  
the God who made me. Before t&#x27;ae President sot out on  
his southern tour in April 1T:&gt;], lie addressed a letter of  
the 14th of that month, fro:n# M.ni it Vern &gt;n to llie Se­  
cretaries of State, the Treasury and \V..r, drsirlm* that,  
if any important eases should arise durln.* his absence,  
they would consult and act on them, and he ioquested  
tliat tin; \ ice President should also bo consulted. This  
was the only occasion on which that officer was ever re­  
quested to take part in a Cabinet quest a. Same occa­  
sion of consultation arising, 1 invited those gentlemen  
(and the Attorney General, as well as 1 remember) to  
cine with mo in order to confer on the subject. After the  
• ioth was removed, and our question agreed and dismiss­  
ed, conversation began on other matters, and hy some, cir­  
cumstance, was led to the British Constitution, on which  
Mt. Adams observed “ purge that Constitution of its cor­  
ruption, and givo to its popular branch equality of repre­  
sentation, and it would be the most perfect constitution  
devised by the wit of man.” Hamilton paused ami said,  
“ Pnrf?c °f its corruption, and give to its popular branch  
-•quality of representation,«fc it would become an i mpracti­  
fwble government: as it stands at present, with all its sup­  
posed defects, it is -the most perfect government which  
ever Existed.” And this was assuredly the exact line  
which separated the political creeds of these two gentle­  
men. Tlio one was for two hereditary branches and an  
honest elective one : the other for a hereditary King  
a House of J.ords and Commons, coriuptcd to his  
will, and standing between him mid the people, ilamil­  
  
ion was indeed a singular cunrnctcr.tJt acute understand­  
ing, disinterested, Inmost, and honorable in ail private  
transactions, amiable in society, nv.d duly valuing virtue  
in privates life, yet so bewildered and perverted by tho  
British example as to be under a llioro’ conviction that  
corruption was essentitf to tho government of a nation.  
Mr. Adams had originally bean a republican, tho glare of  
rtrprtty and nobility, during his inhesion to F.ngland, hid  
marie him believe-their fascination a necessary ingredi­  
ent in government, and Nhny&#x27;s rebellion, r ot sufficiently  
understood where ho then was, seemed to prove that  
tho absence of want and oppression was not a suffi­  
cient- guarantee of order. 11 is bonk on the Aiut-rican Con­  
stitutions having made known his political bias, he was  
token ::p by-the Monarchical Federalists, in hie. absence,  
nml on his return to the L&#x27;. N. he was by the.n made to  
believe that the general disposition of our citizen* was  
favorable to Monarchy. He here wrote his Davila as a  
mippliinent to the former work, and his election to the  
Presidency confirmed his errors. Innumerable addresses  
too. artfully and industriously poured in upon him, dc­  
eieved him into a confidence that he was on the pinocle  
&lt;tf prosperity, w hen the pulpit was yawning at his feci,  
w hich was to swallow up him and his deceivers. For when  
fleneral Washington was withdrawn, these energntneni  
of royalism, kept in check hitherto by the dread of his  
honesty, -his firmness, hi ■ patriotism, and the authority of  
his name, flow mounted on the car of Stnlo and free Imrn  
controul. like Phaeton on that of tho Nun, drove head­  
long” and wild, looking neither to right nor left, nor re­  
garding any thing bu^lhc objects they were driving nt:  
until, displaying these fully, the eyes of the nation were  
opened, and a g moral disbandment of them from the  
public councils fookftlacc. Mr. AdaI am sure, has  
been king since convinced of the treacheries with which  
he was surrounded during his administration. He ha*  
since thoroughly seen tint his constituent&#x27;- were devoted  
to republican gtvornment, and whether his judgment  
is re-settled on it-j ancient basis, or not. he is con­  
formed as a good citizen t &gt; the will of tho majori­  
ty, and woo#! n &gt;w, I am persuaded, maintain ;ts  
republican structure, with the zeal and fidelity &#x27;belong­  
ing to his character. For even an enemy ha* slid “ In­

But Hamilton was not only a Monarchist hut for  
a Monarchy bottomed on corruption. In proof of  
tnis I will relate an anr.rdotc, for tho truth of  
which I attest tiic God who made me. Before i  
llm President set out on his southern tour in April  
1791, he addressed a letter of the 14th 0f that  
mouth, trom Mount Vernon to tho Secretaries ot J  
State, the Treasury and War, desiring that, if any :  
important eases should at ise during his absence,  
they would consult and act on them, and he re­  
quested that the Vice President should also be con- i  
suited. This was the only occasion on whirii that  
officer was ever requested to take part in a Cabi­  
net question. Some occasion of consultation ari-&#x27;  
sing, I invited those gentlemen (and the Attorney  
General, as well as 1 remember) to dine with me  
in order to confer on the subject. After the doth  
was removed, and our question agreed and dismiss­  
ed, conversation began on other matters, and by  
some circumstance, was led to the British Consti­  
tution,on which Mr. Adams observed «• purge that  
Constitution of its coi ruption, and give to it7 popu­  
lar branch equallityof representation, and it would  
be the most perfect constitution devised by the wit  
ot man ” Hamilton paused and said, “ purge it of  
its corruption, and give to its « •&gt;ii!.lr branch  
equalhty of representation, Sic. it would become an  
impracticable government; ns it stands ;»t present,&#x27;  
with all its supposed defects, it is the me .t perfect !  
government which ever existed.” And this wn­  
assuredly the e.\ ict line which separated the pnli- |  
tical creeds of these two gentlemen. The one wa»J  
or two hereditary branchi s and an honest elective &#x27;  
one: tho other for a hereditary King with •* i;(,.|*e ’  
ol Lords and Commons, corrupted to hi* will, Hnd i  
standing between him and the people. Hamilton  
was indeed a singular character. Of acute under­  
standing, disinterested, honest, and honorable in all  
private transactions, amiable in society, and duly  
valuing virtue in piivnte life, yet so &#x27;bewildered  
and perverted by the British example as to be under  
a tiiorougii conviction that corruption was essential  
to the government of a nation.  
Mr. Adams had originally been a republican, the  
glare of royalty and nobility, during his mission to  
l.ngUhd. had made him believe their fascination a  
necessary ingredient in government, and Shay&#x27;s  
rebellion, not sufficiently understood where ho  
then was, seemed to pruvo that (lie absence of  
want and oppression was not a sufficient gu .ran­  
tee of order. His book on the American Consti­  
tutions having made known his political liift.s be  
| was taken up by tho Monarchical federalists’, in  
bis absence, and on his return to tho If. S. he w t«  
by tiiern made to believe that the generaldimo-i  
tlon of our citizens was favorable fo Monarchy —  
He here wrote his Davila as a suppliment to the  
former work, and his election to tho Presidency  
confirmed his errors. Innumerable addresses too  
artfully an I industriously poured in upon him’,  
deceived him into a confidence that ho was on (he  
I pinnacle of prosperity, when the gulph was yawn­  
| mg at Ins feet which was to swallow up him and  
bis deceivers. For when General kVa-hington  
was wit &#x27;drawn, these energurrienl of royalism,  
kept m check hitherto hy the dread of hi* honesty,  
Jus firmness, his patriotism, and the authority of

tboy wore driving at: until, displaying these fUy  
tho eyes of the nation Were op-ned. and a genera!  
disbandment of therq from the public count ils took ’  
pHce. Mr. Adams, lam sure, has been lon^i  
since convinced of the treacheries with which!  
be was surrounded during his a lrrdni«f ration. Hcl  
has «ince fho-ougbly seen that his constituents  
were devoted to republican government, and whe­  
t.ier his judgment is ra-setfiedWti its ancient bads,  
or not. he is conformed as a good citizen to the

no man who did not witness it. ran firm an idea  
of their unbridled madness, and the ferrotism with  
which they surrounded themselves. The horrors  
of the French revolution then raging, aided them  
mainly, and using that a a raw head and bloody  
I tone-’, they were enabled by their stratagem*  
their tales oftuh-plots. ocean massacres, bloody  
buoy-, an* pulpit lyings and slandering*, and mani­  
acal ravings of their (Gardners, iheir Osgoods and  
Parishes, to «p-.id alarm into all hut tK-* firmest  
breasts. riicir Attorney (Si-ner.il had the impu­  
dence to say to a republican m-m&#x27;.cr tint deporta­  
tion must he resorted to. ut which, said he, you  
republicans have set the example, thus dating to  
identify us with the murderous Jacobins of France.  
Tit se transactions, now recollected hut as dreams  
of th night, were then sad realities, ami nothing  
respiu d us from their lihcrtieidc effect hut the un- j  
yielding oppu*ition of those tirm spirits who stern­

til t eir lellow-citi/.ens could lie aroused to their  
own danger, and rally, and re-cue the standard of  
the constitution. This has been happily done.—

sad realities, and nothing rescued  
us from their liberticide effect but  
the unyielding opposition of th  
  
firm spirits who sternly maintain­

could be aroused to their own

“But tlamliton was not only a Monarchist, but

of this I will relate an anecdote, for the truth I  
attest the God who made me. Before the Presi­

he addressed a letter of the 14th of that month,  
from Mount Vernon to the Secretaries of State,  
the Treasury, and War, desiring that, if any im­  
portant case should arise during his absence,  
they would consult and act on them. and he re­  
quested that the Vice President should alsc be  
consulted. This was the only occasion on which  
that officer was ever requested to take partin  
a Cabinet question. Some oceasion of consulta­  
tion nrisin(%. linvited those gentlemen (and the  
Attorney General, as well as [ remember) to dine  
with me in order to confer on the subject. Afier  
the cloth was removed, and our question agreed  
and dismissed, conversation began on other mat­  
ters, and by some circumstance was led to the  
British Constitution, on which. Mr. Adams ob­  
served “purge that constitution of its corruption,  
and give to its popular branch equality of repre­

they would consult and act on thein, and he re­  
quested that the Vice President should also be  
consulted. This was the only occasion on which  
that officer was ever requested to take part in  
a Cabinet question. Some oceasion of consulta­  
tion arising, I&#x27;invited these gentlemen (and the  
Attorney General, as well as Igremembcr) to dine  
with me in order to confer on the subject. After.  
the cloth was removed, and our question agreed  
and dismissed, conversation began on other mat­  
ters, and by some circumstance was led&#x27;to the  
British Constitution, on which Mr. Adams ob­  
served “purge that constitation of its corraption,  
and give to its popular branch equality of repre­  
sentation, and it would be the most perfect con­  
stitution devised by the wit of man.”” Hamilton |  
paused and said “purge it of its corruption, and  
give to its popular branch equality of represen­  
tation, and it would become an impracticable  
government : as it stands at present, with all its  
supposed defects, it is the most perfect govern­  
ment which ever®existed.” And this was as­  
suredly the exact line which separated the polit­  
ical creeds of these two gentlemen. The one  
was for two hereditary branches and an honest  
elective one : the other for a hereditary King  
with a house of Lords and Commons, corrupted  
to his will, and standing between him and the  
people. Hamilton was indeed a singular charac­  
ter. Of acute understanding, disinterested,  
honest and honorable in all private transac­  
tions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue  
in private life, yet so bewildered and perverted  
by the British example as to be under a thoro’  
conviction that corruption was essential to the  
government of a nation. Mr. Adams had orig­  
inally been a republican, the glare of royalty  
and nobility, during his mission to England, had  
made him believe their fascination a mecessary  
ingredient in government, and Shay’s rebellion,  
not sufficiently understood where Le then was,  
seemed to prove that the absence of want and |  
oppression was not a sufficient guarantee of or­  
der. His book on the American Constitutions  
having made known his political bias, he was  
taken up by-the Monarchical Federalists, in his  
absence, and on his return to the U. S. he was  
by them made to believe that the general dispo- |  
sition of our citizens was favorable to Monarchg. |  
He here wrote his Davillaas a sulgglement to the  
former work, and his election tothe Presidency  
confirmed his errors. Innumerable addresses  
too, artfully and industriously poured in upon  
him, deceived him into a confidence that lie was  
on the pinnacle of prosperity, when the gulph  
was yawning at his feet which was to swallow  
up him and his deceivers. For when General  
V{;ashinaton was withdrawn, these energumeni  
of royaﬁsm, kept in check hitherto by the dread  
of his honesty, his firmness, his patriotism, and  
the authority of his name, now mounted on the  
car of State and free from control, like Phae­  
ton on that of the Sun, drove headlong and wild,  
looking neither to right nor left, nor regarding  
any thing but the objects they were driving at: |  
until displaying these fully, the eyes of the na- ‘  
tion were opened, and a general disbandment  
of them from the public councils took place.—  
Mr. Adams, I am sure, has been long since con­  
vinced of the treacheries with which he was |  
surrounded during his administration. He has  
since thoroughly seen that his constituents were |  
devoted to republican government, and wheth- |  
er his judgment is re-settled on its ancient basis, |  
or not, he is conformed as a good citizen to the  
will of the majority, and would now, I am per­  
suaded, maintain its republican structure, with |  
the zeal and fidelity belonging to his character.  
For even an enemf{ has said, “be is always an  
honest man and often a great one,” but in the  
fury and follies of those who made him their  
smﬁiing horse, no man who did not witness it,  
can form an idea of their unbridled madness,  
and the terrorism with which they surrounded  
themselves. The horrors of the French revolu­  
tion thon raging, aided them mainly, and using  
this as a raw head and bloody liones *they*werﬁ  
enabled by their stratagems i  
their tales of tub-plots, ocean massacres, bloo ﬁ  
buoys, and pulpit lying and slanderings, an  
g £ their Gardeners, their Os­  
maniacal ravings o s  
goods and Parishes, to spread alarm into all but

which, said he, you rppubhgans have seth e ex­  
ample, thys darln% to identify us with the.mur­  
derous Jacobins of France.—These transactions,  
now recollected but as dreams of the nelght,  
were then sad realitics, and nothing rescued us  
from their liberticide eﬁfept: but the unreldl&#x27;ng  
opposition of those firm spirits who sternly mami  
tained their post, in defiance of terror, u}_x’xg  
their fellow-citizens could be aroused to td el;  
own danger, and mllyf and rescue the gtm(li ar  
of the constitution. This has been happily d o}:le.  
Federalism and monarchism have _lan%ms ed  
from that moment, until their treasonable cgm_-  
binations with the enemies of their country dur­  
ing the late war. Their plots of dismembering  
thg Union, and their Hartford Conrlen‘tln?n, flmf  
consigned them to the tomb of the ‘t‘m ; an all  
fondly hope We may now truly szx, we are

j and many intimate proofs of i will be found in  
these notes.—From the moment, where they  
end, of my retiring from the administration, the  
Federalists got unchecked hold of General  
Washington. His memory was already sensibly  
impaired. by age, the firm tone of mind for  
which he had been remarkable, was beginning  
to relax, its energy was abated-; a listlessness of  
labor, a desire for tranquility had crept on him,  
and a willingness to let others act and even think  
for him. Like the rest of mankind he was dis­  
gusted with theatrocities of the French revolu­  
tion, and was not sufficiently aware of the differ­  
ence between the rabble who were used as the  
instruments of their perpetration, and the stea­  
-dy and rational character of the American peo­  
ple,in which he had not sufficient confidence.  
The opposition too of the republicans to the Bri­  
tish treaty, and zealous support of the Federal­  
ists in that unpopular, but favorite - measure of  
‘ theirs, had made him all their owwn. Under­  
standing moreover that I disapproved of that  
‘ treaty, and copiously nourished with falsehoods  
by a malignant neighbor of mine, who ambi­  
tioned to be his correspondent, he had become  
aleniated from myself personally, as fi&#x27;om the  
&#x27; republican body generally of his fellow-civizens ;  
. and be wrote the letters to Mr. Adans, and Mr.  
| parroll, over which, in devotion to his 1 aper­  
ishable fame, we must for ever weep as mjonu­  
} ments of mortal decay. ‘

“ Here, certainly, [found a state of things which, of all I had ever  
contemplated, I the least expected. I had left France in the first year  
of her revolution, in the fervour of natural rights, and zeal for reforma-  
tion. My conscientious devotion to those rights could not be heightened,  
but it had been aroused and excited by daily exercise. The President  
received me cordially, and my colleagues and the circle of principal citi-  
zeus, apparently with welcome. ‘The courtesies of dinuer parties given  
me, as a stranger newly arrived among them, placed me at once in their  
familiar society. But I cannot describe the wonder and mortification  
with which the table conversations filled me. Politics were the chiet  
topic, and a preference of kingly over republican government was evi-  
dently the favourite sentiment. An apostate I could not be, nor yet a  
hypocrite ; and I found myself, for the most part, the only advocate of  
the republican side of the question, unless among the guests, there  
chanced to be some member of that party from the legislative houses.”’

** But Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but for a monarchy bot-  
tomed on corruption. In proof of this, I will relate an anecdote, for the  
truth of which [ attest the God who made me. Before the President  
set out on his southern tour, in April, 1791, he addressed a letter of the 4th  
of that month, from Mount Vernon, tothe Secretaries of State, Treasury  
and War, desiring that if any serious and important cases should arise  
during his absence, they would consult and act on them; and he request-  
ed that the Vice-President should also be consulted. ‘This was the only  
occasion on which that officer was ever requested to take part ina cabinet  
question, Some occasion for consultation arising, L invited those gen-  
tlemen, (and the Attorney General, as well as I remember) to dine with  
me, in order to confer on the subject. After the cloth was removed,  
and our question agreed on and dismissed, conversation began on other  
matters, and by some circumstances was led to the British constitution,  
on which Mr. Adams observed, ‘* Purge that constitution of its corrup-  
tion, and give to its popular branch equality of representation, and it  
would be the most perfect constitution ever devised by the wit of man.”  
Hamilton paused, and said, “* Purge it of its corruptions, and give to its  
popular branch equality of representation, and it would become an im-  
practicable goverument; as it stands at present, with all its supposed  
defects, it is the most perfect government which ever existed.” And  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
124 Jefterson’s Memoirs. [Feb.  
  
this was assuredly the exact line which separated the political creeds of  
these two gentlemen. The one was for an hereditary king, with a  
house of lords and commons corrupted to his will, and standing between  
him and the people. Hamilton was, indeed, a singular character. Of  
acute understanding, disinterested, honest and honorable in all private  
transactions ; amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private life,  
yet so bewitched and perverted by the British example, as te be under a  
thorough conviction that corruption was essential to the government of  
a nation.” —Vol. iv. p. 450.

to indicate rather the integrity of  
his judgment.  
  
“From the moment of my retiring from  
the Administration, the. federalists got  
unchecked hold of General Washington.  
His memory was already sensibly impaired  
by age: the firm tone of mind for which  
he had been remarkable, was beginning  
to relax; its energy was abated; a list-  
lessness of labour, a desire for tranquillity  
had crept on him; and a willingness to  
let others act, and even think for him.  
Like the rest of mankind, he was disgust-  
ed with atrocities of the French revolu-  
tion, and was not sufficiently aware of the  
difference between the rabble who were  
used as instruments of their perpetration,  
and the steady and rational character of  
the American people, in which he had  
not sufficient confidence. The opposi-  
tion, too, of the republicans to the Bri-  
tish treaty, and the zealous support of  
the federalists in that unpopular, but fa-  
vourite measure of theirs, had made him  
all theirown. Understanding, moreover,  
that I disapproved of that treaty, and co-  
piously nourished with falsehoods by a  
malignant neighbour of mine, who ambi-  
tioned to be his correspondent, he had  
become alienated from myself personally,  
as from the republican body generally of  
his fellow citizens.”—vol. iv. p. 463

me“?gfr Jefferson says “Hamilton’s financial  
system had two objects—-—ﬁr.st as a puzzle to  
exclude popuiar uuderstaigdmg and agency—  
secondly as a machine forcorrupting the legis­  
fature : for he avowed the opinion, that man  
could be governed by one of iwo motives on­  
iy, force, or interest: force he pbserved in  
this country was out of the c‘;estxon, and the  
interest therefore of the members must be laid  
hold of to keep the legislature in unison with  
‘the executive. And with grief and shame it  
‘must be acknowledged, that his machine was  
not without effect : thut even in this, the  
birth of our government, ssome members  
were found sorgid enough to bind their duty  
to their interest, and to look after personal,  
yather than the public gqod.&#x27; * g  
After the expedient of paper money had ex­  
hausted itself, [during the war] certificates of  
debt were given to individual creditors, with  
gssurances of payment §¢ 5001 4s the United  
  
States should be able. But the disiresses of  
those people often obliged them to part with  
these for half] the fifth and even the tenth of  
their value, and speculators had made a trade  
of cozening them f{romn the holders by the  
nost fraudulent practices, and persnasions that  
they would never be paid. In the hill for  
fun ling and paying these, Hamilton made no  
difference between the original holders and the  
frandulent parchasers of this paper, Great  
and ylst repugnance arose at putting these  
two cinszes of creditorg on the same iooting,  
and great exertions were used to pay the form­  
er the full value, and to the latter the price only  
which they had paid, with iaterest. But this  
would have prevented the game which was  
to pe played, and for which the minds ol the  
greedy me2mbers were already tutored and pre­  
pured. When the trial of strength,on these ev­  
eral efforts, had indicated the form in which the  
bill would finally pass, this being known with­  
in doors sooner than without, and especially  
than to those who were in distant parts of  
the Union, the basz scramble began. Cour­  
iers and relay horses by land, and swift sailing  
pilot boats by sea,were flving in all directioas.  
Active partners and agents were associated  
and employed in every State, town, and coun­  
try neighborbood, and this paper was bought  
up at five shillings, and even as low as two  
shillings in the pound, before the holder knew  
that Congress had already provided for its re­  
demption at par. Immense sums were thus  
filched trom the poor and ignorant, and f)r­  
tunes accumulated by thos: who had thep­  
selves heen poor enougn before. Men thus  
enriched by the dexterity of” a leader would  
follow of course the chief who was leadjng  
them to fortune, and become the zealous in­  
struments of aill his enterprizes.”

Hamilton, of course, as their leader in that  
principle: auU tins mercenary pnalaux  
added to them, insured nun always a ma  
jority in both houses; so that the whole ac  
tion of the Legislature was now under the  
direction of the Treasury. Still the ma­  
chine was not complete. The effect of the  
funding system and of the assumption  
would be temporary, it would be lost, with  
the loss of the individual members whom  
it had enriched, and some engine of influ­  
ence more permanent must be contrived,  
while these myrmidons were yet in place,  
to carry it through all opposition. This  
engine was the Bank of the United States.  
ll that history is known, so I shall say  
nothing about it. While the Government  
remained at Philadelphia, a selection of  
members of both Houses were constant­  
ly kept as directors, who, on every ques­  
tion interesting to that institution, or to  
the views of the Federal head, voted at  
the will of that head, and together with the  
stockholding members, could always make  
the Federal vote the majority. By this  
combination, legislative expositions were  
given to the Constitution, and all the ad­  
ministrative laws were shaped to the model  
of England, and so passed. And from  
this influence we were not relieved until  
the removal from the precints of the bank  
to Washington.&quot;  
Here, said Mr. B. we have sketched,  
with a pencil of light, the motives and  
causes which gave rise to that first fatal de­  
parture of our Government from the prin­  
ciples and theory of its written Constitu  
tion, and which, so far as the machinery  
of the entire paper system could influence  
its action, had been verging nearer an

&quot; Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but for  
a monarchy bottomed on corruption. .In proof  
of this, I will relate an anecdote, for the truth of  
which I attest the God who made me. Before  
the President set out on his southern tour in  
April, 1791, he addressed a letter of the fourth  
of that month, from Mount Vernon, to the Secre­  
taries of State, Treasury and War, desiring that  
if any serious and important cases should arise  
during his absence, they would consult and act  
on them. And he requested that the Vice Presi­  
dent should also be consulted. This was the  
only occasion on which that officer was ever re­  
quested to take part in a cabinet question. Some  
occasion tor consultation arising, 1 invited those  
gentlemen (tnd the Attorney-General, as well  
as I remember) to dine with me, in order to coo  
ler on the subject. After the cloth was removed,  
and our question agreed and dismissed, conver­  
sation began on other matters, and, by some cir  
cumstance, was led to the British constitution,  
on which Mr. Adams observed, &quot;Purge that con­  
stitution of its corruption, and give to its popu­  
lar branch equality of representation, and it would  
&quot;e the most perfect constitution ever devised by  
e wit of man.&quot; Hamilton paused and said,  
Purge it of its corruption, and give to its popu­  
lar branch equality of representation, and it  
would become an impracticable government: as  
  
it stands at present, with all its supposed defects,  
  
it is tne most periect government which ever exi  
J a J - ti .i .  
laicii. nuu mis was assuredly ine exact line  
which separated the political creeds of these two!  
gentlemen. The one was for two hereditary  
branches and an honest elective one: the other.  
for an hereditary Kiner. with a House of Lords  
and Commons corrupted to his will, and stand­  
ing: between him and the people. Hamilton,  
was, indeed, a singular character. Of acute un­  
derstanding, disinterested, honest, and honorable  
in all private transactions,, amiable in society.  
and duly valuing virtue in private life, yet so  
bewitched and perverted by the British example,  
as to be under thorough conviction that corrup-  
1 t .  
uon was essenun to tue government or a nation.  
Mr. Adams had originally been n republican.  
The glare of royalty and nobility, during his  
mission to England, had made him believe their  
fascination a necessary ingredient in govern­  
ment; and Shays&#x27; rebellion, not sufficiently un­  
derbtood where he then was, seemed to prove  
that the absence of want and oppression, was not  
a sufficient guarantee of order. His book on the  
Americarr Constitutions having made known his  
political bias, he was taken up by the monarchi­  
cal federalists in his absence, and, on his return  
to the United States, he was by them made to  
believe that the general disposition of our citi­  
zens was favorable to monarchy. He here wrote  
his Davila, as a supplement to the former work,  
and his election to the Presidency confirmed him  
in his errors. Innumerable addresses too, art­  
fully and industriously poured in upon him. de  
ceived him into a confidence that he was on the  
pinnacle of popularity, when the c-uloh was  
yawning at his feet, which was to swallow up  
i . .  
him and his deceivers. For when General  
Washington was withdrawn, these energumeni  
of royalism, kept in check hitherto by the dread  
of his honesty, his firmness, his patriotism, und  
the authority of his name, now mounted on the  
car of State and free from control, like Phaeton  
on that of the sun, drove headlong and wild,

??It is well known,&quot; says Mr. Jefferson, &quot;lhat during  
the war, the greatest difficulty we encountered was the  
want of money or means to pay oar soldiers who fougtil,  
  
| or our farmers, manufacturers and merchants, who fur­  
nished the necessary supplies of food ai,d clothing for  
them. After the expedient of paper money had ex­  
hausted itself, certificates of debt were given to the in­  
dividual creditors, with assurance of payment, so soon  
as I he U S should be able. 13 uL the distresses of these  
people often obliged them to part with these for the  
half, the fifth, and even a tenth of their value; and specula­  
tors had made a trade of cozening them from the hold­  
ers, by the must fraudulent practices, and persuasions  
that they would nt-vr-r be paid. In the bill for funding  
and paying th?s?-, Hamilton made no difference be­  
tween the original holders, and the fraudulent purcha­  
sers of this paper Great and just repugnance arose  
at puitingth.se two classes of creditors on the same  
f? o ing.and grpal exertions were ustd to pay the former  
the full valu&quot;. and to !ne latter, the pnee only which  
they had paid, wi&#x27;h interest Hut this would have pre­  
vented the (fame which was to be played, and for which  
the minds of greedy members were already tutored and  
prepared. When the trial of strength, ou these several  
efforts, had indicated the form in which the bill would  
finally pass, this being known within doors sooner than  
without, and especially, than to th &gt;se who were in dis­  
tant parts of the Union, the base scramble began. Cou­  
riers and relay horses by land, and swift sailing pilot  
boats by sea, were flying in all directions, active part­  
ners and agents were associated and employed in ?very  
Slate, town arid country neighborhood, and this paper  
wns bought up at five shillings, and even as low as two  
shillings in the pound, before the holder knew that Con­  
{ress had already provided for its redemption at par ?  
mmense sums were thus filched from the poor and ig  
norant, and fortunes accumulated by those who had them­  
selves been poor enough before. Men thus enriched by  
the dexterity of a leader, would follow of course the chief  
who was leading them to fortune, and become the zeal­  
ous instruments of all hie enlerprizes.  
&quot;This game was over, and another was on the carpet at  
the moment of my arrival; and to this 1 was most igno  
rantly and innocently made to hold the candle. This  
fiscal manreuvre is well known by the name of the As­  
sumption Independently of the debts of Congress, the  
States had, during the war, contracted separate and hea­  
vy debts?and Massachusetts particularly, in an absurd  
attempt, absurdly conducted, on the iirrttsh port of Pe­  
nobscot: and the more debt Hamilton could rake up, the  
more plunder for his mercenaries This money, whe­  
ther wisely or foolishly spent, was pretended to have  
b&lt;.&#x27;en spent for general purposes,and ought, therefore, to  
be paid from the general purse But it w as objected, that  
nobody knew what these debts were, what their amounts,  
or what their proofs No matter; we will guess them to  
be 20,000,000. But of these 20,000,000, we do not know  
how much should be reimbursed to one State, or how  
much to another. No matter; we will guess And so  
another scramble was set on fool among the several  
States, and sutne got much,some little, some nothing ?  
But the main object was obtained; the phalanx of l^ie  
Treasury was reinforced by additional recruits.. This  
measure produced the most bitter and angry contests  
ever known in Congress, before or since the union  
of the Slates I arrived in the midst of it. But a  
stranger to the ground, a stranger to Ihe acton on it,  
i so long absent as to have lost all familiarity with  
| the subject, and as yet unaware of its object, I look  
i no concern in it. The great and trying question, bow­  
I ever, was lost in the House of Representatives. So  
j high were the feuds excited by this subject, that on its  
j rejection business was suspended. Congress met and  
| adjourned from day today without doing any thing,the  
j parties being too much out of temper to do business to­  
j gether. The Eastern members particularly, who, with  
| Smith from South Carolina were the principal gamblers  
: in these scenes, threatened a secession and dissolution  
? Hamilton was in despair. As 1 was going to the Presi­  
i dent&#x27;s one day, i met him in the street. He walked me  
&#x27; backwards and forwards beforo the President&#x27;s door for  
j half an hour. He painted pathetically the temper in  
which the Legislature had been wrought; the disgust of  
those who were called the creditor States; the danger of  
the secession of their members and a separation of the  
States He observed, that the members of the Adininis  
tralion ought to act in concert; that though this question  
was not of my department, yet a common duty should  
make it a common concern; that the President was the  
centre on which all Administration questions ultimately  
rested, and that all of us should rally around him,  
and support, with joint efforts, measures approved by  
him; and that the question having been lost by a small  
j majority only, it was probable that an appeal from me to  
: the judgment and discretion of some of my friends,  
j might effect a change in the vole, and the machine of  
I Government, now suspended, might be again set in mo­  
lion 1 told him 1 was really a stranger to the whole  
subject; that not having yet informed myself of the sys  
tem of finance adopted, 1 knew not how far this was a  
necessary sequence ; that undoubtedly, if its rejection  
endang- red a dissolution of our Union?el this incipient  
stage, 1 should deem that the most unfortunate of all  
consequences, to avert which all partial and temporary  
evils should be yielded. I proposed to him, however, to  
dine with me on the next day, and 1 would invite ano  
ther friend or two, bring them into conference together,  
and I thought it impossible that reasonable m?-n, con­  
sulting together coolly, could fail, by souie mutual sac­  
rifices of opinion, to form a compromise which was lo  
, ?&gt;r ilis liswa. The discussion look place. 1 could  
form no part in it but an exhortatory one, because I was  
a stranger to the circumstances which should govern it.  
But it was finally agreed, that w hatever importance j  
been attached to the rejection of this proposition, the  
; preservation of Ihe Union and of concord among the  
States was more important; and that therefore it would  
be better that the vote of rejection should be rescinded,  
&#x27; toeffect which, some members should change their votes  
But it was observed that this bill w?uld be peculiarly bit­  
ter to the Southern States,and that some concomitant mea­  
sure should be adopted, to sweeten it ajittle to them  
There had been before propositions to fix the sent of  
Government, either at Philadelphia, or at Georgetown,  
on the Potomac; and il was thought that by giving it to  
Philadelphia for ten years, and to Georgetown perma­  
nently afterwards, this might, as an anodyne, calm in  
some degree the ferment which might be excited by the  
other measure alone. So two ol the Potomac members  
(White and Lee; but White with a revulsion of stomach  
almost convulsive) agreed to change their rotes, arid  
Hamilton undertook to carry the other point. In doing  
this, the it:fluence he had established over the eastern  
members, with the agency ol Robert Morris with those  
of the noddle States, effected his side of the engagement;  
and so the assumption was passed, and twenty millions ol  
stock, divided among favored States, and thrown in a&#x27; a  
pabulum to the stock jobbing herd. J his added o the  
number of votaries to the Treasury, and made i&#x27;s chief  
the master of every vote in the Legislature, which  
might give lo the Government the direction suited to  
his political views.  
know well, and so must be understood, that nothing  
like&#x27;a majority in Congress had yielded to this corrup­  
tion Far from it. But a division, not very unequal,  
had already taken place in the honest part of that  
body, between the parties styled Republican and Federa:.  
The latter, being Monarchists in principle, adhered to  
Hamilton of course, as iheir leader in that principle;  
and this mercenary phalanx added to them, insured him  
always a majority in both HouseF: so that the whole ac­  
tion of the Legislature was now under the direction of  
the Treasury Still Ihe machine was not complete  
The effect of the lunding svs&#x27;em. and of the assumption,  
| would be temporary; it would be lost with the loss of  
j the individual members whom it had enriched; and some  
eneine of influence, more permanent, must be contrived,  
I while these myrmiduns wi re yet in piece, to carry it

Alexander Hamilton, who was the friend of the  
British system, with all its corruptions, secretary  
of the treasury; general Knox was secretary of  
war, and Edmund Randolph attorney general, both  
the politica! friends of Hamilton. Jefferson had  
just returned from France, where he had been  
minister, and thus speaks of the state of things  
around the president, viz: “The president received  
me cordially, and my colleagues and the circle of  
principal citizens, apparently with welcome. The  
courtesies of dinner parties given me, as a stranger  
newly arrived among them, placed me at once in  
their familiar society. But I cannot describe the  
wonder and mortification with which the table  
conversations filled me. Politics were the chief  
topic, and a preference for kingly over republican  
government was evidently the favorite sentiment.  
An apostate I could not be, nor yet a hypocrite;  
and I found myself for the most part the only ad-  
vocate on the republican side of the question, un-  
less among the guests there chanced to be some  
member of that party from the legislative houses.”

being secured for the project, some of the members  
were enabled to make large sums of money, buy-  
ing them up indirectly before the bill passed. His  
next project was the assumption of the state debts  
contracted during the revolutionary war, and then  
much depressed, in relation to which much the  
  
same game was played. These means secured tem-  
porarily a majority in congress. But, ‘Says Mr.  
Jefierson, “some engine of influence mor rma-  
  
nent must be contrived, while these myrMidons  
were still in place to carry it throngh all opposition.”  
This engine was the Bank of the United States.—  
  
  
  
| “While the government remained at Philadelphia,  
  
a selection of members of both houses were constant-  
ly kept as directors who, on every question interest-  
ing to that institution, or the views of the federal  
head, voted at the will of that head; and together  
with the stockholding members, could always make  
the federal vote that of a majority. By this com-  
bination, legislative expositions were given to the  
constitution, and all the administrative laws were  
shaped on the mdvel of England, and so passed.”  
  
‘Here, then, was the real ground,” continues Mr.  
Jefferson, ‘‘of the opposition which was made to the  
course of the administration. Its object was to pre-  
serve the legislature pure and independent of the  
executive, to restrain the administration to repub-.  
lican forms and principles, and not permit the con-  
stitution to be construed into a monarchy, and to be  
warped in practice into all the principles and pollu-  
tions of their favorite English model. Nor was this  
an opposition to general Washington. He was true  
to the republican charge confided to him, and has  
solemnly and repeatedly protested to me, in our  
conversations, that he would lose the last drop of  
his blood in support of it; and he did this the of-  
tener and with the more earnestness, because he  
knew my suspicions of Hamilton’s designs against  
it,and wished to quiet them. For he was not aware  
of the drift or effect of Hamilton’s schemes—un-  
versed in financial projects and calculations and  
budgets, bis approbation of them was bottomed on  
his confidence in the man.”  
  
Origin of the republican and federal parties. When  
the bill to establish a national bank was present-

giving it his approval. He asked the opinion of  
the secretary of the treasury as to the precise  
time at which the ten days allowed the presi-  
dent by the constitution to consider a bill, would  
expire, and kept it until the last moment. The opi-

rhis pretiction harnow, afer a lapre of two yean,he  
history, and the mighty scheme has been brought  
orward by a desperate partizan in the manner indicated.  
Ir. Calhoun was right. The term of assumption is not  
ased in the new project, because the pen of Mr. Jefferson  
has damned it with an immortality of infamy. Let us  
look back at his description of the former assumption,  
which is now held up as a precedent for new robbery  
This game was over, (funding the soldiers&#x27; certificaies,  
and another was on the carpet at the moment of my ar-  
sival, and to this I was most ignorantly and innocenth,  
made to hold the candle. This fiscal mangeuvre is well  
tno wn by the name of the assumption.  This mese  
produced the most bitter and angry contests ever  
known in Congress, before or since the union of the States.  
The great and trying question, however,  
was lost in the House of Representatives. So high were  
the feudv e weited by this sulicet, that en tha re ectien fware  
was suspended. Congress met and adjourned from  
lay to day without doing any thing, the parties being too  
muich ouf of temper to do business together. The eastern  
members particalarly, who, with smith trom South Caree  
were the prinel, il gantfers in there seenes, threat  
a secession and dissolution. But it  
was finally agreed that whatever importance had been  
attached to the rejection of this proposition, the preserva  
of the Union, and of concord among the States, was  
more important, and that, therefore, it would be better  
that the vote of rejection should be rescinded; to effect  
which, some members should change their votes. But it  
was observed that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to  
the Southern States, and that some concomitant measure  
should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them. There  
had before been propositions to fix the seat of Government  
either at Philadelphis, or at Gcorgetown, on the Potomac;  
and it was thought that by giving it to Philadelphia for ten  
years, and to Georgetown permanently afterwards, this  
might, as an anodyne, calm in some degree the ferment  
which might be excited by the other measure alone. So  
  
twe of the Potomac members White and les, but white  
ith a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive) agreed to  
change their votes, and Hamilton undertook to carry the  
other pointy and so the assumption was paased and twen  
millions of stock divided among the favored States,  
and thrown in as a pabulum to the stock-jobbing herd.  
 Still the machine was not complete; the effect of  
the funtiny aystem and of the assumption would be temo  
; it would be lost with the loss of the individual  
memberr whem it had euriched, and some engine of ine  
more permanent must be contrived while these

“ Sowe engine of influence more permanent  
must be contrived, while these myrmidons were  
still in place to earry it through all opposition.—  
This engine was the Banlk of the United States.”  
“While the government remained at Philadel­  
phia, a selection of members of the houses was  
constantly kept as directors, who on every occa­  
sion interesting to that institution, or the views of  
the federal head, voted at the will of that head ;  
and together with the stockholding members  
could always make the federal vote that of a ma-  
Jority. DBy this combination, legislative c-xllmni­  
tions were given to the Constitution, and all the  
administrative laws were shaped on the model of  
England, and #0 passed.” ‘

sition, which was made to the course of the .-\d- i

he did this the oftener, and with the more earnest- |

he was not aware of the drift or effects of Hamil­

Mr. Jefferson states that “I (Mr. J.) proposed to  
him, (Mr. Hamilton.) however, to dine with me (Mr.  
J.) the next day, and | would invite another friend or  
two, bring them into conference together, and |  
thought it impossible that reasonable men, consulting  
together coolly, could fail, by some mutual sacrifices  
of opinion, to form a compromise.”  
  
Mr. White and Mr. Lee, of Virginia, were invit-  
ed, and at Mr. Jefferson’s table it was agreed that  
‘it would be better that the vote of rejection should  
be reconsidered; to effect which, some members  
should change their votes. But it was observed that  
this pill would be peculiarly bitter to southern states,  
and that some concomitant measures should be adopt-  
ed to sweeten it a little to them. There had before  
been het to fix the seat of government eith-  
er at Philadelphia or at Georgetown on the Potomac;  
and it was thought that by giving it to Philadelphia  
for ten years, and to Georgetown permanently alter-  
wards, this might, as an anodyne, calm in some de-  
gree the ferment which might be excited by the  
other measure alone. So two of the Potomac’ mem-  
bers (White and Lee, but White with a revulsion  
of stomach almost conclusive) agreed to change their  
votes, and Hamilton undertook to carry the other  
point. In doing this, the influence he had established  
over eastern members, with the agency of Robert  
Morris with those of the middle states, effected his  
side of the engagement; and so the assumption was  
passed, and twenty millions of stock divided among  
favored states.

of the law, and over the people.  
&quot;I returned from that mission the French  
in the first year of the new Government, and  
proceeded to New York, March &#x27;90, to en­  
ter on the office of Secretary of State. Here.  
  
certainly, I found a state of things which, of  
  
all I had ever contemplated, I the least expec­  
ted. . . Politics were the chief topic; and  
a preference of kingly, over republican Gov­  
ernment, was evidently the favorite senti­  
ment. . .. . Hamilton&#x27;s financial system had  
then passed. It had two. objects: 1. As a  
pnzzle,to exclude popular understanding and  
inquiry 2. Asa machine for the corruption  
of the legislature.&#x27;. . . . &quot;It is well known,  
during the war, the greatest difficulty we  
encountered was the want of money or means  
to pay our soldiers who fought, or our far­  
mers, manufacturers, and merchant?, who fur  
nished the necessary supplies of food and  
  
clothing for them. Alter the expedient of  
  
paper money had exhausted itself, certificates  
of debt were given to the individual creditors,  
with assurances of payment as soon as the  
  
United States should be able. But the dis  
  
tresses of the people often obliged them to  
part with these foi the half, the fifth, and e­  
ven a tenth, of their value; and speculators  
had made a trade of cozening them from the  
holders by the most fraudulent practices, and  
persuasion that they , would never pay.  
Hamilton determined to fund these certifi­  
cates; that is to say, to convert ihern into  
stock, payable by the Federal Government  
at a future day, and bearing interest In the  
bill for funding them, Hamilton made no dif­  
ference between the original holders and the  
fraudulent purchasers of this paper, ... .  
When the trial of strength, on these several  
efforts, had indicated the form in which the  
bill would finally pass, this being known  
within doors (of Congress) sooner than with­  
out, and in the distant parts of the Union,  
THE BASE SCRAMBLE BEGAN!  
Couriers and relay horses by land, and swift  
sailing pilot boats by sea, were flying in; all  
directions. Active partners, a nd agents, were  
associated and employed in every Slate,town  
and county neighborhood, and this paper was  
bought up as low as five shillings, and even  
two shillings in the pound, before tne holder  
knew that Congress had already provided  
for its redemption at par.&quot;  
&quot;This game tire funding scheme was  
over, and another on the carpet at the mo­  
ment of my arrival; and to this I was igno­  
rantly and innocently made to hold the can­  
dle.; This fiscal manoeuvre is well known  
&#x27; by the name of the Assumption.  
This measure produced the most bitter and  
angry contests ever known in Congress, be-  
  
fore&#x27;or since the onion oT the States. &#x27; I ar­  
rived in the midst of it; but a stranger to the  
ground,&#x27; and to the actors in it, and s yet  
ana ware of its object, I took&#x27; no concern in  
it. -. ;;; I :.-&#x27;

W hat does Mr. Jeflerson hay on this subject.5 &quot;The  
distresses of tiles&#x27;* people, (alluding to the individual  
[ creditors of the Federal Government,) often obliged  
them to part with these certificates of debt for the half,  
the fifth, and even the tenth of their value; and spccu  
lators had made a trade of cozening them from the  
holders by the most fraudulent practices, and persua­  
sions that they never would be paid. In the bill for  
funding and paying these, Hamilton made no difl&#x27;-rence  
between the original holders and the fraudulent pur­  
chasers of this paper. Great and just repugnance bad  
arose at putting these two c/asses of creditor?? on the  
same footing, and great exertions were made to pay the  
former their full value, and the latter the price only  
which they had paid, with interest. But this would  
have prevented the game which was to be played, and  
for which the minds of erreedy numbers were already  
tutored and prepared. When the trial of strength on

pecially in the mode of operating, the case was the  
same. He read from Jefferson: |  
“Itis well known that during the war the greatest diffi-  
culty we encountered was the want of money or means to |  
pay our soldiers who fought, or our farmers, manufacturers, ||  
and merehants, who furaished the necessary supplies of |  
fvod and clothing for them. After the expedient of paper |  
money had exhausted itsclf, certificates of debt were given |  
to the individual ereditors with assurance of payment so  
soon as the United States should be able. But the dis-  
tresses of these people often obliged them to part with these

speculators had made a trade of cozening them from the  
holders by the most fraudulent practices and persuasions  
that they would never be paid. In the bill for funding and |

would have prevented the game which was to be played, and

&quot;I know well, aud so must be understood, that  
nothing like a majority in Congress had yield­  
ed to this corruption. Far from it. But a di­  
vision not very inequal had already taken  
place in the lowest part of th.it body, between  
the parties styled Republican and Federal.?  
The latter being monarchists in principle, ad.  
hered to Hamilton, of course, as their leader in  
ibat principle, and this mercenary phalanx&quot; (tha  
is, ihe members who had been corrupted) &quot;added  
to them,&quot; (the Fe era I is:&#x27;.) &quot;insu ed him always  
a majority in both Houses j :-o that the whole ac­  
tion o! the Legislature was now under the direc­  
tion ol theTieasury&quot;?(Gen. Hamilton being the  
Secretary of the Treasury.) &#x27; Still the machine  
was not complete. The eflect ol the funding jis  
ttm, and of the assumption,&quot; (two other Federal  
  
measures,) &quot;would be temporary?it would be losi  
with the loss ol iUc individual members whom it  
had enricned; and some ensinr ol influence more  
permanent must be contrived, whilt- these royi­  
midons&quot; (the corrupted members) &quot;were yet in  
place, to carry it through ail opposition. This  
ENGINE WAS THE BaNK OP THE UNITED STATES.?  
All that history is known, so I shall say nothine  
about it. While the Government remained  
Philadelphia, a selection ol the members of both  
Houses were constantly k&#x27;pt as directors, who, on  
every question in&#x27;ertsting to that iusiituuon, it  
to the views ol the federal head, voted at the will  
tiiaat head, aud, together with the stockholding  
members, could always make the federal vt.ie  
thatofihe majority. By this combination, legis­  
lative expositions were given to the Constitution  
and all the administrative laws were shaped on  
the model ol England., and so passed-acd fiom

“ The great and trying question, (the assumption of the  
State debts,) however, was lost in the House of Represent-  
atives. So high were the feuds excited by this subject that,  
On its rejection, business was suspended. Congress met and  
adjourned from day to day without doing anything, parties  
being too much out of temper to do business together,  
The eastern members particularly, who, with Smith from  
South Carolina, were the principal gamblers in these  
scenes, threatened secession and dissolution. Hamilton was  
in despair. As I was going to the President’s one day, | met  
him in the street. He walked me backwards and forwards  
before the President’s door for half an hour. He painted  
pathetically the temper into which the Legislature had  
been wrought; the disgust of those who were called the  
creditor States; the danger of the secession of their mem-  
bers, and the separation of the States. He observed that  
the members of the Administration ought to act in concert;  
that though this question was not of my department, yet a  
common duty should make it a common concern ; that the  
President was the center on which all administrative ques-  
tions ultimately rested, and that all of us should rally round  
him and support with joint efforts measures approved by  
him; and that the question having been lost by a smail  
majority only, it w: robable that an appeal from me to  
the judgment and retion of some of my friends might  
effect a ehange in the vote, and the machine of govern-  
ment, how suspended, might be again set in motion. | told  
him that 1 was really a stranger to the whole subject; that  
not having yet informed myself of the system of finance  
adopted, I knew not how far this was a necessary sequence;  
that undoubtedly, if its rejection endangered a dissolution  
of our Union, at this incipient stage, I should deem that the  
most unfortunate of all consequences, to avert which, all  
partial and temporary evils should be yielded. IT proposed  
to him, however, to dine with me the next day, and [ would  
invite another friend or two, bring them in conference to  
gether, and I thought it impossible that reasonable men,  
consulting together coolly, could fail, by some mutual sac-  
rifices of opinion, to form a compromise which was to save  
the Union. @he discussion took place. J could take no  
part in it but an exhortatory one, because [ was a stranger  
to the circumstances which should govern it. But it was  
finally agreed to, that whatever importance had been at-  
tached to the rejection of this proposition, the preservation  
of the Union and of concord among the States was more  
important, and that therefore it would be better that the  
vote of rejection should be rescinded, to effect which, some  
members should change their votes.  
  
** But it was observed that this pill would be peculiarly  
bitter to the southern States, and that some concomitant  
measure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them.  
There had before been a proposition to fix the seat of Gev-  
ernment either at Philadelphia or at Georgetown, on the  
Potomac ; and it was thought that by giving it to Philadel-  
phia for ten years, and to Georgetown permanently after-  
wards, this might, as an anodyne, calm in some degree the  
ferment which might be excited by the other measure alone.  
So two of the Potomac members (White and Lee, but  
White with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive)  
agreed to change their votes, and Hamilton undertook to  
carry the other point. In doing this, the influence he had  
established over the eastern members, with the agency of  
Robert Morris with those of the middle States, effected his  
side of the agreement, and so the assumption was passed.”’

&quot;I proposed to him, howavee te dine with me  
the next day d I would invite another friend  
or two, bring them into conference together, and  
I thought it impossible that reasonable men con­  
sulting together coolly, could fail, by some mu­  
tual sacrifices of opinion, to form a compromise  
which was to save the Union.&quot;  
The result shows that Mr. Jefferson, for a  
novice, made a remarkably judicious selec  
tion of friends to dine in company with Mr.  
Hamilton. He proceeds:  
The discussion took place. I could take no  
part in it but an exhortatory one, because I was  
a stranger to the circtnstances which should gov­  
ern it. Rut it was finally agreed, that whatever  
importance has been attached to the rejection of  
this proposition,--the assumption of State dedts.  
the preservation of the Union and of concord  
among the States was more important, and that  
therefore it would be better that the vote of re­  
jection should be rescinded, to effect which some  
members should change their votes. But it was  
observed that this pill would be peculiarly bit-  
ter to the southern States, and that some concoms  
tant measure should be adopted to swecten et d little fo  
them. There had before been propositions to fix  
the seat of Government either at Philadelphia or  
at Georgetown, on the Po omac; and it was  
thought that by giving it to Philadelphia for ten  
years, and to Georgefown permanently after.  
wards, this might, as an anodyne, calm, in some  
degree, the ferment which might be excited by  
the other measure alone. So two of the Poto­  
mac members- White and Lee; but White with a  
revulsion of stomach almost convulsive--agreed  
to change their votes, and Hamilton undertook to  
carry the other point. In doing this, the influence  
he had established over the eastern members, with  
the agency of Robert Morris with those of the  
middle States, effected his side of the engagement;  
and so the assumption was passed, and twenty mil­  
lions of stock divided ainong favored States, and  
thrown in as a pabulum to the stock-jobbing  
herd.&quot;  
Mr. Jefferson assures us that only a few  
members of either section were parties to  
&quot;this corruption,&quot; as he styles it. He ex

olis) a difference of opinion was evident on  
the question of a republican or kindly  
government, yet, so general through the  
States was the sentiment in favor of the  
former, that the friends of the latter con  
fined themselves to a course of obstruc  
tion only, and delay, to everything propo  
sed; they hoped, that nothing being done  
and all things going from bad to worse, a  
a kingly government might be usurped,  
and submitted to by the people, as better  
than anarchy and wars internal and ex

effect of their man couvres, with the defec­

resulted in the measure of calling a more  
general convention, to be held at Phila­

I have already ststed that Hamilton set  
his engine of corruption in motion, or, in  
other words, his financial measures. Of  
those we will first see what Mr. Jefferson  
  
says: &quot;I returned from that mission (mis­  
sion to France.) in that first year of the  
new government, having landed in Vir­  
ginia in December, 1789, and proceeded  
to New York in March, 1790, to enter on  
the office of Secretary of State. Here,  
certainly, I found a state of things which,  
of all I had ever contemplated, I the least  
expected. Courtesies of dinner  
parties given me, as a stranger newly ar­  
rived among them, placed me at once in  
their familiar society. But I cannot des­  
cribe the wonder and mortification with  
which the table conversation filled me.  
Politics were the chief topics, and a pref­  
crence of kingly over a republican govern­  
ment, was evidently the favorite sontiment.  
An apostate I could not be, nor yet a  
hypocrite; and I found myself, for the  
most part, the only advocate on the repub­  
lican side of the question, unless among  
the guests there chanced to be some mem­  
ber of that party from the legislative hous­  
es. Hamilton&#x27;s financial system had them  
passed. It had two objects--Ist, as a  
puzzle to exclude popular understanding  
and inquiry; 2nd, a machine for the cor­  
ruption of the legislature- for he avowed  
the opinion that men could be governed by  
one of two motives only, force or interest;  
lorce, he observed, in this country was out  
of the question, and the interest, therefore,  
of the members must be laid hold of, to  
keep the legislature in unison with the ex  
ecutive. And with grief and shame it  
must be acknowledged that this point was  
not without its effect; that even in this the

ffreatest men we ever had in the country.  
But according to Mr. Jefferson, who knew  
him well, his greatnes consisted mostly in  
his being able to rob the treasury of the  
United States out of large sums of money  
to bestow upon his friends. &quot;It is well  
known (says Mr. Jefferson,) that during  
the war, the greatest difficulty we encoun­  
tered, was the want of money or means  
to pay our soldiers who fought, or our  
farmers, manufacturers, and merchants,  
who furnished the necessary supplies of  
food and clothing for them. After the  
expedient of paper money had exhausted  
itself, certificates of debt were given to the  
individual creditor, with assurance of pay­  
ment, so soon as the United States should  
be able. But the distresses of these peo­  
ple often obliged them to part with these  
for the half, the filth, and even a tenth of  
their value, and speculators had made a  
trade of cozening them from the holders,  
by the most fraudulent practices and per­  
suasions that they would never be paid.  
In the bill for funding and paying these,  
Hamilton made no difference between the  
original holders and the fraudulent pur­  
chasers of this paper. Great and just re­  
pugnance arose at putting these two elasses  
of creditors on the same footing, and great  
exertions were used to pay the former the  
full value, and to the latter the price only  
which they had paid, with interest. But  
this would have prevented the game which  
was to be played, and for which was to be  
played, and for which the mids of greedy  
members were already tutored and pre­  
pared. When the trial of strength on the  
several efforts had indicated the form in  
which the bill wound finally pass, this  
being known within dors sooner than with­  
out, and especially by those who were in  
distant parts of the Union, the base scram­  
ble began. Couriers and relay horses by  
land and swift sailing pilot boats by sea,  
were plying in all directions. Active part­  
ners and agents were associated and em­  
ployed in every State, town and country  
neighborhood, and this paper was brought  
up for five shillings, and even as low as  
two shillings on the pound, before the  
holder knew that Congress had already  
provided for its redemption at par.  
Men thus enriched by the dex­  
terity of a leader, would follow, of course  
the chief who was leading them to fortune  
and become the zealous instrument of all  
his enterprise,&quot;--(VoL 4. P. 446.447,

‘This fiscal maneuver is well known by  
the name of the ‘Asspmption.’ Independ-  
ently of the Congress, the States had, during .  
the war, contracted separate and heavy debts,  
and Massachusetts particularly, in an absurd  
attempt, absurdly conducted on the British  
post of Penobscott, and the more debt Ham-  
ilton could rake up, the more plunder for his  
mercenaries. This money, whether wisely or  
foolishly spent, was pretended to have been  
spent for general purposes, and ought there-  
fore be paid from the general purse. But it  
was objected that nobody knew what these  
debts were, what their amount, or what their  
proofs. No matter, we will guess them to be  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
242  
  
twenty millions. But of these twenty mil-  
lions we do not know how much should be  
reimbursed to one State, or how much to  
another. No matter, we will guess. And so  
another scramble was set on foot among the  
several States, and some got much, some lit-  
tle, some nothing. But the majn object was  
obtained, the phalanx of the Treasury was  
reinforced by additional recruits. This&#x27;mea-  
sure produced the most bitter and angry con-  
tests ever known in Congress before or since  
the Union of the States * * * The  
great and trying question, however, was lost  
in the House of Representatives. So high  
were the feuds excited by this subject, that  
on its rejection business was suspended.  
Congress met and adjourned from day to day  
without doing anything, the parties being  
too much out of temper to do business toge-  
ther. The Eastern members particularly,  
who with Smith, from South Carolina, were  
the principal gamblers in these scenes, threat-  
ened a secession and dissolution. Hamilton  
was in despair. As I was going to the Presi-  
dent’s one day I met him in the street. He  
walked me backward and forward before  
the President’s door for half an hour. He  
painted pathetically the temper into which  
the Legislature had been wrought; the dis-  
gust of those who were called the creditor  
States ; the danger of the secession of their  
members, and the separation of the States.  
*  *  * IT told him that I was really a  
stranger to the whole subject * * *  
I proposed to him, however, to dine with me  
the next day, and I would invite another  
friend or two, bring them into conference to-  
gether, and I thought it impossible that rea-  
sonable men, consulting together coolly,  
could fail, by some mutual sacrifices of opi-  
nion, to form a compromise which was to  
save the Union. The discussion took place.  
I could took no part in it but an exhortatory  
one, because I was a stranger to the circum-  
stances which should govern it. But it was  
finally agreed, that whatever importance had  
been attached to the rejection of this propo-  
sition, the preservation of the Union and of  
concord among the States were more impor-  
tant, and that, therefore, it would be better  
that the vote of rejection should be rescind-  
ed, to effect which, some members should  
change their votes. But it was observed that  
this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the  
  
HISTORY OF NORTHERN DISUNION.

Southern States and that some concomitant  
measure should be adopted to sweeten ita  
little to them. There had before been pro-  
positions to fix the seat of govornment either  
at Philadelphia, or Georgetown on the Poto-  
mac ; and it was thought that by giving it to  
Philadelphia for ten years, and to George-  
town permantly afterwards, this might, as  
anodyne, calm in some degree the ferment  
which might be excited by the other mea-  
sure alone. So two of the Potomac mem-  
bers (White and Lee, but White with a re-  
version of stomach almost convulsive) agreed  
to change their votes, and Hamilton under-  
took to carry the other point. In doing this,  
the influence he had established over the  
Eastern members, with the agency of Robert  
Morris with those of the Middle States, ef-  
fected his side of the engagement; and so  
the Assumption was passed, and twenty mil-

He was a most singular character. Of acute

duly valueing virtue in private life; yet, so

&quot;The contests of that early day, were

the advocates of Republican and those of   
Kingly government,--and had oat the for,   
Iner mule the efforts they did, octrgovern­

6 I CIT6S!&#x27;il I i,sue of those efforts have made   
  
&quot;The alliance between the States an­  
d, r the old articles of confederation, for   
the purpose of joint defence against the   
aLrgreskions of Great Britain, was found   
insufficient, as treaties of alliance yeaeral­

mutual stipUlattoni, and these once ful- i   
filed, that tiond was to expire-of- itself; /   
and .each State was to becomcsove,reign   
and independent in all things. &#x27;Yet• it   
could not bat occur, to every one, That   
these separate independencies, like the­  
petty States of Greece, would be eternal­  
ly‘at war with each other, and would be­  
come at length the mere partisans-and   
sattelites of&#x27; the&#x27; leading powers of Eu•   
rope. Alt then must have looked forward   
to some further bond of Union; which   
would insur.l internal peace, and a   
political system of our own, independent   
of that of Europe..   
&quot; Whether all should be consolidated   
into a single government, or each remain   
independent• as to internal matters, and   
the whole form a single&#x27;natiou as to what   
was foreign only, and whether that na­  
tional government should be a monarchy   
-or a republic, would, of course., ,divide   
opinions., -Some officers of the army, as it   
has always -been:said.and believed, (and

stieh is • the government the Itepublieans   
are now: determined to establish, is too   
evident for contradiction.   
&quot;13nt-the Mass of -that Convention was   
too honest, ton Arise,and too attady, to be   
baffled and misled hrthe_,matienvres :of   
the monatehilts&#x27;.: 1- &#x27;A forM of government.   
was then proposed, by Aloli.Hamiltone   
which would have been in fact a compro­  
mise between the two parties of royalism   
and repnbli-eanigrn. Accoraiiig to ibis,   
the executive and one branch of the legis­  
lature were to be during good behaviour,   
that is, for life; and the governors of the   
States were to be named by these two   
permanent organs. &#x27;This, however, was   
rejected; on which Hamilton left the Con­  
vention, as desperate, and never returned   
again until near its final extinction. These   
efforts for monarchy caused great jeal­  
ousy through the Stites generally, a jeal­  
ousy which yielded at last to a determin­  
ation to estitblishhcertain amendments   
to the. Constitution asliairiers against a

solidited: what, passed. through the   
whole period of these Conventions, I have   
gone on the information:of those who were   
members of them, being absent myself on   
my mission to France.   
  
&quot; I returned from that mission in the   
first year of tf new-government, having   
landed in Virginia in Dec. 1789, and pro­  
ceed to New York in 1790, to enter on   
the office of Secretary of State. Here,&#x27;   
certainly, I found a state of things which,   
of all I ever contemplated, I the least ex-1   
pected. The courtesies of dinner parties   
given me, as a stranger arrived among   
them, placed me at once in their familiar   
society. But I cannot describe the won­  
der and mortification with which the ta­  
ble conversations filled me. Policies were   
The chief topic, and a preference of a   
kingly over a republican government was   
evidently the favorite sentiment. I found   
myself, for the-&#x27;Most&#x27; part, the only &#x27;advo­  
cate on the&#x27; republicau side of the ques­  
tion, unlesa among the guests there   
chanced to be some member of that party   
from the legislative Houses. .Hamilton&#x27;s   
financial sySitem had then passed, and an­  
other was on the carpet at the moment of   
-my arrival. This fiscal measure was well   
known by the name ottle Assumption,   
and to this I was most innocently made   
to bold the candle. Another engine of   
power was the bank of the U. S.   
  
&quot; By this combination, legislative expo­  
shone   
salons were given to the Constitntion,and   
all the administrative laws were shaped   
in the model of England, and so passed.   
Here then was the real ground of the op­  
position which ,was made to the course of   
administration. The object of the oppo- I   
sition was t¢ restrain ther-qmitristration   
to reppi!licailforoiri and p,rinciples, and   
mot permit the,.Conititution,to be Con­  
strued into a Monarcby,and to be warped   
in   
.practice; into all the principles and pol­  
lutions of their: favorite English model,—  
..Nor was this an opposition to_ Gen. Wash,   
ington,- for wets aware- of_ the drift, or   
of the effect of Hamilton&#x27;s schemes:- Un­  
versed in financial projects and calcula­  
tion,his apprObation of them was bot­  
tomed on his nerifilencein the man. But   
Hamilton was)lot only a monarchist, but   
for a monarch, bottomed on corruption.   
John Adams said, at dinner with me,   
&#x27;&#x27;Purge the British Constitution of its   
:corruption, and give to its popular branch   
equality of representation, and it would   
become an impracticable government; as   
it stands at present, with all its supposed   
defects, it is the most perfect government   
that ever existed.. /And this was assured­  
ly the exact line which separated the po­

**This game was over, and another was on  
  
the carpet at the moment of my arrival [from  
France to become Secretary of State]; and to  
this I was most ignorantly and innocently made  
to hold the candle. This fiscal measure was  
known by the name of the Assumption. Inde-  
pendently of the debts of Congress the States  
had, during the war, contracted separate and  
heavy debts. This money, whether wisely or  
foolishly spent, was pretended to have been spent  
for general purposes, and ought therefore to be  
paid from the general purse. This measure pro-  
duced the most bitter and angry contest ever  
known in Congress before or since the Union of  
the States. I arrived in the midst of it. But, a  
stranger to the ground, a stranger to the actors  
  
in it—so long absent as to have lost all familiar- |  
  
ity with the subject, and as yet unaware of its  
object—I took no concern in it.  
trying question, however, was lost in the House  
of Representatives. So high were the feuds ex-  
cited by this subject that on its rejection business  
was suspended. Congress met and adjourned from  
day to day without doing any thing, the parties  
being too much out of temper to do business to-  
  
gether. The Eastern members particularly, who,  
  
with Smith of South Carolina, were the principal  
gamblers in these scenes, threatened a secession  
and dissolution. Hamilton was in despair. As  
I was going to the President one day I met him  
in the street. He walked me backward and for-  
ward before the President’s door for half an hour.  
He painted pathetically the temper into which  
the Legislature had been wrought, the disgust  
of those who were called the creditor States, the  
danger of the secession of their members, and  
the separation of the States. He observed that  
the members of the Administration ought to act  
in concert; that, though the question was not  
  
of my department, yet a common duty should |  
make it a common concern; that the President |  
  
was the centre on which all administrative ques-  
tions ultimately rested, and that all of us should  
rally around him, and support with joint efforts  
measures approved by him; and that the ques-  
tion having been lost by a small majority only, it  
was probable that an appeal from me to the  
judgment and discretion of some of my friends  
might effect a change in the vote, and the ma-  
chine of government, now suspended, might be  
again set in motion. I told him that I was really  
4a stranger to the whole subject ; that, not having  
yet informed myself of the system of finances  
adopted, I knew not how far this was a necessary  
sequence ; that, undoubtedly, if its rejection en-  
dangered a dissolution of our Union at this in-  
cipient stage, I should deem that the most un-  
fortunate of all consequences, to avert which all  
partial and temporary evils should be yielded.  
[ proposed to him, however, to dine with me the  
next day, and I would invite another friend or  
two, bring them into conference together, and I  
thought it impossible that reasonable men, con-

The great and |  
  
suiting together coolly, could fail by some my  
tual sacrifices of opinion to form a compromise  
which was to save the Union. The discusgiyy,  
took place. I could take no part in it but ay  
exhortatory one, because I was a stranger to the  
circumstances which should govern it. But it  
was finally agreed that, whatever importance had  
been attached to the rejection of this proposition,  
the preservation of the Union and of concord  
among the States was more important, and that  
therefore it would be better that the vote of ye.  
jection should be rescinded, to effect which some  
members should change their votes. But it was  
observed that this measure would be particularly  
bitter to the Southern States, and that some con.  
comitant measure should be adopted to sweeten  
it a littletothem. There had before been prop-  
ositions to fix the seat of Government either at  
Philadelphia or at Georgetown on the Potomac:  
and it was thought that by giving it to Philadel.  
phia for ten years, and to Georgetown perma  
nently afterward, this might, as an anodyne  
‘calm in some degree the ferment which might  
be excited by the other measure alone. So tw:  
of the Potomac members (White and Lee, but  
White with a revulsion of stomach almost con-  
vulsive) agreed to change their votes, and Ham-  
ilton undertook to carry the other point. In do  
ing this, the influence he had established over  
| the Eastern members, with the agency of Robert  
| Morris with those of the Middle States, etfected  
his side of the engagement.” So ‘‘ twenty mill-  
ions of stock were divided among favored States,”  
| and the Capital went to the Potomac.  
  
The above is from Jefferson’s diary. Later,  
in a letter to Washington, he adds: “I was

gave a few anecdotes to prove this, which the  
defenders and the descendants of Hamilton  
have been for eighty years trying to disprove.  
Here is the first of Jefferson’s charges against  
Hamilton:  
“ Hamilton’s financial system bad two objects;  
first, as a puzzle, to exclude popular understanding  
and inquiry; second, as a machine for the corruption  
of the Legislature, for he avowed the oolnlon that  
men could be governed by one of two motives  
only—force or interest. Force, he observed, in  
this country, was oat of the question, and the tn­  
teretti therefore, of members must be laid hold of  
to keep the legiOatvoo to unina with the executive.  
“ Hamilton was, indeed/ says Jefferson, further,  
“ a singular character. Of acute understanding,  
disinterested, honest, and honorable In all private  
transactions, amiable In society, and duly valuing  
virtue in&#x27;private fife, yet so bewitched and per­  
verted by the British example as to be under thor­  
ough conviction • that ■ corruption was essential to  
the eovadaneus of anation.

her Revolution, in the fervor of natural  
rights and zeal for reformation. My  
conscientious devotion to those rights  
could not be heightened, but it had  
been aroused and excited by daily ex-  
ercise. The President received me  
cordially, and my colleagues and the  
circle of principal citizens apparently  
with welcome. The courtesies of din-

newly arrived among them, placed me  
at once in their familiar society. But  
I cannot describe the wonder and mor-  
tification with which the table conver-

chief topic, and a preference of kingly  
over republican government was evi-  
dently the favorite sentiment. An  
apostate I could not be, nor yet a hypo-  
crite; and I found myself, for the most

Jefferson has preserved of the discussion between Mr. Adams

ington, proves what was the feeling among those who were  
most influential in inaugurating the new system. “ Purge the  
English constitution,” said Mr. Adams, ‘of its corruption, and

“ His memory,” wrote Mr. Jefferson in 1818, “was already sensibly

able was beginning to relax, its energy was abated, a listlessness of  
labor, a desire for tranquility, had crept upon him, and a willingness to

of the American people, in which he had not sufficient confidence.”  
  
Happily for his own peace, and not less happily, perhaps, for the  
country, he was released from his uncongenial position before the later  
complications of the revolutionary period. The term of seven years

by this subject that on its rejection b lslness

from day to day, without do&#x27;nz anything,  
the parties being too much out ot*em-?er

walked me ba&#x27; kwarl and forward bpfore the  
Presldtnt s door for half an hour. hh palatei  
pathetically the temper into which the legislature  
had been wrought; the distrust or those  
who were called the creditor states; the d lusrer  
of the secession of their members, and the  
separation of the states. He observed  
that the members of the administration  
ought to act in concerr; that though  
this question was no* of my department (St it *)  
yet a common duty should make it a coiainoa  
concern: that the President was the center on  
which all administrative questions ultimately  
rested, and that all of us should rail/ around  
him. and support wlrh joint efforts measures  
approved by him: and that, the question having  
been lost by only a small majority, it was  
probable that an appeal from me to the Judgment  
and discretion of some of my friends  
might effect a charge in the vote, and the  
machine of government, now suspended, might  
be again set m motiorj. I told him that I was  
really a stranger t? the whole subject and not  
yet having informed myself of the system or  
finatce adopted. I knew not how far this was a  
n? eessarv sequence; that undoubt dlv, ir its  
rejection endangered a dissolution&#x27; or our  
I nlon at this incipient sta^e. I shou&#x27;d  
deem that the most unfortunate of all  
consequences, to avert which all partial  
and temporary evils should be yielded  
&quot;I proposed to him, however, to dine with me  
the next day, and I would invite another frtend  
or two. bring them into conference togetner  
and I thought it Impossible that reasonable  
men, consulting together coolly, could rail by  
some tnvtual nf opinio &gt;n&#x27; to form a  
compromise was (o sort- the Union The  
discussion took place. I could take no part in  
it but an exhoitatory one, because 1 was a  
stranger to the circumstances which should  
govern It. But it was finally agreed to that  
whatever Importance had been attached to the  
rejection of this proposition the preservation of  
tbe I nlon and of concord among the states was  
more important, and that therefore it would be  
better that the vote of rejection should be rescinded,  
to efleet which some members should  
change their votes. Hut It was observed  
that this pill would ba peculiarly bitter  
to the southern states, and that some  
(rmnnnitmit measure shouhl be adopts to  
sfcerten ir a life to them. There had been a  
proposition to fix the seat of government either  
at Philadelphia or at Georgetown on the Potomac,  
and it was thought taat by giving it to  
Philadelphia for ten vears and to G^r^etown

which might be excited by the other measure  
I alone. So two of the Potomac members ( White

almost col \ uisl ve) agreed to change their votes,  
and Hamilton undertook to carry the other  
point. In doing this, the influence he had  
established over the eastern members, with tue  
agency of Robert Morris with those of the  
Middle states, effected hLs side of the agreement,

that though this question was not of my department, yet a common duty  
should make it a common concern; that the president was the center on  
which all administrative questions ultimately rested, and that all of us  
should rally around him and support, with joint efforts, measures. approved  
by him; and that the question having been lost by a small majority only,  
it was probable that an appeal from me to the judgment and discretion of  
some of my friends might effect a change in the vote, and the machine of  
government, now suspended, might be again set in motion. I told him  
that I was really a stranger to the whole subject; that not having yet in-  
formed myself of the system of finance adopted, I knew not how far this  
was a necessary sequence ; that, undoubtedly, if its rejection endangered a  
dissolution of our Union at this incipient state, I should deem that the  
most unfortunate of all consequences, to avert which, all partial and tem-  
porary evils should be yielded. I proposed to him, however, to dine with  
me the next day, and I would invite another friend or two, bring them  
into conference together, and I thought it impossible that reasonable men,  
consulting together coolly, could fail, by some mutual sacrifices of opinion,  
to form a compromise which was to save the Union. The discussion took  
place. I could take no part in it but an exhortatory one, because I was a  
stranger to the circumstances which should govern it. But it was finally  
agreed to, that whatever importance had been-attached to the rejection of  
this proposition, the preservation of the Union and of concord among the  
states was more important, and that, therefore, it would be better that the  
vote of rejection should be rescinded, to effect which some members  
should change their votes. -But it was observed that this pill would be  
peculiarly bitter to the southern states, and that some concomitant meas-  
ures should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them. There had before  
been a proposition to fix the seat of government either at Philadelphia, or  
at Georgetown, on the Potomac; and it was thought that by giving it to  
Philadelphia for ten years, and to Georgetown permanently afterwards,  
this might, as an anodyne, calm, in some degree, the’ ferment which might  
be excited by the other measure alone. So two of the Potomac members  
(White and Lee, but White with a revulsion of stomach almost convul-  
sive) agreed to change their votes, and Hamilton undertook to carry the  
other point. In doing this, the influence he had established over the east-  
ern members, with the agency of Robert Morris, and those of the middle  
states, effected his side of the agreement, and thus the assumption was  
passed.”

lessness for labor, a desire for tranquillity, had

mankind, he was disgusted with the atrocities  
of the French revolution, and was not suffi­

rabble who were used as instruments of their  
perpetration, and the steady and rational  
character of the American people, in which he

icies of the government, at 31. There  
were giants in those days. But to Mr.  
Jefferson&#x27;s narative. In hi 3 notes, enti­  
tled his Anas, written long after he had  
retired from public life, he say s:  
“It is well known that duriDg the war  
the greatest difficulty we encountered  
was the want of money, or means to pay  
our soldiers who fought, or our farmers,  
manufacturers and merchants, who fur­  
nished the necessary supplies of food and  
clothing for them after the expedient of  
paper money had exhausted itself, certi  
ficates of debt were given to the individ­  
ual creditors, with assurance of payment  
so soon as the United States should be  
able. But the distresses of these people  
often obliged them to part with these  
certificates for half, the fifth, and even a  
tenth of their value; and speculators had  
made a trade of cozening them from the  
holders by the most fraudulent pract&#x27;ces  
and persuasions that they would never be  
paid. In the bill for fund­  
ing and paying these, Hamilton  
made no difference between the  
original holders and the fraudulent  
purchasers of this paper. Great and  
just repugnance arose at putting these  
two classes of creditors on the same foot  
ing; and great exertions were us d to  
pay the former the full value, and the  
latter the price only which they had paid,  
with interest. But this would have pre­  
vented the game which was to be played,  
and for which the minds of greedy mem  
bers were already prepared. When the  
trial of strength on these several efforts  
had indicated the form in which the bill  
would finally pass, this being known  
within doors sooner than without, and  
especially to those who were in distant  
parts of the Union, the base scramble  
began. Couriers and relay horses by  
land, and swift sailing pilot boats by sea  
were flying in all directions. Active  
patrous and agents were associated and  
employed in every State, town and coun  
try neighborhood, and this paper was  
bought up at five shillings, and even  
as low as two shillings in the  
pound, before the holder knew that  
Congress had already provided for its  
redemption at par. Immense sums wre  
thus filched from the poor and ignorant,  
and fortunes accumulated by those who  
had themselves been poor enough be­  
fore. Men thus enriched by the dexteri­  
ty of a leader, would follow of course  
the chief who was leadiug them to for

“This game was over, and another  
was on the carpet at the moment of my  
arrival, and to this I was ignorantly and  
innocent!v made to hold the candle  
This fiscal manoeuvre is well known by  
the name of assumption. Independently  
of the debts of Congress, the States had  
during the war contracted separate and  
heavy debs,and Massachusetts particular  
ly in an absurd attempt, absurdly con­  
ducted,on the British port of Penobscott:  
and the more debt Hamilton could  
rake up the more plunder for his mer  
cenaries. Tais money, whether wisely  
or foolishly spent, was pretended to  
have been spent for general  
purposes, and ought therefore  
to be paid from the general purse.  
But it was objected, that nobody knew  
&gt;what these debts were, what their  
  
1 a nouut, or what their proofs. No mat-  
I ter, we will guess them to be twenty mil­  
-1 ons. But of these twenty millions, we  
• do not know how much should tie reim­  
bursed to one State, or bow much to an  
other. No matter, we will guess And  
so another scramble was set on foot  
among the several States, and some got  
i much, some little, and some nothing  
f But the main object was obtained; the  
phalanx of the treasury was re inforced  
; by additional recruits. This measure  
, produced the most angry aud bitter con  
test ever known in Congress, before or  
since the Union of the States. I arrived  
in the midst of it [from France.] But a  
stranger to the ground, a stranger to the  
actors on it, so long absent as to have  
lost all familiarity with the subject, anil  
yet unaware of its object, I took no con  
cern in it. The great and trying ques­  
tion, however, was lost in the  
House of Representatives. So high were  
the feuds excited by this subject, that  
on its rejection business was suspended.  
Congress met and adj turned from day  
to day without doing anything, the par­  
ties being too much out of temper to do  
business together. The Eastern mem­  
bers particularly, who, with Smith from  
South Carolina, were the principal gamb­  
lers in these scenes, threatened a seces­  
sion and dissolution. Hamilton was in  
despair. As I was going to the Presi­

retary of State], 1 met him in the street.  
He walked me backwards and forward,  
before the President’s door for half an  
hour. He painted pathetically the tern  
per into which the Legislature had been  
wrought; the disgust of those who were  
called the creditor States; the danger of  
the secession of their members, and the  
separation of the States. He observed  
that the members of the Administration  
ought to act in concert; that though this  
question was not of my department, yet  
a common duty should make it a com­  
mon concern; that the President was  
the centre on which all administrative  
questions ultimately rested, and that all  
of us should rally around him, and sup  
port with joint efforts, measures ap  
proved by him, and that the question  
having been lost by a small majority­  
only, it was probable that an appeal from  
me to the judgment and discretion of  
some of my friends might effect a change  
in the vote, and the machine of govern­  
ment, now suspended, might be again set  
into motion. I told him that I was really  
a stranger to the whole subject; that  
not having yet informed myself of the  
system of finance adopted; 1 knew not  
how far this was a necessary’sequence;  
that undoubtedly, if its rejection end an  
gered a dissolution of the uniou at this  
incipient stage, I should deem that the  
most unfortunate of all consequences, to  
avert which all partial and temporary  
  
evils should be yielded. I proposed to  
him, however, to dine with me the  
next day, and I would invite anoth  
er friend or two, bring them  
into conference together, and 1 thought  
it impossible that reasonable men, eon  
suiting together cwlly, could fail, by  
some mutual sacrifices of opinion, to  
form a compromise which was to save  
the Union. The discussion took place.  
I could take no part in it but an  
exhortatory one, because I was a stranger  
to the circumstances which should gov  
ern ir. But it was finally agreed that  
whatever importance had been attached  
to the rejection of this proposition, the  
preservation of the Union and of con  
cord among the States was more impor  
tant, and that therefore it would be bet­  
ter that the vote of rejection should be  
rescinded, to effect wnich, some mem  
bers should change their votes. But it  
was observed that this pill would be pe  
culiarly bitter to the Southern States,  
aud that some concomitant measure  
should be adopted to sweeten it a little  
to them. There had before been propo­  
sitions to fix the seat of government  
either at Philadelphia or at Georgetown,  
on the Potomac, and it was thought  
that by giving it to Philadel­  
phia for ten years, and to Georgetown  
permanently afterwards, this might, as  
an anodyne, calm, in some degree, the  
foment which might be excited by the  
other measure alone. So two of the Po­  
tomac members (Whi&#x27;e and Lee, but  
White with a revulsion of stomach al­  
most convulsive) agreed to change their  
votes, and Hamilton undertook to carry  
the other point. In doing this the in  
fiuence he had established over the  
Eastern members, with the agency of  
Robert Morris with th «e of the Middle  
States, effected bis side of the engage  
ment; and so the assumption was passed  
and twenty millions of stock divided  
among favored States, and thrown as a  
pabulum to the stock jobbing herd. This  
added to the number of votaries to the  
Treasury, and made its chief the master  
of every vote in the Legislature, which  
ought give to the government the dir.c  
tion suited to his political views.

‘* Hamilton was in despair, He painted pathetically the temper into  
which the legislature had been wrought, the disgust of those called the  
‘Creditor States,’ the danger of the secession of its members and the  
separation of the States. He said that the members of the administra-  
tion ought to act in concert; that the President was the center on which  
all administrative questions finally rested: that all of us should rally  
around him, and support by joint effort measures approved by him;  
that an appeal from me to the judgment and discretion of my friends  
might effect a change in the vote, and the machinery of government  
now suspended might be set in motion. I told him that I was really a  
stranger to the whole subject not having yet informed myself of the  
system adopted. That if rejection endangered dissolution of the Union  
at this incipient stage [should deem it the most unfortunate of all con-  
sequences ; to avert which all partial and temporary evils should be  
yielded. I proposedto him to dine with me the next day, and I would  
invite another friend or two, and bring them into conference together;  
and I thought it impossible that reasonable men, consulting together  
coolly, could fail, by some mutual sacrifices of opinion to form a com-  
promise that would save the Union. The discussion took place. It was  
finally agreed that whatever importance had been. attached to the re-  
jection of this proposition the preservation of the Union and concord  
among the States was important and that therefor it would be better that  
the vote of rejection should be rescinded, to effect which some members  
should change their votes.’’  
  
‘* But it was observed that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the  
Southern States, and that some concomitant measures should be adopted  
to sweeten ita little tothem. There had been a proposition to fix the  
seat of Government either at Philadelphia or Georgetown, on the Poto-  
mac ; and it was thought by giving it to Philadelphia for ten years and to  
Georgetown permanently afterwards, this might as an anodyne calm in  
some degree the ferment which might be excited by the other measure  
alone. So two of the Potomac members, White and Lee, agreed to  
change their votes and Hamilton undertook to carry the other point.  
In doing this the influence he had established over the Eastern members  
and the agency of Robert Morris with those of the Middle States, ef-  
fected his side of the engagement; and so the assumption bill was  
passed. Twenty millions of stock divided among favored States, and  
thrown in as pabulum, tothe stock jobbing herd, and the permanent Cap-  
ital fixed on the Potomac.

“So high were the feuds excited on this  
subject, that on its rejection business was  
suspended. Congress met and adjourned  
from day to day, without doing anything;  
the parties being too much out of temper  
to do business together. The eastern mem-  
bers threatened secession and dissolution.  
Hamilton was in despair. As I was going  
to the President’s one day, I met him in  
the street. He walked me back and forth  
before the President’s door for half an  
hour. He pointed pathetically to the tem-

wrought—the disgust of those who were  
called ‘the creditor states’-—the danger of  
the secession of their members, and of the  
separation of the states.

that the President was the centre on which

peal from me to the judgment and discre-  
tion of some of my friends might effect a  
change in the vote, and the machine of gov-  
ernment now suspended, might be again  
set in motion.”  
  
JEFFERSON AS A POLITICAL WORKER.  
  
Jefferson felt keenly the dangers of that  
disaffection, which was but too commonly  
expressed by representatives from both  
sections, and decided in regard to the ‘As-  
sumption bill,’ ‘that if its rejection endan-

gered the dissolution of the union at this  
incipient stage, I should deem that the  
most unfortunate of all occurrences; to  
avert which all partial and temporary evils  
should be y‘elded.  
  
“T accordingly gave a dinner party the  
next day, at which a discussion took place,  
and it was finally agreed that whatever im-  
portance had been attached to the rejection  
of this proposition the preservation of the  
union, and of concord among the states,  
was of more importance; and that there-  
fore the vote of rejection, should be re-  
scinded—to effect which some members  
should change their votes.  
  
“But it was observed that the pill would  
be peculiarly bitter to the Southern states,  
and that some concomitant measure should  
be adopted to sweeten it a little to them.  
There had before been propositions to fix  
the seat of government either at Philadel-  
phia or at Georgetown on the Potomac,  
and it was thought that by giving it to  
Philadelphia for ten years, and to George-  
town permanently afterwards, this might  
as an anodyne, calm in some degree the  
ferment excited by the other measure afone.  
So two of the Potomac members (White  
and Lee) but the former with a revulsion  
of stomach almost convulsive, agreed to  
change their votes; (on the assumption  
bill) and Hamilton undertook to carry  
through the other measure.”

to Hamilton to dine with me and  
would lnvite another friend or two and  
bring them Into conference together  
and I thought it impossible that sensi­  
ble men counseling together coolly could  
fall, by some mutual sacrifices of opin  
ion to name a compromise, which  
would save the Union. It was finally  
agreed that whatever impOrtajMS j. had  
been attached to the measure, the &quot;pres  
ervation of tne union and &quot;the concord  
among the States was more important  
and that therefore It would be better  
that the vote of, rejection be rescinded,  
to effect which some members should  
change their votes. , -vvr&#x27;,;,  
But it Was observed that this Ibill  
would be ? particularly bitter Jitot the  
Southern States, and that some con  
comitant measure should be(aflopted to  
sweeten u a nttie to tnem. There nad  
been propositions before to fcx the seat  
of government at Philadelphia or  
.Georgetown, on the Potomac and it yto  
thought by giving ft to Philadelphia for  
ten years and to Georgetown perma­  
nently afterwards, this might act as ah  
anodyne and calm In some measure the  
ferment which might be excited by the  
other measure alone. . So two of the Po  
tomac members offered to change their  
votes and Hamilton undertook to carry  
the other point.&quot; . t- ,  
By this sagacious strategy the funding  
bill and the bill locating the seat of  
government, the two measures that se­

young republic were satisfactorily set

to the final action upon the adoption of the  
Potomac site for the National Capital  
Jefferson and Hamilton met on tho streets  
and arm in arm walked back and forth be­  
fore the Presidents house for lialf an hour  
Jefferson says that Hamilton was in de­  
spair He painted pathetically tho temper  
into which the Legislature had been  
wrought the disgust of those called the  
Creditor States the danger of the seces­  
sion of its members and tho separation of  
the States He said the members of the  
Administration ought to act in concert  
that tho President was the center on which  
all Administration questions finally rested  
that all of us should rally around him and  
support by joint effort measures approved  
by him  
Jefferson replied that if its rejection en­  
dangered dissolution of the Union at this  
incipient stage he should deem it the most  
unfortunate of all consequences to avert  
which all partial and temporary evils  
should be yielded Ho proposed to Mr  
Hamilton that he dine with him the next  
day and that he would invite a friend or  
two and bring them into conference He  
hoped some compromise could be made that  
would save tho Union  
Tho conference took place They all  
felt that tho preservation of the Union and  
concord among the States was of tho most  
importance Thoy decided that tho vote of  
rejection must be rescinded to effect winch  
some men must change their votes To  
make this an agreeable pill all around  
somo concomitant measures should be  
adopted There had been a proposition to  
fix the seat of Government either at Phila­  
delphia or Georgetown on thoPotomac and  
it was thought by giving it to Philadelphia  
for 10 years and to Georgetown perma­  
nently afterwards this might in somedegree  
calm tho ferment which might bo excited  
  
by the other measure alone  
It might have been desirable as somo  
agreed to chooso a place best suited to tho  
interests of tho wholo country regardless  
of tho personal wishes or convenience of  
individual members of Congress and it  
might have beendesirable as some thought  
to choose a point which would not give un­  
equal disadvantages to the most distant  
States and which should have tho most  
direct and easy communication with th
