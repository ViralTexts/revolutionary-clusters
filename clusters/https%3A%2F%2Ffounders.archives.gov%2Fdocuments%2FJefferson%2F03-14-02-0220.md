e that the question of the declaration was passed unanimously; but by mr Galloways examination before a committee of the British parliament on American affairs, an account of which was published in London in 1779. it appears: “That the debates lasted nearly a fortnight and when the question was put six colonies divided against six; the delegates for Pennsylvania being also divided, the question remained undecided. However, one of the members of that colony who had warmly opposed it being wrought upon by Mr Adams’ art, changed his opinion, and upon the question the next day it was carried in the affirmative by a single vote only.” This is a very different account from that given in the printed journals, which we know to be incorrect particularly as it respects the time when it is stated to have been passed and the signatures attached to it.—  
Nor will it appear strange when the facts are known that there should be a difference of opinion, whether or not “Committees of correspondence” originated in Virginia or Massachusetts? Having observed one side of this question was publicly supported by the authority of your name, I hope you will pardon me, if I state the real fact as it appears by the official records of the times.
