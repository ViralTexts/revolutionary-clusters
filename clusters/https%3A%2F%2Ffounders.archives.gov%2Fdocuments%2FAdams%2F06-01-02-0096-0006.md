The law, and the opinion of the judge are not always convertible terms, tho’ it is a general rule that the decisions of courts of justice are the evidence of what is common law. S

Car. 203. Justice Archer was removed by Charles II. from sit-  
ting in the Court of Common Pleas. But the judge, having his  
patent to be judge quam diu se bene gesserit, refused to surrender  
his patent without a scire factas, and continued justice of the court,  
though prohibited to sit there, and in his place Sir William Ellis  
was sworn.” Sir Thos. Raym. Rep. 217. Rushworth says —  
“Mr. Serjeant Archer, (now living) notwithstanding his removal,  
still enjoys his patent, being quam diu bene gesserit, and receives a  
share in the profits of that court, as to fines and other proceedings,  
by virtue of his said patent ; and his name is used in all those fines,  
&amp;e., as a judge of that court.” Thus, learned judges, against  
whom nothing could be alleged, and who could not, therefore, be  
deprived of their offices, were deprived of their salaries, because  
these were dependent on the will or caprice of the king. But, as  
we have said, generally, before the Revolution of 1688, the judges  
held their offices during the pleasure of the king, and were wholly  
dependent on him for their salaries. This, of course, made them  
completely dependent on the king, which occasioned evils and  
grievances, which pressed heavily on the people, a
