ably in theseveral foreign lands. Not less potent was  
the moderation of the people in the expression  
of the heartfelt joy that they could not but feel,  
in its influence upon the peoples and governments  
of the world.  
  
The Declaration was officially proclaimed on  
the 5th of July, and, with the ntmost celerity then  
possible, it was published to all parts of the coun-  
try. In a General Order of the goth of July,  
General Washington said: ‘‘ The General hopes  
this important event will serve as an incentive to  
every officer and soldier to act with fidelity  
and courage, as knowing that now the peace  
and safety of his country depend—under God—  
solely on the success of our arms; and that  
he is now in the service of a State possessed of  
sufficient power to reward his merit, and advance  
him to the highest honours of a free Country.”  
At six o’clock the same evening, each brigade was  
assembled, and the Declaration was read. General  
Washington says, in his letter to the Congress,  
after stating what he had done in the premises,  
‘¢ The expressions and behaviour of the officers and  
men testify their warmest approbation.”
