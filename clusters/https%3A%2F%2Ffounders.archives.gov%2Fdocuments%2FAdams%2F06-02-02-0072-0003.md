e heretofore intimated my intention, of pursuing the Tories, through all their dark intrigues, and wicked machinations; and to shew the rise, and progress of their schemes for enslaving this country. The honour of inventing and contriving these measures, is not their due. They have been but servile copyers of the designs of Andross, Randolph, Dudley, and other champions of their cause towards the close of the last century. These latter worthies accomplished but little: and their plans had been buried with them, for a long course of years, untill in the administration of the late Governor Shirley they were revived, by the persons who are now principally concern’d in carrying them into execution. Shirley, was a crafty, busy, ambitious, intrigueing, enterprizing man; and having mounted, no matter by what means, to the chair of this province, he saw, in a young growing country, vast prospects of ambition opening before his eyes, and he conceived great designs of aggrandizing himself, his family and his friends. Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Oliver, the two famous Letter writers, were his principal ministers of state—Russell, Paxton, Ruggles, and a few others, were subordinate instruments. Among other schemes of this junto, one was to raise a Revenue in America by authority of parliament.  
In order to effect their purpose it was necessary to concert measures with the other colonies. Dr. Franklin, who was known to be an active, and very able man, and to have great influence, in the province of Pennsylvania, was in Boston in the year 1754, and Mr. Shirley communicated to him the profound secret, the great design of taxing the colonies by act of parliament. This sagacious gentleman, this eminent philosopher, and distinguished patriot, to his lasting honour, sent the governor an answer in writing with the following remarks upon his scheme. Remarks which would have discouraged any honest man from the pursuit. The remarks are these.  
“That the people always bear the burden best, when they have, or think they have, some share in the direction.  
“That when public measures are generally distasteful to the people, the wheels of government must move more heavily.  
“That excluding the people of America from all share in the choice of a grand council for their own defence, and taxing them in parliament, where they have no representative, would probably give extreme dissatisfaction.  
“That there was no reason to doubt the willingness of the colonists to contribute for their own defence.  
“That the people themselves, whose all was at stake, could better judge of the force necessary for their defence, and of the means for raising money for the purpose, than a British parliament at so great distance.  
“That natives of America, would be as likely to consult wisely and faithfully for the safety of their native country, as the Governors sent from Britain, whose object is generally to make fortunes, and then return home, and who might therefore be expected to carry on the war against France, rather in a way, by which themselves were likely to be gainers, than for the greatest advantage of the cause.  
“That compelling the colonies to pay money for their own defence, without their consent, would shew a suspicion of their loyalty, or of their regard for their country, or of their common sense, and would be treating them as conquered enemies, and not as free Britons, who hold it for their undoubted right not to be taxed but by their own consent, given through their representatives.  
“That parliamentary taxes, once laid on, are often continued, after the necessity for laying them on, ceases; but that if the colonists were trusted to tax themselves, they would remove the burden from the people, as soon as it should become unnecessary for them to bear it any longer.  
“That if parliament is to tax the colonies, their assemblies of representatives may be dismissed as useless.  
  
“That taxing the colonies in parliament for their own defence against the French, is not more just, than it would be, to oblige the cinque ports, and other coasts of Britain, to maintain a force against France, and to tax them for this purpose, without allowing them representatives in parliament.  
“That the colonists have always been indirectly taxed by the mother country (besides paying the taxes necessarily laid on by their own assemblies) inasmuch as they are obliged to purchase the manufactures of Britain, charged with innumerable heavy taxes; some of which manufactures they could make, and others could purchase cheaper at other markets.  
“That the colonists are besides taxed by the mother country, by being obliged to carry great part of their produce to Britain, and accept a lower price, than they might have at other markets. The difference is a tax paid to Britain.  
“That the whole wealth of the colonists centers at last in the mother country, which enables her to pay her taxes.  
“That the colonies have, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes, extended the dominions, and increased the commerce and riches of the mother country, that therefore the colonists do not deserve to be deprived of the native right of Britons, the right of being taxed only by representatives chosen by themselves.  
“That an adequate representation in parliament would probably be acceptable to the colonists and would best unite the views and interests of the whole empire.”  
The last of these propositions seems not to have been well considered, because an adequate representation in parliament, is totally impracticable: but the others have exhausted the subject. If any one should ask what authority or evidence I have of this anecdote, I refer him to the second volume of political disquisitions, page 276, 7, 8, 9. A book which ought to be in the hands of every American who has learned to read.  
Whether the ministry at home or the junto here, were discouraged by these masterly remarks, or by any other cause, the project of taxing the colonies was laid aside, Mr. Shirley was removed from this government, and Mr. Pownal was placed in his stead.  
Mr. Pownal seems to have been a friend to liberty and to our constitution, and to have had an aversion to all plots against either, and consequently to have given his confidence to other persons than Hutchinson and Oliver, who, stung with envy, against Mr. Pratt and others, who had the lead in affairs, set themselves, by propagating slanders against the governor, among the people, and especially among the clergy, to raise discontents, and make him uneasy in his seat. Pownal averse to wrangling, and fond of the delights of England, solicited to be recalled, and after some time Mr. Bernard was removed from New Jersey to the chair of this province.  
Bernard was the man for the purpose of the junto—educated in the highest principles of monarchy, naturally daring and courageous, skilled enough in law and policy to do mischief, and avaricious to a most infamous degree: needy at the same time, and having a numerous family to provide for—he was an instrument, suitable in every respect, excepting one, for this junto to employ. The exception I mean, was blunt Frankness, very opposite to that cautious cunning, that deep dissimulation, to which they had by long practice disciplined themselves. However, they did not dispair of teaching him this necessary artful quality by degrees, and the event shew’d they were not wholly unsuccessful, in their endeavours to do it.  
While the war lasted, these simple provinces were of too much importance in the conduct of it, to be disgusted, by any open attempt against their liberties. The junto therefore, contented themselves with preparing their ground by extending their connections and correspondencies in England, and by conciliating the friendship of the crown officers occasionally here, and insinuating their designs as necessary to be undertaken in some future favourable opportunity, for the good of the empire, as well as of the colonies.  
The designs of providence are inscrutable. It affords to bad men, conjunctures favourable for their designs, as well as to good. The conclusion of the peace, was the most critical opportunity, for our junto, that could have presented. A peace founded on the destruction of that system of policy, the most glorious for the nation, that ever was formed, and which was never equalled in the conduct of the English government, except in the interregnum, and perhaps in the reign of Elizabeth; which system however, by its being abruptly broken off, and its chief conductor discarded before it was compleated, proved unfortunate to the nation by leaving it sinking in a bottomless gulph of debt, oppressed and borne down with taxes.  
At this lucky time, when the British financier, was driven out of his wits for ways and means, to supply the demands upon him, Bernard is employed by the junto, to suggest to him the project of taxing the Colonies by act of parliament.  
I don’t advance this without evidence. I appeal to a publication made by Sir Francis Bernard himself, the last year, of his own select letters on the trade and government of America, and the principles of law and polity applied to the American colonies. I shall make much use of this pamphlet before I have done.  
In the year 1764, Mr. Bernard transmitted home to different noblemen and gentlemen four copies of his principles of law and polity, with a preface, which proves incontestibly, that the project of new regulating the American colonies were not first suggested to him by the ministry, but by him to them. The words of this preface are these. “The present expectation, that a new regulation of the American governments will soon take place, probably arises more from the opinion the public has of the abilities of the present ministry, than from any thing that has transpired from the cabinet: It cannot be supposed that their penetration can overlook the necessity of such a regulation, nor their public spirit fail to carry it into execution. But it may be a question, whether the present is a proper time for this work; more urgent business may stand before it; some preparatory steps may be required to precede it; but these will only serve to postpone. As we may expect that this reformation, like all others, will be opposed by powerful prejudices, it may not be amiss to reason with them at leisure, and endeavour to take off their force before they become opposed to government.”  
These are the words of that arch enemy of North-America, written in 1764, and then transmitted to four persons, with a desire that they might be communicated to others.  
Upon these words, it is impossible not to observe. First, That the ministry had never signified to him, any intention of new regulating the colonies; and therefore, that it was he who most officiously and impertinently put them upon the pursuit of this will with a whisp, which has led him and them into so much mire. 2. The artful flattery with which he insinuates these projects into the minds of the ministry, as matters of absolute necessity, which their great penetration could not fail to discover, nor their great regard to the public, omit. 3. The importunity with which he urges a speedy accomplishment of his pretended reformation of the governments, and 4. His consciousness that these schemes would be opposed, although’ he affects to expect from powerful prejudices only, that opposition, which all Americans say, has been dictated by sound reason, true policy, and eternal justice. The last thing I shall take notice of is, the artful, yet most false and wicked insinuation, that such new regulations were then generally expected. This is so absolutely false, that excepting Bernard himself, and his junto, scarcely any body on this side the water had any suspicion of it—insomuch that if Bernard had made public, at that time, his preface and principles, as he sent them to the ministry, it is much to be doubted whether he could have lived in this country—certain it is, he would have had no friends in this province out of the junto.  
The intention of the junto, was, to procure a revenue to be raised in America by act of parliament. Nothing was further from their designs and wishes, than the drawing or sending this revenue into the exchequer in England to be spent there in discharging the national debt, and lessening the burdens of the poor people there. They were more selfish. They chose to have the fingering of the money themselves. Their design was, that the money should be applied, first in a large salary to the governor. This would gratify Bernard’s avarice, and then it would render him and all other governors, not only independent of the people, but still more absolutely a slave to the will of the minister. They intended likewise a salary for the lieutenant governor. This would appease in some degree the knawings of Hutchinson’s avidity, in which he was not a whit behind Bernard himself. In the next place, they intended a salary to the judges of common law, as well as admiralty. And thus the whole government, executive and judicial, was to be rendered wholly independent of the people, (and their representatives rendered useless, insignificant and even burthensome) and absolutely dependent upon, and under the direction of the will of the minister of state. They intended further to new model the whole continent of North America, make an entire new division of it, into distinct, though more extensive and less numerous colonies, to sweep away all the charters upon the continent, with the destroying besom of an act of parliament, and reduce all the governments to the plan of the royal governments, with a nobility in each colony, not hereditary indeed, at first, but for life. They did indeed flatter the ministry and people in England, with distant hopes of a revenue from America, at some future period, to be appropriated to national uses there. But this was not to happen in their minds for some time. The governments must be new-moddelled, new regulated, reformed first, and then the governments here would be able and willing to carry into execution any acts of parliament or measures of the ministry, for fleecing the people here, to pay debts, or support pensioners, on the American establishment, or bribe electors, or members of parliament, or any other purpose that a virtuous ministry could desire.  
But as ill-luck would have it, the British financier, was as selfish as themselves, and instead of raising money for them, chose to raise it for himself. He put the cart before the horse. He chose to get the revenue into the exchequer, because he had hungry cormorants enough about him in England whose cooings were more troublesome to his ears, than the croaking of the ravens in America. And he thought if America could afford any revenue at all, and he could get it by authority of parliament, he might have it himself, to give to his friends, as well as raise it for the junto here, to spend themselves, or give to theirs. This unfortunate preposterous improvement of Mr. Grenville, upon the plan of the junto, had well nigh ruined the whole.  
I will proceed no further without producing my evidence. Indeed to a man who was acquainted with this junto, and had any opportunity to watch their motions, observe their language, and remark their countenances, for these last twelve years, no other evidence is necessary; it was plain to such persons, what this junto was about. But we have evidence enough now under their own hands of the whole of what was said of them by their opposers, through this whole period.  
Governor Bernard, in his letter July 11, 1764, says, “that a general reformation of the American governments would become not only a desirable but a necessary measure.” What his idea was, of a general reformation of the American governments, is to be learnt from his principles of law and polity, which he sent to the ministry in 1764. I shall select a few of them in his own words; but I wish the whole of them could be printed in the news-papers, that America might know more generally the principles and designs and exertions of our junto.  
His 29th proposition is, “The rule that a British subject shall not be bound by laws, or liable to taxes, but what he has consented to, by his representatives, must be confined to the Inhabitants of Great-Britain only; and is not strictly true even there. 30. The parliament of Great-Britain, as well from its rights of sovereignty, as from occasional exigences, has a right to make laws for, and impose taxes upon its subjects in its external dominions, although they are not represented in such parliament. But 31. Taxes imposed upon the external dominions, ought to be applied to the use of the people, from whom they are raised. 32. The parliament of Great-Britain has a right and duty to take care to provide for the defence of the American colonies; especially as such colonies are unable to defend themselves. 33. The parliament of Great-Britain has a right and a duty to take care that provision be made for a sufficient support of the American governments. Because 34. The support of the government is one of the principal conditions upon which a colony is allowed the power of legislation. Also because 35. Some of the American colonies have shewn themselves deficient in the support of their several governments, both as to sufficiency and independency.”  
His 75th proposition is, “Every American government is capable of having its constitution altered for the better. 76. The grants of the powers of governments to American colonies by charters, cannot be understood to be intended for other than their infant or growing states. 77. They cannot be intended for their mature state, that is, for perpetuity; because they are in many things unconstitutional and contrary to the very nature of a British government. Therefore 78. They must be considered as designed only as temporary means, for settling and bringing forward the peopling the colonies: which being effected, the cause of the peculiarity of their constitution ceases. 79. If the charters can be pleaded against the authority of parliament, they amount to an alienation of the dominions of Great Britain, and are, in effect acts of dismembering the British empire, and will operate as such, if care is not taken to prevent it. 83. The notion which has heretofore prevailed, that the dividing America into many governments and different modes of government, will be the means to prevent their uniting to revolt, is ill founded; since, if the governments were ever so much consolidated, it will be necessary to have so many distinct states, as to make a union to revolt, impracticable. Whereas 84. The splitting America into many small governments, weakens the governing power, and strengthens that of the people; and thereby makes revolting more probable and more practicable. 85. To prevent revolts in future times (for there is no room to fear them in the present) the most effectual means would be, to make the governments large and respectable, and ballance the powers of them. 86. There is no government in America at present, whose powers are properly ballanced; there not being in any of them, a real and distinct third legislative power mediating between the king and the people, which is the peculiar excellence of the British constitution. 87. The want of such a third legislative power, adds weight to the popular, and lightens the royal scale; so as to destroy the balance between the royal and popular powers. 88. Altho’ America is not now (and probably will not be for many years to come) ripe enough for an hereditary nobility; yet it is now capable of a nobility for life. 89. A nobility appointed by the king for life, and made independent, would probably give strength and stability to the American governments, as effectually as an hereditary nobility does to that of Great­Britain. 90. The reformation of the American governments should not be controuled by the present boundaries of the colonies; as they were mostly settled upon partial, occasional, and accidental considerations, without any regard to a whole. 91. To settle the American governments to the greatest possible advantage, it will be necessary to reduce the number of them; in some places to unite and consolidate; in others to seperate and transfer; and in general to divide by natural boundaries, instead of imaginary lines. 92. If there should be but one form of government established for all the North-American provinces, it would greatly facilitate the reformation of them; since, if the mode of government was every where the same, people would be more indifferent under what division they were ranged. 93. No objections ought to arise to the alteration of the boundaries of provinces from proprietors, on account of their property only; since there is no occasion that it should in the least affect the boundaries of properties. 94. The present distinction of one government being more free or more popular than another, tend to embarass and to weaken the whole; and should not be allowed to subsist among people, subject to one king and one law, and all equally fit for one form of government. 95. The American colonies, in general, are, at this time, arrived at that state, which qualifies them to receive the most perfect form of government, which their situation and relation to Great-Britain, make them capable of. 96. The people of North-America, at this time, expect a revisal and reformation of the American governments, and are better disposed to submit to it, than ever they were, or perhaps ever will be again. 97. This is therefore the proper, and critical time to reform the American governments upon a general, constitutional, firm, and durable plan; and if it is not done now, it will probably every day grow more difficult, till at last it becomes impracticable.”  
My friends, these are the words, the plans, principles, and endeavours of Governor Bernard in the year 1764. That Hutchinson and Oliver, notwithstanding all their disguises which you well remember, were in unison with him in the whole of his measures, can be doubted by no man. It appeared sufficiently in the part they all along acted, notwithstanding their professions. And it appears incontestibly from their detected letters, of which more hereafter.  
Now let me ask you—if the parliament of Great-Britain, had all the natural foundations of authority, wisdom, goodness, justice, power, in as great perfection as they ever existed in any body of men since Adam’s fall: and if the English nation was the most virtuous, pure and free, that ever was; would not such an unlimited subjection of three millions of people to that parliament, at three thousand miles distance be real slavery? There are but two sorts of men in the world, freemen and slaves. The very definition of a freeman, is one who is bound by no law to which he has not consented. Americans would have no way of giving or withholding their consent to the acts of this parliament, therefore they would not be freemen. But, when luxury, effeminacy and venality are arrived at such a shocking pitch in England, when both electors and elected, are become one mass of corruption, when the nation is oppressed to death with debts and taxes, owing to their own extravagance, and want of wisdom, what would be your condition under such an absolute subjection to parliament? You would not only be slaves—But the most abject sort of slaves to the worst sort of masters!

3. The notion which has heretofore” preniled,  
that the dividing America into many governments,  
and different modes of government, will be the means  
to prevent their uniting to revolt, is ill- founded;  
fince, if the Governments were ever ſo much conſo-  
lidated, it will be neceſſary to have ſo many diſtinct  
States, as to make an union to revolt ne.

84. The ſplitting ATP into many ſmall govern-  
ments, weakens the governing power, and ſtrengthens  
that of the people; and and makes be purrons more  
probable and more ptacticable. 8

86. There is no Government in America at preſent,  
whoſe powers are properly balanced; there not being  
  
  
power mediating between the Ring and the People,  
which is the 2 exiallente of the Britiſh Conſti-  
  
  
87, The want of fach 2 third Ln power, adds  
weight to the popular, and lightens the royal ſcale;  
ſo as to deſtroy the balance between the royal and Pana.  
lar powers.  
  
9. Although Americe is not now (and probably will  
not be for many years to come) ripe enough for an he-  
reditary Nobility ; yet it is now pane of a Nobility for  
life.  
  
89. A Nevility appointed by the King for life, and  
  
  
ſtability to the American governments, as effettually  
as an hereditary Nobility does to that of Great Bri-  
tain.  
  
90. The reformation of the American governments  
ſhould not be controlled by the preſent boundaries of  
  
  
occaſional, and accidental On; without any  
  
  
91. To ſettle the American governments to the  
greateſt poſſible advantage, it will be neceſſary to re-  
duce the number of them; in ſome places to unite and  
  
won in others to ſeparate and transfer; and in

92. If there ſhould be bun one Fes of Government  
eſtabliſhed for all the North American Provinces, it  
would greatly facilitate the reformation of them: ſince,  
if the mode of Government was every where the ſame,  
people would be more n under what m—__  
they were ranged. lunge 204 0! |  
  
93. No objections _ to ariſe to the akteraion: of  
the boundaries of provinces from Proprietors, on ac-  
count of their property only; ſince there is no occaſion  
  
that it fhould i in the leaſt affect 1 boundaries of * |

94. The Os diftindions of one 6 being  
more free or more popular than another, tend to em-  
barraſs and to weaken the whole; and ſhould not be al-  
lowed to ſubſiſt among people, ſubject to one King and  
  
one Law, and all an fit for one form of Govern-  
ment.  
  
96. The American colonies, in general, are at this  
3 arrived at that ſtate, which qualifies them to re-  
ceive the moſt perfect form of government, which their  
tuation and relation to Great Britain make them _  
ble of. | |  
  
96. The people of North America, at this time,  
expect a reviſal and reformation of the American Gor  
vernments, and are beiter diſpoſed to ſubmit to it than  
eyer N were, or perhaps ever will be again.

97. This is therefore the proper and critical time  
to reform the American governments upon à ge-  
neral, conſtitutional, firm, and durable plan; and if  
it is not done now, it will probably every day  
grow more difficult, till at laſt it becomes imprac

83. The notion which has heretofore prevailed,  
that the dividing America into many governments,

ſince, if the Governments were ever ſo much conſo—

Whereas, |  
  
84. The ſplitting America into many ſmall goyern-

that of the people ; and thereby makes revolting more  
probable and more practicable.

no room to fear them in the preſent) the moſt effectual  
means would be, to make the governments large and

86. There is no Government in America at preſent,  
whoſe powers are properly balanced; there not being  
in any of them a real and diſtin&amp;t third Legiſlative  
power mediating between the King and the People,  
which is the peculiar excellence of the Briti/h Conſtitu-  
tion.  
  
87. The want of ſuch a third Legiſlative power, adds  
weight to the popular, and lightens the royal ſcale :  
ſo as to deſtroy the balance between the royal and  
popular powers.  
  
88, Although America is not now (and probably will  
not be for many years to come) ripe enough for an he-  
reditary Nobility; yet it is now capable of a Nobility for  
life.  
  
89. A Nobility appointed by the King for life, and  
made independent, would probably give ſtrength and  
ſtability to the American governments, as eſfectually  
as an hereditary OY does to that of Great Bri-  
tain,  
  
90. The reformation of the American governments  
ſhould not be controlled by the preſent boundaries of  
the colonies; as they were moſtly ſettled upon partial,  
occaſional, and accidental conſiderations, without wy  
regard to a whole.  
  
91. To ſettle the American governments to the  
greateſt poſſible advantage, it will be neceſſary to re-

would greatly facilitate the reformation of them: ſince,  
if the mode of Government was every where the ſame,  
people would be more indifferent under what diviſion  
they were ranged.  
  
93. No objections ought to ariſe to the alteration of  
the boundaries of provinces from Proprietors, on ac  
count of their property only ; fince there is no occaſion  
that it ſhould in the leaſt affect the boundaries of pro-

83. The notion which has - heretofore prevailed,  
that the dividing America into many governments,  
and different modes of government, will be the means  
to prevent their uniting to revolt, is ill-founded;  
fince, if the Governments were ever, ſo much conſo—  
lidated, it will be neceſſary to have ſo many diſtind  
States, as to make an union to revolt *  
Whereas,  
  
84. The Sling America into many ſmall govern  
ments, weakens the governing power, and ſtrengthens  
  
  
probable and more practicable.  
  
85. To prevent revolts in future times (for there is  
no room to fear them in the preſent) the moſt effectual  
means would be, to make the governments, large and  
  
* and N the Powers of them.

386. There is no Government in America at preſent,  
  
  
in any of them a real and diſtinct third Legiſlative  
power mediating between the Ning and the People,  
which 1s the peculiar excellence of the Britiſh Couſti-  
tution. :  
  
87. The want of ſuch a third Legiſlative power, adds  
weight to the popular, and lightens the royal ſcale:  
ſo as to deſtroy the ane between the royal and f  
lar powers.  
  
88. Although A is not now 7 (and probably will  
not be for many years to come) ripe enough for an he-  
reditary Nobility ; yet it is now capable of a Novility for  
  
89. A Nobility appointed by the King for life, and

91. To ſettle the American governments to the

time arrived at that ſtate, which qualifies them to re-  
ceive the moſt perfect form of government, which their  
  
ſituation and relation to Great Britain make them capa-  
ble of.

ditary nobility ; yet it is now capable of a nobility for life.  
A nobility appointed by the king for life, and made independ-  
ent, would probably give ftrength and ftability to the Ame-  
rican governments; as effetually as an hereditary nobility does  
to that of Great britain. The reformation of the American  
governments fhould not be controlled by the prefent boundaries  
of the colonies, as they were moftly fettled upon partial, oc-  
cafional, and accidental confiderations, without any regard to  
awhole. ‘To fettle the American governments to the greateft  
poffible advantage, it will be neceflary to reduce the- number  
of them, in fome places to unite and confolidate ; in others to  
feparate and transfer; and in general to divide by natural  
boundaries inftead of imaginary lines.’  
  
Whether or not the creating a nobility in America would  
be ferviceable to the peace of the community, admits of  
much doubt: we are of pinion that it would operate very  
little.

I HA&amp;!%‘ hgremc intimated my Intenition;  
~of pursuing the Tories through all their  
dark Intrigues, and wicked Machinations ;-=  
and to shew the Rife and Progress of their  
Schemes for enslaving this Country. &#x27;The  
Honour of inventing 2nd contriving these  
Meafares, is not their Due. They have been  
but servile Copyess of theDefigns ot Androfs,  
Randolph, Dudley, and other Champions.ef  
their Caule towards the close of-the lallCen­  
tury. These latter Worthies accomplished  
but little : and ‘their Plans had been buried  
with them, for along Course of Years, until  
in the Adminifiration of the late Gov. Shir­  
ley, they were revived, by thePerfons who are  
now principally concern’d in carrying them  
into Execution, Shirley, was a crafty, busy,  
ambitious, intriguing, enterprizing Man ;—  
&amp; having mounted, noMatter by what Means  
to the Chair of thds Province, he saw, in 2  
younggrowingCountry, vaftProfpeéts,ot Am-=  
bition opening before his Eyes, and he con­  
ceived greatDefigns 6f aggrandizing bimielf,  
his Family &amp; his Friends. Mr. Hutchinson  
and Mr. Oliver, the two famous Letter-Wri­  
ters; were his principal Miniftérs of S ate—=  
Russell, Paxton, Ruggles, and 2 few others;  
were fubordinatelnfiruments. Among other  
Schenres of this Junto, one was to raile a Re­  
venue inAmerica by Authority of Parliament.  
In order to effect their Purpose it was ne­  
ceflary to concert Measures with the other  
Colontes, DPr. Franklin, who was known to  
be an zitive, and very able Man, &amp; to have  
great influence, in the Province of Pennifyl­  
vania, was in Boston in the Year £754, and  
Mr. Shirley communicated to him the Pro­  
fourid Secret, the great Design ot ‘Taxing the  
Colonies by Act of Parliament. This saga­  
cious Gentleman, this emvinent Philosopher,  
and diftinguithed Patriot, to his lasting Ho­  
nour, sent the Governor an Answer in Writ­  
ing with the following remarks upon his  
Scheme. Remarks which would have dis­  
couraged any honest Man from the Pursuit,  
The Remarks are these. ‘  
¢ That the People always bear theßurden  
best, when they hzve, or think they have,  
some flare in the DPireétion.”  
““ That when publicMeafures are general-  
Iy diftafteful to the People, the Wheels ot Go­  
vernment must move more heavily.”  
““ That excluding the People of America  
from all Share in the choice ot a 2 grand Coun­  
cil for their own Defence, and Taxing them  
in Parliament, where they have noßeprefen­  
tative, would probably give extreme Diffati{-  
faétion.” :  
¢ That there was no Reason to doubt the  
Willingness of the Colonifls to conttibute tor  
their own Defence.” ,  
‘¢ That the People themselves whose alt  
was at Stake, could better judge of the Force  
necessary for theirDefence, and of the Means  
for raifinglMoney for the Purpose, than a Bri­  
tith Parliament at so great a Distance.”  
‘¢ That Natives of America, would be as  
likely to consult wifely and faithfully for the .  
Safety of their native Country, as the Gover­  
nors sent frcm Britzin, whose Obje&amp;t is gene­  
rally to make Fortunes, &amp; then return Home,  
and who might therefore be expected tocarry  
on the War against France, rather in 2 Way  
by which themselves were likely to be Gain­  
ers, than for the greatest Advantages of the  
Cause. ‘ ‘  
“ That compelling the Colonies to pay  
Money for their own Defence, without their  
Consent, would thew a Suspicion of their  
Loyalty, or of theirßegard for theCountry, or  
of their commonSenfe, and would be treating  
them-as conquered Enemies, and not as free  
Britons, who hold it for their undoubtedßight  
not to be taxed but by their ownCenfent, gi­  
ven through their Representatives. e  
oy Tt %’arliamentary Taxes, once laid on,  
are often continued, after the Neceflity for  
laying them on, ceases ; but that if the Co­  
fonifts were trufied to tax themselves, they  
would remove the Burden from the People,  
as soon as it should bécome unncceffary for  
them to bear it any longer.”

My Frienbps,  
“ THA&#x27;I‘ if Parliament is to tax the Colo­  
nies, their Afiemblies of Representa­  
tives may be dismissed as ufelefs*” :  
¢ Thattaxing the Colonies in Parliament  
for their own Defence against the French, is  
not more just; than it would be to oblige the  
cinque Ports, and other Coafls of Britain, to  
maintain a Force against France, and to taz  
them for thisPurpote, without allowing therit  
Representatives in Parliament.”  
© That the Colonifis have always been in­  
direétly taxed by theMother Country (besides  
paying the Taxes neceflarily laid on by their  
own Affemblies)inafmuch as they are obliged  
to purchafetheManufaétures of Britain charg­  
ed with innumerable heavy Taxes ; some of  
which Manufa@lures they could make, and  
ithers could purchase cheaper at other Mar­  
ets;&quot;”  
““ THat the Colonists are besides taxed by  
the Mother Country, by being obliged to car­  
ry great Part of their Produce to Britain, and  
accept 2 lower Price, than they might have  
at other Markets; ‘fhe Differenceds 2 Tax  
paid to Eritain.” : i  
¢ That the whole Weazlth of theColoniits  
centers at last in the [Viother-Country, which  
enables her to pay her Taxes. :  
¢ That the Colonies have, at the Hazard  
of their Lives and Fortunes, extended thelJo­  
minions, and increased the Commerce 2nd  
Riches of theMother Country, that therefore  
theColonifls do not deserve to be deprived of  
the native Right of Britong, the right of be­  
ing taxed only by Keprefentatives chosen by.  
themselves.  
¢¢ That an 4dequate Representation inPar­  
liament would probably be acceptable to the  
Colonists, and would best unite themselves  
and Interests of the whole Empire.  
The last of these Propositions {eéms not to  
have been well considered, because an ade­  
quateßeprefentation in Parliament, is totally  
impraéticable : but the others have exhaust­  
ed the Subje&amp;t.—lf any one should ask what  
Authority orEvidence ¥ have of this Anecdote,  
I refer him to tlhie second Volume of political  
Disquisitions, Page 276, 7,8, 9. A Book  
which ought to be in the Hands of every  
American who has learned to read.  
Whether theMiniftry at Home or the Jun­  
to here, were difcouragad by these masterly  
Remarks, or by any other Cause, the Projeét  
of taxing the Colonies was laid aside, Mr.  
Shirley was removed from this Government,  
and Mr. Pownal was placed in his stead. —  
Mr. Pownal feéms to have been a I&#x27;riend  
to Liberty &amp; to ourConflituticn, and to have  
had anAverfion to all Plots against either,and  
consequently to have given his Confidence to  
other Persons than Hutchinson and Oliver,  
who stung with Envy against Mr. Pratt and  
others, who had thelead inAffairs, {et them­  
felyes, by propagating Slanders againft’ the  
Governor among the People,and efpecizally  
among the Clergy, to raise Discontents, and  
makéhim uneasy in his Seat. Pownal averife  
to wrangling, and fond of the Deliglits of  
England, solicited te be recalled, and after  
some time Mr, Bernard was removed from  
New- Jersey to the Chair of this Province.—  
‘Bernard ‘was the Man for the Purpose of  
the Junto-—educated in the highest Princi­  
ples of Monarchy, naturally daring &amp; cou­  
rageous, skilled engugh in Law and Policy to  
do Mifchief, and avaricious to a mioft infa­  
mous Dégree :&#x27; needy at the fame time, and  
having 2 mumerous Family to provide for,—  
he was an Instrument, suitable in every Re­  
fpe, excepting one, for this junto to em­  
ploy.. The Exception I mean, was blunt  
Frankness, very opposite to that cautious Cu­  
nning, that deep Diffininlation, to which they  
had by long Pracice disciplined themselves.  
Howevezr, they did not difpair of teaching  
s him this necessary artful Quality by Degrees,  
*and the Event fhew’d they were not wholly  
unfuccefsful, in their Endeavours to do it.  
While the War lafled, these simple Provin­  
ces were of too much Importance in theCon­  
du&amp;t of it, to be disgusted, by any open At­  
tempt against their Liberties. The Junto  
  
therefore, contenhted themselves with prepa­  
ring their Ground by extending their Conne­  
ctions and Correfpondenciesin England, &amp; by  
conciliafing the %riendfhip of the Crown Of­  
ficers occasionally here, and insinuating theist  
Designs as nec&#x27;eﬂ&#x27;zry fobe undertaken in fomé  
future favourable Opportunity, for the Good  
of the Empire, as well as of the Colonies.

£ NOVANGLUS to be eontina’d,  
To the Inhabitants of the Colony of  
: &quot;MAassAcHUSETTS-Bay, -~  
THE Designs of Providence are infctutd­  
ble.==lt affords to bad Men conjunc­  
tures favourable for their Designs, as well as  
to good-—~The conclusion of the Peace, was  
the most critical Opportunity, for our Junto,  
that could have prefented:—A Peace founded  
on the Destruction of that System of Policy;  
the most glorious for theNation; that ever was  
formed, and which was nevér equalled in the  
conduét ot the English government, except in  
the interregnum, and perhaps in the reign of  
Elizabeth ; which {yftem however; by its be­  
ing abruptly broken off, and its thief con­  
ductor discarded before it was compleated;  
proved unfortunate to the nation by leaving  
it finking in a bottomless gulph of debt; op­  
prefled and borne down with taxes.  
At thislucky time, when the British finan­  
cier, was driven out.af his wits for ways and  
means, to {upply the demands upon him,  
Bernard is employed by the junto, to suggest  
to him the proje¢t of tazing the Colonies by  
act of parliament. / ;  
I don’t advance this without evidence: I  
appeal to a publication made by Sir Francis  
Bernard himfelf, the last year; of his own  
feleét letters on the trade and government of  
America, and the principles of law &amp; polity  
applied to the American colonies,l shall make  
much use of this pamphlet beforel have done.  
In the year 1704, Mr. Bernard transmitted  
home to different noblemen and gentlemen  
four copies of his principles of law and pcly­  
ty, with a preface, which provesincopteiti­  
bly, that the project of new regulzfing the  
American colonies were not fir® suggested to  
him by the minifiry, but by him to them —  
The words of this preface are thefe.—&lt;“The  
present expectatior; that a new regulation of  
the American governments will soon take  
place, probably arises more from the opinion  
the public has ot the abilities of the present  
finifiry, than from any thing that has trans­  
pired from the cabinet : Iscannot be suppos­  
ed that their penetration can overlock the  
neceflity of {fuch a regulation, nor their pub­  
lic spirit fail to carry it into execution, —==  
But it may be a question, whether the present  
is 2 proper time for this work ; more urgent  
Business may stand before it ; some prepara­  
tory steps may be required to precede it ; but  
these will only serve to postpone. As we may  
expeét that this reformation, like all others ;  
will be opposed by powerful prejudices,it may  
not be amiss to reason with them at leisure,  
and endeavour to take off their force before  
they become opposed to government.”  
~ These are the words of that arch enemy of  
North-America, written in 1764, and then  
tranimitted to 4 perfonsy with a desire that  
they might be communicated to others. .  
Upon these words, it is impossible not to ob­  
serve, First, That the minifiry had never fig­  
nified to him, any intention of new regula­  
ting the colonies ; and therefore, that it was  
he who most officioufly &amp; impertinently put  
them upon the pursuit of this will with a  
whif{p, which has led himx and them into so  
much mire. 2. Fhe artful flattery with which  
be insinuates these projetts into the minds of  
the ministry, as matters of absolute necessity,  
which their great penetration could not fail  
to difcover,nor their great regard to the pub­  
lic, omit. 3. The importunity with which  
he urges a {peedy accomplitfhment of his pre­  
tended reformation of the governments, and  
4th, His confeioufnefs that these schemes  
would be opposed, altho’ he affeéls to expect  
from powerful prejudices only, that opposi­  
tion, which all Americans {ay, has been dic­  
tated by found reason, true policy, and eter­  
nal justice. TheJaft thing that I shall %alé’e  
notice of is, the artful, yet most falfe &amp; wick­  
ed.infinuaticn, that such new regulations were’  
then generallyexpedted.—This is so absolute­  
ly falfe, that excepting Bernard bimclf, and  
his junto, scarcely any body on this fide the  
water, had any suspicion of it,=---infomuch  
that if Bernard had made public at that time,  
his preface and principles, as he sent them to  
the ministry, it is much to be doubted whe­  
ther he could have lived in this country - --cer­  
tain it is, he would have had no friends in this  
province out of the junto.

Their mode of government would likewiſe  
long prevent an aim at independency,. and at  
the ſame time leave the people the full enjoy-  
ment of hberty ; that is, the Houſe of Repre-  
ſentatives to be elected by them, and the other  
two eſtates, the Council and Governor, to be  
appointed during pleaſure from the central  
power, as was the caſe, before theſe diſtur-  
bances, in all the royal governments.  
  
Governor Barnard, in the 86th propoſition  
in his Principles of Law and Polity, obſerves,  
there is no government in America at pre-  
e ſent, where the powers are properly balanced,  
«there not being in any of &#x27;them a real and

The obſervation is undoubtedly very juſt,  
as the Council, which is the middle power,  
are either appointed by the crown, during  
Pleaſure, and conſequently as dependent upon it  
as the governor, or in other Colonies choſen  
by the people, or the lower-houſe, and then  
become ſo much addition to the popular ſcale,  
therefore, no mediating power in either caſc.  
A remedy to this inconvenience, the Go-  
vernor points out in his 88th and 8gth pro-  
poſitions, viz.

trigues and wicked machinations; and to  
ſhew the riſe and progreſs of their ſchemes for  
enſlaving this country: The konour of invent-

due. They have been but ſervile copiers of  
the defigns of Androſs, Randolph, Dudley, and  
other champions of their cauſe towards the  
cloſe of the laſt century. Theſe latter Worthies  
accompliſhed but little; and their plans had

ot years, until in the Adminiſtfation of the late Go-

ſelf, his family, and his friends. Mr. Hutch-

Paxton, Ruggles, and a few others, were ſub-

one was to raiſe a Revenue in America by aus  
  
thority of Parliament.

ceſſary to concert meaſures with the other  
Colonies. Dr. Franklin, who was known to be  
an active, and very able man, and to have  
great influence in the Province of Pennſyl-  
vania, was in Boſton in the the year 1754, and  
Mr. Shirley communicated to him the profound  
ſecret, the great deſign of taxing the Colonies  
by Act of Parliament. This ſagacious Gentle-  
man, and diſtinguiſhed Patriot, to his laſting  
honour, fent the Governor an anſwer in writing,

Tx intention of the Junto, was to procute  
a revenue to be raiſed in America by Act of

ſentatives rendered uſeleſs, inſignificant, and even  
burthenſome) and abſolutely dependent upon,  
and under the direction of the will of the Mini-

make an intire new diviſion! of it into diſtinct,

* ture times (for there is no room to fear them

&lt; be to make the Governments large and re-

&lt; bably give ſtrength and ſtability to the Ame

cerning the origin. of the fcheme for the taxation of the colonies.  
  
‘ In the year 1764, Mr. Bernard tranfmitted home to different  
noblemen and gentlemen, four copies of his Principles of Law  
and Polity, with a preface, which proves inconteftibly, that  
the project of new regulating the American colonies was not firft  
fuggefied to him by the miniftry, but by him to them. The  
an of this preface are thefe: ‘* The prefent expectation that  
a new regulation of the American governments will foon take  
place, probably arifes more from the opinion the public has of  
the abilities of the prefent miniftry, than from any thing that  
has tranfpired from the cabinet. It cannot be fuppofed rhat  
their penetration can overlook the neceflity of fuch a regula-  
tion, nor their public fpirit fail to an it into execution.  
But it may be a queftion, whether the prefent is a proper time  
for this work ; more urgent bufinefs may ftand before it ; fome  
preparatory fteps may be required to precede it; but thefe will  
only ferve to poltpone. As we may expect that this reformation,  
like all others, will be oppofed by powerful prejudices, it may  
not be amifs to reafon with them at leifure, and endeavour to  
take. off their force before they become oppofed to gcvern-  
ment.” -  
  
* Upon thefe words, it is impoffible not to obferve, firft, th:t  
the minifiry had never ‘fignified to him ‘any intention of new

‘which has led:‘them into.fo much.mire. Second, the flattery  
with which he infinnates. thefe projects into the minds of the  
miniftry, as mateers,of abfolute..neceflity, which. their great  
penetration could not. fail.to difcover,:nor their great regard to  
the public omits Third, the importunity with which he urges  
a:fpeedy accomplithmentiof his, pretended;reformation of the  
governments,, .. And, fourth, , his .cenfcioufnefs. that. thefe  
{chemes would be oppofed,. although he. affeéts to expect from  
powerful prejudices only, that .oppofition, which all America  
fays had been dictated by found reafon, true policy, and eter-  
nal juftice. . Thelaft thing.I thal] take notice of is, the falfe  
infinuation, that: fuch new: regulations were then generally  
expected, This is fo abfolutely falfe, that, except Bernard  
himfelf, and his junto, fcarcely any body on this fide the wa-  
ter had any fufpicion of it; infomuch, that if Bernard had.  
raade public at that time his Preface and Principles, as he fent  
them to the miniftry,, it is much to be dobted whether he  
could have lived in this country ; certain it is, he would have  
had no friends.in this. province, out of the junto. |  
. «The intention of the junto was to procure a revenue to be  
raifed in America by act of parliament. Nothing was further  
from their defigns and wifhes, than the drawing or fending this  
revenue into,the exchequer in England, to be fpent there in&#x27;dif-  
chqagang the national debt, and leflening the burdens of the  
people there, ‘They chofe to have the fingering of the money  
themfelves.. Their defign. was, that the money fhould be ap-  
plied, fir in a large falary to the. governor.. “Phis would gra-  
tify Bernard, and render him and all other peverncr?, not only  
independent of the people, but {till more abfolutely a flave to  
the will of the minifter,. They intended likewife a falary for  
the lieutenant-governor. - This would appeafe Mr. Hutchinfon.  
In the next place, they intended a falary to the judges of com-  
mon law, .as: well as admiralty. And thus the whole govern--  
ment,. executive and judicial; was to be rendered. wholly inde-  
ndent of the people, (and. their reprefentatives rendered ufc-  
Es, infignificant, and even burthenfome) and abfolutely depend-  
ent upon, and under the direétion of the will of the minifter of  
ftate. They intended further to new model the whole continent  
of North America; make an intire new divifion of it into  
diftinét, though more extenfive and lefs numerous colonies, to  
{weep away all the charters upon the continent, with the de-  
ftroying befom of an aét of parliament, and reduce all the go-  
vernments to the plan of the royal governments, with a nobili  
in each colony, not hereditary indeed, at firft, but for life. They  
did indeed flatter the miniftry and people in England with diftant  
hopes of a revenue from America, at fome future period, to be  
appropriated to national ufes there. But this was not to happen,  
in their minds, for fome time. ‘Fhe porsromene muft be new

him in England, whofe cawings weté more troublefomie to his

thought if America could afford any revenue at all; and he  
could get it by authority of parliament; he might have it himfelf,

After noticing the letters of gov. B. the wri-

‘Now let me ask you—if the parliament of Great  
Britain had all the natural foundations of authority,  
wisdom, goodness, justice, power, in as great per-  
fection as they ever existed in any body of men  
since Adam’s fall: And, if the English nation was  
the most virtuous, pure, and free that ever, was,  
would not such an unlimited subjection of three  
millions of people to that parliament, at three thou-  
sand miles distance, be real slavery? There are but  
two sorts of men in the worid, freemen and slaves  
—The very definition of a freeman, is one who is  
bound by no law to which he has not consented.  
Americans would have no way of giving or with.  
holding their consent to the acts of this parliament;  
therefore they would not be freemen. -But, when  
luxury, effeminacy and venality are arrived at sucha  
shocking pitehin England; when both electors and  
elected are become one mass of corruption; when  
the nation is oppressed to death with debts and  
taxes, owing to their own extravagance, and want of

cerning the relations which the government at home sustained to their  
dependencies on the American continent. Proposition No. 30 was as  
follows: “The Parliament of Great Britain, as well from its rights of  
sovereignty as from occasional exigencies, has a right to make laws for,  
and impose taxes upon, its subjects in its external dominions, although  
they are not represented in such Parliament.” As we have seen, Gov-  
ernor Bernard subsequently held a different view from this. Indeed,  
in No. 65 of the “Principles” set forth in this “ Declaration,” it is  
declared that “it may be expedient that the Colonies be represented  
for quieting disputes concerning the authority of the Parliament over  
the Colonies.” How deep rooted in the mind of a representative of  
the upper classes of England was the feeling that an established nobility  
is desirable ina well-ordered commonwealth, appears in Nos. 87 and  
88 of the “Principles.” The first reads as follows: “ Although America  
is not now (and probably will not be for many years to come) ripe  
enough for the hereditary Modility, yet it is now capable of a nobility  
for life.” The second is; “A xodility appointed by the King for life,  
and made independent, would probably give strength and stability to  
the American governments, as effectually as an hereditary nobility does  
to that of Great Britain.” It is evident, moreover, that the English  
governors of this country (for without doubt Governor Bernard gives  
expression not simply to his personal views) believed that there shoul

necessary to reduce the number of them ;

1752, Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia,

It is evident that the more astute of the American  
patriots saw that as a practical measure it was idle to dis-  
cuss parliamentary representation, and that Franklin’s  
views on the subject went to sustain Samuel Adams’s  
assertion that Franklin was ‘a good philosopher but a  
poor politician.”  
  
John Adams, in his famous “ Novanglus Papers,” pub-  
lished in the Boston Gazette in 1774, referring to Frank-  
lin’s Shirley letters, says, “ The last of these propositions  
seems not to have been well considered, because an ade-  
quate representation in Parliament is totally impracti-  
cable.”
