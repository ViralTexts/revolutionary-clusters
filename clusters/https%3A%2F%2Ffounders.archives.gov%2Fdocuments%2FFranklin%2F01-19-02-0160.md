dence of the effect of the aurora on turbulence in the lower air is still slender and conflicting. The ship captain, in short, was formulating a problem that the next two centuries have not settled.  
  
Sir  
Spithead 12 August. 1772  
I have often wished that somebody would carefully Collate a sufficient number of Meteorological Journals with intent to observe and Class the several appearances in the Atmosphere before great Changes in the weather, particularly before great Storms. I am perswaded from my own observation that in general sufficient indications of impending Tempests preceed them a Considerable Time, did we but carefully note them. The phaenomenon which I am going to mention is one of those Indications which not only portend an approaching Tempest, but Ascertain from what Quarter it will come; a Circumstance that may render it of Essential Service to seamen. I believe the Observation is new, that the Aurora Borealis is constantly succeeded by hard Southerly or South West Winds, attended with Hazy Weather and Small Rain. I think I am warranted from Experience to say Constantly for in Twenty Three Instances that have occurr’d since I first made the Observation, it has invariably obtain’d. However I beg leave to request you will recommend it to the Notice of the Royal Society, as a matter which when confirmed by Further Observations and Generally known may be of more Consequence than at first Appears. To shew that it may, give me leave to recite the Circumstances which first occasiond my taking Notice of it. Sailing down the English Channel in 1769, a few days before the Autumnal Equinox we had a remarkably Bright and Vivid Aurora the whole Night. In shore the Wind was fluctuating between N.N.W. and N.W. and farther out W.N.W. Desirous of benefiting by the Land Wind and also of taking advantage of earlier Ebb Tyde, I dispensed with the good old Marine Adage (i.e. Never to approach too near a Weather Shore, lest it should prove a Lee Shore) and by short Tacks clung close along the English Coast. Next day the Wind veered to the S.W. and soon after to S.S.W. and sometimes S. We were then in that dangerous Bay between portland and the Start Point and Carried a pressing Sail with hopes of reaching Torbay before dark, but Night fell upon us with thick Haze and small Rain, in so much that we could not have seen the Land at the distance of a Ships Length. The Gale was now increased to a storm. In this dilemma nothing remained but to endeavor to keep off the Shore till the Wind should change. Luckily our Ship was a Stout One and well rigged.  
Reflecting sometime after on the Circumstances of this Storm and the Phanomena that preceded it, I determined to have particular attention to future Aurora and the Weather that should succeed them and, as I have observed above, in Twenty three Instances have found them uniform except in degree, the Gale generally Commencing between Twenty four and Thirty Hours after the first Appearance of the Aurora. More time and Observation will probably discover whether the Strength of the succeeding Gale is proportionate to the Splendor and Vivacity of the Aurora and the distance of Time between them. I only suspect that the more Brilliant and Active the first is, the sooner will the latter occur, be more Violent, but of shorter duration, than when the Light is languid and dull. Perhaps too the Colour of the Aurora may be some guide in forming a Judgment of the coming Gale. That which preceeded the Storm I have mentiond was exceedingly Splendid. The Tempest succeeded it in Less than Twenty Four Hours, was Violent, but of short (about Eight Hours) Continuance. In June last a little without soundings we had for Two Nights following faint inactive Aurora; the Consequent Gale was not hard but lasted near Three Days, the First day attended with Haze and small rain, the Second with Haze only and the last day Clear.  
The Benefit which this observation on the Aurora Borealis when further confirmd and known may be of to Seamen is obvious in Navigating near Coasts which tend East and West, particularly in the British Channel. They may, when warnd by the Aurora Borealis, get into port, and Evade the impending Storm, or, by Stretching over to the Southward, facilitate their Passage, by that very Storm, which might have destroyed them; for no Winds are so dangerous in the Channel as Southerly and South West. In a word, since I have made this observation, I have got out of the Channel, when other Men as alert, and in faster Sailing Ships, but unapprized of this Circumstance, have not only been driven back, but with difficulty have escaped Shipwreck. Perhaps the observation, that Southerly Gales constantly succeed these Phaenomena, may help to account for the Nature of the Aurora Borealis: my own thoughts on that Subject I shall sometime beg leave to lay before you.

I HAVE often wifhed that fomebody  
would carefully collate a fufficient  
  
number of . meteorological journals,  
  
with intent to obferve and clafs the  
feveral appearances in the aunotphere  
before gieat changes in the weather,  
particularly before great ftorms. [am  
perfuaded, from my own obiervation,  
that, in general, fuflicient indications  
of impending tempetts precede them  
  
a confiderabie time, did we but cares  
  
fully note them.  
  
The phanomenon which Iam go-  
ing to mention is one of thoie indi«  
cations which not only portend an ap-  
proaching tempett, but a‘certain from  
what quarter it will come; a circum-  
flance that may render it of effential  
fervice to feamey. I believe the objer-  
vation is new, that the Aurora Borealis  
is conitantly fucceeded by hard fouth-  
erly or feuth-weft winds, attended  
with hazy weather, and fmall rain.  
I think [ am warranted from experi-  
ence to fay conttartly ; for in twenty-  
three inftances that have occurred fince  
1 frit made the obdfervation, it has in-  
vaiably obtained. However, I kg  
leave to requeit that you will recom.  
mend it to the notice of the Royal So-  
ciety, as a nfatter which, when con-  
firmed by further obfervations, and  
genciaily known, may be of more  
confequence than at firft appears. To  
thew that it may, give me leave to res  
cite the circumftance which firft occa-  
fioned my taking notice of it. Sailing  
down the Engitth Channel in 176g a  
few days before the autumnal equinox,  
we had a remarkable bright and vivid  
aurora the whole night. In fhore the  
vind flufvating between N. N. W..  
and N. W. and farther out W. N. W.  
defirous of benefitting by the, land-  
wind, and allo of taking advantage  
of an earlier ebb-tide, I ditpenfed with  
the good old marine adage, “ Never  
to approach too near a weather. fhore,  
left it thould prove a lee-fhore,”’ and  
by fhort tacks ciung clofe along the  
Englith coaft. Next day the wind  
veered to the S, W. ard foon after to  
S. S. W. and fometines W. We  
were then in that dangerous bay be-  
tween Portland and the Start Point,  
and carried a preffing fail, with hopes  
of reaching Totbay before dork ; but  
night came on, with thick haze ard  
fmai} sain, infomuch that we could

not have feen the land at the diftance  
of a fhip’s length. The gale was now  
  
increafed to a ftoim: in this dilemma  
  
nothing remained but to endeavour to  
keep off the thore till the wind theuld  
change. Luckily our thip was a ftout  
  
one, and well rigged.  
  
Refi-&amp;ting, fome time after, on the  
  
cixcumftances of this form, and the  
phauomena that preceded it, I deter-  
mined to have particular attention to  
future aurore, and the weather that  
fhould fucceed them; and, as I ob-  
ferved above, in twenty-three inftances  
have found them uniform, except in  
degree; the gale generally commenc-  
ing between twenty-four and thirty  
hours after the firlt appearance of the  
awioiz. More time and obfervation  
will probably difcover whether the  
fivength of the fucceeding gale is pro-  
poitionate to the fplendor and vivacity  
of the aurora and the diftance of time  
between them. I only fufpeét that the  
more brilliant and aétive the firft is,  
the fooner will the latter otcur, be  
more violent, but of fhorter duration,  
than when the light is languid and  
doll. Perhaps, too, the colour of the  
auiora may be fome guide in forming  
a judgment of the coming gale. That  
which preceded the ftorm I have men-  
‘tioned was exceedingly {plendid. The  
tempeit (ucceeded it in lefs than twen-  
ty-four hours, was violent, but of thort  
continuance. In June laft, a little  
without foundings, we had for two  
nights following faint inaftive aurore ;  
the confequent gale was not hard, but  
Jatted near three days: the firft day  
attended with haze and fmall rain, the  
fecond with haze only, and.the laft day  
clear.  
  
The benefit which this obfervation  
on the Aurora Borealis, when further  
confirmed, may be of to feamen, is  
obvious, in navigating near coafts  
which extend caft and weft, particu-  
farly in the Britithh Channel, They  
may, when warned by this phenome-  
non, get into port, and evade the im-  
pending ftorm; or, by ftretching to  
she fouthward, facilitate their patlige  
by that very ftorn: which might other-  
wife have deflroyed them; for no winds  
are fo dangerous in the Channel! as the  
foutherly and feuth-weft. In a word,  
Since I have made this obfervation, I  
have got ont of the Channel, when  
other men, as alert, and in fatter-{ailing  
fhips, but unapprized of this circum-  
ftance, have not only been driven back,  
but with difficulty have «fCaped fhip-  
wreck,  
  
  
  
An Addrefs to the Manufatiurers of Great-Britain.  
  
Perhaps the obfervation that fouther-  
ly gales conftantly fucceed thefe pha-  
nothena may help to account for the  
nature of the Aurora Borealis; my  
own thoughts on that fubjeét I thall  
fome time beg leave to lay before you.

Sailing down the’ Englith channel in  
1769, a few days before the autumnal

rorz, and the weather that fhould fucceed  
  
MONTHLY MISCELLANY,  
  
[Jury,  
  
twenty-three inftances, have found them  
uniform, except in degree ; the gale ge-  
nerally commehcting between twenty-four  
and thirty hours after the firft appearance of  
the Aurora. More time and obfervation  
will probably difcover whether the ftrength  
of the fucceeding gale is proportionate to  
the {plendor and vivacity of the Aurora,  
and the diftance of tine between them. I  
only fufpeét that the more brilliant and

I HAVE often wished, that somebody would carefully collate a  
sufficient number of meteorological journals, with intent to observe,  
and class the several appearances in the atmosphere, before great  
changes in the weather, particularly before great storms. I am per¬  
suaded, from my own observation, that in general sufficient indi¬  
cations of impending tempests precede them a considerable time,  
did we but carefully note them. The phenomenon which I am going  
to mention is one of those indications, which not only portend an  
approaching tempest, but serves to ascertain from what quarter it  
will come; a circumstance that may render it of essential service  
to seamon. I believe the observation is new, that the Aurora Bore-  
  
WINN ON STORM*.  
  
109  
  
alis is fonstantly succoeiled by iiard southerly, or south-west winds,  
attended with hazy weather and small rain. I think I am warranted  
from experience to say constantly, for, in twenty-three instances  
that^iave occurred since I first made the observation, it has inva¬  
riably obtained. I beg leave, however, to recommend it to notice,  
us a mutter, which when confirmed by further observatiuns, and  
generally known, may be of more conse(|uencc than at first appears.  
  
To shew that it may, give me leave to recite the circumstance j  
  
which first occasioned my taking notice of it. Sailing down the I  
  
Knglish channel a few days before the autumnal equinox, we hod j  
  
a remarkably bright and vivid Aurora the whole night. In  
shore, the wind was fluctuating, between N.N.W. and N.W., and  
farther out W.N.W. Desirous of benefiting by the land wind, and  
also of taking advantage of an earlier ebb tide, I dispensed with  
the good old marine adage, never to approach too near a weather  
shore, lest it should prove a lee shore ; and, by short tacks, clung  
close along the English coast. Next day the wind veered to the  
S.W., and soon after to the S. S.W., and sometimes to the S. We  
were then in that dangerous bay between Portland and the Start  
point, and carried a pressing sail, with hopes of reaching Torbay  
before dark} but night fell upon us with thick haze and small rain,  
insomuch, that we could not have seen the land the distance of a  
ship’s length. The gale was now increased to a storm; in this di¬  
lemma nothing remained but to endeavour to keep off the shore till  
the wind should change. Luckily the vessel was a stout one, and  
well rigged.  
  
Reflecting some time after on the circumstance of this storm,  
and the phenomena that preceded it, I determined to pay parti¬  
cular attention to future Aurorae, and the weather that should succeed  
them; and, as I have above observed, in twenty-three instances  
have found them uniform, except in degree : the gale generally com¬  
mencing between twenty-four and thirty hours after the appearance  
of the Aurora. More time and observation will probably discover,  
whether the strength of the succeeding gale is proportionate to the  
splendour and vivacity of the Aurora, and the distance of time be¬  
tween them. I suspect that the more brilliant and active the first  
is, the sooner will the latter occur, and will be more violent, but of  
shorter duration than when the light is languid and dull. Perhaps, too,  
the colour of the Aurora may be some guide in forming a judgment of  
the coming gale. That which preceded the storm 1 have mentioned  
was exceedingly splendid. The tempest succeeded it in less than

twenty-four hours, was violent, but of short (about eight hours)  
continuance. In June last, a little without soundings, we had, for  
two nights following, faint, inactive Aurorae j the consequent gale  
was not hard, but lasted nearly three days: the first day attended with  
haze and small rain; the second with haze only 3 and the last day  
clear.  
  
The benefit which this observation on the Aurora Borealis, when  
further confirmed and known, may be of to seamen is obvious, in  
navigating near coasts, which extend east and west, particularly in  
the British Channel. They may, when warned by the Aurora Bore¬  
alis, get into port, and evade the impending storm ; or, by stretching  
over to the southward, facilitate their passage by that very storm,  
which might have otherwise destroyed them 3 for no winds are so  
dangerous in the channel as southerly and south-west. In a word,  
since I have made this observation I have got out of the channel,  
when other men, as alert and in faster sailing ships, but unapprised  
of this circumstance, have not only been driven back, but with  
difficulty escaped shipwreck. Perhaps the observation, that south¬  
erly gales constantly succeed this phenomenon, may help to account  
for the nature of the Aurora Borealis.

lest it should prove a lee-shore ; and by short tacks clung close  
along the English coast. Next day the wind veered to the S.W.,  
and soon after 8.S.W., and sometimes S. We were then in  
that dangerous bay between Portland and the Start Point, and  
carried a pressing sail, with hopes of reaching Torbay before  
dark ; but night fell upon us with thick haze and small rain,  
insomuch that we could not have seen the land the distance of  
a ship’s length. The gale now increased to a storm; nothing  
remained but to endeavour to keep off the shore till the wind  
should change. Luckily our ship was a stout one, and well  
rigged.

“ I believe the observation is new that  
the Aurora Borealis is constantly succeed¬  
ed by hard southetly or south-west winds,  
attended with hazy weather and small  
rain; I think I am warranted, from ex-  
perience^to say, constantly ; for in twenty-  
three instances that have occurred since I  
first made the observation, it lias invaria¬  
bly obtained.  
  
“ Sailing down the English Channel, in  
1769, a few days before the autumnal  
equinox, w’e had a remarkably bright and  
vivid Aurora the whole night. In-shore,  
the wind was fluctuating between north-  
north-west and north-west; and farther  
out, west-north-west. Desirous of bene¬  
fiting by the land wind, and also of taking  
advantage of an earlier ebb-tide, I dis¬  
pensed with the good old marine adage,  
never to approach too near a weather-  
shore, lest it should prove a lee-shore;  
and by short tacks clung close along the  
English coast. Next day the wind veered  
to the south-west, and soon after south-
