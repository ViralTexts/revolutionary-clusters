 Thing but what was imputed to pure disinterested Patriotism. I never could do any Thing but what was ascribed to Sinister Motives.  
4. I agree with you in Sentiment that Religion and Virtue are the only Foundations; not only of Republicanism and of all free Government: but of Social Felicity under all Governments and in all the Combinations of human Society. But if I should inculcate this doctrine in my Will, I should be charged with Hypocrisy and a desire to conciliate the good Will of the Clergy towards my Family as I was charged by Dr Priestly and his Friend Cooper and by Quakers, Baptists and I know not how many other Sects, for instituting a National Fast and for even common Civility to the Clergy, and for being a Church going Annimal.  
5 If I Should inculcate those “National Social, domestic and religious Virtues” you recommend; I should be Suspected and charged with an hypocritical, machiavilian, Jesuitical, Pharasaical Attempt to promote a national establishment of Presbyterianism in America. Whereas I would as Soon establish The Episcopal Church; and almost as Soon the Catholic Church.

Moral Instruction and Social Improvement like a Phylosopher or Statesman: I Should be charged with vain ostentation again, and a Selfish desire to revise the Remembrance of my own Punctuality in this Respect; for it is notorious enough, that I have been a Church going Animal for Seventy Six years, i.e. from the Cradle And this has been alledged as one Proof of my Hypocrisy.  
9. Fifty three years ago I was fired with a Zeal, amounting to Enthusiasm against ardent Spirits, the Multiplication of Taverns, Retailers, Dramshops and tippleing Houses; grieved to the heart to See the Number of idlers, Thieves Sots and consumptive Patients made for the Phisicians, in those infamous seminaries. I applied to the Court of Sessions, procured a Committee of Inspection and Inquiry; reduced the Number of licenced Houses &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c But I only acquired the Reputation of a Hypocrite and an ambitious Demagogue by it; the Number of licenced Houses was soon reinstated Drams Grog and Sotting were not diminished, and remains to this day as deplorable as ever. You may as well preach to the Indians Against Rum as to our People. Little Turtle petioned me to prohibit Rum to be Sold to his Nation; for a very good Reason, because he Said I had lost three thousand of my Indian Children in his Nation in one year by it.  
Sermons, moral discourses, Phylosophical dissertations, medical Advice are all lost upon this Subject. Nothing but making the Commodity Scarce and dear, will have any Effect. And your Republican Friend and I had almost Said mine, Jefferson, would not permit, Rum or Whiskey to be taxed.  
If I should then in my Will, my Dying Legacy, my posthumous Exhortation, call it what you will, recommend heavy, prohibitory Taxes upon Spirituous Liquors, which I believe to be the only Remedy against their deleterious Qualities in Society, every one of your Brother Republicans and Nine tenths of the Federalists would Say that I was a canting Puritan a profound Hypocrite, setting up Standards of Morality, Frugality, Œconomy, Temperance and Simplicity and Sobriety that I know the Age was incapable of.  
10. Funds and Banks. I never approved or was Satisfied with our Funding System. It was founded on no consistent Principle. It was contrived to enrich particular Individuals at the public Expence. Our whole banking System I ever abhored, I continue to abhor, and shall die abhorring. But I am not an Ennemy to Funding Systems. They are absolutely and indispensably necessary in the present State of the World. An Attempt to annihilate or prevent them would be as Romantic an Adventure, as any in Don Quixot or in Oberon: A national Bank of deposit, I believe to be wise, just, prudent, œconomical and necessary. But every Bank of discount; every Bank by which Interest is to be paid, or Profit of any Kind made by the Deponent, is downright Corruption. It is taking the Public for the benefit and profit of Individuals. It is worse than Old time, continental Curency; or any other Paper Money.  
Now Sir, If I should talk in this Strain, after I am dead, you know the People of America would pronounce that I had died mad.  
11 My opinion is that a circulating Medium of Gold and Silver only ought to be introduced and established, that a National Bank of Deposit only, with a Branch in each State, all to  small sum, Two Million of Dollars Should be allowed; that every Bank in the Union ought to be annihilated and every Bank of Discount, prohibited to all Eternity. Not one farthing of Profit should ever be allowed on any Money deposited in the Bank.
