Sir,  
Boston, 7th May 1767.  
I am indebted to you for the obliging manner in which you receiv’d my recommendation of my good friend Mr. Paxton, as well as for the account you are pleased to send me of the situation of affairs in the mother country.  
  
I am very sorry that the colonies give you so much employment, and it is impossible to say how long it will be before things settle into quiet among us. We have some here who have been so busy in fomenting the late disturbances, that they may now think it needful for their own security to keep up the spirit. They have plumed themselves much upon the victory they have gained, and the support they have since met with; nor could any thing better shew what they would still be at, than the manner in which by their own account published in the news-papers last August they celebrated the 14th of that month, as the first anniversary commemoration of what they had done at the tree of liberty on that day the year before. Here a number of respectable gentlemen as they inform us now met, and among other toasts drank general Paoli, and the spark of liberty kindled in Spain. I am now speaking of a few individuals only, the body of the people are well disposed, yet when you come to see the journal of the house of representatives the last session, I fear you will think that the same spirit has seized our public counsels. I can however fairly say thus much in behalf of the government, that the last house was packed by means of a public proscription just before the election, of the greatest part of those who had appeared in the preceding session in the support of government: their names were published in an inflammatory news-paper, and their constituents made to believe they were about to sell them for slaves. Writs are now out for a new assembly, but I cannot answer for the choice: I hope however that the people in general are in a better temper; yet the moderate men have been so browbeaten in the house, and found themselves so insignificant there the last year, that some of them will voluntary decline coming again. I thinks this looks too much like a despair of the common-wealth, and cannot be justified on patriotic principles.  
The election of counsellors was carried the last year as might have been expected from such an house. The officers of the crown and the judges of the superior court were excluded. And I hear that it is the design of some who expect to be returned members of the house this year to make sure work at the ensuing election of counsellors, by excluding, if they can, the gentlemen of the council (who by charter remain such ’till others are chosen in their room) from any share in the choice, tho’ they have always had their voice in it hitherto from the first arrival of the charter. If the house do this, they will have it in their power to model the council as they please, and throw all the powers of government into the hands of the people, unless the governor should again exert his negative as he did the last year.  
You have doubtless seen some of the curious messages from the late house to the governor, and can’t but have observed with how little decency they have attacked both the governor and the lieutenant governor. They have also in effect forced the council to declare themselves parties in the quarrel they had against the latter in a matter of mere indifference. In their message to the governor of the 31st of January they have explicitly charged the lieutenant governor (a gentleman to whom they are more indebted than to any one man in the government) with “ambition and lust of power”, merely for paying a compliment to the governor agreeable to ancient usage, by attending him to court and being present in the council-chamber when he made his speech at the opening of the session; at which time they go on to say, “none but the general court and their servants are intended to be present”, still holding out to the people the servants of the crown as objects of insignificance, ranking the secretary with their door-keeper, as servants of the assembly; for the secretary with his clerks and the door-keeper are the only persons present with the assembly on these occasions.  
The officers of the crown being thus lessen’d in the eyes of the people, takes off their weight and influence, and the balance will of course turn in favor of the people, and what makes them still more insignificant is their dependance on the people for a necessary support: If something were left to the goodwill of the people, yet nature should be sure of a support. The governor’s salary has for about 35 years past been pretty well understood to be a thousand pound a year sterling. When this sum was first agreed to, it was very well; but an increase of wealth since has brought along with it an increase of luxury, so that what was sufficient to keep up a proper distinction and support the dignity of a governor then, may well be supposed to be insufficient for the purpose now. The lieutenant governor has no appointments as such: the captaincy of Castle-William which may be worth £120 sterling a year is looked upon indeed as an appendage to his commission, and the late lieutenant governor enjoyed no other appointment: he lived a retired life upon his own estate in the country, and was easy. The present lieutenant governor indeed has other appointments, but the people are quarrelling with him for it, and will not suffer him to be easy unless he will retire also.  
The secretary may have something more than £200 a year sterling, but has for the two last years been allowed £60 lawful money a year less than had been usual for divers years preceding, tho’ he had convinced the house by their committee that without this deduction he would have had no more than £250 sterling per annum in fees, perquisites and salary altogether, which is not the one half of his annual expence.  
The crown did by charter reserve to itself the appointment of a governor, lieutenant governor and secretary: the design of this was without doubt to maintain some kind of balance between the powers of the crown and of the people; but if officers are not in some measure independent of the people (for it is difficult to serve two masters) they will sometimes have a hard struggle between duty to the crown and a regard to self, which must be a very disagreeable situation to them, as well as a weakening to the authority of government. The officers of the crown are very few and are therefore the more easily provided for without burdening the people: and such provision I look upon as necessary to the restoration and support of the King’s authority.  
But it may be said how can any new measures be taken without raising new disturbances? The manufacturers in England will rise again and defeat the measures of government. This game ’tis true has been played once and succeeded, and it has been asserted here, that it is in the power of the colonies at any time to raise a rebellion in England by refusing to send for their manufactures. For my own part I do not believe this. The merchants in England, and I don’t know but those in London and Bristol only, might always govern in this matter and quiet the manufacturer. The merchant’s view is always to his own interest. As the trade is now managed, the dealer here sends to the merchant in England for his goods; upon these goods the English merchant puts a profit of 10 or more probably of 15 per cent when he sends them to his employer in America. The merchant is so jealous of foregoing this profit, that an American trader cannot well purchase the goods he wants of the manufacturer; for should the merchant know that the manufacturer had supplied an American, he would take off no more of his wares. The merchants therefore having this profit in view will by one means or other secure it. They know the goods which the American market demands, and may therefore safely take them off from the manufacturer, tho’ they should have no orders for shipping them this year or perhaps the next; and I dare say, it would not be longer before the Americans would clamour for a supply of goods from England, for it is vain to think they can supply themselves. The merchant might then put an advanced price upon his goods, and possibly be able to make his own terms; or if it should be thought the goods would not bear an advanced price to indemnify him, it might be worth while for the government to agree with the merchants before hand to allow them a premium equivalent to the advance of their stock, and then the game would be over.  
I have wrote with freedom in confidence of my name’s not being used on the occasion. For though I have wrote nothing but what in my conscience I think an American may upon just principles advance, and what a servant of the crown ought upon all proper occasions to suggest, yet the many prejudices I have to combat with may render it unfit it should be made public.  
I communicated to governor Bernard what you mentioned concerning him, who desires me to present you his compliments, and let you know that he is obliged to you for the expressions of your regard for his injured character. I am with great respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,  
Andw. Oliver.  
  
I ask your acceptance of a journal of the last session which is put up in a box directed to the secretary of the board of trade.

Boſton, = May 1767.  
SIR, |  
AM indebted.to you for the obliging manner  
  
in which you receiv&#x27;d my recommendation  
of my good friend Mr. Paxton, as well as for the  
account you are pleaſed to ſend me of the ſitua-  
tion of affairs in the mother country. _ _  
  
I am very forry that the colonies give you  
ſo much employment, and it is impoſſible to ſay  
how long it will be before things ſettle into quiet  
among us. We have ſome here who have been  
ſo buſy in fomenting the late diſturbances, that  
they may nowethink it needful for their own ſe-  
.curity to keep up the ſpirit, They have plumed  
themſelves much upon the victory they have  
gained, and the ſupport they have ſince met with ;  
nor could any thing better ſhew what they would  
ſtill be at, than the manner in which by their own  
account publiſhed i in the news-papers laſt Auguſt  
they celebrated the 14th of that month, as the  
  
firſt anniverſaty commemoration of what any  
ha  
  
  
  
as they inform us now met, and a-  
mong other toaſts drank general Paoli, and the  
ſpark of liberty kindled in Spain. I am now  
{peaking of 2 few individuals only, the body of  
the people are well diſpoſed, yet when you come  
to ſee the journal of the houſe of repreſentatives  
the lat ſeſſion, I fear you will think that the  
ſame ſpirit hes ſeized our public counſels: I att  
however fairly ſay thus much in behalf of the  
government; that the laſt houſe was picked by  
means of a pubhe proſcti ption juſt before the  
election, of the greateſt part of thoſe who had  
appeared in the preceding ſeſſion in the A  
government: their names were publi in  
an inflammatory news- paper, and their conſtitu-⸗  
ents made to believe they were about to ſell them  
for ſlaves, Writs are now out fot a new aſſem-  
bly, but I cannot anſwer for the choice: I hope  
however that the people in general are in a bettet  
temper ; yet the moderate mei have been ſo  
browbeaten in the - houſe, and found themſelves  
ſo inſignificant thete the Jaſt year; that ſome of  
them will voluntarily decline comirig again. I  
think this. Jooks too much like a deſpait of the  
common-wealth, and cannot be juſtified on pa-  
triotic principles. oy 3  
| The elechon of counſellofs was Eartied the  
laſt yeat as might have been expected from ſuch  
an houſe. 1 he officers of the crown and the  
jedges of the ſtiperior court were excluded. And

feſlors, dy excluding if they ran, the gemlemen  
of the councib (who by charter femain ſuch till  
others are choſen in their room) from any ſhare

voice in it hitherto” from the firſt arrival of the  
charter, If the houſe do this, they will have  
it in their power to model the council as they  
  
leaſe, and throw all the powers of government  
into the hands of the people, unleſs the gover nor  
ſhould again exert his negative as he did the laſt  
  
ear. 145 8  
Jou have doubtleſs ſeen ſome of the corivus  
meſſages from the late houſe to the governor, and  
can&#x27;t but have obſerved with how little decency  
they have attacked both the govetnor and the  
Heutenant governor. They have alſo in effect  
forced the council to declare themſelves parties  
in the quarrel they had againſt the latter in a  
matter of mere indifference. In their meſſage  
to the goverfor of the 31ſt of January they  
have  explicirly charged the lieutenant governor  
(a gentleman toom they are more indebted  
than to ahy one man in the government) with  
« ambition and luſt of power“, merely for pay-  
ing a compliment to the governor agrecable to  
ancient uſage, dy attending him to court and  
being preſent- in the couneil-· chamber when he  
made his ſpeech at the opening of the ſeſſion;  
at which time they go onto ſay, ** none but the  
general court and their ſervants are intended to  
be preſent“, ſtill holding out to the people the  
ſervants of the crown as objects of infignificance,  
ranking the ſecretary with their door-keeper, a8  
ſervants of the aſſembly; for the ſecretary with  
his clerks and the door-keeper are the on

The officers of the crown. being ihus leſſen d  
in the eyes of the people, takes off their weight  
and influence; and the balance will of courſe  
turn in favor of the people, and what makes  
them ſtill more inſignificant is their dependanee  
on the people fot a neceſſary ſupport : If ſomt-  
thing were left to the goodwill: of the people.  
yet nature ſhould be ſure of 2 ſupport. The  
governot&#x27;s ſalary has for about 35 years paſt  
been pretty well underſtood to be à thouſand  
pound a year ſterling. When this ſum was firſt  
agreed to, it was very well; but an increaſe of  
wealth ſince has brought along with it an increaſe  
of luxury, ſo that what was ſufficient to keep up  
a proper diſtinction and ſupport the dignity” of a  
governor then, may well be ſuppoſed to be in-  
ſufficient for the purpoſe now. The lieutenant  
governor has no appointments as ſuch : the ca  
taincy of Caſtle-William which may be worth  
L120 ſterling a year is looked vpon indeed as  
an appendage to his commiſſion, and the late lieu-  
tenant governor enjoyed no other appointment :  
he lived a retired life upon his own eſtate in the  
country, and was eaſy. The preſent lieus enant  
governor indeed has other appointments, but the  
people are quarrelling with him for it, and will  
not fuffer him to be eaſy unleſs he will retire alſo.  
The ſecretary may have ſomething more than  
L. zoo a year ſterling, but has for the two laſt  
ears been allowed C. 60 lawful money a year  
Jeſs than had been uſual for divers years preced-  
wg, tho&#x27; he had convinced the houſe by their  
committee that without this deductien he would

as at Governor Hutchinfon’s: * This game,  
fays he, has been played once, and fucceeded;  
and it has been aflerted here, that it is in the  
power of the colonies at any time to raife a  
rebellion in England by refufing to fend for  
their manufaétures. For my own part, I  
do not believe this. The merchants in  
England, and I do not know but thofe in  
London and Briftol only, might always go-  
vern jn this matter and quiet the manufac-  
turer, The merchant&#x27;s view is always to  
his own intereft. As the trade is now ma-  
naged, the dealer here fends to the merchant  
in England tor his goods ; upon thele goods  
the Englith merchant puts a profit of ten or  
more, probably of fifteen per cent. when he  
fends them to his employer in America.  
The merchant is fo jealous of foregoing this  
profit, that an American trader cannot well  
purchafe the goods he wants of the manu-  
fa&amp;turer ; for, fhould the merchant know  
that the manufacturer had fupplied an Ame-  
rican, he would take off no more of his  
wares. The merchants therefore having  
this profit in view will by cne means or other  
fecure it. ‘They know the goods which the  
American market demands, and may there-  
fore fafely take them off from the manufac-  
turer, though they fhould have no orders for  
fhipping them this year, or perhaps the next;  
and I dare fay it would not be long before  
the Americans would clamour for a fupply  
of goods from England, for it is vain to  
think they can fupply themflves. The  
merchant might then put an advanced price  
upon his goods, and poffibly be able to  
make his own terms; or, if it fhould be

S I R, Bojfon, Alay 7. 1767.  
  
I AM indebted to you for the obliging  
manner in whicli you received my  
rccomnieniiation of my gOvid friend Mr

1 am very fony th&gt;»l the colonies give  
you fo much emnloyment, and it is im-

they may now think it needful for their

aheir owm account publilhed in the news¬

a4th of that month, as the firft anaiver-  
fary commemoration of what they hid  
&lt;1one at the tree of liberty on that day  
the year before. Here a number of re-

you will think that the fame fjftrit has  
feized our public counfels- 1 cr.n, how-  
rvei, fanly l«v thus much in behalf of  
the poverinnent, that the laft houfe was  
packed by means of a public prufcriptic.n  
luft before the clr^lon, of the greatrft  
part of thofe who had appealed in the  
preccibng feftion in the fnpport of go¬  
vernment: their na.mes were pubh&#x27;Oud  
in an infiammatory news-paper, and their  
conftitiients m^o’e to believe they were  
about to fell them fiw fnve^. Writs arc  
fjow ont for a new aflembly, but I can¬  
not ahfwer for the choice: I hope, how¬  
ever. that the people in general are in  
^ betU&#x27;f temper; yet the motltrate men

peAed from luch a ho’ule. The ^^fiicers  
of the crown, and the judges ofdl|e fu-

that it is the dciign of fomc who cxpeilt

the firft arrival of the charteu If the  
houfe do this, they will have it in thtir

pleafe, and tnrow all the powers of go^

his negative as he dwl tlK Uft year.

it is in the power of the colonies at any

For my own part, I do noi believe this.  
Ti»c merchants in Englaml, and I d»» notr^

merchant’s view is always to his ovi’it  
interclf. As the trade is now managed^  
the dealer here fends to the merchant in  
England for his govds; upon thefe goods  
the Engliili merchant puts a fvrofit of i(&gt;  
or more, probably of 15 per cent.‘whea  
he fends them to his employer in Ai^-  
rica. The merchant is fo jealous of forc- ^  
going this protit, th.it an .American tra¬  
der cannot well puichafe the goods he  
wants of the manufaClurer; for, fhould?  
the merchant know that the manufadue.  
rer had Tupplicd an American, he woulcE  
take off no more of his waies. Thr^  
merchants therefore having this pri&gt;li&amp;  
in view, will, by one means or other, fe-^  
cure it. They know the good* wjhichi  
the American market demands, and^uay*  
therefore fafely take them ail from the^&#x27;  
manufacturer, though they Ihotid hav&lt;»  
no orders for Hiipping them this year, or^  
perhaps the next; and I dare fay^, i^  
would not be longer before the Am.cri-,  
cans ould clamour for a lupply qf goedi  
fri m England; for it is vain to think theyl  
can fupply ihcmfclvcR. The merchant  
might then put an advanced price U|)on‘  
hikgo&#x27;&gt;d«, a»»d prfliWy be able to maka  
his own terms; or if it (liould be thought  
the goods would not bear an .idvan^Ci^  
price to indemnify him, it might be vror III  
while for the government to agree witli;  
the merchants before-hand, to allovr.  
them a premium equiv;4lent to the ad*

. I hope we ſhall  
fee better times both here and in England.  
  
” 1 am, with great eſteem,  
  
Sir, 2 moſt obedient ſervant,  
  
THO. HUTCHINSON.  
  
11  
  
SIR. „ 1 Ins. Mo 7, 35  
AM indebted to you for the obliging manner in which.  
  
. you received my recommendation of my good friend  
| Mr. Paxton, as well as for the account you are pleaſed to  
  
  
l am very ſorry that the colonies give you fo much em-  
ployment, and it is impoſſible to ſay how long it will be .  
before things ſettle into quiet among us. We have ſome  
here who have been ſo buſy in fomenting the late diſtur-  
bances, that they may now think it needful for their own  
  
ſecurity to keep up the ſpirit. They have plumed them- &#x27;T  
| ſelves much upon the victory they have gained, and the  
  
ſupport they have ſince met with ; nor could any thing  
| better ſhew what they would ſtill be at, than the manner  
in which, by their own account publithed in the news-pa-  
pers laſt Auguſt, they celebrated the 14th of that month,  
  
a5 the firſt anniverſary. commemoration of u hat they had  
85 done  
  
16 1  
  
done at the tree of liberty on that day the year before,  
Here a number of reſpectable gentlemen, as they inform  
  
  
ing of a few individuals only, the body of the people are  
well difpoſed ; yet when you come to ſee the journal of  
the Houſe of Repreſentatives the laſt ſeſſion, I fear you |  
will think that the ſame ſpirit has ſeized our public coun-  
fels. I can, however, fairly ſay thus much in behalf of the  
government, that the laſt houſe was packed by means of  
2 public proſcription juſt before the election, of the  
greateſt part of thoſe who had appeared in the preceding  
ſeſſion in the ſupport of government: their names were  
publiſhed in an inflammatory news- paper, and their con-  
ſtituents made to believe they were about to fell them for  
flaves. Writs are now out for a new aſſembly, but I can-_  
not anſwer for the choice : I hope, however, that the peo-  
  
  
| have been fo brow-beaten in the houſe and found them-  
ſelves ſo inſignificant there the laſt year, that ſome of them  
vill voluntarily decline coming again. I think this looks _  
too much like a deſpair of the common-wealth, and « can-  
not be juſtified on patriotic principles.  
The election of counſellors was carried the laſt year as  
might have been expected from ſuch an houſe. The offi-  
  
  
excluded. And I hear that it is the deſign of ſome, who  
expect to be returned members of the houſe this year, to  
make ſure work at the enſuing election of counſellors, by  
excluding, if they can, the gentlemen of the council,  
{who by charter remain ſuch *till others are choſen in their  
room) from any ſhare in the choice, though they have al-  
ways had their voice in it hitherto from the firſt arrival of  
  
  
power to model the council as they pleaſe, and throw all the  
powers of werben into the hands of che people, unleſs  
535 the  
  
0 83-1  
the Governor ſhould again exert his negative as 5 he did the  
laſt year. vo  
  
You have doubtleſ; ſcen ſome of the curious mel: ages  
from the late houſe to the Governor, and can&#x27;t but have  
obſerved with how little decency they have attacked both _  
the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, They have  
alio in effect, forced the Council to declare themſelves par-  
ties in the quarrel they had agaiuſt the latter in a matter  
  
of mere indifference. In their meſſage to the Governor  
of the 31ſt of January, they have explicitly charged the  
  
Lieutenant Governor (a gentleman to whom they are  
more indebted than to any one man in. the government)  
  
with“ ambition and Juſt of power,“ merely for paying a  
  
compliment to the Governor agreeable to ancient uſage,  
by attending him to court, and being preſent in the council-  
chamber when he made his ſpecch at the opening of the  
  
  
general court and their ſervants are intended to be preſent,”  
ſtill holding out to the people the ſervants of the crown as  
objects of inſignificance, ranking the Secretary with their  
door-keeper, as ſervants of the Aſſembly; for the Secre-  
  
| tary with his clerks and the door-keeper are the only per-  
ſons preſent with the Aſſembly on theſe occaſions.  
The officers of the crown being thus leſſen&#x27;d in the eyes  
of the people, takes off their weight and influence, and the  
balance will of courſe turn in favour of the people, and  
  
what makes them ſtil] more inſignificant is their depen-  
dance on the people for a neceſſary ſupport : If ſomething  
were left to the goodwill of the people, yet nature ſhould  
be ſure of a ſupport. The Governor&#x27;s ſalary has for about  
thirty-five years paſt been pretty well underftood to be  
. Iooo a year ſterling. When this ſum was firſt agreed  
to, 1t was very well; but an increaſe of wealth ſince, has  
brought along with it an increaſe of luxury; ſo that what  
Was {uthcient to keep up a proper diſtinction and ſupport  
the dignity of a Goyernor then, may well be ſuppoſed to  
V be  
  
E  
  
be inſufficient for the purpoſe now. I be 3 Go-  
vernor has no appointments as ſuch: the captaincy ot  
Caſtle-William, which may be worth f..120 ſterling 4  
year, is looked upon indeed as an appendage to his com-  
ruſſion, and the late Lieutenant Governor enjoyed no  
other appointment: he lived a retired life upon his o.] ]u  
_ eſtate in the country, and was eaſy. The preſent Lieute-  
nant Governor indeed has other appointments, but the  
  
  
him to be caſy unleſs he will retire alſo.  
  
&quot; Secretary may have ſomething more than { 200  
a ycar ſterling, but has for the two laſt years been allowed  
. 60 lawful money a year leſs than had been uſual for  
divers years preceding, though he had convinced the houſe  
by their committee, that without this deduction he would  
have had no more than . 250 ſterling | per annum in fees,  
| perquiſites and ſalary altogether, which | 15 not the one half  
of his annual expence. =  
Ihe crown did by charter reſerve to ufelf the appoint-  
ment of a Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Secretary:  
the deſign of this was without doubt to maintain ſome kind  
of balance between the powers of the crown and of the  
people; but, if officers are not in ſome meaſure independent  
of the people (for it is difficult to ſerve two maſters) they  
will ſometimes have a hard ſtruggle between duty to the  
crown and a regard to ſelf, which muſt be a very diſagree-  
able ſituation to them, as well as a weakening to the au-  
khority of government. The officers of the crown are  
very few, and are therefore the more eaſily provided for  
without burdening the people: and ſuch proviſion I lock  
1 pon as neceſſary ta the re ſtoration and Support 4 the King”, &quot;op  
_ authority.  
But it may be aid, How can any new 8 be inken  
without raiſing new diſturbances? The manufacturers in  
England will rite again and defeat the meaſurcs of govern-  
ment. This game, &#x27;tis true Bas becn ka ed once and  
ljuccec dea  
  
1 19 l  
ſucceeded, and it has been aſſerted here, that it is in the  
power of the colonies at any time to raiſe a rebellion in  
England, by refuſing to ſend for their manufactures. For  
my own part, I do not believe this. The merchants in  
England, and I don&#x27;t know but thoſe in London and Briſtol  
only, might always govern in this matter and quiet the ma- |  
nufacturer. The merchant&#x27;s view is always to his own |  
Intereſt. As the trade is now managed, the dealer here  
ſends to the merchant in England for his goods, upon theſe  
goods the Engliſh merchant puts a profit of 10 or more,  
probably 15 per cent. when he ſends them to his employer  
in America. The merchant is ſo jealous of foregoing this  
profit, that an American trader cannot well purchaſe the  
goods he wants of the manufacturer; for ſhould the mer-  
| chant know that the manufacturer had ſupplied an Ame-  
rican, he would take off no more of his wares. The  
merchants therefore having this profit in view will by one  
means or other ſecure it. They know the goods which  
the American market demands, and may therefore ſately  
take them off from the manufacturer, tho&#x27; they ſhould  
have no orders for ſhipping them this year or perhaps the  
next; and 1 dare ſay, it would not be longer before the  
Americans would clamour for a ſupply of goods from  
England, for it is vain to think they can ſupply themſelves.  
The merchant might then put an advanced price upon his  
goods, and poſſibly be able to make his own terms; or if  
it ſhould be thought the goods would not bear an advanced  
price to indemnify him, it might be worth while for the  
government to agree with the merchants before hand to  
allow them a premium equivalent to the advance of their  
ſtock, and then the game would be over.  
J have wrote with freedom, in confidence of my name&#x27;s  
nol being uſed on the occaſion. For though I have wrote  
nothing but what in my conſcience | think an American  
may upon juſt principles advance, and what a fervant of  
the crown ought upon all proper occaſions to ſuzgelt, yet  
C 2 the

un fit it ſhould be made public.

concerning him, who defires me to preſent you his compli-  
ments, and let you know that he 1s obliged to you for the  
e of your regard for nis injured character

in which you received my recommendation of  
thy good friend Mr. Paxton, as wdll as for the

I am very fotry that the colonies give you 0  
much employment, and it is impoſſible to ſay  
ho long it will be before things ſettle into. quiet

now managed, the dealer here ſends to the mer-  
  
chant in England for his goods, upon theſe,goods,  
  
  
more, probably 1 5 Per cent. when he ſends them  
to his employer in America. The merchant is.  
  
  
rican trader cannot well purchaſe the goods he  
wants of the manufacturer; for Would the  
merchant know that the manufacturer had ſup⸗  
plied an American, he would take off no more  
of his wares. The merchants therefore having  
this profft in view will by one means or other  
  
  
American  
  
t 15 .  
  
ay take them off from the manufacturer, the!  
they ſhould have- no orders for ſhipping them  
this year or perhaps · the next; and ] dare ſay, it  
would not be longer before the Americans  
would clamour for a ſupply of goods from  
England, for it is vain to think they can ſupply  
themſelves. The merchant might then put an  
advanced price upon his goods, and poſſibly be  
able to make his own terms; or if it ſhould be  
thought the goods would not bear an advanced  
price to indemnify him, it might be worth while  
for the government to agree with the merchants  
before hand to allow them a premium equivalent  
to the advance of their ſtock, and then the game  
would be over.  
  
I have wrote with freedom, in confidence of

though I have wrote nothing but what in my  
conſcience I think an American may upon juſt

But it may be ſaid, How can any new meaſures  
be taken without raiſing new diſturbaners? The  
manufacturers in England will riſe again and  
defeat the meaſures of government. This game,  
tis true, has been played once and ſucceeded,  
  
power of the colonies at any time to raiſe a re ·  
bellion in England, by refuſing to ſend for their  
manufactures. For my own part, I do not be-  
heve this. The merchants in England, and I  
don&#x27;t know but thoſe in London and Briſtol  
only, might always govern in this matter and  
  
  
now managed, the dealer here ſends to the mer-  
  
  
the Engliſh merchant puts a profit of 10 or  
more, probably 15 per cent. when he ſends them  
to his employer in America. The merchant is  
ſo jealous of foregoing this profit, that an Ame-  
rican trader cannot well purchaſe the goods he  
wants of the manufacturer; for ſhould the  
merchant know that the manufacturer had ſup-  
plied an American, he would take off no more
