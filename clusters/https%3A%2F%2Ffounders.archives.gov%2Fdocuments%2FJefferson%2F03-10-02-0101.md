 one of three great measures necessary to ensure us permanent prosperity. this preserves our peace. a 2d should enable us to meet any war, by adopting the report of the war department, for placing the force of the nation at effectual command; and a 3d should ensure resources of money by the suppression of all paper circulation during peace, and licensing that of the nation alone during war. the metallic medium of which we should be
