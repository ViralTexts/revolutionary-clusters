December 25, 1807.  
					  
					A rapid view was taken in our last paper of the nature and effects of the Embargo. As it is the strongest measure yet taken by the government, and from its very nature will be productive of interesting consequences not only on the foreign world, but  
						likewise on ourselves, it is of the first importance that the public should receive correct impressions upon it. For a time it will materially reduce the price of our produce, &amp; enhance that of many foreign commodities. The latter circumstance will operate as some  
						indemnity to our merchants for the suspension of their business; the former will, in a considerable degree, affect the interests of the farmer and planter. Fortunately, in this country it is the latter class of citizens, who, from their numbers as well as their wealth, are  
						the most able to bear a pressure. The season at which the embargo is laid is favorable to them. They will already have supplied themselves with most of the goods they will want for the ensuing winter, the crops of the last autumn will to a great extent have already found a  
						market, and the principal exertions requisite for the next harvest will not be called for until the ensuing spring. This will alleviate, though it certainly will not supersede the effects of the measure. There will still remain occasion for much fortitude, perhaps for great  
						patience.  
					Is the state of our affairs such as requires this sacrifice? Might not a resort to milder measures do as well? We confidently answer no; not only for the reasons assigned in our last, but for other reasons.  
					A crisis has arrived, that calls for some decided step. The national spirit is up. That spirit is invaluable. In case of a war it is to lead us to conquest. By the vigor with which it shall wield the physical force of the country, it is to inspire us with  
						unshaken confidence in our strength, and to appal our enemy. In our solemn appeal to the world, it is to silence forever the idle hope that flatters itself with the phantom, either that we are a divided people, or that our republican institutions have not energy enough to  
						defend us, much less to inflict serious injury on our enemies. To dispel this illusion, in such an event there must cease to exist an inch of British ground on this continent.  
					The people having shewn their spirit, the season has arrived for the government to sustain, second and direct it. To delay any longer to do this would be to jeopardize its existence. The crisis not requiring war, still hoping, if not expecting peace, an  
						embargo is the next best measure for maintaining the national tone. It will arm the nation. It will do more. It will arm the Executive government. It is an unequivocal, and efficient expression of confidence in the Executive; and gives the President a new weapon of  
						negociation. We say weapon of negociation, for, in the present state of the world, even negociation has ceased to be pacific. Without being backed by force it is an empty sound.  
					The embargo furnishes this weapon. The sword is not drawn from the scabbard, but it may be drawn at a moment’s warning. By it, every member of the community will be sensibly impressed with the solemnity of the crisis, and will be prepared for events. The  
						public will be impatient for a decision of the great interests depending. All will be anxious for a restoration of their ordinary pursuits. Our negociator will be armed with the public sensibility. He will be constrained to require a definitive answer, and the whole nation  
						will call upon him with one voice to require that this answer be prompt. The negociant of a foreign nation, if his instructions be amicable, will himself perceive the necessity of a prompt and candid answer, and give it; and if hostile, the sooner the truth comes out the  
						better.  
					This is exactly the result so long impatiently expected by the nation, a result, whose further protraction might be ruinous to our interests and derogatory to our character.  
					There are those who suppose that this step will be productive of incalculable commercial losses. It will certainly produce much inconvenience to the mercantile world. But it will not be unaccompanied with benefit. It will separate the wheat from the chaff.  
						It will coerce the settlement of long standing and complicated accounts. The merchant, who has been fraudulently trading on another’s capital, may sink. And will not this be just? Is the man who, at such a moment, when all our resources ought to be carefully husbanded for the  
						day of danger, is base enough to risque not his own property, for he has none to risque, but that of another more cautious than himself, and that too which if lost is so much lost to the nation, and so much gained by our enemy? Can any legal measure be too strong for such a  
						man; one, who to personal dishonesty adds a total destitution of patriotism; one, who to promote his own interest, can behold with indifference the wreck of his friend’s fortune, and the disgrace or ruin of his country? If there is in the United States such a class of men,  
						the sooner they are called to account the better, and the sooner they are arrested in their injustice the happier for the honest part of the community. As to the solid, honest traders, it is a fact that the greater part of them have long contemplated the lowering aspect of  
						the horizon, and have wisely and honorably, by withdrawing their property from the ocean, determined to await the issue of events. This body of men, and we hope it includes a great majority of our merchants, will approve the embargo.  
					We believe it will be a popular measure with all classes. We are certain that the farmer, the planter and the mechanic will approve it from the security it offers to the public interests; and if the merchants be as honest and enlightened, as we trust they  
						are, they will perceive the indissoluble connection between their solid and permanent prosperity and the general welfare. Facts too attest the general expectation that this measure would be resorted to by the government; no sooner was the late news received than the public  
						prints of different political characters and in different parts of the union demanded an embargo; and no sooner were the doors of Congress closed, than it became the universal impression that this measure was about to be taken. In proof of this take the following extract from  
						the Gazette of the United States, a paper decidedly federal, of the 21st inst.  
					&quot;This is, therefore, no time to stand upon punctilio, or to adopt provoking and enfeebling regulations. The necessity of the case points out its remedy. We have it in our hands. Let an embargo be laid upon all our shipping, till they can venture out with a  
						chance of safety. Who knows but that both our enemies (for such I reckon them both) would then agree to except us from their tyrannical interdicts, for the general benefit of indirect communication; and that mutual privilege be thus obtained, by fair means, which we are  
						utterly incompetent to force.&quot;  
					&quot;An embargo is a measure that will give the government an opportunity of feeling the pulse of the people, before they commit themselves; and that will manifest our determination not to submit to every belligerent imposition as unequivocally as our boldest

A rapid view was taken in nur last paper of thp  
nature and effects of tbe embargo. As it is the  
strongest measure yet taken by the government, and  
from Us very nature will be productive of interest­  
ing consequences not only on the foreign world, hut  
likewise on ourselves, it is of the first importance  
that the publick should receive correct impressions  
upon it. For a time it will materially reduce the  
price of our produce, and enhance that ol many fo  
reign commodities. The latter circumstance will  
operate as some indemnity to our merchants lor the  
suspension of their business : the former will, in a  
considerable degree, affect the interests of the far­  
mer and planter. Fortunately, in this country it is  
the latter class of citizens, who from their numbers  
as well as their wealth are the most able to bear a  
pressure. The season at which the embargo is laid,  
is favourable to them. They will already have sup­  
plied themselves with most of tbe goods they will  
want for the ensuing winter, the crops of the autumn  
will, to a great extent have already found a market,  
and the principal exertions requisite for the next  
harvest will not be called lor until theensuingspring.  
This will alleviate, though it certainly will not su­  
persede the effects of the measure. There will still  
remain occasion for much fortitude, perhaps for  
great patience.  
Is the state of our affairs such -as requires this sa­  
crifice? Might not a resort to milder measures do  
as well ? We confidently answer no ; not only for  
the reasons assigned in our last, but for other.rea­  
sons.  
A crisis has arrived, that calls for some decided  
step. The national spirit is up. That spirit is in­  
valuable. In case of a war it is to lead us to con  
quest. Ily vigor with which it shall wield the phy­  
sical force of the country, it is to inspire us with  
unshaken confidence in our strength, and to appal  
our enemy. In our solemn appeal to the world, it is  
to silence, forever the idle hope that flatters itself  
with the phantom, either that we are a divided peo­  
ple, or that our republican institutions have not e­  
nergy enough to defend us, much less to inflict seri­  
ous injury on our enemies. To dispel this illusion,  
in such an event there must cease to exist an inch I  
  
of British ground on this continent.  
The people having shewn their spirit, the season !  
has arrived tor the government to sustain, seromi j  
and direct it. To delay any longer to do this would  
he to jeopardize its existence. The crisis not re- j  
quiring war, still hoping, if not expecting peace, an I  
embargo is the next best measure for maintaining  
the national tone. It will do more. It will arm  
the executive government. It is an unequivocal,  
and efficient expression of confidence in the execu­  
tive ; and gives the president anew weapon of negn­  
ciation — we say vtapon of negociatiou, for, in the  
present state of the world, even negotiation has  
ceased to he pacific. Without being backed by  
force it is an empty sound.  
The embargo furnishes this weapon. The sword  
is not drawn from the scabbard, but it may be  
drawn at a moment’s warning. By it, every mem­  
ber of the community will he sensibly impressed  
with the solemnity of the crisis, and will be piepar­  
ed for events. The publick will be impatient for a  
decision of the great interests depending.&#x27; All will  
be anxious for a restoration of their ordinary pui­  
suits. Our negociator will be armed with the pub­  
lick sensibility. He will be constrained to require a  
definitive answer, and the whole nation will call up­  
on him with one voice to require that this answer  
be prompt. The negociator of a foreign nation, if  
his instructions be amicable, will himself perceive  
the necessity of a prompt and candid answer, and  
give it; and if hostile, the sooner the truth comes  
out the better.  
This is exactly the result ro long impatiently ex­  
pected by the nation, a result, whose further pro­  
traction might be ruinous to our interests and dero­  
gatory to our character. •  
There are those who suppose that this step will  
be productive of incalculable commercial losses. It  
will certainly produce much incouvenience to the  
mercantile world. But it will not be unaccompani­  
ed with benefits. It will separate the wheat from  
the chaff. It will coerce the settlement of long  
stauding and complicated accounts. The merchant,  
who has been fraudulently trading on another’s capi­  
tal, mgy sink. And will not this be just ? Is the  
■&#x27;«. :.r. ■■■ &gt;-. - V- &quot;, ■ ir - ■ ... \ . .•  
  
man an object of commiseration who, at surh a mo­  
ment, when all our lesminvs,ought to he carefully  
husbanded for the day of danger, is base enough to  
risque, not his own pmpeity, for he has none to  
risque, but that of another more cautious than hint­  
self, and thyt too, whiiJi if lost, is ,so much hist to  
the nation, and so much gained hy our enemy?  
Can any measures he too strong lor such &lt;1 man  
•one, who to personal dishonesty acids a totj destitu­  
tion ol patriotism; one, who to promote his own  
interest, can hello’d with indifference the wie.&#x27;k of  
his Iriends fortune, and the disgrace or ruin of his  
country ? If there is in the United States such a  
closs of men, the sooner that they are called to ac­  
count the better, and the sooner that they are arrest­  
ed in their injustice the happier for the honest part  
ot the community. As to the solid, honest trader^,  
it is a lact that the greater part of them have lon^  
contemplated the lowering aspect of the horizon, and  
have wisely and honourably, by withdrawing their  
property from the ocean, determined to await the is­  
sue of events. This body of men, and we hope it  
includes a great majority of our merchants, will ao­  
piuve the embargo.  
We believe it will be a popular measure with all  
classes. \\ e are certain that the farmer, the plant­  
er and the mecbauick will approve it from the secu­  
rity it offers to the publick interests ; and if the mer­  
chants Le as honest and enlightened, as we trust they  
are, they will perceive the indissoluble connexion  
between their solid and permanent prosperity and  
the general welfare. Facts too attest the general  
expectation that this measure would be resorted tp  
by the government ; no sooner was the late news re­  
ceived than the publick prints of different political  
characters and in different parts of the union de­  
manded an embargo; and no sooner were the doors  
of congress closed, than it became the universal  
impression that this measure was about to betaken.  
In proof of tins take the following extract from the  
Gazette of the United Stales, a paper decidedly fe­  
dcnii, of the 21st inst.  
  
i u.s is, mei.iore, no ume to stand upon punc­  
tilio, or to adopt provoking and enfeebling regulati­  
ons. Ihe necessity oi the rase points out its reme­  
dy. We have it in our hands. Let an embargo be  
laid upon nil our shipping, till they ran venture out  
with saiety. Who knows hut that both our ene­

except us from their tyrannical interdicts, for the  
general benefits of indirect communication ; and  
that mutual privilege l.e thus obtained, by fair means  
which we ate utterly incompetent to force.” ’  
“ &#x27;\n embargo is a measure that will give the go­

will manifest our determination not to submit to

That anirit is invaluable.. Itrt use of a wai  
it is to lead us to conquest. liv the vigor  
with which it shall wield the physic*’force  
of the country, it is to inspire us with un­  
shaken confidence in our strength, nnd to  
appal our enemy. Ia our solemn appeal  
to the world, it is to silence forever the  
idle hope that flatters itself with the phan­  
tom, cither that we arc a divided people,  
or that our republican institution* have  
not energy enough to defend us, much Jess  
to inflict serious injury, on our enemies. To  
dispel this illusion, in such an event there  
must cease to exist an ineb of British  
ground on this continent.  
The people having shewn their spirit,  
the season has arrived for the government  
to sustain, second and direct it. To delay  
any longer to do this would be to jeopaiv  
diae its existence. The crisis not requir­  
ing war, still hoping, if not expecting  
peace, an embargo is the next best mea­  
sure for maintaining the national tone. Ii  
will arm the nation It will do more. It  
will arm the Executive government. It is  
an unequivocal, and efficient expression ot  
confidence in tiie Executive; and gives  
the President a new weapon of negotiation  
— we say weafioti of negotiation, for, in the  
present state of the world, even negnem­  
tion has ceased to be pacific. VVuheu;  
being backed by force it is an emptY  
sound.  
The embargo furnishes this weapon.—  
The nvord is not drawn from the sr«b­  
hard, hut it may be drawn at a moment’s  
warning. By &#x27;k, every member of the  
community will he sensibly impressed with  
the solemnity of the crisis, nnd will lie  
prepared for events. The public will be  
impatient for a decision of the great int« - I  
rests depending.&#x27; All will he anxious for a  
restoration o: tueir ordi&gt; pursuits. Our  
negotiator will be armed with the -public j  
sensibility. He will be constrained to re.  
quire a definitive answer, ai d the whole  
nation will call upon him with one voice to  
require that this answer be prompt. The  
  
nrgociant of a foreign na&#x27;ioh, it his in­  
structions be amicable, w || himself per­  
ceive tne mcnsity of a pr unpt and candid  
answer, and give it ; and »f hostile, the  
sooner the truth comes out the better.  
This is exactly the resu&#x27;t so long impa­  
tiently expected by the n it ion, a result,  
whose further protra* -ion nr ieht be ruin­  
ous to our interests and derogatory to our  
chn ractcr.  
There are tit &gt;se who suppose-that this  
step will be productive of incalculable  
comm* rci d ioss«s. 1 will certainly pro­

wheat from the chnff It will coerce the  
settlement of long standing ancfcomp!icat­  
ed accounts. The merchant, who has been  
fraudulently trading on another’s capital,  
may sink. And will not this be just ? Is  
the roan an object of commiseration who, &#x27;  
at such a moment, when all our resources  
ought to be carefully husbanded for the  
day of danger, is base enough to risque not  
his own propeny, for Up has none to risque,  
but that of another more cautious than  
himself, and that ton, which if lost, is so  
much lost to the natimi. and so much gain­  
ed by our enemy ? Can any legal measure  
be too slicing for such a mp.n ; one, who to  
personal dishonesty adds a’total destitution  
of patriotism ; one, who to promote his  
own inheres*, cmj behold with indifference  
the wreck of his friend’s fortune, and the  
disgrace or ruincf his country ! If there is  
in the United States such a class of men,  
the sooner they are called to account the  
better, and the sooner they are arrested in  
their injustice the happier for the honest  
part of the comrrnnitv. As to the solid,  
honest t’-ub rs, it is a&#x27;fict that the greater

EMBARGO.  
A rapid view was taken in our last  
paper of the nature and effeds of the  
Embargo. Asitis the ffrongelt mea­  
sure yer taken by the government,  
and from its very nature will be ;o­  
ductive of interefling - conlequences,  
not only on the foreign &#x27;world, but  
likewise on ourselves, it is of the firft  
irnportaace that the public should re­  
ceive corre@ impreflions uponit. For  
a time it ‘will materially reduce the  
price of our produce, and enhance  
that of many fereign commodities. The  
latter circumitance will operate as  
some indemnity to our metchants, for  
the suspension of their business ; the  
former will, in 2 considerable degree,  
“asset the intereflts of the farmer and  
- planter. , Fortunately, in this country  
it is the latter class of citizens, who,  
from their sumbers as well as wealth;  
are the molt able to bear a preflure.  
&#x27;he season at which the embargo is  
laid is favorable to them. They will  
already have supplied themselves with  
most of the goods shey want for the  
ensuing winter ; the crops of the lait  
_ autamn, will, to a great extent; have  
already found a marker, and the prin­  
“cipal exertions necessary for the next  
“harvelt will not be called for until the  
enfaing {pring.——This will alleviate,  
‘tho’ it will not certainly fupercede the  
~ effa&amp;s of thie meafuress There wili will

on this continent.  
_ The people having {hewn tkeir (pir­  
it, the fealon has arrived fer the gov­  
_erament to fultain, second #nd direct it:  
To delay any longer to do this would  
b2%0 jeopardize its exiffnce. The cri­  
sis not requiring war, il hoping, if not  
expelting peace, an embargo is the next  
befi meafare for maintaining the nation­

&#x27;:;ﬁm’é&#x27;d more. It will arm the Ixec­  
utive government. It is an uncquivo­  
cal, an efficient exprefiion of confidence  
in the Executive ; and gives the Presi­  
dent a new weapon of negociation—we  
fay awzzpom of vegocation, for, in the  
‘Qrefert {tate of the world, even negoci­  
ation has cealed to be pacilic. With­  
ont being backed by force it is an en:p­  
ty found. _  
1 The embargo furnithes thi weapon. The  
sword is nat drawn from the scabbard, but it  
may bedrawa at a moment’s warning, By it;  
every member of the community will be fen­  
fibjly imprefled with the felemoity of the crisis,  
and will be prepared for events. The public  
will be impaticot for ‘a decision of the great  
interefls dcpending Al will he anxious for a  
restoration of their ordinary pursuits. Our  
negociator will be armed with the pulilic fen­  
fibiity. He will be constrained to require a  
definitive answer, and the whole nation wilk  
call upon him with one voice to reguire that  
this answer be prompt.. &#x27;The negociant of a  
foreigit nation, if his inftru®ions be amicable,  
will himielf perceive the neceility of a prompt  
and candid answer and give it; and if hoflile,  
the sooner the truth comes out the better.  
This is exaétly the result so lony impatient­  
ly expected by the nation, a result, whole furs  
ther protraction might be ruinous to our ia-.  
terefts and derogatory to our chara&amp;er.  
There 2re those who {uppofe that this tep  
will be produétive of incalcuiable commercial  
losses. It will certainly producg much incon­  
venience tothe mercantile world, But it will  
Le not unaccompanied with benefir. It willk  
fepavate the wheat&#x27; from the chaff. It will  
coerce the fertlement of long standing and  
complicated accounts. The merchant, whe  
has befn fraudulently trading on another’s  
capital, may fink: And will not this be ju(t 2  
Is the man an Obje&amp; of commiseration who,  
at such a moment, when all our resources  
ought to be carefully huifbanded for the day  
of danger, is base enough to rifque not his  
own property, for he has none to rifque, but  
that of another more cauvtious than himfelf,  
and that too which if loft is so mnch loft to  
the nation, and fo&#x27; much gained by our enc­  
my ? Can any legal measure be too strong for  
such a man 3 ove, who to personal dishonesty  
adds a total deftitutiuvn of patriotiim ; onc,  
who to promote his own intcreft, can bebold  
with indifference the wreck of his friend’s for­  
tune, and the disgrace or ruin of his country 2  
If there is in the United States such a class of  
men, the sooner they are called to acconnt the  
better, and the fooncr they are arrclted in  
their injustice the happicr for the honest part  
of the community, As to the solid, honest  
traders, it is a fact that the greater part of  
them have long contemplated the lowering  
aspect of the horizon, and have wifely and  
hcnorably, by withdrawing their property  
from the ocean, determined to await the iflue  
of events. This body of men,and we hope it  
inciudes a great majority of our merchaats,  
will approve the embargo.  
We believe it will be a popular measure  
with all classes, - We are certain that the far­  
mer, the planter and the mechanic will ap­  
prove it from the security it offers to the pub­  
lic interests ; and if the merchants be as hoa­  
eft and enlightened, as we trust they are, they  
will perceive the indissoluble connection be­  
tween their solid and permancnt prosperity  
and the general welfare. Taéls too attelt the  
general expectation that this measure would  
be resorted to by the government ; no sooner  
was the late news received than the public  
prints of different political charac&amp;ers and in  
different parts of the union demanded an em­  
bargo ; and no sooner were the doots of Con­  
“grefs closed, than it became the universal ime­  
‘preflion that this measure was about to be  
_taken. In proof of this take the following  
extraét from the Qazette of the United States,  
&amp; paper decidedly federal, of the 21t inst.  
« This is&#x27;thercfore, no time to stand upon  
pundilio, or to adopt provoking and enfech-  
Jing regulations. The neceflity of the vafle  
points out its remedy. We bave 1t 1a our  
hands. Let an embargo be laid u,pon_a“ our  
shipping, till they cau venturé ;out with z
