re not too strong, and that we have almost ceased to hope. The Country in general is in such a state of insensibility and indifference to its interest, that I dare not flatter myself with any change for the better.  
The Committee of Congress in their late address to the several States have given ajust picture of our situation. I very much doubt its making the desired impression, and if it does not I shall consider our lethargy as incurable—The present juncture is so interesting that if it does not produce corrispondent exertions, it will be a proof that motives of honor public good &amp; even self preservation have lost their influence upon our minds—This is a decisive moment—one of the most (I will go further &amp; say the most) important America has seen. The Court of France has made a glorious effort for our deliverance, and if we disappoint its intentions by our supineness we must become contemptible in the eyes of all Mankind; nor can we after that venture to confide that our Allies will persist in an attempt to establish what it will appear we want inclination or ability to assist them in.  
Every view of our own circumstances ought to determine us to the most vigorous efforts; but there are considerations of another kind that should have equal weight—The combined fleets of France &amp; Spain last year were greatly superior to those of the enemy—The enemy nevertheless sustained no material damage &amp; at the close of the Campaign have given a very important blow to our Allies—This Campaign the difference between the fleets from every account I have been able to collect will be very inconsiderable—indeed it is far from clear that there will not be an equality—What are we to expect will be the case if there should be another Campaign? In all probability the advantage will be on the side of the English, and then what will become of America? We ought not to deceive ourselves. The Maratime resources of Great Britain are more substantial and real than those of France &amp; Spain united—Her commerce is more extensive than that of both her rivals; and it is an axiom that the Nation which has the most extensive commerce will always have the most powerful Marine—Were these arguments less convincing the fact speaks for itself—her progress in the course of the last year is an incontestible proof.  
It is true France in a manner created a Fleet in a very short space &amp; this may mislead us in the judgment we form of her naval abilities. But if they bore any comparison with those of Great Britain how comes it to pass that with all the force of Spain added she has lost so much ground in so short a time, as now to have scarcely a superiority. We should  
  
consider what was done by France as a violent and unnatural effort of the government which for want of sufficient foundation cannot continue to operate proportionable effects.  
In modern Wars the longest purse must chiefly determine the event—I fear that of the enemy will be found to be so—though the Government is deeply in debt &amp; of course poor, the nation is rich and their riches afford a fund wch will not be easily exhausted. Besides, their system of public credit is such that it is capable of greater exertions than that of any other nation—Speculatists have been a long time foretelling its downfall, but we see no Symptoms of the catastrophe being very near. I am perswaded it will at least last out the War, and then in the opinion of many of the best politicians it will be a national advantage. If the War should terminate successfully the crown will have acquired such influence &amp; power that it may attempt any thing—and a bankruptcy will probably be made the ladder to climb to absolute authority. Administration may perhaps wish to drive matters to this issue—at any rate they will not be restrained by an apprehension of it from forcing the resources of the state. It will promote their present purposes on which their all is at stake and it may pave the way to triumph more effectually over the constitution. With this disposition I have no doubt that ample means will be found to prosecute the war with the greatest vigor.  
France is in a very different position. The abilities of her present financier has done wonders—By a wise administration of the revenues aided by advantageous loans he has avoided the necessity of additional taxes. But I am well informed—if the War continues another Campaign he will be obliged to have recourse to the taxes usual in time of War which are very heavy—and which the people of France are not in condition to indure for any duration. When this necessity commences France makes war on ruinous terms; and England from her individual wealth will find much greater facility in supplying her exigencies.  
Spain derives great wealth from her mines, but not so great as is generally imagined—Of late years the profit to government is essentially diminished—Commerce and industry are the best means of a Nation; both which are wanting to her—I am told her treasury is far from being so well filled as we have flattered ourselves—She [is] also much divided on the propriety of the War—there is a strong party against it—The temper of the Nation is too sluggish to admit of great exertions—and though the Courts of the two Kingdoms are closely linked together, there never has been in any of their Wars a perfect harmony of Measures, nor has it been the case in this; which has already been no small detriment to the common cause.  
I mention these things to shew that the circumstances of our allies as well as our own call for peace; to obtain which we must make one  
  
great effort this Campaign. The present instance of the friendship of the Court of France is attended with every circumstance that can render it important and agreeable; that can interest our gratitude or fire our emulation. If we do our duty we may even hope to make the campaign decisive on this Continent. But we must do our duty in earnest—or disgrace &amp; ruin will attend us—I am sincere in declaring a full perswasion, that the succour will be fatal to us, if our measures are not adequate to the emergency.  
Now my dear Sir I must observe to you, that much will depend on the State of Pensylvania—She has it in her power to contribute without comparison more to our success than any other State; in the two essential articles of flour and transportation. New York, Jersey Pensylvania and Maryland are our flour Countries: Virginia went little on this article the last Crop (&amp; her resources are called for to the Southward)—New York by Legislative coercion has already given all she could spare for the use of the Army—Her inhabitants are left with scarcely a sufficiency for their own subsistence—Jersey from being so long the place of the armys residence is equally exhausted—Maryland has made great exertions; but she can still do something more—Delaware may contribute handsomely in proportion to her extent—But Pensylv⟨a⟩nia is our chief dependence—From every information I can obtain, she is at this time full of flour

“ Every view of our own circumstan­  
ces ought to determine us to the most  
vigorous efforts ; But there arc conside­  
rations of another kind that should have  
  
| equal weight. The combined Seem of  
j France and Spain, laat year were greatly  
superior to those of the enemy j the ene­  
mv nevertheless sustained no material  
&#x27; damage, and at the dose of the campaign  
gave a very important blow to our allies.  
! t his campaign, the difference between  
the fleets, from every account I have  
been able to collect, will be considerable :  
indeed it is far from clear, that there  
will be an equality. What are we to ex­  
pect will be the case if there should be  
another campaign 1 In all probability the  
advantage would be ou the side of the  
English, and then what would become  
of America? we ought not to deceive  
ourselves. The maratime resources of  
Great Britain arc more substantial and  
real than those of France and Spain uni6  
ed. Her commerce is more extensive  
than that of both lie r rivals ; and it is an  
axiom, that the nation which has the  
most extensive commerce will always  
have the most powerful marine. Were  
this argument l&lt;-ss convincive, the fact  
speaks for itself { her progress in the  
course of the last year is an incontestible  
proof.  
“ It is true, France, in a manner, cre­  
ated s fleet in a very short space; and  
this may mislead us in the judgment we  
, form of her naval abilities. But If they  
bear any comparison with those of Great  
Britain, how comes it to pass, that with  
all the force of Spain added, she has lost  
so much ground in so short a time, as  
now to have scarcely a superiority. We  
should consider what was done by France  
as a violent and unnatural effort of the  
government; which, for want of a suffi­  
cient foundation, cannot continue to o&gt;  
perate proportional effects.  
“ In modern wars, the longest purse  
most chiefly determines the event. I  
fear that of the enemy will be found to he  
so. Though the government is deeply  
in debt, and of course, poor, the nati­

culates have been a long time foretell­  
ing jts downfallj but we see no symp­  
toms of the catastrophe being very near.  
I am persuaded it will at least last out the  
war.  
“ France is in a very different positi­  
on. The abilities of die present finan­  
cier have done wonders s by a wise ad­  
ministration of the resoiycea. aided by  
I advantageous loans he has avoided the  
necessity of additional taxes. But I am  
well informed, if the war continues ano­  
, thcr campaign, he will be obliged ta have  
recourse to the taxes usual in time of  
nar, which arc very heavy, and which  
the pr&#x27;.&#x27;pL: of France are not in a conditi­  
onrncndureforanylengthoftime. When  
this necessity commences, France makes  
war on ruinous terms, aud England from  
her individual wealth, will find much  
greater facility in supplying her exigen­  
cies.  
“ Spain derives great wealth from her  
mines, but it is not so great as is gene­  
rally imagined. Of late years the profit  
to government is essentially diminished.  
Commerce and industry are the best  
means of a nation ; both which are want­  
•d by her. I am told her treasury is for  
from being so well filled as we have flat-&#x27;:  
tered ourselves. She is also much diva- j  
ded on the propriety of the war. There  
is a strong party against it. The tem­  
per of the nation is too sluggish to admit  
of great exertions; and though the courts  
of the two kingdoms are closely linked  
together, there never has been in any of  
tfieir wan, a perfect harmony of mea­  
sures ; nor has it been the case in this ;  
which has already been ao small detri­  
ment to the common cause.

“resources of Great Britain are more

“ tion, the abilities of her present finan-  
“‘cier has done wonders—By a wise

“ by advantageous loans he has avoided  
‘all the necessity of additional taxes—  
“But Iam well informed—if the War  
“continues another Campaign he will  
“be obliged to have recourse to the  
“Taxes usual in time of War, which  
“ are very heavy—and which the people  
“in France are not in a condition to  
“endure for any duration—When this  
“necessity commences, France makes  
“war on ruinous terms; and England  
“from her individual wealth will find  
“much greater facilities in supplying  
“her exigencies ” ,  
  
“ Spain derives great wealth from her  
  
“ mines but not so great as is generally  
“imagined, of late years the profit to  
“ Governmt is essentially diminished—  
“ Commerce and industry are the best  
“ Mines of a Nation; both which are  
“ wanting to her—I am told her treas-  
“ ury is far from being so well filled as  
“ we have flattered ourselves She also  
“is much divided on the propriety of  
“the War—there is a strong party  
“ against it. The temper of the nation  
“ is too sluggish to admit of great exer-  
“ tion—&amp; though the Courts of the two  
“ Kingdoms are closely linked together;  
“ there never has been in any of their  
“wars a perfect harmony of measures  
“nor has it been in this; which has  
“already been no small detriment to  
“ the common cause  
  
“‘T mention these things to shew that  
“ the circumstances of our allies as well  
“ as our own, call for Peace; to obtain  
“ which we must make one great effort  
“this Campaign. The present instance  
“of the friendship of the Court of  
“ France is attended with every circum-  
“stance that can render it important  
“and agreeable that can interest our  
“ gratitude, or fire our emulation—If we  
‘do our duty we may even hope to  
“ make the Campaign decisive on this  
“Continent. But we must do our duty  
“ in Earnest—or disgrace and ruin will  
“ attend us—I am sincere in declaring a  
“full persuasion that the succour will
