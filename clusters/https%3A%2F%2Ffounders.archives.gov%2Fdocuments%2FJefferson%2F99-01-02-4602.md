28 November 1806  
  
  
At a meeting of the Democratic Citizens  
in the State of Pennsylvania, held in the house of Samuel  
Patterson on Friday the 28th. of November 1806. P.M. For the purpose of taking into Consideration the propriety of Joining  
our fellow Citizens in forwarding an address to the President of the United States—Inviting Him again to suffer his Name  
to be Run as a candidate for President, at the Next Presidential Election.  
First. “Let it be remembered finally, that it has ever been the pride and boast of America, that the Rights  
for which she contended were the Rights of human Nature. By the blessings of the Auther of these Rights on the means  
exerted for their defence, they have prevailed against all Opposition, and form the basis, of seventeen Independent  
States. No Instance has heretofore Occured, nor can any instance be expected hereafter to Occur, in which the  
unaddulterated forms of republican Governments can pretend to so fair an opportunity of Justifying themselves by their  
fruits. In this View the Citizens of the United States are responsible for the greatest trust ever confided to a political  
society. If Justice, good faith, honour, gratitude, and all the other qualities, which enable the character of a Nation,  
and fulfill the ends of government, be the fruits of our establishments, the Cause of Liberty will Acquire a dignity and  
lustre, which it has never yet enjoyed, and an example will be set, which Cannot but have the most favourable influence on  
the Rights of mankind. If on the other side our governments should be unfortunately blotted, with the Reverse of these  
Cardinal and essential Vertices; the great Cause which we have engaged to vindicate, will be dishonoured and betrayed; the  
last and fairest experiment in favour of the rights of human Nature will be turned against them, and their Patrons and  
friends exposed to be insulted and silenced by the Votaries of tyranny and Usurpation.”  
Therefore Wisdum, Justice, Patriotism and sound pollicy ought ever to be alive, and fully a wake, among those  
Appointed to, and intrusted with the high powers of government; as well as among those out of whom the Choice

and boast of America that the Rights for which she  
sended, were the a ghis of Human Nature. By the bl
