.  
A Winter’s Day.To Louisa.  
1.  
Friend of my bosom! wouldst thou know,  
How, far from thee, the days I spend?  
And how the passing moments flow?  
To this short, simple tale attend—  
When first emerging from the East  
The Sun-beam flashes on my curtain,  
I start, from slumbers ties releas’d  
And make the weather’s temper certain.  
2.  
Next, on the closet’s shelf I seek  
My pocket Homer, and compel  
The man of many wiles, in Greek,  
Again his fabled woes to tell.  
How true he paints the scenes of life!  
How sweet the Poet’s honest prattle!  
Far sweeter than fierce Ilium’s strife  
And never-ending fields of battle.  
3.  
At Nine, comes Moses to my door,  
And down stairs summons me, with ease;  
But on my neighbour calls before,  
And knocks,—“Miss Kitty—Breakfast—Please.”  
Again he louder knocks, and stronger;  
Till Kitty answers—“coming, Moses.”  
And then, in half an hour or longer;  
Comes Kitty, just as breakfast closes.  
4.  
Then forth I sally for the day;  
And musing Politicks or Rhyme,  
Take to the Capitol my way,  
To join in colloquy sublime.  
There, with the Fathers of the Land  
I mix in sage deliberation;  
And lend my feeble voice and hand  
With equal Laws to bless the Nation.  
5.  
The labours of the Senate o’er,  
Again with solitary pace,  
Down to Potowmac’s glassy floor,  
My Morning footsteps I retrace.  
And oft, dejected or elate,  
With painful, or with pleas’d reflection,  
In thought, renew the day’s debate,  
And canvass votes by retrospection.  
6.  
At home, I find the table spread;  
And dinner’s fragrant steams invite:  
But first the two-fold Stairs, I tread  
My atmospheric tale to write—  
Then, seated round the social board  
We feast, till absent friends are toasted—  
Though sometimes my delays afford  
The beef or mutton over-roasted.  
7.  
In bounces Johnson from his school,  
A dog’s ear’d Webster in his hand—  
Repeats his daily-studied Rule,  
And next his mother takes his stand—  
With looks of pure maternal bliss  
Mama says—“John, wilt have an Apple?”  
And on his cheek imprints a kiss—  
His cheek, which rose and lily dapple.  
8.  
Soon, little Mary too they bring;  
And now, we practice every wile;  
And clap the hands, and laugh, and sing,  
To catch that Heaven, an infant’s smile.  
Meantime, an apple-paring, whirl’d  
Thrice round the head, with mystic ditty,  
And forthwith on the carpet hurl’d  
Foretells her future Lord to Kitty.  
9.  
As Eve approaches, I ascend,  
And hours of Solitude ensue—  
To public papers I attend,  
Or write, my bosom’s friend, to you.  
Gaze at the fire, with vacant stare,  
Suspended pen, and brow contracted;  
Or, starting, sudden from my chair,  
The chamber pace, like one distracted.  
10.  
I see the partner of my Soul,  
I hear my darling children play;  
Before me, fairy visions roll  
And steal me from myself away.  
Not long the dear delusions last—  
Not long these lovely forms surround me—  
Recover’d eyes too soon I cast,  
And all is Solitude around me.  
11.  
My heart, a short depression feels;  
And throwing straight aside my pen;  
I take the volume that reveals  
Their duties and their hopes to men—  
Yes! wherefore should I not confess,  
This book of sacred inspiration,  
Yields to my bosom in distress  
Both Fortitude and Consolation.  
12.  
Anon, the Supper’s bread and cheese  
Begins, with grave and solemn face;  
Till Silence, yielding by degrees,  
The festive Spirit takes its place.  
Good-Humour comes, with waggish mien  
And shakes his sides, with laughter hearty;  
And Satire’s face, is not unseen  
Reflected from the last Night’s party.  
13.  
At last, dispersing, we retire—  
Again, the glass’s state I learn—  
Then, for the Night compose my fire,  
And to my lonely Couch return.  
There—for my wife—my boys—my friends,  
Imploring blessings without number;  
E’en while the vow to Heaven ascends,  
My sense dissolves in peaceful slumber.  
14.  
Thus, in succession pass my days,  
While Time with flagging pinion flies;  
And still the promis’d hour delays,  
When thou shalt once more charm my eyes.  
Louisa! thus remote from thee  
Still something to each Joy is wanting;  
While thy affection can, to me  
Make the most dreary Scene enchanting

A WINTERS DAT: TO LOUISA.  
Friend of my bosom ! wouldst tbou know  
How, far from thee, the day I spend,  
And how the passing moments flow,  
To this short, simple tale attend :  
When first emerging from the East,  
The sunbeam flashes on my curtain,  
I start from slumber&#x27;s ties, released,  
And make the weather&#x27;s temper certain.  
Next on the closet&#x27;s shelf I seek

The man of many wiles, in Greek,  
Again bis many woes to tell.  
How trne he paints the scenes of life !  
How sweet the poet&#x27;s honest prattle 1  
Far sweeter than fierce Illium&#x27;s strife,  
And never-ending fields of battle.  
At nine, comes Moses to my door,  
And down stairs summons me with ease,  
But on mj neighbor calls before,  
And knocks, &quot; Miss Kitty 1 breakfast, pleeae!&#x27;&#x27;  
Again be louder knooks, and stronger,  
Till Kitty answers,&quot; Coming, Moses I&quot;  
And then, in half an honr or longer.  
Comes Kitty just as breakfast closes.  
Then forth I sally for the day,  
And, musing politics and rhyme,  
Take to the Capitol my way,  
To join in colloquy sublime.  
There with the fathers of tbe land,  
I mix in sage deliberation,  
And lend my feeble voice and hand  
With equal laws to bless the nation.  
The labors of tbe Senate o&#x27;er,  
Again with solitary pace,  
Down to Potomac&#x27;s glossy floor  
My morning&#x27;s footsteps I retrace.  
And oft, dejected or elate.  
With painful or with pleased reflection,  
In thought renew the day&#x27;s debate,  
And canvass votes for retrospection.  
At home I find the table spread,  
And dinner&#x27;s fragrant steams Invite;  
But first tbe two-fold stairs I tread,  
My atmospheric tale to write;  
Then, seated round the social board.  
We feast till absent friends are toasted,  
Though sometimes my delays afford  
The beef or mutton over-roasted.  
In bounces Johnson from bis school,  
A dog-eared Webster in his band;  
Repeats his daily studied rule,  
And next his mother takes bis stand.  
With looks of pure, maternal bliss,  
Mamma says, &quot; John, wilt have an apple?&quot;  
And on bis cheek imprints a kiss  
His cheek, which rose and hlly dapple.  
Soon little Mary, too, they bring;  
And now, we practice every wile,  
And clap our bands, and laugh and sing,  
To catch that heaven, an infant&#x27;s mile.  
Meantime, an apple-paring whirled  
Thrice round the he.id, with mystic ditty,  
&quot;And forthwith on the carpet hurled,  
Foretells her future Lord to Kitty !  
As eve approaches I ascend,  
And boursof solitude eBsue;  
To public papers I attend,  
Or write, my bosom friend, to you.  
Gaze at the fire witb vacant stare,  
Suspended pen, and brow contracted;  
Or, starting sudden from my chair,  
The chamber pace, like one distracted.  
I see the partner of my soul,  
1 bear my darling children play;  
Before me airy visions roll,  
And steal me from myself away.  
Not long tbe dear delusions last,

A WINTER&#x27;S t)AY AT WASHINGTON.  
Friend of my bosom, wouid*t thou know  
How, far from tliee, the days I spend,  
And how the passim; moments flow.  
To this shori, simple talc attend.  
When first emerging from the East  
The sunbeam fmi-hes on my enrtain,  
I start—from lumber&#x27;s tie.* released—  
j And make the weather&#x27;s temper certain.*  
Next, on my clnsetishclf, I seek  
My pocket Homer and compell  
Tiie &quot;&#x27;man of many woes,&#x27;, in Greek,  
Again hit&quot; fabled woes to tell.  
llow true he paints the sbanes of life !  
Tlow sweet the poet&#x27;s honest prajtle !  
i Far sweeter than the fierce Itlutn&#x27;s stnfe,  
And never ending scenes oj battle.  
At nine come* Moses to my door,  
And down stairs summons me with ease,  
But on my neighbor calls before  
And knocks, &quot;Miss Kitty, breakfast, please,&quot;  
Again he louder knocks and stronger,  
Till Citty ausweis &quot;coming. Motes.&quot;  
A ltd then, in half an housor longer,  
1 Comes Kitty, jest as breakfast closes.  
Then fourth I sally for the day,  
And, musii g politics or rhyme,  
Take to the Capitol mv way,  
To join in colloquy sublime.  
There with the father* of the land.  
I tnix in sage deliberatiou ;  
And lend my feeble voice and hand,  
With to bless the nation.  
The labor- of the Benate o&#x27;er,  
Again, with solitaiy pace,  
Down to Potomac&#x27;s giassy floor  
My morning footseps 1 retrace.  
And oft, dejee&#x27;ed or elate  
With painful or with pleased reflection,  
&#x27; In thought rt-iirw tl.e day debate,  
And can ran rotes for retrospection.  
&#x27; At home, I find the table spread,  
&#x27; And dinner&#x27;s fragrant steams invite ;  
t But first, the two fold stairs I tread  
My atmospheric taie to write.  
Then, seated round thp ocial board.  
We least till &quot;absent f:icnds&quot;&#x27; are masted ;  
Though sometimes ; my delay* afford  
The beef or mutton over roasted.  
In bounces Johnson from hi* school  
A dog&#x27;s ea-ed WebsterS in his hand,  
Repeats his daily studied ruic,  
And next his mother takes his stand.  
  
With lock of pure maternal bli**

And ciap the Kind-, and 1.-tugh and sing,  
To catch that heaven—an imam&#x27;s staiie.  
Meantime an apple paring whirled &#x27;  
Thrice round the head with mistic ditty,  
And forthwith on the fcnrpet hurled,  
Fo:ctella her future lord to Kitty.  
A* eve approaches, I ascend  
And hours of solitude ensue ;  
To nublic paper* 1 attend.  
Or write, my bosom friend to yon ;  
Gaz at the fire with vacant *tare,
