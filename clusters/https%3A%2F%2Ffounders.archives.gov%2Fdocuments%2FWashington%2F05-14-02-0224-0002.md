The River Potomack forms a junction with the Bay of Chesapeak 150 miles from the Sea.  
From thence to the head of tide-Water is about 160 miles.  
“This River is 7½ miles wide at its mouth; 4½ at Nomony Bay; 3 at Aquia; 1½ at  
Hollowing-Point; 1¼ at Alexandria—and the same from thence to the City of Washington,  
which is within 3 miles of the head of tide Water. It’s soundings are 7 fathoms at the  
mouth; 5 at St Georges Island; 4½ at Lower Matchodic; 3 at Swan’s Point—and the same  
from thence to the City.” (Mr Jeffersons Notes on Virginia)  
From the Capes of the Chesapeak to the City of Washington is upwards of 300 miles;  
but the navigation is easy and perfectly safe. [“]A vessel of 1200 Hogsheads of  
Tobacco has loaded at and sailed from Alexandria, and one of 700 at George Town—which  
is above the City.[“] [(]Report of Committee[)]  
At the City the water rises four feet in a common tide.  
From the City of Washington to Cumberland, a flourishing town at the head of the  
River, is about 230 miles as the River runs.  
Early in life General Washington contemplated the opening of this River from tide  
water to its source, so as to render it navigable for such vessels as were suitable  
for carrying the produce of the Country to the shipping ports below. His public  
employments in the part of the Country through which the Potomack and its branches  
run, had given him a more complete knowledge of this River than almost any other man  
possessed at that time and his mind was strongly impressed with its future importance.  
But the period for undertaking a work of such magnitude had not yet arrived. The  
Country was then but sparsely inhabited; Canals &amp; Locks but little understood,  
especially in America and but few men of property were willing to embark in an  
undertaking, the cost of which they could not clearly calculate, and the profits of  
which were to many doubtful. General Washington however kept the  
object steadily in view, waiting until time &amp; circumstances should enable him to  
bring it forward with a prospect of success. The war with Great Britain took place  
about the time when the importance of this object began to be understood and a  
willingness to embark in it began to appear among men of property. Until the close of  
that war nothing, however, could be attempted in the business. But no sooner had a  
happy termination of it enabled General Washington to retire from his high public  
station, than he resumed this object which had so long before occupied his mind. He  
found Gentlemen of the first property and respectability in the neighbourhood of the  
Potomack, both in Virginia &amp; Maryland, ready to engage in the enterprize. In the  
year 1784 a Company was formed for the purpose of removing the obstructions and  
opening the navigation of the River from its source down to Tide-Water—and an act of  
incorporation passed by the Assemblies of Virginia &amp; Maryland, authorizing the  
Company to take the necessary measures for carrying into effect the objects for which  
they were corporated—and granting to them forever the tolls  
which may arise therefrom; which tolls are fixed by the same law that empowers the  
Company to undertake the business. The sum agreed upon to complete the navigation was  
fifty thousand pounds sterling, divided into five hundred shares of one hundred pounds  
each, to be paid by such instalments and at such times as the Directors of the Company  
Shd find necessary for the prosecution of the work. Ten years were allowed to the  
Company to finish the business.  
The Company have prosecuted their work with great success; And, what is not common in  
undertakings of this nature, they will complete it for something less than the sum  
subscribed. The rate of toll being fixed, and knowing with some accuracy the quantity  
of produce that is now brought by land from those parts of the Country which will of  
course throw the same upon the River, they have a certainty of receiving a handsome  
per Centage on their Capital in the first opening of the River (even without  
calculating upon the articles which will be sent up the River)—and the increase will  
be almost incredible—Those who know the Circumstances of the Country best, and some  
who are not among the most sanguine with respect to the profits of this undertaking, have no doubt of the Capital’s producing fifty per Cent  
annually in less than ten years from the time of the Tolls commencing.  
The principal work in completing the above mentioned navigation is at the Great  
Falls, 14 miles above the City of Washington—at the Little Falls 4 miles above said  
City, and in clearing the River between these two falls. At the Great Falls the water  
falls 72 feet in one mile and an half—and at the Little Falls 36 feet 8 inches in  
about two miles. At the former there will be 6 and at the latter 3 locks. The Locks at  
the Little Falls will be finished this season and fit for use; those at the Great  
Falls are in forwardness—and with the clearing the bed of the River between the two  
Falls, will be completed next year. This will finish the navigation of the main River  
from Cumberland down to tide water, and enable the Company to receive the reward of  
their expense &amp; labour. Bateaux carrying from 150 to 200 barrels of flour already  
pass from Cumberland to the Great Falls—and many thousand barrels of flour have  
actually been brought in boats to the latter place during the present year.  
Besides the main River of the Potomack, its numerous &amp; extensive branches offer  
the prospect of transporting to the main River, and from thence to the Shipping ports,  
an immense quantity of produce.  
The following are the principal Streams which empty into the Potomack, above tide  
water, and the distances to which they are navigable in their natural state, from  
their conflux with the Potomack—Patterson’s Creek, which falls  
into the River ten miles below Cumberland, is navigable twenty miles above its mouth;  
The South Branch, seventeen miles below Cumberland, navigable  
one hundred miles; Cape Capeon, sixty miles below, is navigable twenty miles; Connocochegue, ninety miles below, is navigable twenty four  
miles; Opecan, one hundred &amp; twenty five miles below, is  
navigable twenty five miles from its mouth, and within a few miles of Winchester,  
which, after Lancaster, is the largest inland town in the United States; The Shannandoah, one hundred &amp; thirty miles below, runs into the  
Country at right angles from the Potomack near two hundred miles—and the navigation of  
it for one hundred &amp; fifty miles of that distance is but little interrupted: The  
chief obstru[c]tion is where it enters the Potomack, and so trifling is that compared  
with the great advantages of this noble branch, that its removal,  
and clearing other parts, will not cost more than twenty five thousand dollars. The  
Potomack Company have already made a beginning on this work. The Monocosy one hundred &amp; fifty miles below Cumberland, is navigable thirty  
miles above its mouth. This branch is within two miles of Frederick Town in Maryland,  
one of the largest inland towns in the United States.  
These several Streams as well as the main River, pass through a Country not exceded  
in fertility of soil and salubrity of air by any in America, if by any in the World.  
And no part of America can boast of being more healthy than the Potomack in  
general.  
The number of inhabitants living in the several counties of Virginia &amp; Maryland  
which touch upon the Potomack or its Branches, amount to upwards of three hundred  
thousand, according to the Census taken by order of the General Government in 1791.  
They are all, or so nearly so that not one fiftieth part can be excepted, Cultivators  
of the Soil. It is therefore easy to conceive that they must send an immense quantity  
of Produce to the Shipping ports on the River. But still so extensive is the Country  
through which the Potomack and its branches pass, that it is yet but thinly settled.  
Its inhabitants are however very rapidly increasing as well by imigration as by the  
natural course of population.  
The Productions of the Country consist of Wheat—Indian Corn or maize,  
Rye—Oats—Tobacco—Potatoes, Beans—Peas—and in short of every article that the best  
farming lands are capable of producing. Hemp &amp; Flax are cultivated here and yield  
large quantities. The Land is rich in pasturage—most parts of it admirably adapted to  
sheep—and a heavy growth of Timber fit for ship building, as well as for every other  
purpose, is found here. There is near Cumberland, and within 10 or 12 miles of the  
River, a tract of country that abounds with very large white pine trees suitable for  
masts of Ships: some of these trees are from 5 to 6 feet diameter and run up one  
hundred feet without a limb.  
Slate, Marble, Freestone of the red &amp; gray portland kind and Iron Ore are found  
in abundance on the Banks of the River. Several large Iron works are already  
established which furnish Bar Iron &amp; Castings of an excellent quality. Limestone  
abounds everywhere. Of coal too there is an inexhaustible quantity near Cumberland laying on the Banks of the River—and in other parts at no  
great distance from it; from whence in future not only all the towns and manufactories  
on the River may be supplied; but it will become a capital article of exportation.  
There is in the River a great plenty of very fine fish. Large quantities of shad and  
Herrings are annually taken here and exported to the West Indies.  
From the preceding observations it is easy to conceive that the Commerce of this  
River cannot be inconsiderable: And a single view of the Situation upon which the City  
of Washington is laid out, points out that spot as the most eligible on the River for  
a large commercial town.  
The City of Washington lays in Latitude 38_ 53’ it is situate on the East side of the  
Potomack about 4 miles from the head of tide water, and extends down the River nearly  
four miles, to an angle which is formed by the junction of the Eastern Branch with the  
Potomack; it then runs along the Eastern Branch for more than two miles. Its general  
width is about one mile and three qua⟨rters.⟩  
The Eastern Branch affords one of the finest harbours for Ships imaginable. It is  
more than a mile wide at its mouth, and holds nearly the same width for almost the  
whole distance to which the City extends upon it; it then narrows gradually to its  
head, which is about ten miles from its conflux with the Potomack. The Channel of this  
Branch lays on the side next the City; it has in all parts of it, as far as the City  
extends, from 20 to 35 feet of Water. Above the City it is only navigable for small  
craft. The Channel is generally so near the City that a wharf extended 40 or 50 feet  
from the Bank will have water enough for the largest Ships to come &amp; discharge or  
receive their Cargoes. The land on each side of the Branch is sufficiently high to  
secure shipping from any wind that blows. And one very important advantage which this  
Branch has, as a harbour, over all extensive Rivers which freeze and are liable to be  
broken up suddenly by freshes or land floods, is, that, on account of the short  
distance to which it extends into the land, no rapidity of current is ever occasioned  
by freshes; and while Vessels in the main River, if they should happen to be caught  
there by the ice, are liable to receive great injury, and are sometimes totally lost  
by it, those in the Branch lay in perfect security: it has also the advantage of being open some days earlier in the spring and later in the winter  
than the main River at George Town and the upper parts of the City. The River  
generally shuts up about Christmas and is open again the latter part of february or  
very early in March. Sometimes there are only short interruptions by ice through the  
winter—and sometimes it happens that it is not closed so as to prevent the navigation  
during the winter. This was the case last winter.  
The main Channel of the Potomack opposite the City, running near the Virginia Shore,  
that part of the City which lays on the Potomack has only a small Channel carrying  
from 8 to 12 feet of water, until you come within about _ of a mile of George Town,  
when the Channel turning between Mason’s Island and the City, gives a depth of water  
from 20 to 30 feet close in with the shore of the City. This renders the water lots  
within that small space very valuable; for any ships that come up the River may here  
lay within twenty yards of the City; and the Bateaux which bring the produce of the  
Country down the River may at all times come here deep loaded as the⟨y⟩ come down,  
whereas they could not go thus loaded down to the Eastern Branch, unless in very  
smooth weather.  
Before a particular description of the Spot &amp;ca on which the City of Washington  
is laid out, be given, it may not be improper to note the constitutional and legal  
ground upon which the location of the City is made.  
The Constitution of the United States grants to Congress the power “to exercise  
exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten  
miles square) as may by cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress,  
become the seat of the Government of the United States.”   
In conformity with this Constitutional power the following Act was passed on the 16th  
of July 1790—  
“An Act for establishing the temporary and permanent Seat of the Government of the  
United States.  
Section 1st Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  
States of America in Congress assembled, That a district of Territory, not exceeding  
ten miles square, to be located as hereafter directed in the River Potomack, at some  
place between the mouths of the Eastern Branch and Connogochegue, be, and the same is  
hereby accepted for the permanent Seat of the Government of the  
United States: Provided nevertheless, that the operation of the laws of the State  
within such district shall not be affected by this acceptance, until the time fixed  
for the removal of the government thereto, and until Congress shall otherwise by law  
provide.  
Sect. 2d And be it further enacted, that the President of the United States be  
authorized to appoint, and by supplying vacancies happening from refusal to act or  
other causes, to keep in appointment as long as may be necessary, three Commissioners,  
who, or any two of whom, shall, under the direction of the President, survey, and by  
proper metes and bounds define and limit a district of Territory, under the  
limitations abovementioned; and the district so defined, limited &amp; located, shall  
be deemed the district accepted by this Act for the permanent Seat of the Government  
of the United States.  
Sect. 3d And be it enacted, That the said Commissioners or any two of them, shall  
have power to purchase or accept such quantity of land on the eastern side of the said  
River, within the said District, as the President shall deem proper for the use of the  
United States; and according to such plans as the President shall approve, the said  
Commissioners or any two of them, shall prior to the first monday in December, in the  
year one thousand eight hundred, provide suitable buildings for the accommodation of  
Congress, and of the President, and for the public Offices of the Government of the  
United States.  
Sect. 4. And be it enacted, That for defraying the expense of such purchases and  
buildings, the President of the United States be authorized and requested to accept  
grants of money.  
Sect. 5. And be it enacted, That prior to the first Monday in December next, all  
offices attached to the seat of the Government of the United States, shall be removed  
to, and until the said first monday in December one thousand eight hundred, shall  
remain at the City of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, at which place the  
session of Congress next ensuing the present shall be held.  
Sect. 6. And be it enacted, That on the said first Monday in December in the year one  
thousand eight hundred, the seat of the Government of the United States, shall, by  
virtue of this Act, be transferred to the District and place aforesaid. And all  
Offices attached to the seat of Government, shall accordingly be removed thereto by their respective holders, and shall, after the said day, cease to  
be exercised elsewhere; and that the necessary expense of such removal shall be  
defrayed out of the duties on imposts &amp; tonnage, of which a sufficient sum is  
hereby appropriated.”   
Upon examining the ground within the above described limits, and taking into  
consideration all circumstances, the President fixed upon the spot upon which the City  
has been since laid out, as the most proper for erecting the public buildings which  
are authorized to be prepared by the foregoing Act.  
But the Eastern Branch being made one of the boundaries within which the District of  
ten miles square was to be laid out, an amendment of the preceding act was thought  
necessary, so as to include a convenient part of the said Branch and the land of the  
South Eastern side of it within the said District of ten miles square. A formal Act  
for that purpose was accordingly passed on the third day of March 1791. By this means  
the Commissioners were enabled so to lay off the District of ten miles square, that  
the Centre thereof is made the centre of the spot on which the City is laid out as  
nearly as the nature &amp; form of the ground of the City will permit. The District of  
ten Miles square thereby includes the River Potomack for 5 miles above &amp; the like  
distance below the middle of the City—and extends into the State of Virginia about  
three miles over the River.  
The whole Area of the City consists of upwards of four thousand Acres. The ground is  
on an average about forty feet above the water of the River. Altho’ the whole taken  
together appears to be nearly a level spot, yet it is found to consist of what may be  
called wavy land—and is sufficiently uneven to give many very extensive and beautiful  
views from various parts of it, as well as to effectually answer every purpose of  
cleansing and draining the City.  
Two Creeks enter the City, one from the Main River, the other from the Eastern  
Branch, and take such directions as to be made to communicate with each other by a  
short Canal. By this means a water transportation for heavy Articles is opened into  
the heart of the City.  
No place has greater advantage of water either for the supply of the City or for  
cleansing the streets than this ground. The most obvious source is from the head  
waters of a Creek which seperates the City from George Town. This  
Creek takes its rise in ground higher than the City, and can readily be conveyed to  
every part of it. But the grand object for this purpose which has been contemplated by  
those best acquainted with the Country hereabouts and the circumstances attending it,  
and which has been examined with an eye to this purpose by good Judges, is the  
Potomack. The water of this River above the Great Falls, 14 miles from the City, is  
108 feet higher than the tide water. A small Branch, called Watt’s Branch, just above  
the falls, goes in a direction towards the City. From this Branch to the City a Canal  
may be made (and the ground admits of it very well) into which the River, or any part  
of it, may be turned and carried through the City. By this means the Water may not  
only be carried over the highest ground in the City; but if necessary over the tops of  
the Houses. This operation appears so far from being chimerical, that it is pronounced  
by good judges, who have examined the ground through &amp; over which it must pass,  
that it might be effected for perhaps less money than it has and will cost the  
Potomack Company to make the River Navigable at the Great &amp; Little Falls—and to  
clear the bed of the River between them.  
Should this be effected the produce of the Country will naturally be brought through  
it, and the situation afforded thereby for Mills and Manufactories of every kind that  
require the aid of Water, will be most excellent, and commensurate with any  
object.  
The public buildings for the accommodation of the Congress and the President of the  
United States are begun—and progress with much spirit. They are on a scale equal to  
the magnitude of the objects for which they are preparing—and will, agreeably to the  
plans which have been adopted, be executed in a style of architecture  
chaste—magnificent &amp; beautiful. They will be built with beautiful white Stone  
which is pronounced certainly equal if not superior to the best portland Stone, by  
persons who have been long experienced in working the first quality of the Portland  
Stone. The quantity of this Stone is fully equal to any demand that can arise for it.  
That used for the public buildings is from an Island about 20 miles  below the City, which has been purchased by the  
Commissioners, and from which, and a tract of land laying on the River in the  
neighbourhood of it (the right of getting stone from which for 20 years has also been  
purchased by the commissioners) it is supposed that enough of this  
Stone may be obtained to answer every demand, however great.  
Besides the buildings for the accomodation of the Government of the United States, a  
very superb Hotel is erecting, the expense of which is defrayed by a lottery the Hotel  
being the highest prize. This building, with all its accommodations and dependencies,  
will perhaps be equal to any one of the kind in Europe.  
The Original proprietors of the land on which the City is laid out, in consideration  
of the great benefits which they expected to derive from the location of the City,  
conveyed, in trust, to the Commissioners, for the use of the public &amp; for the  
purposes of establishing the City, the whole of their respective lands which are  
included within the lines of the City, upon condition, that, after retaining for the  
Public any number of Squares that the President may think proper for public  
improvements or other public uses, the lots shall be fairly and equally divided  
between the public and the respective proprietors.  
By this means the public had possession of upwards of ten thousand lots from which  
funds are to be raised to defray the expense of the public buildings (in addition to  
dollars given by the States of Virginia  
and Maryland for that purpose)—and to effect such other things as it may be incumbent  
on the public to do in the City—Between three &amp; four thousand lots have been  
already disposed of by the Commissioners, and the average price at their public sales  
has exceded two hundred &amp; forty dollars per lot. The price of lots has lately  
risen very much—and a great increase is still expected as the object comes to be more  
investigated &amp; better known.  
After furnishing very ample funds for the accomplishment of every object in the City  
on the part of the public, a large surplus of lots will remain the property of the  
City, which hereafter may, and undoubtedly will be so applied as to defray the annual  
expenses incident to the City—and the Citizens and their property thereby be free from  
a heavy tax which is unavoidable in other large Cities.  
Among the many advantages which will be derived to this City, over almost all other  
large Cities, from the Circumstance of its being originally designed for the Capital  
of a great Nation—may be ranked as the foremost, the width of the Streets—(none of which are less than ninety feet, &amp; from that to one hundred &amp;  
sixty) and the attention which will be paid to leveling or regulating the Streets,  
upon a general principle, in the first instance, in such a manner as to avoid any  
future inconvenience to such buildings as may be erected in the early establishment of  
the City—and to give that declivity to them in the several parts of the City as will  
readily and effectually carry all filth into the common Sewers—These circumstances are  
of the highest importance as they affect the health and the lives of the  
inhabitants.  
Besides the advantages which the City of Washington will have from its being the Seat  
of the Government of the United States—from its being within a few miles of the Centre  
of the Territory of the United States from North to South, and nearly the Centre of  
population—and from the immediate commerce of the Potomack—it will receive an immense  
benefit from its intercourse with the Country west of the Allegany Mountains through  
the River Potomack, which offers itself as the most natural and the nearest Channel of  
Commercial intercourse with that very extensive and rich Country.  
At present the land carriage between the navigable Waters of the Monongahelia (a fork  
of the Ohio) and the navigable Waters of the Potomack is less than forty miles, and a  
good waggon Road is open between the two waters. Men of judgement on the subject of  
inland navigation have examined the ground between the highest branches of the  
Potomack and those of the Ohio, and have been decidedly of opinion that the land  
carriage between the two places, where boats may come to each, can be reduced to  
fifteen miles, and they have found nothing to convince them but that these waters may  
hereafter be made to communicate with each other.  
The Settlers on the Ohio &amp; Mississippi will of course carry their heavy produce  
to a market down those Rivers; but their returns will be most natural through the  
Potomack; for they cannot ascend the Western Waters without great expense and much  
loss of time, the current there being so rapid that a sharp boat with six oars can  
scarcely ascend fifteen miles per day.  
The fur and peltry trade of the great Lakes may be brought to the City of Washington,  
through the Channel of the Potomack, four hundred miles nearer than to any other  
shipping port to which it has hitherto been carried.  
  
Mr Jefferson, in his notes on the State of Virginia, mentions this subject in the  
following words,  
“The Potomack offers itself under the following circumstances for the trade of the  
Lakes and the Waters Westward of Lake Erie. When it shall have entered that Lake it  
must coast along its southern shore on account of the number and excellence of its  
harbours; the Northern tho’ shortest having few harbours and those unsafe. Having  
reached Cayahoga, to proceed on to New York it will have eight hundred and twenty five  
miles and five portages; whereas it is but four hundred and twenty five miles to  
Alexandria its emporium on the Potomack, if it turns into the Cayahoga and passes  
through that, Big Beaver, Ohio, Yahogany (or Monongahelia &amp; Cheat) and the  
Potomack, and there are but two portages; the first of which from Cayahoga to Big  
Beaver may be removed by uniting the sources of these waters which are Lakes in the  
nighbourhood of each other and in a Champain Country: The others, from the waters of  
the Ohio to the Potomack, will be from fifteen to forty miles, according to the  
trouble which shall be taken to approach the two navigations. For the trade ⟨of⟩ the  
Ohio, or that which shall come into it from its own waters or from the Mississippi, it  
is nearer through the Potomack to Alexandria than to New York by five hundred &amp;  
eighty miles, and is interrupted by one portage only. There is another circumstance of  
difference. The lakes themselves never freeze; but the communications between them  
freeze; and the Hudson’s River itself is shut up by ice three months in the year;  
whereas the Channel to the Chesapeak leads directly to a warm climate, the southern  
parts of it very rarely freeze at all, and whenever the Northern do, it is so near the  
sources of the Rivers, that the frequent floods to which they are liable, break the  
ice up immediately, so that vessels may pass through the winter subject only to  
accidental and short delays.”   
In addition to the foregoing remarks it may be only necessary to say, that there is  
not a River in America capable of being rendered more secure from an attack by water  
than the Potomack. Its banks are every where high and bold, with the Channel often not  
more than two hundred yards from the Shore. Diggs’ point, about ten miles below the  
City of Washington, is remarkably well calculated for a Battery; as all vessels coming  
up the River must present their bows to that point for the distance of three quarters of a mile; and after  
passing, their sterns are equally exposed for about the same distance; the middle of  
the Channel there is not more than two hundred yards from the point.  
It may not be amiss to subjoin the following extracts from the Laws of Maryland, and  
the terms and conditions for regulating the materials and manner of the buildings and  
inprovements on the Lots in the City of Washington.  
Extract from the Act of the Assembly of Maryland, entitled “An Act for opening and  
extending the navigation of the River Potomack,” in which the Shares are made real  
Estate.  
“Be it enacted, That foreigners shall be and are hereby enabled to subscribe for and  
hold Shares in the Potomack Company.”   
Extract from an Act of the General Assembly of Maryland, entitled “An Act concerning  
the Territory of Columbia, and the City of Washington.  
Be it enacted, That any foreigner may, by deed or will, hereafter to be made, take  
and hold lands within that part of the said Territory which lies within this State, in  
the same manner as if he was a Citizen of this State, and the same lands may be  
conveyed by him and transmitted to, and be inherited by his heirs or relations, as if  
he and they were Citizens of this State Provided, That no foreigner shall, in virtue  
hereof, be entitled to any further or other privilege of a Citizen.”   
“Terms and Conditions declared by the President of the United States, for regulating  
the materials and manner of the Buildings and Improvements on the lots in the City of  
Washington.  
1st That the outer and party walls of all houses within the said City shall be built  
of Brick or Stone.  
2d That all buildings on the streets shall be parallel thereto, and may be advanced  
to the line of the Street, or withdrawn therefrom, at the pleasure of the improver:  
But where any such Building is about to be erected, neither the foundation or  
party-wall shall be begun without first applying to the person or persons appointed by  
the Commissioners to superintend the buildings within the City, who will ascertain the  
lines of the walls to correspond with these regulations.  
3d The wall of no house to be higher than forty feet to the Roof in any part of the  
city; nor shall any be lower than thirty five feet on any of the Avenues.  
4th That the person or persons appointed by the Commissioners to superintend the  
Buildings may enter on the land of any person to set out the  
foundation and regulate the Walls to be built between party and party, as to the  
breadth and thickness thereof: Which foundation shall be laid equally on the lands of  
the persons between whom such party-walls are to be built, and shall be of the breadth  
and thickness determined by such person proper: and the first builder shall be  
reimbursed one moity of the charge of such party-wall, or so much thereof as the next  
builder shall have occasion to make use

Alexandria, on the river Potomack, (where Gen. Braddock&#x27;s  
transports landed his troops) than any kind of merchandize is at  
this time sent from Northampton to London.&quot; And Mr. Jef­  
ferson, in his Notes on the State of Virginia, speaking of the  
connection between the Atlantic and Western Waters, fays, &quot; The  
Potomack offers itfelf under the following circumstances tor the  
trade of the lakes and the waters westward of lake Erie. When it  
shall have entered that 1 ke, it must coast along its Southern ftiore,  
on account of the number and excellence of its harbors, the North­  
ern, though shortest, having few harbors, and thole unfafe. Hav­  
ing reached Cayahoga, to proceed on to New-York, it will have  
825 miles, and five portages : Whereas it is but 425 miles to A­  
lexandria,its emporium on the Potomack, if it turns into the Cay­  
ihoga, and partes through that, Big-Beaver, Ohio, Yohogany, (or  
Monongahela and Cheat) and Potomack, and there are but two  
portages ; the firft of which, between Cayahoga and Beaver, may  
be removed by uniting the sources of these waters, which are lakes  
in the neighborhood of each other, and in a champaign country.  
The other, from the waters of the Ohio to Potomack, will be from  
15 to 40 miles, according to the trouble which shall be taken to  
approach the two navigations. For the trade of the Ohio, or that  
which shall come into it from its own waters or the Miflifippi, it  
is nearer through the Potomack to Alexandria than to New-York  
by 580 miies, and is interrupted by one portage only.  
There is another circumstance of difference too. The lakes  
themselves never freeze, but the communications between them  
freeze, and the Hudson&#x27;s river is itfelf shut up by the ice three  
months in the year ; whereas the channel to the Chefapeak leads  
direttly to a warm climate—the southern parts of it very rarely  
freeze at all, and whenever the northern do, it is so near the  
sources of the rivers, that the frequent floods to which they aie  
liable break up the ice immediately ; so that vessels may pass  
through the whole winter fubjeft only to accidental and ftiort de­  
jays.&quot; From the mouth of Savage to the settlements in the Mhf­  
kingum, weft of the Ohio, is about 140 miles. A good road  
between these places is now opening, if not completed; from  
the Great-Falls to tide water, following the course of the river,  
is fourteen miles, and by land only eleven ; from the Great-Fall

As to the defenfibility of the Potomack, we are of opinion no

banks are every where high and bold, with the channel often  
not more than two hundred yards from the (hore ; Digges&#x27;s point,

THE river Potomack forms a jundhon  
with the bay of Chefapeak, one hundred  
and fifty miles from the sea. From thence  
to the head of tide-water is about one  
hundred and sixty miles.  
  
•&#x27; This river is seven and an half miles  
»&#x27;ide at its mouth ; four and an half at  
Momony Bay ; three at Aquier; one and  
an half at Hollowing-Point; one and a  
quarter at Alexandria ; and the fame from  
thence to the city of Walhmgton, which  
is within three miles of the head of tide­  
water.—lts foundings are seven fathoms  
at the mouth ; five at St. George&#x27;s Island;  
four and an half at Lower Matchodic ;  
three at Servan&#x27;s Point, and the fame from  
thenee to the city.&quot; [Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;&#x27;  
Note 6 on Virginia.]  
  
From the Capts of the Chefapeak to  
the city of Washington, is upwards of  
three hundred miles; but the navigation  
is easy and perfectly fafe.—* A veflel of  
twelve hundred hogsheads of tobacco has  
loaded at and failed from Alexandria, and  
one of seven hundred hogsheads at George-  
Town, which is above the city.  
  
At the city the water rises four feet in  
a common tide.  
  
From the city of Walhington to Cum­  
berland, a flourirtiing town at the head of  
the river, is about two hundred and thirty  
miles as the river runs.  
  
Early in life General Washington con­  
templated the opening of this river, from  
tide-water to its source, so as to make it  
navigable for such veflels as were suitable  
for carrying the produce of the country  
to the (hipping ports below. His public  
employments in the part of the country  
through which the Potomack and its  
branches run, had given him a more com­  
plete knowledge of this river, than almost  
any other man poffefled at that time ; and  
his mind was strongly imprefled with its  
future importance. But the period for  
undertaking a work of such magnitude  
had not yet arrived The country was  
then but sparsely inhabited.—Canals and  
Locks but little understood, especially in  
America ; and but few men of property  
were willing to engage in an undertaking,  
the cost of which they could not clearly  
calculate, and the profits of which were to  
many doubtful.—General Walhington,  
I however, kept the object steadily in view,

waiting until time and cirrumftances {hould  
enable him to bring it forward, with a prof-  
  
peel of success,  
  
Tne tvar with Great Britain took place­  
about the time when the importance of  
this object began to be understood, and a  
villingnefs to embark in it began to appear  
among men of property. Until the close  
of that war nothing, however could be  
attempted iti the business.—But no soon­  
er had a happy termination of it enabled  
Gen. Wafl.ington to retire from his high  
public station, than he refumcd this object  
which had so long before occupied his  
mind. He found gentlemen cf the firft  
property and refpeftabiiity in the neigh­  
borhood of the Potomack, both in Virgi­  
nia and Maryland, ready to engage in the  
enterprise. Ia the year 1784 a company  
was formed for the purpose of removing  
the obftruftions, and opening the naviga­  
tion of the river from its source down to  
tide water, and an ast of incorporation,  
pafled by the assemblies of Virgihia snd  
Maryland, authorizing the company to  
take the neceiTary measures for carrying  
into effect the objects for which they were  
incorporated—and granting to them for  
ever the tolls which may arile therefrom ;  
which tolls are fixed by the fame law that  
empowers the company to undertake the  
business. The sum agreed upon to com­  
plete the navigation was 50,000!. sterling,  
divided into 500 (hares ot iocL each, to  
be paid by such inftahnents, and at such  
times, as the Directors of the Company  
(hould find necefiary for the prosecution of  
the work. Ten years were allowed the  
company to fettle the business.  
  
G. J.  
  
The company have prosecuted their  
work with great success, and what is not  
common in undertakings ef tlus nature,  
they will complete it for fomsthing less  
than the sum fubferibed. The rate of toll  
being fixed, and knowing with some accu­  
racy the quantity of produce that is now  
brought by land from these parts of the  
country, which will of course, throw the  
fame upon the river, they have a certainty  
of receiving, cn the firft opening of the  
river, a handsome per centage on their ca­  
pital, (even without calculating upon the  
articles which will be sent up the river,)  
and the increase will be almost incredible.  
Those who best know the circumstances of  
the country, and some, who are not among  
the moll sanguine with refpccl to the pro­  
fits of this undertaking, have no doubt  
of the capital&#x27;s producing fifty per cent,  
annually, in less than ten years from the  
time of the toll&#x27;s commencing.  
The principal work in completing the  
above mentioned navigation, is at the  
Great Falls, fourteen miles above the city  
of Washington—at the Little Falls, four  
miles above the said city, and in clearing  
the river between these two Falls. At the  
Great Falls, the water falls 72 feet in 1 mile  
and half—and at the Little Falls 36 feet  
8 inches in about two miles.—At the for-  
  
mer there will be fix, and at the latter  
  
three locks. The locks at the Little Falls  
will be finitlled this season, and fit for use ;  
those at the Great Falls are in forward-  
  
ness—and, with clearing the bed of the ri­  
ver between the two falls, will be completed  
next year. This will finifh the navigation  
  
of the main river, from Cumberland down  
to tide-water, and enable the Company to  
receive the reward ot their expesfe and la­  
bor. Boats, carrying from one hundred  
and fifty to two hundred barrels of flour,  
already pass from Cumberland to the Great  
Falls; and many thousand barrels of flour  
have actually been brought in boats to the  
latter place during the present year.  
Bcfides the main river of the Poto­  
mack, its numerous and extensive branches  
offer the prafpeft of transporting to the  
main river, and from thence to the ship­  
ping ports, an immense quantity of pro­  
duce.  
  
The following are the principal ftrramx  
which empty into the Potowmack, shove  
tide-water, and the distances to which  
they are navigahle in their natural (late,

it is yet but thinly fettled ; its inhabitants  
are, however, very rapidly multiplying,  
as well by emigration as by the natural  
course of population.  
The productions of the country consist  
of wheat, tobacco, Indian corn or maize,  
rye, oats, potatoes, beans, peas, and in  
Ihort, of every ai tide that the licll farm­  
ing lands are capable of producing. Hemp  
rid flax are cultivated here, and yield large  
quantities. &#x27;1 he land is rich in pailuragc  
molt parts of it admirably adapted to  
sheep ; and a heavy growth of timber, fit  
for (hip-building, as&quot; well as every other  
purpose, is found here. There i 3, near  
Cumberland, and within 10 or ?2 miles  
of the river, a tract of country that a­  
bounds with very large white pine trees,  
suitable for mills of (hips ; fomfe of thele  
trees are from 5 to 6 feet in diameter, and  
run up 100 feet without a branch.  
Slate, marble, frec-ftone of the red and  
grey Portland kind,and iron oie,are found  
in abundance on the banks of the river.  
Several large iron works are already esta­  
blished, which furnifh bar-iron and cafl­  
ings of an excellent quality. I/tmeftone  
abounds every where. Of coal too, there  
is an inexhaustible quantity, near Cumbei­  
land, laying on the banks of the river, &amp;  
in other parts at no great distance from it;  
from whence in future, not only all the  
towns and manufactories on the river may  
be supplied, bat it may become a capital  
article of exportation.  
There is in the river a great plenty of  
very fine filh. Large quantities of shad  
and herrings are annnally taken here and  
expoi ted to the Weft Indies-  
From the preceding observations, it is  
eafv to conceive that the commerce of  
this river cannot be inconfiderabk : And  
a iingle view of the frtuation upon which  
the city of Wafliington is laid out, points  
out that spot as the moll eligible on the  
river, for a large commercial town.  
The city of Washington lays in latitude  
53&#x27;.—It is situated on the east fide

the river nearly four miles, to an angle,

eastern branch with the Potomac!; ; li  
then runs along the eastern branch for  
more tban two milrt.—lts gcficra!&quot; width  
is about otie mile and three quarters.  
f&quot;he eastern branch affords one i&gt;f the  
fiirfit harbor* imaginable for ftips. It is  
more than a mile wide at its tnouth, and  
holds nearly the fame width fh- almost the  
  
whole distance to which the city extends  
upon it; it then narrows gradually to its  
head, which is about ten miles from its  
  
conflux with the Potumack.  
  
nel of this branch lays cn the fide next the  
city ; it has in al} parts of it, as far as the  
  
c;ty extends, from twenty to twenty-five  
  
feet of water. Above the city, it is only  
navigable for small craft. The channel is  
  
generally so near the city, that a whaif,  
extended forty, or fifty feet from the bank,  
will have water f*norigh for the largcfl fhijis  
to come up and discharge or receivc their  
cargoes. The hud on each fide or die  
branch is fufficiently high to secure (hip­  
ping from any wind tiiat blows ; and one  
  
very important advantage which this  
branch has, as a harbor, overall extensive  
  
rivers which freeze and are liable to be  
  
broken up fudd-rnly by frcfhfs or land  
floods, is, that on account of the fliort  
  
dillance to which it extends into the land,  
no rapidity of current is ever occafionec!  
by frefhes ; and, ye!THj in the main  
  
river, if they {huuld happen to be caught  
there by the ice, pre liable to receive great  
injury, and are forhetifces totally loft by  
it, those in the branch lay in perfciS fe­  
curity.—lt has also the advantage of being  
open some days later in the winter r.nd  
earlier in the spring than the main river at

closed so as to prevent the navigation: dur- &lt;  
  
tig the winter—this \n: th; cafe last win­  
:er.  
  
The nmn channel of tue Potomack op­  
posite the city, running near the Virginia  
shore, that part of the city which lavs up­  
on the Potomack has only a ftnall channel,  
carrying from eight to twelve feet of wa­  
ter, until you come within about three  
quarters of a mile of George-Town, when  
the channel turning between Mafon&#x27;s-Ifland&#x27;  
and the city, gives a depth of water fromt *  
twenty to thirty feet close in with the  
shore of the city. This renders the water­  
lots within that small space very valuable ;  
for any (hips that come up the river may  
here lay within twenty yards of the city,  
and the boasts which bring t&#x27;n« produce of  
the country down the river, may at all  
times come her*, deep loaded as they corns  
down ; whereas they could not go, thus  
loaded, down to the ealtern branch, unlefi  
in very smooth weather.  
Before a particular defcriptiop. of the  
spot, &amp;c. on which the city of Wafliing­

improper to note the conftiti-.tiorial and

A N ■»  
  
amendment to the preceding ast was  
thought neceflary, Co as to include acon­  
&quot;nt part of the inid branch, and the  
land on the north-eattern fide of it, within  
the laid diftritt of ten miles square. A  
formal ast for that purpose was according­  
ly pal Ted on the 3d day of March, 1791.  
—-By this means the Commissioners were  
enabled so to lay off the dillrift of ten  
miles fcjuare, that the center thereof is  
made the center of the spot on which the  
city is laid out, as nearly as the nature  
and form of the ground of the city will  
permit. The district of ten miles square  
thereby includes the river Potomack for  
five miles above and the like diitance below  
the middle of the city; and extends in the  
slate of Virginia about three miles over the  
  
The whole area of the city conlifts of  
upv.arda of four thousand acres.—The  
ground, on an average, is about forty  
feet above the water of the river. Although  
the whole, when taken together, appears  
to be nearly a leva! spot, yet it is found to  
consist of what may be called wavy land;  
and is fuffieiently uneven to give many verk  
extensive and beautiful views from various  
parts of it, as well as to efFectually answer  
every purpose of cleansing and draiping the  
city.  
  
Two creeks enter the city, one from  
the eastern branch, the other from the Po­  
tomack, and take inch directions as to be  
made to communicate with each other by a  
(hort canal.—By this means a water trans­  
portation, for heavy articlei, is opened in­  
to (he heart of the city.  
  
No place has greater advantage of wa­  
ter, either for the supply of the City or  
for cleanling the llreets, than this ground.  
The most obvious source is from the head  
waters of a creek which separates the city  
from George-Town.—This creek takes  
its &#x27;rife in ground higher than the City,  
arid can readily be conveyed to every part of  
it.—But the grand object for this purpose,  
which has been contemplated by those beil  
acquainted with {he country hereabouts,  
and the circumltances attending it, and  
which has been examined with an eye to  
this purpose, by good judges, is the Poto­  
mack. The water of this river above the  
Great-Falls, 14 miles from the city, is one  
hundred and eight feet higher than the  
tide-water. A small branch, called Watt&#x27;s-  
Branch, just above the falls, goes in a di­  
rection towards the city. From this branch  
to the city a canal may be made (and the  
ground admits of it very well) into which  
the river, or any part of it, may be turned  
and carried through the city.—By this  
means the water may not only be carried  
over the highest ground in the city—but  
if necessary over the tops of the houses.  
This operation appears so far from being  
chimerical, that it is pronounced by good  
judges, who have examined the ground  
through, and over which it must pass, that  
it may be eftedted for perhaps less money  
than it has and will colt the Potomack  
company, to make the river navigable at  
the Great and Little Falls, and to clear  
the bed of the river between them..  
  
Should this be efte&amp;ed, the produce of  
the country will naturally be broughtthro&#x27;  
it ; and the situation afforded thereby for  
mills and manufactories of every kind.that  
require the aid of water, will be mod ex­  
cellent, and commensurate with any ob­  
ject.  
  
The public buildings for the accommo­  
dation of the Congrefsand the President  
of the United States, are begun, and pro­  
gress with nuch spirit. They are on a  
scale equal to the magnitude of the objefta  
for which they are preparing ; and will,  
agreeable to the plans which have been a­  
dopted, be executed in n style of archi­  
tecture, chaste, magnificent and beautiful.  
They will be built with beautiful white  
stone ; which is pronounced certainly e­  
qual, if not superior, to the belt Port­  
land stone, by persons who have been long  
experienced in working the firft quality of  
Portland stone. The quantity of thi*  
stone is fully equal to any demand that can  
arifc from it. That used for the public  
  
faffs

[Whole No. 477.3  
  
buildings is from an island about 40 miles  
below the city, which has been purclmfe.i  
by tiie Couinii&#x27;Qonrr*, and from winch,  
and .1 tract or land uu the nVr in  
the ueighborlfood of it (the right of get­  
ting (lone from which, for 23 yvars, baa  
a&#x27;.fo been purchased by the commifiibners,)  
it is supposed that enough of this (lone  
may be obtained {o answer every demand,  
however great.  
Befldes the buildings for the accommo­  
dation of the government of the United  
States, a very superb hotel is erecting, the  
expence of which is defrayed by a lotte­  
ry, the hotel being the higheit prize   
This building, with its accommodations  
and dependencies, will ptnrhaps be equal to  
any of the kind in Europe. v  
The original proprietors of the land on  
which the city is laid out, in consideration  
oi the great benefits which they expect­  
ed to derive from the location of the city,  
conveyed, in trust, to the Commiffioncrs.  
for the ufeof the public, and for the pur­  
pose of eftablilhing the city, til* whole of  
their refpeftive lands which are included  
within the lines of the city, upon condition,  
that, after retaining for the public the  
ground of the ftrects, and any number of  
squares that the Prfcfident may think pro­  
per for public improvements or other pub­  
lic uses, the lots shall be fairly and equal­  
ly divided between the public and the  
refpeftive proprietors.  
  
By this means the public had a polTef­  
fion of more than 10,000 lots, from which  
funds are to be raised, to defray the ex­  
pence of the public buildings,&quot; (in addi­  
tion to i 92,000 dollars* given by the  
Hates of Virginia and Maryland for that  
purpose) and to eHeft such other things  
as it may be incumbent npon the public to  
do in the eity.  
  
Between three and four thousand lots  
have been fold by the commissioners, and  
the average price at their public l&#x27;ales have  
exceeded two hundred and forty dollars a  
lot. The price of lots has already risen  
very much, and a great increase of price  
is still expeded, as the object comes to be  
more inveiligated, and better understood.  
  
After fuinifhing very atnple funds for  
the accompli(hment of every objed in this  
city, on the part of the public, a large  
surplus of lots will remain the property  
of the city, which hereafter may, and un­  
doubtedly will be lo applied,as todefray the  
annual expences incident to the city ; and  
the citizens, and their property, will he  
forever free from a heavy tax, which is  
unavoidable in other large cities.  
Among the many advantages which  
will be derived to this city over almost all  
other large cities, from the circumitance of  
its being originally designed for the capi­  
tal of a great nation, may be ranked, as  
the foremofl ; the width of the llreets,  
(none of which are less than ninety feet,  
and from that to one hundred and sixty,)  
and the attention which will be paid to le­  
velling or regulating the itreets upon a,  
general principle, in the firft instance, in  
such a manner as to avoid any future in­  
convenience to such buildings as may be e­  
rected in the early ellablifhment of the city,  
and to give that declivity to them, in the  
several parts of the city, whieh will readi­  
ly and efle&amp;ually carry off all filth in the  
common sewers. These circumtiances are  
of the highest importance, as they affect  
the health and the lives of th« inhabi­  
tants.  
  
Besides the advantage which the city  
of Washington will have, from its being  
the feat of government of theUnitedStates,  
from its being within a few miles of the  
center of the territory of the United States,  
from north to south, and nearly the center  
of population, and from the immediate  
commerce of the Potomack, it will receive  
an iramefe benefit from its intercOurse  
with the country Weft of the Allegany  
mountains, through the Potomack, which  
offers itfelf as the most natural, aad the

The fur and peltry trade of the Great  
Lakes may be brought to the city of Wash­  
ington, through the channel of the Poto­  
mack, four hundred miles nearer than to  
any cthei (hipping-port to which it has  
been carried heretofore.  
  
Mr. JefFerfon, in his notes on Virginia,  
mentions this fubjeft in the following  
words:—&quot; The Potomack offers itfelf  
under the following circumstances, for the  
trade of the lakes, and the waters well­  
ward of Lake Erie. When it (hall have  
entered that lake, it must coafl: along its  
southern (hore, on account of the number  
and excellence of its harbors ; the north­  
ern, though (horteft, having few harbors,  
and those unfafe.—Having reached Caya­  
hoga, to proceed on to New-York, it will  
have eight hundred and twenty five miles,  
and five portages : Whereas it has but  
four fiundred and tiventy-five mile 6 to  
Alexandria, its emporium on the Poto­  
mack, if it turns into Cayahoga, and pas­  
ses through that, Big Beaver, Ohio, Yo­  
hogany,(on Monongahela and Cheat,) and  
the Potomack ; and there are but two  
portages; the firft of which, (from Caya­  
hoga to Big Beaver) may be removed by  
uniting the sources of these waters, which  
are lakes in the neighborhood of each  
other, and in a champain country.—The  
other from the waters of the Ohio to the  
Potomack, will be from fifteen to forty  
miles, according to the trouble that (hail  
be taken to approach the two navigations.  
—For the trade of the Ohio, or that which  
(hall come into it from its own waters, or  
from the Mifiifippi, it is nearer through the  
Potomack to Alexandria, than to New-  
York, by five hundred and eighty miles,  
and is interrupted by one portage only.  
  
There is another circumstance of differ­  
ence.—The lakes themfelve6 never freeze;  
but the communications between them  
freeze, and the Hudson&#x27;s river itfelf is (hut  
up by ice three months in the year; where­  
as the channel of the Chefepeak leads direct­  
ly to a warm climate, the southern parts  
of it rarely freezes at all, and whenever  
the northern do, it is so near the sources  
of the rivers, that the frequent floods to  
which they are liable, break the ice up  
immediately, so that vefTels may pass  
through the winter, fubjeft only to acci­  
dental and short delays.&quot;  
  
In addition to the foregoing remarks,  
it may only be neceflary to fay, that there  
is not a river in America capable of being  
rendered more secure from an attack by  
water than the Potomack. Its banks  
are every where high and bold, with the  
channel often not more than two hundred  
yards from the (lioie. Digg&#x27;s-Point, about  
ten miles below the city of Walhington, is  
remarkably well calculated for a battery ;  
as all veflfels coming up the river must pre­  
sent their bows to that poin, for the dis­  
tance of three miles; and after palling,  
their sterns are equally exposed for about  
the fame distance; the middle of the chan­  
nel there is not more than two hundred  
yards from the point.  
  
It may not be amiss to subjoin the fol­  
lowing extracts from the laws of Maiy­  
land; and the terms and conditions for  
regulating the materials and manner of the  
buildings and improvements on the lots in  
the city of Washington.

Upon examining the ground within the  
above described limits, and taking into  
consideration all circumstances, the Presi­  
dent fixed upon the spot upon which the  
city has since been lafd out, as the moll  
proper for ere&amp;ing the public buildings  
which areauthorifed to be prepared by the  
foregoing act.  
  
But the eastern branch being made one  
of the boundaries, within which the diftridt  
of ten miles square was to be laid out, an  
  
AND  
  
amendment to the preceding ast was  
tl.iM ght neceffiuy, so as to include acon­  
«iii it part of. the said branch, and the  
land on the narth-eaitern hue of it, within  
the said diftrift of ten mile# square. A  
formal ast for that purpose was according­  
ly paired on the 3d day of March, 1791.  
---By this means the Commissioners were  
enabled so to lay off the diitrift of ten  
miles square, that the center thereof is  
made the center of the spot on which the  
city is laid out, as nearly as the nature  
and form of the ground of the city will  
permit. The diftrift of ten miles square  
thereby includes the river Potomack for  
five miles above and the like distance below  
the middle cf the city; and extends in the  
&quot;tate of Virginia about three miles over the  
  
The whole area of the city consists of  
upwards of four thousand acres.—The  
ground, on an average, is about forty  
feet above the water of the river. Although  
the whole, when taken together, appears  
to be nearly a leva! spot, yet it is found to  
consist of what may be called wavy land;  
and is fuffieiently uneven to give many verk  
extensive and beautiful views from various  
parts of it, as well as to effectually answer  
every purpose of clcanfing and draiping the  
city.  
  
Two creeks enter the city, one from  
the eastern branch, the other from the Po­  
tomack, and take i&#x27;uch directions as to be  
made to communicate with each other by a  
(hort canal.—By this means a water trans­  
portation, for heavy articles, is opened in­  
to (he heart of the city.  
  
No place has greater advantage of wa­  
ter, either for the supply of the City or  
for cleanllng the streets, than this ground.  
The most obvious lource is from the head  
waters of a creek which separates the city  
from George-Town.—This creek takes  
its &#x27;rife in ground higher than the City,  
arid can readily be conveyed to every part of  
it.—But the grand objedt for this purpose,  
which has been contemplated by those belt  
acquainted with {lie country hereabouts,  
and the circumstances attending it, and  
which has been examined with an eye to  
this purpose, by good judges, is the Poto­  
mack. The water of this river above the  
Great-Falls, 14 miles from the city, is one  
hundred and eight feet higher than the  
tide-water. A small branch, called Watt&#x27;s-  
Branch, just above the falls, goes in a di­  
rection towards the city. From this branch  
to the city a canal may be made (and the  
ground admits of it very well) into which  
the river, or any part of it, may be turned  
and carried through the city.—By this  
means the water may not only be carried  
over the highest ground in the city—but  
if necessary over the tops of the houfe6.  
This operation appears so far from being  
chimerical, that it is pronounced by good  
judges, who have examined the ground  
through, and over which it must pass, that  
it may be eft&#x27;e&amp;ed for perhaps less money  
than it has and will coll the Potomack  
company, to make the river navigable at  
the Great and Little Falls, and to clear  
the bed of the river between them..  
  
Should this be effe&amp;ed, the produce of  
the country will naturally be broughtthro&#x27;  
it ; and the situation afforded thereby for  
mills and manufactories of every kind.that  
require the aid of water, will be most ex­  
cellent, and comraenfurate with any ob­  
ject.  
  
The public buildings for the accommo­  
dation of the Congress and the President  
of the United States, are begun, and pro­  
gress with much spirit. They are on a  
scale equal to the magnitudeof the objefta  
for which they are preparing ; and will,  
agreeable to the plans which have been a -  
dopted, be executed in n style of archi­  
tecture, chaste, magnificent and beautiful.  
They will be built with beautiful white  
(lone ; which is pronounced certainly e­  
qual, if not superior, to the bell Port­  
land stone, by persons who have been long  
experienced in working the firft quality of  
Portland stone. The quantity of thi«  
stone is fully equal to any demand that can  
arifc from it. That ufcd for the public  
  
fate  
  
R T I S E R.  
  
[Whole No. 477.]  
  
buildings is from an illand about 40 miles  
below the city, which has been purchased  
by tlie CotrimilTioners, and from which,  
and a tract or land tymg oil ilie nvcr in  
the lieighborliood of it (the right of get­  
ting Hone from which, for 23 yvars, has  
alio been purchaled by the eommifiionets,)  
it is supposed that enough of this (tone  
may be obtained to aiifv.vr every demand,  
however great.  
  
Besides the buildings for the t.L\on:mo­  
datiori of the government of the United  
States, a very superb hotel is ere&amp;ing, the  
expence of which is defrayed by a lotte­  
ry, the hotel being the higheii prize.—  
This building, with its accommodations  
and dependencies, will perhaps be equal to  
any of the kind in Europe. n  
The original proprietors of the land on  
which the city is laid out, in confederation  
of the great benefits which they expect­  
ed to derive from the location of the city,  
conveyed, in trust, to the Commifiioncrs.  
for the ufeof the public, and far the piir­  
pofe of establishing the city, th« whole of  
their refpe&amp;ive lands which are included  
within the lines of the city, upon condition,  
that, after retaining for the public the  
ground of the ftrects, and any number of  
squares that the Prfcfident inay think pro­  
per for public improvements or other pub­  
lic uses, the lots (hall be fairly and equal­  
ly divided between the public and the  
refpe&amp;ive proprietors.  
  
By this means the public &quot;had a pollef-  
Con of more than 10,000 lots, from which  
funds are to be raised, to defray the ex­  
pence of the public buildings, (in addi­  
tion to f 52,000 dollars* given by the  
Hates of Virginia and Maryland for that  
purpose) and to efieft such other things  
as it may be incumbent npon the public to  
do in the eity.  
  
Between three and four thousand lots  
have been fold by the commissioners, and  
the average price at their public sale* have  
exceeded two hundred and forty dollars a  
lot. The price of lots has already risen  
very much, and a great increase of price  
is (till expe&amp;ed, at ths objett comes to be  
more inveiligated, and belter understood.  
  
After fui nifhing very ample funds for  
the accompli(hment of every objedl in thi»  
city, on the part of the public, a large  
furplug of lots will remain the property  
of the city, which hereafter may, and un­  
doubtedly will be lo applied,as to defray the  
annual expences incident to the city ; and  
the citizens, and their property&#x27;, will he  
forever free from a heavy tax, which is  
unavoidable in other large citiee.  
  
Among the many advantages which  
will be derived to this city over almost all  
other large cities, from the circumllance of  
its being originally designed for the capi­  
tal of a great nation, may be ranked, as  
the foremofl ; the width of the streets,  
(none of which are less than ninety feet,  
and from that to one hundred and sixty,)  
and the attention which will be paid to le­  
velling or regulating the ltreets upon a  
general principle, in the firft inilance, in  
such a manner as to avoid any future in­  
convenience to such buildings as may be e­  
rected in the early establishment of the city,  
and to give that declivity to them, in the  
several parts of the city, whieh will readi­  
ly and effe&amp;ually carry off all filth in the  
common sewers. These circumftancej are  
of the highest importance, as they affect  
the health and the lives of the inhabi­  
tants.  
  
Besides the advantage which the citv  
of Washington will have, from its bcinrf  
the feat of government of theUnitedStatcs,  
from its being within a few miles of the  
center of the territory of the United States,  
from north to south, and ne?.vly the center  
of population, and from the immediate  
commerce of the Potomack, it will receive  
an immefe benefit from its intercourse  
with the coufifry Weft of the Allegany

mind was ftrongly impreffed with

Objervations on the River Potowmac.  
  
ance of this object began to be  
yaderftood, and a willingnefs to  
embark in it began to appear  
among men of property. Until  
the clofe of that war, nothing,  
however, could be attempted in  
the bufinefs. But no fooger had  
a happy termination of it enabled  
General Wathingtor to retire from  
his high public ftation, than he  
refumed this obje&amp;t which had fo  
long before occupied his mind.  
He found gentlemen of the firft  
property and refpectability in the  
neighbourhood of the Potowmac,  
both in Virginia and Maryland,  
ready to engage in the enterprife.  
In the year 1784, a company was  
formed for the purpofe of remov-  
ing the obftruétions and opening  
the navigation of the river from  
its fource down to tide-water, and  
an.act of incorporation, pafled by  
the afflemblies of Virginia and  
Maryland, authorifing the com-  
  
pany to take the neceflary mea-°  
  
{ures for carrying into effect the  
objeéts for which they were in-  
corporated—and granting tothem,  
forever, the tolls which may arife  
therefrom; which tolls are fixed  
by the fame law that empowers  
the Company to undertakethe bu-  
finefs. ‘The {wm agreed upon to  
complete the navigation was fifty  
thoufand pounds frerling, divided  
into five hundred fhares, of one  
hundred pounds each, to be paid  
by fuch inftalments, and at fuch  
times, as the Dire@tors.of the Com-  
pany fhould find neceffary for the  
profecution of the work.: Ten  
years were allowed the Company  
to finith the bufinefs.  
  
lhe Company have profecuted  
their work with great fuccefs, and  
what is not common in under-  
takings of this nature, they will  
Complete it for fomething lefs  
than the fum fubfcribed. The rate  
@ toll being fixed, and knowing

with fome accuracy the quantity  
of produce that is now brought  
by land from thofe: parts of the  
country, which will, of courfe,  
throw the fame upon the river,  
they have a certainty of receiving,  
on the firft opening of the river,  
a handfome per centage on_ their  
capital, (even without calculating  
upon the articles which will be  
fentup the river,) andthe increafe  
will be almoft incredible. Thofe  
who beft know the circumftances  
of the country, and fome, whe  
are not among the moft fanguine  
with refpeét to the profits of this  
undertaking, have no doubt of  
the capital’s producing fifty per  
cent. annually, in lefs than ten  
years from the time of the toll’s  
commencing.  
  
The principal work in com-  
pleting the above navigation, is at  
the Great Falls, fourteen miles  
above the city of Wafhington——  
atthe Little Falls, four miles above  
  
- the faid city, and in,clearing the  
  
river between thefe two falls. At  
the Great Falls, the water falls 72  
feet in one mile and an half, and  
at the Little Falls, 36 feet eight  
inches in about two miles. At  
the former, there vill be fix, and  
the latter, three locks. The locks,  
at the Little Falls, will be ‘finifhed  
this feafon, and fit for ufe; thofe  
at the Great Fa%ls are in forward-  
nefs, and, with the clearing the  
bed of the river between the two  
Falls, will be completed next year.  
This will finith the navigation of  
the main river, from Cumberland  
down to tide-water, and enable  
the company to receive the re-  
ward of their expence and labour.  
  
Boats, carrying from one hundred  
and fifty to two hundred barrels  
of flour, already pafs from Cum-  
berland to the Great Falls; and  
many thoufand barrels of flour  
  
have aétually been brought in boats

Befides the main river of the  
Potowmac, its numerous and ex-  
tenfive branches offer the profpect  
of tranfporting to the main river,  
and from thence to the fhipping  
ports, an immenfe quantity of  
produce.  
  
The following are the principal  
{treams which empty into the Po-  
towmac above tide-water, and the  
diftances to which they are navi-

their conflux with the Potowmac.  
  
Patterfon’s creek, which falls  
into the river ten miles below  
Cumberland, is navigable twenty  
miles above its mouth; the fouth  
branch, feventeen miles below  
Cumberland, is navigable one  
hundred miles; Cape-Capeon, 60  
miles below, is navigable 20 miles;  
Conogocheque, go miles below, is  
navigable 24 miles; Opecan, 125  
miles below, is navigable 25 miles  
from its mouth, and within a few  
miles of Winchefier, which, after  
Lancafter, is the largeft inland  
town in the United States. The  
Shannandoah, 130 miles below;  
runs into the country at right  
angles from the Potowmac, nearly  
200 miles, and the navigation of  
it, for 150 miles of that diftance,  
is but little interrupted; the chief  
  
obftruction is, where it enters the  
Potowmac; and, fo trifling is that,  
compared with the great advan:  
tages of this noble branch, that  
its removal and clearing other  
parts, will not coft more than  
twenty-five thoufand dollars. The  
Potowmac Company have already  
made a beginning on this work.

Cumberland, is navigable thirty  
milesabove its mouth. This branch

The number of inhabitants  
living in the feveral counties of  
Virginia and Maryland, border.  
ing upon the Potowmae or its  
branches, amount to upwards of  
three hundred thoufand, accord-  
ing to the cenfus taken by order  
of the general government, in the  
year 1791. They are all, or  
nearly fo, that not one fiftieth  
can be excepted, cultivators of the  
foil.. it is, therefore, eafy to con-  
ceive, that they muuft: fend an

But, ftill fo extenfive is the coun-

Objfervations ou the River Potowinat,  
  
telbas for every other purpofe, is  
found here. There is, near Cum-  
berland, and within ten or twelve  
miles of the river, a tract of coun-  
try that abounds with very large  
white-pine trees, fuitable for matts  
of fhips; forne of thefe trees are  
from five to fix feet in diameter,  
andrun up one hundred feet with-  
out a branch.  
  
Slate, marble, free-ftone of the  
redand grey Portland kind, and  
jron ore, are found in abundance  
onthe banks of the river. Several  
large iron-works are already efta-  
blithed, which furnifa bar-iron  
and caftings of an excellent qua«  
lity. Limeftone abounds every  
where. Of coal too, there is an  
inexhauftible quantity, near Cum-  
berland, laying on the banks of  
the river, and in other parts at  
no great diftance from it; frorn  
whence, in future, not enly ail

plenty of very fine fith. Large  
quantities of fhad and herrings  
ure annually taken here, and ex-  
ported to the Weft-Indies.  
  
From the preceding obferva-  
tions, it is eafy to conceive that  
the commerce of this river cannot  
be inconfiderable: and a fingle  
view of the fituation npon which  
the city of Wafhington is laid out,  
points out that {pot as the moft  
eligible on the river for a large  
commercial town.  
  
, Thé city of Wathington lays  
in latitude 38° 53.—Itis fituated  
on the eaft fide of the Potowmac,  
  
about four miles below the head.  
  
of tide-water, and extends down  
the river nearly four miles, to an  
angle, which is formed | by the  
junction of the eaftern branch  
with the Potowmac; it then-runs  
  
213  
  
along the eaftern branch for more  
than two miles, Its general width  
is about one mile and three quar-  
ters.  
  
The eaftern branch affords one  
  
of the fineft harbours imaginable  
  
for fhips. It is more than a mile  
wide at its mouth, and holds nearly  
the faine width foralmoft the whole  
diftance to which the city extends  
upon it; it then narrows gradually  
to its head, which is about ten  
miles from its conflux with the  
Potowmac. The channel of this  
branch lays on the fide next the  
city ; it has in all parts of it, as  
far as the city extends, from twen-  
ty to thirty-five feet of water.  
Above the city, it is only navi-  
gable for {mall craft. “The chan-  
nel is generally fo near the city,  
that a wharf, extended forty or fif-  
ty feet from the bank, will have  
water enough for the largeft fhips  
tocome up, and difcharge or re-  
ceive their cargoes. The land on  
each fide of the branch is fuffici-  
ently high to fecure fhipping from  
any wind that blows; and-ene ve-  
ry important advantage which this  
branch has, asa harbour, over alt  
extenfive rivers which freeze and  
are liable to be broken up fudden~  
lv by frefhes or land floods, is,  
that on account of the fhort dif-  
tance to which it extends into the  
land, no rapidity of current is ever  
occafioned by frefhes; and, while  
veflels in the main river, if they  
fhould happen to be caught there  
by the ice, are liable to receive  
injury, and are fometimes totally  
loft by it, thofe in the branch lay  
in perfect fecurity. It has alfo  
the advantage of being open fome  
days later in the winter and earlier  
in the fpring, than the main river  
at Georgetown, and the upper  
erts of the city. The river ge-  
nerally fhuts up about Chriftmas,

The main channel of the Po-  
towmac oppofite the city, running  
near the Virginia fhore, that part  
of the city which lays upon the  
Potowmac has only a fmall chan-  
nel, carrying from eight to twelve  
feet of water, until you come  
within about three quarters of a  
mile of Georgetown, when the  
channel turning between Mafon’s  
iftand and the city, gives a depth  
of water from twenty to thirty feet  
clofe in withthe fhore of the city.  
This renders the water lots with-  
in that fmall fpace very valuable;  
for any fhips that come up the  
river may here lay within twenty  
yards of the city, and the boats  
which bring the produce of the  
country down the river, may, at  
all times, come here deep loaded  
as they come down; whereas they  
could not go, thus loaded, down  
to the eaftern branch, unlefs in  
very fmooth weather.  
  
Before a particular defcription  
of the fpot, &amp;c. on which the eity  
of Wafhington is laid out, be  
given, it may not be improper to  
note the conftitutional and legal

PON examining the ground  
  
within the above defcribed  
limits, and taking into confidera-  
tion all circumftances, the Prefi-  
dent fixed upon the fpot upon  
which the city has fince been laid  
out, as the moft proper for erect-  
ing the public buildings which are  
authored to be prepared by the  
foregoing act,  
  
But the eaftern branch being  
made oneof the boundaries, with-.  
in which the diftri&amp; of ten miles  
iquare was to be laid out, an  
cmendment of the preceding act  
was thought ‘neceflary, fo as to  
igclude a convenient ‘part of the  
faid branch, and the land on the  
fouth-caftern fide of it within the  
fiid diftri&amp; of ten miles fanare.  
A formal att for that purpofe was  
  
accordingly pafled on the 3d day  
of March, 179&#x27;.—By this means  
the Commiffioners were enabled  
fo to lay off the diftrict of ten miles  
fquare, that the center thereof is  
made the center of the f{pot.on  
which the City is laid out, as near-  
ly as the nature and form of the  
ground of the City will permit.  
The diftri&amp; of ten miles fquare  
thereby includes the river Potow  
mac for five miles above and the  
like diftance below the middle ot  
the City; and extends in the fiate  
of Virgizia about three miles over  
the river.  
  
The whole area of the City con-  
fifts of upwards of four thoufan¢  
acres. The ground, on an averagss  
is about forty feet above the water  
of she river. Although the whole,  
  
4 wired  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
when taken together, appears to  
penearly alevelfpot, yet itis fou nd  
to confift of what may -be called  
wavy land; and is fufficiently un-  
evento give many very extenfive  
and beautiful views from various  
  
of it, as well as to effectually  
  
anfwer every purpofe of cleanfing  
and draining the city.  
  
Two creeks enter the Citv, one  
from the eaftern branch, the other  
from the Potowmac, and take fuch  
direétions as to be made to com-  
municate with each other by a  
fhort’ canal.—By this means a  
water tranfportation, for heavy ar-  
ticles, is opened into the heart of  
the City.  
  
No place has greater advantage  
of winter, either for the fupply of  
the City, or for cleanfing. the  
ftreets, than this ground. The  
moft obvious fouree is from the  
head waters.of.a creek which fe-  
parates the City trom Geer ge- Town,  
~This creek takes its rife in  
ground higher than the city, and  
can readily be conveyed to every  
  
part of it.--But the grand obje¢t -  
  
for this purpofe, which has been  
contemplated by thofe beft ac-  
quainted with the country here-  
abouts, and the circumftances at-  
tending it, and which has been  
examined with an eye to this pur-  
pofe, by good judges, is the Po-  
wowmac. The water of this river  
above the Great-Fails, 14 Miles  
from the City, is one hundred  
and eight feet higher than the tide-  
water. A finall branch, called  
Watt&#x27;s-Branch, yatt above the falls,  
goes in a direction towards the  
City. From this branch to the  
City, a canal may be made (and  
the ground admits of it very well)  
into which the river, or any part  
of it, may be turned and carried  
through the Cit¢.—By this means  
the water may not only be car-  
ned over the higheft ground in

the city—but if neceflary, over:  
the tops of the houfes. This  
operation appears fo far from be-  
ing chimerical, that it is. pro-  
nounced by.good judges, who have  
examined the. ground through,  
and over which it muft pafs, that  
it may be effected for perhaps lefs  
money than it has and will -coft  
the Potowwmac Company, to make  
the river navigable at the: Great  
and Little Falls, and to clear the  
bed of the river between. them. ..  
  
Should this be effect, the pro-  
duce of the country will naturally  
be brought through’ it; and the  
fittiation afforded thereby for mills:  
and manufactories of every kind,  
that require the aid of water, will  
  
be moft excellent, and commen-:  
  
furate with any object.  
  
The public. buildings for the  
accommodation of the Congrefs,  
and the Prefident of the United  
States, are begun, and progrefs  
with much fpirit. They are on  
a fcale equal to the magnitude of  
the objects for which they are pre-  
paring; and will, agreeable to the  
plans which have been adopted,  
be executed ina ftile of architec-  
ture, chafte, magnificent, and  
beautiful. They will be built  
with beautiful white ftone, which  
is pronounced certainly equal, if  
not fuperior, to the beft Portland  
ftone, by peafons who have been  
long experienced in eeu | the  
firft quality of Portland: ftone.  
The quantity of this ftone is fully  
equal to any demand&gt;that can  
arife from it. That ufed for the  
public buildings is from an ifland  
about 40 miles below the City,  
which has been purchafed by the  
Commiffioners, and from which,  
and a traét of tand lying on the  
river in the neighbourhood of it,  
(the right of getting fione from  
which, for 20 years, has alfo been  
  
purchafed by the Commiffioners)

it is fuppofed that enough of this  
ftone may be obtained to anfwer  
every demand, however great.  
  
Befides the buildings for the ac-  
commodation oi the government  
of the United States, avery fuperb  
Hotel is erecting, the expence of  
which is defrayed by a lottery, the  
Hotel being the higheft prize.  
This building, with its accom-  
modations and dependencies, wail  
perhaps be equal to any ene of the  
kiad in Europe.  
  
The original proprietors of the  
land on which the City is laid out,  
in confideration of the great be-  
nefits which they expected to de-  
rive from the location of the City,  
conveyed, in traft, to the com-  
niiflioners, for the ufe of the pub-  
lic, and for the purpofe of efta-  
blifhing the City, the whole of  
their refpective. Jands which are  
  
‘included within the lines of the  
  
City, upon condition that, after  
retaining for the public the ground  
of the itreets, and any number  
of {quares that the Prefident may  
think proper for public -improve-  
ments or other public ufes, the  
Jots fhall be fairly and equally di-  
vided between the public and the  
ref{pective proprietors.  
  
By this means the public had  
poflefion of more than ten thou-  
fand lots, from which funds are  
to be ratfed to defray the expence  
of the public buildings (in addi-  
tion to 192,000 dollars,* given  
by the ftates of Virginia and Ma-  
ryland, for that purpofe) and to  
etfect fuch other things as it may  
be incumbent upon the public to  
do in the City. Between three  
and four thoufand Jots have been  
already fold by the commiffioners,  
aud the average price at their pub-  
lic fales has exceeded two hundred  
and forty dollars alot. . The price  
of lots has lately rifen very much,  
  
and a great increafe of price is  
expected, as the SA Wieanye  
be more inveftigated, and better  
underftood.  
  
After furnifhing very  
funds for the cemiebliiteane  
every object in the City, on the  
part of the public, a large furplus  
of lots will . remain the property  
of the City, which hereaitermay,  
and undoubtedly will be fo appli.  
ed, as to detray the annual expen.  
ces incident to the City; and the  
citizens, and their property, will  
be forever free from a heavy tax,  
which # unavoidable in othe  
large cities.  
  
Among the many adva  
which will be derived to this City  
over almoft all other large Cities,  
from the circumftance of its bei  
originally defigned for the oni  
of a great nation, may be ranked  
as the foremoft, the width of the  
ftreets, (none of which are lefs  
than ninety feet, and from that te  
one hundred and fixty,) and the  
attention which will pre  
levilliag or regulating the ftreets  
upon : general principle, in the  
firft inftance, in fuch a manner  
as to avoid any future inconveni-  
ence to fuch buildings as may be  
ereéted in the early eftablifhment  
of the City, and to give that de-  
clivity to them, in the feveral  
parts of the City, which will rea-  
dily and effeétually carry off all  
fiith in the common fewers. Thefe  
circumftances are of the higheft  
importance, as they effec the  
health and the lives of the inhabi-  
tants.  
  
Befides the advantages. which  
the city of Wajhington will have,  
from its being the feat of govern-  
ment of the United States, from  
its being within a few miles  
the center of the territory of  
Unitea States, from north to ~  
  
* Virginia 120,000, and Maryland 72,000.

and nearly the center of popula-  
‘on, and from the immediate  
  
ecommerce of the Porowmac, it will  
receive an immente benefit from  
its intercourfe with the country  
weft of the Allegeny mountains,  
through the Petowmac, which of-  
fers itfelf as the moft natural, and  
the neareft channel of commer-  
cial intercourfe with that very ex-  
tenfive and rich country.  
  
Atprefent, the land-carriage be-  
tween the navigable waters of the  
Monongahelia, (a fork of the Odio,)  
and the navigable waters of the  
Potowmac, is lefs than 40 miles;  
anda good waggon road is open  
between the two waters. Men of  
judgment on the fubject of in-  
land navigation, have examined  
the ground between the higheft  
branches of the Potowmac, and  
thofe of the O/io, and have beea  
decidedly of opinion, that the  
land carriage between the two  
places where beats may come to  
each, can be reduced to fifteen  
miles; and they have found no-  
thing to convince them, that thefe  
watersmay not, hereafter, be made  
tocommunicate with each other.  
  
The fettlers on the Ohio and  
Mififigpi, witl of courfe carry  
their heavy produce to a market  
down thofe rivers; but their re-  
turns will be moft natural through  
the Potowwmac, for they cannot af-  
cend the Wefern Waters, without  
great expence or much lofs of  
time; the current there being fo  
rapid, that a dharp boat with fix  
ears can fcarcely afvend fifteen  
miles a day.  
  
The fur and the peltry trade  
ofthe Great Lakes may be brought  
to the city of Wa/hington, through  
the channel of the Potowmac, four  
  
ndred miles nearer than to any

Virginia, mentions this fubjec&amp;  
in the following words:—* The  
Potowmac offers itfelf under the  
following circumftances, for the  
trade of the Lakes, and the waters  
weftward of Lake Erie.’ When  
it fhall have entered that Lake, it  
mutt coaftalong its fouthern fhore  
on account of the number and  
excellence of its harbours; the  
northern, though fhorteft, hav-  
ing few harbours, and thofe un-  
fate. Having reached Caya/ega,  
to proceed on to Necw- York, it  
will have eight hundred and twen-  
ty-five miles, and five- portages:  
Whereas it has but four hundred  
and twenty-five miles to diexan-  
dria, its imporium on the Porew-  
mac, if it turns into Cayahoga,  
and paffes through that, Beg Bea-  
wer, Ohio, Yohogany, (on Monon-  
gatelia and Cheat,) and the Potezw-  
mac; and there are but two port-  
ages; the firit of which, (from  
Cayahoga to Beg Beaver) may be  
  
‘removed by rec. ge fources of —  
  
thefe waters, which are lakes in  
the neighbourhood of each othez,  
and in a champaign country.—  
The other from the waters of the  
Ohio to the Potowmac, will be fron  
fifteen to forty miles, according  
to the trouble that fhall be taken  
to approach the two navigations.  
For the trade of the Odio, or that  
which fhall come into it from its  
own waters, or from the Mififinpi,  
it is nearer through the, Potowmac  
to Alexandria, than to New- York,  
by five hundred and eighty miles,  
and it is interrupted by one port-  
ageonly. There is another cir-  
cumftance of difference. The  
lakes themfelves never freeze;  
but the communications between  
them freeze, and the Hudfon’s River  
itfelt is fhutup by ice three months  
in the year; whereas the channel of  
the Che/apeak leads dire@tly to a  
  
warm climate, the fouthern parts of

In addition to the foregoing re-  
marks, it may alfo be neceffary  
to fay, that there is nota river in  
America capable of being rendered  
more fecure from an attack by  
water than the Potowmac. | Its  
banks are every where high and  
bold, wit the channel often not  
more than two hundred yards from  
the fhore. Digg’s Point, about  
ten miles below the City of Waf-  
ington, is remarkably weli caleu-  
lated for a battery; as all veffels  
coming up the river muft prefent

diftance of three miles; and after  
pafing, their fterns are~ equally

there is not more than two hund-

In the year 1791, the state of Maryland passed an act en-  
titled “an act concerning the territory of Columbia and the  
city of Washington;” the sixth section of which provides,  
“that any foreigner may, by deed or will, to be hereafter  
made, take and hold lands within that part of the said ter-

he was a citizen of this state ; and the same lands may be

his heirs or relations, as if he and they were citizens of this  
state.”  
  
This act continues in force.  
  
A decree was made by the circuit court for the sale of the  
estate of Simon Meade, deceased, to satisfy his creditors, on  
certain conditions tlerein specified. In pursuance of this  
decree, Joseph Forrest, who was appointed to carry the same  
into execution, did, on the 2Ilst of May 1821, offer the real

probably originated in the fact that the name of the owner of the estate  
was Pope, and, in selecting a name for his plantation, he fancied the title  
of “ Pope of Rome.”  
  
In his observations on the river Potomac, published in 1793, Mr. Andrew  
Ellicott, who afterwards assisted in laying out the city, remarks as follows :—  
“ No place has greater advantages of water, either for the supply of the city,  
or for cleaning the streets, than this ground. The most obvious source, is  
from the head waters of Rock Creek, which takes its rise in ground higher  
than the city, and can readily be conveyed to every part of it. But the  
grand object for this purpose, which has been contemplated by those best  
acquainted with the country hereabouts, and the circumstances attending  
it, and which has been examined with an eye to this purpose, by good  
judges, is the Potomac. The water of this river, above the great falls, four.  
teen miles from the city, is 108 feet higher than the tide-water. A small  
branch, called ‘ Watts’ Branch,’ just above the falls, goes in a direction  
towards the city. From this branch to the city, a canal may be made,  
(and the ground admits of it very well,) into which the river, or any part  
of it, may be turned, and carried through the city. By this means, the wa.  
ter may not only be carried over the highest ground in the city, but, if ne.  
cessary, over the tops of the houses.”” The advantages which woul

The question touching the removal of  
the Federal seat of government is being  
much agitated at this time. Mr. Sargeant,  
Commissioder of Customs, contends that  
Congress has no constitutional power to  
remove the seat of Government, for the  
  
reasons?  
1. That the Constitution gives Con­  
gress exclusive legislation over such dis­  
tricts (not exceeding ten miles square)  
as may by cession of particular States,  
and the acceptance of Congress, become  
the seat of Government of the United  
States.  
2. That when Virginia and Maryland  
ceded the strip of land &quot;at some place  
between the mouths of the Eastern  
Branch and Conegocheague,&quot; the same  
was, by act of Congress, accepted for the  
permanent seadt of the Government of the  
United States.
