nce, reflect on the similar cases which have happened within your own knolege, and see if ever there was a single one in which such a mode of recrimination procured favor to him who used it. you may give pain where perhaps you wish it; but be assured it will react on yourself with double tho’ delayed effect; and that it will be one of those incidents of your life on which you will never reflect with satisfaction. be advised then; erase it even from your memory, and stand erect before the world on the high ground of your own merits, without stooping to what is unworthy either of your or their notice. remember that we often repent of what we have said, but never of that which we have not. you may have time enough hereafter to mend your hold, if ever it can be mended by such matter as that. take time then, and do not commit your happiness

little girl said, “for I’m not to be kept in be­

has bought a bottle of Salvation Oil from the

New Jersey has a Baptist minister who  
claims to have baptized more people than any  
othor man in his church. The community in  
which he resides has been grieved over his

there will l&gt;e baptism in his church next  
Sunday.
