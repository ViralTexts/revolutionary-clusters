In the year 1818, I paid a visit to Mr. Jefferson, in his retirement at Monticello. During the visit, the credibility of history became a topic of conversation, and we naturally adverted to that of our own country. He spoke with great freedom of the Patriots and heroes of our revolution, and of its gloomy and brilliant periods. I will give the substance of a part of his remarks. “No correct history of that arduous struggle has yet been, or ever will be, written. The actors in important and busy scenes are too much absorbed in their immediate duty, to record events, or the motives and causes which produced them. Many secret springs, concealed even from those upon whom they operate, give an impulse to measures which are supposed to be the result of chance; and a fortuitous concurrence of causes is often attributed to the concerted plan of leaders who are themselves as much astonished as others at the events they witness. They who took an active part in those important transactions can hardly recognize them as they are related in the histories of our revolution. That of Botta, an Italian, is the best. In all of them, events are misrepresented, wrong motives are assigned—justice is seldom done to individuals, some having too much, and some too little praise. The private correspondence of three or four persons in different official stations at that time, would form the best history. I have heard that Mr. Adams is writing something on the subject. No one is better qualified than he to give the reader a correct impression of the earlier part of the contest. No history has done him justice, for no historian was present to witness his conduct in the Continental Congress.  In his zeal for independence he was ardent; in contriving expedients and originating measures he was always busy; in disastrous times, when gloom sat on the countenances of most of us, his courage and fortitide continued unabated, and his animated exhortations restored confidence to those who had wavered. He seemed to forget every thing but his country and the cause which he had espoused. I must, however, say that I a
