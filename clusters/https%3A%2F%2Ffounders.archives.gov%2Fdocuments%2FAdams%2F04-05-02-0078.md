I do not see why a subject which appears from all your Letters to have taken such a full possession of your mind, should appear become to you so impracticable. Return with peace to your Native Land, set yourself down with a fixed resolution to persue your profession; and I dare say success will crown your endeavours. There is more good to be done in Life, says a judicious observer of Humane Nature, by obstinate diligence and perseverence, than most people seem aware of. The Ant and Bee are but little and weak animals; and yet, by constant application they do wonders. It is an observation of Plinys that no Mans abilities are so remarkably shining, as not to stand in need, of a proper opportunity, a patron, and even the praises of a Friend to recommend them to the Notice of the World.

Deal gently with every nature; it may be  
your lot to suffer wrong and others may smooth  
or rough the hours as they please. How much  
of error blossoms under uncharitable eyes;  
how much unhappiness springs from coldness  
and unforgiveness. Therefore be merciful for
