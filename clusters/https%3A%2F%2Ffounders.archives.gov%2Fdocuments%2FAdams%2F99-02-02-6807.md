Dear Sir  
Quincy Oct 1. 1817  
  
Mr J. A Smiths appointment was not by J. Q. A but by the President “Sancte Socrate ora pro nobis” Said Erasmus on reading the Doctrine of Socrates so like the christian. My memory does not recollect the place in Plato and my Eyes cannot look it. But as Plato learned all he taught in Egypt and India, I choose “petere fontes.”  
I am of Sir William Jones’s Mind that “Our divine Religion, has no need of such Aids, as many are willing to give it, by asserting, that the wisest Men of this world were ignorant of the two great maxims, that We must act, in respect of others, as We Should wish them to act in respect of Ourselves, and that instead of returning Evil for Evil, We should confer benefits even on those who injure Us: but the first rule is implied in a Speech of Lyscias, and expressed in distinct Phrases by Thales and Pittacus, and I have even Seen it Word for Word in the Original of Confucius, which I carefully compared with the Latin translation It has been usual with zealous men, to ridicule and abuse all those who dare on this point, to quote the Chinese Philosopher; but instead of supporting their cause; they would Shake it if it could be shaken by their uncandid Asperity; for they ought to remember, that one great end of Revelation, as it is most expressly declared, was not to instruct the wise and few, but the many and unenlightened. If the Conversion, therefore, of the Pandits and Maulavis in this country Shall ever be attempted by Protestant Missionaries, they must beware of asserting, while they teach the Gospel of Truth, what those Pandits and Maulavis would know to be false: the former would cite the beautiful Arya couplet, which was written at least three Centuries before our Era, and which pronounces the duty of a good man, even in the moment of his destruction to consist not only in forgiving, but even in a desire of benefiting his destroyer, as the Sandal tree, in the instant of its Overthrow, Sheds perfume on the Axe, which fells it; and the latter would  triumph in repeating the Verse of Sadi, who represents a return of Good for Good as a Slight reciprocity, but Says to the virtuous man “Confer benefits on the man who has injured thee,” using an Arabic Sentence and a Maxim apparently of the ancient Arabs. Nor would the Muselmans fail to recite four distichs of Hafiz, who has illustrated that Maxim by fanciful but elegant Allusions  
“Learn from yon Orient Shell to love thy Foe,  
And Store with Pearls the hand that brings thee Woe  
Free, like yon Rock, from base vindictive Pride  
In blaze with Gems, the Wrist that rends thy Side  
Mark where yon Tree rewards the Stony Shower  
With fruit nectarious, or the balmy Flow’r  
All Nature calls aloud “Shall Man do less  
Than heal the Smiter, and the Railer bless.”?  
Now there is not a Shadow of a reason for believing, that the Poet of Shiraz had borrowed this doctrine from the Christians.”

are to be traced to very early epochs of eastern history. In an  
admirable couplet, written as Sir W. Jones assures us, at least  
three centuries before the Christian era, the duty of a good man  
is pronounced to consist, even in the moment of his destruction,  
not only in forgiving, but even in a desire of benefiting his  
destroyer ; a divine injunction, and finely urged by the figure of  
the sandal-tree, which sheds perfume on the axe which fells it.  
The same thought is softly bodied forth by Hafiz, with a richness  
  
and delicacy of imagery worthy of Lucretius—  
  
* The celebrated fables which have been in circulation under the names of  
Pilpay and sop, were derived from the Heeto-pades, a work long known, and  
in the highest estimation in the East. ba

An eminent poet has the following beautiful sentiment : ‘It is the  
duty of every good man, even in the moment of his destruction, not  
merely to forgive, but to seek and desire to serve and benefit, his de-  
stroyer; as the sandal tree, in the instant of its overthrow, sheds a sweet  
perfume upon the axe which fells it.’ To the same effect is the follow-  
ing of Aristippus: ‘It discovers peculiar excellence in a man, to  
bear good-will even toward those from whom he has received insults.’  
The maxims of Confucius, the proverbs of Solomon, and the pre-  
cepts and reflections of many others, convince us that the principles  
of morals have always been the same, or nearly so. It would appear  
doubtful whether this science has been improved by the progress o

Society of Calcutta. “If,” ho said, “tho conversion of the Pandits and  
Maulavis in this country shall ever be attempted by Protestant Mission-  
aries, they must beware of asserting, while they teach the Gospel of  
Truth, what those Pandits and Maulayis would know to be false. The  
former would cite the beautiful Aryan couplet which was written at  
least three centuries before our era, and which pronounces the duty, of  
a good man, even in the moment of his destruction, to consist ‘ not only  
in forgiving, but even in a desire of benefiting his destroyer, as the  
sandal-tree in the instant of its overthrow sheds perfume on the axe

of Sadi which represents ‘a return of good for good as a slight re-  
ciprocity,’ but says to the virtuous man, ‘Confer benefits on him who  
has injured thee,’ using an Arabic sentence, and a maxim apparently of  
the ancient Arabs. Nor would the Mussulmans fail to recite four  
distichs of Hafiz, who has illustrated that maxim with fanciful but  
elegant allusions :—
