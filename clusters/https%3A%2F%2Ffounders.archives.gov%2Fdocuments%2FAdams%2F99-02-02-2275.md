A brief investigation of the Question “Was France or England the first beginner of the measures pursued since 1792, to spoliate the commerce of the United States.  
It has been asserted, and, by many, believed, “that the Government of France has an indisputable title to the culpable pre-eminence of having taken the lead in the violation of neutral rights, the first instance on the part of the British Government(refering to the order of the 8th. June 1793) “being nearly a month posterior to the Commencement of the evil by France” (refering to the Decree of the Convention of the 9th May 1793) These are the words, in which that charge has been brought against the French Government by the writer of a series of papers in the Gazette of the United States, entituled “The Warning” signed “Americus”. These papers are manifestly written by a person very minutely informed concerning the transactions of our Government, and have been considered as the productions of the late Secretary of the Treasury. If that be the fact, it is of great importance, because of the large share he is known to have taken in the executive Business, out of the line of the Department and in the publications upon the conduct of the two foreign powers with whom we have had the greatest relations.  
It is an important matter of observation, that a similar way of thinking seems to have existed in the mind of the present Secretary of State, immediately before the publication of “The Warning” refered to above; for in his report of the 27 February 1797; page 7; he observes: “It may be proper to remark here that this decree of the Convention” (that of the 9th May 1793 mentioned in his next preceding sentence) “directing the Capture of neutral vessels laden with provisions and destined for enemy ports, preceded by one Month the order of the British Government &amp;ca.” refering to that of June 8th. 1793. It is true, that there is no assertion, that either that British act, or that French act is the leading act of violation committed by England and France upon the neutral commerce, but the passage unavoidably carries the idea to the reader and has  occasioned some, who have not examined the subject to believe, that the Secretary of State has exhibited a proof that “France” (in the language of Americus,) “has really taken the lead in the violation of neutral rights.”  
It is always highly important to take a just view of the conduct of nations, which are competitors for our friendship &amp; particularly when we are promulgating an official Notice of the deportment of one of them, which is in a state of disagreement with us.  
There is among the records of the department of State clear and positive Evidence, that England had deliberately adopted the System of violating the neutral commerce above a month before the French Decree of the 9th of May. This evidence seems to have escaped the Notice or recollection of the Secretary of state and of the writer of the Investigation in the United States Gazette. Our late Minister in London communicated to our Secretary of State, in his letter of the 5th. July 1793, that Lord Grenville had explicitly and unreservedly avowed, that the Captures of neutral vessels, as directed by the British order of the 8th. of June 1793 to that End, were fully understood by both Russia and Great Britain to be within the intention of the convention between them, which was signed by those two parties at London on the 25th. day of March 1793.  From the extraordinary Nature of that Convention between Russia and Great Britain, from the distance between Petersburg and London, and from the Season of the year, it cannot be doubted, that this important contract, which was  completely matured and signed on the 25th of March, must have been originated in 1792 by the Empress &amp; the British King. In all the correspondence between our Secretary of State and Mr. Pinckney and in all the conferences and Notes between the British Secretary of State and our Minister in London, we do not perceive the least suggestion of the the influence of the example of the french Decree of the 9th. of May. Such a plea could not be made by Lord Grenville, who knew and avowed, that Great Britain had bound herself by a solemn compact, to obseve the very conduct of which the neutral powers complained. He and their Minister here (Mr. Hammond) have perseveringly maintained, that it was regular and right under the law of Nations. The British Government no doubt gave their first orders to the Commanders of their Ships as soon as the Convention with Russia was signed: and it is to be presumed that the known detentions of neutral vessels in their ports, and the Captures of such Vessels, which the French Government assigns as justifying reasons, were made in consequence of that convention and of those first orders.

l Instructions”. The English Secretary adhered to their right to adopt such measures in his negociations with our Envoy (Mr. Jay) and in the formation of the existing Treaty with the United States. It is not perceived therefore in which what Manner the French Decree of May 1793 can have produced this conduct of Great Britain.  
France acted a very unwarrantable and imprudent part in her decree of May 1793. But having an immense population to support, and with a prodigious band of sailors and soldiers to feed, almost completely shut in on the land side by the hostile Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Spain, expecting no Grain from the swarming hive of Switzerland and closely watched by the inimical Fleets of Russia, Sweden, Holland, England, Spain Portugal and the Italian states, her just apprehensions of a ruinous and distracting famine (This is made a particular consideration in the remonstrance of Mr. Chauvelin. Jany 7. 1793) appear to have been quicken’d by the instances of Capture, some of which are particularized, and others of which are expressly, tho generally noticed, in the Decree of the Convention. Altho these circumstances are absolutely insuffici

y and rightful Navigation, the sales of their most valueable commodities, their supplies of foreign comforts, and necessaries, and the dependent revenues from exports and imports. If Portugal should become involved in the present War, England and her Allies, acting upon this principle, would suspend the accustomed and lawful Commerce of the United States with one half of the civilized world, and France, too ready to follow the example and prompted by Notions of interest and necessity, would suspend our rightful Commerce with the other half. In these views, the Convention of 1793 between Russia &amp; Great Britain, as unreservedly and clearly explained by Lord Grenville to Mr. Pinckney, is a matter of the most transcendant Importance to the Uni

Great Britain of similar import ” The ve  
ry reverse of this statement is true—that  
England was undoubtedly the first begin­  
ner of the measures pursued since 1792, to  
spoliate the commerce of the United States.  
The following is an extract from an inves­  
tigation of thi9 subject, which appeared in  
1798.  
&quot;There is among the records of the de­  
partment of state, clear and fiositive evi­  
dence, that England had deliberately ma­  
tured and consummated the system pf vio­  
lating the neutral commerce above a month  
before the French decree of tne 9th of May,  
1793. Our late minister in London, Mr.  
Pinckney, communicated to our secretary of  
state, in his letter of the. 5th July, 1793,  
that lord Grenville had explicitly and un­  
reservedly avowed, that the captures of neu­  
tral vessels, as directed by the British or­  
der of the 8th June, 1793, to that end, were  
fully understood by both Russia and Great  
Britain, to be within the intention of the  
convention between them, which was sign­  
ed by those two governments at London, on  
the 25tli day of March, 1793. From the  
extraordinary nautieof that convention be­  
tween Russia and Great Britain, from the  
  
distance between Pvtersburgh and London, i  
aiul from the season ot the year, it cannot !  
be doubted, mat this important contract,  
which Was rna tul y signed on the 25th of  
March, must have been originated in I  
the summer of 17.)3, by tiie empress and i  
the British king. In ali the correspondence *  
between our secretary of state and Mr.  
Pinckney, and. in the conferences and notes  
between the British secretary of state and­  
our minister in Louden, we do not perceive  
the least suggestion of the influence of the  
example of the French decree of the 9ih  
ot May, 17P3. Such a plea could net pos-1  
sibly be made by lord Grenville who knew  
and avowed, that Great Britain had f ound  
herself by a solemn compact with Russia,  
to observe the very conduct of which the  
neutral powers complained. Lord Gren­  
ville, and the British minister here (Mr.  
Hammond) have, in their written commu­  
nications, uniformly maintained, that it was  
regular and right, under the law of nations.  
The British government, no doubt, gave  
their first orders to the commanders of their  
ships, as soon as the convention with Rus­  
sia was signed, that is, in March 1793: 8e  
it is to be presumed, that the known de­  
tentions of neutral vessels in the British  
ports, so early as the autumn df 1792, and  
the captures of neutral vessels, which the  
French government assign as the justifying  
reasons of their act of May 1793, were  
made in consequence of the negociatioi and  
completion of taat convention and of those  
first ordersf.”

&#x27; There is among the records  
of the Department of i)tate, clear  
add positive evidehce.tnat England  
had deliberately matured and coti  
sunimattd the syst m of violating  
the neutral commerce above a  
month before the Fr ench decree of  
rhe 9th of May, 1793. Our late  
Minister in Ltntion, Mr. Pinck­

Vessels, as directed by the British  
order of the tith&#x27; June, 179J, tuthit

within the intention of.the conven  
tion between them, and tvas signed  
by those two governments at Lon

1793. From the extraordinary na.  
ture of that convention between  
Russia and Great Britain, from the.  
distance between Petersburgh and  
London, and front the season ot  
the year, it cannot be doubte&#x27;d, th.lt  
this important contract, which was  
nutualh signed on the 25th oi

ginated in the summer of 1792, by
