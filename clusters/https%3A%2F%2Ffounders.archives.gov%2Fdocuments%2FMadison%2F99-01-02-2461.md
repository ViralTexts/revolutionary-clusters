December 23, 1807  
					  
					This is a strong measure proceeding from the energy of the public councils, appealing to the patriotism of their constituents, and is of all measures the one peculiarly adapted to the crisis. The honest judgment of all parties has anticipated and called for  
						it.  
					The measure could no longer, in fact, be delayed without sacrificing the vital interests of the nation.  
					Great-Britain by interpolations into the maritime code operating on her enemies through the violated rights of neutrals, furnished an occasion which was seized by the French government for the decree of November 1806, interdicting commerce with G. Britain,  
						which was adopted by the allies of France, particularly by Spain, in her decree of February 1807.  
					The decree of November was followed by the retaliating British order of January 1807, making war on all neutral trade usually carried on from the ports of one enemy to those of another.  
					France, again seconded by Spain and other allies, is retaliating on this order, by new constructions extending their decrees to all trade from British territories or in British articles.  
					And it is clear that if not already done, G. Britain meditates further retaliations, most probably an interdict of all trade by this country, (now the only neutral one) with the enemies of G. Britain, that is to say with the whole commercial world.  
					To these destructive operations against our commerce, is to be added the late proclamation of G. Britain on the subject of seamen. This extraordinary instrument, instead of relinquishing the pretension with respect to alledged deserters on board national ships, extends it to all British seamen on board; varying only the mode of process, from that used by Berkely, to a redress to be obtained by the government itself. And with  
						respect to seamen on board merchant vessels, the proclamation has made it the duty of all her sea officers to search for and seize all such as they may call British natives; whether wanted or not for the service of their respective ships. From  
						the proportion of American citizens heretofore taken under the name of British seamen, may be calculated the number of victims to be added by this formal sanction to the claim of British officers, and the conversion of that claim into a duty.  
					Thus the ocean presents a field only where no harvest is to be reaped but that of danger, of spoliation and of disgrace.  
					Under such circumstances the best to be done is what has been done; a dignified retirement within ourselves; a watchful preservation of our resources; and a demonstration to the world, that we possess a virtue and a patriotism which can take any shape that  
						will best suit the occasion.  
					It is singularly fortunate that an embargo, whilst it guards our essential resources, will have the collateral effect of making it the interest of all nations to change the system which has driven our commerce from the ocean.  
					Great Britain will feel it in her manufactures, in the loss of naval stores, and above all in the supplies essential to her colonies; to the number of which she is adding by new conquests.  
					France will feel it in the loss of all those colonial luxuries, which she has hitherto received through our neutral commerce; and her colonies will at once be cut off from the sale of their productions, and the source of their supplies.  
					Spain will feel it, more perhaps than any, in the failure of imported food, not making enough within herself, and in her populous and important colonies which depend wholly on us for the supply of their daily wants.  
					It is a happy consideration also attending this measure that although it will have these effects, salutary it may be hoped, on the policy of the great contending nations, it affords neither of them the slightest ground for complaint. The embargo violates  
						the rights of none. Its object is to secure ourselves. It is a measure of precaution, not of aggression. It is resorted to by all nations, when their great interests require it. All of them have made us on different occasions feel the effects of such a resort on our  
						commercial interests. And it could be the less murmured at, by those who may be incidentally affected by the present embargo; inasmuch as they have forced us into the measure, by the direct effect on us, of measures founded in an alledged  
						regard for their own eventual safety and essential interests.  
					But may not the embargo bring on war from some of the nations affected by it? Certainly not; if war be not predetermined on against us. Being a measure of peace and precaution; being universal, and therefore impartial; extending in reality as well as  
						ostensibly to all nations, there is not a shadow of pretext to make it a cause of war. War, therefore, let it be repeated, cannot be the result; unless it be in pursuance of a predetermined plan of hostility against this country.  
					Will it not be an impediment to amicable negociations with nations with which we have unsettled differences? Not more than any other precaution; not more certainly than military preparations, with which depending negociations are frequently accompanied, and  
						sometimes professedly armed. The policy of President Washington sent Mr. Jay into negociation, with an embargo in his hand. Would the treaty he made have been the worse, if the embargo had not been rescinded?  
					Might not the embargo have been better modified? Might not, particularly, the vessels of the several foreign nations have been allowed to carry on trade from our ports?  
					The plausibility of such an exception vanishes at once, when tested by its inevitable and inadmissible consequences.  
					1. It would have given so decided and exclusive an advantage to one of the belligerent parties, that it would have been difficult to justify it to the others. Great Britain, having the command of the sea and the means of conveyance, would have supplied her  
						wants, whilst her enemies, having neither, would be left destitute.  
					2. Having the monopoly of our market, her agents would obtain supplies at half their value.  
					3. The competition to sell to them, would have made every purchase a favor, and consequently a source of dreadful influence.  
					4. Our mariners thrown out of employment, would have been easily enticed into foreign service, never probably to be regained. Our ships might perhaps be bought up at the same time for half their value, and be lost to the nation.  
					5. In fine the exception, thus operating in favor of Great Britain, would have done what above all things she would have wished. It would have given her a monopoly of the trade of the world; would have secured all her supplies on the best terms, whilst her  
						enemies and rivals would go without altogether; and to crown the whole, it would without the benefit of more than a very scanty market for our produce, have given her the greatest possible interest in persevering in those regulations, and prolonging that state of things,  
						which forms the present afflicting crisis to this country.  
					The embargo then is the best expedient in its best form. It has been recommended by the President, who has the best means of knowing the policy of foreign governments, and it has been adopted by Congress, who are alone able to provide in such cases for the  
						security of the public rights and interests: adopted almost unanimously by the Senate, and by as large a majority in the House of Representatives, as is to be expected in any case, where an honest difference of opinion may be added to the habitual opposition of party  
						spirit.  
					All that remains then for a people confiding in their government is to rally round the measure which that government has adopted for their good, and to secure its just effect, by patently and proudly submitting to every inconvenience which such a measure  
						necessarily carries with it.

EMBARGO.  
This is a strong measure proceeding from

ties has anticipated and called for it.

Great-Rritain by interpolations into the  
maritime code operating on her enemies  
through the violated rights of neutrals, fur­  
nished an occasion v.-hich was seized by the  
French government for the decree of Novem­  
ber 1806, interdicting commerce with G.  
Britain, which was adopted by the allies of  
France, particularly by Spain in her decree  
oi rebruary 1F07.  
&#x27;i&#x27;he decree of November was followed by  
tue retaliating British order of January 1807,  
making war on all neutral trade usually car­  
ried on from the ports of one ’enemy to’those  
cf another.  
Trance, again seconded by Spain and o­  
ther allies, is retalliating on this order, bv  
new constructions extending their decrees to  
all trade from British territories or in Bri­  
tish articles.  
^ And it is clear that if not already done,  
VT- Britain meditates further retaliations,  
most probably an interdict of all trade by this  
j country, (now the only neutral one) with the

To these destructive operations against  
I onr commerce, is to be added the late pro­  
i (.tarnation of G. Britain on the subject of

stead ot relinquishing the pcetention with  
respect to alledged deserters on board nati­  
onal shifts, extends it to all British seamen  
on hoard; varying only the mode of process,  
ir-i-ii that used by Bevkely, to a redress to be

j respect to seamen on board merchant ves­  
i s;ls&gt; t,lc proclamation has made it the duty  
ot all her sea officers to search for andsieze  
ail such as they may call British natives *  
whether wanted or not for the service of their  
I respecive ships. From the proportion of A­  
merican citizens heretofore taken under the  
i oaine of British seamen, may be calculated  
I tl&gt;£ number of victims to be added by this for­  
; mal sanction to the claim of British officers,  
; and the conversion of that claim into a du­  
! nr*  
Thus the ocean presents a field only where  
, no harvest is to be reaped but that of danger,

j Under such circumstances the best to be  
l done is what has been done ; a dignified re­  
; tiremcnt within ourselves ; a watchful pre­

I tion to the world, that we possess a virtue

It is singularly fortunate that an cmbar­  
1 go, whilst it guards ohr essential resoui&#x27;ccs,  
i )v l11 have the collateral effect of making it the

Grcat-Britain will feel i*. in her manufac­

, all in the supplies essential to her colonies ;  
to the number of which she is adding by new

! colonial luxuries Which she has hitherto re­  
jected through our neutral commerce; and  
iIlcr colonics will at once he cut off from the  
j -ale of their productions, and the source of  
I their supplies.  
bpain will feel it, more perhaps than any,  
i,n the failure of imported food, not making  
enough within herse.f, and in her populous  
| and important colonies which depend wholly  
• orus for the supply of their dai.y wants.  
I It is a happy consideration also attending  
, this measure that although it will have these  
ieffects, salutary it maybe hoped, on thepo­

neither of them the slightest ground for com­  
! plaint. The embargo violates the riv-hts nf  
  
none. Its object is to secure ourselves. It is  
a measure of precaution, not of aggression.  
It is retorted to by all nations, when their  
.greatinterests require it. All of them have  
made us on (liferent occasions feel the effects  
of such a resort on our commercial interests.  
And it could be the less murmured at, by  
i those who may be incidentally affected by the  
j present embargo; inasmuch as they have  
forced us into the measure, by the direct ef­  
fect on us, of measures founded in an alleged  
regard for their own eventual safety and es­  
sential interests.  
•j Bat may not the embargo bring on war from  
r.omc of the nations affected by it ? Certain­  
ly not ; if war be not predetermined on a­  
gaiftstus. Being a measure of peace and pre­  
| caution ; being universal, Rnd therefore im­  
partial ; extending in reality as well as os­  
&#x27;i.lensihly to all nations, there is not a.shadow  
r/ pretext to make it a cause of war. War,  
therefore, let it be repeated, cannot be the  
result; unless it he in pursuance of a prede­

1. It would have given so decided and ex­

the command of the sea and the means of

whilst her enemies, having neither, would be  
left destitute.  
2. Having the monopoly of our market, her  
agents would obtain supplies at half their va­

3. The competition to srr 11 to them, would

Our ships might perhaps be .bought up utthc

*  
EMllABGO.  
This is a strong measure proceeding from the  
energy of the publick councils, appealing tothepa­  
| tnotismof their constituents, ami is of.nil measures  
the one pertili trly adapted to the ciisis. 1 he honest  
judgment of all parties has anticipated and called  
lor it.  
&#x27;I he measure could no longer, in fact, he delayed  
without sacrificing the vital interests of the na­  
tion.  
Great Britain by interpolations into the mari­  
time code operating upon her enemies through th  
violated rights of neutrals, furnished an occasion  
which was seized by the french government lor the  
decree ol November 1800’, interdicting commerce  
with Great Britain, which was adopted by the al  
lies of France, particularly by Spain, in her decree  
of February 1807.  
The decree of November was followed by the re­  
taliating British order of January 1807, making war  
on all neutral trade usually carriede on from the  
ports ol one enemy to those of another.  
France, again seconded by Spain and other allies,  
is retaliating on this order, by new constructions ex­  
tending their decrees to all trade from British terri­  
tories or in British articles. * ‘  
And it is clear that if not already done, Great­  
Bi ituin meditates further retaliations, most probably  
an interdict of all trade by tins country, [now the  
only neutral one] with the enemies uf Great Il»i­  
tain, that is ta say with the whole commercial  
world.  
To these destructive operations against our com­  
merce, is to be added the late proclamation of  
Great Britain on the subject of seamen. This ex­  
traordinary instrument, instead of relinquishing the  
pretensions wilh respect to ailedged deserters on  
board national ships, extends it to all British sea­  
men onboard ; varying only the mode ot process,  
from that used by Berkeley, to a redress to be ob­  
tained by the government itself. And wilh respect  
  
to seamen on hoard merchant vesst Is, the proclamati­  
,,n lns nn;de u &lt;&gt;&quot;&#x27;} •&gt;( all her sea officers to  
stMich lor and seize all such as they may&#x27;.call Bri­  
iish natives ; whether wanted or not !„r tin service  
ol tlier respective ships. From the proportion of  
American citizens heretofore taken under the name  
,|f British seamen, may be calculated li t- mania rot&quot;  
victims to he ark-led by th» formal sanction to the  
&#x27;■hum of British officers, and the conversion of that  
claim into a duty.  
Thus the ocean presents a. field only where no  
harvest is to he reaped hut that of danger, of spoli­  
ation and of disgrace.  
I mler such i ircumstances the best to he done is  
what has been done ; a dignified retirement within  
ourselves ; a watchlul preservation of our resources ;  
iml a demonstration to the world, that we possess a  
virtue and a patriotism which rati take any shape  
that will best sun the orcasion.  
It is singularly fortunate that an embargo, whilst  
. it guards our essential resouires, will have the col­  
lateral effect of making it the interest ol all nations  
to change the system which has driven our com­  
merce trom the ocean.  
Great Britain will feel it in her manufactures, in  
the loss ol naval stores, and above all in the supplies  
essential to hei colonies; to the number of which  
she is adding by new conquests.  
1-re.nee Will iei 1 it m the loss of all those colonial  
Iumii n s, w hit h she has hitherto received ihnui’h  
our neutral commerce ; and her colonies will at  
once he cut off 1mm the sale of their productions,  
and llie source ol their Siumlirs.  
  
Spain will leel it, more perhaps than any, in the  
tailuieot imported loud, nut making enough within  
lit iM ii. and in her populous and important colonies  
whirli d&lt;’j&#x27;( nu wholly on us lor the supply of their  
daily wants.  
It is a happy consideration also attending this  
measure that although it will have these elferls, sa­  
lutary it may be hoped, on the policy of the &#x27;Meat  
contending natiuns, it adorns math&#x27;r ol them the  
slightest ground for roniphiint. The embatgo vm­  
lat* s the lights ol none. Its objer t is to secure  
out selves. It is a measure ot precaution, not nt&quot; ag­  
gression. It is resorted to by all nations, when their  
meat interests inquire it. &#x27;.\1! ol ihem have made  
us on didernu occasions fee] the etVerisnl&#x27; such a re­  
sort on micro.u-ividl interests. And it could he  
tlic less iniiriniired at, hv those who may he inci­  
dentally aborted !»y the present embaigo ; inasmuch  
as thu y lutve Ion eri us into the measure, hy the di­  
reef died on ns, ol meacuves founded in .in alleged  
ieg.11 d lor t hcni own t.cai:1 Ut salcly and essential m­  
ter-sts.  
I’ut may not the embargo bring on war from  
“nine ol the nations aliened by it? Certainly not ;  
H war be not preiietemuned on against us. luma it  
measure ol peace and precaution ; bemgumvtrs.il,  
mil theiefore impartial ; exienomg in reaht&#x27;v as  
wi ll as ostensibly to till nations, tliere is not a sha­  
&quot;&#x27;W &quot;I pi &#x27;text to make it a cause of war. W ar,  
! lierclnit&#x27;. lit it be ii-pealed, cannot be tie result ;  
mless it be m pursuance ot a predetermined plan of  
i&#x27;&lt;»k&#x27;tiiitv against tins country.  
W ill it not be an imp aliment to amicable negori­  
,!l&quot;ii&#x27; will) nations with which we h ive uriseuied  
,i ;a i nu es ?— Not more than any otliei pr. caution ;  
not more reitainly than military preparations, with  
which depending iiegornilions are fr ipunliv ac­  
j coinpaiu. d. and sometimes professedly armed. The  
j policy ol President Washington sent Mr. Jay into  
j teg&quot;&#x27;nation, with an embargo in his hand. W ould

est possible interest persevering m those regulations,  
and prolonging that slat&quot; ot things, whirli foitns

1 he embargo then is tjie best expedient in ils

The decree of November was followed by  
the retaliating Britith order of January 1807,  
makirg war on all neutral trade usually car­  
ried ou from the ports of one enemy to those  
of another.  
France, again seconded by Spain and other  
allies, is retaliating on this order, by new con­  
structions extending their decrecs to all trade  
from British territories or in Britith articles.  
And it is clear that if not already done, G.  
Britain meditates further reraliations, molt  
probably an inzerdict of all trade by this coun­  
try, (now the only neutral one) with the en­  
emics of G. Britain, that is to fay with the  
whole commercia! world.  
To these deftruive operations against our  
eommerce, is to be added the late prociama­  
tion of G. Brttain on the fubje&amp;t of seamen.  
Phis extraordinary instrument, inflead of re-  
Jicquithing the pretensions with refpet to al­  
ledged deserters on boara national ships, extends  
it to all Britith seamen on board ; varying on­  
1y the mode of &quot;process, from that used by  
Berkely, to a&#x27;fedrefs to be obtained by the  
government itfeif. And with respect to fca­  
men on board merchant vefiels, the procla­  
mation has made it the duty of all her sea of­  
ficers te search for and seize all such as they  
may call Britith natives; whether wanted or  
not for the service of their refpeive {hips.  
From the proportion of American citizens  
herctofore taken uader the name of Britith  
seamen, may be calculated the number of vic­  
tims to be added by this formal fan&amp;ion to  
the claim of Biitifh officers, and the conver­  
tion of that claim into a duzy.  
Thus the ocean presents a fiell only where  
no harvest is to be reaped bat that of danger,  
of {pohatien and of digrace.  
Under such circumitanecs, the best to be  
  
done 1s what has been done ; a dignified re­  
tirement.within ourselves 5 a watchful preser­  
vation of our refonrces ; and a demonstration  
to the world, that we poflefs a wvirtue and a  
patriotism which can take any thape that will  
best {uit the occasion.  
It is singularly fortunate that an embargo,  
whilst it guards our cflential resources, will  
have the collateral effeét of making it the in­  
terefis of zll mnations to change the {yftem  
which has driven our commerce from the  
ocean.  
Great Britain will feel it in her manufac­  
tures, in the loss of naval stores, and above all  
in the {upplies cflential to her colontes; to  
the number of which she isadding by new  
conquellss  
France will feel it in the lofs&#x27; of all those  
colonial fuxuries, which fiec has hitherto re­  
ceived through our ncutral commerce; and  
her colonics will at once be cut off from the  
sale of their productions, and the source of  
their fupplics.  
Spaia will feel it more, perbaps than anv, in  
the failare of imported food, not making e­  
nougzh withia herfelf, and ipn her populous and  
important colonies which depend wholly on  
us for the supply of their daily waants,  
It.is a happy consideration also attending  
this measure, that aithough it will have these  
effects, salutary it may be hoped, on the pol­  
icy of the great contending nations, it affords  
ncither of them the flightcft ground for com­  
plaint. The embargo violates the rights of  
none. Its objecs is to secure ourselves. It  
s a measure of precaution, not of aggreflion.  
It is resorted to by all nations, when their  
great interests require it. All of them have  
made us on differcat occasions fee!l the effe@s  
of such a resort on our comimercial interefls.  
Aand it could be the less murmured at, by  
those who may be incidentally affe&amp;ed by  
the present embargo ; inasmuch as they have  
forced us into the measure by the dizef? effe&amp;k  
on us, of measures founded in an alledged re­  
gard for their own eventual fafety and essential  
intereits.  
But may not the embargo bring en war  
from some of the nations affected by it ? Cer­  
staiuly not ; if war be not predetermined on  
against us. Being a mealure of peace and  
precaution ; being universal, and therefore  
impartial | extending in reality as well as os­  
tensibly to all nations, there is not a shadow of  
pretext to make it ‘a cause of war. War,  
N therefore let it be repeated, cannot be the re­  
sult; ualefs it be in pursuance of a predeter­  
mined plan of hoftilty against this country.  
Wil it not be an impediment te amicable  
negociations with nations with which we have  
unsettled diffcrences ?—Not more than any  
other precautien ; not mere, certainly, than  
military preparations, with which depending  
negociations are frequently accompanied, and  
sometimes profefledly armed. The policy of  
President Wathington sent Mr. Jay into nego­  
ciation with an embargo in his hand. Would  
-the treaty be made have beea the worse, if  
the embargo had not been rescinded ? &#x27;  
The embargo then is the best expedient in  
its best form. It has been recommended by  
the President, who has the best means of  
knowing the policy of foreign governments,  
and it has becn adopted by Congress, who zre  
alone able to provide in such cases for the se­  
curity of the public rights and interefls; a­  
dopted almost unanimously by the Senate, and  
by as large a majority in the Houle of Repre­  
sentatives as is to be expected in any case,  
where an honest difference of opinion may be  
added to the habitual opposition of party spirit.  
-~ All that remains then for a people confid~  
ing in their government is to rally round the  
‘meafure which that government has adopt­  
ed for their good, and to secure its jult effe,  
_by patiently and proudly fubwmitting to every  
inconvenience which such a measure necefla­  
nily cargies with it.

The measure could co longed &#x27;in fact1, fte delaecf  
without Sicrfficinjr the Vital interests of the nation.  
Great-Bntain, Hy interpolation on the maritime  
code, operating on ner enemies by the violated rights  
of neutrals, furnished an occasion which was seised  
by the French government, for the decree of Nov  
i 800, Interdicting commerce frith G. Britain, which  
was adopted by the allies of France, pojticulafly by  
  
Spain, in her decree of February, l&amp;07k -  
  
Toe uecree of November was Followed by the re­  
taliating British order df janj IGOTj making war  
on all neutral trade usually carried on from theports  
of one enemy to those of another.  
France, again seconded by Spain and thetailiea,  
is retaliating on this order, by new constructions ex­  
tending their decrees, to all trade from British ter­  
ritories or in British articlei  
And it is clear that if not already done, G- Bri­  
tain meditates further retaliations, ;most probably an  
interdict cf all trade from this country (now the on­  
ly neutral one) with the enemies of G Britain, that  
is to say, with the whole commercial worid.  
To these destructive opcrurions against our cbtu­  
merce, is to be Added the late proclamation of G.  
Britain on the subject of seamen. This extraordi­  
nary instrument, instead of relinquishing the pretcn-.  
tioh with respect to allcdged deserters on board a­  
t &#x27;unalikipiy extends it to all British seamen on board ;  
varying only the node of process from that used by  
Bcrkely, to a redress obtained by the government  
itself. And with respect to seamen op board mer­  
chant Vessels, the proclamation has made it thc .wy  
of all her sea officers to search for and seize. all Br)  
tisli natives ; whether wanted or not for the seryice  
of their respective ships Trom thei proportion of  
American citizens heretofore taken under the name  
of British seamen,&quot; may be calculated the number of  
victims to be added by this formal sanction to the  
claim of British officers, and the. conversion of that  
claim into a duty. .  
Thus the ocan presents a Geld only where no  
harvest is to be reaped but that of danger, of spolia­  
tion and of disgrace.  
Under such circumstances the best to be done is  
what has been done ; a dignified retirement within;  
ourselves j a watchful preservation of our resources ;  
  
and a demonstration to the world, that we posses  
a virtue and a patriotism which can take any shape  
that will best suit the occasion.  
It is singularly fortunate that an embargo, whilst ii  
guards&quot; our essentia! resources) will have the collateral  
effect of making it the interest of all nations to change  
the system which has driven our commerce fiom the  
ocean. .  
G. Britain will feel it in her manufactures, in the loss  
  
bT naval stores, and above all, in the supplies essentia  
  
to lier colonies ; to the number of which she is adding  
bynew coijjuests.: -

luxuries, Which she has hitherto received through bu  
neutral commerce : and her roltsnie will - nn. k

‘* This is a strong measure, proceeding from the energy  
of the public councils, appealing to the patriotism of their  
constituents, and is of all measures the one peculiarly  
adapted to the crisis. The honest judgment of all parties  
has aiticipated and called for it.  
  
‘* The measure could no longer, in fact, be delayed  
without sacrificing the vital interests of the nation.  
  
‘* Great Britain, by interpolations into the Maratime  
Code operating oa her enemies through the violated rights  
of neutrals, furnished an occasion which was seized by the  
French Government for the Decree of November, 1806,  
interdicting commerce with Great Britain, which was  
adopted by the Allies of France, particularly by Spain,  
in her Decree of February, 1807.  
  
‘* The Decree of November was followed by the reta-  
liating British Order of January, 1807, making war on  
all neutral trade usually carried on from the ports of one  
enemy to those of another.  
  
‘* France, again seconded by Spair and other Allies, is  
retaliating on this Order, by new constractiors extending  
their Decrees to all trade from British territories er in  
British articles,  
  
‘** And it is clear that if not already done, Great Bri-  
tain meditates further retaliations, most probably an in-  
terdict of all trade by this country (new the only neutral  
one) with the enemies of Greaf Britain, that is to say,  
with the whole commercial world.  
  
** To these destructive operations against our commerce,  
is to be added the late Proclamation of Great Britain on  
the subject of Seamen, This extraordinary instrument,  
instead of relinquishing the pretension with respect to al-  
ledged deserters oh board national ships, extends it to all  
Lritish seamen on board; varying only the mode of pro-  
cess, from that used by Berkeley, to a redress to be ob-  
  
tained by the Government itself. And with respect to  
  
seamen on board merchant vessels, the Proclamation has  
made it the duty of all her sea-officers to search for and  
seize all such as they may call British natives; whether  
wanted or pot for the service of their respective ships,—  
From the proportion of American citizens heretofore taken  
under the name of British seamen, may be calculated the  
number of victims to be added by this formal sanctior to  
the claim of British officers, aud the conversion of that  
claim ipte aduty. ,  
  
** Thus the ocean presents a field only where go barvest  
is to: be reaped but that of danger, of spoliation, and of  
disgrace, — *  
  
** Under such circumstances, the best to be done is what  
hag been done—a dignified retirement within ourselves; a  
  
watchful preservation of our resources; and a déusdbui tas  
tion to the world, that we possess a Virtue and a patriotism  
which cam take avy shape that will best suit the occasion.

‘© It is singularly fortunate that an’ embargo, -whilst it  
guards ovr essential resources, will have the collateral ef-  
fect of making it the interest of all nations to’ change the  
system which has driven our commerve from the ocean,  
  
‘* Great Britain will feel it in hermanufactures, in the  
loss of nayal stores, and, above all, in the supplies essen-  
tial to her cojonies, to the number of which she ‘is additig  
by new. conquests.  
  
‘© France will feel it inthe loss of all those’ colovial  
luxuries, which she has hitherto ‘received through our  
neutral commerce ; and her colonies will at once be cat of  
from the sale of their productions, and the source of their  
supplies,  
  
‘* Spain will feel it) more pethaps than any, in the  
failure of imported food, not making enough within her-  
self, and in her populous and important colonies, which  
depend wholly onus for the supply of their daily wanie, °  
  
‘* Tt isa happy consideration also attending this nea-  
that although it will have these effects, salutary, it  
may be hoped, on the policy of the great contending no-  
tions, it affords neither of them the slightest ground for  
complaint. The embargo violates the rights of gone. Its  
object is to secure ourselves, It is a measure of precau-  
tion, not of aggression. It is resorted to by all natinas,  
when their great interests require it, All of them have  
made us, on different occasions, feel the effect of sucha  
resort on our commercial interests; and it could’be the  
less murmured at by those who may be accitlentally ar-  
fected by the present embargo, inasmuch ‘as they Have  
forced us into the measure, by the direct eilect on us, of  
measures founded ‘in.an alledged regard for their own  
eventual safety, and essential interests.  
  
‘© But may-not the embargo bring on war from some of  
the nations affected by it? Certainly not; if war be not  
predetermined on against us. Being a measure of peace  
and precaution; being universal, and therefore impartial ;  
extending in reality as well as ostensibly to all nations,  
there is not a shadow of pretext to make it a cause of war.  
War, therefore, let it be repeated, cannot be the result ;  
unless it he in pursuance of a predetermined plan of hosti-  
lity against this country,”’—National Intelligencer.

‘*Emparco.—This is a strong measure, pro-  
‘‘ ceeding from the energy of the public councils,  
“appealing to the patriotism of their constitu-  
‘*ents, and is, of all measures, the one peculiar-  
‘*ly adapted tothe crisis. The honest judgment  
‘*of all parties has anticipated and called for it.  
  
‘‘The measure could no longer, in fact, be  
‘delayed without sacrificing the vital interests  
‘*of the nation.  
  
‘*Great Britain, by interpolations into the  
‘‘maritime code operating on her enemies  
‘*through the violated rights of neutrals, furnish-  
‘¢ed an occasion, which was seized by the French  
‘*Government, for the Decree of November,  
‘¢1806, interdicting commerce with Great  
‘* Britain, which was adopted by the allies of  
‘*France, particularly by Spain, in her Decree  
‘‘of February, 1807.  
  
‘* The Decree of November was followed by  
‘‘the retaliating British Order of January, 1807,  
‘‘making war on all neutral trade usually car-  
  
  
  
1873. |  
  
‘*ried on from the ports of one enemy to those  
‘*of another.  
  
‘* France, again seconded by Spain and other  
‘allies, is retaliating on this Order, by new con-  
‘*structions, extending their Decrees to all trade  
‘*from British territories or in British articles.  
  
‘* And it is clear that, if not already done,  
‘‘Great Britain meditates further retaliations,  
‘‘most probably an interdict of all trade by this  
‘*country (now the only neutral one) with the  
‘*enemies of Great Britain, that is to say, with  
‘*the whole commercial world.  
  
‘*To these destructive operations against our  
**commerce, is to be added the late Proclama-  
‘*tion of Great Britain, on the subject of sea-  
‘*men. This extraordinary instrument, instead  
‘* of relinquishing the pretension with respect  
‘*to alleged deserters on board national ships,  
‘* extends it to all British seamen on board ; vary-  
‘*ing only the mode of process, from that used  
‘*by Berkely, to a redress to be obtained by  
‘*the Government itself. And with respect to  
‘* seamen on board merchant vessels, the Proc-  
‘*Jamation has niade it the duty of all her sea-  
‘* officers to search for and seize all such as they  
‘*may call British natives, whether wanted or  
‘*not for the service of their respective ships.  
‘*From the proportion of American citizens  
‘*heretofore taken under the name of British  
‘*seamen, may be calculated the number of  
‘victims to be added by this formal sanction  
‘*to the claim of British officers, and the con-  
‘*version of that claim into a duty.  
  
‘Thus the ocean presents a field only where no  
‘*harvest is to be reaped but that of danger,  
‘*of spoliation, and of disgrace.  
  
“Under such circumstances, the best to be  
‘¢ done is what has been done—a dignified re-  
‘*tirement within ourselves; a watchful pre-  
‘* servation of our resources; and a demonstra-  
‘*tion to the world that we possess a virtue and  
‘*a patriotism which can take any shape that  
‘* will best suit the occasion.  
  
‘**It is singularly fortunate that an embargo,  
‘* whilst it guards our essential resources, will  
‘* have the collateral effect of making it the in-  
‘*terest of all nations to change the system  
‘which has driven our commerce from the  
‘ocean.  
  
‘Great Britain will feel it in her manufac-  
‘‘tures, in the loss of naval-stores, and, above  
‘¢all, in the supplies essential to her Colonies,  
‘*to the number of which she is adding by new  
** conquests.  
  
‘France will feel it in the loss of all those  
‘‘colonial luxuries which she has hitherto re-  
‘*ceived through our neutral commerce; and  
‘*her Colonies will, at once, be cut off from the  
‘sale of their productions and the source of  
‘their supplies.

‘* Spain will feel it more, perhaps, than any,  
‘*in the failure of imported food, not making  
‘‘enough within herself, and in her populous  
‘*and important Colonies, which depend wholly  
‘on us for the supply of their daily wants.  
  
‘*It isa happy consideration also attending  
‘*this measure, that, although it will have these  
‘effects, salutary it may be hoped, on the pol-  
‘Sicy of the great contending nations, it affords  
‘*neither of them the slightest ground for com-  
‘*plaint. The embargo violates the rights of  
‘*none. Its object is to secure ourselves. Itis  
‘*a measure of precaution, not of aggression.  
‘*It is resorted to, by all nations, when their  
‘* great interests require it. All of them have  
‘*made us, on different occasions, feel the  
‘*effects of such a resort on our commercial in-  
‘*terests. And it could be the less murmured  
‘*at by those who may be incidentally affected  
‘*by the present embargo, inasmuch as they  
‘*have forced us into the measure, by the direct  
‘* effect on us of measures founded in an alleged  
‘*regard for their own eventual safety and essen-  
‘tial interests.  
  
‘* But may not the embargo bring on war from  
‘*some of the nations affected by it? Certainly  
‘*not; if war be not predetermined on against  
‘*us. Being a measure of peace and precaution ;  
‘*being universal, and therefore impartial; ex-  
‘*tending, in reality, as well as ostensibly to all  
‘*nations, there is not a shadow of pretext to  
‘*make it a cause of war. War, therefore, let  
‘*it be repeated, cannot be the result; unless it  
‘*be in pursuance of a predetermined plan of  
‘*hostility against this country.  
  
‘* Will it not be an impediment to amicable  
‘‘negotiations with nations with which we  
‘*have unsettled differences? Not more than any  
‘‘other precaution; not more, certainly, than  
‘military preparations, with which depending  
‘*negotiations are frequently accompanied and,  
‘*sometimes, professedly armed. e policy of  
‘* President Washington sent Mr. Jay into  
“negotiation with an embargo in his hand.  
‘Would the Treaty he made have been the  
‘“‘worse if the embargo had not been res-  
‘*cinded?  
  
We not the embargo have been better  
  
‘** modified ? ox not, particularly, the vessels  
‘of the several foreign nations have been al-  
‘*lowed to carry on trade from our ports ?  
  
‘¢*The plausibility of such an exception van-  
‘‘ishes, at once, when tested by its inevitable  
‘‘and inadmissible consequences:  
  
‘*1, It would have given so decided and ex-  
“clusive an advantage to one of the belligerent  
‘parties that it would have been difficult to  
‘¢ justify it to the others. Great Britain, havin  
‘*the command of the sea and the means 0  
‘¢conveyance, would have supplied her wants,  
  
  
  
316 HISTORICAL  
  
** whilst her enemies, having neither, would be  
“left destitute.  
  
‘2, Having the monopoly of our market, her  
“‘agents would obtain supplies at half their  
“‘value.  
  
‘*3. The competition to sell to them would  
**have made every purchase a favor, and conse-  
‘** quently a source of dreadful influence.  
  
‘¢4, Our mariners, thrown out of employment,  
** would have been easily enticed into foreign  
**service, never, probably, to be regained. Our  
“‘ships might, perhaps, be bought up, at the  
**same time, for half their value, and Fi lost to  
*‘the nation.  
  
‘*5. In fine, the exception, thus operating in  
‘+s favor of Great Britain, would have done what,  
‘* above all things, she would have wished. It  
‘*would have given her a monopoly of the trade  
‘¢of the world; would have secured all her sup-  
‘* plies, on the best terms, whilst her enemies  
‘‘and rival would go without, altogether; and,  
*“*to crown the whole, it would, without the  
‘‘ benefit of more than a very scanty market for  
“‘our produce, have given her the greatest pos-  
“*sible interest in persevering in those regula-  
  
**tions and prolonging that state of things,  
‘‘which forms the present afflicting crisis to  
“‘this country.  
  
‘¢The embargo, then, is the best expedient in  
  
“tits best form. It has been recommended by  
‘*the President, who has the best means of know-  
‘Sing the policy of foreign Governments; and  
‘¢it has been adopted by Congress, who are alone  
‘*able to provide, in such cases, for the secu-  
‘‘rity of the public rights and interests; adopt-  
‘¢ed, almost unanimously, by the Senate, cathe  
‘as large a majority in the House of Represen-  
‘‘tatives as is to be expected in any case where  
‘‘an honest difference of opinion may be added  
*‘to the habitual opposition of party spirit.  
  
‘* All that remains, then, for a people confid-  
‘sing in their Government, is to rally round the  
‘¢measure which that Government has adopted  
‘¢ for their good, and to secure its just effect,  
“by patiently and proudly submitting to every  
‘*inconvenience which such a measure neces-  
‘sarily carries with it.
