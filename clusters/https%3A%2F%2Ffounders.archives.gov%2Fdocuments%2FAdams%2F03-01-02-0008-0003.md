native Americans from Maine to Arkansas. In-  
  
deed the negroes on a Southern plantation speak |  
  
better English than the majority of the York-

Dr. Latham, in his elaborate work on “ The

fourteenth verse of the second chapter of the

From these versions we select the following,  
which the reader may compare with Tennyson&#x27;s

For, lo, the winter is past,  
The rain is over and gone;  
The flowers appear on the earth;  
The time of the singing of birds is come,  
And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land  
The fig-tree ripeneth her green figs,  
And the vines are in blossom,  
They give forth their fragrance.  
Arise, my love, my fair one,  
And come away.  
  
Oh mv dove, that art in the clefts of the rocks,  
In the court of the steep place,  
  
Let me see thy countenance,  
Let me hear thy voice ;  
  
For sweet is thy voice,  
And thy countenance is comely,”
