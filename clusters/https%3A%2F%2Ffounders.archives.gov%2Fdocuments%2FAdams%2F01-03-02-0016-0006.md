In 1758 my Period with Mr. Putnam expired. Doolittle and Baldwin visited me in the office, and invited me to settle in Worcester. They said as there were two Sides to a question and two Lawyers were always wanted where there was one, I might depend upon Business in my profession, they were pleased to add that my Character was fair and well esteemed by all Sorts of People in the Town and through the County: that they wished to get me chosen at the next Election which was very near, Register of Deeds, which would procure me something handsome for the present, and insure me Employment at the Bar. That as the Chandler Family had engrossed almost all the public offices and Employment in the Town and County, they wished to select some Person qualified to share with them in these honors and Emoluments. My Answer was that as the Chandlers were worthy People and discharged the Duties of their offices very well I envied not their felicity and had no desire to sett myself in Opposition to them, and especially to Mr. Putnam who had married a beautifull Daughter of that Family and had treated me with Civility and Kindness. But there was one Motive with me, which was decisive. I was in very ill health and the Air of Worcester appeared to be unfriendly to me, to such a degree that I panted for want of the Breezes from the Sea and the pure Zephirs from the rocky mountains of my native Town: that my Father and Mother invited me to live with them, and as there never had been a Lawyer in any Country Part of the then County of Suffolk, I was determined at least to look into it and see if there was any chance for me. They replied that the Town of Boston was full of Lawyers and many of them of established Characters for long Experience, great Abilities and extensive Fame, who might be jealous of such a Novelty as a Lawyer in the Country part of their County, and might be induced to obstruct me. I returned that I was not

r 1758 the Study of the Law was a dreary Ramble, in comparison of what it is at this day. The Name of Blackstone had not been heard, whose Commentaries together with Sullivans Lectures and Reeves’s History of the Law, have smoothed the path of the Student, while the long Career of Lord Mansfield, his many investigations and Decisions, the great Number of modern Reporters in his time and a great Number of Writers on particular Branches of the Science have greatly facilitated the Acquisition of it. I know not whether a sett of the Statutes at large or of the State Tryals was in the Country. I was desirous of seeking the Law as well as I could in its fountains and I obtained as much Knowledge as I could of Bracton, Britton, Fleta and Glanville, but I suffered very much for Want of Books, which determined me to furnish myself, at any Sacrifice, with a proper Library: and Accordingly by degrees I procured the best Library of Law in the State.

The law, both as a study and in its practice, was on a very  
different footing, in the middle of the last century from what  
itisnow. The name of Blackstone,” says Mr. Adams in  
the Autobiography, “had not yet been heard, whose Com-  
mentaries, together with Sullivan’s Lectures and Reeves’s His-  
tory of the Law, have smoothed the path of the student,  
while the long career of Lord Mansfield, his many investiga-  
tions and decisions, the number of modern reporters in his  
time, and a great number of writers on particular branches of  
the science, have greatly facilitated the acquisition of it.”  
He adds, “I was desirous of seeking the law as well as I  
could in its fountains, and I obtained as much knowledge as  
I could of Bracton, Britton, Fleta, and Glanville; but I  
suffered very much for want of books, which determined me  
to furnish myself at any sacrifice with a proper library ; and  
accordingly, by degrees, I procured the best library of law  
in the Siate.”

eminently characteristic, in all its details, of the distin-  
guished statesman, and which bears upon its face such  
marks of impartiality and honesty, that all will read it  
with pleasure and profit.  
  
Mr. Adams studied law with Mr. Putnam, of Worcester.  
His period (so he styles it) expired in 1758. Upon this  
occasion he naturally cast about for a place to settle, and  
the inducements which were held out to him by two  
gentlemen of Worcester, who wished to detain him in that  
town, seem now quite amusing. He had not then been  
admitted, but he informs us that two gentlemen, by name  
Doolittle and Baldwin, visited him in the office of Mr.  
Putnam, and invited him to settle in Worcester. “They  
said (we quote from the Diary), as there were two sides to  
a question, and two lawyers were always wanted where  
there was one, [ might depend upon business in my profes-  
sion; they were pleased to add, that my character was  
fair, and well esteemed by all sorts of people in the town  
and through the county ; that they wished to get me  
chosen at the next election, which was very near, Register  
of Deeds, which would procure me something handsome  
for the present, and insure me employment at the bar; that  
as the Chandler family had engrossed almost all the public  
offices and employment in the town and county, they  
wished to select some person qualified to share with them  
in those honors and emoluments. My answer was, that as  
the Chandlers were worthy people, and discharged the  
duties of their offices very well, I envied not their felicity,  
and had no desire to set myself in opposition to them, and  
especially to Mr. Putnam, who had married a beautiful  
daughter of that family, and had treated me with civility  
and kindness.”’ Mr. Adams adds, that the decisive motive  
with him was his ill health, the air of Worcester being  
unfavorable. His parents had also invited him to live with  
them, and as there never had been a lawyer in any country  
  
- part of the then county of Suffolk,’ he was determined to
