Dear Sir  
  
  
  
Montpellier  
  
Jany. 23. 1829  
  
  
  
I have recd. under your cover, the newspaper containing the explanatory remarks on the two letters relating  
to the power of Congress to encourage domestic manufactures.  
The writer of the letters is laid under great obligation by the opportune &amp; apposite interposition in  
their behalf. The strange misconstructions which continue to be put on the occasion &amp; object of them, would  
produce surprize if such effects of party or other feelings were less familiarized to us.  
I am truly sorry to observe the persevering and exulting appeals to the letter of Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Giles.  
The inconsistency is monstrous, between the professed veneration for his name, and the anxiety to make him avow opinions  
in the most pointed opposition to those maintained by him in his more deliberate correspondence with others, and acted on  
thro’ his whole official life.  
I cannot particularly refer to his letters to Austin &amp; others; but have consulted his elaborate  
Report in 1793, when Secretary of State, and all his Messages, when President; and I find in them the most explicit  
&amp; re-iterated sanctions given to the power to regulate trade or commerce, in favor of  
manufactures, by recommending the expediency of exercizing the power for that purpose, as well as for others, distinct or  
derogating from the object of revenue.  
Having noted the pages in the State papers published by Wait, as I examined them with an eye to Mr.  
Jefferson’s opinions, I refer to them in the Margin*, as abridging a research, if your curiosity should at any time prompt  
one.  
To set up against such evidence of Mr. Jefferson’s direct &amp; settled opinion, the unstudied &amp;  
unguarded language incident to a hasty &amp; confidential correspondence, is surely as unreasonable, as it must be  
disrespectful &amp; unfriendly, to make a letter written under such circumstances, the basis of a charge that he had  
thro’ so many years, and on so many occasions, maintained and acted on the power in question, without discovering that it  
was not warranted by the Great Charter which he had bound himself by oath not to violate. Every rule of fair construction,  
as well as every motive of friendly respect, ought to favor as much as possible a meaning in the letter that would  
reconcile it with the overwhelming evidence of opinions elsewhere avowed, instead of displaying a self-contradiction, by  
turning the letter against those opinions.  
Nor would a candid Critic be at any loss to avoid the self-contradiction. The term &quot;indefinitely&quot;, on which  
the question of constitutionality turns, would seem to imply that a definite or limited use of  
the power, might not be unconstitutional, and it is a fair presumption that the idea in the mind of the writer, was that  
an unlimited or excessive abuse of the power was equivalent to a usurpation of it. Is it possible to believe that Mr.  
Jefferson could have intended to admit, that he had been all his life inhaling despotism, and had then, for the first  
time, scented the tainted breeze. However just the distinction may be between the abuse &amp; the usurpation of power,  
and necessary to be kept in view in all accurate discussions, it cannot be denied that there may be abuses so enormous as  
to be not only at war with the Constitution whether federal or State, but to strike at the foundation of the Social  
compact itself, and, if otherwise irremediable, to justify a dissolution of it.  
I am still in the dark as to the ground of the Statement that makes Mr. J—n &amp; the parties to the  
publication in 1801, signed &quot;The danger not over&quot;  
With our joint salutations to Mrs. Rives &amp; yourself, I pray you to accept a re-assurance of my great  
&amp; cordial esteem.

Have you noticed in Niles’ Register of the 17. inst. p. 380, an extract from an address in 1808, signed, among others, by  
our friend Mr. Ritchie, wishing Congress to encourage our own manufactures, by higher duties on foreign, even if the present attacks on our commerce should blow over, that we may be the less dependent

&quot; Dear Sir : I have received under your cover,  
the newspaper containing the explanatory re­  
marks on the two letters relating to the power of  
Congress to encourage domestic manufactures.  
The writer of the letters is laid under great ob­  
ligation by the opportune and apposite interposi­  
tion in their behalf. The strange misconstruc­  
tions which continue to be put on the occasion  
and object of them, would produce surprise if  
such effects of party or other feelings were less  
familiarize;! to us.  
&quot; I am truly sorry to observe the persevering  
and exulting appeals to the letter of Mr. Jeffer­  
son to Mr. Giles. The inconsistency is mon­  
strous, between the-professed veneration for his  
name, and the anxiety to make him avow opin­  
ions in the most pointed opposition to those main­  
tained by him in his more deliberate correspond­

official life.  
&quot; I can not particularly refer to his letters to  
Austin and others ; but hive consulted his elab­  
orate report in 1793, when Secretary of State,  
and all his Messages, v hen President; and I find  
in them the most explicit and reiterated sanctions  
given to the power to regulate trade or com­  
merce, in favor of M inufictures, by recommend­  
ing the expediency of exercising the power for  
th tt purpose, as well as for others, distinct or  
derojating from the object of revenue.  
&quot; Having noted the pages in the State papers  
published Dy Wait, as I examined them with an  
eye to Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s opinions, I refer to them  
in the margin,* as abridging a research, if your  
curiosity should at any time prompt one.  
&quot;To set up against such evidence of Mr. Jef­  
ferson&#x27;s direct and settled opinion, the unstudied  
and unguarded language incident to a hasty and  
confidential correspondence, is surely as unrea­  
sonable, as it must be disrespectful and unfriend­  
ly, to make a loiter written under such circum­  
stances, the basis of a charge that he had thro&#x27;  
so many years, and on so many occasions, main,  
tained and acted on the power in question, with­  
out discovering that it was not warranted by the  
great charter which he had bound himself by  
oath not to violate. Every rule of fair construc­

ought to favor as much as possible a meaning in  
the letter that would reconcile it with the over­  
whelming evidence of opinions elsewhere avow­

?&#x27;Nor would a candid critic be at any loss to  
avoid the self-contradiction. The term 4 indefi­  
nitely,&#x27; on . bich the question of constitutionality  
turns, would seem to imply that a definite or lim­  
ited use of the power might not be unconstitu­

or excessive abuse of the power -vas equivalent  
to a usurpation of it. Is it. .possible to believe  
that Mr. Jefferson could have intended to admit,  
that he had been all his life inhaling despotism,  
and had then, for the first time, scented the taint­

be between th?? abuse and the usurpation of pow­  
er, and necessary to be kept in view in all accu­  
rate discussions, it can not&#x27;be denied that there  
may be in all, abuses so enormous as to he not  
only at war with the Constitution, whether Fed­  
eral or Slate, but to strike at the foundation of  
the social compact itself, and, if otherwise irre­  
mediable, to justify a dissolution of it.

MoNTPELIER, Jan. 23, 1879.  
&quot;DeaR Sir: I have received under your cover,  
the newspaper containing the explanatory remarks  
on the two letters relating to the power of Congress  
to encourage Domestic Manufactures. The writer  
of the letters is laid unde great obligations by the  
oportune and apposite interposition in their behalf.  
The strange misconstructions which continue to be  
put on the occasion and object of them, would proe  
duce surprise if such efferts of party or other feel­  
ings were less familiarised to us.  
&quot;I am truly sorry to observe the persevering and  
exulting appeals to the letter of Mr. Jefferson to Mr.  
Giles. The inconsistency is monstrous, between  
the professed vaneration for his name, and the  
anxiety to make him avow opinions in the most  
pointed opposition to those maintained by him in  
his more deliberate correspondence with others, and  
acted on through his whole official life.  
&quot;I cannot particularly refer to his letters to Aus-  
tin and others; but have consulted his elaborate re-  
port in 1793, when Secretary of State, and all his  
Messages, when President; and I find in them the  
most explicit and reiterated sanctions given to the  
power to regulate trade or commerce, in favor of  
manufactures, by recommending the expediency of  
exercising the power for that purpose, as well as for  
others, distinct or derogating from the object of re  
venue.  
&quot;Having noted the pages in the State papers pube  
lished by Wait, as I examined them with an eye to  
Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s opinions, I reter to them in the mare  
gin as abridging a research, if your curiosity should  
at any time prompt one.  
&quot;To set up aguinst such evidence of Mr. Jeffer:  
son&#x27;s direct and settled cpinion, the unstudied and  
unguarded language incidant to a hasty and confi-  
dential correspondence, is surely as anreasonable, as  
it must be disrespectful and unfriendly, to make a  
letter written under sich circumstances, the  
basis of a charge that le had through so many  
years, and on so many occasions, maintained and  
acted on the power in question, without discovering  
that it was not warranted by the great charter which  
he had bound himself by oith not to violate. Every  
rule of fair construction, as well as every motive of  
friendly respect, ought to favor as much as possible  
a meaning in the le ter thet would reconcile it with  
the overg helming evidence of opinions elsewhere a­  
vowed, instead of displaying a self-contradiction by  
turning the letter against those opinions.&quot;

which

I am truly sorry to observe the preserv-  
  
ins; sod exulting: uppeala to the letter of  
Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Giles. The incon­  
sistency is monstrous, between the profess­

ety to make him avow opinions in the  
most pointed opposition to those main­  
tained by -him in his more deliberate cor­  
reapondoneo with ethers, and acted on,  
through his whole official life.  
, I cannot particularly- refer to hia letlera

sulted his elaborate report in 1793, when  
&#x27; iktoreBfy:e-&#x27;f Bute, and all hiMeagei  
when President; and I find in them the  
most explicit and reiterated sanctions giv­  
en to the power to regulate Trade or com­  
merce, in favor of Manufactures, by re­  
commending the expediency ol exercis­  
ing the power for that purpose, as well as  
for others, distinct or derogating from the  
object of revenue.  
(laving noted the pages in the State pa­  
pers published by Wait, as I examined  
them with an eye to Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s opin­  
ion, I refer lo them in the margin, as a­  
bridging a research, if your curiosity  
should at any time prompt one.

studied and unguarded language incident

tion, without discovering that it was not  
warranted by the great charter which he  
had bound himae.lf . by oath not to violate.  
Every rule of fair construction, as well as  
every mottvo of friendly respect, ought 16  
HTor as mncn aa possiuie a meaning in tne  
letter that would reconcilo it with&quot; tho o-  
verwhelmintr evidence of opinion else  
where avowed; instead of displaying a  
self-contradiction, . by turning the fetter a-  
gainst those opinions.  
Nor would a candid critic be at any loss  
to avoid the self contradiction. The term  
indefinitely,&quot; on which the ouesiion of  
constitutionality turns, would seem to im­  
ply .that a definite or limited use of ihe  
power might not be unconstitutional, and  
it is a fair presumption that the idea in the

that there may be &#x27;in all abuses so enor­

&quot;Mo streliea, Jan, 23d, 11  
&quot;Dear Sin-I have reeerved under your cver, the  
newspapet containing the explanatory remarks on the  
two lettets telaling to the power of Congress to encoir  
age domestic manuiactures. The writer of the lttets  
is laid under great obligation by the opportune and aps  
posile intt tpoaltion in their benall. Ine strange mis  
constructions which continne to be put on the occastn  
and object of them, would produce surprise, if such e  
lects of party or other feclings were less familiarized to  
us.  
&quot;I am truly sorry to observe the persevering and ex  
ulting appeals to the letter of Mr. Jollirson in Mr. Giles,  
The inconsistency is moustrous, between the prole  
sed veneration for his name, and the anxiety to make  
him avow opinions in the moist pointed opposition to those  
maintamed by him in his more deliberate corresmindence  
with others, and acted on through his whole official lit  
&quot;I cannot particularly efer to his leiters to Austin  
and others; but have consulted his elaborate report in  
103, when Secretary of Stale, and all his Messagt  
when President; and I find in them the most expll u  
and reiterated sanctioms given to the pover to regulate  
trAde or commeree, in lavor of Manufactures, by rt  
commending the expediency of exereising the power for  
that purpose, as well as for others, distinct or deloga  
ting from the object of revenue.  
&quot;Having roted the pages in the State papers publish  
ed by Wan, as I examined them with an eyr th Mr.  
Jellerson&#x27;s opinions, I reter to them in the margin,&quot;  
abridging a research, if your curlosity should at ary  
time prompt one.  
&quot;To set up against such evidence of Mr. leffersun&#x27;s  
lirect and seitled opinion, the unstudied and unguarded  
language incident tha hasty and confidential corrtspon  
dence, is surely as unreasonable, as it must be disre  
spectful and unfriendly, to make a letter writlen under  
such circumstances, the basts of a charge that he had  
though to many years, and on so many occasions, main  
tined and acted on the power in question without dis  
overing that it was not watranted by the great charter  
which he had hound hunself by oath not to violite. Eve  
ry rule of fair construction, as well as every motive of  
triendly respect, ought to favor as much as possuble a  
meaning in the letter that would reconcile it with the  
verwhelming evidence of opinions elswhere avowed,  
instead of displaying a self-contradiction, by turning the  
letler against those opinions.  
&quot;Nor would a candid critic be at any loss to avold  
the self-contradiction. The term &quot;indefinitely,&quot; on  
which the question of Constitutionality turns, would seem  
to imply that a definite or limited use of the power might  
not be unconstituttonal, and it is a fair presmuption that  
the idea in the mind of the writer, was that an unlimited  
or excessive abuseof the power, was equivalent to a u  
surpation of it. Is it possible to believe that Mi. Jof  
ferson could havd intended in admit, that he had heen  
all his life inhaling despotism, and had then, for the  
first time, seented the tainted breeze? However jst the  
distinct om may be be ween the abuse and the us rpitio o  
power, and necessary to be kept in view in all accuran  
discussions, it cannot be denied that there may be in all  
abuses so enormous as to be not only at war with the­  
constitution, whether federal or sale, but to arrke at  
the louneation of the social compact itself, and, if other  
wise irtemediable, to justify a dissolution of it  
&quot;I am still in the dark as to the gfound of the state  
ment that makes Mr. J flerson and me partie, to the pub  
lication in 180l, signed &quot;the danger not ovet.&quot;  
&quot;With our joint alutations to Mes. Rves and yout

&quot;  
The same use having been attempted to  
be made of this letter of Jefferson in ihe  
heiitrd diseiiselona of lUSft-&#x27;O, it was then  
rebuked and triumphantly repelled, in a  
noble vindication of the consistency of his  
deceased friend, by Mr. Madison, in a let­  
ter addressed by hi&#x27;m to Mr. Rives, which  
we have recently had the pleasure of read­  
ing, and of which we are now enabled to  
lay a literal and exact copy before our rea­  
ders. Richmond Whig.

ENUE.  
Having noted the pages in the State pa­  
pers published by Wait, as I examined  
them with an eye to Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s opin­  
ions, I refer to them in the margin,&quot; as  
abridging a research, if your curiosity  
should at any time prompt one.  
&quot;To set up against such evidence of Mr.  
Jefferson&#x27;s direct and settled opinion, the  
unstudied and unguarded language incident  
to a hasty and confidential correspendence,  
is surely as unreasonable, as it must be dis  
respectful and unfriendly, to make a letter  
written under such circumstances, the ba­  
sis of a charge that he had through so ma­  
ny years, and on so many occasions, main­  
tained and acted on the power in question,  
without discovering that it was not warran­  
ted by the great charter which he had  
bound himself by oath not to violate. Eve­  
ry rule of fair construction, as well as every  
motive of friendly respect, ought to favor as  
  
much as possible a meaning in the letter that  
reconcile it with the overwhelming  
  
evidence of opinions elsewhere avowed, in­  
stead of displaying a self-contradiction, by  
turning the letter against those oplnions.  
Nor would a candid critic be at any loss  
to avoid the self-contradiction. The term  
sindefinitely&quot; on which the question of  
constitutionality turns, would seem to im­  
ply that a definite or limited use of the  
power, might not be unconstitutional, and  
it is a fair presumption that the idea in the  
mind of the writer, was that an unlimited  
or excessive abuse of the power, was equiy­  
alent to a usurpation of it. Is it possible  
to believe that Mr. Jefferson could have in­  
tended to admit, that he had been all his  
life inbaling despotism, and had then, for  
the irst time, scented the tainted breeze?  
However just the distinction may be be­  
tween the abuse and the usurpation of  
power, and necessary to be kept in view  
in all accurate discussions, it cannot be de­  
nied that there may be in all abuses so  
enormous as to be not only at war with the  
constitution, whether federal or State, but  
to strike tat the foundation of the socinl  
compact itself, and, if otherwise irremedia­  
ble, to justify a dissolution of it.  
I am still in the dark as to the ground  
of the staement that makes Mr. Jefferson  
and me parties to the publication in 180l,  
signed the danger not over.&quot;  
With our joint salutation to Mrs.Rives  
and youraclf, I pray yo to diale  
of my great and cordial esteem.

says on this i nest ion.: &#x27; &#x27;I am truly  
sorry to observe the lwrseveriugand exulting  
appeals to tho letter of Mr. Jefferson  
to Mr. Giles. The inconsistency is  
monstrous between the professed veneration

make him avow opinions in the most

by him in his more elelibcrato correspondence
