I begin, at this Epoch, a concise Journal of Military transactions &amp;ca. I lament not having attempted it from the commencement of the War, in aid of my memory and wish the multiplicity of matter which continually surround me and the embarrassed State of our affairs which is momently calling the attention to perplexities of one kind or another, may not defeat altogether or so interrupt my present intention, &amp; plan, as to render it of little avail.  
To have the clearer understanding of the entries which may follow, it would be proper to recite, in detail, our wants and our prospects but this alone would be a Work of much time, and great magnitude. It may suffice to give the sum of them—wch., I shall do in a few words—viz.—  
Instead of having Magazines filled with provisions, we have a scanty pittance scattered here &amp; there in the different States. Instead of having our Arsenals well supplied with Military Stores, they are poorly provided, &amp; the Workmen all leaving them. Instead of having the various articles of Field equipage in readiness to deliver, the Quarter Master General (as the denier resort, according to his acct.) is but now applying to the several States to provide these things for their Troops respectively. Instead of having a regular System of transportation established upon credit or funds in the Qr. Masters hands to defray the contingent Expences of it, we have neither the one nor the other and all that business, or a great part of it, being done by Military Impress, we are daily &amp; hourly oppressing the people—souring their tempers and alienating their affection. Instead of having the Regiments compleated to the New establishment (and which ought to have been So by the  of  agreeably to the requisitions of Congress, scarce any State in the Union has, at this hour, an eighth part of its quota in the field and little prospect, that I can see, of ever getting more than half. In a word—instead of having everything in readiness to take the Field, we have nothing—and instead of having the prospect of a glorious offensive campaign before us, we have a bewildered, and gloomy defensive one—unless we should receive a powerful aid of Ships—Land Troops and  
  
Money from our generous allies &amp; these, at present, are too contingent to build upon.  
  
  
  
May 1st. Induced by pressing necessity—the inefficacy, &amp; bad tendency of pushing Military Impresses too far and the impracticability of keeping the Army supplied without it, or money, to pay the transportation I drew for 9000 dollars of the Sum sent on by the State of Massachusetts for payment of their Troops; and placed it in the hands of the QM General with the most positive orders to apply it solely to this purpose.  
Fixed with Ezekiel Cornell Esqr. a member of the Board of War (then on a tour to the Eastward to inspect some of the Armoury’s &amp;ca.) on certain articles of Cloathing—arms and Military Stores which might be sent from hence to supply the wants of the Southern Army.  
Major Talmadge was requested to press the C——s Senr. &amp; Junr. to continue their correspondence and was authorized to assure the elder C—— that he should be repaid the Sum of 100 Guineas, or more, with interest; provided he advanced the same for the purpose of defraying the expence of the correspondence, as he had offered to do.  
Colo. Dayton was also written to, and pressed to establish a correspondence with New York, by way of Elizabeth Town for the purpose of obtaining intelligence of the Enemys movemts. and designs; that by a comparison of Accts. proper &amp; just conclusions may be drawn.

May 2d. No occurrence of note. A very fresh and steady gale of Wind all day from the So. East. Upon its shifting (about dusk) it blew violently, &amp; continued boisterous through the Night or greatest part of it.  
  
  
  
4th. A Letter of the Baron de Steuben’s from Chesterfield Court House Virga. dated the 21st. Ulto. informs that 12 of the Enemys Vessels but with what Troops he knew not, had advanced up James River as high as Jamestown—that few Militia were in arms and few arms to put into their hands—that he had moved the public Stores from Richmond &amp;ca. into the interior Country.  
A Letter from the Marqs. de la Fayette, dated at Alexandria on the 23d., mentioned his having commenced his march that day for Fredericksburg—that desertion had ceased, &amp; that his detachment were in good Spirits.

6th. Colo. Menonville, one of the Adjutt. Generals in the French Army came to Head Quarters by order of Count de Rochambeau to make arrangements for supplying the Troops of His Most Christian Majesty with certain provisions contracted for by Doctr. Franklin. This demand, tho’ the immediate compliance with it, was not insisted upon, comports illy with our circumstances; &amp; is exceedingly embarrassing.  
The D[eputy] Q[uarter] M[aster] at Sussex C[our]t House,  
  
conceiving that the Provision Magazine, &amp; other stores at that place were exposed to a surprize, and in danger of being destroyed by the Indians &amp; Tories who were infesting the Settlement at Minisink, I directed Colo. Dayton to send a guard there from the Jersey Brigade near Morristown.  
Mr. John Flood (at present a liver at lower Salem) whom I had sent for to obtain from him an acct. of the Harbours in the Sound from Frogs point Eastward, arrived; and gave the information wch. is filed in my Office.  
Other letters arriving this Evening late (more expressive of the wants of the York Troops at Albany, &amp; the Posts above) I ordered 100, out of 131 Barrls. of Flour which were in Store, to be immediately sent up; &amp; again called upon the Q. M. Genl. in the most pointed terms to send active men to forward on, by every means they could devise, the Salted provs. in Connecticut; &amp; flour from Sussex Ct. Ho. &amp;ca.  
That the States might not only know our Wants, which my repeated &amp; pressing letters had recently, &amp; often communicated, but, if possible, be impressed with them and adopt some mode of Transporting it to the Army, I resolved to send Genl. Heath (2d. Offr. in Commd.) to make to the respective legislatures East of York State, pointed representations; &amp; to declare explicitly that unless measures are adopted to supply transportation, it will be impossible to subsist &amp; keep the Troops together.

7th. The Wind which blew with great force from the So. East the last two days was accompanied this day by incessant Rain and was a most violent Storm &amp; is supposed to have done damage to Ships on the Coast.  
  
  
  
9th. Went to the Posts at West point, and found by enquiry of General Heath, that all the Meat deposited in the advanced redoubts for contingent purposes would not, if served out, serve the Army two days—that the Troops had drawn none that day &amp; that none remained in the common Magazine.  
  
  
  
10th. The Q. M. Genl. representing, that it was not in his power to get the Salt Meat of Connecticut transported—even for the Money that was put into his hands for this purpose—the people now alledging that they had no forage—when the badness of the roads was an excuse when they were called upon by the Executive of their State in the Month of March and that nothing but Military force could affect the transport for our present wants. Parties were ordered out accordingly and the Officers commanding them directed to receive their Instructions from him.  
  
  
Timothy Pickering to GW, 9 May 1781 (DLC:GW). GW’s instructions to Pickering, 10 May 1781, are in MHi: Pickering Papers.  
  
  
  
  
  
11th. Major Genl. Heath set out this day for the Eastn. States, provided with Instructions, and letters couched in strong terms—representing the distresses of the Army for want of provisions and the indispensable necessity of keeping up regular supplies by the adoption of a plan, which will have system &amp; permanency in’t.  
This day also I received advice from Colo. Dayton that 10 Ships of the line, and 3 or 4000 Troops had sailed from New York. The intelligence was immediately communicated to Congress, and to the French Genl. &amp; Admiral at R. Isld.

12th. Colo. Dayton’s intelligence, so far as respected the Sailing of Troops, was confirmed by two sensible deserters from Kingsbridge; which place they left yesterday Morning at two Oclock. They add the detachment consisted of the Grenadrs. (Bh.)—the Corps. of Anspach (two Battalions) &amp; the 37th. &amp; 43d. British regiments, amounting, as is supposed, to about 2000 Men under the Command of Majr. Genl. Redeisel.

mmell with the New Hampshire Troops had Marched to their assistance. I ordered the Connecticut Troops to move in &amp; support those of New Hampshire.  
In the evening, information was brot. that the enemy (consisting of about 60 horse, &amp; 140 Infantry) had retreated precipitately &amp; that several of our Soldiers had been inhumanly murdered.  
  
  
John Paterson (1744–1808) had served first as a colonel in the Massachusetts militia and after Jan. 1776 in the Continental Army, attaining the rank of brigadier general Feb. 1777.

15th. Information, dated 12 oclock yesterday reports 15 Sail of Vessels &amp; a number of Flatboats to be off Fort Lee. Ordered a detachment of 200 Men to March immediately to support the Post at Dobbs’s. ferry—countenance the Militia, &amp; cover the Country in that Neighbourhood.  
Intelligence from C—— Senr., dated 729—a detachment is expected to Sail tomorrow from New York, &amp; said to consist of the Anspach Troops’s 43d. B. Regiment, remainder of the 76th., 80th., 17th. Dragoons, &amp; Infantry of the same—to be conveyed by 7 Ships of the line, 2 fifties, &amp; 3 forty fours which are to cruize of the Capes of Virginia. He gives it as the opinion of C—— Junr. that the above detachmt. does not exceed 2000 Men—that not more than 4000 remain—wch. is only (he adds) to be accounted for on the supposition of their expecting a reinforcement immediately from Europe.  
  
  
Fort Lee was on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, opposite Fort Washington.  
  
  
GW to John Paterson, 15 May 1781 (DLC:GW).  
  
  
“729” was the cipher for Setauket, Long Island, where Samuel Culper, Sr., was operating (see entry for 1 May 1781).

16th. Went to the Posts at West point. Received a particular acct. of the surprize of Colo. Green &amp; the loss we sustained which consisted of himself &amp; Major (Flag) killed—three officers &amp; a Surgeon taken prisoners (the latter &amp; two of the former wounded)—a Sergeant &amp; 5 R[ank] &amp; F[ile] killed—5 left wounded &amp; 33 made Prisoners &amp; missing—in all 44 besides Officers.  
The report of the number of Shipping &amp;ca. at Fort Lee was this day contradicted in part—the number of Vessels being reduced, &amp; said to be no higher than Bulls ferry. In consequence of this intelligence Lt. Colo. Badlam who marched with the detachment of 200 Men pursuant to the order of Yesterday &amp; had reached Stony point halted—but was directed not to return till the designs of the enemy were better understood.  
  
  
For the attack on Greene’s force, see entry for 14 May 1781.  
  
  
Bull’s Ferry was approximately two miles below Fort Lee.  
  
  
Ezra Badlam (d. 1788) was lieutenant colonel of the 8th Massachusetts Regiment. See entry for 15 May 1781.  
  
  
  
  
17th. Received a letter from Captn. Lawrence, near Dobbss ferry, informing me that abt. 200 Refugees were building a block house &amp; raising other works at Fort Lee. Order’d the detachment  
  
  
  
which had halted at Kings Ferry &amp; another forming under Colo. Scammel to advance down &amp; endeavour to annoy, if they could not prevent them.  
A Letter from Genl. Foreman of Monmouth (dated the 14th. Instt.) informs me that the British fleet from New York consisting of Seven Ships of 60 Guns &amp; upwards—12 large Transport Vessels, &amp; 10 topsail Schooners &amp; Sloops made Sail from Sandy hook the 12th., with the wind at So. East. but veering round to the Southward, &amp; Westward, it returned within the hook &amp; lay there till 10 o’clock next day when it again Sailed. By two oclock it was clear of the hook and steering Southward.

18th. Received Letters from Generals Schuyler and Clinton giving an acct. of the threatened Invasion of the Northern Frontier of this State from Canada, and of the unfavourable prospects from Vermont and of the destruction of the Post of Fort Schuyler—the indefensible State of the Works occasioned thereby &amp; submitting for considn. the propriety of removing the Garrison to the German Flatts which he (that is Clinton) was requested to do if it appear’d to be the sense of the Governor &amp; other principal Gentn. of the State that it would be eligable.  
Set out this day for the Interview at Weathersfield with the Count de Rochambeau &amp; Admiral Barras. Reached Morgans Tavern 43 Miles from Fishkill Landing after dining at Colo. Vandebergs.

GW may have breakfasted at Samuel Sheldon’s tavern in Litchfield. In Wethersfield, GW and his suite lodged at Webb House, owned at this time by Col. Joseph Webb (1749–1815) and his wife, Abigail Chester Webb. Webb’s brother, Samuel Blachley Webb (1753–1807), had served as GW’s aide-de-camp from June 1776 to Jan. 1777. The officers in the French party lodged at Stillman’s tavern. See also Conn. Courant, 29 May 1781.  
  
  
  
  
20th. Had a good deal of private conversation with Govr.

25th. Breakfasted at Squire Cogswells—dined at Colo. Vandeburgs &amp; reached head Quarters about Sunset where I found letters from Generls. Schuyler &amp; Clinton, full of uncertain information respecting the enemys landing at Crown point &amp; intention to penetrate on the Hudson &amp; Mohawk Rivers. This uncertainty respects the number, not the fact—the latter seeming to be beyond a doubt. In consequence of this information I ordered the Companies of Vanscaicks Regiment at West point to hold themselves in readiness to Move at an hours warning.

31st.

A Letter from Major Talmage, inclosing one from C—— Senr. &amp; another from S.

“Instead of having Magazines filled with pro-

having our arsenals well supplied with military  
stores, they are poorly provided and the work-

various articles of field equipage ready to deliver,  
the Quarter-Master-General is but now applying

provide these things for their troops respectively.  
Instead of having a regular system of transpor-  
tation established upon credit, or funds in the  
quarter-master’s hands to defray the contingent  
expenses of it, we have neither the one nor the  
other—and all that business, or the greater part of  
it, being done by military impressment, we are dai-  
ly and hourly oppressing the people, souring their  
tempers, and alienating their affections. Instead  
of having the regiments completed to their new  
establishments, scarce any State of the Union has  
at this hour one eighth part of its quota in the  
field, and there is little prospect that I can see of  
ever getting more than one half. In a word,  
instead of having every thing in readiness to take  
the field, we have nothing; and instead of having  
the prospect of a glorious offensive campaign be-  
fore us, we have a bewildered and gloomy pros-  
pect of a defensive one, unless we should receive  
a powerful aid of ships, land-troops, and money,  
from our generous allies—and these at present  
are too contingent to build upon!”

The prospects of the country were still darky  
and gloomy in the extreme. Washington wrote  
ou the first of May, 1784: “ Instead of maga­  
zines filled with provisions, we have a scauty  
pittance scattered here and there in the differ­  
ent States. Instead of arsenals well supplied,  
they are poorly provided, and the workmen all  
leaving. Instead of having field-equipage in  
readiness, the Quartor-mastcr-general is but  
now applying to the several States to provide  
these things. Instead of having regiments  
completed, scarce any State has at this hour an  
eighth part of its quota in the field, and there  
is little prospect of their ever getting more tlian  
half. In a ward, instead of having everything  
in readiness to take the field, we have nothing.  
Instead of having the prospect of a glorious  
offensive campaign, we have a bewildering and  
4 gloomy defensive one, unless we should receive  
a powerful aid of ships, land troops, and menejf  
from our generous allies.”

WASHINGTON’S JOURNAL  
  
From the Original Manuscript in the Library of  
the Department of State, at Washington  
  
MAY TO AUGUST, 1781  
  
MAY  
  
I begin at this epoch, a concise jour-  
nal of military transactions, &amp;c. I  
lament not having attempted it from the  
commencement of the war, in aid of my  
memory—and wish the multiplicity of  
matters which continually surround me  
—and the embarrassed state of our  
affairs which is momently calling the  
attention to perplexities of one kind or  
another, may not defeat altogether, or  
so interrupt my présent intention and  
plan as to render it of little avail.  
  
To have the clearer understanding of  
the entries which may follow, it would  
be proper to recite, in detail, our wants  
  
and our prospects—but this alone would’  
  
be a work of much time and great mag-  
nitude. It may suffice to give the sum  
of them, which I shall do in a few  
words,—viz.—  
  
Instead of having magazines filled  
with provisions, we have a scanty pit-  
tance scattered here and there in the  
different States.— Instead of having our  
arsenals well supplied with military  
stores, they are poorly provided, and the  
workmen all leaving theg— Instead of  
having the various articles of Field  
equipage in readiness to deliver, the  
Quartermaster-General (as the denier  
resort, according to his acct) is but  
now applying to the several States to  
provide these things for their troops  
respectively. Instead of having a regu-  
lar system of transportation upon credit,  
—or funds in the Quartermaster’s hands  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
to defray the contingent Expences of it,  
we have neither the one nor the other;  
and all that business, or a great part of  
it, being done by military Impress, we  
are daily and hourly oppressing the peo-  
ple,—-souring their tempers, and aliena-  
ting their affection—Instead of having  
the Regiments compleated to the new  
establishment (and which ought to have  
been so by the — of — agreeable to the  
requisitions of Congress, scarce any  
state in the Union has, at this hour, an  
eighth part of its quota in the field—and  
little prospect, that I can see, of ever  
getting more than half— In a word—  
instead of having everything in readi-  
ness to take the Field, we have nothing  
—and instead of having the prospect of  
a glorious offensive campaign hefore us,  
we have a bewildered and gloomy de-  
fensive one—unless we should receive a  
powerful aid of ships—-Land Troops—  
and money from our generous allies—  
&amp; these, at present, are too contingent  
to build upon.  
  
May 1st—Induced by pressing neces-  
sity—-the inefficacy, &amp; bad tendency of  
pushing Military Impresses too far—and  
the impracticability of keeping the army  
supplied without #¢, or money, to pay the  
transportation—I drew for gooo dollars  
of the sum sent on by the State of Mas-  
sachusetts for payment of their Troops ;  
and placed it in the hands of the Q: M:  
General with the most positive orders to  
apply it solely to this purpose.—  
  
Fixed with Ezekiel Cornell Esqr. a  
member of the Board of war (then on  
a tour to the Eastward to inspect some  
of the Armoury’s &amp;c.) on certain arti-  
cles of cloathing—arms—and military  
stores which might be sent from hence

May 6th—Colo. Menonville, one of  
the adjut. Generals in the French army  
came to Head Quarters by order of  
Count de Rochambeau to make arrange-  
ments for supplying the Troops of His  
most Christian Majesty with certain pro-  
visions contracted for by Doctr. Frank-  
lin—This demand, tho’ the immediate  
compliance with it, was not insisted up-  
on, comports illy with our circumstances ;  
&amp; it is exceedingly embarrassing.—  
  
The D Q Mr. at Sussex Ct House  
concieving that the Provision Magazine  
&amp; other stores at that place were ex-  
posed to a surprize, and in danger of  
being destroyed by the Indians &amp; Tories  
who were infesting the settlement at  
Minisink, I directed Colo. Dayton to  
send a guard there from the Jersey Bri-  
gade near Morristown.—  
  
Mr. John Flood (at present a liver at  
lower Salem) whom I had sent for to  
obtain from him an acct. of the Har-  
bours in the sound from Frogs point  
Eastward, arrived ; and gave the infor-  
mation wch. is filed in my office.  
  
Other letters arriving this evening late  
(more expressive of the wants of the  
York Troops at Albany, &amp; the Posts  
  
  
  
110  
  
above.) I ordered 100, out of 131 Barrls  
of Flour which were in store, to be  
immediately sent up; &amp; again called  
upon the Q M Genl in the most pointed  
terms to send active men to forward on,  
by every means they could devise, the  
salted provn in Connecticut ; &amp; flour  
from Sussex Ct Ho. &amp;c.  
  
That the states might not only know  
our wants, which my repeated &amp; press-  
ing letters had recently, &amp; often com-  
municated, but, if possible, be impressed  
with them and adopt some mode of  
transporting it to the army, I resolved to  
send Genl. Heath (2d offir. in. commd)  
to make to the respective legislatures  
East of York state, pointed representa-  
tion ; &amp; to declare explicity that unless  
measures are adopted to supply trans-  
portation, it will be impossible to subsist  
&amp; keep the troops together.  
  
May 7th—The wind which blew with  
great force from the So. East the last  
two days was accompanied this day by  
incessant rain and was a most violent  
storm.—&amp; is supposed to have done  
damage to ships on the coast.  
  
May 9th—Went to the Posts at West  
Point, and found by enquiry of General  
Heath that all the meal (meat?) depos-  
ited in the advanced redoubts for con-  
tingent purposes would not, if served  
out, serve the army two days—that the  
Troops had drawn none that day—&amp;  
that none remained in the common  
Magazine.  
  
May 10th—The Q M Genl represent-  
ing that it was not in his power to get  
the salt meat of Connecticut transported  
—even for the money that was put into  
his hands for this purpose—the people  
now alledging that they had no forage—  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
when the badness of the roads was an  
excuse when they were called upon by  
the Executive of their state in the month  
of March—and that nothing but military  
force could effect the transport for our  
present wants. Parties were ordered  
out accordingly and the officers com-  
manding them directed to receive their  
Instructions from him.  
  
May 11th—Major Genl. Heath set out  
this day for the Eastn. States, provided  
with Instructions, and letters couched in  
strong terms—representing the distresses  
of the army for want of provisions and  
the indispensable necessity of keeping  
up regular supplies by the adoption of a  
plan which will have system and per-  
manency in’t—  
  
This day also I received advice from  
Colo Dayton that 10 ships of the line,  
and 3 or 4000 Troops had sailed from  
New York.—the intelligence was imme-  
diately communicated to Congress, and  
to the French Genl. &amp; admiral at R Isld.  
  
May 12th—Colo. Dayton’s intelligence,  
so far as respected the sailing of Troops,  
was confirmed by two sensible deserters  
from Kings bridge; which place they  
left yesterday morning at two o’clock—  
they add the detachment consisted of  
the Grenadrs (Bh)—the corps of Anspach  
(two Battalions) &amp; the 37th &amp; 43d Brit-  
tish regiments, amounting, as is supposed,  
to about 2000 men under the command  
of Majr Genl. Redeisel.—

a detachment is expected to sail to-mor-  
row from New York, and said to consist  
of the Anspach Troops—43d B. Regi-  
ment, remainder of the 76th.—8oth, 17th  
Dragoons, &amp; Infantry of the same—to be  
conveyed by 7 ships of the line, 2 fifties  
&amp; 3 forty fours which are to cruize of the  
Capes of Virginia—He gives it as the  
opinion of C—Junr. that the above de-  
tachmt does not exceed 2000 men—  
that not more than 4000 remain—wch  
is only (he adds) to be accounted for on  
the supposition of their expecting a re-

Major (Flag) killed—three officers &amp; a  
surgeon taken prisoners (the latter &amp;  
two of the former wounded)—a sergeant

33 made prisoners &amp; missing—in all 44  
besides officers—  
  
The report of the number of shipping  
&amp;ca at Fort Lee was this day contra-  
dicted in part—the number of vessels  
being reduced, &amp; said to be no higher  
than Bulls-ferry—in consequence of this  
intelligence Lt. Col Badlam who marched  
with the detachment of 200 men pur-  
suant to the orders of yesterday &amp; had  
reached Stony point halted—but was  
directed not to return till the designs of  
the enemy were better understood.  
  
May 17th—Received a letter from  
Captn Lawrence, near Dobbs’s ferry,  
informing me that abt. 200 Refugees  
were building a block house &amp; raising  
other works at Fort Lee.—order’d the  
detachment which had halted at Kings  
Ferry &amp; another forming under Colo.  
Scammel to advance down &amp; endeavor  
to. annoy if they could not prevent  
them.  
  
A Letter from Genl. Foreman of Mon-

that the British fleet from New York  
consisting of seven ships of 60 Guns &amp;  
upwards—12 large Transport vessels, &amp;  
10 top sail schooners &amp; sloops made sail  
from Sandy hook the 12th, with the wind

112  
  
o’clock it was clear of the hook—and  
steering southward.—

(that is Clinton) was requested to do if  
it appear’d to be the sense of the Gov-

State that it would be eligable.  
  
Set out this day for the Interview at

prepared and forwarded dispatches to  
the Governors of the four New England  
states calling upon them in earnest &amp;  
pointed terms, to compleat their Conti-

ready to march in one week after being

I also sollicited the Governors of the  
States of Massachusetts &amp; Connecticut  
earnestly for a Loan of Powder &amp; the  
means of Transporting it to the Army.  
  
A Letter from Genl. St. Clair came to

May 25th — Breakfasted at Squire

Schuyler &amp; Clinton full of uncertain in-  
formation respecting the enemys landing  
at Crown point &amp; intention to penetrate  
on the Hudson &amp; Mohawk Rivers.—this  
uncertainty respects the number, not the  
fact—the latter seeming to be beyond a

May 26th—Received a Letter from the  
Honble Jno. Laurens minister from the  
United States of America at the Court  
Versailles—informing me that the sum  
of 6,000,000 of Livres was granted as a  
donation to this country—to be applied  
in part to the purchase of arms—cloaths  
—&amp;ca for the American Troops and the  
ballance to my orders. &amp; draughts at long  
sight.—and that a Fleet of 20 Sail of the  
Line&#x27;was on its departure for the West  
Indies 12 of which were to proceed to  
  
113  
  
this Coast where it was probable they  
might arrive in the month of July.—He  
also added that the Courts of Petersby.  
&amp; Vienna had offered their mediation in  
settling the present troubles wch. the  
King of France, tho’ personally pleased  
with, could not accept without consult-  
ing his allies—A Letter from Doctr.  
Lee inclosing extracts from his Brother  
Wm. Lee Esqr. dated the 2oth of Feby  
holds out strong assurances of Peace  
being restored in the course of this yr.  
  
May 28th—The commanding officer  
of artillery—&amp; the chief Engineer were  
called upon to give in estimates of their  
wants for the intended operation against  
New York.—The intention of doing this  
was also disclosed to the Q M General  
who was desired to give every attention  
toward the Boats, that a number of them  
might be prepared; &amp; provide other mat-  
ters necessary to such an undertaking  
—especially those things which might be  
called for by the Artillery, &amp; the En-  
gineering departments.  
  
May 31st—A Letter from Count de  
Rochambeau informed me that the  
British fleet had left Block Island.—  
that Adml. de Barras would sail with  
the first fair wind for Boston (having  
goo of his soldiers on Board to man his  
fleet)—and that he should commence his  
march as soon as possible but would be  
under the necessity of Halting a few  
days at Providence—  
  
A Letter from Major Talmage, inclos-  
ing one from C. Senr. &amp; another from S.  
G. dated the 27th. were totally silent on  
the subject of an evacuation of New  
York ; but speak of an order for march-  
ing the Troops from Long Island—and  
the Countermand of it after they had

commenced their march ; the cause for  
either they could not assign—Neither C.  
Senr. nor S G, estimate the enemys

Intelligence from C —— Sent, dated 729 (a cipher date)—‘‘a detachment is expected to sail to-  
morrow from New York,” and then specifically names the regiments ‘‘ to be convoyed by 7 ships of  
the line, 2 fifties, &amp; 3 forty-fours, which are to cruise off the Capes of Virginia. He gives it as the  
opinion of C—— Jun’, that the above detachment does not exceed 2000 men—that not more than
