Courteous Reader,  
Astrology is one of the most ancient Sciences, had in high Esteem of old, by the Wise and Great. Formerly, no Prince would make War or Peace, nor any General fight a Battle, in short, no important Affair was undertaken without first consulting an Astrologer, who examined the Aspects and Configurations of the heavenly Bodies, and mark’d the lucky Hour. Now the noble Art (more Shame to the Age we live in!) is dwindled into Contempt; the Great neglect us, Empires make Leagues, and Parliaments Laws, without advising with us; and scarce any other Use is made of our learned Labours, than to find the best Time of cutting Corns, or gelding Pigs. This Mischief we owe in a great Measure to ourselves: The Ignorant Herd of Mankind, had they not been encourag’d to it by some of us, would never have dared to depreciate our sacred Dictates; but Urania has been betray’d by her own Sons; those whom she had favour’d with the greatest Skill in her divine Art, the most eminent Astronomers among the Moderns, the Newtons, Halleys, and Whistons, have wantonly contemn’d and abus’d her, contrary to the Light of their own Consciences. Of these, only the last nam’d, Whiston, has liv’d to repent, and speak his Mind honestly. In his former Works he had treated Judiciary Astrology as a Chimera, and asserted, That not only the fixed Stars, but the Planets (Sun and Moon excepted) were at so immense a Distance, as to be incapable of any Influence on this Earth, and consequently nothing could be foretold from their Positions: but now in the Memoirs of his Life, publish’d 1749, in the 82d Year of his Age, he foretels, Page 607, the sudden Destruction of the Turkish Empire, and of the House of Austria, German Emperors, &amp;c. and Popes of Rome; the Restoration of the Jews, and Commencement of the Millennium; all by the Year 1766; and this not only from Scripture Prophecies; but (take his own Words) “From the remarkable astronomical Signals that are to alarm Mankind of what is coming, viz. The Northern Lights since 1715; the six Comets at the Protestant Reformation in four Years, 1530, 1531, 1533, 1534, compar’d with the seven Comets already seen in these last eleven Years 1737, 1739, 1742, 1743, 1744, 1746, and 1748. From the great Annular Eclipse of the Sun, July 14, 1748, whose Center pass’d through all the four Monarchies, from Scotland to the East-Indies. From the Occultation of the Pleiades by the Moon each periodical Month, after the Eclipse last July, for above three Years, visible to the whole Roman Empire; as there was a like Occultation of the Hyades from A. 590, to A. 595, for six Years foretold by Isaiah. From the Transit of Mercury over the Sun, April 25, 1753, which will be visible thro’ that Empire. From the Comet of A.D. 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682, which will appear again about 1757 ending, or 1758 beginning, and will also be visible thro’ that Empire. From the Transit of Venus over the Sun, May 26, 1761, which will be visible over the same Empire: And lastly, from the annular Eclipse of the Sun, March 11, 1764, which will be visible over the same Empire.” From these Astronomical Signs, he foretels those great Events, That within 16 Years from this Time, “the Millennium or 1000 Years Reign of Christ shall begin, there shall be a new Heavens, and a new Earth; there shall be no more an Infidel in Christendom, Page 398, nor a Gaming-Table at Tunbridge!” When these Predictions are accomplished, what glorious Proofs they will be of the Truth of our Art? And if they happen to fail, there is no doubt but so profound an Astronomer as Mr. Whiston, will be able to see other Signs in the Heavens, foreshowing that the Conversion of Infidels was to be postponed, and the Millennium adjourn’d. After these great Things can any Man doubt our being capable of predicting a little Rain or Sun-shine? Reader, Farewell, and make the best Use of your Years and your Almanacks, for you see, that according to Whiston, you may have at most, but sixteen more of them.  
R. Saunders  
Patowmack, July 30, 1750.

If she sent him Word by the Boy, that it had struck Twelve; Tell her to be easy, it can never be more. If, that it had struck One, Bid her be comforted, for it can never be less.  
If we lose our Money, it gives us some Concern. If we are cheated or robb’d of it, we are angry: But Money lost may be found; what we are robb’d of may be restored: The Treasure of Time once lost, can never be recovered; yet we squander it as tho’ ’twere nothing worth, or we had no Use for it.  
  
The Bell strikes One: We take no Note of Time,  
But from its Loss. To give it then a Tongue  
Is wise in Man. If heard aright  
It is the Knell of our departed Hours;  
Where are they? With the Years beyond the Flood:  
It is the Signal that demands Dispatch;  
How much is to be done? ——  
Be wise To-day, ’tis Madness to defer;  
Next day the fatal Precedent will plead;  
Thus on, till Wisdom is push’d out of Life:  
Procrastination is the Thief of Time,  
Year after Year it steals till all are fled,  
And to the Mercies of a Moment leaves  
The vast Concerns of an eternal Scene.

That admirable Instrument the Microscope has opened to us of these latter Ages, a World utterly unknown to the Ancients. There are very few Substances, in which it does not shew something curious and unexpected; but for the Sake of such Readers as are unacquainted with that Instrument, I shall set down some of the most remarkably entertaining Objects, upon which actual Observations have been made.  
1. The Globules of the Blood, which are computed to be almost a two thousandth Part of an Inch in Diameter, each consisting of six small Globules, each of which again probably consists of six smaller, and so on. The Circulation of the Blood is to be seen very distinctly in the Tail of a small Fish, the Web of the Foot of a Frog, &amp;c. and the Globules to split and divide, before they can enter the smallest Vessels.  
2. The Bones of all Creatures, sliced extremely thin, afford an entertaining Object for the Microscope, consisting of innumerable Perforations, and Ramifications, disposed in an endless Variety of Forms.  
3. The Flesh of all Land and Sea Animals dried, and cut into very thin Slices, gives a beautiful View of the various Fibres, and their Convolutions. The Brain, the spinal Marrow, and even the Hairs of Animals, exhibit different Curiosities.  
4. The human Skin, by the Help of the Microscope, is found to be covered over with an infinite Number of Scales lying over one another, as in fishes; and it is probably the same in other Animals. It has been computed that a Grain of Sand will cover two hundred of these Scales.  
  
5. All Sorts of Feathers, especially those of the Peacock, afford a surprizing View in the Microscope. It is supposed that a single Feather contains no less than a Million of different Parts.  
6. Flies are found by the Microscope to be produced from Eggs laid by the Mothers, from whence they are hatched in the Form of Maggots, or small Worms, which are afterwards transformed into Aurelias, and these into perfect Flies. This is the Process most of the winged Insects go through in their Production. They have a great Number of Eyes fixed to their Heads, so that they see on all Sides around them, without turning their Heads or Eyes. A common Fly is supposed to have eight thousand, and a great Drone Fly no less than fourteen thousand Eyes, with a distinct optic Nerve to each; and each Eye appears through the Microscope, tho’ magnified many hundred thousand Times, more exactly shaped, and more curiously polished, than human Art could finish an Object as large as the whole Cluster, containing seven thousand distinct ones. The Wings of Flies, especially of the Moth and Butterfly Kind, are found to be contrived with admirable Art, to answer their Use, and with inimitable Beauty and Ornament. The Dust, which sticks to the Fingers, when we handle them, is found to be Feathers; each of which has its Quill and vane Parts as compleat as that of a Fowl or a Goose, and are inserted in the Film of the Wing, with the utmost Regularity of Arrangement. With the Microscope, the Stings of Moths and Bees appear to be Instruments finished to the highest Perfection; their Points, and saw-like Teeth, being perfectly polished and sharp; whereas the Edge of a Razor appears like that of a Butcher’s Cleaver, and the Point of a Lancet like an iron Spike just come from the Anvil.  
7. By the Help of the Microscope the innumerable and inconceivably minute Animalcules in various Fluids are discovered, of the Existence of which we have no Reason to suppose any Mortal had the least Suspicion, till last Century. In the Melt of a single Cod-fish ten Times more living Creatures are contained, than the Inhabitants of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, taking it for granted, that all Parts of the World are as well peopled as Holland, which is very far from being the Case. Of a certain Species some are discovered so extremely minute, that it has been computed, three Millions of them, or three Times the Number of the Inhabitants of London and Westminster, would not equal the Bulk of a Grain of Sand. Of Animalcules, some Species resemble Tadpoles, Serpents or Eels, others are of a roundish or oval Form, others of very curiously turned and various Shapes; but in general they are extremely vigorous and lively, and almost constantly in Motion. Animalcules are to be found (besides those in the Bodies of Animals) in the Infusions of Pepper, Senna, Pinks, Roses, Jessamin, Tea, Rasberry Stalks, Fennel, Sage, Melons, sour Grapes, Wheat, Hay, Straw, and almost all vegetable Substances; in the Water, that is in the Shells of Oysters, Cockles, and other Shell-fish, in the Foulness upon our Teeth, and those of other Animals, in our Skins when affected with certain Diseases; in Vinegar, and Paste, and so on infinitely. In each of these Substances, when exposed to the Air some Time, Multitudes of living Creatures, beyond the Reach of Numbers, are discovered, of which many Hundreds of Species are already known, as different from one another as those of the largest Animals, and very probably there are many more yet unknown. As it is certain, that in the above mentioned Fluids few or no Animalcules are to be found, when covered from the Air, but when open to the Access of the Air, their Numbers are beyond reckoning; it is hardly to be doubted, but that either the Air is replete with infinite Multitudes of living Creatures too small for Sight, which come and deposite their Eggs in Places proper for the Nutrition of the Young, or that their Eggs are floating every where in the Air, and falling promiscuously every where, only those are hatched, or come to Perfection, which fall upon Places fitted for them, and the others perish. However it is, the countless Numbers of those living Creatures, the Profusion of Life every where to be observed, is above Measure astonishing, and shews the Maker to be an infinite Being.  
8. By the Help of the Microscope, we find that the Scales of almost every different Fish are different from those of others, in internal Texture; and that all of them are wrought with surprising Art and Beauty.  
9. By Means of this noble Instrument we find, that the Seeds of almost all Manner of Vegetables contain in them the Stamina of the future Plant or Tree, and that their Production from the Seed, and their Growth to Maturity is only the Swelling and Enlarging of the Stamina by the Addition of nutritious Juices. It is probable the Manner of Production and Growth of Animals is analogous to this. The Fertility of some Plants is almost beyond Belief. One particularly is said by Naturalists to produce annually a Million of Seeds from one. The Farina of Flowers is found by the help of the Microscope to be a regular organized Body, and not a meer Dust, as it appears to the naked Eye, and is reasonably supposed to be necessary to Fertility in Plants and Trees.  
10. By the Microscope have been discovered many singular Properties of that most unaccountable of all Creatures the Polype, which is found at the Bottom of Ditches, and standing Waters; whose Manner of Production, Feeding and Digestion, are different from those of all other Animals. The young ones come out of the Sides of the old, like Buds and Branches from Trees, and at length drop off perfect Polypes. They do not seem to be of different Sexes. They take in Worms, and other Sustenance, by Means of a Sett of long Arms or Antennae, which surround their Mouths, and after keeping them some Time in their Stomachs, throw them out again the same Way. The Animal’s Body consists of a single Cavity, like a Tube or Gut, and what is wonderful, and almost beyond Belief, is, that it will live and feed after it is turned inside out, and even when cut into a great many Pieces, each several Piece becomes a compleat Polype. They are infested with a Kind of Vermin, as are almost all Animals from the largest down to Bees and other Insects. These Vermin sometimes in a long Time will eat up the Head and Part of the Body of a Polype, after which, if it be cleared of them, it shall have the devoured Parts grow up again, and become as compleat as ever. Some Polypes have around their Mouths a Sort of Plume, which they whirl round, and making with it an Eddy in the Water, draw in their Prey, and devour it.  
11. By the Microscope it is found, that neither the Wood, the Bark, the Root, the Leaves, the Fruit, nor even the Pith of the meanest Vegetable is a Mass of crude or indigested Matter; but that every different Species is different in its internal Structure, and all curiously and delicately wrought. A Bit of Cork, cut extremely thin, a Slice of Oak or Fir, or a Bit of Elder Pith, in the Microscope, are so many curious Pieces of Mosaic Work. Even a Bit of Charcoal or burnt Wood appears with the Microscope an admirable Object.  
12. By this Instrument it is found, that what we call Mouldiness upon Flesh, Leather, or other Substances, is no other than a great Number of extremely small, but perfect Plants, having Stalks and Tops like Mushrooms, and sometimes an Appearance of Leaves. The Seeds of these minute Plants must, in all Probability, be diffused universally through the Air, and falling upon Substances fit for their Growth, spring up in astonishing Profusion. There is, in short, no End of microscopic Objects. A Sprig of Moss, with the Help of that Instrument, is found to be a regular Plant, consisting of a Root, a Stock, Branches, Leaves, &amp;c. and Naturalists tell us, there are some Hundreds of different Species of it. A Bit of Spunge before the Microscope is a curious Piece of Net-work. Every different chymical Salt has its parts differently figured. A Leaf of a common stinging Nettle, the Beard of a wild Oat, the Surfaces of some Pebble-stones, a Flake of Snow, a few Grains of Sand, or almost any natural Thing, with this Instrument, exhibit exquisite Beauties; while, on the contrary, the most delicate Works of Art, can by no Means bear its Examination; but degenerate before it into Masses of Irregularity, and Deformity.

What will not Lux’ry taste? Earth, Sea, and Air,  
Are daily ransack’d for the Bill of Fare.  
Blood stuff’d in Guts is British Christian’s Food,  
And France robs Marshes of the croaking Brood;

With Brass or Steel, that on the rocky Shore,  
First broke the oozy Oister’s pearly Coat,  
And risk’d the living Morsel down his Throat.

Vice luring, in the Way of Virtue lies,  
God suffers This; but tempts not; tho’ He tries.  
Go wrong, go right, ’tis your own Action still;  
He leaves you to your Choice, of Good, or Ill.  
Then chuse the Good! the Ill submisly bear!  
The Man of Virtue is above Despair.  
Safe on this Maxim with the Writer rest,  
That all that happens, happens for the best.

What more valuable than Gold? Diamonds. Than Diamonds? Virtue.

Ye Party Zealots, thus it fares with you,  
When Party Rage too warmly you pursue;

And Folly joins whom Sentiments divide.  
You vent your Spleen as Monkeys when they pass,  
Scratch at the mimic Monkey in the Glass,  
While both are one; and henceforth be it known,  
Fools of both Sides shall stand as Fools alone.  
  
If worldly Goods cannot save me from Death, they ought not to hinder me of eternal Life.  
’Tis great Confidence in a Friend to tell him your Faults, greater to tell him his.  
September. VII Month.  
  
Ah! What is Life? With Ills encompass’d round,  
Amidst our Hopes, Fate strikes the sudden Wound;  
To-day the Statesman of new Honour dreams,  
To-morrow Death destroys his airy Schemes.  
Is mouldy Treasure in thy Chest confin’d;  
Think, all that Treasure thou must leave behind;  
Thy Heir with Smiles shall view thy blazon’d Hearse,  
And all thy Hoards, with lavish Hand disperse.  
  
Talking against Religion is unchaining a Tyger; The Beast let loose may worry his Deliverer.  
Ambition often spends foolishly what Avarice had wickedly collected.  
October. VIII Month.  
  
Should certain Fate th’impending Blow delay,  
Thy Mirth will sicken, and thy Bloom decay;  
Then feeble Age will all thy Nerves disarm,  
No more thy Blood its narrow Channels warm;  
Who then would wish to stretch this narrow Span,  
To suffer Life beyond the Date of Man?  
The virtuous Soul pursues a nobler Aim,  
And Life regards but as a fleeting Dream.  
  
  
Pillgarlic was in the Accusative Case, and bespoke a Lawyer in the Vocative, who could not understand him till he made use of the Dative.  
  
Great Estates may venture more;  
Little Boats must keep near Shore.  
  
Nice Eaters seldom meet with a good Dinner.  
November. IX Month.  
  
She longs to wake, and wishes to get free,  
To launch from Earth into Eternity.  
For while the boundless Theme extends our Thought,  
Ten thousand thousand rolling Years are nought.  
O endless Thought! divine Eternity!  
Th’immortal Soul shares but a Part of thee;  
For thou wert present when our Life began,  
When the warm Dust shot up in breathing Man.  
  
Not to oversee Workmen, is to leave them your Purse open.  
The Wise and Brave dares own that he was wrong.  
Cunning proceeds from Want of Capacity.  
It is an amusing Speculation to look back, and compute what Numbers of Men and Women among the Ancients, clubb’d their Endeavours to the Production of a single Modern. As you reckon backwards the Number encreases in the same Proportion as the Price of the Coat which was sold for a Half-penny a Button, continually doubled.

Carry the Reckoning back 300 Years farther, and the Number amounts to above 500 Millions; which are more than exist at any one Time upon Earth, and shews the Impossibility of preserving Blood free from such Mixtures, and that the Pretension of such Purity of Blood in ancient Families is a mere Joke.

The Day is of two Sorts, Mean and Solar; the Mean or equal Day is always 24 Hours exactly, and is the Day which all good Pendulum Clocks and Watches should exactly measure. The Solar, apparent, or natural Day, is pointed out by a good Sun Dial; or is that Space of Time that intervenes between the Sun’s leaving a given Meridian in the Heavens, and returning to it again; and does almost perpetually differ from the Mean or equal Day; as consequently a good Pendulum Clock, accurately adjusted, will almost perpetually differ from an exact Sun-Dial.

From angry heav&#x27;n when the keen lightning flies,  
When fervent heat diſſolves the melting ſkies,

When the warm duſt ſhot up in breathing man.  
  
Ah! what is life ? with ills encompaſs&#x27;d round,  
Amidf our hopes, fate ſtrikes the ſudden wound:  
To-day the ſtateſman of new honour dreams,

Thy mirth will ficken and thy bloom decay ;  
  
Then feeble age will all thy nerves diſarm,  
  
No more thy blood its narrow channels warm.  
Who then would wiſh to ſtretch this narrow ſpan,  
To ſuffer life beyond the date of man?  
  
The virtuous ſoul purſues a nobler aim,  
And life regards but as a fleetiag dream:  
She longs to wake, and wiſhes to get free,  
To lanch from earth into eternity.  
For while the boundleſs theme extends our thought,  
Ten thouſand thouſand rolling years are nought.

Ah! what is life? with ills incompaſs&#x27;d round,  
Amid(t our hopes, fate ſtrikes the ſudden wound :  
To-day the ſtateſman of new honour dreams,  
To-morrow death deſtroys his airy ſchemes ;  
Is mouldy treaſure in thy cheſt confin&#x27;d ;  
Think all that treaſure thou muſt leave behind ;  
Thy heir with ſmiles ſhall view thy blazon&#x27;d herſe,  
And all thy hoards with laviſh hand diſperſe.  
Should certain fate th&#x27; impending blow delay,  
Thy mirth will ſicken, and thy bloom decay;

Then feeble age will all thy nerves diſarm,  
No more thy blood its narrow channels warm.  
Who then would wiſh to ſtretch this narrow ſpan,  
To ſuffer life beyond the date of man?  
  
The virtuous ſoul purſues a nobler aim,  
And life regards but as a fleeting dream :  
She longs to wake, and wiſhes to get free,  
To launch from earth into eternity.  
For while the boundleſs theme extends our thought,  
Ten thouſand thouſand rolling years are nought.

ETERNITY.  
  
Ere the foundations of the world were laid,  
  
Ere kindling light th’ Almighty word obeyed,  
  
Thou wert; and, when the subterraneous flame  
Shall burst its prison, and devour this frame.  
  
From angry heaven when the keen lightning flies.  
When fervent heat dissolves the melting skies,  
Thou still Shalt be; still as thou wert before,  
  
And know no change, when time shall be no more.  
O endless thought! divine eternity • ^  
  
Th’ immortal soul shares but a part of thee ;  
  
For thou wert present when our life began.  
  
When the warm dust shot up in breathing man.  
  
Ah &#x27; what is life? with ills encompassed round,  
AraidJt our hopes, fate strikes the sudden wound:  
T(^ay the statesman of new honour dreams.  
To-morrow death destroys his airy schemes.  
  
Is mouldy treasure in thy chest confin’d.  
  
Think all that treasure thou must leave behind;  
Thy heir with smiles shall view thy blazon’d hearse,  
And all thy hoards with lavish hand disperse.  
Should certain fate th’ impending blow delay.  
  
Thy mirth will sicken, and thy bloom decay;  
  
Then feeble age will all thy nerves disarm.  
  
No more thy mood its narrow channels warm.  
  
Who then would wish to stretch this narrow span,  
To suffer life beyond the date of man!  
  
The virtuous soul pursues a nobler aim  
And life regards but as a fleeting dream:  
  
She longs to wake, and wishes to get free.  
  
To launch from earth into eternity.  
  
For, while the boundless theme extends our thought.  
Ton thousand thousand rolling years are naught.

“ Courteous Reader,—Astrology is one of the most  
ancient sciences, held in high esteem of old by the wise  
and great. Formerly no prince would make war or  
peace, nor any general fight a battle ; in short, no im-  
portant affair was undertaken without first consulting  
an Astrologer, who examined the aspects and configu-  
rations of the heavenly bodies, and marked the lucky  
hour. Now the noble art (more shame to the age we  
live in) is dwindled into contempt; the great neglect  
us; empires make leagues and parliament laws with-  
out advising with us ; and scarce any other use is made  
of our learned labors, than to find out the best time of  
cutting corns and gelding pigs. This mischief we owe  
in a great measure to ourselves; the ignorant herd of  
mankind, had they not been encouraged to it by some  
of us, would never have dared to depreciate our sacred  
  
  
  
dictates; but Urania has been betrayed by her own  
sons; those whom she had favored with the greatest  
skill in her divine art, the most eminent Astronemers  
among the moderns, the Mewtons, Halleys aud Whistons,  
have wantonly contemned and abused her contrary to  
the light of their own consciences. Of these, only the  
last named, Whiston, has lived to repent and speak his  
mind honestly. Ip his former works he had treated  
judicial astrology as a chimera, and asserted that not only  
ihe fixed stars, but the planets (sun and moon excepted)  
were at so immense a distance as to be incapable of any  
influence on this earth, and consequently nothing could  
be foretold from their positions ; but now, in the me-  
1749, in the eighty-second  
of his age, he foretells, page 607, the sudden destruction  
of the ‘Turkish Empire and of the House of Austria,  
German Emperors, &amp;c. and Popes of Rome; the Res-  
toration of the Jews and commencement of the Mille.  
nium, all: by the year 1766, and this not only from  
Scriptural prophecies, but (take his own words) “ from  
the remarkable .2stronomical signals that are to alarm  
  
moirs of his life, published  
  
mankind of what is coming, viz. the Northern Liehts  
sinee 1715, the six comets at the Protestant Reforma-  
tion in four years, 1530, 1531, 1533, 1534, compared  
with the seven comets already seen in these last eleven  
years, 1757, 1739, 1742, 1744, 1746, and 1748—from  
the great annular eclipse of the sun July 14, 1748,  
whose centre passed through all the four monarchies  
from Scotland to the Kast Indies—from the occultation  
of the Pleiades by the moon each periodical month after  
the eclipse last July, for above three years visible to  
the whole Roman Empire—from the comet of A.D,  
1456, 1531, 1607 and 1682, which will appear again  
about 1757 ending, or 1758 beginning, and will also be  
visible through that Empire—from the Transit of Venus  
over the Sun May 26, 1761, which will be visible over  
the same Empire: and lastly, from the annular eclipse  
of the sun March 11, 1764, which will be visible over  
the same Empire.” From these Astronomical signs he  
foretold those great events—that within sixteen years  
from this time, ‘*the Millenium or 1000 years reign of  
Christ shall begin; there shall be a new heaven and @  
new earth; there shall be no more an infidel in Chris-  
tendom, nor a gaming table at Tunbridge!” When  
these predictions are accomplished, what glorious proois  
will they be of the truth of our art! And if they happen  
to fail there is no doubt that so profound an Astronomer  
as Mr. Whiston, will be able to see other signs in the  
heavens, foreshowing that the conversion of the infidels  
was to be postponed and the Millenium adjourned.  
After these great things, can any man doubt our heirs  
capable of predicting a little rain or sunshine? Reader,  
farewell, and make the best use of your years and your  
Almanacks, for you see that according to Whiston, you  
may have at most but sixteen more of them.  
R. SAUNDERS,  
  
Patowmack, July 30, 1750.

I feel the solemn sound. If heard aright,  
It is the knell of my departed hours.”  
There is also merit in the following:—  
* All men think all men mortal! but themselves.”  
** A man of pleasure is a man of pains.”  
“ To feel is to be fir&#x27;d;  
And to believe, Lorenzo, is to feel.”  
  
But these few exhaust the  
elegant extracts worthy to be culled from this once

 a birthday, or  
  
a New Year’s Day, should come and go unnoted by a  
thoughtful person. “Time is the stuff that life is  
made of ;” and time is known to us only through  
its divisions. “Our conception of time originates in  
that of motion ””—of progression. “ Duration, as set  
out? by certain periods, and marked by certain  
measures or epochs, is that which most properly we  
call Time.” And as we are commonly undisturbed  
by “the inaudible and noiseless foot of Time,” it  
must be that the sounding clock of the years which  
tells us that another period is passed should arouse  
us to thought and reflection.  
If heard aright,  
  
It is the knell of our departed hours :  
  
Where are they? With the years beyond the flood.

here the spirit  
drove; but the fact was that Cowley did not understand the  
principle of Pindar’s form, and mistook it for formlessness.  
However admirable writing an ode may contain, unless the  
principle of its construction appear, half the pleasure is lost;  
and on this account, as well as their frequent prosiness, Cowley’s  
odes must be pronounced failures, all but the magnificent Ode to  
the Royal Society, which is admirable in both matter and manner.  
From the rest the reader will but glean a line here and a phrase  
there to please him. Thus, in one he says of Fame in a fine,  
  
ironical couplet :  
Some with vast, costly tombs would purchase it,  
And by the proofs of death pretend to live.

Be wise to-day ; ’tis madness to defer ;  
  
Next day the fatal precedent will plead ;  
Thus on, till wisdom is pushed out of life.  
Procrastination is the thief of time ;  
  
Year after year it steals, till all are fled,  
  
And to the mercies of a moment leaves  
  
The vast concerns of an eternal scene.  
  
If not so frequent, would not this be strange?  
That ’tis so frequent, this is stranger still.
