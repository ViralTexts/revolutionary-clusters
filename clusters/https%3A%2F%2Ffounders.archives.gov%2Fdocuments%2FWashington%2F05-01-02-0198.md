rce has been considerably curtailed, for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for fault of remittance; the usefull arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection. Though I would not force the introduction of manufactures, by extravagant encouragements, and to the prejudice of agriculture; yet, I conceive, much might be done in that way by woman, children &amp; others; without taking one really necessary hand from tilling the earth. Certain it is, great savings are already made in many articles of apparel, furniture  
  
and consumption. Equally certain it is, that no diminution in agriculture has taken place, at the time when greator and more substantial improvements in manufactures were making, than were ever before known in America. In Pennsylvania they have attended particularly to the fabrication of cotten cloths, hats, and all articles in leather. In Massachusetts they are establishing factories of Duck, Cordage, Glass and several other extensive and useful branches. The number of shoes made in one town and nails in another is incredible. In that State and Connecticut are also factories of superfine and other broad cloths. I have been writing to our friend Genl Knox this day, to procure me homespun broad cloth, of the Hartford fabric, to make a suit of cloaths for myself. I hope it will not be a great while, before it will be unfashionable for a gentleman to appear in any other dress. Indeed we have already been to long subject to British prejudices.
