You will be surprized perhaps at receiving a letter from me—but if the end is answered for which it is written, I shall not think my time miss-spent. Your Father, who seems to entertain a very favourable opinion of your prudence, &amp; I hope, you merit it;  
in one or two of his letters to me, speaks of the difficulty he is under to make you remittances. Whether this arises from the scantiness of his funds, or the extensiveness of your demands is matter of conjecture, with me—I hope it is not the latter, because common prudence,  
&amp; every other consideration which ought have weight in a reflecting mind is opposed to your requiring more than his conveniency and a regard to his other Children will enable him to pay—&amp; because he holds up no idea in his Letter, which would support me in the  
conclusion. Yet when I take a view of the inexperience of youth, the temptation, &amp; vices of Cities; and the distresses to which our Virginia Gentlemen are driven by an accumulation of Taxes &amp; the want of a market; I am almost inclined to ascribe it in part to both.  
Therefore, as a friend, I give you the following advice.  
Let the object, which carried you to Philadelphia be always before your Eyes—remember, that it is not the mere study of the Law, but to become eminent in the profession of it which is to yield honor and profit. The first was your choice; let the second be  
your ambition. and that dissipation, is incompatible with both.  
That the Company in which you will improve most, will be least expensive to you—and yet I am not such a stoic as to suppose you will, or to think it right that you ought, always to be in Company with Senators &amp; Philosophers; but, of the young and  
juvenile kind let me advice you to be choice. It is easy to make acquaintances but very difficult to shake them off, however irksome &amp; unprofitable they are found after we have once committed ourselves to them—the indiscretions &amp; scrapes which very often they  
involuntarily lead one into, proves equally distressing &amp; disgraceful.  
Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence—true friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo &amp; withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the  
appellation.  
Let your heart feel for the affliction, &amp; distresses of every one—and let your hand give, in proportion to your purse—remembering always, the estimation of the Widows mite. But, that it is  
not every one who asketh, that deserveth charity; all however are worthy of the enquiry—or the deserving may suffer.  
Do not conceive that fine Clothes make fine Men, any more than fine feathers make fine Birds—A plain genteel dress is more admired and obtains more credit than lace &amp; embroidery in the Eyes of the judicious &amp; sensible.  
The last thing I shall mention is first of importance. and that is, to avoid Gaming—This is a vice which is productive of every possible evil. equally injurious to the Morals &amp; health of its votaries—It is the child of Avarice—the brother of  
inequity—&amp; father of Mischief—It has been the Ruin of many worthy familys—the loss of many a mans honor—&amp; the cause of Suicide. To all those who enter the lists, it is equally fascinating—the successful gamester, pushes his good fortune till it is overtaken by a  
reverse—the loosing gamester, in hopes of retrieving past misfortunes, goes on from bad to worse; till grown desperate, he passes at every thing; and looses his all. In a word, few gain by this abominable practice (the profit if any, being diffused) while thousands are  
injured.  
Perhaps you will say my conduct has anticipated the advice, &amp; that &quot;Not one of these cases apply to me&quot;—I shall be heartily glad of it. It will add not a little to my happiness, to find those to whom I am so nearly connected, pursuing the right walk of

BUSHIROD WASHINGTON.  
Newrekon, January 15, 1783.  
DeaR BesEmon: You will be surprised, perhaps, at re-­  
ceiving a letter from me; but if the end is answered for  
which it is written, I shall not think my time misspent. Your  
father, who seems, to entertain aary a----bts opdinomn of  
-prudence, and I hope you merit it, in one ortwo of his let  
ters to me speaks of the difficulty he is under to make you  
 remittances. Whether this arises from the scantiness of his  
funds or the extensiveness of your demands, is matter of  
conjecture with me. I hope it is not the latter; because  
common prudence, and every other consideration which ought  
to have weight in a reflecting mind, are opposed to your re  
quiring more than his convexience and a regard to his other  
children will enable hin to pay; and because he holds up no  
idea in the letter which would support me in the conclusion.  
Yet when I take a view of the inexperience of youth, the  
temptations and vices of citios, and the distresses to which  
our Virginia gentlemen are driven by an accumulation of  
taxes and the want of a market, I am almost inclined to as.  
cribe it in part to both. Therefore as a friend I give you the  
following advice. Let the ohject which carried you to Philae  
delphia, he always before your eyes. Remember that it is  
not the mere study of the law, but to become eminent in the  
profession of it, that is to yield honor and profit. The first  
was your choice; let the second be your ambition Dissipa  
tion is incompatible with both; the company in which you  
will improve most will be least expensive to you; and yet I  
am not such a stoic as to suppose that you will, or to think i  
right that you should, always be in company with Senators  
and Philosophers; but of the juvenile kind let me advise you  
to be choice. It is easy to make acquaintances, but very dif  
ficult to shake them off, however irksome and unprofitable  
they are found, after we have once committed oarselves to  
them. The indiscretions which, very often, they involuntarily.  
lead one into, prove equnlly distressing and disgraceful.  
Be courteous to all, but intimate with few; and let those  
few be well tried before you give them your confidence.  
True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo  
and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to  
the appellation.  
Let your heart feel for the afllictions and distresses of every  
one, and let your hand give in proportion to your purse; ree  
membering always the estimation of the widow&#x27;s mite, but  
that it is hot every one who asketh that deserveo charity;  
all, however, are worthy of inquiry, or the deserving may  
suffer.  
Do not conceive that fine clothes make fine men, any more  
than fine feathers make fine birds. A plain, genteel dress, is  
more admired, and obtains more credit, than lace and embroi­  
 dery, in the eyes of the judicious and sensible.  
The last thing which I shall mention is first in importance;  
and that is ro Avold GAMino. This is a vice which is pro  
ductive of every possible evil; equally injurious to the more  
als and health of its votaries. It is the child of avarice, the  
brother of iniquity, and the father of mischief? It has been  
the ruin of many orthy families, the loss of many a man&#x27;s  
honor, and the cause of suicide. To all those who enter the  
lists it is equally fascinating. The successful gamester pushes  
his good fortune till it is overtaken by a reverse. The losing  
gamester, in hopes of retrieving past misfortunes, goes on  
from bad to worse, till grown desperate he pushes at every  
thing and loses his all. In a word, few gumn by this abomina  
ble practice, while thousands are injured.  
Perhaps you will say my conduict has anticipated the ade­  
wice&#x27;, and nor one of the cases applics to me. I shall  
heartily glad of it. It will add not a little to my happiness to  
find those to whom I am so nearly connected pursuing the  
right walk of life. It will be the sure rond to my favor, and to  
those honors and places of profit, which their country can be­  
stow, as merit rarely goes unrewarded.

Dear Bushrod.--You will be surprised  
  
perhaps at receiving a letter from me; but  
  
if the end is answered for which it is written  
  
I shall not think my time misspent. Your

you merit it, in one or two of his letters to  
  
me speaks of the difficulty he is under to  
make you remitances. Whether this arises  
  
from the scantiness of his funds or the exten  
  
siveness of your demands, is a matter  
  
conjecture with me. I hope it is not the  
latter; because common prudence, and  
  
every other consideration, which ought  
  
have weight in a reflecting mind, are oppos­  
ed to your requiring more than his conve­

no idea in the latter which would support  
me in the conclusion. Yet when I take a  
view of the inexperience of youth, the temp­

to which our Virginia gentlemen are driven  
  
by an accumulation of taxes and the want of  
  
a market, I am almost inclined to ascribe it  
in part to both. Therefore as a friend I give  
you the following advice. Let the object  
which carried you to Philadelphia, be al­

is not the mere study of the law, but to be  
  
come eminent in the profession of it, that is  
  
to yield lionor and proft. I he lirst was

I am not such a store as to suppose that you  
  
will, or to think it right that you should, al  
  
ways be in company with Senators and Phi­  
losophers; but of the juvenile kind let me  
  
dvise to be choice. It is casy to make ac  
  
quaintances, but very difficult to shake them  
  
off, however irksome and unprofitable they  
  
are found, after we have once committed  
  
ourselves to them. These indiscretions  
  
which, very often, they involuntarily lead  
  
one lito prove equally distressing and dis  
  
graceful.  
Be courteous to all but intimate with few  
ee e ee eo oe  
  
and let those lew be well tried before vou

sity before it is entitled to the appellation.  
  
Let your heart feel for the afflictions and

To BuSRRON WASHINGTON.  
NeWRURON, 15th January, 1783.  
Dear Bushrod. You will be surprised, perhaps,  
at receiving a letter from me; but if the end is an­  
swered for which it is written, I shall not think my  
time misspent. Your father, who seems to enter­  
tain a very favorablo opinion of your prudence,

mands, is matter of conjecture with me. I hope it  
is not the latter; because common prudence, and ev­  
ery other consideration, which ought to have weight  
in a reflecting mind, are opposed to your requiring  
more than his convenience and a regard to his other

lowing advice. Let the object which carried you te

ber it is not the mere study of the law, but become

Be courteous to all, but intimate witn lew ;  
and let those few be well tried before you

is a plant ef slow growth, and. must undergo

Do not conceive that fine clothes make Ins  
men ; any more than fine feathers make fine

To BUSHIROD WAsHInGTON.  
Aewhurgh, 15th Jan. 1783.  
Dear Bushrod.-You will be surprised, perhaps,  
at receiving a letter from me; but if the end is  
answered for which it is written, I shall not think  
my time misspent. Your father, who seems to  
entertain a very favorable opinion of your pru­  
dence, and I hope you merit it, in one or two of  
ms letters to me speaks of the difliculty he is un­  
der to make you remittances. Whether this aris-  
es from the scantiness of his funds or the axten-  
siveness of your demands, is a matter of conjec­  
ture with me. I hope it is not the latter; because  
common prudence, and every other consideration  
st to liave weignt in a tolectins thiid,  
are opposed to your requiring more than his con-  
vehience and a regard to his other children will  
enable him to pay; and because he holds up no  
idea in the letter which would support me in the  
conclusion. Yet when I take a view of the inex­  
perience of youth, the temptations and vices of  
cities, and the distresses to which our Virginia  
gentlemen are driven by an accumulation of taxes  
and the want of a market, I am almost inclined to  
ascribe it in part to both. Therefore as a friend I  
give you the following advice. Let the object  
which carried you to Philadelphita, be always be­  
fore your eyes. Remember that it is not the mere  
stedy of the law, but to become eminent in the  
rraseioe of it, that is to yield honor and profit.  
Iht het was your chole; let the second be your  
ambition. Dissipation is incompatible with both;  
the company in which you will improve most  
will be least expensive to you; and yet I am not  
such a stoic as to suppose that you will, or to  
think it right that you should, always be in the  
company of Senators and Philosophers; but of  
the juvenile kind let me advise you to be choice.  
It is easy to make acquaintances, but very difficult  
to shake them off, however irksome and unprofit­  
able they are found, after we have once commit­  
ted ourselves to them. Those indiscretions which  
very often, they involuntarily lead one into, prove  
equally distressing and disgraceful.  
Be courteous to all but sutimate with few; and  
let those be well tried before you give them your  
confidence.True friendship is a plant of slow  
growth, and must undergo and withstand the  
shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the ap­  
pellation.  heart foel for the afllictions and dise  
tresses of every one, and let your hand give in  
proportion to your purse; remembering always  
the estimation of the widow&#x27;s mite, but that it is  
not every one who asketh that deserveth charity;  
all, however, are worthy after inquiry, or the de­  
erving may suffer.  
Do not conceive that fine clothes make fine men  
any more than fine feathers miake fine birds. A  
plain genteel dress is more adusired, and obtains  
more credit, than lace and embroidery, in the  
eyes of the judicious and sensible.  
The last thing which I shall mention is first in  
importance; and that is to aroid gaming. This is  
a vice, which is peeductive of every possible evil;  
equally injurious to the morals and health of its  
votaries. It is the child of avarice, the brother of  
mniquity and the father of mischief! It has been  
the ruin of many worthy families, the loss of many  
a man&#x27;s honor, and the cause of suicide. To all  
those wno enter the lists it is equally fascinating.  
The successiul gamester pushes his good fortune,  
till it is overtaken by a reverse. The losing game­  
ster, in hope of retrieving past misfortunes, goes  
on from bad to worse, till grown desperate, he  
pushes at every thing and loses his all. In a word,  
lew gain by this abominable practice, while thou­  
sands are injured.  
Perhaps you will say &quot;my conduct has antici­  
pated the advice&quot; and &quot;not one of the cases ap­  
blies to me.&quot; I shall be heartily glad of it. It  
will add not a little to my happiness to find those  
tarwhom I am so nearly connected pursuing the  
favor, and to those honors and places of profit,  
which their country can bestow; as merit rarely  
goes uinrowarded.  
I am, dear Bushrod, your affectionate uncle,

NewsurGH, Jan. 15, 1783.  
  
  
  
Dear Busurop :—You will be surprised, per-  
haps, at receiving a letter from me; but if the  
end is answered for which it is written, I shall  
‘not think my time is misspent. Your father,  
| who seems to entertain a very favorable opinion  
of your prudence, and I hope you merit it, in  
one or two of his letters to me speaks of the dif-  
ficulty he is under to make you remittances.  
Whether this arises from the scantiness of his  
funds or the extensiveness of your demands, is  
matter of conjecture with me. I hope it is not in  
the latter, because common prudence, and every  
other consideration which ought to have weight  
in a reflecting mind, are opposed to your requir-  
ing more than his convenience and a regard to  
his other children will enable him to pay; and  
because he holds up no idea in the letter which  
would support me in the conclusion. Yet when  
  
take a view of the inexperience of youth, the  
temptations and vices of cities, and the distresses  
to which our Virginia gentlemen are driven by  
an accumulation of taxes and the want of a mar-  
ket, I am almost inclined to ascribe it in part to  
both. Therefore as a friend 1 give you the fol-  
lowing advice. Let the object which carried  
you to Philadelphia, be always before your eyes.  
Remember that it is not the mere study of the  
law, but to become eminent in the profession of  
it, that is to yield honor and profit. The first  
was your choice; let the second be your ambi-  
tion. Dissipation is incompatible with both; the  
company in which you will improve most will be  
least expensive to you; and yet I am not sucha  
stoic as to suppose that you will, or think it right  
that you should, always be in company with Sen-  
ators and Philosophers; but of the juvenile kind  
let me advise you to be choice. It is easy to  
make acquaintances, but very difficult to shake  
them off, however irksome and unprofitable they  
are found, after we have once committed our-  
selves to them. The indiscretions which, very  
often, they involuntarily lead one into, prove  
equally distressing and disgraceful.  
  
Be courteous to all, but intimate with few;  
and let those few be well tried before you give  
them your confidence. True friendship is a  
plant of slow growth, and must undergo and  
withstand the shocks of adversity, before it is en-  
titled to the appellation.  
  
Let your heart feel for the afflictions and dis-  
tresses of every one, and let your hand give in  
proportion to your purse; remembering always  
the estimation of the widow’s mite, but that it is

not every one who asketh deserves charity; all,  
however, are worthy of inquiry, or the deserving  
may suffer.  
  
Do not conceive that fine clothes make fine  
men, any more than fine feathers make fine birds.  
A plain, genteel dress, is more admired, and ob-  
tains more credit, than lace and embroidery, in  
the eyes of the judicious and sensible.  
  
The last thing which I shall mention is first in  
  
  
  
importance; and that is ro Avoip GAMING. This  
is a vice which is productive of every possible  
‘qually injurious to the morals and health  
votaries. It is the child of  
  
evil; «  
  
of its avarice, the  
  
ft has been the ruin of many worthy families,  
the loss of many a man’s honor, and the cause  
of suicide. To all those  
  
equally fascinating.  
  
who enter the lists it is

trieving past misfortunes, from bad to  
worse, till grown desperate he pushes at every  
  
thing and loses his all.  
  
goes on  
  
In a word, few gain by  
this abominable practice, while thousands are  
injured.  
Perhaps you will say ‘ my conduct has antici-|  
pated the advice,” and ‘ not one of the cases ap-  
plies to me.”” I shall be heartily glad of it. It  
will add not a little to my happiness to find those  
to whom I am so nearly connected pursuing the  
right walk of life. It will be the sure road _ to  
my favor, and to those honors and places of pro-  
fit, which their countr
