Philadelphia August 31st. 1804.  
I have received Information respecting several Vessels which have of late been armed in, and have sailed from, the different Ports of the United States, some loaded with Articles contraband of War (Gun-Powder is said to be the general Article) others with Cargoes of innocent Goods, and others again in Ballast. After the diligent Inquiry which it has been my Duty to make on so important a Subject I think that I can have the Honor of stating to you with Certainty that several Vessels of the above Description, which are mentioned to be Schooner rigged, have sailed lately from the Port of Baltimore, whilst others, of a larger Size, even Ships of considerable Burthen, and completely equipped for War, have sailed from the Port of Philadelphia bound to the Possessions of His Majesty’s Enemies in the East as well as in the West Indies. It is said that the Object of some of these Equipments is to force a Trade with the Blacks in the Island of St. Domingo, in which Attempt the public Prints have stated, so circumstantially as to leave no Doubt on the Subject, that Two American Vessels have been captured by French Cruizers after making Resistance: but I have strong Reason to believe that the Destination of others, particularly from the Port of Philadelphia, has been with Cargoes of contraband Articles to the Enemies Possessions in the East and West Indies. Let their Destinations, however, be what they may, it cannot, I conceive, but be justly considered that such Armaments on the Part of the Citizens of a neutral State must be attended with Consequences prejudicial to a belligerent Power, and may therefore be deemed rightly as offensive, for which Reason the Law of Nations has stated one of the first Obligations of Neutrality to be that of abstaining from all Participation in warlike Expeditions. The armed Vessels alluded to may become the Property of the King’s Enemies, either by Capture at Sea, or by Purchase in the Ports to which they are destined, and are thus in Readiness to be converted immediately into Instruments of Hostility against His Majesty, whilst, in another Point of View, they are calculated to protect the Vessels, when they are loaded with contraband Articles, against the lawful Search and Detention of a lawfully commissioned Cruizer when the latter shall happen to be of inferior Force. Indeed, I conceive that it may not be giving too great an Extent to the Principle of the Law of Nations, without attending to the Nature of the Cargo, to consider the very Arms, Ammunition and other Implements of War, with which such Vessels are furnished, as contraband Articles, when the vessels have been thus equipped without the Authority of the Nation to which they belong.  
I understand, Sir, that the Armaments in question have, in Fact, taken place under no Commission or Authority whatever from the Government of the United States. I have therefore thought it my Duty to have the Honor of making you acquainted with the Information that has reached me on this Subject, and, if the Observations which I have taken the Liberty to make upon it should happily be conformable to the Sentiments of the American Government, I can safely trust to their Justice, as well as to their Jealousy of observing the most strict Neutrality in the present War, to take such Measures as shall appear to them the most proper for suppressing the illegal Proceedings complained of on the Part of those Individuals Citizens of the United States who shall appear to be concerned in them. I have the Honor to be, with high Respect and Consideration, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant

Philadelphia, .tiugm: 3U/, 1104.  
,R 1 have received information respecting se­  
veral vessels which have of late been armed in, and  
have sailed lrom, die different ports of the United  
States, some loaded with articles contraband of war,  
(gun-powder is said to be the general articles) others  
with cargoes ot innocent goods, and others again m  
ba.last. Aticr die diligent inquiry which it has been  
my duty to mate on so important a subject, I think  
I can have the honourof stating to you with cert;,intv,  
that several vessels ot the above description, which  
are mentioned to be schooner rigged, have sailed  
lately from the port of Baltimore, whilst others, (&gt;fa  
larger size, even ships of considerable burthen, and  
completely equipped for war, have sailed from the  
pert of Philadelphia, hound to the possessions of his  
majesty’s- enemies in the East and West Indies. It  
is said, that the object of some of there equipments is  
to force a trade with the the blacks, in the island of  
St. Domingo, in which attempt, the public!; prints  
have stated, so circumstantially as to leave no doubt  
on the su bject, that two American vessels have been  
captured by French cruisers, after making resistance:  
but i have strong reason to believe, that the dcstina­  
tion of others, particularly fiom the port of l&#x27;hiladcl­  
plna, has been with cargoes of contraband articles to  
the enemies’ possessions in the East and West Indies.  
Let their destination, however, be what they may,  
it cannot, I conceive, but he justly considered, that  
such armament, on the part . f the citizens of a neu­  
tral state, must be attended with consequences pre­  
judicial to a belligerent power, and may therefore  
be deemed rightly as offensive, for which reason the  
law of nations has stated one of the first obligations  
of neutrality to be that of abstaining from all parti­  
cipation in warlike expeditions. 1&#x27;he armed vessel  
alluded to, may become the property of the king’s  
enemies, either by capture at sea, or by purchase in  
the ports to wnich they are destined, and are thus in  
readiness to be converted immediately into instru­  
ments of hostility against his majesty, whilst in ano­  
ther point of view, they are calculated to protect  
the vesseis, when they arc looted w ith contraband  
articles, against the lawful search and detentions of  
a lawfully commissioned cruiser, when the latter  
shall happen to be of inferiour force. Indeed, I con­  
ceive that it may not be giving too great an extent to  
the principle of the law of nations, without attehding  
to the nature of the charge, to consider the very  
arms, ammunition, and others implements of war,  
with which such vessels are furnished, as contraband  
articles, when the vessel)? have been thus equip­  
ped without the authority of the nation to which they  
belong. 1  
  
I understand, sir, that the armaments in question  
have, in fact, taken place under no commission or  
authority whatever from the government of the Unit­  
etl States. I have, therefore, thought it my duty to  
have the honour of making you acquainted with the  
information that has reached me on this subject, and,  
if the observations which I have taken the liberty to  
make upon it should happily be conformable to the  
sentiments of the American government, I can safe­  
ly trust ttr their justice, as well as to their jealousy of  
observing the most strict neutrality in the present  
war, to take such measures as shall appear to them  
the most proper for suppressing the illegal proceed­  
ings complained of on the part of those individuals,  
citizens of the United States, who shall appear to be  
concerned in them.  
I have the honour to be, with high respect and  
consideration, Sir,  
Your most obedient humble servant,

observes “ I have received information respecting  
several vessels which have of late been armed in, anil  
have sailed from the different ports of the U, States,  
some loaded with articles contraband of war (gun­  
powder is said to be the general article) others with  
cargoes of innocent goods, ami others again in ballast.  
—After the diligent enquiry which it has been my du­  
ty to make on so important h subject, I think that I  
can have the honour of stating to you with certainty,  
that several vessels of the above description, which  
are mentioned to be schooner rigged, have sailed  
lately from the port of Baltimore, whilst others of a  
larger size, even ships of considerable burthen, and  
completely equipped for war, have sailed from the  
port of Philadelphia, bound to the possessions of his  
majesty’s enemies in the East as well as the West­  
Indies. It is said the object of these equipments is  
to force a trade with the blacks in the Island of St.  
Domingo, in which attempt the publiek prints have  
| stated so circumstantially, as to leave no doubt on the  
subject, that two American vessels heave been captu­  
red by French cruizcrs, after making resistance.—  
  
Hut i have strong reason to believe, that the destina­  
tion of others, particularly from the port of Philadel­  
phia have been with cargoes of contraband articles  
to the enemies possessions in the East and VVest-In­  
dics.  
[ “ Let their destination, however, be what they  
may, it cannot, I conceive, hut he justly considered,  
that such armaments on the part of the citizens of a  
neutral state, must be attended with consequences  
prejudicial to a belligerent power, and may, there­  
fore, be deemed rightly as offensive, for which rea­  
son the law of nations has stated one of the first obli­  
gations of neutrality to be that of abstaining from all  
participation in warlike expeditions. The armed  
vessels alluded to, may become the property of the  
king’s enemies either by capture at sea, or by pur­  
chase in the ports to which they are destined, and  
are thus in readiness to be converted immediately in­  
to instruments of hostility against his majesty, whilst  
in another point of view, they are calculated to pro­  
tect the vessels when they are loaded with contra­  
band articles, against the lawful search and detenti­  
on of a lawfully commissioned cruizer, wlien the lat­  
ter shall be ot inferionr force. Indeed I conceive that  
it may not be giving too great an extent to the prin­  
ciple of the law of nations, without attending to the  
nature of the cargo, to consider the very arms, am­  
munition and other implements of war with which  
such vessels are furnished as contraband articles,  
when the vessels have been thus equipped without the  
authority of the nation to which they belong.  
M I understand,sir, that the arrangements in ques­  
tion have in fact taken place under no commission or  
authority whatever from the government of the U­  
nited States. 1 have therefore thought it my duty to  
have the honour of making you acquainted with the  
information that has reached me on this subject, and  
if the observations which I have taken the lilrerty to  
make upon it should happily be conformable to the

; lv trust to their justice, as well as to their jealousy of  
observing the most strict neutrality in the present  
war, to take such measures as shall ap|&gt;ear to them  
the most proper for suppressing the illegal proceed­

ed rightly as often five, for which reafon the law

the very arm*, ammunition, and other imple­
