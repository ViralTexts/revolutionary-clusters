r Sir  
Monticello  
May 15. 26.  
The sentiments of justice which have dictated your letters of the 3d and 9th inst. are worthy of all praise, and merit and meet my thankful acknolegements. were your father now living and proposing, as you  are to publish a second edition of his Memoirs, I am satisfied he would  give a very different aspect to the pages of that work which  respect Arnold’s invasion and surprise of Richmond in the winter of 1780–81. he was then, I believe in S. Carolina, too distant from the scene of these transactions to relate them on his own knolege, or even to sift them from the chaff of the rumors then afloat,  rumors which vanished soon before the real truth, as vapors before the sun, obliterated, by their notoriety, from every candid mind, and by the voice of the many who, as actors or spectators, knew what had truly past. the facts shall speak for themselves.General Washington had just given notice to all the Governors on the Sea board, North and South, that an embarcation was taking place at New York, destined for the Southward, as was given out there; and on sunday the 31st of Dec. 1780. we recieved information that a fleet had entered our capes. it happened fortunately that our legislature was at that moment in session, and within two days of their rising. so that, during these two days, we had the benefit of their presence, and of the counsel and information of the members individually. on Monday the 1st of January, we were in suspence as to the destination of this fleet, whether up the bay, or up our river. on Tuesday, at 10. oclock however, we recieved information that they had entered James river; and on general advice, we instantly prepared orders for calling in the militia, one half from the nearer counties and a fourth from the more remote, which would constitute a force of between 4. and 5,000. men, of which orders the members of the legislature, which adjourned that day, took charge, each to his respective county: and we began the removal of every thing from Richmond. the wind being fair and strong the enemy ascended the river as rapidly almost as the expresses could ride, who were dispatched to us from time to time, to notify their progress. at 5. P.M. on Thursday we learnt that they had then been three hours landed at Westover. the whole militia of the adjacent counties were now called for, and to come on individually, without waiting any regular array. at 1.P.M. the next day (Friday) they entered Richmond, and on Saturday , after 24. hours possession, burning some houses, destroying property Etc. they retreated, encamped that evening 10. miles below, and reached their shipping at Westover the next day (Sunday).By this time had assembled 300. militia, under Colo Nicholas, 6. miles above Westover, and 200. under Genl Nelson, at Charles city Court house, 8. miles below. 2. or 300. at Petersburg had put themselves under Genl Smallwood of Mary land,  accidentally  there on his passage thro the state; and Baron Steuben with 800. and Colo Gibson with 1000. were also on the Southside of James river, aiming to reach Hood’s before the enemy should have passed it, where they hoped they could arrest him. but the wind having shifted, carried them down as prosperously, as it had brought them up the river. within the first 5 days therefore about 2500. men had collected at 3. or 4. different points, ready for junction. I was absent myself from Richmond (but always within observing distance  of the enemy) 3. days only, during which I was never off my horse, but to take food or rest; and was every where, where my presence could be  of any service; and I may with confidence challenge any one to put his finger on the point of time when I was in a state of remissness from any duty of my station. but, I was not with the army! true; for 1st where was it? 2. I was engaged in the more important function of taking measures to collect an army; and, without military education myself, instead of jeopardising the public safety, by pretending to take it’s command, of which I knew nothing. I had committed that to persons of the art, men who know how to make the best use of it, to Steuben for instance, to Nelson and others posessing  that military skill and experience, of which I had none.Let our condition too at that time be duly considered. without arms, without money of effect, without a regular souldier in the state, or a regular officer. except Steuben, militia scattered over the  country, and called at a moment’s warning to leave their families and firesides in the dead of winter, to meet an enemy ready marshalled, and prepared at all points to recieve them. yet had time been given them by the hasty retreat of that enemy. I have no doubt but the rush to arms, and to the protection of their country, would have been as rapid and universal, as in the invasion during our late war, when, at the first moment of notice, our citizens rose in mass , from every part of the state and without waiting to be marshalled by their officers,  armed themselves, and marched off by ones and by twos, as  quickly as they could equip themselves. of the individuals of the same house, one would start in the morning, a second at noon, a third in the evening, no one waiting an hour for the company of another. this I saw myself on the late occasion, and should have seen on the former, had wind, and tide, and a Howe, instead of an Arnold, slackened their place ever so little.And is the surprise of an  open and unarmed place, altho’ called a city, and even a capital, so unprecedented, as to be a matter of indelible reproach? which of our own capitals, during the same war, was not in possession of the same enemy, not merely by surprise, and for a day only, but permanently? that of Georgia? of S. Carolina? N. Carolina? Pensylvania? New York? Connecticut? Rhode island? Massachusets?—and if others were not, it was because the enemy saw no object in taking possession of them. add to the list in the late war Washington , the Metropolis of the Union, covered by a fort, with troops and a dense population. and what capital on the Continent of Europe (St Petersburg and it’s regions of ice excepted) did not Bonaparte take and hold at his pleasure? is it then just that Richmond , and it’s authorities alone should be placed under the reproach of history, because, in a moment of peculiar denudation of resources, by the coup de main of an enemy, led on by the hand of fortune,  directing the winds and weather to their wishes, it was surprised and held for 24. hours? or  strange that that enemy, with such advantages, should be enabled then to set off, without risking the honor it had atchieved by burnings and destructions of property peculiar to  his principles of warfare? we,  at least, may leave these glories, to their own trumpet.During this crisis of trial, I was left alone, unassisted by the cooperation of a single public functionary. for, with the legislature, every member of the council had departed to take care of his own family. unaided even in my bodily labors. but by my horse,  and he, exhausted at length by fatigue, sunk under me in the public road, where I had to leave him, and with my saddle and bridle on my shoulders, to  walk afoot to the nearest farm, where I borrowed an unbroken colt, and proceeded to Manchester, opposite to Richmond, which the enemy had evacuated a few hours before.Without further pursuing these minute details, I will here ask the favor of you to turn to Girardin’s history of Virginia, where such of them as are worthy the notice of history, are  related in that scale of extension which it’s objects admit. that work was written at Milton, within 2. or 3. miles of Monticello; and at the request of the author, I communicated to him every paper I possessed on the subject, of which he made the use he thought proper for his work. [see his pages 453–460. and the Appendix XI–XV.] I can assure you of the truth of every fact he has drawn from these papers, and of the genuineness of such as he has taken the trouble of copying. it happened that during those 8. days of incessant labor, for the benefit of my own memory, I carefully noted every circumstance worth it. these memorandums were often written on horse back, and on scraps of paper taken out of my pocket at the moment, fortunately preserved to this day, and now lying before me. I wish you could see them. but my papers of that period are stitched together in large masses, and so tattered &amp; tender as not to admit removal further than from their shelves to a reading table.  they bear an internal evidence of  fidelity which must carry conviction to every one who sees them. we have nothing in our neighborhood which could compensate the trouble of a visit to it, unless perhaps our University, which I believe you have not seen, and I can assure you is worth seeing. should you think so, I would ask as much of your time at Monticello as would enable you to examine these papers at your ease. many others too are interspersed among them which have relation to your object; many letters from Generals Gates, Greene, Stephens and others engaged in the Southern war, and in the North also. all should be laid open to you without reserve, for there is not a truth existing which I fear, or would wish unknown to the whole world. during the invasions of Arnold, Phillips and Cornwallis, until my time of office expired, I made it a point, once a week, by letters to the President of Congress, and to Genl Washington to give them an exact narrative of the transactions of the week. These letters should still be in the office of state in Washington, and in the presses at Mount Vernon. or, if the former were destroyed by the conflagrations of the British, the latter are surely safe, and may be appealed to in corroboration of what I have now written.There is another transaction, very erroneously stated in the same work, which altho’ not concerning myself, is within my own knolege, and I think it a duty to communicate it to you. I am sorry that, not being in possession of a copy of the Memoirs, I am not able to quote the page, and still less  the facts themselves,  verbatim from the text. but of the substance, as recollected, I am certain. it is said there that, about the time of Tarleton’s expedition up the North branch of James river to Charlottesville and Monticello, Simcoe was detached up the Southern branch, and penetrated as far as New London, in Bedford, where he destroyed a depot of arms Etc. Etc. I was, with my family, at the time, at a possession I have within 3. miles of new London, and I can assure you of my own knolege, that he did not advance to within 50. miles of New London. having reached the lower end of Buckingham, as I have understood, he heard of a deposit of arms, and a party of new recruits under Baron Steuben, some where in Prince Edward, he left the Buckingham road immediately, at or near Francisco’s, pushed directly South at this new object, was disappointed, and returned to and down James river, to head quarters. I had then returned to Monticello myself, and from thence saw the smokes of his conflagrations of houses and property, on that river, as they successively arose in the horison at a distance of 28 or 30. miles.  I must repeat that his excursion from Francisco’s is not within my own knolege, but as I have heard it from the inhabitants on the Buckingham road. which for many years I travelled 6. or 8. times a year. the particulars of that therefore may need enquiry and correction.These are all the recollections, within the scope of your request, which I can state with precision and certainty; and of these you are free to make what use you think proper, in the new edition of your father’s work; and with them I pray you to accept assurances of my great esteem and respect.Th: Jefferso

Monticselo, May 15, 1826.  
Dear Sir: The sentiment* of justice which have  
dictated your letters of the 3d and 9th inst. are  
worthy of all praise, and merit and meet my thank­  
ful acknowledgements. Were your father now  
living, ami proposing, as you are, to publish a se­  
cond edition of his memoirs, I am satisfied, he  
would give a very different aspect to the pages’ of  
that work, which respect Arnold s invasion and  
surprise of Richmond, in the winter ef 1730—81.  
He was then, I believe in South Carolina, too dis­  
tant from the scene of these transactions, to relate  
them on his own knowledge, or even to sift them  
from the chaff of rumors then afloat; rumors  
which vanished soon before the real truth, as va­  
pours before the sun, obliterated, by their notoriety  
from every candid mind, and by the voice of the  
many, who, as actors or spectators, knew what  
had truly passed. The fact* shall speak for them­  
selves.  
General Washington had just giver notice to  
all the Governors on the sea-board, North and  
South, that an embarkation was taking place at  
New Y.-rk, destined for the Southward, as was  
&#x27;ivrn out there, and on Sunday, the 31st of Dec.  
1780, we received information that a fleet had en­  
Icred our Capes; it happened, foitunately, that our  
egislature was at that moment in sessmn, and within  
2 days of their rising. So that during these two  
lays, we had the benefit of their presence, and of  
he counsel and information of the members jndi  
ridually. On Monday, the 1st of Januar Lve were  
n suspense, as to the destination of&#x27;  
vhether up the bay or up our river. ?*.*  
it 10 o’clock, however, we receive  
hat they had entered the James i* to*  
;eneral advice, we instantly prepari0*’  
ailing in the militia, one half from&#x27;,  
ouniies, and a fourth from the more remi  
voubl commute a force of between  
ivc thousand men; of which cfders  
  
rnemlers of the Legislature, which adjourned ’  
that day, took charge, each to h:, lc,rec­  
t.ve county and we beg,,, ,he ltmova, ot every  
thing f.om Richmond. The wind being fair an.l  
strung, the enemy a-cended the ,iver a. rapidly as  
the expresses could nde, who were di-patched to  
us horn tune to time to notify their progress. At  
P. M. on I hursday, we learnt that they had then  
*«. thre* h°uf,‘ Jat Westover. The whole  
.Militia of Ihe adjacent counties were now called  
lor. and to come on, indiv idually, without waiting  
any regular array. At 1 P. M. lhe ne*t day,  
(friday,) they entered Richmond, and on Saturday,  
alter 24 hours possesion, burning some house&#x27;s,  
destroying property, &amp;c. they retreated, encamped  
that evening 10 miles below, and reached their  
shipping, at \\ estover, the next day, (Sunday.)  
By this time had assembled three hundred Mi­  
litia under Col. Nicholas. 6 miles above Westover,  
and two hundred under General Nelson, at Charles  
city Courthouse, 8 miles below; two or three hun­  
dred at I etersburg. had put themselves under Gen.  
Smallwood, of Maryland, accidentally there on  
his passage through the State; and Baron Steuben  
with eight hundred, and Col. Gibson with one  
thousand, were also on the South side of James  
river, aiming to reach Hood’s befo.e the enemy  
should have passed it; where they hoped they  
could arrest them. But the wind having  
s i.ted, carried them down as prosperously as  
it had biought them up the river. Within the  
lust live days, therefore, about 2500 men had  
collected at three or four different points ready for  
junction.  
  
I was a!) ent myself from Richmond, but always  
within observing distance of the enemy, three days  
only; during which I was never off my horse but  
lo ta.ve food or rest; and was every where, where  
my presence could he of any service; and I may  
with confidence challenge any one to put his finger  
on the point of time when I was in a state of re­  
missues* from any duty of n.y station_Rut, I  
was not witli ihe army!—True, for 1st where was  
it. 2d. I was engaged in the more important  
iunctionsof taking measures to collect an army; and  
without military education myself, instead of jeo­  
pardising the public safety by pretending to take  
its command, of which 1 knew nothing, I had com­  
mitted that to persons of the art, men who knew  
how to make the best use of it; to Steuben, for  
instance, to Nelson and others, possessing that  
military -kill and experience of which I had none.  
.Let our condition too, at that lime be duly con­  
sidered; without arms, without money of effect  
without a regular soldier in the state, or a regular  
oflu-er except Steuben, a militia scattered over the  
country and called at a moment’s warning to leave  
their families and friends, in the dead of whiter* to  
meet an enemy re:.dy marshalled and prepared at  
all points to receive them! Yet had time been given  
them by the tardy retreat of that enemy, I have  
no doubt but the rush to arms, and to the protec­  
tion of their country, would have been as rapid  
and universal a* in their invasion during our late  
war; when at the first moment of notice our citi­  
zens rose in mass, from every part of the State, and  
without wailing to be marshalled by their officers  
and themselves, and inarched off, by ones and by  
twos, as quickly as they could equip themselves.  
Of the individuals of the same house, one would  
*tart in the morning, a second at noon, a third in  
the evening; no one w aiting an hour for the com­  
pany of another. This I saw myself on the late  
occasion, and should have seen on the former  
had wind and tide, and a Howe, instead of an  
Arnold, slackened their pace evei so little.  
And is the surprise of an open &amp; unarmed place  
although called a City and even a Capital, so un­  
precedented as to be matter of indelible reproach?  
Which of our Capitals during the same war, was  
not in possession of the same enemy, not merely  
by surprise and for a day only, but permanently?  
That of Georgia? of South Carolina? North  
Carolina? Pennsylvania? New York? Connec­  
txcuv ? Rhode Island? Massachusetts? And,  
if others were not, it was because the ene­  
my saw no object in taking possession of them_  
adJ to the list in the late war, Washington also,  
the me lopolis of the Union, covered by a fort,  
with troops and a dense population; and, what »  
capital on the continent of Europe [St. Petera­  
burgh and its regions of ice excepted] did not Bn­  
napaite take and hold at his pleasure ? Is it then  
just that Richmond and its authorities alone should  
be p.aced under the reproach of history, because,  
in a moment of peculiar denudation of resources,’  
i&gt;y ihe coup de main of an enemy, led on by the  
hand of fortune, directing the winds and weather  
to their wi-hes, it was surprised and held for 21  
hours ? Or, strange that that enemy, with such  
advantages, should be enabled then to get off with­  
out risking the honors he had atchieved by burn­  
ings and destructions of property, peculiar to this  
principle of warfare? We at least may leave  
these glories to their own trumpet.  
During this crisis of trial I was left alone, un­  
assisted by the co-operation of a single public  
functionary ; for, with the legislature, every mem­  
ber of the council had departed, to take care of  
jus own family, unaided even in my bodily labours,  
but by my horse, and he exhausted at length by  
fatigue, sunk under me in the public road, where I  
had to leave him, and with my saddle and bridle on  
my shoulders, to walk a foot to the nearest farm,  
where I borrowed an unbroken colt and proceed­  
ed to Manchester, oppo-ite Richmond, which the  
enemy had evacuated a few hours before.  
Without pursuing these minute details I wi |  
her. ask the favour of you to turn to Guardin&#x27;*  
History of \ ngtnta, where such of them as ar~  
worthy the notice of history are related in that  
scale of extension, which its objects admit. That  
work was written at Milton, within 2or 3 miles of  
Montteello ; and at the request of the author I  
com mum cated to him every paper I possessed on  
the subject, of which he made the use he thought  
proper for h.s work, (see his pages 453, 4S0, and  
the Appendix XI.—XV.) I can assure you of the  
truth of every fact he has drawn from these paper*  
and of the genuineness of such as he has taken the  
rouble of copying It happened that during these  
days of incessant labour, for the benefit of my  
own memory I carefully noted every circumstance  
worth it. 1 bese memorandums were often wri&#x27;­  
len on horseback and on scraps of paper taken out  
ol my pocket at the moment, fortunately pre­  
served to this day, and now lying before me l  
Wish you could see them. Rut n.y papers of that

I hey bear an internal evidence of fidelity which

We have nothing ,n our neighborhood which could  
compensate the trouble of a visit to it, unless per­

should you think m, I would ask as much of your  
time at Montteello, as would enable you to exam­

.re interspersed among them,which have relation to  
rour object, many letters from Gena. Gates Green  
Stephens, and others engaged ,n the Southern war’  
md in the North also. All should be la,&lt;1 open to

thy ot all praise, and merit and meet my thankful  
acknowledgments. Were your father now living,

different aspect to the pages of that work, which  
respect Arnold&#x27;s invasion and surprise ot Rich  
monil, in the winter ol 1780—-81. He was then, 1  
believe, in South Carolina, too distant from the  
scene ol these t ansactions, to relate them on his  
own know, tilge, or even to sift them from the chaff  
f tuntots then afloat; rumors, which vanished

which adjourned that day, took chsrge, each to his  
respective county, and we began the removal of ev ;

the expresses could rule, who we. e despatched to us  
f,ora »&quot;&gt;&#x27; ,0,,rne tû no,l| y progress. At 5 P.  
M. on 1 hu-sday, we learnt that they had then been

m&#x27; 1 * 8 bfdow - and &quot;«Jr dipping, at Wcsto­  
ver &#x27; *hc next da y&gt; (Sunday )  
By this time had assembled three hundred Militia  
under Col. Nicholas. 6 miles above Westover, and  
two hundred under General Nelson, at Charles city  
Court house, 8 miles below ; two or three hundred  
at Petersburg, had put themselves under General  
Smallwood, of Maryland, accidentally there on his  
passage through the State ; and Baron Steuben with  
eight hundred, and Col Gibson with one thousand,  
were also on the South side ot James river, aiming  
to reach Hood&#x27;s before the enemy should have pass  
ed it ; where they hoped they could arrest them—  
But the wind having shifted, carried them down as  
prosperously as it had brought them up the river,  
Within the first five days, therefore, about 2500  
men had collected at three or four different points  
ready for junction.  
1 was absent inyself from Richmond, but always  
within observing distance of the enemy, three days  
only ; during which I was never off my hor.e but  
to take food or rest ; and was every where, where  
my presence could be of any service; and I may  
with confidence challenge any one to put his finger  
on the point of time when 1 was in a state of re  
missness from any duty of my station—But, I was  
j not with the army !—True, for lst.where was it ?  
; 2d. I was engaged in the more important functions  
! of taking measures to collect an army ; and without  
j military education myself, instead ol jeopardising  
the public safety by pretending to take its com -,  
mand, of which I knew nothing I had committed  
j that to persons ot the art, men who knew how to  
make the best use of it ; to Steuben, lor instance, to  
■ Nelson and othcis, possessing that military skill am)  
experience of which 1 had none.  
Let our condition loo, at that time be duly con­  
sidered; without arms, without money of effect,  
without a regu&#x27;ar soldier in the state, or a tegular  
officer except Steuben, a militia scattered over the  
country and called at a moment&#x27;s warning to leave  
  
their families and friends, in the dead of winter ; to  
meet an enemy ready marshalled and prepared at  
all points to receive them ! Yet had time been given  
them by the tardy retreat of that enemy, I have  
no doubt but the rush to arms, and to the protection  
of their country, would have been as rapid and uni­  
versai as in their invasion during our late war ; when  
at the first moment of notice our citizens rose in  
mass, from every part of the State, and without  
waiting to be marshalled by their officers and them­  
selves and marched off, by ones and by twos, as  
quickly as they could equip themselves. Of tf...  
individuals of the same house, one would start in  
the morning, a second at noan, a third in the even­  
ing ; no one waiting an hour fqr the company of  
another. This I saw myself on the late occasion,  
and should have seen on the former, had wind and  
tide, and a Howe, instead of an Arnold, slackened  
their pace ever so little.  
And is the surprise of an open and unarmed  
place, although called a City and even a Capital, so  
unprecedented as to be matter of indelible reproach ?  
Which of our Capitals duting the same war, was  
not in possession of the same enemy, not merely by  
surprise and for a day only, but permanently ? That  
of Georgia? of South Carolina? North Carolina?  
Pennsylvania? New Yotk? Connecticut? Rhode  
Island? Massachusetts? And, if others were not,  
it was because the enemy saw no object in taking  
possession of them—add to the list in the late war,  
Washington also, the metropolis of the Union, cov­  
ered by a fmt, with troops and a dense population ;  
and, what capital on the comment ol Europe, [St.  
Petersburg!! and its regions ol ice exceptedj did not  
Bonaparte take and hold at his pleasure ? Is it then  
just that Richmond and its authorities alone should  
jbe placed under the teproach of history, because,  
in a moment of peculiar denudation of resources,  
by the coup de main of an enemy, led on by the  
hand of fortune, diieciing the winds and weather to  
their wishes, it was surprisrd and held lor 24 hours ?  
Or, strange that that enemy, with such advantages,  
should be enabled then to get off without risking the  
honors lie had achieved by burnings and destruc  
tions of property, peculiar to this prim iple of wa -  
fare? We at least may leave these glories to their  
own trumpet.  
During this crisis of trial I was left alone, unas  
sis&#x27;.ed by the co operation of a »ingle puhlic func­  
tiona.-y : for, with the legislature, ev. iy member of  
the council had departed, to take care of his own  
tan.tly, unaided even in my bodily labours, but by  
my horse, and he exhausted at length by fatigue,  
sunk under me in the public road, where I had to  
leave him, and with my saddle and bridle on my  
shoulders, to walk a foot to the nearest farm, where  
I bm rowed an unbroken colt and proceeded to Mat:,  
ehester, opposite Richmond, which the enemy had  
evacuated a few hours before.  
tng  
whole world. ^ .  
Phillips, and Cornwallis, until my time ot office  
expired, I made it a point, or.ee a week, by .ct­  
ters to the President ol Congress am, to General  
Washington, to give them an exact narrative of  
the transaction, of the week. 4 hese letters stiouid

in the presses at Mount \ ernon. Or, it tl.c tor­  
mer were destroyed by the conflagrations ol toe  
British, the latter are surely safe aud may be sp­  
pealed to in corroboration of what 1 have now  
written.

Virginia, where such of them as ate worthy the no­

he made the use he thought proper lor his work,

he has drawn ftom these papers and of the genu­

carefully noted every circumstance worth it. These  
memorandums were often written on horseba&lt; k and  
on scraps ot paper taken out of my pocket ot the

papers of that period are slitched together in large  
masses, end so tattered and tender, as not to admit  
removal further than from their shelves to a reading

which must carry conviction to every one who 6ees

Moxvtickry o, May 15, 1826.  
Dear Sir: The sentiments of jestice  
which dictated your letters of the 3d and  
Bth inst. are worthy of all praise, and ter­  
it and gneet my thankful acknowlédge­  
meats. ~Were your father now living, and  
proposing, as you are, to publish a second  
edition of his merpoirs, f&#x27; am satistied he  
would give a very different aspect to the  
pages of&#x27; that wark, which respects Ar­  
nold&#x27;s invasion and surprise of Richmond,  
in the winter of 1780-81. He was th: , [  
believe in South Carolina, too distant from  
the scene of these transactions,®o relate  
thom on his own knowledge, or eveh to  
shitt them from the chafl’ of rumors ther  
afloat ; rumors which vanished soon he&#x27;fore  
the real truth, as vapors before the un,  
obliterated, by their notoriety, from every  
candid mind, and by the voice of the iny  
who, as-actors or spectators, knew Wlat  
had truly passed. The facts shull spoak  
for themselves,  
  
‘ General Washington had just giveh no­  
tice to all the Governors on the sea-bovrd,  
North and South, that an embarkation was  
|taking place at New-York, destined for  
the Southward, as was given ow there, and  
on Sunday, the 31st ofpl)dc. 1780, we re­  
ceived information thata Meet had enterod  
our capes ; it happened, fortunately. &#x27;hat  
our legislature was at that moment ih sese  
®ion, and withun two days of their ring.  
So that dnring&#x27; these two days, we hat the  
benefit of their presence, and of the ¢oun­  
cil and informwation of the members, indi­  
vidually. On Monday the llst of Junuary,  
‘wo were in suspense, a 5 to the destintition  
of this fleet, whether up the bay or up our  
river. On Toesday, at 10 o’clock, howey­  
or, we received information that they had  
entered the James River ; and on ;‘:e,-m‘ml  
advice, we instantly prepared orders (or  
calling in the militis, one W from the  
nearer countrivs, and a fourth fiom &#x27;he  
more remote, which would constititea  
forcé of between four and five thousund  
men of which orders the members of Ihe  
Legislature, which adjourned that ‘day,  
t(m&#x27;li charge, eacle to hisrespective comty,  
and we began the removal of every thin  
from Richmond. &#x27;The wind being xir hnﬁ.  
strong, the enemy ascended the river as  
rnpid{‘y as the expresses could ride, who  
were dispatched to us trom time 16 tiwe (o  
notify their progre s,  
- AtS P, I\‘ on Thursday, we learnt that  
they had then been throe hours landed at  
Westover. The whole Militia of thé ad-  
Jacent counties were now called for, and  
to.come on, individually, without waiting  
any reguolar array. At i P, M. thé next  
day, (Friday) they entered Richmond and  
on Suturday, after 24 hours posscesion,  
burning some houses, destroying property,  
&amp;e. they rétreated, entamped that byen­  
ing 10 miles below, and reached theiy  
:’hmping at Westover, the next day, (Sun­  
ay.)  
i&#x27;ldy this time had assembled three hun.-  
dred Militia under Col, Nicholas, 6 tilea  
above Westover, and two hundred under  
General Nelson, at Charles City Court­  
house B miles below ; two or tiree hun­  
dred at Petersburg, had put themselves  
under Gen, Smallwood, of Khrylnnd, acci­  
dentally there on his passage throngh the  
State 5 and Baron Steuben with eight hun­  
dred, and Col, Gibson with ong 5)0!1.&#x27;!!1&quot;&quot;  
were also on the South side of James’ ri­  
ver, uiming to reach Hood’s before the en­  
emy should have passed it where they  
hoped they could arrest them. But the  
wind havinF shifted carried them down s  
prosperously as it had brought them wp the  
river, \Vit{in the first five days tharefore,  
about 2500 men had collccudy “at three or  
four different points ready for junction.  
I was absent myself from Richmond, but  
always within observing distance of the en­  
emy, three days only ; during which [ was  
never ofl my horse but to take food or rest,  
and was every where, where mrv presence  
could be of any service; and [ may with  
confidence challenge any nue to put his  
finger on the poim. of tis when 1 was in  
a state of remissness from any duty &amp;f my  
station.—But | was ne¢ with the army !

may leave these glories to their own trum­

During this crisis of trin]l T was left  
alone, unassisted by the co-operation of a  
single public functionary ; for, with the  
legislature every member of the council  
had departed, to take care of his own fami­  
ly, unaided even in my bodily labors, but  
by iny horse, and he exhausted at length  
by fatigue, sunk under me in the public

my saddle and bridle on my shoulders,  
walk a foot to the nearest farm, where 1  
borrowed an unbroken colt &amp; proceeded to  
Manchester, opposite Richmond, which  
the enemy had evacuated a fow hours be­  
fore,  
  
Without pursuing these minute details,  
T will ask the Favor of you to turn to Girar­  
din’s History of Virginia, where such of  
them as are worthy the notice of&#x27; history  
are related in that scale of extension,  
which its objects adwmit. That work was  
written at Milton, within 2 or 3 miles of  
Monticello, and at the reauest of the an­  
thor I communicated to him every paper |  
possessed on the subject, of which he  
made the use he thought proper for his  
work, (sce his pages 453, 460, and the ap  
pondix .\&#x27;l.--.‘fv.) I can assure you of  
the truth of every fact he has drawn fron  
thease D.‘lrt‘l‘d and of the gennineness of  
auch as he has taken the trouble of fopy­  
ing, It happened that during these ¥  
Jdays of incessant labor, for the henefit of  
my own memory, I carctolly noted every  
circnmstance worth it  
These memorandoms were often writ- |  
ten on horseback, and on scraps ol paper  
taken out of my pocket at the moment tor­  
tunately preserved to this day und now  
lving Lefore mo. T wish you could see  
them, But my papers of that period are

tatterad and tender, ns not to admit remo­  
val further than from their shelves to a  
reading table.~-They bear an internal evi­  
dence of fidelity which must earry convic­  
tion to every one who sees them.--We  
have nothing in our neighborhood which  
could compensate the trouble of a visit to  
it, unless perhaps our University, which  
[ believe you have not seen, and { can as­  
sure you, is worth” seeing. Should you  
think so, [ would ask as much of your time  
at Monticello, as would enable you to ex­  
nmine these papers at your ease. Many  
others too, are interspersed among them,  
which have relation to your object, many  
Jotters from Gens. Gates, Green, Stephens,  
nnd others engaged in the Southern war,  
and in the North also. All should be laid  
open to you without reserve ; for there s  
not a truth existing which 1 fear, or would  
wish unknewn to the world. During the  
mvasions of Arnold, Philips, and (Eoru­  
wallis, until my time of oEzc expired, 1  
made it a point, once a week, by letters to  
the President of Congress and to Genoral  
Washington, to give them an exact narra­  
tive of the transactions of the week.—  
These letters should still be in the office  
of State in Washington, and in the pres- !  
res at Yount Vernon. Or, if the former  
were destroyed by the conflagrations ot&quot;  
the British, t{w latter are surely safe and ‘  
may be appealed to in corroboration of  
what 1 have now written, |  
  
There 1s another transaction very or- |  
roneously stated in the same work, wﬁich.,  
although not mncening myselt; 1s within  
my own knowledge, and 1 think it a duty  
to conmmunicate it to you. I am sorry  
that, not being in possession of a copy of  
the Memoirs, T am not able to quote the  
passage, and still less the fucts themselves,  
verbatim from the text; but of the sub­  
stance as recollected, lam certain. It is  
said there that about the time of Tarle­  
ton&#x27;s expedition up the North branch of  
Yames River to Charlottesville and Mon­  
ticello, Simcoe was detached up the South­  
crn branch, and Penctrnmd o= far as New-  
Londom, in Bedford, where he destroyed  
a dopot of arms, &amp;e. &amp;e. 1 was with my  
famly at the time, at a possession | have  
within three miles of New-London, and 1  
can assure you of my knowledge that Le  
did advance to within ﬁﬂly miles of New-  
London, Having reached the lower end  
of Buckingham, as 1 have understood, he  
heard of a depot of arms and a party of  
new recruits under Baron Steaben, sewe­  
where in Prince Edward, He left the  
Buckinbam road, inunediately, at or near  
Francisco&#x27;s, pushed directly south at this  
ne s object, was disappeinted and returned  
to and down James River to head quar­  
ters. 1 had then returned to Monticello  
myself, and from thence saw the smokes  
of his conflagration, of houses and proper  
ty on that river, as they successively arose  
inthe horizon at a ‘stance of 25 or 30  
mi s, | must repeat that this exeursion  
froon Francisco&#x27;s is not within my know &#x27; |  
el o hutas | have heard it trom the inhab  
tants on !he_ﬂm&#x27;kmgham road, which ]  
  
many years | travelied G or 8 ti&#x27;wné&quot;;i:cu,  
  
Tlhe particulars of that therefore may need  
enquiry and correction, *  
These are all the recollections within  
the scope of your request, which I ecan  
state with precision and certainty, and of  
these you are free to make what use you  
think proper in the new edition of your  
father&#x27;s work, and with them I pray vou  
to aceept assurances of my great esteem  
and respect, TII. JLF%‘ERSON.

MontTicet.o, May 15, 1826,  
  
Dear Sir: The sentiments of justice which havo  
dictated your letters of the 3d and 9th inst. are wor.  
thy of all praise, and merit and meet my thankfu!  
acknowledgments. Were your father now living,  
and proposing, as you are, to publish a second edi-  
tion of his memoirs, fam satisfied, he would give a  
very different aspect to the pages of that work,  
which respect Arnold’s invasion and surprise of  
Richmond, in the winter of 1780—81. He was  
then, I believe, in South Carolina, too distant from  
the scene of these transactions, to relate them on his  
own knowledge, or even to sift them from the chaff  
of rumors then afloat; rumors, ‘which vanished as  
soon beforo the real truth, as vapours before the sun,  
obliterated by their notoriety, by every candid mind,  
and by the voice of the many, who, as actors or spec-  
tators, knew what had nearly passed. The facts  
shall speak for themselves. Daeg 4  
  
General Washington had just given notice to all  
the governors on the sea-board, north and south, that  
an embarkation was taking place at New York, des-  
tined for the southward, as was given out there, and  
on Sunday, the 3lst of Dec. 1780, we received infor-  
mation that a fleet had entered our capes; it happen-  
ed, fortunately, that our legislature was at that mo-  
ment in session, and within 2.daysoftheir rising. So  
that, during these two days, we had the benefit of  
their presence, and of the counsel and informatiog of  
the members; individually.&#x27;:.On Monday, .the--Ist  
January, we&#x27;were in suspense, as to the destipation  
of this fleet, whether up the bay or up our river.  
On Tuesday, at 10 o’clock, however, we received in-  
formation that they had entered the James river; and  
on general advice, we instantly prepared orders for  
calling in the: militia, one half from the nearer coun-  
ties, and a fourth from the more remote, which would  
constitute a force:of between four and five thousand  
men, of which orders the members of the legislature  
which adjourned that day, took charge, each to his  
respective county, and we began the removal ‘of  
every thing from Richmond. The wind being fair  
and strong, the enemy ascended the river as rapidly  
as the expresses could ride, who were despatched to  
us from time to time to notify their progress. At5  
P. M. on Thursday, we learnt that they had then been  
3 hours landed at Westover. The whole militia of  
the adjacent counties were now called for, and to  
come on, individually, without waiting any regular  
array. Ati P. M. the next day, (Friday), they en-  
tered Richmond, and on Saturday, afer 24 hours pos-  
  
  
  
session, burning some houses, destroying property.

&amp;c. they retreated, encamped that evening 10 miles  
below, and reached their shipping, at Westover, the  
next day, (Sunday), wa  
  
By this time had assembled three hundred militia  
under col. Nicholas, 6 miles above Westover, and two  
hundred under general Nelson, at Charles city court  
couse, 8 miles below; two or three hundred at Peters-  
purg had put themselves under general Smallwood,  
of Maryland, accidently there on his passage through  
the state, and Baron Steuben with eight hundred, and  
col. Gibson with one thousand, were also on the S.  
side of James river, aiming to reach Hood’s before  
the enemy should have passed it; where they hoped  
they could arrest them. But the wind having shifted,  
carried them down as prosperously as it had brought  
them up the river:—Withbin the first tive days, there-  
fore, about 2.500 men had collected at three or four  
gifferent points ready for junction.  
  
I was absent myself from Richmond, but always  
within observing distance of the enemy, three days  
only; during which I was never off my horse but to  
take food or rest; and was every where, where -  
presence could be of any service; and I may wit  
confidence challenge any one to put his finger on the  
point of time when I was in a state of remissness  
from any duty of my station.—But I was not with wie  
army!—True, for Ist, where was it? 2d. I was en-  
gaged in the more important functions of taking  
measures to collect an army; and without military  
education myself, instead of jeopardizing the public  
safety by pretending to take its command of which I  
kuew nothing, I had committed that to persons of the  
art;men who knew how to make the best use of it.  
To Steuben, for instance, to Nelson and others, pos-  
sessing that military skill and experience of which I  
had none.  
  
Let our condition too, at that time be duly consi-  
dered; without arms or money or effects, without a  
regular soldier in the state, or a regular officer ex-  
cept Steuben, a militia scattered over the country  
and called at a moment’s warning to leave their fa-  
milies and friends, in the dead of winter, to‘meet an  
enemy ready marshalled and prepared at all points  
ioreceive them! Yet had time been given them by  
the tardy retreat of that enemy, I have no doubt but  
the rush to arms, and to the protection of their coun-  
iry, would have been as rapid and universad as in their  
invasion during our late war; when at the first mo-  
ment of notice our citizens rose en masse, from every  
  
part of the state, and, without waiting to be marshal- |  
  
led by their officers and themselves, and marched off  
by ones and by twos, as quickly as they could equip  
themselves. Of the individuals of the same house,  
one would start in the morning, a second at noon,  
a third in the evening, no one waiting an hour for the  
company of another. This 1 saw myself on the late  
occasion, and should have seen on the former, had  
wind and tide, and a Howe, instead of an Arnold,  
slackened their pace ever so little.  
  
And isthe surprise, of an open and unarmed place,  
although called a city and even a capital, so unpre-  
cedented as to be matter of indelible reproach?  
Which of our capitals, during the same war, was not  
in possession of the same enemy, not merely by sur-  
prise and for a day only, but permanently? That of  
Georgia? of South Carolina? North Carolina? Penn-  
sylvania? New York? Connecticut? Massachusetts?  
And, if others were not, it was because the enemy  
saw no object in taking possession of them—add to  
the list in the late war, Washington also, the me-  
tropolis of the union, covered by a fort with troops  
and a dense population; and, what capital on the con-  
unent of Europe [St. Petersburg and its regions of  
ce excepted] did not Bonaparte take and bold at his  
pleasure? Is it then just that Richmond and its qu-  
thorities alone should be placed under the reproach  
of history, because, in a moment of peculiar denu-  
  
dation of resources, by the coup de main of an ene-  
my, led on by the hand of fortune, directing the winds  
and wheather to their wishes, it was surprised and  
held for 24 hours? Or, strange that that enemy, with  
such advantages, should be enabled then to gct off  
without risking the honors he had achieved by burn-  
ings and destructious of property, peculiar to this  
principle of warfare? We at least may leave these  
glories to their own trumpet.  
  
During this crisis of tria! I was left alone, unassist-  
ed by the ao-operation of a single public functionary3;  
for with the legisiature, every member of the eoun-  
cil had departed, to take care of his own family, un-  
aided even in my bodily labors, but by my horse,  
and he, exhausted at length by fatigue, sunk under  
me in the public road, where I bad to leave him, and  
with my saddle and bridle on my shoulders, to walk  
a foot to the nearest farm, where i borrowed an un-  
broken colt and proceeded to Manchester, opposite  
Richmond, which the enemy had evacuated a few  
hours before.  
  
Without pursuing these minute details, I will here  
ask a favor of you to turn to Girardin’s History of  
Virginia, where such of them as are worthy the no-  
tice of history are related in that scale of extension,  
which its objects admit. That work was written at  
Milton, within two or three miles of Monticello; and  
at the request of the author I communicated to him  
every paper I possessed on the subject, of which he  
made the use he thought proper for his work, (see his  
pages 453, 460, and the Appendix XI.—XV.) I can  
assure you of the truth of every fact he has drawn  
from these papers and of the genuineness of such as  
he has taken the trouble of copying. It happened  
that, during these 8 days of incessant labor, for the  
benefit of my own memory, I carefully noticed every  
circumstance worth it. These memorandums were  
often written on horseback, and on scraps of paper  
taken out of my pocket at the moment, fortunately  
preserved to this day, and now lying before me. [  
wish you could see them. But my papers of that pe-  
riod, are stitched together in large masses, and so  
tattered and tender, as not to admit removal further  
than from their shelves to a reading table. They  
bear an internal evidence of fidelity which must car-  
ry conviction toevery one whoseesthem. We have  
nothing in our neighborhood which could compen-  
sate the trouble of a visit to it, unless, perhaps, our  
  
  
  
—— _  
  
university, which I believe you bave not seen, and [  
can assure you is worth seeing. Should you think  
so, | would ask as much of your time at Monticello,  
as would enable you to examine these papers at your  
ease. Many others, too, are interspersed among  
them, which hare relation to your object, many Jet-  
ters from gens. Gates, Green, Stephens, and others  
engaged in the southern war, and in the north, also.  
All should be laid open to you without reserve; for  
there is not a truth existing which I fear, or would  
wish unknown to the whole world. During the in-  
vasions of Arnold, Phillips, and Cornwallis, until my  
time of office expired, I made it a point, once a week,  
hy letters to the president of congress, and to general  
Washington, to give them an exact narrative of tie  
transactions of the week. These letters should still  
be in the office of state, in Washington, and in the  
presses at Mount Vernon. Or, if the former were  
destrayed by the conflagrations of the British, the  
latter are surely safe, and may be appealed to in cor-  
roboration of what I have now written.  
  
There is another transaction very erroneously state  
ed in the same work, which, although not concerning  
myself, is within my own knowledge, and I think ita  
duty to communicate itto you. 1am sorry that, not  
being in possession of a copy of ihe memoirs, 1 an  
not able to quote the passage, and still less the facts  
themselves, verbatim from the text; but of the sub-

that about the time of Tarleton’s expedition up the  
nerth branch of James river to Chariottesville and  
Monticello, Simcoe was detached up the southern  
branch, and penetrated as far as New London, in  
Bedford, where he destroyed a depot of arms, &amp;e.  
&amp;e. I was with my family at the time ata possession  
J have within three miles of New London, and I can  
assure you of my knowiedge that he did not advance  
to withia fifty miles of New London. Having reach-  
ed the lower end of Buckingham, as I have under-  
stood, he heard of a depot of arms and a party of  
new recruits under baron Steuben, somewhere in  
Prince Edward. He left Buckingham road, immedi-  
ately at or near Francisco’s, pushed direetly south at  
this new object, was disappointed and returned to  
and down James’ river to head quarters. I had then  
returned to Monticello myself and from thence saw  
the smokes of his conflagration, of houses and pro-  
perty on that river, as they successively arose in the
