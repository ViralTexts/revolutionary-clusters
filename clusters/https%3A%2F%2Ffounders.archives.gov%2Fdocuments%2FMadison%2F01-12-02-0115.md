. I think the merit of the question is now to be decided, whether the gentleman is eligible to a seat in this house or not, but it will depend on the decision of a previous question, whether he has been seven years a citizen of the United-States or not.  
From an attention to the facts which have been adduced, and from a consideration of the principles established by the revolution, the conclusion I have drawn is, that Mr. Smith, was on the declaration of independence a citizen of the United-States, and unless it appears that he has forfeited his right, by some neglect or overt act, he had continued a citizen until the day of his election to a seat in this house. I take it to be a clear point, that we are to be guided in our decision, by the laws and constitution of South-Carolina, so far as they can

He supposes, when this country separated from Great Britain, the tie of allegiance subsisted between the inhabitants of America and the king of that nation, unless by some adventitious circumstance the allegiance was transferred to one of the United States. I think there is a distinction which will invalidate his doctrine in this particular, a distinction between that primary allegiance which we owe to that particular society of which we are members, and the secondary allegiance we owe to the sovereign established by that society.

pire, where birth has not endowed the person with that privilege, he must be naturalized by an act of parliament.  
What was the situation of the people of America when the dissolution of their allegiance took place by the declaration of independence? I conceive that every person who owed this primary allegiance to the particular community in which he was born retained his right of birth, as the member of a new community; that he was consequently absolved from the secondary allegiance he had owed to the British sovereign: If he was not a minor, he became bound by his own act as a member of the society who separated with him from a submission to a foreign country. If he was a minor, his consent was involved in the decision of that society to which he belonged by the ties of nature. What was the allegiance as a citizen of South-Carolina, he owed to the King of Great Britain? He owed his allegiance to him as a King of that society to which, as a society he owed his primary allegiance. When that society separated from Great Britain, he was bound by that act and his allegiance transferred to that society, or the sovereign which that society should set up, because it was through his membership of the society of South-Carolina, that he owed allegiance to Great Britain.  
This reasoning will hold good, unless it is supposed that the s

aggregate capacity ; nor did she by so doing, relin­  
quish any further her authority over her citizens.  
Primary allegiance is due from all her citizens to her  
alone ; that secondary allegiance which she has trans­  
ferred, is due the United States.  
This view of the doctrine of allegiance is fully  
sustained by Mr. Madison in his argument in the case  
of Ramsay vs. Smith in the House of Representatives  
in 1789 a contested election. Mr. Madison then said,  
&quot; it was an established maxim, that birth was a crite­  
rion of allegiance. There was a distinction between  
that primary allegiance we owe that particular society  
of which we are members, and the secondary allegi-  
I ance we owe to the sovereign established by that society.  
w nat was the situation ot the people ot America  
when the dissolution of their allegiance took place  
by the declaration of their independence? 1 con-  
j ceive that every person who owed this primary alle  
giance to the particular community in which he was  
born, retained his right of birth, as a member of a  
new community ; that he was consequently absolved  
from the secondary allegiance he owed to the British  
Sovereign. It he were not a minor, he became bound  
by his own act as a member of the society who se­  
parated with him from a submission to a foreign  
Country. When that society separated from Great  
Britain he was bound by that act, and his allegiance  
transferred to that society, or to the sovereign which  
that society should set up ; because it was through his  
membership of that society of South Carolina that  
he owed allegiance to Great Britain.
