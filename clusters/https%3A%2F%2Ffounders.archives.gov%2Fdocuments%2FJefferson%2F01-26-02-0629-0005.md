lphia August 16th: 1793.  
  
In my letter of June 13th. I enclosed to you the copies of several letters, which had passed between Mr. Ternant, Mr. Genet, and myself, on the occurrences to which the present war had given rise within our ports. The object of this communication was to enable you to explain the principles on which our government was conducting itself towards the belligerent parties; principles which might not in all cases be satisfactory to all, but were meant to be just and impartial to all. Mr. Genet had been then but a little time with us; and but a little more was necessary to develop in him a character and conduct, so unexpected, and so extraordinary, as to place us in the most distressing dilemma, between our regard for his nation, which is constant and sincere, and a regard for our Laws, the authority of which must be maintained; for the peace of our Country, which the Executive Magistrate is charged to preserve; for it’s honor, offended in the person of that Magistrate; and for it’s character grossly traduced in the conversations and letters of this Gentleman. In the course of these transactions, it has been a great comfort to us to believe that none of them were within the intentions or expectations of his employers. These had been too recently expressed, in acts which nothing could discolour, in the letters of the Executive Council, in the letter and decrees of the national Assembly, and in the general demeanor of the nation towards us, to ascribe to them things of so contrary a character. Our first duty, therefore, was to draw a strong line between their intentions, and the proceedings of their Minister; our second, to lay those proceedings faithfully before them.  
On the declaration of war between France and England, the United States being at peace with both, their situation was so new and unexperienced by themselves, that their citizens were not, in the first instant, sensible of the new duties resulting therefrom, and of the restraints it would impose even on their dispositions towards the belligerent powers. Some of them imagined (and chiefly their transient Sea-faring citizens) that they were free to indulge those dispositions, to take side with either party, and enrich themselves by depredations on the commerce of the other, and were meditating enterprises of this nature, as there was reason to believe. In this state of the public mind, and before it should take an erroneous direction, difficult to be set right, and dangerous to themselves and their country, the President thought it expedient, through the channel of a Proclamation, to remind our fellow-citizens that we were in a state of peace with all the belligerent powers, that in that state,  it was our duty neither to aid nor injure any, to exhort and warn them against acts which might contravene this duty, and particularly those of positive hostility, for the punishment of which the laws would be appealed to; and to put them on their guard also as to the risks they would run, if they should attempt to carry articles of contraband to any. This proclamation, ordered on the 19th. and signed the 22d. day of April, was sent to you in my letter of the 26th. of the same month.  
On the day of it’s publication, we received through the channel of the newspapers the first intimation that Mr. Genet had arrived on the 8th. of the month at Charleston in the Character of minister plenipotentiary from his nation to the united States, and soon after, that he had sent on to Philadelphia the vessel in which he came, and would himself perform the Journey by land. His landing at one of the most distant ports of the Union from his points both of departure and destination, was calculated to excite attention: and very soon afterwards we learnt that he was undertaking to authorize the fitting and arming vessels in that port, enlisting men, foreigners and citizens, and giving them Commissions to cruize and commit hostilities on nations at peace with us, that these vessels were taking and bringing prizes into our ports, that the consuls of France were assuming to hold Courts of Admiralty on them, to try, condemn, and authorize their sale as legal prize, and all this before Mr. Genet had presented himself, or his Credentials to the President, before he was received by him, without his consent or consultation, and directly in contravention of the state of peace existing, and declared to exist in the President’s proclamation, and incumbent on him to preserve till the constitutional authority should otherwise declare. These proceedings became immediately, as was naturally to be expected, the subject of complaint by the representative here of that power against whom they would chiefly operate. The British minister presented several memorials thereon, to which we gave the answer of May 15. heretofore enclosed to you, corresponding in substance with a letter of the same date written to Mr. Ternant, the minister of France then residing here, a copy of which I send herewith. On the next day Mr. Genet reached this place, about five or six weeks after he had arrived at Charleston, and might have been at Philadelphia, if he had steered for it directly. He was immediately presented to the President, and received by him as the minister of the Republic; and as the conduct before stated seemed to bespeak a design of forcing us into the war, without allowing us the exercise of any free will in the case, nothing could be more assuaging than his assurances to the President at his reception, which he repeated to me afterwards in conversation, and in public to the citizens of Philadelphia in answer to an address from them, that, on account of our remote situation and other circumstances, France did not expect that we  should become a party to the war, but wished to see us pursue our prosperity and happiness in peace. In a conversation a few days after, Mr. Gene

ered him my letter of May 15. He spoke something of the case of the Grange, and then of the armament at Charleston, explained the circumstances which led him to it before he had been received by the government, and consulted it’s will, expressed a hope that the President had not so absolutely decided against the measure, but that he would hear what was to be said in support of it; that he would write me a letter on the subject, in which he thought he could justify it under our Treaty; but that if the President should finally determine otherwise, he must submit: for that assuredly his instructions were to do what would be agreeable to us. He accordingly wrote the letter of May 27. The President took the case again into consideration, and found nothing in that letter which could shake the grounds of his former decision. M

most enlightened and approved writers on the subject, that a neutral nation must, in all things relating to the war, observe an exact impartiality towards the parties; that favors to one to the prejudice of the other would import a fraudulent neutrality, of which no nation would be the dupe; that no succour should be given to either, unless stipulated by Treaty, in men, arms, or any thing else directly serving for war;

that the right of raising troops being one of the rights of sovereignty, and consequently appertaining exclusively to the nation itself, no foreign power or person can levy men, within it’s territory, without it’s consent; and he who does, may be rightfully and severely punished; that if the United States have a right to refuse the permission to arm vessels and raise men within their ports and territories, they are bound by the laws of neutrality to exercise that right, and to prohibit such armaments and enlistments. To these principles of the law of Nations Mr. Genet answers by calling them ‘diplomatic subtleties,’ and ‘aphorisms of Vattel and others.’ But something more than this is necessary to disprove them:  and till they are disproved, we hold it certain that the law of Nations and the rules of neutrality forbid our permitting either party to arm in our ports.

subjects of the most christian King, nor Citizens of the said United States, who have Commissions from any prince or state in enmity with either nation, to fit their Ships in the ports of either the one or the other of the aforesaid parties.’ Translate this from the general terms in which it here stands into the special case produced by the present war. ‘Privateers not belonging to France or the United States and having Commissions from the enemies of one of them,’ are in the present state of things ‘British, Dutch and Spanish privateers.’ Substituting these then for the equivalent terms, it will stand thus. ‘It shall not be lawful for British, Dutch, or Spanish privateers to fit their ships in the ports of the United States.’ Is this an express permission to France to do it? Does the negative to the enemies of France, and silence as to France herself, imply an affirmative to France? Certainly not: it leaves the question, as to France open and free to be decided according to circumstances. And if the parties had meant an affirmative stipulation, they would have provided for it expressly; they would never have left so important a point to be inferred from mere silence, or implication. Suppose they had desired to stipulate a refusal to their enemies, but nothing as to themselves: what form of expression would they have used? Certainly the one they have used: an express stipulation as to their enemies, and silence as to themselves. And such an intention corresponds not only with the words, but with the circumstances of the times. It was of value to each party to exclude it’s enemies from arming in the ports of the other, and could in no case embarrass them. They therefore stipulated so far mutually. But each might be embarrassed by permitting the other to arm in it’s ports. They therefore would not stipulate to permit that. Let us go back to the state of things in France when this treaty was made, and we shall find several cases wherein France could not have permitted us to arm in her ports. Suppose a war between these States and Spain. We know that, by the Treaties between France and Spain, the former could not permit the enemies of the latter to arm in her ports. It was honest in her, therefore, not to deceive us by such a stipulation. Suppose a war between these States and Great Britain. By the treaties between France and Great Britain, in force at the signature of ours, we could not have been permitted to arm in the ports of France. She could not then have meant in this article to  give us such a right. She has manifested the same sense of it again in her subsequent Treaty with England, made eight Years after the date of ours, stipulating in the 16th. article of it, as in our 22d. that foreign privateers, not being subjects of either crown should not arm against either, in the ports of the other. If this had amounted to an affirmative stipulation that the subjects of the other crown might arm in her ports against us, it would have been in direct contradiction to her 22d. Article with us. So that to give to these negative stipulations, an affirmative effect, is to render them inconsistent with each other, and with good faith: to give them only their negative and natural effect, is to reconcile them to one another, and to good faith, and is clearly to adopt the sense in which France herself has expounded them. We may justly conclude then, that the article only obliges us to refuse this right, in the present case, to Great Britain, and the other enemies of France. It does not go on to give it to France, either expressly, or by implication. We may then refuse it. And since we are bound by treaty to refuse it to the one party, and are free to refuse it to the other, we are bound by the laws of neutrality to refuse it to that other. The aiding either party then with vessels, arms, or men, being unlawful by the Law of nations, and not rendered lawful by the treaty, it is made a question whether our citizens, joining in these unlawful enterprises may be punished? The united States being in a state of peace with most of the belligerent powers by treaty, and with all of them by the laws of nature, murders and robberies committed by our citizens within our territory, or on the high seas, on those with whom we are so at peace, are punishable, equally as if committed on our own inhabitants. If I might venture to reason a little formally, without being charged with running into ‘subtleties and aphorisms,’ I would say that if one citizen has a right to go to war of his own Authority, every citizen has the same. If every citizen has that right, then the nation (which is composed of all it’s Citizens) has a right to go to war, by the authority of it’s individual Citizens. But this is not true, either on the general principles of Society, or by our Constitution, which gives that power to Congress alone, and not to the Citizens individually. Then the first position was not true; and no citizen has a right to go to war of his own authority: and for what he does without right, he ought to be punished.—Indeed nothing can be more obviously absurd than to say that all the citizens may be at war, and yet the nation at peace. It has been pretended, indeed, that the engagement of a citizen in an enterprise of this nature, was a divestment of the character of citizen, and a transfer of jurisdiction over him to another Sovereign. Our citizens are certainly free to divest themselves of that character, by emigration, and other acts manifesting their intention, and may then become the subjects of another power, and free to do whatever the subjects  of that power may do. But the laws do not admit that the bare Commission of a crime amounts of itself to a divestment of the character of citizen, and withdraws the criminal from their coercion. They would never prescribe an illegal act among the legal modes by which a citizen might disfranchise himself; nor render treason, for instance, innocent by giving it the force of a dissolution of the obligations of the criminal to his Country. Accordingly, in the case of Henfield, a citizen of these States, charged with having engaged in the port of Charleston in an enterprise against nations at peace with us, and with having joined in the actual Commission of Hostilities, the Attorney General of the united States, in an official Opinion declared that the act with which he was charged, was punishable by law. The same thing has been unanimously declared by two of the Circuit Courts of the United States, as you will see in the charges of Chief Justice Jay, delivered at Richmond, and Judge Wilson, delivered at Philadelphia, both of which are herewith sent. Yet Mr. Genet in the moment he l

authorized as the first enlistment of him.  
2. Another doctrine advanced by Mr. Genet is, That our Courts can take no cognisance of questions whether vessels, held by theirs, as prizes, are lawful prizes or not; that this jurisdiction belongs exclusively to their Consulates here, which have been lately erected by the national assembly into complete Courts of Admiralty.  
Let us consider first what is the extent of the Jurisdiction which the Consulates of France may rightfully exercise here. Every nation has of natural right, entirely and exclusively, all the jurisdiction which may be rightfully exercised in the territory it occupies. If it cedes any portion of that jurisdiction to Judges appointed by another Nation, the limits of their power must depend on the instrument of cession. The United  States and France, have, by their Consular Convention, given mutually to their Consuls jurisdiction in certain cases specially enumerated. But that Convention gives to neither the power of establishing complete Courts of Admiralty within the territory of the other, nor even of deciding the particular question of Prize, or not prize. The Consulates of France then cannot take judicial cognisance of those questions here. Of this opinion Mr. Genet was, when he wrote his letter of May 27. wherein he promises to correct the Error of the Consul at Charleston, of whom, in my letter of the 15th. I had complained, as arrogating to himself that jurisdiction; though in his subsequent letters he has thought proper to embark in the errors of his Consuls.  
  
June 14. 22.  
  
  
But the United States, at the same time do not pretend any right to try the validity of captures made on the high seas, by France, or any other nation, over it’s enemies. These questions belong, of common usage, to the Sovereign of the Captor, and whenever it is necessary to determine them, resort must be had to his Courts. This is the case provided for in the 17th. Article of the Treaty, which says that such prizes shall not be arrested, nor cognisance taken of the validity thereof; a stipulation much insisted on by Mr. Genet and the Consuls, and which we never thought of infringing or questioning. As the validity of captures then, made on the high seas by France over it’s enemies, cannot be tried within the United States by their Consuls, so neither can it by our own Courts. Nor is this the question between us, though we have been misled into it.  
The real Question is Whether the United States have not a right to protect vessels within their waters, and on their Coasts? The Grange was taken within the Delaware, between the shores of Jersey and of the Delaware State, and several miles above it’s mouth. The seizing her was a flagrant violation of the jurisdiction of the United States. Mr. Genet, however, instead of apologizing, takes great merit in his letters for giving her up.—The William is said to have been taken within two miles of the Shores of the united States. When the admiralty declined cognisance of the case, she was delivered to the French Consul, according to my letter of June 25th., to be kept till the Executive of the united States should examine into the case; and Mr. Genet was desired by my letter of June 29th. to have them furnished with the evidence, on behalf of the captors, as to the place of capture. Yet to this day it has never been done. The Brig Fanny was alleged to be taken within five miles from our shore. The Catharine within two miles and a half. It is an essential attribute of the jurisdiction of every Country to preserve peace, to punish acts in breach of it, and to restore property taken by force within it’s limits. Were the armed vessel of any nation to cut away one of our own from the wharves of Philadelphia, and to chuse to call it a prize, would  this exclude us from the right of redressing the wrong? Were it the vessel of another nation, are we not equally bound to protect it, while within our limits? Were it seized in any other waters, or on the shores of the united States, the right of redressing is still the same: and humble indeed would be our condition, were we obliged to depend for that on the will of a foreign Consul, or on negotiation with diplomatic Agents. Accordingly this right of protection, within it’s waters, and to a reasonable distance on it’s coasts, has been acknowledged by every nation, and denied to none: and if the property seized be yet within their power, it is their right and duty to redress the wrong themselves.—France herself has asserted the right in herself and recognised it in us, in the 6th. Article of our treaty, where we mutually stipulate that we will, by all the means in our power, (not by negotiation) protect and defend each others vessels and effects, in our ports or roads, or on the seas near our Countries, and recover and restore the same to the right owners. The United Netherlands, Prussia and Sweden, have recognised it also in treaties with us; and indeed it is a standing formule, inserted in almost all the Treaties of all nations, and proving the principle to be acknowledged by all nations.

e, in the case of the ship William, that it does not belong to the Judiciary. Another perhaps may be of a contrary Opinion. The question is still sub judice, and an appeal to the Court of last resort will decide it finally. If finally, the judiciary shall declare that it does not belong to the Civil authority, it then results to the Executive, charged with the direction of the military Force of the union, and the conduct of it’s affairs with foreign nations. But this is a mere question of internal arrangement between the different Departments of the Government, depending on the particular diction of the laws and Constitution; and it can in no wise concern a foreign nation to which department these have delegated it.  
3. Mr. Genet, in his letter of July 9. requires that the Ship Jane, which he calls an English privateer, shall be immediately ordered to depart; and, to justify this, he appeals to the 22d. Article of our treaty, which provides that it shall not be lawful for any foreign privateer to fit their Ships in our ports, to sell what they have taken, or purchase victuals, &amp;c. The Ship Jane is an English merchant vessel, which has been many years employed in the Commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce from that Island, and was to take away a cargo of flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defence, and took one of those Commissions usually  called letters of marque. She arrived here safely without having had any rencounter of any sort. Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a Husbandman following his plough, in time of war, with a Knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a Soldier? The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant-vessel is commerce and self-preservation. The article excludes the former from our ports, and from selling what she has taken, that is, what she has acquired by war, to shew it did not mean the merchant-vessel and what she had acquired by commerce. Were the merchant-vessels coming for our produce forbidden to have any arms for their defence, every Adventurer who has a boat, or money enough to buy one, would make her a privateer; our Coasts would swarm with them, foreign vessels must cease to come, our Commerce must be suppressed, our produce remain on our hands, or at least that great portion of it which we have not vessels to carry away, our ploughs must be laid aside and agriculture suspended. This is a sacrifice no treaty could ever contemplate, and which we are not disposed to make out of mere complaisance to a false definition of the term privateer

—Finding that the Jane had purchased new carriages to mount two or three additional Guns, which she had brought in her hold, and that she had opened additional port-holes for them, the carriages were ordered to be relanded, the additional port holes stopped, and her means of defence reduced to be exactly the same at her departure, as at her arrival. This was done on the general principle of allowing no party to arm within our ports.  
4. The 17th. Article of our Treaty leaves armed vessels free to conduct whithersoever they please, the Ships and goods taken from their enemies without paying any duty, and to depart and be conducted freely to the places expressed in their Commissions, which the Captain shall be obliged to shew. It is evident that this Article does not contemplate a freedom to sell their prizes here: but on the contrary a departure to some other place, always to be expressed in their Commission, where their validity is to be finally adjudged. In such case it would be as unreasonable to demand Duties on the goods they had taken from an enemy, as it would be on the cargo of a merchant vessel touching in our ports for refreshment or advices. And against this the Article provides. But the armed vessels of France have been also admitted to land and sell their prize goods here for consumption; in which case it is as reasonab

ue for the encouragement of the Sea-robbers of the other.  
5. Another source of complaint with Mr. Genet has been that the English take French goods out of american vessels, which he says is against the Law of nations, and ought to be prevented by us. On the contrary we suppose it to have been long an established principle of the Law of nations that the Goods of a friend are free in an enemy’s vessel, and an enemy’s goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend. The inconvenience of this principle, which subjects merchant-vessels to be stopped at Sea, searched, ransacked, led out of their course, has induced several nations latterly to stipulate against it by treaty, and to substitute another in it’s stead, that free bottoms shall make free goods and enemy bottoms, enemy goods; a rule equal to the other in point of loss and gain, but less oppressive to commerce. As far as it has been introduced, it depends on the treaties stipulating it, and forms exceptions in special cases to the general operation of the law of nations. We have introduced it into our treaties with France, Holland, and Prussia; and French goods found by the two latter nations in American bottoms are not made prize of. It is our wish to establish it with other nations. But this requires their consent also, is a work of time, and in the mean while they have a right to act on the general principle, without giving to us, or to France, cause of complaint. Nor do I see that France can lose by it on the whole. For though she loses her goods when found in our vessels by the nations with whom we have no treaties, yet she gains our goods, when found in the vessels of the same, and all other nations: and we believe the latter mass to be greater than the former.—It is to be lamented, indeed, that the general principle has operated so cruelly in the dreadful calamity which has lately happened in St. Domingo. The miserable fugitives, who, to save their lives, had taken asylum in our vessels, with such valuable and portable things as could be gathered in the moment, out of the ashes of their houses, and wrecks of their fortunes, have been plundered of these remains by the licensed Sea-rovers of their enemies. This  has swelled, on this occasion, the disadvantages of the general principle that ‘an enemy’s goods are free prize in the vessels of a friend.’ But it is one of those deplorable and unforeseen calamities to which they expose themselves who enter into a state of war, furnishing to us an awful lesson to avoid it by justice and moderation, and not a cause or encouragement to expose our own towns to the same burnings and butcheries, nor of complaint because we do not.  
6. In a case like the present, where the missionary of one government construes differently from that to which he is sent the treaties and laws which are to form a common rule of action for both, it would be unjust in either to claim an exclusive right of construction. Each nation has an equal right to expound the meaning of their common rules; and reason and usage has established, in such cases, a convenient and well understood train of proceeding. It is the right and duty of the foreign missionary to urge his own constructions, to support them with reasons which may convince, and in terms of decency and respect which may reconcile, the government of the country to concurrence. It is the duty of that government to listen to his reasonings with attention and candor, and to yield to them when just. But if it shall still appear to them that reason and right are on their side, it follows of necessity that, exercising the sovereign powers of the country, they have a right to proceed on their own constructions and conclusions as to whatever is to be done within their limits. The minister then refers the case to his own government, asks new instructions, and in the meantime acquiesces in the authority of the country. His government examines his constructions, abandons them, if wrong, insists on them, if right, and the case then becomes a matter of negotiation between the two nations. Mr. Genet, however, assumes a new and a bolder line of conduct. After deciding for himself ultimately, and without respect to the authority of the country, he proceeds to do what even his sovereign could not authorize, to put himself, within the country, on a line with it’s government, act as cosovereign of the territory, arms vessels, levies men, gives commissions of war, independently of them, and in direct opposition to their orders and efforts. When the government forbids their citizens to arm and engage in the war, he undertakes to arm and engage them. When they forbid vessels to be fitted in their ports for cruising on nations with whom they are at peace, he commissions them to fit and cruise. When they forbid an unceded jurisdiction to be exercised within their territory by foreign agents, he undertakes to uphold that exercise and to avow it openly. The Privateers Citoyen Genet and Sans Culottes, having been fitted out at Charleston (though without the permission of the government, yet before it was forbidden) the President only required they might leave our ports, and did not interfere with their prizes. Instead, however, of  their quitting our ports, the Sans Culottes remains still, strengthening and equipping herself, and the Citoyen Genet went out only to cruise on our coast, and to brave the authority of the country by returning into port again with her prizes. Though in the letter of June 5. the final determination of the President was communicated that no future armaments in our ports should be permitted, the Vainqueur de la Bastille was afterwards equipped and commissioned in Charleston, the Anti-George in Savannah, the Caramagnole in Delaware, a Schooner and a Sloop in Boston, and the Polly or Republican was attempted to be equipped in New York, and was the subject of reclamation by Mr. Genet, in a style which certainly did not look like relinquishing the practice. The Little Sarah or Little Democrat was armed, equipped and manned, in the Port of Philadelphia, under the very eye of the government, and as if meant to insult it. Having fallen down the River, and being evidently on the point of departure for a cruize, Mr. Genet was desired, in my letter of July 12. on the part of the President, to detain her till some inquiry and determination on the case should be had. Yet within three or four days after, she was sent out by orders from Mr. Genet himself, and is at this time cruising on our coasts, as appears by the protest of the master of one of our vessels maltreated by her.  
The government thus insulted and set at defiance by Mr. Genet, committed in it’s duties and engagements to others, determined still to see in these proceedings but the character of the individual; and not to believe, and it does not believe, that they are by instructions from his employers. They had assured the British minister here that the vessels already armed in their ports should be obliged to leave them, and that no more should be armed in them. Yet more had been armed, and those before armed, had either not gone away, or gone only to return with new prizes. They now informed him that the order for departure should be enforced, and the prizes made contrary to it should be restored or compensated. The same thing was notified to Mr. Genet in my letter of Aug. 7. and, that he might not conclude the promise of compensation to be of no concern to him, and go on in his courses, he was reminded that it would be a fair article of account against his nation.  
Mr. Genet, not content with using our force, whether we will or not, in the military line, against nations with whom we are at peace, undertakes also to direct the civil government; and particularly, for the Executive and Legislative bodies, to pronounce what powers may, or may not, be exercised by the one or the other. Thus in his letter of June 8th. he promises to respect the political Opinions of the President, till the Representatives shall have confirmed or rejected them: as if the President had undertaken to decide what belonged to the decision of Congress. In his letter of June 14. he says more openly that the President ought not to have taken on himself to decide on the subject of the letter, but that  it was of importance enough to have consulted Congress thereon: and in that of June 22d. he tells the President in direct terms that Congress ought already to have been occupied on certain questions, which he had been too hasty in deciding: thus making himself, and not the President, the judge of the Powers ascribed by the Constitution to the Executive, and dictating to him the occasion when he should exercise the power of convening Congress at an earlier day than their own act had prescribed.

No words can render them: but they will not escape the sensibility of a friendly and magnanimous nation, who will do us justice. We see in them neither the portrait of ourselves, nor the pencil of our friends; but an attempt to embroil both; to add still another nation to the enemies of his country, and to draw on both a reproach, which it is hoped will never stain the history of either. The written proofs, of which Mr. Genet was himself the Bearer, were too unequivocal to leave a doubt that the French nation are constant in their friendship to us. The resolves of their national convention, the  letters of their Executive council attest this truth in terms which render it necessary to seek, in some other hypothesis, the solution of Mr. Genet’s machinatio

ship.  
Conscious, on our part, of the same friendly and sincere dispositions, we can with truth affirm, both for our nation and government, that we have never omitted a reasonable occasion of manifesting them. For I will not consider as of that character opportunities of sallying forth from our ports to way-lay, rob, and murder defenceless merchants and others, who have done us no injury, and who were coming to trade with us in the confidence of our peace and amity. The violation of all the laws of order and morality which bind mankind together would be an unacceptable offering to a just nation. Recurring then, only to recent things, after so afflicting a libel, we recollect with satisfaction that in the course of two years, by unceasing exertions, we paid up seven years arrearages and instalments of our debt to France, which the inefficiency of our first form of Government had suffered to be accumulating: that pressing on still to the entire fulfilment of our engagements, we have facilitated to Mr. Genet the effect of the instalments of the present year, to enable him to send relief to his fellow-citizens in France, threatened with Famine: that in the first moment of the insurrection which threatened the Colony of St. Domingo, we stepped forward to their relief with arms and money, taking freely on ourselves the risk of an unauthorized aid, when delay would have been denial: that we have received according to our best abilities, the wretched fugitives from the catastrophe of the principal town of that Colony, who, escaping from the swords and flames of civil war, threw themselves on us naked and houseless, without food or friends, money or other means, their faculties lost and absorbed in the depth of their distresses: that the exclusive admission to sell here the prizes made by France on her enemies, in the present war, tho’ unstipulated in our treaties, and unfounded in her own practice, or in that of other nations, as we believe; the spirit manifested by the late Grand Jury, in their proceedings against those who had aided the enemies of France with arms and implements of war; the expressions of attachment to his nation, with which Mr. Genet was welcomed on his arrival and journey from South to North, and our long forbearance under his gross usurpations and outrages of the laws and authority of our country, do not bespeak the partialities intimated in his letters. And for these things he rewards us by endeavors to excite discord and distrust, between our citizens and those whom they have entrusted with their government, between the different branches of our government, between our nation and his. But none of these Things, we hope, will be found in his power. That friendship, which dictates to us to bear with his conduct yet awhile, lest the interests of his nation here should suffer injury, will hasten them to replace an agent, whose Dispositions  are such a misrepresentation of theirs, and whose continuance here is inconsistent with order, peace, respect, and that friendly correspondence, which we hope will ever subsist between the two nations. His government will see too that the case is pressing; that it is impossible for two sovereign and independent authorities to be going on within our territory, at the same time, without collision. They will foresee that if Mr. Genet perseveres in his proceedings, the consequences would be so hazardous to us, the example so humiliating and pernicious, that we may be forced even to suspend his functions before a successor can arrive to continue them. If our citizens have not already been shedding each others blood, it is not owing to the moderation of Mr. Genet, but to the forbearance of the Government. It is well known that if the authority of the laws had been resorted to, to stop the Little Democrat, it’s officers and agents were to have been resisted by the crew of the vessel consisting partly of American citizens. Such events are too serious, too possible, to be left to hazard, or to what is worse than hazard, the will of an agent whose designs are so mysterious.—Lay the case then immediately before his government. Accompany it with assurances, which cannot be stronger than true, that our friendship for the nation is constant and unabating; that, faithful to our treaties, we have fulfilled them in every point to the best of our understanding; that, if in any thing, however, we have construed them amiss, we are ready to enter into candid explanations, and to do whatever we can be convinced is right; that in opposing the extravagancies of an agent, whose character they seem not sufficiently to have known we have been urged by motives of duty to ourselves, and justice to others, which cannot but be approved by those who are just themselves; and finally, that, after independence and selfgovernment, there is nothing we more sincerely wish, than perpetual Friendship with them I have the honor to be with great respect &amp; est

page 60 of the printed cyrrefpondence,  
Mr. Jefferfon fays, after quoting the  
v word*, of the article, « translate this from  
the general terms in which it here stands  
into the special cafe produced by the pre­  
fcnt war,&quot; privateers not belonging to  
I ranee or the United States, and having  
commiflions from the enemies of one of  
them, &quot; are, in the present state of things,  
Bntifli, Dutch and Spanish privateers  
substituting these then for the equivalent  
term, it will (land thus,&quot;&quot; It (hall not  
b--lawful for Britilh, Dutch or Spamfh  
privateers to fit their (hips in the ports of  
th- United States.&quot;  
Is this an express permifiio&#x27;n to France  
to do it ? Does the negative to the ene­  
mies of France, and silence as to France  
herfelf, imply an affirmative to France ?  
Certainly not; it leaves the question, as  
to France, open and free to be decided  
  
according to circumstances, and if the par- ai  
i ties&gt; had meant an affirmative itipularibn, oi  
they would have provided for ft exprefsiy ; vv  
they would never have left lo important a ti  
point to be inferred from mere lilence or  
implication. Suppose they bad delired to v  
llipulate a refulal to their enemies, btft u  
noticing to themselves, what form of ex- v  
prefiion would they have used ? Certainly t  
the one they have used, an express ftipu- b  
lation as to their enemies, and (ilence as&quot; 1  
to themselves. And such an intention cor- It  
responds not Only with the words but the t  
cireumttances oi the times. It was of va- 1  
lue to fiach pttrty to exclude its enemies i  
from arming in the ports of the other, and (  
could in no cafe embarrass them. They 1  
therefore stipulated so far mutually ; but c  
each might hp embarrassed by permitting t  
the other to arm in its ports •, they there- t  
fore would not stipulate to permit that.&quot;

quote him ; page 60, he fays, &quot; Let us  
go back to the state of things in France  
when this treaty was made, and we lhall  
find feveial cases, wherein France could  
not have permitted us to arm in her ports  
frWe might have ad(}ed. gr ojir  
Spain. We know that by the treaties be­  
tween France and Spain, the former could  
not permit the enemies of the latter to  
arm in her ports. It was honest in her  
therefore not to deceive us by such a sti­  
pulation. Suppose a war between these  
states and Great Britain. By the trea­  
ties between France and Great Britain,  
in force at the Jignature of ours, we could  
not have been permitted to arm, in the  
ports of France. She could not then  
have meant m this article, to give us such  
a, right. She has manifefted the fanje  
sense of it again, in her subsequent treaty  
with England,.made eight years after our&#x27;s,  
flipulating in the 16th Art. of it as in  
our 22d that foreign privateers, not being  
fubjeits &#x27;oj either crown, should not arm  
against either in the ports of the other.  
It this had amounted to an affirmative fti­  
pulatiou, that the fubj--&amp;s~of the other  
crown might arm in her ports againjl us,  
it would have been in diredl contradiction  
to her 22d article with us. So that to  
give to these negative stipulations an affir­  
mative effect, is to render them inconfilt­  
ent with each other, and with goodfaiih ;  
to give them only their negative &amp; natural&#x27;  
effeift is to reconcile thera to one another,  
and to good faith, and is clearly to adopt  
the fenle in which France herfelf has ex­  
pounded them. We may justly conclude  
then, that the article only obliges us to  
refufe this right in the present cafe, to  
Great Britain and the other enemie« of  
r ranee , it does not go on to give it to  
France, either exprcf,ly, 0r by implicati­  
on ; we may then reful&#x27;a it.

11 Another fouree of complaint with Mr. Genet,  
has been, &quot; that the Eoglifh take French goods out  
of American vessels,*&#x27; which he fays is againtt the  
law nations, and ought to be prevented by us.  
# On the contrary, we fuppofc it to have been long an  
j ejlablijhed principle of the law oj&#x27; nations, that the  
goods of a friend are tree in an enemy&#x27;s vessel, and  
0 enemy&#x27;s goads lawful prize in the vessel of a friend.  
j ihe inconvenience of this principle, which fubje&amp;s  
merchant vessels to be flopped at sea, feaiched, ran-  
sacked, led out of their course, has inducedffevtral  
nations latterly to stipulate againji it by treaty, and  
to fubjlitute another hi its (lead, that free bottoms  
£ shall make Tree goods, and enemy bottoms, enemy  
c goods, a rule equal to the other in point of loft and  
gait1, but less oppressive to commerce. As far as it  
has been introduced, it depends tn the treaties Jiipula­  
r te&quot;g &quot;» and forms exceptions in Jpecial cases to the ge­  
neral operation of the law oj nations• We have  
introduced it into ourtreaties with France, Holland  
and Prussia j and French goods foHnd by the two  
1 latter nations in American bottoms, are not made  
-prize of. It is onr wish to establish it with other  
nations. But this requires their consent also, is a  
work of time, and in the mean while, they have a  
j right to art on the general principle, without giving to  
us, or to France, cause of complaint. Nor do I  
fee that trance cai. lose by it on the whole. For  
though she loses her goods when found iu our vef­  
e fels, by the nations with whom we have no treaties,  
e yet she gains our goods when found in the vessels  
of the fame, and all other nations; and we believe  
the latter inafs to be greater than the former. It  
t is to be lamented, indeed, that the general princi­  
ple has operated In &quot;cruelly in the dteadful calamity  
which has lately happened in St. Domingo. The  
mifcrable fugitives, who to save their lives had taken  
, asylum in our vessels, with such valuable and porta­  
ble things as could be gathered in t he moment, out  
c of the asses of their houses, and wrecks of their  
j fortunes, have been plundered of these remains by  
. the lieenfed sea rovers of their enemies. TJis has  
_ fwellcd, on this occasion, the disadvantages of the  
, general principle, -that an enemy&#x27;s goods are -free  
prize 1b the vessel of a friend. But it is en# of those  
j deplorable and uuforefeen calamities to which they  
t expose themselves who enter int« a state of  
! war, furnifKing to us an awful leff»u to avoid it by  
justice and moderation, and not a cause of eacoarage­  
| ment to expoft our towns to the fame burnings and  
j butcheries, nor of complaint because we 00  
NOT.&quot;

August, 1793, to Mr. Morris. We recolle&amp; with satisfaction, that  
in the course of two years, by unceasing exertions, we paid up seven  
years arrearages and instalments of our debt to France, which the in-  
efficacy of our first form of government had suffered to be accumulat -

which threatened the colony of St. Domingo, we stepped forward to their

taken within the Delaware, between the ſhores of the Jerſeys and of the.  
Delaware-ſtate, and ſeveral miles above its mouth. The ſeizing. of her was

her up.. The William is ſaid to have been taken within we miles.

my letter of June asth, to be kept until the Executive of the United  
States ſhould examine into the caſe, and Mr. Genet was deſired, by my,  
letter of zune agth, to have them furgiſhed with tlie evidence on behalf  
of the captors, as to the place of capture; yet to this day jr. has never.  
been done. The brig Fanny was alledged to be taken Within five miles

«© Let ws conſider firſt, what is the extent of the juriſdiction which  
the conſulates of France may rightfully exerciſe here. Every nation  
has, of natural right, entirely and excluſively, all the juriſdiction which  
may be rightfully exerciſed in the territory it occupies. If it cedes any  
portion of that juriſdiction to judges appointed by another nation, the  
limits of their power mult depend upon the inſtrument of ceſſion. The  
United States and France have, by their conſular convention, given mu—

he real queſtion is, whether the United States have not a right to pro-  
  
  
taken within the Delaware, between the ſhores of the Jerſeys and of the.  
Delaware ſtate, and ſeveral miles above its mouth. The ſeizing of her was  
a flagrant violation of the juriſdiction of the United States. Mr. Genet,  
however, inſtead of apolog1zing, takes great merit, in his letters, for giving  
her up. The William is ſaid to have been taken within two miles  
of the ſhores of the United States. When the admiralty declined cogni—  
zance of the caſe, ſhe was delivered to the French conſul, according to  
  
  
States ſhould examine into the cafe, and Mr. Genet was defired, by ny.  
letter of June 29th, to have them furmſhed with the evidence on behalf  
of the captors, as to the place of capture; yet to this day it has never  
been done. The brig Fanny was alledged to be taken within five miles  
from our ſhore : the Catharine within two nules and an half. It is an  
  
  
within its limits. Were the armed veſſel of any nation to cut away one

‘‘Another doftrige advanced by Mr.  
Genet s, Ihat our courts can take no cogni­  
zance of queltions, whether veflels held by  
them as prizes are lawful prizes or not: that  
this jurifdition belongs exclusively to their  
Consulates here, which bhave been lately  
crested by the national 2flembly into com­  
plete courts of admiralty,  
*‘Let vs confider firlt, what is the extent  
of the junldiftion which the Consulates of  
France may rightfully exercise here, Every  
pation has, of natural right, entirely and ex­  
clusively, all the jurifdition which may be  
rightfully exercised in the territory it occu­  
pies. If it cedes any portion of that jurifl­  
diction to judges appointed &#x27;by another  
nation, the himits of their power . must &#x27; de­  
pend upon the Instrument of ceflion. The:  
United States and France have by their Con­  
sular Convention given mutually to their  
Consuls juri{diftion in cerrain cales especial­  
ly énumeraied. But thar Convention gives  
to neither the power of cltablithing com­  
plete courts of admiralty, within the serri­  
tory of the other, nor even of deciding the  
Panicular gueltion of prize or not prize.  
T&#x27;be Consulates of France then, cannot  
take judiciai cognizance of thole queltions  
here. bk :  
- «Of this opinion Mr. Genet was when  
he wrote Lis letter of May e7th, wherein  
he promises to correét the error of the Con­  
fu! at Charleflon, #f whom in my letter of  
the 15th, 1 had complained as arrogating to  
“himleif that jurifdithion ; though in&#x27;his.f’%b­  
fequent letters he has thought proper to em­  
‘baik in the errors of his Consuls. | -  
‘The real qucition is, whether the United  
Statcs have not a right to proteét velle]s  
within their waters aod on their coafls ?

for giving ber up._The Wiliam is fid io

Mr. Genet was desired, by my letter of  
June 2gth, to have them furnithed with the  
~evidence on behalf of the captors, as to the  
~ place of captiire ; yet to this day it has never  
, been doge. “ The brig Fanny was alledged  
to be taken within five miles from our  
shore. The Catherine within two miles  
and an half. It isan essential atiribute of  
the jurifdittion of every country to preserve  
peace and punish afls in breach of it, and  
reffore property taken by force within its  
limits. Were the armed veliels of any  
nation to cut awdy éne of our own vessels  
from the wharves of Philadelphia, and to  
~ chufe to call it a prize, would this exclude  
us from the right of redrefling the wrong ?  
Were it the veflel of any other nation, are  
we not equally bound-to prote&amp; it while  
&quot; within our limits ? Were 1t seized in any  
~ other waters or on the shores of the United  
+ States, the right of redressing it is still the  
| fame, and humble indeed would be our con­  
[ dition were we obliged to depend for that  
i on the will of a foreign consul, or on any  
&#x27; negociation with Diplomatic Agents. Ac­  
&#x27; cordingly this right of proteftion within its  
| waters, and to a realonable distance on Its  
’ coasts, has been acknowledged by every  
&#x27; nation and denied by none; and if the  
- property {eized be yet within their power,  
it is their right and duty to redrels the  
; wrong themselves.  
. “France herfelf had asserted the right in  
. herfelf, and recognized it in us, in the 6th  
i article of our treaty, where we mutually sti­  
pulate, that we will by all the means in our  
I power (not by negociation) prote&amp;t and de­  
&#x27; fend each others veflels and effefls in our  
ports or roads, or on the seas near our coun­  
| tries, and recover and restore the fame to  
the rightowners. The United Netherlands,  
&#x27; Prufhia and Sweden, have recognized it al­  
} so in treaties with us ; and indeed it is a  
standing formule inserted in almost all the  
l treaties of all nations, and proving the prin­  
ciple to be acknowledged by all nations.

cording to my letter of June 25th, to  
be kept until the Executive of the  
United States fhould examine into  
the cafe, and Mr. Genet was defired,  
by my Jetter of June 2gth, to have  
them furnifhed with the evidence on  
behalf of the captors, as to the place  
of capture; yet to this day it has  
never been done. The brig Fanny  
was alleged to have been taken  
within five miles from our {hore : the  
Cathar:ne within two miles and an  
half. It is an effential attribute of  
the jurifdiGtion of every country to  
preferve peace and punifh acts in  
breach of it, and to reftore property  
taken by force within its limits.  
Were the armed veffel of any nation  
to cut away one of our own troin the  
wharves of Philadelphia, and to chufe  
to call it a prize, would this exclude  
us from the right of redreiling the  
wrong? Were it the veffel of ano-  
ther nation, are we not equally bound  
to protect it while within our limits?  
Were it feized in any other waters or  
on the fhores of the United States,  
the right of redrefling it is ftill the  
fame : and humbled indeed would be  
our condition were we obliged to de-  
pend for that on the will of a foreign  
conful, or on any negociation with  
diplomatic azents. Accordingly this  
right of proteétion within its waters,  
and to a reafonable diftance on its  
coafts, has been acknowledged by  
every nation and denied to none ; and  
if the property féized be yet within  
their power, it is their right and duty  
to redrefs the wron: themfelves.  
  
“ France herfelf has afferted the  
right in herfelf, and recognized it in

&quot; Conscious, on our part, of the fame  
friendly and sincere dispositions, we can with  
truth affirm, both for our nation and govern-  
that we have never omitted a reason­  
able occasion of manifesting them. For I  
will not consider as of that character oppor­  
tunities of tallying forth from our ports to  
way-l;&lt;y, rob, and murder defencelefs mer­  
chants and others, who have Cone iJs no in­  
jury, and who were coming to trade With us ;  
in the confidence of our peace and amity.  
The violation of aM the laws of order and  
morality which bind mankind together, would I  
be an unacceptable offering to a just nation. (  
Recurring then only to recent thin: s, after  
so affit&amp;ing a libel, we recoiled with fati«-  
faftion that in the course of two years, by i  
unceasing exertions, we paid up seven years  
arrearages and instalments of our debt to  
France, which the inefficacybf our fir {I form  
of government had fuffered to be accumula­  
ting ; that prefling on Hill to the entire fulfil­  
ment of our engagements, we have facilitated  
to Mr. Genet the effe£t of the instalments of  
the present yeaij to enable him to fend relief  
to his fellow-citizens in France, threatened  
with famine ; that in tht; firft moment of the  
itifurre&amp;ion which threatened the colony of  
St. Domingo, We flepped forward to their  
relief with arms and taking freely on  
©urftlves the rifle of an unauthorized aid,  
■when delay would have been denial; that we  
have received, according to oui bell abilities,  
the wretched fugitives from the catastrophe  
of the principal town of that colony, who,  
efeaping from the fwordsand flames of civil  
war, threw themlelves on us naked and;  
houseless, without food or friends, money!  
or other means their faculties loft and ab­  
sorbed in the depth of their di ft re fits ; that  
the exclusive adiiiission to sell here the prizes  
made by France on her enemies, in the pre­  
lent war, though unstipulated in our treaties,  
aud unfounded in her own practice, or in  
that of other nations, as we believe ; the  
manifefted by the late grand jury&#x27;in j  
their proceedings against those who had aide&#x27;d  
the enemies of France with arms and imple­  
ments oi war ; the expreflioii of attachment  
to his nation, with which Mr. Genet was  
welcomed, on his arrival and journey from  
south to north, and our long forbearance  
under his grot&#x27;s usurpations asd outrages of  
the laws and authority of our country, do  
not bespeak the partialities intimated in his  
letters. And for these things he rewards us  
by endeavours to excite discord and distrust  
between our citizens and those whom they  
have entrusted with their government ; be-,  
tween the different branches of our govern­  
ment ; between our nation and his. But &gt;  
none of these things, we hope, will be found t  
in his power. That friendfhip which dic­  
tates to us to bear with his conduct yet awhile, -  
kft the interest of his nation here should fuf­  
fer injury, will hasten them to replace an  
agent whose dispositions are such a mifrepre- s  
fcntation of theirs, and whose continuance  
here is inconsistent with peace, re- t  
sped, and that friendly correspondence&#x27;which &#x27;&lt;■  
vie hope will ever subsist between the two t  
nations. His.government will fee too that  
the Cafe is prefling. That it is impossible  
for two sovereign and independent authori­  
ties to be going on within our. territory, at the  
same time, without collision. They will  
forefee that if Mr. Genet perseveres in his  
proceedings, the conferences would be so &#x27;  
hazardous to us, the example so humiliating c  
and pernicious, that we may be forcetf&#x27;even 1  
to suspend his functions before a fuccefTor c  
can arrive to continue them. If our citi- 1  
jzens have not already been (hedding each a  
others blood, it is not owing to the inodera- f  
tion of Mr. Genet, but to the forbearance  
ef the government. It is well known that a  
if the authority of thA laws bad been resorted t  
to, to stop the&#x27; Little Democrat, its officers h  
and agents were to have been refilled by the &lt;&gt;  
crew of the vessel, confiding partly of Ameri- f  
fin citizens. Such events are too serious, £  
too poftible, to 1»» left to hazard, or to what b  
ir worse than hazard, the will of an agent t  
% liofe dcligns are so mysterious. Lay the  
cafe then immediately before his government; n  
accompany it with aflurances, which cannot 0  
)e stronger than true, that our friendfliijo for n  
he nation is constant and unabating ; that t  
ititbful to our treaties-, we havefulfilled them si  
1 every point, to the best of our understand- t&lt;  
&quot;g ; that if in any thing, however,we have ni  
&gt;nstrued tbcm amiss} we are ready toenter ai

we can be convinced &lt;is rightthat in oppo­

known, we nave been urged by motives of  
duty to ourjl-lves, and justice to others, which  
cannot but be approved by thole who are  
just tbemfelves; and,.finally, that, after&#x27;in­  
dependence and sef-gQvcrnment, there is no­

&quot;In my letter of June 13th, I in­  
closed M you the copies of several  
is, Which had passed between  
Mr. Ternant, Mr. Genet, and myself,  
on the Recurrences to which the pre­  
sent war had given rise within our  
ports. The object of this commu­

the principles on which our govern­  
ment was conducting itself toward*  
the belligerent parties; principles  
which might not ih all cases be satis­  
factory to all, but were meant to be

to develoj.e to him a character  
and conduct so unexpected and so ex­

in the intention&#x27;; or expectations of  
his employers. These had been too  
recently expressed in acts which no­  
thing could discolor, in the lcttcrsof  
the Executive conneil, in the letters i  
and decrees of the National Asseni-I  
bly, and in the general demeanor of  
the nation towards us, to ascribe to  
them thing&#x27;s of so contrary a charac- \
tcr. Oiir first cltjty» therefore, was ]  
to draw a strong line between their j  
j&#x27;intentions, and the proceedings ol  
: their minister ; our second, to lay  
&#x27;, those proceedings faithfully before  
them.  
&quot;On the declaration of war between  
France and England, the United  
States being at peace with both, their  
situation was so new arid unexpe­  
rienced by themselves, that their citi­  
zens were not, in the first instant sen­  
sible of the new duties resulting there­  
from, and of then it won! J  
impose even on their dl ■ to­  
wards the nt powers. Some  
of them Imagined (/and Chiefly I  
transient sea-faring citizens) that they  
were free to indulge those disposi­  
tions, to take side with either party,  
and enrich the depreda­  
tions on the c of the other,  
and were  
this nature, a_  
believe. In this state* fb&#x27;lic t  
mind, and before il should takt  
erroneous direction, difficult to Be i  
set right, and dangerous to themselves j  
and their country, the President j  
thought it expedient&#x27;, through the &#x27;  
channel of a proclamation to remind  
our fellow-citizens that we were in a  
state of peace with all the belligerent  
powers, that in that state it was our  
duty neither to aid nor injure any,  
lo exhort and warn them against acts  
which might contravene this, duty, ,  
and particularly those of positive hos­  
tility, for the punishment of which  
the laws would be appealed to ; and j  
to put them on their guard also as to  
the risks they would run, if they  
should attempt to carry articles of  
contraband to any. This prodama-:  
lion, ordered on the 19th and sigh-.  
Ed on &#x27;be Sfed. day of April, was  
sent to you in my letter of the 26tli of;  
the same month.  
&quot; On the day of its publication, we  
received thorough the channel of tire  
newspapers, the first intimation that  
Mr. Genet, had arrived on the  
of the month at Charleston, in cha­  
racter of minister p] tiary  
IV ii his nation lo the United States,  
and soon after, that he had sent on  
110 Philadelphia, the vessel in which  
he came, and would himself perform  
the journey by land. Hh landing  
at one of the most distant ports of the  
Union from his points both of depar­  
ture raid destination was calcul  
to excite attention, and very soon af­  
terwards we learnt that he was un­  
dertaking to authorise the fitting and  
arming of vessels in that boil, en­  
listing men, foreigners and citizens,  
and giving them commissions to cruise  
and commit hostilities on nations at  
peace with us, that these vessels were  
taking and bringing prizes into our  
ports, that the consuls of France  
were assuming lo hold courts of ad­  
miralty on them, to try, condemn, R  
authorise their sale as legal prize,  
and all this before Mr. Genet had  
presented himself, or his Credentials  
to the President, before he was re­  
ceived by him, without his conset.t  
or consultation, and directly in con  
travention of the slate of peace ex­  
isting! and declared to exist in the&#x27;  
President&#x27;s proclamation, and incum­  
bent on him to preserve till the con­  
stitutional authority should otherwise j  
declare. These proceedings became.  
immediately, as was naturally lobe  
expected, the subject of complaint j  
by llie representative here of that  
power against whom they would chief­  
ly operate. The British minister pre­  
sented several memorials thereon, to  
Which we gave the answer of May Uth  
heretofore inclosed to you, corres­  
ponding in substance wilt), a letter of  
the same date, written to Mr. Ter- ;  
nam, the minister of France then..­  
residing here, a copy of which I ;  
send herewith. On the next day Mr.  
Genet reached this place, about live  
or six weeks after he had arrive  
Charleston, and might have b&lt;  
Philadelphia, if he had steered lor il  
directly. Xc was immediately pre­

nothing could be more assuaging ih in  
bis assurances to the President at his  
reception, which he repeated to me  
i afterwards in conversation, and in pub­  
! lie to the citizens of Philadelphia, in  
answer to an address from them,  
that, on account of our remote situa­  
tion and other circumstances, France  
; did not expect that we should become  
i a party lo the war, but wished to see  
jus pursue our prosperity and happi­  
ness and peace.&quot;  
Mr. Jefferson then enumerates the  
several points set up by Mr. Genet.  
&quot;Ist. Mr. Genet asserts his right  
of arming ii. our ports, and of en­  
listing our citizens, and that we have  
no right to restrain him or punish  
the in.  
&quot;2d. Another1 doctrine advanced  
by Mr. Genet is, That our courts  
can take no cognizance of questions,  
Whether vessels held by theirs prises,  
are lawful prizes or not : i hat this  
jurisdiction belongs exclusively to  
their consulates here, which have  
■ lately erected by the National  
Assembly, into complete courts of ad

Both these doctrines are ably re­  
futed.  
&quot; 3d. Mr. Genet, in his letter of  
July 9th, requires that the ship Jane,  
which he calls .\\\ English privateer,  
shall he immediately ordc;od to de­  
part ; and to justify this, he appeals  
to the 22d article of our treaty,  
which pro it it shall not be  
lawful for any Hvat&#x27;eer lo fit  
their ships in purports, to sell what  
thru have taken, or purchase victuals,  
The ship sme is an English  
bant vessel, which has been  
many years employed in the com­  
merce between Jamaica and these  
states. She brought here a cargo of  
produce from that island, and was to  
take away a cargo of Hour. Knowing  
of the war when she left Jamaica,  
and that our coast was lined with  
small French privateers, she armed  
for her defence, and took one of those  
commissions usually called Letters of  
Marque. She arrived here safely,  
without having bad any rencounter of  
any sort. Can it be necessary to say,  
that a merchant vesflt lis not a priva­  
teer ? That though she has arms to  
defend herself in time of wrr, in the  
course of her rep ukir commerce, this  
con- i her a privateer, than a  
husbandman following his plough, in  
time of war, with a knife or pistol in  
his pocket, is thereby made a soldier ?  
The oriup.ition of a privateer is to  
attack and plunder, that of a mer­  
i vessel is commerce and self

.n.&quot;  
The 17th article of our treaty  
haves armed vessels free to conduct,  
whithersoever they plea.se;, the ships  
and goods taken from their enemies,  
without paying any duty, and to de­  
part and be conducted freely to the  
places expressed in their commissi)  
which the captain shall be obliged lo  
shew. It is evident, thai this article  
not contemplate a freedom to  
heir prize&#x27;s here ) hut, on the con­  
trary, a departure to some other plai &quot;,  
always lo be expressed in their c  
ion, where their validity is to be  
finally adjudged.&#x27;*  
&quot; sth. Another source of complaint  
with Mr. Genet, has been, that t.,c j  
lish take French goods out of A- ,  
meiican vessels, which he saysis&#x27;-a-j  
I the law of nations, andougl  
ited by us. Qn the contrary,  
Il to have bi en long an  
law of ua- |  
os of a friend are j  
fixe Hi an ei.v.iiij&#x27;s vessel, and an c- j  
nemv&#x27;s goocls lawful prize in the ves­  
sel of a friend.&quot;  
&quot; Bfh. In a case like the present,  
where the missionary of one govern­  
ment construes differently from that  
to which he is sent, the trea ieS and  
laws which are to form a common  
rule of action for both, it would be un­  
just In either to claim an exclusive  
right of construction. Each nation  
has an equal right to expound the  
meaning ot their common rules; and  
[ reason and usage have established, in  
such cases, a convenient and well un­  
derstood train of proceeding. It is  
the right and duty of tin  
sionary to urge his own copsErucl  
pport i hem whh reasons v.  
may convince, and m terms of de­  
cency and respect which may reoon­  
govcrnment of the country  
to a concurrence. It is the duty of  
that government to listen to bis rea­  
son;; 101 l and candor, and  
  
ito yield to them when just. But if it  
shall still appear to them that reason  
and right are on their side, it follows  
of necessity that, exercising the so­  
vereign powers of the country, they  
have a light to proceed on their own  
constructions and conclusions as to  
whatever is to be done within their  
limits. The minister then refers the  
case to his own government, asks new  
instructions, and in the mean time ac­  
quiesces in the authority of the coun­  
try. His government examines bis  
constructions, abandons them, if  
wrong, insists On them, if right, and  
j the case then becomes a matter ol ne­  
i.gouation between the two nations.  
; Mr, Genet, however, assumes a new ;  
: and a bolder line of conduct. After  
I deciding for himself ultimately, and j  
without respect to the authority of the j  
country, he proceeds lo do, what even I  
his sovereign could not authorise ; to i  
put himself, within the country, on a  
line with its government, act as co­  
sovereign of the territory, arms ves­  
sels, levies men, gives commissions  
of war, independently of them, and  
in direct opposition lo their orders  
and efforts. When the government  
forbids l heir citizens to arm and en­  
gage in the war, he unckrt ikes to arm  
and engage them. When the}&#x27; forbid  
vessels to be fitted in their ports lor  
cruising on nations with whom they  
fere at peace, he commissions them to  
fit and cruize. When they forbid an  
tinceded jurisdiction lo be i x&lt; rcised  
within their territory by foreign a­  
gents, he undertakes to uphold that  
exercise, and to avow it openly. The*  
privateers Citizen Genet and Sans Cu­  
lottes, having Keen fitted out at Chat lcs­  
ton, (though without permission of  
the government, yel before it was for- j  
bidden) the President only Required  
they might have our ports, and did  
not interfere with their prizes. In-&#x27;  
stead, however, of thci&#x27;&quot; quilting our  
ports, the Sans Culottes remainsstili,  
strengthening and equipping herself, j  
and the Citizen Genet went out only  
to cruize on otir cfoast, and to brave j  
the authority of the country by re- |  
turning into port again with her prizes. I  
Though in the letter of June sth, the  
final determination of the Pi esidert I  
was communicated, that no future ar­  
maments in our ports should be per­  
mitted, the Vainquer de la Bastille,  
was afterwards equipped and i ommis- j  
sioned in Charleston, the Anti-i*ebrge, i  
in Savannah, the Carainao-nole, in De- &#x27;  
lawrtre, a schooner, and a sloop, in  
Boston, and the Polly or Republican  
was attempted to be equipped in New- I  
York, and was the Subject ofreclaraai &#x27;  
lion by Mr. Genet, in a style which  
■ certainly did not look like relinquish­  
ing the practice. The Little Sarah or  
Little Democrat was armed, equipped  
and manned, in the port of Philadel­  
phia, under the very eye of the go­  
vernment, and as if meant to insult  
it. Having fallen down the liver and &#x27;  
being evidently on the point of depar­  
ture for a cruize, Mr. Genet was de­  
sired, in my letter of July 12th, o;  
the part of the President, to dc  
her till some inquiry -.nd determina­  
tion on the case should be: bad. Yet  
within three or four days after, she  
, was sent oui by orders from Mr. Genet  
I hirhself, andisat this time cruizing on I  
our coasts, as appears by the protest  
lot the master of one of our vessels  
j mal&#x27;-trcated by her.  
&quot; The government thus insulted  
and si nee by Mr. Genet, com­  
mitted in its duties and Engagements  
toothers, determined still to see in  
j these proceedings but the character  
jof the individual ; and not to believe,  
! audit does not believe, that they are j  
by instructions from his em&#x27;ploj  
They had assured the British minister .  
here that the vess. lj armed j  
in their ports should be obliged to  
leave them, and that no more should  
be armed in them. Yet more had  
been armed, and those before armed,  
had cither not gone away, or KOi.e  
only to return with new prizes. They  
now informed him that the order i&#x27;or  
departure should be enforced, and the  
prizes made contrary to it should he  
restored of compensated. The same  
thing was notified to Mr. Genet in my  
gust 7th ; and, that be  
iclude the promise of  
oncera to  
him, and go ot. in bis course, he  
reminded that it would be a fail  
cleof account against his nation.

nations, founded on the general sense und usuge of

enlightened and upproved writers on the subject,  
that a neutral nation must, in all things relating to  
the war, observe un exact impartiality towurds the  
parties; that favors to one to the prejudice of the other  
would import a fraudulent neutrality of which no  
nation would be the dupe; that no succor should be  
given to either, unless stipulated by treaty, in men,  
arms, or any thing else, directly serving for war;  
that the right of raising troops, being one of the  
rights of sovereignty, and consenuenlly appertaining  
exclusively to the nation itself, no foreign power  
can levy men within its territory, without its assent;  
and he who does, may be rightly and severely  
punished; that if the United Slates have a right to  
refuse permission to arm vessels and raise men  
within their ports and territories, they are bound by  
the laws of neutrality to exercise that right, and to  
prohibit such armaments and enlistments. To these  
principles of the law of nations, Mr. Genet answers,

pat we have adverted to the tecent arreats, bat  
simply to introcuce to our readers an carly authe  
rity on neutral duties whion we met with yester-  
day as a gentleman in Junius said, &quot;in the couree  
ot our morning&#x27;s reading.&quot; This athority is a  
a a ee o  e o o e o  
written in August, 1793. We give an extract from  
it, for its bearing on questions which havs oatered  
eeo largel into our recent poltica discasions and  
for the weight which the opinions of Mr. Jeffersos  
carry with so large a part of our readers, premising.  
hewever, that we think the argument pushed a  
little into extremes  
THE SETRAOT.  
The United States being in a state of peare with most  
of the belligerent powers, by treaty, and with all of  
them by the laws of nature, murders and robberice coms  
mitted by our citireas within our territory or on the  
high seas on thore with whom we are to at peace, are  
punisbable equally as if committed on our own lababtt  
ants. If I might venturs to reason a little formatly.  
withont being charged with running into &quot;subtleue?  
and aphorisis,&quot; I would say that if one citizen has a  
right to go to war of bis own authority, every citizes  
has the same. If every citiren bas that right, then the  
nation (which is composed of all ita citixensy has a  
right to go to war by the authority of its individual  
eltisens. But this ie not true, e ther on the general pria  
ciples of soclety or by our constitution, which gives  
that power to Congress alone, and not to the citizens ta  
ividually. Then the urst position was not trus, and  
no citizen has a right to go to war of his own authority  
and for what he does without right he ought to be pue  
lshed. Indeed, sothing can be more obviously aburd  
than to say that all the citizens may be at war and yet  
the nation at peace.  
It has been pretended, indeed, that the engagement of  
a citiren in an esterprise of this naturs wasa divest  
ment of the charecter of citizen, and a transter of jeris  
diction over him to another sovereign. Our eitirens are  
certainly fres to divest themselves of that character by  
emigration and other acts manitesting their intentlos,  
and may then be come the sublects of another power, and  
fres to do whatever the subjects of that power may do.  
But the laws do not admit that the bare commission of  
on a aun o ite toisen of the he  
racter of citizen and withdraws the criminal from their  
coctelon. They would never preacribe an illegal act  
among the legel modes by which a citiren might  
disfranchize himself, ner render trenson, for lastance,  
innocent, by giving it the force of a dissolution of  
the obligation of the criminal to his country. Ae  
cordingy, in the case of Henfelld, a cltlen of these  
Stater, charged with baving engaged in the port  
of Charleston in as enterprise against nations at piace  
with us, $24 with having soined in the actual con  
mission of hortilities, the Attorney General of the  
Untted States, in an official opinion, declared that the  
act with which he was charged was punishabls by lew.  
The same thing has bege unanimouely declare! by iwe

enlisting men within the territory of the United States, being  
a neutral nation, thus speaks: “ examining this question under  
the law of nations, and the general usage of mankind, the  
American Government preduced proofs, from the most enlight-  
ened and approved writers on the subject, that a neutral nation  
must in respect to war, observe an exact impartiality towards  
the belligerent parties ; that favors to the one, to the prejudice  
of the other, would import a fraudulent neutrality of which no  
nation would be the dupe; that no succor ought to be given to  
either, unless stipulated by treaty, in men, arms, or anything  
else directly serving the war ; that the right of raising troops  
being one of the rights of sovereignty, and consequently apper-  
taining exclusively to the nation itself, no foreign power can
