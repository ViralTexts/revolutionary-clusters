Sir,  
July 15th, 1808.  
  
I have read and considered the papers and documents referred to me relative to the case of a mandamus, issued by the circuit court of the United States for the district of South Carolina to compel the collector of the port of Charleston to grant clearances to certain vessels.  
The first question that naturally presents itself, is, whether the court possessed the power of issuing a mandamus in such a case?  
A mandamus in England, is styled a prerogative writ, and in that country is awarded solely and exclusively by the court of kings-bench.  
The constitution and laws of the United States establish our judicial system. To these we must refer in order to ascertain the jurisdiction of the respective courts, the extent of their powers, and the limits of their authority.  
The “Act to establish the judicial courts of the United States,” passed on the 24th September, 1789, declares and defines the jurisdiction of the several courts thereby created, and among these the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Upon a careful and attentive perusal, it will be found to delegate to the circuit courts no power to issue writs of mandamus. In the thirteenth section of that act this authority is expressly given to the supreme court of the United States. In like manner it is specially provided by the act of the 3d of February, 1801, that the supreme court shall have power to issue writs of mandamus. This last act having been repealed and the former revived, the question must rest on the true construction to be given to the original act.  
The eleventh section defines and limits the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. It is specially appropriated to this single object. There are no expressions in this section which can fairly be interpreted to confer the authority of issuing writs of mandamus. Nor can the power be either implied or inferred from any language it contains. It is true, the proceeding by mandamus in England is on the crown side, as it is termed, of the court of kings-bench. But it is a prosecution relative to a civil right to enforce it, and to obtain prompt redress; and not to punish criminally as in the case of an offence. The provision therefore that the circuit courts, “shall have exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the United States, except when the act otherwise provides &amp;c.” cannot warrant such a proceeding. Besides the same act does provide that the supreme court shall issue writs of mandamus. An authority given perhaps because its jurisdiction extended all over the United States.  
The fourteenth section, immediately succeeding that which gives this authority in plain and positive terms to the supreme court, solely, if not exclusively, (and the affirmative frequently, and in this case justly, I think implies a negative) contains the following provision. “All the before mentioned courts of the United States (including the supreme, as well as the circuit and district courts) shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions.” This clause cannot affect the case, I conceive. The mandamus is a writ, which we have seen is specially provided for by law. This section was evidently not designed to give any additional jurisdiction to either of the courts, but merely the means of executing that jurisdiction already granted to them respectively. The issuing of a mandamus in the case under consideration was an act of original jurisdiction. Precisely as much so, as it would have been in the supreme court, to have exercised the power in the case of Marbury vs. Madison. In that case the supreme court declared, that to issue a mandamus to the secretary of state, would be, to exercise an original jurisdiction, not given by the constitution, and which could not be granted by Congress. The constitution having enumerated or declared the particular cases in which the supreme court should exercise original jurisdiction, tho’ there were no negative expressions, the affirmative they considered implied them. It was on this principle alone they refused to exert their authority.  
The practice I believe, has uniformly been, so far as I can trace it from the books of reports, that have been published, or from recollection and experience on the subject, to apply to the supreme court for a mandamus. This court it is true have determined not to issue the writ, when it would be an act of original jurisdiction. But this I apprehend, can afford no ground for the circuit court’s assuming an authority, which the supreme court have declined, unless by a legislative act the power be delegated to them. This power is not inherent nor necessarily incidental to a court of justice, even of general jurisdiction. For in England but a single one, of several courts having general jurisdiction, possesses the authority. Neither the chancery, the common pleas, nor the exchequer, though classed among the kings-superior courts, and having general jurisdiction over the realm, can exercise this power. It is the peculiar privilege of the king’s bench alone. Our circuit courts have merely a local and subordinate jurisdiction. Their analogies therefore with the four courts of England, having general and superior jurisdiction, must be very weak, and still weaker their claim to the pre-eminent distinction of the kings-bench, which possesses solely the exclusive authority of issuing the mandamus.  
For these reasons I am induced to believe from the best consideration I have been enabled to give the subject, that the circuit court of South Carolina had not authority to issue a mandamus to the collector of the port of Charleston.  
It is scarcely necessary to remark, that when a court has no jurisdiction, even consent will not give it, and much less will the mere tacit acquiescence of a party, in not denying their authority.  
Independent of this serious and conclusive objection to the proceeding adopted by the court, there are others entitled to consideration. For supposing the court did not err in the exercise of jurisdiction, and admitting the British doctrines on the subject without restriction or limitation could be extended to this country, there are legal exceptions to the course they have pursued, supported by English authority.  
In the first place, the law gave the collector complete discretion over the subject. According to the opinion he might form, he possessed competent authority to grant, or refuse a clearance. And I apprehend where the law has left this discretion in an officer; the court, agreeably to the British practice and precedents, ought not to interpose, by way of mandamus.  
Secondly. In this case there was a controuling power in the chief magistrate of the United States. There was in fact, an express appeal given to the President by the very words of the act of Congress, which authorises the collectors to detain vessels, “until the decision of the President of the United States be had thereupon.” By the mandamus the reference to the President is taken away, and the collector is commanded to clear the vessel without delay. Agreeably to the English authorities under such circumstances, it is not the course I believe to issue a mandamus.  
Thirdly. The parties it seems had their legal remedy against the collector, and it is not usual, if not unprecedented, to grant a mandamus in such a case.  
Fourthly. A mandamus is not issued to a mere ministerial officer to compel him to do his duty. The court will leave the parties to their remedy by action, or even by indictment. In England, in a very late case, they decided that they would not grant a mandamus to a ministerial officer, such as the treasurer of a county, for the proper remedy was by indictment.  
I am aware of a precedent in which it seems to be admitted that a mandamus may issue to the commissioners of excise, to compel them in a proper case to grant a permit. This case is more analogous to the one now before us than any other, I have been able to discover, after a diligent research. But in this instance the point was not made, nor the question argued. Besides the commissioners of excise in England form a board for superintending the collection of that branch of the revenue. They constitute in many respects a court of inferior jurisdiction, which in particular cases takes cognizance in a summary way, of offences against the excise laws. A mandamus might be granted to such a tribunal when it would not be issued to a mere ministerial officer, acting under them in the collection of the revenue.  
Its results from this view of the subject that the mandamus issued by the circuit court for the district of South Carolina, was not warranted by any power vested in the circuit courts by statute: nor by any power necessarily incident to courts, nor countenanced by any analogy between the circuit courts, and the court of kings-bench, the only court in that country possessing the power of issuing such writs. And it further appears that even the court of kings-bench for the reasons assigned, would not, agreeably to their practice and principles have interfered in the present case by mandamus.  
It might perhaps with propriety be added that there does not appear in the constitution of the United States any thing which favors an indefinite extension of the jurisdiction of courts, over the ministerial officer within the executive department. On the contrary, the careful discrimination which is marked between the several departments, should dictate great circumspection to each, in the exercise of powers having any relation to the other.  
The courts are indubitably the source of legal redress for wrongs committed, by ministerial officers, none of whom are above the law. This redress is to be administered by due and legal process in the ordinary way. For there appears to be a material and an obvious distinction, between a course of proceeding, which redresses a wrong committed by an executive officer, and an interposition by a mandatory writ, taking the executive authority out of the hands of the President, and prescribing the course, which he and the agents of any department must pursue. In one case the executive is left free to act in his proper sphere, but is held to strict responsibility; in the other all responsibility is taken away, and he acts agreeably to judicial mandate. Writs of this kind if made applicable to officers indiscriminately, and acts purely ministerial, and executive in their nature, would necessarily have the effect of transferring the powers vested in one department to another department. If in a case like the present, where the law vests a duty and a discretion in an executive officer, a court can, not only administer redress against the misuse of the authority, but can previously direct the use to be made of it, it would seem that under the name of a judicial power, an executive function is necessarily assumed, and that part of the constitution perhaps defeated, which makes it the duty of the President to take care, that the laws be faithfully executed. I do not see any clear limitation to this doctrine, which would prevent the courts from compelling by mandamus all the executive officers, all subordinate to the President at least, whether charged with legal duties in the treasury or other department, to execute the same according to the opinion of the judiciary and contrary to that of the executive. And it is evident that the confusion arising will be greatly increased by the exercise of such a power, by a number of separate courts of local jurisdiction, whose proceedings would have complete and final effect, without an opportunity of controul by the supreme court. So many branches of the judiciary, acting within their respective districts, their courses might be different, and different rules of action might be proscribed for the citizens of the different states, instead of that unity of administration which the constitution meant to secure by placing the executive power for them all, in the same head.  
What too becomes of the responsibility of the Executive to the court of impeachment, and to the nation? Is he to remain responsible for acts done by command of another department? Or is the nation to lose the security of that responsibility altogether? From these and other considerations, were this branch of the subject to be pursued, it might be inferred, that the constitution of the United States, by the distribution of the powers of our government to different departments, ascribing the executive duties to one, and the judiciary to another, controls any principles of the English law, which would authorise either to enter into the department of the other, to annul the powers of that other, and to assume the direction of its operations to itself.  
These remarks are respectfully submitted to your consideration. They are made with due deference to the opinion of the court, with one of the judges constituting which, I am personally acquainted, and for whose character I feel the sincerest regard.  
Yours very respectfully,  
  
C. A. Rodney.

I have read and considered ic papers  
and documents referred to me relative to the  
case of a mandamus, issued by the circuit  
court of the United States for the district of  
South Carolina to com pel the collector of the  
port of Charleston to grant clearances to cer­  
tain vessels.  
„ The first question that presents itself is,  
whether the court possessed the power of is­  
suing a mandamus in such a case?  
A mandamus in England, is styled a pre­  
rogative writ, and in that country is award­  
ed solely and exclusively by tiie court of  
king’s-bench.  
The constitution and laws of the United  
States establish our judicial system. To  
these we must refer in order to ascertain the  
jurisdiction of the respective courts, the ex­  
tent of their powers, and the limits of their  
authority.  
Tlie “ Act to establish the judicial courts  
of the United States,” passed on the 24ih of  
September 1789, declares and defines the ju­  
risdiction of the several courts, thereby cre­  
ated, and among these the jurisdiction of the  
circuit courts. Upon a careful atul attentive 1  
perusal it will be found to delegate to the cir­  
cuit courts no power to* issue writs of man­  
dumus. In the thirteenth section of that act.  
this authority is expressly given to the su­  
preme court of the United States. In like  
manner it is specially provided by the act of  
the third of February, 1801. that the supreme  
court shall have power to issue writs of man­  
damus. This last act having been repealed  
and the former revived, the question must  
rest upon the true construction to be given  
t» the original act.  
The eleventh section defines and limits the  
jurisdiction of the circuit courts. It is spe­  
cially appropriated to this single object.—  
There are no expressions in this section  
which can fairly be interpreted to confer the  
  
authority ot issuing writs ot mandamus, IN or  
can the power be either implied or inferred  
from any language it contains. It is true the  
proceeding by mandamus in England is on  
the crown side, as it is termed, of the couit  
of king’s-bcnch. But it is a prosecution rela­  
ti\e to the civil right to enforce it, and to  
obtain prompt redress; and not to punish  
Ci imiimiiy as in the case oi an offence. 1 lie  
provision therefore that the circuit courts  
41 shall have exclusive cognizance of all  
44 crime* and offences cognizable under the  
4‘ authority of the United States, r-veejit I  
44 when the ace otherwise ftrqvules O&#x27;c.&quot; can­  
not warrant such a proceeding. Besides the  
same act, docs provide that the supremo  
court shall issue writs of mandamus. An au­  
thority given perhaps, because its jurisdic­  
tion extends all over the United States.  
The fourteenth section, immediately suc­  
ceeding that which gives this authority in  
plain and positive terms to the supreme i  
onnrt.fsnlelv. if tint evr.lnsivi Iv, And tile af- &#x27;  
firmative.frequently, and in this case justly, !  
I think implies a negative,) contains tliefol- ;  
lowing provision. 44 All the before menti­  
4‘ oned Courts of the United States, (inclu- j  
“ ding the supreme, as well as the circuit j  
“and district courts) shall have powet to&#x27;  
“ issue writs of scire jarias, habeas corfius, !  
“ and all other writs not specially provided  
“ fdr by statute, which may be necessary !  
*„ f&gt;r the exercise of their respective juris-;  
“ dictions.” This clause cannot effect the !  
case. I conceive. The mandamus is a writ, I  
which we have seen is specially provided for [  
by law. This section was evidently not de­  
signed to give any additional jurisdiction to •  
either of the courts, hut merely the means i  
of executing that jurisdiction already gran- j  
ted to them respectively. The issuingqf a &#x27;  
inayulamus in the case under consideration  
was an act -of original jmisdictign. Pre­  
cisely as much so. as it would have been in  
the supreme court, to have exercised the .  
Power in the case of Marbury vs. Madison. !  
In that case the supreme court declared* that  
to issue a mandamus to the Secretary of  
J&#x27;tute, would be to exercise an original ju­  
risdiction, not given by the constitution, and  
which could not be granted In Congress —  
  
i ie wiusuniuun inving cmmuTiuco or He­  
el u eel the- particular cassia which the su­  
preme court should exercise original juris­  
diction, though there were no negative ex­  
pressions, the affirmative they c .nsidered  
implied them. It was on this principle a­  
lone they refused to exert their authority.  
. The practice I believe, has uniformly been,  
so far as i can trace it front the hooks of re­  
ports, that have been published, or from re­  
collection and experience on the subject, to;  
apply to the supreme Court fora nraiittamun.  
This court, itistvue, have determined not to  
Issue toe writ wlun it would he an act of n­  
riginnl jurisu&#x27;cthin. Puttb’#, 1 apprehend,  
Can afford no gvr.nr.b far the circuit court’s as­  
suming an authority, which the supreme  
Court h ive declined, ttn&#x27;ess by a legislative  
®i t the power he delegated to them. This  
power is not inherent nor necessarily inci­  
dental to i court of justice, even of general  
jurisdetiou. For in England, hut a single  
one, of several cru&#x27;ts having gci&#x27;-ml jmi.-.­  
diction, po- w.-sses the authoiitv. Neither  
tlu chant rrv, the cointnen pi? n, nor the  
exchequer,tturn&#x27;ll c’fts ed among the king’s  
superior t mrts, and having general jurisdic- .  
lion over the red a, can exercise this power. .  
It is the peculiar privilege of the king’s-bcnch  
al -iic. Ouf circuit co ins have mereV a io- 1  
cal ar.d yuhord&#x27;iuite jurisdiction. Tiieir a­  
in i&#x27;.t.&#x27;ics therefore w ith the four cnitr.sof,  
England, having genera! and supe,;Tor juris­  
dicion, must be very weak, aw! still weak-&#x27;  
i t-tlu ir claim t &lt; tin pre-eminent distinction 1  
cl the king’ -bench which pm-&#x27;-esves s ih j  
the exclusive authority of issuing the man­

For these reasons I am induced to believe  
from the be t c nvide’’ition I have b&lt; &lt;• m- ,  
ahled to give the subject, that the Circuit I  
Court ot South Carolina h d no* u.horitvto:  
issue ri irai&#x27;do?.»w. to the Collector «f the :  
pert of Charleston.  
It is scarcely necessary to remark, that  
when a court lias no jurisdiction, even Con­  
vent will not give und much les* w ill the  
Tncre tact acpnicccnco of a party, in not  
denying thc.r authority.

tended to this fconntry, there arc lcgef ex­  
ceptions to the course they have pursued,  
supported by English authority.  
In the first place, the law gave thecollec­  
complete discretion over the subject-_  
According to the opinion lie might form. he  
possessed competent authority to grant or re­  
fuse a clearance. And I apprehend where  
the law has left this discretion in an offi cr,  
tlie court, agreeably to the British practice  
and precedents, ought not to interpose, by­  
way of mandamus.  
2dly. In this case there was a controuling  
power in the Chief Magistrate of the United  
States. There was in fact, nil express ap­  
| peal given to the President by the very words  
«.t tlir.net of congress, which authorises the  
collectors to detain vessels, “ until the deci­  
sion of the President fie had thereupon.’*  
H.V the mandamus the reference to the Pre­  
sident is taken away, and the collector is-com­  
manded to clear the vessel without delpy.  
Agreeably to the English Authorities under  
sn« li circumstances, it is not the course I be­  
lieve to issue a mandamus.  
Sdly. The parties it seems had their legal  
remedy against the collector, un i it is not u­  
sual, it not unprecedented, to grant a man­  
damus in such a cane.  
4thly. A m mdamtis is not issued to a mere  
ministerial officer to compel him to do his  
duty. The court will leave the parties to  
their remedy hv action, or even by indict­  
ment. In England, in a very late case, thev  
decided that they WMild grant a mandamus  
to a ministerial officer, such ns the treasu­  
rer of a county, for the proper remedy was  
by indictment.  
I ain aware of a precedent in wh-ich it  
scents to be admitted that a mandamus may  
issue to the commissioners of excise, to com -  
pel them in a proper case to grant a furmit !  
1 his case is more analogous to the one now  
before us than any other, l have been able !  
to discover, after a diligent research, lint |  
in tliis instance tEc point was not made, nor j  
the question aigued. besides the commi .­  
sioners of excise in England form a boa. 1  
for superintending the cfllection of that  
branch of the revenue; They constitute in  
many respects a court of inferior jurisdicti­  
on, which in particular cases takes cogni­  
zance in a summary way, of offences against  
the excise laws. A mandamus might be  
granted to such, a tribunal, when it would  
m&gt;t lie issued to a mere ministei ial officer, ac­  
ting unde*, them in the collection of the re­  
venue.  
  
it results from this view of the subject,  
that the mandamus issued bv the circuit  
court for the district of South Carolina, was  
not warranted by any power vested in thfe  
circuit courts by statute : nor by any power  
necessarily incident&#x27;to courts, nor counte -  
ii.iut.cu b. any analogy between the circuit  
courts, and the c.ouit of King’s banch, the  
only court in that country possessing tlie  
power of issuingsuch writs. And it further  
appears that even the court of Iving&#x27;s­  
bench, for the reasons assigned, would not  
agreeably to their practice am! principles  
have interfered in the present Case by mau­  
damun.  
It might perhaps with propriety* he added  
that there does not appear in the constituti­  
on of the U. State? any thing which favours  
an indefinite extension of the jurisd iction of j  
courts&#x27;over the ministerial officer within the  
executive Hrimvimi&#x27;ni. 0;i the contrary  
t e careful di crimination which is marked  
between the several departments, should  
dictate great circumspection to each, in the  
exercise of powers, having any relation to  
the other.  
The courts are indubitably the source  
of legal redress fur wrongs committed bv  
ministerial officers, none o! vyhom are above  
the law. Tins redress is to be administer­  
ed by due--and legal process in the ordina­  
ry wav. For theta appears to be a mate­  
rial and an ob\i*vis distinction, between a  
course of proceeding, which redresses a  
wrong cu::imit*ed by-an . executive officer,  
and aii interposition by* a.mainl&amp;toLy writ,  
taking the executive authority out of the  
hands of the President, and prescribing tne  
course, which lie and the agents of any de­  
partment must pursue. In the one case the  
Executive is left free to ret in his proper  
sphere, but is held to strict responsibility;  
in the other all responsibility &quot;A taken away,  
and he acts agreeably to judicial mandate.  
Writs of this kind if made applicable to offi­  
cers indiscriminately, and acts purely mi­  
nisterial, and executive in their nature,  
would necessarily have the effect .of trans­  
ferring tiie powers vested in one department  
to another department, If in a case like j  
the present, where the law rests a duty  
  
ami :i discretion in an executive officer, a !  
court can n it only administer redress a-j  
£ unst t!ic misuse of the authority, hut can ;  
previously direct the use to be made of it,  
• f would seem that under die name of a ju­  
dicial po\vfer an executive function is neces­  
sarily assumed and tea part of the consti­  
tution peril ips defeated, which makes it j  
the duty nr tire President to take cnrtj that!  
t!ic laws lie faithfully exeentt 1, 1 do not I  
S”i- any clear li nitntioh to this doctrine !  
w hich would p&#x27;&#x27;evert the courts from com- j  
pci.it g by i&#x27; &#x27;mu,trim all the executive j  
officers, nil subordinate to the President at  
least, whether charged with legal duti»* j* |  
the Treasury or other departments, to *\­  
ecutc the same according to the opifiton of  
tli»• judiciary and contrary to tint of ♦ ;,» !  
executive. And it is evident ‘hat the con-1  
fu .ion arising wili be greatly increased by  
the exercise of such a power bv n number  
ot separate court.* of local jurisdiction,  
whose proceedings would have complete  
an i final effect, without an opportunity of  
c(Jutrrnil by the supreme court. So many  
branches of the judiciary acting within their  
respective district*, their courses might lie  
different, and different rules of action might  
b pvesentid f.a d.e citizens of the different  
states, instead of tint unity of administrati­  
n&#x27;! which ihc constitution meant to secure  
In placing the executive power for them  
all in the same head.  
&quot;’bat too In cotnes r&gt;f the responsibility of

: ;id to the nation? Is he to remain re spun i­  
I). for acts done bv comniard of another *’/•­  
p- itoo m * Or is thetiati &gt;t« to lose the secu­  
rity of that responsibility altogether? From  
tlu e and other cunv.derations, were this  
brarch of tlnj subject tot be pursued it might  
he inferred, that the Constitution of the Uni­  
ted States, by t!ir distrifiution of the powers  
of our govern men* to different department!,  
ascribing the executive duties’tonne, and the  
judiciary to another, controls any principles  
of the F.nglish law, which would authorise  
either to enter into the departments&#x27;-f the o­  
thcr, to nrnml the powi rs of that other, and  
to a* so me thC direction of its operations to it­  
self.

I I have read and considered :he pa­  
t pers and documents referred to me re­  
, lative to the c«se of a maddamut, is­  
•l by the circuit court t f the L  
&quot; States for the district ol South dro­  
, lir.a to compel the collector or the  
&#x27; port of Charleston to grant clearances  
to certain vessels.  
The first que; tion thai naturally pre­  
sents itself, is, whether the court pos­  
[ Kissed the power of issuing a manda­  
i mun in such a case ?  
v &#x27; A mandamus in England is s?yled a  
prerogative writ, and in that country  
jis awarded solely ai d exclusively by  
&#x27;. the court of King&#x27;s Bench.  
\\ The constitution and hrws of the  
j United States establish our judicial  
t system. To these we must refer in  
\ order to ascertain the &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27; of  
, the respec.ive courts, toe extent ofj  
j- their po.vcrs, and tne ilmits of their  
m j The M Act to establish the judicial  
&#x27; i court-, of the United States,&quot; |  
,■ on the 2Uh September, 1789, de­  
j i elates at. I ; the jurisdiction of  
•■ the several courts thereby created,  
} and among these I tion of the j  
i circuit cour&#x27;s. Upon a Careful and  
it will he found to  
gnte to the circuit court! no power  
I| to isaiie writs of mandamus. In the i  
i thirteenth section of that act this au­  
r I thority is expressly given to toe sti­  
ne court,of the United Stales. In  
, ! like manner it is specially provided by  
act of the 3d of February, 1801, \
( • that the supreme court shuM have j  
i power to issue writs of mandamus, j  
last act having been repeated and \
&#x27;. &#x27; the former revived, the question  
I ! rest on the true construction to be gi- j  
; ren to the original act.  
The eleventh section defines and j  
j limits the juiisdiction of the circuit j  
: i courts. It i i specially appropriated to I  
J tiiis single object. There are no cx-  
I pressions in this section which  
j fairly be interpreted to confer t.&#x27;  
thority of l railing writs of mandamus. |  
, Nor can the power be cither implied j  
j erred from any language it cam- |  
tains. It IS true, the proceeding by j  
mandamus in England is on the crown [  
J side, as it is termed, of the court of  
&#x27; King&#x27;s Bench. But it is a prosecution  
relative to a civil right to enforce it,  
I and to obtain prompt redress ; and nol  
!to punish cri: inally as in the case of  
■an offence. The provision therefore  
that the circuit courts &quot; shall have  
exclusive cognizance of a({ ciimesand  
offences cogniz ble under the authori­  
ty of the United States, except When  
the act otherwise provides, ilfc.&quot; can­  
; not warrant such a proceeding. Be­  
i the same act docs provide that  
i the supreme court shall issue writs of  
j mandamus—An authority given per  
because its jurisdiction extended  
all over the United States.  
The fourteenth section, immedi­  
ately succeeding that which gives this  
authority in plain and positive terms to  
j the supreme court, solely, if not ex-  
  
Iclusivcly, (and the affirmative frc- &lt;  
! quently, and in this case justly, I t  
j think implies a negative) contains the &lt;  
j following provision : &quot; All the before s  
1 mentioned courts of the U. States (in­  
! eluding the supreme, as well as the I  
j circuit and district courts) shall have &lt;  
I power to issue writs of scire facias,  
habeas corpus, and all other writs not 1  
specially provided for by statute,  
. which may be necessary for the ex­  
! ercise of their respective jurisdic­  
j lions.&quot; This clause cannot affect the  
&#x27; i case, I conceive. The mandamus is  
j a writ, which we have seen is speci­  
\ ally provided for by law. This sec­  
j tion was evidently not designed to give  
I any additional jurisdiction to either of  
. I the courts, but merely the means ol  
| executing that jurisdiction already  
i &#x27; granted to them respectively. The  
issuing of a mandamus in the case un­  
der consideration was an act of origi­  
i &#x27; rial jurisdiction. Precisely as much  
I so, as it would have been in the su­  
| pre me court, to have exercised the  
, power in the case of Marbury vs. Ma­  
. dison. In that case the supreme court  
I declared, that to issue a mandamus to !  
the Secretary of State, would be, to ;  
exercise an original jurisdiction, not ■  
! ! given by the constitution, and which  
, could not be granted by Congress, i  
The constitution having enumerated  
&#x27;or declared the particular cases in  
, which the supreme court should cx­  
. ercise, original jurisdiction, though  
i there were no negative expressions,  
. the affirmative they considered im­  
. plied them. It was on this principle  
I alone they refused to exert their au­  
l j thority.  
t \ The practice, I believe, has uni­  
foraily been, so far as I can trace it  
j from the books of reports, &#x27;hat have  
&#x27; been published, or from recollection  
and experience on the subject, to ap­  
p,y to the supreme court for a nurul.i­  
mus. This court it is true have deter­  
mined not to issue the writ, when it  
, would be an act of original jurisdic­  
. : tion. But thi &gt; I apprehend, can af­  
ford no ground for the circuit court&#x27;s  
&#x27; ; assuming an authority, which the su­  
, preme o declined, unless by  
j a It act the power be dele­  
. gated to them. This power is not  
necessarily incidental to  
of justice, even of g&lt;  
, jun . For in England but a  
singh; me of several Courts having  
, general jurisdiction, possesses tiie  
-ad v. Neither the chancery, the  
pleas, nor 11 ■ iuer,  
though classed among the kin  
and having general ju­  
im, can exer­  
this power. It is the peculiar  
i oi&#x27; the V  
Our civ vii courts b.ve merely a local  
, and subordinate jurisdiction. Their  
j analogies therefore with the four  
, j courts of England, having g&#x27;  
j superior jurisdiction, must be very  
. &#x27; weak, and still weaker their claim to  
j- the pre-eminent dis.inclion of the  
r ; king&#x27;s bench, which possesses solely  
r , the exclusive authority of issuing the  
! mandamus,  
j \ v these reasons I am induced to  
i j believe from the best consideration I  
. I have been enabled to give the subject, |  
c ! that tlte circuit court of South C  
|na had not authority to issue a gran­  
! j damns to the collector ol&quot; the port of  
I Charleston.  
. It is scarcely necessary to remark,  
j, that when a court has no jurisdiction,  
; even consent will not give it, and  
. much less will the mere tacit ar.qui­  
nce of a party, in not denying  
x their authority.  
Independent of this serious and &gt;  
conclusive objection to the pro  
! \ ing adopted by the court, there arc |  
\ others entitled to consideration. For |  
i I supposing the court did not err in the J  
i j exercise «&gt;f jurisdiction, and admit-;  
, j ting the British doctrines on the  
iect without restriction or limitation  
I | could be extended to this country,  
. j there are legal exceptions to the  
! course they have pursued, supported  
by English authority.  
In the first place, the law gave the  
| collector complete discretion over the  
j subject. According to the opinion he  
! might form, he possessed competent  
, | authority lo grant or refuse R ctear­  
. : Bfice. And I apprehend where the  
j law has left this discretion in an offi­  
■ &#x27; cer, the court, agreeably to tin  
lish practice and precedents, ought  
not to interpose, by way of manda­  
mus.  
Secondly. In this case there was a  
controling power in the Chief magis­  
trate of the United States. The •  
in fact, an express appei-.I given to the  
President by the very words of the act  
of Congress, which outhori-,es the  
collectors to detain vessels, &quot;imtiltitc  
derision of the President of the United  
States be had thereupon &quot; By the  
mandamus the reference to the Presi­  
dent, is taken away, and the collector  
&#x27; is commanded to clear the vessel with­  
out delay. Agreeably to the En  
authorities under such circumstances,  
it is not the course 1 believe to issue a  
mandamus.  
Thirdly. The parties it seems had  
  
their legal remedy against the cclfec*  
tor, and it is not usual, if r/.t unpre­  
cedented, to grant a mandamus in *uch  
a case.  
Fourthly. A mandamus is not ;3­  
sued to a mere ministerial officer to  
compel him to do his duty. The cotire  
will leave the parties to their remedy  
by action, or even by indictment. In  
England, in a very late ease, they de­  
cided that they would not grant a titan­  
damus to a ministerial officer, such as  
the treasurer of a county, for the pro­  
per remedy washy indictment.  
I am aware of a precedent in which  
it seems to be admitted that a mawta­  
mus may issue to the commissioners  
&#x27; of excise, to compel them in a proper  
1 case lo grant upermit. This case is  
more analogous to the one now before  
us than any other, I have been able, to  
discover, after a diligent research. But  
in this instance the point was not  
made, nor the question argued. Be­  
sides, the commissioners of cxci  
I England form aboard for superititeud­  
-1 ing the collection of that branch of  
! the revenue. They constitute in ma­  
!ny respects a court of inferior juris­  
-1 diction, which in particular cases  
I takes cognisance in a summary waj,  
!of offences against the e::ci;c laws. &#x27;  
| A mandamus might be granted to  
such a tribunal when it would not be  
issued to a mere ministerial officer,  
, acting under them in the collection of  
the revenue.  
It results from this view of the sub­  
.&#x27; ject that the mandamus issued by the  
, circuit coprt for the district of South  
Carolina, was not warranted by any  
| power vested in the circuit courts Ly  
statute ; nor by any power nccessa­  
. rily incident to courts, nor counte­  
nanced by any analogy between the  
, circuit courts and the court of kings­  
bench, the only court in that coon­  
try possessing the power of issuing  
such writs. And it further appears  
. that even the court of kings-bench*  
, for the reasons assigned! would not,  
agreeable to their practice and princi­  
. pies have interfered in the present  
case by mandamus.  
It might perhaps with propriety­  
be added th it there does not appear ir*  
the constitution of the United States  
\ my thing which favors an indefinite  
I extention of the jurisdiction of courts,  
L over the ministerial officer within  
. the executive department. On tho  
\ coot ry, the careful discrimination  
\ which is marked between the seve­  
ral departments, should dictate greoi  
\ circumspection tr&gt; each, in the exer­  
cise of powers having any relation v,  
the other.  
The courts are indubitably the source  
of regal redress for wrongs commit­  
j ted by ministerial officers, none of

, dress is to be admi htered by due  
■ and legal process in the ordinary  
For there appears to be a nia-  
I and an obvious i m be­  
, twee.&#x27;i a cou-se of proceeding, which  
\ redresses a wrong committed by an  
. executive officer, and an interposi­  
tion by a mandatory writ, taking the  
( i executive authority Out of the hands  
lof the President, and prescribing the  
; course, which he and the agents of  
&#x27; &#x27; any department must pursue. In one  
. &#x27; case the executive is left free to act  
p in his proper sphere, but is held to  
strict reponsibiliiy ; in the other  
all responsibility is taken _ away,  
&#x27; and he acts agreeably to judicial  
| mandate. Writs of this kind if made  
applicable to officers indiscriminately,  
. and acls purely ministerial, and cxc­  
&#x27; cutive in their nature, would neces-  
I sarily have the effect of trail s­  
, i ferring the powers vested in one  
[(department to another department.  
&#x27;, !If in a case like the present, where  
! the law vests a duly and a diserc­  
, | tion in an executive officer, a court  
Jean not only administer redress

&#x27;. tion perhaps defeated, which makps It

PETER PALLET.  
Richmond, July 29.  
We have been favoured with the lollowing aide let­  
ter I10111 the attorney general of the United State*.  
As It Serves to set the singular ruse at Charles­  
ton m its true rolouis, it rannot tail being acrep­  
table to (he rearitr. It is piesumed this letter has  
been circulated among the dilierent Colleetors 0!  
the United States. Enquirer,  
Sir,  
I have read and considered the papers and dorm  
ments referred to me relative to the ease of a man­  
damus, issued hy the circuit court of the United  
Mates for tin-district ot South Carolina to compel  
the collector ot the Hurt ol Charleston lu grant clear­  
ances to n rt,.in vessels.  
The tirst question that presents itself is, whether  
the court possessed the power ot issuing * mandamus  
in such a vase.  
A vinnilamut in England, is styled a- prerogative  
v. rit, and in that country is awarded solely and ex­  
clusively by the court of king&#x27;, bench.  
The constitution and laws of the United States es­  
tablish ourjndici.il system, io these we must reiei  
in order to ascertain the juiisdirttou «&gt;f the respec­  
tive courts, the extent ot then powers, and the h­  
mits ol tiieir authoritv.  
  
i . ^ i me nwju i.il marts of tht*  
United States,&quot; passed on ihe t&gt;itb Sept. l/8y, de­  
&lt; lares and detines the jurisdiction oi tlie several  
courts, thereby created, and among these the juris­  
diction til&#x27;the circuit courts. Upon a careful and at­  
tentive p&#x27; i usal it will &#x27; e found to delegate to tfie  
circuit courts no power to issue writs of mandamus* ]  
In the thii teenlh section of that art, this authority  
is expressly given to the supreme court uf the United  
States. In like manner it is specially provided by  
the act of the 3d nl February, 1801, that the su­  
preme rourt shall have power to issue writs oItsoti­  
damus. i hrs lust art having been repealed and the  
former revtved, the question must rest upon the true  
cons true lion to he given to tfie original act.  
Tileries nth section defines end limits the juris­  
diction of the ciri Hit courts. Il is specially appro­  
priated to tilts single object.—There are no expres­  
sions in this Sec lion which ran fully he interpreted  
to conler the anlhorily of issuing wnts of mandamus.  
Nor can the power he either implied orinferrd Irom  
or.y language rt contain*. It is true the proceeding  
hy mandamus m England is on the crown side, as it  
is termed, of the court of king’., bench. But ft is  
a prosecution relative to the civil right to enforce  
il, and to obtain prompt redress ; and not In punish  
criminally as in the rase of on offence. Tin* pro­  
vision therefore that the circuit courts “ shall have  
&quot; exclusive cognizance erf ail crimes and otfenres  
“ cognizable under the authority of the U. Sates,  
“ except h hen the act otherwise provides, 4-c.” cannot  
warrant such a proceeding. Besides the same act  
does provide that the supreme court shall issue  
wiilsof mandamus. An authority given perhaps,  
because its jurisdiction extends all over the United  
States.  
The fourteenth section, immediately succeeding  
that which gives this authority in plain and positive  
terms to the supreme court, solely, if not exclusive­  
ly, (and the affirmative frequently, and in this case  
iustfv, 1 think implies a negative,) contains the fol­  
low mg provision. “ All the before mentioned courts  
“ of the United Slates, (including the supreme, as  
“ well as the circuit and district courts) shall have  
“ power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus,  
“ and ill other writs not specially provided for by  
“ statute, which may be necessary for the exercise  
“ of their respective jurisdictions.” Thi3 clause  
cannot effect the case, I conceive. The mandamus  
is u writ, which we have seen is specially provided  
lor by law. 1 his section wus evidently not design­  
er! to give any additional jurisdiction to either of the  
courts, I,ut merely the means of executing that juris­  
diction already granted to them respectively._  
issuing of a mandamus in the Vase under consi­  
deration was an act cf original jurisdiction.—  
Precisely as much so, as it would have been in  
the supreme court, to have exercised the power m  
the case of Mai uurv vs. Aladisou. In that case the I  
  
stipretne ronrl declared, 4b*t to istue a mcmlmut to  
t &#x27;f secretary of state, would lie to exercise an ori­  
ginal jurisdiction, U»t given by tiie constitution  
•nd which could not be planted by congress—Th&gt;  
■&#x27;■institution having enumerated or declared the pai  
ticul.ir cases in which the supreme court should ex  
er&lt; ise original jurisdiction, though there were u.  
negative expressions, the affirmative they consider­  
ed implied them. It was on this principle alone  
they refused to exert their authority.  
The practice I believe, has uniformly been, so  
ar as I ran trace it from the books of reports, that  
have been published, or from recollection and expe­  
rienre on the subject, to apply to the supreme court  
for a mandamus. This court, it is true, have de­  
termined not to issue the wm ivhen.it would bean  
art of original jurisdiction. Bui this, I apprehend,  
Can afford no gronod for the circuit court’s assum­  
ing an authority, which the supreme conn have  
declined, unless by a legislative act the power be  
delegated to them. This power is not inherent nor  
necessarily incidtntal to a court of justice,even ol  
general jurisdiction. For in England, but a single  
one, of several courts having general jurisdiction,  
possesses the authority. Neither the chancery, the  
common pleas, nor the exchequer, though ,&#x27;lassed  
among the kings superiour courts, and having ge­  
neral jurisdiction «ver the realm, ran exercise tin,  
power, h is the pernliar privilege ol the king&#x27;s  
bench alone, Our circuit courts have merely ,, lo­  
rul and subordinate jurisdiction. Their analogies  
•therefore with the four courts of England, huvmg  
genera) and superiour jurisdiction, must he very  
weak, and still weaker their claim to the pre-emi­  
nent distinction of the king’s bench wbrch.|.nssess­  
cs solely the exclusive authority of issuing the mia.  
For these reasons l am induced to believe from  
the best consideration I have been enabled to give  
the subject, that the circuit court of South Carolr­  
na had not authority to issue a mat, damns to the col­  
lector ol the port of Charleston.  
h is scarcely necessary to remark, that when- a  
court has no jurisdiction, even consent will not „,r.  
  
it, and much less will the mere tacit acquiescence  
ol n party, in not denying it*,, authority.  
Independent of this serious and conclusive ohjec­  
l.on to the proceeding adopted by the court, then­  
are others entitled to consideration. For supposing  
the court did not err in the exercise of jurisdiction,  
and admitting the British doctrines on the subject  
without restriction or limitation could he extended  
to this country, there are legal exceptions to the  
course they have pursued, supported by English  
authority. °  
In the first phtcc, the law gave the collector com­  
plete discretion over the subject. According to the  
opinion he jnight Inrm. he possessed complete xu­  
thoruy to grant or refuse a clearance. And I gp.  
prebend where the law has left this discretion in an  
officer, the court, agreeably t„ the llmtsh practice  
i n ! precedents, ought not to interpose, by way of  
mandamus.  
2uly. In this case there was a&#x27; contronling power  
m the chief magistrate of the United Stales.—  
&gt; here was in fart, Hn express appeal given to the  
president l.y the very worusof the art of congress,  
which authorises the collectors to detain vessels,  
“ “‘J111 ll,r Vision of the president he had there­  
on. By the m/ndamus the reference to the presi­  
dent is taken away, and the collector is command­  
ed to clem the vessel without delay. Agreeably to  
the English authorities&#x27;under such rtrrumstances,  
it is not the course I believe to issue a mandamus.  
3dly. the parties it seems had their legal reme­  
dy against the collector, and it is not usual, if nnt  
unprecedented, to grant u mandamus in such a case.  
4thly. A mandamus is not issued to a mere mi­  
nisterial officer to compel huu to do his duty. The  
court will leave the parties to tlirir remedy by acti­  
on, or even by indictment. In England, in a very  
l ite rase, they derided thut they would grant a  
mandamus to a ministerial officer, such as the trea­  
surer of a county, lor the nrooer remedy whs ho  
  
indictment.  
I aui nwiii» of a precedent in which it seems tn  
be admitted that m mandamus may issue to the com­  
inissmners ot exrisr. to compel them in a proper  
rase to grant a permit. This case is more analogous  
to the one now before us than any other f have been  
able to discover, after a diligent research. But in  
this instance the point was not made, nor the ques­  
tion argued. Besides the commissioners of excise  
in England form a board tor superintending the col­  
lection of that branch ot the revenue; they con­  
stitute iu many respects a court of inferiour juris­  
diction, which in particular rases takes cognizance  
in a summary way, of otienres against the exrise  
laws. A man founts might be granted to such a tri­  
bunal, when it would not he issued to a mere minis­  
terial officer .acting under them in the collection of  
the revenue.  
It results from this view of the subject, that the  
mandamus issued by the circuit court for the ms  
tnrt ol South-Carolma, was not warranted by any  
power vested in the circuit courts by statute : nor  
by any power necessarily incident&#x27; To courts, nor  
countenanced by any analogy between the circuit  
courts, and the court of king’s bench, the only  
court* that country possessing the power of issu­  
ing Biicli writs. And it further appears that even  
the court ot king&#x27;s bench, for the reasons assigned,  
would not agreeably to their practice and principles  
have interfered in the’present case by mandamus.  
Tl might perhaps with propriety be added that  
there does not appear ui the constitution of the li­  
nked States any thing whieb favours an indefinite  
extension of the jurisdiction of courts over the im­  
material officer within the executive department._  
On the contrary, the careful discrimination which  
is marked between the several departments, should  
dictate great circumspection to each in the exercise  
of powers, having relation to the other.  
The courts are indubitably the source of legal re­  
drrss for wrongs committed hy ministerial officers,  
none of whom are above the law. This redress is  
to he administered hy due and legal process in the  
ordinary way. For there appears to be a material  
and an obvious distinction, between a coorse ol  
proceeding, which redresses u wrong committed hy  
an executive officer, and an interposition by a man­  
datory writ, taking the executive authority out of  
the hands ol the president, and prescribing the  
course, winch he and the agents of any department  
must pursue. In (he odd case the executive is lelt  
fro# to act in his proper splwre, but is held to strict  
lesponcibiliiy ; in the other all responsibility is ta­  
ken away, and he acts agreeable to judicial mandate.

Ui« (fieri of transferring thr pmytrscvniBrf-nr mw -

&gt; judicial power an executive function is neree«ariiy  
.ssuined and that part of the constitution perhaps  
defeated, which inukes it tha duty of the President  
lo lake care that the laws he faithfully executed  
I do not see any elear limitation to this doctrine  
which would prevent the courts from compelling by  
*“**&#x27; *,f U,e **«f utive officers^. all subordinate  
to the President atleast, whether charged with le­  
gal duties- in the treasury or other depaninr»{«, to­  
exerulc the same according to the opinion of the  
judiciary and contrary to that of the executive.  
And mi evident that the confusion arising will be  
greatly luerrased by the exercise of such a power  
by a number of separate courts of local jurisdiction  
whose proceedings would have complete and final  
effect,- without an opportunity of rontrnul lx the­  
supreiue court. So many branrhts of the judiciary  
“fling within their respective districts, their cour­  
ses might be different, ami Hifh-rent uiles nfartini*  
Bwgbt be presented for the citizens of the different  
- ates, instead of that unity of administration  
which the constitution meant to secure by plarine  
the executive power for them-all in the same heath  
What too becomes of the responsibility ,of the  
executive to the court of impearhmt tit, and to the  
nation ? Is he to remain responsible for arts done  
by command o! another department? Or is the na­  
tiun to lose the secaiity of that responsibly alto­  
gether ? From these and other considerations, were  
this branch of the subject to be pursued, it might  
be inferred, that the constitution of the United  
states, by the distribute of the powers of o0r go­  
vernment to the different departments, ascribing  
the executive duties to one, and the judiciary to t,­  
nother, ronirouls any principles of the Knclish law  
which would authorise either to enter into the dpart­  
mtmts of the other, to annul (lie powers of that  
other, and lt» assume the direction of its operations  
to itself. r  
  
ll.ese remarks are respectfully submitted to your  
consideration. They are made with due deference  
to the opinion of the court, with one of the

tion, over the&#x27; realm,can,cxercise this power.  
It issi-the peculiar ,privilege&#x27; of sithesi&#x27; king&#x27;s&quot;  
bench alone. Our circuit cqylftssi&#x27;have merc-si  
ly -a lssocal _ and subordinate&#x27;j&#x27;ufisdicfion.  
Their analogies therefore ct&#x27;Wss&#x27;lth ; the .four  
courts of England, having general and Supe­  
riorjurisdiction, must- be &quot;very weak, and  
still weaker their claim to the preacteminent  
distinction of the king&#x27;s bench, wh\ch- P03&#x27;  
sesses solely the exclusiye authorityssyf issu-f L  
  
  
  
  
  
ing the siniatidamus. &#x27;- &quot; ctssx. ,  
For these reasons lssssam induced to isseiieife  
from&#x27; the beSt coiisideisiation ] have&#x27;hesi :! en­  
abled sito-ss give &quot;the subject, that the circuit  
  
court of—South &#x27;aroiina had not &quot; aut rity­  
  
to issue a maiidamus to the colctlectpr. - the  
  
portOf Charleston. -  
lt is scarceh7 necessgry to remark, that  
when a court has no jurisdiction, even essþ&#x27;n­  
-sent will not give it, and musssseh less ivill&#x27;tsshe  
mere tacit acquiescence of &#x27;&quot;3&#x27;. party, in not  
denying their aurhority.ct . &#x27;­  
  
Indcpendent of this serious and conciusi&#x27;vesi  
  
Objection to the proceedings adopted by the  
court, there are others entitled to- considera­  
tion. For supposing the court- did not err  
in the exercise ofjurisdictio-n, ansid admitting  
the British doctrines on the subjectwithout  
restriction or limitation could be extended  
  
to this country, there are legal ct exceptions­  
  
to the course they have pursued, supported  
by English authority.  
in the first place, the law gave the coﬂect­  
or com lete discretion over the subject..—  
According to the opinion he might forn, he  
possessed competent authority to grait, or  
refuse :: clearance. And I apprehend where  
the law has left this discretion in an oficcr,  
the court agreeably to the British practice  
and precedensits, oughtonot to interpose, by  
way of mandamus. .  
Secondly. In this case there was tcon­  
trouling power inthe chief magistrate of the  
United States. There was in fact, en ex­  
press appeal given to the president By: the  
very words of the act of cOngrsi-ss, which  
ctauthorises the collectors to detain vesisels,  
&quot; until the decision of the president off the  
United Statessibe had thereupon.&quot; Bj the  
mandamus the referrence to the presidmt is  
tak en away, and the collector is ceinman&#x27;tted  
to clear the vessel without delay. - Agn-e&#x27;a­  
hly to the English authoriti-ss&#x27; under such  
Adfusiuhsitancp, it is .nntssIbP COQLBL­  
to issue a mandanms. &quot;  
T hirdly. T he&#x27;pssirtics- it seems had their  
legal remedy against the collector, and. it is  
not usual, if net unprecedented, to grant a  
mandamus in such a case.  
Fourthiy a mandamus is not. issued to a  
nicre ministerial officer to coctmpcl him to do  
hlS duty. .The court Wiii leave &quot;the parties  
  
te their remedy by action, or even by his  
(hctmcnt. ln England in a very late case,&quot;  
they decided that they would not grant a -  
  
mandamus to a ministeri&#x27;al officer, sueh-a&#x27;s  
  
the treasurer of the county, for the proper  
  
remedy Was by indictment. -.­  
I am aware of a precedent in which it  
Feems to be admitted that a mandamus may  
issue to the commissioners of cZiCise tO com­  
pel them in a proper czis&#x27;e to grant a permit.  
T his case is iriore analagous &quot;to the one no &quot;.v  
before us than anysiothcr l have been able  
to discover, after a diligent reseaxch. But  
in this instance the point was not made, {OF  
  
&#x27;3 I hEsssikuctn  
  
  
(

the question argued. Uesnles tnc cuuuuw- -  
sioners of excise in England form aboard  
for superintending the collection es ther  
branch of the revenue. T hey consuuȝtessn  
many respssects a court of inferior Jurzsdxe­  
tion, which in particular cases takes cogm­  
zance in a summmy way, of orknceg za­  
inst the cxcise laws. A mandamus mlgnt ss  
be granted to such a tribunal when it would  
not be issued to :: mere ministerial officer,  
acting under them in collection&#x27;ef the reve-J  
nue. &#x27;  
It resultz from this view of the subject  
that the mandamus issued by the circuit  
court for the district of S. Carolina, was  
not warranted by any powex vested in &quot;the  
circuit courts by statute : nor by any power  
necessarily incident to courts, nor counte- -  
nanced by any analogy between the circuit  
courts and the court of king&#x27;s bench, the —Z  
only cou&#x27;rt in that country&quot; possessing- the  
power of issuingsuch writs; And it further  
appears that even the court of king&#x27;s bench &#x27;  
for the reasons assigned, would not agreea­  
bly to their practice and principles ]]va in- __

nisterial officers,. nonei of &quot; whom are above

ctsiby dlie&#x27;nnd &quot;legal pr&#x27;osicess in&#x27; the &#x27; ordinary  
wiss. For there appears to be a- material  
an an obvious distinction,between a course  
of proceedingsswhich redresses-a wrong- ;  
committed by an executive officer, and an  
interpesitien by a mandatqry writ, taking  
the executive authority out of the hands of  
the president, and prescribing the course,  
which he and the agents of any department  
must pursue. ln one case the executive ig­  
left free to act in his proper sphere, but is  
held to- strict responsibility ; in the other all  
responsibility, is taken away, and he acts a­  
greeably to judicial mandate. VV-rits of this  
kind is mach applicable to officers indiscri­  
_minately, and acts purely ministerial, and  
  
  
execusitive in their nature, would necessaruy  
have the eﬀect of transferring the powers  
vested in one department to another depart­  
&quot;Inent. If in a case like the present, where  
  
the law vests &amp; duty and a discretion in an .  
  
executive officer,a court can not only admi­  
nister redress against the misuse of the au­  
thority, but can previouslydirect the use to  
be made of it, it would seem that underthe  
name of ajudicial pOwer, an executive fune­  
tion is necessarily assumed, and that part of  
the constitution perhaps defeated, which  
makesjt the. duty of the president to take  
care, that the laws be faithfully executed.  
I do not see any clear limitation to this doc­  
trine, which wouId prevent the courtsss-i&#x27;rom  
compelhng by mandamus all the executive  
officers, all suhordinate to the president at  
least, whether charged with legal duties in.  
the treasury or other department, to execute  
the same according to the Opinion of the ju­  
dicimsiy and contrary to that of the execu­  
tive. And it is evident that the confusion  
arising wil&#x27;c be gready increasedhy the exer­  
cise of such a power by a number of sepa­  
rate courts of local jurisdiction, whose pro­  
ceedings would have complete and final et}  
sect, Without an Opportunity of control by  
the,.supreme court. So many branches of  
thejucai-ziary, acting within their respective  
distriets, their courses might be diﬀerent,  
&#x27;and diﬀerent rules of action might be pre­  
scribed for the citizens of the diﬀerentstates,  
instead of that unity of adssmhctxistration which  
the conscitution meant to secure by placing  
the executivc power for them all in the same  
  
he ssi&#x27;ssi . 1]  
  
—­  
  
  
&#x27;vthsitss too becomes of the responsunuty or  
the execuu&#x27;v&#x27;e to the court of 1mp&#x27;ezcnmeuq  
and to the nation ;&quot; Is he to remain respon­  
si&#x27;zle {or acts done by command of anochctzr  
depurtment? Or is the nation to lose the  
security of that responsibility altogether ?—  
From these and other considerations, were  
this branch of the subject to be pursued, it  
might be inferred, that the constitution of  
the U. States, by the distribution oi&#x27; powcrs  
of our government to diﬀerent depurtmcnts  
ascribingthe exccutivc duties to one, and  
the jssudiciary to another, controls any prin­  
ciples&#x27;osthc English law, which would au­  
thorise either to enter into the dep-siutmcnt  
ofthe other, to annul the powcts ofthat o­  
ther, and to assume the direction of its-Oper—  
ations to itseif.  
, These remarks arc respectsully submitted  
to your consideration. T hey are to be  
made with (! :: deferrencc to the opinion of  
the court, With one of the judges constitut­  
ing Which, I am personaﬂy acquainted,  
and for whose character I feel the sincerest  
regard.

conceive. The&#x27; mahd&#x27;amus is a writ,; Which  
we have seenis: specially provided for by law. ,  
Tim section was evidently not &#x27; designed to  
give any additional jurisdictjon to either of

anDlvto the suDreme court for a. - mandamus  
  
This court it is true have determined not to  
issue the writ, when it would be tut act &#x27;cf  
original jurisdiction. But this I apprehend,  
can afford no ground for the circuit court&#x27;s  
assuming an authority, which the, supreme  
court have dedined,nmlessVy &quot;legislative  
act the power be delegated to them. This  
power is not inherent nor- necessarily,, inci­  
dental to a court of justice, even of general  
jurisdiction. For in England but a single  
one of several cnlrt having general juris  
  
diction, possesses the authority. -Neither .the  
  
xliancery, the crnnmon pleas, nor the exrhe­  
;quer, though classed among&#x27; the &#x27;kings -supe  
nudr courts, and haying general jurisriiction  
  
OveMhc realm, can &#x27;exercise this po&#x27;-ver. It  
is the peculiar, privilege of the king&#x27;s bench  
done. Our circuit courts have rimtrelv  
local arid &quot;subordinate .jinistliction. T&#x27;leir­  
analogies&quot; therefore with the &#x27;four courts of  
England, having general -arid Superior juris  
  
diction, must fee very Weak, and still weaker  
their claim, to the pre-eminent distinction of  
the king&#x27;s bench, which possesses &quot;solely the  
exclusive authority of issuing the mandamus  
-For these reasons I am induced to believe  
from the best consideration I have been ena­  
bled tn give- the subject, that the circuit court  
of S-outh Carolina had not authority to . issue  
a mandamus to the collector of. the port cf  
Charleston y, &#x27; . &#x27;  
&#x27;It is scarcely necessary to remark that  
whdn. a court has no jurisdiction, evenrm­  
$cnt will not s&#x27;lve it, and much less will the  
mere tacit acquiescercb of a party, in not de­  
nyinjj; their -authority&#x27;..-  
Independent of this &#x27; &quot;serious and. conclu­  
sive objection to the proceeflinq; adopted by  
the court there are others entitled to censi­  
der8tion..&#x27;:F6r.pposing the court did not,err  
in the-xercise. of juiidiction, and admitting

restriction or limitation could be extended ta  
this country there are legal exceptions to the  
course they have pursuedry supported by En-

In the first place the law gave the collect­  
ov.complete discretion over the subject. Ac­  
cording to .the opinion he might form, he pos­

has left this discretion Jn an officer, the court,  
agreeable tcTtfie British-practice and prece­  
dents, ought not to interpose, by way of man­

that the confusion arising will be greatly in­  
creased by the .exercise of such a powrr, by

that the supreme court shall issue

given, perhaps, because its autho  
rity extends &quot;alt over the &#x27;tjnited  
States,  
&#x27; The fourteenth section, imme­  
diately succcedingthatwhich rves  
this authority in plain and posuive  
terms to the supreme court, solely,  
if not exclusively (and the aSrma­  
tivc frequently, and iu- this case  
justly, I think implies a negative)  
contains the following provision.  
All the before mentioned courts  
44 of the United States (including  
the supreme, as well as the cir­  
u cuit and district courts) shall  
have power to issue writs of scire  
iciaSyhabeasccrpusndoMolhcr  
writs not specially provided for  
by statute, which may beneces-  
aary for the exercise of their res­  
44 pective jurisdictions.&quot; This  
clause cannoteffect the case I con­  
ceive. The tnandatnux is a writ,  
which we have seen is specialty  
provided for by law. This sec­  
tion was evidently not designed to  
give any additional jurisdiction to  
either of the courts, but merely the  
means of executing that jurisdic­  
tion already granted to them res  
pectively. The issuing of a mail&#x27;  
damus in the case under considt  
ration was an act of original juris­  
diction. Precisely as much so a3  
it would have been in the supreme j  
court, to have exercised the power  
in the case of Marbury vs. Madi­  
son. In that case the supreme  
court declared, thattoissuear7K?2­  
dunus to the Secretary cf State,  
would be to exercise an original  
jurisdiction, not given by the con­  
stitution and whiciVcouid not be  
granted by Congress The con­  
stitution having enumerated or de­  
clared the particuiarcases in which  
the supreme court should exercise  
original jurisdiction, though there  
were no negative expressions, the  
uflirmativethey consideredimplied  
them. It was on this print iple  
alone they refused it? exert their  
authority.  
The practice, I bciiive, has uni­  
formly been so far as I can trace  
it Irom the bocks of reports, that  
have been published, or from re­  
collcctiouor experience on the sub­  
ject, to apply to the supreme xrourt  
for a mandamus. This court, it 13  
irue, have determined not to issue  
the writ when it would be an act  
of original jurisdiction. But this.  
1 1 apprehend, cau ufiord no ground  
tor Uie Circuit cuuii &amp; cuuim aa  
authority, which the supreme court  
have declined, unless by a lcgisla-  
: tive act the ppwer be delegated to  
then. This power is not inherent  
I norr.cccssarilv incidental to a court  
. . r 1 r .l7  
of justice, even oi&quot; general juris  
diction. Jbor m Jbngland, but a  
single one of several courts having  
! general jurisdiction, possesses the  
authority. Pi cither the chancery,  
tne common piea.s, nor the exche­  
quer, though classed among the  
King&#x27;s superior courts, and hsving  
gencraJjurisdiction orcr the realm,  
can extr.i-c this power. It is the  
peculiar privilege of the King&#x27;s,  
bench alone. Our circuit courts  
have eietelv a lcai and subordi­  
nate jurisdiction. Their analo­  
gies therefore with the four courts  
of Eng!at.d, having general ana  
superior jurisdiction, must be ve­  
iy weak, and ocill weaker their  
claim to the pre-eminent distinc­  
tion r.f the King&#x27;s bench, which  
possesses solely tne exclusive au­  
thority of isiumg the mandamvt.-For  
these reasons I am induced  
to believe frd the best conside­  
rations I have been enhbled to  
give the subject that the circuit  
tourt of South-Carolina had not  
authority to issue a mandamus to  
the collector jaf the port ol Charles  
ton  
Itis scarcely necessary toremark  
that when a court has no iuris-  
diction, even consent will not give  
it, and much less will the mere ta­  
crt acquieaxenc of a party, ih not  
denying their authority.  
Independent of this serious and  
conclusive objection to the pro­  
ceeding edoptetl bythe court­  
there, are others entitled to consi­  
deration. For supposing the court  
did not err in tht; exercise of ju-  
rUdiction, and admitting the Bri-J

txceedijig twenty Lines, Inierfg

&#x27;tisli ctoetrines on te aiit Jecf itW  
out restriction or limitation could  
be extended, to this coWtry, there  
are legal excep tions to the course  
they have; pursued,&#x27; supported by  
&#x27;Eiiglish authority .  
In the &quot;first place, trie laiV&#x27;gave  
the collector .complete discretidn  
ever &quot; the subject. According to  
the opinion he might form, he pos­  
sessed competent authority to  
grant or refuse a clearance. And  
1 apprehend where the law has  
left this discretion in an officer,  
the court, agreeably to the British  
practice and precedents, ought not  
to&#x27;interpose, by way of mandtmus.  
Ediy. In this case there was a  
controuling power , in the Chief  
Magistrate of the United 3tates.  
There was, in fact, an express ap­  
peal given to the President by the  
very words of the act of Congress,  
which authorises collectors to de­  
tain vessels, u until the decision of  
the President be had thereupon.&#x27;1  
By the mandamus, the reference  
to the President is taken away, and  
the coUectoris commanded to clear  
the vessel without delay. Agreea­  
bly to the English authorities un­  
der such circumstancr s, it is not  
the couise, I believe, to issue a  
mandi mus  
3dly. The parties it seems had  
their legal remedy against the col­  
lector, and it is not usualf if not  
unprecedented, to grant a Jncnda  
mus in such a case.  
4&#x27;.hlv. A-mandamus is not issued  
to a mere ministeri j1 officerto com­  
pel him to do his duty. 1 he court  
will leave the patti.-s to their re­  
medy by action, or even by indict­  
ment, In England, in a very late  
case, they decided that they would  
not grant a mandamus to a ministe­  
rial officer, such as the treasurer  
of a county, for the proper remedy  
w:i3 by indictment.  
I am aware bf a precedent in  
which it seems to be admitted that  
a mandamus may issue to the ocm­  
missioners of excise, to compel  
them in a proper case to grant a  
permit. This cast is more analo  
goui to the one now before us than j  
any other, I have been able to dis­  
cover, after a diligent research  
But in this instance the point was  
not made, nor the question argued­  
Besides, the commissioners of ex­  
cise in England form a board for  
Euperintending the collection of  
that branch of the revenue ; they  
constitute in many respects a court  
of inferior jurisdiction, which in  
particular cases takes cognizance  
in a summary way, of offmces  
against the excise hw3. A man­  
damus tiiight b? granted to Mich a  
tribunal, when it would not be is­  
sued to a mere ministerial officer,  
acting underthem in the collection  
of the revenue.  
It results from this view of the  
subject, that the mandamus issued  
by the circuit tourt for the district  
of South-Carolina, was not war­  
ranted by any power vested in the  
circuit court by statute : nor by  
any power necessarily incident to1  
courts, nor countenanced by any j  
ana&#x27;ojrv between the circuit courts  
and the court of King&#x27;s bench, the  
only court in that country posses­  
sing the power of issuing such  
writs. Ami it further appears thai  
cvf.ii the caurt cf King&#x27;s benchvior  
the reasons assigned, would net,  
agreeably to their practice and  
principles, hive interfered in the  
present case by mandamus.  
It might perhaps with propriety  
be added, that there does not at  
pear in the constitution of ihe  
nited States any thing which fa­  
vors indefinite extension of the ju­  
risdiction of courts over the min­  
isterial officer within the executive  
department. On the contrary , the  
careful discrimination which is  
marked between the several de­  
partments, should dictate great  
circumspection to each in the ex­  
ercise of powers, having any rela­  
tion to the other.  
The courts are indubitably the  
source of legal redress for wrongs  
committed by ministerial officerH  
none of whom are above the law.  
This redress is to !c administered  
by due and legal process in the or  
dinary way. For there appears  
to be a material and an obvious  
distinction, between a course oi  
proceeding, vwhich redresses a  
wrong committed, by an, executive  
officers, and an interposition, by a  
mandatory writ, taking the execu­  
tive authority out of the hands of  
the President and prescribing the

any department must pursue, au  
the one case the Executive is left  
free to act in his proper sphere, but  
Xi held to strict rcsponsibiliry in  
the other, all responsibility: Is taken  
a way, and he actV agreeably to ju­  
dicial mandate.&#x27; VVrits of this kind  
if made applicable to officers indis-&quot;  
criminatcly, and acjts purely minis­  
terial, and executive in their na­  
ture, would necessarily have the.  
effect of transYerring powers vest­  
ed in one department &quot;to another  
department; If in a case; like the  
present, where the law, vests a du­  
ty and a discretion iri an executive  
olcer, a court cannot only admi­  
nister redress against the misuse  
of the authority but can previous­  
ly direct the use to be made of  
it, it would seem &#x27;that .under the  
name of a judicial power an exe­  
cutive functiofi is necessarily as­  
sumed and that part of the consti­  
tution perhaps defeated, which  
makes it the duty of the President  
to take care that the laws be faith  
fully executed. s I do not secsjiy  
clear limitation to this doctrine  
which would prevent the courts  
from compelling by mandamus all  
the executive officars, all subor­  
dinate to the President at least,  
whether charged with legal duties  
in the Trtasury or other depart­  
ments, to execute the same ac­  
cording to the opinion of the judi­  
ciary arid contrary to that of the  
executive. Aiid it is evident that  
the confusion arising will be great­  
ly increased by the exercise of such  
a power by a number of separate  
courts of local jurisdiction, vvhoat  
proceedings would have cofnpktc  
and final effect, without an oppor­  
tunity of -control, by the supreme  
court. So many branches cf the  
judiciary acting within their res­  
pective districts, their courses  
might be different, and different  
rules of action might be presented  
for tht citizens of the different  
states, instead of that unity of ad­  
ministration which the constitu­  
tion meant to secure by placing  
the executive power lor them ah  
in the same ht. ad.  
What too becomes of the res­  
ponsibility of the executive to the  
court cf impeachment, and to thr  
nation ? Id he to remain respqn­  
tible for acts dene by command ol  
another department ? Or is the  
nation to lose the security of that  
responsibility altogether ? From  
these and other considerations,  
were this branch cf the subject to  
he pursued, it might be inferred  
that the constitution of the United  
States, by the distribution ol the  
powers of our government to dif­  
ferent departments, ascribing the  
executive duties to one, and the  
judif iary to another, controls any  
urinciplesof the English law, which  
would authorise cither to enter in­  
to the departments of the other, to  
annul the powers of that other, and  
to assume the direction cf its ope­  
rations to itself.  
These remarks are respectfully  
submitted to, your consideration.  
They are macfe with due deference  
and re3pect to the opinion of the  
court,, with one of the judges con­  
stituting which, I am personally  
acquainted, and for whose characr

tary of the treasury had been issued, he concludes  
as follows:  
  
“It might perhaps with propriety be added, that  
there does not appear in the constitution of the  
United States any thing which favors an indefinite  
extension of the jurisdiction of courts over the ii-  
nisterial officers within the executive department.  
On the contrary, the careful discrimination which  
is marked between the several departments, should  
dictate great cireumspection to each, in the exer-  
cise of powers having any relation to the other.  
  
“The courts are indubitably the source of legal  
redress for wrongs committed by ministerial of-  
ficers, none of whom are above the law. The re-  
dress is to be administered by due and legal process  
in the ordinary way. For there appears to be a  
material and obvious distinction between a course  
of proceeding which redresses a wrong committed  
by an executive officer, and an interposition by a  
mandatory writ, taking the executive authority out  
  
o  
  
of the hands of the president, and prescribing the  
  
The tone and language of this passage may be} course which he and the agents of any department  
regretted; but it shows very plainly, when taken in| must pursue. In one case, the executive is left  
connection with the vpinion, the real point on| free to act in his proper sphere, but it is held to  
  
strict responsibility; in the other, all responsibility  
is taken away, and he acts agreeably to judicial  
mandate. Writs of this kind, if made applicable to  
officers indiscriminately, and acts purely ministeri-  
al and executive in their nature, would necessarily  
have the effect of transferring the powers vested in  
one department to another department. If, in a  
case like the present, where the law vests a duty  
and a discretion in an executive officer, a court can-  
not only administer redress against the misuse of  
the authority, but previously direct the use to be  
made of it, it would seem that under the name ofa  
judicial power, an executive function is necessarily  
assumed, and that part of the constitution perhaps  
defeated, which makes it the duty of the president  
to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.  
I do not see any clear limitation to this doctrine,  
which would prevent the courts from compelling  
by mandamus all the executive officers, all subordi-  
nate to the president, at least, whether charged  
with legal duties in the treasury or other depart-  
ment, to execute the same, according to the opi-  
nion of the judiciary, and contrary to that of the  
executive. And it is evident, that the confusion  
arising will be greatly increased by the exercise of  
such a power, by a number of separate courts of le-  
gal jurisdiction, whose proceedings would have  
complete and final effect, without an opportunity of  
control by the supreme court. So many branghes of  
the judiciary, acting within their respective districts,  
their courses might be different; and diiferent rules  
of action might be prescribed for the citizens of dif-  
ferent states, instead of that unity of administration  
which the constitution meant to secure, by placing  
the executive power for them all in the same head.  
  
“What too becomes of the responsibility of the  
executive to the court of impeachment and of the  
nation? Is he to remain responsible for acts done  
by command of another department? or is the na-  
tion to lose the security of that responsility altoge-  
ther? From these and other considerations were this  
branch of the subject to be pursued, it might be in-  
ferred, that the constitution of the United States, by  
the distribution of the powers of our government to  
different departments, ascribing the executive du
