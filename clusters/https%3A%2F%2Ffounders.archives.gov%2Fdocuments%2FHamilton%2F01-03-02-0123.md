Philadelphia] December 16, 1782  
The Committee to whom was referred the letter from The Honorable William Bradford Esquire speaker of the lower house of Assembly of the state of Rhode Island containing under three heads the reasons of that state for refusing their compliance with the recommendation of Congress for a duty on imports and prize goods, after having maturely considered the same beg leave to report.  
  
That your Committee flatter themselves the State on a reconsideration of the objections they have offered, with a candid attention to the arguments which stand in opposition to them, will be induced to retract their dissent, convinced that the measure is supported on the most solid grounds of equal justice, policy and general utility. The following observations contrasted with each head of the objections successively will furnish a satisfactory answer to the whole.  
First objection  
“That the proposed duty would be unequal in its operation, bearing hardest upon the most commercial states, and so would press peculiarly hard upon that state, which draws its chief support from Commerce.”  
The most common experience joined to the concurrent opinions of the ablest commercial and political observers have established, beyond controversy, this general principle, “That every duty on imports is incorporated with the price of the commodity and ultimately paid by the consumer; with a profit on the duty itself, as a compensation to the Merchant for the advance of his money.”  
The Merchant considers the duty demanded by the state on the imported article in the same light with freight or any similar charge, and adding it to the original cost, calculates his profit on the aggregate sum. It may happen, that at particular conjuctures where the markets are overstocked and there is a competition among the sellers, this may not be practicable, but in the general course of trade the demand for consumption preponderates, and the Merchant can with ease indemnify himself and even obtain a profit on the advance. As a consumer he pays his share of the duty, but it is no further a burthen upon him.  
The consequence of the principle laid down is that every class of the community bears its share of the duty in proportion to its consumption; which last is regulated by the comparitive wealth of the respective classes in conjunction with their habits of expence or frugality. The rich and luxurious pay in proportion to their riches and luxury, the poor and parsimonious in proportion to their poverty and parsimony.  
A chief excellence of this mode of revenue is, that it preserves a just measure to the abilities of individuals, promotes frugality and taxes extravagance.  
  
The same reasoning in our situation applies to the intercourse between two states. If one imports and the other does not, the latter must be supplied by the former. The duty being transferred to the price of the commodity is no more a charge on the importing state for what is consumed in the other, than it is a charge on the Merchant for what is consumed by the farmer or artificer. Either state will only feel the burthen in a ratio to its consumption, and this will be in a ratio to its population and wealth. What happens between the different classes of the same community internally happens between the two states; and as the Merchant in the first case, so far from losing the duty himself has a profit on the money he advances for that purpose, so the importing state which in the second case is the Merchant with respect to the other is not only reimbursed by the non-importing state but has a like benefit on the duty advanced.  
It is therefore the reverse of a just position that the duty proposed will bear hardest on the most commercial states. It will, if any thing, have a contrary effect, though not in a sufficient degree to justify an objection on the part of the non importing states; for it is as reasonable they should allow an advance on the duty paid as on the first cost, freight or any incidental charge. They have also other advantages in the measure fully equivalent to this disadvantage. Over-nice and minute calculations in matters of this nature are inconsistent with national measures, and in the imperfect state of human affairs would stagnate all the operations of government. Absolute equality is not to be attained; to aim at it is pursuing a shadow at the expence of the substance, and in the event we should find ourselves wider of the mark, than if in the first instance we were content to approach it with moderation.  
Second objection  
“That the recommendation proposes to introduce into that and the other states, officers unknown and unaccountable to them, and so is against the constitution of the state”  
It is not to be presumed that the constitution of any state could mean to define and fix the precise numbers and descriptions of all officers to be permitted in the state, excluding the creation of any new ones, whatever might be the necessity derived from that variety of circumstances, incidental to all political institutions. The Legislature must always have a discretionary power of appointing officers, not expressly known to the constitution, and this power will include that of authorising the Fœderal government to make the appointments in cases where the general welfare may require it. The denial of this would prove too much; to wit, that the power given by the confederation to Congress to appoint all officers in the post-office was illegal and unconstitutional.  
The doctrine advanced by Rhode Island would perhaps prove also that the Fœderal government ought to have the appointment of no internal officers whatever, a position that would defeat all the provisions of the Confederation and all the purposes of the union. The truth is that no Fœderal constitution can exist without powers, that in their exercise affect the internal police of the component members. It is equally true that no government can exist without a right to appoint officers for those purposes which proceed from and concenter in itself; and therefore the confederation has expressly declared that Congress shall have authority to appoint all such “civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of The United States under their direction.” All that can be required is that the Fœderal government confine its appointments to such as it is empowered to make by the original act of union, or by the subsequent consent of the parties. Unless there should be express words of exclusion in the constitution of a state, there can be no reason to doubt, that it is within the compass of legislative discretion to communicate that authority.  
The propriety of doing it upon the present occasion is founded on substantial reasons.  
The measure proposed is a measure of necessity. Repeated experiments have shown that the revenue to be raised within these states is altogether inadequate to the public wants. The deficiency can only be supplied by loans. Our applications to the foreign powers on whose friendship we depend have had a success far short of our necessities. The next resource is to borrow from individuals. These will neither be actuated by generosity nor reasons of state. ’Tis to their interest alone we must appeal. To conciliate this we must not only stipulate a proper compensation for what they lend, but we must give security for the performance. We must pledge an ascertained fund, simple and productive in its nature, general in its principle and at the disposal of a single will. There can be little confidence in a security under the constant revisal of thirteen different deliberatives. It must once for all be defined and established on the faith of the states solemnly pledged to each other and not revocable by either without a breach of the general compact.  
’Tis by such expedients that nations, whose resources are understood, whose reputations and governments are erected on the foundation of ages, are enabled to obtain a solid and extensive credit. Would it be reasonable in us to hope for more easy terms who have so recently assumed our rank among the nations? Is it not to be expected, that individuals will be cautious in lending their money to a people in our circumstances, and that they will at least require the best security we can give?  
We have an enemy vigilant, intriguing, well acquainted with our defects and embarrassments. We may expect that he will make every effort to instill diffidences into individuals, and in the present posture of our internal affairs he will have too plausible ground on which to tread. Our necessities have obliged us to embrace measures with respect to our public credit, calculated to inspire distrust. The prepossessions on this article must naturally be against us, and it is therefore indispensable we should endeavour to remove them, by such means as will be the most obvious and striking.  
It was with these views Congress determined on a general fund; and the one they have recommended must upon a thorough examination appear to have fewer inconveniences than any other.  
It has been remarked as an essential part of the plan, that the fund should depend on a single will. This will not be the case unless the collection as well as the appropriation is under the controul of The United States; for it is evident, that after the duty is agreed upon it may in a great measure be defeated by an ineffectual mode of levying it. The United States have a common interest in an uniform and equally energetic collection; and not only policy but justice to all the parts of the Union designates the utility of lodging the power of making it where the interest is common. Without this it might in reality operate as a very unequal tax.  
Third objection  
“That by granting to Congress a power to collect monies from the commerce of these states indefinitely as to time and quantity and for the expenditure of which they are not to be accountable to the states, they would become independent of their constituents, and so the proposed impost is repugnant to the liberty of the United States”  
Admitting the principle of this objection to be true, still it ought to have no weight in the present case because there is no analogy between the principle and the fact.  
First, the fund proposed is sufficiently definite as to time because it is only coextensive with the existence of the debt contracted and to be contracted in the course of the war. Congress are persuaded that it is as remote from the intention of their constituents to perpetuate that debt as to extinguish it at once by a faithless neglect of providing the means to fulfil the public engagements. Their ability to discharge it in a moderate time can as little be doubted as their inclination, and the moment that debt ceases the duty so far as respects the present provision ceases with it.  
The resolution recommending the duty specifies the object of it to be the discharge of the Principal &amp; Interest of the Debts already contracted or which may be contracted on the faith of the united States for supporting the present war.  
Secondly.  
The rate per Cent is fixed, and it is not at the option of the United States to increase it. Though the product will vary according to the variations in trade, yet as there is this limitation of the rate, it cannot be properly said to be indefinite as to quantity.  
By the confederation Congress have an absolute discretion in determining the quantum of revenue requisite for the national expenditure. When this is done nothing remains for the states separately but the mode of raising. No state can dispute the obligation to pay the sum demanded without a breach of the confederation, and when the money comes into the treasury, the appropriation is the exclusive province of the Fœderal government. This provision of the confederation (without which it would be an empty form) comprehends in it, the principle in its fullest latitude, which the objection under consideration treats as repugnant to the liberty of the United States; to wit an indefinite power of prescribing the quantity of money to be raised and of appropriating it when raised.  
If it be said that the states individually having the collection in their own hands may refuse a compliance with exorbitant demands, the confederation will answer that this is a point of which they have no constitutional liberty to judge. Such a refusal would be an exertion of power not of right, and the same power which could disregard a requisition made on the authority of the confederation might at any time arrest the collection of the duty.  
The same kind of responsibility which exists with respect to the expenditure of the money furnished in the forms hitherto practiced would be equally applicable to the revenue from the imports.  
The truth is the security intended to the general liberty in the confederation consists in the frequent election and in the rotation of the members of Congress, by which there is a constant and an effectual check upon them. This is the security which the people in every state enjoy against the usurpations of their internal governments; and it is the true source of security in a representative republic. The government so constituted ought to have the means necessary to answer the end of its institution. By weakening its hands too much it may be rendered incapable of providing for the interior harmony or the exterior defence of the state.  
The measure in question if not within the letter is within the spirit of the confederation. Congress by that are empowered to borrow money for the use of the United States, and by implication to concert the means necessary to accomplish the end. But without insisting upon this argument, if the confederation has not made proper provision for the exigencies of the state, it will be at all times the duty of Congress to suggest further provisions; and when their proposals are submitted to the unanimous consent of the States, they can never be charged with exceeding the bounds of their trust. Such a consent is the basis and sanction of the confederation, which expressly in the 13th. article empowers Congress to agree to and propose such additional provisions.  
The remarks hitherto made have had referrence principally to the future prosecution of the war. There still remains an interesting light in which the subject ought to be viewed.  
The United States have already contracted a debt in Europe and in this country for which their faith is pledged. The capital of this debt can only be discharged by degrees; but a fund for this purpose and for paying the interest annually on every principle of policy and justice ought to be provided. The omission will be the deepest ingratitude and cruelty to a large number of meritorious individuals, who in the most critical periods of the war have adventured their fortunes in support of our independence. It would stamp the national character with indelible disgrace.  
An annual provision for the purpose will be too precarious. If its continuance and application were certain it would not afford complete relief. With many the regular payment of interest by occasional grants would suffice; but with many more it would not. These want the use of the principal itself; and they have a right to it: but since it is not in our power to pay off the principal, the next expedient is to fund the debt and render the evidences of it negotiable.  
Besides the advantage to individuals from this arrangement, the active stock of the nation would be increased by the whole amount of the domestic debt, and of course the abilities of the community to contribute to the public wants. The national credit would revive and stand hereafter on a secure basis.  
This was another object of the proposed duty.  
If it be conceded that a similar fund is necessary it can hardly be disputed that the one recommended is the most eligible. It has been already shown that it affects all parts of the community in proportion to their consumption; and has therefore the best pretensions to equality. It is the most agreeable tax to the people that can be imposed, because it is paid insensibly and seems to be voluntary.  
It may perhaps be imagined that it is unfavourable to commerce; but the contrary can easily be demonstrated. It has been seen that it does not diminish the profit of the Merchant and of course can be no diminution of his inducements to trade. It is too moderate in its amount to discourage the consumption of imported goods, and cannot on that account abrige the extent of importations. If it even had this effect it would be an advantage to Commerce by lessening the proportion of our imports to our exports and inclining the ballance in favour of this country.  
The principal thing to be consulted for the advancement of Commerce is to promote exports. All impediments to these either by way of prohibition or by increasing the prices of native commodities, descreasing by that mean their sale and consumption at foreign markets are injurious. Duties on exports have this operation. For the same reason taxes on possessions and the articles of our own growth or manufacture, whether in the form of a land tax excise or any other are more hurtful to trade than import duties. The tendency of all such taxes is to increase the prices of those articles which are the objects of exportation and to enable others to undersell us abroad. The farmer if he pays a heavy land tax must endeavour to get more for the products of his farm: the mechanic and labourer if they find the necessaries of life grow dearer by an excise must endeavour to exact higher wages; and these causes will produce an increase of prices within and operate against foreign commerce.  
It is not however to be inferred that the whole revenue ought to be drawn from imports: All extremes are to be rejected. The chief thing to be attended to is that the weight of the taxes fall not too heavily in the first instance upon particular parts of the community. A judicious distribution to all kinds of taxable property is a first principle in taxation. The tendency of these observations is only to show that taxes on possessions, on articles of our own growth and manufacture are more prejudicial to trade than duties on imports.  
The observations which conclude the letter on which these remarks are made naturally lead to reflect⟨ions⟩ that deserve the serious attention of every member of the union. There is a happy mean between too much confidence and excessive jealousy in which the health and prosperity of a state consist. Either extreme is a dangerous vice; the first is a temptation to men in power to arrogate more than they have a right to—the latter enervates government, prevents system in the administration defeats the most salutary measures; breeds confusion in the state, disgusts and discontents among the people and may eventually prove as fatal to liberty as the opposite temper.  
It is certainly pernicious to leave any government in a situation of responsibility, disproportioned to its power.  
The conduct of the war is intrusted to Congress and the public expectation turned upon them without any competent means at their command to satisfy the important trust. After the most full and solemn deliberation under a collective view of all the public difficulties, they recommend a measure, which appears to them the corner stone of the public safety: They see this measure suspended for near two years—partially complied with by some of the states, rejected by one of them and in danger on that account to be frustrated; the public embarrassments every day increasing, the dissatisfaction of the army growing more serious, the other creditors of the public clamouring for justice, both irritated by the delay of measures for their present relief or future security, the hopes of our enemies encouraged to protract the war, the zeal of our friends depressed by an appearance of remissness and want of exertion on our part, Congress harrassed, the national character suffering and the national safety at the mercy of events.  
This state of things cannot but be extremely painful to Congress and appear to your Committee to make it their duty to be urgent to obviate the evils with which it is pregnant.  
Resolved that Congress agree to the said Report  
Whereas it is essential to justice and to the preservation of public credit that whenever a nation is obliged by the exigencies of public affairs to contract a debt, proper funds should be established not only for paying the annual value or interest of the same but for discharging the principal within a reasonable period, by which a nation may avoid the evils of an excessive accumulation of debt—Therefore  
Resolved, that whenever the Neat product of any funds recommended by Congress and granted by the states for funding the debt already contracted or for procuring future loans for the support of the war shall exceed the sum requisite for paying the interest of the whole amount of the national debt which these states may owe at the termination of the present war, the surplus of such grants shall form a sinking fund to be inviolably appropriated to the payment of the principal of the said debt and shall on no account be diverted to any other purpose. And in Order that the several States may have proper information of the state of their finance it is further resolved that as soon as the publick debt can be liquidated each State be annually furnished with the amount thereof &amp; the interest thereon and also of the proceeds and disposition of the sd. funds for the redemption thereof.  
Resolved that the faith of the United States be pledged for the observance of the foregoing resolution, and that if any state shall think it necessary to make it a condition of their grants the same will be considered by Congress as consistent with their Resolution of the 3d Febry 1781

The meaſure propoſed is a meaſure of neceſſity. Res  
peated experiments have ſhewn, that the revenue to be  
raiſed den theſe : tates is altogether inadequate to the  
  
ublic wants, The deficiency can only be ſupplied by  
loans. Our application to the foreign powers, on whoſe  
  
friendſhip we depend, have had a ſucceſs far ſhort of  
  
our neceſſities. The next reſource is to borrow from  
individuals. Theſe will neither be actuated by genero-  
ſity nor reaſons of State. Tis to their intereſt alone we  
muſt appeal. To coneiliate this, we muſt not only ſtipu-  
lats a proper e&gt;mpenſation for what they lend, but we  
muſt give ſecurity for the performance. We muſt  
pledge an aſcertained fund; fimple and productive in its  
nature ; general in its priaciple, and at the diſpoſal of A  
fingle will. There can be little confidence in a ſecuri-  
ty under the conſtant reviſal of thirteen different delibe-  
ratives. It muſt, once for all, be defined and eſtabliſhed  
on the faith of the States ſolemnly pledged to each other  
and not revocable by any without a breach of the ge-  
neral compact.  
  
&#x27;Tis by ſuch expedients that nations, whoſe reſources  
are underſtood, whoſe reputations and governments are  
erectod on the f undation of ages, are enabled to obtain  
a ſolid and ex enfive credit. Would it be reaſonable  
in us to hope for more eaſy terms, who have ſo re-  
cently ff. med our rank among the nations P Is it not to  
de expected, that individuals will be cautious in lending  
their money to a people in our circumſtances, and that  
&#x27; they will at leaſt require the beſt ſecurity we can give Þ  
  
We have an enemy vigilant, intriguing, we l acquaint  
ed with our defects and embarraſſments. We may ex-  
pect that he will make every effort to inſtil diffidenees into  
individuals, and in the preſent poſture of our inter-  
nal affairs, he will have two plauſible grounds on which  
to tread, Our neceſſities have obliged us to embrace  
meaſures with reipe to our public credit, calculated te  
inſpire diftruſt, The prepoſſeſlions on this article muſt

By the confederation, Congreſs have an abſolute dif-  
gretiun in determining the quantum of revenue requiſite  
for the national expenditure, When this is done, no-  
thing remains for the States, ſeparately, but the mode of  
raifing. No State can diſpute he obligation to pay the  
ſum demanded without a breach of the confederation 3  
and when the money comes into the treaſury the appro-  
priation is the exclufive province of the foederal govern-  
ment, This proviton of the confederation (without  
which it would be an empty form) comprehends in it the  
principle in its fulleſt latitude, which the objection un-  
der conſideration - treats as_ repugnant to the liberty  
of the United States, to wit, an indefinitivepower of pre-  
ſcrib:ng the quantity of money to be raiſed, and of ap-  
propriating it when raiſed, |  
  
If it be faid that the States individually, having the  
collection in their own hands, may refuſe a compliance  
with exorbitant demands, the confederation will anſwer,  
that this is a point of which they have no conſtitutional  
liberty to judge. Such a refuſal would be an exertion  
of power not of right, and the ſame power which could  
diſregard a requiſition made on the authority of the confe-  
deration, might at any time arreſt the collection of the duty.  
  
The ſame kind of reſponſibility which exiſts with ro-  
2 to the expenditure of the money furniſhed in the  
  
orms hitherto prictiſed, would be equally applicable to  
the revenue from the imports, |  
  
The truth is, the ſecurity intended to the general liber-  
ty in the confederation, conſiſts in the frequent eleGion,  
and in the rotation of the members ofCongreſs, by which  
there is a conſtant and an effectual check upon them. This  
is the ſecurity which the people in every ſtate enjoy a-  
gainſt the 1ſurpations of their internal governments; and  
it is the true ſource of ſecurity in a repreſentative repub-  
lic. The government, {o conſtituted, ought to have the  
means neceſſary to aniwer the end of its inſtitution, By  
weakening its hands too much it may be rendered incz-  
Pable of providing for the interior harmony, or-the ex-  
terior defence of the ſtate. ;  
  
The meaſure in queſtion, if not within the letter, is  
within the ſpirit of the confederation. Congreſs, by that, &#x27;  
— empowered to borrow money for the uſe of the United  
States, and by implication, to concert thy means neceffa-  
  
2  
  
k 1  
  
xy to accompliſh the end. But without infifting upon  
this argument, if the confederation has not made proper  
proviſion for the exigencies of the ſtates, it will be at all  
times the duty of Congreſs to ſuggeſt further provifions ;  
and when their propoſals are ſubmitted to the unanimous  
conſent of the ſtates, they can never be charged with exe  
 Ceeding the bounds of th-ir truſt. Such a co::ſdat is the  
bafis and ſanction of the confederation, which expreſsly,  
In the 13th article, empowers Congreſs to agres to and  
ropoſe ſuch additional-provifion. _  
  
he remarks hitherto made, have had reference prin-  
Eipally to the future proſecution of the war. There ftill  
  
  
to be viewed,  
  
  
Europe, and in this country, for which their faith is  
ledgod. The capital of this debt can only be diſcharged  
  
t degrees; but a fund for this purpoſe, and for payin  
  
the intereſt annually, on every principle of policy an  
  
  
deepeſt ingratitude and cruelty to a large number of  
meritorious individuals, who, in the moſt critical periods  
of the war, have adventured their fortunes in ſupport of  
  
our independence. It would ſtamp the national charac-  
ter with indelible diſp race. h  
  
An annual proviſion for the purpoſe will be too precae  
vious. If its continuance and application were certain  
  
  
gular pa; ment of intereſt, by occaſional grants, would  
Juffice ; but with many more it would not. Theſe want  
the uſe of the principal itſelf, and they havs a right to  
it; but fince it is not in our power to pay off the princi-  
pal, the next expedient is to fund the debt and render  
the evidences of 1t negotiable, 1 ;  
  
Beſides the advantage to individuals from this arrange»  
ment, the active ſtock of the nation would be increaſed  
by the whole amount of the domeſtic debt, and of courſe  
the abilities of the community to contribute to the pub-  
lic wants, The national credit would revive and ftand  
hereafter on a ſecure baſis, 1 8  
  
This was another object of the propoſed duty.  
  
If it be conceded that a fimilar fund is noce ſſary, it  
can hardly be diſputed that the one recommended is the  
  
moſt olitzible. I; bas been already ſhown that it affeRQs

all parts of the community, in proportion to their con-  
ſumption, and has therefore the beft pretonſionto equalie.  
ty. It is the moſt agreeable tax to the people that can be  
impoſed, becauſe it is paid inſenſibly and ſfeerns to be  
Vo untary. 5 5  
  
It may perhaps be imagined that it is unfavourable ta  
  
  
It has been ſeen that it do s not diminiſh the profit of the  
merchant, and of courſe can be no ciminution of his in-  
ducements to trade, It is too moderate in its amount te  
  
diſcourage the conſumption of imported goods, and cam»  
not on that account abridge the extent of importations,  
If it even had this effect it would be an advantage ts  
commerce by leſſening the proportion of our imports to  
  
  
country. |  
The principal thing to be conſulted for the advances  
  
  
ments to theſe, either by way of prohibition or by ene.  
creaſing the prices of native commodities, decreafing by  
that means their {ale and conſumption at foreign markets,  
are irjurious. Duties on exports have this operation.  
For the ſame reaſons, taxes on poſſe ſſions and the articles  
of our own growth or — whether in the form  
of a land tax, exciſe, or any other, are more hurtful te  
trade than impoſt duties. The tendency of all ſuch taxes is te  
enoreaſe the prices of thoſe articles which are the objeRg  
of exportation, and to enable others to under-ſell us  
abroad. The farmer, if he pays a heavy land tax, muſt  
endeavour to get more for the products of his fa m: the  
mechanic and labourer, if they find the nect ſſaries of lite  
grow dearer by an exciſe, muſt endeavour to exact high-  
er Wages : and theſe cauſes will produce an encreaſe of  
prices v.ithin, and operate againſt foreign commerce.  
  
It is not, however, to be inferred, that the whole re-  
venus ought to be drawn from imports : all extremes are  
to be rejected. The chief thing to be attended to is that  
the weight of the taxes fall not too heavily in the firſt in.  
ſtance upon particular parts of the community. A judicie  
ous diſtribution to all kinds of taxable property, is a fiſt  
principle in taxation. The tendency of theſe obſerva»  
  
of our own growth and manufaQure, are more prejudicial  
  
d trads than duties on imports,

The obſervations which conclude the letter on which  
theſe remarks are made, naturally lead to refleQtions that  
deſerve the ſerious attention of every member of the uni.  
on. There is a happy mean between too much confidence  
and exceffive jealouſy, in which the health and proſperity  
of a ftate conſiſt. Either extreme is a dangerous vice;  
the firſt is a temptation to men in power to arrogate more  
than they have a right to—the latter enervates govern-  
ment, prevents ſyſtem in the adminiſtrations, defeats the  
moſt ſalutary:meaſures, breeds confuſion in the Rate, diſ-  
guſts and diſcontents among the people, and may even-  
tually prove as fatal to liberty as the oppoſite temper.  
  
It is certainly pernicious to leave any government in a  
fituation of reſponſibility diſproportioned to its power.  
  
The conduct of the war is intruſted to Congreſs, and  
the public expeRation turned upon them without any  
competent means at their command to ſatisfy the impor.  
tant truſt, After the moſt full and ſolemn deliberation,  
under a collective view, of all the public difficulties, they  
recommend a meaſure which appears to them the corner  
Rone of the public ſafety: they ſee this meaſure ſuſpend-  
ed for near two years—partially complied with by ſome  
of the ſtates, rejected by one of them, and in danger on  
that account to be fruſtrated ; the public embarraſſment:  
every day encreaſing, the diſſatisfaction of the army grow-  
ing more ſerious, the other creditors of the public cla-  
moring for juſtice ; both irritated by the delay of mea-  
ſures for their preſent relief or future ſecurity, the hopes  
of our enemies eneouraged to protraQ the war, the zeal of  
our friends depreſſed by an appearance of rremiſſneſs  
and want of exertion on our part, Congreſs harraſſed, the  
  
national character ſuffering and the national ſafety at the  
mercy of events. |  
  
This Rate of things cannot but be extremely painful  
to Congreſs, and appear to your committee to make it

By the UNITED STATES in CONGRESS, aſſem

WHEREAS it is eſſential to juſtice and to the pre-  
ſervatien of public credit, that whenever a nation is  
obliged by the exigencies of public affairs to contract  
a debt, proper funds ſhould be eſtabliſhed, not only for  
paying the annual value or intereſt of the ſame, but for  
diſcharging the principal within a reaſonable period;  
by which a nation may avoid the eyils of an exceſſiv e  
accumulation of.debt : theretore,  
  
Reſolved, That whenever the neat produce of any.  
funds recommended by. Congreſs and granted by the  
fates, for funding the debt already contracted, or for  
procuring future loans for the ſupport of the war, ſhall  
  
  
whole amount of the national debt&#x27; which theſe ſtates  
may owe at the termination. of the preſent war, the  
ſurplus ot ſuch grants ſhall form a ſinking fund, to be in-  
violably appropriated to the payment of the principal  
of the ſaid debt, and ſhall on no account be diverted  
to any other purpoſe. : : |  
And in order that the ſeveral ſtates may have proper  
information of the ſtate of their finances, it is further  
reſolved, that as ſoon as the public debt can be liqui-  
Gated, each ſtate be annually furniſhed with the amount,  
thereof, and the intereſt thereon, and alſo of the pro-  
ceeds and diſpoſition of the funds provided for the re-  
demption thereof. | loved,

Madiſon and Mr. Fitaſimmons, to wham wa: refer-  
red the letter of the zoth November from the hongurable  
William Bradford, ſpeaker ot the lower houſe of aſſem ·  
bly of the ſtate of Rhode Mand; containing, under three  
heads, the reaſons of that ſtate for refuſing their compli.  
ance with the recommendation of Congreſs for a duty on  
_ * Imports and prize goods report, |  
That they flatter themſelves the ſtate, on a reconſi-  
deration of the objections they have offered, with a can-  
did attention to the arguments which ſtand in oppoſi-  
tion to them, will be induced to retract their diflent, con -  
f vinced that the meafure is ſupported on the moſt ſolid  
grounds of equal juſtice, policy and general utility. The  
following obfervatians, contraſted witb each head of the  
objections, ſucceſſively, will fiirniſh a TatisfaQory anſwer  
to the whole. |  
Firſc objection. *- That the propoſed duty would be  
unequal in its operation, bearing hardeſt upon the moſt  
_ commercial ſtates, and ſo would preſs pecaliarly hard u  
on that ſtate, which draws its chief ſapport from com-  
merce. tot 469 * |  
The moſt common experience, joined to the concur-  
rent opinions. of the ableſt&#x27; commercial and political ob-  
ſervers, have eſtabliſhed beyond controverſy this general  
principle, “ that every duty on imports is incorporated  
with the price of the commodity, and ultimately paid by  
the canſumer, with a profit on the duty itſelf, as a com.  
penſation to the merchant for the advance of his mo -  
ney.” ng | 8  
The merchant conſiders the duty demanded by the  
ſtate on the imported article, in the ſame light with  
freight or any ſimilar charge, and adding it to the origi-  
nal coſt, calculates his (profit on the aggregate ſam. It  
may happen that at particular conjunctures, Where the  
markets are overſtocked, and there is a competition a-  
mong the ſellers, this may not be practicable ; but in the  
CES | general  
  
1  
  
by  
Ca 1 |  
peneral courſe of trade the demand for confumption pre»  
ponderates, and the merchant can with eaſe indemnify  
himſelf, and even obtain a profit on the advance, As a  
conſumer, he pays his ſhare of theduty, but it is no fur ·  
ther a burthen vpon him. The conſequence of the prin-  
eiple laid down is, that every claſs of the community-  
bears its ſhare of the duty in proportion to its conſump.  
  
FR  
  
  
Mr. of the reſpective claſſes, in conjunction with their habits _  
  
fer- of expence or frugality. The rich and luxurious pay in  
  
able proportion to their riches and luxury; the poor and par-  
  
ras fimonious, in proportion to their poverty and parſimony.  
ree  
  
A chief excellence of this mode of revenue is, that it pre-  
ſerves a juſt meaſure to the abilities of individuals, pro-  
motes frugality, and taxes extravagance, The ſame rea-  
ſoning in our ſituation applies to the intercourſe between  
two ſtates ; if one imports and the other does not, the Jat=  
ter mult be ſupplied by the former. The duty being tranf-  
  
  
on the importing ſlate for what is conſumed in the other,  
than it is a charge on the merchant far what is conſumed  
by the farmer or artificer. Either ſtate will only feel the  
burthen in a ratio to its conſumption, and this will be  
in a ratio to its population and wealth. What happens  
between the different claſſes of the ſame community in-  
ternally happens between the two ſtates ; and as the mer.  
chant, in the firſt caſe, ſo far from loſing the duty him.  
felf, bas a profit on the money he advances for that pur -  
  
  
is the merchant with reſpect to the other, is not only res  
  
ur- imburſed by the non - importing ſtate, but has a like be ·  
ob- neſit on the duty advanced. It is therefore the reverſe  
eral of a juſt poſition, that the duty propoſed will bear hardeſt  
ted on the moſt commercial ſtates ; it will, if any thing, have  
dy a contrary effect, though not in a ſufficient degree to juſ-  
om. tify an objection on the part of the non- importing ſtates;  
no- for it is as reaſonable they ſhould allow an advance on  
h the duty paid as on the firit coſt, freight or any incidental  
the charge. They have alſo other advantages in the meaſure  
&quot;th fully equivalent to this diſadvantage. Over nice and mi-  
gl. nute calculations, in matters of this nature, are inconſiſt-  
. ent with national meatures, and in the imperfect ſtate  
the of human affairs, would ſtagnate all the operations of go-  
wg vernment, Abſolute equality is not to be attained: to

aim at it, is purſuing a ſhadow at the expence of the ſub-  
fiance, arid in the event we ſhould find ourſelves wider  
of the mark, than if in the firſt inſtance we were content  
to approach it with moderation. 1  
  
Second objection. “ That the recommendation pro-  
  
  
| It is not to be preſumed that the conſtitution of any  
  
  
deſcriptions of all officers to be permitted in the ſtate, ex-  
cluding, the creation of any new ones, whatever might  
be the neceſſity derived from that variety of circumſtances  
incident to all political inſtitutions. Thelegiſlature muſt  
always have a diſcretionary power of appointing officers  
not expreſsly known to the conſtitution, and this power  
will include that of authoriſing the federal government  
  
  
too much; to wit, that the power given by the confede -  
ration to Congreſs, to appoint all officers in the poſt-of-  
fice, was illegal and unconſtitutional. |  
  
The doctrine advanced-by Rhode-Ifland would perhaps  
prove alſo that the federal government ought to have  
  
  
ſit ion that would defeat all the proviſions of the confe-  
  
  
is, that no fœderal conſtitution can exift without powers  
  
  
ponent members. It is equally true, that no govern»  
ment can exiſt without a right to appoint officers for  
thoſe purpoſes which proceed from, and concenter in it-  
  
  
clared that Congreſs ſhall have authority to appoint all  
ſuch “ civil officers as may be neceſſary for managing the  
general affairs of the United States under their directi-  
on.” All that can be. required is, that the federal go-  
  
  
ered to make by the original act of unian, or by the ſub.  
ſequept conſent of the parties; unleſs there ſhould be  
expreſs words of excluſion in the conſtitution of a ſtate,  
there can be no reaſon to doubt that it is within the com-  
paſs of legiſlative diſcretion to eommunĩeate that authority,  
  
The propriety of doing it upon the preſent occaſion, is

Te meaſure propoſed is a meaſure of neeeſſity. Re-  
peated experiments have ſhewn, that the revenue to be  
raiſed within theſe ſtates is altogether inadequate to the  
public wants. The deficiency can only be ſopplied by  
Z3oans. Our applications to the foreign powers, on whoſe  
Friendſhip we depend, have had a ſucceſs far ſhort of  
dur neceffities. The next reſuurce is to borrow from  
individuals, Theſe will neither be actuated by genero ·  
ſity nor reaſons of ſtate. Tis to their intereſt alone we  
muſt appeal, To conciliate this, we muſt not only ſtipu-  
late a proper compenſation for what they lend, but we  
muſt give ſecurity for the performance, We muſt  
pledge an aſcertained fund; ſimple and productive in its  
nature ; general in its principle, and at the diſpoſal of a  
X ſingle will. There can be little confidence in a ſecart.

and not reyocable by any without a breach of the general  
compact. _  
*Tis by Cuch expedients that nations whoſe reſources  
are underſtood, whoſe reputations and governments are  
erected on the foundation of ages, are enabled to obrain  
a ſolid and extenſive credit. Would it be reaſonable  
in us to hope for more eaſy terms, who have ſo re.  
  
  
be expected, that individuals will be cantious in Jending  
their money to a people in our circumſtances, and that  
they will at Jeaſl require the beſt ſecuriry we can give?  
We have an enemy vigilance, intriguing, well acquaiyt-  
ed with our defects and embarreſſments We may ex-  
pect that he will make every effort :0 inftill diffider. ces  
into individuals, and in the preſent poſture of our inter-  
nal affairs, he will have too playfible ground on which  
to tread, Our neceſſities have obliged us to embrace  
meaſures with &quot;I to our public credit, calculared to  
inſpire diſtruſt. he pre poſlſe ſſions on this article muſt  
naturally be againſt us, and it is therefore indiſper ſible  
we ſhould endeavour to remove them, by ſuch means as  
will be the moſt obvious and ſtriking. ;  
It was with thele views Congreſs determined on a ge-  
neral fund&#x27;; and the one they have recommended muſt,

It has been remarked as an eſſential part of the plan;  
that the fund ſhould depend en a ſingle will. This will  
not be the caſe unleſs the collection, as well as the ap-  
  
ropriation, is under the controul of the United States;  
= ic is evident, that after the duty is agreed upon, it  
may in a great meaſure be defeated by an ineffectual  
mode of levying it. The United States have a common  
intereſt in an uniform and equally energetic collection:  
and not only policy, but juftice to all the parts of the  
union, defignates the utility ot lodging the power of mak.  
&#x27;Ing it where the intereſt is common, Without this it  
might in reality operate as a very unegual tax. _

; Firſt. The fund propoſed is ſufficiently definite as to  
time, becauſe it is only co-extenſive with the exiſt.. |  
ence of the debt contracted and to be contracted in the  
courſe of the war. Congreſs are perſuaded that it is as  
remote from the intention of their conſtituents to perpe-  
tuate that debt, as to extinguiſh it at once by a faithleſs *  
neglect of providing the means to fulfil the public en-  
gagements, Their ability to diſcharge it in a moderate  
time, can as little be doubted as their inclination, and  
the moment that debt ceaſes, the duty, ſo far as reſpects |  
the preſent proviſion, ceaſes with it. .*  
The reſolution recommending the duty, ſpecifies the  
object of it to be the diſcharge of the principal and inter-  
eſt of the debts already contracted, or which may be con-  
tracted on the faith of the United States for ſupporting |  
the preſent war, &#x27; | 6  
Secondly. The rate per cent. is fixed, and it is not at  
the option of the United States to encreaſe it. Though |}  
  
the product will vary according to the variations in trade,  
yet as there is this limitation of the rate, it cannot be  
properly ſaid to be indefinite as to quantity.

Zy the confederation, Congreſs have an abſolute dif-  
cretion in determining the quantum of revenue requiſite  
for the national expenditure. When this is done, no-  
thing remains for the ſtates, ſeparately, but the mode of  
  
  
ſum demanded without a breach of the confederation 3  
and when the money comes into the treaſury, the appro-  
priation is. the excluſive province of the federal governs  
ment. This proviſion of the - confederation (without  
  
  
rinciple in its fulleſt latitude, which the objection un-  
der conſideration treats as repugnant. to the liberty  
of the United States, to wit, an indefinite power of pre-  
ſcribing the quantity of :noney to be raiſed, and of ap-  
propriating it when raiſed. þ 7 9  
If it be ſaid that the ſtates individually, having the  
  
  
with exorbitant demands, the confederation will anſwer,  
that this is a point of which they have no conſtitutional  
Such a refuſal would be an exertion  
of power, not of right, and the ſame power which could  
diſregard a requiſition made on the authority of the con-  
federation, might at any time arreſt the eollection of the  
  
  
ſpect to the expenditure of the money furniſhed in the  
yas hitherto practiſed, would be equally applicable to  
the revenue from the imports. |  
  
The truth is, the ſecutity intended to the general li-  
berty in the confederation, conſiſts in the frequent elec-  
tion, and in the rotation of the members of Congreſs,  
by which there is a conſtant and an effectual check upon  
them. This is the ſecurity which the people in every  
Nate enjoy againſt the uſurpations of their. internal go-  
vernments ; and it is the true ſource of ſecurity in a  
repreſentative republic. The government, ſa conſtitu-  
ted, onght to have the means neceſſary to anſwer the  
end of its inſtitution. By weakening its hands rao much  
it may be rendered incapable of providing for the interi-  
or harmony, or the exterior defence of the late.  
  
The meaſure in queſtion, if not within the letter, is  
within the ſpirit of the confederation. Congreſs, by that,  
are empowered to borrow money for the uſe of the United  
States, and by implication, to concert the means neceſia .

gn | ty to accompliſh the end. But without infiſting upon  
1:8 | enis argument, if the confederation has not made proper,  
3:S proviſion for the exigencies of the ftates, it will be at all  
Wo times the duty of Congreſs to ſuggeſt further proviſions ;  
#1] | | and when their propoſals are ſubmitted to the unanimous  
| _ conſent of the ſtates, they can never be charged with ex-  
__ | ceeding the bounds of their traſt. Such a conſent is the  
= | baſis and ſanction of the contederation, which expreſsly,  
  
in the x 3th article, empowers Congreſs to agree to and  
propoſe ſuch additional proviſion, .  
The remarks hitherto made, have had reference  
principally to the future proſecution of the war. There  
. ED ſtin remains an intereſting light in which the ſubject  
Ih 1 ; dught to be viewed, ee 4h  
1 | The United States have already contre ed debt in  
1 Europe, and in this country, for which their faith is  
wh * pledged. The capital of this debr can only be diſcherged  
|| BE by degrees ; but a fund for this purpoſe, and for payin  
ik bb the intereſt annually, on every principle of policy an  
F | juſtice, ought to be provided, The omiſſion will be the  
1 : deepeſt ingratitude and cruelty to a Jarge number of  
: + - meritorious individaals, who, in the moſt critical periods  
| of the war, have adventured their fortunes in ſupport of  
our independence. It would ſtamp the national charac-  
ter with indelible diſgrace. 6-29 1  
  
An annual proviſion for the purpoſe will be too preca-  
Tious. If its continuance and application were certain  
it would not afford compleat relief. With many, the re-  
gular payment of intereſt, by occaſional grants, would  
  
_ Tuffice ; but with many more it would not. Theſe want  
the uſe of the principal itſelf, and they have a right to  
it; but ſince it is not in our power to pay off the princi-  
pal, the gext expedient is to fund the debt and render  
the evidences of it negotiable.  
  
Beſides the advantage to individuals from this arrange ·  
ment, the active ſtock of the nation would be increaſed  
by the whole amount of the domeſtic debt, and of courſe  
  
the abilities of the community to contribute to the pub.  
lie wants. The national credit would revive and ſtaud  
hereafter on a ſecure baſis, | ;  
  
This was another object of the propoſed duty.  
  
If jt be conceded that a ſimilar fund is neceſſary, it  
can hardly be diſputed that the one recommended is the  
moſt eligible, It has been already ſhewn that it 2

commerce, but the contrary can eafily be demonſtrated;  
It has been ſeen that it does not diminiſh the profit of the  
  
  
ducements to trade. It is too moderate in its amount to  
diſcourage the conſumption of imported goods, and cane  
not on that account ahridge the extent of importations.  
  
F merce by leſſening the proportion of our imports to our  
exports, and inclining the balance in favour of this coun»  
try. |  
  
| &quot;The principal thing to be conſulted for the advance-  
ment of commerce, is to promote exports. All impedi-  
ments to theſe, either by way of prohibition or by enereaſ-  
ing the prices of native commodities, decreaſing by that  
means their ſale and conſumption at foreign markets, are  
injurious. Duties on exports have this operation, For  
the ſame reaſans, taxes on poſſeſſions and the articles of  
our own growth or manufacture, whether in rhe form of  
a land tax, exciſe ox any other, are more hurtful to trade  
| The tendency of all ſuch taxes is to  
enereaſe the prices of thoſe articles which are the objects  
of exportation, and to enable others to under-ſell us  
abroad. The farmer, if he pays a heavy land · tax, muſt  
endeavour to get more for the. products of his farm: the  
mechanic and labourer, if they find the neceſfaries of life  
grow dearer by an exciſe, mult endeavour to exact higher  
  
  
ces within, and operate againſt foreign commerce,  
It is not, however, to be inferred, that the whole re-  
venue ought to be drawn from imports: all extremes are  
  
WF weight of the taxes fall not too heavily in the firſt inſtance  
upon particular parts of the community. A judicious diſ-  
tribution to all kinds of taxable property, is a firſt prin»  
[ciple in taxation. The tendency of thele obſervations is  
only to ſhew, that taxes on poſleſſions, on articles of our  
own growth and manufacture, are more prejudicial&#x27;to  
trade than duties on imports, +

The obſervations which tonclude the letter on Which ©  
theſe remarks are made, naturally lead to reflections that  
  
deſerve the ſerious attention of every member of the uni-  
on. There is a happy mean between too muchconfidence  
  
  
of a ſtate conſiſt. Either extreme is a dangerous vice;  
the firſt is a temptation to men in power to arrogate more  
than they have a right to—the latter enervates govern-  
  
  
moſt ſalutary meaſures, breeds confuſion in the tate, dif.  
guſts and diſcontents among the people, and may even-

growing more ſerious, the other creditors of the public

ſtate for refufing their compliance with the recom-  
endation of Congreſs for a duty on imports and  
  
Prize-goods ; report, eee e  
  
| 4. That they flatter themſelves the ſtate, on a re-  
  
  
with a candid attention to the arguments which  
ſtand in oppoſition to them, will be induced to re-  
tract their diſſent, convinced that the meaſure is  
ſupported on the moſt ſolid grounds of equal juſtice,  
policy, and general utility. The following obſer-  
vations, contraſted with each head of the objections,  
1 will furniſh a ſatisfactory anſwer to the  
whole. | .  
Firſt objection. That the propoſed duty would  
be unequal in its operation, bearing hardeſt upon  
the moſt commercial ſtates, and ſo would preſs pe-  
culiarly hard upon that ſtate which draws its chief  
The moſt common experience, joined to the con-  
current opinions of the ableſt commercial and poli-  
  
  
this general principle, ( that every duty on imports  
is incorporated with the price of the commodity,  
  
„  
  
„  
  
(2.2  
  
n the duty itſelf, as a compenſation to the merchaiſt  
for the advance of his money“. 228  
The merchant confiders the duty demanded. by  
the ſtate on the imported article, in the ſame  
light . with freight or any fimilar charge, and  
adding it to the original coft, calculares his profit  
on the aggregate ſum. It may happen, that at  
particular conjunctures, where the markets are  
overſtocked, and there is a competition among the  
ſellers, this may not be practicable; but in the  
general courſe of trade the demand for conſumption  
preponderates, and the merchant can with eaſe in-  
demnify himſelf, and even obtain a profit on the ad-  
&#x27;vance, As a conſumer, he pays a ſhare of the duty,  
but it is no further a burthen upon him. The con-  
ſequence of the principle laid down is, that every  
claſs of the community bears its ſhare of the duty in  
proportion to its conſumption, which laſt is regulat-  
ed by the comparative wealth of the reſpective  
claſſes, in conjunction with their habits of expence  
or frugality. The rich and luxurious pay in pro-  
portion to their riches and luxury; the poor and  
parſimonious, in proportion to their poverty and  
parſimony. A chief excellence of this mode of re-  
venue is, that it preſerves a juſt meaſure to the abi-  
lities of individuals, promotes frugality, and taxes  
extravagance. The ſame reaſoning in our fituation  
applies to the intercourſe between two ſtates; if one  
imports and the other does not, the latter muſt be  
ſupplied: by the former. The duty being tranſ-  
ferred to the price of the commodity, is no more a  
charge on the importing ſtate for what is conſumed.  
in the other, than it is a charge on the merchant for  
what is conſumed by the farmer or artificer. Either  
ſtate will only feel the burthen in a ratio to its con-  
ſumption, and this will be in a ratio to its population

and wealth, What happens between the different  
clafſes of the ſame community internally happetis  
.between the two ftates; and as the merchant, in the  
firſt caſe, ſo far from loſing the duty himſelf, has a  
Profit on the money he advances for that purpoſe ;  
1o the importing e which in the ſecond caſe is  
the merchant with reſpect to the other, is not only  
re- imburſed by the nen- importing ſtate, but has a  
like benefit on the duty advanced. It is therefore  
the reverſe of a juſt poſition, that the duty propoſed  
will bear hardeſt on the moſt commercial ſtates; it  
will, if any thing, have a contrary effect, though  
not in a ſufficient degree to juſtify an objection on  
the part of the non- importing ſtates. For it is as  
reaſonable they ſhould allow an advance on the duty  
paid, as on the firſt coſt, freight, or any incidental  
charge. They have alſo other advantages in tlie  
—— fully equivalent to this diſadvantage. Over-  
nice and minute calculations, in matters of this na-  
ture, are inconſiſtent with national meaſures, and in  
the imperfect ſtate of human affairs, would ſtagnate  
all the operations of government. Abſolute equa-  
lity is not to be attained : to aim at it, is purſuing  
a ſhadow at the expence of the ſubſtance, and in the  
event we ſhould find ourſelves wider of the mark,  
than if in the firſt inſtance we were content to ap-  
proach it with moderation. 5  
  
Second objection. That the recommendation  
propoſes to introduce into that and the other ſtates,  
officers unknown and unaccountable to them, and  
  
ſo is againſt the conftitution of the ſtate.”  
It is not to be preſumed that the conſtitution of  
any ſtate could mean to define and fix the preciſe  
numbers and deſcriptions of all othcers to be per-  
mitted in the ſtate, excluding the creation of any  
new ones, Whatever might be the neceſſity 2 0

from that variety of circumſtances incident to all A  
political inſtitutions.” The legiſlature muſt always  
have a diſcretionary power of appointing officers  
not expreſsſy known to the conſtitution, and this bt  
power will include that of authorifing the fœderal 33  
government to make the appointments in caſes ⁵³ü  
where the general welfare may require it. The 4  
denial of this would prove too much; to wit, ml  
that the power given by the confederation to Con-  
greſs, to appoint all officers in the poſt- office, was Ki  
illegal and unconſtitutional. 5 nen i  
The doctrine advanced by Rhode: Iſland would 0  
perhaps prove alſo that the fœderal government bY  
ought to have the appointment of no internal officers 9  
whatever ; a poſitjon that would defeat all the pro- oh  
vifions of the confederation, and all the purpoſes of 1  
the. union. The truth is, that no fœderal conſtitu- 1  
tion can exiſt without powers that in their exer-=  
&#x27;Tiſe affect the internal police of the component mem- |  
bers. It is equally true, that no government can  
exiſt without a right to appoint officers for thoſe  
1 which proceed from, and concenter in it=  
felf; and therefore the confederation has expreſly  
declared, that Congreſs ſhall have authority to ap-  
point all ſuch * civil officers as may be neceſſary for  
managing the general affairs of the United States  
under their direction.“ All that can be required is,  
that the fœderal government confine its appoint-  
ments to ſuch as it is empowered to make by the  
original act of union, or by the ſubſequent conſent  
of the parties: unleſs there ſhould be expreſs words  
of excluſion in the conſtitution of a ſtate, there can  
be no reaſon to doubt that it is within the compaſs  
of legiſlative diſcretion to communicate that au-  
TR thority. N en ys 74 7 *&gt;79

But without infiſting upon this argument, if the  
confederation has not made proper proviſion for the  
exigencies of the ſtates, it wilf be at all times the  
duty of Congreſs to ſuggeſt further proviſions; and  
when their propoſals are ſubmitted to the unanimous  
conſent of the ſtates, they can never be charged  
with exceeding the bounds of their truſt, Such a  
conſent is the baſis and ſanction of the confederation,  
which expreſly, in the 13th article, empowers Con-  
greſs to agree to and propoſe ſuch additional

here ſtill remains an intereſting light in which the  
ſubje&amp; ought to be view.  
The United States have already contracted debt  
© In Europe, and in this country, for which their  
faith is pledged, The capital of this debt can only  
  
  
poſe, and for paying the intereſt annually, on every  
principle of policy and juſtice, ought to be pro-  
vided. The omiſſion will be the deepeſt ingratitude  
and cruelty to a large number of meritorious in-  
dividuals, who, in the moſt critical periods of the  
war, have adventured their fortunes in ſupport of  
our independence. It would ſtamp the national  
character with indelible diſgracdee.  
An annual proviſion for the purpoſe will be too  
ptecarious. if its continuance and application were  
&quot;certain, it would not afford compleat relief, With  
many, the regular payment of intereſt, by occa-  
ſional grants, would ſuffice; but with many mote  
«It an 7 not. Theſe want the uſe of the principal it-  
&#x27;{elf, and they have a right to it; but fince fit&quot;is  
not in our power to pay off the principal, the next  
expedient is to fund the debt, and render&quot; the evi.

Beides the advantage to individuals from  
this arrangement, the akin ſtock of the nation  
would be increaſed by the whole amount of the  
domeſtic debt, and of courſe the abilities of the  
community to contribute to the public wants.  
The national credit would revive, and ſtand here-  
  
  
This was another object of the propoſed duty.  
If it be conceded that a fimilar fund is neceſſary  
  
  
it affects all parts of the community, in proportion  
to their conſumption, and has therefore the be  
  
  
tax to the people that can be impoſed, becauſe it  
is paid inſenſibly, and ſeems to be voluntary. _ ....  
It may perhaps be imagined that it is unfavour-  
  
  
demonſtrated. It has been ſeen that it does not  
diminiſh the profit of the merchant, and of courſe  
  
  
It is too moderate in its amount to diſcourage. the  
conſumption of imported goods, and cannot oy  
that account abridge the extent of importations.  
If it even had this effect, it would be an advantage  
to commerce, by leſſening the proportion of our im-  
Ports to our exports, and inclining the balance in  
  
tavour of this country. i OATS

of our own 3 or manufacture, whether in  
the form of a land-tax, exciſe, or any other,  
are more hurtful to trade than impoſt duties. The  
tendency of all ſuch taxes is to encreaſe the prices  
of thoſe articles which are the objects of expörta-  
tion, and to enable others to under-ſell us abroad;  
The farmer, if he pays a heavy landitax, muſt en-  
deavour to get more for the ptoducts of his farm £

eeſfaries of life grow dearer by an exciſe, muſt  
endeavour to exact higher wages; and theſe caules  
will produce an encreaſe of prices within, and. BE.  
rate againſt foreign commerce.  
  
It is not, however, to be inferred; that this Whole  
revenue ought to be drawn from imports: alt ex-  
tremes are to be rejected. The chief thing to be  
attended to is, that the weight of the taxes fall not  
too heavily in the firſt inſtance upon particular  
Parts of the community. A judicious diſtribution  
to all Kinds of taxable property, is a firſt principle  
  
  
only to ſhew, that taxes on poſſeſſions, on articles  
of our own growth and manufacture, are more  
rejudicial to trade than duties on imports. +  
The obſeryations which conclude the letter on  
which theſe remarks are made, naturally lead to  
Teflections that deferve the ſerious attention of every  
  
  
between too much confidence and exceſſive jealouſy,  
  
  
Either extreme is a dangerous vice ; the firſt is a

The conduct of the war is intruſted to Congreſs,  
and the public expectation turned upon them, with-  
out any competent means at their command to  
ſatisfy the important truſt. After the moſt full and  
ſolemn deliberation, under a collective view, of  
all the public difficulties, they recommend a mea-

Here is the objection. Listen to it.  
  
“ That, by granting to Congress a power TO COLLECT MO.  
NEYS from the commerce of these States, INDEFINITELY AS TO  
TIME AND QUANTITY, and for the EXPENDITURE of which  
they are NOT te be ACCOUNTABLE to the STATES, they would be-  
come INDEPENDENT of their constituents ; and so, the proposed un-  
post is REPUGNANT to the LIBERTY of the UNITED STATES.”  
  
And here is the answer to that objection. Listen to it also.  
  
“ Admitting the PRINCIPLE of this objection to be TRUR., still it  
ought to have no weight in the present case, because there is no ANALO-  
GY betereen the PRINCIPLE and the FACT. The fund proposed is  
suficiently DEVINITE eas to TIME, because it is only CO-EXTEN.  
SIVE wuhk the EXISTENCE of the DEBT, contracted, and to be con-  
tracted, in the course of the war. Congress are persuaded that it is as  
remote from the intention of their constituents to PERPETUATE that  
DEBT, as to extinguish it at once by a faithless neglect of providing  
the means to fulfil the pablic enzagements. Their ability to discharge  
it in a moderate time, can be as little doubted as their inclination; and  
the MOMENT that DEBT CEASES, the DUTY, as faras it respects  
the present provision, CEASES WITH IT.”  
  
Mark, I beseech you, Mr. President, the language of this objection,  
and of this answer. The objection is to the revenue raising power, and  
18 three fold in its nature. 1. Because the exercise of the power was  
to be indefinite as to time. 2. Because the revenue to be raised was to  
be unlimited as to quantity. 3. Because the Federal Congress was to  
be unaccountable to the States for the expenditure of this revenue. This  
was the three fold nature of the objection ; and the conclusion, or infer

““T&#x27;he most common experience, joined to the !  
concurrent opinions of the oldest rmmnercia”  
and political observers, have established beyond l  
controversy this general principle, ‘that every  
duty an imports is incorporated with the pricei  
of the eommodity, and ultimatelv paid by the  
consumer, with a profit on the duty itself, as a  
compensation to the merchant for the advance  
of his money.” “Uhe merchant considers the  
duty demanded by the State on the imported ar­  
ticle, in the same light with freight, or any sim­  
ilar charge; and, adding it to the orniginal cost,  
calculates his profit on the aggregate sum. It  
may happen, that at particvlar conjunctures,  
where the markets are overstocked, and there  
is a competition among the sellers, this may not  
be practicable ; hut in the general course of  
-trade the demand for consumption preponder­  
ates, and the merchant can with ease indemnify  
himself,and even obtain a profit on the advance.  
As a consumer, he pays his share of the daty,  
but it is no further a burden upon him. The  
. consequence of the principle laid down, that  
every class of the community bears its share of  
the duty in proportion to its consumption, which  
last is regulated by the comparative wealth of  
the respective classes, in conjunction with their  
habits of expense or frugality. The rich and  
luxurious pay in proportion to their riches and  
luxury; the poor and parsimonious, in propor­  
tion to their poverty and parsimony. A chief  
excellence of this mode of revenue is, that it  
preserves a just measure to the abilities of indi­  
viduals, promotes frugality, and taxes extrava­  
gance. &#x27;l&#x27;he same reasoning in our situation  
applies to the intercourse between two States ;  
if one itmports and the other does not, the latter  
must be supplied by the former. The duty be­  
ing transformed to the price of the commodity  
is no.more a charge on the importing State for  
what is condemned in the other, than it isa  
charge on the merchant for .whats consumed  
by the farmer or artificer. Either Stdate will  
only feel the burthen in a ratio ‘o its consump­  
tion, and this will be in a ratio to its population  
and wealth. What happens between the diff­  
erent classes of the same community, internally  
“happens between the two States ; und as the  
merchant in the first case ;so far from losing  
the duty himself has a profit on the money he  
advances for that purpose, sothe importing  
State, which in the second case is the merchant  
with respect to the other, is not only reimbur­  
sed by the nonimporting State, but has a like  
benefit on the duty advanced. It is therefore  
the reverse of a just pesition, that the duty pro­  
‘posed will bear hardest on the most commercial  
States; it will if any thing, have a contrary eff­  
ect, though not in a suflicient degree to justify  
an objection on the part of the nou-importing  
State. For it is ax reasonable they should allow  
an advance on the duty paid as on the first cost  
freight, or any incidental charge. They have  
also other advantages in the measure, fully e­  
_ quivalent to this disadvantage, Over nice and  
~ minute calculations, in matters of this nature,  
are incensistent with national measures, andfin  
~ the imperfect state of human affairs,would stag­  
“nate all the operatious of government.  
- Absolute equality is not to be obtained; to aim  
at it, is pursuing a shadow at the expense of the  
substance, and in the eveat we shoald find our­  
. ulics’w}gjéroﬁ&#x27;lbﬂ.umrk, than if, io the fiest in­

&quot;The most common experience, joined to the con­  
current opinions of the oldest commercial and politi­  
cal observers, have established beyond controversy this  
general principle, &#x27;that every duty on imports is incor­  
porated with the price of the commodity, and ultimate­  
ly paid by the consumer, with a profit on the duty it­  
self, as a compensation to the merchant for the advance  
of his money.&#x27; &#x27;The merchant considers the duty de­  
manded by the Slate on the imported article, in the  
same light with freight, or any similar charge; and, add­  
ing it to the original cost, calculates his profit on the  
aggregate sum. it may happen, that at particular con  
junctures, where the markets are overstocked, and  
tiiere is a competition among the sellers, this may not  
be practicable; but in the general course of trade the  
demand for consumption preponderates, and the mer­  
chant can with ease indemnify himself, and even ob­  
tain a profit on the advance. As a consumer, he pays  
his share of the duty, but it is no further burden upon  
him. The consequence of the principle laid down,  
that every class of the community bears its share of  
the duty in proportion to its consumption, which last  
is regulated by die comparative wealth of the respec­  
tive classes, in conjunction with their habits of ex­  
pense or frugality. The rich and luxurious pay in pro­  
portion to their riches and luxury?the poor and parsi­  
monious, in proportion to their poverty and parsimony.  
A chief excellence of this mode of revenue is, that it  
preserves a just measure to the abilities of individuals,  
promotes frugality, and taxes extravagance. The  
same reasoning in our situation applies to the inter­  
course between two States?if one imports, and the  
other does not, the latter must be supplied by the for­  
mer. The duty being transformed to the price of the  
commodity, is no more a charge on the importing State  
lor what is consumed in the other, than it is a charge  
on the merchant for what is consumed by the farmeror  
artificer. Either State will only feel the burden in a  
ratio to its consumption, and tins will be in n ratio to  
its population and wealth. What happens between  
llie different classes of the same community, in­  
ternally happens between the two States?and as  
the merchant in the fir?t case?so fir from losing  
the duty himself has a profit on the money he advances  
for that purpose, so the importing State, which in the  
second rase is the merchant with respect to the other,  
is not only reimbursed by the non-importing State, but  
has ai&#x27;ke benefit on the duty advanced. Ii is there­  
fore the reverse of a just position, that the duty pro  
posed will bear hardest on the most commercial Slates;  
it will, if any thing, have a contrary effect, though not  
in a sufficient degree to justify an objection on &#x27;.lie part  
of the non-importing State. For it is as reasonable  
they should allow an advance on the duty paid as on  
the first cost freight, or any incidental charge. They  
have also other advantages in the measure, fully equi­  
valent to this disadvantage. Over nice and minute  
calculations, in matters of this nature, are inconsistent  
with national measures, and in the imperfect state of  
human afTairs, would stagnate all the operations of Go­  
vernment.  
Abiolute equality is not to lie obtained; to aim at it,  
is pursuing a shadow at the expense of the substance,  
and in the event we should find ourselves wider ofTthe  
mark, than if, in the first instance, we were content to  
approach it with moderation.&quot;

swered its objections in order  
To the first, that the proposed duty would  
be unequal in its operation, bearing hardest  
upon the most commercial States, and so  
would press peculiarly hard upon that State  
which draws its chief support from com­  
merce,&quot; the committee answered, in its re­  
port of Dee, 16, 1782, that every duty on im­  
 o io ee i e i o e  
commodity, and ultimately paid by the con­  
sumer, with a profit on the duty itself as a  
 coenaton o the meran or the ad­  
vance of the money.&quot; It then proceeded with  
this argument  
 The merchant considers the duty demanded by the  
 State on the imported article in the same light with  
 treight or any similar charge and adding it to the orig  
 al cost, calculates his pront on the aggregate sum  
 s As a consumer, he pays his share of the duty  
but it is no further a burden upon him. The consequence  
of the princile lald down is that every class ot the  
community bears its share of the duty in proportion to  
Its consumption, which last is regulated by the compara  
tive wealth of the resnective classes in conjunction with  
 their habits of expense or frugality. The rich and luxu  
rious pay in proportion to their riches and luxury the  
poor and parsimonious, in proportion to their poverty  
and parsimony. A chief excellence of this mode of reve  
nue ie, that it preserves a lust mensure to the abilities or  
individuals, promotes frugality, and taxes extravagance  
The same reasoning in our situation applies to the inter­  
course between two States; if one imnorts and the other  
does not, the latter must be supplied by the former. The  
 duty, being transferred to the price of the commodity  
is no more a charge on the importins tate for whati

But he said in reply to Rhode Island ‘it is not to be inferred that the  
whole revenue ought to be drawn from imports; all extremes are to be 1e-  
jected. The chief thing to be attended to, is, that the weight of the taxes  
fall not too heavily in the first instance upon any particular part of the  
community. A judicious distribution of all kinds of taxable property, is a  
first principle of taxation. The tendency of these observations is only to

By the United States in Congress assembled, December 16, 1782.  
  
The committee, consisting of Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Madison and  
Mr. Fitzsimmons, to whom was referred the letter of 30th Novem-  
ber, from the honourable William Bradford, speaker of the lower  
house of assembly of the state of Rhode Island, containing under  
three heads, the reasons of that state for refusing their compliance  
with the recommendation of Congress for a duty on imports and  
prize goods; report,  
  
That they flatter themselvesthe state, on a reconsideration of the  
objections they have offered, with a candid attention to the argu-  
ments which stand in opposition to them, will be induced to retract  
their dissent, convinced that the measure is supported on the most  
solid grounds of equal justice, policy and general utility. The fol-  
lowing observations, contrasted with each head of the objections,  
successively, will furnish a satisfactory answer to the whole.  
  
First objection. ‘‘That the proposed duty would be unequal in its  
operation, bearing hardest upon the most commercial states, and so  
would press peculiarly hard upon that state, which draws its chief  
support from commerce.”  
  
The most common experience, joined to the concurrent opinions  
of the ablest commercial and political observers, have established  
beyond controversy this general principle, ‘‘that every duty on im-  
ports is incorporated with the price of the commodity, and ulti-  
mately paid by the customer, with a profit on the duty itself, as a  
compensation to the merchant for the advance of his money.”  
  
The merchant considers the duty demanded by the state on the  
imported article, in the same light with freight or any similar  
charge, and adding it to the original cost, calculates his profit on  
the aggregate sum. It may happen that at particular conjunctures,  
where the markets are overstocked, and there is a competition  
among the sellers, this may not be practicable; but in the general  
course of trade the demand for consumption preponderates, and

the merchant can with ease indemnify himself, and even obtain  
a profit on the advance. As a consumer, he pays his share of the  
duty, but it is no further a burden upon him. The consequence of  
the principle laid down is, that every class of the community bears  
its share of the duty in proportion to its consumption, which last is  
regulated by the comparative wealth of the respective classes, in  
conjunction with their habits of expense or frugality. The rich  
and luxurious pay in proportion to their riches and luxury; the  
poor and parsimonious, in proportion to their poverty and parsi-  
mony. A chief excellence of this mode of revenue is, that it pre-  
serves a just measure to the abilities of individuals, promotes fru-  
gality, and taxes extravagance. The same reasoning in our situation  
applies to the intercourse between two states; if one imports and  
the other does not, the latter must be supplied by the former. The  
duty being transferred to the price of the commodity, is no more a  
charge on the importing state for what is consumed in the other  
than it is a charge on the merchant for what is consumed by the  
farmer or artificer. Either state will only feel the burthen in a  
ratio to its consumption, and this will be in a ratio to its population  
and wealth. What happens between the different classes of the  
same community internally happens hetween the two states; and as  
the merchant, in the first case, so far from losing the duty himself,  
has a profit on the money he advances for that purpose; so the  
importing state, which in the second case is the merchant with  
respect to the other, is not only re-imbursed by the non-importing  
state, but has a like benefit on the duty advanced. It is therefore  
the reverse of a just position, that the duty proposed will bear  
hardest on the most commercial states; it will, if any thing, havea  
contrary effect, though not ina sufficient degree to justify an objec-  
tion on the part of the non-importing states. For it is as reasonable  
they should ailow an advance on the duty paid as on the first cost,  
freigbt or any incidental charge. They have also other advantages  
in the measure fully equivalent to this disadvantage. Over nice and  
minute calculations, in matters of this nature, are inconsistent with  
national measures, and in the imperfect state of human affairs,  
would stagnate all the operations of government. Absolute equality  
is not to be attained: to aim at it, is pursuing a shadow at the  
ex pense of the substance, and in the event we should find ourselves  
wider of the mark, than if in the first instance we were content to  
approach it with moderation.  
  
Second objection. ‘‘That the recommendation proposes to intro-  
duce into that and the other states, officers unknown and unaccount-  
able to them, and so is against the constitution of the state.’’  
  
It is not to be presumed that the constitution of any state could  
mean to define and fix the precise numbers and descriptions of all  
  
  
  
609] Appendix.  
  
officers to be permitted in the state, excluding the creation of any  
new ones, whatever might be the necessity derived from that vari-  
ety of circumstances incident to all political institutions. The leg-  
islature must always have a discretionary power of appointing  
officers, not expressly known to the constitution, and this power  
will include that of authorizing the federal government to make the  
appointments in cases where the general welfare may require it.  
The denial of this would prove too much; to wit, that the power  
given by the confederation to Congress, to appoint all officers in the  
post-office, was illegal and unconstitutional.  
  
The doctrine advanced by Rhode Island would perhaps prove also  
that the federal government ought to have the appointment of no  
internal officers whatever; a position that would defeat all the pro-  
visions of the confederation, and all the purposes of the union.  
The truth is, that no federal constitution can exist without powers  
that in their exercise affect the internal police of the component  
members. It is equally true, that no government can exist with-  
out aright to appoint officers for those purposes which proceed from,  
and concenter in itself; and therefore the confederation has  
expressly declared that Congress shall have authority to appoint  
all such “‘civil officers as may be necessary for managing the gen-  
eral affairs of the United States under their direction.”’ All that  
can be required is, that the federal government confine its appoint-  
ments to such as it is empowered to make by the original act of  
union, or by the subsequent consent of the parties; unless there  
should be express words of exclusion in the constitution of a state,  
there can be no reason to doubt that it is within the compass of  
legislative discretion to communicate that authority.  
  
The propriety of doing it upon the present occasion, is founded on  
substantial reasons.  
  
The measure proposed is a measure of necessity. Repeated  
experiments have shown, that the revenue to be raised within these  
states is altogether inadequate to the public wants. The deficiency  
can only be supplied by loans. Our applications to the foreign  
powers, on whose friendship we depend, have had a success far  
short of our necessities. The next resource is to borrow from indi-  
viduals. These will neither be actuated by generosity nor reasons  
of state. ’Tisto their interest alone we must appeal. To conciliate  
this, we must not only stipulate a proper compensation for what  
they lend, but we must give security for the performance. We must  
pledge an ascertained fund; simple and productive in its nature;  
general in its principle, and at the disposal of a single will. There  
can be little confidence in asecurity under the constant revisal of  
thirteen different deliberatives. It must, onee for all, be defined  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
158 Appendiz. [610  
  
and established on the faith of the states solemnly pledged to each  
other, and not revocable by any without a breach of the general  
com pact.  
  
’Tis by such expedients that nations, whose resources are under-  
stood, whose reputations and governments are erected on the foun-  
dations of ages, are enabled to obtain a solid and extensive credit.  
Would it be reasonable in us to hope for more easy terms, who  
have so recently assumed our rank among the nations? Is it not  
to be expected, that individuals will be cautious in lending their  
money to a people in our circumstances, and that they will at  
least require the best security we can give?  
  
We have an enemy vigilant, intriguing, well acquainted with our  
defects and embarrassments. We may expect that he will make  
every effort to instil diffidences into individuals, and in the present  
posture of our internal affairs, he will have too plausible ground  
on which to tread. Our necessities have obliged us to embrace  
measures, with respect to our public credit, calculated to inspire  
distrust. The prepossessions on this article must naturally be  
against us, and it is therefore indispensible we should endeavor to  
remove them, by such means as will be the most obvious and  
striking.  
  
It was with these views Congress determined ona general fund;  
and the one they have recommended must, upon a thorough exam-  
ination, appear to have fewer inconveniences than any other.  
  
It has been remarked as an essential part of the plan, that the  
fund should depend on a single will. This will not be the case,  
unless the collection, as well as the appropriation, is under the con-  
trol of the United States; for it is evident, that after the duty is  
agreed upon, it may, in a great measure, be defeated by an ineffec-  
tual mode of levying it. The United States have a common inter-  
est in g uniform and equally energetic collection; and not only  
policy, but justice to all parts of the union, designates the utility of  
lodging the power of making it where the interest is common.  
Without this it might in reality operate as a very unequal tax.  
  
Third objection. ‘‘That by granting to Congress a power to col-  
lect monies from the commerce of these states, indefinitely as to  
time and quantity, and for the expenditure of which they are not  
to be accountable to the states, they would become independent of  
their constituents, and so the proposed impost is repugnant to the  
liberty of the United States.’’  
  
Admitting the principle of this objection to be true, still it ought  
to have no weight in the present case because there is no analogy  
between the principle and the fact.  
  
First. The fund proposed is sufficiently definite as to time,  
because it is only co-extensive with the existence of the debt con-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
611] Appendix. 159  
  
tracted and to be contracted in the course of the war. Congress are  
persuaded that it is as remote from the intention of their constitu-  
ates to perpetuate that debt, as to extinguish it at once by a faithless  
neglect of providing the means to fulfill the public engagements.  
Their ability to discharge it in a moderate time, can as little be  
doubted as their inclination, and the moment that debt ceases, the  
duty, so far as respects the present provision, ceases with it.  
  
The resolution recommending the duty, specifies the object of it  
to be the discharge of the principal and interest of the debtsalready  
contracted, or which may be contracted on the faith of the United  
States for supporting the present war.  
  
Secondly. The rate per cent. is fixed, and it is not at the option  
of the United States to increase it. Though the product will vary  
according to the variations in trade; yet as there is this limitation  
of the rate, it cannot be properly said to be indefinite as to quantity.  
  
By the confederation, Congress have an absolute discretion in  
determining the quantam of revenue requisite for the national  
expenditure. When this is done, nothing remains for the states  
separately, but the mode of raising. No state can dispute the obli-  
gation to pay the sum demanded without a breach of the confed-  
eration; and when the money comes into the treasury the appro-  
priation is the exclusive province of the federal government. This  
provision of the confederation (without which it would be an empty  
form) comprehends in it the principle in its fullest latitude, which  
the objection under consideration treats as repugnant to the liberty  
of the United States, to wit, an indefinite power of prescribing the  
quantity of money to be raised, and of appropriating it when  
raised. ;  
  
If it be said that the states individually, having the collection in  
their own hands, may refuse a compliance with exorbitant de-  
mands, the confederation will answer, that this is a point efwhich  
they have no constitutional liberty to judge. Such a refusal would  
be an exertion of power, not of right, and the same power which  
could disregard a requisition made on the authority of the confed-  
eration, might any time arrest the collection of duty.  
  
The same kind of responsibility which exists with respect to the  
expenditure of the money furnished in the forms hitherto prac-  
ticed, would be equally applicable to the revenue from the imports.  
  
The truth is, the security intended to the general liberty in the  
confederation, consists in the frequent election and in. the rota-  
tion of the members of Congress, by which there is a constant and  
an effectual check upon them. This is the security which the peo-  
ple in every state enjoy against the usurpations of their internal  
governments; and it is the true source of security in a representa-

160 Appendix. [612  
  
tive republic. The government, so constituted, ought to have the  
means necessary to answer the end of its institution. By weaken-  
ing its hands too much it may be rendered incapable of providing  
for the interior harmony, orthe exterior defence of the state.  
  
The measure in question, if not within the letter, is within the  
spirit of the confederation. Congress, by that, are empowered to  
borrow money for the use of the United States, and by implication,  
to concert the means necessary to accomplish the end. But with-  
out insisting upon this argument, if the confederation has not made  
proper provision for the exigences of the states, it will be at all  
times the duty of Congress to suggest further provisions ; and when  
their proposals are submitted to the unanimous consent of the  
states, they can never be charged with exceeding the bounds of  
their trust. Such a consent is the basis and function of the confed-  
eration, which expressly, in the 13th article, empowers Congress  
to agree to and propose such additional provision.  
  
The remarks hitherto made, have had reference principally to  
the future prosecution of the war. There still remains an inter-  
esting light in which the subject ought to be reviewed.  
  
The United States have already contracted a debt in Europe, and  
in this country, for which their faith is pledged. The capital of  
this debt can only be discharged by degrees; but a fund for this  
purpose, and for paying the interest annually, on every principle  
of policy and justice, ought to be provided. The omission will be  
the greatest ingratitude and cruelty to a large number of merito-  
rious individuals, who, in the most critical periods of war, have  
adventured their fortunes in support of ovurindependence. It would  
stamp the national character with indelible disgrace.  
  
An annual provision for the purpose will be too. precarious. If  
its continuance and application were certain it would not afford com-  
plete relief. With many, the regular payment of interest, by  
occasional grants, would suffice; but with many more it would not.  
These want the use of the principal itself, and they have a right to  
it; but since it is not in our power to pay off the principal, the next  
expedient is to fund the debt and render the evidences of it nego-  
tiable.  
  
Besides the advantage to individuals from this arrangement, the  
active stock of the nation would be increased by the whole amount  
of the domestic debt, and of course the abilities of the community  
to contribute to the public wants; the national credit would revive  
and stand hereafter on a secure basis.  
  
This was another object of the proposed duty.  
  
If it be conceded that a similar fund is necessary, it can hardly  
be disputed that the one recommended is the most eligible. It has  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
613] Appendix. 161  
  
already shown that it affects all parts of the community in propor-  
tion to their consumption, and has therefore the best pretensions  
to equality. It is the most agreeable tax to the people that can be  
imposed, because it is paid insensibly and seems to be voluntary.  
  
It may perhaps be imagined that it is unfavorable to commerce,  
but the contrary can easily be demonstrated. It has been seen that  
it does not diminish the profit of the merchant, and of course can  
be no diminution of his inducements to trade. It is too moderate  
in its amount to discourage the consumption of imported goods, and  
cannot on that account abridge the extent of importations. If it  
even had this effect, it would bean advantage to commerce, by less-  
ening the proportion of our imports to our exports, and inclining  
the balance in favor of this country.  
  
The principal thing to be consulted for the advancement of com.  
merce is to promote exports. All impediments to these, either by  
way of prohibition or by increasing the prices of native commodi-  
ties, decreasing by that means their sale and consumption at foreign  
markets, are injurious. Duties on exports have this operation.  
For the same reason, taxes on possessions and the articles of our  
own growth or manufacture, whether in the form of a land tax, ex-  
cise or any other, are more hurtful to trade than impost duties.  
The tendency of all such taxes is to increase the prices of those  
articles which are the objects of exportation, and to enable others  
to undersell us abroad. The farmer, if he pays a heavy land tax,  
must endeavor to get more for the products of his farm: the  
mechanic and laborer, if they find the necessaries of life grow  
dearer by an excise, must endeavor to exact higher wages: and  
these causes will produce an increase of prices within, and operate  
against foreign commerce.  
  
It is not, however, to be inferred that the whole revenue ought  
to be drawn from imports: all extremes are to be rejected. The  
chief thing to be attended to is, that the weight of the taxes fall  
not too heavily in the first instance upon particular parts of the  
community. A judicious distribution to all kinds of taxable prop-  
erty, is a first principle in taxation. The tendency of these observa-  
tions is only to show, that taxes on possessions, on articles of our  
own growth and manufacture, are more prejudicial to trade than  
duties on imports.  
  
The observations which conclude the letter on which these  
remarks are made, naturally lead to reflections that deserve the  
serious attention of every member of the union. There is a happy  
mean between too much confidence and excessive jealousy, in which  
the health and prosperity of a state consist. Either extreme is a  
dangerous vice; the first is a temptation to men in power to arro

gate more than they have a right to; the latter enervates govern-  
ment, prevents system in administration, defeats the most salutary  
measures, breeds confusion in the state, disgusts and discontents  
among the people, and may eventually prove as fatal to liberty as  
the opposite temper.  
  
It is certainly pern&#x27;cious to leave any government in a situation  
of responsibility disproportioned to its powers.  
  
The conduct of the war is intrusted to Congress, and the public ex-  
pectation turned upon them without any competent means at their  
command to satisfy the important trust. After the most full and  
solemn deliberation, under a collective view of all the public diffi-  
culties, they recommend a measure which appears to them the  
corner stone of the public safety: they see this measure suspended  
for nearly two years—partially complied with by some of the states,  
rejected by one of them, and in danger on that account to be frus-  
trated; the public embarrassments every day increasing, the  
dissatisfaction of the army growing more serious, the other cred-  
itors of the public clamoring for justice; both irritated by the  
delay of measures for their present relief or future security, the  
hopes of our enemies encouraged to protract the war, the zeal  
of our friends depressed by an appearance of remissness and want  
of exertion on our part, Congress harrassed, the national! character  
suffering, and the national safety at the mercy of events.  
  
This state of things cannot but be extremely painful to Congress,  
and appear to your committee to make it their duty to be urgent to  
obviate the evils with which it is pregnant.  
  
Resolved, That Congress agree to the said report.”
