metals. It should be gilt to protect it from the rust which might in time shorten it.  
Let the Standard of measure then be an iron rod, of uniform diameter, and of such length as, in latitude 38.° and in a cellar or other place the temperature of which does not vary thro’ the year, shall perform it’s vibrations, in small and equal arcs, in one second of mean time.  
A standard of invariable length being thus obtained, we may proceed to identify by that the measures, weights, and coins of the United States. But here a doubt presents itself as to the extent of the reformation meditated by the house of representatives. The experiment made by Congress in the year 1786. by declaring that the money of account and paiment should be the same through the U.S. and that it’s parts and multiples should be in a decimal ratio, has obtained such general approbation both at home and abroad, that nothing seems wanting, but the actual coinage, to banish the discordant pounds, shillings, pence and farthings of the different states and to establish in their stead the new denominations. Is it in contemplation with the house of representatives to extend a like improvement to our measures and weights, and to arrange them also in a decimal ratio? The facility which this would introduce into the vulgar arithmetic, would unquestionably be soon and sensibly felt by the whole mass of the people, who would thereby be enabled to compute for themselves whatever they should have occasion to buy, to sell, or to measure, which the present complicated and difficult ratios place beyond their computation for the most part. Or, is it the opinion of the representatives that the difficulty of changing the established habits of a whole nation opposes an insuperable bar to this improvement? Under this uncertainty the Secretary of state thinks it his duty to submit alternative plans that the house may at their will adopt either the one or the other exclusively; or the one for the present, and the other for a future time, when the public mind may be supposed to have become familiarized to it.  
I.  
And first on the supposition that the present measures and weights are to be retained, but to be rendered uniform and invariable by bringing them to the same invariable standard.  
The first settlers of these states having come chiefly from England, brought with them the measures and weights of that country.  These alone are generally established among us, either by law or usage, and these therefore are alone to be retained and fixed. We must resort to that country for information of what they are or ought to be.  
This rests principally on the evidence of certain standard measures and weights, which have been preserved of long time in different deposits. But differences among these having been known to exist the house of commons, in the years 1757. and 1758. appointed committees to enquire into the original standards of their weights and measures. These Committees, assisted by able Mathematicians and artists, examined and compared with each other the several standard measures and weights, and made reports on them in the years 1758. and 1759. The circumstances under which these reports were made entitle them to be considered as far as they go as the best written testimony existing of the standard measures and weights of England: and as such they will be relied on in the progress of this report.  
Measures of length  
The measures of length in use among us are  
  
the league of 3. miles the mile  
of 8. furlongs the furlong of 40. poles, or perches  
the pole or perch of five yards and a half  
the fathom of 2 yards  
the ell of a yard and a quarter  
the yard of 3. feet  
the foot of 12. inches  
and the inch of 10. lines.  
  
On this branch of their subject the committee of 1757. 1758. sais that the Standard measures of length at the Receipt of the Exchequer are a Yard, supposed to be of the time of H. 7. and a Yard and Ell supposed to have been made about the year 1601. that they are brass rods, very coarsely made, their divisions not exact, and the rods bent, and that, in the year 1742, some members of the Royal society had been at great pains in taking an exact measure of these standards by very curious instruments, prepared by the ingenious Mr. Graham; that the Royal society had had a brass rod made pursuant to their experiments, which was made so accurately, and by persons so skilful and exact that it was thought not easy to obtain a more exact one; and the Committee in fact found it to agree with the standar

 being the quarter of a ton;  
a hogshead and a third make a tierce or third of a ton;  
2 hogsheads make a pipe, butt, or puncheon; and 2 pipes make a ton.  
  
  
There is moreover the Rundlet or Kilderkin containing 2. firkins, peculiar in measure as well as name to the liquids, and the peck of 2 gallons, peculiar in measure and name to the dry substances.  
But no one of these measures is of a determinate capacity. The report of the committee of 1757. 1758 shews that the gallon is of very various content; and that being the Unit, all the others must vary with that. The Gallon and bushel contain  
  
224. and 1792. cubic inches, according to the standard wine gallon preserved at Guildhall:  
231. and 1848. according to the statute of the 5. Anne;  
264.8 and 2118.4 according to the antient Rumford quart of 1228. examined by the committee;  
265.5 and 2124. according to three standard bushels preserved in the Exchequer, to wit, one of H. 7. without a rim, one dated 1091. supposed for 1591. or 1601. and one dated 1601.  
266.25 and 2130. according to the antient Rumford gallon of 1228. examined by the committee.  
268.75 and 2150. according to the Winchester bushel as declared by stat. 13.14.W.3. which has been the model for some of the grain states.  
271. less 2 spoonfuls, and 2168. less 16 spoonfuls, according to a standard gallon of H. 7. and another dated 1601. marked E.E. both in the Exchequer.  
271. and 2168. according to a standard gallon in the Exchequer dated 1601. marked E. and called the corn gallon.  
272. and 2176 according to the 3. standard corn gallons last mentioned, as measured in 1688. by an artist for the Commissioners of the Excise, generally used in the sea-port towns and by mercantile people, and thus introduced into some of the grain states.  
277.18 and 2217.44 as established for the measure of coal by the stat. 12. Anne.  
278. and 2224. according to a standard bushel of H.7. with a copper rim, in the Exchequer.  
278.4 and 2227.2 according to two standard pints of 1601. and 1602. in the Exchequer:  
280. and 2240. according to the standard quart of 1601. in the Exchequer:  
282. and 2256. according to the standard gallon for beer and ale in the Treasury.  
  
There are moreover varieties on these varieties from the barrel to the ton inclusive:  
  
  
  
for if  
the Barrel be  
of Herrings, it must contain 28. gallons by the stat. 13. El. c.11.  
  
  
if  
  
of wine it must contain 31½ gallons by the stat. 2.H.6. c. 11. and 1.R.3.c.15.  
  
  
if  
  
of beer or ale it must contain 34. gallons by the stat. 1. W. &amp; M. c.24.  
  
  
and the higher measures in proportion.  
In those of the U.S. which have not adopted the statutes of W. &amp; M. and of Anne before cited, nor their substance, the wine gallon of 231. cubic inches stands on the authority of very long usage before the 5th. of Anne, the origin and foundation of which are unknown: the Bushel is the Winchester bushel by the 11. H. 7. undefined: and the barrel of ale 32. gallons, and of beer 36. gallons by the stat. 23. H. 8.c.4.  
The Secretary of state is not informed whether there have been any, and what alterations of these measures by the laws of the particular states.  
It is proposed to retain this series of measures, but to fix the gallon to one determinate capacity, as the Unit of measure, both wet and dry; for convenience is in favor of abolishing the distinction even between wet and dry measures.  
The wine gallon, whether of 224 or 231 cubic inches, may be altogether disregarded as concerning principally the wealthy and the mercantile, the least numerous part of the society, and the most capable of reducing one measure to another by calculation. This gallon is little used among the mass of farmers, whose chief habits and interests are in the size of the corn bushel.  
Of the standard measures before stated, two are principally distinguished in authority and practice. The statute bushel of 2150 cubic inches, which gives a gallon of 268.75 cubic inches, and the standard gallon of 1601. called the Corn gallon, of 271. or 272. cubic inches, which has introduced the mercantile bushel of 2176 cubic inches. The former of these is most used in some of the grain states, the latter in others. The middle term of 270. cubic inches may be taken as a mutual compromise of convenience, and as offering this general advantage, tha

ished.  
The Second rod, or the Second pendulum, expressed in the measures of other countries, will give the proportion between their measures and those of the United States.  
Measures, weights and coins thus referred to standards unchangeable in their nature, (as in the length of a rod vibrating seconds, and the weight of a definite mass of rain water) will themselves  be unchangeable. These standards too are such as to be accessible to all persons, in all times and places. The measures and weights derived from them fall in so nearly with some of those now in use, as to facilitate their introduction; and being arranged in decimal ratio, they are within the calculation of every one who possesses the first elements of arithmetic, and easy of comparison both for foreigners and citizens with the measures, weights, and coins of other countries.  
A gradual introduction might perhaps lessen the inconveniences which might attend too sudden a substitution, even of an easier for a more difficult system. After a given term, for instance, it might begin in the Customhouses, where the merchants would become familiarised to it. After a further term, it might be introduced into all legal proceedings, and merchants and traders in foreign commodities might be required to use it in their dealings with one another. After a still further term, all other descriptions of people might receive it into common use. Too long a postponement, on the other hand, would increase the difficulties of it’s reception, wit

Some years after, in the able report made by Mr. Jefferson, then Secre-  
tary of State, (under the Constitution of 1787,) to Congress, in 1790, it  
was observed :—“ The experiment made by Congress, in 1786, by declar-  
ing that there should be one money of account and payment through the  
United States, and that its parts and multiplies should be in a decimal  
ratio, has obtained such general approbation, both at home and abroad,  
that nothing seems wanting but the actual coinage to banish the discord-  
ant pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings of the different States, and to  
establish in their stead the new denominations.”  
  
All this goes to show how well this matter was understood, even at  
that early period, by our leading statesmen—a circumstance the more  
creditable to them, as it was at a period anterior to the celebrated labors  
of the French Academy, by order of the Convention, which resulted in  
that perfect decimation of the coins, weights, and measures of France,  
which has been so much admired and so extensively imitated by othe
