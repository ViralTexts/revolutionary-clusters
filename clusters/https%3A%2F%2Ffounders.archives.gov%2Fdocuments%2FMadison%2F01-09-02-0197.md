ce of perjury?  
I am glad to find that you are turning your thoughts towards the business of May next. My despair of your finding the necessary leisure as signified in one of your letters, with the probability that some leading propositions at least would be expected from Virga. had engaged me in a closer attention to the subject than I should otherwise have given. I will just hint the ideas which have occurred, leaving explanations for our interview.  
I think with you that it will be well to retain as much as possible of the old Confederation, tho’ I doubt whether it may not be best to work the valuable articles into the new System, instead of engrafting the latter on the former. I am also perfectly of your opinion that in framing a system, no material sacrifices ought to be made to local or temporary prejudices. An explanatory address must of necessity accompany the result of the Convention on the main object. I am not sure that it will be practicable to present the several parts of the reform in so detached a manner to the States as that a partial adoption will be binding. Particular States may view the different articles as conditions of each other, and would only ratify them as such. Others might ratify them as independent propositions. The consequence would be that the ratification of both would go for nothing. I have not however examined this point thoroughly. In truth my ideas of a reform strike so deeply at the old Confederation, and lead to such a systematic change, that they scarcely admit of the expedient.  
I hold it for a fundamental point that an individual independence of the States, is utterly irreconcileable with the idea of an aggregate sovereignty. I think at the same time that a consolidation of the States into one simple republic is not less unattainable than it would be inexpedient. Let it be tried then whether any middle ground can be taken which will at once support a due supremacy of the national authority, and leave in force the local authorities so far as they can be subordinately useful.  
The first step to be taken is I think a change in the principle of representation. According to the present form of the Union, an equality of suffrage if not just towards the larger members of it, is at least safe to them, as the liberty they exercise of rejecting or executing the acts of Congress, is uncontroulable by the nominal sovereignty of Congress. Under a system which would operate without the intervention of the States, the case would be materially altered. A vote from Delaware would have the same effect as one from Massts. or Virga.  
Let the national Government be armed with a positive &amp; compleat authority in all cases where uniform measures are necessary. As in trade &amp;c. &amp;c. Let it also retain the powers which it now possesses.  
Let it have a negative in all cases whatsoever on the Legislative Acts of the States as the K. of G. B. heretofore had. This I conceive to be essential and the least possible abridgement of the State Soveriegnties. Without such a defensive power, every positive power that can be given on paper will be unavailing. It will also give internal stability to the States. There has been no moment since the peace at which the federal assent wd have been given to paper money &amp;c. &amp;c.  
Let this national supremacy be extended also to the Judiciary departmt. If the judges in the last resort depend on the States &amp; are bound by their oaths to them and not to the Union, the intention of the law and the interests of the nation may be defeated by the obsequiousness of the Tribunals to the policy or prejudices of the States. It seems at least essential that an appeal should lie to some national tribunals in all cases which concern foreigners, or inhabitants of other States. The admiralty jurisdiction may be fully submitted to the national Government.  
The supremacy of the whole in the Executive department seems

ded into two branches: One of them to be chosen every  years by the Legislatures or the people at large; the other to consist of a more select number, holding their appointments for a longer term and going out in rotation. Perhaps the negative on the State laws may be most conveniently lodged in this branch. A Council of Revision may be superadded, including the great ministerial officers.  
A National Executive will also be necessary. I have scarcly venturd to form my own opinion yet either of the manner in which it ought to be constituted or of the authorities with which it ought [to be] cloathed.  
An article ought to be inserted expressly guarantying the tranquility of the States agst. internal as well as external dangers.

, The objections drawn from this source are to be laid aside. I flatter myself however that they may be less formidable on trial than in contemplation. The change in the principle of representation will be relished by a majority of the States, and those too of most influence. The Northern States will be reconciled to it by the actual superiority of their populousness: the Southern by their expected superiority in this point.

the existing confederation of inde-  
pendent States; the proportional vote  
of the States in both branches of the  
national Legislature, instead of the  
equal vote, allowed in the Congress of  
the Confederation ; and the negative by  
the national Government on the acts  
of the States, to be exercised through  
the legislative departments as well as  
the judiciary.  
  
In regard to the first and second of  
these points, Mr. Madison remarks in  
the letter to Randolph, above alluded  
to, that “ he holds it for a fundamental  
point, that an individual independence  
of the States is utterly irreconcilable  
with the idea of an aggregate sover-  
eignty. “I think,” says he, “at the  
same time, that a consolidation of the  
States into one single republic is not  
more unattainable, than it would be ex-  
pedient. Let it be tried then, whether  
any middle ground can be taken, which  
will at once support a due supremacy  
of the national authority, and leave in  
force the local authorities, so far as  
they can be subordinately useful. The  
first step to be taken is, I think, a  
change in the principle of representa-  
tion. According to the present form  
of the Union, an equality of suffrage,  
if not just towards the larger members  
of it, is, at least, safe to them, as the  
liberty they exercise of rejecting or ex-  
ecuting the acts of Congress, is un-  
controllable by the nominal sovereign-  
  
of the Constitution.

ty of Congress. Under a _ system  
which would operate without the in-  
tervention of the States, the case would  
be materially altered. A vote from  
Delaware would have the same effect  
as one from Massachusetts or Virgi-  
nia.” “* Letithave a negative,” con-  
tinues Mr. Madison, “in ad/ cases what-  
soever, on the legislative acts of the  
States, as the King of Great Britain  
heretofore had.” This I conceive to be  
essential to the least possible abridg-  
ment of the State sovereignties. W ith-  
out sucha defensive power, every posi-  
tive power, that can be given on paper,  
will be unavailing. It will also give  
internal stability to the States. There  
has been no moment since the peace,  
when the Federal assent would have  
been given to paper money, &amp;c. Let  
this national supremacy be extended  
also to the judiciary department. If  
the judges in the last resort depend on  
the States, and are bound by their oaths  
to them and not the Union, the inten-  
tion of the law and the interests of the  
nation may be defeated by the ob-  
sequiousness of the tribunals to the  
policy or prejudices of the States. It  
seems, at least, essential that an ap-  
peal should lie to some national tri-  
  
bunals in all cases which concern  
foreigners, or inhabitants of other  
States.”  
  
In regard to the proposed negative  
by the General Government upon the  
acts of the State Legislatures, Mr.  
Madison remarks, in the Introduction  
to the Debates, that “the feature in

t in the Legislature no

But Madison, who, perhaps, did more in  
originating the Constitution and our National  
Government than any other man, has left on  
record the ideas he had formed of the necessary  
supremacy of the General Government, to be I  
embodied in the Constitution—ideas formed  
and communicated to others previous to the  
meeting of the Convention appointed by the  
States to frame it.  
The following extracts from Mr. Madison&#x27;s  
letter of April Bth, 1787, to Edmund Randolph,  
[Vide the Madison papers, vol. 2, p. 631 et sc g] !  
are interesting just now :  
In truth, my ideas of a reform strike so  
deeply at the old Confederation, and lead to  
such a systematic change, that they scarcely  
admit of the expedient.  
I hold it for a fundamental point, that an  
individual independence of the States is utter­  
ly irreconcilable with the idea of an aggregate  
sovereignty. I think, at the same time that a  
consolidation of the States into one simple re­  
public is not less unattainable than it would  
be inexpedient. Let it be tried, then, whether  
any middle ground can be taken, which will at  
once support a due supremacy of the national  
authority, and leave in force the local authori­  
ties so far as they can be subordinately useful.  
An article ought to be inserted expressly

against internal as well as external dangers.  
To give the new system its proper energy,  
it will be desirable to have it ratified by the  
authority of the people, and not merely by  
that of the Legislatures.  
It is already seen by many, and must by de­  
grees be seen by all, that, unless the Union be

temporary prejudices. An explanatory  
address must of necessity accompany  
the result of the Convention on the

that an individual independence of the  
states is utterly irreconcilable with the  
idea of aggregate sovereignty. I think,  
at the same time, that a consolidation  
of the states into a simple republic is  
not less attainable than it would be
