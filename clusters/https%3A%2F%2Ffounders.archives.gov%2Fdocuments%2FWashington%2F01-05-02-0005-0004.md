Elizabeth Stoughton, a daughter of Col. John Stoughton of Windsor, Conn., had married Oliver Wolcott, Jr., in 1785 when he was state comptroller for Connecticut. When GW appointed him auditor of the treasury in Sept. 1789 Wolcott accepted the offer only after repeated urgings from his friends; his reluctance stemmed not only from disappointment at not receiving the post of comptroller of the treasury but also from an apprehension that the salary was not adequate for living expenses in New York City. However, hoping that the “example of the President and his family, will render parade and expense improper and disreputable,” he accepted, and the Wolcotts arrived in New York early in November. They were unable to find a house and at this time were lodging at Mrs. Grinnell’s, No. 27 Queen Street (Wolcott to Elizabeth Wolcott, 24 Sept. 1789; Wolcott to Oliver Wolcott, Sr., 3 Nov. 1789, GIBBS [2]George Gibbs.

 militia, A Letter on the Subject of an Established Militia, was published in 1784. GW also had access to lengthy statements on a peace establishment prepared by Knox, 17 April 1783, and Steuben, 15, 21 April 1783 (DLC:GW), and sent to the commander-in-chief in preparation for his own report of 1 May 1783 to the military committee of Congress. GW’s written comments on the militia and his letter to Knox (see  
  
	   entries for 19 and 21 Dec. 1789) have not been found, but at least some of his suggestions were incorporated by Knox into a Jan. 1790 report to Congress on the militia. On 18 Jan. 1790 Knox wrote GW that “Having submitted to your consideration a plan for the arrangement of the militia of the United States, which I had presented to the late Congress, and you having approved the general principles thereof, with certain exceptions, I now respectfully lay the same before you, modified according to the alterations you were pleased to suggest.” GW transmitted Knox’s letter and report to Congress, 21 Jan. 1790.

Oliver Wolcott, then a brilliant young man of thirty, was appointed  
auditor of the treasury, and his salary was, like that of Randolph, $1,500 a  
year. Oliver Ellsworth furnished him with an estimate of the cost of  
living in New York, and remarked that he could keep his expenses within  
$1,000 per annum, unless he should change his style, which was wholly  
unnecessary. Wolcott, on reaching New York, wrote to his wife: “ The  
example of the President and his family will render parade and expense  
improper and disreputable. We can live as retired or as much in the  
world as we choose.” In December following he wrote to his mother:  
“We have not been able to hire a house, and shall continue in lodgings  
until spring.”
