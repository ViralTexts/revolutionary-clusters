ConfidentialDear Sir  
Mount Vernon 15th Jany 1799  
  
At the threshold of this letter, I ought to make an apology for its contents; but if you will give me credit for my motives, I will contend for no more, however erroneous my sentiments may appear to you.  
It would be a waste of time, to attempt to bring to the view of a person of your observation &amp; discernment, the endeavors of a certain party among us, to disquiet the Public mind with unfounded alarms; to arraign every act of the Administration; to set the People at varience with their Government; and to embarrass all its measures. Equally useless would it be, to predict what must be the inevitable consequences of such policy, if it cannot be arrested.  
Unfortunately, and extremely do I regret it, the State of Virginia has taken the lead in this opposition. I have said the State Because the conduct of its Legislature in the Eyes of the World, will authorise the expression; because it is an incontrovertable fact, that the principle leaders of the opposition dwell in it; and because no doubt is entertained, I believe, that with the help of the Chiefs in other States, all the plans are arranged; and systematically pursued by their followers in other parts of the Union; though in no State except Kentucky (that I have heard of) has Legislative countenance been obtained, beyond Virginia.  
  
It has been said, that the great mass of the Citizens of this State are well affected, notwithstanding, to the General Government, and the Union; and I am willing to believe it—nay do believe it: but how is this to be reconciled with their suffrages at the Elections of Representatives; both to Congress &amp; their State Legislature; who are men opposed to the first, and by the tendency of their measures would destroy the latter? Some among us, have endeavored to account for this inconsistency and though convinced themselves, of its truth, they are unable to convince others; who are unacquainted with the internal polity of the State.  
One of the reasons assigned is, that the most respectable, &amp; best qualified characters among us, will not come forward. Easy &amp; happy in their circumstances at home, and believing themselves secure in their liberties &amp; property, will not forsake them, or their occupations, and engage in the turmoil of public business; or expose themselves to the calumnies of their opponents, whose weapons are detraction.  
But at such a crisis as this, when every thing dear &amp; valuable to us is assailed; when this Party hang upon the Wheels of Government as a dead weight, opposing every measure that is calculated for defence &amp; self preservation; abetting the nefarious views of another Nation, upon our Rights; prefering, as long as they durst contend openly against the spirit &amp; resentment of the People, the interest of France to the Welfare of their own Country; justifying the first at the expence of the latter: When every Act of their own Government is tortured by constructions they will not bear, into attempts to infringe &amp; trample upon the Constitution with a view to introduce Monarchy; When the most unceasing, &amp; purest exertions were making, to maintain a Neutrality which had been proclaimed by the Executive, approved unequivocally by Congress, by the State Legislatures, nay by the People themselves, in various meetings; and to preserve the Country in Peace, are charged as a measure calculated to favor Great Britain at the expence of France, and all those who had any agency in it, are accused of being under the influence of the former, and her Pensioners; When measures are systematically, and pertenaciously pursued, which must eventually dissolve the Union or produce coertion. I say, when these things have become so obvious, ought characters who are best able to rescue their Country from the pending evil to remain at home? rather, ought they not to come forward, and by  
  
their talents and influence, stand in the breach wch such conduct has made on the Peace and happiness of this Country, and oppose the widening of it?  
Vain will it be to look for Peace and happiness, or for the security of liberty or property, if Civil discord should ensue; and what else can result from the policy of those among us, who, by all the means in their power, are driving matters to extremity, if they cannot be counteracted effectually? The views of Men can only be known, or guessed at, by their words or actions. Can those of the Leaders of Opposition be mistaken then, if judged by this Rule? That they are followed by numbers who are unacquainted with their designs, and suspect as little, the tendency of their principles, I am fully persuaded—But, if their conduct is viewed with indifference; if there is activity and misrepresentation on one side, and supiness on the other; their numbers, accumulated by Intrieguing, and discontented foreigners under proscription, who were at war with their own governments, and the greater part of them with all Government, their numbers will encrease, &amp; nothing, short of Omniscience, can foretel the consequences.  
I come now, my good Sir, to the object of my letter—which is—to express a hope, and an earnest wish, that you wd come forward at the ensuing Elections (if not for Congress, which you may think would take you too long from home) as a candidate for representation, in the General Assembly of this Commonwealth.  
There are, I have no doubt, very many sensible men who oppose themselves to the torrent that carries away others, who had rather swim with, than stem it, without an able Pilot to conduct them—but these are neither old in Legislation, nor well known in the Community. Your weight of character and influence in the Ho. of Representatives would be a bulwark against such dangerous Sentiments as are delivered there at present. It would be a rallying point for the timid, and an attraction of the wavering. In a word, I conceive it to be of immense importance at this Crisis that you should be there; and I would fain hope that all minor considerations will be made to yield to the measure.  
If I have erroneously supposed that your sentiments on these subjects are in unison with mine; or if I have assumed a liberty which the occasion does not warrant, I must conclude as I began, with praying that my motives may be received as an apology; and that my fear, that the tranquillity of the Union, and of this State in  
  
particular, is hastening to an awful crisis, have extorted them from me. With great, and very sincere regard and respect, I am—Dear Sir Your Most Obedt &amp; Very Hble Servt  
  
Go: Washington

“ Mount-Vernon, Jan. 15, 1799.  
Dear Srp,  
  
* At the threshold of this letter, I ought  
to make an apology for its contents; but if  
you will give me credit for my motives, I  
will contend for no more, however errone-  
ous my sentiments may appear&#x27;to you. It  
would be a waste of time to attempt to bring  
to the view of a person of your observation  
and discernment, the endeavors of a certain  
party among us, to disquiet the public mind  
with unfounded alarms; to arraign every  
act of the administration ; to set the people  
at variance with their government, and to  
embarrass all its measures. Equally use-  
less would it be to predict what must be  
the inevitable consequences of such policy,  
if it cannot be arrested. Unfortunately,  
and extremely do I regret it, the state of  
Virginia has taken the lead in this opposi-  
tion. Ihave said the state, because the  
conduct of its legislature, in the eyes of the  
workl, will authorise the expression—be-  
cause it is an incontrovertible fact, that the  
principal leaders of the opposition dwell in  
it and because no doubt is entertained, I be-  
lieve, that with the..help of the chiefs in  
other states, all the plans are arranged ;  
and systematically pursued by their follow-  
crs in other parts of the union, though in  
no state, except Kentucky, that I have  
heard of, has legislative countenance been  
obtained, beyond Virginia. It has been  
said, that the great mass of the citizens of

and I am willing to believe it—nay, do  
believe it: But how is this to be reconciled  
with their suffrages at the elections of rep-  
resentatives, both to Congress and their  
state legislature, who are men opposed to  
the first, and, by the of their  
measures, would destroy the latter? Some  
among us have endeavored to account for  
this inconsistency, and though convinced  
themselves of its truth, they are una-  
ble to convince others, who are umnac-  
quainted with the internal policy of the  
state. One of the reasons assigned, is,  
that the most respectable and best qualified  
characters among us, will not come forward.  
Easy and happy in their circumstances at  
home, and believing themselves secure. in  
their liberty and property, will not forsake  
them or their occupations, and engage in

themselves to the calumnies of their oppo-

measure that is calculated for defence and  
self-preservation ; and abetting the nefari-  
ous views of another nation upon our rights ;  
preferring, as long as they durst contend  
openly against the spirit and resentment of  
the people, the interest of France to the  
welfare of their own country; justifying  
the first at the expence of the latter: When  
every act of their own government is tor-  
tured, by constructions they will not bear,  
into attempts to infringe and trample upon  
the constitution, with a view to introduce  
monarchy: When the most unceasing and  
purest exertions were making to maintain  
a neutrality which had been proclaimed by  
the executive, approved uneqivocally by  
Congress, by the state legislatures, nay by  
the people themselves, in various meetings ;  
and to preserve the country in peace, are  
charged as a measure calculated to favor  
Great-Britain at the expence of France ;  
and all those who had an agency in it, are  
accused of being under-the influence of the  
former, and her pensioners: When meas-  
ures are systematically and pertinaciously  
pursued, which must eventually dissolve  
the union, or produce coercion: I Say,  
when these things have become obvious,

It would be a waste of time to attempt

the public mind with unfounded alarms)  
to arraicn every act of the udministration j

because the conduct of its legislature,

una quarnted with the internal policy  
the state. One ofthe reasons assigned  
is, that the most respectable per best  
qualfied characters amos us, Wi —  
come forward. Easy and happy in thefr  
circumstances at home, and belteving  
themselves secure iD their liberty and  
property, they il not forsake ey ot  
their occupations, and cayoge 10 ‘ ve -t0 .  
moil of public bus&#x27;ness , re expose them.  
selves to the catummies of their opponents  
whose weapens are detraction. But at  
such a crisis as this, when every thing  
dear and valuable to us &#x27;s assailed ; when  
ums party hang upon the wheels of gow  
ernment a8 a dead weight opposing every  
mewsure that is calculsted for defence and  
seif preservation ; and abetting the netu-  
rious views of another ation upon our  
rights, preferring as long as they durst  
cuntend openly against the spumt and re-  
  
aenimnent of the people, the interest of  
  
FRANCE to the welfare of their OWN  
COUNTRY; justifying the first at the  
expence of the /atrer; when every act of  
their own government is tortured. by con-  
structions they will not bear, into attempts  
to infrmge and trample upon the consti-  
tution, with a view to introduce monarchy :  
When the most unceasing and purest ex-  
ertions were making to maintaina pBeu-  
trality which had been proclaimed by the  
executive, approved unmequivocaliy by  
Congress, by the state legislature, nay,  
by the people themselves, in various meet-  
ings, and to preserve the country i peace,  
are charged as @ measure calculated to  
favor Great-Britain at the ezxfience of  
France ; and all those who had an agen-  
cy in it, are accused of being under the  
wiuence of the former and her pension-  
ers; When measures are systematically  
und pertinaciously pursued, which must  
eventually dissolve the union, or froduce  
coercion; I say, When these things have  
become vubvious. ought characters who  
are best uble to rescue their country from  
the pending evil, to remain at home?  
Rather ought they not to come forward  
aud by thew taleats and influcnce, stand  
in the breach such conduct has made, on  
the peace and happiness of this country,  
and oppose the widening of it! Vain will  
it be to look for peace and happiness, or  
for the security of liberty or property. if  
CIVIL DISCORD should ensue, and  
what else coun result from the policy of  
those among us, Who vy all means in their  
&#x27; power, are driving matters to exiremity,  
if they cannot be counteracted effectually ?  
The views of men can only be known or  
guessed at by their words or actions ; can  
those of the leaders of opposition be mis-  
taken, then, if judged by this rule? “ That  
they are followed by numbcrs, who are  
unacquainted with their designs, and sus-  
pect us little the tendency of their prin-  
ciples, 1 am fully persuaded.” But ‘f  
their conduct is viewed with iad ference ;  
if there is activity and miisrepresentation,  
on one side, and sup:neness on the other ;  
their nuuibers accumulated by intriguing  
and discontented foreigners under pro-  
scription, Who were at war with their own  
vovernment, and the greater part of them  
with aff government, their number will  
increase, and nothing short of omniscience  
ean foretell the consequences. *

It has been said that the great mass of the citizens of  
this State Virginial are well affected, notwithatanding  
to the General Government of the Union; andI am will­  
ing to believe it--nay, do beliexe it, but how is this to he  
reSonciled with theif choice of Representatives, both to  
Congress and their State Legislature, who are opposel  
to llie General Government, and who, by the tendensy  
of their measures, would destroy the Union? Soms  
among us have endeavored to account for this inconsist.  
ency, but, though convinced themseives, they are un  
able to cons ince others, unacquainted with the internal  
policy of the State.  
&quot;One of the reasons assigned is that the moat re  
spectable and best-qualified characters among us will  
not come forward. Easy and happy in their circum.  
stances at home, and believing themselves secure in  
their liberties and propety, they will not forsake their  
occupations, and engage in the turmoil of public bus­  
ness, or eaxpose themselves to the calumnles of thei  
opponents, whose weapons are detraction,  
But at such a crisis as this, when everything dew  
and valuable to us is assailed; when  
measures are systematically and pertinaclously pussuef  
which must eventually dissolve the Union or produce  
coercion. I say, when these things have become so ob­  
vious, ought characters who are best able to reseus  
their country from the pending evil to remain at home!  
Kather, ought they not to come forward, and by their  
talents and influence stand in the breach which such  
conduct has made on the peace and happiness of this  
country and oppose the widening of it!  
There are, I have no doubt, very many sensibl  
men who oppose themselves to the torrent, that carries  
away others who had rather swim with than stem it  
without an able pilot to conduct them, but these ars  
neither old in legislation nor well known in the comme­  
nity. Your weight of character and influence in thi  
House of Representatives would be a bulwark againsd  
such dangerous sentiments as are delivered there at  
present. It would be a rallying point for the timid anf  
an attraction for the wavering. In a word, I conceire  
it to be of immense importance, at this crisis, that you  
should be there; and I would fain hope that all minor  
considerations will be made to yield.  
The appeal thus made by Washington to Henry  
was not in vain. That aged patriot entered zealous­  
ly into the canvass; but his death, which occurred  
within a short time of that of Washington, speedily  
deprived the country of his services. But, though  
leng since dead, these patriots still speak to us  
and, as they devoted the last remnant of their lives  
to the strenuous resistance of a demagognic party  
which rested itself on the double support of threats  
of disunion and of calumnious charges agains
