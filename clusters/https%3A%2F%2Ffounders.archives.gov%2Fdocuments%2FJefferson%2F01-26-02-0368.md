4. giving medals and marks of distinction to several Indians:  
5. meddling with the affairs of such as are allies of Spain:  
6. not using efficacious means to prevent these proceedings.  
I shall make short observations on these charges.  
1. Were the 1st. true, it would not be unjustifiable. The Creeks have now a second time commenced against us a wanton and unprovoked war, and the present one in the face of a recent Treaty, and of the most friendly and charitable Offices on our part. There would be nothing out of the common course of proceeding then, for us to engage allies, if we needed any for their punishment. But we neither need, nor have sought them. The fact itself is utterly false, and we defy the world to produce a single proof of it. The declaration of war by the Chickasaws, as we are informed, was a very sudden thing, produced by the murder of some of their people by a party of Creeks, and produced so instantaneously as to give nobody time to interfere either to promote or prevent a rupture. We had, on the contrary most particularly exhorted that nation to preserve peace, because in truth we have a most particular friendship for them. This will be evident from a copy of the message of the President to them, among the papers now enclosed.  
2d. The Gift of provisions was but an act of that friendship to them, when in the same distress, which had induced us to give five times as much to the less friendly nation of the Creeks.—But we have given arms to them. We believe it is the practice of every white nation to give arms to the neighboring Indians. The agents of Spain have done it abundantly, and we suppose not out of their own pockets, and this for purposes of avowed hostility on us, and they have been liberal in promises of further supplies. We have given a few arms to a very friendly Tribe, not to make war on Spain, but to defend themselves from the atrocities  of a vastly more numerous and powerful people, and one, which by a series of unprovoked and even unrepelled attacks on us, is obliging us to look towards war as the only means left of curbing their insolence.  
3. We are aiming, as is pretended, at an establishment on the Missisippi, at the Ecores amargas. Considering the measures of this nature with which Spain i

ction of the latter, are we to understand from this that if we arm to repel the attacks of the Creeks, on ourselves, it will disturb our peace with Spain? That if we will not fold our arms and let them butcher us without resistance, Spain will consider it as a cause of war? This is, indeed, so serious an intimation that the President has thought it could no longer be treated with subordinate Characters, but that his sentiments should be conveyed to the Government of Spain itself, through you.  
We love and we value peace: we know it’s blessings from experience. We abhor the follies of war, and are not untried in it’s distresses and calamities. Unmeddling with the affairs of other nations, we had hoped that our distance and our dispositions would have left us free in the example and indulgence of peace with all the world. We had, with sincere and particular dispositions courted and cultivated the friendship of Spain. We have made to it great sacrifices of time and interest, and were disposed to believe she would see her interests also in a perfect coalition and good understanding with us. Cherishing still the same sentiments, we have chosen, in the present instance, to ascribe the intimations in this letter to the particular character of the writers, displayed in the peculiarity of the style of their communications; and, therefore, we have removed the cause from them to their sovereign, in whose justice and love of peace we have Confidence. If we are disappointed in this appeal, if we are to be forced into a contrary order of things, our Mind is made up. We shall meet it with firmness. The necessity of our position, will supercede all appeal to calculation, now as it has done heretofore. We confide in our own strength, without boasting of it; we respect that of others, without fearing it. If we cannot otherwise prevail on the Creeks to discontinue their depredations, we will attack them in force. If Spain chuses to consider our self—defence against savagebutchery as a cause of war to her, we must meet her also in war, with regret, but without fear; and we shall be happier to the last moment to repair with her to the tribunal of peace and reason.  
  
The President charges you to communicate the contents of this letter to the Court of Madrid, with all the temperance and delicacy, which the dignity and character of that Court, render proper; but with all the firmness and selfrespect, which befit a nation conscious of it’s rectitude, and settled in it’s purpose.

text of the resolutions adopted at the Cuban  
meeting last night:  
Resolved, that the people of the United  
States look to the “Great Soldier” who now  
presides over our government to take prompt  
and decisive action, consistent with the dignity  
and past precedents of our government;  
that we adopt the language of Thomas Jeffer­  
son in 1796, when as Secretary of State he  
wrote to the Spanish representative in regard  
to the outrages committed by the Creek Indians  
in the Spanish territory of Florida upon  
American citizens: “If we are disappointed  
in this appeal—if we are to be forced into a  
contrary order of things—-our mind is made up.  
We shall meet it with firmness. The neces­  
sity of our position will supercede all appeal  
to calculation, as it has done heretofore. We  
confide iq onr strength without boasting of it;  
we respect that of others without fearing it  
If we cannot otherwise prevail on the Creeks  
to discontinue their depredations, we will at­  
tack them in force. If Spain chooses to con­  
sider our defence against butchery as a cause  
of war to her, we must meet her also in war,  
with regret but without fear.”

respect to the charge of exciting the  
Chickasaws to war against the Creeks,  
it was denied; but if it were true, said  
the Secretary of State, Mr. Jefferson,  
it would not be unjustifiable. The  
Creeks, said he, have now a second  
time commenced against us a wanton  
and unprovoked war; and the present  
one in the face of a recent treaty, and  
of the most friendly and charitable  
offices on our part. There would be  
nothing then out of the common course  
of proceedings, for us to engage others,  
if we needed any for their punishment.  
But we neither need nor, have sought  
them. The fact itself is utterly false,  
and we defy the world to produce a  
single proof of it. The declaration  
of war by the Chickasaws as we are  
informed was a very Buddn thing,  
produced by the murder of some of  
their people by a party of Creeks, and  
produced so instantaneously, as to give  
nobody lime to interfere, either to  
promote or to prevent a rupture. The  
gift of provisions was but an act of  
fr ieudship to them when in the same  
distress, which bad induced us to giye  
Ove times as much to tbe less friendly  
nation of the Creeks. We have given  
arms to them. It is the practice of  
every white nation to give arms to the  
neighboring Indians. The agents of  
Spain have done it abundantly, and  
this for the purpose of avowed hostiltv  
on us. And they have been liberal in  
promises of further supplies. We have  
given a few arms to a very friendly  
tribe, not to make war on Spain, but  
to defend themselves from the atroci­  
ties of a vastly more numerous and  
powerful people, and one which by a  
series of unprovoked and even unre-  
pelled attacks on us, in obliging us to  
look towards war as the only means  
left of curbing their insolence. Tbe  
design to make an establishment on  
the Mississippi was denied, and the  
interference of the Spaniards with the

Spain to control the navigation of the Mis-  
sissippi, he wrote by way of instruction to  
the commissioners sent to Spain to nego-  
tiate a treaty on the subject as follows:  
  
We love and we value peace; we know its  
blessings from experience; unmeddling with the  
affairs of other nations, we had hoped that our  
distance and dispositions would have left us free  
in the example and indulgence of peace with all  
the world. We had with sincere and particular  
dispositions courted and cultivated the friendship  
of Spain. Cherishing the same sentiments, we  
have chosen to ascribe the unfriendly insinua-  
tions of the Spanish commissioners, in their in-  
tercourse with the government of the United  
States, to the peculiar character of the writers,  
and to remove the cause from them to their sov-  
ereign, in whose justice and love of peace we  
have confidence. If we are disappointed in this  
appeal, if we are to be forced into a contrary  
order of things. our mind is made up; we shail  
meet it with firmness. The necessity of our posi-  
tion will supersede all appeal to calculation now.  
as it bas done heretofore, We confide in our  
own strength, without boasting of it; we respect  
that of others, without fearing it. If Spain  
chooses to consider our self-defense against sav-  
age butchery as a cause of war to her. we must  
meet her also in war, with regret but without  
fear; and we shall be happier to the last moment  
to repair with her to the tribunal of peace and rea-  
  
son.  
  
Armed with such instructions as these  
our commissioners of nearly a century ago  
brought Spain to a recognition of our rights.

In the negotiations for the treaty of  
1795, Jefferson, then Secretary of State,  
put on record a principle which, with few  
exceptions, has ever since been observed.  
He declared that ‘‘we should have no-  
thing to do with conquest,” and that  
‘*we had with sincere and particular dis-  
position courted and cultivated the friend-  
ship of Spain.” The treaty was obtained,  
but friendship was severely strained by  
Spanish captures of American merchant-  
men, and by American claims to West  
Florida; not till 1821 was the danger of  
war finally relieved by the cession of the  
Floridas. From that time, notwithstand-  
ing the contrast in the habits and aims of  
the two nations, there has been but one  
serious cause of controversy with Spain  
—Cuba; and for many years the United  
States avoided an issue on that question  
by standing virtually as the guarantor  
of the Spanish dominion of the islan
