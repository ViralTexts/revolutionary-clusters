Altho’ the Legislature of Virginia declared at a late Session almost unanimously, that S. Carolina was not  
supported in her doctrine of nullification by the Resolutions of 1798, it appears that those Resolutions are still  
appealed to as expressly or constructively favoring the doctrine  
That the doctrine of nullification may be clearly understood, it must be taken as laid down in the Report of  
a Special Committee of the House of Representatives of S. C. in 1828. In that document it is asserted, that a single State  
has a Constitutional right, to arrest the execution of a law of the U. S. within its limits; that the arrest is to be  
presumed right &amp; valid, and is to remain in forc

its parentage? It is found in the 3d. of the Resolutions of -98. which is in the following words.  
&quot;that in case of a deliberate, a palpable &amp; dangerous exercise of powers not granted by the

to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, &amp; for maintaining within their respective limits, the

once be seen. The resolution is in  
the following words.  
  
&quot;That the good people of the commonwealth having ever felt and continuing to feel the most sincere affection to their  
brethren of the other states, the truest anxiety for establishing and perpetuating the union of all, and the most  
scrupulous fidelity to that Constitution which is the pledge of mutual friendship and the instrument of mutual happiness,  
the General Assembly doth solemnly appeal to the like dispositions in the other states, in confidence that they will  
concur with this commonwealth in declaring, as it does hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid are unconstitutional, and  
that the necessary and proper measures will be taken by each for co-operating with this state in maintaining unimpaired  
the authorities, rights, and liberties reserved in the states respectively or to the people.&quot;  
Here it distinctly appears as in the 3d Resoln., that the course contemplated by the Legislature, &quot;for  
maintaining the authorities, rights, &amp; liberties, reserved to the States respectively,&quot; was not a solitary or separate interposition, but a co-operation in the means necessary &amp; proper for the purpose.&quot;

he collective meaning of the term, gives consistency &amp; effect to the reasoning  
&amp; the object.  
But besides this general evidence that the Report in the invariable use of the plural term States, withheld from a single State, the right expressed in the Resoln. a still more precise  
and decisive inference, to the same effect, is afforded by several passages in the document.  
Thus the Report observes &quot;The States then being the parties to the Constl. Compact, and in their highest  
sovereign Capacity, it follows of necessity, that there can be no tribunal above their authy,  
to decide in the last resort, whether the Compact made by them be violated; and consequently  
that as the parties to it, they must themselves decide in the last resort such questions as may  
be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition&quot;.  
Now apart from the palpable insufficiency of an interposition by a single State, to effect the declared  
object of the interposition namely, to maintain authorities &amp; rights which must be the same in all the States, it  
is not true that there would be no tribunal above the authority of a State, as a single party; the aggregate authority of  
the parties being a tribunal above it to decide in the last resort.  
Again, the language of the Report is, &quot;If the deliberate exercise of dangerous powers palpably witheld by the  
Constitution could not justify the parties to it, in interposing even so far as to arrest the progress of the evil,  
&amp; thereby preserve the Constitun. itself as well as to provide for the safety of the parties to it, there wd. be  
an end to all relief from usurped power&quot;—apply here the interposing power to a single State, and it would not be true  
that there wd. be no relief from usurped power. A sure &amp; adequate relief would exist in the interposition of the  
States, as the co-parties to the Constitution, with a  
power paramount to the Constn. itself.  
  
&quot;But, (continues the Report) it is *objected that the Judicial authy. is to be regarded as the sole expositor  
of the Constn. in the last resort&quot;. In answering this objection the Report observes that &quot;However true it may be that the  
Judicial Dept. is in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the Constn. to decide in the last resort, this resort  
must neessarily not be the last—in relation to the rights of the parties to the Constl.  
compact from which, the Judicial as well as the other Departments hold their delegated trusts.

 The  
amount of this modified right of nullification is, that a single State may arrest the operation of a law of the U. S. and  
institute a process which is to terminate in the ascendancy of a minority over a large majority, in a Republican System,  
the characteristic rule of which is that the major will is the prevailing ruling will. And this newfangled theory is attempted to be  
fathered on Mr. Jefferson, the apostle of Republicanism, and whose own words declare that &quot;acquiescence in the decision of  
the majority is the vital principle of it.&quot; See his inaugural address.  
Well might Virga. declare as her Legislature did by a Resolution of 183 that her Resolutions of 98-99,  
gave no support to the nullifying doctrine of S. C. And well may the friends of Mr. J—n disclaim any sanction to it or to  
any Constitutional right of nullification from his opinions. His
