tis time alone that can ameliorate the pangs of humanity, &amp; soften its woes.  
To the wearied traveller who sees a resting place, and is bending his body to lean thereon, I now compare myself; but to be suffered to do this in peace, is I perceive too much, to be endured by some. To misrepresent my motives; to reprobate my politics; and to weaken the confidence which has been reposed in my administration—are objects which cannot be relinquished by those who, will be satisfied with nothing short of a change in our political System. The consolation however, which results from conscious rectitude, and the approving voice of my Country—unequivocally expressed by its Representatives—deprives their sting of its poison, and places in the same point of view both the weakness, and malignity of their efforts.  
Although the prospect of retirement is most grateful to my soul, and I have not a wish to mix again in the great world, or to partake in its politics, yet, I am not without my regrets at parting with (perhaps never more to meet) the few intimates whom I love, among these, be assured you are one.

Washington said: “To the wearied traveller j  
who sees a resting place, and is bending his­  
f-odv to lean thereon, I now compare mvseil; I

much for some. To misrepresent my motive?*., j

Let it again and finally fie asked—&#x27;Who  
cheered and sustained the great nnd good  
Washington during the whole period of his ad­  
ministering the government of the United  
States? Federalists; those very men whom  
the lenders of Van Burenisni delight in cal­

who invoke those whom they endeavor to be­  
guile into their ranks to beware of, ns-they re­
