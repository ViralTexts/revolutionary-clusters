These circumstances and all others connected therein must be critically examined into, in order that you may form your Judgement on the said treaties with the greatest accuracy.

was made, on the 2d July, 1791. It isa treaty be-  
tween the Cherokee nation on one side, and the  
United States on the other, treating as sovereigns.  
The obnoxious words, ‘‘the United States give  
peace,” co not occur here. The first article is,  
“there shall be perpetual peace and friendship be-  
tween ali the citizens of the United States of Ame-  
rica and all the individuals composing the Cherokee  
nation of Indians.”  
  
By the second article the Cherokees acknowledge  
themselves to be under the protection of the United  
States of America and of no other sovereign whoso-  
ever, and stipulates that they ‘‘will not hold any  
treaty with any foreign power, individual state, or

They thus placed themselves exclusively under

foreign powers is admitted, by the stipulation re-  
quired of them that they will not exercise this right.
