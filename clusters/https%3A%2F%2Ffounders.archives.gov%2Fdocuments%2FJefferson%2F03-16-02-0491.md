ill carry us to the end of 1833. or 13. years from this time. my individual opinion is that we had better not open the institution until the buildings, Library &amp; all, are finished, and our funds cleared of incumbrance. these buildings, once erected, will secure the full object infallibly at the end of 13. years, and as much earlier as an enlightened legislature shall happen to come into place. and if we were to begin sooner, with half funds only, it would satisfy the common mind, prevent their aid beyond that point &amp; our institution remaining at that forever would be no more than the paltry academies we now have. even with the whole funds we shall be reduced to 6. professors, while Harvard will still prime it over us with her 20. professors. how many of our youths she now has, learning the lessons of anti-Missourianism, I know not; but a gentleman lately from Princeton told me he saw there the list of the students at that place, and that more than half were Virginians. these will return home, no doubt, deeply impressed with the sacred principles of our Holy alliance of Restrictionists.

? I know well your devotion to your country, and your foresight of the awful scenes coming on her, sooner or later. with this foresight, what service can we ever render her equal to this? what object of our lives can we propose so important? what interest of our own, which ought not to be postponed to this? health, time, labor, on what in the single life which nature has given us, can these be better bestowed than on this immortal boon to our country? the exertions and the mortifications are temporary; the benefit eternal. if any member of our college of Visitors could justifiably withdraw from this sacred duty, it would be my self, who ‘quadragenis stipendiis jamdudum peractis’ have neither vigor of body or mind left to keep the field. but I will die in the last ditch. and so, I hope, you will, my friend, as well as our firm-breasted brothers and colleagues mr Johnson and Genl Breckenridge. nature will not give you a second life wherein to atone for the omissions of this. pray then, dear and very dear Sir, do not think of deserting us; but view the sacrifices which seem to stand in your way, as the lesser duties, and such as ought to be postponed to this, the greatest of all. continue with us in these holy labors, until, having seen their accomplishment, we may say with old Simeon ‘nunc dimittis, Domine.’ under all c
