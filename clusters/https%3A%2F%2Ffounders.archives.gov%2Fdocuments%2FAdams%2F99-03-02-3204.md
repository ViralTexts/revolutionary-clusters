my Dear Son  
					Quincy Novbr 5th 1816  
				  
				while your Father is deeply engaged, in reading, Dupuis “orgine de Tous Les Cultes ou Religion universelle” which he Says is the most Learned work he ever read. all is Silent around me, and I embrace this Season of quiet and tranquility to write to you, and to acknowledge your Letter of August 12th No 92.—your hand writing, always gives me a Spring to my Spirits, and is like a cordial, altho the Glass be not half fill’d.In return I have much to Say to you I do not know whether you will trace my Thoughts in transcribing the following quotation.“A Good Man will Live with the world, as a wise Man will Live with his wife; he will not let himself down to be a dupe to its humours, a devotee to its pleasures, or a flatterer of its faults; he will make himself as happy as he can in the connection for his own Sake, reform where he is able, and complain only when he cannot help it.—I am Sick of that conversation which Spends itself in railing at the times we live in;—I am apt to think, they are not made better by these complaints; and I have often times occasion to know they are made worse, by those very persons who are loudest to complain of them—If this be really one of the habits of Age—it is high time for every Man who grows old, to guard against it, for there is no occasion to invite more pevish Companions for the last hours of Life than time and decrepitude will bring in their train—Let us look back upon things past, with what content we can, Salute time present with the best grace we are able, and resign ourselves to futurity with calmness and a patient mind; if we do not wish to be banished from Society before Death withdraws us from it—do not let us trust to the worlds respect only. Let us Strive also to conciliate its Love

GOOD man will live with the  
  
A world, as a wile man lives with his  
wife: he will not let himfelf down to  
be a dupe to its humours, a devotee to  
its plealure, or a flatterer of its faults.  
He will make himfelf as happy as he  
can in the connection for his own fake,  
reform where he is able, and complain  
only when he cannot help it. I am fick  
of that converfation which fpends itfelf  
in railing at the times we live in. I am  
apt to think they are not made better  
by thofe complaints, and I have often-  
times occafion to know they are made  
worle by thofe very people who are  
loudeft to comp!ain of them. _ If this be  
really one of the habits of age, it is high  
time for every man who grows old to  
guard againit it; for there is no occa-  
fion to invite more peevifh companions  
for the laft hours of life, than time, than  
decrepitude, will bring in their train.  
Let us look back upon all things pait,  
with what content we can; falute time  
prefent with the beft graces we are able;  
and relign ourfelves to futurity with  
calmnefs, anda patient mind: if we do  
with to be banifhed from fociety before  
death withdraws us from it, co not let  
us truft to the world’s refpect only ; let  
us {lrive to conciliate its love

THE powers of the-underftanding have their  
  
bounds, and beyond them ‘t always loefs ia

Many svoridly friendfhips difolve away wish

A good man will live with the world asa  
wife maa lives with his wife; he will not let  
himfelf down to be a dupe to its humors, a devo-  
tee to its pleafures, ora flatterer of its faults ;  
he will make himfelf as happy as he cam in the  
connection for his own fake, reform. where he is  
able, and complain only when he cannot help.
