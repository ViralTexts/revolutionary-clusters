Passy, Oct. 9. 1780  
Besides the Pleasure of their Company, I had the great Satisfaction of hearing by your two valuable Friends, &amp; learning from your Letter, that you enjoy a good State of Health. May God continue it as well for the Good of Mankind as for your Comfort. I thank you much for the second Edition of your excellent Pamphlet. I forwarded that you sent to Mr. Dana, he being in Holland.— I wish also to see the Piece you have written as Mr Jones tells me, on Toleration.— I do not expect that your new Parliament will be either wiser or honester than the last. All Projects to procure an Honest one, by Place Bills, &amp;c appear to me vain and Impracticable. The true Cure I imagine is to be found only in rendring all Places unprofitable, and the King too poor to give Bribes &amp; Pensions. Till this is done, which can only be by a Revolution, and I think you have not Virtue enough left to procure one, your Nation will always be plundered; &amp; obliged to pay by Taxes the Plunderers for Plundering &amp; Ruining. Liberty &amp; Virtue therefore join in the Call, Come out of her, my People! I am fully of your Opinion respecting Religious Tests; but tho’ the People of Massachusetts have not in their new Constitution kept quite clear of them; yet if we consider what that People were 100 Years ago, we must allow they have gone great Lengths in Liberality of Sentiment, on religious Subjects; and we may hope for greater Degrees of Perfection when their Constitution some years hence shall be revised. If Christian Preachers had continued to teach as Christ &amp; his Apostles did, without Salaries, and as the Quakers now do, I imagine Tests would never have existed: For I think they were invented not so much to secure Religion itself, as the Emoluments of it.— When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig’d to call for the help of the Civil Power, ’tis a Sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one. But I shall be out of my Depth if I wade any deeper in Theology, &amp; I will not trouble you with Politicks, nor with News which are almost as uncertain: But conclude with a heartfelt Wish, to embrace you once more, &amp; enjoy your sweet Society in Peace, among our honest, worthy, ingenious Friends at the London.

Passy, Octol rQ, 1780.  
Dear Sir,  
  
BESIDES the pleasure of their  
company, | had the great satisfaction  
of hearing by your two valuable  
friends, and learning from your letter,  
that you enjoy a good state of health.  
May God continue it as well for the  
good of mankind as for your comfort.  
J thank yon much for the second  
edition of your excellent pamphlet :  
1 forwarded that you sent to Mr.  
Dana, he being in Holland. I wish  
also to see the piece you have written,  
(as Mr. Jones tells me) on toleration :  
I do not expect that your new parlia-  
ment will be either wiser or honester  
than the last. All projects to procure  
an honest one, ®y place bills, &amp;c.  
appear to me vain and impracticable.  
The true cure I imagine is to be  
found only in rendering all places  
unprofitable, and the king too poor  
to give bribes and pensions. ‘Till this  
is done, which can only be by a  
revolution, and I think you have not  
virtue enough left to procure one,  
your nation will always be plundered ;  
and obliged to pay by taxes the plun-  
  
derers for plundering and ruining.  
Liberty and virtue therefore join im  
the call come OUT OF HER, MY  
reorLce! I am fully of your opinion  
respecting religious tests; but though  
the people of Massachusetts have not  
in their new constitution kept quite  
clear of them; yet tf we consider  
what that people were one hundred  
years azo, we must allow they have  
gone greater lengths in liberality of  
sentinent, on religious subjects ; and  
we may hope for greater degrees of  
perfection when their constitution  
years hence shall be revised.  
If Christian preachers had continued  
to teach as Christ and his apostles  
did, without salaries, and as the  
Quakers now do, I imagine tests  
would never have existed: for 1 think  
they were invented not so much to  
secure religion itself, as the emolu-  
ments of it. When a religion is good,  
Il conceive that it will support itself;  
and when it cannot support itself,  
and God does not take care to support  
it, so that its professors are obliged to  
call for the help of the civil power,  
‘us a sign I apprehend, of its being a  
bad one. But I shall be out of my  
depth if I wade any deeper in the-  
ology, and I will not trouble you  
with politics, nor with news, which  
are almost as uncertain :) but conclude  
with a heartfelt wish to embrace you  
once more, and enjoy your sweet  
society in peace, among our honesi,  
worthy, ingenious friends at the  
  
London.

with ourselves or not.’ If Christians generally, in  
  
speaking of men whom they regard as infidels, would  
imitate this candor of the English Independent, they  
would be more successful in winning bewildered souls  
to Christ.  
  
—The men—and their number is not small—  
who have a hankering for some sort of visible union  
between Church and State, ought to weigh these  
words of Benjamin Franklin: ‘“‘ When a religion is

The constitution also provides that no  
religious test shall ever be required of  
any one who holds office under the  
7 constitution and as all citizens are  
under the constitution this applies to  
every person in every state. Our an­  
cestors wanted more than political lib­  
•erty. They wanted religious liberty.  
They wanted freedom of conscience.  
&#x27; They wanted each and every citizen  
to have the legal right to worship in  
any manner that he or she saw fit or  
not at all if they had no religion.  
Benjamin Franklin said: “When a  
religion is good I conceive that it will  
support itself and when it can not sup­  
port itself and God does not care to  
support it so its professors are obliged  
to call for help from the civil power,  
it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being  
a bad one.” All patriotic citizens  
should agree with the patriotic Benja­

If Christian preachers had continued to teach  
as Christ and his Apostles did, without salaries,  
and as the Quakers now do, I imagine tests  
would never have existed; for I think they were

the emoluments of it. When a religion is good, I
