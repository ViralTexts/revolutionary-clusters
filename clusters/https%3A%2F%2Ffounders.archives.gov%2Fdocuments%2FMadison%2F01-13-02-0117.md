The sixth resolution (see headnote to speech of 20 Apr.) was amended and approved on 21 April. The seventh resolution, “that immediate provision ought to be made for the present debt of the United States; and that the faith of government ought to be pledged to make provision, at their next session, for so much of the debts of the respective States, as shall have been subscribed upon any of the terms expressed in the last resolution,” was then considered. Sherman offered an amendment to the resolution which provided for the assumption of a proportion of the state debts with the remainder to be left until a final settlement of state accounts.

Mr. Madison. It is not without much reluctance that I trouble the committee with any observations on a subject which has been so long under discussion, and may be thought to be entirely exhausted. I must refer for my apology to the uncommon perseverance with which the advocates for an assumption adhere to their object, notwithstanding the difficulties which oppose it. On the supposition that the measure in question were ever so eligible, if it could be so modified as to be acceptable to the general sense of the government, and of its constituents at large, every member ought I think to be struck with the impropriety of pressing a matter of such peculiar importance and delicacy, by a bare majority.  
The proposition now under debate is liable to all the objections to the former one, as well as to the many others that have been stated against it. From the explanation given by the gentleman from Connecticut, it is evident that this proposition may in the result assume the shape of the original one. It may therefore be fairly combated by all those arguments that were brought either against the original proposition, or against the very objectionable manner in which the blanks are proposed to be filled up.  
I am not insensible that an assumption of the state debts is under certain aspects, a measure not unworthy of a favorable attention. If it had not at least plausible recommendations, I do not think it could have obtained so respectable a patronage here: I am sure it would not have originated in the quarter which proposed it. But, Sir, it is a question that must be considered and reconsidered in all its various points of view, and the more it has already been investigated, the more objections have multiplied, and the more solid they have appeared. The arguments used in favor of the measure have been supposed weighty, but, Sir, I consider them as unsupported. It has been contended that the state debts are in their nature debts of the United States; that they were only from different offices, and have borne a different denomination, but that in justice they are the debts of the United States, and that the individual creditors can of right claim payment of the same from the general government.  
I deny the principle, Sir, and I think it is disproved by the arguments of the gentlemen themselves. If the debts of the particular states be nothing more than the debts of the United States under another denomination, and if we are bound to provide for them precisely as for the debts of the United States, let gentlemen consider whether they are not bound to view them in this light wherever they may be found. If they are debts of the United States in the hands of individual citizens, for the same reason that the other debts in private hands are debts of the United States, must they not be debts of the United States also when in the treasuries of the different states?  
Will gentlemen say that what are called the state debts ought to be viewed in that light when in the hands of citizens, and that this quality forsakes them the moment they are received into a state treasury. If they wish to preserve consistency in their reasoning, they must say, either that the debts are dissimilar in the hands of private citizens, or that they are similar in the hands of the states.  
  
The debts of the particular states cannot in any point of view be considered as actual debts of the United States; and the United States are not bound by any past requisition, or any resolutions now existing to assume them, till the accounts are settled and the balances ascertained. We have been told, sir, not only that the assumption of the state debts by the United States is a matter of right on the part of the states, and a matter of obligation on the part of the United States, but likewise that it is equitable; nay, that it is a matter of necessity.  
It has been said that the United States are invested with the resources of the particular states, and that therefore they are bound to provide for the debts of those states. I think I may safely rest the issue of this question on a question of fact, Whether the states most urgent in this business are incapacitated from providing for their debts by the establishment of the present constitution? If gentlemen assert that to be the case, I think it is incumbent upon them to prove, either that the resources which they have given up would exceed their quota of the federal requisitions, or that the use of these resources by the general government will throw a disproportioned burthen upon that particular part of the community. Let us consider, sir, what is the ratio in which the states, in their individual capacity, ought to bear the debts of the United States, and what is the ratio in which they will contribute under the taxes that it is proposed to levy. The only evidence by which we can guide ourselves in this enquiry is a statement from the several custom houses. I believe indeed, that such a statement may not be conclusive. I think it is imperfect; at the same time it is the best guide in our reach, and probably it will be sufficient to illustrate the present argument. The state of New-Hampshire, according to this statement, will contribute about one hundredth part of what will be contributed by the whole. Her ratio of contribution according to her representation would be nearly about one twentieth. Here then, in fact, is a saving of four fifths to that state. The state may then take this saving and apply it to the purpose of discharging her domestic debt; she is relieved in that proportion, and therefore in that proportion she is more able to provide for her state debt under the new constitution than under the old one.  
The state of Connecticut will contribute about one thirty-eighth; her proper quota would be about one thirteenth. Here then is a saving of two-thirds to the state of Connecticut; and in that proportion is her situation better under the new Constitution than the old. Taking the States eastward of New-York altogether, that the gentlemen say are rendered incapable of bearing the burthen of the state debts, by the adoption of the new constitution; I say, take the whole together, and they will contribute about a sixth only; whereas they would have had to contribute a fourth, if this constitution had not been established, and they had paid their part of the debt of the United States. In my apprehension, then, sir, as the payment of the state debts cannot be claimed as a matter of right, neither can such payment be called for on the principles of equity, or what is most of all urged, necessity. But we are told that policy is also in favor of the measure. A gentleman from Massachusetts has said, that the people of Massachusetts never would submit to a rejection of the measure; that it will create a spirit of opposition to the government; in short, that it will endanger the union itself. I confess that these are consequences that would be dreadful to me, if I could suppose they would really take place, and that evils of greater magnitude would not ensue from an adoption of the measure. It is my opinion, sir, that if the refusal to assume the state debts would produce dangerous consequences to the union from the discontents that it is apprehended will grow out of the measure, much more have we to fear from an assumption, particularly if hazarded by a small majority. Sir, if we could ascertain the opinions of our constituents, individually, I believe we should find four fifths of the citizens of the United States against the assumption; I believe we should find more; I believe I speak within bounds when I say, that those who would be for an assumption would not amount to one-fifth; this is indeed probable conjecture only. But on the other hand, let me ask, what evidence have we that there will be any great disappointment or discontents from a non-assumption? The legislature of the state of New-Hampshire have lately been in session; have they asked for this assumption? No; on the contrary, tho’ they have not instructed their delegates to vote against it, it appears that it was thought of, and that the bulk of the members disapproved of it. The legislature of Massachusetts have been in session; they were apprized that this matter was under consideration, and yet there has been no declaration from them, as far as I know, that can induce us to believe they wish for it; on the contrary, it would appear from the measures they have taken to provide for the payment of their state debt, that they had proceeded on a supposition that an assumption would not take place. With respect to several other states, their legislatures have also been in session, and none of them, except South-Carolina, have made any declaration on the subject. If we are to disregard that species of evidence, and to look back to the expectations of the people, I do not think that there is a single indication that this measure was ever thought of by our constituents. Sir, I may safely say, it was never expected by the generality of them.  
It has been said, too, that policy recommends the measure. It has been repeated that if the assumption does not take place, no part of the revenues drawn from the Union at large will return to the distant parts of it. Sir, I thought this argument had been set aside sometime since. The very reverse will happen. The state debts have begun already to travel towards the central parts of the Union, and to such an amount as to make it probable, that if they are provided for by us, nearly the whole will follow. Should this be the case, I believe such disadvantages will ensue as will prove the measure very impolitic. In proportion as the whole money contributed in the way of taxes shall center near the government, or in a particular part of the Union, you increase the evil of discordant interests and local jealousies which is already too much felt. But, perhaps, this is not the worst consequence to be apprehended. I conceive that a very great part of the proper debt of the United States will go into the hands of foreigners, and that we shall be heavily burdened in paying an interest to them which cannot be expected to remain in the country; and in proportion as you increase the debt of the United States you will increase this evil.  
I am of opinion also that the measure is not politic, because, if the public debt is a public evil, an assumption of the state debts will enormously increase, and, perhaps, perpetuate it. It is my idea, Sir, that the United States and the several states could discharge a debt of eighty millions with greater ease and in less time than the United States alone could do it. I found my opinion on this consideration, that after the United States shall have resorted to every means of taxation within their power, there will still remain resources from which monies may be raised by the states. Nay, I will go farther, and illustrate the remark by adding, that after a state shall have extended its power of taxation to every object falling under general laws, there would still remain resources from which further taxes might be drawn within subdivisions of it, by the subordinate authorities of the state. But Sir, when we consider, that in some parts of the Union there is an unconquerable aversion to direct taxes, at least, if laid, by the general government; that in other parts an equal aversion to excises prevails; how will the United States, so circumscribed as to the field of taxation, be able to draw forth such resources as are contemplated by the advocates of an assumption?  
It has been asserted that it would be politic to assume the state debts, because it would add strength to the national government. There is no man more anxious for the success of the government than I am, and no one who will join more heartily in curing its defects; but I wish these defects to be remedied by additional constitutional powers, if they should be found necessary. This is the only proper, effectual, and permanent remedy.  
Several gentlemen, Sir, have gone into another field of argument in favor of this measure. It has been said, that the constitution itself requires the assumption. One of my colleagues has asked a very proper question. If as we have been told, the assumption originated in the convention, why were not words inserted that would have incorporated and made the state debts part of the debts of the United States? Sir, if there was a majority who disapproved of the measure, certainly no argument can be drawn from this source; if there was a majority who approved of it, but thought it inexpedient to make it a part of the constitution, they must have been restrained by a fear that it might produce dissentions and render the success of their plan doubtful. I do recollect that such a measure was proposed, and, if my memory does not deceive me, the very gentleman  
  
Mr. Sherman.  
  
who now appeals to the constitution in support of his argument, disrelished the measure at that time, and assigned for a reason, that it would administer relief perhaps exactly in proportion as the states had been deficient in making exertions. It has been also remarked, that the constitution having been established for obtaining perfect justice, it cannot be carried into effect unless full justice is done on this subject, or in other words, unless the state debts are assumed. Sir, if we are to take these words in their full extent, we must not stop merely with securing justice to the creditors of the government, we should also endeavour to secure justice to every private creditor

## Assumption of the State Debts, [22 April] 1790

 whatever. The gentleman says, that, by the constitution, all debts that existed against the United States at the time of the adoption of the constitution are to be as valid now as they were before its adoption.  
What was the situation of the state debts before the adoption of the constitution? Was it understood that they were a part of the debt of the United States, any further than there might be found a balance on a final settlement. Was it ever supposed that they were to be thrown into one common mass, and that the states should be called on collectively to provide for them? What would have been thought of such a proposition? Would it have been considered as consistent with equity? Would it have been tho’t constitutional? I am persuaded if such a proposition had been made in the old Congress it never would have found a second; and for this reason, that the debts of the particular states were never considered as the debts of the United States. In whatever light we view the question, it appears to me that the arguments urged in support of it, are themselves unsupportable.  
Much has been said of the situation of particular states in case these debts should not be assumed. Much, indeed, has been said of the distresses and exertions of Massachusetts; but if we are to be governed by enquiries of this sort we must extend them to every part of the Union, and we shall then find that an assumption will give as much dissatisfaction and work as much injustice to a majority of the states as a non-assumption may disappoint the citizens of Massachusetts. I do not wish to go into local enquiries, but the present subject seems in its nature to make them in some degree unavoidable. The conduct of gentlemen on the other side, at least renders the task on this indispensable. What would be the operations of the measure with respect to Virginia? It will not be denied that Virginia sacrificed as much during the war, in one shape or another, and contributed as much to the common defence of the states as any among them, certainly as much as Massachusetts. These are facts that can in time be proved. Since the peace, that state has made great exertions to comply with the requisitions of Congress: I might say, Sir, that she was almost unequalled in her exertions. Her specie payments into the federal treasury since the peace exceed 600,000 dollars, whereas those of Massachusetts are only between 2 and 300,000 dollars. In indents Massachusetts has indeed paid most, but by no means in such proportion as to balance the difference in the specie payments. The exertions of Virginia to discharge the debt she involved herself in by the war, have also been very great; she is not behind any of the states—she is before most of them; there can be no doubt but that she has certainly discharged more of her debts than Massachusetts, and as little doubt in the opinion of the best informed, that whenever a final settlement shall take place that state will be found a creditor to the United States.  
If, during the war, she has made as great exertions, and has suffered as much as any of the states; if she has since the peace paid her full proportion of the supplies to the federal treasury, at the same time exerting herself to the utmost to discharge her state debt, and if finally she will probably be found to be in advance to the union, and would therefore if justice could at once be done, be now entitled to a reimbursement—what must be said by the citizens of that State, if instead of a reimbursement, they are called upon to make further advances. Sir, I may add here, that their contributions to the federal treasury, under the proposed system of revenue will exceed the ratio by which they would contribute, by taxes laid in proportion to their representation. I do not wish to extend this investigation any farther than has been already done; but were I to do it, the evidence would be more striking, that the payments from those parts of the union that would receive least benefit from the assumption, would be greater than from those that would receive the immediate benefit of it.  
One of my colleagues seems to be of opinion that the measure will be favorable to the interest of Virginia; but he seems to me to have grounded his opinion on the erroneous supposition, that the proposed plan will embrace the whole of the debts as they existed at the close of the war, or that the state of Virginia will contribute less, on the plan of deriving revenue from consumption, than she would if derived according to the constitutional ratio. I believe, on the contrary, that if the assumption should take place as originally proposed, that there would be a claim on Virginia for five millions, whereas if there is no assumption, her citizens will have to provide for about three millions only; and thus, instead of bearing her proper burden, which is about one seventh, she would have to bear a burden in the ratio of one fifth. He seems to think that his own particular district would be benefited by this measure; but if he be right in his other opinion, that that part of the state will consume more than the other parts, he will find, sir, that instead of relieving his constituents, compared with the rest of the state, that he would still more augment their burthens; so that it would come to this at last, that the state would have to pay five millions, instead of three—and that the particular part of the state he represents, instead of paying their proportion of three millions, would have to pay more than their proportion of five. I admit, however, that he is the most proper judge on that subject. But the citizens of Virginia would not only be called upon when already in advance, and to an amount beyond their proper ratio, but in a mode that is peculiarly obnoxious to them—I mean that of excise. Sir, the people of that state are as averse to excises as those of any other state can be to direct taxes, and in my own judgment with far more reason, where the article excised is not by some peculiarity free from the common objections. Excises are unequal with respect to different parts of the union: they are also unequal to various parts of the same state. This mode of collection gives arbitrary powers to the collectors, and exposes our citizens to vexatious searches. It opens a door to frauds and perjuries that tend equally to vitiate the morals of the people, and to defeat the public revenue. Besides, sir, excises are more expensive in the collection than other kind of taxes. The collection of the excise in Great Britain costs 10 per cent. That of her direct taxes is computed at 3 per cent, only. I will not positively say that a similar disproportion in the expence of collecting would be incurred in this country; but in some parts of it I am sure that the expence of excises would be greatest, and on some articles in view, would, if the collection were made at all, exceed the revenue obtained from it.  
Sir, there has been an argument of another kind advanced in support of the assumption. Gentlemen have thought it a matter of consequence that not only justice should be done, but that the condition of the people should be equalized; that no invidious comparisons might be made between the inhabitants of one state, and those of another, and that no oppressions or embarrassments should force the people to emigrate from one state to another. It would be a comfortable reflection, if every part of the union could be assimilated in this instance; but, sir, I think we have no authority to sacrifice essential considerations to obtain these advantages. Nor do I know that we should obtain them by assuming the state debts. Supposing that measure to be adopted, let us reflect what would be the situation of the different parts of the Union. I do not, at this moment, consider the question as it respects justice, right, or general policy, but in reference merely to the particular consequence of equalizing the circumstances of the people. Let us take a view, comparatively, of the people of the United States. Massachusetts owes a debt of several millions. The public debt, when you come to analyze it, at least where it is due to citizens and not to foreigners, is a debt from one part of the people to the other. The government is the collector from the pockets of the debtors to pay it into the hands of the creditors. If, sir, the state debts should be assumed, Massachusetts will then get rid of her embarrassments; but what would be the situation of Virginia? Besides her public debt, I believe that her citizens owe, one to another, debts, in amount, equal to the whole public debt of Massachusetts, perhaps I might say to the amount of both the public and private debts of that state. In addition to all this, the people of Virginia are indebted to foreigners to a greater amount than the whole debt of Massachusetts. Sir, I firmly believe that though Virginia is less oppressed with public debt than Massachusetts, yet when we take a view of all the difficulties she labors under, and weigh them against those of Massachusetts, it will be found that Virginia ought to be relieved herself instead of being expected to relieve others.  
But, supposing all objections of another nature to be laid aside, I freely confess that after a more minute examination into the subject, I am much inclined to doubt whether the assumption can possibly be carried into execution. Difficulties are continually arising when I survey this question, for which I can find no solution, without departing from every principle by which we ought to be guided. It never yet has been shewn in what manner a remedy could be provided for a partial subscription. Suppose the state creditors were part of them to subscribe and part to refuse. Suppose those of one state subscribe, and those of another should not. Again, Sir, by what method will you discriminate the debts that come under the definition, from those that will be excluded by it? Where will you invest this important discretionary power. I really think that great difficulties will be found before this can be effected. There is another objection too, to which I have never heard a satisfactory answer, although it has been repeatedly urged by a member from Georgia. There are debts existing in some of the states that do not bear interest, that have got into circulation without any title to it, and have been received by the present holders without any other expectation than that in some reasonable time the principal would be paid. Would it, Sir, be proper or necessary to consider these as debts of the Union, bearing interest, or to provide for the immediate funding of them? But there is a case, in my opinion, far more difficult, I mean the paper money issued to redeem the state debts. The state of North-Carolina has taken up its certificates with these paper bills. They are not proposed to be included in the assumption. They are clearly excluded by the present motion, yet they are as much a state debt to be sunk by taxes as certificates, and the taxes may as much interfere with those of other states. Some of the states, Sir, have not only assumed the debts recommended by Congress for making up the depreciation to the army, but they have gone further and have made up the depreciation, where it was not recommended. Other states have not done this. The debts existing in some states I take it for granted comprehend these depreciation notes. Would it not be unjust to call on those states that have not made this provision for their army that other states have done, would it not be hard to call upon those officers and soldiers who have not received this additional compensation, to pay it to those of other states, who have? I would not here be understood to censure the states that made this compensation; I rather commend them for it. It is a proof of their magnanimity and justice that does them honor, but at the same time this does not alter the nature of the objection. In some states, in order to reward the army, they have done it by several aids that do not constitute any part of the state debts. In some of the states there are debts still unliquidated. If you declare that, when liquidated, they shall be assumed, you afford a temptation that has been hitherto cautiously avoided, that of making the states less exact in the settlement of their accounts. I do not find that any gentleman has proposed, on the contrary most of them seem to have rejected, the idea of making provision at this session for fulfilling the engagement in case we enter into an assumption. I think it would be a powerful and unanswerable objection against assuming the state debts at this time, that we do not see or are not prepared to decide on the means of providing for them. There is not a more important and fundamental principle in legislation, than that the ways and means ought always to face the public engagements; that our appropriations should ever go hand in hand with our promises. To say that the United States should be answerable for twenty-five millions of dollars without knowing whether the ways and means can be provided, and without knowing whether those who are to succeed us will think with us on the subject, would be rash and unjustifiable. Sir, in my opinion, it would be hazarding the public faith in a manner contrary to every idea of prudence. It is very true, Sir, that a variety of funds have been proposed, yet they are nothing more than mere suggestions, and tho’ I think they are as good as could be expected in the time, I really believe that some of them, at least, if they can be carried into execution at all, will disappoint the calculations on which they are founded.  
I cannot finish my observations on this subject, sir, without adverting to one particular, which I would wish gentlemen to attend to, not so much for our sakes as their own. I would recommend to them no longer to assume a pre-eminence over us in the nationality of their motives; and that they would forbear those frequent assertions, that if the state debts are not provided for, the federal debts shall also go unprovided for; nay, that if the state debts are not assumed, the union will be endangered. Sir, I am persuaded that if the gentlemen knew the motives that govern us, they would blush at such intemperate as well as inconsistent language. I am sure that if they knew the emotions with which it is heard, they would at least see the inutility of it. I hope, sir, that whatever may be the decision on this question of assumption, that patriotism and every other noble and generous motive will lead the minority to acquiesce in measures which will tend to establish public credit by a due provision for the public engagements

MR. Madison. It is not without much reluct­  
ance that I tioublethe committee with any  
observations on a fubjedl which has been so long  
under discussion, and may be thought to be en  
tirely exhausted. I must refer for iny apology to  
i the uncommon perseverance with which the ad­  
vocates for an assumption adhere to their obje&lt;sl,  
notwithstanding the difficulties which oppol&#x27;e it.  
On the supposition that the measure in quellion  
were ever so eligible, if it could be so modified  
as to be acceptable to the general fcnfe of the go­  
vernment, and of its conllituents at large, every  
member ought I thiuk to be (truck with the im­  
propriety of pressing a matter of such peculiar  
importance and delicacy, by a bare majority.  
The proposition now under debate is liable to  
all the objections to the former one, as well as to  
the many others that have been stated agaiult it.  
friom the explanation g*iven by the gentleman  
from Connecticut, it is evident that this proposi­  
tion may in the result assume the fliape of the  
original one. It may therefore be fairly comba­  
ted by all tliofe arguments that were brought ci­  
ther against the original proposition, or against  
the very objectionable manner in which the blanks  
are proposed to be filled up.  
I am not insensible that an afliimptjon H&quot;fc4&gt;e  
state debts is under certain afpecfts, a measure hot  
unworthy of a favorable attention. If it had nqt  
leall plausible recommendations, 1 do rtot  
think it could have obtained so refpetftabie a pa­  
tronage here : lam sure it would not have ori­  
ginated in the quarter which proposed it. But,  
Sir, it is a quellion that must be coniidered and  
reconsidered in all its various points of view, and  
fljtrmore&#x27;u&#x27;ius already been inveitigacccl, the  
more objections have multiplied, and the more  
solid they have appeared. The arguments used  
in favor of the measure have been supposed  
weighty,but,Sir, I consider them as unsupported.  
It has been contended that the state debts are in  
their nature d#bts of the United States ; that they  
were only from different offices, and have borne  
a different denomination, but that in justice they  
are the debts of the United States, #nd that the  
individual creditors can of right claim payment  
ofthe fame from the general government.  
I deny the principle, Sir, and I think it is dis­  
proved by the arguments of the gentlemen them­  
selves. If the debts of the particular states be  
nothing more than the debts of the United States  
underanotherdenoinination,andifwe are bound  
to provide for them precisely as for the debts of  
the United Slates,let gentlemen consider whether  
they are not bound to view them in this light  
wherever they may be found. If they are debts  
of the United States in the hands of individual  
citizens, for the fame reason that the other debts  
in private hands are debts of the United States,  
must they not be debts of the United States also  
when in the Treasuries ofthe different states ?  
  
Will gentlemen fay that what are called the  
state debts ought to be viewed in that light when  
in the hands of citizens, and that this quality  
foi fakes them the moment they are received into  
® -^ate Treasury. If they wish to preserve con­  
iiftency in their reasoning, they must fay, either  
that the debts are diflimilar in the hands of pri­  
vate citizens, or that they are limilar in the hands  
of the states.  
  
rhe debts ofrhe particular states cannot in any  
point of view be considered as actual debts of the  
United States; and the United States arc not  
b&#x27;lund by any part requisition, or any refoluttons  
now existing to afiume them, till the accomus are  
fettled and the balances afcerrained. We have  
een told, fir, not only that the aflumption of  
f ie Hate debts by the United States is a matter of  
ught on the part of the states, and a matter of  
obligation on the part of the United States, but  
ikewife that iris equitable; nay, that it is a  
matter of necefiity. -  
It has been said that rhe United States are in-  
vt with the resources of the particular states,  
aii&lt; t i u therefore they are bound to provide for  
,r&#x27; fHS tlL*°fe states. I think I may fafely  
4\ r. 1 &#x27;vm us t&#x27;l&#x27;s queftiou on a qiieftiou of  
L &#x27; &#x27; lct&#x27;&#x27;er the states most urgent in this bu-  
Krer^tJIed from providing for their

WEDNESDAY, MAT i 9, 1790,  
  
tution ? If gentlemen aflbrt that to be the cafe,  
I think it is incumbent upon them then to prove  
either that the resources which they have eiven,  
up would exceed their quota of the federal Tequi­  
htions or that the use of these resources by the  
general government will throw a difproportioned  
burthen upon that particular part of thecommu­  
mty. Let us consider, fir, what is the ratio in  
which the states, in their individual capacity,  
ought to bear the debts of vie United States, and  
what is the ratio in which&#x27; :hey will contribute  
under the taxes that it is proposed to levy. The  
only evidence by which we can guide ourselves  
111 this enquiry is a ftatenient from the several  
custom houses. I believe indeed, that such a  
ftatenient may not be concluftve. I think it is  
imperfect ; at the fame time it is the best guide  
in our rcach, and probably it will be fuflicient to  
illuitrate the present argument—The state of  
New-Hampshire, accordingto this statement, will  
contribute about one hundredth part of what  
will be contributed by the whole. Her ratio of  
contribution according to her representation  
would be nearly about one twentieth. Here then,  
in&#x27;fasTt, isafavingof four fifrhs to that state. The  
state may then take this saving and apply it to  
the purpose of discharging her domestic debt ;  
flie is relieved in that proportion, aind therefore  
in that proportion she is more able to provide for  
her state debt under the new cjnftitution than  
under the old one.  
  
i lie state of Connedlicut will contribute about  
one thirty-eighth ; her proper quota would be a-  
one thirteenth. Here then is a favino- of  
two-thirds to the state of Connecticut ; ami in  
that proportion is her fuuation better under the  
new Conllitution than the oil. Taking theftates  
eastward of New-York altogether, that the gen  
tlenxen rendered incapable of bearing the  
burthen oftheltate debts, l.y the adoption of the  
new conftirution ; I fay, take the whole together,  
and they will contribute &#x27;bout a sixth only ;  
whereas they \vo;?!d b;&lt;\ iad to contribute,  
a foui th, ii thisconflitutioi. idnotbeeueftablilh­  
ed,and they had paid their part of the debt of the  
United States In my apprehension, then, fir,  
as the payment of the state debts cannot beclaiin­  
ed as a matter ofright, neither can such payment  
be called for 011 die principles of equity, or  
what is molt of all urged, ncceflity. But we are  
told that policy is alio in favor of the measure.  
A gentleman from Mafl&#x27;achufetts has said, that  
the people of Maflachufetts never would submit  
to a rejection of the measure; that it will create  
a Ipirit of opposition to the government ; in  
short, that it will endanger the union itfelf. I  
confefi that thefearc consequences that would be  
dreadful to ine, if I could suppose they would  
really take place, and that evils of greater mag­  
nitude wouht not ensue from an adoption of the  
measure. It is my opinion, fir, that if the refu­  
fal to alluine the state debts would produce dan­  
gerous consequences to the union, from the dis­  
contents that it is apprehended will grow out of  
the measure, much more have we to Fear from an  
afl&#x27;umption, particularly if hazarded by a small  
majority. Sir, it we (ould ascertain the opini­  
ons of our constituents, individually, I believe we  
rtiould find fourfifths of the citizens of the United  
States againftthe afl&#x27;umption ; I believe we should  
find more ; I believe I speak within bounds when  
1 fay, that those who would be for an afl&#x27;umption  
would not amount to one-fifth; this is indeed  
probable conjecture only. But on the other hand  
let meafk, what evidence have we that there will  
be any great disappointment or difcontenlsfrom  
a non-afl&#x27;umption &gt; The Legislature of the state  
of New-Hampshire have lately been in felfion ;  
have they asked for this afl&#x27;umption ? No; on the  
contrary, tho* they have not inftruifted their de­  
legates to vote against it, it appears that it was  
thought of, and that the bulk of the members  
disapproved of it. The Legislature of Maflachu­  
fetts hive been in session; they were apprized  
that this matter was under consideration, and yet  
there has been no declaration from them, as far  
as 1 know, that can induce us to believe they  
wish for it; on the contrary, it would appear  
from the measures they have taken to provide  
for the paymentof theirftate debt, that they had  
proceeded on a supposition that an aflumption  
would not take place. With refpetfi to several  
other states, their Legislatures have also been in  
none of them, except South-Cafolina,  
have made any declaration on the fubjed:. If  
we are to disregard that species of evidence, a&quot;nd  
to look back to the expeiftations of the people, I  
do not think that there is afingle indication that  
  
457  
  
, this measure was ever thought of by our condim­  
ents. Sir, I may fafely fay, it was never expected  
by the generality of them.  
It has been said, too, that policy recommends  
the measure. It has been repeated that if the as­  
sumption does not take place, no part of the re­  
venues drawn from the union at large will return  
to the distant parts of it. Sir, I thought this ar­  
gument had been set aside fouitiine lince The  
very reverie will happen. The Hate debts have  
begun already to travel towards the central parts  
ot the union, and to such an amount as to make  
it probable, that it they are provided for by us  
nearly the whole will follow. Should this be  
the cafe, I believe such disadvantages will ensue  
as will prove the measure very impolitic. Ia  
proportion as the whole money contributed in  
the way of taxes shall center near the government  
or in a particular part of the union, yon increase  
the evil ofdifcordant interests and local jealousies  
which is already too much felt. Bur, perhaps  
tnis is not the worst consequence to be apprehen­  
-1 concieve that a very great part of the  
proper debt of the United States will q;o into the  
hands of foreigners, and that wethalfbe heavily­  
burdened in paying an interest to them which  
cannot be expected to remain in the country ; and  
in proportion as you increase thedebtof the uni­  
ted States you will increase this evil.  
l am of opinion alf6 that the measure is not  
politic, because, if the public debt is a public e­  
vil, an adainption of the state debts will enor­  
mously increase, and perhaps, perpetuate i»- It  
is my idea, Sir, that the United States and the  
ieveral ltates could discharge a debt of eighty  
millions, with greater ease and in less time ?lian  
the United States alone could do it. I found  
my opinion on this consideration, that after the  
United States/hall have resorted to every means  
oi taxation within their power, there will still re­  
main resources from which monies mayberaifed  
by the ltates Nay I will go farther, and illustrate  
the remark by adding, that after a state shall  
lts Power of taxation to every ob­  
ject falling under general laws, there would still  
remain resources from which further taxes mia-hc  
be drawn within subdivisions of it, by the subor­  
dinate authorities of the state. But lir, when we  
consider, that in foine parts of the union there is  
an unconquerable aversion to direcltaxes, at least  
it laid by the general government; that in other  
parts an equal aversion to excises prevails ; how  
will the United States, so circumscribed as to the  
held of taxation, be able to draw forth such re-  
It has been aderted that it would be politic to  
afluine the state debts, because it would add  
itrength to t;he national government. There is  
no man more anxious for the success of the go­  
vernment than lam, and no one who will join more  
heartily in curing its defects ; but I wifli tliefe de­  
ters to be remedied by additional constitutional  
poweis, i t they should be found neceflary This  
mJdy y P&#x27;°l)er&#x27; Cffed:aa]&gt; and Permanent re-  
  
Several gentlemen, Sir, have gone into another  
held of argument in favor of this measure. It  
has been said, that theconftitution itfelf requires  
the aflumption. One of u.y colleagues has alked  
a very proper quell,on,—lf as we have been told  
the aflumption originated in the convention why  
were not words inferred that would have incor­  
porated and made the state debts part of the debts  
of the United States? Sir, if there was a majority  
who disapproved of the measure, certainly ~0 ar­  
gument can be drawn from this source • if there  
was a majority who approved of it, but thought  
it inexpedient to make it a part of the constituti­  
on, they mull have been reitrained by a fear thac  
it might produce diffentions and render the fuc  
cess ot their plan doubtful. Ido recoiled: that  
fiich a measure was proposed, and, if my memory  
does not deceive me, the very gentleman who  
now appeals to the constitution in support of his  
argument, disrelished the measure at that time  
and alfigned for a reason, that it would adminis­  
ter relief perhaps exadlly in proportion as the  
ltates had been deficient in making exertions It  
has been also remarked that the constitution,  
having been established for obtaining perfect jus­  
tice, it cannot be carried into effect unless full  
justice is done on this fubjedl, orin other words,  
unless the state debts are assumed. Sir, if we are  
to take these words in their full extent, we must  
not stop merely with securing justice to the cre­  
ditors of the government, we Ihould also endea­  
vour to secure justice to every private creditor

&#x27;whatever. The gentleman fays, that, by the con­  
ilitution, all debts that existed againftthe United  
States at the time of the adoption of the conlti­  
tution are to be as valid now as they were before  
  
its adoption.  
What was the situation of the state debts before  
the adoption of the constitution ? Was it under­  
ltood that they were a part of the debt of the  
United States, any further than there might be  
found a balance on a final fentlement. Was it  
ever supposed that they were to be thrown into  
one common inafs, and that the states should be  
called on colle&lt;stively to provide for them ? What  
would have been thought of such a proposition ?  
Would it have been confideredas confident with  
equity? Would it have been tho&#x27;t constitutional ?  
1 am persuaded if such a proposition had been  
made in the old Congress it never would have  
found a second ; and for this reason, that the  
debts of the particular states were never con­  
sidered as the debts of the United States. In  
whatever light we view the question, it appears  
to me that the arguments urged in support of it,  
are themselves unfupportable.  
Much has been said of the situation of parti­  
cular states in cafe these debts should not be as­  
sumed. Much, indeed, has been said of the dif­  
trefles and exertions of Maflachufetts ; but if we  
are to be governed by enquiries of this fort we  
must extend thein to every part of the Union,  
and we shall then find that an afl&#x27;umption will  
give a&amp; much diflatisfadtion and work as muchin­  
jufticetoamajoiityof the states as a non-ai!ump­  
tion may disappoint the citizens of Maflachu­  
fetts. Ido not wish to go into local   
but the present fubjedt seems in its nature to make  
them in some degree unavoidable. The con­  
duct of gentlemen on the other fide, at least  
renders the talk on this indispensable. What  
would be the operation of the measure with re­  
fpe&amp;to Virginia ? It will not be denied that Vir­  
ginia facrificed as much during the war, in one  
shape or another, and contributed as much to the  
common defence of the states as any among them,  
certainly as much as Maflachufetts. These are  
facts that can in time be proved. Since the peacc,  
that state has made great exertions to comply  
with the requisitions of Congress : I might fay,  
Sir, that (he wasalmoft unequalled in her exerti­  
ons. Her specie payments into the federal trea­  
lury since the peace exceed 600,000 dollars, where­  
as those of Maflachufetts are only bet wee 2 and  
300,000 dollars. In indents Maflachufetts has in­  
deed paid molt, but by no means in such propor­  
tion as to balance the difference in the specie  
payments. The exertions of Virginiato discharge  
the debt ihe involved herfelf in by the war, have  
also been very great ; she is not behind any of the  
states (he is before molt of them ; there can be  
no doubt but that she has certainly discharged  
more of her debts than,Maflachufetts, and as lit­  
tle doubt in the opinion of the bed informed, that  
whenever a final settlement shall take place chat  
state will be found a creditor to the United States.  
If, during the war, she has made as great exer­  
tions, and has fuffered as much as any of the  
states ; if she has since the peace paid her full  
proportion of the supplies to the federal treasury,  
at the fame time exerting herfelf to the utmost  
to discharge her state debt, and if finally she will  
probably be found to be in advance to the union,  
and would therefore if justice could at once be  
done, be now entitled to a reimbursement—what  
must be said by the citizens of that State, if in­  
stead of a reimbursement, they are called upon to  
make further advances. Sir, I may add here,  
that their contributions to the federal treasury,  
under the proposed system of revenue will ex­  
ceed the ratio by which they would contribute,  
by taxes laid in proportion to their representa­  
tion. Ido not wish to extend this investigation  
any farther than has been already done ; but  
were I to do it, the evidence would be more  
ftrikine, that the payments from those parts of  
the union that would receive least benefit from  
the afl&#x27;umption, would be greater than from those  
that would receive the immediate benefit of it.  
One of my colleagues seems to be of opinion  
fhat the measure will be favorable to the interest  
of Virginia ; but he seems to me to have ground­  
ed his opinion on the erroneous supposition, that  
the proposed plan will embrace the whole of the  
debt as they existed at the close of the war, or  
that the state of Virginia will contribute less, on  
the plan of deriving revenue from confuinption,  
than {he would if derived according to the consti­  
tutional ratio. I believe, on the contrary, that if  
the afl&#x27;umption should take place as 01 iginally pro­  
posed, that there would be a claim 011 Virginia  
forfivemilions, whereas ifthereisno aflumption,  
her citizens will have to provide for about three  
millions only ; and thus, instead of bearing her  
proper burden, which is about one seventh, she  
would have to bear a burden in the ratio&#x27; of one  
fifth. He seems to think that his own particular  
diftTift would be benefited by this measure ; but  
if he be right in his other opinion,that that part of  
the state will confumemore than the other parts,  
he will find, fir, that instead of relieving his con­  
stituents, compared with the reft of the state,  
that he would still more -moment their bur­  
thens ; so that it would como to this at last, that  
  
tlie state would have to pay five millions, infi.ea&lt;  
of three—and that the particular part ot the  
state he represents, instead of paying their P&#x27;°&quot;  
portion of three millions, would have to pay  
more than their proportion ot five. 1 admit,  
however, that he isthe most proper judge on that  
fubiect. But the citizens of Virginia would not  
only be called upon when already in advance, and  
to an amount beyond their proper ratio, but in a  
mode that is peculiarly obnoxious to the&#x27;&quot;—l  
mean that of cxcife. Sir, the people ot that itate  
are asaverfe to excises asthofeof any other state  
can be to direct taxes, and in my own judgment  
with far morereafon, where the article excited is  
not by some peculiarity free from the common  
objections. Excises are unequal with respect to  
different parts of the union : They are alio une­  
qual to various parts of the fame state. I .tis  
mode of collection gives arbitary powers to the  
collectors, and exposes our citizens to vexatious  
fearches—It opens adoor to frauds ana perjuiies  
that tend equally to vitiate the morals of the Peo­  
ple, and to defeat the public revenue. Besides  
fir, excises are more expenlive in the collection  
than other kinds of t. ixes. The collection ot the  
excise in Great Britain costs 10 per cent. That  
of her direct taxes is computed at 3 percent, on­  
ly. 1 will not positively fay that a similar dis­  
proportion in the expence of collecting would be  
incurred in this country ; but in some parts ot it  
I am sure that the expence of excises would be  
greatest, and on some articles in view, would, it  
the collection were made at aLI, exceed the reve­  
nue obtained from it.  
Sir, there has been an argument of another  
kindadvanced in support of the aflumption. Gen­  
tlemen have thought it a matter of consequence  
that not only justice lhouhl be done, but that the  
condition of the people should be equalized ; that  
no invidious companions might be made between  
the inhabitants of one state, and those or ano­  
ther, and that no oppressions or embarraflinents  
lhould force the people to emigrate from one  
state to another. It would be a comfortable re­  
flection, if every part of the union could be alii­  
milated in this instance ; but, fir, I think we have  
110 authority to facrifice eflential confederations,  
to obtain these advantages. Nor do I know that  
we fhouldobtain them by aflumitig the (late dews.  
Supposing that measure to be adopted, let us re­  
flect, wtiac would be thefituation of the different |  
parts of the union. 1 do not, at this moment, .  
confide&#x27;r the queftionas it respects justice, right, 1  
or general policy, but in reference merely to the  
particular consequence of equalizing the circum­  
stances of the people. Let us take a view com­  
paratively, of the people ot the United States.—  
Maflachufetts owes a debt of several millions.  
The public debt, when you come to analyze it,  
at least where it is due to citizens and not to fo­  
reigners, is a debt from one part of the people to  
the other. The government is the collector from  
the pockets of the debtors to pay it into the hands  
of the creditors. If, fir, the state debts should be  
a (fumed, Maflachufetts will then get rid of her  
embarrallinents ; but what would be the lituati  
on of Virginia ? Besides her public debt, I be­  
lieve that her citizens owe, one to another, debts  
to an amount, equal to the whole public debt of  
Maflachufetts, perhaps 1 might fay to the amount  
of both the public and private debts of that state.  
111 addition to all this, the people of Virginia are  
indebted to foreigners to a greater amount than  
the whole debt of Maflachufetts. Sir, I firmly be  
lieve that though Virginia is less opprefled with  
public debt than Maflachufetts, yet when we take  
a view of all the difficulties (he labors under, and  
weigh them against those of Maflachufetts, it will  
be found that Virginia ought to be relieved her­  
felf instead of being expected to relieve others.  
But, supposing all objections of anothci nature to be laid aside,  
I freely confcfs that after a more minuteexamimtion into the fub­  
jefh I am much inclined to doubt whether the aflumption can  
poflibly be carried into execution. Difficulties are continually a­  
rifingiwhcn I survey this question, for which I can find no solu­  
tion, without departing from every principle by which we ought  
to be guided. It never yet has been shewn in what manner a re­  
medy could be provided for a partial fubfeription. Supoofe the  
state creditors were part of them to fubferibe and part torefufe.  
Suppose those of one state fubferibe, and those of another should  
not. Again, Sir, by what method would you discriminate the  
debts that come under the definition, from those that will be ex­  
cluded by it p Where will you invest this important discretionary  
power. I really think th;it great viifficulties will be found betore  
this can be effe£tcd. There is another objettion, to which I have  
; never heard a fatisfaftory answer, although it has been repeatedly  
| urged bv a member from Georgia. There are debts cxifting in  
I some of the states that do not bear interest:, that have got into cir­  
! culation without any title to it, and have been received by the  
present holders without any other expc&amp;ation than that in some  
reasonable time the principal would be paid. Would it, fir, be  
proper 01 iteceffary toconfider these as debts ot the union, bearing  
interest, or to provide for the immediate funding of th&lt; m ? Bu:  
there is a in my opinion, far more difficult, I mean the pa­  
per money iflfued to redeem the state debts. The state of North-  
Carolina has taken up its certificates with these paper bills. They  
are not proposed to be included in the aflumption. They are  
clearly excluded by the present motion, yet they are as much a  
state debt to be funk by taxes as certificates, and the taxes may as  
much interfere with those of other states. Some of the stats, fir,  
have not only a (Turned the debts recommended by Congress for  
making up the depreciation to the army, but they have gone fur­  
ther and have made up the depreciation, where it was not recom­  
mended. Other states have not done this. The debts existing in  
some states I take it for granted comprehend these deprecia ion  
notes. Would it not be unjust to call on those &quot;states that have not  
made this provision for their army that other Hates have done,  
would it not be hard to call upon those officers and soldiers who  
have not received this additional compensation, to pay it to those  
of othei il«tes, who have? J would oot here be under (loci lo ceri­  
  
458  
  
fare the ftstcs that made tins compensation, I rather ct&gt;rrtrvic:!i  
them for it. It is a proof of their magnanimity and justice t|U(  
does them hftnor, but at the fame time this dues not alter the na,  
tine of thcobjeftion. In some ftatcs, in order to reward the ar&lt;  
mv, they have done it by several aids that do not conftitme an,,  
part of the state debts. In foine of the flues there are debts ftifi  
unliquidated. If you declare that, when liquidated, they (hall  
be atfumed, you afford a temptation that has been hitherto rauti.  
onQv avoided, that of making the Hates less exatt in the fettle*  
men&#x27;t of their accounts. I do not find that any gentleman lias pro­  
pofi d, on the contrary most of them seem t &gt; have rcjefted the idea  
of making provision at this feflion tor fulfilling the engagements  
in cate we ent&#x27;r into an aifumption. I think it would be a  
powerful and unanfweiable objection against affnming the state  
debts at this lime, that we do not fee or are not prepared to dc­  
cide on the means of provid ing for them. There is not a more  
important and fundamental pnnciple in leaiflition, than that the  
ways and means ought always to i&#x27;«ce the public enga-cmcm*;  
that our appropriations fhoold go hand in hand with our prom -  
fes. To lay that the United States Should be aufwerahle for twen­  
ty-five millions of dollars without knowing whether the ways  
and means can be provided, and without knowing whether tho&#x27;i&#x27;e  
who arc to succeed iy&gt; will think with us on the fubj ifl, would be  
ralh and unjuftifiablc. Sir, in my opinion, it would be hazard­  
ing the public faith in a manner contrary to every idea of pru­  
dence. It is very true, fir, that a v :riety ot funds have been pro­  
posed, yet they are nothing more than mere fuggeftiom, and the/  
&#x27; I think they are as good as could be expefled in the time, I really  
believe that some of them, at least, if they can be carried into exe­  
cution at all, will disappoint the calculations on which thev are  
founded. , . .  
I cannot finifh my obfcrvations on tnis lubjctt.fir, without a.-&lt;.  
verting to one particular, which I would with gentlemen to attend  
to, not so much for our fakes as their own. I would recommend  
to them no longer to alTume a pre-eminence over us in the nation­  
ality of their^mouves; and that they would forbear those freqtrnt  
affeitioos, that if the llate debts are not provided for, the fed-rt  
debts shall also go unprovided for ; nay, that it the state debts a-?  
notaffumed, the Union will be endangered. Sir, lam perfuadei­  
that if th-gentlemen knew the motives which govern ut, they  
would blulh at such intemperate as well as inconliftent langm-..  
I am sure that if they knew the emoti-nj with which it is   
they would at least lee the inutility of it. I hope, Sit, that who­  
ever may be thedecifion on this qneftionof aflumptiou.tha; put:-,  
otifin and every other noble and generous motive will lead ei;  
minority to acquiefee in mealurcs which will tend to cftaM.ih  
public credit by a due provision for the public engagements.

question on proper principles, but his arguments appeared to be  
exceedingly fallacious. He alledged, •• that it had been contend­
