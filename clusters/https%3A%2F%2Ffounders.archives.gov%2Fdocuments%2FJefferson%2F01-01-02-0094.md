The Association entered into by the American [Conti]nental Congress in Behalf of all the Colo[nies]  
We his Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Delegates of the several Colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Three Lower Counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, deputed to represent them in a Continental Congress, held in the City of Philadelphia on the 5th Day of September 1774, avowing our Allegiance to his Majesty, our Affection and Regard for our Fellow Subjects in Great Britain and elsewhere, affected with the deepest Anxiety, and most alarming Apprehensions at those Grievances and Distresses with which his Majesty’s American Subjects are oppressed, and having taken under our most serious Deliberation the State of the whole Continent, find that the present unhappy Situation of our Affairs is occasioned by a ruinous System of Colony Administration, adopted by the British Ministry about the Year 1763, evidently calculated for enslaving these Colonies,  and, with them, the British Empire: In Prosecution of which System, various Acts of Parliament have been passed for raising a Revenue in America, for depriving the American Subjects, in many Instances, of the constitutional Trial by Jury, exposing their Lives to Danger, by directing a new and illegal Trial beyond the Seas, for Crimes alledged to have been committed in America; and, in Prosecution of the same System, several late, cruel, and oppressive Acts, have been passed respecting the Town of Boston and the Massachusetts Bay, and also an Act for extending the Province of Quebeck, so as to border on the western Frontiers of these Colonies, establishing an arbitrary Government therein, and discouraging the Settlement of British Subjects in that wide-extended Country; thus, by the Influence of civil Principles, and ancient Prejudices, to dispose the Inhabitants to act with Hostility against the free Protestant Colonies, whenever a wicked Ministry shall choose so to direct them.  
To obtain Redress of these Grievances, which threaten Destruction to the Lives, Liberty, and Property, of his Majesty’s Subjects in North America, we are of Opinion that a Non-importation, Non-consumption, and Non-exportation Agreement, faithfully adhered to, will prove the most speedy, effectual, and peaceable Measure; and therefore we do, for ourselves and the Inhabitants of the several Colonies whom we represent, firmly agree and associate, under the sacred Ties of Virtue, Honour, and Love of our Country, as follows:  
First. That from and after the first Day of December next we will not import into British America, from Great Britain or Ireland, any Goods, Wares, or Merchandise whatsoever, or from any other Place, any such Goods, Wares, or Merchandise, as shall have been exported from Great Britain or Ireland; nor will we, after that Day, import any East India Tea from any Part of the World, nor any Molosses, Syrups, Paneles, Coffee, or Pimenta, from the British Plantations, or from Dominica, nor Wines from Madeira, or the Western Islands, nor foreign Indigo.  
Second. That we will neither import nor purchase any Slave imported after the first Day of December next, after which Time we will wholly discontinue the Slave Trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our Vessels, nor sell our Commodities or Manufactures, to those who are concerned in it.  
Third. As a Non-consumption Agreement, strictly adhered to, will be an effectual Security for the Observation of the Non-importation, we, as above, solemnly agree and associate, that, from this Day, we will not purchase or use any Tea imported on Account of the East India Company, or any on which a Duty hath been or shall be paid; and, from and after the first Day of March next, we will not purchase or use any East India Tea whatever: Nor will we, nor shall any Person for or under us, purchase or use any of those Goods, Wares, or Merchandise, we have agreed not to import, which we shall know, or have Cause to suspect, were imported after the first Day of December, except such as come under the Rules and Directions of the tenth Article, hereafter mentioned.  
  
Fourth. The earnest Desire we have not to injure our Fellow Subjects in Great Britain, Ireland, or the West Indies, induces us to suspend a Non-exportation until the tenth Day of September 1775; at which Time, if the said Acts, and Parts of Acts of the British Parliament herein after mentioned, are not repealed, we will not, directly or indirectly, export any Merchandise, or Commodity whatsoever, to Great Britain, Ireland, or the West Indies, except Rice, to Europe.  
Fifth. Such as are Merchants, and use the British and Irish Trade, will give Orders, as soon as possible, to their Factors, Agents, and Correspondents, in Great Britain and Ireland, not to ship any Goods to them, on any Pretence whatsoever, as they cannot be received in America; and if any Merchant residing in Great Britain or Ireland shall, directly or indirectly, ship any Goods, Wares, or Merchandise, for America, in Order to break the said Non-importation Agreement, or in any Manner contravene the same, on such unworthy Conduct being well attested, it ought to be made publick; and, on the same being so done, we will not, from thenceforth, have any commercial Connexion with such Merchant.  
Sixth. That such as are Ow[ners] of Vessels will give positive Orders to their Captains, or Masters, n[ot to] receive on Board their Vessels any Goods prohibited by the said Non-importation Agreement, on Pain of immediate Dismission from their Service.  
Seventh. We will use our utmost Endeavours to improve the Breed of Sheep, and increase their Number to the greatest Extent; and to that End we will kill them as sparingly as may be, especially those of the most profitable Kind: Nor will we export any to the West Indies, or elsewhere. And those of us who are or may become overstocked with, or can conveniently spare any Sheep, will dispose of them to our Neighbours, especially to the poorer Sort, on moderate Terms.  
Eighth. That we will, in our several Stations, encourage Frugality Economy, and Industry; and promote Agriculture, Arts, and the Manufactures of this Country, especially that of Wool; and will discountenance and discourage every Species of Extravagance and Dissipation, especially all Horse-racing, and all Kinds of Gaming, Cock-fighting, Exhibitions of Shows, Plays, and other expensive Diversions and Entertainments; and on the Death of any Relation, or Friend, none of us, or any of our Families, will go into any farther Mourning Dress than a black Crape or Riband on the Arm or Hat for Gentlemen, and a black Riband and Necklace for Ladies, and we will discontinue the giving of Gloves and Scarfs at Funerals.  
Ninth. That such as are Venders of Goods or Merchandise will not take Advantage of the Scarcity of Goods that may be occasioned by this Associacion, but will sell the same at the Rates we have been respectively accustomed to do for twelve Months last past; and if any Venders of Goods or Merchandise shall sell any such Goods on higher Terms, or shall in any Manner, or by any Device whatsoever, violate or depart from this Agreement, no Person ought, nor will any of us deal with any such Person, or his or her Factor or Agent, at any Time thereafter, for any Commodity whatever.  
  
Tenth. In Case any Merchant, Trader, or other Persons, shall import any Goods or Merchandise after the first Day of December, and before the first Day of February next, the same ought forthwith, at the Election of the Owner, to be either reshipped or delivered up to the Committee of the County or Town wherein they shall be imported, to be stored at the Risk of the Importer, until the Non-importation Agreement shall cease, or be sold under the Direction of the Committee aforesaid: And, in the last mentioned Case, the Owne[r or owners of such goods shall be reim]bursed (out of the Sales) the [first cost and charges, the profit, if any,] to be applied towards relievi[ng and employing such poor inhabitants of] the Town of Boston as are im[mediate sufferers by the Boston Port Bill,] and a particular Account of all [goods so returned, stored, or sold, to be] inserted in the publick Papers. A[nd if any goods or merchandizes shall be] imported after the said first Day [of February the same ought forthwith] to be sent back again, without br[eaking any of the packages thereof.]  
Eleventh. That a Committee b[e chosen in every County, City, and] Town, by those who are qualifi[ed to vote for representatives in the] Legislature, whose Business it shall [be attentively to observe the conduct] of all Persons touching this Assoc[iation; and when it shall be made to] appear, to the Satisfaction of a Maj[ority of any such Committee that any] Person within the Limits of their Ap[pointment has violated this associa]tion, that such Majority do forthwith [cause the truth of the case to be] published in the Gazette, to the End [that all such foes to the rights of] British America may be publickly known [and universally contemned as] the Enemies of American Liberty; and th[ence forth we respectively will] break off all Dealings with him, or her.  
Twelfth. That the Committee of Corre[spondence, in the respective] Colonies do frequently inspect the Entries [of their Custom Houses, and] inform each other, from Time to Time, of t[he true state thereof and of] every other material Circumstance that ma[y occur relative to this asso]ciation.  
Thirteenth. That all Manufactures of [this country be sold at reason]able Prices, so that no undue Advantage [be taken of a future scarcity of] Goods.  
Fourteenth. And we do farther agr[ee and resolve, that we will have] no Trade, Commerce, Dealings, o[r intercourse whatsoever, with any] Colony or Province in North Ame[rica, which shall not accede to, or] which shall hereafter violate, thi[s association, but will hold them as] unworthy of the Rights of Free[men, and as inimical to the liberties of] their Country.  
And we do solemnly bind [ourselves and our Constituents under the] Ties aforesaid, to adhere to th[is Association until such parts of the several] Acts of Parliament, passed sin[ce the Close of the last War as impose or] continue Duties on Tea, Wine, [Molosses, Syrups, paneles], Coffee, Sugar, Pimenta, Indigo, foreign Pap[er, glass] and Painters Colours, imported into America, and extend the Powers of the Admiralty Courts beyond their ancient Limits, deprive the American Subject of  Trial by Jury, authorise the Judge’s Certificate to indemnify the Prosecutor from Damages that he might otherwise be liable to from a Trial by his Peers, require oppressive Security from a Claimant of Ships or Goods seized before he shall be allowed to defend his Property, are repealed; and until that Part of the Act of the 12th of George III. Chapter 24th, entitled “An Act for the better securing his Majesty’s Dockyards, Magazines, Ships, Ammunition, and Stores,” by which any Persons charged with committing any of the Offences therein described in America may be tried in any Shire or County within the Realm, is repealed; and until the four Acts passed in the last Session of Parliament, viz. that for stopping the Port and blocking up the Harbour of Boston, that for altering the Charter and Government of Massachusetts Bay; and that which is entitled “An Act for the better Administration of Justice, &amp;c.” and that “For extending the Limits of Quebeck, &amp;c.” are repealed. And we recommend it to the Provincial Conventions, and to the Committees in the respective Colonies, to establish such farther Regulations as they may think proper, for carrying into Execution this Association.  
The foregoing Association being determined upon by the Congress, was ordered to be subscribed by the several Members thereof; and thereupon, we have hereunto set our respective Names accordingly.

Congreſs, held in the city of Philadelphia, on the fifth  
  
day of September, 1774, avowing our allegiance to  
his Majeſiy, our affection and regard for our fellow -

the deepeſt anxiety, and moſt alarming apprehenſionls  
at thoſe Grievances and diſtreſſes, with which his Ma-  
jeſty&#x27;s American ſubjects are oppreſſed, and having taken  
under our moſt ſerious deliberation, the ſtate of the

of our affairs, is occaſioned by a ruinous ſyſtem of co  
  
92 Iony- adminiſtration adopted by the Britiſh Miniftry +  
  
* about the year 1763, evidently calculated for enflaviog |  
  
bheſe Colonies, and, with them, the Britiſh Empire.  
In proſecution-of which ſyſtem, various Acts ef Par-

| inſtances, of the conſtitutional trial by jury, expeſing  
their lives to danger, by directing a new and illegal  
trial deyond the ſeas, for crimes alledged to have been  
committed in America: And in proſecution” of the  
ſame ſyſtem, ſeveral late, eruel, and opprefiive Acts  
have been p:fied reſpecting the town of Boſton aud  
the Maſſachuſetts- Bay, and alſo an Act for extending  
the province of Quebec, fo as to border on the weſlern

chat a non - impor tation, non conſumption, and non -  
exportation agreement, faithfully adhered to, will  
prove the molt ſpeedy, effectual, and peaceable mea-  
. Jure : - And therefore we do, for ourſelves; and the in-  
 Habitants of the ſeveral Colonies, whom we repreſent,  
firmly agree and aſſociate under the ſacred ties of virtue, |  
honor, aud love of our country, as follows:  
Firſt. That from and after the ficit day of Decem-

ported from Great Britain or Iceland; nor will we,  
after that day, i import anyEaft India tea from any part  
of the world; nor auy molaſſes, iyrrups, paneles,

weill we hire our veſſels, nor {ell our commodities or  
manufactures to thoſe who are concerned in it. .  
Third. As a non-conſumption agreement, ſtrictly  
adhered.to, will be an effectual ſecurity for the obſer-  
vation of the non-importation, we, as above, ſolemnly  
agree and aſſociate, that, from this day, we wil) not  
purchaſe or ule any tea imported on account of the  
Eaſt - India company, or any on which a duty hath  
bees or ſhall be paid; and ſrom and after the firſt day

The As Ss OOMIAT IO N. Se.  
  
W E his Majeſty&#x27;s moſt loyal Subjects, the Delegates  
| of the ſeveral Colonies of New-Hampſhire,  
Maſſachuſetts Bay, Rhode Iſland, Connecticut, New-  
York, New- Jerſey, Pennſylvania, the Three Lower  
Counties of Neweaſtle. Kent, and Suſſex, on Delaware,  
Maryland, Virginia, North-Caroliaa, and South-Caro- |  
lina, deputed to repreſent them in a continental /  
Congreſs, held in the city of Philadelphia, on the fifth f  
day of September, 1774, avowing our allegiance to  
his Majefly, our affection and regard for our fellow-  
ſubjects in Great-Britain and elſewhere, affected with  
the deepeſt anxiety, and moft alarming apprehenſions  
at thoſe Grievances and diſtreſſes, with which his Ma-  
jeſty&#x27;s American ſubjects are oppreſſed, and having taken  
under our molt ſerious deliberation, the ſtate of the  
whole continent, find, that the preſent unhappy ſituation  
of our affairs, is occaſioned by a ruinous ſyſtem of co-  
_ lony-adminiftration adopted by the Britiſh Miniſtry  
4 about the year 1763, evidently calculated for enſlaviog  
theſe Colonies, and, with them, the Britiſh Empire.  
In proſecution of which ſyſtem, various Acts of Par-  
liament bave been paſſed for raiſing a Revenue ia ;  
America, far depriving the American ſubjects, in many |  
inſtances, of the conſtitutional trial by jury, expoſing  
their lives to danger, by directing a new and illegal  
trial beyond the ſeas, for crimes alledged to have been |  
committed ia America: And in proſecution of the .  
fame ſyſtem, ſeveral late, cruel, and oppreſſive Acts |  
have been pyſſed reſpecting the town of Bolton and  
the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and alſo an Act for extending  
the province of Quebec, ſo as to border on the weſtern  
frontiers of theſe Colonies, eſtabliſhing an arbitrary  
government therein, and diſcouraging the ſettlement  
of Britiſh ſubjeQs in that wide extended country; thne&#x27;  
by the influence of civil principles and ancient prejudi-  
ces to diſpoſe the inhabitants to act with hoſtility  
again the free Proteſtant Colonies, whenever a wicked  
Miavtry thall chuſe ſo to direct them. |  
To ohtaid redreſs of theſe grievances, which threat-&#x27;  
en deſtruction to the lives, liberty, and property of his  
Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects in North-America, we are of opit ion,  
n I. | | that  
  
— *  
  
nn  
  
—  
  
that a non-importation, non-conſumption, and non»  
exportation agreement, faithfully adhered to, will  
prove the moſt ſpeedy, effectual, and peaceable mea-  
  
ure: - And therefore we do, for ourſelves, and the in-  
habitants of the ſeveral Colonies, whom we repreſent,  
firmly agree and aſſociate under the ſacred ties of virtue,  
honor, and love of our country, as follows:  
  
Firſt, That from and after the ficſt day of Decem-  
ber next, we will not import into Britiſh America, from  
Great-Britain or Ireland, any goods, wares or mer-  
chandize whatſoever, or from any other place any juch  
yPooOds, wares or merchandize, as ſhall have been ex-  
ported from Great Britain or Iceland; nor will we,  
after that day, import any Eaſt India tea from any part  
of the world; nor any molaſſes, iyrrups, paneles,  
coffee, or piemento, from the Britiſh plantations, or  
from Dominica; nor wines from Madeira, or the Weſt-  
ern [lands ; nor foreign Indigo. i  
  
Second. That we will neither import, nor purchaſe  
any {lave imported after the iſt day of December next,  
after which time, we will wholly diſcontinue the ſlave-  
trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourſ-lves, nor  
will we hire our veſſels, ner {el! our commodities or  
manufactures ts thoſe who are concerned in it,  
  
Third. As a non-cenſumption agreement, ſtrictly  
adhered to, will be an effectual ſecur ty for the obſer-  
vation of the non-importation, we, as above, iv!emnly  
agree and aſſociate, that, from this day, we will not  
purchaſe or. uſe any tea imported on account of the  
Eaſt-India company, or any on which a duty haih  
been or ſhall be paid; and ſrom and after the firſt day  
of March next, we will not purchaſe or uſe any Ealt-  
India tea whatever, nor will we, nor ſhall any perſon  
for or under us, purchaſe or uſe any of thoſe goods,  
wares, or merchandize, we have agreed not to import,  
which we ſhall know, or have cauſe to ſuſpect, were  
imported after the firſt day of December, except ſuch  
as come under the rules and directions of the tenth  
article hereafter mentioned. N 2  
  
Fourth. The earneſt deſire we have, not to injure  
  
our fellow. ſubjects in Great-Britain, Ireland, or the  
Weſt - Indies, induces us to ſuſpend a non- exportation  
um il the tcath day of September, 1775; at which  
  
; os tim  
  
—  
  
E  
time if the ſaid Acts and parts of Ads of the Britiſh  
parliament, herein after mentioned, are not repealed,  
we will not, dicectly or indiredly, export any mer-  
chandue or commodity whatſoever, to Great Britain,  
Ireland or he Welt Indies, except Rice to Europe.  
  
Filth, Such as are merchants, and uſe the Eritifh  
and [riſh Trace, will give orders, as ſoon as poflible,  
to their factors, agents and correſpondents, in Great-  
Britain and treland, not to ſhip any goods to them on  
any pretence whaiſ-ever, as they cannet be received  
in America; and if aiy merchant re{iding in Great-  
  
Britain or Ireland, ſhall directly or indireQ&#x27;y ſhip any  
goods, wares or merchandize, tor America, in order  
to break the ſaid non impertation agreement, or in  
any manner contravene the fame, on ſuch unworthy  
conduct being well teſtedut aagut ta be made public;  
and, on the ſame baug lo done, we will not from  
thenceforth have any commercial connex.on with ſuch  
merchant. |  
  
Sixth. That ſuch as are owners of veſſels will give  
poſi-:ve orders to their captains, or malters, not to re-  
ceive on board their veſſels any goods prohibited by the  
faid non importation agreement, on pain of immediate  
dit niſſion from their ſervice, |  
  
S-venth, We will uſe our utmoſt endeavours to im-  
prove the breed of ſheep and iacreale their numbers to  
the greateſt extent, aud to that end, we will kill them  
as ſparingly as may be, eſpecially thoſe of the mott  
profitable kind; nor will we export any to the Welt-  
Indies, or elſewhere ; and thofe of us who are or may  
become overſtocked with, cr can convenientiy ſpare  
any ſheep, will diſpoſe of them to our neighbours, eſ-  
pecially to the poorer ſort, on moderate terms,  
  
Eight. That we will in our ſeveral tations encourage  
Irugality, economy, and induſtry ; and promote agri-  
culture, arts, and the manufaQures ef this country,  
eſpecially that of wool ; and will diſcountenance and  
diſcourage, every ſpecies of extravagance? and diſſipation,  
eſpecially all horſe-racing, and a&#x27;l kinds of gaming,  
cock fighting, exbibitions of ſhews, plays, a d other  
expenſive diverſions and entertainments, And on rhe  
death of any relation or friend, none of us, or any of  
our families, wil! go into any further munrnoiyg drets,

than a black crap or ribbon on the arm or hat for  
Gentlemen, and a black ribbon and necklace forLadies,  
and we will diſcontinue the giving of gloves and ſcarf  
at funerals. | | |  
Ninth, That ſuch as are venders of goods or mer-  
 .Chandize, will not take advantage of the ſcarcity of  
goods that may be occaſioned by this aſſociation, but  
will fell the ſame at the rates we have been reſpectively  
accuſtomed to do, for twelve months laſt paſt.—And  
if any vender of goods or merchandize, ſhall ſell any  
ſuch goods on higher terms, or ſhall in any manner,  
or by any device whatſoever, violate or depart from this  
agreement, no perſon ought, nor will any of us deal  
with any ſuch perſon, or his or her factor or agent, at  
any time thereafter, for any commodity whatever,  
Tenth, In caſe any merchant, trader, or other per-  
ſons ſhall import any goods or merchandize after the  
firſt day of December, and before the firſt Day of  
February next, the ſame ought forthwith at the election  
of the owner, to be either re-ſhipped or delivered up  
to the committee of the county, or town wherein they  
ſhall be imported, to be ſtored at the riſque of the im-  
porter, until the non-importation agreement ſhall ceaſe,  
or be ſold under the direQion of the committee atore-  
ſaid ; and in the laſt mentioned caſe, the owner or ow-  
ners of ſuch goods, ſhall be reimburſed (out of che  
ſales) the firſt colt and charges, the profit if any, to be  
applied towards relieving and employing ſuch poor  
inhabitants of the town of Boſton, as are immediate  
ſufferers by the Boſten Port-Bill ; and a particular ac-  
count of all goods fo returned, Rored, or fold, to be  
inſerted in the public papers; and if any goods or  
merchandizes ſhall be imported after the ſaid firſt day  
of February, the ſame ought forthwith to be ſent back  
again, without breaking any of the packages thereof.  
Eleventh, That a committee be choſen in every  
county, city, and town, by thofe who are qualified to  
vote for Repreſentatives ia the Legiſlature, whoſe bu-  
ſineſs it ſhall be attentively to obſerve the conduct of all  
perſons touchiog this aſſociation; and when it ſhall be  
made to appear to the ſatisfaction of a majority of any  
ſuch committee, that any perſon within the limits of  
their appoiatment has violated this aſſociation, hot  
| tuc  
  
—  
  
£356 i.  
  
Wh &quot;$6 A  
  
fuch majority do forthwith cauſe the truth of the caſe  
to be publiſhed in the Tazette, to the end that all ſuch  
foes ito the rights of Britiſh America may be publicly  
known, and univerſally contemned as the enemies of  
American liberty; and thenceforth we reſpectively  
will break off all dealings with him or her.  
  
Twelfth, That the committee of correſpondence in  
the reſpective colonies do frequently inſpect the entries  
of their cuſtom-houſes, and inform each other from  
time to time of the, true ſtate thereof, and of every  
other material circumſtance that may occur relative to  
this aſſociation.  
  
Thirteenth, That all manufactures of this country  
be ſold at reaſonable prices, ſo that no undus advan-  
tage be taken of a future ſcarcity of goods,  
  
Fourteenth, And we do further agree and reſolve,  
that we will have no trade, commerce, dealings or in-  
tercourſe whatſoever, with any colony or province, in  
North-America, which ſhall not accede to, or which  
ſhall hereafter violate this aſſociation, but will hold  
them as unworthy of the rights of freemen, and as ini-  
mical to the liberties of their country.  
  
And we do ſolemnly bind ourſelves and our conſtitu-  
ents, under the ties aforeſaid, to adhere to this aſſo-  
ciation until ſuch parts of the ſeveral Acts of parliamept  
paſſed ſince the cloſe of the laſt war, as impoſe or con

Kent and Suſſex on Delaware, Maryland,  
Virginia, North-Carolina, and South-Carolina,  
deputed to repreſent them in a continental Con-  
  
reſs held in the city of Philadelphia, on the  
fifth day of September, 1774, avowing our al-  
legiance to his Majeity, our affection and re-

and molt alarming apprehenſions at thoſe griev-  
ances and diſtreſſes, with which his Majeſty&#x27;s  
American ſubjects are oppreſſed, and having  
taken under our moſt ſerious deliberation, the

ſent unhappy ſituation of our affairs is occalion-  
ed by a ruinous ſyſtem of colony adminiſtration  
adopted by the Britiſh Miniſtry about the year  
1763, evidently calculated for inſlaving theſe  
Colomes, and, with them, the Britiſh Empire.  
In proſecution of which ſyſtem, various Acts  
of Parliament have been paſied for raiſing a  
Revenue in America, tor depriving the Ameri-  
can ſubjects, 1n many inſtances, ot the conſtitu-

mitted in America: And in proſecution of  
&#x27; the ſame ſyſtem, ſeveral late, cruel, and oppreſ-

of Boſton and the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and alſo

ſo as to border on the weſtern frontiers of theſe  
Colonies, eſtabliſhing an arbitrary government

Britiſh ſubjects in that wide extended country;

ancient prejudices to diſpoſe the inhabitants to  
act. with hoſtility againſt the free Proteſtant Co-  
lonies, whenever a wicked Miniſtry {hall chule  
ſo to direct them,  
  
To obtain redreſs of theſe grievances, which  
threaten. deſtruction to the lives, liberty, and  
property of his Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects in North-  
America, we are of opinion, that a non-impor-

agreement, faithfully adhered to, will prove the  
moſt ſpeedy, effectual, and peaceable meaſure :  
And therefore wedo, for — and the inhabi-

avg. wares or merchandize whatſoever, or

wholly diſcontinue the ſlave trade, and will  
neither be concerned in it ourſelves, nor will we  
hire our veſſels, nor fell our commodities or  
manufactures to thoſe who are concerned in it.  
  
Third. As a non-conſumption agreement,  
ſtrictly adhered to, will be an effectual ſecurity  
for the obſervation of the non- importation, we,  
as above, ſolemnly agree and aſſociate, that,  
ſrom this day, we will not purchaſe or uſe any  
Tea imported on account of the Eaſt-India com-

the present unhappy fituatfon of our affairs, M oaafioned by  
a ruinous Mem «f wlonv adm niU.ation adopted by the  
WtWh Min&#x27;lfry about the year rbt, evidently calculated for

In pmfeention of which fyflem, various Afi* ot Parliament

Proceedings of the Grand American Continental Congrels at rhiladeipbia, deprember §y 177 4 Qt  
  
;, ASSOCIATION, &amp;c.  
E his Majesty’s most loyal Subjeéts,  
i the Delcﬁtcs of the feveralColonies  
5\ X\ of New-Hampshire, Maflachutetts­  
3Bay, Rhode- Ifland,Connecticut, New-Yorx,  
iNew-Jerfey, Pennsylvania, the three lower  
:Counties of New -Caflle, Kent and Sussex, on  
&amp;)eleware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Caro­  
ina, and South-Carolina,deputed to represent  
?hemin a Continental Congress, held in the  
yCity of Philadelphia, onthe fifth Day of Sep­  
?em.ber, 1774, avowing our Allegiance to his  
yMajefty,our Affection and Regard for our Fel­  
;low-Subje&amp;&#x27;s in Great-Brirain and elsewhere,  
affeCted with the deepest Anxiety, and most  
;alarming Apprehensions at those Grievances  
;mdj&#x27;Diﬁreﬂ&#x27;es, with which his Majesty’s Ame­  
rican Subjeéts are opprefled,and having taken  
lundér our most serious Deliberation the State  
;b&#x27;f“ the whole Continent, find,that the present  
;u&quot;nha,ppy Situation of our Affairs, is occasioned  
by a ruinous System of Colony Adminifiration,  
iadopted by the BritithMiniftry about theYear  
1763, evidently calculated for enslaving these  
yColonies, and, with them, theßritith Empire.  
[n Prosecution of which Syitem, various Acts  
jof Parliament have been passed tfor raising a  
Revenue in America, for depriving the Ame­  
;rican Subjets in many Instances, of the Con-  
Aitutional Trial by Jury, exposing their Lives  
gt&#x27;o Danger, by directing a new &amp; illegal Try­  
ill beyond the Seas, for Crimes alledged to  
have been committed in America; and in  
iProfecution of the fame System, several late,  
scruel, and oppressive Aés, have been passed  
2refpecting the Town of Boston and the Mas­  
-3 achufetts-Bay, and alfoan A¢t for extending  
2 he Province of Quebec {o as to border on the  
EWéﬁ&#x27;em Frontiers of thefeColonies, eftablifh­  
iing an Arbitrary Government therein, and  
{ifcouraging the Settlement of BritifhSubjects  
§i,n that wide extended Country ; thus by the  
!Influence of civil Principles and ancient Pre­  
sjudices to difpnfe the Inhabitants to a&amp;t with  
;hoﬁi‘lity against the free Protestant Colonies,  
swhenever a wicked Ministry shall choose so  
2to direct them.  
&gt; To obtainßedrefs of thefeGrievances,which  
;threaten Deftrué&amp;ion to the Lives, Liberty &amp;  
iProperty of his Majesty’s Subjects in North-  
I America, we are of Opinion that 2 Non-Im­  
yportation, Non-Consumption, and Non-Ex-  
Sbortation Agreement faithfully adhered to,  
gwill prove the most speedy effectual, &amp; peace­  
;. e Measure :—=And therefore we do for our­  
{e.ves, and the Inhabitants of the several Co­  
lonies, whom we represent, firmly agree and  
2affociate under the sacred Ties of Virtue,Ho­  
?nor, and Love of our Country, as follows :  
.. First, That from and after the firft Day of  
sDecember next, we will not import into Bri­  
ctith America, from Great-Britain or Ireland,  
3any Goods, Wares or Merchandize whatsoe­  
ver, or frem any other Place any such Goods,  
sWares or Merchandize,as shall have been ex-  
Iported from Great-Britain or Ireland ; nor  
swill we, after that Day, import any Eaft-In­  
gdin Tea from any Part of theWorld ; norany  
sMolafles, Syrups, Paneles,Coftee, or Piemen­  
3to, from the Britifli Plantations, or from Do­  
:ninica ; nor Wines fromMedeira, or theWel­  
stern Islands ; not foreign Indigo.  
3 Second, That we. will neither import nor  
Epurcha (e any Slave imported after the liDay  
ot December next, after which Time we will  
Swholly discontinue the Slave Trade, and will  
sneither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will  
3we hire our Veffels,nor fell ourCommoditiesor  
&gt; Vlanufa“ures to those who are concern’din it,  
S Third, As a Non-Consumption Agreement,  
siri@ly adhered to wili be an effectual Securi-  
Sy for the Observation of the Non-Importa­  
gtinn, we, as above, solemnly agree and affo-  
Seiate, that from this Day, we will not pur­  
-2 -hafe cruse any Tea imported on Account  
*.f the Fast-India Company, or any on which  
22 Duty hath been or shall be paid ; and from  
alnd after the 1t Day of March next, we will  
&lt;ot purchase or use any Eaft-IndiaTea what-  
Zever, nor will we, nor shall any Person for or  
1, nder us, purchase or ufz any of thofeGoods,  
%V ares or Merchandize, we have agreed not  
2’(» import, which we thall know or haveCaufe  
Zto fufpeét, were imported after the firft Day  
Cnf December, except such as&lt;come under the  
sßules &amp; Directiens of the tenth Article here-  
Qafter mentioned. sedepd PR b  
  
Fourth, The earnest Desire. we have, not to  
injure our Fellow-Subjects in Great-Britain,  
Ireland, or the Wefi-Indies, induces us to fui­  
pend a Non-Exportation until the tenth Day  
of September, 1775 ; at&#x27; which Time if the  
said A&amp;s and Parts ot Aéts of the Britith Par­  
liameént, herein after mentioned, are not re­  
pealed, we will not, directly or indirectly, ex­  
port any Merchandize or Commodity what­  
soever, to Great- Britain, Ireland or theWeft-  
Indies, except Rice to Europe.  
Fifth. Such as are Merchants, and use the  
Britith and [rith Trade, will give Orders, as  
soon as poflible, to their.Faltors, Agents and  
Corre{pondents,in Great- Britain and Ireland,  
not to thip any Goods to them on-any Pretence  
whatsoever, as they cannot be received in A­  
merica ; and if any Merchant residing in G.  
Britain or Ireland, shall direétly or indireltly  
thip any Goods, Wares, or Merchandize, for  
America, inOrder to break the said Non-Im­  
portation Agreement, or in any Mannercon­  
travene the {ame, on {uch unworthy Conduct  
being well attested, it ought to be made pub­  
lic ; and on the fame being so done, we will  
not from thenceforth have any commercial  
Connexion with such Merchant. _  
Sixth. That such as are Owners of Veflels  
will give positive Orders to their Captains, or  
Maflers not to receive on board their Veflels  
any Goods prohibited by the said Non-Im­  
portation Agreement, on Pain of immediate  
Difmiffion from their Service. -  
Seventh. We will use our utmost Endeavours  
to improve the Breed of Sheep and increale  
their Number to the greatest Extent, and to  
that End, we will kill them as sparingly as  
may be,efpecizlly those of the moit profitable  
kind ; nor will exportany to the Weft-In­  
dies, or elsewhere ; and those of us who are  
or may become overstocked with, or cancon­  
veniently spare any Sheep, will dispose of  
them to our Neighbours, especially to the  
poorer Sort, on moderate Terms.  
Eight, That we will in our several Stations  
encousage Frugality, (Fconomy, and Indus­  
try ; and promote Agriculture, Aws, and the  
Manufactures of this Country, especially that  
of Wool ; and willdifcountenance and dis­  
courage, every Speciesof Extravagance and  
Diflipation, especially all Horse-Racing, and  
all Kinds of Gaming, Cock Fighting, Exhi­  
bitions of Shews, Plays, and other expensive  
Diversions and Entertainments. Andon the  
Death of any Relation, or Friend, none of us_  
or any of our Families, will go into any fur­  
ther Mourning Dress, thana black Crape or  
Ribbon on the Arm or Hat for Gentlemen,  
and a black Ribbonand Necklace for Ladies,  
and we will discontinue the giving of Gloves  
and Scarfs at Funerals. ,  
Ninth. &#x27;That such as-are Venders of Goods  
or Merchandize, will not take Advaniage of  
the Scarcity of Goods that may be occasioned  
by this Association, but will fell the fame at  
the Rates we have been refpetively accusto­  
med to do, for twelve Months last past.——  
And if any Vender of Goods orMerchandize,  
thall fell any such Goods on higher Terms,  
or shall in any Manner, or by any Device  
whatsoever, viclate or depart from this A­  
greement, no Person ought, nor will any. of  
us deal with any such Pérfon; or his or her  
Fadtor or Agent, at any Time thereafter, for  
any Commodity whatever.  
Tenth, In Case any Merchant, Trader, or  
other Persons fhallimport any Goods orMer­  
chandize after the firfDay ot February next,  
the fame ought forthwith at the Election of  
the Owner, to be either re-thipped, or deli­

the inhabitants of the feveral colonies,  
whom we reprefent, firmly agree and  
affociate under the facred ties of vir-  
tue, honour, and love of our country,  
as follows:  
  
Firft. That from and after the firft  
day of December next, we will not  
import into Britifh America, from  
Great-Britain or Ireland, any goods,  
wares or merchandize whatfoever, or  
from any other place any fuch &gt;  
wares or merchandize, as thall have  
been exported from Great Britain or  
Ireland ; nor will we, after that day,  
import any Eaft-India tea from any  
part of the world; nor any molaffes,

after which time, we will wholl  
difcontinue the flave-trade, and will  
neither be concerned in it ourfelves,

Third. As a _ non-confumption  
agreement, ftriftly adhered to, will  
be an effectual fecurity for the ob-  
fervation of the non-importation, we,  
as above, folemnly agree and affo~

mentioned. ;  
  
Fourth. The earneft defire we have,  
not to injure our fellow-fubjects in  
Great-Britain, Ireland, or the Weft-  
Indies, induces ws to fufpend a non-  
exportation, until the tenth day of  
September 1775; at which time, if  
the faid a¢ts and parts of acts of the  
Britith parliament herein after men-

Third, As a non-confumption agreement  
ftri&amp;tly adhered to, will be an effectual fecuri-  
ty for the obfervation of the non-importatlon,  
we, as above, folemnly agree and affociate,  
that from this day we will not purchafe or ufe  
any tea, imported on account of the Eaft-In-  
dia Company or any on which a duty hath  
been, or fhall be paid; and from and after the

pect were imported after the fir day of De-

and directions of the tenth article heseafter  
mentioned.  
  
Fourth. The earneft defire we have, not to  
injure our fellow fubjeéts in Great Britain,  
jreland or the Weft Indies, induces us to ful-  
pend a non-expertation, until the roth day of  
September 1775; at whichtime, if the faid  
aéts and parts of acts of the Britifh parhament  
herein after mentioned are not repealed, we will  
not direétly of indireéily export any merchin-  
dize or commodity whatfoever to Gieat Bri-  
tain, Ireland, or the Welt Indies, except rice  
to Europe.  
  
Fifth. Such as are merchants, and ufe the  
Britith and Irifh trade, will give orders as foon  
as poffible, to their faétors, agents and correi-  
pondents, in Great Britain and Ireland, not to  
fhip any geods to them, on any pretence whiat-  
fover, as they cannot be received in America ;  
and if any merchant refiding in Great Britain  
or Ireland, fhall dire€ly or indireétly fhip any  
goods, wares, or merchandize, for America,  
in order to break the faid non-importation  
agreement, or in any manner contravene the  
fame, on fach unworthy conduct being well  
attefted, it ought to be made public ; ,and, on  
the fame being fo done, we will not henceforth  
have any commercial connection with fuch

that end we will keep them as fparingly as  
may be, efpecially thofe of the moit profitable  
kind ; nor will we export any to the Weft  
Indies or elfewhere ; and thofe of us who are  
  
  
  
DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCER  
  
or may become over-ftecked with, or can con-  
veniently fpare any fheep, will difpofe-of  
them to our neighbours, efpecially to the peor.  
er fort, on moderate terms.  
  
Eigoth, That we will in our feveral ftations  
encourage frugality, ceconomy, and induftry,  
and promote agriculture, arts, and the manu-  
fectures of this country, efpecially that of  
wool ; and will diféeuntenance and difcourage  
every fpecies of extravagance and diffipation,  
e{peciaily all horfe-racing, and all kinds of game  
ing, cock-fighting, exhibitions of thews, plays,

Triend, none of us, or any of our families, will  
gointo any further mourning drefs than a  
black crape or ribbon on the arm or hat for  
gentlemen, and a black ribbon and neck&#x27;ace  
for ladies ; and we will difcontinue the giving  
Of gloves and fca: ves at funerals,  
  
Ninth. That fuch as are venders of goods  
or merchandize will not take advantage of the  
{carcity of goods that may be occafioned by this  
aflociation, but will fell the fame at the rates we  
have been refpectively accuftomed to do for  
twelve monihs laft paft. And if any vender of

her factor or agent, at any time thereafter, for  
any commodity whatever.  
  
Tenth, tn cafeany merchant, trader, or other  
perion, fhall import any goods or merchandize

ch Empue. In profecution of which ſyſtem, various Acts of Parha-

American ſubjects, in many inſtances, of the conſtitutional trial by jury,

and ancient prejudices to diſpoſe the inhabitants to act with hoſtility a-  
gainſt the feee Proteſtant Colories, whenever a wicked Miniftry ſhall

To obtain redreſs of theſe grievances, which threaten deſtruction to  
the lives, berty, and property of his Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjeéts in North-Ameri-  
  
non- exportation apieement, faithfully adhered to, will prove the moſt  
ſpeedy, efſectual, and peaceabie meaſure: — And therefore we do, for  
ou: ves, and the inhabitants ef the ſeveral Colonies, whom we repre-  
ſen&#x27;, firmly agree and aſſociate under the ſacred ties of virtue, honour,  
and love of our country, as fellows : 5 |  
FIRST, That from and after the firſt day of December next, we  
will not import into Britiſh America, from Great-Britain or Ireland, any  
goods, wares or merchandize whatſoever, or from any other place any  
ſuch goods, wares or merchandize, as ſhall have been exported fromGreat-  
Britain or Ireland, nor will we, after that day, import any Eaſt-India tea  
from any part of the world; nor any molaſſes, ſyrrups, paneles, coffee,  
or piemento, from the Britiſh plantations, or from Dominica; nor  
wines from Madeira, or the Weſtern-Iſlands; nor foreign Indigo.  
SECOND, That we will neither import nor purchaſe any flaves im-  
ported after 1ſt day December next, after which tire, we will wholly diſ-  
continue the ſlave trade. and will neicher be concerned in it ourfelves, nor  
will we hire our vel els, nor fell our commodities or manufactures to thoſe  
who are concerned in It, h os  
Trrnr, As a non-conſumption agreement, ftritlyladhered to, will  
ce an effectual ſecurity for the obſervation of the non- importation, we,  
as above, ſolemnly agree and aſſociate, that, fron: this day, we will not  
2urchaſe or uſe any tea imported on account of the Eaſt-India com-  
pany, or any en Which a duty hath been or ſhall be paid; and from  
and after the 1ft day of March next, we will not purchaſe or uſe any  
Eaſt-India tea whatever, nor will we, nor ſhall any perſon for or under  
as purchaie or uſe any of thoſe goods, wares, or merchandize, we have  
agreed not to import, which we ſhall ki:ow, or have cauſe to ſuſpect,  
were imported after the firſt day of December, except ſuch as come un  
der the rules and directions of the tenth article hereafter mentioned.  
Foug TH, The earneſt defire we have not to injure our fellow-ſubjafts  
in Great-Britain, Ireland, or the Weſt-Indies, induces us to ſuipend  
a non-exportation until the tenth day of September. 1775 3 at which  
time if the ſaid acts and parts of Acts of the Britiſh Parlement, herein-  
ifter mentioned, are not repealed, we will not, directly or indirectiy,  
export iny merchandize or commodity whatſoever, to Great-Pntain,Ire-  
land cr the Weil-Indies, except Rice to Europe.

Firn, Such as are merchants, and uſe the Britiſh and Iriſh  
Trade, will give orders, as ſoon as poſſible, to their factors, agents and  
correſpondents, in Great Britain and Ireland, not to ſhip any goods to  
them on any pretence whatſoever, as they cannot be received in Ame-  
rica ; and if any merchant reſiding in Gieat-Britain or Ireland, ſhall di-  
  
—  
  
ner contravene the ſame, on ſuch unworthy conduct being well atteſt-  
  
chant. 8  
| SixTH, That ſuch as are owners of veſſels will give poſitive orders,  
to their Captains, or maſters, not to receive on board their veſſels any  
  
mediate diſmiſſion from their fervice.  
  
SEVENTH. We will uſe our utmoſt endeavours to improve the  
breed of ſheep and increaſe their numbers to the greateſt extent, and  
to that end, we will kill them as ſparingly as may be, eſpecially thoſe of  
the moſt profitable kind; nor will we export any to the Weſt-Indies, or

{or can conveniently ſpare any ſheep, will diſpoſe of them to our neigh-  
bours, eſpecially to the poor fort, on moderate terms.  
EiGHTH. That we will in our ſeveral ſtations encourage frugality,  
economy, and induſtry ; and promote agriculture, arts, and the manu-  
factures of this country, eſpecially that of wool 3 and will diſcounte-

cially all horſe-racing, and all kinds of gaming, cock-fighting, exhi-  
bitions of ſhews, plays, and other expenſive diverſions and entertain-  
ments. And on the death of any relation or friend, none of us, or any  
{ of our families, will go into any further mourning dreſs, than a black  
rape or ribbon on the arm or hat for Gentlemen, and a black ribbon and  
necklace for Ladies, and we will diſcontinue the giving of gloves and  
ſcarfs at funerals. 8  
NIN TH. That ſuch as are venders of goods or merchandize, will  
not take advantage of the ſcarcity of goods that may be occaſioned by  
this aſſociatien, but will fell the ſame at the rates we have been re-  
ſpectively accuſtomed to do, for twelve months laſt paſt.— And if  
any vender of goods or merchandize, ſhall ſell any ſuch goeds on  
higher terms, or ſhall in any manner, or by any device whatſoever, vi-  
late ordepart from this agreement, no perſon ought; nor will any of  
us deal with any ſuch perſon, or his or her factor or agent, at any time  
thereafter, for any commodity « hatever. _ .

unhappy fituation of our affairs, is occa~  
fioned by a ruinous fyitem of colony ad-  
minifiration, adopted by the Britifh mi-  
niftry about the year 1763, evidently cal.  
culated for enflaving thefe colonies, and,  
with them, the Britifl empire. = In  
profecution of which fyftem, various  
aéts of ‘parliament have been paifed  
for raifing a revenue in America, for  
depriving the American fubjects in many  
inftances, of the conftitutional trial by  
jury, expofing their lives to danger, by  
directing a new and illegal trial beyond  
the feas, for crimes alledyed to have been  
committed in America: And in profecu-  
tion of the fame fy{tem, feveral late,  
cruel, and oppreffive acts have been paf-  
fed refpecting the town of Bofton and the  
Maffachufetts Bay, and alfo an act for  
exfending the province of Quebec, fo  
as to border on the weftern frontiers of  
thefe colonies, eftablifhing an arbitrary  
government therein, and difcouraging  
the fettlement of Britifh fubjects in that,  
wide extended country; thus by the in-  
fluence of civil principles and antient  
prejudices, to difpofe the inhabitants to  
act with hoftility againft the free pro-  
teftant colonies, whenever a wicked mi-  
nifter fhall chufe fo to direct them, —  
  
To obtain redrefs of thefe grievances,  
  
Affociation recommended  
  
which threaten deftruction to the lives,  
  
liberty, and property. of his majefty’s  
fubjects in North “America, we are of  
opinion, that a fon-importation, non-  
confumption, and non-exportation agrec-  
ment faithfully adhered to, will prove  
the moft fpeedy, effectual, and peacea-  
ble meafure: And ‘therefore we do, for  
ourfelves and thé” inhabitants of the fe-  
veral colonies, whom we reprefent, firm-  
ly agree and affociate under the facred  
ties of. virtue, honour, and love of our  
country, as follows :  
  
Firft, That from and after, the firft day  
ef December next, we will not import  
into Britifh América, from Great- Britain  
er Ireland, any goods, wares, or mer-  
chandize whatfoever, or from any other  
place, any fuch goods, wares or mer-  
chandize as fhall have been exported from  
Great: Britain or Ireland ; nor will we,  
after that day, import any Eaft India  
tea from any part of the world; nor any  
molaiies, fyrups, panecies, coftee, or  
pimento, from the Britifh plantations, or  
from Dominica; nor wines from Madéi-  
ra, or the weftern Iflands; nor foreign  
indigo.  
  
Second, That we will neither import,  
hor purchafe any flave imported, after  
the ift day of December next; after  
  
by the Continental Congrefs. 27  
  
which time, we will wholly difcontinue  
the flave trade, and will neither be con-  
cerned in it ourfelyes, nor will we hire  
our veifels, nor fell our commodities or  
manufactures to thofe who are concerned  
in it,  
  
Third, As a non-confumption agree~  
ment, -firictly adhered to, will be an ef-  
fectual fecurity for the obfervation of the  
non-importation, we, as above, folemn-  
ly agree and affociate, that from this  
day, we will not purchafe or ufe any  
tea imported on account of the Eaft In-  
dia Company, or any on which a duty  
hath been or fhall be paid; and from  
and after the 1ft day of March next, we  
will not purchafe or ufe any Eatt India  
tea whatever; nor will we, nor fhall  
any perfon for or under us, purchafe or  
ufe any of thofe goods, wares, or mer-  
chandize, we have agreed not to import,  
which we fhall know, or have caufe to  
fufpect, were imported after the ft day  
of December, except fuch as come under  
the rules and directions of the tenth ar-  
ticle hereafter mentioned.  
  
Fourth, The earneft defire we have,  
not to injure our fellow fubjects in Great  
Britain, Ireland, or the Weit Indies, in-  
duces us to fufpend a non exportation, un=  
til the roth day of September 1775; at’  
which time, if the faid a&amp;s and parts of  
asts of the Britifh parliament herein af-  
ter mentioned are not repealed, we will  
not directly or .indireétly, export any  
merchandize or commodity whatfoever to ,  
Great Britain, Ireland, or the Weft In-  
dies, except rice to Europe. :  
  
Fifth, Such as are merchants, and ufe  
the Britifh and Irifh trade, will give ora.  
ders, as foon as poffible to their factors,  
agents, and correfpondents, in Great  
Britain and Ireland, not to fhip any  
goods to them, on any pretence whatfo-  
ever, as they cannot be received in Ame-  
rica; and if any merchant, refding. in  
Great- Britain or Ireland, fhall dire&amp;-_  
ly or indirectly fhip any goods, wares,.  
or merchandize, for America, . in-  
order to break the faid non-importa-.,  
tion agreement, or in any manner con-  
travene thee fame, on fuch unworthy  
conduct being well attetted, it ought to  
  
e made publick; and, on the fame be-  
ing {fo done, we will not thenceforth have  
  
any commercial connexion with fuch mer-  
  
chant.  
  
Sixth,That fuch as are owners of veffels  
will give pofitive orders to their Captains,  
or Mafters, not to receive on board their  
veflels avy goods prohibited by the faid

Ninth, That fuch as are venders of

Tenth, In cafe any merchant, trader,  
or other perfons. fhall import any goods

December, and before the firft day of  
February next, the fame ought forewith  
at the election of the owner, either to

To obtain a redress of these grievances, which  
threaten destruction to the lives, liberty and pro-  
perty of his majesty’s subjects, in North America,  
we are of Gpinion, that a non-importation, non-con-  
sumption, and non-exportation agreement, faith-  
fully adhered to, will prove the most speedy, ef-  
fectual and peaceable measure: And, therefore,  
we do, for ourselves and the inhabitants of the se-  
veral colonies, whom we represent, firmly agree  
and associate, under the sacred ties of virtue, honor  
and love of our country, as follows:  
  
First, That, from and after the first day of Dec.  
next, we will not import, into British America, from  
Great Britain or Ireland, any goods, wares or mer-  
chandise whatsoever, or from any other place, any  
such goods, wares or merchandise, as shall have  
been exported from Great Britain or Ireland; nor  
will we, after that day, import any East India tea  
fromany part of the world; nor any molasses, syrups,  
paneles, coffee, or pimento, from the British plan-  
tations, or from Dominica; hor wines from Madeira,  
or the Western Islands; nor foreign indigo.  
  
  
  
Second, We will neither import nor purchase,  
any slave imported after the first day of Dec. next;  
after which time, we will wholly discontinue the  
slave trade, and will neither be concerned in it our-  
selves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our  
commodities or manufactures to those who are con-  
eerned in it.  
  
Third, As a non-conswmption agreement, strictly  
adhered to, will be an effectual security for the ob-  
servation of the non-importation, we, as above, so

have inserted in this sheet the non-importation  
agreement of the old congress in 1774—a venerable  
  
Europe.  
  
Fifth, Such as are merchants, and use the British  
and Irish trade, will give ordets, as soon as possible,  
to their factors, agenis and correspondents, in Great  
Britain and Ireland, not to ship any goods to. them,  
on any pretence whatsoever, as they cannot be re-  
ceived in America; and if any merchant, residing  
in Great Britain or-lreland, shall, directly or imdi-  
rectly, ship any goods, wares or merchandise, for  
America, in order to brenk the said non-importation  
agreement, or ip any manner contravene the Same,  
on such unworthy conduct being well attested, it  
ought to be made public; and, on the same being  
so done, we will not, from thenceforth, have any  
commercial connexion with such merchant,  
  
Sixth, That such as are owners of vessels, will  
give positive erders to theircaptains, or masters, not  
to receive on board their vessels any goods prohi-  
bited by the said non-importation agreement, on  
pain of immediate dismission from their service.  
Seventh, We will use our utmost endeavors to  
improve the breed of sheep, and increase their num-  
ber to the greatest extent; and, to that end, we will  
kill them as seldom as may be, especially those of  
the most profitable kind; nor will we export any to  
the West Indies orelsewhere; and those of us who  
are, of may become, overstecked with, or can con-  
veniently spare any sheep, will dispose of them to  
our neighbors, especially to the poorer sort, on  
moderate terms.  
  
Eighth, We ‘will, in our several stations, encous  
rage frugality, economy and industry, and promote  
the agriculture, arts and manufactures of this coun-&#x27;  
try, especially that of wool; and will discountenance  
and discourage every species of extravagance and  
dissipation, especially all horse-racing, and all kinds  
of gaming, cock -fighting, exhibitions of shews, plays  
and other expensive diversions and entertainments  
—and on the death of any relation or friend, none  
of us, or any of our families, will go into any fur-  
ther mourning dress, than a black crape or ribbon  
on the arm or lat, for gentlemen, and a black rib-  
ben and necklace for ladies; and we will discontinue  
the giving of gloves and scarves at funerals.

accustomed to do, for twelve months last past. And  
if any vender of goods or merchandise shall sell any  
  
or by any device whatsoever, violate or depart from  
this agreement, no person ought, nor will any of  
us deal with any such person, or his or her factor  
or agent, at any time thereafter, for any commodity  
whatever.  
  
‘Yenth, In case any merchant, trader, or other  
person, shall import any goods or merchandise, af-  
ter the first day of December, and before tie tirs}  
day of February next, the same ought, forthwith,  
at the election of the owner, to be either re-shipped  
or delivered up to the committee «f the county or  
town, wherein they shall be imported, to be stored  
at the risk of the importer, until the non-importa-  
tion agreement shall cease, or be sold under the  
direction of the committee aforésaid; and in the  
last mentioned case, the owner or owners of-such  
goods shall be reimbursed out of the sales, the first  
cost and charges; the profit, if any, to be applied  
towards relieving and employing such poor inhabi-  
tants of the town of Boston, as are immediate suf-  
ferers by the Boston port-bill; and a particular ac-  
count of all goods, so returned, stored or soid, to be  
inserted in the public papers; and if any goods or  
merchandise shall be imported after the said first  
day of Feb. the same ought, forthwith, to be sent  
back again, without breaking any of the packages  
thereof.  
  
Eleventh, That a committee be chosen in everv  
county, city, and town, by those who are qualified  
to vote for representatives in the legislature, whose  
business it shall be attentively to observe the con-  
duct of all persons touching this association; and  
when it shall be made to appear, to the satisfaction  
of amajority of any such committee, that any per-  
son within the limits of their appointment has vio-  
lated this association, that such majority do forth-  
with cause the truth of the case to be published in  
the gazette; to the end that all such foes to the  
rights of British America may be publicly known,  
and universally contemned as the enemies of Ame-  
rican liberty; andthenceforth we, respectively, will  
break off all dealings with him or her. ,  
  
Tweltth, That the committee of correspondence  
in the respective colonies, do frequently inspect  
the entries of their custom-houses, and inform each  
other, from time to time, of the true state thereof,  
and of every material circumstance that may occur  
relative to this association.  
  
Thirteenth, That all the manufactures of this  
country be sold at reasonable prices, so that no un-  
due advantage be taken of a future scarcity of  
goods. :  
  
Fourteenth, And we do further agree and re-  
solve, that we will have no trade, commerce, deal-  
ings or intercourse whatsoever, with any colony or  
province in North America, which shall not accede  
to, or which shal! hereafter violate this association,  
but will hold them unworthy of the rights of free-  
men, and as inimical to the liberties of their coun-  
try.  
  
ae we do solemnly bind ourselves and our con-  
stituents, under the ties aforesaid, to adhere to this  
association, until such parts of the several acts of  
parliament, passed since the close of the last war,  
as impose or continue duties on tea, wine, molasses,  
syrups, paneles, coffee, sugar, pimento, indigo, fo-  
reign paper, glass, and painter’s colors, imported  
into America, and extend the powers of the admi-  
  
ralty courts beyond their ancient limits; deprive}.  
  
the American subject of trial by jury; authorise  
  
from damages, that he might otherwise be liable to  
  
from atrial by his peers; require oppressive secu-  
  
rity from a claimant of ships or goods seized, be-  
  
fore he shall be allowed to defend his property, are  
  
repealed. And until that part of the act of the  
  
12 G. 3, ch. 24, entitled «an act for the better se-  
  
curing his majesty’s dock-yards, magazines, ships,  
ammunition, and. stores,” by which any persons  
charged with committing any of the offences there-  
in described, in America, may be tried in any shire,  
er county, within the realm, is repealed; and until  
the four acts,passed at the last session of parliament,  
viz. that for stopping the port and blocking up the  
harbor of Boston; that for altering the charter and  
government of the Massachusetts-bay; and that.  
which is entitled «an act for the better administra-  
tion of justice, &amp;c.” and that “for extending the  
limits of Quebec, &amp;c.” are repealed. And we re-  
commend to the provincial conventions, and to the  
committeesin the respective colonies, to establish  
such farther regulations as they may think proper  
for carrying into execution this association.  
  
The foregoing association being determined up-  
on by the Congress, was ordered to be subscribed  
-by the several members thereof; and, thereupon,  
have hereunto set our respective names accord-  
ingly.  
  
In Congress, Philadelphia, October 24, 1774.

ed at the table, and is as follows:  
We, his Majesty&#x27;s most loyal subjects, the delega­  
tes of the several Colonies of New-Hamps ire, Mas­  
sachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New­  
York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvanin, the three Lowor,  
Counties of New-Castle, Kent, and Sussex, on Dela­  
ware, Matyland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South  
Carolina, deputed to represent them in a Continental  
Congress, held in the City of Philadelphia, on the  
fifth day of September, 1774, avowing our allegiance  
to his Majestyt our affection and regard fof our fel­  
low subjects in Great Britian and elsewheret affect­  
ed with the deepest anxiety and most alarning ap­  
prehensions at those grievances and distresses with  
which his Majesty&#x27;s American subjects are oppress­  
ed; and having taken under our most serious delib­  
eration the state of the whole Continent, find that  
the present unhappy situation of our affairs is occa­  
sioned by a ruinous system of Colony Administra­  
tion adopted by the British Ministry about the year  
1763, evidently calculated for enslaving these Col­  
onies, and, with them, the British Empire. In pro­  
secution of which system various Acts of Parliament  
have been passed for raising a revenue in America,  
for depriving the America subjects, in many instan­  
ces, of the Constitutional trial by jury, exposin their  
lives to danger by directing a new and illegal trial  
beyond the seas for crimes alleged to have been  
committed in America; and in prosecution of the  
same system several late, cruel, and oppressive Acts  
have been passed respecting the town of Boston and  
the Masachusetts Bay,and als an Act for extending  
the Province of Quebec, so as to border on the Wes  
tern stontiers of these Colonies, establishing an arbi  
trary Government therein, and discouraging the set­  
tlement of British subjects in that wide extended  
country; thus, by the influence of civil principles  
and ansient prejudices, to dispose the inhabitant to  
act with hostility against the free Protestant Colon  
ies whenever a wicked ministry shall choose so to  
direct them.  
To obtamn redress for theso grievances, which  
threaten destruction to the lives, liberty, and proper­  
ty of his Majesty&#x27;s subjects in North America, we  
are of opinion that a non-importation, non consumpe  
tion, and non exportation agreement, faithfully ad­  
hered to, will prove the most speedy, effectual, and  
peacable measure; and, therefore, we do, for our­  
selves, and the inhabitants of the several Colonies  
whom we respresent, firmly agree and associate, un­  
der the sacred ties of virtue, honor and love of our  
country, as follows:  
I That from and after the first day of December  
next, we will not import into British America, from  
Great Britain or I eland, any goods, wares, or mer­  
chandise whatsoever, or from any other place, any  
such goods, wares, or merchandises as shall have  
been exported from Great Britian or Ireland; nor  
will we, after that day, import any East India tea  
from any part of the world; nor any Molasses, syr­  
ups, paneless coffee, or pimento, from the Reitish  
  
plantations or from Dominicat nor wines from Ma­  
deara of the Western Islands; nor foreign Indigo.  
That we will neither import nor purchase any  
slaves imported after the first day of Decemab er next  
after which time we will wholly discontinue the  
slave trade, and will neither Le concerned in it our­  
selves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our  
commodities or manufactures to those who are con­  
cerned in it:  
3As a non-consumption agreement, strictly ad  
hered to, will be an effectual security for the obser­  
vation of the non-importation, we, as ubove, solemn­  
ly agree and associate, that from this day we will  
not purchase or use any tea imported on account of  
the East India Company, or any on which a duty  
hath been or shall be paid; and from and after the  
first day of March next wo will not purchase or use  
any East India tea whatsoever; nor will we, nor,  
shall any person for or under us, purchase or use any  
of those goods, wares, or merchandises we have  
agreed not to import, which we shall know, or have  
cause to suspect, were imported after the first day of  
December, except such as come under the rules  
and directions of the tenth Articles hereafter men­  
tioned.  
4 The earnest desire we have not to injure our  
fellow subjecis in Great Britain, Ireland or the West  
Indies, induces us to spend a non-exportation until  
the tenth day of September, 1775; at which time, it  
the said Acts and parts of Acts of the British Parlia­  
mont herein after mentioned, are not repealed, we  
will not, directly or indirectly, export any merchan­  
dise or commodity whatsoever to Great Britain, Ire­  
land, or the West Indies, except rice to Enrope.  
5 Such as are merchants, and use the British and  
Irish trade, will give orders as soon as possible to  
their factors, agents and correspondents, in Great  
Britain and Ireland, not to to ship any goods to them  
on any pretence whatsoover, as they cannot be re­  
ceived in America; and if any merchant residing in  
Great Britain or Ireland, shall directly or indirectly  
ship any goods, wares, or merchandise for America  
in order to break the said non-importation agree­  
ment or in any manner contravene the same, on such  
unworthy conduct being woll attested, it ought to be  
made public, and on the same being so done, we  
will not from thenceforth have any commercial con­  
nection with such merchant.  
6 That such as are owners of vessels will give  
pos&#x27;tive orders to their captains, or masters, not to  
receive on board their vessels any goods prohibited  
by the said non-importation agreement, on pain of  
immediate dismission from their service.  
We will use our utmost endeavors to improve  
the breed of sheep, and increase their number to the  
greatest extent; and to that end we will kill them as  
sparingly as may be, especially those of the most  
profitable kind; nor will we export any to the West  
Indies or elewhere, and those of us who are or may  
become overstocked with, or can conveniently spare  
any sheep, will dispose of them to our neighbors,  
especially to the poorer sorts, upon moderate terms.  
8 That we will, in our several stations, encourage  
frugality, economy, and industry and aromote aari,  
  
culture, arts, and the manufactures of this country,  
espectally that of wool, and will discountenance and  
discourage every species of extravagance and dissi­  
pation, especially all horse-racing, and all kinds of  
gaming, cock-fighting exhibitions of plays, shews, and  
other expensive diversions and enteriainments; and  
on the death of any relation or friends, none of us,  
or any of our families will go into any further mourn­  
ing-dress than a black crape or ribbon on the arm  
or hat for gentlemen, and a black ribbon and neck­  
lace for ladies, and we will discontinue the giving  
of gloves and scarss at funerals.  
9 That such as are venders of goods or merch an­  
dises will not take advantage of the scarcity of goods  
that may be occasioned by this Association, but will  
sell the same at the rates we have been respective­  
ly accustomed to do for twelve months last past.  
And if any vender of goods or merchandises shall  
sell any such goods on higher terms, or shall, in any  
manner, or by any device whatsoever, violate or de­  
part from this agreement, no person ought, nor will  
any of us deal with any such person, his or her fac­  
tor or agent, at any time the reafter for any commo­  
dity whatever.  
10 In case any merchant, trader, or any other  
person, shall import any goods or merchandizes after  
the first day of December and before the first day  
of February next, the same ought forthwith, at the  
election of the owner, to be either reshipped, or de­  
livered up to the committee of the county or tows  
where in they shall be imported, to be stored at the  
risk of the importer, until the non-importation agree­  
ment shall cease, or be sold under the direction of  
the committee aforesaid; and in the last mentioned  
case the ownef or ownors of such goods shall be  
reimbursed out of the sales of the first cost and  
harges; the profit, if any, to be applied towards re­  
lieving and employing such poor mhabitants of the  
lown of Bosion as are immediate sufferers, by the  
Boston Fort Bill; and a particular account of all goods  
so returned, stored or sold, to be inserted in the pub­  
lic papers; and if any goods or merchandizes shall be  
imported after the said first day of Februnry, the  
same ought forthwith to be sont back again, without  
breaking any of the packages thereof.  
11 That a committee be choson in every county,  
city, and town, by those who are qualified to vole  
for Representatives in the Legislature, whose busi­  
ness it shall be attentively to observe the conduct  
of all persons touching this Association; and when it  
shall be fomde to appear to the satisfaction of a ma­  
jority of such committee, that any person within the  
limits of their appointment has vilated this Associ­  
tion, that such arajority do forthwith cause the truth  
of the case to be published in the Gazette, to the  
end that all such foes to the rights of British Ameri­  
ca may te publicly known, and universally contem­  
ned as the enemfes of American Liberty; and thence­  
forth we respectively will break off all dealings  
with him or her.  
12 That the committee of correspondence, in the  
respective Colonies, do frequently inspect the en­  
  
ries of their Custom Houses, and inform each other,  
rom time to time, of the true state thereof, and of  
every other material circuinstance that may occur  
elative to this Association  
13 That all manufactures of this country be sold  
at reasonable prices, so that no undue advantage be  
aken of a future scarcity of goods.  
14 And we do further agree and resolve that we  
will have no trade, commerce, dealings, or inter  
course whatsoever with any Colony or Province in  
North America, which shall not accede to or which  
shall hereafter violate this Association, but will hold  
them as unworthy of the rights of freemen, and as  
inimical to the liberties of this country,  
And we lo solemnly bind ourselves and our con­  
stituents, under the ties aforesaid, to adhere to this  
Association until such parts of the several Acts of  
Parliament passed since the close of the last war,  
as impose or continue duties on tea, wine, molasses,  
syrups, candles, coffee, sugar, pimento, indigo,  
foreign paper, glass, and painters&#x27; colors, imported  
into America, and extend the powers of the Ad­  
miralty Courts beyond their ancdtent limits, deprive  
the American subjects of a trial by jury, authorize  
the Judges certificate to indemnify the prosecutor  
from damages that he might otherwise be liable to  
from a trial by his peers, require oppressive security  
from a claimant of ships or goods seized, before he  
shall be allowed to defend his property, are repeal­  
ed. And until that part of the Act of the 12th  
George III. ch. 24, entitled &quot;An Act for the better  
securing his Majesty&#x27;s dock yards, magazines, ships,  
ammunition, and stores,&quot; by which any persons  
charged with committing any of the offences there  
in described, in America, may be tried in any shire  
or county within the Realm, is repealed--and un­  
til the four Acts passed in the last session of Parlia­  
ment, viz that for stopping the port and blocking  
up the harbor of Boston--that for altering the char­  
ter and government of the Massachusetts Bay; and  
that which is entitle An Act for the better admin­  
istration of justice, &amp;c.--and that for extending the  
limits of Quebec, &amp;c., are repealed. And we re­  
commend it to the Provincial Conventions, and to  
the committees in the respective Colonies to estab­  
lish such farther regulations as they may think pro­  
per for carrying into execution this Association  
The foregoing Association being determined up­  
on by the Congress, was ordered to be subscrib­  
ed by the several members thereof; and thereupon,  
we have hereinto setour respective names accord­  
ingly.

We, his Majesty&#x27;s most loyal subjects,  
delegates of the several colonies of New  
Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode  
Island, Connecticut, New York, New­  
Jersey, Pennsylvania, the three lower  
Counties of Neweastle, Kent and Sussex,  
on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North  
Carolina, and South Carolina, deputed to  
represent them in a Continental Con­  
gress, held in the city of Philadelphia,  
on the fifth day of September,  
1774, avowing our allegiance to  
his Majesty, our affection and  
regard for our fellow subjects in  
Great Britain and elsewhere, affected  
with the deepest anxiety and most  
alarming apprenensions at those gricr  
and distresses with which His Ma  
  
jesty&#x27;s American subjects are oppressed,  
  
and having taken under our most serious  
deliberatien the State of the whole con­  
tinent, find that the present un  
happy situation of our affairs is occa-  
  
sioned by a ruinous system of colony  
administration adopted by the British  
Ministry about the year 1763, evidently  
calculated for inslaving these colonies,  
and with them the British Empire. In  
prosecution of which system various  
acts of Parliament have been passed  
for raising a Revenue in America,  
for depriving the American subjects, in  
many instances, of the Constitutional  
trial by jury, exposing their lives to dan  
ger, by directing a new and illegal trial  
beyond the seas, for crimes alieged to  
have been committed in America: And  
in prosecution of the same system, sev­  
eral late, cruel, and oppressive acts have  
been passed respecting the town of Bos  
ton and the Massachusetts Bzes, and also  
an Act for extending the province of  
Quebec, so as to border on the western  
frontiers of these Colonies, establishing  
an arbitrary government therein, and  
discouraging the settlement of British  
subiects in that wide extended country;  
  
by the infinence of civil principles  
  
and ancient prejudices to dispose the in  
  
habitants to act with hostility against  
the free protestant colonies, whenever a  
wicked Ministry shall choose so to direct  
them.  
To obtain redress of these grievances,  
which threaten destruction to the lives,  
liberty and property of his majesty&#x27;s  
subjećts in North America, we are of  
opinion that a non-importation, non­  
consumption and non-exportation agree

Englanders, ‘ being the traders of the New World, early took part  
in the carrying slave trade, and furnished slaves to the other colonies.’  
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut were all engaged in the  
trade, Newport, in Rhode Island, being the greatest slave mart; and the  
negroes, brought in from Africa, were sent partly to the southern states,  
partly to the West Indies, where the cargoes were exchanged for  
molasses to supply the New England rum distilleries.  
  
In October 1774, on the eve of the outbreak of the War of Inde-  
pendence, the first continental congress of the states resolved that ‘we  
will neither import nor purchase any slave imported after the first day of  
December next.’ The resolution was part of a general non-importation  
agreement directed against Great Britain, and it met with universal  
acceptance except in the state of Georgia. Its acceptance was due, as Mr.
