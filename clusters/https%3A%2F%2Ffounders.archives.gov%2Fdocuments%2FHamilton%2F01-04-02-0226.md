le of the State of New-York.  
THE President of the United States is to be “Commander in Chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United States.” The propriety of this provision is so evident in itself; and it is at the same time so consonant to the precedents of the State constitutions in general, that little need be said to explain or enforce it. Even those of them, which have in other respects coupled the Chief Magistrate with a Council, have for the most part concentrated the military authority in him alone. Of all the cares or concerns of government, the direction of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single hand. The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of directing and employing the common strength, forms an usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.  
“The President may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices.” This I consider as a mere redundancy in the plan; as the right for which it provides would result of itself from the office.  
He is also to be authorised “to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States except in cases of impeachment.” Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate, that the benign prerogative for pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed. The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the sense of responsibility is always strongest in proportion as it is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives, which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield to considerations, which were calculated to sh

each other in an act of obduracy, and might be less sensible to the apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected clemency. On these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of the government than a body of men.  
The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the President has, if I mistake not, been only contested in relation to the crime of treason. This, it has been urged, ought to have depended upon the assent of one or both of the branches of the legislative body. I shall not deny that there are strong reasons to be assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that body or of a part of it. As treason is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the society, when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the offender, there seems a fitness in refering the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the Legislature. And this ought the rather to be the case, as the supposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate ought not to be entirely excluded. But there are also strong objections to such a plan. It is not to be doubted that a single man of prudence and good sense, is better fitted, in delicate conjunctures, to balance the motives, which may plead for and against the remission of the punishment, than any numerous body whatever. It deserves particular attention, that treason will often be connected with seditions, which embrace a large proportion of the community; as lately happened in Massachusetts. In every such case, we might expect to see the representation of the people tainted with the same spirit, which had given birth to the offense. And when parties were pretty equally matched, the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the condemned person, availing itself of the good nature and weakness of others, might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an example was necessary. On the other hand, when the sedition had proceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the major party, they might often be found obstinate and inexorable, when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency. But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case in the Chief Magistrate is this—In seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there are often critical moments, when a well timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may never be possible afterwards to recall. The dilatory process of convening the Legislature, or one of its branches, for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the measure, would frequently be the occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity. The loss of a week, a day, an hour, may sometimes be fatal. If it should be observed that a discretionary power with a view to such contingencies might be occasionally conferred upon the President; it may be answered in the first place, that it is questionable whether, in a limited constitution, that power could be delegated by law; and in the second place, that it would generally be impolitic before-hand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of impunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the usual course, would be likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or of weakness, and would have a tendency to embolden guilt.

&quot; The command and application of the public force, to ei

The oxpcdioaey of vesting the pewer of  
pardoning in the President has, if I mis­  
take not, been only ooiltosted in relation  
to the crime of treason. This, it has been  
urged, ought to have depended upon the  
assent of one. or both of the branches of  
the Legislative body. I shall not deny  
that there are strong reasons to be assigned  
fer requiring in this particnlar the concur­  
rence of that body, or of a part of it. As  
treason is a crime lcvolcd at the immediate  
&quot;being of the society, when the laws have  
once ascertained the guilt of the offender,  
there seems a fitness in referring the expe­  
diency of an act of mercy towards him to  
the judgment of the Legislature. And this  
oaght the rather to he tho case, as tho sup  
position or the connivance of the Chief  
Magistrate ought, not to Be entirely ex­  
cluded. Bat there are also utrong objec­  
tions to such a plan. It is not to be  
doubted, that a single man of prudence  
andgoodiMsneis better fitted, in. delicate  
conjunctures to balance the motives which &#x27;  
may plead for and against the remission of  
the punishment, than any numerous body  
whatever. It deserves particular attention,  
&#x27;&quot;&quot;IyY&quot;1 be connected with  
seditions which embrace a large proportion  
of tbe community; as lately happened in  
Massachusetts; In every mdh raM ,,--&#x27;

which had given birth to the offense. Aud

the secret sympathy of tho friends andfa­  
vorors of the condemnedv&amp;Hing itself of  
the good natufe and weaknras of others,  
might frequently beslowimpunity where  
the terror of an example was necessary.  
  
X)n the other hand, when the sedition had  
proceeded from causes winch liau innarneu  
the resentments of the major party, they  
might often be found obstinate and inexo­

peachment. Humanity and good,poliey   
conspire to dictate that the benign power   
of pardoning should be as little as possi­  
ble fettered or embarrassed. The amnia&quot;   
at code of• every country partakes so   
much of necessary severity, that without   
an easy access to exceptions in favor of   
unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a   
countenance too sanguinary and cruel.—  
The expediency of vesting the pardoning   
power in the President has, if I mistake   
not, been only. contested in relation to,tbe   
crime of treason. This, it has been urged,   
ought to have depended upon the assent   
of one or both the branches of the legisla­  
tive body I shall not deny that there   
are strong reasonate be assigned for re-,   
quiring, in this particular, the concur­  
rence of that body, or a part of it. Rut   
it is not to be doubted that a single man   
of prudence and good sense is better fit­  
ted, in delicate conjunctions, to balance&#x27;   
the motives which may plead for and   
against the remission of the punishment,   
than any numerous body whatever..   
It deserves particular&#x27; attention that   
treason will often be connected with sew   
ditionl   
&#x27;Which embrace a large proportion   
of the ommunity, as lately _happened in   
Massa husetts. In every such case, we   
might expect to see the representation of   
the people tainted with the same spirit   
which had given birth to the offence ; and   
when parties were pretty equally poised,   
the secret sympathy of the friends and fa­  
vorers of the condemned, availing itself   
of the good nature and &#x27;weakness -of oth­  
ers, might frequently bestow impunity,   
when the terror of an example Was neo,   
essary. .&gt;.   
  
On the other hand, when the sedition   
had proceeded from causes which had in­  
flamed the resentments of the major par­  
ty, they might often be found obstinate   
and inexorable, - when policy demanded   
forbearance and clemency. But the prin­  
cipal argument for reposing the power of   
pardoning in this case in the chief magis­  
.trate, is this: In seasons of insurrection   
or rebellion, there are often critical Mo­  
ments, when a well timed offer of pardon.   
to the insurgents, or rebels, may restore   
the tranquility of the commonwealth, and   
which, if suffersd to pass unimproved, it   
may never be possible afterwards to re,   
call. The dilatory process-of convening   
the Legislature, or one of its branches,for   
ting slip the gOlden opportunity. The   
loss of a week, a day, or au hour, may   
sometimes be fatal. If it should be ob­  
served thit a discretionary power,*ith a   
view to such contingencies, might be oc­  
casionally conferred upon the Presi&#x27;d&#x27;ent-;   
it may be answered in the first plate that   
it is questionable whether, in a limited   
Constitution, that power could be delega­  
ted by law ; and in the second place that   
it would generally be impolitic befoF6   
baud to take any step which might bold   
out the prospect of impunity. A proceed­  
ing adds kind, out of the canal course,   
would be likely to be construed into au   
argumen t of timidity or of weakness, and   
would have a tendency to embolden   
guilt.&quot; •

&quot; The expediency of vesting the power

mistake not, been only contested in re­  
lation to the crime of treason. This, it  
bag been utged, ongbt to have depended

that there are strong reasons to be  
assigned for requiring, in this particular,  
the concurrence of that body, or of a  
part of lu As treason is a crime leveled  
at the immediate being of tbe society,  
when the laws have once ascertained  
the guilt of tbe offender there seems  
a fitness in reterring me expeaiecj  
of an set of mercy toward him to the judg­

the rather to be tbe case, as tbe supposi­  
tion of tbe connivance of the Chief Mag­  
istrate ought not to be entirely excluded.  
But there are also strong objections to  
such a plan. It is not to be doubted that  
a single man of prudence and good sense  
is better fitted in delioatecorjunctures to  
balance tbe motives which may plead for  
and agaiost tbe remission of the punish­

offense, And when parties were pretty  
equally poised, tbe secret sympathy of

pect to see tho representation of the peo­

had given birth to tho offense. And when

&quot; &#x27;flic expediency ol vesting the pow  
er of pardoning iu the Picsident has, if I  
mistake not, been only contested in rela­  
tion to the ctime of treat&#x27; n. This, it  
has been urged, ought U have depended  
upon the assent of one or both of the  
breaches i the legi-dativc body. 1 shall  
not deny that there arc strong reasons t  
bj assigned for rcqmring in this parlieular  
the uccurreace of that body or a part of  
it. As treason is a crime leveled at the  
BMaaoaata tieiug of the society, when the  
aws have oacc ascertained the guilt of  
the offender, there seems a fitness in re-  
fesasuV, the expediency of an act of mercy  
toward bin to tne jivierwnt ol the i-egis  
stave. And ihis ought Use rather tr ha  
the case, a the supposition ol Ihccoa-  
nr?aacd ol the Chief Magiatra&#x27;e ought  
not to be entirely excluded. Rut lucre  
arc also Strong objections to such a plan.  
It is not lo be doubud that a single man  
ol prudence aud goed sense is better fit­  
ted, iu del Kale conjunctures, lo balance  
the motives which may p!cad U r and  
against the remission of ihe punishment  
luau any numerous body whatever. 1  
d.snvcs partxular attention that treason  
will oftcu te connected with tedttiun ,  
which embrace a large proportioa ol ihe  
uawauiai v, ts lately happened in Hasea  
hVSHtS.  
&#x27; &#x27;In every tuch ease wc might expect  
to see the f presentation of the people  
tainted With the same spirit which had  
givm birth to the offense. Aud wheu  
parlies were prclly equally passed Ihe se­  
nd sympathy of the friends and favor­  
ers of the condemned, availing itself of  
ti,e BaM nature and weakness of others,  
might frequently bestow impunity where  
the terror of an t xample was necessary.  
Ou the other hand, w hen the sedition had  
proceeded from causes which had in­  
11. lined the reasBtaaeati of the major par­  
ly, they might often be found obstinate  
au 1 inexorable when policy demanded a  
conduct of forbearance and clemency.  
&#x27; &#x27;Bat the price p 1 argument for re­  
posing the power of pardoning iu this  
case in the Chief Magistrate is this: in  
seasons of insurrection or reliellion there  
are often critical moments when a well-  
  
timed offer of pardon to the insurgents  
  
or Rebels may restore the tranquillity of  
the Commonwealth, and which, if suffer­  
ed to pass unimproved, it may never be  
possible afterward to recall. The dilatory  
process of convening the Legislature, or  
one of its branches, for the purpose of  
obtaining its sanction, would frequently  
be the occasion of letting slip the golden  
opportunity. The loss of a week, a day,  
an horn, may sometimes be fatal. If it  
should be observed that a discretionary  
power, with a view to such contingen­  
cies, might be occasionally conferred up­  
on the President, it may be answered in  
the first place tba&#x27; it is questionable  
whether, in a limited constitution, that  
power could be delegated by law, and in  
the second place that it would generally  
be impossible beforehand to take any  
step which might hold out the prospect  
of impunity. A proceeding of this kind,  
out of the usual course, would be likely  
to be construed into an argument of  
timidity or of weakness, and would have  
a tendency to embolden guilt.

It is plain that the actual command in the  
Army, while in theory exercised by the Pres-  
ident, must in fact be vested either in the  
Secretary of War or in the General-in-Chief  
as the delegated agent of the President, or  
more properly as his chief of staff. A divi-  
sion of command between them ‘is as impos-  
sible as it is for the President to divest him-  
self wholly of command. Alexander Hamil-  
ton says, “ Federalist,” LX XIV, “ Of all the  
cares or concerns of government the direc-  
tion of war most peculiarly demands those  
qualities which distinguish the exercise of  
power by a single hand. The direction of  
war implies the direction of the common  
strength; and the power of directing and em-  
  
457  
ploying the common strength forms a usual  
and essential part in the definition of execu-  
tive authority.” A notable and instructive  
illustration of the truth of the principle here  
so clearly stated by Hamilton occurred in  
the last year of the Civil War. After three  
years of divided responsibility and varying  
policies in the management of the war, Lieu-  
tenant-General Grant was by resolution of  
Congress and the appointment of the Presi-  
aent given the actual command of all the  
armies of the United States. The result em
