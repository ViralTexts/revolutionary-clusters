 or to fall themselves by their hands.’ This was the most afflicting to our prisoners of all the cruelties exercised on them. The others affected the body only, but this the mind. They were haunted by the horror of having perhaps themselves shot the ball by which a father or a brother fell. Some of them had constancy enough to hold out against half allowance of food and repeated whippings. These were generally sent to England and from thence to the East Indies. One of these escaped from the East Indies and got back to Paris, where he gave an account of his sufferings to Mr. Adams who happened to be then at Paris.  
M. de Meusnier, where he mentions that the slave-law has been passed in Virginia, without the clause of emancipation, is pleased  to mention that neither Mr. Wythe nor Mr. Jefferson were present to make the proposition they had meditated; from which people, who do not give themselves the trouble to reflect or enquire, might conclude hastily that their absence was the cause why the proposition was not made; and of course that there were not in the assembly persons of virtue and firmness enough to propose the clause for emancipation. This supposition would not be true. There were persons there who wanted neither the virtue to propose, nor talents to enforce the proposition had they seen that the disposition of the legislature was ripe for it. These worthy characters would feel themselves wounded, degraded, and discouraged by this idea. Mr. Jefferson would therefore be obliged to M. de Meusnier to mention it in some such manner as this. ‘Of the two commissioners who had concerted the amendatory clause for the gradual emancipation of slaves Mr. Wythe could not be present as being a member of the judiciary department, and Mr. Jefferson was absent on the legation to France. But there wanted not in that assembly men of virtue enough to propose, and talents to vindicate this clause. But they saw that the moment of doing it with success was not yet arrived, and that an unsuccesful effort, as too often happens, would only rivet still closer the chains of bondage, and retard the moment of delivery to this oppressed description of men. What a stupendous, what an incomprehensible machine is man! Who can endure toil, famine, stripes, imprisonment or death itself in vindication of his own liberty, and the next moment be deaf to all those motives whose power supported him thro’ his trial, and inflict on his fellow men a bondage, one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose. But we must await with patience the workings of an overruling providence, and hope that that is preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren. When the measure of their tears shall be full, when their groans shall have involved heaven itself in darkness, doubtless a god of justice will awaken to their distress, and by diffusing light and liberality among their oppressors, or at length by his exterminating thunder, manifest his attention to the things of this world, and that they are not left to the guidance of a blind fatality

And so the resolution failed to become a law.  
Mr. Jefferson was Minister to France at the time,  
and on hearing the news of the failure of his ef-  
forts to free the poor negro, he wrote thus:  
  
‘What a stupendous, what an incomprehensi-  
bie machine is man! who can endure toil, famine,  
stripes, imprisonments, and death itself, in vindi-  
cation of ns own hberty, and the next moment,  
be deaf to al! those motives whose power supported  
him through his trial, and inflict un his fellow-men  
a bondage, ove hour of which is fraught with  
more misery, than ages of that which he rose to  
oppose! But we must await, with patience, the  
workings of an overruling Providence, and hope  
that that is preparing the deliverance of these our  
suffering brethren. When the measure of their  
tears shall be full, when tiwir groans shall have  
involved .heaven itself in darkness, doubtless a  
God of justice will awaken to their distress, and  
by diffusing light and liberality among their op-  
  
ressors, or at length, by his exterminating thun-  
der, manifest his attention to the things of this  
world, and show that they are not left to the gui-

lowing extract from that paper:  
&quot;M. de Mensnier, where he mentions that  
the slavedaw has been passed in Virginia,  
without the clause of emancipation, is pleased  
to mention that neither Mr. Wythe nor Mr.  
Jefferson was present to make the proposi  
tion they had meditated; from which people, whe  
do not give themselves the trouble to reflect or in  
quire, might conclude hastily that their absence  
was the cause why the proposition was not made:  
and, of course, that there were not in the Assembly  
persons of cirtse and fruness enough to propose  
the clanse for emancipation. This suppositioa  
would not be true. There were persons there whe  
wanted neither the virtue to propose, nor talonts to  
entorce the proposition, had they seen that the iis  
m of the Legislature was ripe for it. Thoss  
worthy charnters would feel themaelves sounded,  
degraded and discoaruged by this inea. Mr. Jefar  
son would, therefore, be obliged to M. de Mensnier,  
to mention it in some such manner as thist of the  
wo Commistionert, who had concerted the anende­  
ory clause for the gradual emancipation of slaves,  
if. Wythe could not be present, he being a membas  
of the judiciary departmant, and hin Jefse,  
ion was absent on the legation to France.  
But there were not wanting in that ase­  
sembly men of virtue enough to proposs, and  
talents to vindicate this clause. But, they saw, that  
the moment of doing it with tuccess was not arrived,  
and that an unsuccessfal effort, as too often happens,  
would only rivet still closer the chains of bondage,  
and retard the moment of delivery to this oppressed  
esciption of men. What a stapendous, what ss  
hcomprehensible machine is man! who can endure  
tail, famine, stripes, imprisonment, and death iteelf,  
in viadication of his own liberty, and the nert  
moment be deaf to all those motives whose powse  
supported him through his trial, and inflict pa hit  
welow men a bondage, one hour of which is fraugl  
with more misery than ages of that which he ross,  
in rebellion to oppose. But we must await with  
patience the workings of an overruling Providence,  
and liope that that is preparing the deliverance of  
there our suflering brethren. When the measure of  
their tears shall be full, when their groans shall  
have iavolved heaven itself in darkness, doubtlees,  
a God of justice will awaken to their distress, and  
by difasing light and liberty among their oppres

the description given by President Jefferson, in  
his prophetic augury of what awaited his country,  
when he exclaimed, ‘ What an incomprehensible  
machine is man! who can endure toil, famine,  
stripes, imprisonment, and death itself in vindi-  
cation of his own liberty, and the next moment  
be deaf to all those motives whose power sup-  
ported him through his trial, and inflict on his

over-ruling Providence, and hope that He is  
preparing the deliverance of these our suffering  
brethren. When the measure of their tears  
shall be full—when their groans shall have in-  
volved heaven itself in darkness—doubtless a God  
of justice will awaken to their distress, and dif-
