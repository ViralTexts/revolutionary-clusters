Jeofails goes farther, and is less qualified, than perhaps any  
other : by St. 21 Jac. ch. 13 ; “ No judgment after Verdict  
“shall be reversed for any variance inform only between  
“the original and declaration.” By the Virginia Statute :—  
“No judgment after Verdict shall be reversed for any vari-  
‘ance in the writ from the declaration, nor for any mistake in  
“the Christian name, &amp;c. &amp;c., the same being right in any  
“part of the Record or proceedings,” omiting the words“ in  
“form only.” The Virginia Statute has been held ever in an  
action sounding in damages, to cure after verdict the omis-  
sion of damages in the declaration. Our Statute (Laws  
Ala. p. 454, sect. 36) provides that “no summons, writ, de-

had before restricted the combatants to the use of one cudgel

preserved ; and also, because a reversal of the decree as to one  
creditor, would avoid the judgment as to all.  
  
This case is the converse of that, but is in principle the same,  
and it is therefore necessary that all the creditors should join in  
the writ of error. If but one complains, he can join the others  
in the writ, and each may assign such errors individually, as  
affect their interest. The writ of error must therefore be dis-  
missed, unless it can be amended under the recent statute au-  
thorizing the amendment of writs of error.  
  
The act provides, that “ all writs of error, wherein there shall  
be any variance from the original record, either in the name, or  
number, of the parties, the furm of the action, or other defect,  
may and shall be amended, and made agreeable to the record.

We concur in the opinion of His Honor on the first  
point, and do not on the second one.  
  
Prior to the statute of set-off, a party sued for a debt could  
not at law defeat his adversary, by the fact that he had an  
unconnected legal demand, but had to proceed by a sepa-  
rate action, and the right to apply one debt to another,  
whether of a legal or equitable nature, could not be had  
except in acourt of equity. To remedy this evil the statute  
was passed, and under it mutual debts between parties, and  
where either party was an executor or administrator and  
there were mutual debts between the testator or intestate  
and the other party, were allowed to be set one against the  
other, and the statute was of force in our courts of law un-  
der our former system, and the principle of it now exists
