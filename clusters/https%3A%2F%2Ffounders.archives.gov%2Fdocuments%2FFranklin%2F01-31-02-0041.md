Passy, November 10 1779.  
I Received my dear Friend’s two Letters, one for Wednesday &amp; one for Saturday. This is again Wednesday. I do not deserve one for to day, because I have not answered the former. But indolent as I am, and averse to Writing, the Fear of having no more of your pleasing Epistles, if I do not contribute to the Correspondance, obliges me to take up my Pen: And as M. B. has kindly sent me Word, that he sets out to-morrow to see you; instead of spending this Wednesday Evening as I have long done its Name-sakes, in your delightful Company, I sit down to spend it in thinking of you, in writing to you, &amp; in reading over &amp; over again your Letters.  
I am charm’d with your Description of Paradise, &amp; with your Plan of living there. And I approve much of your Conclusion, that in the mean time we should draw all the Good we can from this World. In my Opinion we might all draw more Good, from it than we do, &amp; suffer less Evil, if we would but take care not to give too much for our Whistles. For to me it seems that most of the unhappy People we meet with, are become so by Neglect of that Caution.  
You ask what I mean? —You love Stories, and will excuse my telling you one of my self. When I was a Child of seven Years old, my Friends on a Holiday fill’d my little Pocket with Halfpence. I went directly to a Shop where they sold Toys for Children; and being charm’d with the Sound of a Whistle that I met by the way, in the hands of another Boy, I voluntarily offer’d and gave all my Money for it. When I came home, whistling all over the House, much pleas’d with my Whistle, but disturbing all the Family, my Brothers, Sisters &amp; Cousins, understanding the Bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth, put me in mind what good Things I might have bought with the rest of the Money, &amp; laught at me so much for my Folly that I cry’d with Vexation; and the Reflection gave me more Chagrin than the Whistle gave me Pleasure.  
This however was afterwards of use to me, the Impression continuing on my Mind; so that often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to my self, Do not give too much for the Whistle; and I sav’d my Money.  
As I grew up, came into the World, and observed the Actions of Men, I thought I met many who gave too much for the Whistle. —When I saw one ambitious of Court Favour, sacrificing his Time in Attendance at Levees, his Repose, his Liberty, his Virtue and perhaps his Friend, to obtain it; I have said to my self, This Man gives too much for his Whistle. —When I saw another fond of Popularity, constantly employing himself in political Bustles, neglecting his own Affairs, and ruining them by that Neglect, He pays, says I, too much for his Whistle. —If I knew a Miser, who gave up every kind of comfortable Living, all the Pleasure of doing Good to others, all the Esteem of his Fellow Citizens, &amp; the Joys of benevolent Friendship, for the sake of Accumulating Wealth, Poor Man, says I, you pay too much for your Whistle. —When I met with a Man of Pleasure, sacrificing every laudable Improvement of his Mind or of his Fortune, to mere corporeal Satisfactions, &amp; ruining his Health in their Pursuit, Mistaken Man, says I, you are providing Pain for your self instead of Pleasure, you pay too much for your Whistle. —If I see one fond of Appearance, of fine Cloaths, fine Houses, fine Furniture, fine Equipages, all above his Fortune, for which he contracts Debts, and ends his Career in a Prison; Alas, says I, he has paid too much for his Whistle. —When I saw a beautiful sweet-temper’d Girl, marry’d to an ill-natured Brute of a Husband; What a Pity, says I, that she should pay so much for a Whistle! —In short, I conceiv’d that great Part of the Miseries of Mankind, were brought upon them by the false Estimates they had made of the Value of Things, and by their giving too much for the Whistle.  
Yet I ought to have Charity for these unhappy People, when I consider that with all this Wisdom of which I am boasting, there are certain things in the World so tempting; for Example the Apples of King John, which happily are not to be bought, for if they were put to sale by Auction, I might very easily be led to ruin my self in the Purchase, and find that I had once more given too much for the Whistle.  
Adieu, my dearest Friend, and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable Affection.

même. Quand j’étois un Enfant de cinq ou six ans, mes Amis, un Jour de Fête, remplirent ma petite Poche de Sols. J’allai tout de suite à une Boutique où on vendoit des Babioles; mais étant charmé du Son d’un Sifflet, que je rencontrai en Chemin dans les mains d’un autre petit Garçon, je lui offris &amp; donnai volontiers pour cela tout mon Argent. Revenu chez moi, sifflant par toute la Maison, fort content de mon Achat, mais fatiguant les Oreilles de toute la Famille, mes Freres, mes Soeurs, mes Cousines, entendant que j’avois tant donné pour ce mauvais Bruit, me dirent que c’étoit dix fois plus que la Valeur; alors ils me firent penser au Nombre de bonnes Choses, que je pouvois acheter avec le Reste de ma Monnoie, si j’avois été plus prudent; &amp; ils me ridiculiserent tant de ma Follie, que je pleurois de cette Vexation; &amp; la Réflexion me donnoit plus de Chagrin, que le Sifflet de Plaisir.  
Cet Accident fut cependant dans la Suite, de quelque Utilité pour moi, l’Impression restant sur mon Ame; de sorte que, tant lorsque j’étois tenté d’acheter quelque chose qui ne m’étoit pas nécessaire, je disois en moi-même, Ne donnons pas trop pour le Sifflet: &amp; j’épargnois mon Argent.  
Devenant grand Garçon, entrant dans le Monde &amp; observant les Actions des Hommes, je vis que je rencontrois Nombre de Gens qui donnoient trop pour le Sifflet.  
Quand j’ai vu quelqu’un, qui, ambitieux de la Faveur de la Cour, consumoit son Temps en les Assiduités aux Levers; son Repos, sa Liberté, sa Vertu, &amp; peut-être ses vrais Amis, pour obtenir quelque petite Distinction; j’ai dis en moi-même, Cet homme donne trop pour son Sifflet. —Quand j’en ai vu une autre, avide de se rendre populaire, &amp; pour cela s’occupant toujours de Contestations publiques, négligeant ses Affaires particulieres, &amp; les ruinant par cette Négligence; Il paye trop, ai-je dit, pour son Sifflet. —Si j’ai connu un Avare, qui renonçoit à toute Maniere de vivre commodement, à tout le Plaisir de faire le bien aux autres, à toute l’Estime de ses Compatriotes, &amp; à tous les Charmes de l’Amitié, pour avoir un Morçeau de Métal jaune: Pauvre homme, disois-je; vous donnez trop pour votre Sifflet. —Quand j’ai rencontré un Homme de Plaisir, sacrifiant tout louable Perfectionnement de son Ame, &amp; toute Amélioration de son Etat, aux Voluptés du Sens purement corporel, &amp; détruisant sa Santé dans leur Poursuite, Homme trompé, ai-je dit, vous vous procurez des Peines au lieu des Plaisirs; vous payez trop pour votre Sifflet. —Si j’en ai vu un autre, entété de beaux Habillemens, belles Maisons, beaux Meubles, beaux Equipages, toutes au-dessus de sa Fortune, qu’il ne se procuroit qu’en faisant des Dettes, &amp; en allant finir sa Carriere dans une Prison; Hélas! aije dit, il a payé trop pour son Sifflet. —Quand j’ai vu une trèsbelle Fille, d’un Naturel bon &amp; doux, mariée à un Homme féroce &amp; brutal, qui la maltraite continuellement, C’est grande Pitié, ai-je dit, qu’elle ait tant payé pour un Sifflet! —Enfin, j’ai conçu, que la plus grande Partie des Malheurs de l’Espece humaine viennent des Estimations fausses qu’on fait de la Valeur des choses, &amp; de ce qu’on donne trop pour les Sifflets.  
Néamoins je sens que je dois avoir de la Charité pour ces Gens malheureux, quand je considere qu’avec toute la Sagesse dont je me vante, il y a certaines Choses dans ce bas Monde si tentantes; par Exemple, les Pommes du Roi Jean, lesquelles heureusement ne sont pas à ache

Nephew.  
FHEN I was a child, at seven years  
; @ old, my friends on a holliday  
filled my little pocket with coppers.  
I went directly to afhop where they  
fold toys for children ; and being  
charmed with the found of a i/l  
that I met by the way, in the hands of  
another boy, I voluntarily offered and  
gave all my money for one. I then  
came home, and went whistling all over  
the house, much pleased with my 777/  
tle, but disturbing all the family. My  
brothers and sisters, and cousins, under­  
standing the bargain I had made, told  
mge [ had given four times as much for  
it as it was worth. This put me in  
mind what good things I might have  
bought with the rest of the money—  
and they laughed at me so much for  
my folly, that I cried with vexation ;  
and the refle&amp;ion gave me more chagrin  
than the #7%ifle gave me pleasure.  
This however was afterwards of use  
to me, the impression continuing on my  
mind, {o that ofien when I was tempted  
to buy some unneceflary thing, I said  
to mylelf, don’t give too much for the  
Whistle ;—and so I saved my money.  
As I grew up, came into the world,  
and observed the a&amp;ions of men, I  
thought I met with many, very many,  
awho gave too much for the Whifile.  
When I saw one too ambitious of  
court favours, facrificing his time in at­  
tendance at Levees, his repose, his li­  
berty, his virtue, and perhaps his  
friends, to attain it, 1 have said to my­  
{elf, this man gives too much for his Whifile,  
When I saw another fond of popula­

political buitles, neglecting his own af­  
fairs, and ruining them by that ne­  
gle&amp;, he pays, indeed, {ays 1, too much for  
bis IP’/inlc.  
If I knew a Miser who gave up every  
kind of comfortable living, all the plea­  
sure of doing good to others, all the  
esteem of his fellow-citizens, and the  
joys of benevolent friendfhip, for the

man, fays I, You do indsed pay too much  
JSor vour Whistle.  
When I meet with a man of pleasure,  
  
facrificing every laudable improvement  
of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere  
corporeal sensations, and ruining his  
health’ in the pursuit. M. faken man,  
fays I, you are providing pain for your­  
felf, instead of pleasure, you give too much  
JSor your Whistle.  
If I fee one fond of fine cloaths, fine  
houses, fine furniture, fine equipages,  
all above his fortune, for which he con­  
trats debts, and ends his career in pri­  
son. las! fays I, he kas paid dear,  
wery dear, for his Whistle.

pered girl, married to an ill-natured  
brute of a husband, «whar a pity it is,  
fays I, that fbe bhas paid jo much for a

In short, I conceived that great part  
of the miferiesof mankind were brought  
upon them by the falfe estimates they  
had made of the value of things, and  
by their giving too much for their

whistle. In short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of  
mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have  
made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their

STORY OF THE WHISTLE.  
  
When I was a child of seven years old,  
my friends on a holiday filled my pockets  
with coppers. I went directly to a shop  
where they sold toys for children ; and be-  
ing charmed with the sound of a whistle,  
that I met by the way in the hands of an-  
other boy, I voluntarily offered all my mo-  
ney for it. Ithen came home and went  
whistling all over the house, much pleased  
with my whistle, but disturbing all the  
family.  
  
My brothers and sisters, and cousins,  
understanding the bargain I had made,  
told me I had given four times as much for  
it as it was worth.  
  
This put me in mind what good things  
I might have bought with the rest of my  
money ; and they laughed at me so much  
for my folly, that I cried with vexation ;  
and the reflection gave me more chagrin,  
than the whistle gave me pleasure.  
  
As I grew up in the world, and observ-  
ed the actions of men, I thought I met with  
many, who gave too much for their whistle.  
  
When I see any one too fond of popu-  
larity, neglecting his own affairs to attain  
it; or a miser, giving up comfort, and the  
pleasure of doing good to others, for the  
sake of accumulating wealth; or a man of  
pleasure sacrificing every laudable improve-  
ment of his mind, and even his health, to  
mere corporeal sensations,—mistaken men,  
I think, you are paying too much for your  
whistle.  
  
When I see one so fond of appearance,  
of fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture,  
as to contract debts he cannot pay, for  
their possession ; or when I see a beauti-  
ful, sweet-tempered girl, marry an igno-  
rant brute, for the sake of wealth or posi-  
tion, alas! says I, they are paying dear  
for their whistles. .  
  
In short, I conceived, that a great part  
of the miseries of mankind were brought  
upon them by the false estimates they had  
made of the value of things, and by their  
giving too much for their whistle.

I received my dear friend’s two letters, one  
for Wednesday, one for Saturday. This is  
again Wednesday. I do not deserve one for  
|to day, because I have not answered the!  
qormer. Bat, indolent as I am, and averse to |  
writing, the fear of having no more of your  
pleasing epistles if I do not contribute to the  
correspondence, obliges me to take up my  
pen; and as Mr. B, has kindly sent me word  
that he sets out to-morrow to see you, instead  
of spending this Wednesday evening, as I  
have done its namesakee, in your delightful  
company, I sit down to spend it in thinking  
of you, in writing to you, and in thinking  
over and over again your letters.  
  
Iam charmed with your description of Par-  
adise, and with your plan of living there;  
and I approve much of your conclusion, that  
in the meantime we should draw all tbe good  
we can from this world. In my opinion, we  
might all draw more good from it than we do,  
and suffer less evils, if we would take care  
not to give too much for whistles. For to me  
it seems that most of the unhappy people we  
meet with are become so by neglect of that  
caution.  
  
You ask what I mean? You love stories,  
and will excuse my telling one of myself.  
  
When I was a child of seven years old, my  
friends on a holiday filled my pockets with  
coppers. I went directly to a shop where they  
sold toys for children; and, being charmed  
with the sound of a whistle that I met by the  
way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily  
offered and gave all my money for one. I  
then came home, and went whistling all over  
the house, much pleased with my whistle,  
but disturbing all the family. My brothers  
and sisters and cousins understanding the  
bargain I had made, told me I had given four  
times as much for it as it was worth; put me  
jn mind what good things I might have  
bought with the rest of the money, and  
laughed at me so much for my folly, that I  
cried with vexation; and the reflection gave  
me more chagrin than the whistle gave me  
pleasure.  
  
This, however, was afterwards of use to

for one&#x27;s whistle.&quot;  
&quot;When I was a child,&quot; he wrote,  
&quot;seven years old, my friends on a holi­  
day filled my pocket with coppers. I  
went directly to a show where they sold  
toys for children and, being charmed  
with the sound of a whistle, that I met  
  
by tho way in tho hands of another boy,  
I voluntarily offered and gave all my  
money for one. I then came home and  
went whistling all over the house, much  
pleased with my whistle, but disturbing  
  
all the family. My brothers nnd Bisters  
  
and cousins, understanding the bargain  
I had made, told mo I had given four  
tixesas much for it as it was worth,  
put me in mind wlint good tilings 1  
might havo bought with the rest of the  
money, and laughed at me so much for  
my folly that I cried with vexation, and  
tho reflection gave me more chagrin  
than tho whistle gave me pleasure. This,  
however, was afterward of use to me, the  
Impression continuing on my mind so  
that often when I was tempted to buy  
some unnecessary thing I said to myself,  
  
&#x27;Don&#x27;t give too much for the whistle,&#x27;  
and I saved my monoy. As I grow up,  
  
came into tiie world, and observed the  
actions of men, I thought I met with  
many, very many, who gave loo much  
for tho whistle.&quot;
