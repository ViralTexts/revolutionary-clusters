[New York, December 5, 1787]  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
AN objection of a nature different from that which has been stated and answered, in my last address, may perhaps be likewise urged against the principle of legislation for the individual citizens of America. It may be said, that it would tend to render the government of the Union too powerful, and to enable it to absorb in itself those residuary authorities, which it might be judged proper to leave with the States for local purposes. Allowing the utmost latitude to the love of power, which any reasonable man can require, I confess I am at a loss to discover what temptation the persons entrusted with the administration of the general government could ever feel to divest the States of the authorities of that description. The regulation of the mere domestic police of a State appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition. Commerce, finance, negociation and war seem to comprehend all the objects, which have charms for minds governed by that passion; and all the powers necessary to these objects ought in the first instance to be lodged in the national depository. The administration of private justice between the citizens of the same State, the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a similar nature, all those things in short which are proper to be provided for by local legislation, can never be desirable cares of a general jurisdiction. It is therefore improbable that there should exist a disposition in the Fœderal councils to usurp the powers with which they are connected; because the attempt to exercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory; and the possession of them, for that reason, would contribute nothing to the dignity, to the importance, or to the splendour of the national government.  
But let it be admitted for argument sake, that mere wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that disposition, still it may be safely affirmed, that the sense of the constituent body of the national representatives, or in other words of the people of the several States would controul the indulgence of so extravagant an appetite. It will always be far more easy for the State governments to encroach upon the national authorities, than for the national government to encroach upon the State authorities. The proof of this proposition turns upon the greater degree of influence, which the State governments, if they administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence, will generally possess over the people; a circumstance which at the same time teaches us, that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in all Fœderal Constitutions; and that too much pains cannot be taken in their organization, to give them all the force which is compatible with the principles of liberty.  
The superiority of influence in favour of the particular governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of the national government; but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the attention of the State administrations would be directed.  
It is a known fact in human nature that its affections are commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the object. Upon the same principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his neighbourhood, to his neighbourhood than to the community at large, the people of each State would be apt to feel a stronger byass towards their local governments than towards the government of the Union; unless the force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter.  
  
This strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful auxiliaries in the objects of State regulation.  
The variety of more minute interests, which will necessarily fall under the superintendence of the local administrations, and which will form so many rivulets of influence running through every part of the society, cannot be particularised without involving a detail too tedious and uninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might afford.  
There is one transcendent advantage belonging to the province of the State governments which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light—I mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice. This of all others is the most powerful, most universal and most attractive source of popular obedience and attachment. It is that, which—being the immediate and visible guardian of life and property—having its benefits and its terrors in constant activity before the public eye—regulating all those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more immediately awake—contributes more than any other circumstance to impressing upon the minds of the people affection, esteem and reverence towards the government. This great cement of society which will diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the particular governments, independent of all other causes of influence, would ensure them so decided an empire over their respective citizens, as to render them at all times a complete counterpoise and not unfrequently dangerous rivals to the power of the Union.  
The operations of the national government on the other hand falling less immediately under the observation of the mass of the citizens the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by speculative men. Relating to more general interests, they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the people; and, in proportion, less likely to inspire a habitual sense of obligation and an active sentiment of attachment.  
The reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the experience of all Fœderal constitutions, with which we are acquainted, and of all others, which have borne the least analogy to them.  
Though the ancient feudal systems were not strictly speaking confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that species of association. There was a common head, chieftain, or sovereign, whose authority extended over the whole nation; and a number of subordinate vassals; or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to them and numerous trains of inferior vassals or retainers, who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience to the persons of whom they held it. Each principal vassal was a kind of sovereign within his particular demesnes. The consequences of this situation were a continual opposition to the authority of the sovereign, and frequent wars between the great barons, or chief feudatories themselves. The power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak either to preserve the public peace or to protect the people against the oppressions of their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is emphatically stiled by historians the times of feudal anarchy.  
When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper and of superior abilities, he would acquire a personal weight and influence, which answered for the time the purposes of a more regular authority. But in general the power of the barons triumphed over that of the prince; and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown off, and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or states. In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles equally the enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people were dreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest effected an union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy. Had the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests between them and the prince must almost always have ended in their favour and in the abrigement or subversion of the royal authority.  
  
This is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture. Among other illustrations of its truth which might be cited Scotland will furnish a cogent example. The spirit of clanship which was at an early day introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and their dependents by ties equivalent to those of kindred, rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch; till the incorporation with England subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit, and reduced it within those rules of subordination, which a more rational and a more energetic system of civil polity had previously established in the latter kingdom.  
The separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with the feudal baronies; with this advantage in their favour, that from the reasons already explained, they will generally possess the confidence and good will of the people; and with so important a support will be able effectually to oppose all incroachments of the national government. It will be well if they are not able to conteract its legitimate and necessary authority. The points of similitude consist in the rivalship of power, applicable to both, and in the CONCENTRATION of large portions of the strength of the community into particular depositories, in one case at the disposal of individuals, in the other case at the disposal of political bodies.  
A concise review of the events that have attended confederate governments will further illustrate this important doctrine; an inattention to which has been the great source of our political mistakes, and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side.

Of the two most serious perils, to which a federal union,  
as such is exposed—the absorption of all power by the head,  
or anarchy among the members—the latter appeared to the  
Convention, most to be apprehended in the plurality of in-

employed.  
  
‘It will always be far more easy,” says the Federalist, “ for the state gov-

burlesque this would be upon re  
  
publican governmont! What would  
-iJ?rftTJTTiOTi7--MwttsmTnaTia--TraiulIlori  
  
have said to such political philoson  
phy V When the constitution was  
  
before tho country for adoption,  
one of the strongest reasons urged  
against it was that it tended to  
  
consolidation; that it might posoi  
  
bly bo so construed as to deprive  
  
tho Stales of their sovereign rights.  
  
There was nothing about which  
tho people of the old confederacy  
  
were more jealous. To show the  
  
groundlessness of such fears  
Hamilton in number 17 of tho  
Federalist, says :  
It may be said, that it would tend to  
render the government of Ihe I&#x27;oicn too  
powerful, and to enable it to absorb ihoee  
residuary huthoiitiis, which it might be  
judged proper to leave with the Slates for  
local purpose?. Allowing the utmost lati­  
tude to the love of power which any rea­  
sonable man can require, I conf&#x27;sa I am at  
a lews lo diecover what temptation Ihe  
jiereons entrugUd with the administration  
of the general government, could evir feel  
to divert the fcila&#x27;C! of the authority s of  
that drpcriplion. The regulation of the  
mere doineiiic police of a State, appearj to  
me to hold out blender aliuretnenla lo  
ambition. Commerce, finance, negotiation  
and war, seem to comprehend all ihe ob­  
jects which have charms for mindn gov  
erned by that pa&amp;iun ; and all the powers  
necessary to thoe object?, ought, in Ihe  
firet instance, to bj lodged in the national  
depository. The administration of private  
justice between the citizens of the rame  
titaie; the supervision of agriculture, and  
of other concerns of a similar nature; all  
  
tho.-c thing?, in short, which are proper lo  
  
be providea for by local legislation, csn  
never be desirable cares of a general  
jurisdiction. It h therefore improbable,  
that there ehould exist a disposition in the  
  
federal councils, to usurp the powers with  
  
which they are connected ; became tiie at  
  
tempt to exercise them, would be as  
  
troubltsome ss it would be nugatory ; and  
the po&amp;&#x27;cs&#x27;iou of teem, for that reason,  
  
would contribute nothing to the dignity,  
to the impottance, or to the splendor of  
  
the national government.

heart, novcr dreamed that states

recognised this when it said—&quot; It is a

stronger bias towards their local
