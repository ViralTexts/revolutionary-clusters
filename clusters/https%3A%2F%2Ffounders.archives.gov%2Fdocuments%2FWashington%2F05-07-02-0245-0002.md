he bill which is not warranted by the Constitution, it is the clause of incorporation.  
Now it appears to the Secretary of the Treasury, that this general principle is inherent in the very definition of government, and essential to every step of the progress to be made by that of the United States, namely, that every power vested in a government is in its nature sovereign; and includes, by force of the term, a right to employ all the means requisite, and fairly applicable to the attainment of the ends of such power; and which are not precluded by restrictions and exceptions specified in the Constitution, or not immoral, or not contrary to the essential ends of political Society.  
This principle in its application to government in general would be admitted as an axiom. And it will be incumbent upon those, who may incline to deny it, to prove a distinction; and to shew that a rule which in the general system of things is essential to the preservation of the social order, is inapplicable to the United States.  
  
The circumstance that the powers of sovereignty are in this Country divided between the National &amp; state governments, does not afford the distinction required. It does not follow from this, that each of the portions of power delegated to the one or to the other, is not sovereign, with regard to its proper objects. It will only follow from it, that each has sovereign power, as to certain things, and not as to other things. To deny that the government of the United States has sovereign power as to its declared purposes &amp; trusts, because its power does not extend to all cases, would be equally to deny that the state governments have sovereign power in any case, because their power does not extend to every case.

lear as that which affirms that the powers of the Fœderal government, as to its objects, are sovereign; there is a clause of its constitution which would be decisive. It is that which declares that the Constitution and the laws of the United States made in pursuance of it, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority, shall be the supreme Law of the land. The power which can create the supreme law of the Land, in any case, is doubtless sovereign as to such case.  
This general and indisputable principle puts at once an end to the abstract question, whether the United States have power to erect a corporation: that is to say, to give a legal or artificial capacity to one or more persons, distinct from the natural—For it is unquestionably incident to sovereign power to erect corporations; and consequently to that of the United States, in relation to the objects entrusted to the management of the government. The difference is this; where the authority of the government is general, it can create corporations in all cases; where it is confined to certain branches of legislation, it can create corporations only, in those cases.  
Here then as far as concerns the reasonings of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General the affirmative of the constitutionality

government is a delegation of power. But how much is delegated in each case is a question of fact, to be made out by fair reasoning, and construction upon the particular provisions of the Constitution; taking as guides the general principles, and general ends of government.  
It is not denied that there are implied as well as express powers, and that the former are as effectually delegated as the latter. And for the sake of accuracy it shall be mentioned, that there is another class of powers which may be properly denominated resulting powers. It will not be doubted that if the United States should make a conquest of any of the territories of its neighbours, they would possess sovereign jurisdiction over the conquered territory. This would rather be a result from the whole mass of the powers of the government, and from the nature of political society, than a consequence of either of the powers specially enumerated.  
But be this as it may, it furnishes a striking illustration of the general doctrine contended for. It shews an extensive case in which a power of erecting corporations is either implied in, or would result from some, or all of the powers, vested in the Natio

The only question must be in this, as in every other case, whether the mean to be employed, or in this instance, the corporation to be erected, has a natural relation to any of the acknowledged objects, or lawful ends of the government.

A strange fallacy seems to have crept into the manner of thinking and reasoning upon this subject: imagination appears to have been unusually busy concerning it. An incorporation seems to have been regarded as some great independent substantive thing—as a political end of peculiar magnitude and moment; whereas it is truly to be considered, as a quality, capacity or mean to an end.

it an artificial capacity by which it would be enabled to prosecute the business with more safety &amp; convenience.  
That the importance of the power of incorporation has been exaggerated, leading to erroneous conclusions, will further appear from tracing it to its origin. The Roman law is the source of it; according to which a voluntary association of Individuals at any time or for any purpose was capable of producing it. In England, whence our notions of it are immediately borrowed, it forms a part of the Executive authority, and the exercise of it has been often delegated by that authority: whence therefore, the ground of the supposition that it lies beyond the r

To this mode of reasoning respecting the right of employing all the means requisite to the execution of the specified powers of the Government; it is objected that none but necessary &amp; proper means are to be employed, and the Secretary of State maintains that no means are to be considered as necessary, but those without which the grant of the power would be nugatory. Nay so far does he go in this restrictive interpretation of the word, as even to make the case of necessity, which shall warrant the constitutional exercise of a power, to depend on casual and temporary circumstances; an idea which alone refutes the construction. The expediency of exercising a particular power at a particular time, must indeed depend on circumstances; but the constitutional right of

It is essential to the being of the National Government that so erroneous a conception of the meaning of the word necessary, shou’d be exploded.  
It is certain that neither the grammatical nor popular sense of the term requires that construction. According to both, necessary, often means no more than needful, requisite, incidental, useful, or conducive to—It is a common mode of expression to say, that it is necessary for a government or a person to do this or that thing, when nothing more is intended or understood, than that the interests of the government or person require or will be promoted by the doing of this or that thing.

d that there is no express power in any state-constitution to erect corporations.  
The degree in which a measure is necessary can never be a test of the legal right to adopt it: that must ever be matter of opinion; and can only be a test of expediency. The relation between the measure and the end; between the nature of the mean employed towards the execution of a power, and the object of that power; must be the criterion of constitutionality, not the more or less of necessity or utility.  
The practice of the government is against the rule of construction advocated by the Secretary of State. Of this the act concerning Light houses, beacons, buoys &amp; public piers, is a decisive example. This doubtless must be referred to the power of regulating trade, &amp; is fairly relative to it. But it cannot be affirmed that the exercise of that power in this instance was strictly necessary; or that the power itself would be nugatory without that of regulating establishments of this nature.  
This restrictive interpretation of the word necessary, is also contrary to this sound maxim of construction—namely, that the powers contained in a constitution of government, especially those which concern the general administration of the affairs of a country, its finances, trade, defence &amp;c. ought to be construed liberally, in advancement of the public good. This rule does not depend on the particular form of a government; or on the particular demarkation of the boundaries of its powers; but on the nature and objects of Government itself.  
The means by which national exigencies are to be provided for, national inconveniencies obviated, national prosperity promoted, are of such infinite variety, extent and complexity, that there must of necessity be great latitude of discretion in the selection and application of those means—Hence consequently the necessity and propriety of exercising the authorities entrusted to a government on principles of liberal construction.  
The Attorney General admits the rule, but takes a distinction between a State, and the Foederal Constitution. The

ble with the  
  
consequence imputed to it. It does not affirm that the National Government is sovereign in all respects, but that it is sovereign to a certain extent, that is, to the extent of the objects of its specified powers.  
It leaves therefore a criterion of what is constitutional and of what is not so. This criterion is the end to which the measure relates as a mean. If the end be clearly comprehended within any of the specified powers, and if the measure have an obvious relation to that end, and is not forbidden by any particular provision of the constitution; it may safely be deemed to come within the compass of the national authority. There is also this further criterion which may materially assist the decision. Does the proposed measure abridge a preexisting right of any State or of any individual? If it does not there is a strong presumption in favour of its constitutionality; and slighter relations to any declared object of the constitution may be permitted to turn the scale.  
The general objections which are to be inferred from the reasonings of the Secretary of State and of the Attorney General, to the doctrine which has been advanced have been stated, and it is hoped satisfactorily answered. Those of a more particular nature shall now be examined.  
The Secretary of State introduces his opinion with an observation, that the proposed Incorporation undertakes to create certain capacities, properties, or attributes which are against the Laws of Alienage, Descents, Escheat and Forfeiture, Distribution &amp; Monopoly, and to confer a power to make laws paramount to those of the States. And nothing, says he in another place, but a necessity invincible by other means can justify such a prostration of Laws, which constitute the pillars of our whole system of jurisprudence, and are the foundation-laws of the State-governments.  
If these are truly the foundation-laws of the several states, then have most of them subvert

ll not be between the Law of the state &amp; that of the corporation, but between the law of the State and that of the United States.  
And this argument made use of by the Secretary of State is the rejection of a proposition by the convention to empower Congress to make corporations either generally or for some special purpose.  
What was the precise nature or extent of this proposition, or what the reasons for refusing it, is not ascertained by any authentic document, or even by accurate recollection. As far as any such document exists it specifies only canals. If this was the amount of it, it would at most only prove that it was thought inexpedient to give a power to incorporate for the purpose of opening canals; for which purpose, a special power would have been necessary, except with regard to the western Territory; there being nothing in any part of the constitution respecting the regulation of Canals. It must be confessed however that very different accounts are given of the import of the proposition and of the motives for rejecting it: some affirm that it was confined to the opening of Canals and obstructions in rivers; others that it embraced banks, and others that it extended to the p

This proposition, it ought to be remarked, is not precisely, or even substantially, that which has been relied upon. The proposition relied upon is, that the specified powers of Congress are in their nature sovereign; that it is incident to sovereign power to erect corporations, &amp; that therefore Congress have a right within the sphere and in relation to the objects of their powers to erect Corporations.  
It shall however be supposed that the Attorney General would consider the two propositions in the same light and that the objection made to the one would be made to the other.  
To this objection an answer has been already given. It is this, that the doctrine is stated with this express qualification, that the right to erect corporations does only extend to cases and objects within the sphere of the specified powers of the government.

To establish such a right it remains to shew the relation of such an institution to one or more of the specified powers of the Government.  
Accordingly it is affirmed that it has a relation more or less direct to the power of collecting taxes, to that of borrowing money, to that of regulating trade between the States, and to those of raising, supporting, and maintaining fleets &amp; armies.

species of medium in which they are to be paid.  
To designate or appoint, the money or thing in which taxes are to be paid, is not only a proper, but a necessary exercise of the power of collecting them. Accordingly Congress, in the Law concerning the collection of the Duties on Imports &amp; Tonnage have provided that they shall be payable in gold and Silver. But while it was an indispensable part of the work to say in what they should be paid, the choice of the specific thing was mere matter of discretion. The payment might have been required in the commodities themselves. Taxes in kind, however ill judged, are not without precedents even in the U. States. Or it might have been in the paper money of the several States; or in the Bills of the Banks of North America New York &amp; Massachusetts, all or either of them, or it might have been in Bills issued under the authority of the United States.  
No part of this can it is presumed be disputed. The appointment then of the money or thing on which the taxes are to be paid is an incident to the power of collection. And among the expedients which may be adopted is that of bills issued under the authority of the United States.

A Bank has a direct relation to the power of borrowing money because it is an usual, and in sudden emergencies, an essential instrument in the obtaining of loans to government.  
A Nation is threatened with a war. Large sums are wanted on a sudden to make the requisite preparations. Taxes are laid for the purpose; but it requires time to obtain the benefit of them. Anticipation is ind[isp]ensable. If there be a Bank, the supply can at once be had; if there be none, loans from individuals must be sought. The progress of these is often too slow for the exigency; in some situations they are not practicable at all. Frequently when they are it is of great consequence to be able to anticipate the product of them by advances from a Bank.  
The essentiality of such an institution as an instrument of loans is exemplified at this very moment. An Indian expedition is to be prosecuted: the only fund out of which the money can aris

All the provisions and operations of government must be presumed to contemplate things as they really are.  
The institution of a Bank has also a natural relation to the regulation  
  
of Trade between the States in so far as it is conducive to the creation of a convenient medium of exchange between them, and to the Keeping up a full circulation by preventing the frequent displacement of the metals in reciprocal remittances. Money is the very hinge on which commerce turns. And this does not mean merely Gold &amp; Silver. Many other things have served the purpose with different degrees of utility. Paper has been extensively employed.  
It cannot therefore be admitted with the Attorney General that the regulation of trade between the States, as it concerns the medium of circulation and exchange ought to be considered as confined to Coin. It is even supposeable in argument that the whole or the greatest part of the Coin of the Country might be carried out of it.

in Hamilton’s original report and subsequent defence.t For  
ourselves, we rest on this simple and incontrovertible prin-  
ciple, so ably argued out by the secretary, namely, that every  
power vested in a government is in its nature SOVEREIGN,  
and includes by force of the term a right to employ all the  
means requisite, and fairly applicable to the attainment of  
the ends of such power; and (to add Hamilton’s guarding  
clause) ‘ which are not precluded by restrictions and excep-  
tions specified in the constitution, or not immoral, or not  
contrary to the essential ends of political society.””— Opinion,  
  
1.  
. The second misty prejudice before men’s minds, relates  
to the vague aotion of state banks being able to regu-  
late themselves; in other words, that the army of issuers,  
amounting now, perhaps, to some fifteen hundred, (including  
those under the free banking law of several states,) want no  
HEAD to lead them. We answer to this, upon the demon-

of powers of this nature. In his argument on the  
onstitutionality of a Bank of the United States, he  
incidentally alludes to the power of making territorial  
governments in the following terms:  
&quot;It is not deuied that there are implied as well as  
xpress powers; and the former are as effectually  
It-legated as the latter; and, for the sake of accuracy,  
it shall be meutioned, that there is another  
class of powers, which may be properly denominated  
resulting powers. It will not be doubted that,  
if the United States should make a conquest of any  
f the terri&#x27;orirs of its neighbors, they would possess  
sovereign jurisdiction over the conquered ter  
itory. This would be rather a result from the  
whole mass of powers of the Government, and from  
the nature of political society, than a consequence  
of either of the powers specially enumerated.

Mr. Hamitron favored a more liberal, and, in my judgment, a more

There “is also,” he added, “this further criterion which may  
materially assist the decision. Does the proposed measure abridge  
a pre-existing right of any State, or of any individual? If it does not,  
there is a strong presumption in favor of its constitutionality ; and

a matter of opinion, and only be a test of expediency. The relation  
between the means and the end, between the nature of a means

am not concerned with the precise accuracy of this statement in  
certain points of fact, but only with its use of terms. Dr. John-  
son, whose dictionary received his last corrections in the edition  
of 1773, defined money, with no reference to the idea of tender,  
simply and only as “metal, coined for the purposes of commerce.”  
Hamilton, in 1790, in his opinion given to Washington, on the  
constitutionality of the bill to incorporate a United States Bank,*  
said: “The Bank will be conducive to the creation of a medium  
of exchange between the States. . . . Money is the very  
hinge on which commerce turns. And this does not merely mean  
gold and silver; many other things have served the purpose of  
money with different degrees of utility. Paper has been exten-  
sively employed.”

Alexander Hamilton thus announced the rule for deter-  
mining the constitutionality of a proposed measure:  
  
“Tf the end be clearly comprehended within any of the  
specified powers, and if the measure have an obvious rela-  
tion to that end, and is not forbidden by any provision of the

Constitution, it may safely be deemed to come within the

clared that the doctrine for which he contended “does not  
affirm that the National Government is sovereign in all  
respects, but that it is sovereign to a certain extent, that is  
to the extent of the objects of its specified powers.”*  
  
In response to the objection of Mr. Randolph, the Attor-  
ney General, that the right to incorporate a bank could not  
be implied from the “nature of the Federal Government”  
because “that rule would beget a doctrine so indefinite as to  
grasp at every power,” Hamilton explicitly stated his views,  
saying (the italics are his):  
  
“This proposition is not precisely or even substantially  
that which has been relied upon. The proposition relied  
upon is that the specified powers of Congress are in their na-  
ture sovereign. That it is incident to sovereign power to  
erect corporations; and that, therefore, Congress have a  
right within the sphere and in relation to the objects of their  
power to erect corporations. It shall, however, be supposed  
that the Attorney-General would consider the two proposi-  
tions in the same light, and that the objection made to the  
one would be made to the other. To this objection an an-  
swer has already been given. It is this—that the doctrine  
is stated with this express qualification, that the right to  
erect corporations does only extend to cases and objects  
within the sphere of the specified powers of the Government.  
* * * A particular legislative power implies authority  
to erect corporations in relation to cases arising under that  
power only.”

“sovereignty” of European governments and that of Amer
