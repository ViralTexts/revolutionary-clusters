Sir  
Paris Jan. 25. 1786.  
  
I have received your favor of the 17th. of October, which though you mention as the third you have written me, is the first which has come to hand. I sincerely thank you for the communications it contains. Nothing is so grateful to me at this distance as details both great and small of what is passing in my own country. Of the latter we receive little here, because they either escape my correspondents or are thought unworthy notice. This however is a very mistaken opinion, as every one may observe by recollecting that when he has been long absent from his neighborhood the small news of that is the most pleasing and occupies his first attention either when he meets with a person from thence, or returns thither himself. I still hope therefore that the letter in which you have been so good as to give me the minute occurrences in the neighborhood of Monticello may yet come to hand, and I venture to rely on the many proofs of friendship I have received from you, for a continuance of your favors. This will be the more meritorious as I have nothing to give you in exchange. The quiet of Europe at this moment furnishes little which can attract your notice, nor will that quiet be soon disturbed, at least for the current year. Perhaps it hangs on the life of the K. of Prussia, and that hangs by a very slender thread. American reputation in Europe is not such as to be flattering to it’s citizens. Two circumstances are particularly objected to us, the nonpaiment of our debts, and the want of energy  in our government. These discourage a connection with us. I own it to be my opinion that good will arise from the destruction of our credit. I see nothing else which can restrain our disposition to luxury, and the loss of those manners which alone can preserve republican government. As it is impossible to prevent credit, the best way would be to cure it’s ill effects by giving an instantaneous recovery to the creditor. This would be reducing purchases on credit to purchases for ready money. A man would then see a prison painted on every thing he wished but had not ready money to pay for.—I fear from an expression in your letter that the people of Kentucké think of separating not only from Virginia (in which they are right) but also from the confederacy. I own I should think this a most calamitous event, and such an one as every good citizen on both sides should set himself against. Our present federal limits are not too large for good government, nor will the increase of votes in Congress produce any ill effect. On the contrary it will drown the little divisions at present existing there. Our confederacy must be viewed as the nest from which all America, North and South is to be peopled. We should take care too not to think it for the interest of that great continent to press too soon on the Spaniards. Those countries cannot be in better hands. My fear is that they are too feeble to hold them till our population can be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them peice by peice. The navigation of the Mississippi we must have. This is all we are as yet ready to receive. I have made acquaintance with a very sensible candid gentleman here who was in South America during the revolt which took place there while our revolution was working. He says that those disturbances (of which we scarcely heard any thing) cost on both sides an hundred thousand lives.—I have made a particular acquaintance here with Monsieur de Buffon, and have a great desire to give him the best idea I can of our elk. Perhaps your situation may enable you to aid me in this. Were it possible, you could not oblige me more than by sending me the horns, skeleton, and skin of an elk. The most desireable form of receiving them would be to have the skin slit from the under jaw along the belly to the tail, and down the thighs to the knee, to take the animal out, leaving the legs and hoofs, the bones of the head, and the horns attached to the skin. By sewing up the belly &amp;c. and stuffing the skin it would present the form of the animal. However as an opportunity of doing this is scarcely to be expected, I shall be glad to receive them detached, packed in a box, and sent to Richmond  to the care of Doctor Currie. Every thing of this kind is precious here, and to prevent my adding to your trouble I must close my letter with assurances of the esteem and attachment with which I am Dr. Sir your friend &amp; servt.,  
  
Th: Jefferson  
  
  
P.S. I must add a prayer for some Paccan nuts, 100. if possible, to be packed in a box of sand and sent me. They might come either directly or viâ N. York

Minister at Paris, in 1787. he wrote to Archibald Stu­

as follows:

Haltering to its citizens. Two circumstances are par­  
ticularly objected to us: the non-payment of our debts,  
and the want of energy in our Government. Thpy

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
viz.:  
Paris, January 25, 178 G.  
Dear Sir:—I have received your fa­  
vor of the 17th of October, which,  
though you mention as the third you  
have written me, is the first which has  
come to hand. I sincerely thank you  
for the communications it contains.  
Nothing is so grateful to me at this dis­  
tance as details, both great and small, of  
what is passing in my own country.  
Of the latter, we receive little here, be­  
cause they either escape my correspond­  
ents or are thought unworthy notice.  
This, however, is a very mistaken opin­  
ion, as every one may observe by recol­  
lecting that when he has been long ab­  
sent from his neighborhood the small  
news of that is the most pleasing, and  
occupies his first attention, either when  
he meets with a person from thence, or  
returns thither himself. I still hope,  
therefore, that the letter in which you  
have been so good as to give me the  
minute occurrences in the neighborhood  
of Monticello may yet come to hand,  
and I venture to rely on the many  
proofs of friendship I have received  
from you for a continuance of your fa­  
vors. This will be the more meritori­  
ous, as I have nothing to give yon in  
exchange. The quiet of Europe at this  
moment furnishes little which can at­  
tract your notice; nor will that quiet  
be soon disturbed, at least for tho cur­  
rent year. Perhaps it hangs on the life  
of the K. of Prussia, and that hangs by  
a very slender thread. American repu­  
tation in Europe is not such as to be  
flattering to its citizens. Two circum­  
stances are particularly objected to us,  
the non-payment of our debts and the  
want of energy in our government.  
These discourage a connection with us.  
I own it to be my opinion that good will  
arise from the destruction of our credit.  
I see nothing else which can restrain  
our disposition to luxury, and the loss of  
those manners which alone can preserve  
republican government. As it is impossi­  
ble to prevent credit, the best way would  
be to cure its ill effects by giving an in­  
stantaneous recovery to the creditor.  
This would be reducing purchases on  
credit to purchases for ready money.  
  
  
A man would then see a prison painted  
on everything be wished, but had not  
ready money to pay for.  
I fear from an expression in your let­  
ter that tbe people of Kentncke* think  
»f separating, not only from Virginia,  
(in which they are right,) but also from  
tbe confederacy. I own I should think  
this a most calamitous event, and such  
an one as every good citizen on botb  
sides should set himself against. Our  
present Federal limits are not too large  
for good government; nor will tbe in­  
crease of votes in Congress produce any  
ill effect. On the contrary, it will drown  
the little divisions at present existing  
there. Our confederacy must be viewed  
as the nest from which all America,  
North and South, is to be peopled. We  
should take care, too, not to think it for  
the interest of tbat great continent to  
press too soon on the Spaniards. Those  
countries cannot be in better hands.  
My fear is that they are too feeble to hold  
them till our population can be suffi­  
ciently advanced to gain it from them  
piece by piece. The navigation of the  
Mississippi we must have. This is all  
we are as yet ready to receive.  
I have made acquaintance with a very  
sensible, candid gentlemen here, who  
was in Soutb America duriae* the revolt  
which took place there while our revo  
I ution was working. He says that those  
disturbances (of which we scarely heard  
anything) cost on both sides an hun­  
dred thousand lives.  
I have made a particular acquaint­  
ance here with Monsieur de Buffon, and  
have a great desire to give him the best  
idea I can of our elk. Perhaps your  
situation m»y enable you to aid n.e in  
this. Were it possible, you could not  
oblige me more than by sending me the  
horns, skeleton, and skin of an elk.  
The most desirable form of receiving  
them would be to have the skin slit from  
the under jaw along the belly to tbe  
tail, and down the thighs to the knee; to  
take the animal out, leaving the legs  
and hoofs, the bones of the head, and  
the horns attached to the skin. By sew­  
ing up the belly, &amp;c, and shipping the  
skin, it would present the form of the  
animal. However, as an opportunity  
of doing this is scarcely to be expected,  
I shall be glad to receive them detached,  
packed in a box and sent to Richmond  
to the care of Doctor Currie. Every­  
thing of this kind is precious here, and  
to prevent my adding to your trouble  
I must close my letter, with assurances  
of the esteem and attachment with  
which I am, dear sir,  
Your friend and serv&#x27;t,  
Th. Jefferson,  
P. S.—l must add a prayer for some  
Paccan nuts—loo, if possible—to be  
packed in a box of sand and sent me.  
They might come either directly or via
