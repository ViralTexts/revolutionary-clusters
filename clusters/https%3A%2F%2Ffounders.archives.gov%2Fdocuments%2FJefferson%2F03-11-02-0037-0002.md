can determine the velocity with which the pendulum vibrates it is evident from the second of the above mentioned principles that we can determine the velocity of the ball—Now when the pendulum (after the first vibration) descends down again to its vertical position, it will have acquired the same velocity with which it began to ascend, and from the laws of falling bodies, the velocity of the centre of oscillation is such as a heavy body would acquire by falling freely through the versed-sine of the arc described by the same centre. But by the nature of the circle, the versed-sine is a third proportional to the diameter and chord of its arc; knowing therefore the diameter of the circle which is twice the distance of the centre of oscillation from the point of suspension; and also the chord of the arc through which this centre vibrates we can ascertain by a single proportion the versed-sine of the arc; and from the laws of falling bodies the velocity acquired in descending through it, that is the velocity of the centre of oscillation—  
Having determined the velocity of the centre of oscillation we can from that ascertain the velocity of the point of impact (the point where the ball strikes the pendulum) for the velocities of those points will be to each other directly, as their distances from the point

That the reader may see more distinctly the nature of this

serve that, the distance of the centre of oscillation from the  
point of suspension depending on the figure of the body em-  
ployed, if the arrangement of its particles be changed, the  
place of the centre of oscillation will be likewise changed.  
Suppose, then, a body to be furnished with a point of sus-  
pension; and another point, on which it may vibrate, to be  
fixed as nearly as can be estimated in the centre of oscillation,  
and in a line with the point of suspension and the centre of

communicating to it a velocity, which is to the velocity with  
which the ball was moving at the moment of impact, as the  
weight of the ball to the sum of the weights of ball and pen¬  
dulum. Referring this velocity to the centre of oscillation of  
the pendulum, it w ill rise through an appreciable arc of vibra¬  
tion till such velocity is extinguished. The measure of that  
arc will lead to the deteimination of the velocity, because it is  
evidently equal to the velocity which a body would acquire by

ticles near the lower end of the pendulum are accelerated  
by the more rapid oscillations of those above them. At  
some point between these there must be a particle whose  
oscillation is neither retarded nor accelerated—all the par-  
ticles above having just the same tendency to oscillate faster  
that those below them have to oscillate slower. This point  
is called the centre of oscillation, and it is obvious that the  
time of oscillation of a compound pendulum is the same as  
that of a simple pendulum whose length is equal to the dis-  
tance of the centre of oscillation from the point of suspen-  
sion.” The foregoing propositions, which are recognized  
by all Newtonians, will effectually dispose of the objection  
under consideration. The orbit of a solid, homogeneous re-  
volving sphere is the curve along which the ceztra/ particle  
moves, and the motion of every other particle is necessarily  
subordinated to the motion of that central particle. If th
