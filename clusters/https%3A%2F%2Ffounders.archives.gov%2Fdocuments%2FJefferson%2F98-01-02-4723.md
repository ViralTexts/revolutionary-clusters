uences drawn only by the imposters, and then fasten on the new doctrines the opprobrium of their false inferences. The doctrine of resurrection of the body, apparently of heathen origin, though incautiously asserted in words by Christians of many , I am glad to find so early disputed in Massachusetts. The materialists have indeed a majority on their side from a very early age of our religion, the author and finisher of which, in giving instruction to the poor, deemed it unnecessary to explain what could hardly in those times be made intelligible, the manner of existence in the future state. This part of the Creed is not taught in the Scriptures. But in his first letter to the church of Corinth, XV. 35–57, the greatest of the Apostles has illustrated; as far as the original and acquired ignorance of his correspondents could receive the explanation, this subject of a resurrection in a manner perfectly consistent with the refined intellectual philosophy of the spiritualists. Yet he strongly marks the folly of the question, “how are the dead raised, and with what bodies do they come?” Hutchinson 1.422. in a note to his chap. VI. which treats of the Indians, quotes Roger Williams, as saying, “that when he had discoursed of the creation, of the soul, of the danger of it, and the saving of it, they assented; but when he spake of the resurrection of the body, they cried out, we will never believe this.” On that passage a gentlemen, distinguish

A dignitary of the church of England, higher in learning than station, left to be published, after his death, “An Enquiry when the Resurrection of the Body or Flesh was first inserted into the public creeds.” London, 1757. When the reader learns, that A. A. Sykes was the author, he will need no other recommendation of this modest tract. A profound and original philosopher, to whom revelation owes much for his aid in “The Light of Nature pursued,” Vol. III. 425 offers a striking observation, which shall close this note: “As to the vulgar notion of a resurrection in the same form and substance we carry about at present, the various ways in which it has been expounded, and many difficulties raised upon them all, sufficiently declare it untenable: and the reason ordinarily given, because the body being partaker in the deed ought to share in the reward, as well requires a resurrection of the sword a man murders with, or the bank note he gives to charitable uses; for our mind is the sole agent, and our hands are as much instruments as any thing we hold in them

of the analogy to suppose it to imply that hundreds and

“ But some man will say. How are the dead raised, and

which the believers in a literal resurrection propose; and  
the answer the apostle gives is very pointed, and at the same  
time subversive, it is thought, of the literal theory. “ Thou  
fool, that which thou sowcst is not quickened except it die ;  
and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that
