on did the next day introduce General Miranda to the President to whom he communicated fully the object he had in view. He was most politely received, entertained and attended to—In a letter which General Miranda addressed to me under date of Decr 11th 1805 Washington he says—“I have received your letters of the 1st and 6th inst. The business you mention is on the Tapis at this present moment and will be concluded I hope in the course of this week. Not a moment is lost, and the appearances look very favorable; have a little patience, and you shall hear soon the result.”—On the second interview he mentioned my name, and asked their permission for me to go with him, and under the date of the 14th Decr he writes thus—“I saw yesterday for the second time both the Gentlemen—and after talking fully on the subject, I think I brought the business to a conclusion—Yet Mr Madison upon hearing my determination of quitting this city tomorrow, for New York, appeared surprised, and persuaded me not to leave it before Teusday next (the 17th.) when he expected me to dine with him, and to have a little more conversation.—On consideration, I thought that to stay three days longer might shew calmness and patience on my part, which would give to this step, all the dignity that I intended, tho’ I am persuaded that no more will be obtained than what is already imparted.”  
“Their tacit approbation and good wishes are evidently for us—And they do not see any difficulty that may prevent the Citizens of the United States in attending personally or sending supplies for this object, provided the public Laws are not openly violated.”—  
“Your demand of permission or leave of absence is considered impracticable and Madison thinks it easier to take the risk upon yourself at once—however we shall consider this subject with much reflection, when we shall meet at New York. on the 18th. early I shall certainly leave this for Philadelphia, from whence I shall write to you again, and without much delay proceed to New York.”  
General Miranda returned to this City; freighted the Ship Leander of Mr Samuel G. Ogden, her owner, she was cleared out at the Custom House, under the signature of the Collector and his Seal of Office, for the port of Jaemel in the Island of St. Domingo, where she arrived on the 15th day after her departure from Sandy Hook; as pr. advice from St Marks of the 23d. of Feby.  
Previous to the departure of General Miranda he addressed two letters, one to the president, and the other to the Secretary of State—as follows—

I hope, in the courfe of this week. Not a mo­

to leave it before Tuefday next, the 17th, when  
he expefted me to dine with him, and to have

which would give to this ftep all the dignity F  
intended, though I am perfuaded that no more

Their tacit approbation and good wifties are
