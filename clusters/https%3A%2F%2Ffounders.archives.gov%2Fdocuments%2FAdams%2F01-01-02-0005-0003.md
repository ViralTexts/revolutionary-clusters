Mr. Otis said this fell within the Province Law to prevent frauds and Perjuries “that no Action shall be brought whereby to charge the Defendant upon any Special Promise to answer for the Debt, Default or Miscarriages of another Person, unless the Agreement upon which such Action shall be brought, or some Memorandum or Note thereof shall be in Writing, and signed by the Party to be charged therewith,” &amp;c.

On the one side it is contended that the consideration of the agreement must be in  
writing, as well as the thing to be done on the part of the seller of the land, and that  
in this case, the word “ transferred” on the back of the receiver’s rece.pt imports no  
consideration. In the identical clause in question, respecting a contract fur the sale  
of land, I find no decision but on that part which says. no action shall be brought  
whereby to charge the defendant, upon any special promise, to answer for the debt,  
default or miscarriage of another, unless the agreement upon which such action shall  
be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing, and signed by  
the party to be charged therewith, &amp;c. There have been several decisions. The  
first on this subject took place in 1804, in the Court of King’s Bench in England, and  
reported in 5 East., p. 10, by the name of Wayne v. Walters ; the ease appears to be  
a case where one person undertook in writing, to pay the debt of another, in cop-  
sideration of forbearance to sue.
