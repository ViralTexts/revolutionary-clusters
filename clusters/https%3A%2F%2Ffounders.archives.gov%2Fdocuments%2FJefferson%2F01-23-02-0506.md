forward as much as possible explanations of the several matters it contained. But these matters were very various and the evidence of them not easily to be obtained, even where it could be obtained at all. It has been a work of time and trouble to collect from the different States, all the acts themselves, of which you had cited the titles, and to investigate the judiciary decisions which were classed with those acts, as infractions of the Treaty of Peace. To these causes of delay may be added, the daily duties of my office, necessarily multiplied during the Sessions of the legislature.  
§. 1. I can assure you with truth, that we meet you on this occasion with the sincerest dispositions to remove from between the two Countries those obstacles to a cordial friendship, which have arisen from an inexecution of some articles of the Treaty of Peace. The desire entertained by this country to be on the best terms with yours, has been constant, and has manifested itself, through it’s different forms of administration by repeated overtures to enter into such explanations and arrangements as should be right, and necessary to bring about a complete execution of the treaty. The same dispositions lead us to wish that the occasion now presented should not be defeated by useless recapitulations of what had taken place anterior to that instrument. It was with concern, therefore I observed that you had thought it necessary to  go back to the very commencement of the war, and in several parts of your letter, to enumerate and comment on all the acts of our different legislatures, passed during the whole course of it, in order to deduce from thence imputations, which your justice would have suppressed, had the whole truth been presented to your view, instead of particular traits, detached from the Ground on which they stood. However easy it would be to justify our country, by bringing into view the whole ground, on both sides, to shew that legislative warfare began with the British parliament, that, when they levelled at persons or property, it was against entire Towns or Countries, without discrimination of cause or conduct, while we touched individuals only, naming them, man by man, after due consideration of each case, and careful attention not to confound the innocent with the guilty; however advantageously we

might compare the distant and tranquil situation of their legislature with the Scenes, in the midst of which, ours were obliged to legislate, and might then ask Whether the difference of circumstance and situation would not have justified a contrary difference of conduct, and Whether the wonder ought to be that our legislatures had done so much, or so little—we will wave all this; because it would lead to recollections,

acts, and a single clause of one of them only shall be thrown among the Documents at the end of this letter; [No: 1. 2.] and with this we will drop for ever the curtain on this Tragedy!  
§. 2. We now come together to consider that Instrument which was to heal our wounds, and begin a new chapter in our history. The state in which that found things is to be considered as rightful so says the law of Nations. ‘L’etat où les choses se trouvent au moment du Traité doit passer pour legitime; et si l’on veut y apporter du changement il faut que le traité en fasse une mention expresse. Par consequent toutes les choses dont le Traité ne dit rien, doivent demeurer dans l’etat où elles se trouvent lors de sa conclusion. Vattel. L. 4. §. 21. ‘De quibus nihil dictum, ea manerit quo sunt loco,’ Wolf. 1222. No alterations then are to be claimed on either side, but those which the Treaty has provided. The moment too to which it refers, as a rule of conduct for this country at large, was the

samment l’execution—mais ce traité n’oblige les sujets, que du moment qu’il leur est notifié. and §. 25. ‘le traité devient par la publication, une Loi pour les Sujets, et ils sont obligés de se conformer desormais aux dispositions dont on y est convenu.’ And another author as pointedly says ‘Pactio pacis  paciscentes statim obligat quamprimum perfectum. Cum ex pacto veniat obligatio. Subditos vero et milites, quamprimum iisdem fuerit publicata; cum de eâ, ante publicationem ipsis certo constare non possit.’ Wolf. §. 1229. It was stipulated indeed by the IXth. article that ‘if before it’s arrival in America’ any place or territory belonging to either party should be conquered by the arms of the other, it should be restored. This was the only case in which transactions intervening between the signature and publication were to be nullified.  
Congress on the 24th. of March 1783 received informal intelligence from the Marquis de la Fayette, that Provisional Articles were concluded; and on the same day they received a copy of the Articles in a letter  
  
Document No. 3.  
  
of March 19th. from General Carleton and Admiral Digby. They immediately gave orders for recalling all armed Vessels, and communicated the

orders to those officers, who answered on the 26th. and 27th. that they were not authorized to concur in the recall of armed Vessels on   
  
Journ. Congr.  
  
their part. On the 11th. of April, Congress receive an official copy of these Articles from Doctor Franklin, with notice that a Preliminary treaty was now signed between France, Spain, and England. The event having now taken place on which the Provisional Articles were to come into effect, on the usual footing of Preliminaries, Congress immediately proclaim them, and on the 19th. of April a Cessation of hostilities is published by the Commander in Chief.—These particulars place all acts preceding the 11th. of April out of the present discussion, and confine it to the Treaty itself, and the circumstances attending it’s execution. I have therefore taken the liberty of extracting from your list of American Acts all those preceding that epoch, and of throwing them

together in the paper No. 6. as things out of question. The subsequent Acts shall be distributed according to their several Subjects of I. Exile and Confiscation. II. Debts. and III. Interest on those Debts;

d together, because blended together, in most of the acts, and blended also in the same Article of the Treaty.  
§. 3. It  
  
Rightful acts of war.  
  
cannot be denied that the state of war strictly permits a nation to seize the property of it’s enemies found within it’s own limits, or taken in war, and in whatever form it exists, whether in action or possession. This is so perspicuously laid down by one of the most respectable writers on subjects of this kind, that I shall use his words. ‘Cum ea sit belli conditio, ut hostes sint omini jure spoliati, rationis est, quascunque res hostium, apud hostes inventas, dominum mutare, et fisco cedere. Solet praeterea in singulis fere belli indictionibus constitui, ut bona hostium, tam apud nos reperta, quam capta bello, publicentur.—Si merum jus belli sequamur, etiam immobilia  possent vendi, et eorum pretium in fiscum redigi, ut in mobilibus obtinet. Sed in omni fere Europâ sola fit annotatio, ut eorum fructus, durante bello, percipiat fiscus, finito autem bello, ipsa immobilia ex pactis restituuntur pristinis dominis.’ Bynkersh. Quest. Jur. Pub. L. 1.c.7. Every nation, indeed would wish to pursue the latter practice, if under circumstances leaving them their usual resources. But the circumstances of our war were without example; excluded from all commerce even with Neutral Nations, without arms, money, or the means of getting them abroad, we were obliged to avail ourselves of such resources as we found at home. Great Britain too, did not consider it as an ordinary war, but a rebellion; she did not conduct it according the rules of war established by the law of nations but according to her acts of Parliament, made from time to time to suit circumstances. She would not admit our title even to the strict rights of ordinary war: she cannot then claim from us it’s liberalities.—Yet the confiscations of property were by no means universal; and that of debts still less so. What effect was to be produced on them by the Treaty, will be seen by the words of the Vth. Article which are as follows.

eturn of the blessings of Peace should universally prevail. And that Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the several States, that the estates, rights, and properties of such last mentioned persons, shall be restored to them, they refunding to any persons who may be now in possession, the bonâ fide price (where any has been given) which such persons may have paid on purchasing any of the said lands, rights, or properties, since the confiscation. And it is agreed, that all persons, who have any interest in confiscated lands, either by Debts, Marriage Settlements,  or otherwise, shall meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.  
‘Article VIth. That there shall be no future confiscations made.’  
§. 5. Observe  
  
Recommendatory by Express words.  
  
that in every other article the parties agree expressly that such and such things shall be done. In this they only agree to recommend that they shall be done. You are pleased to say (pa. 7.) ‘It cannot be presumed that the Commissioners who negotiated the Treaty of Peace would engage in behalf of Congress to make recommendations to the legislatures of the respective States, which they did not expect to be effectual, or enter into direct Stipulations which they had not the power to enforce.’ On the contrary we may fairly presume that if they had had the power to enforce, they would not merely have recommended. When in every other article they agree expressly to do, why in this do they change the Stile suddenly and agree only to recommend? because the things here proposed to be done were retrospective in their nature, would tear up the laws of the several States, and the contracts and transactions private and public which had taken place under them; and retrospective laws were forbidden by the Constitutions of several of the States. Between persons whose native language is that of this Treaty it is unnecessary to explain the difference between enacting a thing to be done, and recommending it to be done; the words themselves being as well understood as any by which they could be explained. But it may not be unnecessary to observe that recommendations to the people, instead of laws, had been introduced among us, and were rendered familiar in the interval between discontinuing the old, and establishing the new governments. The conventions and committees who then assembled to guide the conduct of the people, having no Authority to oblige them by law, took up the practice of simply recommending measures to them. These recommendations they either complied with, or not, at their pleasure. If they refused, there was complaint, but no compulsion. So after organizing the governments, if at any time it became expedient that a thing should be done, which Congress, or any other of the organized Bodies, were not authorized to ordain, they simply recommended, and left to the people, or their legislatures, to comply or not, as they pleased. It was impossible that the negotiators on either side should have been ignorant of the difference between agreeing to do a thing, and agreeing only to recommend it to be done. The import of the terms is so different, that no deception or surprise could be supposed, even if there were no evidence that the difference was attended to, explained and understood.  
  
§. 6. But  
  
Sense of Negotiators.  
  
the evidence on this occasion removes all question. It is well known that the British court had it extremely at heart to procure a restitution of the estates of the refugees, who had gone over to their side: that they proposed it in the first conferences, and insisted on it to the last: that our Commissioners, on the other hand, refused it from first to last, urging 1st: That it was unreasonable to restore the confiscated property of the refugees, unless they would reimburse the destruction of the property of our Citizens, committed on their part; and 2dly. That it was beyond the powers of the Commissioners to stipulate, or of Congress to enforce. On this point the Treaty hung long. It was the subject of a special mission of a confidential Agent of the British Negotiator from Paris to London. It was still insisted on, on his return, and still protested against by our Commissioners: and when they were urged to agree only that Congress should recommend to the State legislatures to restore the estates &amp;c. of the refugees, they were expressly told that the legislatures would not regard the recommendation.

g to oppose to the clamours of the refugees, to keep alive a hope in them that they might yet get their property from the State legislatures; and that if they should fail in this, they would have ground to demand indemnification from their own government: and he might think it a circumstance of present relief, at least, that the question of indemnification by them should be kept out of sight till time and events should open it upon the Nation insensibly.  
§. 7. The same was perfectly understood by the British Ministry, and  
  
Sense of Ministers  
  
by the members of both houses of Parliament, as well those who advocated, as those who opposed the Treaty: the latter of whom, being out of the Secrets of the Negotiation, must have formed their Judgments on the mere import of the terms. That all parties concurred in this exposition will appear by the following extracts from the Parliamentary register, a work, which without pretending to give what is spoken with verbal accuracy, may yet be relied on, we presume, for the general reasoning and opinions of the Speakers.  House  
  
Sense of Parliament.  
  
of Commons.  
The Preliminary Articles under consideration. 1783. Feb. 17. Mr. Thomas Pitt. ‘That the interest of the sincere loyalists were as dear to him as to any man, but that he could never think it would have been promoted by carrying on that unfortunate war which parliament had in fact suspended before the beginning of the Treaty; that it was impossible, after the part Congress was pleased to take in it, to conceive that their recommendation would not have it’s proper influence on the different legislatures; that he did not himself see what more could have been done on their behalf, except by renewing the war for their sakes, and increasing ours and their calamities.’ 9. Debrett’s Parl. Register 233.  
Mr. Wilberforce. ‘When he considered the case of the loyalists he confessed he felt himself there conquered; there he saw his country humiliated; he saw her at the feet of America! Still he was induced to believe, that Congress would religiously comply with the Article, and that the loyalists would obtain redress from America. Should they not, this country was bound to afford it them. They must be compensated; Ministers, he was persuaded, meant to keep the faith of the Nation with them, and he verily believed, had obtained the best terms they possibly could for them.’ ib. 236.  
Mr. Secretary Townshend. ‘He was ready to admit that many of the Loyalists had the strongest claims upon this Country; and he trusted, should the recommendation of Congress to the american States prove unsuccessful, which he flattered himself would not be the case, this country would feel itself bound in honor to make them full compensation for their losses.’ ib. 262.  
House of Lords Feb. 17. 1783.  
Lord Shelburne. ‘A part must be wounded, that the whole of the Empire may not perish. If better terms could be had, think you, my Lords, that I would not have embraced them? You all know my creed. You all know my steadiness. If it were possible to put aside the bitter cup the Adversities of this Country presented to me, you know I would have done it: but you called for peace.—I had but the alternative, either to accept the terms, said Congress, of our recommendation to the States, in favor of the Colonists, or continue the war. It is in our power to do no more than recommend. Is there any man who hears me, who will clap his hand on his heart, and step forward and say, I ought to have broken off the Treaty? If there be, I am sure he neither knows the State of the country, nor yet has he paid any attention to the wishes of it.—But say the worst: and that, after all, this estimable set of men are not received and cherished in the bosom of their own country.  Is England so lost to gratitude, and all the feelings of humanity, as not to afford them an Asylum? Who can be so base as to think she will refuse it to them? Surely it cannot be that noble minded man who would plunge his country again kneedeep in blood, and saddle it with an expense of twenty millions for the purpose of restoring them. Without one drop of blood spilt, and without one fifth of the expense of one year’s campaign, happiness and ease can be given the loyalists in as ample a manner as these blessings were ever in their enjoyment: therefore let the outcry cease on this head.’ ib. 70.71.  
Lord Hawke. ‘In America, said he, Congress had engaged to recommend their [the Loyalists] cause to the legislatures of the country: what other term could they adopt? He had searched the journals of Congress on this subject: what other term did they, or do they ever adopt in their requisitions to the different Provinces? It is an undertaking on the part of Congress: that body, like the King here, is the Executive power in america. Can the Crown undertake for the two Houses of Parliament? It can only recommend. He flattered himself that recommendation would be attended with success: but, said he, state the case, that it will not, the liberality of Great Britain is still open to them. Ministers had pledged themselves to indemnify them, not only in the address now moved for, but even in the last address, and in the Speech from the Throne.’  
Lord Walsingham. ‘We had only the recommendation of Congress to trust to; and how often had their recommendations been fruitless? There were many cases in point in which provincial assemblies had peremptorily refused the recommendations of Congress. It was but the other day the States refused money on the recommendations of Congress. Rhode Island unanimously refused when the Congress desired to be authorized to lay a duty of 5 ⅌ Cent; because the funds had failed. Many other circumstances might be produced of the failure of the recommendations of Congress, and therefore, we ought not, in negotiating for the Loyalists, to have trusted to the recommendations of Congress. Nothing but the repeal of the acts existing against them ought to have sufficed, as nothing else could give effect to the treaty. Repeal was not mentioned. They had only stipulated to revise and reconsider them.’ 11. Debrett’s Parl. reg. 44.  
Lord Sackville. ‘The King’s ministers had weakly imagined that the recommendation of Congress was a sufficient security for these unhappy men. For his own part, so far from believing that this would be sufficient, or any thing like sufficient for their protection, he was of a direct contrary opinion: and if they entertained any notions of this sort, he would put an end to their idle hopes at once, by reading from  a paper in his pocket, a resolution, which the assembly of Virginia had come to, so late as on the 17th. of December last—the resolution was as follows. ‘That all demands or requests of the British court for the restitution of property confiscated by this State, being neither supported by law, equity or policy, are wholly inadmissible: and that our Delegates in Congress be instructed to move Congress, that they may direct their Deputies, who shall represent these States in the general Congress for adjusting a peace or truce, neither to agree to any such restitution, or submit that the laws made by any independent State in this Union be subjected to the adjudication of any power or powers on earth.” ib. pa. 62. 63.  
Some of the Speakers seem to have had not very accurate ideas of our Government. All of them however, have perfectly understood that a recommendation was a matter, not of obligation or coercion, but of persuasion and influence merely. They appear to have entertained greater or less degrees of hope or doubt as to it’s effect on the legislatures, and though willing to see the result of this chance, yet if it failed, they were prepared to take the work of indemnification on themselves.  
§. 8. The  
  
Compliance by Congress.  
  
agreement then being only that Congress should recommend to the State legislatures a restitution of estates and liberty to remain a twelve-month for the purpose of soliciting the restitution and to recommend a revision of all acts regarding the Premises, Congress did immediately, on the receipt of the Definitive Articles, to wit, on the 14th. of January 1784 come to the following Resolution, vizt. ‘Resolved, unanimously, nine States being present, That it be, and it is hereby earnestly recommended to the legislatures of the respective States to provide for the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties which have been confiscated, belonging to real British Subjects; and also of the estates, rights, and properties of persons resident in districts, which were in the possession of his Britannic Majesty’s arms, at any time between the 30th. day of Nov. 1782, and the 14th. day of January 1784, and who have not borne arms against the said United States; and that persons of any other description shall have free liberty to go to any part or parts of any of the thirteen United States, and therein to remain twelve months unmolested in their endeavours to obtain the restitution of such of their estates, rights, and properties as may have been confiscated: And it is also hereby earnestly recommended to the several States to reconsider and revise all their acts or laws regarding the premises, so as to render the said laws or acts perfectly consistent not only with justice and equity, but with that spirit of conciliation, which, on the return of the Blessings of peace should universally prevail: And it is hereby also earnestly recommended to  the several States, that the estates, rights, and properties of such last mentioned persons should be restored to them, they refunding to any persons who may be now in possession the bonâ fide price (where any has been given) which such persons may have paid on purchasing any of the said lands, rights or properties since the confiscation.  
Ordered, that a copy of the proclamation of this date, together with the recommendation, be transmitted to the several States by the Secretary.  
§. 9. The British Negotiators had been told by ours that all the States would refuse to comply with this recommendation. One only however, refused altogether. The others complied in a greater or less degree, according to the circumstances and dispositions in which the events of the war had left them. But had all of them refused, it would have been no violation of the Vth. Article, but an exercise of that freedom of will, which was reserved to them, and so understood by all parties.  
The  
  
acts of States.  
  
following are the acts of your catalogue which belong to this head, with such short observations as are necessary to explain them; Beginning at that end of the Union, where the war having raged most, we shall meet with the most repugnance to favor.  
§. 10. Georeia.  
July 29.  
  
[B.7.] 1783.  
  
An act releasing certain persons from their bargains. A law had been passed during the war, to wit, in 1782 [A.30.] confiscating the estates of persons therein named, and directing them to be sold. They were sold; but some misunderstanding happened to prevail among the purchasers, as to the mode of payment. This act of 1783, therefore, permits such persons to relinquish their bargains, and authorizes a new sale—the lands remaining confiscated under the law made previous to the Peace.  
Feb. 22.  
  
[B.4.] 1785.  
  
An act to authorize the Auditor to liquidate the demands of such persons as have claims against the confiscated Estates. In the same law of confiscations made during the war, it had been provided that the estates confiscated should be subject to pay the debts of their former owner. This law of 1785 gave authority to the Auditor to settle with and pay the creditors, and to sell the remaining part of the estate confiscated as before.  
Feb. 10.  
  
[B.8.] 1787.  
  
An act to compel the settlement of public accounts, for inflicting penalties, and vesting the Auditor with certain powers. This law also is founded on the same confiscation law of 1782 requiring the Auditor to press the settlement with the creditors, &amp;c.  
Feb. 7.  
  
[C.3.] 1785  
  
An act for ascertaining the rights of Aliens, and pointing out the mode for the admission of citizens. It first describes what  persons shall be free to become citizens, and then declares none shall be capable of that character who had been named in any confiscation law, or banished, or had borne arms against them. This act does not prohibit either the refugees, or real British Subjects from coming into the State to pursue their lawful affairs. It only excludes the former from the right of citizenship; and, it is to be observed, that this recommendatory Article does not say a word about giving them a right to become citizens. If the conduct of Georgia should appear to have been peculiarly uncomplying, it must be remembered that, that state had peculiarly suffered; that the British army had entirely overrun it; had held possession of it for some years; and that all the inhabitants had been obliged either to abandon their estates and fly their country, or to remain in it under a military government.  
§. 11. South Carolina.  
Augt. 15.  
  
[A.31.] 1783.  
  
An act to vest 180 acres of land late the property of James Holmes in certain persons in trust for the benefit of a public school. These lands had been confiscated and sold during the war. The present law prescribes certain proceedings as to the purchasers, and provides for paying the debts of the former proprietors.  
Mar. 22.  
  
[B.6.] 1786.  
  
An act to amend the confiscation act, and for other purposes therein mentioned. This relates only to estates which had been confiscated before the peace. It makes some provision towards a final settlement, and relieves a number of persons from the amercements which had been imposed on them during the war for the part they had taken.  
March 26.  
  
[C.9.] 1784  
  
An act restoring to certain persons their estates, and permitting the said persons to return, and for other purposes. This act recites that certain estates had been confiscated, and the owners 124 in number banished by former laws; that Congress had earnestly recommended in the terms of the treaty—it therefore distributes them into three lists or classes, restoring to all of them the lands themselves where they remained unsold, and the price, where sold: requiring from those in lists No. 1. and 3. to pay 12 ⅌ Cent on the value of what was restored, and No. 2. nothing; and it permits all of them to return, only disqualifying those of No. 1. and 3. who had borne military commissions against them, from holding any office for seven years.  
Governor Moultrie’s  
  
[Doct. No.44.]  
  
letter of June 21. 1786 informs us that most of the confiscations had been restored; that the value of those not restored, was far less than that of the property of their citizens carried off by the British; and that fifteen instead of twelve Months had been allowed to the persons for whom permission was recommended to come and solicit restitution.  
  
§. 12. North Carolina.  
Oct.  
  
[B.3.] 1784.  
  
An Act directing the sale of confiscated property.  
Dec. 29.  
  
[B.2.] 1785.  
  
An Act to secure and quiet in their possessions the purchasers of Lands, Goods, &amp;c. sold or to be sold by the Commissioners of forfeited estates. These two acts relate expressly to property ‘heretofore confiscated,’ and secure purchasers under those former confiscations.  
The  
  
No.54.[D.11.]  
  
case of Bayard v. Singleton adjudged in a court of Judicature in North   
  
1790.  
  
Carolina. Bayard was a purchaser of part of an estate confiscated during the war, and the Court adjudged his title valid; and it is difficult to conceive on what principle that adjudication can be complained of as an infraction of the Treaty.  
Nov. 19.  
  
1785.  
  
An act was passed to restore a confiscated estate to the former proprietor, Edward Bridgen.  
Oct.  
  
[C.7.] 1784.  
  
An Act to describe and ascertain such persons as owed allegiance to the State, and impose certain disqualifications on certain persons therein named.  
Nov.  
  
[C.8.] 1785.  
  
An act to amend the preceding act.  
April.  
  
[C.1.] 1788.  
  
An act of pardon and oblivion. The two first of these acts exercised the right of the State to describe who should be it’s citizens, and who should be disqualified from holding offices. The last intitled an act of pardon and oblivion, I have not been able to see; but so far as it pardons, it is a compliance with the recommendation of Congress under the treaty, and so far as it excepts persons out of the pardon, it is a refusal to comply with the recommendation, which it had a right to do. It does not appear that there has been any obstruction to the return of those persons who had claims to prosecute.  
§. 13. Virginia.  
The catalogue under examination presents no act of this State subsequent to the treaty of Peace on the subject of confiscations. By one of Oct. 18. 1784,  
  
Doct. No.13.  
  
they declared there should be no future confiscations. But they did not chuse to comply with the recommendation of Congress, as to the restoration of property which had been already confiscated: with respect to persons, the first assembly which met after the peace, passed—  
Oct.  
  
[C.5.] 1783..  
  
The act prohibiting the migration of certain persons to this Commonwealth, and for other purposes therein mentioned, which was afterwards amended by  
Oct.  
  
[C.6.] 1786.  
  
An act to explain and amend the preceding.  
These acts, after declaring who shall not have a right to migrate to, or become citizens of the State, have each an express proviso that nothing contained in them shall be so construed as to contravene the treaty of peace with Great Britain, and a great number of the refugees  having come into the state under the protection of the first law, and it being understood that a party was forming in the State to ill treat them,  
  
Doct. No.14.  
  
the Governor, July 26. 1784 published the Proclamation No. 14. enjoining all Magistrates, and other civil officers to protect them, and secure to them the rights derived from the treaty and acts of assembly aforesaid, and to bring to punishment all who should offend herein, in consequence of which those persons remained quietly in the state, and many of them have remained to this day.  
§. 14. Maryland.  
Nov.  
  
[B.9.] 1785.  
  
An act to vest certain powers in the Governor and Council. Sec. 3.  
Nov.  
  
[B.10.] 1788.  
  
An act to empower the Governor and Council to compound with [] the discoverers of British property, and for other purposes. These acts relate purely to property which had been confiscated during the war, and the State not chusing to restore it as recommended by Congress, passed them for bringing to a conclusion the settlement of all transactions relative to the confiscated property.  
I do not find any law of this state which could prohibit the free return of their refugees, or the reception of the Subjects of Great Britain, or of any other country. And I find that they passed inNov.  
  
1786.  
  
An act to repeal that part of the act for the security of their government which disqualified non jurors from holding offices and voting at elections.  
The  
  
[D.11.] 1790.  
  
case of Harrison’s representatives in the Court of chancery of Maryland is in the list of infractions. These representatives being British subjects, and the laws of this country, like those of England, not permitting aliens to hold lands, the question was whether british subjects were aliens. They decided that they were; consequently that they could not take lands, and consequently also, that the lands in this case escheated to the State. Whereupon the legislature immediately interposed and passed a special act allowing the benefits of the succession   
  
see Doct. No:49.  
  
to the representatives. But had they not relieved them, the case would not have come under the treaty, for there is no stipulation in that doing away the laws of alienage and enabling the members of each nation to inherit or hold lands in the other.  
§. 15. Delaware.  
This state in the year 1778 passed an act of confiscation against 46 citizens by name, who had joined in arms against them, unless they should come in by a given day and stand their trial. The estates of those who did not, were sold and the whole business soon closed. They never passed any other act on the subject, either before or after the peace. There was no restitution, because there was nothing to  restore—their debts having more than exhausted the proceeds of the sales  
  
Doct. No.15.  
  
of their property as appears by Mr. Reed’s letter, and that all persons were permitted to return, and such as chose it have remained there in quiet to this day.  
§. 16. Pennsylvania.  
The catalogue furnishes no transaction of this State, subsequent to the arrival of the treaty of Peace, on the subject of confiscation, except Aug.  
  
[C.15.] 1790.  
  
An order of the Executive council to sell part of Harry Gordon’s real estate, under the act of Jany. 31. 1783. This person had been summoned by Proclamation, by the name of Henry Gordon, to appear before the 1st. day of November 1781, and, failing, his estate was seized by the Commissioners of forfeitures, and most of it sold. The act 1783 January 31, cured the misnomer, and directed what remained of his estate to be sold. The confiscation being complete, it was for them to say whether they would restore it in compliance with the recommendation   
  
No. 16.  
  
of Congress. They did not, and the Executive completed the sale as they were bound to do. All persons were permitted to return to this State, and you see many of them living here to this day in quiet and esteem.  
§. 17. New Jersey.  
The only act alledged against this State as to the recommendatory article, isDec. 23.  
  
[A.33.] 1783.  
  
An act to appropriate a certain forfeited estate. This was the estate of John Zabriski, which had been forfeited during the war, and the act gives it to Major General Baron Steuben in reward for his Services. The confiscation being complete, the legislature were free to do this.  
Governor  
  
Doct. No.41.  
  
Livingston’s letter, is an additional testimony of the moderation of this state, after the Proclamation of Peace, and from that we have a right to conclude that no persons were prevented from returning and remaining indefinitely.  
§. 18. New York.  
This State had been among the first invaded, the greatest part of it had been possessed by the enemy through the war; it was the last evacuated; it’s inhabitants had in great numbers been driven off their farms, their property wasted, and themselves living in exile and penury, and reduced from affluence to want, it is not to be wondered at if their sensations were among the most lively—accordingly they in the very first moment, gave a flat refusal to the recommendation, as to the  
  
Doct. No.17.  
  
restoration of property, see Document No. 17. containing their reasons.   
  
[C.4.] 1784.  
  
They passed, however May 12. The act to preserve the freedom and independence of this State, and for other purposes therein  mentioned, in which, after disqualifying refugees from offices, they permit them to come and remain as long as may be absolutely necessary to defend their estates.  
§. 19. Connecticut.  
A single act only on the same subject is alledged against this State after the treaty of Peace. This wasAn  
  
[A.5.] 1790.  
  
act directing certain confiscated estates to be sold. The title shews they   
  
Doct. No. 18.  
  
were old confiscations, not new ones, and Governor Huntington’s letter, informs us that all confiscations and prosecutions were stopped on the peace, that some restorations of property took place, and all persons were free to return.  
§. 20. Rhode Island.  
The titles of 4 Acts of this State are cited in your appendix, to wit—May 27.  
  
[C.11.] 1783  
  
An act to send out of the State N. Spink and J. Underwood who had formerly joined the enemy, and were returned to Rhode Island.  
June 8.  
  
[C.12.] 1783  
  
An act to send William Young theretofore banished out of the State and forbidden to return at his peril.  
June 12.  
  
[C.13.] 1783.  
  
An act allowing William Brenton late an absentee, to visi his family for one week, then sent away not to return.  
Oct.  
  
[C.14.] 1783  
  
An act to banish S. Knowles (whose estate had been forfeited) on pain of death if he return. Mr. Channing, the attorney of the United States   
  
Doct. No. 19.  
  
for that District, says in his letter, ‘he had sent me all the acts of that legislature that affect either the debts or the persons of British subjects, or american refugees.’ The acts above cited are not among them. In the answer of April 6. which you were pleased to give to mine of March 30. desiring copies of these, among other papers, you say the book is no longer in your possession. These circumstances, will I hope excuse my not answering or admitting these acts, and justify my proceeding to observe that nothing is produced against this State on this subject after the treaty; and the District Attorney’s letter, before cited informs us that their courts considered the treaty as paramount the laws of the State, and decided accordingly, both as to persons and property, and that the estates of all British subjects seized by the State had   
  
No. 20.  
  
been restored, and the rents and profits accounted for. Governor Collins’s letter No. 20. is a further evidence of the compliance of this State.  
§. 21. Massachusetts.  
Mar. 24.  
  
[C.2.] 1784.  
  
This State passed, an act for repealing two laws of this State, and for asserting the right of this free and sovereign Commonwealth to expel such aliens as may be dangerous to the Peace and good order of Government, the effect of which was to reject the recommendation  of Congress as to the return of

laws of this State, they allowed them to redeem their lands pledged for debt, by paying the debt.  
§. 22. New Hampshire.  
Against New Hampshire nothing is alledged; that State, having not been invaded at all, was not induced to exercise any acts of rigor against the subjects or adherents of their enemies.  
The acts then, which have been complained of as violations of the Vth: Article, were such as the States were free to pass notwithstanding the recommendation, such as it was well understood they would be free to pass without any imputation of infraction and may, therefore, be put entirely out of question.  
§. 23.  
  
future confiscations  
  
And we may further observe with respect to the same acts that they have been considered as infractions not only of the Vth. Article, which recommended the restoration of the confiscations which had taken place during the war, but also of that part of the VIth. Article which forbade future confiscations, but not one of them touched an estate which had not been before confiscated; for you will observe *that  
  
3 Blackst. 260.  
  
an act of the legislature confiscating lands, stands in place of an Office found in ordinary cases: and that on the passage of the act, as on the finding of the office, the State stands ipso facto possessed of the lands, without a formal entry. The confiscation then is complete by the passage of the act. Both the title and possession being devested out of the former proprietor, and vested in the state, no subsequent proceedings relative to the lands, are acts of confiscation, but are mere exercises of ownership, whether by levying profits, conveying for a time by lease, or in perpetuo, by an absolute deed. I believe, therefore, it may be said with truth that there was not a single confiscation made in any one of the United States, after Notification of the treaty: and consequently it will not be necessary to notice again this part of the VIth. Article.  
§. 24.  
  
citizenship of Refugees.  
  
Before quitting the Recommendatory article, two passages in the letter are to be noted, which, applying to all the States in general could not have been properly answered under any one of them in particular. In page 16. is the following passage. ‘The express provision in the Treaty for the restitution of the estates and properties of persons of both these descriptions [British subjects, and Americans who had staid within the British lines, but had not borne arms] certainly comprehended a virtual acquiescence in their right to reside where  their property was situated, and to be restored to the privileges of citizenship.’ Here seems to be a double Error; first in supposing an express provision whereas the words of the article, and the collateral testimony adduced, have shewn that the provision was neither express, nor meant to be so. And secondly, in inferring from a restitution of the estate, a virtual acquiescence in the right of the party to reside where the estate is. Nothing is more frequent than for a sovereign to banish the person and leave him possessed of his estate. The inference in the present case too is contradicted as to the refugees by the recommendation to permit their residence twelve months; and as to British subjects, by the silence of the Article, and the improbability that the British Plenipotentiary meant to stipulate a right for British subjects to emigrate and become members of another community.  
§. 25.  
  
Indemnifications by Gr. Britain  
  
Again, in pa. 34, it is said ‘The nation of Great Britain has been involved in the payment to them of no less a Sum than four millions sterling, as a partial compensation for the losses they had sustained.’ It has been before proved that Mr. Oswald understood perfectly that no indemnification was claimable from us; that, on the contrary, we had a counterclaim of indemnification to much larger amount: it has been supposed, and not without grounds, that the glimmering of hope provided by the recommendatory article, was to quiet for the present the Clamours of the sufferers, and to keep their weight out of the Scale of opposition to the peace, trusting to time and events for an oblivion of these claims, or a gradual ripening of the public mind to meet and satisfy them at a moment of less embarrassment: the latter is the turn which the thing took. The claimants continued their importunities, and the government determined at length to indemnify them for their losses; and, open-handedly as they went to work, it cost them less than to have settled with us the just account of mutual indemnification, urged by our Commissioners. It may be well doubted whether there were not single states of our Union to which the four Millions you have paid, would have been no indemnification for the losses of property sustained contrary even to the laws of war: and what sum would have indemnified the whole thirteen, and consequently, to what sum our whole losses of this description have amounted, would be difficult to say. However, though in no wise interested in the sums you thought proper to give to the refugees, we could not be inattentive to the measure in which they were dealt out. Those who were on the spot, and who knew intimately the state of affairs with the individuals of this description, who knew that their debts often exceeded their possessions, insomuch that the most faithful administration made them pay but a few Shillings in the pound, heard  with wonder of the sums given, and could not but conclude that those largesses were meant for something more than loss of property; that services and other circumstances must have had great influence. The sum paid is, therefore, no imputation on us. We have borne our own losses. We have even lessened yours by numerous restitutions, where circumstances admitted them: and we have much the worst of the Bargain, by the alternative you chose to accept, of indemnifying your own sufferers, rather than ours.  
§. 26. II.  
  
Debts  
  
The article of DEBTS is next in order: but, to place on their true   
  
British Proceedings.  
  
grounds, our proceedings relative to them, it will be necessary to take a view of the British proceedings which are the subject of complaint in my letter of December 15.  
In  
  
Negroes.  
  
the VIIth. article it was stipulated that his Britannic Majesty should withdraw his armies, garrisons, and fleets without carrying away any Negroes or other property of the american Inhabitants. This stipulation was known to the British commanding Officers before the 19th. of March 1783, as provisionally agreed, and on the 5th. of April, they received official Notice from their Court of the conclusion and ratification of the preliminary Articles between France, Spain, and Great Britain, which gave activity to ours, as appears by the letter of   
  
No.21  
  
Sir Guy Carleton to General Washington, dated April 6. 1783 [Document No. 21]. From this time then, surely no Negroes could be carried away without a violation of the Treaty. Yet we find that so early as the 6th. of May, a large number of them had already been embarked for Nova Scotia, of which, as contrary to an express stipulation in the Treaty, General Washington declared to him his sense and his surprise. In the letter of Sir Guy Carleton of May 12th. (annexed to mine to you of the 15th. of December) he admits the fact, palliates it by saying he had no right ‘to deprive the Negroes of that liberty he found them possessed of, that it was unfriendly to suppose that the King’s minister could stipulate to be guilty of a notorious breach of the public faith towards the Negroes, and that if it was his intention, it must be adjusted by compensation, restoration being utterly impracticable, where inseparable from a breach of public faith.’ But surely, Sir, an officer of the King is not to question the validity of the King’s engagements, nor violate his solemn Treaties, on his own scruples about the public faith. Under this pretext, however, General Carleton went on in daily infractions, embarking from time to time, between his notice of the Treaty the 5th. of April, and the evacuation of New York Nov. 25th. 3,000 Negroes, of whom our Commissioners had inspection, and a very large number more in public and private vessels, of whom they were not permitted to have inspection.

n the United States. ‘When no precise term, says a writer on the law of nations [Vattel L. 4. c. 26.] has been marked for the accomplishment of a Treaty, and for the execution of each of it’s articles, good sense determines that every point should be executed as soon as possible: this is without doubt what was understood.’ The term in the Treaty, with all convenient speed, amounts to the same thing, and clearly excludes all unnecessary delay. The general pacification being signed on the 20th. of January, some time would be requisite for the Orders for evacuation to come over to America, for the removal of Stores, property and persons; and, finally, for the act of evacuation. The larger the post, the longer the time necessary to remove all it’s contents; the smaller the sooner done. Hence, though General Carleton received his orders to evacuate New York in the Month of April, the evacuation was not completed till late in November. It had been the principal place of arms and Stores; the Seat, as it were, of their general Government, and the asylum of those who had fled to them. A great quantity of shipping was necessary, therefore, for the removal, and the General was obliged to call for a part from foreign countries. These causes of delay were duly respected on our part. But the Posts of Michillimackinac,  
  
instead of this, Fort Erie was by error inserted in my letter of Dec. 15.  
  
Detroit, Niagara, Oswego, Oswegatchie, Point au fer, Dutchman’s point, were not of this magnitude. The orders for evacuation, which reached General Carleton in New York, early in April, might have gone, in one month more, to the most remote of these posts: some of them might have been evacuated in a few days after, and the largest in a few weeks. Certainly they might all have been delivered, without any inconvenient speed in the operations, by the end of May, from the known facility furnished by the Lakes, and the water connecting them; or by crossing immediately over into their own Territory, and availing themselves of the Season for making new establishments there, if that was intended: or whatever time might, in event, have been necessary for their evacuation, certainly the order for it should have been given from England, and might have been given  as early as that from New York. Was any order ever given? Would not an unnecessary delay of the order, producing an equal delay in the evacuation, be an infraction of the Treaty?—Let us investigate this matter.  
On the 3rd. of August 1783, Major General Baron Steuben, by orders from General Washington, having repaired to Canada for this purpose,  
  
No. 22.  
  
wrote the letter No. 22. to General Haldimand, Governor of the Province,   
  
No. 23.  
  
and received from him the Answer of Aug. 13. No. 23. wherein he says ‘The orders I have received, direct a discontinuance of every hostile measure only’ &amp;c. and in his conference with Baron Steuben, he says expressly ‘that he had not received any orders for making the least arrangement for the evacuation of a single post.’ The orders then which might have been with him by the last of April, were unknown,   
  
No. 24.  
  
if they existed, the middle of August. See Baron Steuben’s letter No. 24.  
Again, on the 19th. of March 1784, Governor Clinton of New York, within the limits of which State some of these posts are, writes to General  
  
No:25.  
  
Haldimand the letter No. 25. and that General answering him May 10th. from Quebec, says ‘Not having had the honor to receive orders and instructions relative to withdrawing the Garrisons,’ &amp;c. fourteen months were now elapsed, and the orders not yet received, which might have been received in four.  
Again on the 12th. of July, Colonel Hull, by order from General Knox,  
  
No. 27.  
  
the Secretary at war, writes to General Haldimand the letter No. 27.  
  
No. 28.  
  
and General Haldimand gives the answer of the 13th. No. 28. wherein he says ‘Though I am now informed by his Majesty’s Ministers of the ratification, &amp;c. I remain, &amp;c. not having received any orders to evacuate the Posts which are without the limits,’ &amp;c. and this is eighteen months after the Signature of the general pacification! Now is it not fair to conclude, if the order was not arrived on the 13th. of August 1783, if it was not arrived on the 10th. of May 1784, nor yet on the 13th. of July, in the same Year, that in truth the order had never been given? And if it had never been given, may we not conclude that it never had been intended to be given?—From what moment is it we are to date this infraction? From that at which, with convenient speed, the order to evacuate the upper posts might have been given. No legitimate reason can be assigned why that order might not have been given as early, and at the same time as the order to evacuate New York: and all delay after this was in contravention of the Treaty.  
§. 28. Was this delay merely innocent and unimportant, as to us, setting aside all considerations, but of interest and safety? 1. It cut us off from the Fur-trade, which, before the war, had been always of great  importance as a branch of Commerce, and as a source of remittance for the payment of our debts to Great Britain: for to the injury of withholding our Posts, they added the obstruction of all passage along the Lakes and their communications. 2. It secluded us from connection with the North-Western Indians, from all opportunity of keeping up with them friendly and neighborly intercourse, brought on us, consequently, from their known dispositions, constant and expensive war, in which numbers of men, women and Children have been, and still are daily falling victims to the Scalping knife; and to which there will be no period, but in our possession of the Posts, which command their Country.  
It may safely be said then that the Treaty was violated in England, before it was known in America; and in America, as soon as it was known; and that too in points so essential as that, without them, it would never have been concluded.  
§.29. And what was the effect of these infractions on the American  
  
American Proceedings.  
  
mind?—On the breach of any article of a Treaty by the one party, the other has it’s election, to declare it dissolved in all it’s Articles, or to compensate itself by withholding execution of equivalent articles; or to wave notice of the Breach altogether.  
Congress being informed that the British commanding officer was carrying away the negroes from New York, in avowed violation of the Treaty, and against the repeated remonstrances of General Washington, they take up the Subject on the 26th. of May 1783; they declare that it is contrary to the Treaty; direct that the proper papers be sent to their Ministers Plenipotentiary in Europe to remonstrate and demand reparation, and that, in the meantime General Washington continue his Remonstrances to the British commanding officer, and insist  
  
No. 29.  
  
on the discontinuance of the measure. [see Document No. 29.]  
§. 30. The State of Virginia, materially affected by this infraction, because the labourers, thus carried away, were chiefly from thence, while heavy debts were now to be paid to the very nation which was depriving them of the means, took up the subject in Dec. 1783. that is to say 7. months after that particular infraction, and 4 months after the first refusal to deliver up the Posts, and, instead of arresting the debts absolutely, in reprisal, for their negroes carried away, they passed [D.5.] the act to revive and continue the several acts for suspending the issuing executions on certain judgments until Dec. 1783, that is to say, they revived till their next meeting, two acts passed during the war, which suspended all voluntary and fraudulent assignments of debt, and, as to others, allowed real and personal estate to be tendered in discharge of executions: the effect of which was to relieve the body  of the debtor from prison, by authorizing him to deliver property in discharge of the debt.—In June following 13 months after the violation last mentioned; and after a second refusal by the British commanding officer  
  
Doct No.30.  
  
to deliver up the posts, they come to the Resolution No. 30. reciting specially the infraction respecting their Negroes, instructing their Delegates in Congress to press for reparation, and resolving that the Courts shall be opened to British suits, as soon as reparation shall be made, or otherwise as soon as Congress shall judge it indispensably necessary. And in 1787, they passed [E.7.] the act to repeal so much of all and every act or acts of assembly as prohibits the recovery of British debts; and at the same time [E. 6.] the act to repeal part of an act for the protection and encouragement of the commerce of nations acknowledging the independence of the United States of America. The former was not to be in force till the evacuation of the posts and reparation for the Negroes carried away: the latter requires particular explanation.—The small supplies of European goods which reached us during the war, were frequently brought by Captains of Vessels and supercargoes, who, as soon as they had sold their goods, were to return to Europe with their Vessels. To persons under such circumstances, it was necessary to give a summary remedy for the recovery of the proceeds of their Sale. This had been done by the law for the protection and encouragement of the commerce of Nations acknowledging the independence of the United States, which was meant but as a temporary thing to continue while the same circumstances continued: On the return of Peace, the supplies of foreign Goods were made, as before the war, by Merchants resident here. There was no longer reason to continue to them the summary remedy which had been provided for the transient vendor of goods: and indeed it would have been unequal to have given the resident Merchant instantaneous judgment against a farmer or tradesman, while the farmer or tradesman could pursue those who owed him money, but in the ordinary way, and with the ordinary delays. The British creditor had no such unequal privilege while we were under British government, and had no title to it in justice, or by the Treaty, after the war. When the legislature proceeded then to repeal the law as to other nations, it would have been extraordinary to have continued it for Great Britain.  
§. 31. South Carolina was the second State which moved in consequence of the the British infractions, urged thereto by the desolated condition in which their armies had left that country, by the debts they owed, and the almost entire destruction of the means of paying them. They passed [D.7. 20.] 1784 March 26. An ordinance respecting the recovery of debts, suspending the recovery of all actions, as well American as British, for 9 months, and then allowing them to  recover payment at four equal and annual instalments only; requiring the debtor in the meantime to give good security for his debt, or otherwise refusing him the benefit of the Act, by  
[D.21.] 1787. Mar. 28. An act to regulate the recovery and payment of debts, and prohibiting the importation of Negroes, they extended the instalments a year further in a very few cases. I have not been able to procure the two following acts, [D.14.] 1785. Oct. 12. An act for regulating sales under executions, and for other purposes therein mentioned: and  
[D.22.] 1788. Nov. 4. An Act to regulate the payment and recovery of debts, and to prohibit the importation of Negroes for the time therein limited; and I know nothing of their effect, or their existence, but from your letter, which says their effect was to deliver property in execution in relief of the body of the debtor, and still further to postpone the instalments. If, during the existence of material infractions on the part of Great Britain, it were necessary to apologize for these modifications of the Proceedings of the debtor, grounds might be found in the peculiar distresses of that State, and the liberality with which they had complied with the recommendatory Articles, notwithstanding their sufferings might have inspired other dispositions, having pardoned every body, received every body, restored all confiscated lands not sold, and the prices of those sold.  
§. 32. Rhode Island next acted on the British infractions and imposed modifications in favor of such Debtors as should be pursued by their creditors, permitting them to relieve their bodies from execution by the payment of paper money, or delivery of Property. This was the effect of  
[D.12.] 1786. March, An act to enable any Debtor in Jail on execution, at the suit of any Creditor, to tender real, or certain specific Articles of personal estate, and  
[D.16.] 1786, May, An Act making paper money a legal tender. But observe that this was not till three years after the infractions by Great Britain, and repeated and constant refusals of compliance on their part.  
§. 33. New Jersey did the same thing by[D.13.] 1786. Mar. 23rd. An Act to direct the modes of proceedings on writs of fieri facias, and for transferring lands and chattels for payment of debts. And  
[D.18.] 1786. May 26. An act for striking and making current 100,000£. in Bills of credit to be let out on loan and  
[D.17.] 1786 June 1. An act for making Bills emitted by the act for raising a revenue of £31,259-5 per annum for 25 Years legal tender, and  
§. 34. Georgia by [D.19.] 1786 Aug. 14. An act for emitting the  sum of £50,000 in bills of credit, and for establishing a fund for the redemption, and for other purposes therein mentioned, made paper money also a legal tender.  
These are the only States which appear, by the acts cited in your letter, to have modified the recovery of Debts. But I believe that north Carolina also emitted a sum of paper money, and made it a tender in discharge of executions; though, not having seen the act, I cannot affirm it with certainty. I have not mentioned, because I do not view the act of Maryland [D.15.] 1786. Nov. c. 29. for the settlement of public accounts &amp;c. as a modification of the recovery of Debts. It obliged the British subject before he could recover what was due to him within the State, to give bond for the payment of what he owed therein. It is reasonable that every one, who asks justice, should do justice: and it is usual to consider the property of a foreigner in any country, as a fund appropriated to the payment of what he owes in that country exclusively. It is a care which most Nations take of their own citizens, not to let the property which is to answer their demands, be withdrawn from it’s Jurisdiction, and send them to seek it in foreign Countries, and before foreign tribunals.  
§. 35. With  
  
Instalments.  
  
respect to the obstacles thus opposed to the British creditor, besides their general justification, as being produced by the previous infractions on the part of Great Britain, each of them admits of a special apology. They are 1. Delay of Judgment. 2. Liberating the body from execution on the delivery of Property. 3. admitting executions to be discharged in paper money. As to the 1st. Let it be considered that from the nature of the commerce carried on between these States and Great Britain, they were generally kept in debt: that a great part of the country, and most particularly Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, New York, and Rhode Island, had been ravaged by an enemy, moveable property carried off, houses burnt, lands abandoned, the proprietors forced off into exile and poverty. When the peace permitted them to return again to their lands, naked and desolate as they were, was instant payment practicable? The contrary was so palpable, that the British creditors themselves were sensible that, were they to rush to judgment immediately against their debtors, it would involve the Debtor in total ruin, without relieving the Creditor. It is a fact, for which we may appeal to the knowledge of one member at least of the British administration of 1785. that the Chairman of the North American Merchants, conferring on behalf of those Merchants with the American ministers then in London, was so sensible that time was necessary, as well to save the Creditor as Debtor, that he declared there would not be a moments hesitation, on the part of the  Creditors, to allow payment by instalments annually for 7. years: and that this arrangement was not made, was neither his fault nor ours.  
To the necessities for some delay in the payment of debts, may be added, the British commercial regulations, lessening our means of payment, by prohibiting us from carrying, in our own bottoms, our own produce to their dominions in our neighborhood, and excluding valuable branches of it from their home markets by prohibitory duties. The means of payment constitute one of the motives to purchase, at the moment of purchasing. If these means are taken away, by the creditor himself, he ought not in conscience to complain of a mere retardation of his debt, which is the effect of his own act, and the least injurious of those it is capable of producing. The instalment acts before enumerated, have been much less general, and for a shorter term, than what the Chairman of the american Merchants thought reasonable. Most of them required the Debtor to give security, in the meantime to his creditor, and provided complete indemnification of the delay, by the payment of interest, which was enjoined in every case.  
§. 36.  
  
Executions paid off in property.  
  
The 2nd. species of obstacle, was, the admitting the debtor to relieve his body from imprisonment by the delivery of lands or goods to his creditor. And is this idea original, and peculiar to us? Or whence have we taken it? From England, from Europe, from natural right and reason: for it may be safely affirmed that neither natural right nor reason subjects the body of a man to restraint for debt. It is one of the abuses introduced by Commerce and credit, and which even the most commercial Nations have been obliged to relax in certain cases. The Roman Law, the principles of which are the nearest to natural reason of those of any municipal code hitherto known, allowed imprisonment of the body in criminal cases only, or those wherein the party had expressly submitted himself to it. The french Laws allow it only in criminal or commercial cases. The laws of England, in certain descriptions of cases (as Bankrupcy) release the Body. Many of the United States do the same, in all cases, on a cession of property by the debtor. The levarifacias, an execution affecting only the profits of lands, is the only one allowed in England in certain cases: The Elegit, another execution of that and this country, attaches first on a man’s chattels, which are not to be sold, but to be delivered to the pl. on a reasonable appraisement, in part of Satisfaction for his debt, and if not sufficient, one half only of his lands are then to be delivered to the plaintiff, till the profits shall have satisfied him. The tender Laws of these States were generally more favorable than the execution by elegit, because they not only gave, as that does, the whole property in  chattels, but also the whole property in the lands, and not merely the profits of them. It is therefore an execution framed on the model of the English Elegit, or rather an amendment of that writ, taking away, indeed, the election of the party against the body of his Debtor, but giving him, in exchange for it, much more complete remedy against his lands.—Let it be observed too, that this proceeding was allowed against citizens as well as foreigners: and it may be questioned whether the Treaty is not satisfied, while the same measure is dealt out to British subjects as to foreigners of all other Nations, and to natives themselves. For it would seem that all a Friend can expect is to be treated as a native citizen.  
§. 37.  
  
Executions paid in Paper money.  
  
The 3rd. Obstacle was the allowing paper money to be paid for goods sold under execution. The complaint on this head is only against Georgia, South Carolina, Jersey and Rhode Island: and this obstruction like the two others, sprung out of the peculiar nature of the war. For those will form very false conclusions, who reason, as to this war, from the circumstances which have attended other wars, and other nations. When any nation of Europe is attacked by another, it has neighbors with whom it’s accustomary commerce goes on, without interruption; and it’s commerce with more distant Nations is carried on by sea in foreign bottoms at least, under protection of the laws of Neutrality. The produce of it’s soil can be exchanged for money as usual, and the stock of that medium of circulation is not at all diminished by war; so that property sells as readily and as well, for real money, at the close, as at the commencement of the war. But how different was our case. On the North and South were our enemies: on the West, desarts inhabited by Savages in league with them: on the East, an ocean of 1,000 leagues, beyond which indeed were nations who might have purchased the produce of our soil, and have given us real money in Exchange, and thus kept up our stock of money, but who were deterred from coming to us by threats of war on the part of our enemies, if they should presume to consider us as a people intitled to partake the benefit of that law of war which allows commerce with neutral Nations. What were the consequences? The stock of hard money which we possessed in an ample degree, at the beginning of the war, soon flowed into Europe for supplies of arms, ammunition and other necessaries, which we were not in the habit of manufacturing for ourselves. The produce of our soil, attempted to be carried in our own bottoms to Europe, fell two thirds of it into the hands of our enemies, who were Masters of the Sea, the other third illy sufficed to procure the necessary implements of war, so that no returns of money supplied the place of that which had gone off. We were reduced then to the resource of a paper medium, and  that completed the exile of the hard money; so that, in the latter stages of the war, we were for years together without seeing a single coin of the precious metals in circulation. It was closed with a stipulation that we should pay a large mass of debt in such coin. If the whole soil of the United States had been offered for sale for ready coin, it would not have raised as much as would have satisfied this stipulation. The thing then was impossible; and reason and authority declare ‘Si l’empechement est reel, il faut donner du tems; car nul n’est tenu à l’impossible.’ Vattel L. 4. §. 51. We should with confidence have referred the case to the Arbiter proposed by another Jurist, who lays it down that a party ‘Non ultra obligari, quam in quantum facere potest; et an possit, permittendum alterius principis, qua boni viri, arbitrio.’ Bynk. Q. J. P. L. 2. c. 10. §. Quid. That four of the States should resort, under such circumstances, to very small emissions of paper money, is not wonderful: that all did not, proves their firmness under sufferance, and that they were disposed to bear whatever could be borne rather than contravene, even by way of equivalent, stipulations which had been authoritatively entered into for them. And even in the four States which emitted paper money, it was in such small sums, and so secured as to suffer only a shortlived and not great depreciation of value; nor did they continue it’s quality as a tender, after the first paroxysms of distress were over.—Here too it is to be observed that Natives were to receive this species of payment, equally with British subjects.  
So that when it is considered that the other party had broken the Treaty from the beginning, and that too in points which lessened our ability to pay their Debts, it was a proof of the moderation of our Nation to make no other use of the opportunity of retaliation presented to them, than to indulge the Debtors with that time for discharging their Debts which their distresses called for, and the interests and the reason of their Creditors approved.  
§. 38.  
  
Interposition of Congress.  
  
It is to be observed that during all this time, Congress, who alone possessed the power of Peace and War, of making Treaties, and, consequently, of declaring their infractions, had abstained from every public declaration, and had confined itself to the resolution of May 26. 1783, and to repeated efforts through their Minister plenipotentiary at the court of London, to lead that Court into a compliance on their part, and reparation of the Breach they had committed. But the other party now laid hold of those very proceedings of our States which their previous infractions had produced, as a ground for further refusal, and inverting the natural order of cause and effect, alledged that these proceedings of ours were the causes of the infractions which they had committed Months and Years before. Thus the British Minister for foreign Affairs, in his answer of Feb.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

 28. 1786, to Mr. Adams’s  Memorial, says ‘The engagements entered into by Treaty ought to be mutual and equally binding on the respective contracting parties. It would, therefore, be the height of folly, as well as injustice, to suppose one party alone obliged to a strict observance of the public faith, while the other might remain free to deviate from it’s own engagements, as often as convenience might render such deviation necessary, though at the expense of it’s own national credit and importance. I flatter myself however, Sir, that Justice will speedily be done to British creditors; and I can assure you, Sir, that whenever America shall manifest a real intention to fulfil her part of the Treaty, Great Britain will not hesitate to prove her sincerity, to cooperate in whatever points depend upon her for carrying every article of it into real and complete effect.’ Facts will furnish the best commentary on this letter. Let us pursue them.  
The Secretary for foreign affairs of the United States, by order of Congress, immediately wrote circular letters to the Governors of the several  
  
No. 31.  
  
States, dated May 3rd. 1786 [No. 31.] to obtain information how far they had complied with the Proclamation of Jan. 14. 1784. and the RECOMMENDATION accompanying it; and April 13. 1787. Congress, desirous of removing every pretext which might continue to cloak the inexecution of the Treaty, wrote a circular letter to the several States, in which, in order to produce more surely the effect desired, they demonstrate that Congress alone possess the right of interpreting, restraining, impeding, or counteracting the operation and execution of treaties, which, on being constitutionally made, become, by the Confederation, a part of the law of the land, and as such, independent of the will and power of the legislatures: that, in this point of view, the state acts, establishing provisions relative to the same objects, and incompatible with it, must be improper: resolving that all such acts now existing ought to be forthwith repealed, as well to prevent their continuing to be regarded as violations of the Treaty, as to avoid the disagreeable necessity of discussing their validity; recommending, in order to obviate all future disputes and questions, that every state, as well those which had passed no such acts, as those which had, should pass an act, repealing in general terms, all acts and parts of acts repugnant to the Treaty, and encouraging them to do this, by informing them that they had the strongest assurances that an exact compliance with the treaty on our part, would be followed by a punctual performance of it on the part of Great Britain.  
§. 39.  
  
State acts of acquiescnce. No.32.33.34.35.36.37.38.39.40.  
  
In consequence of these letters New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, passed the acts No: 32.33.34.35.36.37.38.39.40. New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared  that no law existed with them repugnant to the Treaty [see Documents  
  
No. 41.42.43.  
  
41.42.43]. Georgia had no law existing against the Treaty. South Carolina, indeed, had a law existing, which subjected all persons   
  
No. 44.  
  
foreign or native [No. 44.] to certain modifications of recovery and payment. But the liberality of her conduct on the other points, is a proof she would have conformed in this also, had it appeared that the fullest conformity would have moved Great Britain to compliance, and had an express repeal been really necessary.  
§. 40.  
  
Treaties controul Laws.  
  
For indeed all this was supererogation. It resulted from the instrument of Confederation among the States that TREATIES made by Congress according to the Confederation were SUPERIOR to the LAWS of the States. The circular letter of Congress had declared and demonstrated it, and the several States, by their acts and explanations before mentioned had shewn it to be their own sense, as we may safely affirm it to have been the general sense of those, at least, who were of the profession of the law. Besides the proofs of this, drawn from the act of Confederation itself, the declaration of Congress, and the acts of the States beforementioned, the same principle will be found acknowledged in several of the Documents hereto annexed for other purposes.   
  
No.20.  
  
Thus in Rhode Island, Governor Collins, in his letter No. 20. says ‘The treaty, in all it’s absolute parts, has been fully complied with, and to those parts that are merely recommendatory, and depend upon the legislative discretion, the most candid attention hath been paid,’ plainly implying that the absolute parts did not depend upon the legislative discretion. Mr. Channing, the Attorney for the United States in   
  
No.19.  
  
that State No. 19. speaking of an act passed before the Treaty, says ‘This act was considered by our Courts as annulled by the Treaty of Peace, and subsequent to the ratification thereof, no proceedings have been   
  
No.18.  
  
had thereon.’ The Governor of Connecticut in his letter No. 18. says ‘The VIth. Article of the Treaty was immediately observed on receiving the same with the proclamation of Congress, the Courts of Justice adopted it as a principle of law. No further prosecutions were instituted against any person who came within that Article and all such prosecutions as were then pending, were discontinued.’ Thus prosecutions going on under a law of the State, were discontinued by the Treaty operating as a repeal of the law. In Pennsylvania, Mr. Lewis,   
  
No.60.  
  
Attorney for the United States, says in his letter No. 60. ‘The Judges have uniformly, and without hesitation declared in favor of the Treaty, on the ground of it’s being the supreme law of the land. On this ground, they have not only discharged attainted Traitors from Arrests, but have frequently declared that they were entitled by the Treaty to protection.’ The case of the Commonwealth v. Gordon Jan.  1788, Dallas’s Rep. 233. is a proof of this. In Maryland, in the case of Mildred v. Dorsey, cited in your letter E.4. a law of the State, made during the war, had compelled those who owed debts to British subjects, to pay them into the treasury of that State. This had been done by Dorsey before the date of the Treaty, yet the Judges of the State General court decided that the treaty not only repealed the law for the future, but for the past also, and decreed that the def. should pay the money over again to the British Creditor. In Virginia, Mr. Monroe, one of the Senators of that State in Congress, and a Lawyer of  
  
No.52.  
  
eminence, tells us No. 52, that both court and counsel there avowed the opinion that the treaty would controul any law of the State opposed to it. And the legislature itself, in an act of October 1787. c. 36, concerning monies carried into the public Loan Office, in payment of British debts, use these expressions, ‘And whereas it belongs not to the legislature to decide particular questions, of which the judiciary have cognizance, and it is therefore unfit for them to determine whether the payments so made into the loan office be good or void between the Creditor and Debtor.’ In New York Mr. Harrison, Attorney for the United   
  
No.45.  
  
States in that District, assures us No. 45 that the act of 1782, of that State, relative to debts due to persons within the enemy’s lines, was, immediately after the Treaty, restrained by the Superiour courts of the State, from operating on British Creditors, and that he did not know a single instance to the contrary: a full proof that they considered the Treaty as a law of the land paramount the law of their State.  
§. 41. The very case of Rutgers v. Wadington [E.8.] which is a subject of complaint in your letter, is a proof that the courts consider the Treaty as paramount the laws of the States. Some parts of your information, as to that case, have been inexact. The State of New York had, during the war, passed an act [C. 16.] declaring that in any action by the proprietor of a house or tenement against the occupant for rent or damage, no military order should be a justification: and May 4th. 1784. after the refusal of the British to deliver up the Posts in the State of New York, that legislature revived the same act [C. 19.]. Wadington, a British subject had occupied a Brew-house in New York, belonging to Rutgers, an American, while the British were in possession of New York. During a part of the time he had only permission from the Quarter master General: for another part he had an order of the Commanding officer to authorize his possession. After the evacuation of the city, Rutgers, under the authority of this law of the State, brought an action against Wadington for rent and damages, in the Mayor’s court of New York. Wadington pleaded the Treaty, and the Court declared the Treaty a justification, in opposition  to the law of the State, for that portion of the time authorized by the commanding officer, his authority being competent: and gave judgment for that part, in favor of the defendant. But for the Time he held the house under permission of the Quarter master General only, they gave judgment against the defendant, considering the permission of that Officer as incompetent, according to the regulations of the existing power. From this part of the Judgment the def. appealed. The first part, however, was an unequivocal decision of the superior Authority of the Treaty over the law. The latter part could only have been founded in an opinion of the sense of the Treaty in that part of the VIth. Article which declares ‘There shall be no future prosecutions against any person for the part he may have taken in the war, and that no person should on that account suffer any future loss or damage in their property,’ &amp;c. They must have understood this as only protecting actions which were conformable with the laws and authority existing at the time and place. The tenure of the def. under the Quarter master General was not so conformable. That under the commanding Officer was. Some may think that Murders, and other crimes and offences, characterised as such by the Authority of the time and place where committed, were meant to be protected by this paragraph of the Treaty: and perhaps, for peace sake, this construction may be the most convenient. The Mayor’s Court, however, seems to have revolted at it. The def. appealed, and the Question would have been authoritatively decided by the superior Court, had not an amicable compromise taken place  
  
NO. 46.  
  
between the parties. See Mr. Hamilton’s statement of this case No: 46.  
§. 42. The same kind of doubt brought on the arrest of John Smith Hatfield in New Jersey, whose case [E.9.] is another ground of complaint in your letter. A refugee, sent out by the British as a Spy, was taken within the American lines, regularly tried by a Court Martial, found guilty, and executed. There was one Ball, an inhabitant of the American part of Jersey, who, contrary to the laws of his Country, was in the habit of secretly supplying the British camp in Staten Island with Provisions. The first time Ball went over, after the execution of the Spy, of which it does not appear he had any knowledge, and certainly no agency in his prosecution, John Smith Hatfeild, a refugee also from Jersey, and some others of the same description, seized him, against the express orders of the British commanding officer, brought him out of the British lines, and Hatfeild hung him with his own hands. The British Officer sent a message to the Americans disavowing this act, declaring that the British had nothing to do with it, and that those who had perpetrated the crime ought alone to suffer for it.  The right to punish the guilty individual seems to have been yielded by the one party, and accepted by the other in exchange for that of retaliation on an innocent person; an exchange which humanity would wish to see habitual. The criminal came afterwards into the very neighborhood, a member of which he had murdered. Peace indeed had now been made, but the magistrate, thinking, probably, that it was for the honest Soldier and Citizen only, and not for the Murderer, and supposing with the mayor’s Court of New York, that the paragraph of the Treaty against future prosecutions meant to cover authorized acts only, and not Murders and other atrocities, disavowed by the existing authority, arrested Hatfeild. At the Court which met for his Trial, the witnesses failed to attend. The Court released the criminal from confinement, on his giving the Security required by law for his appearance at another Court. He fled: and you say that ‘As his friends doubted the disposition of the Court to determine according to the terms of the Treaty, they thought it more prudent to suffer the forfeiture of the recognizances, than to put his life again into jeopardy.’ But your information in this, Sir, has not been exact. The recognizances are not forfeited. His friends, confident in the opinion of their counsel and the integrity of the Judges, have determined to plead the Treaty, and not even give themselves the trouble of asking a release from the legislature: and the case is now depending. See the letter of Mr. Boudinot, member  
  
NO.47.  
  
of Congress for Jersey No.47.  
§. 43. In Georgia, Judge Walton, in a charge to a Grand Jury, says  
  
see Georgia Gaz. Aug.7. 1790.  
  
‘The State of Rhode Island having acceded to the Federal Constitution, the Union and Government have become complete.—To comprehend the extent of the General Government, and to discern the relation between that and those of the States, will be equally our interest and duty. The Constitution, laws, and Treaties of the Union are paramount.’ And in the same State, in their last federal circuit court, we learn from the public papers that in a case wherein the plaintiffs were Brailsford and others, British subjects, whose debts had been sequestered (not confiscated) by an act of the State during the war, the Judges declared the Treaty of peace a repeal of the act of the State, and gave Judgment for the Plaintiffs.  
§. 44.  
  
Judicatures vindicated.  
  
The integrity of these opinions and Proceedings of the several courts should have shielded them from the insinuations hazarded against them. In pa. 9. and 10. it is said ‘That, during the War, the legislatures passed laws to confiscate the estates of the Loyalists, to enable debtors to pay into the State Treasuries paper money, then exceedingly depreciated in discharge of their debts.’ And pa. 24. ‘The dispensations of law by the State Courts, have been as unpropitious to the  subjects of the Crown as the legislative acts of the different assemblies.’ Let us compare, if you please, Sir, these unpropitious opinions of our State courts with those of foreign lawyers writing on the same subject. ‘Quod dixi de actionibus recte publicandis, ita demum obtinet, se, quod subditi nostri hostibus nostris debent, Princeps a subditis suis revera exegerit. Si exegerit, recte solutum est; si non exegerit, pace facta, reviviscit juspristinum creditoris.’—‘Secundum haec inter gentes fere convenit, ut nominibus bello publicatis, pace deinde factâ, exacta censeantur perisse, et maneant extincta; non autem exacta reviviscant et restituantur veris creditoribus.’ Bynk. Quest. J.P.L. 1. c. 7. But what said the Judges of the State court of Maryland, in the case of Mildred and Dorsey? That a debt, forced from an American debtor into the Treasury of his sovereign, is not extinct, but shall be paid over again to his British creditor. Which is most propitious, the unbiassed foreign Jurist, or the American Judge charged with dispensing justice with favor and partiality? But from this you say there is an appeal. Is that the fault of the Judge, or the fault of any body? Is there a country on earth, or ought there to be one, allowing no appeal from the first Errors of their courts? And if allowed from errors, how will those from just judgments be prevented? In England, as in other countries, an appeal is admitted to the party thinking himself injured; and here had the judgment been against the British creditor, and an appeal denied, there would have been better cause of complaint than for not having denied it to his adversary. If an illegal judgment be ultimately rendered on the appeal, then will arise the right to question it’s propriety.  
§. 45. Again it is said pa. 34. ‘In one State the Supreme federal court has thought proper to suspend for many months the final Judgment on an action of debt, brought by a british Creditor.’ If by the Supreme federal Court be meant the Supreme court of the United States, I have had their records examined in order to know what may be the case here alluded to; and I am authorized to say there neither does nor ever did exist any cause, before that Court, between a British subject and a citizen of the United States. See the certificate of the Clerk of the  
  
No.48.  
  
Court. No: 48. If by the Supreme federal court, be meant one of the Circuit courts of the United States, then which Circuit, in which State, and what case is meant? In the course of inquiries I have been obliged to make, to find whether there exists any case, in any district of any circuit court of the United States, which might have given rise to this complaint, I have learnt that an action was brought to issue and argued in the circuit Court of the United States in Virginia at their last term, between Jones a British subject pl. and Walker an American  def. wherein the question was the same as in the case of Mildred and Dorsey, to wit, Whether a payment into the Treasury, during the war, under a law of the State, discharged the Debtor? One of the Judges retiring from Court in the midst of the argument, on the accident of the death of an only Son, and the case being primae impressionis in that Court, it was adjourned for consideration till the ensuing term. Had the two remaining Judges felt no motive but of predilection to one of the parties had they considered only to which party their wishes were propitious, or unpropitious, they possibly might have decided that question on the spot. But learned enough in their Science to see difficulties which escape others, and having characters and consciences to satisfy, they followed the example so habitually and so laudably set by the Courts of your country, and of every country where law, and not favor, is the rule of decision, of taking time to consider. Time and consideration are favorable to the right cause, precipitation to the wrong one.  
§. 46. You say again pa. 29. ‘The few attempts to recover British debts in the county Courts of Virginia have universally failed; and these are the Courts wherein from the smallness of the sum, a considerable number of debts can only be recovered.’ and again pa. 34. ‘In the same State, the county Courts (which alone can take cognizance of debts of limited amount) have uniformly rejected all suits instituted for the recovery of Sums due to the subjects of the Crown of Great Britain.’ In the 1st. place, the county courts, till of late, have had exclusive jurisdiction only of sums below £10. and it is known that a very inconsiderable proportion of the British debt consists in demands below that Sum. A late law, we are told, requires that actions below £30. shall be commenced in those courts; but allows at the same time an appeal to correct any errors into which they may fall. In the 2d. place, the evidence of Gentlemen who are in the way of knowing the fact,  
  
No. 52. 53.  
  
[No. 52. 53.] is that, though there have been accidental checks in some of the subordinate Courts, arising from the chicanery of the debtors, and sometimes, perhaps, a moment of error in the Court itself, yet these particular instances have been immediately rectified either in the same, or the superior court, while the great mass of Suits for the recovery of Sums due to the subjects of the Crown of Great Britain have been uniformly sustained to judgment and execution.  
§. 47. A much broader assertion is hazarded pa. 29. ‘In some of the Southern States, there does not exist a single instance of the recovery of a British debt in their courts, tho’ many years have expired since the establishment of peace between the two Countries.’ The particular States are not specified. I have therefore thought it my duty to extend  my inquiries to all the States which could be designated under the description of Southern, to wit, Maryland, and those to the South of that.  
As to Maryland, the joint certificate of the Senators and Delegates of the  
  
No. 49. 50. 51.  
  
State in Congress, the letter of Mr. Tilghman, a Gentleman of the law in the same State, and that of Mr. Gwinn Clerk of their General Court, prove that British suits have been maintained in the Superior and inferior Courts throughout the State without any obstruction, that British claimants have, in every instance, enjoyed every facility in the tribunals of Justice, equally with their own citizens, and have recovered in due course of law, and remitted large debts, as well under contracts previous, as subsequent, to the war.  
In Virginia, the letters of Mr. Monroe and Mr. Giles members of Congress  
  
No. 52. 53.  
  
from that State, and lawyers of eminence in it, prove that the Courts of law in that State have been open and freely resorted to by the British Creditors, who have recovered and levied their monies without obstruction: for we have no right to consider as obstructions the dilatory pleas of here and there a debtor, distressed perhaps for time, or even an accidental error of opinion in a subordinate court, where such pleas have been overruled, and such errors corrected in a due course of proceeding marked out by the laws in such cases. The general fact suffices to shew that the assertion under examination cannot be applied to this State.  
In North Carolina, Mr. Johnston, one of the Senators for that State, tells us he has heard indeed but of few suits brought by British creditors in that State: but that he never heard that any one had failed of a recovery, because he was a British subject; and he names a particular case of Elmesly v. Lee’s executors ‘of the recovery of a British debt  
  
No.54.  
  
in the Superior court at Edenton.’ See Mr. Johnston’s letter No. 54.  
In  
  
No. 55.  
  
South Carolina we learn from No. 55. of particular judgments rendered, and prosecutions carried on, without obstacle, by British creditors, and that the Courts are open to them there as elsewhere. As to the modifications of the execution heretofore made by the State law, having been the same for foreigner and citizen, a court would decide whether the Treaty is satisfied by this equal measure; and if the British creditor is privileged by that against even the same modifications to which citizens and foreigners of all other nations were equally subjected, then the law imposing them was a mere nullity.  
In  
  
No. 56.  
  
Georgia, the letter of the Senators and Representatives in Congress, No. 56. assures us that tho’ they do not know of any recovery of a British debt in their State, neither do they know of a denial to  recover since the ratification of the Treaty; the creditors having mostly preferred amicable settlement; and that the federal Court is open and unobstructed to British creditors there, as in any other of the United States; and this is further proved by the late recovery of Brailsford and others before cited.  
§. 48. You say more particularly of that State pa. 25. ‘It is to be lamented, that in a more distant State (Georgia) it was a received principle, inculcated by an opinion of the highest judicial Authority there, that as no legislative act of the State existed, confirming the Treaty of Peace with Great Britain, war still continued between the two countries; a principle which may, perhaps, still continue in that state.’ No Judge, no case, no time, is named. Imputations on the Judiciary of a country are too serious to be neglected. I have thought it my duty therefore to spare no endeavors to find on what fact this censure was meant to be affixed. I have

xpected that some more specific arrangements, as to the manner of liquidating, and times of paying British debts would have been settled in the Definitive   
  
No. 58.  
  
Treaty. No. 58 shews that such arrangements were under contemplation. And the Judge seems to have been of opinion that it was necessary the Treaty should be definitively concluded, before it could become a law of the land, so as to change the legal character of an alien enemy, who cannot maintain an action, into that of an alien friend, who may. Without entering into the question, Whether, between the Provisional and Definitive Treaties, a subject of either party could maintain an action in the Courts of the other, (a question of no consequence, considering how short the interval was, and this, probably, the only action essayed) we must admit that if the Judge was right in his opinion, that a definitive conclusion was necessary, he was right in his consequence that it should be made known to the legislature of the State, or in other words to the State, and that, till that notification, it was not a law authorizing a subject of England to sue a Citizen of that State. The subsequent doctrine of the same Judge Walton, with respect to treaties, when duly completed, that they are paramount the laws of the several States, as has been seen in his charge  to a Grand Jury before spoken of (§.43.) will relieve your doubts whether the ‘principle still continues in that State of the continuance of war between the two Countries.’  
§. 49. The latter part of the quotation before made, merits notice also; to wit, where, after saying not a single instance exists of the recovery of a British debt, it is added, ‘Though many years have expired since the establishment of Peace between the two Countries.’ It is evident from the preceding testimony, that many Suits have been brought, and with effect: yet it has often been matter of surprize that more were not brought, and earlier, since it is most certain that the Courts would have sustained their actions, and given them Judgments. This abstinence on the part of the creditors has excited a suspicion that they wished rather to recur to the Treasury of their own Country; and, to have colour for this, they would have it believed that there were obstructions here to the bringing their Suits. Their testimony is in fact the sole, to which your court, till now, has given access. Had the opportunity now presented, been given us sooner, they should sooner have known that the Courts of the United States, whenever the Creditors would chuse that resource, and would press, if necessary, to the highest tribunals, would be found as open to their suits, and as impartial to their subjects, as theirs to ours.  
§. 50.  
  
Popular Interference.  
  
There is an expression in your letter pa. 7. That ‘British creditors have not been countenanced or supported either by the respective legislatures, or by the State courts, in their endeavors to recover the full value of debts contracted antecedently to the Treaty of Peace.’ And again in pa. 8. ‘In many of the States, the subjects of the Crown, in endeavoring to obtain the restitution of their forfeited Estates and Property, have been treated with indignity.’ From which an inference might be drawn, which I am sure you did not intend, to wit, that the Creditors have been deterred from resorting to the Courts by popular tumults, and not protected by the laws of the Country. I recollect to have heard of one or two attempts by popular collections, to deter the prosecution of British claims. One of these is mentioned in No. 49. but these were immediately on the close of the war, while it’s passions had not yet had time to subside, and while the ashes of our houses were still smoaking. Since that, say for many years past, nothing like popular interposition on this subject, has been heard of in any part of our land. There is no country, which is not sometimes subject to irregular interpositions of the people. There is no country able at all times to punish them. There is no country which has less of this to reproach itself with than the United States, nor any where the laws have a more regular course, or are more habitually and cheerfully  acquiesced in. Confident that your own observation and information will have satisfied you of this Truth, I rely that the inference was not intended, which seems to result from these expressions.  
§. 51.  
  
Present state of debt.  
  
Some notice is to be taken as to the great deficiencies in collection urged on behalf of the British Merchants. The course of our commerce with Great Britain was ever for the Merchant there to give his correspondent here a year’s credit: so that we were regularly indebted from a Year to a Year and a half’s amount of our exports. It is the opinion of judicious Merchants that it never exceeded the latter term, and that it did not exceed the former at the commencement of the war. Let the holders then of this debt be classed into 1st. Those who were insolvent at that time. 2nd. Those solvent then, who became insolvent during the operations of the war, a numerous Class. 3rd. Those solvent at the close of the war, but insolvent now. 4th. Those solvent at the close of the war, who have since paid or settled satisfactorily with their Creditors, a numerous class also. 5th. Those solvent then and now, who have neither paid, nor made satisfactory arrangements with their Creditors. This last class, the only one now in question, is little numerous, and the amount of their debts but a moderate proportion of the aggregate which was due at the commencement of the war; insomuch that it is the opinion that we do not owe to Great Britain, at this moment of sperate Debts, old and new, more than a Year, or a Year and a quarter’s exports, the ordinary amount of the debt resulting from the common course of dealings.  
§. 52. In  
  
Recrimination on British courts.  
  
drawing a comparison between the proceedings of Great Britain and the United States, you say pa. 35. ‘The conduct of Great Britain, in all these respects, has been widely different from that which has been observed by the United States. In the Courts of law of the former country, the citizens of the United States have experienced without exception the same protection and impartial distribution of Justice as the subjects of the Crown.’ No nation can answer for perfect exactitude of proceedings in all their inferior courts. It suffices to provide a Supreme Judicature, where all error and partiality will be ultimately corrected. With this qualification, we have heretofore been in the habit of considering the administration of Justice in Great Britain as extremely pure. With the same qualification, we have no fear to risk every thing which a nation holds dear on the assertion, that the administration of Justice here will be found equally pure. When the citizens of either party complain of the judiciary proceedings of the other, they naturally present but one side of the case to view, and are, therefore, to be listened to with caution. Numerous condemnations have taken place in your courts, of vessels taken from us, after the  expirations of the terms of one and two months stipulated in the armistice. The State of Maryland has been making ineffectual efforts for nine Years, to recover a Sum of £55,000 sterling, lodged in the Bank of England previous to the war. A Judge of the King’s Bench, lately declared in the case of Greene an American citizen v. Buchanan &amp; Charnock, British subjects, that a citizen of the United States, who has delivered £43,000 sterling worth of East India goods to a British subject at Ostend, receiving only £18,000 in part payment, is not entitled to maintain an action for the Balance in a court of Great Britain, though his debtor is found there, is in custody of the court, and acknowledges the Facts. These cases appear strong to us. If your Judges have done wrong in them, we expect redress. If right, we expect explanations. Some of them, have already been laid before your court. The others will be so in due time. These, and such as these, are the smaller matters between the two nations, which, in my letter of Dec. 15. I had the honor to intimate that it would be better to refer for settlement through the ordinary channel of our ministers, than embarrass the present important discussions with them. Such cases will be constantly produced by a collision of interests in the dealings of individuals, and will be easily adjusted by a readiness to do right on both sides, regardless of party.  
§. 53. It  
  
III. Interest.  
  
is made an objection to the proceedings of our legislative and judiciary bodies that they have refused to allow Interest to run on debts during the course of the war. The decision of the right to this rests with the Judiciary alone; neither the legislature nor the executive having any authority to intermeddle.  
The administration of Justice is a branch of the Sovereignty over a country, and belongs exclusively to the Nation inhabiting it. No foreign power can pretend to participate in their Jurisdiction, or that their citizens received there, are not subject to it. When a cause has been adjudged according to the rules and forms of the country, it’s justice ought to be presumed. Even error in the highest court, which has been provided as the last means of correcting the errors of others, and whose decrees are therefore subject to no further revisal, is one of those inconveniencies flowing from the imperfection of our faculties, to which every Society must submit: because there must be somewhere a last resort, wherein contestations may end. Multiply Bodies of revisal as you please, their number must still be finite, and they must finish in the hands of fallible men as Judges. If the error be evident, palpable, et in re minime dubiâ, it there indeed assumes another form, it excites presumption that it was not mere error, but premeditated wrong, and the foreigner, as well as native, suffering by the wrong, may  reasonably complain, as for a wrong committed in any other way. In such case, there being no redress in the ordinary forms of the country, a foreign Prince may listen to complaint from his Subjects injured by the adjudication, may inquire into it’s principles to prove their criminality, and, according to the magnitude of the wrong, take his measures of redress by reprisal, or by a refusal of right on his part. If the denial of Interest, in our case, be justified by law, or even if it be against law, but not in that gross, evident, and palpable degree, which proves it to flow from the wickedness of the Heart, and not error of the Head in the Judges, then is it no cause for just complaint, much less for a refusal of right, or self-redress in any other way. The reasons on which the denial of interest is grounded, shall be stated summarily, yet sufficiently to justify the integrity of the Judge, and even to induce a presumption that they might be extended to that of his Science also, were that material to the present object.  
§. 54. The Treaty is the text of the law in the present case, and it’s words are that there shall be no lawful impediment to the recovery of bonâ fide Debts. Nothing is said of Interest on those debts: and the sole question is Whether, where a Debts is given, Interest thereon flows from the general principles of the Law? Interest is not a part of the debt, but something added to the debt by way of damage for the detention of it. This is the definition of the English lawyers themselves, who say ‘Interest is recovered by way of damages, ratione detentionis debiti.’ 2 Salk. 622. 623. Formerly all interest was considered as unlawful, in every Country of Europe: it is still so in Roman catholic Countries, and Countries little commercial. From this, as a general rule, a few special cases are excepted. In France particularly the exceptions are those of minors, marriage-portions, and money, the price of lands. So thoroughly do their laws condemn the allowance of Interest, that a party who has paid it voluntarily, may recover it back again whenever he pleases. Yet this has never been taken up as a gross and flagrant denial of Justice, authorizing national complaint against those Governments. In England also, all interest was against law, till the Stat. 37. H.8. c.9. The growing spirit of commerce no longer restrained by the principles of the Roman church then first began to tolerate it. The same causes produced the same effect in Holland, and, perhaps, in some other commercial and acatholic countries. But even in England, the allowance of interest is not given by express law but rests on the discretion of Judges and Juries, as the arbiters of damages. Sometimes the Judge has enlarged the Interest to 20 per cent per annum (1. Chanc. Rep. 57) in other cases he fixes it habitually, one per cent lower than the legal rate (2. Tr. Atk. 343.) and in a multitude of cases he refuses it altogether. As for instance, no Interest is allowed,  
  
1. On arrears of rents, profits, or annuities (1. Chanc. rep. 184. 2. P. W. 163. ca. temp. Talbot. 2.)  
2. For maintenance, Vin. abr. Interest. c. 10.  
3. For monies advanced by Exrs. 2. Abr. eq. 531.15.  
4. For goods sold and delivered. 3. Wilson. 206.  
5. On book debts, open accounts, or simple contracts. 3. Chan. rep. 64. Freem. Ch. rep. 133. Dougl. 376.  
6. For money lent without a note. 2. Stra. 910.  
7. On an inland Bill of Exchange, if no protest is taken. 2. Stra. 910.  
8. On a Bond after 20. Years. 2. Vern. 458, or after a tender.  
9. On decrees, in certain cases. Freem. Ch. rep. 181.  
10. On judgments in certain cases, as battery and slander. Freem. Ch. rep. 37.  
11. On any decrees or judgments in certain Courts, as the Exchequer chamber. Douglass 752.  
12. On costs. 2. Abr. eq. 530.7.  
And we may add, once for all, that there is no instrument or title to debt so formal and sacred, as to give a right to interest on it under all possible circumstances. The words of Lord Mansfeild, Dougl. 753. where he says ‘That the question was what was to be the rule for assessing the damage, and that, in this case, the Interest ought to be the measure of the damage, the action being for a debt, but that in a case of another sort, the rule might be different:’ His words Dougl. 376. ‘That Interest might be payable in cases of delay ‘If a Jury, in their discretion shall think fit to allow it.’ And the doctrine in Giles v. Hart 2. Salk 622. that damages, or interest, are but an accessary to the debt, which may be barred by circumstances, which do not touch the debt itself, suffice to prove that interest is not a part of the debt, neither comprehended in the thing, nor in the term, that words, which pass the debt, do not give interest necessarily, that the interest depends altogether on the discretion of the Judges and Jurors, who will govern themselves by all existing circumstances, will take the legal interest for the measure of their damages, or more, or less, as they think right, will give it from the date of the contract, or from a year after, or deny it altogether, according as the fault or the sufferings of the one or the other party shall dictate. Our laws are, generally, an adoption of yours; and I do not know that any of the States have changed them in this particular. But there is one rule of your and our law, which, while it proves that every title of debt is liable to a disallowance of Interest under special circumstances, is so applicable to our case, that I shall cite it as a text, and apply to it the circumstances of our case. It is laid down in Vin. Abr. Interest c. 7. and 2. Abr. eq. 529.3; and elsewhere in these words. ‘Where, by a general and national calamity,  nothing is made out of Lands, which are assigned for payment of interest, it ought not to run on during the time of such calamity.’ This is exactly the case in question. Can a more general national calamity be conceived than that universal devastation, which took place in many of these States during the war? Was it ever more exactly the case any where, that nothing was made out of the lands, which were to pay the Interest? The produce of those lands, for want of the opportunity of exporting it safely, was down to almost nothing in real money. e.g. Tobacco was less than a dollar the hundred weight. Imported articles of Clothing or Consumption, were from 4. to 8. times their usual price. A Bushel of Salt was usually sold for 100 ℔. of Tobacco. At the same time these lands, and other property, in which the money of the British creditor was vested, were paying high taxes for their own protection, and the debtor, as nominal holder, stood ultimate insurer of their value to the creditor, who was the real proprietor, because they were bought with his money. And who will estimate the value of this insurance, or say what would have been the forfeit, in a contrary event of the war? Who will say that the risk of the Property was not worth the interest of it’s price?—General calamity then prevented profit, and consequently stopped interest, which is in lieu of profit. The creditor says indeed he has laid out of his money; he has therefore lost the use of it. The Debtor replies that if the creditor has lost, he has not gained it: that this may be a question between two parties, both of whom have lost. In that case the courts will not double the loss of the one, to save all loss from the other. That it is a rule of natural, as well as municipal, law, that, in questions de damno evitando, melior est conditio possidentis.—If this maxim be just, where each party is equally innocent, how much more so, where the loss has been produced by the act of the Creditor? For a nation as a Society, forms a moral person, and every member of it is personally responsible for his Society. It was the act of the lender, or of his nation which annihilated the profits of the money lent; he cannot then demand profits which he either prevented from coming into existence, or burnt or otherwise destroyed after they were produced. If then, there be no instrument or title of debt so formal and sacred as to give right to interest under all possible circumstances, and if circumstances of exemption, stronger than in the present case, cannot possibly be found, then no instrument or title of debt, however formal or sacred, can give right to interest under the circumstances of our case. Let us present the question in another point of view. Your own law forbade the payment of Interest when it forbade the receipt of American produce into Great Britain, and made that produce fair prize on it’s way from the debtor to the  creditor, or to any other for his use or reimbursement. All personal access between creditor and debtor was made illegal: and the debtor, who endeavored to make a remitment of his debt, or interest, must have done it three times, to ensure it’s getting once to hand: for two out of three vessels were generally taken by the creditor nation, and sometimes by the Creditor himself, as many of them turned their trading vessels into Privateers. Where no place has been agreed on for the payment of a debt, the laws of England oblige the Debtor to seek his Creditor wheresoever he is to be found within the Realm. Coke Lit. 210. b. but do not bind him to go out of the Realm in search of him. This is our law too. The first act, generally of the Creditors and their Agents here, was, to withdraw from the United States with their books and papers. The creditor thus withdrawing from his debtor, so as to render payment impossible, either of the principal or interest, makes it like the common case of a tender and refusal of money, after which interest stops both by your laws and ours.  
  
No. 57  
  
We see too, from the letter of Mr. Adams, June 16. 1786. No. 57. that the British Secretary for foreign affairs was sensible, that a British statute having rendered criminal all intercourse between the debtor and creditor, had placed the article of Interest on a different footing from the Principal. And the letter of our Plenipotentiaries to Mr. Hartley, the British Plenipotentiary for forming the Definitive Treaty  
  
No. 58  
  
No. 58. shews that the omission to express interest in the Treaty was not merely an oversight of the Parties; that it’s allowance was considered by our Plenipotentiaries as a thing not to be intended in the Treaty, was declared against by Congress, and that declaration communicated to Mr. Hartley. After such an explanation, the omission is a proof of acquiescence, and an intention not to claim it.—It appears then, that the Debt and Interest on that Debt, are separate things in every country, and under separate rules. That in every country a debt is recoverable, while, in most countries, interest is refused in all cases; in others, given, or refused, diminished, or augmented, at the discretion of the Judge; no where given in all cases indiscriminately, and, consequently, no where so incorporated with the debt, as to pass with that ex vi termini, or otherwise to be considered as a determinate and vested Thing.  
While the taking interest on money has thus been considered in some countries as morally wrong in all cases, in others made legally right but in particular cases, the taking profits from lands, or rents in lieu of profits, has been allowed every where, and at all times, both in morality and law. Hence it is laid down as a general rule, Wolf §. 229. ‘Si quis fundum alienum possidet domini est, quantum valet usus  fundi, et possessoris quantum valet ejus cultura et cura.’ But even in the case of lands restored by a Treaty, the arrears of profits or rents are never restored, unless they be particularly stipulated. ‘Si res vi pacis restituendae, restituendi quoque sunt fructus à die concessionis,’ say Wolf §. 1224. and Grotius ‘Cui pace res conceditur, ei et fructus conceduntur à tempore concessionis, non utro.’ L. 3. c. 20. §. 22. To place the right to interest on money on a level with the right to profits on land, is placing it more advantageously than has been hitherto authorized: and if, as we have seen, a stipulation to restore lands does not include a stipulation to restore the back profits, we may certainly conclude a fortiori that the restitution of debts does not include an allowance of back interest on them.  
These reasons, and others like these, have probably operated on the different courts to produce decisions that ‘No interest should run during the time this general and national calamity lasted.’ And they seem sufficient, at least to rescue their decision from that flagrant denial of right, which can alone authorize one nation to come forward with complaints against the judiciary proceedings of another.  
§. 55. The States have been uniform in the allowance of Interest before, and since the war, but not of that claimed during the war. Thus we know by [E. 1.] the case of Neate’s executors v. Sands in New York, and Mildred v. Dorsey in Maryland, that in those States, interest during the war disallowed by the Courts. By [D.8.] 1784. May. the act is relating to debts due to persons who have been, and remained within the enemy’s power or lines during the late war. That Connecticut left it to their court of chancery to determine the matter according to the rules of Equity, or to leave it to referees: by [E.2.] the case of Osborne v. Mifflin’s executors, and [E.3.] Hare v. Allen, explained in the letter of Mr. Rawle,  
  
No. 59  
  
Attorney of the United States, No. 59. and by the letter of Mr. Lewis,   
  
No. 60  
  
Judge of the District court of the United States, No. 60., that in Pennsylvania the rule is that where neither the creditor nor any agent, was within the State, no interest was allowed: where either remained, they give interest. In all the other States I believe it is left discretionary in the Courts and Juries. In Massachusetts, the practice has varied. In Nov. 1784, they instruct their delegates in Congress to ask the determination of Congress, whether they understood the word ‘Debts’ in the Treaty as including interest? and whether it is their opinion that interest during the war should be paid? And at the same time they pass [D.9.] the act directing the courts to suspend rendering Judgment for any interest that might have accrued between April 19. 1775. and January 20. 1783. But in 1787. when there was a general compliance enacted through all the United States, in order to see if that  would produce a counter-compliance, their legislature passed the act repealing  
  
No. 33  
  
all laws repugnant to the Treaty No. 33. and their courts, on their part, changed their rule relative to interest during the war, which they have uniformly allowed since that time. The Circuit court of the United States at their Session atin1790, determined in like manner that interest should be allowed during the war. So that on the whole we see, that, in one State, interest during the war is given in every case; in another it is given wherever the Creditor, or any agent for him, remained in the country, so as to be accessible; in the others, it is left to the Courts and Juries to decide according to their discretion and the circumstances of the case.  
To recapitulate,  
§. 56. I have, by way of Preliminary, placed out of the present discussion, all acts and proceedings prior to the Treaty of Peace, considering them as settled by that instrument, and that the then State of things was adopted by the parties, with such alterations only as that instrument provided.  
I have then taken up the subsequent acts and proceedings of which you complain, as infractions, distributing them according to their subjects: to wit,  
  
I. Exile and Confiscations.  
II. Debts.  
III. Interest.  
  
  
  
I. Exile and Confiscations. After premising that these are lawful acts of war;  
  
I have shewn that the Vth. Article was recommendatory only,  
it’s stipulations being, not to restore the confiscations and exiles,  
but to recommend to the State legislatures to restore them.  
that this word, having but one meaning, establishes the intent of the parties and moreover  
that it was particularly explained by the american Negotiators, that the legislatures would be free to comply with the recommendation or not, and probably would not comply.  
That the British Negotiators so understood it:  
that the British Ministry so understood it:  
and the members of both houses of parliament as well those who approved as who disapproved the Article.  
  
  
I have shewn that Congress did recommend earnestly and bonâ fide:  
  
that the States refused or complied, in a greater or less degree, according to circumstances, but more of them and in a greater degree than was expected:  
and that Compensation by the British treasury, to British sufferers, was the alternative of her own choice, our negotiators having offered to do that if she would compensate such losses as we had sustained by acts unauthorized by the modern and moderate principles of war.  
  
   
II. Before entering on the subject of Debts, it was necessary  
  
1. To review the British infractions, and refer them to their exact dates.  
  
To shew that the carrying away of the Negroes preceded the 6th. of May 1783.  
That instead of evacuating the Upper posts with all convenient speed,  
  
no order had been received for the evacuation Augt. 13. 1783.  
none had been received May 10. 1784.  
none had been received July 13. 1784.  
from whence I conclude none had ever been given:  
and thence that none had ever been intended.  
  
In the latter case, this infraction would date from the Signature of the treaty,  
  
but founding it on the not giving the order with convenient speed,  
  
it dates from April 1783, when the order for evacuating New York was given:  
as there can be no reason, why it should have been inconvenient to give this order as early.  
  
  
The Infraction then respecting the Upper Posts was before the Treaty was known in america:  
  
that respecting the Negroes, was as soon as it was known.  
  
I have observed that these infractions were highly injurious;  
  
the first, by depriving us of our fur-trade, profitable in itself, and valuable as a means of remittance for paying the Debts:  
  
by intercepting our friendly and neighborly intercourse with the indian nations, and consequently keeping us in constant, expensive and barbarous war with them  
  
  
the second, by withdrawing the cultivators of the soil, the produce of which was to pay the debts.  
  
  
  
2. After fixing the date of the British infractions, I have shewn  
  
That as they preceded so they produced the acts on our part complained of as obstacles to the recovery of the Debts:  
That when one party breaks any stipulations of a treaty, the other is free to break it also, either in the whole, or in equivalent parts, at it’s pleasure:  
That congress having made no election,  
  
four of the States assumed separately to modify the recovery of debts  
  
1. by indulging their citizens with longer and more practicable times of paymt:  
2. by liberating their bodies from execution, on their delivering property to the Creditor, to the full amount of his demand, on a fair appraisement, as practised always under the Elegit.  
3. by admitting, during the first moments of the non-existence of coin among us, a discharge of executions, by payment in paper money.  
  
  
That the first of these acts of retaliation was in Dec. 1783. nine months after the infractions committed by the other party:  
And all of them were so moderate, of so short duration, the result of such necessities, and so produced, that we might with confidence have referred them alterius principis, quâ boni viri, arbitrio.  
  
3. That, induced at length, by assurances from the British court, that they would concur in a fulfilment of the treaty  
  
Congress, in 1787, declared to the States it’s will that even the appearance of obstacle raised by their acts should no longer continue,  
  
and required a formal repeal of every act of that nature; and to avoid question  
required it as well from those who had not, as from those who had passed such acts: which was complied with so fully that no such laws remained in any State of the Union, except one;  
and even that one could not have forborne, if any symptom of compliance from the opposite party had rendered a reiterated requisition from Congress important.  
  
  
4. That, indeed, the requiring such a repeal, was only to take away pretext: for   
  
That it was at all times perfectly understood that Treaties Controuled the laws of the States:  
  
the Confederation having made them obligatory on the whole;  
Congress having so declared and demonstrated them:  
the legislatures and executives of most of the States having admitted it.  
and the Judiciaries, both of the separate and general governments, so deciding.  
  
That the Courts are open every where upon this principle:  
That the British Creditors have, for some time, been in the habit and course of recovering their debts at law  
That the class of sperate and unsettled debts, contracted before the war, forms now but a small proportion of the original amount.  
That the integrity and independence of the Courts of Justice in the United States are liable to no reproach,  
Nor have

t either courts or creditors, are over-awed by them in their proceedings.  
  
   
III. Proceeding to the article of Interest, I have observed  
  
That the decision whether it shall, or shall not be allowed during the war, rests by our Constitution with the Courts altogether:  
That, if these have generally decided against the allowance, the reasons of their decision appear so weighty, as to clear them from the charge of that palpable degree of wrong which may authorize national complaint, or give a right of refusing execution of the treaty, by way of reprisal.  
  
  
To vindicate them, I have stated shortly some of the reasons which support their opinion:  
  
That Interest during the war, was not expressly given by the Treaty:  
  
That the revival of Debts did not, ex vi termini, give interest on them:  
That interest is not a part of the debt, but damages for the detention of the debt:  
That it is disallowed habitually in most Countries, yet has never been deemed a ground of national complaint against them:  
That in England also, it was formerly unlawful in all cases:  
  
That at this day it is denied there in such a variety of instances, as to protect from it a great part of the transactions of life:  
That in fact there is not a single title to debt so formal and sacred, as to give a right to Interest, under all possible circumstances, either there or here:  
That of these circumstances, Judges and Jurors, are to decide in their discretion, and are accordingly in the habit of augmenting, diminishing or refusing interest in every case, according to their discretion:  
That the circumstances against the allowance are unquestionably of the strongest in our case:  
That a great national calamity, rendering the lands unproductive, which were to pay the interest, has been adjudged a sufficient cause of itself to suspend interest:  
That were both pl. and def. equally innocent of that cause, the question who should avoid loss? would be in favor of the party in possession:  
and, a fortiori, in his favor, where the calamity was produced by the act of the demandant.  
That, moreover, the laws of the party creditor, had cut off the personal access of his debtor;  
and the transportation of his produce or money to the country of the creditor, or to any other for him:  
and where the Creditor prevents payment both of Principal and Interest the latter, at least, is justly extinguished:  
That the departure of the Creditor, leaving no agent in the Country of the Debtor, would have stopped interest of itself:  
the Debtor not being obliged to go out of the Country to seek him:  
That the Brith. Minister was heretofore sensible of the weight of the objections to the claim of Intt.  
That the Declarations of Congress, and our Plenipotentiaries, previous to the Definitive Treaty, and the silence of that instrument, afford proof that Interest was not intended on our part nor insisted on, on the other:  
That, were we to admit interest on money to equal favor with profits on land, arrears of profits would not be demandable in the present case, nor consequently arrears of interest.  
  
And, on the whole, without undertaking to say what the law is, which is not the province of the Executive,  
  
  
We say that the reasons of those Judges who deny interest during the war appear sufficiently cogent,  
  
to account for their opinion on honest principles:  
to exempt it from the charge of palpable and flagrant wrong, in re minimé dubiá:  
and to take away all pretence of withholding execution of the treaty, by way of reprisal, for that cause.  
  
  
  
§. 57. I have now, Sir, gone through the several acts and proceedings enumerated in your Appendix, as infractions of the Treaty, omitting, I believe, not a single one, as may be seen by a Table hereto subjoined, wherein every one of them, as marked and numbered in your Appendix, is referred to the Section of this Letter in which it is brought into view; and the result has been, as you have seen.  
1. That there was no absolute stipulation to restore antecedent confiscations, and that none subsequent took place:  
2. That the recovery of the Debts was obstructed validly in none of our States, invalidly only in a few, and that not till long after the infractions committed on the other side: and  
3. That the decisions of courts and Juries against the claims of Interest, are too probably founded, to give cause for questioning their integrity. These things being evident, I cannot but flatter myself, after the assurances received from you of his Britannic Majesty’s desire to remove every occasion of misunderstanding from between us, that an end will now be put to the disquieting Situation of the two Countries, by as complete execution of the Treaty as circumstances render practicable at this late day. That it is to be done so late, has been the source of heavy losses of blood and treasure to the United States. Still our desire of friendly accommodation is, and has been constant. No ‘lawful impediment has been opposed to the prosecution of the just rights of your Citizens.’ And if any instances of unlawful impediment have existed in any of the inferior tribunals, they would, like other unlawful proceedings, have been overruled on appeal to the higher Courts. If not overruled there, a complaint to the government, would have been regular, and their interference probably effectual. If your Citizens would not prosecute their rights, it was impossible they should recover them, or be denied recovery: and till a denial of right through all the tribunals, there is no ground for complaint, much less for a refusal to comply with solemn stipulations, the execution of which is too important to us ever to be dispensed with. These difficulties being removed from between the two nations, I am persuaded the interests of both will be found in the strictest friendship. The considerations which lead to it,  are too numerous and forcible to fail of their effect: and that they may be permi

Cum ea sit &amp;c. ‘Since it is a condition of war that enemies may be deprived of all their rights, it is reasonable that every thing of an enemy’s, found among his enemies, should change it’s owner, and go to the treasury. It is moreover usually directed, in all declarations of war, that the goods of enemies, as well those found among us, as those taken in war, shall be confiscated.—If we follow the mere right of war, even immoveable property may be sold, and it’s price carried into the treasury, as is the custom with moveable property. But in almost all Europe, it is only notified that their profits, during the war, shall be recieved by the treasury, and the war being ended, the immoveable property itself is restored, by agreement, to the former owner.’ Bynk.

Wolf, ſ. 1229. It was ſtipulated indeed by the IXth article, that * if  
before its arrival in America,” any place or territory belonging to either  
party ſhould be conquered by the arms of the other, it ſhould be reſtored.  
This was the only cafe in which tranſactions intervening between the big-  
nature and publication were to be-nulliticd,  
  
Congrels, on the 24th of March 178, received informal intelligence  
from the Marquis de la Fayette, that proviſional articles were concluded ;  
and on the ſame day, they received a copy of the articles, in a letter of  
March 19th, from general Carleton and admiral Digby. They imme-  
diately gave orders for cecalling all armed veſſels, and communicated the  
orders to thoſg officers, who anſwered on the 26th and 27th, that they  
were not authorized to coficur in the recall of armed veſſels, on their part.  
On the 14th of April, Congreſs reccivs an official copy of theſe articles  
from Doctor Franklin, with notice that a preliminary treaty was now  
ſigned between France, Spain, and England. The event having now  
taken place on which the proviſional articles were to come into effect, on  
the uſual footing of preliminaries, Congreſs immediately proclaim them,

be unneceſſary to obſerve, that recommendations to the people, tee  
laws, had been introduced among us, and were rendered familiar in the  
interval between diſcontinuing the old, and eſtabliſhing the new governs  
ments. The Conventions and Committees who then affembled, to guide  
the conduct of the people, having no authority to oblige them by law,  
took up the practice of ſimply recommending meaſures to them. . Theſe  
  
  
they refuſed, there was complaint, but no compulſion. So after organizing.  
the governments, if at any time it became expedient that a thing ſhould  
be done, which Congreſs, or any other of the organized bodies were not  
authorized to ordain, they ſimply recommended and left to the people, or  
their Legiſlatures, to comply, or not, as they pleaſed, It was impoſſible  
  
  
be done. The import of the terms is ſo different, that no deception or  
ſurprize could be ſuppoſed, even if there were no evidence that the differs  
ence was attended to, explained and underſtood.  
  
S. 6. But the evidence on this occaſion removes all queſtion. It is well  
known, that the Britiſh Court had it extremely at heart, to procure a  
reſtitution of the eſtates of the refugees who had gone over to their ſide:  
that they propoſed it in the firſt conferences, and inſiſted on it to the laſt :  
that our commiſſioners, on the other hand, refuſed it from firſt to laſt,  
urging firſt, That it was unreaſonable to reſtore the confiſcated property of  
the refugees, unleſs they would reimburſe the deſtruction of the property  
of our citizens, committed on their part; and 2dly, That it was beyond

to oppoſe to the clamours of the refugees, to keep alive a hope in them,  
that they might yet get their property from the State Legiſlatures ; and  
that, if they ſhould! fail in this, they would have ground to demand in-  
  
  
france of preſent relief at leaſt, that the queſtion of indemnification by them  
ſhould be kept out of fight, till time and cvents ſhould open it upon the

5. 7. The fame was perfectly underſtood by the Britiſh miniſtry, and  
by the members of both Houſes cf Parliament, as well thoſe who advoca ·  
ed as thoſe who oppoſed the treaty ; the latter of whom being out of the  
  
  
import of the terms. That all parties concurred m this expoſition will  
zppear by the following extracts from the parliamentary regilter ; a work  
which, without pretending to give what is ſpoken with verbal accuracy,  
may yet be relied on, we preſume, for the general reaſoning and opiniort

The preliminary articles under conſideration : 1783, Feb. 19th. Mr.  
Thomas Pitt. That the intereſt of the ſincere loyaliſts was as dear to  
um, as to any man; but that he could never think it would have been  
promoted by carrying on that unfortunate war which parliament had in  
fact ſuſpended before the beginning of the treaty ; that it was impoſſible,  
iter the part Congreſs was pleaſed to take in it, to conceive that their re-  
cmmendation would not have its proper influence on the different Legiſla-  
tures; that he did not himfelf ſee what more could have been done on  
thcir behalf, except by renewing the, war for their ſakes, and increaſing  
bur, and their calamities. 9 Debrett&#x27;s Parl. Regiſter, 233.  
  
Mr. Wilberforce, 4 When he conſidered the caſe of the loyaliſts, he  
confeſſed he felt himfelf there conquered, there he ſaw his country humi-  
  
  
licve, that Congreſs would religiouſly comply with the article, and that  
the loyaliſts would obtain redreſs from America. Should they not, this  
country was bound to afford it them. They muſt be compenſated : Mi-  
niſters, he was perſuaded, meant to keep the faith of the nation with them,  
and he verily believed, had obtained the beſt terms they poſſibly could for

House of Lexvs, Run 17th, 1783.  
Lord Shelburne; 4 A part muſt be wounded, that the whole of the  
empire may not periſh. If better terms could be had, think you, my  
Lords, that I would not have embraced them? - You all know my creed.  
You al! know my ſteadineſs. thSp&#x27;cre poſſible . to put aſide the bitter  
cup the adverſities of this countfy preſented to me, you know I would  
have done it : but you called for peace. I had but the alternative, either  
to accept the terms, ſaid Congreſs, of our recommendation to the States,  
in favour of the Coloniſts, or continue the war. It is in our power to do  
no more than recommend. Is there any man who hears me, who will clap  
his hand on his heart, and ſtep forward and ſay, I ob ght to have broken  
  
  
country, nor yet has he paid any attention to the wWihhes of it. But ſay the  
  
  
cheriſhed in the boſom of their own country. Is England ſo loſt to grati-  
rude, and all the feelings of humanity, as not to afford them an aſylum? —  
Who can be fo baſe as to think the will refuſe it to them? Surely it can-  
not be that noble-minded man who would plunge his country again knee  
deep in blcod, and &quot;ſaddle it with an expence of twenty millions for the  
purpoſe of reſtoring them. Without one drop of blood ſpilt, and with-  
out one fifth of the expence of one year&#x27;s campaign, happineſs and eaſe  
can be given to the loyaliſts in as ample a manner as theſe bleſſings were

Lord Hawke. „In America,” faid he, « Congreſs had engaged to  
  
  
What other term could they adopt? He had ſearched the Journals of Con-  
greſs on this ſubject: What other term did they, or do they ever adopt  
in their requiſitions to the different provinces ? It is en undertaking on the  
part of Congreſs ; that body, like the king here, is the exceutive gower in  
America. Can the Crown undertake for the two Houſes of Parliament!  
It can only recommend. He flattered himſelf that recommendation would  
be attended with ſucceſs ; bur, ſaid he, ftate the eaſe that it will not; the  
liberality of Great-Britain is ſtill open to them. Miniſters had pledged  
themſelves to indemnify them; not only in the addreſs now moved for, but  
even in the laſt addreſs, and in the ſpeech from the throne,” |

unanimouſly refuſed when the Congreſs defired to be authorized to lay a  
duty of five per cent. becauſe the funds had failed. Many other circum-  
ſtances might be produced of the failure of the recommendations of Con-  
greſs, and therefore we ought not, in negociations for the loyaliſts, to have  
truſted ro the recommendations of Congreſs. Nothing but the repeal of the  
acts exiſting againſt them ought to have ſufficed, as nothing elſe could give  
elſect to the treaty ; repeat was not mentioned. They had only ſtipulated  
z0 reviſe and reconſider them.” 11 Debrett&#x27;s Parl. Reg. 44. |  
Lord Sackville. © The king&#x27;s miniſters had weakly imagined that the  
recommendation of Congreſs was a ſufficient ſecurity for theſe unhappy  
men. For his own. part, ſo far from believing that this would be ſuffi-  
cient, or any thing like ſufficient, for their proteCtion, he was of a direct  
contrary opinion: And if they entertained any notions of this ſort, he

late as on the 17th of | December laſt. The reſolution was as follows:  
That all demands or requeſts of the Britiſh Court, for the reſtitution of  
property, confiſcated by this ſtate, being neither ſupported by law, equity,  
cr policy, are wholly inadmiſſible: And that our delegates in Congreſs be  
iuſtrutted to move Congreſs, that they may direct their deputies who ſhall  
repreſent theſe States in the General Congreſs, for adjuſting a peace or  
truce, neither to agree to any ſuch reſtitution, or ſubmit rhat the laws made  
by any independent State in this Union, be ſubjected to the adjudication of  
any power or powers on Earth. Ib. page 62, 63. |  
  
dome of the ſpeakers ſeem to have had not very accurate ideas of our  
rovernment. All of them however have perfectly underſtood, that a re-  
cor:mendation was a matter, not of obligation or coercion, but of perſuaſion  
nd influence, merely. They appear to have entertained greater or leſs  
degices of hope or doubt, as to its effect on the legiſlatures, and though  
willing to ſee the reſult of this chance, yet if it failed, they were prepared  
io take the work of indemnification on themſelves,  
  
S. 8. The agreement then, being only that Congreſs ſhould recommend  
22 the State Legiſlatures, a reſtitution of eſtates, and liberty to remain a  
wwerremonth for the purpoſe of ſoliciting the reſtitution, and to recommend  
a reviſion of all acts regarding the premiſes, Congreſs did immediately

8. 9. The Britiſh negociators had been told by ours, that all the States  
would refuſe to comply with this recommendation: One only, however,  
refuſed altogether. The others complied in a greater or leſs degree, ac-  
cording to the circumſtances and diſpoſitions in which the events of the war  
had left them; but had all of them refuſed, it would have been no viola-  
  
reſerved to them, and fo underſtood by all parties.

ble of that character who had been named in any confiſcation law, or ba»  
niſhed, or had borne arms againſt them. This act does not prohibit either  
the refugees, or real Britiſh ſubjects from coming into the ſtate to purſue  
their lawful affairs. It only excludes the former from their right of citi-

all the inhabitants had been obliged either to abandon their eſtates and fly  
their country, or to remain in it under a military government,  
  
S. 12. South-Carotina, Auguſt 15th. An Act to veſt 180 acres of  
land, late the property of James Holmes, in certain perſons, in truſt for the  
benefit of a public ſchool, Theſe lands had been confiſcated and fold dur-

purchaſers, and provides for paying the debts of the former proprietors.

Governor Moultrie&#x27;s letter of June 21, 1786, informs us, that moſt of

Gordon, to appear before the iſt day of November, 1781, and failing, his  
eſtate was ſized by the commiſſioners of forfeitures, and moſt of it ſold,  
The Act of 1783, January 31, cured the miſnomer, and directed what  
remained of his eſtate, to be ſold. The confiſcation being complete, it was  
for them to ſay whether they would reſtore it, in compliance with the re-  
commendation of Congreſs. They did not, and the executive completed  
the ſale, as they were bound to do. All perfons were permitted to return

was the eſtate of John Zabriſki, which had been forfeited during the war,  
and the Act gives it to major general Baron Stuben, in reward for his ſer-  
vices. The confiſcation being complete, the legiſlature were free to do  
  
  
deration of this State, after the proclamation of peace, and from that we  
have a right to conclude, that no perſons were prevented from returning

S. 22, New-Hampſbire. Againſt New-Hampſhire nothing (is alleged;  
that ſtate hiving not been invaded at all, was not induced to exerciſe any  
acts of rigour againſt the ſubjects or adherents of their enemies.  
  
The acts then, which have been coniplained of, as violations of the vu  
article, were ſuch as the ſtates were free to paſs, notw ithſtanding the recom-  
mendation, ſuch as it was well underſtood they would be free to paſs with -  
out any imputation of infraction, and may therefore be put entirely out of  
queſtion.  
  
S. 23. And we may further obſerve, with reſpe&amp; to the ſame 205, that  
they have been conſidered as infractions not only of the Vth article, which  
recommended the reſtoration of the confiſcations which had taken place during  
the Tvar ; but alſo, of that part of the VIth article which forbade future con-  
fiſcations ; but not one of them touched an eſtate which had not been beſom  
confiſcated ; for you will obſerve, * that an act of the legiſlature confiſcat-  
ing lands, ſtands in place of an office found in ordinary caſes ; and that on  
the paſſage of the ac, as on the finding of the office, the ſtate ſtands ipſo facto  
poſſeſſed of the lands, without a formal entry. The confiſcation then is  
complete by the paſſage of the act. Both the title and poſſeſſion being di-  
veſted out of the former proprietor, and veſted in the ſtate, no ſubſequent  
proccedings relative to the lands, are acts of confiſcation, but are mere ex-  
  
  
leaſe, or in perpetuo, by an abſolute deed, I believe therefore, it may be  
ſaid with truth, that there was not a ſingle confiſcation made in any one  
of the United States, after notification of the treaty ; and conſequently,  
it wil] not be neceſſary to notice again this part of the 6th article.  
  
S. 24. Before quitting the recommendatory article, two paſſages in the  
letter are to be noted, which applying to all the ſtates in general, could not  
have been properly anſwered under any one of them in particular, In  
page 10, is the following paſſage : The expreſs proviſion in the treaty,  
for the reſtitution of the eſtates and properties of perſons of both theſe de-  
  
  
tiſh lines, but had not borne arms, ] certainly comprehended a virtual c-  
quieſcence in their right to reſide where their property was ſituated, and

Britiſh plenipotentiary meant to ſtipulate a right for man to emi-  
22 and become members of another community.  
  
5. 25. Again, in page 34. it is ſaid, ** The nation of Great-Britain has  
deen involved in the payment to them of no leſs a ſum than four millions  
{riing, as a partial compenſation for the loſſes they had ſuſtained.“ It has  
becn before proved, that Mr. Oſwald underſtood perfectly, that no indem-  
nication was claimed from us; that on the contrary we had a counter  
claim of indemnification to much larger amount: It has been ſuppoſed,  
aud not without grounds, that the glimmering of hope provided by the re.  
com nendatory article, was to quiet, for the preſent, the clamours of the  
ſuff.rers, and to keep their weight out of the ſcale of oppoſition to the  
peace, truſting to time and events, for an oblivion of theſe claims, or a gra-  
dual ripening of the public mind to meet and ſatisfy them, at a moment of  
leſs embarraſſment : the latter is the turn which the rhingtook. The claimants  
continued their importunities, and the government determined at length  
  
  
work, it coſt them leſs than to have ſettled with us, the juſt account of  
mutual indemnification, urged by our commiſſioners. It may be well  
  
  
four millions you have paid, would have been no indemnification for the  
loſes of property ſuſtained contrary even to the laws of war: and what  
ſum would have indemnified the whole thirteen, and conſequently to  
  
  
thought proper to give to the refugees, we could not be inattentive to the  
meaſure in which they were dealt out. Thoſe who were on the ſpot, and  
who knew intimately the ſtate of affairs with the individuals of this deſcrip-

S. 26. II. The article of debts is next e but to place on their  
true grounds our proceedings relative to them, it will be neceſſary to take  
a view of the Britiſh: proceedings, which are the ſubject of complaint in  
my letter of December 15th.  
  
In the 7th article, jt was ſtipulated, that his Britannic majeſty ſhould  
withdraw his armies, garriſons and fleers, without carrying away any ne-  
groes, or other property of the American inhabitants. This ſtipulation  
  
  
1783, as prowifomally agreed, amd on the 5th of April, they received official  
notice from their court of the conclufion and ratification of the prelimina-  
ry articles between France, Spain, and Great-Britain, which gave activity  
to ours, as appears by tlie letter of Sir Guy Carleton to Gen. Waſhington  
dated April 6, 1783. [ Document, No. 21. ] From this time then, ſurely  
no negroes could be carried away without a violation of the treaty. Vet  
we find that fo carly as the 6th May, a lunge number of them had already  
been embarked for Nova- Scotia, of which, as contrary to an expreſs ſtipu-  
lation in the treaty, Gen. Waſhington declared ro him his ſenſe and his  
ſurpriſe. In the letter of Sir Guy Carleton of May 12, (annexed to mine  
to you of the rgth of December) he admits the fact, palliates it by ſaying  
ſe had no right to deprive the negroes of that liberty he found them  
foſſrffed of, that it was unfriendly to fuppoſe tliat the King&#x27;s mini-  
ſter could ſtipulate to be guilty of a notorious breach of the public  
  
  
ed by compenſation, reſtoration being utterly impracticable, where inſepara-  
ble from a breach ot public faith. But ſurely, Sir, an officer of the king  
is not eo queſtion the validity ofthe king&#x27;s engagements, norviolate his ſolemn  
treaties, on his own ſcruples about the public faith. Under this pretext,  
however, general Carleton went on in daily infractions, embarking, from  
time to time, between his notice of the treaty, the 5th of April, and the  
evacuation of New- York, Nov. 2 5—3000 negroes, of whom our Commil-  
ſioners had inſpection, and a very lage number more, in pnblic and private  
veſlels, of whom they were not permitted to have iuſpection. Here, then,

the United States. When no preciſe term, ſays a writer on the law of  
nations, [ Vattel, I. 4. c. 26, ] has been marked for the accompliſhment of  
2 treaty, and for the execution of each of its articles, good ſenſe determines  
that every point ſhould be executed as oor as poſſible : This is, without  
doubt, what was underſtood.” The term in the treaty, with all conventent  
  
  
The general pacification being ſigned on the 2oth of Jan. ſome time would  
be requiſite for the orders for evacuation to come over to America, for  
the removal of ſtores, property and perſons, and finally, for the act of eva-  
cuation. The larger the poſt, the longer the time neceſſary to remove all its  
contents; the ſmaller, the ſooner done: Hence, though general Carleton  
received his orders to evacuate New- Vork, in the month of April, the eva-  
cuation was not completed till late in November. &#x27;It had been the principal  
place of arms and ſtores ; the ſeat, as it were, of their general government,  
and the aſylum of thoſe who had fled to them, A great quantity of ſhip-  
ping was neceſſary, therefore, for the removal, and the General was obliged  
to call for a part from foreign countries. Theſe cauſes of delay were duly  
reſpe&amp;ted on our part. But the poſts of Michillimackinac, Detroit, Nia-  
gara, Oſwego, Ofwegatchie, Point-au-Fer, Dutchman&#x27;s Point, were not of  
this magnitude. The orders for evacuation, which reached genera! Carleton,  
n New-York, early in April, might have gone, in one month more, to the  
moſt remote of theſe poſts : Some of them might have been evacuated in a  
few days after, and the largeſt in a few weeks, Cerxtainly they might all  
tave been-delivered, without any iuconventent ſpeed in the operations, by  
the end of May, from the known facility furniſhed by the lakes, and the  
water connecting them; or by croſſing immediately over into their own  
territory, and availing themſelves of the ſeaſon for making new eftabliſh-  
ments there, if that was intended : Or whatever time might, in event,  
have been neceſſary for their evacuation, certainly the order for it ſhould  
have been given from England, and might have been given as early as that  
from New-York, Was any order ever given? Would not an unneceſſuy  
«lay of the order, producing an equal delay in the evacuation, be an in-  
fraction of the treaty ? Let us inveſtigate this matter.  
  
On the 3d of Aug. 1783, major-general baron Steuben, by orders from  
general Waſhington, having repaired to Canada for this purpoſe, wrote  
the letter, No. 22, to general Haldimand, governor of the province, and re-  
*ived from. him the anſwer of Aug. 13, No, 23. Whertin he fays, The

only,” &amp;c. And in his conference with baron Steuben, he ſays expreſily,  
© That he had not recerved any orders for making the leaſt arrangement for  
the evacuation of a ſingle poſt.” The orders then, which might have  
been with him by the laſt of April, were unknown, if they exiſted, the  
middle of Auguſit—See Baron Steuben&#x27;s letter, No. 24. |  
  
Again, on the 19 of March, 1784, gov. Clinton, of New-York, within  
the limits of which ſtate ſome of theſe poſts are, writes to general Haldi-  
mand the letter No. 25; and that general, anſwering him, May 10,  
  
  
ſtructions relative to withdrawing the garriſons,” &amp;c. Fourteen months  
were now elapſed, and the orders not yet received, which might have been  
received in four.  
  
Again, on the 12 of July, col. Hull, by order from general Knox,  
the Secretary at War, writes to general Haldimand the letter No. 27 ; and  
general Haldimand gives the anfwer of the 13, No. 28, wherein he fays,  
Though I am now informed, by his majeſty&#x27;s miniſters, of the ratifica-  
tion, &amp;c. I remain, &amp;c. not having received any orders to evacuate the poſts  
which are without the limits, &amp;. And this is eighteen months after the  
  
  
order was not arrived on the 13 of Aug. 1783, if it was not arrived on the  
10 of May, 1784, nor yet on the 13 of July, in the ſame year, that,  
in truth, the order had never been given? And if it had never been  
given, may we not conclude, that it never had been intended to be given?  
From what moment is it we are to date this infraction? From that, at  
which, with convenient ſpeed, the order to evacuate the upper poſts might  
have been given. No legitimate reaſon can be aſſigned, why that order  
might not have been given as early, and at the ſame time as the order to  
  
  
treaty.  
S. 28. Was this delay merely innocent and unimportant as to us, fete  
ting aſide all conſiderations but of intereſt and ſafety ? 1. It cut us of  
from the fur-trade, which, before the war, had been always of great im-  
portance as a branch of commerce, and as a ſource of remittance for the  
paymentof our debts to Great-Britain : for to the i injury of withholding our  
poſts, they added the obſtruction of all paſſage along the lakes and their  
communications. 2. It ſecluded us from connection with the north-weſtern  
Indians, from all opportunity of keeping up with them friendly and neigh-  
dourly intercourſe, brought on us conſequently, from their known difpo-  
  
  
children have been, and ſtill are daily falling victims to the ſcalping knife,  
and to which there will be no period, but in our poſſeſſion of the poſs  
which command their country. 1  
  
3  
It may ſafely be ſaid then that the treaty was violated in England, de ·  
fore it was known in America, and in America, as ſoon as it was known,  
and that too in points ſo eſſential as that without them, it would never  
have been concluded. ;  
  
S. 29. And what was the effe&amp; of theſe infractions on the American  
mind ? On the breach of any article of a treaty by the one party, the other  
  
Brit, pro-  
  
  
itſelf by withholding execution of equivalent articles; or to wave notice of  
the breach altogether.  
  
Congreſs being informed that the Britiſh commanding officer was car-  
ming away the negroes from New-York, in avowed violation of the trea-  
, and againſt the repeated remonſtrances of Gen. Waſhington, they take  
up the ſubje&amp; on the 26th of May, 1783 ; they declare that it 1s contrary  
  
  
nipotentiary in Europe to remonſtrate, and demand reparation, and that,  
m the mean time, General Waſhington continue his remonſtrances to the  
Britiſh commanding officer, and inſiſt on the diſcontinuance of the meaſure.  
5 document No. 29.) M  
S. 30. The ſtate of Virginia, materially affected by this infraftion,* be-  
cauſe the labourers thus carried away were chiefly from thence ; while  
heavy debts were now to be paid to the very nation which was depriving  
them of the means, took up the ſubje&amp; in Dec. 1783, that is to ſay, ſeven  
months after that particular infraction, and four months after the firſt re-  
fuſal to deliver up the poſts, and inſtead of arreſting the debts abſolutely,  
in repriſal, for their negroes carried away, they paſſed [D. 8. ] the act to re-  
vive and continue the ſeveral acts for ſuſpending the iſſuing executions on  
certain judgments until December 1783; that is to ſay, they revived till  
their next meeting two acts paſſed during the war, which ſuſpended all  
voluntary and fraudulent aſſignments of debt, and as to others, allowed real  
and perſonal eſtate to be tendered in diſcharge of executions : the effect of  
which was to relieve the body of the debtor from priſon, by authorizing  
him to deliver property in diſcharge of the debt. In June following,  
  
  
refuſal, by the Britiſh commanding officer, to deliver up the poſts, they  
came to the reſolution No. 30, reciting ſpecially the infraction reſpecting  
their negroes, inſtructing their delegates in Congreſs to preſs for repara-  
tion; and reſolving, that the courts ſhall be open to Britiſh ſuits as ſoon as  
1eparation ſhall be made, or otherwiſe, as ſoon as Congreſs Mall judge it  
indiſpenſably neceſſary. And in 1787, they paſſed [C. 7.] the act to repeal  
o much of all and every act or acts of aſſembly as prohibits the recovery  
of Britiſh debts ; and at the ſame time [E. 6,] the act to repeal part of

n protection and encouragement of the commerce of nations  
acknowledging the independence of the United States of America. The  
former was not to be in force till the evacuation of the poſts, and reparatiog  
for the negroes carried away. The latter requires particular explanation.  
The ſmall ſuppligs of European goods which reached us during the war,  
were frequently brought by captains of veſſels and ſupercargoes, who, as  
  
  
veſſels, To perſons under ſuch circumſtances, it was neceſſary to give a  
ſummary remedy for the recovery of the proceeds of their ſale. This had  
been done by the law for the protection and encouragement of the com-  
merce of nations acknowledging the independence of the United States,  
which was meant but as a temporary thing, to continue whilſt the ſame  
circumſtances continued: On the return of peace, the ſupplies of foreign  
goods were made, as before the war, by merchants reſident here. There was  
no longer reaſon to continue to them the ſummary remedy which had been  
provided for the tranſient vender of goods: And indeed it would have  
been uncqual to have given the reſident merchant inſtantaneous judgment  
againſt a farmer or tradeſman, while the farmer or tradeſman could  
purſue thoſe who owed him money but in the ordinary way, and with the  
ordinary delays. The Britiſh creditor had no ſach unequal privilege,  
while we were under Britiſh government, and had no title to it in juſtice,  
or by the treaty, after the war. When the legiſlature proceeded then to  
repeal the law as to other nations, it would have been extraordinary to have  
continued it for Great-Britain.  
  
S. 31. South Carolina was the ſecond ſacs which moved, in conſequence  
of the Britiſh infractions, urged thereto by the deſolated condition in which  
  
  
almoſt entire deſtruction of the means of payivg them. They paſſed  
[D. 5. 20.] 1784, Mar. 26, an ordinance reſpecting the recovery of debts,  
ſuſpending the recovery of all actions, as well American as Britiſh,  
for nine months, and then allowing them to recover payment at four  
  
  
time, to give good ſecurity for his debt, or otherwiſe refuſing him the  
benefit of the act by

ment of debts, and prohibiting the importation of negroes, they extended

the proceedings of the debtor, grounds might be found in the peculiar  
diſtreſſes of that ſtate, and the liberality with which they had complied

a modification of the recovery of debts. Tt obliged the Britiſh fubject,  
before he could recover what was due to him within the ſtate, to give bond  
for the payment of what he owed therein. It is reaſonable that every one  
who aſks juſtice ſhould do juſtice; and it is uſual to conſider the property of  
a foreigner, in any country, as a fund appropriated to the payment of what  
he owes&#x27;in that country, excluſively. It is a care which moſt nations take  
  
demands, be withdrawn from its juriſdiction, and ſend them to ſeek it in  
foreign countries, and before foreign tribunals,  
  
S, 35. With reſpect to the obſtacles thus oppoſed to the Britiſh credizee,  
befides their general juſtification, as being produced by the previous  
infractions on the part of Great-Britain, each of them admits of a ſpecial  
apology. They are, 1ſt. Delay of judgment. 2d. Liberating the body  
from execution, on the delivery of property. 3d. Admitting executions  
to be diſcharged in paper money. As to the 1ſt, let it be conſidered, that  
from the nature of the commerce carried on between theſe ſtates and Great  
Britain, they were generally kept in debt; that a great part of the country,  
and moſt particularly Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia,  
New-York and Rhode-Iſland, had been ravaged by an enemy, moveable  
property carried off, houſes burnt, lands abandoned, the proprietors forced  
oft into exile and poverty. When the peace permitted them to return  
again to their lands, naked and deſolate as they were, was inſtant payment  
Pratticable? The contrary was fo palpable that the Britiſh creditors  
themſelves were ſenſible that, were they to ruſh to judgment immediately  
againſt their debtors, it would involve the debtor in total ruin, without  
relieving the creditor. It is a fact, for which we may appeal to the know.  
ledge of one member, at leaſt, of the Britiſh adminiſtration of 1783, that  
the chairman of the North American merchants, conferring on behalf of  
thoſe merchants with the American miniſters then in London, was fo  
ſenſible that time was neceſſary, as well to fave the creditor as debtor; that  
he declared, there would not be a moment&#x27;s heſitation, on the part  
of rhe creditors, to allow payment by inſtalments annually for ſeven  
years z and that this arrangement was not We, was neither his fault  
nor ours.  
  
To the neceſſities for ſome delay in the payment of debts may be added,  
the Britiſh commercial regulations lefſening our means of payment, by  
  
dominions in ur neighbourhood, and excluding valuable branches of  
it from their home markets by prohibitory duties. The means of pay:

the effect of his own act, and the leaſt injurious of thoſe it is capable of  
producing. The inſtalment acts before enumerated have been much leſs  
general, and for a ſhorter term, than what the chairman of the American  
merchants thought reaſonable. Moſt of them required the debtor to give  
ſecurity, in the mean time, to his creditor, and provided complete indem-  
nification of the delay, by the payment of intereſt, which was enjoined in  
every caſe.  
  
S. 36. The ſecond ſpecies of obſtacle was the admitting the debtor to  
relieve his body from impriſonment by the delivery of lands or goods to  
his creditor, And is this idea original, and peculiar to us? or whence  
have we taken it? From England, from Europe, from natural right and  
reaſon. For it may be ſafely affirmed, that neither natural right nor  
  
  
abuſes introduced by commerce and credit, and which even the moſt  
  
  
Roman laws, the principles of which are the neareſt to natural reaſon of  
  
body in criminal cafes only, or thoſe wherein the party had expreſsly  
ſubmitted himſelf to it.— The French laws allow it only in criminal or  
eommercial caſes. —The laws of F.ngland, in certain deſcriptions of caſes  
(as bankruptcy); releaſe the body. Many of the United States do the  
ſame, in all caſes, on a ceſſion of property by the debtor, The levari  
tacias, an execution affecting only the profits of lands, is the only one  
allowed in England, in certain caſes. The elegit, another execution of  
that and this country, attaches firſt on a man&#x27;s chattels, which are not to  
be ſold, but to be delivered to the plaintiff, on a reaſonable appraiſement,  
in part of ſatisfaction for his debt, and, if not ſufficient, one half only of  
his lands are then to be delivered to the plaintiff, till the profirs ſhall  
have ſatisfied him. The tender laws of theſe States were generally more  
farourable than the execution by clegit, becauſe they not only gave, as  
that does, the whole property in chattels, but alſo che whole property in  
the lands, and not merely the profits of them. It is, therefore, an  
execution framed on the model of the Engliſh clegit, or rather an  
amendment of that writ, taking away, indeed, the election of the  
party againſt the body of his debtor, but giving him, in exchange for  
it, much more complete remedy againſt his lands. Let it be obſerved  
too, that this proceeding was allowed againſt citizens, as well as  
foreigners ; and it may be queſtioned, whether the treaty is not ſatis-  
fied, while the fame meaſore is dealt out to Britiſh ſubjeAs, as to

= — goods ſold under execution. The complaint on this head is only againſt  
| * Georgia, South Carolina, Jerſey and Rhode-Iſland : and this obſtruftion,  
like the two others, ſprung out of the peculiar nature of the war. For  
thoſe will form very falſe concluſions who reaſon, as to this war, from  
the circumſtances which have attended other wars, and other nations,  
When any nation of Europe is attacked by another, it has neighbours;  
with whom its accuſtomary commerce goes on without interruption ;  
and its commerce with more diſtant nations is carried on by ſea, in  
foreign bottoms, at leaſt, under protection of the laws of neutrality. The  
produce of its ſoil. can be exchanged for money, as uſual, and the ſtock of  
that medium of circulation is not at all diminiſhed by war; ſo that pro-  
perty ſells as readily and as well, for real money, at the cloſe as at the  
commencement of the war. But how different was our caſe ! On the north  
and ſouth were our enemies; on the weſt, deſerts inhabited by ſavages in  
league with them; on the eaſt, an occan of 1c00 leagues, beyond which,  
indeed, were nations who might have purchaſed the produce of our ſoil;  
and have given us real money in exchange, and thus kept up our ſock &gt;  
money, but who were deterred from coming to us by threats of war on  
the part of our enemies, if they ſhould preſume ts conſider us as a people  
entitled to partake the benc fit of that law of war which allows commerce  
with neutral nations. What were the conſequences? The ſtock of hard  
money, which we- poſſeſſed ia an ample degree, at the beginning of the  
war, ſoon flowed into Europe for ſupplics of arms, ammunition and other  
neceffaries, which we were not in the habit of manufacturing for our-  
ſelves. The produce of our ſoil, attempted to be carried in our own  
bottoms te Europe, fell, two thirds of it, into the hands of our enemies,  
who were maſters of the ſea ; the other third illy ſuſficed to procure the  
| neceſſary implements of war, ſo that no returns of money ſupplied the  
place of that which had gone off. We were reduced then to the refource  
of a paper medium, and that completed the exile of the hard money:  
ſo that, in the latter ſtages of the war, we were, for years together,  
without ſering a ſingle coin of the precious metals in circulation, It was  
cloſed with a ſtipulation that we ſhould pay a large maſs of debt in ſuctt  
coin. If the whole ſoil of the United States had been offered for ſale for  
ready coin, it would not have raiſed as much as would have farisfied this  
Ripulation. The thing then was impoſſible, and reaſon and authority

ſhould reſort, under ſuch circumſtances, to very ſmall emiſſions of paper ·  
money, is not wonderful: that all did not, proves their firmneſs under  
ſufferance, and that they were diſpoſed to bear whatever could be borne,  
rather than contravene, even by way of equivalent, ſtipulations which had  
been authoritatively entered into by them. And even in the four ſtates  
which emitted paper money, it was in ſuch ſmall ſums, and fo ſecured, as  
to ſuffer only a ſhort&gt;lived, and not great depreciation of value; nor did  
they continue its quality as a tender, after the firſt paroxyſms of diftreſs  
  
  
this ſpecies of payment equally with Britiſh ſubjects.  
  
So that, when it is conſidered, that the other party had broken the  
treaty from the beginning, and that too in points which leſſened our ability  
to pay their debts, it was a proof of the moderation of our nation, to  
  
  
than to indulge the debtors with that time for diſcharging their debts  
which their diſtieſſes called for, and the intereſts and the reaſon of their  
creditors approved. |

alone poſſeſſed the power of peace and war, of making treaties, and, conſe-  
quently, of declaring their infractione, had abſtained from every public de-

thoſe very proceedings of our ſtates, which their previous infractions had  
produced, as a ground for further refuſal, and inverting the natural order  
of cauſe and eſſect, alleged that theſe proceedings of ours were the cauſes  
of the infractions, which they had committed months and years before.

23th, 1786, to Mr. Adams&#x27; memorial, ſays, (The engagements entered  
into by treaty ought to be mutual, and equally binding on the reſpeflive  
contracting parties. It would, therefore, be the heighr of folly, as well as  
injuſtice, to ſuppoſe one party alone obliged to a ſtrict obſervance of the  
public&#x27; faith, while the other might remain free to deviate from its own

though at the expence of its own national credit and importance. I flatter  
my{!f, however, fir, that juſtice will ſpeedily be done to Britiſh creditors ;  
and I can aſſure you, fir, that whenever America ſhall manifeſt a real inten-  
tion to fulfil her part of the treaty, Great-Britain will not heſitate to prove  
her ſincerity to co-operate in whatever points depend upon her, for carrying  
every article of it into real and complete effect.“ Facts will n. *

The Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the United States, by order of  
  
  
itates, dated May 3d, 1786, [No. 31. ] to obtain information, how far they  
had complied with the proclamation of January 1 4th, 1784, and the re-  
commendation accompanying it; and April 1 3, 1787, Congreſs, deſirous of  
removing every pretext which might continue to cloak the inexecution of  
the treaty, wrote a circular letter to the ſeveral ftates, in which, in order to  
produce more ſurely the effect deſired, they demonſtrate, that Congreſs  
alone poſſeſs the right of interpreting, reſtraining, impeding or counter-  
acting. the operation and exccution of treaties, which, on being conſtitu-  
tionally made, become, by the confederation, a part of the law of the land,  
  
and as ſuch, independent of the will and power of the legiſlatures : that, in  
this point of view, the ſtate-acts, eſtabliſhing proviſions relative to the ſame  
objects, and incompatible with it, muſt be improper: reſolving, that all ſuch

continuing to be regarded as violations of the treaty, as to avoid the diſa-  
grecable neceſlity of diſcuſſing their validity; recommending, in order to  
obviate all future diſputes and-queſtions, that every ſtate, as well thoſe  
which had paſſed noſuch acts, as thoſe which had, ſhould paſs an act, re-  
pealiug, in general terms, all acts and parts of acts repugnant to the treaty;  
and encouraging them to do this, by informing them that they had the ſtrong-

Gcorgia had no law exiſting againſt the treaty.— South- Carolina, indeed,  
had a law exiſting, which ſubjected all perſons, foreign or native, [No. 44]  
to certain modifications of recovery and payment. But the liberality of her  
conduct, on the other points, is a proof the would have conformed in this  
  
  
Britain to compliance, and had an expreſs repeal been really neceſſary. _  
$.:40. For indeed all this was ſupererogation. It reſulted from the inſtru -  
ment of confederation among the ſtates, that treaties made by Congreſs ac-  
cording te the confederation, were ſuperior to the laws of the ſtates, The  
circular letter of Congreſs had declared and demonſtrated it, and the ſeveral  
ſtates, by their acts and explanations before mentioned, had ſhewn it.to be  
their own ſenſe, as we may ſafely affirm it to have been the general ſenſe of  
thoſe, at leaſt, who were of the profeſſion of the law. Beſides the proof of  
this, drawn from the act of confederation itſelf, the declaration of Congreſs  
and the acts of the ſtates before mentioned, the ſame principle will be found  
acknowledged in ſeveral of the documents hereto annexed for other pur-  
poſes. Thus, in Rhode-Iſland, governor Collins, in his letter, No. 20,  
ſays, © The treaty, in all its ab/ute parts, has been fully complied with,  
and to thoſe parts that are merely recommendatary, and depend upon the  
  
  
Mr. Channing the attorney for the United States, in that tate, [No. 19,  
ſpeaking of an act paſſed before the treaty, ſays, *« This act was conſidered  
  
  
cation thereof no proceedings have been had thereon,” The governor of  
Connecticut, in his letter, No. 18, ſays, „The fixth article of the treaty  
was immediately obſerved on receiving the ſame with the proclamation of  
Congreſs, the courts of juſtice adopted it as @ principle of law. No further  
proſecutions were inſtituted againſt any perſon who came within that ar»  
ticle, and all ſuch proſecutions, as were then pending, were diſcontinued.”  
Thus proſecutions going on, under the law of the ſtate, were diſcontinued,  
by the treaty operating as. a repeal of the.law. In Pennſylvania, Mr.  
Lewis, Attorney for the United States, ſays, in his letter, No. 60, The  
judges have uniformly and without heſitation, declared in favour of the  
treaty, on the ground of its being the ſupreme law of the land. On this  
ground, they have not only diſcharged attainted traitors from arreſts, but

be of this fre. This had been done by Dorſey, before the  
of the treaty; yet the judges of the fare general court decided, that the  
treaty not only repealed the law for the future, but for the paſt alſo, and  
decreed, that the defendant ſhould pay the money over again to the Britiſh  
creditor. In Virginia, Mr. Monroe, one of the ſenators of that ſtate in  
Congreſs, and a lawyer of eminence, tells us, No. 532, that both court and  
counſel there avowed the opinion, that the treaty would control any law of  
the ſtate oppoſed to it. And the legiſlature itſelf, in an act of October  
1787, C. 36, concerning monies carried into the public loan-office, in  
payment of Britiſh debts, uſe theſe expreſſions. And whereas it belong:  
not to the legiſlature to decide particular queſtions, of which the judiciary  
have cognizance, and it is, therefore, unfit for them to determine, whether  
the payments ſo made into the loan-office, be good or void between the cre-  
ditor and debtor.” In New-York, Mr. Harriſon, Attorney for the United  
States, in that diſtrict, aſſures us, No. 45, that the act of 1782, of chat  
ſtate, relative to debts due to perſons within the enemy&#x27;s lines, was, imme-  
  
  
operating on Britiſh creditors, and that he did not know a fingle inftance  
to the contrary : a full proof, that they conſidered the treaty as a law of  
the land paramount the law of their ſtate,”  
  
S. 41. The very caſe of Rutgers v. Waddington [E. 8.7 which is a  
ſubje&amp; of complaint in your letter, is a proof that the courts confider the  
treaty as paramount the laws of the ſtates. Some parts of your informa-  
tion, as to that caſe, have been inexact. The ſtate of New-York had, dur-  
ing the war, paſſed an Act [C. 16.] declaring that, in any action by the

legiſlature revived the ſame Act [C. 19]. Waddington, a Britiſh ſubject,  
had occupied a brewhouſe in New-York, belonging to Rutgers, an Ame-  
rican, while the Britiſh were in poſſeſſion of New-York. During a part  
of the time, he had only permiſſion from the quarter-maſter general; for  
another part, he had an order of the commanding officer, to authorize his  
  
  
of this law of the ſtate, brought an action againſt Waddington, for rent  
and damages, in the Mayor&#x27;s ccurt of New-York. Waddington pleaded  
the treaty, and the court declared tlie trefty a juſtification, in oppoſition to  
the law of the ſtate, for that portion of the rime authorized by the com-  
mandivg officer, his authority being competent; and gave judgment for

the tent, according to the regulations of the exiſting powers. From this part — N  
and of the judgment, the defendant appealed. The firſt part, however, was an  
tiſh unequivocal decifion of the ſuperior authority of the treaty over the law.  
in The latter part could only have been founded in an opinion of the ſenſe of  
and the treaty in that part of the 6th article, which declares, © There ſhall be  
v of no future proſecutions againſt any perſon, for the part he may have taken  
der in the war, and that no perſon ſhould, on that account, ſuffer any future  
in loſs or damage in their property, &amp;c.“ They muſt have underſtood this  
ng: 2s only protecting actions, which were conformable with the laws and au-  
ary  thority exiſting at the time and place. The tenure of the defendant under  
ther the quarter-maſter general was not ſo conformable. That under the com-  
ere · manding officer was. Some may think, that murders and other crime:  
ited and offences, characteriſed, as ſuch, by the authority of the time and place,  
chat where committed, were meant to be protected by this paragraph of the  
me- treaty : and, perhaps, for peace ſake, this conſtruction may be the moſt  
om convenient. The Mayor&#x27;s court, however, ſeems to have revolted at it.  
nce The defendant appealed, and the queſtion would have been authoritatively

between the parties. See Mr. Hamilton&#x27;s ſtatement of this caſe, No. 46. No. 46.  
Is a S. 42. The ſame kind of doubt brought on the arreſt of John Smith  
the Hatfield, in New-Jerfey, whoſe caſe [E. 9.] is another ground of com-  
na- plaint in your letter. A refugee, ſent out by the Britiſh as a ſpy, was  
ur- taken within the American lines, regularly tried by a court - martial, found  
che guilty, and executed. There was one Ball, an inhabitant of the American  
ge, part of Jerſey, who, contrary to the laws of his country, was in the habit  
the of ſecretly ſupplying the Britiſh camp in Staten-Iſland with proviſions.  
hat The firſt time Ball went over, after the execution of the ſpy, of which it  
ct, does not appear he had any knowledge, and certainly no agency in his  
ne- proſecution, John Smith Hatfield, a refugee alſo from Jerſey, and ſome  
art others of the ſame deſcription, ſeized him againſt the expreſs orders cf the  
for Britiſh commanding officer, brought him out of the Britiſh lines, and  
his Hatfield hung him with his own hands. The Britiſh officer ſeat a meſſage ta  
ity the Americans, diſavowing this act, declaring that the Britiſh had nothing  
ent to do with it, and that thoſe, who had perpetrated the crime, ought alone  
cd to ſuffer for it. The right to puniſh the guilty individual ſeems to have  
to deen yielded by the one party, and accepted by the other, in exchange for  
  
m- chat of retaliation on an innocent perſon; an exchange which humanity  
would with to ſee habitual. The criminal came afterwards into the very  
neighbourhood, a member of which he had murdered. Peace, indeed, had  
how been made; but the magiſtrate, thinking probably, that it was for the

Time and conſideration are favourable to the right cauſe—precipitation to

S8. 46. You ſay again, p. 29, The few attempts to recover Britiſh  
debts, in the county courts of Virginia, have aniverſally failed, and thelk  
are the courts wherein, from the ſmallneſs of the ſum, a conſiderable  
  
  
limited amount) have uniformly reje#ed all ſuits inſtituted for the recoy  
of ſums due to the ſubjects of the crown of Great Britain.” In the  
place, the county courts, till of late, have had excluſive juriſdiction only  
of ſums below C. 10, and it is known, that a very inconſiderable propor-  
tion of the Britiſh debts conſiſts in demands below that ſum. A late law,  
we are told, requires, that actions below C. 30 ſhall be commenced in  
thoſe courts ; but allows, at the fame time, an appeal to correct any errors  
into which they may fall. In the zd place, the evidence of gentlemen  
who are in the way of knowing the fact [No. 52, 53,] is, that though  
there have been accidental checks in ſome of the ſubordinate courts, arifing  
from the chicanery of the debtors, and ſometimes, perhaps, a moment of  
error in the court itſelf, yet theſe particular inſtances have been immedi-  
ately reftificd, either in the ſame or the ſuperior court, while the great  
waſs of ſuits for the recovery of ſums due to the ſubjects of the crown of  
Great Britain have been uniformly ſuſtained to judgment and execution.  
S. 47. A much broader aſſertion is hazarded, page 29. In ſome of  
the ſouthern States, there does not exiſt a ſingle inſtance of the recovery  
of a Britiſh debt in their courts, though many years have expired ſince the  
eſtabliſhment of peace between the two countries. The particular  
  
(1733  
  
  
enquiries to all the States which could be defignated under the deſcription of  
fouthern, to wit: Maryland, and thoſe to the ſouth of that.  
  
  
  
in the ſame State, and that of Mr. Gwinn, clerk of their General Court,  
prove, that Britiſh ſuits have been maintained in the ſuperior and inferior  
courts throughout the State without any obſtruction; that Britiſh claimants  
have, in every inſtance, enjoyed every facility in the tribunals of juſtice,  
  
  
and remitted large debts, as well under contracts previous as ſubſequent  
to the war,  
  
  
greſs from that State, and lawyers of eminence in it, prove that the courts  
of law in that State have been open and freely reſorted to by the Britiſh  
creditors, who have recovered and levicd their monies without obſtruction:  
for we have no right to conſider as obſtructions &#x27;the dilatory pleas of here  
and there a debtor diſtreſſed perhaps for time, or even an accidental error  
cf opinion in a ſubordinate court, when ſuch pleas have been overruled,  
and ſuch errors corrected in a due courſe of proceeding marked out by the  
ws in ſuch caſes. The general fact ſuffices to ſhew that the aſſertion  
under examination cannot be applied to this State.  
  
In North Carolina, Mr. Johnſton, one of the ſenators for that geare, tells  
us, he has heard indeed but of few ſuits brought by Britiſh creditors in  
that State: but that he never heard that any one had failed of a recovery  
becauſe he was a Britiſh ſubject; and he names a particular caſe of Elmeſly  
r. Lee&#x27;s executors, * of the recovery of a Britiſh debt in the ſuperior court  
at Edenton. See Mr, Johnſton&#x27;s letter, No. 54.

and that the courts are open to them there as elſewhere. As to the modi-  
  
  
i ſatisfied by this equal meaſure; and if the Britiſh creditor is privileged  
by that againſt even the ſame modifications to which citizens and foreigners  
of all other nations were equally ſubjected, then the law impoſing them  
was a mere nullity.  
  
In Georgia, the letter of the ſenators and repreſentatives in congreſs,

lince the ratification of the treaty, the creditors having moſtly preferred

pected that ſome more ſpecific arrangements, as to the manner of liquida-  
ting, and times of paying Britiſh debts, would have been ſettled in the defi-  
nitive treaty, No. 58, ſhews that ſuch arrangements were under contempla-  
tion. And the judge ſeems to have been of opinion, that it was neceſſary  
the treaty ſhould be defiritively conciuded, before it could become a law of

that, till that notification, it was not a law authori ſing a ſubject of Eng-

eſtabliſhment of peace between the two countries.” It is evident from  
the preceding teſtimony, that many ſuits have been brought, and with ef-  
ſect: yet it has often been matter of ſurpriſe that more were not brought,  
zod earlier, fince it is moſt certain that the courts would have ſuſtained  
their ations, and given them judgments, This abſtinence on the part of  
the creditors has excited a ſuſpicion that they wiſhed rather to recur to  
the treaſury of their own country; and to have colour for this, they would  
have it believed that there were obſtructions here to the bringing their  
ſuits, Their teſtimony is in fact the ſole, to which your court till now  
has given acceſs, Had the opportunity now preſented been given us  
  
  
States, whenever the creditors would chuſe that recourſe, and would preſs,  
if neceſſary, to the higheſt tribunals, would be found as open to their ſuits,  
and as imparti al to their ſubjects, as theirs to ours,  
  
S. 50. There is an expreſſion in your letter, pa. 7, that “ Britſh cre-  
ditors have not been countenanced or ſupported, either by the reſpettive  
legiſlatures, or by the ſtate courts, in their endeavours to recover the full  
value of debts contracted antecedently to the treaty of peace.” And again,  
in page 8, In many of the ſtates, the ſubjects of the crown, in endea-  
rouring to obtain the reſtitution of their forfeited eſtates and property,  
have been treated with indignity.” From which an inference might be  
drawn, which I am ſure you did not intend, to wit, That the creditors  
  
  
not protected by the laws of the country. I recolle&amp; to have heard of one  
or two attempts, by popular collections, to deter the profecution of Bri-  
th claims. One of theſe is mentioned in No. 49. But theſe were im-  
mediately on the cloſe of the war, while its paſſions had not yet had time  
to ſubſide, and while the aſhes of our houſes were ftill ſmoking. Since  
that, ſay for many years paſt, nothing like popular interpoſition, on this  
ſubject, has been heard of, in any part of our land. There is no country  
which is not ſometimes ſubject to irregular interpoſitions of the people. There  
  
  
has leſs of this to reproach itſelf with than the United States, nor any  
where the laws have a more regular courſe, or are more habitually and  
cheerfully acquieſeed in. Confident that your own obſervation and in-  
formation will have ſatisfied you of this truth, T rely that the inference

15 Reerimina- S. 52. In drawing a compariſon between the proceedings of Great-Bri-  
4 * tain and the United States, you ſay, page 35, The conduct of Great-  
&#x27; courts, Britain, in all theſe reſpects, has been widely different from that which has  
  
„ *

pm  
a *- 0:  
  
been obſerved by the United States. In the courts of law of the former coun.  
try, the citizens of the United States have experienced, &lt;v/thout exception, the  
  
. fame protection and impartial diſtribution of juſtice, as the ſubjects of the  
&quot;It crown.” No nation can anſwer for perfect exactitude of proceedings in  
all their inferior courts. It ſuffices to provide a ſupreme judicature, where  
all error and partiality will be ultimately corrected. With this qualifica-  
tion, we have heretofore Leen in the habit of conſidering the adminiſtration of  
juſtice in Great-Britain as extremely pure. With the ſame qualification,  
we have no fear to riſk every thing which a nation holds dear, on the aſ-  
ſertion, that the adminiſtration of juſtice here will be found equally pure.  
When the citizens of either party complain of the judiciary proceedings of  
the other, they naturally preſent but one ſide of the caſe to view, and are,  
therefore, to be liſtened to with caution. Numerous condemnations have  
taken place in your courts, of veſſels taken from us after the expirations  
of the terms of one and two months ſtipulated in the armiſtice. The State  
of Maryland has been making ineffectual efforts, for nine years, to recover  
a ſum of C. 55,000 ſterling, lodged in the Bank of England previous to  
the war. A judge of the King&#x27;s Bench lately declared, in the caſe of  
Greene, an American citizen, v. Buchanan and Charnock, Britiſh ſubject,  
that a citizen of the United States, who has delivered C. 43,000 ſterling  
worth of Eaſt-Iudia goods to a Britiſh a at Oſtend, receiving  
C. e  
  
(97)  
  
C. 18,000 in part payment, is not entitled to maintain an action for the  
balance in a court of Great- Britain, though his debtor is found there, is in  
cuſtody of the court, and acknowledges the facts. Theſe caſes appear  
firong to us. If your judges have done wrong in them, we expect redreſs:  
if right, we expect explanations, Some of them have already been laid  
before your court: the others will be ſo, in due time. Theſe, and fuch  
a+ theſe, are the ſmaller matters between the two nations, which, in my  
letter of Dec. 15, I had the honour to intimate, that it would be better to  
refer for ſettlement through the ordinary channel of our miniſters, than  
embarraſs the preſent important diſcuſſions with them. Such caſes will  
be conſtantly produced by a colliſion of intereſts in the dealings of indivi-  
duals, and will be eafily adjuſted by a readineſs to do right on both ſides,  
regardleſs of party. Ro Pg  
  
S. 53. It is made an objection to the proceedings of our legiſlative and  
judiciary bodies, that they have refuſed to allow intereſt to run on debts  
during the courſe of the war. The deciſion of the right to this, reſts with  
the judiciary alone; neither the legiſlative nor the executive having any  
authority to intermeddle. |  
  
The adminiſtration of juſtice is a branch of the ſovereignty over a  
country, and belongs excluſively to the nation inhabiting it. No foreign  
power can pretend to participate ia their juriſdiftion, or that their citizens  
received there are not ſubject to it. When a cauſe has been adjudged  
according to the rules and forms of the country, its juſtice ought to be  
preſumed, Even error in the higheſt court which has been provided as  
the laſt means of correcting the errors of others, and whoſe decrees are  
therefore ſubject to no further reviſal, is one of thoſe inconveniences  
lou ing from the imperfection of our faculties, to which every ſociety  
muſt ſubmit; becauſe there muſt be ſomewhere a laſt reſort, wherein con»

tiſh courts. -  
  
III. Intereft,  
  
  
ber muſt ill be finite, and they muſt finiſh in the hands of fallible men  
as judges, If the error be evident, palpable, et in re minime dubia, it  
then indeed aſſumes another form ; it excites preſumption that it was not  
mere error, but premeditated wrong; and the foreigner, as well as native,  
ſulfering by the wrong, may reaſonably complain, as for a wrong com-  
mitted in any other way, In ſuch caſe, there being no redreſs in the  
ordinary forms of the country, a foreign prince may liſten to complaint  
from his ſubjects injured by the adjudication; may enquire into its prin-  
  
  
wrong, take his meaſures of redreſs by repriſal, or by a refuſal of right  
  
* In @ matter /uſerftible of no doubt.  
  
  
  
  
  
0,70 )  
  
even if it be againſt law, but not in that groſs, evident, and palpable degree  
which proves it to flow from the wickednefs of the heart, and not error of  
the head in the judges, then is it no cauſe for juſt complaint, much leſt  
for a refuſal of right, or ſelf-redreſs in any other way. The reaſons on  
which the denial of intereſt is grounded ſhall be ſtared ſummarily, yet  
ſaſkciently to juſtify the integrity of the judge, and even to induce a pre-  
ſumption that they might be extended to that of his ſcience alſo, were that  
material to the preſent object. |  
  
8. 54. The treaty is the text of the law in the its Wie and its  
words arc, that there ſhall be no lawful impediment to the recovery of  
bona fide debts. Nothing is ſaid of imereft on thoſe debts: and the ſole  
queſtion is, whether, where a debt is given, intereft thereon flows from the  
general principles of the law? Intereſt is not a part of the debt, but  
fomething added to the debt by way of damage for the detention of it  
This is the definition of the Engliſh lawyers themſelves, who ſay, © In-  
tereſt is recovered by way of damages, ratione detentionis debiti. 2 Salk,  
622, 623. Formerly all intereſt was conſidered as unlawful in every  
  
tries little commercial. From this, as a general rule, a few ſpecial cafes  
ore excepted. In France, particularly, the exceptions are thoſe of minors,  
marriage portions, and money the price of lands. So thoroughly do their  
laws condemn the allowance of intereſt, that a party who has paid it  
voluntarily, may recover it back again whenever he pleaſes. Yet this has  
never been taken up as a groſs and flagrant denial of juſtice, authorifmg  
national complaint againſt thoſe governments. In England alſo, all intereſt  
was againſt law, till the Stat. 37 H. 8. c. 9. the growing ſpirit of com-  
merce, no longer reſtrained by the principles of the Roman church, then  
firſt degan to tolerate it. The ſame cauſes produced the ſame eſſect in  
  
But even in England the allowance of intereſt is not given by expreſs law,  
but reſts on the diſcretion of judges and juries, as the arbiters of damages.  
Sometimes the judge has enlarged the intereſt to 20 per cent. per annum.  
( Chanc. Rep. 57.) In other caſes he fixes it habitually one per cent.  
lower than the legal rate (2 Te. Atk. 343); and in a multitude of cafes  
he refuſes it altogether. As for inſtance, no intereſt is allowed,

different : his words, Dougl. 376. That intereſt might be payable iu  
&#x27; caſes of delay, if a jury, in their diſcretion, ſhall think fit to allow it”  
And the doctrine in Giles v. Hart, 2 Salk. 622. that damages, or intereſt,  
ire but an acceſſary to the debt, which may be barred by circumſtances  
which do not touch the debt itſelf, ſuffice to prove that intereſt is not a  
part of the debt, neither comprehended in tha thing, nor in the term; that  
words, which paſs the debt, do not give intereſt necgffarily ; that the intereſt  
depends altogether on the di/cretion of the judges and jurors, who with |  
-overn themſelves by all exiſting ciroumſtances ill take the legal intereſt  
or the meaſure of their damages, or more or leſs, as they think right—will  
ge it from the date of the contract, or from a year afrer—or deny it altoge -  
ther, according as the fault or the ſufferings of the one or the other party  
hall dictate. Our laws are, generally, an adoption of yours: and I do  
ict know that any of the States have changed them in this particular.  
But there is one rule of your and our law, which, while it proves that  
ery title of debt is liable to a difallowance of intereſt under ſpecial cir-  
cumſtances, is fo applicable to our caſe, that I ſhall cite it as a text, and &#x27;  
pply to it the circumſtances of our caſe, It is laid down in Vin. Abr.  
Inereſt, c. 7. and 2 Abr. Eq. $293, and elſewhere, in theſe words :  
Where, by a general and national calamity, nothing is made out of lands  
vlich are aſſigned for payment of intereſt, it ought not to run on during  
* time of ſuch calamity.” &quot;This is exactly the caſe in queſtion. - Can 1  
more  
  
Tf a0 *} |  
more general national calamity be conceived than that univerſal devaſtatian  
. which took place, in many of theſe States, during the war? Was it ever  
more exactly the caſe any where, bat nothing was made wut of the  
lands which were to pay the intereſt? The produce of thoſe lands, for  
want of the opportunity of expaxang it ſafely, was down to almoſt nothing  
in real money, e. g. Tobacco was leſs than a dollar the hundred weight,  
Imported articles of clothing or conſumption were from 4 to 8 times their  
vſual price. A buſhcl of falt was uſually fold for 1001b. of tobacco. At  
the ſame time theſe lands, and other property, in which the money of the  
Britiſh creditors was veſted, were paying high taxes for their own protec-  
tion; and the debtor, as nominal holder, ſtood ultimate inſurer of their  
value to the creditor, who was the real proprietor, becauſe they were  
bought with his money. And who will eſtimate /the value of this  
inſurance, or ſay what would have been the forfeit, in a contrary event of  
the war? Who will ſay that the riſk of the property was not worth the  
intereſt of its price? General calamity then prevented profit, and conſe-  
quently ſtopped intereſt, which is in lieu of profit. The creditor ſays,  
indeed, he has laid out of his money; he has therefore loſt the uſe of it,  
The debtor. replies, that if the creditor has loſt, he has not gained it:  
that this may be a queſtion between two parties, both of whom hare  
| loft,” In that caſe the courts will not double the loſs of the one, to fave  
all loſs from the other. That it is a rule of natural, as well as municipal  
  
law, that, in queſtions de damno evitando melior eſt conditio poſſidentis.  
If this maxim be juſt where each party is equally innocent, how much  
more ſo where the loſs has been produced by the act of the creditor ? For  
a nation, as a ſociety, forms à moral perſon, and every member of it is  
perſonally reſponſible for his ſociety. It was the act of the lender, or of  
his nation, which annihilated the prafits of the money lent ; he cannot  
then demand profits which he either prevented from coming into  
exiſtence, or burnt or otherwiſe deſtroyed after they were produced. It  
then there be no inſtrument or title of debt ſo formal and ſacred 33  
to give right to intereſt under all poffible circumſtances, and if &amp;r-  
cumſtances of exemption, ſtronger than in the preſent caſe, cannot poſſibly  
he found, then no inſtrument or title of debt, however formal or  
facred, can give right to intereſt under the circumſtances of our caſe, Li  
us preſent the queſtion-in another point of view. Your own law forbade  
the payment of intereſt when it forbade the receipt of American  
produce into Great-Britain, and made that produce fair prize on in  
way from the debtor to the creditor, or to any other for his uſe and reim-  
burſement. All perſonal acceſs between creditor and debtor was made  
  
illegal: and the debtor who endeavoured to make a remitment of his deb

hand: for two out, of three veſſels were generally taken by the creditor  
nation, and ſometimes by the creditor himſelf, as many of them turned  
their trading veſſels into privateers. Where no place has been agreed on  
for the payment of a debt, the laws of England oblige the debtor to ſeek  
his creditor whereſqever he is to be found within the realm; Coke Lit.  
210. b. but do not bind him to go out of the realm in ſearch of him.  
This is our law too. The firſt a, generally, of the creditors and their  
agents here, was to withdraw from the United States with their books  
  
  
render payment impoſſible, either of the principal or intereſt, makes it  
like the common caſe of a tender and refuſal of money, after which in-  
tereſt ſtops both by your laws and ours. We ſee toe from the letter of  
Mr. Adams, June 16, 1786, No. 37, that the Britiſh Secretary for fo-  
reign affairs was ſenſible, that a Britiſh ſtatute having rendered criminal  
all intercourſe between the debtor and creditor, had placed the article of  
inereſt on a different footing from the principal. And the letter of our  
Plenipotentiaries to Mr. Hartley, the Britiſh Plenipotentiary for form-  
ing the definitive treaty, No. $8, fhews that the omiſſion to expreſs in/ereft  
in the treaty was not merely an overſight of the parties ; that its allow-  
ance was conſidered by our plenipotentiaries as a thing not to be intended  
in the treaty, was declared againſt by Congreſs, and that declaration com-  
municated to Mr. Hartley. After ſuch an explanation, the omiſſion is a  
proof of acquieſcence, and an intention not to claim it. It appears then,  
that the debt, and intereſt on that debt, are ſeparate things in every country,  
and under ſeparate rules. That in every country a de% 1s recoverable,  
while, in moſt countries, intereſt is refuſed in all caſes ; . in others, given  
or refuſed, diminiſhed or augmented, at the diſcretion of the judge; no  
where given in all caſes. indiſcriminately, and conſequently no where ſo  
incorporated with the debt, as to paſs with that ex vi termini, or otherwiſe  
to be conſidered as a determinate and veſtat thing.  
  
While the taking intereft on money has thus been coofidered i in ſome  
countries as morally wrong in all caſes, in others made legally right but  
in particular caſes, the taking profits from lands, or rents in lieu of profits,  
has been allowed every where, and ar all times, both in morality and law.  
Hence it is laid down as a general rule, Wolf, ſ. 229.: Si quis fundum  
alienum poſſidet, domini eſt quantum valet uſus fundi, et poſſeſſoris quan-  
tum valet ejus cultura et cura. But even in the caſe of lands reſtored by  
  
  
a treaty,  
  
  
SLE |  
  
a ſores, che arrears of profits or rents are never reftered; unleſs they by  
particularly ſtipulated. *+ Si res vi pacis reſiſtuendae, reſtituend+ quoque  
ſunt fructus à die conceffionis,” ſays Wolf, f. 1224. And Grotius, «Cui  
pace res conceditur, ei et fruftus conce duntur à tempore conceſſionts&#x27;t  
NON RETRO.“ L. 3. c. 20. \. 22. To place the right to intereſt ol  
money on a level with the righ: to profits on laud, is placing it more ad-  
vantageouſly than has been hitherto authorized; and if, as we have ſeen,  
8 ſtipulation to icſtore lands docs not include à ſtipulation to reſtore the  
back profits, we may certainly conclude a fortiori that the reftitution an  
does not include an allowance of back interq on them.  
  
Theſe reaſons, and others like theſe, have probably operated on he dif-  
ferent courts to produce deciſions that no intereſt ſhould run during the  
  
time this general and national calamity laſted. * And they ſeem ſufficient, at  
leaſt, to reſcue their deciſions from that flagrant denial of right, which can  
alone authorize one nation to come forward with complaints againſt the  
  
  
8. 55. The ſtates have been uniform in the allowance of intereſt before  
and ſince the war, but not of that claimed during the war, Thus we  
know by [E 1.] the caſe of Neatc&#x27;s executors v. Sands in New-York,  
and Mildred v. Dorſey in Maryland, that in thoſe ſtates, intereft during  
the war is diſallowed by the courts. By {D. 8.] 1784, May, che act re-  
lating to debts due to perſons who have been, and remained within the  
enemy&#x27;s power or lines during the late war. That Connecticut left it to their  
  
  
or to leave it to referees ; by [E. 2 the cafe of Oſborne v. Mifflin&#x27;s execu-  
tors, and [E. 3.] Hare v. Allen, explained in the letter of Mr. Rawls,  
attorney of the United States, No. 59. And by the letter of Mr. Lewis,  
judge of the diſtrict court of the United States, No. 60, that in Pennſylva-  
nia the rule is, that where ncither the creditor nor any agent was within  
the ſtare, no intereſt was allowed; where either remained, they gave in-  
tereſt, In all the other ſtates I believe it is left diſcretionary in the courts  
and juries, In Maſſachuſetts the practice has varied, n November, 1784.  
  
  
Congreſs, whether they underſtood the word * debrs in the treaty as in-  
cluding intereſt ? and whether it is their opinion, that intereſt during the  
war ſhould be paid? and at the ſame time they paſs [ D. .] the act directing

the United States, at their ſeffions at in 1790, determined in like manner  
  
that intereſt ſnould be allowed during the war. So that on the whole, we ſee  
  
that, in one ſtate, intereſt during the war is given in every caſe, in another  
  
it is given wherever the creditor, or any agent for him, remained in the

S. 36. I have, by way of PRELIMINARY, placed out of the preſent diſ-  
Ae cuſſion, all acts and proceedings RIO to the TREATY or AR,  
i&quot; conſidering them as ſettled by that inſtrument, and that the then ſtate of  
ork, THINGS was adopted by the parties,  
ring With ſuch alterations only as that inſtrument provided.  
Fre. I have then taken up the $UBSEQUENT ACTS and PROCEEDINGS, of  
dhe which you complain as infractions, diſtributing them according to their  
Meir ſubjects, to wit:  
aity, I. EXILE AND CONFISCATIONS,

WIL, III. INTEREST.  
&quot;Wis, |  
m. 1. EXILE AND CONPISCATIONS. After premifing, that theſe are lawful  
thin Acts of war, | have ſhewn that the sth article was RECOMMENDA-  
mY TORY only, its ſtipulations being, not to reffore the, confiſcations and  
FR exiles, but to recommend to the ſtate legiſlatures&#x27;to reſtore them.  
a That this word, having but one meaning, eſtabliſhes the intent of the  
16 parties; and moreover, that it was particularly explamed by the  
1 American negociators, that the legiſlatures would be free to comply  
he with the recommendation or not, and probably would not comply.  
* That the Britiſh negoc/ators ſo underſtood it:  
5 That the Britiſh uin ſo underſtood it:  
  
And the members of both houſes of parliament, as well thoſe who ap-  
no be proved, as who diſapproved, the article. 2  
T have ſhewn, that Congreſs did recommend earneſtly and bona fide :

M a / ing

ing to circumſtances, but more of them, and in a is Ghai than  
_ was expected.  
  
And that compenſation, by the Britiſh treaſury, to Britiſh ſufferers, was  
the alternative of her own choice, our negociators having offered to  
do that, if ſhe would compenſate ſuch loſſes as we had fuſtained by  
acts unauthoriſed by the modern and moderate principles of war.  
  
order had been received for the evacuation, Aug. 13, 1783.  
  
None had been received May 10, 1784.  
  
None had been received July 13, 1784.  
  
F From whence I conclude none had ever been giver,  
  
* 4 And thence, that none had ever been intended. |  
  
ES In the latter caſe, this infraction would date from the ſignature of the  
  
| treaty. But founding it on the 0! giving the order with convenient  
bw ſpeed, it dates from April, 1753, when the order for evacuating New  
  
2 5 York was given, as there can be no reaſon why it ſhould have been  
inconvenient to give this order as early.  
  
The IxFRACTI10N then, reſpecting the upper Posrs, was before the  
treaty was known in America.  
  
That reſpecting the negroes, was as ſoon as it was known.

either courts or creditors are overawed by them in their proceedings,  
  
  
That the decifion, whether it all or ſhall not be allowed during the  
dvar, reſts, by our conſtitution, with the courts altogether. ©  
  
That if theſe have generally decided againſt the allowance, the&#x27;reaſon  
of their deciſion appear ſo weighty, as to clear them from the charge  
of that palpable degree of wrong, which may authoriſe national com-  
plaint, or give a right of refuſing execution of the treaty, by way of  
  
repriſal.  
  
To vindicate them, I have ſtated aF It ſome of the reaſons which  
- ſupport their opinion.  
  
That IvTEREST DURING THE WAR Was not wm given. by the  
rreaty :  
  
That the revival of DEBTs did not ex vi i give intereſt on them:  
  
That intereſt is not a part of the debt, but damages wn  
the debt:  
  
That it is diſallowed habitually in moſt countries:  
  
Vet has never been deemed a ground of national complaint again  
  
them: N  
That in England al ſo, it was formerly unlawful in all caſes :  
  
  
protect from it a great part of the tranſaQtions of life:  
  
That, in fact, there is not a ſingle ile to debt, fo formal and nee,  
to give a right to INTEREST, under all poſſible circumſtances, eithe  
there or here.  
  
That of theſe circumſtances, judges and jvrors are to Aude in their d  
cretion, and are accordingly in the habit of ugmenting, diminiſhing  
or refuſing intereſt, in every caſe, according to their diſcretion :  
  
That the circumſtances againſt the allowance are unqueſtionably of the  
ſtrongeſt in our caſe : ;  
  
That a great national ca /amity rendering the lands e which  
were to pay the intereſt, has been adjudged a ſufficient cauſe, 0  
itſelf, to ſuſpend intereſt :  
  
That were both plaintiff and defendant equally innocent of that *  
  
The queſtion, Who ſhould avoid 1:ſs &gt; would be in favour of the x  
in poſſeſſion:  
  
And a fortiori in his favour, where the calamity was produced by .  
act of the demandant :  
  
That, moreover, the laws of the party creditor had cut off the pn |  
acceſs of his debtor ; N  
  
( 87 »  
  
Aud the —ä— — Fae ee,  
  
crediror; or to any other for him: q  
  
And were the creditor” prevents payment both of: gene an ae  
INTEREST, the latter, at leaſt, is juſtly extinguiſhed%; ?: ;  
  
That the departure of the creditor, leaving no agent in the country of  
the debtor, would have ſtopped intereſt of itſelf;  
  
The debtor not being obliged to go our of the country to ſeek him :  
  
That the Britiſh miniſter was heretofore ſenſible of his: welglt of the  
objeCtions to the claim of intereſt :  
  
That the detlararions of Congrefs, and our plenipotentiaries, previous  
to the definitive treaty, and the filence of that inftrament, afford proof  
that intereſt was not intended, on our part, l on the  
other:  
  
That were we to admit intereſt on money to equal fivoar with  
profits on land, arrears of profits would not be demandable in the  
preſent caſe, nor conſequently arrears of intereſt :  
  
And, on the whole, without undertaking to ſay what the law is, which  
is not the province of the executive,  
  
We ſay, that the reaſons of thoſe judges who deny” intereſt Goring the  
war, appear ſufficiently cogent,  
  
To account for their opinion on honeft principles:  
  
To exempt it from rhe * of palpable end flagrant 1 in re |  
minime dubia :  
  
And to take away all pretence of withholding execution of the treaty,  
by way of repriſal for that cauſe. |  
  
—  
  
S. 57. I have now, Sir, gone through the ſeveral acts and proceedings  
enumerated in your Appendix, as infractions of the treaty z omitting, I  
believe, not a ſingle one, as may be ſeen by a table hereto ſubjoined,  
wherein every one of them, as marked and numbered in your Appendix,  
is referred to the ſection of this letter, in which it is brought In  
the reſult has been, as you have ſeen,  
  
1. That there was no abtolute ctipulation to reſtore antecedent confiſcs-  
tions, and that none ſub/equent took place.  
  
2. That the recovery of the debts was obſtructed validly in none of our  
ſtates, in valialy only in a few, and that not till long after the infractions  
committed on che other ſide; and  
  
3. That the decifions of courts and juries againſt the claims of intereſt  
are too probably founded to give cauſe, for queſtioning their integrity.  
Theſe things being evident, I cannot but flatter myſelf, after the aſſu-  
  
0 wm,  
  
(8) »  
rances received from you of his Britannie Majeſty&#x27;s deſire to remove  
every occaſion of miſunderſtanding from between us, that an end will now  
  
  
execution of the treaty as circumſtances render practicable at this late  
day: That it is to be done fo late has been the ſource of heavy loſſes of  
blood and treaſure to the United States. Still our deſire of friendly accom-  
modation is, and has been conſtant. No lawful impediment has been  
oppoſed to the proſecution of the juſt rights of your citizens.” Andif any  
  
  
tribunals, they would, like other unlawful proceedings, have been over-  
ruled on an appeal to the higher courts. If not over-ruled there, 2  
complaint to the government would have been regular, and their inter-  
ference probably effectual. If your citizens would not proſecute their  
rights, it was impoſſible they ſhould recover them, or be denied recovery;  
  
  
the execution of which is too important to us ever to be diſpenſed with,  
Theſe difficulties being removed from between the two nations, I am  
perſuaded the intere/rs of both will be found in the ſtricteſt friendſhip.  
  
The conſiderations which lead to it are too numerous and forcible to fail
