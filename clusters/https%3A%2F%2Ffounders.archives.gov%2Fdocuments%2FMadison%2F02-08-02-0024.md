 the Kind he stated. I told him that our government was not disposed to give his trouble on that point, tho’ it could have no motive to enter into any stipulation respecting it: that its whole conduct during the war had been frien⟨d⟩ly and conciliating; that he had not heard of any measu⟨res⟩ taken with the neutral powers, which ought to excite a je⟨a⟩lousy of our views, or create a suspicion that the Presid⟨ent⟩ was disposed to embarrass them in such cases: On the co⟨n⟩trary that I could assure him, if the objects to which the a⟨r⟩ticles in the project extended were secured, that none others would be thought of. We then proceeded to examin⟨e⟩ the convention respecting the boundaries in the light in which the ratification by the President presented it. On that subject also I omitted nothing which the documents in my possession enabled me to say; in aid of which I thought it adviseable, a few days afterwards, to send to his Lordship a note explanatory of the motives which induc’d the President &amp; Senate to decline ratifying the 5th. article. As the affair had become by that circumstance in some degree a delicate one, and as it was in its nature intricate, I thought it improper to let the explanation which I had given rest on the memory of a single individual. By committing it to paper it might be better understood by Lord Harrowby &amp; by the cabinet to whom he will doubtless submit it. As I send you a copy of that paper it is useless to detail the substance of what passed between us on the subject of it. I sent him at the same time an abstract of the impressments, which Mr. Erving had furnished me, which had taken place since my communication to Lord Hawkesbury. As Mr. Erving gives you regular and correct information on that head, I do not annex it to this communication.
