shness and Purity in the Air, the bright blue of the sky, the sweet Warblings of a great Variety of Birds intermingling with the martial Clarions of an hundred Cocks now within my Hearing, all conspire to chear the Spirits.  
This kind of puerile Description is a very pretty Employment for an old Fellow whose Brow is furrowed with the Cares of Politicks and War.  
I shall be on Horseback in a few Minutes, and then I shall enjoy the Morning, in more Perfection.  
I spent last Evening at the War-Office, with General Arnold. . . . He has been basely slandered and libelled. The Regulars say, “he fought like Julius Caesar.”  
I am wearied to Death with the Wrangles between military officers, high and low. They Quarrell like Cats and Dogs. They worry one another like Mastiffs. Scrambling for Rank and Pay like Apes for Nutts.  
I believe there is no one Principle, which predominates in human Nature so much in every stage of Life, from the Cradle to the Grave,
