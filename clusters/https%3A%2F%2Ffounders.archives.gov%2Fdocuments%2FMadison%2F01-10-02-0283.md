[8 February 1788]  
From the more general enquiries pursued in the four last papers, I pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts of the government. I shall begin with the house of representatives.  
  
The first view to be taken of this part of the government, relates to the qualifications of the electors and the elected. Those of the former are to be the same with those of the electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures. The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government. It was incumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and establish this right in the constitution. To have left it open for the occasional regulation of the congress, would have been improper for the reason just mentioned. To have submitted it to the legislative discretion of the states, would have been improper for the same reason; and for the additional reason, that it would have rendered too dependent on the state governments, that branch of the federal government, which ought to be dependent on the people alone. To have reduced the different qualifications in the different states to one uniform rule, would probably have been as dissatisfactory to some of the states, as it would have been difficult to the convention. The provision made by the convention appears therefore, to be the best that lay within their option. It must be satisfactory to every state; because it is conformable to the standard already established, or which may be established by the state itself. It will be safe to the United States; because, being fixed by the state constitutions, it is not alterable by the state governments, and it cannot be feared that the people of the states will alter this part of their constitutions, in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured to them by the federal constitution.  
The qualifications of the elected being less carefully and properly defined by the state constitutions, and being at the same time more susceptible of uniformity, have been very properly considered and regulated by the convention. A representative of the United States must be of the age of twenty-five years; must have been seven years a citizen of the United States; must at the time of his election, be an inhabitant of the state he is to represent, and during the time of his service must be in no office under the United States. Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.  
The term for which the representatives are to be elected, falls under a second view which may be taken of this branch. In order to decide on the

rst. As it is essential to liberty, that the government in general should have a common interest with the people; so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with the people. Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured. But what particular degree of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose, does not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation: And must depend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be connected.

 Have we any reason to infer from the spirit and conduct of the representatives of the people, prior to the revolution, that biennial elections would have been dangerous to the public liberties? The spirit which every where displayed itself at the commencement of the struggle; and which vanquished the obstacles to independence, is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion of liberty had been every where enjoyed to inspire both a sense of its worth, and a zeal for its proper enlargement. This remark holds good as well with regard to the then colonies, whose elections were least frequent, as to those whose elections were most frequent. Virginia was the colony which stood first in resisting the parliamentary usurpations of Great-Britain; it was the first also in espousing by public act, the resolution of independence. In Vi

 in no danger from biennial elections.  
The conclusion resulting from these examples will be not a little strengthened by recollecting three circumstances. The first is, that the federal legislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative authority which is vested completely in the British parliament, and which, with a few exceptions, was exercised by the colonial assemblies and the Irish legislature. It is a received and well founded maxim, that, where no other circumstances affect the case, the greater the power is, the shorter ought to be its duration; and conversely, the smaller the power, the more safely may its duration be protracted. In the second place, it has, on another occasion, been shewn that the federal legislature will not only be restrained by its dependence on the people, as other legislative bodies are; but that it will be moreover watched and controled by the several collateral legislatures, which other legislative bodies are not. And in the third place, no comparison can be made between the means that will be possessed by the more permanent branches of the federal government for seducing, if they should be disposed to seduce, the house of representatives from their duty to the people; and the means of influence over the popular branch, possessed by the other branches of the governments above cited. With less power therefore

of the Federalist may serve to explain the nature of the em-  
barrassments, under which the Convention legislated in this  
respect, although it furnishes us with no argument in favour  
of the intrinsic wisdom of the provision which was adopted.  
  
“ The definition of the right of suffrage,” says General Hamilton, “is  
very justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government. It  
was incumbent on the Convention therefore to define, and establish this  
right in the constitution. To have left it open for the occasional regulation of  
congress, would have been improper for the reason just mentioned. To have  
submitted it to the legislative discretion of the states would have been im-  
proper for the same reason. To have reduced the different qualifications in  
the different states to one uniform rule would probably have been as dissa-  
tisfactory to some of the states, as it would have been difficult to the Con.  
vention. The provisions made by the Convention appear therefore to have  
been the best that lay within their option. It must be satisfactory to every  
state, because being fixed by the constitution, it isnot alterable by the state  
governments, and it cannot be apprehended that the people of the states will  
alter this part of their constitution in such a manner as to abridge the rights  
secured to them by the Federal constitution.”  
  
Although we believe that the framers of the constitution  
would, if they had been at full liberty so to do, have com-  
mitted to the federal government, the right of determining  
the qualifications of its electors, still we can discover very  
sufficient reasons, why they did not consider this as a matter  
of very deep concern to the Union. Universal suffrage, the  
worst of the possible consequences of the actual provision, ma

the most accredited expounders of the Constitution, that |  
  
Webster, in his dictionary, defines a * citizen” to be, “in  
the United States, a person, native or naturalized, who has  
the privilege of exercising the elective franchise, or the  
qualifications which enable him to vote for rulers and to pur-  
chase and hold real estate:’’ elsewhere, he says, * the right  
to vote for Governors, Senators, and Representatives, is a  
franchise enjoyed by citizens, and not belonging to aliens.”  
Mr. Madison said, (see The Federalist, p.248:) “ The defi-  
nition of the right of suilrage is very justly regarded as a  
fundamental! article of republican government. It was in-  
cumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and estab-  
lish this right in the Constitution.”? And this they accord-  
ingly did in the second section of the first article, as fol-  
lows:  
  
“The House of Representatives shall be composed Of |  
  
members chosen every second year by the people of the  
several States, and the electors in each State shall have the  
qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous  
branch of the State Legislature.”’

Madison discusses at large those clauses of

disposed of the first branch of his subject, he  
proceeds to say:  
&quot;The qualifications of the elected being less

be what they then were under the State con­  
stitutions. The regulation of the suffrage was  
not left to legislation either State or nat&#x27;onai.  
The comment on this section In the Federal­  
ist Is conclusive on this point. We copy from  
No. 52, written by Madison:  
  
The definition of the right of suffrage is very  
justly regarded as a fundamental article of re­  
publican government. It was incumbent on  
the convention,therefore, to define and estab­  
lish this tight in the Constitulon. To have left  
it open for the occasional regulation of the Con­  
gress would have been Improper, for the reason  
lust mentioned. To have submitted it to the  
legislative discretion ot the States would have  
been improper for the same reason, and for  
the additional reason, that it would have  
rendered too dependent on the State govern­  
ments that branch of the Federal government  
which ought to be dependent on the people  
alone. To have reduced the different qualifica­  
tions in the different States to one uniform rule,  
would probably have been as dissatisfactory to  
some ol the States as it would have been diffi­  
cult to the convention. The provision made by  
the convention appears therefore to be the best  
that lay within their option. It must be satis­  
factory to every State, because it is conformable  
to the standard already established or which mau  
be established by the State itself. It will be safe  
to the United States, because being fixed by  
the State constitutions it is not alterable by  
the State governments, and it cannot be feared  
that the people of the States will alter this part  
of their constitutions in such a manner as to  
abridge the rights secured to them by the Fed­  
eral constitution.

which is the rigid of initiating the law in re­  
spect to sull&#x27;rage. The same result is clear, I  
think, from the last clause of the quotation  
made bv the Press. Alter the observation  
that the provisions of the constitution will lie

affirmed, that the power over elections is in the first instance  
in the States, but that it is subject to the control and revision  
  
of the General Government (i. e. of Congress) in certain  
cases which we have already pointed out. These papers and  
  
debates are all consistent with themselves and with each  
other upon this hypothesis, but are utterly irreconcilable with  
any other.  
  
Mr. Madison says, in the Federalist —paper No. 52—  
“* The definition of the rights of suffrage is justly regarded as  
a fundamental article of republican government.” If so, it  
follows that, as the United States is required to guarantee  
  
republican governments to the States, whenever in this “ fun-  
damental article”’ of suffrage the States have made unconsti-  
  
tutional provisions, their work must be corrected by the for-  
  
mer. No other conclusion seems possible; and this is  
entirely consistent with all the essential rights of the States,  
‘among which is the right of initiating the law in respect to  
suffrage. After observing that the provisions of the Consti-  
tution will be safe for the United States, Mr. Madison adds,  
“and it cannot be feared the people of the States will alter  
this part of their Constitutions in such mannez as to abridge  
the rights secured to them by the federal Constitution.” What  
were these rights? There were none more important or val-

at any time alter its Constitution so as to abridge this right,

the United States, and conseqgently void, as contended for |  
  
by the plaintiff in this case, we have really only to exam-  
ine this single point: Does the constitution of the United  
States recognize the right of suffrage, as belonging to its  
citizens ?  
  
Future generations will look with astonishment at the  
fact that such a question could be asked seriously. Not  
only was the subject debated in the convention that framed  
the instrument, but one of its ablést members, Alexander  
Hamilton in the 52d number of the Federalist, says: “The  
definition ot the right of suffrage is very justly regarded  
as a fundamental article of republican government. It was  
incumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and estab-  
lish this right in the constitution. To have left it open for the  
occasional regulation of the Congress, would have been  
improper for the reason just mentioned. To have sub-  
witted it to the legislative discretion of the states, would  
  
  
  
have been improper for the same reason ; and for the ad-  
ditional reason, that it would have rendered too dependent  
on the state governments, that branch of the federal gov-  
ernment, which ought to be dependent on the people alone.  
To have reduced the different qualifications in the different  
states to one uniform rule, would probably have been as  
dissatisfactory to some of the states, as it would have been  
difficult to the convention. The provision made by the  
convention appears, therefore, to be the best that lay  
within their option. It must be satisfactory to every state ;  
because it is conformable to the standard already estab-  
lished, or which may be established by the state itself. It  
will be safe to the United States; because, being fixed by  
the state constitutions, it is not alterable by the state gov-  
ernments, and it can not be feared that the people of the  
states will alter this part of their constitutions,in such a man-  
ner as to abridge the rights secured to them by the federal  
constitution.”

As we have seen, the court says, “ the United States has no  
voters of its own creation.” Mr. Madison says, in the 52d  
number of ‘The Federalist: ”  
  
‘** The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a funda-  
mental article of republican government. It was incumbent on the conven-  
tion therefore to define and establish this right in the Constitution. To have  
left it open for the occasional regulation of the Congress would be improper,  
for the reason just mentioned. To have submitted it to the legislative discre-  
tion of the States would have been improper, for the same reason, and for the  
additional reason that it would have rendered too dependent on the State  
governments that branch of the federal government which ought to be de-  
pendent on the people alone.  
  
‘**To have reduced the different qualifications in the different States to  
one uniform rule would probably have been as dissatisfactory to some of the  
States as it would have been difficult to the convention. The provision made  
by the convention appears therefore to be the best that lay within their option.  
It must be satisfactory to every State, because it is conformable to the stand-  
ard already established, or which may be established, by the State itself. It

it is not alterable by the State governments, and it cannot be feared that the  
people of the States will alter this part of their constitutions in such a manner  
as to abridge the rights secured to them by the Federal Constitution.”  
  
In the debate in the Virginia Convention on the adoption of  
the Federal Constitution, Mr. Madison expressed himself to the  
same effect, and with equal clearness.* I will next quote another  
member of the convention that framed the Constitution, Luther  
Martin, of Maryland, Attorney-General of that State, and one of  
the most eminent lawyers of the time. He said:

Constitution of the United States itself was so written as to enable the  
States to deprive citizens of the right to vote for these federal officers  
whenever they chose to do so, instead of forbiding them to make or enforce  
any law which would have this eflect; as its 14th Amendment has  
now done.  
As Alexander Hamilton explains, in the 52nd number of the &quot;Federalist,&quot;  
our Revolutionary fathers thought it would offend the States to  
reduce the different qualifications of the different States to one uniform  
rule. So they wrote the Original Constitution of the United States in such  
a way as to make federal suffrage conform to the already established  
or which might be established by the States themselves. Thinking,  
as Hamilton says, that this would be agreeable to the States, and safe for  
the United States, Bince it was not likely that &quot;the&#x27; people of the States&quot;  
would so alter the Constitutions of their States as to &quot;abridge the rights  
secured to them by the Federal Constitution.
