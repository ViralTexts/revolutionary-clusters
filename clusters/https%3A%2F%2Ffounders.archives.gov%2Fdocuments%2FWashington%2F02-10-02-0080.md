 the Auspices and Protection of the British Crown; upon which We are in every Respect as dependant, as the People of Great Britain, and in the same Manner subject to all his Majesty’s just, legal, and constitutional Prerogatives. That our Ancestors, when they left their native Land, and setled in America, brought with them (even if the same had not been confirmed by Charters) the Civil-Constitution and Form of Government of the Country they came from; and were by the Laws of Nature and Nations, entitiled to all it’s Privileges, Immunities and Advantages; which have descended to Us their Posterity, and ought of Right to be as fully enjoyed, as if We had still continued within the Realm of England.  
2. Resolved that the most important and valuable Part of the British Constitution, upon which it’s very Existence depends, is the fundamental Principle of the People’s being governed by no Laws, to which they have not given their Consent, by Representatives freely chosen by themselves; who are affected by the Laws they inact equally with their Constituents, to whom they are accountable, and whose Burthens they share; in which consists the Safety and Happiness of the Community: for if this Part of the Constitution was taken away, or materially altered, the Government must degenerate either into an absolute and despotic Monarchy, or a tyrannical Aristocracy, and the Freedom of the People be annihilated

d that the Claim lately assumed and exercised by the British Parliament of making all such Laws as they think fit, to govern the People of these Colonies, and to extort from Us our Money without our Consent, is not only diametrically contrary to the first Principles of the Constitution, and the original Compacts by which We are dependant upon the British Crown and Government; but is totally incompatible with the Privileges of a free People, and the natural Rights of Mankind; will render our own Legislatures merely nominal and nugatory, and is calculated to reduce Us from a State of Freedom and Happiness, to Slavery and Misery.  
6. Resolved that Taxation and Representation are in their Nature inseperable; that the Right of withholding, or of giving and granting their own Money is the only effectual Security to a free people against the Incroachments of Despotism and Tyranny; and that whenever they yield the one, they must quickly fall a Prey to the other.  
7. Resolved that the Powers over the People of America now claimed by the British House of Commons, in whose Election We have no Share, on whose Determinations We can have no Influence, whose Information must be always defective and often false, who in many Instances may have a seperate, and in some an opposite Interest to ours, and who are removed from those Impressions of Tenderness and Compassion arising from personal Intercourse and Connections, which soften the Rigours of the most despotic Governments, must if continued, establish the most grievous and intollerable Species of Tyranny and Oppression that ever was inflicted upon Mankind.  
8. Resolved that it is our greatest Wish and Inclination, as well as Interest, to continue our Connection with, and Dependance upon the British Government; but tho’ We are it’s Subjects, we will use every Means which Heaven hath given Us to prevent our becoming it’s Slaves.  
9. Resolved that there is a premeditated Design and System, formed and pursued by the British Ministry, to introduce an  
  
arbitrary Government into his Majesty’s American Dominions; to which End they are artfully prejudicing our Sovereign, and inflaming the Minds of our fellow-Subjects in Great Britain, by propagating the most malevolent Falsehoods; particularly that there is an Intention in the American Colonies to set up for independant States; endeavouring at the same Time, by various Ac

d that the several Acts of Parliament for raising a Revenue upon the People of America without their Consent, the creating new and dangerous Jurisdictions here, the taking away our Trials by Jurys, the ordering Persons upon Criminal accusations, to be tried in another Country than that in which the Fact is charged to have been committed, the Act inflicting ministerial Vengeance upon the Town of Boston, and the two Bills lately brought into Parliament for abrogating the Charter of the Province of Massachusets Bay, and for the protection and Encouragement of Murderers in the said Province, are Part of the above mentioned iniquitous System. That the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston are now suffering in the common Cause of all British America, and are justly entitled to it’s Support and Assistance; and therefore that a Subscription ought imediatly to be opened, and proper Persons appointed, in every County of this Colony to purchase Provisions, and consign them to some Gentlemen of Character in Boston, to be distributed among the poorer Sort of People there.

14.

The Legislature of Tennessee is now  
in session, and will undoubtedly give  
its consent to the proposed measure--a  
consent which, it is hoped, Congress  
will on its part also give, and thus se­  
cure without delay, and free from future  
embarrassments, the political redemp­  
tion of the loyal people of East Ten­  
nessee.--ChicagO RepublicaN.  
THe FAIRfAx REsOluTIOns.  
History is said to repeat itself. The  
position in which the Southern States  
find themselves by the action of the  
dominant Radical party is somewhat  
analogous to that of the Colonies in  
1744. On the 18th of July, of that year,  
a general meeting of the freeholders  
and inhabitants of the county of Fair  
fax was held at the Court House.  
George Washington presided, and  
Robert Harrison was clerk of the meet­  
ing. The resolutions consisted of wen  
and were, in all probability,  
drawn up by the celebrated George  
Mason, who was one of the maliai of  
that day. As they are not inapplicable  
to our present condition, we purpose to  
give such extracts from these resolu  
tions as will prove of interest to our  
readers:  
1. &quot;That our ancestors, when they left  
their native land and settled in America,  
brought with them the civil constitution  
and form of Government of the country  
they came from; and were, by the law of  
nature and nations, entitled to all the privi­  
leges, immunities and advantages, which  
have descended to us, their posterity, and  
ought of right to be as fully enjoyed.&quot;  
2. &quot;That the most important and valua  
ble part of the British Constitution, upon  
which its very existence depends, is the  
fundamental principle of the people&#x27;s being  
governed by no laws, to which they have  
not given their consent by representatives  
freely chosen by themselves; who are affect­  
ed by the laws they enact equally with their  
constituents; to whom they are accountable,  
and whose burthens they share; in which  
consists the safety and happiness of the  
community; for if this part of the Constitu  
tion was taken away, or materially altered,  
the Government must degenerate either  
into an absolute and despotic monarchy, or  
a tyrannical aristoctrey, and the freedom of  
the people be annihilated.

5. &quot;That the claim, lately assnmed and  
exercised by the British par iament, of  
making all such laws as they think fit, to  
govern the people of these colonies and to  
extort from us our money without our con­  
sent, is not only diametrically contrary to  
the first principles of the Constitution, and  
the original compacts- but is totally in  
compatible with the privileges of a free  
people and the natural rights of mankind,  
will render our Legislatures merely nomi-  
nal and nugatory, and is calculated to re  
duce us from a state of freedom and happi­  
ness to slavery and misery.&quot;  
6. &quot;That taxation and representation are  
in their nature inseparable; that the right  
of withbolding, or of giving and granting  
them our money, is the only effectual secu­  
rity to a free people, against the encroach­  
ments of despotism and tyranny; and that  
whenever they yield the one, they must  
quickly fall a prey to the other.&quot;  
7 &quot;That the powers over the people of  
America, now claimed by the British House  
of Commons, in whose election we have no  
share, on whose determinations we can  
have no influence, whose information must  
always be defective, and often false, who,  
in many instances, may have a separate,  
and in some an opposite interest to ours, and  
who are removed from those impressions of  
tenderness and compassion arising from  
personal intercourse and connexions, which  
soften the rigors of the most despotic gov­  
ernment, must, if continued, establish the  
most grievous and intolerable species of  
tyranny and oppression that ever was in­  
flicted upon mankind.&quot;  
9. &quot;That there is a premeditated design  
and system to introduce an arbitrary gov­  
ernment to which end the most malevolent  
falsehoods are propagated, particularly that  
there is an intention in the American colo­  
nies to set up for independent States.
