y whole Life, a few months Weeks in a Year excepted, when I commonly took a Journey, in the Country. I was naturally inquisitive, and a little too talkative, in my Youth, which Qualities have perhaps increased with my Age, but as I remember, I used to swear at the vanity and Impertinence of old Nestor whose Speeches I have often read formerly in Popes Homer (a Book of which I was then, and am still very fond) I expect that younger Men will laugh at the like Vanity and Impertinence in me, which it shall be my Care therefore in this Paper, at least to avoid, because I would have the subject of it, candidly weighed.  
Indeed, scarcely any Thing that I have observed, in the Course of a long Life, deserves more Attention has a greater Influence on the Religion, Moralls, Health, Property, Liberties and Tranquility of the World. I mean public Houses.  
The Tempers, and Passions, The Prophaneness and brutal Behaviour inspired by the low sort of Company that frequents such Houses, and by the Liquors they drink there; are not very compatible with the pure and undefiled Religion of Jesus, that Religion whose first Principle is to renounce all filthiness and superfluity of Naughtiness. That Inattention to the public ordinances of Religion as well as to private Devotion which I have Reasons to think is prevalent, in these Times is no unnatural Consequence, of the very generall Resort, to these licentious Houses.  
The plentiful Use of spirituous Liquors, begins with producing a strange Confusion of Mind, appetite and Passions, too violent for the Government of Reason; proceeds to involve Men in Debt, and of Consequence, in Lying, cheating, stealing, and sometimes in greater Crimes; and ends in a total, and incurable Dissolution of Manners.  
The Effects of such Intemperance upon Health are of two Kinds. It either throws them into some acute and inflammatory fever, which carries them from the Midst of their Vices and their follies, the Mischiefs they do and the Miseries Distresses they suffer, at once into their Graves, or else it leads them by insensible Degrees, thro all the Gloom and Languor of a Chronical Distemper, despized by many, hated by more and pitied by a few, to a long expected, and desired death. Thousands, and thousands, are every Year expiring in Europe, and proportionable Numbers in America, the miserable Victims of their own Imprudence, and the ill Policy of Rulers in permitting the Causes of their Ruin to exist. Allured by the smell of these infernal Liquors, like the Ghosts, in Romances, allured by the scent of human Blood, they resort to these Houses, waste their Time, their strength and their Money, which ought to be employed in the Management of their own Affairs and families, till by degrees, much expended, little earned, they contract Habits of Calesness, Idleness, and Intemperance; their Creditors demand, they promise to pay but fail; Writts issue, Charges are multiplied, for the Maintenance of others as idle as themselves, and Executions strip them of all they have, and cast their miserable Bodies into loathsome Prisons.  
The Number of these Houses have been lately so much augmented, and the fortunes of their owners so much increased, that an Artful Man has little else to do, but secure the favour of Taverners, in order to secure the suffrages of the Rabbles that attend these Houses, which in many Towns within my observation makes a very large, perhaps the largest Number of Voters. The Consequence is that these offices and Elections, which all the wisest Legislators of the world, in humble Imitation of

Adams, the Second President of the United States : ‘* Thousands  
and thousands are every year expiring in Europe, and propor-  
tionable numbers in this country, the miserable victims of their  
own imprudence and the ill policy of the rulers in permitting  
the causes of their ruin to exist. Allured by these inferna  
liquors, like the ghost in romances allured by the smell of  
human blood, they resort to these houses, waste their time, their  
strength, and their money, which ought to be employed in the  
management of their own affairs and families, till, by degrees,  
much expended, little earned, they contract habits of careless-  
ness, idleness, and intemperance ; their creditors demand ; they  
promise to pay, but fail ; writs issue, charges are multiplied  
for the maintenance of others as idle as themselves, and execu-  
tions strip them of all they have, and cast their miserable bodies  
into loathsome prisons. The number of these houses has been  
lately so much augmented, and the fortunes of their owners so  
much increased, that the artful man has little else to do but  
secure the favour of taverners in order to receive the suffrages  
of the rabble that attend these houses, which in many towns  
within my observation makes a very large, perhaps the largest  
number of voters.”

a hundred y ars ago, recorded  
opinion of the use of spiritnons  
liquors, and their sale Rt public

expiring every year in Europe, and  
proportionable numbers in this

their own imprudence and the ill

others as idle as themselves, ana  
executions strip them of all they  
have, and east their miserable bodies

much augmented, and the for­
