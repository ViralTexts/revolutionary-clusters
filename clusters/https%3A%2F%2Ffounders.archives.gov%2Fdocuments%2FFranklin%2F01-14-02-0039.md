Remarks on the Report published in our last Chronicle. By B. F. Esq;   
In the Report of the Board of Trade, dated February 9, 1764, the following Reasons are given for restraining the Emission of Paper Bills of Credit in America, as a legal Tender.  
1. That it carries the Gold and Silver out of the Province, and so ruins the Country, as Experience has shewn in every Colony, where it has been practised in any great Degree.  
2. That the Merchants trading to America have suffered and lost by it.  
3. That the Restriction has had a beneficial Effect in New-England.  
  
4. That every Medium of Trade should have an intrinsic Value, which Paper Money has not. Gold and Silver are therefore the fittest for this Medium, as they are an Equivalent, which Paper never can be.  
5. That Debtors, in the Assemblies, make Paper Money with fraudulent Views.  
6. That in the Middle Colonies, where the Credit of the Paper Money has been best supported, the Bills have never kept to the nominal Value in Circulation, but have constantly depreciated to a certain Degree whenever the Quantity has been increased.  
To consider these Reasons in their Order. The first is, That Paper Money carries the Gold and Silver out of the Province, and so ruins the Country, as Experience has shewn in every Colony where it has been practised in any great Degree. This seems to be a mere speculative Opinion, not founded on Fact in any of the Colonies. The Truth is, that the Balance of their Trade with Britain being generally against them, the Gold and Silver is drawn out to pay that Balance; and then the Necessity of some Medium of Trade has induced the making of Paper Money, which could not be carried away. Thus, if carrying out all the Gold and Silver ruins a Country, every Colony was ruined before it made Paper Money. But, far from being ruined by it, the Colonies, that have made Use of Paper Money, have been and are all in a thriving Condition. Their Debt indeed to Britain has increased, because their Numbers, and of course, their Trade, has increased; for all Trade having always a Proportion of Debt outstanding, which is paid in its Turn, while fresh Debt is contracted, that Proportion of Debt naturally increases as the Trade increases; but the Improvement and Increase of Estates in the Colonies has been in a greater Proportion than their Debt. New-England, particularly, in 1696, about the Time they began the Use of Paper Money, had in all its four Provinces but 130 Churches or Congregations, in 1760 they were 530; the Number of Farms and Buildings is increased in Proportion to the Number of People, and the Goods exported to them from England in 1750, before the Restraints took Place, were near five Times as much as before they had Paper Money. Pennsylvania, before they made any Paper Money, was totally stript of its Gold and Silver, though they had from Time to Time, like the neighbouring Colonies, agreed to take Gold and Silver Coins at higher and higher nominal Values, in Hopes of drawing Money into, and retaining it for the internal Uses of the Province. During that weak Practice, Silver got up by Degrees to 8s. 9d. an Ounce, and English Crowns were called 6, 7, and 8s. Pieces long before Paper Money was made. But this Practice of increasing the Denomination was found not to answer the End. The Balance of Trade carry’d out the Gold and Silver as fast as it was brought in, the Merchants raising the Price of their Goods in Proportion to the increas’d Denomination of the Money. The Difficulties for want of Cash were accordingly very great, the chief Part of the Trade being carry’d on by the extreamly inconvenient Method of Barter, when in 1723 Paper Money was first made there, which gave new Life to Business, promoted greatly the Settlement of new Lands, by lending small Sums to Beginners on easy Interest, to be repaid by Installments, whereby the Province has so greatly increas’d in Inhabitants, that the Export from hence thither is now more than tenfold what it then was, and by their Trade with foreign Colonies they have been able to obtain great Quantities of Gold and Silver to remit hither, in return for the Manufactures of this Country. New-York and New Jersey have also increas’d and improv’d greatly during the same Period, with the Use of Paper Money; so that it does not appear to be of the ruinous Nature ascrib’d to it. And if the Inhabitants of those Countries are glad to have the Use of Paper among themselves, that they may thereby be enabled to spare for Remittance hither the Gold and Silver they obtain by their Commerce with Foreigners, one would expect no Objection against their Parting with it could arise here in the Country that receives it.  
  
The second reason is, That the Merchants trading to America have suffered and lost by the Paper Money. This may have been the Case in particular Instances at particular Times and Places, as in South-Carolina about 50 Years since, when the Colony was thought in danger of being destroy’d by the Indians and Spaniards; and the British Merchants, in fear of losing their whole Effects there, call’d precipitately for Remittances; and the Inhabitants to get something lodg’d in safer Countries, gave any Price in Paper Money for Bills of Exchange, whereby the Paper as compar’d with Bills or with Produce or other Effects fit for Exportation, was suddenly and greatly depreciated. The unsettled State of Government for a long Time in that Province had also its Share in depreciating its Bills. But since that Danger blew over, and the Colony has been in the Hands of the Crown, their Currency became fixed, and has so remain’d to this day. Also in New-England, when much greater Quantities were issued than was necessary for a Medium of Trade, to defray the Expedition against Louisbourg; and, during the last War, in Virginia and North Carolina, where great Sums were issued to pay the Colony Troops, and the War made Tobacco a poorer Remittance from the higher Price of Freight and Insurance: In these Cases the Merchants trading to those Colonies may sometimes have suffered by the sudden and unforeseen Rise of Exchange. By slow and gradual Rises they seldom suffer, the Goods being sold at proportional Prices. But War is a common Calamity in all Countries, and the Merchants that deal with them cannot expect to avoid a share of the Losses it sometimes occasions by affecting Publick Credit. It is hoped however, that the Profits of their subsequent Commerce with those Colonies may have made them some Reparation. And the Merchants trading to the Middle Colonies New York, New Jersey and Pensilvania, have never suffer’d by any Rise of Exchange, it having ever been a constant Rule there to consider British Debts as payable in Britain, and not to be discharged but by as much Paper (whatever might be the Rate of Exchange) as would purchase a Bill for the full Sterling Sum. On the contrary, the Merchants have been great Gainers by the Use of Paper Money in those Colonies, as it enabled them to vend much greater Quantities of Goods, and the Purchasers to pay more punctually for them. And the People there make no Complaint of any Injury done them by Paper Money with a legal Tender; they are sensible of its Benefits and petition to have it so allowed.  
The 3d Reason is, That the Restriction has had a beneficial Effect in New England. Particular Circumstances in the New England Colonies made Paper Money less necessary and less convenient to them. They have great and valuable Fisheries of Whale and Cod, by which large Remittances can be made. They are four distinct Governments; but having much mutual Intercourse of Dealings, the Money of each us’d to pass currant in all: But the whole of this common Currency not being under one common Direction, was not so easily kept within due Bounds, the prudent Reserve of one Colony in its Emissions, being rendred useless by Excess in another. The Massachusetts therefore were not dissatisfied with the Restraint, as it restrain’d their Neighbours as well as themselves, and perhaps they do not desire to have the Act repealed: They have not yet felt much Inconvenience from it; as they were enabled to abolish their Paper Currency by a large Sum paid them in Silver from Britain, to reimburse them their Expence in taking Louisburgh; which with the Gold brought from Portugal by means of their Fish, kept them supply’d with a Currency till the late War furnish’d them and all America with Bills of Exchange, so that little Cash was needed for Remittance. Their Fisheries too, furnish them with Remittance thro’ Spain and Portugal to England which enables them the more easily to retain Gold and Silver in their Country. The Middle Colonies have not this Advantage, nor have they Tobacco, which in Virginia and Maryland answers the same Purpose. Where Colonies are so different in their Circumstances, a Regulation that is not inconvenient to one or a few may be very much so to the rest. But the Pay is now become so indifferent in New England, at least in some of its Provinces, through the Want of Currency, that the Trade thither is at present under great Discouragement.  
The 4th. Reason is, That every Medium of Trade should have an intrinsic Value, which Paper Money has not. Gold and Silver are therefore the fittest for this Medium, as they are an Equivalent, which Paper never can be. However fit a particular Thing may be for a particular Purpose, wherever that Thing is not to be had, or not to be had in sufficient Quantity, it becomes necessary to use something else, the fittest that can be got, in lieu of it. Gold and Silver are not the Produce of North America, which has no Mines; and that which is brought thither cannot be kept there in sufficient Quantity for a Currency. Britain an independent great State, when its Inhabitants grow too fond of the expensive Luxuries of foreign Countries, that draw away its Money, can and frequently does make Laws to discourage or prohibit such Importations, and by that Means can retain its Cash. The Colonies are dependent Governments, and their People having naturally great Respect for the Sovereign Country, and being thence immoderately fond of its Modes, Manufactures and superfluities, cannot be restrain’d from purchasing them by any Province Law; because such Law, if made, would immediately be repeal’d here, as prejudicial to the Trade and Interest of Britain. It seems hard therefore to draw all their real Money from them, and then refuse them the poor Privilege of using Paper instead of it. Bank Bills and Banker’s Notes are daily used here as a Medium of Trade, and in large Dealings perhaps the greatest Part is transacted by their Means; and yet they have no intrinsic Value, but rest on the Credit of those that issue them, as Paper Bills in the Colonies do on the Credit of the respective Governments there. Their being payable in Cash upon Sight by the Drawers is indeed a Circumstance that cannot attend the Colony Bills for the Reason just above mentioned, their Cash being drawn from them by the British Trade; but the legal Tender being substituted in its Place, is rather a greater Advantage to the Possessor, since he need not be at the Trouble of going to a particular Bank or Banker to demand his Money, finding, wherever he has occasion to lay out Money in the Province, a Person that is oblig’d to take the Bills. So that even out of the Province, the Knowledge that every Man within that Province is oblig’d to take its Money, gives the Bills a Credit among its Neighbours nearly equal to what they have at home. And were it not for the Laws here that restrain or prohibit as much as possible all losing Trades, the Cash of this Country would soon be exported; every Merchant who had occasion to remit it would run to the Bank with all its Bills that came into his Hands, and take out his Part of its Treasure for that purpose, so that in a short time it would be no more able to pay Bills in Money upon Sight than it is now in the Power of a Colony Treasury so to do. And if Government afterwards should have Occasion for the Credit of the Bank, it must of Necessity make its Bills a legal Tender, funding them however on Taxes by which they may in time be paid off, as has been the general Practice in the Colonies. At this very Time, even the Silver Money in England is oblig’d to the legal Tender for part of its Value, that part which is the Difference between its real Weight and its Denomination. Great Part of the Shillings and Sixpences now current, are, by Wearing, become 5, 10, 20, and some of the Sixpences even 50 per Cent too light. For this Difference between the real and the nominal, you have no intrinsic Value, you have not so much as Paper, you have nothing. It is the legal Tender with the Knowledge that it can easily be re-pass’d for the same Value, that makes three penny-worth of Silver pass for Six pence. Gold and Silver have undoubtedly some Properties that give them a Fitness above Paper as a Medium of Exchange; particularly their universal Estimation; especially in Cases where a Country has Occasion to carry its Money abroad, either as a Stock to trade with, or to purchase Allies and foreign Succours; otherwise that very universal Estimation is an Inconvenience which Paper Money is free from, since it tends to deprive a Country of even the Quantity of Currency that should be retain’d as a necessary Instrument of its internal Commerce; and obliges it to be continually on its Guard in making and executing at a great Expence the Laws that are to prevent the Trade which exports it. Paper Money well funded has another great Advantage over Gold and Silver, its Lightness of Carriage, and the little Room that is occupied by a great Sum, whereby it is capable of being more easily, and more safely because more privately, convey’d from Place to Place. Gold and Silver are not intrinsically of equal Value with Iron, a Metal in itself capable of many more beneficial Uses to Mankind. Their Value rests chiefly in the Estimation they happen to be in among the Generality of Nations, and the Credit given to the Opinion that that Estimation will continue. Otherwise a Pound of Gold would not be a real Equivalent for even a Bushel of Wheat. Any other well-founded Credit is as much an Equivalent as Gold and Silver, and in some Cases more so, or it would not be preferd by commercial People in different Countries. Not to mention again our own Bank Bills, Holland, which understands the Value of Cash as well as any People in the World, would never part with Gold and Silver for Credit (as they do when they put it into their Bank from whence little of it is ever afterwards drawn out) if they did not think and find the Credit a full Equivalent.  
The 5th Reason is, That Debtors in the Assemblies make Paper Money with fraudulent Views. This is often said by the Adversaries of Paper Money, and if it has been the Case in any particular Colony, that Colony should, on proof of the Fact, be duly punish’d. This however would be no Reason for punishing other Colonies who have not so abused their legislative Powers. To deprive all the Colonies of the Convenience of Paper Money, because it has been charg’d on some of them, that they have made it an Instrument of Fraud, is as if all the India Bank and other Stocks and Trading Companies were to be abolish’d, because there have been once in an Age Missisipi and South Sea Schemes and Bubbles.  
The 6th. and last Reason is, That in the Middle Colonies, where the Paper Money has been best supported, the Bills have never kept to their nominal Value in Circulation, but have constantly depreciated to a certain Degree whenever the Quantity has been increased. If the Rising of the Value of any particular Commodity wanted for Exportation, is to be considered as a Depreciation of the Values of whatever remains in the Country, then the Rising of Silver above Paper, to that Height of additional Value which its Capability of Exportation only gave it, may be called a Depreciation of the Paper. Even here as Bullion has been wanted or not wanted for Exportation, its Price has varied from 5s. 2d. to 5s. 8d. per Ounce. This is near 10 per Cent; but was it ever said or thought on such an Occasion, that all the Bank Bills, and all the coin’d Silver and all the Gold in the Kingdom were depreciated 10 per Cent? Coin’d Silver is now wanted here for Change, and One per Cent is given for it by some Bankers; are Gold and Bank Notes therefore depreciated 1 per Cent? The Fact in the Middle Colonies is really this. On the Emission of the first Paper Money, a Difference soon arose between that and Silver, the latter having a Property the former had not, a Property always in Demand in the Colonies, to wit, its being fit for a Remittance. This Property having soon found its Value, by the Merchants bidding on one another for it, and a Dollar thereby coming to be rated at 8 shillings in Paper Money of New York, and at 7s. 6d. in Paper of Pensilvania, it has continued uniformly at those Rates in both Provinces now near 40 Years, without any Variation upon New Emissions; tho’ in Pensilvania the Paper Currency has at Times increas’d from £15,000 the first Sum, to £600,000 and in New York from £40,000 to £600,000 or near it. Nor has any Alteration been occasioned by the Paper Money in the Price of the Necessaries of Life when compar’d with Silver: they have been for the greatest Part of the Time no higher than before it was emitted, varying only by Plenty and Scarcity according to the Seasons, or by a less or greater foreign Demand. It has indeed been usual with the Adversaries of a Paper Currency, to call every Rise of Exchange with London, a Depreciation of the Paper: But this Notion appears to be by no means just: For if the Paper purchases every thing but Bills of Exchange at the former Rates, and those Bills are not above 1/10th. of what it is employ’d to purchase, then it may be more properly and truly said that the Exchange has risen, than that the Paper has depreciated. And as a Proof of this, it is a certain Fact, that whenever in those Colonies Bills of Exchange have been dearer, the Purchaser has constantly been obliged to give more in Silver as well as in Paper, for them, the Silver having gone hand in hand with the Paper at the Rate above-mentioned: And therefore it might as well have been said that the Silver was depreciated.  
There have been several different Schemes for furnishing the Colonies with Paper Money, that should not be a legal Tender, viz.  
1. To form a Bank, in Imitation of the Bank of England, with a sufficient Stock of Cash to pay the Bills on Sight.  
This has been often propos’d, but appears impracticable under the present Circumstances of the Colony Trade, which as is said above, draws all their Cash to Britain, and would soon strip the Bank.  
2. To raise a Fund by some Yearly Tax, securely lodg’d in the Bank of England as it arises, which should during the Term of Years for which the Paper Bills are to be current accumulate to a Sum sufficient to discharge them all at their original Value.  
This has been try’d in Maryland, and the Bills so funded were issued without being made a general legal Tender. The Event was, that as Notes payable in Time are naturally subject to a Discount proportion’d to the Time, so these Bills fell at the Beginning of the Term so low, as that Twenty Pounds of them became worth no more than Twelve Pounds in the Bills of Pensilvania the next neighbouring Province, though both had been struck near the same time at the same nominal Value but the latter was supported by the general legal Tender. The Maryland Bills however began to rise as the Term shortned, and towards the End recover’d their full Value. But as a depreciating Currency injures Creditors, this injur’d Debtors; and by its continually changing Value appears unfit for the Purpose of Money, which should be as fix’d as possible in its own Value, because it is to be the Measure of the Value of other Things.  
3. To make the Bills carry an Interest sufficient to support their Value.  
This too has been try’d in some of the New-England Colonies; but great Inconveniences were found to attend it. The Bills to fit them for a Currency are made of various Denominations and some very low, for the sake of Change; there are of them from £10 down to 3d. When they first come abroad, they pass easily and answer the purpose well enough for a few months; but as soon as the Interest becomes worth computing, the Calculation of it on every little Bill in a Sum, between the Dealer and his Customers in Shops, Warehouses and Markets, takes up much Time to the great Hindrance of Business. This Evil however soon gave place to a worse; for the Bills were in a short time gather’d up and hoarded, it being a very tempting Advantage to have Money bearing Interest, and the Principal all the while in a Man’s Power, ready for Bargains that may offer, which Money out on Mortgage is not. By this Means Numbers of People became Usurers with small Sums, who could not have found Persons to take such Sums of them upon Interest, giving good Security; and would therefore not have thought of it, but would have employ’d the Money in some Business, if it had been Money of the common kind. Thus Trade, instead of being increas’d by such Bills, is diminished; and by their being shut up in Chests the very End of making them, viz. to furnish a Medium of Commerce, is in a great Measure if not totally defeated.  
On the whole, no Method has hitherto been found to establish a Medium of Trade in lieu of Money, equal in all its Advantages to Bills of Credit funded on sufficient Taxes for discharging it, or on Land Security of double the Value for Repaying it at the End of the Term, and in the mean time made a general legal Tender. The Experience of now near Half a Century in the Middle Colonies has convinc’d them of it among themselves, by the great Increase of their Settlements, Numbers, Buildings, Improvements, Agriculture, Shipping and Commerce. And the same Experience has satisfy’d the British Merchants who trade thither, that it has been greatly useful to them, and not in a single Instance prejudicial.  
It is therefore hoped, that Securing the full Discharge of British Debts which are payable here, and in all Justice and Reason ought to be fully discharg’d here in Sterling Money, the Restraint on the legal Tender within the Colonies will be taken off, at least for those Colonies that desire it, and where the Merchants trading to them make no Objection to it

ing the Colmies with PAPER MONEY, one of  
which is, to make the Bills carry an Interefl fuf-  
Sicient to fuppert their Value. ’  
NHIS too has been tried in some of the New­  
’l England Colonies ; but Inconveniences  
were found to attend it. T&#x27;he Bills, to fit them  
for a Currency, are obliged to be of various De­  
nominations, and some very low, for the fake of  
Change ; there- are of them from Ten Pounds  
down to Three pence.. When they firft come  
abroad they pass easily, and answer the Purpose  
well for a few Months ; but as soon as the In­  
terest becomes worth computing, the Calculation  
of it on every little Bill that makes up a Sum be­  
tween the Dealer and his Customers in Shops,  
Warehouses and Markets, takes up much Time  
to the great Hindrance of Business. This Evil  
&quot;however, soon gives Place to a worle, for the Bills  
are in a short time pathered up, and hoarded, it  
being a very tempting Advantage, to have Money  
bearing Intereff, and the Principal all the while in_  
a Man’s Power, ready for Bargains that may offer,  
which Money out on Mortgage is not. By this  
Means, numbers of People become Usurers with  
small Sums, who could not have found Persons to  
take such Sums of thém upon Interest, giving good  
Security ; and would therefore not have thought  
of it, but would have employed the Money, if it  
had not been of the common Kind in some Bufi­  
mefs. Thus Trade inflead of being increased by  
such Bills, is diminithed, and by their beingfhut  
up in Chests the very End of making them, viz.  
to furnith 2 Medium of Commerce, is in a great  
Meafuire defeated, o o  
On the whole, no Method has hitherto been  
found ¢o eftablith a Medium of Trade in lieu of  
Money, equal in all its Advantages to Bills of  
Credit, founded on fufficient Taxes for discharging  
it, or on Land Security, of double the Value for  
“repaying it, at the End of the Term ; and in the  
mean Time made a GENERAL LEGAL TENDER.  
The Experience of ncar half a Century in the  
Middle Colonies, has convinced many among  
themselves ; by the great Increase of their Settle­  
ments, Numbers, Buildings, Improvements, Agri­  
culture, Shipping and Commerce.” And the fame  
Experience has fatisfied the Britith Merchants  
who trade thither, that has been greatly ufeful to  
them, and not in a {ingle Instance prejudicial.  
It is therefore hoped, that facuring the full Dis­  
charge of Britith Debts, which are payable here,  
#nd in all Justice and Reason ought to be fully  
discharged here in Sterling Money, the Restraint  
on the legal Tender within the Colonies will be  
taken off, at least for those Colonies that desire it,  
and where the Merchants trading to them make  
no objedtion to it.

Remarks and fa&amp;s relative to the Ame-

dated February 9, 1764, the fol-

ftraining the emiffion of paper-bills  
of credit in America, asa legal ten-

fhewn, in every colony where it has  
been practifed in any great degree.

America have fuffered and lo by it.  
  
3- That the reftriction [of it] has  
had a beneficial effect in New-Eng-  
land.

4- That every medium of trade  
fhould have an _ intrinfic value,  
which paper-money has not. Gold  
and filver are, therefore, the fitreft  
for this medium, as they are an equi  
valent ; which paper never can be.  
  
5- That debtors in the affemblies  
make paper-money with fraudulent  
views.  
  
6. That in the middle colonies,  
where the credit of the paper-money  
has been bett fupported, the bills  
have never kept to their nominal va-  
lue, in circulation; but have con-  
ftantly depreciated to a certain de-

increafed.

great degree.”  
  
This opinion, ofits ruining thecoun-  
try, feems to be merely fpeculative,  
or not otherwile founded than upon  
mifinformation in the matter of fact.  
The truth is, thatthe balance of their  
trade with Britain, being greatly  
againfighem, the gold and filver are  
drawn out to pay, that balance ; and  
then the neceflity of fome medium of  
trade has induced the making of pa-  
per money, which could not be car-  
riedaway. ‘Thus, if carrying out all  
the gold and filver ruins a country,  
every colony was ruined before it  
made paper-money. But, far from  
being ruined by it, the colonies that  
have made ufe of paper-money, have  
been, and are all in a thriving con-  
dition. ‘The debt indeed to Britain  
has increafed, becavfe their numbers,  
and of courfe their trade, have in-  
creafed; for ali trade having always  
a proportion of debt outftanding,  
which is paid in its tarn, while freth  
debt is contracted, the proportion of  
deb: naturally increafes as the trade  
increafes ; but the improvement and  
increafe of eftates in the colonies has  
been in a greater proportion than  
theirdebt. New-England, particu-  
larly, in 1696, (about the time they  
began the ufe of paper-money) had  
m all its four provinces but 130  
churches or congregations : in 1769  
there were 530. The number of  
farms and buildings there, is increaf-  
ed in proportion to the number of  
people ; and the goods exported to  
them from Engiand in 1750, before  
  
the reftraint took place, were near five.  
  
times as much as before they had paper  
money. Pennfylvania, before it made  
any paper-money, was totally ftript  
of its gold and filver ; though they  
had, from time to time, like the  
neighbouring colonies, agreed to take  
gold and filver coins at higher and  
  
  
  
higher nominal values, opes of  
drawing money into, and retaining  
it, for the internal ufes of the  
province. During that weak practice,  
filver got up by degrees to 8s. od.  
per ounce, and Englifh crowns were  
called fix, feven, and eight thilling  
pieces, long before paper money was  
made. But this prattice of increafing  
the denomination, was found not to  
anfwer the end. ‘The balance of  
trade carried out the gold and filver  
as faft as it was brought in; the mer-  
chants raifing the price of their goods  
in proportion to the increafed deno-  
mination of the money. The diffi-  
culties for want of cafh were accord-  
ingly very great, the chief part of  
the trade being carried on by the ex-  
tremely inconvenient method of bar-  
ter: when in 1723, paper-money was  
firft made there, which gave new life  
to bufinefs, promoted greatly the fet-  
tlement of new lands (by lending fmall  
{ums to beginners on eafy interelt, to  
be repaid by inftalments) whereby the  
province has fo greatly increafed in  
inhabitants, that the export from  
hence thither is now more than ten-  
fold what it then was ; and by their  
trade with foreign colonies, they have  
been able to obtain great quantities  
of gold and filver to remit hither in  
return for the manufactures of this  
country. New-York and New-Jer-  
fey have alfo increafed greatly during  
the fame period, with the ufe of pa-  
per-money ; fo that it does not ap-  
pear to be of the ruinous nature af-  
cribed to it. And if the inhabitants  
of thofe countries are glad to have  
the ufe of paper among themfelves,  
that they may thereby be enabled to  
{pare for remittances hither, the gold  
and filver they obtain by their com-  
merce with foreigners, one would  
expect that no objection againft their  
parting with it, could arife here, in  
the country that receives it.  
  
The fecond reafon is, That the  
merchants trading to America have  
fuffered and loft by the paper money-

Remarks and fads relative to the American paper-moncy.  
  
This maPihiave been the cafe in par-  
ticular inftances, at particular times  
and places: as in South Carolina,  
about 58 years fince, when the colo-  
ny was thocght in danger of being  
deitroyed by the Indians and Spa-  
niards ; and the Britifh merchants, in  
fear of lofing their whole effects there,  
called precipitately for remittances,  
and the inhabitants, to get fomething  
lodged in fafe countries, gave any  
price in paper- money for bills of ex-  
change; whereby the paper, as com-  
pared with bills, or with produce, or  
other effects fit for exportation, was  
fuddenly and greatly depreciated. —  
The unfettled ftate of government  
for a long time in that province, had  
alfo its fhare in depreciating its bills.  
But fincethat danger blew over, and  
the colony has been in the hands of  
the crown, their currency became  
fixed,and has foremained ta this day.  
Alfo in New-England, when much  
greater quantities were ifflued than  
were neceflary for a medium of trade,  
to defray the expedition againft Louif-  
bourg, and during the lait war in  
Virginia and North Carolina, when  
great fums were iffued to pay the co-  
lony-troops, and the war made tobac-  
co a poorer remittance, from the  
higher price of freight and infurance:  
in thefe cafes, the merchants trading  
to thofe colonies may fometimes have  
fuffered by the fudden and unforefeen  
rife of exchange. By flow and gra-  
dual rifes, they feldom fuffer ; the  
goods being fold at proportionable  
prices. But war is a common cala-  
mity in all countries, and the mer-  
chants that deal with them, cannot  
expect to avoid a fhare of the loffes  
it fometimes occafions, by affecting  
public credit. It is hoped, however,  
that the profits of their fubfequent  
commerce with thofe colonies, may  
have made them fome reparation. —  
And the merchants trading to the  
middle co&#x27;onies, (New-York, New-  
Jerfey, and Pennfylvania) have never  
{uffered by any rife of exchange, it  
  
19  
  
having ever been a conftant rule there  
to confidJer Britith debts as payable  
in Britain, and not to be difcharged  
but by as much paper (whatever  
might be the rate of exchange) as  
would purchafe a bil! forthe full iter-  
ling fum. On the contrary, the  
merchants have been great gainers  
by the ufe of paper money in thofe  
colonies, as it enabled them to fend  
much greater quantitics of goods,  
and the purchafers to pay more punc-  
tually for them. And the people  
there make no complaint of any in-  
jury done them by paper-morey,with  
a legal tender; they are fenfible of  
its benefits; and petition to have it  
fo allowed.  
  
The third reafon is,«* That the  
ftri€tion has had a beneficial efeét tn  
New-England.”’ Particular circum-  
ftances in the New Eneland colonies,  
made paper-money leis neceflary and  
lefs convenient to them. ’ They have  
great and valuable fifheries of whale  
and cod, by which large remittances  
can be made. ‘They are four ciflinct  
governments ; but having muc mu-  
tual intercourfe of dealings, the mo-  
ney of each ufed to pais current in  
all: but the whole of this common  
currency not being under one com-  
mon direction, was not fo eafily  
kept within due bounds ; the pru-  
dent referve of one colory in its  
emiffions, being rendered ufelefs by  
excefs in anc*atr. The Maffache  
fetts, therefc e, were not diniati  
with the reftraint, as it reframe:  
their neighbours as well as them  
felves ; and perhaps they do not ce  
fire to have the a&amp; repealed.  
have not yet felt much inconvenience  
from it, as thev were enabled  
abolifh their paper currency, by  
large fum infilver from Britain to re-  
imburfe their expenfes in taxing  
Louifbourg, which, with the god  
brought from Portugal, by means of  
their fifth, kept them iupplied with a  
currency, till the late war furnithed  
them and all Aincrica with bills of  
  
e

exchange ; fo that little cafh was  
needed for remittance. Their fth-  
eries, too, furnifh them with remit-  
tance through Spain and Portugal to  
England, which enables them the  
more eafily to retain gold and filver  
in their country. ‘The middle co-  
Jonies have net this advantage ; nor  
have they tobacco, which in Virgi-  
Qinia and Maryland anfwers the fame  
purpofe. When colonies are fo different  
in their circumftances, a regulation  
that is not inconvenient to oneora few,  
may be very much fo to the refit. But  
the pay is now become fo indifferent in  
New-Englana, at leaft in fome of its  
provinces, through the want of cur-  
rency, that the trade thither is at  
prefent under great difcouragement.  
  
The fourth reafon is, ‘* That every  
medium of trade fhould have an in-  
trinfic value, which paper money has  
not. Gold and filver are therefure  
the fitteft for this medium, as they  
are an equivalent, which paper never  
can be.’? However fit a particular  
thing may be for a particular perpofe,  
wherever that thing is not to be had,  
or notto be had in fufficient quanti-  
ty, it becomes neceflary to ufe fome-  
thing elfe, the fittelt that can be got  
in liea of it. Gold and filver are  
not the produce of North America,  
which has no mines; and that which is  
brought thither cannot be kept there  
in fuficient quantity for a currency.  
Britain, an independent great ttate,  
when its inhabttants grow too fond  
of the expenfive luxuries of foreign  
countries, that draw away its money,  
can, and frequently does, make  
Jaws to difcourage and prohibit fuch  
importations; and by that means  
can retain its cath. The colonies  
are dependent governments, and their  
people having great refpe&amp;t for the  
fovereign country, and being thence  
imimoderately fond of its modes, ma-  
nufactures, and fuperfluities, cannot  
be reftrained from purchafing them by  
any province-law ; becaufe fuch law,  
if made, would immediately be re-  
  
  
  
Remarks and fa&amp;s relative to the American paper-monty.  
  
pealed here, as prejudi@at to the  
trade and intereft in Britain. It  
feems hard, therefore,to draw all their  
real money from them, and then re-  
fufe them the poor privilege of ufing  
paper inftead of it. Bank bills and  
bankers, notes are daily ufed here as  
a medium of trade: and in karge  
dealings, perhaps the greater partis  
tranfacted by their means: and yet  
they have no intrinfic value, but ret  
on thecredit of thofe that iffue them,  
as paper-bills in the colonies do on  
the credit of the refpective govern-  
ments there. Their being pavable in  
cath apon fight by the drawer, is in-  
deed a circumftance that cannot at-  
tend the colony-bills, for reafons juft  
above-mentioned, their cath being  
drawn from them by the Britith  
trade ; but the legal tender being  
fubitituted in its place, is rather a  
greater advantage to the poffleffor,  
fince he need not be at the trouble of  
going to a particular bank or banker  
to demand the money, finding (where-  
ver he has occafion to lay out money  
in the province) a perfon that is o-  
bliged to take the bills. So that  
even out of the province, the know-  
ledge that every man within that pro-  
vince is obliged to take its money,  
gives the bills a credit among its  
neighbours, nearly equal to what  
they have at home. And were it  
not for the laws here, that reftrain or  
prohibit as much as poffible all lofing  
trades, the cath of this country  
would foon be exported 5 every mer-  
chant who had occafion to remit it,  
would run to the bank with all its  
bills that came into his hands, and  
take out his part of its treafure for  
that purpofe, fo that in a fhort time  
it would be no more able to pay bills  
in money upon fight, than it is now in  
the power of a colony treafury fo to  
co. And if government afterwards  
fhould have occafion for the credit of  
the bank, it muft of neceffity make  
its bills a legal tender, funding  
them however on taxes, by which

they may in time be paid off, as has  
been the general practice in the co-  
lonies. At this very time, even the  
filver money in England is obliged  
to the legal tender for part of its  
value—that part which is the differ-  
ence between its real weight and its  
denomination. Great part of the  
fhillings and fixpences now current,  
are, by wearing, become 5, 10, 20,  
and fome of the fixpences even 50 per  
cent. too light. For this difference  
between the real and the nominal, you  
have no intrinfic value; you have  
not fo much as paper ; you have no-  
thing. It is the legal tender, with  
the knowledge that it can eafily be  
repafled for the fame value, that  
makes three-penny-worth of filver  
pais for fixpence. Gold and filver  
  
have undoubtedly fome properties  
that give them a fitnefs above paper  
as a medium of exchange, particu-  
Jarly their univerfal eftimation, efpe-  
cially in cafes where a Country has  
occafion to carry its money abroad,  
  
either as a flock to trade with, or to  
purchafe allies and foreign fuccours ;  
otherwife that very univerfal eftima-  
tion is an inconvenience which paper-  
money is free from, fince it tends to  
deprive a country of even the quan-  
tity of currency that fhould be re-  
tained as a neceffary infirument of its  
internal commerce, and obliges it to  
be continually on its guard in making  
and executing at a great expenfe, the  
laws that are to prevent the trade  
which exports it. Paper-money well  
funded, has another great advantage  
over gold and filver—its lightnefs of  
carriage, and the little room that is  
occupied by a great fum ; whereby it  
is capable of being more eafily, and  
more fafely, becaufe more privately  
conveyed from place to place. Gold  
and filver are not intrinfically of e-  
gual value with iron, ‘a metal in it-  
{elf capable of many more beneficial  
ufes to mankind. Their value refts  
chiefly in the eftimation they happen  
to be in among the generality of na-  
  
21  
  
tions, and the credit given to the  
opinion that that eftimation will  
continue: otherwife a pound of  
  
old would not be a real equivalent  
For even a bufhel of wheat. Any  
other well-founded credit, is as much  
an equivalent as gold or filver; and  
in fome cafes more fo, or it would  
not be preferred by commercial peo-  
ple in different countries. Not to  
mention again our own bank bills ;  
Holland, which undertftands the value  
of cafh as well as any people in the  
world, would never part with gold  
and filver for credit (as they do when  
they put it into their bank, from  
whence little of it is ever afterwards  
drawn out) if they didnot think and  
find the credit a full equivalent.  
  
The fifth reafon is, ‘«* That debtors  
in the affemblies, make paper-money  
with fraudulent views.’’ This is often  
faid by the adverfaries cf paper-mo-  
ney, and if it has been the cafe in  
any particular colony, that colony  
fhould, on proof of the fact, be du-  
ly punifhed. This, however, would  
be no reafon for punifhing other co-  
lonies, who have not fo abufed their  
legiflative powers. ‘To deprive all  
the colonies of the convenience of  
paper-money, becaufe it has been  
charged on fome of them, that they  
have made it an inftrument of fraud,  
is as if all the India, bank, and o-  
ther ftocks and trading companies  
were to be abolifhed, becaufe there  
have been, once in anage, Miflifipi  
and South fea fchemes and bubbles.  
  
“The fixth and laft reafon is, «*« That  
in the middle colonies, where the  
paper-money has been bett fupported,  
the bills have never kept to their nomi-  
nai value, in circulation ; but have  
conftantly depreciated to a certain  
degree, whenever the quantity has  
been increafed.”’ If the rifing of the  
value of any particular commodity  
wanted for exportation, is to be con-  
fidered as a depreciation of the va-  
lues of whatever remains in the coun-  
try, then the rifing of filver above

paper to that height of additional  
value, which its capability of ex-  
portation odly gave it, may be call-  
ed a depreciation of the paper. Even  
here, as bullion has been wanted or  
not wanted for exportation, its price  
has varied from 5s. 2d. to ¢s. 8d.  
per ounce. This is near ten per cent.  
But was it ever faid or thought on  
fuch an occafion, that all the bank  
bills, and all the coined filver, and  
all the gold in the kingdom, were de-  
preciated 10 percent.? Coined fil-  
ver is now wanted here for change,  
and one per cent.is given for it by fome  
bankers ; are gold and bank notes  
therefore depreciated one per cent. ?  
‘The fa&amp;tin the middle colonies is re-  
ally this :—On the emiffion of the  
firit paper-money, a difference foon  
arofe between that and filver ; the  
latter having a property the former  
had not, a property always in de-  
mand in the colonies, to wit, its be-  
ing fit for aremittance. This pro-  
perty having foon found its value,  
by the merchants bidding on one  
another for it, and a dollar thereby  
coming to be rated at 8s. in paper-  
money of New-York, and 7s. 6d.  
in paper of Pennfylvania, it has con-  
tinued uniformly at thofe rates, in  
both provinces, now near forty years,  
without any variation upon new  
emillions; though in Pennfylvania  
the p&amp;per-currency bas at times in-  
crealed from 1is,coo/. the firlt fum,  
to 600,000/. or near it; nor has any  
alteration been occafioned by the  
paper-money, in the price of the  
neceflaries of life, when compared  
with filver: they have been for the  
greateil part of the time, no higher  
than before it was emitted, varying  
only by plenty and fcarcity, accord-  
ing to the feaions, or by a lefs or  
greater foreign demand. It has in-  
deed been vival with the adverfaries  
of a paper-currency, to call every  
rife of exchange with London, a de-  
preciation of the paper: bat this  
motion appears tobe by no means  
  
jot ; for if the paper purchafes every  
thing but bills of exchange, at the  
former rate, and thefe bills are not  
above one-tenth of what is employed  
[in] parchafes, then it may be more  
properly and truly faid, that the ex-  
change has rifen, than that the pa-  
per has depreciated. And asa proof  
of this, it is a certain fact, that  
whenever in thofe colonies bills of  
exchange have been dearer, the pur-  
chafer has been conftantly obliged to  
give more in filver, as well as in pa-  
per, for them; the filver having  
gone hand in hand with the paper  
at the rate above-mentioned, and  
therefore it might as well have been  
faid that the filver was depreciated.  
There have been ieveral different  
fchemes for furnifhing the colonies  
with paper-money, that fhould not  
be a iegal tender, viz.  
  
1. Toform a bank, in imitation  
of the bank of England, witha fuf-  
ficient flock of cath&#x27;to pay the bills  
at figot.  
  
This has been often propofed, but  
appears impracticable, under the pre-  
fent circomftances of the colony-  
trade, which, as is faid above, draws  
all the cath to Britain, and would  
foon itrip the bank.  
  
z. To raife a fund by fome yearly  
tax, fecurely lodged in the bank of  
England, as it arifes, which thould  
(during the term of years for which  
the paper-bills are to be current) ac-  
cumelaie to a fum fufficient to dif-  
charge them all at their original va-  
lue.  
  
This has been tried in Maryland,  
and the biils fo funded were iffued  
without being made a general legal  
tender. The event was, that as  
notes payable in time, are naturally  
{ubject to a difcount proportioned to  
the time—fo thefe bills fell at the  
beginning of the term, fo low, as  
that twenty pounds of them became

er cent. But was it ever said or thought on such an occasion, that all  
the bank bills, and all the coined — and all the gold in the king-  
dom, were depreciated 10 per cent.? Coined silver is now wanted here  
for change, and | per cent. is given for it by some bankers; are gold  
  
-and bank notes therefore depreciated 1 per cent.?—The fact in the  
middie colonies is really this: on the emission of the first paper-money,,  
  
a difference soon arose between that and the silver, the latter having a  
property the former had not, a property always in demand in the colo-  
nies; to wit, its being fit for a remittance. This property having soon  
found its value by the merchants bidding on one another for it, and a  
dollar thereby coming to be rated at 8s. in paper-money of New York,  
and 7s. 6d. in paper of Pennsylvania; it has continued uniformly at  
those rates in both provinces, now near forty years, without any varia-  
tion upon new emissions, though in Pennsylvania the paper currency  
has at times increased from 15,000/. the first sum, to 600,000/. or near  
it. Nor has any alteration been occasioned by the paper money, in the  
price of the necessaries of life, when compared with silver; they have  
been for the greatest part of the time no higher than before it was  
emitted, varying only by plenty and scarcity according to the seasons,  
or by a less or greater foreign demand. It has indeed been usual with  
the adversaries of a paper currency, to call every rise of exchange with  
London, a depreciation of this paper: but this notion appears to be by  
ne means just. For if the paper purchases every thing but bills of ex-  
change at the former rate, and these bills are not above one tenth of  
what is employed [in] purchases, then it may be more properly and  
truly said, that the exchange has risen, than that the paper has depre-  
ciated. Andas a proof of this, it is a certain fact, that whenever in  
those colonies bills of exchange have been dearer, the purchaser has  
been constantly obliged to give more in silver as well as in paper for  
them, the silver having gone hand in hand with the paper at the rate  
above mentioned, and therefore it might as well have been said that the  
silver was depreciated.’

carried out of the province, to the ruin of the country; and  
“that every medium of trade should have an intrinsic value,  
which paper-money has not.” In answer to the allegation of  
the Board, “ that paper-money carries the gold and silver  
out of the province, and so ruins the country,” Dr. Franklin  
shews that this was a mere speculative opinion, and con-  
tradicted by the actual experience of the colonies.  
  
‘ If,’ says he, (p. 35.) ‘ carrying out all the gold and silver ruins  
a country, every colony was ruined before it made paper-money.  
But, far from being ruined by it, the colonies, that have made  
use of paper-money, have been, and are, all in a thriving con-  
dition. The debt indeed to Britain has increased, because their  
numbers, and of course their trade, have increased; for all trade  
having always a proportion of debt outstanding, which is paid in  
its turn, while fresh debt is contracted, the proportion,naturally  
increases as the trade increases ; but the improvement si ihcodics  
of estates in the colonies have been in a greater proportion of debt  
than their debt.. New England particularly, in 1696, about the time  
they began the use of paper-money, had, in all its four provirices,  
but 130 churches or congregations; in 1760 they were 530.  
The number of farms and buildings there is increased in pro-  
portion to the numbers of people; and the goods exported to  
them from England in 1750, before the restraint took piace, were  
near five times as much as before they had paper-money.  
Pennsylvania, before it made any paper-money, was totally  
stripped of its gold and silver; though they had from time to time,  
like the neighbouring colonies, agreed to take gold and silver coins  
at higher and higher nominal values, in hopes of drawing money  
into, and retaining it, for the internal uses of the province.  
During that weak practice, silver got up by degrees to 8s. god.  
per ounce ; and English crowns were called six, seven, and eight  
shilling pieces, long before paper-money was made. But this  
practice of increasing the denomination was found not to answer  
the end. The balance of trade carried out the gold and silver as  
fast as it was brought in; the merchants raising the price of  
their goods in proportion to the increased denomination of the  
money. ‘The difficulties for the want of cash were accordingly  
very great, the chief part of the trade being carried on by the  
extremely inconvenient method of barter; when in 1723 paper-  
money was first made there; which gave new life to business ;  
promoted greatly the settlement of new lands, by lending small  
sums to beginners on easy interest, to be repaid by instalments,  
whereby the province has so greatly increased in inhabitants that  
the export from hence thither is more than ten-fold what it then  
was; and by their trade with foreign colonies, they have been  
able to obtain great quantities of gold and silver to remit hither  
in return for the manufactures of this country. New York and  
  
New Jersey have also increased greatly during the same —

with the use of paper-money ; so that it does not appear to be of  
the ruinous nature ascribed to it.’  
  
The above statement evinces that it is impossible, by  
altering the denomination of the coin, or by any other ex-  
pedient, to retain the specie in any country in which the  
balance of trade is against it; or in which more may be made  
by sending the specie abroad to purchase commodities, than  
by keeping it at home for domestic use. It is also certain  
that, if a country be rich in commodities but poor in specie,

With respect to the other reason of the English Board of  
Trade for restraining the issue of American paper-money, ‘that  
every medium of trade should have an intrinsic value, which  
paper-money has not,” Dr. Franklin remarks; (p. 37. 39.)  
  
‘ However fit a particular thing may be for a particular pur-  
pose, wherever that thing is not to be had, or not to be had in  
sufficient quantity, it becomes necessary to use something else,  
the fittest that can be got in lieu of it.” —* Gold and silver have  
undoubtedly some properties that give them a fitness above  
paper as a medium of exchange, particularly their universal  
estimation ; especially in cases where a country has occasion to  
carry its money abroad, either as a stock to trade with, or to  
purchase allies and foreign succours. Otherwise, that very  
universal estimation is an inconvenience which paper-money is  
free from, since it tends to deprive a country of even the  
quantity of currency that should be retained as a necessary  
instrument of its internal commerce, and obliges it to be  
continually on its guard in making, and executing at a great  
expence, the laws that are to prevent the trade that exports it.  
Paper-money well funded has another great advantage over gold  
and silver, its lightness of carriage, and the little room that is  
occupied by a great sum; whereby it is capable of being more  
easily and more safely, because more privately, conveyed from  
place to place. Gold and silver are not intrinsically of equal  
value with iron, a metal in itself capable of many more beneficial  
uses to mankind. Their value rests chiefly in the estimation the  
happen to be in among the generality of nations, and the credit  
given to the opinion that that estimation will continue: otherwise,  
a pound of gold would not be a real equivalent for a bushel of  
wheat.’  
  
We must beg leave to intimate that Dr. Franklin is not  
quite correct in saying that ‘ gold and silver are not in

there, and the clandestine dealings with the enemy, who were cut off  
from their own supples. This made great debts. The briskness of

1. “That it carries the gold and silver out of the province,  
and so ruins the country; as experience has shown, in every  
colony where it has been practised in any great degree.  
  
2. “That the merchants trading to America have suffered  
and lost by it.  
  
3. “That the restriction of it has had a beneficial effect in  
New England.  
  
4. “That every medium of trade should have an intrinsic

shown, in every colony where it has been practiced in any  
sreat degree.’’—The opinion, of its ruining the country, seems  
to be merely speculative, or not otherwise founded than upon  
misinformation in the matter of fact. The truth is, that the  
balance of their trade with Britain being greatly against them,  
the gold and silver are drawn out to pay that balance; and  
then the necessity of some medium of trade has induced the  
  
mour in England against paper-money. ‘The board of trade, of whic

making of paper-money, which could not be carried away. (1)  
Thus, if carrying out all the gold and silver, ruins a country,  
every colony was ruined before it made paper-money.—But,  
far from being ruined by it, the colonies that have made use  
of paper-money have been, and are all in a thriving condition.  
The debt indeed to Britain has increased, because their num-  
bers, and of course their trade, have increased; for all trade  
having alwaysa proportion of debt outstanding, which is paid  
in its turn, while fresh debt is contracted,the proportion of debt  
naturally increases as the trade increases; but the improvement  
and increase of estates in the colonies have been in greater  
proportion than their debt. New England, particularly in  
1696, (about the time they began the use of paper-money,) had  
in all of its four provinces but 130 churches or congregations;  
in 1760 they were 530. The number of farms and buildings  
there is increased in proportion to the numbers of people ; and  
the goods exported to them from England in 1750, before the  
restraint took place, was near five times as much as before they  
had paper-money. Pennsylvania, before it made any paper-  
money, was totally stript of its gold and silver; though they  
had from time to time, like the neighboring colonies, agreed to  
take gold and silver coins at higher nominal values, in hopes  
of drawing money into, and retaining it, for the internal uses  
of the province. During that weak practice, silver got up by  
degrees to 8s. ¥s. per ounce, and English crowns were called  
six, seven, and eight shilling pieces, long before paper-money  
was made. But this practice of increasing the denomination  
  
(1) This single argument, or rather fact, that whenever the balance  
of our trade with England is against us, (which is all the time,) our gold  
and silver will be drawn from the banks to pay this balance, affords  
evidence too clear, too strong to be evaded or denied, that till th

was found not to answer the end. The balance of trade carried  
out the gold and silver as fast as they were brought in; the  
merchants raising the price of their goods in proportion to the  
increased denomination of the money. The difficulties for want  
of cash were accordingly very great, the chief part of the trade  
being earried on by the extremely convenient method of bar-  
ter; when in 1723 paper-money was first made there, which  
gave new life to business, promoted greatly the settlement of  
new land (by lending small sums to beginnerson easy interest,  
to be repaid by installments) whereby the province has so  
greatly increased in inhabitants, that the export from hence  
thither is now more than ten fold what it then was: and by  
their trade with foreign colonies, they have been able to ob-  
tain great quantities of gold and silver to remit hither in re-  
turn for manufactures of this country. New York and New  
Jersey have also increased greatly during this period, with the  
use of paper-money ; so that it does not appear to be of the  
ruinous nature ascribed to it. And if the inhabitants of those  
countries are glad to have the use of paper among themselves,  
that they may thereby be enabled to spare, for remittances  
hither, the gold and silver they obtain by their commerce with  
foreigners; one would expect, that no objection against their  
parting with it could arise here,in the country that receives  
it. (2)  
  
The 2d reason is, “ That the merchants trading to America  
have suffered and lost by the paper-money.’’—This may have  
been the case in particular instances, at particular times and  
places; asin South Carolina, about 58 years since: when the  
colony was thought in danger of being destroyed by the Indians  
and Spaniards; and the British merchants in fear of losing  
their whole effects their, called precipitately for remittances ;  
and the inhabitants, to get something lodged in safe countries,  
gave any price in paper-money for bills of exchange; whereby  
the paper, as compared with bills,or with produce, or other  
effects fit for exportation, was suddenly and greatly depreciat-  
  
(2) Paper money we must have. It is convenient, and can be ren-  
dered even more valuable than the same denomination of silver. The  
only question is as to its basis—as to in what its value shall consist—  
whether in the necessaries of life, or in the precious metals.—Ep,

ed. The unsettled state of government for a long time in that  
province had also its share in depreciating its bills. But since  
that danger blew over, and the colony has been in the hands  
of thecrown; their currency became fixed, and has so remained  
to this day. Alsoin New England, when much greater quan-  
tities were issued than were necessary for a medium of trade,  
to defray the expedition against Louisbourg; and, during the  
last war in Virginia and North Carolina, when great sums were  
issued to pay the colony troops, and the war made tobacco a  
poorer remittance, from the higher price of freight and in-  
surance: in these cases, the merchants trading to those colonies  
may sometimes have suffered by the sudden and unforseen rise  
of exchange. By slow and gradual rises, they seldom suffer ;  
the goods being sold at proportionable prices. But war is a  
common calamity in all countries, and the merchants that deal  
with them cannot expect to avoida share of the losses it some-  
times occasions, by effecting public credit. It is hoped, how-  
ever, that the profits of their subsequent commerce with those  
colonies may have made them some reparation. And the  
merchants trading to the middle colonies (New York, New  
Jersey, and Pennsylvania,) have never suffered by any rise of  
exchange; it having ever been a constant rule there, to con-  
sider British debts as payable in Britain, and not to be dis-  
charged but by as much paper (whatever might be the rate of  
exchange) as would purchase a bill for the full sterling sum.  
On the contrary, the merchants have been great gainers by the  
use of paper-money in those colonies; as it enabled them to  
send much greater quantities of goods, and the purchasers to  
pay more punctually for them. And the people there make  
no complaint of any injury done them by paper-money with a  
legal tender; they are sensible of its benefits; and petition to  
have it so allowed.  
  
The 3d reason is, “ That the restriction has had a beneficial  
effect in New England.’ Particular circumstances in the  
New England colonies made paper-money less necessary and  
less convenient to them. They have great and valuable fish-  
eries of whale and cod, by which large remittances can be  
made. They are four distinct governments; but having much  
mutual intercourse of dealings, the money of each used to  
pass current in all; but the whole of this common currency

not being under one common direction, was not so easily kept  
within due bounds; the prudent reserve of one colony in its  
emissions being rendered useless by excess in another. The  
Massachusetts, therefore, were not dissatisfied with the  
restraint, as it restrained their neighbors as well as themselves ;  
and perhaps ¢hey do not desire to have the act repealed. They  
have not yet felt much inconvenience from it; as they were  
enabled to abolish their paper-currency, by a large sum in sil-  
ver from Britain to reimburse their expenses in taking Louis-  
bourg, which with the gold brought from Portugal, by means  
of their fish, kept them supplied with a currency ; till the late  
war furnished them and all America with bills of exchange ;  
so that little cash was needed for remittance. Their fisheries  
too furnish them with remittance through Spain and Portugal  
to England ; which enables them the more easily to retain gold  
and silver in their country. The middle colonies have not this  
advantage; nor have they tobacco; which in Virginia and  
Maryland answers the same purpose. When colonies are so  
different in their circumstances, a regulation, that is not incon-  
venient to one or a few, may be very much so to the rest. But  
the pay has now become so indifferent in New England, at  
least in some of its provinces, through the want of currency,  
that the trade thither is at present under great discouragement.  
  
The 4th reason is, “That every medium of trade should  
have an intrinsic value; which paper-money has not. Gold  
and silver therefore are the fittest for this medium, as they  
are an equivalent ; which paper never can be.”? However fit  
a particular thing may be for a particular purpose; wherever  
that thing is not to be had, or not to be had in sufficient quanti-  
ty; it becomes necessary to use something else, the fittest that  
can be got in lieu of it. Gold and silver are not the produce  
of North America, which has no mines; and that which is  
brought thither cannot be kept there in sufficient quantity for  
acurrency. (3) Britain, an independent great state, when its  
inhabitants grew too fond of the expensive luxuries of foreign

countries, that draw away its money, can, and frequently does,  
make laws to discourage or prohibit such importations; and  
by that means can retain its cash. The colonies are dependent  
governments; and their people having naturally great respect  
for the sovereign country, and being thence immoderately fond  
of its modes, manufactures, and superfluities, cannot be re-  
strained from purchasing them by any province law ; (4) be-  
cause such law, if made, would immediately be repealed here,  
as prejudicial to the trade and interest of Britain. It seems hard  
therefore, to draw all their real money from them, and then re-  
fuse them the poor privilege of using paper instead of it. Bank  
bills and bankers’ notes are daily used here as a medium of  
trade, and in large dealings perhaps the greater part is trans-  
acted by their means; and yet ¢hey have no intrinsic value,  
but rest on the credit of those that issue them; as paper-bills

ON PAPER MONEY. 237  
  
in the colonies do on the credit of the respective govemments  
there. Their being payable in cash on sight by the drawer is  
indeed a circumstance that cannot attend the colony bills, for  
the reason just above mentioned; their cash being drawn from  
them by the British trade; but the legal tender being substi  
  
tuted in its place, is rather a greater advantage to the posses-  
sor; since he will not be at the trouble of going toa particular  
bank or banker to demand th» money, finding (wherever he  
has occasion to lay out money in the province) a person that is  
obliged to take the bills. So that even out of the province, the  
knowledge that every man within that province is obliged to  
take its money, gives the bills credit among its neighbors,  
nearly equal to what they have at home.  
  
And were it not for the laws here, that restrain or prohibit  
as much&#x27;as possible all losing trades, the cash of this country  
would soon be exported; every merchant, who had occasion  
to remit it, would run to the bank with all its bills, that came  
into his hands, and take out his part of its treasure for that  
purpose; so that in a short time, it would be no more able to  
pay bills in money upon sight, than it is now in the power of  
a colony treasury so todo. (5) And if government afterwards  
should have occasion for the credit of the bank, it must of  
necessity make its bills a legal tender; funding them however  
on taxes which they may in time be paid off; as has been the  
general practice in the colonies. At this very time, even the  
silver money in England is obliged to the legal tender for part  
of its value; that part which is the difference between its real  
weight and its denomination. Great part of the shillings and  
sixpences now current are, by wearing become five, ten, twen-  
ty, and some of the sixpences even fifty per cent. too light.  
For this difference between the rea/ and the nominal, you  
have no intrinsic value; you have not so much as paper, you  
have nothing. It is the legal tender, with the knowledge that  
it can easily be repassed for the same value, that makes three-  
pennyworth ofsilver pass for six pence. Gold and silver have  
undoubtedly some properties that give them a fitness above  
paper, as a medium of exchange: particularly their universal

estimation; especially in cases where a country has occasion  
to carry its money abroad, either as a stock to trade with, or  
to purchase allies and foreign succours. Otherwise, that very  
universal estimation is an inconvenience, which paper-money  
is free from; since it tends to deprive a country of even the  
quantity of currency that should be restrained as a necessary  
instrument of its internal commerce, and obliges it to be con-  
tinually on its guard in making and executing, at a great ex-  
pense, the laws that are to prevent the trade which exports it.  
Paper-money well funded has another great advantage over  
gold and silver; its lightness of carriage, and the little room  
that is occupied by a great sum ; whereby it is capable of being  
more easily, and more safely, because more privately, convey-  
ed from place to place. Gold and silver are not intrinsically  
of equal value with iron, a metal in itself capable of many  
more beneficial uses to mankind. Their value rests chiefly in  
the estimation they happen to be in among the generality of  
nations, and the credit given to the opinion, that that estima-  
tion will continue. Otherwise a pound of gold would not be  
a real equivalent for even a bushel of wheat. (6) Any other  
well-founded credit, is as much an equivalent as gold and sil-  
ver: and in some cases more so, or it would not be preferred  
by commercial people in different countries. Not to mention  
again our own bank bills; Holland, which understands the  
value of cash as well as any people in the world, would never  
part with gold and silver for credit (as they do when they put  
it into their bank, from whence little of it is ever afterwards  
drawn out) if they did not think and find the credita full  
equivalent.  
  
The fifth reason is, “That debtors in the assemblies make  
paper-money with fraudulent views.”’ This is often said by  
the adversaries of paper-money, and if it has been the case in  
any particular colony, that colony should, on proof of the fact,  
be duly punished. This, however, would be no reason for  
punishing other colonies, who have nof so abused their legis-  
lative powers. To deprive all the colonies of the convenience  
of paper-money, because it has been charged on some of them,

that they have made it an instrument of fraud, as if all the  
India, bank, and other stocks and trading companies were to  
be abolished, because there have been, once in an age, Missis-  
sippi and South-sea schemes and bubbles.  
  
The sixth and last reason is, “That in the middle colonies,  
where the paper-money has been best supported, the bills have  
never kept to their nominal value in circulation; but has  
constantly depreciated to a certain degree, whenever the guan-  
tity has been increased.”’ If the rising of the value of any  
particular commodity wanted for exportation, is to be consid-  
ered as a depreciation of the values of whatever remains in  
the country; then the rising of silver above paper to that  
height of additional value, which its capability of exportation  
only gave it, may be called a depreciation of the paper. Even  
here, as bullion has been wanted or not wanted for exporta-  
tion, its price has varied from 5s. 2d.to 5s. 8d. per ounce.  
This is near 10 per cent. But was it ever said or thought on  
such an occasion, that all the bank bills, and all the coined  
silver, and all the gold in the kingdom, were depreciated 10  
per cent? Coined silver is now wanted here for change, and  
1 percent. is given for it by some bankers ; are gold and bank  
notes therefore depreciated 1 per cent.? The fact in the mid-  
dle colonies is really this: on the emission of the first paper-  
money, a difference soon arose between that and silver; the  
latter having a property the former had not, a property always  
in demand in the colonies; to wit, its being fit for a remittance.  
This property having soon found its value, by the merchants

paper-currency, to call every rise of exchange with London,  
a depreciation of the paper; but this notion appears to be by  
no means just: for if the paper purchases every thing but bills  
of exchange, at the former rate, and these bills are not above  
one-tenth of what is employed in purchases,—then it may be  
more properly and truly said, that the exchange has risen,  
than that the paper has depreciated. And as a proof of this,  
it is a certain fact, that whenever in those colonies bills of ex  
change have been dearer, the purchaser has been constantly  
obliged to give more in silver, as well as in paper, for them;  
the silver having gone hand in hand with the paper at the rate  
above-mentioned ; and therefore it might as well have been  
said, that the silver was depreciated.  
  
There have been several different schemes for furnishing  
the colonies with paper-money, that should not be a legal ten-  
der, viz. :—  
  
1. To form a bank, in imitation of the bank of England,  
with a sufficient stock of cash to pay the bills on sight.  
  
This has been often proposed, but appears impracticable,  
under the present circumstances of the colony-trade ; which,  
as is said above, draws all the cash to Britain, and would soon  
strip the bank.  
  
2. To raise a fund by some yearly taz, securely lodged in  
the bank of England as it arises, which should (during the  
term of years for which the paper-bills are to be current) ac-  
cumulale to a sum sufficient to discharge them all at their  
original value.  
  
This has been tried in Maryland: and the bills so funded  
were issued without being made a general legal tender. The  
event was, that as notes payable in time are naturally subject  
to a discount proportioned to the time; so these bills fell at  
the beginning of the term so low, as that twenty pounds of  
them became worth no more than twelve pounds in Penn-  
sylvania, the next neighboring province; though both had  
been struck near the same time at the same nominal value,  
but the latter was supported by the general legal tender. The  
Maryland bills, however, began to rise as the term shortened,  
and towards the end recovered their full value, But, as a de-  
preciating currency injures creditors, this injured debtors ; and  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ON PAPER MONE).  
  
dy its continually changing value, appears unfit for the pur-  
pose of money, which should be as fixed as possible in its own  
value ; because it is to be the measure of the value of other  
things.  
  
3. To make the bilis carry an interest sufficient to support  
their value.  
  
This too has been tried in some of the New England colonies;  
but great inconveniences were found to attend it. The bills, to  
fit them for a currency, are made of various denominations,  
and some very low, for the sake of change ; there are of them  
from 10/.down to 3d. When they first comg abroad, they  
pass easily, and answer the purpose well enough for a few  
months ; but as soon as the interest becomes worth computing,  
the calculation of it on every little bill in a sum between the  
dealer and his customers, in shops, warehouses, and markets,  
takes up much time, to the great hindrance of business. This  
evil, however, soon gave place to worse ; for the bills were in  
a short time gathered up and hoarded ; it being a very tempt-  
ing advantage to have money bearing interest, and the princi-  
pal all the while in a man’s power, ready for bargains that may  
offer; which money out on mortgage is not. By this means  
numbers of people became usurers with small sums, who  
could not have found persons to take such sums of them upon  
interest, giving good security; and would therefore not have  
thought of it; but would rather have employed the money in  
some business, if it had been money of the common kind. Thus  
trade, instead of being increased by such bills, is diminished ;  
and by their being shut up in chests, the very end of making  
them, (viz. to furnish a medium of commerce) is in a great  
measure, if not totally defeated.  
  
On the whole, no method has hitherto been formed to  
establish a medium of trade, in lieu of money, equal in all its  
advantages, to bills of credit—funded on sufficient taxes for  
discharging it, or on land-security of double the value, for re-  
paying it at the end of the term; and in the mean time, made

was that the colonies were thriving, in spite of the departure of  
gold and silver, and the fact disproved the theory. “ New  
England,” said Dr. Franklin, “began the use of paper money  
about the year 1696. They had in all its four provinces (at  
that date) but 130 churches or congregations; in 1760, there  
were 530. The number of farms and buildings there is in-  
creased in proportion to the numbers of people, and the goods

this latter province made paper money for itself, it was stripped  
of gold and silver as soon as it received any; yet it made great  
but unavailing efforts to retain the precious metals. In common  
with other colonies it gave higher nominal values for coin than  
the mint denomination imported. Silver actually fetched  
8s, 9d. per ounce, when only rated at 5s. 2d. in the coin of  
Great Britain. This expedient, however, did not answer, and  
the Pennsylvanians wisely adopted paper money in 1723, on  
which Dr. Franklin remarks, “it gave new life to business,  
promoting greatly the settlement of new lands, by lending small  
‘sums of money upon easy interest, to be repaid by instalments,

The second reason assigned by the Board of Trade was,  
“That the merchants trading to America have lost and suffered  
by the paper money.” To this charge it may be answered  
generally that sae a in pursuit of profit must run their  
own risk, and as the English were not compelled to trade with  
the colonies, they were at full liberty to close their transactions  
when they pleased, if found to be troublesome or unproductive,  
but the v Ase was untrue at the time it was made, though  
there had been a partial loss at an earlier date than 1764. Dr.  
Franklin gives the following statement: “This (loss) may  
  
‘have been the case in particular instances, at particular times  
and places, as in South Carolina, about fifty-eight years since, °  
when the colony was thought in danger of being destroyed by the  
Indians and Spaniards, and when the British merchants, in fear  
of losing their whole effects there, called precipitately for re-  
mittances ; and the inhabitants, to get something lodged in safe  
countries, gave any price in paper money for bills of exchange,  
whereby the paper, as compared with bills or with produce, or

other effects fit for exportation, was suddenly and greatly depre-  
ciated. The unsettled state of government for a long time in  
that province had also its share in depreciating its bills. But  
since that danger blew over, and the colony had been in the  
hands of the Crown, their currency became fixed, and has re-  
mained so to this day.” It was, then, pitiful in the Board of  
Trade to draw an argument from these remote transactions,  
altogether exceptional in character, in justification of the arbi-  
trary policy of the Government. War has ever disturbed com-  
merce. It did so not only in South Carolina, but in North  
Carolina and in Virginia, and during the expedition against  
Louisburg, and we all know that it has done so in every  
country.

“At this very time,’ he writes, “even the silver money in  
England is obliged to the legal tender for part of its value,  
that part which is the difference between its real weight and its  
denomination. Great part of the shillings and sixpences now  
current are, by wearing, become five, ten, twenty, and some of  
the sixpences even fifty per cent. too light. For this difference

ounce, but the price of silver as bullion commodity was 5s. 8d.  
The difference was nearly 10 per cent. ; 5s. 2d. was the home  
price, 5s. 8d. was the exportation price. If this, then, was the  
test of depreciation,.and measured it, it was with a bad grace  
that the Board of Trade reproved the colonists for the very  
same state of things that prevailed in the governing mother  
ee: But we will give Dr. Franklin’s explanation of the  
  
acts.  
  
“On the first emission of paper money in the colonies, a  
difference soon arose between that and silver, the latter having  
a property the former had not; a property always in demand in  
the colonies, to wit, its being fit for a remittance. This pro-  
perty having soon found its value, by the merchants bidding  
on one another for it, and a dollar thereby coming to be rated  
at 8s. in paper money of New York, and 7s. 6d. in paper of  
Pennsylvania, it has continued uniformly at those rates in both  
provinces now nearly forty years, without any variation upon  
new emissions, though in Pennsylvania the paper currency has  
at times increased from £15,000, the first sum, to £€00,000.  
Nor has any alteration been occasioned by the paper money in  
the prices of the necessaries of life ; when compared with silver,  
they have been for the greatest part of the time no higher  
than before it was emitted, varying only by plenty and scarcity,  
or by a less or greater foreign-demand. It has, indeed,  
been usual with the adversaries of a paper currency to call  
every rise of exchange with London a depreciation of the  
paper; but this notion appears to be by no means just, for if  
the paper purchases every thing but bills of exchange at the  
former rate, and those bills are not above one-tenth of what  
is employed in purchases, then it may be more properly and  
truly said that the exchange has risen, than that the paper has  
depreciated.”  
  
The British Government, however, persisted in its fatal policy  
of taxing America, not through its colonial assemblies, but  
through the English Parliament, and ordering those taxes to

be paid in bullion and coin, while at the same time it suppressed  
the paper money. After the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1763,  
had terminated the war, this unwise system was renewed

teular purpose, whenever that thing is not to

becomrs necessary to use something else, the fit-  
test that can he got in licu of it. It scems hard therefore,  
to draw all their (the Coloules! real mency irom them.  
and then refuse them the poor privilege of using papor  
instead of it. Bank bills and bankers notes are in daily  
usc here t n England! as a mnedium of trade, and in large  
doulings perhape the greater part is transicted by their  
means; and yet they have no intrinsic value, but fest on  
the eredit of those that issued them, as paper bills in the­  
Colonies do on the credit of the respective Governments  
there. Their shank) bills being payable in cosh upon  
sight, by the drawer, is indeed a clrcumstance that canl  
not attend the Colony bills, for the reason just above  
mentioned, their cash being drawn from them by the  
Bitish trade; but the legil tender being suibstituted  
in its place is rather a greater advantaze to the  
possessor, since he need not be at the trouble of going to  
a particular bank or bankers to demand the moncy.

matter of fact. The tru&#x27;h is that tbe balance

THE NECESSITY OFSOME MEDIUM OF TRADE

Thcs.lt carrying oat all the gold and silver  
reins a country every colony was ruined be  
fore it made paper money. But, far from  
being ruined by It, the colonies that have  
made use of paper money have been, and are,

totally stripped of its gold and silver, though  
they bad from time to time,  
like the neighboring colonies, agreed  
to take gold and silver cons  
at higher nominal values, in hopes of drawing  
money into and retaining It for the internal  
uses ef the province. During that weak prac­  
tice silver got np by degress to eight shillings  
and nlnepence per ounce ... long before  
paper money was made. But this  
practice of &#x27; increasing the denomina­  
tion was fonnd not - to answer tbe  
people. The balance of tra&#x27;e carried out  
the gold and sliver coins as &#x27;ast as they were  
brought In, the merchants raising the price ol  
their goods in proportion to the Increased de­  
nomination, of the money. Tbe difficulties  
for want of cash were accordingly very great,  
the chief part of tbe trade being carried on by  
the extremely Inconvenient method of barter,  
when, in 1723, paper money was first made  
taere, In Pennsylvania, which gave new ll.&#x27;e  
to business, prompted greatly the settlement  
of new lands, (by lending small sums to be­  
ginners, on easy Interest, to be paid In small  
installments.) where ay the province has so  
greatly Increased In Inhabitants that tbe-ex-  
port Irom thence thither Is now more than  
tenfold what It was, . . .so that  
it does not appear to be of the ruinous  
nature ascribed to it.

lownicn franklin replied as follows: How  
ever fit a particular thing may be for a partic  
ular purpose, wnenever inai tning is not to b  
had, or not to be had In sufficient Quantity.  
fand mnst be given np to the demands of com  
merce wnenever madej it becomes necessary  
to use something else, the fittest that can be  
got In Ilea of It. ... It reems  
hard, therefore, to Craw all their real money  
from them, and then refuse them the poor  
privilege of using paper Instead of Its bank  
bills and banker&#x27;s notes are dally nsed here  
i in rngiana i as a medium or trade, and in  
large dealings, perhaps tbe greater part Is  
transacted by tneir means, and yet they have  
no lntnasio vaiue, doi rest on the credit of  
those tbat Issued them, as paper bills in tbe  
colonies do on the credit of the respective gov­  
ermenta there. Their bank bills being pay  
able In cash upon sight by the drawer is. in  
deed, a circumstance that can not attend the  
colony bills, for the reason Just above men  
tioned, their cash bullion being drawn from  
them by the British trade, bat the legal tender  
being suostitutea in its piace it rather a  
greater advantage to the possessor.  
nines he need not be at the trouble  
of going to a particular bank or banker to de  
mand the money. ... At this very time  
even the silver money In England is obliged  
to the legal tender for a part of Its value ; that  
part wmcn is tne difference between its real  
weight and denomination. Great part of the  
shillings and sixpences now current are, by  
wearing, become 6, 10. 30. and some of the six  
pences even 50 per cent, too light. For this  
difference between the real and nominal you  
have no Intrinsic value : yen have not so much  
as paper; you have nothing. It is the legal  
tender, with the knowledge that It can easily  
be repassed for the same value, that makes  
three pennyworth of sliver pass for sixpence.  
Gold and silver are not intrinsically of  
equal value with Iron, a metal In itself  
capable of many more benefits to mankind.  
Their value rests chiefly in tbe esti­  
mation they happen to be in among the gen­  
erality of nations, and the.credlt given to the  
opinion that the estimation will continue.  
Otherwise a pound of gold would not be a real  
equivalent for even a bushel of wheat. (Se

Franklin says:

gold and silver are held is an inconven­  
ience which paper money is free from ;  
since it tends to deprive a country of  
even the quantity of currency that

obliges it to be continually on its guard

When, in 1733, paper money was first made  
there (in New England) which gave new life to  
business, promoted greatly the settlement of  
new lands, (by lending small sums to beginners  
on easy Interest, to be repaid by installments)  
whereby the province has so greatly increased  
in inhabitants, that the export from hence  
thither is now more than ten fold what it then  
was; and, by their trade with foreign colonies  
  
they have been able to obtain great quantities of  
  
gold and silver to remit hither in retnrn for the  
manufactures of the country. New York and  
  
New Jersey have also Increased greatly during  
  
the same period, with the use of paper money;  
so that it does not appear to be of the ruinous  
character ascribed to it.  
  
Speaking of the effect of paper  
  
money in New York, New Jersey and  
Pennsylvania, he says:  
The merchants have been great gainers by  
  
the use of paper money In those colonies; as it  
enabled them to send much greater quantities of  
  
goods, and the purchasers to pay more punctual  
  
ly for them. , And the people there make no  
  
complaint of any injury done them by paper  
money with a legal tender; they are fully sensi­  
ble of its benefits, and petition to have It so al­  
lowed.Speaking of its value as compared  
with silver, he says:  
A dollar coming to be rated at 8s In paper  
money of New York, 7s, Gd In paper of Penn­  
sylvania, it has continued uniformly at those  
rates in both provinces for near forty years,  
without!any variations upon new emissions;  
  
though in Pennsylvania the paper currency has  
  
at times Increased from 15,000 to 000,000 or  
  
near it Nor has any alteration been occasioned  
by paper money, in the price of the necessaries  
of life, when compared with silver. They have  
been for the greatest part ef the time no  
higher than before it was emitted; varying only  
  
by plenty and scarcity, according to the seasons,  
or by a less or greater foreign demand. It has  
Indeed been usual for the adversaries of a pa­  
per currency, to call every rise of exchange with  
London, a depreciation of the paper; but this no  
  
tion appears to be by no means Just, for if paper  
purchases everything but bills of exchange at  
the former rate, and these bills are not above  
one-tenth of what is employed in purchases,  
then it may be more properly and truly said that  
the exchange has risen than that the paper has  
depreciated. And, as proof of this, it is a cer­  
tain fact that whenever in these colonies bllli of  
exchange have been dearer, the purchaser has  
been constantly obliged to give more in silver as  
well as paper for them; the sliver having gone  
hand in hand with the paper, at the rate above  
mentioned; and therefore it might as well have  
been said that the silver was depreciated.  
Speaking of the credit of this pa­  
per money away from home, he says:  
The knowledge that every man within the  
province Is obliged to take its money, gives the  
bills a credit among its neighbors, nearly equal  
to what they have at home

He says: &quot;On the whole, no method  
has hitherto been formed to establish  
a medium of trade, in lieu of coin,  
equal in all its advantages to bills of  
credit, founded on sufficient taxes for  
discharging it, or on land security of  
double the value for repaying it at the  
end of the term, and in the meantime  
made a general legal tender. The ex­  
perience of now nearly halt a centnry  
in the middle colonies has convinced  
them of it among themselves by the  
great increase of their settlements,  
numbers, buildings, improvements,  
agriculture, shipping and commerce;  
and the same experience has satisfied  
the British merchants who trade thith  
er, that it has been greatly useful to  
them, and not in any single instance  
prejudicial. If carrying out all the  
gold and silver ruins a country, every  
colony was ruined before it made paper

it, the colonies that have made use of  
paper money have been, and are still in

It seems hard, therefore, to draw all their real money from them  
  
and then refuse them the poor privilege of using paper instead.  
The English bank bills being payable in cash upon sight by the  
drawer is, indeed, a circumstance that cannot attend the colony bills,  
for the reason just above mentioned, their bullion being drawn from  
them by the British trade; but the legal tender being substituted in  
its place is rather a greater advantage to the possessor, since he need  
not be at the trouble of going to a particular bank or banker to  
demand the money.

that issued them, as paper bills in the col-

he need not be at the trouble of going to  
a particular bank or banker to demand the  
money. At this very time the silver money  
in England is obliged to the legal tender  
for a part of its value,that part which is  
the difference between its real weight and  
its denomination. Great part of the shill­  
ings and sixpences now current are, in  
wearing, become five, ten, twenty, and  
some of the sixpences even fifty per cent  
too light. For this difference between the

In the report of the Board of Trade (in England), dated  
February 9, 1764, a number of reasons are given for  
‘‘ restraining the emission of paper bills of credit in America  
as a legal tender.’’*  
  
1. That it carries the gold and silver out of the province, and so  
ruins the country; as experience has shown in every colony where it  
has been practiced in any great degree.  
  
2. That merchants trading to America have suffered and lost by it.  
  
3. That the restriction has had a beneficial effect in New England.  
  
4. That every medium of trade should have an intrinsic value which  
paper money has not. Gold and silver are therefore the fittest for this  
medium, as they are an equivalent which paper never can be.

1. The truth is, that the balance of their trade with Britain being  
greatly against them the gold and silver is drawn out to pay that bal-  
ance ; and then the necessity for some medium of trade has induced  
the making of paper money, which could not be carried away. Thus,  
if the carrying out of the gold and silver ruins a country, every colony  
was ruined before it made paper money. But far from being ruined  
by it the colonies that made use of paper money have been, and are,  
all in a flourishing condition, etc., etc.

The sixth and last reason is, ‘‘ That in the middle colonies, where the  
paper money has been best supported, the bills have never kept their  
nominal value in circulation.’’ If the rising of the value of any par-  
ticular commodity wanted for exportation is to be considered as a  
depreciation of whatever remains in the country; then the rising of  
silver above paper to that height of additional value which its capa-  
bility of exportation only gave it, may be called a depreciation of the  
paper. Even here, as bullion has been wanted or not wanted for  
exportation, its price has varied from 5s. 2d. to 5s. 8d. per ounce.  
This is near ten per cent. But was it ever said or thought on such an  
occasion that all the bank bills and all the coined silver and all the gold  
in the kingdom were depreciated ten per cent? Coined silver is now  
wanted here for change, and one per cent is given for it by some bank-  
ers. Are gold and bank notes therefore depreciated one per cent ?  
  
The fact in the middle colonies is really this: On the emission of  
the first paper money, a difference soon arose between that and silver;  
the latter having a property the former had not, a property always in  
demand in the colonies, to wit, its being fit fora remittance. This  
property having soon found its value by the merchants bidding on  
one another for it, and a dollar thereby coming to be rated at eight  
shillings in paper money of New York and 7s. 6d. in paper of Penn-  
sylvania, it has continued uniformly at those rates in both provinces  
now near forty years without any variation upon new emissions;  
though in Pennsylvania the paper currency has at times increased  
from £15,000, the first sum, to £600,000 or near it. Nor has any altera-  
tion been occasioned by the paper money in the price of the necessa-  
ries of life when compared with silver. They have been for the  
greatest part of the time no higher than before it was emitted varying  
only by plenty and scarcity, according to the seasons, or by a less or  
greater foreign demand. It has, indeed, been usual with the adver-  
saries of a paper currency to call every rise of exchange with London  
a depreciation of the paper, but this notion appears to be by no means  
just, for if the paper purchases everything but bills of exchange at the  
former rate and these bills are not above one-tenth of what is employed  
in purchases then it may be more properly and truly said that the  
exchange has risen than that the paper has depreciated. And as a  
proof of this it is a certain fact that whenever in those colonies bills

Induced the making of paper money, which

buildings there Is increased in proportion  
to the number of people; and the goods ex­  
ported to them from England in 1750, be­  
fore the restraint took place, was near five  
times as much as before they had paper  
money.  
“Pennsylvania, before it made any paper  
money, was totally stripped of its gold and  
silver, though they had from time to time,  
like the neighboring colonies, agreed to  
take gold and silver coins at higher nominal  
values, in hopes of drawing money into and  
retaining it for the internal use of the prov­

up by degrees to 83. 9d. per ounce—long be­

very great, the chief part of the trade being

stripped of its gold and silvei.  
* * * The difficulties for want  
of cash were accordingly very great,  
the chief part of the trade being  
carried on by the extremely incon­  
venient method of barter. When,  
in 1725, paper money was first  
made, there was a cry among the  
people for more paper money, culy  
£15,000 being extant in the prov­  
ince, and that soon to be sunk. The  
wealthy inhabitants opposed any  
addition, being against all paper  
currency. * * * The utility of  
this currency became by time and  
experience so evident that theprin  
ciples upon which it was founded  
were never afterward much dis­  
puted, so that it grew soon to be  
£55,000, and in 1739 to £80,000;  
trade, building and iuhanitants all  
the while increasing, though I now  
think there are limits beyond  
whick the quantity may be hurtful  
£4O per capita. * * * By their  
trade with foreign colonies they  
have been able to obtain great  
quantities of gold and silver to  
remit hithor in return for the man­  
ufactures of this country. * * *  
On the whole, no method has hith­  
erto been formed to establish a  
medium of trade, in lieu of money,  
equal in all its advantages to bills  
of credit, founded on sufficient taxes  
for discharging it, on laud security  
of double the value for repaying it  
at the end of the term, and in the  
meantime making it a legal tender.  
The experience now of nearly half  
a century in the middle colonies has  
convinced them of it, among them­  
selves, by the increase of their set­  
tlements, numbers of general build­  
ings, improvements, agriculture,  
shipping and commerce; and the  
same experience has satisfied the  
British merchants, who trade  
thither, that it has been greatly  
useful to them, and not in a single  
instance prejudicial.”  
VIEWS OF HUME.  
David Hume, English historian,  
states that “The British govern  
ment took away from America its  
representative money, commanded  
that no more paper bills of credit  
should be issued, that they should  
cease to be a legal tender, and col­  
lected the taxes in silver. This was  
in 1773. Now mark the conse­  
quences: This contraction of the  
circulating medium paralyzed all  
the industrial energies of the peo­  
ple. Ruin seized upon these once  
flourishing colonies; the most severe  
distress was brought home to every  
interest and every family; discon­  
tent was urged on to desperation,

In 1764 the British Lords of Trade  
objected to the use of paper money  
made legal tender, on the ground that  
every medium of exchange should have  
intrinsic value which paper money has  
not.”  
  
Dr. Franklin replying to the British  
Lords of Trade, said:  
“However fit a particular thing may  
be for a particular purpose, whenever  
that thing is not to be had in sufficient  
quantities, it becomes necessary to use  
something else—the fittest that can be  
gotten in lieu of it.”  
  
The attention of Parliament being  
called to the matter of paper money  
in the American colonies, passed • an  
act in 1764 prohibiting any bills of  
credit of the colonies being made a  
  
legal tender. It was hoped by this  
means to check the further issue of  
colonial paper money, because “it was  
injuring the British merchants who  
were trading in America.”  
  
In 1764, while in England, Dr. Frank­  
lin in defense of paper money, said:  
  
“On the whole no method has hith­  
erto been framed to establish a medium  
of trade, equal in all its advantages to  
bills of credit founded on sufficient  
taxes for discharging them, and made  
a general legal tender.”
