d requested a Similar favour—Mr. Jefferson has honoured me with a Letter, (for which I am very thankful) And as Mr. Jefferson and yourself are on terms of Intimacy, I will take the Liberty of giving you a copy of his letter,“Monticello Feb. 25. 24.“Sir,The kindness of the motive, which led to the request of your letter of the 14th inst. and which would give some value to an article from me renders compliance a duty of gratitude, knowing nothing more moral, more Sublime or more worthy of your preservation than Davids discription of a good man in his 15th Psalm, I, will here transcribe it from Brady &amp; Tates version,Lord, who’s the happy man that may to thy blest courts repair,Not, Stranger-like, to visit them, but to inhabit there’Tis he, whose ev’ry thought and deed by rules of virtue moves;Whose gen’rous tongue disdains to Speak the thing his heart disproves,Who never did a slander forge, his neighbor’s fame to wound!Nor hearken to a false report, by malice whisper’d round,who vice, in all its pomp and power, can treat with just neglect;And piety, though cloth’d in rags, religiously respect,Who to his plighted vows and trust has ever firmly stood,and though he promise to his loss, he makes his promise good,Whose soul in usury disdains his treasure to employWhom no reward can ever bribe, the guiltless to destroy,The man who by this Steady course, has happiness insur’dWhen earths foundation Shakes, Shall Stand by Providence Secur’dAccept this as a testimony
