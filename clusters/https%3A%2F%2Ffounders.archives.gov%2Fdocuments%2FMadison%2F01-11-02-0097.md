[18 June 1788]  
Mr. Madison, adverting to Mr. Mason’s objection to the president’s power of pardoning, said, it would be extremely improper to vest it in the house of representatives, and not much less so to place it in the senate; because numerous bodies were actuated more or less by passion, and might in the moment of vengeance forget humanity. It was an established practice in Massachusetts for the legislature to determine in such cases. It was found, says he, that two different sessions, before each of which the question came, with respect to pardoning the delinquents of the rebellion, were governed precisely by different sentiments—the one would execute with universal vengeance, and the other would extend general mercy.  
There is one security in this case to which gentlemen may not have adverted: If the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any persons, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter himself; the house of representatives can impeach him: They can remove him if found guilty: They can suspend him when suspected, and the power will devolve on the vice-president: Should he be suspected also, he may likewise be suspended till he be impeached and removed, and the legislature may make a temporary appointment. This is a great security.…  
Mr. Madison replied, that the honorable member had misunderstood the fact: For the first assembly was after the rebellion was over. The decision must have been improper in one or the other case. It marks this important truth, says he, that numerous bodies of men are improper to exercise this power. The universal e

so of the Vice-President. If an impeached

tiohl ery important question has arn­  
en in regard to the impeachment of  
the President. In case of impeach­  
ment can the President be suspended  
from his functions at the beginning of  
the proceedings, or not until after a  
conviction has been reached? James  
Madison, who was a member of the  
Virginia Convention, called to ratify  
the Constitution, we think, satisfacto­  
rily sets this question at rest. He  
said in that memorable Convention:  
&quot;There is one security in this case  
to which gentlemen mas not have ad­  
verted; If the President be connected  
in any suspicious manner with any  
person, and there be any grounds to

they can remove him if found guilty;  
they can suspend him when suspected,

pected, also, he may likewise be sus­  
pended until he be impeached and re­  
moved, and the Legislature may make  
a temporary appointment. This is a  
great security.&quot;  
  
The Judges of the Supreme Court  
  
of the District are divided as to the  
propriety of requiring the test oath to  
be taken by members of the bar.  
Chief Justice Carter and Judge Olin  
favor the oath, and Judges Fisher and

office is the natural order of im­  
peachment. It is a contradiction in  
law that a tribunal &#x27; should try a
