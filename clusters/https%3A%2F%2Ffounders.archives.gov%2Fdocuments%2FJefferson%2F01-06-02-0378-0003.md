passed in the other Colonies.  
  
In 1774, the Boston Committee of Correspondence proposed  
to the Salem Committee to establish a post-office and post rid-  
ers between those cities, independent of parliament. ‘The pro-  
posal recognizes the exclusive character of the mail system.  
  
In 1775, Congress resolved “ that a Postmaster-General be  
appointed for the United Colonies and a line of posts estab-  
lished.” This created a monopoly.  
  
By the articles of confederation, Art. 9th, the United States,  
in Congress assembled, had “ the sole and exclusive right and  
power” of. . . “ establishing and regulating post-offices, from  
one state to another throughout all the United States, and ex-  
acting such postage on the papers passing through the same
