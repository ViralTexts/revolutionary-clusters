found in the destiny assigned to it in the act of 2d  
March, 1799. According to that act, the purpose of  
its establishment, and the only purpose, was, ‘for the  
better securing the collection of the duties imposed  
on goods, wares, and merchandise, imported into the  
United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels.”  
To adapt it to that purpose the officers were invested,

the laws for the collection of the revenue. That the  
establishment has faithfuliy fulfilled the end of its  
creation—and that, too, under circumstances of most  
extraordinary temptation—is not to be doubted. Great-  
er moderation in the exercise of authority, energy in  
its application, or activity and fidelity in the execu-  
tion of public trusts, have distinguished no branch of  
the public service. Its claims to public favor do not,  
however, rest alone on the fidelity and zeal wi
