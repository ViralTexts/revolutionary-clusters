tion from the state of Maryland, to the legislature of  
Maryland, relative to the proceedings of the conven-  
tion. This communication occupies about ninety pages  
of the book, and contains a string of resolutions,  
amounting to nineteen, reported to the convention by a  
committee of the whole house. ‘The fourth of these  
resolutions proposed “That the members of the second  
branch of the legislature ought to be chosen by the in-  
dividual legislatures, to be of the age of thirty years at  
least, to hold their offices for a term sufficient to insure their  
independence, namely, seven years,” &amp;c. There is  
another provision in this resolution which shows an  
intention to make the senators equally independent of  
the several states and of the United States. It is that  
they are “to be ineligible to any office by a particular  
state—or under the authority of the United States—  
except those peculiarly belonging to the functions of  
the second branch, during the term of service, and under  
the national government for the space of one year after  
its expiration.”

to be the basis of the new Constitu-  
tion. The sixth resolution proposed to  
empower the Federal Government “ to  
call forth the force of the Union against  
any member of the Union failing to  
fulfill its duty under any articles there-  
of.” This proposition was promptly  
rejected by the unanimous vote of the  
States represented in the Convention.  
Thus did the idea of State coercion by  
Federal arms, meet its very sudden  
quietus. And it is a remarkable fact  
that during the whole session of the  
Convention, the same idea was never  
but once propused, and then it was  
just as promptly killed as it was tne  
first time.

By Governor Randolph’s second resolution, the representation of  
the States in both branches was to be “proportioned to the quotas  
of contribution, or to the number of free inhabitants.” When  
this clause came on for discussion, on the 9th of June, Mr.  
Patterson, one of the deputies from New Jersey, opposed it with  
great vigour.” The Convention, he argued, was guilty of usurpa-  
tion of power in entertaining any such proposal. It owed its  
existence, in the first instance, to an Act of Congress, by which  
its “sole and express purpose” was defined to be the revision  
of the Articles of Confederation, together with the reeommenda-  
tion of such alterations in them as should “render the Federa

In the convention assembled to discuss and propose to the  
people a substitute for the Articles of Confederation, which  
should insure a closer union and remove the gross defects  
in the existing form of government, Virginia took the  
initiative, by offering fifteen resolutions recommending sub-  
stantial alterations. Among them it was proposed that  
“the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought  
to be proportional to the quotas of contribution or the  
number of free inhabitants.” The debates, of which this  
statement constituted the subject, brought into prominence  
the danger to which the convention was exposed by dis-  
agreements between the representatives of the large and  
small States. The former welcomed this proposition as an  
increase of their power in the union to be consummated.  
The small States were, however, stubborn in their resist-

Nevertheless, the point was at first  
substantially carried. For though the  
suggestion of a negative upon state legis-  
lation was not tollowed, the convention  
did resolve, first, that the national legis-  
lature ought to possess the right * to  
legislate, in all cases, for the general  
interests of the Union, and also in those  
to which the States are separately in-  
competent, or in which the harmony of  
the United States may be interrupted by  
individual legislation ;” and, secondly,  
“that the jurisdiction of the national  
judiciary shall extend to cases arising  
under laws passed by the general legis-  
lature, and to such other questions as  
involve the national peace and_har-  
mony.” Had these resolutions become  
embodied in the Constitution, the history  
of our legislative development might  
have been far different from what it is.
