Monday 21st. Left Philadelphia about 11 O’clock to make a tour through the Southern States. Reached Chester about 3 oclock—dined &amp; lodged at Mr. Wythes—Roads exceedingly deep, heavy &amp; cut in places by the Carriages which used them.  
In this tour I was accompanied by Majr. Jackson. My equipage &amp; attendance consisted of a Chariet &amp; four horses drove in hand—a light baggage Waggon &amp; two horses—four Saddle horses besides a led one for myself—and five Servants including to wit my Valet de Chambre, two footmen, Coach man &amp; Postilion.

Finding the Roads very heavy and receiving unfavourable Accts. of those between this place and Baltimore I determined to cross the [Chesapeake] Bay by the way of Rockhall and crossing Christiana Creek [Christina River] proceeded through Newcastle &amp; by the Red Lyon to the Buck tavern 13 Miles from Newcastle and 19 from Wilmington where we dined and lodged.

ime, and after 8 Oclock P.M. we made the mouth of Severn River (leading up to Annapolis) but the ignorance of the People on board, with respect to the navigation of it run us aground first on Greenbury point from whence with much exertion and difficulty we got off; &amp; then, having no knowledge of the Channel and the night being immensely dark with heavy and variable squals of wind—constant lightning &amp; tremendous thunder—we soon grounded again on what is called Hornes point where, finding all efforts in vain, &amp; not knowing where we were we remained, not knowing what might happen, ’till morning.  
  
  
  
GW’s vessel, according to the Maryland Gazette, “did not enter the river Severn until ten o’clock, in a dark tempestuous night. She struck on a bar, or point, within about a mile from the city; and although she made a signal of distress, it was impossible, before day-light, to go to her relief” (Md. Gaz. [Annapolis], 31 Mar. 1791). Greenbury Point marks the entrance to the Severn on the north. Horn Point is on the opposite side of the river, about a mile to the west (now part of the Annapolis suburb Eastport).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Friday 25th. Having lain all night in my Great Coat &amp; Boots, in a birth not long enough for me by the head, &amp; much cramped; we found ourselves in the morning with in about one mile of  
  
Annapolis &amp; still fast aground. Whilst we were preparing our small Boat in order to land in it, a sailing Boat came of to our assistance in wch. with the Baggage I had on board I landed, &amp; requested Mr. Man at whose Inn I intended lodging, to send off a Boat to take off two of my Horses &amp; Chariot which I had left on board and with it my Coachman to see that it was properly done—but by mistake the latter not having notice of this order &amp; attempting to get on board afterwards in a small Sailing Boat was overset and narrowly escaped drowning.  
  
Was informed upon my arrival (when 15 Guns were fired) that all my other horses arrived safe, that embarked at the same time I did, about 8 Oclock last night.  
Was waited upon by the Governor (who came off in a Boat as soon as he heard I was on my passage from Rock hall to meet us, but turned back when it grew dark and squally) as soon as I arrived at Mans tavern, &amp; was engaged by him to dine with the Citizens of Annapolis this day at Manns tavern and at his House tomorrow—the first I accordingly did.

A few miles out of Town I was met by the principal Citizen[s] of the place, &amp; escorted in by them; and dined at Suters tavern (where I also lodged) at a public dinner given by the Mayor &amp; Corporation—previous to which I examined the Surveys of Mr. Ellicot who had been sent on to lay out the district of ten miles square for the federal seat; and also the works of Majr.

by him to dine with the Citizens of Annapolis this day at  
Mann’s tavern, and at his House to-morrow—the first I
