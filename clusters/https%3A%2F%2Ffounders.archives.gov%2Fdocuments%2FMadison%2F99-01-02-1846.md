Sir  
						Department of State 6th July 1807.  
					  
					The documents herewith inclosed from No. 1 to No. 9 inclusive explain the hostile attack with the insulting pretext for it lately committed near the Capes of Virginia by the British ship of war the Leopard on the American Frigate the Chesapeake.  
					No. 10 is a copy of the Proclamation issued by the President, interdicticting in consequence of that outrage, the use of our waters and every other accommodation to all British armed ships.  
					This enormity is not a subject for discussion. The immunity of a National ship of war from every species and purpose of search, on the high seas, has never been contested by any nation. Great Britain would be second to none in resenting such a violation of  
						her Rights and such an insult on her Flag. She may bring the case to the test of her own feelings, by supposing that, instead of the customary demand of our mariners serving compulsively even, on board her ships of war, opportunities had been seized for rescuing them in like  
						manner, whenever the superiority of force or the chance of surprize might be possessed by our ships of war.  
					But the present case is marked by circumstances which give it a peculiar die. The seamen taken from the Chesapeake had been ascertained to be native Citizens of the United States; and this fact was made known to the bearer of the demand, and, doubtless,  
						communicated by him to his Commander previous to the commencement of the attack. It is a fact also, affirmed by two of the men with every appearance of truth that they had been impressed from American vessels into the British Frigate from which they escaped, and by the third,  
						that having been impressed from a British Merchant ship, he had accepted the recruiting bounty under that duress, and with a view to alleviate his situation, till he could escape to his own Country: Add that the attack was made during a period of negociation, and in the midst  
						of friendly assurances from the British Government.  
					The Printed Papers, herewith sent will enable you to judge of the spirit which has been roused by the occasion. It pervades the whole community, is abolishing the distinctions of Party; and regarding only the indignity offered to the Sovereignty &amp; Flag  
						of the nation, and the Blood of Citizens so wantonly and wickedly shed, demands in the loudest tone an honorable reparation.  
					With this demand you are charged by the President. The tenor of his proclamation will be your guide in reminding the British Governmentt of the uniform proofs given by the United States of their disposition to maintain faithfully every friendly relation; of  
						the multiplied infractions of their rights by British Naval Commanders on our Coasts and in our Harbours; of the inefficacy of re-iterated appeals to the Justice &amp; Friendship of that Government; and of the moderation on the part of the United States which re-iterated  
						disappointments had not extinguished; till at length no alternative is left but a voluntary satisfaction on the part of Great Britain or a resort to means depending on the United States alone.  
					The nature and extent of the satisfaction ought to be suggested to the British Government not less by a sense of its own honor than by Justice to that of the United States. A formal disavowal of the deed, and restoration of the four seamen to the Ship from  
						which they were taken are things of course and indispensable as a security for the future, an entire abolition of impressments from Vessels under the Flag of the United States if not already arranged, is also to make an indispensable part of the satisfaction. The abolition  
						must be on terms compatible with the Instructions to yourself and Mr Pinkney on this subject; and if possible without the authorized rejection from the Service of the United States of British Seamen who have not been two years in it. Should it be impossible to avoid this  
						concession on the part of the United States it ought (as of itself more than a reasonable price for future Security) to extend the reparation due for the past.  
					But beyond these indispensable conditions the United States have a right to expect every solemnity of form and every other ingredient of retribution and respect, which, according to usage and the sentiments of mankind, are proper in the strongest cases of  
						insult to the Rights and Sovereignty of a nation and the British Government is to be apprized of the importance of a full compliance with this expectation to the thorough healing of the wound which has been made in the feelings of the American Nation.  
					Should it be alledged as a ground for declining or diminishing the satisfaction in this case, that the United States have themselves taken it by the interdict contained in the Presidents Proclamation; the answer will be obvious. The Interdict is a measure  
						not of reparation, but of precaution and would besides be amply justified by occurrences prior to the extraordinary outrage in question.  
					The exclusion of all armed ships whatever from our waters is, in fact, so much required by the vexations and dangers to our peace experienced from their visits, that the President makes it a special part of the charge to you, to avoid laying the United  
						States under any species of restraint from adopting that remedy. Being extended to all Belligerent nations, none of them could of right complain; and with the less reason, as the Policy of most nations has limited the admission of Foreign Ships of War into their Ports, to  
						such numbers as being inferior to the naval force of the Country, could be readily made to respect its authority and Laws.  
					As it may be useful, in enforcing the Justice of the present demand, to bring into view applicable cases, especially where Great Britain has been the complaining Party, I refer you to the ground taken and the Language held by her in those of Falklands  
						Island and Nootka Sound; notwithstanding the assertion by Spain in both cases, that the real Right was in her and the possessory only, in Great Britain. These cases will be found in the Annual Registers for 1771 and 1790 and in the Parliamentary Debates for those years. In  
						the latter you will find, also, two cases referred to; in one of which the French King sent an Ambassador Extraordinary to the King of Sardinia, in the most public and solemn manner, with an apology for an infringement of his Territorial Rights in the pursuit of a smugler and  
						murderer. In the other case, an Ambassador Extraordinary was sent by the British Government to the Court of Portugal, with an apology for the pursuit and destruction by Admiral Boscawen, of certain French Ships, on the Coasts of this last Kingdom. Many other cases more or  
						less analogous, may doubtless be found, see particularly the reparation by France to Great Britain for the attack on Turks Island in 1764, as related in the Annual Register &amp; in Smollets continuation of Hume vol. 10; the proceedings in the case of an English Merchantman,  
						which suffered much in her crew and otherwise, from the fire of certain Spanish Xebecs cruising in the Mediterranean; and the execution of the Lieut. of a Privateer for firing a gun into a venetian merchantman which killed the Captain as stated in the Annual Register for  
						1781. p. 94. The case of an affront offered to a Russian Ambassador, in the reign of Queen Anne, tho’ less analogous, shews, in a general view, the solemnity with which reparation is made, for insults having immediate relation to the Sovereignty of a nation.  
					Altho’ the Principle which was outraged in the proceedings against the American Frigate is independent of the question concerning the allegiance of the Seamen taken from her, the fact that they were Citizens of the United States and not British Subjects,  
						may have such an influence on the feelings of all, and perhaps on the opinions of some unacquainted with the Laws and usages of Nations, that it has been thought proper to seek more regular proofs of their national character than were deemed sufficient in the first instance.  
						These proofs will be added by this conveyance, if obtained in time; if not, by the first that succeeds.  
					The President has an evident right to expect from the British Government, not only an ample reparation to the United States in this case, but that it will be decided without difficulty or delay. Should this expectation fail, and above all, should reparation  
						be refused, it will be incumbent on you to take the proper measures for hastening Home, according to the degree of Urgency, all American vessels remaining in British ports; using for the purpose, the mode least likely to awaken the attention of the British Government. Where  
						there may be no ground to distrust the prudence or fidelity of Consuls, they will probably be found the fittest vehikles for your intimations. It will be particularly requisite to communicate to our Public Ships in the Mediterranean, the state of appearances if it be such as  
						ought to influence their movements.  
					All negociation with the British Government, on other subjects, will of course be suspended until satisfaction on this be so pledged and arranged as to render negociation honorable. Whatever may be the result or the prospect, you will please to forward to  
						us the earliest information.  
					The scope of the Proclamation will signify to you that the President has yielded to the Presumption, that the hostile act of the British Commander did not pursue the intentions of his Government. It is not indeed easy to suppose that so rash &amp; so  
						critical a step should have originated with the Admiral; but it is still more difficult to beleive that such orders were prescribed by any Government under circumstances, such as existed between Great Britain and the United States.  
					Calculations founded on dates are also strongly opposed to the supposition that the orders in question could have been transmitted from England. In the same scale are to be put that apparent and declared persuasion of the British Representative Mr. Erskine  
						that no orders of a hostile spirit could have been issued or authorized by his Government; and the coincidence of this assurance with the amicable professions of Mr. Canning, the organ of the new administration, as stated in the Dispatch. of April 22d from yourself and Mr.  
						Pinkney.  
					Proceeding on these considerations, the President has inferred that the Justice and Honor of the British Government will readily make the atonement required; and, in that expectation, he has forborne an immediate call of Congress; notwithstanding the strong  
						wish which has been manifested by many, that measures, depending on their authority, should without delay be adopted. The motives to this forbearance have, at the same time, been strengthened by the Policy of avoiding a course, which, might stimulate the British Cruisers, in  
						this quarter, to arrest our Ships and Seamen now arriving, and shortly expected in great numbers from all quarters. It is probable however that the Legislature will be convened in time to receive the answer of the British Government on the Subject of this Dispatch, or even  
						sooner, if the conduct of the British Squadron here, or other occurrences, should require immediate measures beyond the Authority of the Executive.

 occasion, if there be no special objection unknown here, of communicating to the Russian Minister at London, the hostile insult which has been offered, as well as the resort

Department of State, July 6,  
1807.  
SIR,  
  
The documents herewith en-  
closed, from No. | to No. ¥ inclu-  
sive, explain the hostile attack,  
with the insulting pretext for it,  
Jately committed near the capes of  
Virginia, by the British ship of  
war Leopard, on the American  
frigate Chesapeake. No. 10 isa  
copy of a proclamation issued by  
the president, interdicting, in con-  
sequence of that outrage, the use  
of our waters and every other ac-  
commodation to all British armed  
ships.  
  
AMERICAN STATE PAPERS. 389  
  
This enormity is not a subject  
for discussion. The immunity of  
a national ship of war from every  
gpecies and purpose of search on  
the high seas, has never been con-  
tested by any nation. Great Bri-  
tain would be second to none in re-  
senting such a violation of her  
rights. She may bring the case  
to the test of her own feelings, by  
supposing, that instead of the cus-  
tomary demand of our mariners  
serving compulsively even on board  
her ships of war, opportunities had  
been seized for rescuing them, in  
like manner, whenever the superi-  
ority of force or the chance of sur-  
prize might be possessed by our  
ships of war.  
  
But the present case is marked  
by circumstances which give it a  
peculiar die. The seamen taken  
from the Chesapeake had been  
ascertained to be native citizens of  
the United States, and this fact  
was made known to the bearer of  
the demand, and doubtless com-  
municated by him to his com-  
mander previous to the commence-  
ment of the attack. It is a fact  
also, affirmed by two of the men,  
with every appearance of truth,  
that they had been impressed from  
American vessels into the British  
frigate, from which they escaped ;  
and by the third, that, having  
been impressed from a_ British  
merchant ship, he had accepted  
the recruiting bounty under that  
duress, and with a view to alleviate  
his situation, till he could escape  
to his own country; and that the  
attack was made during a period  
of negotiation, and in the midst of  
friendly assurances from the Bri-  
tish government.  
  
The printed papers herewith  
sent will enable you to judge of  
the spirit which has been roused  
by the occasion. It pervades the  
  
whole community; is abolishing  
the distinctions of party; and, re-  
garding only the indignity offered  
to the sovereignty and flag of the  
nation, and the blood of citizens so  
wantonly and wickedly shed, de-  
mands in the loudest tone an ho-  
nourable reparation.  
  
With this demand you are  
charged by the president. The  
tenor of his proclamation will be  
your guide in reminding the Bri-  
tish government of the uniform  
proofs given by the United States,  
of their disposition to maintain  
faithfully every friendly relation ;  
of the multiplied infractions of  
their rights by British naval com-  
manders on our coasts and in our  
harbours ; of the ineflicacy of rei-  
terated appeals to the justice and  
friendship of that government ; and  
of the moderation on the part of  
the United States, which reiterated  
disappointments had not extin-  
guished ; till at length no alterna-  
tive is deft, but a voluntary satis-  
faction on the part of Great Bri-  
tain, er a resort to means depend-  
ing on the United States alone.  
  
The nature and extent of the  
satisfaction ought to be suggested  
to the British government, not  
less by a sense of its own honour  
than by justice to that of the Unit-  
ed States. &lt;A formal disavowal  
of the deed, and restoration of the  
four seamen to the ship from  
which they were taken, are things  
of course, and indispensible. As  
a security for the future, an entire  
abolition of impressments from  
vessels under the flag of the United  
States, if not already arranged, is  
also to make an indispensible part  
of the satisfaction. The abolition  
must be on terms compatible with  
the instructions to yourself and  
Mr. Pinkney on this subject; and,  
if possible, without tlfe authorized

rejection from the service of the  
United States of British seamen  
who have not been two years in it.  
Should it be impossible to avoid  
this concession on the part of the  
United States, it ought, as of it-  
self more than a reasonable price  
for future security, to extend the  
reparation due for the past.  
  
But, beyond these indispensible  
conditions, the United States have  
a right to expect every solemnity  
of form, and every other ingredient  
of retribution and respect, which,  
according to the usage and the  
sentiments of mankind, are pro-  
per in the strongest cases of insult  
to the rights and sovereignty of a  
nation. And the British govern-  
ment is to be apprized of the im-  
portance of a full compliance with  
this expectation to the thorough  
healing of the wound which has  
been made on the feelings of the  
American nation.  
  
Should it be alleged as a ground  
for declining or diminishing the  
satisfaction in this case, that the  
United States have themselves  
taken it by the interdict contained  
in the proclamation, the answer  
will be obvious. The interdict is  
a measure, not of reparation, but  
of precaution, and would besides  
be amply justified by occurrences  
prior to the extraordinary outrage  
in question.  
  
The exclusion of all armed  
ships whatever from our waters,  
is in fact so much required by the  
vexations and dangers to our peace  
experienced from their visits, that  
the president makes it a special  
part of the charge to you, to avoid  
taying the United States under  
any species of restraint from  
adopting that remedy. Being ex-  
tended to all belligerent nations,  
none of them could of right com-  
plain, and with the less reason, as  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER.  
  
the policy of most nations has li-  
mited the admission of foreign  
ships of war into their ports, to  
such numbers as, being inferior to  
the naval force of the country,  
could be readily made to respect  
its authority and laws.  
  
As it may be useful, in enforc-  
ing the justice of the present de-  
mand, to bring into view applica- ~  
ble cases, especially where Great  
Britain has been the complaining  
party, I refer you to the ground  
taken and the language held by  
her, in those of Falkland’s Island  
and Nootka Sound, notwithstand-  
ing the assertion by Spain, in both  
cases, that the real right was in  
her, and the possessory only in  
Great Britain. ‘These cases will  
be found in the Annual Registers  
for 1771 and 1790, and inthe  
parliamentary debates for those  
years. In the latter you will find  
also two cases referred to, in one  
of which the French king sent an  
ambassador extraordinary to the  
king of Sardinia, in the most  
public and solemn manner, with  
an apology for an infringement  
of his territorial rights in the  
pursuit of a smuggler and mur-  
derer. In the other case, an am-  
bassador extraordinary was sent  
by the British government to the  
court of Portugal, with an apolo-  
gy for the pursuit and destruc-  
tion, by admiral Boscawen, of  
certain French ships on the coast  
of this last kingdom. Many  
other cases, more or less analo-  
gous, may doubtless be found;  
see, particularly, the reparation  
by France to Britain, for the at-  
tack on Turk’s Island, in 1764,  
as related in the Annual Register,  
and in Smollet’s continuation of  
Hume, vol. 10; the proceedings  
in the case of an English mer-  
chantman, which suffered much

in her crew and otherwise, from  
the fire of certain Spanish xebecs  
cruizing in the Mediterranean ;  
and the execution of the lieute-  
nant of a privateer, for firing a  
gun into a Venetian merchant-  
man, which killed the captain, as  
stated in the Annual Register for  
1781, page 94. ‘The case of an  
affront offered to a Russian am-  
bassador in the reign of queen  
Ann, though less analogous,  
shows, in a general view, the so-  
lemnity with which reparation is  
made for insults having immedi-  
ate relation to the sovereignty of  
a nation.  
  
Although the principle which  
was outraged in the proceedings  
against the American frigate is  
independent of the question con-  
cerning the allegiance of the sea-  
men taken from her, the fact that  
they were citizens of the United  
States, and not British subjects,  
may have such an influence on  
the feelings of all, and perhaps on  
the opinions of some unacquainted  
with the Jaws and usages of na-  
tions, that it has been thought  
proper to seek more regular  
proofs of their national character  
than were deemed sufficient in  
the first instance. These proofs  
will be added by this conveyance,  
if obtained in time; if not, by the  
first that succeeds.  
  
The president has an evident  
right to expect from the British  
government, not only an ample  
reparation fo the United States,  
in this case, but that it will be de-  
cided without difficulty or delay.  
Should this expectation fail, and,  
above all, should reparation be  
refused, it will be incumbent on  
you to take proper measures for  
hastening home, according to the  
~ degree of urgency, all American  
vessels remaining in British ports ;  
  
591  
  
using for the purpose the mode  
least likely to awaken the atten-  
tion of the British government.  
Where there may be no ground  
to distrust the prudence or fideli-  
ty of consuls, they wil] probably  
be found the fittest vehicles for  
your intimations. It will be par-  
ticularly requisite to communi-  
cate to.our public ships in the  
Mediterranean the state of ap-  
pearances, if it be such as ought  
to influence their movements.  
  
All negotiation with the Bri-  
tish government, on other sub-  
jects, will of course be suspend-  
ed until satisfaction on this be  
so pledged and arranged, as to  
render negotiation honourable.  
Whatever be the result or the  
prospect, you will please to for-  
ward to us the earliest informa-  
tion.  
  
The scope of a proclamation  
will signify to you that the presi-  
dent has yielded to the presump-  
tion that the hostile act of the  
British commander did not pur-  
sue the intentions of his govern-  
ment. It is not indeed easy to  
suppose that so rash and so criti-  
cal a step should have originated  
with the admiral; but it is still  
more difficult to believe, that such  
orders were prescribed by any  
government, under circumstances  
such as existed between Great  
Britain and the United States.  
  
Calculations founded on dates  
are also strongly opposed to the  
supposition, that the orders in  
question could have been trans-  
mitted from England. In the  
same scale are to be put the ap-  
parent and declared persuasion  
of the British representative, Mr.  
Erskine, that no orders of hostile  
spirit could have been issued or  
authorized by his government;  
and the coincidence of this assur-  
  
392  
  
ance with the amicable profes-  
sions of Mr. Canning, the organ  
of the new administration, as stat-  
ed in the dispatch of April 22d,  
from yourself and Mr. Pinkney.  
  
Proceeding on these considera-  
tions, the president has inferred  
that the justice and honour of tlie  
British government will readily  
make the atonement required;  
and, in that expectation, he has  
forborne.an immediate call of con-  
gress, notwithstanding the strong  
wish which has been manifested  
by many, that measures depend-  
ing on their authority should  
without delay be adopted. The  
motives to this forbearance have,  
at the same time, been strength-  
ened by the policy of avoiding a  
course which might stimulate the  
British cruizers, in this quarter,  
toarrest our ships and seamen now  
arriving, and shortly. expected in  
great numbers from all quarters.  
It is probable, however, that the le-  
gislature will be convened in time  
to receive the answer of the British  
government on the subject of this  
dispatch, or even sooner, if the  
conduct of the British squadron  
here, or other occurrences, should  
require immediate measures be-  
yond the authority of the execu-  
tive.  
  
In order to give the more expe-  
dition and security to the present  
dispatch, the Revenge is special-  
ly employed; and Dr. Bullus’ is  
made the bearer, who was on  
board the Chesapeake, on his way  
to a consulate in the Mediterra-  
nean, and will be able to detail and  
explain circumstances which may  
possibly become interesting in the  
course of your communications  
with the British government.  
  
The vessel, after depositing Dr.  
Bullus at a British port, will pro-

-port, but will return to England  
  
with a view to bring the result of  
your transactions with the British

will afford you and Mr. Pinkney a  
favourable opportunity of commu-  
nicating with our ministers at Pa-  
ris, who, being instructed to regu-  
date their conduct on the present  
occasion by the advices they may  
receive from you, will need every  
explanation that can throw light  
on the probable turn and issue of  
things with Great Britain.  
I have the honour to be, &amp;c.,

Uit j especially where Great Britain has n

by j you to the ground taken 8c the language g&lt;  
&#x27;- iield by her, in those of Falkland&#x27;s ~

ps standing the assertion by Spain in both tj­  
c-d cases, that the real right was in her, tj  
er and the possessory only in Great Bri- jj,  
or tain. These cases will be found in the jj  
&gt;s- Annual Registers for 177 1, and 1790, j,  
and in the parliamentary debates for ot  
&#x27;&#x27;}• those years. In the latter you will ]n  
ar find also two cases referred to, in   
lie one of which the French king sent  
, ambassador extraordinary to the tj(  
;S, king of Sardinia, in the most public pt  
he and solemn manner, with an apolo- ye  
ss gy for an infringement of his territo- d.  
It- rial rights in the pursuit of a smug- vv;  
nt ler and murderer. In the other case, w,  
\t* an ambestador extraordinary was mi  
ry sent by the British government to the jCJ  
«l court of Portugal, with an apology, sil  
s- for the pursuit and destruction by ail- nf  
m I mirul Boscawen of certain French &#x27;■ y,  
d, ships on tiie coasts of tiiis last king­  
a dom. iMatiy other cases, more or jj,  
it- less analagous, may doubtless be wi  
at ; found; see, particularly the repi&#x27;i  
;s tion by Franca to Great Britain, for ur  
is the attack on Turks Island in 1764, wi  
related in the Annual Register Sc tri  
n, in i),mollet&#x27;s continuation of Hume, pj  
r-i vol. 10, the proceedings in the case co  
;of an English merchantman, which pc  
it suffered much in her crew and other- iai  
c, from the fire of certain Spanish ca  
x- fcebecs cruizing in the Mediterranean; jcc  
i- and the execution of the lieutenanlof I p|.  
privateer, for firing a gun into aj pr  
;- V erietian merchantman, which killed Gi  
g (he captain, as stated in the Annual  
i- Register, for 17ul, page&#x27;J4. The  
1, • case of an affront offered to a Russian  
lassador in the reign of Queen Ann, q0  
i though less analogous, shews in a ,  
d , general view, the solemnity with &lt;  
3 which reparation is made, for insults  
n having immediate relation to the so­  
&gt;f: vereignty of a nation.  
Although the principle which was  
raged in the proceedings against J  
&#x27; &#x27; the American frigate is indeper.- ,1U  
dent of the question concerning x.&#x27;ri  
\. the allegiance of the seamen taken  
ro her, the fact that they were citi- \VA,  
Is of the United States, and not ca,  
British subjects, may have such an ty,  
j influence on the feelings of all, and Sw  
&#x27; j perhaps oh the opinions of some tin- tilf  
I acquainted with the Jaws and usages ?  
*{ of nations, that it has been thought ~,  
»per to seek more regular proofs of tl(&#x27;..  
[, their national character than were m*  
- : sufficient in the first instance. C  
.oid&#x27;s v/iH he added by this c&#x27;n  
conveyance if obtained in time, if not *  
by the first that succeeds. &#x27;&quot;J  
The President has an evident riirht „„f  
r .i ■ &gt; • • . &quot;-at  
to expect from the British govern- *•  
1 only an ample reparation to &#x27; chi  
the U»i&#x27;ed Slates, in this case, but I out  
that it w.&#x27;di be decided without difficul- j &quot;&#x27; &#x27;  
ty or delay.- Should this expectation j &#x27;i&#x27; r  
fail, and all, should reparaii  
be refused, it will be incumbent; on   
yui to take prober measu.es for has- ma;  
tening home, according to the degree tie!,  
of urgency, ah A merican vessels re-1 cult  
ling in British ports; using for j-1 &#x27;  
the purpose, the mode least likely to j %°v  
awaken the attention of the British  
government. Where there may be  
no .&quot;-round to distrust the prudenceor ~  
fidelity of consuls, they wi.&#x27;J probably &#x27;r  
be found the fittest vchicies for your : o))|-,  
intimations. It will be particularly „,.,  
requisite to communicate to our pub- ; Mr.  
lie ships in the Mediterranean, the  
state of api ances, if it be suchas ; rmt

Ali negotiudon, with the British ,c(,„  
• government op other subjects, will of   
course be suspended until satisfaction in.  
on this be so pledged and arranged as in*el  
  
of] to render negotiation honorable. }  
ird- Whatever may fie the result or the &#x27;  
s of prospect, you will please to forward  
rest tons the earliest information,  
so- The scope of the. proclamation will  
Bri- signify to you that the &quot;President has  
I of yielded to the presumption that the&#x27;  
ince hostile act of llie British commander  
igh did not pursue the intentions of his .  
een government. It is not indeed easy to j  
can Suppose that so rash and so critical a j  
step should have originated with the  
und admiral, but it is still more difficult  
lis- to believe, that such orders were pic­  
ked scribed by any government, under cir­  
hy cumstances such as existed between &#x27;■  
,ro- Great Britain and the United State/.. J  
•us. Calculations founded on dates, arc |  
L of also strongly opposed to the supposition  
Uid that the orders in question could have  
by been transmitted from England.\ In  
ary the same scale, are to be put the ap­  
• parent and declared persuasion of  
ips , British representative, Mr. Er:.kir.e, I  
hat no orders of t&gt; hostile SpiritvCould j  
3ii&lt;* { have been issued or authorised by his I  
nc- [ government; and the co-incidence of I  
-si- this assurance with the amicable pro- !  
Lhc fessions of Mr. Canning, the organ J i  
the of the new administration, as stated ! &#x27;  
,of it the dispatch of April 22d, fi  
dy. yourself and Mr. Pinkney.  
na- Proceeding on these considerations, 1 (  
rht Ike President; has inferred that the ( j  
an, justice and honor of the British go- i  
li- vernment will readily make the atone- i  
ips ment required ; and in that cxpec- &#x27;  
m- } tatiori&#x27;, he has forborne an immediate &gt;. &#x27;  
tal &#x27;&#x27;all of Congress ; notwithstanding ; \
di- i the strong wish which has been ma- I j  
nd I hlfested by many, that measures dc- I t  
pending on their authority, should r.  
without delay be adopted. The mo- !  
II £ tives to this forbearance have, at the *  
,c*» same time, been strengthened by the ]  
2S) policy of avoiding a course which  
!.as might stimulate the British cruisers,  
er in this quarter, to arrest our ships and c  
Se seamen now arriving and shortly ex- b  
1 s pected in great numbers from all qUar- v  
n&quot; ters. It is probable, however, that *  
ln the legislature will be convened in ,]  
Jl,&quot;&#x27; time to receive the answer of the Bri- ?  
&#x27; I tish government on the subject of this  
1C dispatch, or even sooner, if the con- ?  
°&#x27; duct of the British squadron here, or p  
Pr other occurrences, should require  
\&#x27;1 immediate measures beyond the au- t(  
ln thority of the Executive. 8  
nt In order to give the more expedi-  
Je tion and security to the present dis- vv  
lr patch, a public armed vessel, the Re- tl  
&gt;&#x27; venge, is specially employed ; and a  
Q&quot; doctor Bullus is made the bearer, who n  
t&quot; was on board the Chesapeake, on his  
e» way to a consulate in the Mcdilerra- c  
iS ; ncan, and will be able to detail and 8  
,c j explain circumstances which may pos­  
it* j sibly become interesting in the course  
&#x27;&quot; jof your communications with the  
n ; British government.  
The vessel, after depositing doctor  
,r Bullus at a British port, will proceed Ie  
,c with dispatches to a French port, but ol  
*- will return to England with a view to *&#x27;  
)r bring the result of your transactions  
*i with the British government. The !-(1  
&amp; trip to France will afford you and Mr.  
s&gt; Pinckney a favorable opportunity of a&#x27;,  
ie communicating with our ministers at •.-;  
b Paris, who being instructed to regu- su  
•~ late their conduct on the present oc- !&quot;  
&quot; I casion by the advices they may re- lf  
•J | ceive from you, v. ill need every ex- ,&quot;  
&quot;I planation that can throw light on the U|  
a J probable turn and issue of things with si

The documents herewith enclosed, from No.  
1 to No. o, inclusive, explain the hostile attack  
with the insulting pretext for it, lately committed  
near the Capes of Virginia by the British ship of  
war the Leopard, on the American frigate the  
Chesapeake. No. 10, is copy of the proclamation  
issued by the president, interdicting in consequence  
of that outrage the use of our waters and eveiy other  
accommodation to all British armed ships.  
This enormity is not a subject for discussion.—  
The immunity of a national ship ol war from every  
species and purpose of search on the high seas, has  
&quot;#.T  
  
never been contested by any nation. Great-Britain  
would be second to none in resenting such a viola­  
tion ot her rights and surh an insult on her flag.  
She may bring the rase to the test of her own feel­  
ings by supposing that instead of the custornaiy de­  
mand of our mariners serving compulsively even a­  
board her ships ol war, opportunities had been seiz­  
ed for rescuing them in like manner whenever the  
superiority of force or the chance of surpriz« might  
be possessed by our ships of war.  
But the present rase is marked by circumstances  
which give it a peculiar die. The seamen taken  
Ironr the Chesapeake had been ascertained to be na­  
tive citizens of the United Stairs, and this fact was  
made known to the bearer of the demand, and  
doubtless commniiicated by him to his commander  
previous to the commencement of the attack. It  
is a tact also, affirmed bv two ot tbe men, with eve­  
ty appearance ol truth, that the}&#x27; had been impres­  
s&#x27;u trom American vessels into tbe British frigate,  
110,11 w hi.-li they escaped, and by the third, that  
having been impressed from a British merchant  
ship, he had accepted of the recruiting bounty un­  
der that duress, and with a view to alleviate his si­  
tuation, till he could escape to his own country:  
and that the attack was made during a piriod of  
nrgoriation, and in the midst ol triendiv assurances  
  
from the British government,  
Tlie printed papers herewith sent will enable you  
to judge ol the spirit which has been roused l,y the  
occasion. It pervade# the whole community ; is  
abolishing the distinctions of party; and regarding  
| &#x27;&#x27;^y indignity ottered to the sovereignty and dag  
| nt tlie nation, and lh^ blood ot citizens so wantnn­  
I ly and wickedly shed, ‘demands in the loudest tone  
an honourable reparation.  
V*ith this demand you are charged by the presi­  
dent. The tennur of Ins proclamation will he your  
; guide in reminding the British government of the  
| umform proofs given by the United States of their  
J disposition to maintain faithfully every friendly re­  
lation ; ol the multiplied infractions of their rights  
bv Bi itish naval commanders on our roasts am*  
harbours ; ol the ineflirary of reiterated appeals to  
the justire and friendship of that government ; and  
ol the. moderation on the part of the United States,  
which reiterated disappointments had not exlin­  
! guislied ; till at length no alternative is left, but a  
voluntary satisfaction on tbe parlol Gient-llritain,  
or a resort to means depending on the United States  
aIoti“.  
I he nature and extent of the satisfaction ought  
to be suggested to the ihitisli government, not less  
by a sense ot its own honour than by justice to  
that of the United States. A formal disavowal of  
the deed and restoration of the tour seamen to the  
ship from which they were taken, are things of  
course and irnhsprnsible. As a security lor the (u­  
tuiv, an entire abolition ot impressments from ves­  
sels under the Hug of the United States, if not al­  
ready arranged, is also to make an imbspensilde  
pai l ol the satisfaction. The abolition must be on  
teims compatible with the instructions to yourself  
and Mr. Pinckney on the subject ; and if possible  
without the authorised rejection from the service of  
tbe United States ot Bntish seamen who have not  
been two years in it. Should it he impossible to a­  
void this concession on the part of the UniudStates,  
it ought, as of itsclt more than a reasonable piice  
for future lecurity, to extend the reparation due for  
the part.  
  
nut beyond these indispensible renditions, the U­  
n.tcd Stales have a right to expert every solemnity  
of form and every other ingredient of leuihution  
and respect which according to usage and the sen­  
timents of mankind, are proper in the strongest  
cases ol insult to the rights and sovereignly of a na­  
tion. And the British government is to he appris­  
ed of the importance of a full compliance with this  
expectation to the thorough healing of the wound  
which has been made m the feelings of the Ameri­  
can nation.  
Should it bealledged as a gronnd for declining or  
diminising the satisfaction in this rase, that the U­  
nit. d Slates have themselves taken it by the inter­  
dict contained in the proclamation, the answer will  
he obvious. Hie interdict is a measure, not of re­  
putation, but ot precaution, and would besides he  
amply justified by occurrences prior to the extraor­  
dinary outr igc in question.  
1 he exclusion ol all armed ships whatever from  
our waters, is ill fact so much required hy the ■vex­  
ations and dangers to our peace experienced Irorn  
thru- visits, that the president makes it a sperial  
part ot the charge to you to avoid laying the Unit­  
ed States under any species of restraints from a­  
chiptiug that remedy. Being extended to aH belli­  
gerent nations, none of them could of right com­  
plain, and with the less reason, as the policy of  
most nations has limited the admission of foreign  
ships ot war into their ports, to stich numbers as  
being inferiotir to the naval force of the country,  
l could be readily made to respect its authority and  
laws.  
As it may be useful, in enforcing the justice of  
the present demand, to bring into view applicable  
I cases, especially where Great Britain has been the  
complaining party, I refer you to the gronnd taken  
| and the language held hy her, in those of Falklands  
, island and Nootka Sound, notwithstanding (he as­  
sertion by Spain in both rases, that the real right  
was in her, and the possessory only in Great Bri­  
tain.—These cases will be found in the annual re­  
risteis for 1r71, and 1790, and in the parliamen­  
tary debates for those years. In the latter you will  
tmd also two cases refrired to, in one-of which the  
french king sent an ambassadour extraordinary to  
• the king of Sardinia, in the most solemn and pub­  
hrk manner, with an apology for an infringment of  
Ins territorial rights in the pursuit of a smuggler  
, and a murderfr. In the other rase an ambassadour  
[ extraordinary was sent by the ISiitish government.  
  
with an- apology for the pursuit and destruction by  
admiral Boscawcn of certain French ships on the  
coasts of this last kingdom.  
Many other cases, more or less analogous, may  
doubtless be found; see, particularly the reparation  
by 1-ranee to Great Britain, forihe attack on Turks  
Island in 1/64, as related in the Annual Register  
and in Smollet’s continuation nt Hume, vol. 10, the  
proceedings in- the case of an Mnglish merchant­  
man, which suffered much in tier crew an2f other­  
wise, from the fire of certain Spanish zebecks cruiz  
ingin the Mediterranean : and the execution of the  
lieut. of a privateer, lor firing a gun into a Venetian  
merchantman, which killed the captain, as stated  
in the Annual Register, for 1781, page /4. The  
ease of an affront offered to a Russian ambu9sadour  
in the reign of Queen Ann, though less analogous,  
shews in a general view the solemnity with which  
reparation is made for insults having immediate re­  
lation to the sovereignty of a nation.  
Although the principle which was outraged in  
the proceeding against the Ameiican frigate is in­  
dependent of the question concerning the allegiance  
nl the seamen taken from her, the fact that they  
were citizens of the United States and not British  
subjects, may have such an influence on the conduct  
&quot;l all, and perhaps on the opinions of some unac­  
quainted with the laws and usages of nations, that  
u lias been thought proper to seek more regular  
proofs of their national character than were deemed  
sufficient in the first instance. These proofs will be  
added by this conveyance if obtained in lime, if not  
  
&#x27;•y iiic lust mat sucreeas.  
The president has an evident right to expert from  
J the British government not only an ample reparati­  
on to the United States, in this rase, but that it will  
ne derided without difficulty or delay. Should this  
expectation fail, and above all, should repaiation  
he refused, it will be incumbent on you to lake pro­  
per measures for hastening home urcording to the  
degree of urgency, all American vessels remaining  
in Biitish ports; using for the purpose the inode  
least likely to awaken the attention of the British  
government. Where there may he no ground to  
..istrust the prudence or fidelity of consuls, they will  
probably be lound the fittest vehicles for your inti­  
mations. It will he particularly requisite to com­  
municate tumour publirk ships in the .Mediterranean  
the state of appearances, if it be such as ought to  
! influence their movements.  
| All negotiation with the British government on  
other subjects, will of Course be suspended until sa­  
tisfaction on this be so pledged and arranged as to  
render negotiation honourable. Whatever may be  
the result or the prospect, you will please to forward  
to os the earliest information.  
The srope of the proclamation will signify to you,  
that the president has yielded to the presumption  
that the hostile art of the British commander did  
not pursue the intentions of his government. Ii is  
noi indeed easy to suppose that so rash and so cri­  
tical a step should have originated wilh the admi­  
ral, hut it is still more difficult to believe, that such  
orders were prescribed by any government, under  
circumstances such as existed between G. Britain  
and the U. States.  
  
l-air illations founded on dates, are also strongly |  
opposed to the supposition that the orders in ques­  
tion mold have been transmitted from England. In  
• the same scale, are to be put the apparent and de- j  
clared persuasion of the British representative, Mr.  
Erskine, that no orders of a hostile spirit, could  
have been issued or authorised by bis government;  
and the ro incidence of this assurance with the a­  
micahle professions of Mr. Canning, the organ of  
the new administration, as stated ii&gt; the dispatch  
of April Irom yourself and Mr. Pinckney.  
Pioreeding on these considerations, the president  
has interred that the justice ami honour of the Bri­  
tish government will readily make the atonement  
required ; and in that expectation, he has forborne  
an immediate call of congress ; notwithstanding  
the strong wish which has been manifested by ma­  
ny, that measures depending on their authority,  
should without delay be adopted. The motives to  
this forbearance hare, at the same time, Leen  
strengthened by the policy of avoiding a course  
which might stimulate the British cruizers, in this  
quarter, to arrest our ships and seamen now arriv­  
ing and shortly expected in great numbers from all  
quarters. Ft is probable, however, that the legis­  
lature will be convened in time to receive the an­  
swer of the British government on the subject of  
this dispatch, or even sooner, if the conduct of the  
British squadron here, or other occuirences, should  
require immediate measures beyond the authority of  
the executive.  
In order to give the more expedition and security |  
to the present dispatch, a ptiblick armed vessel, tjie  
Ilevenge, is specially employed ; and Dr. Bullus is  
[ made live bearer, who was on hoard the Chesapeake,  
j on his way to a consulate in the Mediterranean, and  
| will be able to detail and explain circumstances  
which may possibly become interesting in the course  
o! your communications with the British govern­  
ment.  
The vessel, after depositing Dr. Bullus at a Bri­  
tish port, will proceed with dispatches to a French  
port, but will return to England with a view to  
bring the result of your transactions with the Bri­  
tish government. Tfte trip to France will afford  
you and Mr. Pinckney a favourable opportunity of  
communirating with otir minister at Paris, who&quot;be­  
ing instructed to regulate his conduct on the pre­  
sent occasion by the advices they may receive from  
you, will need every explanation that can throw  
light on the probable turn and issue of things with  
Gieat Britain.  
I have the honour to be, 4c. 1

#### 1808-04-01 &middot; [Richmond, Va.](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richmond%2C_Virginia)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
THE documents herewith enclosed,  
from No. 1 to No. 9, inclusive, explain the  
hostile attack with the insulting pretext for  
j it, lately committed near the capes of Vir­  
: ginia by the British ship of war the Leo­  
pard, on the American frigate the Chesa­  
peake. No. 10, is a copy of the proclama­  
tion issued by tile President, interdicting in  
consequence of that outrage the use of our  
waters and evety other accommodation to ail  
British armed ships.  
  
I lws enormity is not a subject for discus­  
sion. The immunity of a national ship of  
war from every species and purpose of  
search on (lie high seas, has never been Con­  
tested by any nation. Great-Britain would  
be sec( nd to none in resenting such a viola­  
tion of her rights and such an insult on her  
flag, hhe may bring the case to the test of  
1.&#x27; r own feelings by supposing, that instead  
of the customary demand of our mariners  
serving compulsively even aboard her ships’  
of war, opportunities h..d been sti7ed for i  
reselling them in like manner, whenever the •  
superiority of force cr the chance of sur­  
prise might be possessed by our ships of war.  
But the j.’fsent case is marked by cir­  
cumstances which give it a peculiar die —  
The seamen taken from the Chesapeake  
had been ascertainedtobc native citirens of,  
the Unite 1 States, and this fact was made  
known to the bearer of the demand, and •  
doubtless communicated by him to his com­  
mander previous to the Commencement of  
the attack. It is a fact also, affirmed by]  
two of the men, with every appearance of  
truth, that they had been impressed from A­  
ni&#x27;-rr an vessels into the British frigate, from  
w.vich they escaped, and by the third, that  
having been impressed from a British mer­  
chant ship, he hod accepted of the recruit­  
ing bounty under that duress, and with a  
view to alleviate his nation, till he could  
&#x27;• rape to his ov m country : and that the at­  
tack was made during a peri *1 of nogoeia­  
[&#x27;•‘‘Ori, an-.l :: the midst rf friendly assurances  
I from the British government.  
  
The printed papers--herewith sent will en­  
able you to judge of the spirit which has been  
roused by the occasion. It pervades the  
whole community ; is abolishing the distinc­  
tions of party ; and regarding only the indig­  
nity offered to the sovereignty and flag of  
the nation, and the blood of citizens so wan­  
tonly and wickedly shed, demands in the  
loudest tone an honorable reparation.  
With this demand you are charged by the  
President. The tenor of his proclamation will  
be.your guide in reminding the British go­  
vernment of the uniform proofs given by the  
United States of their disposition to maintain  
faithfully every friendly relation; of the mul­  
tiplied infractions of their rights by British  
naval commanders on our coasts and harbors ;  
of the inefficacy of reiterated appeals to the  
justtice and friendship of that government:  
and of the moderation on the part of the U.  
States, which reiterated disappointments had  
not extinguished; till at length no alterna­  
tive is left, but a voluntary satisfaction en  
the part of G. Britain, or a resort to means  
depending on the U. States alone.  
The nature and extent of the satisfaction  
ought tube suggested to the British govern­  
ment, not less by a sense of its own honor  
than by justice to that of the the U. States.  
A formal disavowal of the deed and resto­  
ration of the four seamen to the ship from  
wh ich they were taken, are things of course  
and indispensible. As a security for the fu­  
ture, an entire abolition of impressments  
from vessels under the flag of the U. States,  
if not already arranged, is also to make an  
indispensible part of the satisfaction. The  
abolition must be on terms compatible with  
the instructions to yourself and Mr. Pinkney  
on this subject; and if possible without the  
authorised rejection from the service of the  
United States, of British seamen who have  
net been two years in it. Should it be im­  
possible to avoid this concession on the part  
of the U. States, it ought, as of itself more  
than a reasonable price for future secu­  
rity, to extend the reparation due for the  
  
past.  
But beyoml these inclispcnsible conditions,  
the United States have a right to expect e­  
very solemnity of form and every other in­  
gredient of retribution and respect which  
according to usage and the sentiments of  
mankind, arc proper in the strongest cases  
of insult to the rights and sovereignty of a  
nation. And the British government is to he  
apprised of the importance, of a full compli­  
ance with this expectation, to the thorough  
healing of the wound which has been made  
in the feelings of the American nation.  
Should it be alledged as a ground for de­  
clining or I diminishing the satisfaction in this  
case, that the United St.ates have themselves  
taken it by the interdict contained in the  
proclamation, the answer will be obvious.—  
The interdict is a measure, not of reparati­  
on, but ef precaution, and would besides  
be amply justified by occurrences prior to  
the extraordinary outrage in question.  
I The exclusion of all armed ships whatever  
from our waters, is in fact so mach requir­  
i ed by &gt;he vexations and clangers to our peace  
experienced from their visits, that the Presi­  
dent makes it a special part of the charge  
to you to avoid laying the U. States under  
| any species of restraint from adopting that  
r remedy. Being extended to all belligerent na­  
tions, none of them could of right complain, Sc  
with the less reason, as the policy of most  
nations has limited the admission cf foreign  
ships of war into their ports, to such num­  
ber s as being inferior to the naval force of j  
the country, could be readily made to res­  
pect its authority and laws.  
As it may be useful, in enforcing the jus­  
tice of the present demand, to bring into  
view applicable cases, especially where G.  
Britain has been the complaining party, I re­  
fer you to the ground taken and the language  
held by her, in those of Falkland’s island  
and Nootka Sound, notwithstanding the as­  
sertion by Spain in both cases, that the real  
right was in her, and the possessory only in  
Great-Britain.—These cases will be found  
in the .Annual Registers for 1771, and 1799,  
and in the parliamentary debates for those  
years. In the latter you will find also two  
cases referred to, inoneof which the French  
king sent an embassador extraordinary to the  
king of Sardinia, in the most solemn and  
public manner, with an apology for an in­  
fringement of his territorial rights in the  
pursuit of a smuggler &amp; a murderer. In the  
other case an embassador extraordinary was  
sent by the British government with an a­  
pologyfor the pursuit and destruction by ad­  
miral Boscawen.of certain French ships on  
the coasts of this last kingdom.  
  
Many other cases, more or less analogous, |  
may doubtless he found ; see, particularly &#x27;  
the reparation by France to G. Britain, for  
the attack, on Turks island in 1764, as re- i  
iated in the Annual Register 8cm Smoilet’s  
continuation of Hume, vol. 10, the proceed-j  
ings in the case of an English merchant­  
man, which suffered much in her crew and  
otherwise, from&#x27; the fire of certain Spanish  
zebccs cruizing in the Mediterranean : and  
the execution of the Lt. of a privateer, f«r  
firing a gun into a Venetian merchantman,!  
which killed the captain, as stated in the !  
Annual Register, for 1781, page 74. The i  
case of an affront offered to a Russian am- I  
bassador in the reign of Queen Anne, though I  
less analogous, shews in a general view the  
solemnity with which reparation is made for  
insults having immediate relation to the so­  
vereignty of a nation.  
Although the principle which was outra­  
ged in the proceeding against the Amrri-j  
can frigate is independent of the question  
concerning the allegiance of the seamen ta­  
ken from her, the fact that they were citizens  
of the U. S. and not British subjects, may  
&#x27;have such an influence on the conduct of all,  
and perhaps on the opinions of some unac­  
quainted with the laws and usages of nati­  
ons, that it has been thought proper to seek  
more regular proofs of their national charac­  
! ter than were deemed sufficient in the first!  
1 instance. These proofs will be added by  
; this conveyance if obtained in time, if not , j  
by the fit u that succeeds.  
T he president has an evident right to ex­  
pect from the British government not. only  
. an ample reparation to the United States, in  
j this case, but that it will be decided without  
i difficulty or delay. Should this expectation  
fail, and above all, should reparation be rc­  
&lt; fus&#x27; d, ik will be incumbent or, you to take  
  
proper measures for hastening home, accord­  
ing to the decree of urgency, all American  
vessels remaining in British ports ; using for  
; the purpose, the mode least likely to awaken  
the attention of the British government_  
I here there may he no ground to distrust  
the prudence or fidelity of consuls, they will  
probably be found the fittest vehicles for  
your intimations. It will be particularly  
requisite to communicate to our public ships  
in the Mediterranean the state of appear­  
ances, if it be such as ought to influence their  
movements.  
All negotiation with the British govern­  
ment on other subjects, will .of course be sus­  
pended, until satisfaction on this be so pledg­  
ed and arranged as to render negotiation  
honourable. Whatever may be the result  
or the prospect, you will please to forward  
to us the earliest information.  
The scope of the proclamation will signi­  
fy to you, that the president has yielded to  
tlie presumption that the hostile act of the  
British commander did not pursue the in­  
tentions of his government. It is not indeed  
easy to suppose that so rash and so critical  
a step should have originated with the ad- i  
mirai, but it is still more difficult to believe, 1  
that such orders w’ere prescribed by any I  
government, under circumstances such as  
existed between G. Britain and the U.  
States.  
Calculations founded on dates, are also  
strongly opposed to the supposition that the  
orders in question could have been transmit­  
ted from England. In the same scale, are  
to be put the apparent and declared persua- ■  
sion of the British representative, Mr. Er- j  
skmc, that no orders of a hostile spirit, could \
have been issued or authorised by his go- j  
vernment ; and the co-incidence of this as­  
surance with the amicable professions of  
Mr. Canning, tile organ of the new admini­  
stration, as stated in the dispatch of April  
22d, from yourself and Mr. Pinkney.  
Proceeding on these considerations, the  
president lias inferred that the justice and  
honor of the British government will readi­  
  
iv make the atonement required ; and in  
that expectation, lie has forborne an imme­  
diate call of congress ; notwithstanding the  
strong wish which has been manifested by  
many, that measures depending on their au­  
thority, should without delay lie adopted.—  
The motives to this forbearance have, at the  
same time, been strengthened by the policy  
ot avoiding a course which might stimulate  
the British cruizcrs in this quarter, to ar­  
rest our ships and ceamen now arriving and  
shortly expected in great numbers from all  
quarters. It is probable, however, that the  
legislature will be convened in time to re­  
ceive the answer of the British government  
on the subject of this dispatch or even soon­  
er, if the conduct of the British squadron  
here, or other occurrences, should require  
immediate measures beyond the authority of  
Inc CACUitiVC.  
In order to give the more expedition and  
j security to the present dispatch, a public  
| armed vessel, the Revenge, is specially em­  
ployed ; and Dr. Bullus is made the bearer,  
who was on board the Chesapeake, on his  
way to a consulate in the Mediterranean, St  
will be able to detail and explain circum­  
stances which may possibly become interest­  
ing in the course of your communications  
with tlie British government.  
1 he vessel, after depositing l)r. Bullus at  
a British port, will proceed with dispatches  
to a French port, but will return to England  
with a view to bring the result of your  
transactions with the British government.—  
The trip to France will afford you and Mr.  
Pinkney a favorable opportunity of commu­  
nicating with our ministers at Paris, who  
being instructed to regulate their conduct on  
the present occasion by the advices they  
may receive from you, will need every ex­  
planation that can throw light on the proba­  
ble turn and issue of things with G. Bri­  
tain.

This enormity is not a subject foi

communicated h&#x27;y him to his con­  
mandef previr.ua to the commenct­

affirmed by two oftnemei with every

the interdict contained in thw: procla­

1 he interdict is a measure, not o  
reparation, but of precaution, and  
would besides be amply justified by  
occurrences prior to tile extraordi­  
nary outrage in question. ,  
The exclusion of all armed ships  
whatever from our waters, is in fact  
o much required (b the vexations

dent makes it a spetSal pft of the  
charge to you, to avoid&#x27; laying -he  
United States under aDypecies of

Being extended to all belligerent na­  
tion, none of.ihem cou of right  
complain, and with the lcjss reason,  
as the Klicy of most nations has li­  
mited the admission of foreign ships  
of war into their:orts,!to such num­  
ber as being inferior to the naval  
force of the country, ctiuld be readily

Slß—The docil&#x27;mg){tgherewith en­  
closed, from No. 1 to No. g, inclusive,  
explain the holtile attack with the in­  
sulting pretext for it, lately commit­  
‘ted near the Capes of Virginia by the  
British ship of War the I.copard, on  
the American frigate the Chesapeake.  
No. 10, is a copy of the Proclamation  
ifflued by the President, interdiéting in  
consequence of ‘that outrage the use of  
our waters and every other accommo­  
dationn to all Biitith armied thips.  
This enormity is not a subj:&amp; for  
discussion. The immugity of a na­  
ticnal fliip of war from every species  
and purpose of featch on the high seas,  
has never been contested by any na:  
tion. Great Britain wounld be second  
to nome in resenting {uch a violation  
of her rights and fiich an insult on her  
flag. She may bring the case to the  
telt of her own feelings by fuppoling  
that instead of the customary demand  
of our mariners serving compulsively  
even on board her ships of war, op:  
&quot; portunities had been seized for rescu­  
ing them in like manner whenever the  
faperiority of force or the chance of  
surprise might be pofltffed by our  
{hips of war. .  
But the present caf&gt; is marked by  
circumstances which give it a peculiar  
die. The seamen taken from the  
Chesapeake had.been ascertained to  
be native citizens of the Urited States,  
and this fa&amp; was made known to the  
bearer of the demand, and doubtless  
communicated by him to his com­  
mander previous to the commepce­  
ment of the attack. It is a fa&amp; also,  
affirnied by two of the men, with evs  
_ery appearance of truth, that they had  
been impressed frém American vessels  
into the Briti(h frigaté from whichthey  
escaped, and by tge third, that having  
been imprefled from a Britift met­  
chant ship, he had accepred the te.  
cruiting bounty under that duress and  
-with a view to alleviate his situation,  
till he could escape to his own coun­  
try : and Hat the artack was made  
during a period of negoeiation, and in  
the midst of friendly assurances from  
the British government.  
&quot; The printed papers herewith sent  
- witl enable you to judge of the spirit  
- which has been roused by the occation.  
1t pervades the *hmmmunuy s  
~abolithing the diltinétions of party 5  
aharesarmonuw::?&amp; &quot;  
  
the naticm; and the blood of citizens  
so wantonly and wickedly shed, de­  
mands in the loudest tone an henora­  
ble reparation.  
With this demand you are charged  
by the Prefiderit. The tendr of his  
proclamation will be your guide in  
reminding the British government of  
the uniform proofs given by the U­  
nited States of their disposition to  
maimtain faithfilly every friendly re­  
lation ; of thie multiplied infraétions  
of their rights by Britith naval com­  
manders on our coasts and in our har­  
bors; of the insflicacy of reiterated ap­  
peals to the jultice and friendfliip of  
that government ; and of the modera­  
tion on the part of the United States,  
which reiterated difappo:ntments had  
not extinguished ; till at length no al.  
ternative is left, but a voluntaly fat­  
isfaction on the part of Great Britain,  
or a resort to means depending cn the  
United States alone.  
The nature and extent of the {fartif­  
faltion ought to be fuggelied to the  
Britilh goveramient, not less by 2 sense  
of its own Lonor than by julice to that  
of the United States. A formal dis­  
avowal of the deed, and restoration of  
the four seamen to the thip from which |  
they were taken, are things of course,  
and indifpenfible. As a security for  
the future; an entire abolition of im­  
preflments from veflels under the flag  
of the United States, if not already ar-.  
ranged, is also to make an iadifpenfi­  
ble part of the fatisfaltion. The a­  
bolition mu&amp; be on terms compatible  
with the inftrudions to yoorfelf and  
Mr. Piokoey on this fubje&amp; 5 and if  
possible without the authorifed rejac­  
tiop from the service of the United -  
Srates of British seamen who havenot  
been two years in it. Should it be  
impossible to avoid tlis concession on  
the part of the United States, it ought,  
as of itfclf more than a reasonable  
price for future fecuriiy, to ex:end the  
reparation due for the past.  
But beyond these indfpenfible con­  
ditions, the United Stares have a fight  
to exped every folemrnity of form and  
every other ingredient of retribution  
and refpet which according to usage  
and the sentiments of mankind, are  
proper in the firongelt cases of insult  
to the rights and sovereignty # a na­  
tion. And the British government is  
to be apprized of the importance of a  
foil compliance wich this expeation  
to the thorough healing of the wound  
which has been miade in the feelings  
ot the American nation. -  
Should it be alledged a 3 4 grotnd  
for declinifig or diminishing the fatif­  
faftion in this case, that the Unired  
States bave themfclves taken it by the  
interdi€®t contained in the proclama­  
tion, the answer will be obviovis. The  
interdi&amp;t is 2 meaftive, not of repara­  
tion, but of precaution, and would be­  
sides be amoply juftified by occurrenc­  
es prior to the extraordinary oiitrage  
in question. Lo R  
The exclusion of all armed ships  
whatever from our waters, is in faét so  
much fequired by the vexations-and  
dangers to our peace experienced {rom  
their visits, that the President makes  
it a special part of the charge to you,  
to avoid layiog the United States in­  
der any species of restraint from adopt­  
ing that remedy. Being extended to  
all belligerent nations, none of them  
could of right cowplain, aud with the  
less reason, as ‘the policy of most na.  
tions has limited the a,emiﬁ}on&#x27; of for­  
eign ships of war-into their ports, to  
“fach numbers as being inferior to the.  
naval force of the country, coiild be  
readily made to refpe its authority  
and laws. \ o -  
As it miay bße uvfeful, in enforcing  
the justice of the preferit demand; to  
bring into view applicable cases, efpe-.  
cially where Great Britain has been  
the complaining party, I refer you to  
the ground taken and the language  
held by her, in those of Falkland’s Isl.  
and and Nootka Sound, notwith{tand­  
ing the assertion by Spain in both caf­  
“&amp;s, thart the real right. was in her, and  
the pofleffory only .in Great Britain.  
These cases will be found in the An­  
ntial Regißers for 1971, and 1790,  
and in the parliamentary debates for  
those years: In the latter yon will  
find alfp two cases referted to, in one  
~of which the French king sent an am-*  
baffador extraordinary to the king of  
Sardinia, in the most public and fol  
’emn manner, WW“‘*“%”“&quot;»  
infringement of his werritorial rights in  
“the 9»?&amp;*&quot;05&amp;*% and murder­  
er. ~Tn the other cafg, an ambafador  
  
[Two DOLLS~PER ANNUM.]  
  
with an apology, for the pursuit and de.  
ftru&amp;tion by admiral Bofcawin of cer­  
tain Freach ships on the coalts of this  
last kingdom. Many othér cases, more  
or less analagous, may doubtless be  
found ; fee, particularly the reparation  
by I&#x27;ranse to Great Britain, for the at­  
tack ori Turks Island in 1764, as relat­  
&amp;d in/the Annual Register and in Smol­  
let’s continnation of Hume, vol. I¢, the  
proceedings in the case of an English  
merchantman, which {uffered much in  
her crew and otherwise, from the fire  
of certain Spanith 2ebecs cruizing in the  
IMediterranean ; and the execution of  
the licutesnt of 2 privateer, for firing  
a gdn’ into a Venutan merchantman,  
which killed the captain, as stated in the  
Annual Regilter, for 1&amp;8!, page 94.  
The case of an affront offered to a Ruf­  
fian ambaflador in the reign of Queen  
Aun, though less analogous, shews ina  
general view, the solemnity withewhich  
repatation is made, for insults having  
immediate Iciation to the sovereignty  
of a nation. 5  
Although the principle which was  
outraged in the proceedings against the  
American frigate is independent of the  
question concerning the allegiance of  
the seaman taken from her,-the fa&amp; that  
they were citizens of the United States,  
and not British fubje&amp;s, may bave such  
an infuence on the feelings of all, and  
perhaps on the opinions of some unac­  
quainted with the laws and usages of  
nations, that it has been thought pro­  
per to seek more regular proofs of their  
national charadler thdan were deemed  
fufficient in the firft instance. These  
proofs will be added by this cofiveyance  
if obtained in timg, if not by the firlt  
that fuecceeds. |  
The President has an evident right  
to expe&amp; from the British government  
not only an ample reparation to the  
United States, in this case, but that it  
will be decided without difficulty or de­  
lay.: Should this expe&amp;ation fail, and  
above all, fliould reparation be refufed,  
it will be incombent ot you to take  
proper measures for hastening home, ac­  
cording to the degtee of urgency, all  
American vessels remaining in PBritifh  
ports ; using for the purpose, the mode  
least likely to awaken the gttention of  
the Britith government. Where there  
may be no ground to distrust the pru­  
dence or‘fidelity of consuls, they will  
probably be found the fitteft vehicles  
for your intimations. It will be par­  
ticularly requisite to communicate to  
our public ships in the Mediterranean,  
the (tate of appearances, if it be such as  
ought to influence their movements.  
All negociation, with the Britith gov­  
etnment on other fubje@s, will of course  
be fulpended until fatisfa&amp;ion on this  
be so pledged and arranged as to ren­  
der negociation honorable.—Whatever  
may be the result or the profpe&amp;, you  
will pleafle to forward to us the earlielt  
information.  
The scope of the proclamation will  
fignify to you that the President bas  
yielded to the presumption that the hos­  
tile a&amp; of the Britilh commander did  
not pursue the intentions of his govern­  
ment. It is not indeed easy to suppose  
that {o rath and so critical a step thould  
have originated with the Admiral, but  
it is &amp;ill more difficult to believe, that  
fiich orders were prescribed by any gov­  
erninent, under - circamftances such as  
existed between Great Britain and the  
United States.  
Calculations foinded on dates, are  
allo strongly opposed to the supposition  
that the orders in question could have  
been transmitted from England. In  
the fame scale, are to be put the appa­  
rent agd declared persuasion of the Bri­  
tith regrefemative, Mr. Etfkine, that  
no orders of a hoftide fpirity conld have  
been issued or authorifed by his govern­  
ment ; and the co-incidence of this as­  
surance with the amicable profeflions of  
Mr. Canning, the organ of the new ad­  
ministration, as Rated in the dispatch  
of April 22d, from yourfelf and Mr.  
Pinckney. %  
“Proceeding on thiefe considerations, the  
President ‘has ionferred that the justice and  
honor of the Britith government will readily  
.make the atonement required 3 and in that  
expetation, he has forborne an immediate  
call of Congress : notwith@tanding the ftroag

London after the attack on the Chesa­  
peake, the first notes between our mini­  
ster and the British government on that  
subject, and a letter from Mr. Munroe,  
detailing the substance of some subse­  
quent communications, and his observa­  
tions relative to the disposition of the  
British government and people towards  
this country. The instructions did not  
reach Prlr. Munroe until about the first  
of September. The communications just  
mentioned, it will be observed, are dated  
before that time.]  
[From Mr. Madison to Mr. Munroe.]  
Department of State, July, 6, 180T.  
Sir,  
The documents herewith inclosed  
from No. 1 to No. 0 inclusive, explain  
the hostile attack, with the insulting  
pretext for it, lately committed near the  
cape of Virginia by the British ship of  
war Leopard, on the American frigate  
Chesapeake. No. 10 is a copy of the  
-ocUmation issued by the picsident,  
  
interdicting in consequence of that out­  
rage the use of our waters and every  
other accommodation to all British arm­  
ed ships.  
This enormity i3 not a subject for  
discussion. The immunity of a nation­  
al ship ol war lrom every species and  
purpose of search on the high seas, has  
never been contested by any nation_  
Cheat Britain would be second to  
none in resenting such a violation of her  
rights and such an insult on her flag.  
She may bring the case to the test of her  
I own. feelings, by supposing that instead  
ol tile customary demand of our seamen  
serving compulsively even on hoard her  
ships of war, opportunities had been  
seized for rescuing them, in like man­  
ner, whenever the superiority of force  
or the chance of surprize might be pos­  
sessed by our ships of war.  
  
luit the present case is marked bv  
circumstances which give it a peculiar  
dye. The seamen taken from the Che­  
sapeake had been ascertained to be na­  
tive citizens of the United States, and  
this fact was made known to the bearer  
of the demand, and doubtless commu­  
nicated by him to his commander pre­  
vious to the commencement of the at­  
tack.—It is a fact also, affirmed by two  
of the men, with every appearance of  
truth, that they had been impressed  
from American vessels into the British  
frigate, from which they escaped, and  
by the third, that having been impres­  
sed from a British merchant ship, he  
had accepted the recruiting bounty un­  
der that duress and with a view to alle­  
viate his situation, till- he could escape  
to his own country ; and that the attack  
was made during a period of negoti­  
ation, and in the midst of friendly assu­  
rances from the British government.  
The printed papers herewith sent,  
will enable you to judge of the spirit  
which has been roused by the occasion.  
It pervades the whole community—is  
abolishing the distinction of party—and  
! regarding only the indignity offered to  
the sovereignty and flag of the nation,  
and the blood of citizens so wantonly  
! and wickedly shed, demands in the loud­  
est tone an honourable reparation.  
With this demand you are charged  
by the president. The tenour of his  
proclamation will he your guide in re­  
minding the British government of the  
uniform proofs giv-n by the United  
States, of their disposition to maintain  
faithfully every frit ndly re&#x27;ation ; of  
the multiplied infractions of their rights  
  
by British, naval commanders oft our  
coasts and in our harbours ; of the in­  
efficacy of reiterated appeals to the jus­  
tice and friendship of that government;  
and the moderation on the part of the  
United States, which reiterated .disap­  
pointments had not extinguished ; • till  
at length no alternative is left, but a vo­  
luntary satisfaction on the part of Great  
Britain, ora resort to means depending  
on the U. S. alone.,  
The nature and extent of the satisfac­  
tion ought to be suggested to the Bri­  
tish government, not less by a sense of  
its own honour than by justice to that of  
of the United States. A formal disa­  
vowal ol the deed, and restoration of  
the four seamen to the ship from which  
they were taken, arc things of course,  
and indispensable. As a security for  
the future, an entire abolition of im­  
pressments from vessels under the flag  
of the United Ststes, if not already ar­  
ranged, is also to make an indispensable  
part of the satisfaction. The abolition  
must be on terms compatible with the  
instructions to yourself &amp; Mr. Pinckney  
cm the subject ; and, if possible, with­  
out the authorized rejection from the  
service of the United States of British  
seamen who have not. been two years  
in it. Should it be impossible to avoid  
U- this concession on the part of the  
nited States, it ought, as of itself more  
than a reasonable price for future secu­  
rity, to extend the reparation due for  
the past.  
  
15ut beyond the se mdiscnsable condi­  
tions the United States have a right to  
expect every solemnity of form and e­  
very other ingredient of retribution and  
respect which according to usage and  
the sentiments of.mankind, arc proper  
in the strongest cases of insult to the  
rights and sovereignty of a nation. And  
the British government is ,to be appriz­  
ed of the importance of a full compli­  
ance with this exp ctaiion to the thor­  
ough healing of the wound which has  
been made on the feelings of the Ame­  
rican nation. &lt;  
Should it he alleged as a ground for;  
declining or diminishing the satisfac­  
tion in this case, that the United Stales  
h ive themselv&#x27;-s taken it !&gt;v the int&lt; rdict  
contained in the proclamation, the an­  
swer will Ik* obvious. The interdict*is  
a measure, not of reparnti &gt;n,-but of pre­  
caution, and wouM Iicsdes be amplv jus­

•whatever from our waters, is in fact so  
much required by the vexations &amp; dan­  
gers to our peace experienced from their  
visits, that the president makes it a spe­  
cial part of the charge to you, to avoid  
laying the United States under any spe­  
cies of restraint from adopting that re­  
medy. Being extended to all bellige­  
rent nations none of them could of right  
complain, and with the less reason, as  
the policy of most nations has limited  
the admission of foreign ships of war  
into their ports, to such numbers as be­  
ing inferior to the naval force of the  
country, could be readily made to respect  
its authority and laws.  
As it may be useful, in enforcing the  
justice of the present demand, to bring  
into view applicable cases, especially  
where Great Britain has been the com­  
plaining party, I refer you to the ground  
taken, and the language held by her, in  
those of Falkland’s island and Nootka  
Sound, notwithstanding the assertion in  
Spain in both cases, that the real right  
was in her, and the possessory only in  
Great Britain. These cases will he  
  
found in the annual registers for 1771,  
and 1790, and in the parliamentary de­  
bates for those years. In the latter you  
find also, two cases referred to, in one  
of which the French king sent an am­  
bassadour extraordinary to the king of  
Sardinia, in the most publick and so­  
lemn manner, with an apology for an  
infringement of his territorial rights in  
the pursuit of a smuggler and murderer.  
In the other case, an ambassadour ex­  
traordinary was sent by the British go­  
vernment to the court of Portugal, witli  
an apology for the pursuit and destruc­  
tion, by admiral Boscawen, of certain  
French ships on the coast of this last  
V.ingdom. Many other cases, more or  
less analogous, may doubtless be found ;  
see, particularly, the reparation by  
France to Great Britain, for the attack  
on Turk’s islands in 17G4, as related in  
the annual reg:ster, and in Smollet’s  
continuation of Hume, vol. 10; in the  
j proceedings in the case of an English  
merchantman, which suffered much in  
her crew and otherwise, from the fire  
of certain Spanish xebecks cruising in  
the Mediterranean ; and the execution  
of the lieutenant of a privateer, for firing  
a gun into a Venetian merchantman,  
which killed the captain, as stated in the  
Annual Register for 1781, page 94.—  
The case of an affront offered to a Rus­  
&#x27; sian ambassadour in the reign of queen  
A nn though less analogous, shows, in a  
  
general view, the solemnity with which  
reparation is made, for insults having  
immediate relation to the sovereignty  
of a nation.  
Although the principle which was  
outraged in the proceedings against the  
American frigate, is independent oflthe  
question concerning the allegiance of the  
seamen taken from her, the fact that  
they were citizens of the United States,  
and not British subjects, may have such  
an influence on the feelings of all, and  
perhaps on the opinions ol some unac­  
quainted with the laws and usage of na­  
tions, that it has been thought proper to  
seek more regular proofs of their na­  
tional character than were deemed suf­  
ficient in the first instance. These  
proofs will be added by this convey­  
ance, if obtained in time, if not by the  
first that succeeds.  
  
1 he President has an eviuen right  
to expect from the British government,  
not only an ample reparation to the  
United States, in this case, but that it  
will be decided without difficulty or de­  
lay. Should this expectation fail, and  
above all, should reparation be refused,  
it will be incumbent on you to take  
proper measures for hastening home,ac­  
cording to the degree of urgency, all  
American vessels remaining in Bri­  
tish ports. Where there may be no  
ground to distrust the prudence or fide­  
lity of consuls, they will probably be  
found the fittest, vehicles for your inti­  
mations. It will be particularly requi­  
site to communicate to our publick  
ships in the JVIeditcranean, the state of  
appearances, if it be such as ought to  
influence their movements.  
All negociation with the British go­  
vernment on other subjects, will of;  
course be suspended until satisfaction on &#x27;  
this be so pledged &amp; arrged as to render  
negociation honourable. Whatever may  
be the result or the prospect, you will  
please to forward to us the earliest infor­  
mation.  
The scope of the proclamation will  
signify to you that the president has  
yielded to the presumption that the hos­  
tile act of the British commander did  
not pursue the intentions of his govern­  
ment. It is not indeed easy to suppose  
that so rash and so critical a step should  
have originated with the admiral, but it  
is still more difficult to believe, that  
such orders were prescribed by any go­  
vernment, under circumstances such as  
existed betw een Great Britain and the  
United States.  
  
Calculations founded on dates., arc also  
strongly opposed to the supposition,  
that the orders in question could have  
been transmitted from England. In the  
same scale, are to be put the apparent S;  
declared persuasion of the British re­  
presentative, Mr. Erskine, that no or­  
ders of a hostile spirit, could have been  
issued or authorized by his government;  
and the coincidence of this assurance  
with the amicable professions of Mr.  
Canning, the organ of the new admini­  
stration, as stated in the dispatch of  
April 22d, from yourself and&#x27;Mr. Pink­  
ney.  
Proceeding on these considerations,  
the president has inferred that the jus­  
tice and honour of the British govern­  
ment will readily make the attonement  
required : and in that expectation, he  
has forbom an immediate call of con­  
gress ; notwithstanding the strong wish  
which had been manifested by many,  
that measures depending on their autho­  
rity, should without delay be adopted.  
The motives to this forbearance, have  
at the same time been strengthened by  
the policy of avoiding a course which  
  
might stimulate the lintish cruisers, in  
this quarter, to arrest our ships and  
seamen now arriving and shortly expect­  
ed in great numbers from all quarters.  
It is probable, however, that the legisla­  
ture will be convened in time to receive  
the answer of the British government on  
the subject of this dispatch, or even  
sooner, if the conduct of the B. squadron  
here, or other occurrences, should re­  
quire immediate measures beyond the  
authority of the executive.  
In order to give the more expedition  
and security to the present dispatch, a  
publick armed vessel, the Revenge, is  
specially employed ; and doctor Bul­  
lus is made the bearer, who was on  
board the Chesapeake, on his way to a  
consulate in the Meditereanean, and  
will be able to detail and explain circum­  
stances which may possibly become in­  
teresting in the course of your commu­  
nications with the British government.  
The Vessel after depositing doctor  
Bullus at a British port, will proceed  
with dispatches to a French port, but  
will return to England with a view to  
bring the result of your transactions with  
the British government. The trip to  
France will afford you and Mr. Pink­  
nty a favourable opportunity Of commu­  
nicating with our ministers at Paris,  
who being instructed to regulate their  
conduct on the present occasion by the  
advices they may receive from you, will

formal disavowal of the deed, and _ restora-

which they were taken, are things of course,  
and indispensable.: Asa security for the fu-  
ture, an entire abolition of impressmen!s

if not already arranged, is also to make  
ah indispensible part of the satisfaction. ‘Lhe

by recurrences prior to the extraordinary |  
outrage in question. —The exclusion of all |  
armed ships whatever from our waters, is |  
in fact somuch required by the vexations  
and dangers to @ur peace experienced from  
their visits, that the president. makes it a  
special part of the charge to you, to avoid  
laying the U. States under any species of  
restraint from adopting that remedy. Be-  
jng extended to all belligerent nations none  
of them could of right complain, and with  
the less reason, as the policy of most na-  
tions nas limited the admission of foreign  
ships of war into their ports, to such num-  
bers as being inferior to the naval force of  
the country, could be readily made to res-  
pect its authority and jaws —As it may be  
useful, in enforcins the ruastice of the pre-  
sent demaad, to bring into view applicable  
ss, especially where G. Britain has  
bee, the complaining party, I vefer you to  
the ground taken and the japguage held by  
her, in those of Falkland’s istand and Nootka  
Sound, notwithstanding the assertion by  
Spain in both cases, that the real rigit was  
in her, and the possessory on!y in G. Britain,  
‘These cases wil] be found in the Annual Re-  
  
Case  
  
‘gisters for 1771, and 1790, and in the parlia-  
  
mentary debates for those years. In the lat-  
ter you will find also, two cases referred to,  
in one of which the French king sent an am-  
bassador extraordinary to the king of Sardinia,  
in the most public and solemn manner. with  
av apology for an infringement of bis terri-  
torial rights in the pursuit of a smuggler and  
murderer. In the other ease. an ambassador  
extraordinary was sent by the British govern-  
ment to the court of Portugal, with an apolo-  
gy for the pursuit and destruction, by admi-  
ral Buscawen, of certain French ships on the  
coastsof this last kingdom. Many other  
cases, more or less analagous, may doubtless  
be found; see, particularly, the reparation  
by France to G. Britain, for the attack on  
‘Turk’s island in 1764, as related in the An-  
nual Register, and in Smollet’s continuation  
of Hume, vol. 10; the proceedings in the  
case of an English merchantman, which suf-  
fered much in her crew and otherwise, from  
the fire of certain Spanish xebecs cruizing  
in the Mediterranean ; and the execution of  
the lieutenant of a privateer, for firing a gun  
into a Venetian merchantman, which killed  
the captain, as stated in the Annual Register  
for 1781, page 04. The case of an affront  
offered to a Russian ambassador in the reign  
of queen Ann, though Jess analagous, shews,  
in a gene ‘al view, the solemnity with which  
reparatiou is made, for ijsults having imme-  
diate relation to the sovereignty of a nation.

ged in the proceedings against the American  
frigate isindependent ot the question con-  
cerning the allegiance of the seamen taken  
from her, the fact that they were citizens of  
the U. States, and not British subjects, may  
have such an influence on the feelings of  
all, and perhaps on the opinions of some un-  
acquainted with the laws and usages of na-  
tions, that it has been thought proper to seek  
more regular proofs of their national chare  
acter than were deemed-sufficient in the first  
instance, ‘These proofs will be added by  
this conveyance, if obtained in time, if  
not by the first that suecceeds.—The presi-  
dent has an evident right to expect from the  
British government, not only an ample  
reparation to the U. States, in this case,  
but that it will be decided without difficulty  
or delay. Should this expectation fail, and  
above all, should reparation be refused, it  
will be incumbent on you to take proper  
measures for hastening home, according to  
the degree of urgency, all American vessels  
remaining in British por&amp;; using for the  
purpose, the mede least likely to awaken the  
attention of the British government. Where  
there may be no ground to distrast the pru-  
dence or fidelity of consuls, they will proba-  
bly be found the fittest vehicles for your in-  
timations. _ It will be particularly requisite  
tocommunicate to our public ships in the  
Mediterranean the state of appearances, if  
it be such as ought toinfluence their moves  
ments.—All negociation with the British  
covernment on other subjects, will of course  
be suspended until satisfaction on this be  
so pledged and arranged as to render nego-  
ciation honorable. Whatever may be the  
result or the prospect, you will please to  
forward to us the earliest information.—  
The scope of the proclamation will signify  
to you that the president has yielded to the  
presumption that the hostile act of the Bri-  
tish commander did not pursue the intentions  
of his government. It is not indeed easy  
to suppose that so rash and so criti@al a step  
should have originated with the admiral,  
but it is still more difficult to believey that  
such orders were prescribed by any govern-  
ment, under circumstances such as existed  
between G. Britain and the U. States.—~  
Calculations founded on dates, are also  
strongly opposed to the supposition, that the  
orders in question could have been transmitted  
from England. In the same scale, are tobe  
put the apparent and declared persuasion of  
the British representative, Mr. Erskine,  
that no orders of a hostile spirit, could have  
been issued or authorised by his govern-  
ment; and the coincidence of this assu-  
rance with the amicable professions of Mr,
