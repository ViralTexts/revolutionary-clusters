men of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
8 Dec. 1798  
  
While with reverence and resignation, we contemplate the dispensations of divine providence, in the alarming and destructive pestilence, with which several of our Cities and Towns have been visited there is cause for gratitude and mutual congratulations, that the malady has disappeared, and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety, at the seat of Government, for the discharge of our important duties. But when we reflect that this fatal disorder has within a few years, made repeated ravages in some of our principal Sea ports &amp; with increased malignancy, &amp; when we consider the magnitude of the evils, arising from the interuption of public &amp; private business, whereby the national interests are deeply affected; I think it my duty to invite the Legislature of the union to examine the expediency of establishing suitable regulations in aid of the health laws of the respective states; for these being formed on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicated thro’ the channels of commerce, there seems to be a necessity, that congress, who alone can regulate trade should frame a system, which while it may tend to preserve the general health may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of the revenue.  
While we think on this calamity, &amp; sympathise with the immediate sufferers, we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme being our annual oblations of gratitude, for a liberal participation in the ordinary blessings of his providence. To the usual subjects of gratitude, I cannot omit to add one of the first importance to our well being &amp; safety. I mean that spirit, which has arisen in our country against the menaces and aggression of a foreign nation. A manly sense of national honor, dignity &amp; independence has appeared which, if encouraged and invigorated by every branch of the Government, will enable us to view undismayed, the enterprizes of any foreign power, and become the sure foundation of national prosperity and glory.  
The course of the transactions in relation to the United States and France which have come to my knowledge during your recess will be made the subject of a future communication. That communication will confirm the ultimate failure of the measures, which have been taken by the government of the United States towards an amicable adjustment of differencies with that power. You will at the same time perceive, that the French goverment appears solicitous to impress the opinion, that it is averse to a rupture with this country, and that it has in a qualified manner, declared itself willing to receive a minister from the United States for the purpose of restoring a good understanding.—It is unfortunate for professions of this kind that they should be expressed in terms which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to prescribe the qualifications which a minister from the United States should possess, and that, while France is asserting the existence of a disposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the differencies which have arisen, the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of the United States, of which so many demonstrative proofs have been given, should even be indirectly questioned. It is also worthy of observation, that the decree of the directory, alledged to be intended to restrain the depredations of French cruizers on our commerce, has not given and cannot give any relief, it enjoins them to conform to all the laws of France, relative to cruizing  and prizes, while the laws are themselves the sources of the depredations of which we have so long, so justly and so fruitlessly complained.  
The law of France enacted in January last, which subjects to capture and condemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes, if any portion of the latter are of British fabric or produce, although the entire property belong to neutrals, instead of being rescinded, has lately received a confirmation, by the failure of a proposition for its repeal. While this law, which is an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks, continues in force, those nations can see in the French government only a power regardless of their essential rights, of their independence and sovereignty, and if they possess the means, they can reconcile nothing with their interest and honor, but a firm resistance.  
Hitherto, therefore, nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France, which ought to change or relax our measures of defence, on the contrary to extend and invigorate them, is our true policy. We have no reason to regret that these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued and in proportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable Situation of Europe, We Shall discover new and cogent motives for the full development, of our Ennorgies and resources.  
But in demonstrating by our Conduct that We do not fear War in the necessary protection of our Rights and honor, We shall give no room to infer that we abandon the desire of Peace. An efficient preparation for war can alone ensure Peace. It is Peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly cultivated; And Harmony between Us and France may be restored at her Option. But to send another Minister, without more  determinate assurances that he would be received would be an Act of Humiliation to which the United States ought not to Submit. It must therefore be left with France, if she be in is indeed desirous of accommodation, to take the requisite Steps. The United States will steadily observe the Maxims by which they have hitherto been governed. They will respect the Sacred rights of Embassy. And with a Sincere disposition on the part of France to desist from hostility, to make reparation for the Injuries heretofore inflicted on our Commerce and to do Justice in future, there will be no Obstacle to the restoration of a Friendly intercourse. In making to You, this Declaration I give a Pledge to France and to the World that the Executive Authority of this Country Still adheres to the humane and pacific Policy which has invariably governed its proceedings, in conformity with the Wishes of the other Branches of the Government and of the People of the United States. But considering the late Manifestations of her Policy towards foreign Nations, I deem it a Duty deliberately and Solemnly to declare my Opinion, that whether We negotiate with her or not, vigorous preparations for War, will be alike indispensable. These Alone will give to Us, an equal Treaty and ensure its Observance.  
Among the Measures of Preparation which appear expedient I take the Liberty to recall your Attention to the Naval Establishment. The beneficial Effects of the Small Naval Armament provided under the Acts of the last Session are known and acknowledged.—Perhaps no Country ever experienced more Sudden and remarkable Advantages from any measure of Policy than We have derived from the Arming for our maritime Protection and Defence. We ought, without Loss of Time, to lay the Foundation for an increase of our Navy to a Size Sufficient to protect our Coast and protect our Trade. Such a Naval Force, as it is doubtless in the Power of the United States to create and maintain would also afford to them the best means of general Defence by facilitating the Safe transportation of Troops and Stores to every part of our extensive Coast. To accomplish this important Object a prudent Foresight requires that Systematical measures be adopted for procuring at all times, the requisite Timber and other Supplies. In what manner this shall be done, I leave to your consideration.  
I will now Advert, Gentlemen, to Some matters of less moment, but proper to be communicated to the national Legislature.  
After the Spanish Garrisons had evacuated the Posts they occupied at the Natchez and Walnut Hills, the Commissioner of the United States commenced his Observations to ascertain the Point near the Missisippi which terminated the northernmost part of the thirty first degree of north Latitude. From thence he proceeded to run the boundary Line between the United States and Spain. He was afterwards joined by the Spanish Commissioner, when the Work of the former was confirmed; and they proceeded together to the demarkation of the Line. Recent information renders it probable that the Southern Indians, either instigated to oppose the Demarkation, or jealous of the Consequences of Suffering white People to run a Line over Lands to which the Indian Title had not been extinguished have e’er this time stopped the progress of the Commissioners. And considering the mischiefs which may result from continuing the Demarkation, in Opposition to the Will of the Indian Tribes, the great expence Attending it, and that the Boundaries which the Commissioners have actually established, probably extend at least as far as the Indian Title has been extinguished, it will perhaps become expedient and necessary to Suspend further proceedings, by recalling our Commissioner.  
The Commissioners appointed in pursuance of the fifth Article of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and his Britannic Majesty, to determine what River was truly intended under the Name of the River St Croix mentioned in the Treaty of Peace and forming a part of the Boundary therein described, have finally decided that question. On the twenty fifth of October, they made, their declaration, that a River called Scoodiac, which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay, at its Northwestern quarter, was the true St. Croix intended in the Treaty of Peace, as far as its great Fork, where one of its Streams comes from the Westward and the other from the northward; and that the latter Stream is the continuation of the Saint Croix to its Source. This Decision, it is understood, will preclude all Contention among Individual Claimants; as it Seems that the Scoodiac and its northern Branch, bound the Grants of Lands which have been made by the respective adjoining Governments. A Subordinate question however, it has been Suggested Still remains to be determined. Between the Mouth of the Saint Croix, as now Settled and what is usually called the Bay of Funday, lie, a number of valuable Islands. The Commissioners have not continued the boundary Line, through any Channel of these Islands, and unless the Bay of Passamoquoddy, be a part of the Bay of Fundy, this further Adjustment of Boundary will be necessary. But it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty.  
Such progress has been made in the Examination of and decision of Cases of captures and condemnations of American Vessells, which were the Subject of the Seventh Article of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and navigation between the United States and Great Britain, that it is Supposed the Commissioners, will be able to bring their Business to a conclusion, in August of the ensuing Year.  
The Commissioners, acting under the twenty first Article of the Treaty, between the United States and Spain, have adjusted most of the Claims of our Citizens for Losses Sustained in consequence of their Vessells and Cargoes having been taken by the Subjects of his Catholic Majesty, during the late War between France and Spain  
Various circumstances have concurred to delay the Execution of the Law for augmenting the military Establishment. Among these the desire of Obtaining the fullest Information, to direct the best selection of officers. As this Object will now be Speedily accomplished, it is expected that the raising and organizing of the Troops, will proceed, without obstacle, and with Effect.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives. I have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be necessary for the service of the ensuing year to be laid before You, accompanied with a View of the public Receipts and Expenditures to a recent Period. It will afford you Satisfaction to infer the great Extent and Solidity of the public Resources, from the prosperous State of the Finances, not withstanding the Unexampled Embarrassments which have Attended Commerce. When you reflect on the conspicuous Examples of Patriotism and Liberality which have been exhibited by our mercantile Fellow Citizens and how great a proportion of the public Resources, depends on their Enterprize, you will naturally consider, whether their Convenience cannot be promoted and reconciled with the security of the Revenue, by a revision of the system, by which the Collection is at present regulated.  
During your Recess, Measures have been Steadily pursued for effecting the Valuations and Returns directed by the Act of the last session, preliminary to the Assessment and Collection of a direct Tax. No other delays or Obstacles have been experienced except Such as were expected to arise from the great Extent of our Country and the Magnitude and novelty of the operation and enough has been accomplished to assure a fulfillment of the Views of the Legislature.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
I cannot close this Address, without once more adverting to our political Situation and inculcating the essential Importance of uniting in the Maintenance of our dearest Interests: and I trust that by the temper and wisdom of your Proceedings, and by a harmony of Measures, We Shall Secure to our Country that Weight and Respect, to which it is So justly entitled.

Gentlemen of the Senate and  
Gentlemen of theHeufe Of Representatives,  
While with reverence and re- 1  
fignation we contemplate the dispensa­  
tions of Divine Providence, in the alarm­  
ing and deftruftive pestilence, with  
which, fcveraf of our cities and towns  
have been visited, therc# is cause for  
gratitude and mutual congratulations,  
that the malady has dl(appeared and  
that we are 2gr.in permitted to aiTem­  
ble in fafety, at the Seat of Govern­  
ment, for the discharge of our import­  
ant duties. But when we reflect that  
this fataldiforder has within a few years  
made repeated ravages in some of our  
principal sea ports, and with increased  
malignancy, and when we consider the  
&#x27; magnitude of the evils, arising from the  
interruption of public and private bu­  
siness, whereby the National Interests are  
deeply affefted ; I think it my duty to  
invite the Legislature of the Union to  
examine the expediency of establishing  
suitable regulations, in aid of the health  
laws of the refpeftivc States ; for these  
being formed on the idea, that contagi­  
ous iicknefs may be communicatee] thro&#x27;  
the channels of commerce, there seems  
to be a neceflity, that Congress, who  
atone can regulate trade, should frame  
a system, which, while it may tend to  
preserve the General Health, may be  
compatible with the interests of commence  
and the fafety of the revenue.  
While we think on this calamity and  
sympathize with the immediate fuffer­  
ers, we have abundant reason to present  
to the Supreme Being our annual obla­  
tions of gratitude for a liberal participa­  
tion in the ordinary bleffirtgs of his pro­  
vidence. To the usual fubjefts of grati­  
tude, I cannot omit to add one of the  
firft importance to our well being and  
• fafety :t I mean that spirit which has a­  
risen in our country, against the menaces  
and aggrefiion of a Foreign Nation.—  
A manly sense of National Honor, Dig­  
nity, and Independence has appeared,  
which if encouraged and invigorated by  
every branch of the Government, will  
enable us to view undismayed, the en­  
terprizes of any Foreign Power, and be­  
come the sure foundation of national  
prosperity and glory.  
The course of the translations in re­  
lation to the United States &#x27;.id France,  
which have come to my knowledge du­  
ring your recess, will be made the fubjeft  
of a future communication.&#x27; That com­  
munication will confirm the ultimate  
failure of the measures which have been  
.taken by the Government of the United  
States towards an amicable adjustment  
of differences with that Power. You  
will at the fame time perceive, that the  
French Government appears solicitous I  
to impress the*opinion, that it is averse  
to a rupture with this country, and that  
it has in a qualified mannfcr, declared it­  
felf willing to receive a Minister from  
the United States, for the purpose of res­  
toring a good understanding. It is un­  
&quot;fortunate for profeffions of this kind,  
that they should be exprefled in terms,  
which may countenance the inadmissible  
pretension of a right to prescribe the  
qualifications which a Minister from the  
&quot;United States should possess, and that  
while France is asserting the existence of  
a disposition on her part to conciliate  
with sincerity the differences which have  
arisen, the lincerity of a like disposition  
on the part of the United States, of which  
so many demonstrative proofs have been  
given, should even be indireftly question­  
ed. It is also worthy of observation  
that the decree of the Direftosy alledged  
to be intended to restrain the depreda­  
tions of French eruifers on our com­  
merce, has not given and cannot give  
any relief-, it enjoins them to conform  
to all the law* of France relative to cruiz­  
ing and prizes, while these laws are,  
themselves the sources of thedepredations  
of which we have Jo long, so justly and  
so fruitlefsly complained.  
The law of France enafted in Ja­  
nuary la ft, which fubjefts to capture and 1  
condemnation neutral vefiels and their  
cargoes, if any portion of the latter are 1  
of Britlfh fabric or produce, although t  
*  
%&quot;  
  
•  
the entire p; ancttf belong so neutrals,  
instead of being rescinded, has lately re­  
ceived a confirmation, by the failure of  
a proposition for its repeal. While this  
law, which is an unequivocal aft of war  
on the commerce of the r:\tions it at­  
tacks, continues in force, tbofe nations  
can fee in the French Government only  
a power, regardless of their eflential  
rights, of their Independence and Sov­  
,T&#x27; ereigntv, and if they poflefs the means, •  
they can reconcile nothing with their in­  
-r, tereft and honor, but a firm refiftmce.  
Hitherto therefore nothing is dif-&#x27;  
coverable in &#x27;the conduct of France,  
,r which ought to change or relax our rnea­  
&#x27; fures of defence—on the contrary to&#x27;ex­  
e- tend and invigorate them is our true po­  
a- licy. We have no reason to regret, that  
n- these measures have been thus far adop­  
ih ted and pursued, and in proportion as  
ns we enlarge cur view of the portentous  
or and incalculable situation of Europe, we  
is, shall discover new and cogent motives  
id for the full devejopement* of our energies v  
a- and resources.   
n- But in demonstrating by our conduit  
t- that we do not fear war in the necefiary  
at proteftion of our rights; and honor, we  
rs shall give no room to infer that we a­  
ur bandon the desire of peace. An efficient  
;d preparation for war em alone insure  
ie peace. •It is peace that we have uni­  
ic formfy and perfeveringly cultivated, j  
u- and harmony between us and France  
re may be restored at her option.—.

 the hu­  
ie mane and pacific policy which has inva­  
d riably governed its proceedings in confor­  
i- mity with the wishes of the other bran­  
is ches of the government and of the peo­  
— pie of the United States. But confi­  
-- dering the late manifeftations of her po­  
i, licy towards foreign nations, I deem it a  
&gt;y duty deliberately and solemnly to de­  
ill clare my opinion, that whether we ne­  
-- gotiate with her or not, vigorous prepar­  
e- ations for war will be alike indifpcnfible.  
al These alone will give to us an tqual trea- &gt;  
ty, and ensure its observance.  
e- Amonc the measures of preparation,  
e, which appear expedient, I take the liber­  
u- ty to recall your attention to the Naval  
ft establishment. The beneficial effefts  
of the small naval armament, provided  
te under the acts of the last session, are  
:n known and acknowledged.—Perhaps no  
:d country ever experienced more sudden  
at and remarkable advantages from any  
&gt;u measure 0/ policy, than we have derived  
ie from the arming for our maritime protec­  
is tion and defence. We ought, without  
fe loss of time, to lay the foundation for an  
it encreafe of our navy to a size fufficient  
t- to guard our co&amp;ft and protest our trade,  
n Such a naval force, as it is doubtless in  
f- the power of the Uijited States to create  
1- and maintain, would also afford to them  
1, the best means of general defence, by fa­  
s, cilitating the fa fe transportation of troops  
e and stores to every part of our extensive  
e coast. To accomplish this important ob  
e jest, a prudent forefight requires that  
it systematical measures be adopted for pro­  
&gt;f curing at all times, the requiffte timber  
e and other supplies. In what manner  
e this shall be done I leave to your confi­  
n deration,  
h I will now advert, gentlemen, to  
n some matters of&#x27;lefs moment, but proper  
1- to be communicated to the National ,  
n Legislature.  
d After the Spanish garrisons had e- ,  
1- vacuated the posts they occupied at the  
i- Natchez and Walnut Hills, the Com- ,  
&#x27;e miflioner of the United States com- L  
n menced his observations, to ascertain the ,  
P°&#x27;nt near the Miffiflippi, which termi- ]  
natedthenorthernmoft part ofthe thirty- ,  
is firft degree of north latitude. From ]  
d thence he proceeded to run the bounda­  
ry line between the United States and |  
t- Spain. He was afterwards joined by ,  
d the Spanish Comirmfioner. when tjie -  
r work of the former was confirmed ; and j  
e they proceeded together to the demarka- &#x27;  
1 tion of the line. Recent information ren- &lt;  
&#x27;I  
.»  
  
~ deri it probable,thai the Southern Indians,  
either instigated to oppose the dcmarka­  
&gt;f tion, or jealous of the consequences of  
Is differing white people to run a line over  
r lands, to which the Indian title had not  
:- been extinguished, have, ere this time,  
is flopped the progress of the Commiffion­  
y ers. And considering the mifchiefs  
il which may result from continuing the  
- demarkation, in opposition to the will of  
!, * the Indian tribes, the great expense at­  
-! tending it, and that the boundaries  
| which the Commiffior.ers have actually  
• eftablifhcd, probably extend at least as  
I far as the Indian title has been extin­  
i- guifhed, it will perhaps become expe­  
dient and neceflary to suspend further  
i- proceedings by recalling our Commif­  
tt fioner.  
The Commissioners appointed in pur­  
,s fuance of the fifth article of the treaty  
s of amity, commerce and navigation, be­  
e tween the&#x27; United States and hi; 13ritan­  
s nic Majesty, to determine what river was  
s _ truly intended underjthe name of the ri­  
ver St. Croix, mentioned ia jthe Treaty  
It of Peace, and forming a part of the boun­  
y dary therein described, have finally de­  
e cided that qucftion. One the twenty­  
- fifth of October, they made their declar­  
t ation that a river called Scodiac, which  
e falls into Pafi&#x27;amaquoddy Cay, at its  
- north-western quarter, was the true St.  
L,: Croix intended in the Treaty of Peace,  
e as far as its great fork, where one of its  
- i streams comes from the westward and  
- the other from the northward, and that  
it the latter stream is the continuation of  
if, the St. Croix to its source, This deci­  
:s | fion, it is tinderflood, will preclude all  
e 1 contention among individual claimants,  
- as it seems that the Schorftliac and its  
- northern branch,, bound the grants of  
[1 lands which have been made by the re­  
ti fpeiStive adjoining governments. A fub­  
y ordinate question however, it has been  
. suggested, still remains to be determined,  
e Between the mouth of the St. Croix, as  
0 now fettled, and what is usually called  
- the Bay of Fundy, lie a number of valu­  
d able Islands. The Commissioners have  
- not continued the boundary lines through  
- any channel of these Islands, and uniefs  
- the Bay of Pafiamaquoddy be a part of  
1 the Bay of Fundy, this further adjust­  
s ment of boundary will be neceiTary, But  
it is apprehended that this will not be a  
matter of any difficulty.  
Such progress has been made in the  
examination and decision of cases, of  
capturesand condemnations of American  
vessels which were the fubjeft of the se­  
venth article of the Treaty of Amity,  
Commerce and Navigation, between the  
United States and Great-Britain—that it j  
is supposed the Commissioners will be ;  
able to bring their business to a condu- \
iion, in August of the ensuing year.  
The Commissioners afting under the !  
twenty-fifth Article of the Treaty bef* J  
ween the United States and Spain, have  
adjusted most of the claims of our citi­  
zens, for lofles sustained in confequcfice i  
of their vessels and cargoes having been ,  
taken by the fubjefts of his Catholic Ma­  
jesty, during the late war between France  
and Spain.  
Various circumstances have concur­  
red to delay the execution of the Law  
for augmenting the Military Establish­  
ment. Among thefc, the desire of ob­  
taining the fulleft information to direst  
the best fele&amp;ion of officers. As this  
t objeft will now be speedily accomplished,  
. it is expe&amp;ed that the railing ancj orga­  
i nizing of the troops will proceed with­  
; out obstacle and with effedt.  
» Gentlemen of the House of Reprefentativcs,  
I have directed an estimate of the ap-  
propriations which will be neceflarv for  
: &#x27;he service of the ensuing year, to be laid  
befbre you, accompanied with a view of  
1 the Public Receipts and Expenditures  
■ to a recent period. It will afford you  
fatisfn&amp;ion to infer the great extent and­  
folidity of the public resources from the  
prosperous state of the Finances, notwith­  
standing the unexampled embarrafs­  
-1 ments which have attended commerce.  
&#x27;ien you reflect on the conspicuous  
1 examples of patriotism and liberality,  
which have been exhibited by our mer­  
cantile fellow-citizens, and how great a  
; proportion of the public resources de­  
pends on their enterprize, yon will na­  
turally consider whether their conve­  
nience cannot be promoted and reconci­  
led with the security of the revenne by a  
revision of the system by which the col-  
is at prelent regulated.  
During your recess, measures have  
been steadily pursued for effc&amp;ing the  
valuations and returns, directed by the  
aft of the last session, preliminary to the  
afT.-ffinent and collection of a diredt tax.  
- No other delays or obflacles have been  
experienced, except such as were expert­  
  
\
s, ed to arise from trie grot extent&#x27; of. cur  
i- country, and the magnitude and novelty  
sf cf the operation, and enough has been  
:r acromplilhed to allure .a fulfillment of  
at the views of the Lcgiflatnre,  
e, | Gentlemen of the Senate, anrl  
i- Gentknun of theHoufe of Reprefer.tat:ves.  
fs I cannot close this address, without  
te once mere adverting to our politicaL-fitu­  
)f ation and inculcating the eflcntial im- ,  
t- portance of uniting in the Maintenance  
-S of our dearest interests ; and I trust, that i  
.y by the temper and wisdom of your pro­  
is ceedings, and by a harmony of measures,

ST EEC T «  
Gentlemen of the Semate, and .  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
XN}&#x27;HILE. with reverence and refigna­  
&quot; 00, we contemplate the dispensa­  
tions of Divine Provideuce, in the alarming  
and dcitrultive pestilence with which [everal  
of our ciites 2nd towns have been visited,  
theie 1s cauie for gratitude and mutual con­  
gratulations, that the malady has disappear­  
ed, and that we are again permitted to as­  
semble in {afety, at the [eat of government,  
for the discharge of our important durties.  
But when we reflett that this fatal disorder  
has, within a few years, made repeaied ra­  
vages in some of our principal sea ports,  
and with increased malignancy, and when  
we confider the magnitude ot the evils ari­  
sing from the interruption of public and  
private bufinels, whereby the national in­  
tereils are deeply affe@ted—l think it my  
duty to invite the Legislature of the Union  
to examine the expediency of establishing  
{uitable regulations in aid of the healih  
Jaws of the refpetive States ; for thele be­  
ing formed on the idea that contagious sick­  
ness may be communicated thro’ the chan­  
nel of commerce, there seems to be a ne­  
ceflity that Congress, who alone can regu­  
late trade, fhou&#x27;d frame a system, which,  
while it thay tend to preserve the General  
Health, may be compztible with the inter­  
¢lts of commeice and the fafety of the Re­  
venue, ;  
While we thintk on this calamity, and  
sympathize with the immediate {ufferess,  
we have abucdant realon to present to the  
Supréme Being our apnual oblations of  
gratitude, fora liberal participation in the  
ordinary blefliags of s Providence. To  
the usual fubjefts of gratitude, 1 cannot  
om&#x27;t to add onc of the firft importance to  
our well being and fafety 1 I ‘mean that  
fpisit, which hasarifen in our country againfl  
the menaces and aggreflion of a foreign na­  
tion. A manly {cnfe of national honour,  
dignity and independence has appeared,  
which, if encouraged and invigorated by  
every branch of the government, will ena­  
‘ble us to view undismayed, the enterprizes  
‘of any forzign power, and become the sure  
foundation of national prosperity and glory,  
The coarse of the tranfaélions in relation  
to the United States and France; which  
%ave come to my knowledge during your  
recels, will be wade the fubjeét of a future  
commuaication.— T hat communication will  
confirin the ulumate faillure of the mea­  
sures, which have been taken by the gov­  
ernment of the United States, towards an  
‘amicable adjustment of differences with that  
power, You will a the fame time per­  
ceive, that the French government appears  
solicitous to impress the optnion, that it is  
aveife 1a a rapare with this country, and  
¢hat it has in a qualified- manner, declared

tepeal, While this law, which is an ute­  
quivecal a&amp;t of waron the commerce of the  
nations it attacks, continaes in force, those  
natiofs can fee in the French government  
onlf a power regardlels of thar clential  
nghts, of their independence and sovereign-  
Ay ; and if they pofle(s the means, they can  
reconcile nothing with their imcrcf{ and  
honor, but a firm resistance. ;  
Hitherto, therefore, nothing is discover­  
able in the condu of France which ought  
to change or relax our mealures of defence !  
on the contrary, to extend and invigorate  
them, is our true policy. We have no rea­  
son to regret that these mealures have been  
thus far adopted and pursued : and in pro­  
portion as we enlarge our view of the por­  
tentious and incalculable fitvation of Eau­  
rope, we shall discover new and cogent  
motives for the full developement of our  
energies and resources. .  
But in demonstrating by our condul,  
that we do not fear war, in the neceflary  
prote&amp;lion of our rights and honor, we shall  
give no room to infer that we abandon the  
desire of Peace. An efficient preparation  
for war can alone ensure peace. Ii 15 peace  
that we have tiniformly and perseveringly  
cultivdted, and harmony between us and  
~ France may be reltored at her option. But  
to {end another minister, without more de­  
terminate aflurances that he would be re­  
ceived, would be an aft of humiliation to  
which the United States onght not to {ub­  
mit. It must therefore be left to France  
if she 1s indeed desirous of accommodation,  
to take the requisite steps.  
The United States will fleadily oblerve  
the maxims by which they have hitherto  
been governed. They will refpeél the sa­  
cred rights of embally.—~And with a sin­  
cere disposition on the part of France to  
desist from hoflility, to make reparation for  
the njuries heretcfore wilitted on our com­  
merce, and to do justice in future, there  
will be no obstacle to the restoration of a  
friendly intercourse. In making to you  
this declaration, 1 give a pledge to France  
and go the world, that the Executive autho­  
rity of this country fiill adheres 1o the hu­  
mane and pacific policy, which has inva­  
riably governed its proceedings in confor­  
mity with the wishes of the other branches  
of the Government and of the people of  
the United Srates.—But considering the  
late manifeflations of her policy towards fo­  
reign nations, I deem it a doty deliberate­  
ly and solemnly to declare my opinion, that  
whether we negociate with her or not, vie  
gorpus preparations for war, will be alike  
indifpenfible. These alone will give to us,  
an equal treaty and insure its oblervance.  
Among the mealures of preparation  
which appear expedient, I take the liberty  
to recall your attention to the Naval Eftab­  
hihment. The beneficial effeéls of the  
{mall naval armament provided under the  
alt of the last feflion, are knowm and ac­  
knowledged. Perhaps no country ever ex­  
perienced more {udden and remarkable ad.  
vantages from any measure of policy, than  
we have derived from the arming for our  
maritime proteétion and defegce.—We  
ought, without loss of time to lay the foun­  
dation for an intreafe of our navy to a size  
fufficient to guard our coast and prote&amp;t our  
trade. Such a naval force, as it 1s doubtless  
in the power of the United States to create  
and maintain, would al{o afford to them the  
beil means of general defence, by facilita­  
ting the fafe transportation of troops and  
flores to every part of our extensive coalt.  
To accomplish this important objeél, a pru­  
dent forefight requires that {y{tematical mea­  
{ures be adopted for procuring at all times,  
the requisite timber and other supplies. In  
what manner this shall be done 1 leave to  
your consideration.  
I will now advert, Gentlemen, to some  
matters of less moment, but proper to be  
communicated to the National Legislature.  
After the Spanish garrison had evacuated  
the posts they occupied at the Natchez; and  
Woalnut Hills, the Commiflioner of the  
United States commenced his oblervations  
to ascertain the point near the Miflifippi,  
which terminated the Northernmost part of  
thie thirty-firft degree of north latitude.—  
From thenee he proceeded to run the boun­  
dary line between the United States and  
Spain. He was afterwards joined by the  
Spanith Commissioner, when the work of  
the former was confirmed ; and they pro­  
ceeded together to the demarcation of the  
line. Recent information renders it pro­  
bable that the southern Indians, either 10fti­  
gated to oppose the demarcation, or jealous  
of the consequences of {uffering white peo­  
ple to run a line over lands to which the  
Indian title bad not been extinguished, have  
ere this tume flopped the ’Progrcfs of the  
‘Commiffioners. And considering the mif­  
chiefs which may refelt from continuing  
the demarcation, 1n opposition ta the will  
of the Indian tribes, the great expense at­  
tending it, and that the boundaries which  
the commissioners have attually established  
-probably extend at Jealt as far as the Indian  
g&quot;itlc has been extinguished, it will perhaps  
become expedient and neceflary to suspend  
further proceedings, by recalling our com­  
missioners. b ;  
- The commissioners appointed in- pursu­  
ance of the Fifth Article of the Treaty of  
Awmity, Commerce and Navigation, between  
the United States and his Britanic Majesty,  
to determine what river was truly intended  
under the name of the river St. Croix,  
mentioned in the treaty of Peace, and form­  
ing a partof the boundary therein described,  
bave finally decided that queltion. . On the  
twenty-fifth of Oftober, they made their  
declaration that a river called Scodiac,  
“which falls into Paflamaquoddy Bay, at its  
‘north-weftern quarter, was the true S,  
‘Croix intended 1n the treaty of peace, as  
far as its great fork, where one of jts fireams  
comes from the westward and the other  
from the northward, and that the laner  
fiream is the continuation of the St. Croix

will be necellary.—But it #-apprehended

mofl of the claims of our citizens for Jofles  
{uftained in coufequence of their veflels and  
cargoes having been taken by the fubjefls  
of his Catholiec Majefly, during the late war  
between France and Span.  
Various circamflances have concurred to  
delay the execution of the law for augment­  
ing the military eflablifiment. Among  
these, the desire of obtaining the fulleft in­  
formation to direét the best feleétion of offi­  
cers. As this objeét will now be f{peedily  
accomplified, it is expeéted that the raising  
and organizing of the troops will proceed  
witHout obstacle, and with effeél.  
Gentlemen of the House of Reprefeniatives,  
I have direfted an cltimate of the appro­  
priations which will be neceflary for the  
{ervice of the ensuing year to be laid be­  
fore you, accompanied with a view of the  
public receipts and expenditures to a recent  
period. It will afford you fatisfaltion to  
mnfer the great extent and solidity of the  
public relources, from the prolperous’ slate  
of the finances, notwithflanding the unex­  
ampled embarraflments which Have- attend­  
ed commerce. When you refleft on ithe  
conspicuous eXamples of patrionfm and li­  
berality which have been exhibited by our  
mercantile fellowscitizens, and how great a  
proportion of the pubiic resources depends  
on their enterprize, you will naturatly con­  
fider, whether their convernience cannot be  
promoted and reconciled with the f{ccurity  
of the revenue, by a revision of the {yftem,  
by which the colle&amp;ion is at present regula­  
ted.  
Daring your recefls, measures have ftzad­  
ily been pursued for effeting the valuations  
and retarns direfted by the a&amp;t of the last  
{eflion, preliminary to the afleffment and  
colleQtion of a dire&amp;t tax. No other delays’  
or obftacies have been experienced, except  
such as were expeéled toanife from the great  
extent of our ccuntry, and the magoitude  
and novelty of the operation, and’ enough  
has been accomplithed to alfuse a fulfilment  
of the views of the legislature.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the Hou/e of Representatives.  
I cannot close this addrefls, without once  
more adverting to our political fiwuation,  
and inculcating the essential importance of  
uniting in the maintenance of our dearest  
interefls ; and I truß, that by the temper  
and wisdom of your proceedings, and by a

our country that weight and refpett to which

Gentlemen of the Senate, ail

permitted to aflhmbie in fafety, at ihe feat of

tant duties. Put when we refletf that this fa­  
tal diforder has, wi hin a hw jeirs, m .de re­  
peated ravages in fame of our pi incipat fea-ports,  
and w.th itlcreafed malignancy, an 1 when we  
confidcr the magnitude ol the evils arifing from  
the interruption of public and p ivu&#x27;e bufiuefs,  
whereby the national interells a e detply affec­  
ted— 1 think it my duty to invite the Legifla­  
ture of the Union to examine the expediency of  
eil.iMifhing fuitab’e regulations in aid of the  
health laws rf the refptdf’ve States ; for thefe  
being formed on the idea th;it &#x27;&#x27;ontagerus fick

j that Con 2 re Is, who alone can regulate trade,  
j fhould frame a fvftem, which, while it may tend  
to preferve die gen .nl health, may he compat  
ible w ith the m&#x27;erciLot commerce &amp; the ffilet  
of the Revenue.  
W iule we think on this calami&#x27;y, and f m  
putliij-e with the immediate fuff.rers, we have  
abundan reafon to {ref nt to the Supreme Be  
ir g our annual oblations of gratitu Je. lor a

come the fure foundation ot national piofotriiy  
and glory.  
t 1 he courfe of the tranfaftions in relation to  
.he Uni ed States £c Trance, winch have come  
to my know.edge daring your recel&#x27;s, will be  
made tlie lubjt£l ot iat«re communication.—  
d&#x27;hit communication will confirm tlie ultimate  
holurc wi the meafures, which have b ten taken  
by the government of the Uni ed Spates to­  
wards an amicable adjultmeM of di*if \e ice*  
with that power. You will at the fame time  
perceive, tint the French government appeals  
toli.itcus toimprefs the opinion, that it is averfe  
to a rupture with this country, and that it has  
in a qua..fied manner, declared it felt wiling to  
r:ce;ve a Minifter from the United State&#x27;, for  
the purpofe ot reflorng a good underfianriing.  
It is unfortunate for prof&#x27;eflions of this kind,  
that they fliould be expreffed in terms which  
may countenance the inadmitlthle pretention cf  
a right to preferihe thg qualifications which a  
Mmiller from the United States Ihould polfefs,  
and that while Trance is averting tlie extllence  
of a di pofition on her part to conciliate with  
fincerity the differences which have arilTn, ihe  
fin eerity ot a like difpolition on the part of the  
: Uni cd States, of which fa many dcmomUratve  
I proofs h ive been given, Ihould even be indirect­  
ly q :ei&#x27;ti ned. It it alfo worthy of obfervation  
that the decree of ti e Dredoiy »l«£dged to be  
intended co retrain the depredations of French  
era ler&gt; on our commerce, has not given and  
c-innot g ve any relief ; it enjoins them to con­  
lo;m to ad tlie laws of Trance rela ive to crui­  
z ng and pnzts, while thrfu laws aie, them­  
l.dves, the iources of tlie depredations ofwhidi  
we have i &gt; long, f&#x27; j-iftly, and 1» fiuhlcfsly  
complained.

though the entire property belong to neutrals,

its repeal. \V i.e this law, which is an une­  
quivocal ad of war on the commerce of the na­

feis tiie means, th .y can recon -te licthi: q with  
the r inte elt and honour, but a him refi t*

.or relax our meafures * f defence ! on th-&#x27; con­  
tra y, lo ex e ni &amp; invigorate ih m, is our true

meafures have been thus fir adopted and pur­

&lt;f the porUntious and incalculable fuuation of  
Europe, wc (ha 1 Jilcover new and cogent mo­

and rc&#x27;ou:ces.  
But in derroi ilrating by our cnduA, th *t  
we do not fear war, in the n ceilary pro:e£Fon

to infer ih it we abandon the delire oi Peace.—.  
An efficient prepar tion for war can alone en­

and prefervingly culiivated, and hariro ,y be­

more determinate aHjr.in.es that he would be

&#x27;e *r..! maintain wn-’J  
nlfo aTord to them the bed means of eg*no *1  
defence, by ihcilinting the file trrv&#x27;fporiion of  
troops and dorrs to every part of otircxtenfive  
cotll. To accompliih this important objeft, a  
prudent fore fight requires that fyftcmatic d  
irieafunrs be adopted lor procuring at all time*,  
lhe tequifite timber and o her (applies. In  
whr.t manner this ih.ill be done l leave it tJ  
your c &#x27;’.lideraiion.  
1 will now advert, Gentlemen, to fome mat­  
thers cf Tfs moment, but proper to be commit -  
nic ted to the N.i i :nal Lcgillature.  
After the Spanilh garrifon had evacuated the  
pods they occupied at the Natchez and Walnut  
Hills, the Com mi Turner of the United States  
commenced his obit rv at ions to af ertaia die  
print near the Miififippi, whuh terminated the  
Norihernmoft part cf the thirty firft degree of .  
north latitude. Fiom thence he proceeded to j  
run the boundary line between the. United  
States and Spain. He was afterwards joined j  
by the Spanilh CommitTmner, when the vr. rk of  
the r rmer was confirmed ; and they proceeded  
tooahtr to the demarkation of the line. Re­  
cent information renders it probable that the ;  
fouthern Indians, either inftigated to oppofe |  
the •demarkation, or jealous &lt; f the confluen­  
ces offuffering white people to run a line over I  
lands to which the Indian title had not been e:;­  
tinguifhed, have ere this time flopped the prog­  
refs of the CommitTione&#x27;s. And confidering  
the mifehiefs which near refult from continuing  
the demarkation, in oppofition to the will cf  
the Indian tribes, the great expenfe attending  
it, and that the boundaries which the cotrmif­  
fioners have aftually eftabldhcd probably ex­  
tend at Icaft as Ur as the Indian tit’c hns been  
extinguilhed, it will perhaps become expedient  
and rcceffary to iufpend further proceedings,  
by rccal Ing our commiffioner.  
The commiffioners appointed in purfuar.ee  
ef tlie fifth Article cf the Treaty of Amity,  
Commerce and Navigation, between he Uniced  
States and his Britanic Majelly, to determine  
what river was trucly intended under the name  
cf the river St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty  
of Peace, and forming a part of the boundary  
therein deferibed, have finally decided that ques­  
tion. On the twenty fifth of October, they  
made their declaration that a river called Scoo­  
diac, which falls into Pafiamaquoddy Bay, as  
its north-weftern quarter, was the true St. Cr&#x27; ix  
intended in the treaty of peace,as far as its great  
fork, where one cf its fireams comes from the  
weftward and the other from the northward,  
and that the latter ftream is the continuation of  
the St. Crcix to its Source. This dccifion, it is  
uuderflood, will preclude ail cor tendon among  
individual claimants, as it feems that the Sclmo­  
diac and its northern branch, bound the grants  
of lands which have been made by the respec­  
tive adjoining governments. A fubordinate  
queftion however, it has been fuggefted, ftill re­  
mains to be deterrr. ned. Between the mouth of  
the St. Croix, ns now fettled, and w!nt is ufu­  
ally called the Bay cf Funda’% lie a number of  
valuable Iflands. The Coramiffioners have n&lt; tj  
continued the boundary lists through any eban-j  
riel of thtfe Iilands, and ttn&#x27;efs the B iy of Paf  
famaquoddy he a part cf the Bay of Funday,  
this further adjudment of boundary will be ne  
ceflaiy. But it is apprehended that this will  
not be a matter of iny difficulty.  
S rth progrefs has been made in the exami­  
nation and decificn of cafes of capture and con­  
demnation of American velfels, which were the  
f ibjeft of ti e feventh Ankle of the Treaty of  
Amity, Commerce and Navigmion between the  
United States anJ Great Britain, that it is. fjp  
pofed the Commiffioners will be able to bring  
their bulinefs to a conclufion in Auguft of the  
  
eniuir.g year.  
The C.ommiflioners ading under the twenty  
fifth Article of the Treaty between the United  
States and Spain, hare aejufled mod of the  
claims of our citizens for lolf-s fuftaiped in con­  
fequence of their veffels &amp; outgoes, having betn  
taken by the fubjeds of bis Catholic Majefty,  
during the late war between France and Spain.  
Various circumttances have concured to de­  
lay the execution of the law for augmenting the  
military eftublifliment. Among thefc, the de­  
fre of c btainr g thefullefl h formation to c’ired  
the bed feledion t f officers. As this objed wiil  
now be fp.edily accomplifheJ ,it is expeded that  
the raffing &amp; organizing of the troops will pro­  
ced without obftaclc, and with effed.  
Gentlemen nf the Houf: of Reprtfentativei,  
I hive direded an eftimate of the appropria  
tions which will be neceffary for the ftrvice of  
the enfu ng year to be la&#x27;d before you, accom  
pained with a view of the public receipts and  
expenditures to a recent period. It will afford  
you fatisfadion to infer the great extent and lb.  
lidity of the public refources, from the profpe­  
rous (late of the finances, notvrithfianding the  
unexampled embarraffmerts which have attend­  
ed commerce. When you retted on the conspi­  
cuous example* of patriotifm &amp; liberality which  
have been exhibited by cur merchantile fellowj  
citizens, and how great a proportion of the  
public refcurces depends on their enterptizc, ycu j  
will naturally confidcr,whether their convenience  
cannot be promoted and reconciled with the  
fecurity of the revenue, by a revifion of the  
fyftem, by which the collodion is at Frelent  
regulated.  
During your rccif-, meafires have been ft ea­  
sily purfued for effeding the valuations and  
teturrs direded by the ad ol the lafi leffion, pre  
1 minary to the affeffmem and collcdion ot a

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO  
OF CONGRESS.  
  
While we think on this calamity,  
and fympathize with the immediate  
fufferers, we have abundant reafon to  
prefent to the Supreme Being our  
annual oblations nf gratitude for a liberal  
particiption in the ordinary blclhngs of  
nis Providence. To the ufual fubjefts  
of gratitude, 1 cannot omit to add one  
of the 6rd importance to our well being  
and faftty ; I mean that fpirit which  
has arifen in our Country againft the  
menaces rnd aggrclbon cf a Foreiga |  
Nation. A manly fenfe of national ho¬  
nour, dignity, and independence has  
appeared, which, if encouraged and in¬  
vigorated by every branch of the go¬  
vernment, will enable us to view, un-  
difroayed,the enterprizesof any Foreign  
Power, and become the furc foundation  
of national profperity and glory.  
  
The courfe of the tranfattions in re¬  
lation to the United States and France,  
which have come to my knowledge  
during your rcccfs, will be made the  
fubjett of a future communication.  
That communication will confirm the  
ultimate failure of the meafurcs which  
have been tdken by the Government of  
the United Stafes towards an amicdbic  
adjuftment of diffirenccs with that  
Power. You will at the fame time  
perceive that the French Government  
appears folicitous to imprefs the opi¬  
nion that it is averfe to a rupture with  
this country, and that it hat, in a qua¬  
lified manner, declared itfcif willing to  
  
receive  
  
5  
  
FOR JANU  
  
receive a Mlniftcr from the United  
States for the purpofe of rcftoring a  
g«&gt;od underftandin^. It is unfortunate  
for profctfions of this kind, that they  
Ihould be cxprelTed in terms which may  
countenance the inadiniiiible preteniton  
of a right to prcfcribc the qualifications *  
which a Minilicr from the United Slates  
Ihould poffcls, and that while France  
is allcrting the cxiftcncc of a dirpoftiioii  
on her part to conciliate with linccriiy  
the differences which have arifen, the  
fjnccntv of alike difpofition on the part  
of the United States,of which lo many  
demonftrative proofs have been ^iven,  
ihould even be indire6tly queftioned.  
  
It is alfo worthy of obfervaiion, that  
the decree of the Directory allcdged to  
be intended to rclhain the depredations  
Of French craizers on our commerce,  
has not given and cannot give any re¬  
lief ; it enjoins them to conform to all  
the laws of France relative to carrying  
and prizes, while thefe laws are them-  
felves the i&#x27;ources of the depredations of  
which we have fo long, fo juifly, and lo  
fruitUTsIy complained.  
  
The Law of France enabled in Ja¬  
nuary iad, which fubjedts to capture  
9ind condemnation neuiul veifeU and  
their cargoes, if any portion of the lat¬  
ter are ot Britilh fabric or produce, al¬  
though the entire property belong to  
neutrals, inflead of being rcfcinded, has  
lately received a confirmation, by the  
failure of a propofition for its repeal.  
While this law, which is an unequi¬  
vocal adt of war on the commerce of  
the nations it attacks, continues in force,  
thofe nations can fee in the French  
Government only a power regardlefs of  
their elfential rights, of their independ¬  
ence and fovereignty ; and if they pof-  
ftfs the mean, they can reconcile no¬  
thing with their intercH and honour but  
a firm refillance.  
  
Hitherto, therefore, nothing is dif-  
coverable in the condudt of France  
which ought to change or relax our  
mcafures of defence; on the contrary to  
extend and invigorate them is our true  
policy. We have no realon to regret  
that thefe mcafures have been thus far  
adopted and purfued, and in proportion  
as we enlarge our view of the por¬  
tentous and incalculable fituatioa of  
Eurttpe, wc (hall difcoyer new and co¬  
gent motives for the full developement  
of our energies and refources.  
  
But in demonftrating by our conduft  
•that wp do not fear &gt;var, in the nc-  
  
ARY 1799.  
  
cclTary protcdflon of our rights and.  
honour, we thall give no room to infer  
that wc abandon the defire of ptacc.  
An cfnclent preparation for war can  
alone enfurc peace. It is peace that  
wc have uniformly and pcrfevcringly  
cultivated, and harmony between us  
and France m&lt;*y be reftored at her op¬  
tion. But to fend another Miniftcr  
without more determinate alTaranccs  
that he would be received, would be an  
a^ of humiliation to which the United  
States ought not to fubmlt; it mult  
therefore be left with France, if flic ii  
indeed defirous of accommodation, to  
take the rcquilitc fteps. The United  
States will ftcadily oblervc the maxims  
by which they have hitherto been g&lt;»-  
vernud. They will rtfpo£l ilie facred  
rigiits of cmhalTy, and with a finccre  
dilpofltion on the part of France to defilf  
from hortility, to make reparation fur  
the injuries heretofore committed on our  
commerce, and to do judice in future,  
there will be no obdacie to the rcdor.i-  
tion of a friendly intcrcourlc. In  
making to you this dccUratiiui, we give  
a pledge to France and the World that  
the executive authority of this country  
will attend to the humane and pnciHc  
policy which hts invariably governed  
its proceedings in conformity with the  
wiihes of the diiferent branches of the  
government and of the people of the  
United States. Hut condderiug the late  
manifedations of her policy towards fo¬  
reign nations, I deem it a duty delibe¬  
rately and fulcmnly to declare my opi.  
nion, that whether we negociatc with  
her or not, vigorous preparations for  
war will be alike indifpcnfable. Thefe  
alone will give to us an equal treaty,  
and infurc its obfcrvance.  
  
Among the meaCurcs of preparation  
which appear expedient, I takt ihc ii-  
bercy to recall your attention to the Na¬  
val Edablilhment. The bcncEcial ef¬  
fects of the fmall naval armament pro¬  
vided under the A6is of the lad Scffion  
are known and acknowledged. Per¬  
haps no country ever experienced more  
fudden and remarkable advantages from  
any mcafure of policy, than we have  
derived from the arming for our mari¬  
time protection and dcfcuce. Wc ought,  
without lofsof time, to lay the founda¬  
tion for an increafe of our Navy, to ;i  
fize fufficient to guard our coad ?.rd  
protect our trade. Such a naval force,  
as it is doubrlefs in the power of the  
United States to create and- miintaio,  
  
would  
  
THE EUROPEAN MAGAZINE  
  
would alfo afford to them the bed  
means of general defence, by facilitat¬  
ing the fafe tranfportation of troopt  
and dorcs to every part of our extentive  
coaft.  
  
ToaccompUni thili important objcCl,  
a prudent forefight requires that fyde-  
matical meafuret be ad pted for pro¬  
curing, at all times, the rtquifitc timber  
and other fuppliei. In what manner  
this (hall be dune» I leave to ycur con-  
fidcration*  
  
1 will now advert, Gentlemen* to  
fome matters of lefs moment, but pro-  
  
r ;r to be communicated to the National  
es:iAature.l  
  
After the Spanilh garrifons had eva¬  
cuated the pods they occupied at the  
Natchez and Walnut Hills, the Com-  
vnillioner of the, United States cum-  
mcnced hit obfervations to afeertain the  
poTnf^titar the MilliHippi, which ter¬  
minated the northernmod point of the  
thirty-fird degree of* north latitude.  
From thence he proceeded to run the  
boundary line between the United States  
and Spain. He was afterwards joined  
by the Spanilh CommilFioncr, where  
the work of the former was confined ;  
and they proceeded together to the dc-  
inarcatioi) of the line. Recent informa¬  
tion renders it probable that the South¬  
ern Indians, either indigated to oppofe  
the demarka(ion,or jealous of the con^  
fcquences of fulfering White People to  
run a line over lands to which the  
Indian title had not been extinguilbed,  
have, *crc this time, dopped the progrefs •  
of the Commidinners. And, conhdering  
ihc mifehiefs which may refult from  
continuing the demarcation, in oppo-  
fition to the will of the Indian Tribey*  
  
the great expence attending it, and that  
the boundaries which the Conimiliioners  
  
have actually cdablrlhed, probably ex*  
tend at lead as far as the Indian title  
h«s been extinguifhed, it will perhaps  
hcCiMite expedient and neceffary to fuf-  
pend further proceedings, by recalling  
Cunimtiiioner.  
  
The Commidioners appointed in pur-  
fuance of the Fifth Article of the  
Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Na¬  
vigation between the United Statis and  
bit Britannic Majcdy, to determine what  
river was truly intended under the name  
of the river St. Croix, mentioned in  
tS»* Treaty of Fcucr, and forming a part  
ot the boundary therein deferihed, have  
finally derided liut i^ueilion. On tl\e  
  
2ith of Oflobcr, they made their de¬  
claration, that a river called Schoodiac,  
which falls into PalTamaquoddy Bay, at  
its north-wedern quarter, was the true  
St. Croix, intended in the Treaty of  
Peace, as far as its&#x27;great f«&gt;rk, where  
one of its dreams comes from ihe weft-  
ward, and the other from the north-&#x27;  
ward ; and that tbe latter ftream is the  
continuation of the St. -Croix to its  
fource. Tills decifion, it is underftood,*  
will preclude ail conten’ion among indi¬  
vidual claimants, as it feems that the  
Schoodiac* and its. northern branch,  
bounds the grants of lands which have*  
been made by the rerpe61ive adjoining  
Governments. A fubordinate queftion*  
however, it has been fuggefted, dill  
remains to be determined&#x27;. Between  
the mouth of the St. Croix, as now  
fettled, and what is ufually called the&#x27;  
Bay of Fundy, lie a number of valuable  
iflands. The Commillioncrs have not  
continued the boundary lines through  
any channcl of iheFc iflands 5 and un-  
id&#x27;s the Bay of PaiTamaquoddy be a  
part of the Bay of Fundy, this further  
adjuflment of boundary will be necef*  
I&#x27;ary. But it is apprdiended that this  
will not be a matter of any difficulty. &#x27;  
  
Such progrJT^ has been made in the  
examination and decifion of .cafes of  
captures and condemnations of Ameri¬  
can vclTcls, which were the fubjc6l of  
the fevench Article of the Treaty of  
Amity, Contmercc, and Navigation,  
between the United States and Great  
Hritain^tha^ it is fuppofed the Com-  
milfioners will be able to bring their  
bufinefs to a conclufion in Auguft of the  
enfuing year.  
  
The Commiflioners a£ling under thf  
twenty-fifth Article of the Treaty be¬  
tween the United States and Spain, have  
adjufted moft of the claims of our Citi¬  
zens, for luft&#x27;es fuflained in confvquence  
of their velTels and cargoes having been  
taken by the l&#x27;ub}e61s of his Catholic  
Majefty, during the late War between  
prance and Spain.  
  
Various circumflances have concurred  
to delay the execution of the law for  
augmenting&#x27;the Military Eflablilhment.  
Among thei&#x27;e is the defire of obtaining  
the fulleft*information to diredt the beit  
feled^ion of Officers, As this chjedt  
will now be fpeedity accuropliflicd, it  
is expected that the raifiog and orga¬  
nizing‘&gt;f the troops will proceed with¬  
out obllaclc and with efle^.

The courfe of the tranfaQions in rela-  
tion to the United States and France, which  
haye come to my knowledge during your  
recefs, will be made the lubje&amp; of a fature  
communication. That communication will  
confirm the vitimate failure of the meafuies  
which have heen taken by the government  
of the Upited States toward an amicable  
aduftment of differences with that powet.  
You will at the fame time perceive that the  
French government appears foliciious to  
imprels the opinion, that it is averfe to a  
ruptare with this country, and that it has,  
in a qualified maoner, declared itfelf willing  
to receive a minifler from the United States  
for the purpole of reftoring a good under-  
flanding. It is unfortunate for profettions  
of this kind, that they fhould be exprefid  
in terms which may countenance the inad-  
miflible pretenfion of a right to piefcribe  
the qualifications which a minifter from  
the United States thould poflefs, and that  
while France is afferting the exiftence of a  
difpofition on her past to conciliate with  
fincerity the differences which have arifen,  
the finccrity of a like difpofition on the part  
of the United States, of which fo many  
demonilrative proofs have been given,  
fhould éven be indire&amp;ily queftioned. It  
is alfo worthy of obfervation, that the de-  
cree of the directory alleged to be intended  
to reftrain the depredations of French  
cruifers on our commerce, has not given  
and cannot give any reiief; it enjoins them  
to conform to ail the laws of France re-  
lative to carrying of prizes, while thefe  
laws are themielves the fources of the de-  
predations, of which we have fo long, fo  
juftly, and fo fruitlefsly complained.  
  
The law of France enaéted in January  
lait, which fubjefts to captuve and con-  
demnation neuiral veffels and their cargoes,  
if any portion of the latter are of Britith  
fabric cr preduce, although the entire pro-  
perty belong to neutrals, inflead of being  
refcinded, has lately received a confirma-  
tion, by the failure of a propofition for  
us repeal, While this law, which is an  
unequivocal aft of war on the commerce  
cf the nations it attacks, continues in  
force, thofe nations can fe in the French  
government only a power, regarclefs of  
their effential rights, of their ind: pendence  
and fovereignty ; and if they poilefs the  
ieans, they can reconcile nothing with  
  
1799.  
  
f*  
vo  
  
their intereft and honour, but a firm re-  
fittance.  
  
Hitherto, therefore, nothing is difo-  
verable in the conduct of France whic  
ought to change or relax o@r meaiures of  
detence, on the conirary to extend and in-  
vigorate them is our trac policy. We  
have no reafon to regret that thefe nieafures  
have been thus far adopted and purfucd,  
and in proportion as we enlarge our view  
of the portentous and inca‘culable fituation  
of Europe, we that difcover new and co-  
gent motives for the full developement of  
our energies and refources,  
  
But in demonfrating by our condue&amp;  
that we do not fear war, in the neceflary  
protection of our rights aiid honour, we  
fhall give no room to infer that we aban-  
don the defive of peace. An efficient pre-  
paration for war can alone enfure peace.—»  
It is peace that we have uniformly and  
perleveringly cultivated, and harmony be-  
tween us and France may be reftored at  
her option. But to fend another minifter,  
without more determinate aflurances thar  
he would be received, would be an aé&amp;t of  
humiliation to which the United States  
ought not to fubmit ; it mut therefore be  
left with France, if fhe is indeed defirous  
of accommodation, to take the requifite  
fleps. The United States will fteadily  
obierve the maxims by which they have  
hitherto been governed. They will refpec:  
the facred rights of embafly, and with a  
fincere difpolition on the part of France to  
dzitt from hoftility, to make reparation  
for the injuries heretofore committed cx  
our commerce, and to do juftice in future,  
there will be no obftacle to the reftoration  
of a friendly intercourfe. Ia making ta  
you this declaration we give a pledge to  
France and the woild, that the executive  
authority of this country, will attend te  
the huntane and pacific policy which ha  
invariably governed its proceedings in con.-  
formity with the wifhes of the diifirenr  
bianches of the government and of the  
people of the United States. But conti  
fidering the late manifeftations of her po-  
licy toward foreign nations, I deem it a  
duty deliberately and folemnly to declive  
my opinion, that whether we negotiate  
with her or not, vigorous preparations fox  
war will be alike indifpenfable. ‘Theie  
alone will give tous an equal treaty, and  
infure its obfervance.  
  
Among the meafures of prep:ration  
which appear expedient, I take the libeity  
to recal your attention to the naval cia.

fall naval armament provided under the  
a&amp;ts of the laft ffion are known and ac-  
knowledged. Perhaps no countvy ever  
experienced more iudden and remarkable  
advantages fiom any meafure of policy,  
than we have derived from the arming for  
our maritime proteétion and defence, We  
ought, without lofs of time, to lay the  
foundation tor an increafe of our navy, to  
a fize futficient to guard our coatt and  
protect our trade. Such a naval force, as  
xt is doubtlefs in the power of the United  
States to create and maintain, would alfo  
afford to them the beft means of general  
detence, by facilitating the tafe tranipor-  
tation of troops and ttores to every part of  
our extenfive coatt.  
  
To accomplith this important objeét, a  
prudent forefight requires that (yitematical  
meafures be adopted for procuring at all  
times, the requiiite timber and other fup-  
plies. In what manner this fhall be done,  
I leave to your confideration.  
  
i will now advert, gentlemen, to fome  
matters of lefs moment, but proper to be  
communicated to the national legiflature.  
  
Atier the Spanifh garrifons had evacu-  
ated the polts they occupied at the Natchez  
and Walnut Hills, the commiffioner of  
the United States commenced his obdferva-  
tions to afcertain the point near the Mif-  
fiffippi, which terminated the northernmoit  
  
int of the thirty-firlt degree of North  
eer te thence he proceeded to  
yun the boundary line between the United  
States and Spain. He was afterward join-  
ed by the Spanifh commiffioner, where  
the work of the former was confined; and  
they proceeded together to the demarkation  
of the line. Recent information renders  
it probable that the Southern Indians,  
either mitigated to oppoie the demarkation,  
or jealous of the confequence of fuffering  
white people to run a line over lands to  
which the Indian title had not been ex-  
tinguifhed, have, ere this time, ftopped  
the progrefs of the commiffioners. And,  
coniidering the milchiefs which may re-  
fult from continuing the demarkaticn, in  
Oppofition to the will of the Indian tribes,  
the great expence attending it, and that  
the boundaries which the commiffioners  
have aGlually eftablifhed, probably extend  
at leaft as fay as the Indian title has been  
extinguifhed, it will perhaps become ex-  
pedient and necefiary to (ufpend further  
proceedings, by secalling cur commil-  
fioner.  
  
The commiflioners appoinged in pur-  
fuance of the fifth ariicie of the Treaty of  
Amity, Commerce, and Nayigxtionbetweea  
  
the United States and his Britannie ma-«  
jelly, to determine what river was truly  
intended under the name of the river St.  
Croix, m-ntioned in the treaty of peace,  
and torming a part of the boundary there-  
in deferibed, have finally decided that  
quettion. On the 25th of O&amp;tober, they  
made their declarat‘on that a river called  
Schoodiac, which fal!s into Paffamaquod-  
dy-Bay, at its North Weftern quarter,  
was the true St. Cro:x, intended in the  
treaty of peace, as far as its great fork,  
where one of its ftreams comes from the  
Wetiward, and the other from the North-  
ward ; and that the latter ftream is the  
continuation of the St. Croix to its fource.  
This decifion, it is underfteod, will pre-  
clude all contention among _ individual  
claimants, as it feems that the Schoodiac  
and its Northern branch bound the grants  
of lands which have been made by the  
refpeétive adjoming governments.—-A fub-  
crdinate queftion, however, it has been  
fuggeited, ftill remains to be determined.  
Between the mouth of the St. Croix, as  
now fettled, and what is ufually called the  
Bay of Fundy, lie a number of valuable  
iflands. The commiflioners have not con-  
tinued the boundary lines through any  
channel of thefe iflands; and unlefs the  
Bay of Paflamaquoddy be a part of the  
Bay of Fundy, this further adjuftment of  
boundary will be neceffary. But it is ap-  
prehended that this will not be a matter of  
any difficulty.  
  
Such progrefS has been made in the ex-  
amination and decifion of cafes of cap-  
tures and condemnations of American  
veffels which were the fubje&amp; of the fe-  
venth art.cle of the Treaty of Amity,  
Commerce, and Navigation, between the  
United Srates and Great Britain—that it  
is juppofed the commiffioners will be able  
to bring their bufinefs to a conclufion in  
Augult of the enfuing year.  
  
The commiffioners acting under the  
twenty-fifth article of the treaty between  
the United States and Spain, have adjulted  
molt of the claims of our citizens, for  
lofles fuftained in confequence of their  
viflels and cargoes having been taken by  
the fubjects of his catholic majefty, during  
the late war between France and Spain.  
  
Various circumftances have concurred  
to delay the execution of the law for aug-  
menting the mulitary feftablifhment. A-  
mong theie is the defire of obtaining the  
fulleit information to direét the betft felec-  
tion of officers. As this objeét will now  
be fpeedily accomplifhed, it is expeéted

Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefen-

I have diveSted an eftimate of the appro-  
priations which will be neceffary for the  
fervice of the enfuing year, to be laid be  
fore you, accompanied with a view of the  
public receipts and expenditures to a recent  
period. Ic will afford you fatisfaction to  
infer the greet extent and folidity of the  
public refources, trom the profperous [tate  
of the finances, notwithftanding the un-  
exampled embarraflments which have at-  
tended commerce. When you refleé&amp; on  
the confpicfious exampies of -patriotfm and  
liberality which have been exhibited by our  
mercantile fellow-cit zens, and how great  
@ proportion of the public refources de-  
pends on their enterpriféy you will na-  
turaily confider whether ther convenience  
cannot be promoted and reconciled with  
the fecurity of the revenue, by a revifion  
ot the fyftem by which the collection is at  
preient regulated.  
  
During your recefS, meafures have been  
fteadily purfued for effeSting the. valua-  
tions and returns direéted by the a&amp; of  
the laft ffion, preliminary to the affe{fment  
and collection of a direét tax. No other  
delays or obftacles have been experienced,  
except fuch as were expesied to arife from  
the great extent of our country, and the  
magnitude and novelty of the operation,  
and enough has been accomplifhed to af-  
fure the fulfilment of the views of the le-  
giflature.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefen«

I cannot clofe this addrefs, without  
once more adverting to our political fitu-  
ation, and incuicating the effential import-  
ance of uniting in the maintenance of our  
deareft interefts ; and I truft, that by the  
temper and wifdom of your proceedings,  
and by a harmony of meafures, we fhall  
fecure to our country that weight and re-

I will now advert, gentlemeo, to fome  
matter* of Ms moment, but proper to he

Afiei ihe Spat ifh tan i Ions had evac uatcd  
the pofts ih« y oceupied at the Natchez and

Unifco Slates commenced his ofefi tvations,

which terminated the r.oriheinmofl pari of  
thirty firft degree of 1. oilh latitude. From  
ihence he uioceer&#x27;fd to run the houndary  
line between ihe United States and Spain  
He was afterwards joined by the Spanifb  
eommifiioner when the work of (he lormer  
wasconfiimed: and they procec ded toge-  
ther to the di markation of the line. — Re-  
cent intoi mation rendc is it provable that the  
Southern Indians either mitigated fo op  
pofe the demaikaiion, or jeafuus oi tht con  
fequenccs of luiT^ring white people to run  
a line over the lands, to which the Indian  
title had not been exfinguifhtd, have, ere  
this time, (lopped the progreis ot the com  
mifiioners. And confidering the m. (chiefs  
whi(.h may rclult from continuing the de-  
rnarkaiion, in oppofition to the will of the  
Indian tribes, the great expenfe attending it,  
and that the boundaries which the commif-  
fioners have, aflually eflabliO^ed, proSably  
extend at icaft as far as the Inc&#x27;iar. title has  
been cxunguifhcd, i{ will pcrlwps become

‘:-&gt; United States, for the purpofe of reftoring a good underftanding. It is  
- unfortunate for profeffions of this kind, that they fhould be expreffed in  
  
terms, which may countenance the inadmiflible pretention of aright to  
prefcribe the qualifications which a Minifter from the United States  
fhould poffefs, and that while France is afferting the exiftence of a dif.  
pofition on her part to conciliate with fincerity the differences which  
have arifen, the fincerity ofa like difpofitian on the part of the United  
States, of which fo many demontftrative proofs have been given, fhould  
even be indirectly queftioned. It is alfo worthy of obfervation that the  
decree of the Directory alledged to be intended to reftrain the depredati-  
ons of French cruifers on our commerce, has not given and cannot give  
any relief ; it enjoins them to conform to all the laws of France relative  
‘to cruizing and prizes, while thefe laws are, themfelves the fource of the  
depredations of which we have folong, fo juftly, and fo fruitlefsly com-  
plained. :  
The law of France enacted in January laft, which fubje&amp;ts to capture  
and condemnation neutral veffels and their cargoes, if any portion of the  
latter are of Britifh fabric or produce, although the entire property be-  
longing to neutrals, inftead of being refcinded, has lately received a  
coyfirmation, by the faiiure of a propofition for its repeal. While this  
law, which is an unequivocal a&amp; of war on the commerce of the nations  
it attacks, continues in force, thefe nations can fee in the French Go-  
vernment only a power, regardlefs of their effential rights, oftheir In.  
dependence and Sovereignty, and if they poffefs the means, they can re-  
concile nothing with their intereft and honour, but a firm refiftance.  
Hitherto therefore nothing is difcoverable in the ‘aadall of France,  
which ought to change or relax our meafures of defence—on the con-  
trary toextend and invigorate them is our true policy. We have no rea-  
fon to regret, that thefe meafures have been thus far adopted and pur-  
fued, and in proportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and in-  
‘calculable fituation of Europe, we fhall difcover new and cogent motives  
fer the full developement of ovr energies and refources.  
But in demonttrating by our contiu that wedo not fear war in the  
neceffary protection of our rights and honour, we fhall give no rogm to  
‘infer that we abandon the defire of peace. An efficient preparation for  
war can alone infure peace. It is peace that we have uniformly and  
perfeveringly cultivated, and harmony between us and France may be  
reftored at her option.—But to fend another minifter, without more  
determinate affarances that he would be received, would be an ac of  
humiliation, to which the United States ought not tofubmit. It. muf  
therefore be left to France, iffhe is indeed defirous of accommodation,  
to take the requifite fteps. The United States will fteadily obferve the  
maxims by which they have hitherto been governed. They will refped  
the facred richts of Embaffy. And witha fincere difpofition on the part  
of France to defift from hoftility, to make reparation for the injurits  
heretofore inflicted on our commerce, and to do juftice in future, ther  
will be no obftacle to the reftoration ofa friendly intercourfe. In mak  
ing to you this declaration, I give a pledge to France and the world tha  
the Executive authority of this country ftill adheres to the humane and  
pacific policy which has invariably governed its proceedings, in conform  
ty with the wifhes of the other branches of the government and of th  
people of the United States. But confidering the late manifeftations of  
her policy towards foreign nations, I deem it a duty deliberately and fe  
  
lemnly to declare my opinion, that whether we negotiate with her

vith her #  
  
not, vigorous preparations for war will be alike indifpenfible. Thefe  
alone will give to us an equal treaty, and enfure its obfervance.  
  
Among the meafures of preparation, which appear expedient, I take the  
liberty to recall your attention to the Naval eftablifhment. The benef-  
cial effects of the {mall naval armament, provided under the aéts of the  
laft feflion, are known and acknowledged.——Perhaps no country ever ex-  
perienced more fudden and remarkable advantages from any meafure of  
policy, than we have derived from the arming for our maritime prote¢ti-  
onanddefence. We ought, without lofs of time, to lay the foundation  
for an increafe of our navy to a fize fuflicient to guard our coaft and pro-  
tect our trade. Sucha naval force, as it is doubtlefs in the power of the  
United States to create aud maintain, would alfo afford to them the bett  
means of general defence, by facilitating the fafe tranfportation of  
troops and {teres to every part of our extenfive coaft. To accomplifh  
this important object, a prudent forefight requires that fyftematical mea-  
fures be adopted tor precuring at all times, the requitte timber and  
other fupplies. In what mauner this fhall be done I leave to your con-  
fideration.  
  
I will now advert, gentlemen, to fome matters of lefs moment, but  
proper to be communicated to the National Legiflature.  
  
After the Spanifh garrifons had evacuated the pofts they occupied at  
the Natchez and Walnut Hills, the Commiifioner of the United States  
commenced his obfervations, to afcertain the point near the Mifliffippi,  
which terminated the northernmoft part of the thirty-firft degree of north  
latitude. From thence he proceeded to run the boundary line between  
the United States and Spain. He was afterwards joined by the Spanith  
Commitlioners, when the work of the former was confirmed ; and they  
proceeded together to the demarkation of the ine. Recent information  
renders it probable, that the Southern Indians, either inftigated to op-  
pofe the demarkation, or jealous of the confequences of faffering white  
people to run a line over lands, to which the Indian title had not been  
extinguifhed, have, ere this time, ftopped&#x27;the progrefs of the Commiffi-  
oners. And confidering the mifchiefs which may refult from continuing  
the demarkation, in oppofition to the will of the Indian tribes, the great  
expence attending it,&#x27;and that the boundaries which the commiflioners  
have actually eftablifhed, probably extend at leaft as far as the Indian  
title has been entinguifhed, it will perhaps become expedient and neceffa-  
sy to fufpend further proceedings by recalling our Commiflioner.  
  
The commiffioners appointed in purfuance of the fifth article of the  
treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, between the United States  
and his Britannic Majefty, to determine what river was truly intended  
  
‘under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty of Peace,  
  
and forming a part of the boundary therein deferibed, have finally decid-  
edthat queftion. On the twenty-fifth of O@ober, they made their declara-  
tion that a river called Scodiac, which falls into Paffamaquoddy Bay, at  
its north-weftern quarter, was the true St. Croix intended in the Treaty  
of Peace, as far as its great fork, where one of its ftreams come from the  
weltward and the other from the northward, and that the latter flream is  
the continuation of the St. Croix to its fource. This decifion, it is un-  
derftood, will preclude all contention among individual claimants,as it  
feems that the Scodiac and its northern branch, bound the grants’ oflands  
Which have been made by the refpeCtive adjoining governments. A fub-  
dinate queftion however, it has been fuggeited, {till remains to be de-  
fermined, Between the mouth of the St. Croix, as now fettled, and

The commiffioners have not continued the boundary lines through any  
channel of thefe iflands, and unlefs the Bay of Paffamaguoddy be a part  
of the Bay of Fundy, this further adjuftment of boundary will be necef-  
fary. But it is apprehended that this will not be a matter of any difh-

Such progrefs has been made in the examination and decifion of cafes,

At the opening of the third session of the Fifth  
Congress, December 8, 1798, President Adams thus  
addressed the two Houses:  
  
ken  
  
“While with reverence and resignation we contemplate  
the dispensation of Divine Providence in the alarming and  
destructive pestilence with which several of our cities and  
towns have been visited, there is cause for gratitude and  
mutual congratulations that the malady has disappeared,  
and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety at the  
seat of government for the discharge of our important duties.  
But when we reflect that this fata] disorder has within a  
few years made repeated ravages in some of our principal  
seaports, and with increased malignancy, and when we con-  
sider the magnitude of the evils arising from the interrup.-  
tion of public and private business, whereby the national  
interests are deeply affected, I think it my duty to invite  
the legislature of the Union to examine the expediency of  
establishing suitable regulations in aid of the health laws  
of the respective States; for, these being formed on the  
idea that contagious sickness may be communicated through  
the channels of commerce, there seems to be a necessity  
that Congress, who alone can regulate trade, should frame  
a system which, while it may tend to preserve the general  
health, may be compatible with the interests of commerce  
and the safety of the revenue.”
