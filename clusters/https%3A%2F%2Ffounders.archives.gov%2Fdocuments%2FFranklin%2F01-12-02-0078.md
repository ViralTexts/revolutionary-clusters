Writing on our political Affairs during my short Residence in America; but I do not insist on your reading them, for I know you employ all your time to some useful Purpose.  
In my Passage to America, I read your excellent Work, the Elements of Criticism, in which I found great Entertainment, much to admire, and nothing to reprove. I only wish’d you had examin’d more fully the Subject of Music, and demonstrated that the Pleasure Artists feel in hearing much of that compos’d in the modern Taste, is not the natural Pleasure arising from Melody or Harmony of Sounds, but of the same kind with the Pleasure we feel on seeing the surprizing Feats of Tumblers and Rope Dancers, who execute difficult Things. For my part, I take this to be really the Case and suppose it the Reason why those who being unpractis’d in Music, and therefore unacquainted with those Difficulties, have little or no Pleasure in hearing this Music. Many Pieces of it are mere Compositions of Tricks. I have sometimes at a Concert attended by a common Audience plac’d myself so as to see all their Faces, and observ’d no Signs of Pleasure in them during the Performance of much that was admir’d by the Performers themselves; while a plain old Scottish Tune, which they disdain’d and could scarcely be prevail’d on to play, gave manifest and general Delight. Give me leave on this Occasion to extend a little the Sense of your Position, That “Melody and Harmony are separately agreable, and in Union delightful;” and to give it as my Opinion, that the Reason why the Scotch Tunes have liv’d so long, and will probably live forever (if they escape being stifled in modern affected Ornament) is merely this, that they are really Compositions of Melody and Harmony united, or rather that their Melody is Harmony. I mean the simple Tunes sung by a single Voice. As this will appear paradoxical I must explain my Meaning. In common Acceptation indeed, only an agreable Succession of Sounds is called Melody, and only the Co-existence of agreeing Sounds, Harmony. But since the Memory is capable of retaining for some Moments a perfect Idea of the Pitch of a past Sound, so as to compare with it the Pitch of a succeeding Sound, and judge truly of their Agreement or Disagreement, there may and does arise from thence a Sense of Harmony between present and past Sounds, equally pleasing with that between two present Sounds. Now the Construction of the old Scotch Tunes is this, that almost every succeeding emphatical Note, is a Third, a Fifth, an Octave, or in short some Note that is in Concord with the preceding Note. Thirds are chiefly used, which are very pleasing Concords. I use the Word emphatical, to distinguish those Notes which have a Stress laid on them in Singing the Tune, from the lighter connecting Notes, that serve merely, like Grammar Articles, to tack the others together. That we have a most perfect Idea of a Sound just past, I might appeal to all acquainted with Music, who know how easy it is to repeat a Sound in the same Pitch with one just heard. In Tuning an Instrument, a good Ear can as easily determine that two Strings are in Unison, by sounding them separately, as by sounding them together; their Disagreement is also as easily, I believe I may say more easily and better distinguish’d, when sounded separately; for when sounded together, tho’ you know by the Beating that one is higher than the other, you cannot tell which it is. Farther, when we consider by whom these ancient Tunes were composed, and how they were first performed, we shall see that such harmonical Succession of Sounds was natural and even necessary in their Construction. They were compos’d by the Minstrels of those days, to be plaid on the Harp accompany’d by the Voice. The Harp was strung with Wire, and had no Contrivance like that in the modern Harpsichord, by which the Sound of a preceding Note could be stopt the Moment a succeeding Note began. To avoid actual Discord it was therefore necessary that the succeeding emphatic Note should be a Chord with the preceding, as their Sounds must exist at the same time. Hence arose that Beauty in those Tunes that has so long pleas’d, and will please for ever, tho’ Men scarce know why. That they were originally compos’d for the Harp, and of the most simple kind, I mean a Harp without any Half Notes but those in the natural Scale, and with no more than two Octaves of Strings from C. to C. I conjecture from another Circumstance, which is, that not one of those Tunes really ancient has a single artificial Half Note in it; and that in Tunes where it was most convenient for the Voice, to use the middle Notes of the Harp, and place the Key in F. there the B. which if used should be a B flat, is always omitted by passing over it with a Third. The Connoisseurs in modern Music will say I have no Taste, but I cannot help adding, that I believe our Ancestors in hearing a good Song, distinctly articulated, sung to one of those Tunes and accompanied by the Harp, felt more real Pleasure than is communicated by the generality of modern Operas, exclusive of that arising from the Scenery and Dancing. Most Tunes of late Composition, not having the natural Harmony united with their Melody, have recourse to the artificial Harmony of a Bass and other accompanying Parts. This Support, in my Opinion, the old Tunes do not need, and are rather confus’d than aided by it. Whoever has heard James Oswald play them on his Violoncello, will be less inclin’d to dispute this with me. I have more than once seen Tears of Pleasure in the Eyes of his Auditors; and yet I think even his Playing those Tunes would please more, if he gave them less modern Ornament.

‘“In my paflage to America (fays the Doétor) I read your excel-  
lent work, the * Elements of Criticifm,’ in which I found great en-  
tertainment, much to admire, and nothing to reprove. I nly with  
you had examined more fully the fubje&amp; of mufic, and demonttrated,  
that the pleafure which artifts feel in hearing much of that com-  
pofed in the modern tafe is not the natural. pleafure arifing from  
melody or harmony of founds, but of the fame kind with the plea-  
fure we feel on feeing the furprifing feats of tumblers and rope-  
dancers, who execute d?ficult things, For my part, I take this to be  
really the cafe, and fuppofe it the reafon why thofe, who, being un-  
practifed in mufic, and therefore unacquainted with thofe difficulties,  
have little or no pleafure in hearing this mufic. Many pieces of it  
are mere compofitions of tricks, I have fometimes, at a concert,  
attended by a common audience, placed myfelf fo as to fee all their  
faces, and I obferved no figns of pleafure during the performance of  
much that was admired by “the performers themfelves ; while a plain  
old Scotti/fh tune, which they difdained, and could” fcarcely be pre-  
vailed on to play, gave general and manifett delight.  
  
‘* Give me leave, on this occafion, to extend a little the fenfe of  
your pofition, that ‘ melody and harmony are feparately agreeable,  
and in union delightful,’ and to give it as my opinion, that the rea-  
fon why the Scotch tunes have lived fo long, and will probably live  
for ever (if they efcape being flifled in modern affe@ted ornament), is  
merely this, that they are really compofitions of melody and harmony  
united; or rather, that their melody is harmony ; I mean the fimple  
tunes, fing bya fingle voice. As this may appear paradoxical, I mutt  
explain my meaning. In common acceptatitn, indeed, only an agree-  
able /uccefion of founds is called melody, and only the co-eri/tence ot  
agreeing founds, harmony. But, fince the memory is capable of re-  
taining, for fome moments, a perfect idea of the pitch of a patt  
found, fo as te compare it with the pitch of a fucceeding found, and  
  
judge truly of their agreement or difagreement, there may and

does arife, from thence, a fenfe of harmony between prefent and paft  
  
founds, equally plealing with that between two prefent founds. Now,  
  
the conftru@tion of the old Scotch tunes is this, that almoft every  
  
fucceeding emphatical note is a third, a filth, an o@ave, or in fhort  
  
fome note that is in concert with the preceding note, Thirds are

phatical, to diftinguith thofe notes which have a ftrefs laid on them,  
in Gnging the tune, from the lighter conneéting notes, that ferve  
merely, like grammatical articles [particles], to tack the others toge-  
ther. That we have a moft perieét idea of a found jutt paft, I might  
appeal to all acquainted with mufic, who know how eafy it is to re-  
peat a found in the fame pitch with one juft heard. In tuning an in-  
firument a good ear can as eafily determine that two ftrings are in  
unifon, by founding them feparately, as by founding them together ;  
their difagreement is alfo as eafily, I believe I may fay more  
eafily and better diftinguifhed, when founded feparately ; for, when  
founded together, though you know by the beating that the one is  
higher than the other, you cannot tell which it is.  
  
“* Further, when we confider by whom thefe anticnt tunes were  
compofed, and how they were firft performed, we fhall fee that fuch  
harmonical fucceffion of founds was natural and even neceffary in  
their conftruction. They were compofed by the minfirels of thofe  
days to be played on the harp, accompanied by the veice. The  
harp was ftrang with wire, and had no contrivance like that in the  
modern harpfichord, by which the found of a preceding note could  
be ftopped the moment a fucceeding note began. ‘fo aveid actual  
difcord it was therefore neceflary that the fucceeding emphatic note  
fhould be a-chord with the preceding, as their founds mult exilt at  
the fame time, Hence arofe that beauty in thofe tunes that has fo  
Jong pleafed, and will pleafe for ever, though men {carce know why.  
That they were originally compofed for the harp, and that of the  
moft fimple kind, I mean a harp without any halt-notes, but thole  
in the natural fcale, and with no more than two oétaves of ftrings  
from C to C, I conjecture from another circumftance, which is, that  
  
“not one of thofe tunes, really antient, has a fingle half-note in it;  
and that in tunes where it was moft convenient for the voice to ufe  
the middle note of the harp, and place the key in F, there the B,  
which if ufed fhould be a 5 flat, is always omitted, by patling over  
it with a third,  
  
“« The connoiffeurs in modern mufic will fay I have no tafte ; but I  
cannot help adding, that I believe our anceftors, in hearing a good  
fong diftinétly articulated, fung to one of thofe tunes, and accom-  
panied by the harp, felt more real pleafure than is communicated by  
the generality of modern operas, exclutive of that arifing from the  
fcenery and the dancing. Moit tunes of late compofition, not  
having the natural harmony united with their melody, have recourfe  
to the artificial harmony of a bafs, and other accompanying parts,  
This fupport, in my opinion, the old tunes do not need, and are ra-  
ther confufed than aided by it. Whoever has heard James Ofwald  
play them on his violoncello, will be the lefs inclined to difpute this  
with me. I have more than once feen tears of pleafure in the eyes  
of his auditors; and I think even his playing thofe tunes would

residing in London for some years as ggent for several of the  
colonies, revisited this country in 1765; and on June 2, of  
that year, we find a very interesting letter from him to Lord  
Kames, from which we feel a pleasurein extracting the fol-  
lowing judicious observations.  
  
‘ In my passage to America, I read your ex¢ellent work, the Ele-

bably live for ever, is merely this—that they  
are really compositions of melody and harmo-  
ny united, or rather, that their melody is har-  
mony: 1 mean the simple tuses sung by a  
single voice. As this will appear paradoxi-  
cal, | must explain my meaning.  
  
Iu common acceptation, an agreeable suc-  
cession of sounds is called Melody, and the  
co-existence of agreeable sounds, Harmony.  
But since the memory is capable of retaining

pitch of a succeeding sound, and judge truly  
of their agreement or disagreement, there  
may, and does arise from thence a sense of  
harmony between the present and past sounds,  
equally pleasing with that between two pre-  
sent sounds.  
  
Now the construction of the old Scotch  
tunes is this: that almost every succeeding  
emphatical note is a third, a fifth, an octave,  
or, in short, some note that is in concord with  
the preceding note: thirds are chiefly used  
which are very concords. I use the word  
emphatical to distinguish those notes, which  
have a stress laid on them in singing the tune,  
from the lighter connecting notes, that serve  
merely, like grammar articles in common

That we have a most perfect idea of a

THE COUNTRY COURIER.  
  
Farther ; when we consider by whom these  
ancient tunes were composed, and how the  
  
were first performed, we shall see that of  
harmonical successiun of sounds was natura}  
  
and even necessary, in their construction i  
They were composed by the Minstrels of  
those days, to be played on the harp, segom  
  
panied by the voice. ‘The harp was stron,  
with wire, which gives a sound of long cop.  
tinuance, and had no contrivance like that of  
the modern harpsichord, by which the sound  
of the preceding could be stopt, the moment  
a succeeding note began. ‘To avoid actual  
discord, it was therefore necessary, that the  
succeeding emphatic note should be a chord  
with the preceding, as their sounds must ex-  
ist at the same time. Hence arose that beay.  
ty in those tunes which had so long pleased,  
and will please for ever, though men scarce  
  
| know why.  
  
That they were originally composed forthe  
harp, and that of the most simple kind (t  
mean a harp without any half notes, but  
those in the natural scale, and with no more  
than two octaves of strings, from. C.) |  
conjecture, from another circumstance, which  
is, that not one of those tunes really ancient,  
has a single artificial note in it ; and that in  
tunes where it was most convenient for the  
voice, to use the middle notes of the harp,  
and place the key io F, there the B, whichif  
used, should be a B flat, is always omitted, by  
passing over it witha third.  
  
The Connoiseur in modern music will say  
I have no tite; but I cannot help adding,  
that I believe our ancestors, in hearing a  
good song, distinctly articulated, sung to one  
of those tunes, and accompanied by the harp,  
felt more real pleasure than is communicated  
by the generality of modern Operas, exclusive  
of that arising from the scenery and dancing.

i In my passage to America Thad your excel*  
tent work the r* Elements &gt;f Criticismin which  
I found great enterlaj^inent; 1 only wished you  
bad etami ted m.*r«Mui)y the subjeet of music ;  
and Je.iM.utrnicd that the pleasure which artists  
feef in hearing much of that .composed in the  
sumiorn taste, is not the’natpral pleasure arising  
from melody ..r harm.ay of sounds, but of th“  
xanie kind with the pleasure we feel on seeing  
the surprising feats of tumbler* and rope dancers  
who perform diitinult things. For my part I  
taka this to be the real eas&#x27;*. and suppose it, the  
■reason why those unpraetited in music, aud there­  
fore uuscqu tinted with those riilK&#x27;tiltie*, have  
little or no pleasure in hearing this music; many  
pieces of it are mere compositions of trieks. I  
have sometimes at a Concert, attended by a com*  
&#x27;mon sndienee, unpractised in music, placed my,  
v!f «» as to see ail their faces, and observed no  
signs of pleasure in them, during a great part of  
what was admired by the performers themselves,  
white a plain old Seotcb tune, which they dis­  
dained, and eogld scarcely be prevnilod on to  
&#x27;|&gt;l*t‘, gave manifest and general delight. Give  
me leave, on this occasiou, to extend a little the  
•ei^se of your position,—1‘t That melody and har­  
mony are separately agreeable, and innmion de­  
lightful;”—and,- toy;ive It Ha my opinion, th\t  
the reason why the Scotch tunes have lived so  
long, and (if they escape being stilled in modern  
affected ornament) will probably live forever, is  
merely this—that they nre really compositions  
* «f melody ami harmony united; or rather, tbot  
their melody is harmony: l mean the simple  
tune* sung by a single voice. As this wilt ap­  
pear paradoxical, 1 must explain my meaning.  
V*-r la common acceptation, an agreeable stiee*&gt;*-&lt;ion  
•f sounds is called melody, and the co*?xistCRCe  
&quot;*f agreeabh sounds, ^tarmony. But since the

from thence a sense of hurmony between the pre­  
sent and past sounds,‘equally pleasing with that  
^etoveen two present sounds.  
Nowtilic construction of the old Scotch tunes  
5* this: that almost every sucrecdteg emphati:al  
o#otov»a third, a fifth, an ertave, or, in churl,

found great entertainment. Lonly wished vou had  
examined more fully the subject of music ; and  
demonstrated that the pleasure which artists feel  
in hearing much of that composed in the modern  
tuste, is not the natural pleasure arising from me-  
lody or harmony of sounds, but of the same kind  
with the pleasure we feel on seeing the surprising  
feats of tumblers and rope-dancers who perform  
dificult things. For my part, I take this to be the  
real case, and suppose it the reason why those un-  
practised in music, and therefore unacquainted  
with those difficulties, have little or no pleasure  
in hearing this music : many pieces of it are mere  
composition of tricks. Ihave sometimes at a con-  
cert, attended by « common audience, unpractised  
in music, placed myself so as to see all their faces,  
and observed no signs of pleasure in them during  
a great part of what was admired by the perform-  
ers themselves ; while a plain old Scotch tune,  
which they disdained, and could scarcely be pre-  
vailed on to play, gave manifest and general de-  
light. Give me leave, on this occasion, to extend  
alittle the sense of your position,— That melo-  
dy and harmony are scparately agreeable, and in  
union delightful,” and, to give it as my pinion,  
that the rexson why the Scotch tunes have lived  
so long, and (if they escape being stifled in mo-  
dern affected ornament) will probably live forever,  
is merely this—that they are really compositions  
of melody and harmony united, or rather, that  
.their melody isharmony: I mean the simple tunes  
‘sung bya single voice. Asthis will appear para-  
doxical, I must explain my meaning. ,

there may, and daes arise from thence, a sense of  
harmony between the present and past sounds,  
equally pleasing with that between two present  
sounds.  
  
Now the construction of the old Scotch tunes is  
this: that almost every succeeding ciaphatical

note that is in concord with the preceding note:  
thirds are chiefly used which are very concords.

notes Which have a stress laid on them in singing  
the tune, frem the lighter connecting notes, th..t

That we have a most perfect idea of a sound  
just pasi, Tmight appeal to all acquainted with  
music; who know how easy it is to repeat asound  
jn the same pitch with one heard. In tuning an  
instrument, a good ear can easily determine, that  
two strings are in unison, by sounding them sepa-  
rately, as by sounding them together: tucir disa-  
greement is also as easily, L believe T may siy  
more casily, and better distinguished, when sound-  
ing separately; for when sounded together,  
thougi vou know by the beating that one is high-

sider by whom these ancient tunes were com-  
posed, and how they were first performed, we shail  
see that such harmonical succession of sounds was  
natural, and even necessary, in their Construction.  
They were composed by the minstrels of those  
days, to be played on the harp, accompained by  
the voice. Theharp wasstrung with wire, which  
gives a sound of Jong continuance, and had no  
contrivance like that of the modern harpsicord, by  
Which the sound of the preceeding could be stopt,  
the moment a suececding note began ‘To avoid  
actual discord, it was therefore necessary, that  
the suceceding emphatic note should be a chord  
with the preceding, as ticir sounds must exist at  
the same time. fence arose that beatity in those  
tunes wiiich has so long pleased, and will please  
forever, though men scarce know why.  
  
That they were originally composed for the  
harp, and that of the most simple kind, ({f mean a  
harp without any half notes, but those in the na-  
tural seule, and with no more than two octaves of  
strings, from © C) I conjecture from another cir-  
cumstanee, which is, that not one of those tunes  
really ancient, has a single artificial note in it;  
and that in tunes where it was most convenient  
for the voice to use the middle notes of the harp,  
and place the key in F, there the B, which, if used,  
Should be a B flat, is always omitted, by passing  
ever it with a third.  
  
The connoisseur in modern music will say Ihave  
no taste; but J cannot help adding, that I believe  
our ancestors, in hearing a good song, distinctly  
articulated, sung to one of those tunes, and accom-  
panied by the harp, felt more real pleasure than

In my passage to America, I read your excellent work, the ‘ Elements of  
Criticism,’ in which I found great entertainment. L,only wished you had  
examined more fully the subject of music, and demonstrated that the pleasure  
artists feel in hearing much of that composed in the modern taste, is not the  
natural pleasure arising from melody, or harmony of sounds, but of the same  
kind with the pleasure we feel on seeing the surprising feats of tumblers and  
rope dancers, who execute difficult things. For my part, I take this to be really  
the case, and suppose it the reason why those who are unpractised in music, and  
therefore unacquainted with those difficulties, have little or no pleasure in hear-  
ing this music. Many pieces of it are mere compositions of tricks. I have

sometimes, at a concert, attended by a common audience, placed myself so as to  
see all their faces, and observed no signs of pleasure in them during the per-  
formance of a great part of what was admired by the performers themselves ;  
while a plain old Scotch tune, which they disdained, and could scarcely be pre-  
vailed upon to play, gave manifest and general delight.  
  
Give me leave, on this occasion, to extend a little the sense of your position  
that ‘ melody and harmony are separately agreeable, and in union delightful ;’  
and to give it as my opinion, that the reason why the Scotch tunes have lived so  
long, and will probably live for ever, (if they escape being stifled in modern  
affected ornament) is merely this, that they are really compositions of melody  
and harmony united, or rather, that their melody is harmony—I mean the simple  
tunes sung by a single voice. As this will appear paradoxical, I must explain  
my meaning. In common acceptation, indeed, only an agreeable succession of  
sounds is called melody, and only the co-ewistence of agreeable sounds, harmony.  
But since the memory is capable of retaining, for some moments, a perfect idea  
of the pitch of a past sound, so as to compare with it the pitch of a succeeding  
sound, and judge truly of their agreement or disagreement, there may and does  
arise from thence, a sense of harmony between the present and past sounds,  
equally pleasing with that between two present sounds. Now the construction  
of the old Scotch tune is this, that almost every succeeding emphatical note is a  
third, a fifth, an octave, or, in short, some note that is in accordance with the  
preceding note. Thirds are chiefly used, which are very pleasing concord. [I  
use the word emphatical to distinguish those notes which have a stress laid on  
them in singing the tune, from the lighter connecting notes, that serve merely,  
like grammar articles in common speech, to tack the whole together.  
  
That we have a most perfect idea of a sound just past, I might appeal to all  
acquainted with music, who know how easy it is to repeat a sound in the same  
pitch with one just heard. In tuneing an instrument, a good ear can as easily  
determine that two strings are in unison by sounding them separately, as by  
sounding them together; their disagreement is also as easily, I believe 1 may  
say more easily and better distinguished, when sounded separately; for when  
sounded together, though you know by the beating that one is higher than the  
other, you cannot tell which it is. I have ascribed to memory the ability of  
comparing the pitch of a present tone with that of one past. But if there shoul

ou may count the panes. A remarkable circumstance attending this experi-  
ment is, that the impression of forms is better retained than that of colours ; for  
after the eyes are shut, when you first discern the image of the window, the  
panes appear dark, and the cross bars of the sashes, with the window frames and  
walls, appear white or bright; but if you still add to the darkness in the eyes  
by covering them with your hand, the reverse instantly takes place—the panes  
appear luminous, and the cross bars dark; and by removing the hand, they are  
again reversed. This I know not how to account for.  
  
Farther, when we consider by whom these ancient tunes were composed,  
and how they were first performed, we shall see that such harmonical succession  
of sounds were natural and even necessary in their construction. They were  
composed by the minstrels of those days, to be played on the harp, accompanied  
by the voice. The harp was strung with wire, which gives a sound of long con-  
tinuance, and had no contrivance like that in the modern harpsichord, by which  
the sound of the preceding could be stopt, the moment a succeeding note began.  
To avoid actual discord, it was therefore necessary that the succeeding emphatic  
note should be a chord with the preceding, as their sound must exist at the same

time. Hence arose that beauty in those times, that has so long pleased, and  
will please for ever, though men scarce know why.  
  
That these tunes were originally composed for the harp, and of the most  
simple kind (I mean a harp without any half notes but those of the natural scale,  
and with no more than two octaves of strings, from C to C), I conjecture from  
another circumstance, which is, that not one of those tunes, really ancient, has  
a single artificial note in it, and that in tunes where it was most convenient for  
the voice to use the middle notes of the harp, and place the key in F, then the  
B, which, if used, would be a B flat, is always omitted by passing over it with  
a third. The connoisseurs in modern music will say that 1 have no taste; but  
I cannot help adding, that I believe our ancestors, in hearing a good song dis-  
tinctly articulated, sung to one of those tunes, and accompanied by the harp,  
felt more real pleasure than is communicated by the generality of modern operas,  
exclusive of that arising from the scenery and dancing. Most tunes of late com-  
position, not having this natural harmony united with their melody, have re-  
course to the artificial harmony of a bass, and other accompanying parts. This  
support, in my opinion, the old tunes do not need, and are rather confused than  
aided by it. Whoever has heard James Oswald play them on his violoncello  
will be less inclined to dispute this with me. I have more than once seen tears  
of pleasure in the eyes of his auditors ; and yet, I think, even his playing those  
tunes would please more, if he gave them less modern ornament.—I am, &amp;c

he wrote Lord Kames: “ The pleasure artists  
feel in hearing much of [the music] composed  
in modern taste, is not the natural pleasure  
arising from melody or harmony of sounds,  
but of the same kind with the pleasure we  
feel on seeing the surprising feats of tum-  
blers and rope-dancers, who execute difficult  
things. . . . I have sometimes, at a concert,  
attended by a common audience, placed my-  
self so as to see all their faces, and observed  
no signs of pleasure in them during the per-  
formance of a great part that was admired  
by the performers themselves; while a plain  
old Scotch tune, which they disdained, and  
could scarcely be prevailed on to play, gave  
manifest and general delight.”  
  
Give me leave, on this occasion [he wrote to  
Kames], to extenda little thesense of your position,  
that “melody and harmony are separately agreea-  
ble, and in union delightful,” and to give it as my  
opinion, that the reason why the Scotch tunes have  
lived so long, and will probably live forever (if they  
escape being stifled in modern affected ornament),  
is merely this, that they are really compositions of  
melody and harmony united, or rather that their  
melody is harmony. I mean the simple tunes sung  
by asingle voice. As this will appear paradoxical,  
I must explain my meaning. In common accepta-  
tion, indeed, only an agreeable succession of sounds  
is called melody, and only the coexistence of agreea-  
ble sounds, harmony. But, since the memory is ca-  
pable of retaining for some moments a perfect idea  
of the pitch of a past sound, so as to compare with  
it the pitch of a succeeding sound, and judge truly  
of their agreement or disagreement, there may and  
does arise from thence a sense of harmony between  
the present and past sounds, equally pleasing with  
that between two present sounds. Now the con-  
struction of the old Scotch tunes is: this, that al-  
most every succeeding emphatical note is a third,  
a fifth, an octave, or in short some note that is in  
concord with the preceding note. Thirds are  
  
chiefly used, which are very pleasing concords.  
  
  
  
  
  
616  
  
I use the word emphatical to distinguish those  
notes which have a stress laid on them in singing  
the tune, from the lighter connecting notes, that  
serve merely, like grammar articles in common  
speech, to tack the whole together. . . . The con-  
noisseurs in modern music will say, I have no taste;  
but I cannot help adding, that I believe our ances-  
tors, in hearing a good song, distinctly articulated,

the harp, felt more real pleasure than is communi-  
cated by the generality of modern operas, exclu-  
sive of that arising from the scenery and dancing.  
Most tunes of late composition, not having this  
natural harmony united with their melody, have  
recourse to the artificial harmony of a bass, and  
other accompanying parts. This support, in my  
opinion, the old tunes do not need, and are rather  
confused than aided by it. Whoever has heard  
James Oswald play them on his violoncello, will  
be less inclined to dispute this with me. I have
