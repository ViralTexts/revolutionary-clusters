e the best informed of the Apostles, and as he witnesses the whole doctrine of the New Testament first claimed my particular attention, and those passages which Mr. Paine terms the Jargon of a Conjuror chiefly attracted my notice. One of those passages being that which first expanded my Ideas with respect to the System of the World, I take the liberty to mention here. “There are also” Says St. Paul, “Bodies Celestial Bodies and bodies Terrestrial, but the glory of the Celestial is One, and the glory of the Terrestrial is another. there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the Stars for one Star differs from another Star in Glory.” 1st. Cor. Ch. 15. This seems to me a full description of the System of the Universe, for he says that all the Stars receive their light from One Body, and that the Planets Receive their light from the Stars Sun; and his saying that one Star differs from another Star in glory, shews that one Star receives more light from this body

ut if the distance can be conceived infinite, then matter looses every active principle which it derives from light, and becomes what the Poets describe a frightful Chaos (Milton’s Par L. B. 2) The Idea I cant pursue any farther, but shall leave to those Philosophers, who are not fond of allowing that any space should be left unoccupied, to determine, whether God in his goodness, could consign any beings over to those Regions of Eternal Misery.  
There are many passages which have occured to me, in the Bible, to this purpose; a few of which I shall take the Liberty to insert.—In the Book of Job, Chap. 38. we Read.—“Have the Gates of death been opened unto thee, or hast thou Seen the doors of the Shadow of Death. Hast thou perceivest the breath of the Earth, declare if thou canst it all, Where is the way” (that is providing he has seen it) “where light dwelleth and as for darkness, where is the way thereof: hast thou entered into the treasures of the Snow, or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail which, I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and War” And again Chap 18, speaking of the Wicked “He shall be driven from light into darkness, &amp; chased Out of the World; Surely such are the dwellings of the Wicked, and this is the place of him who Knoweth not God” and St. Matthew Chap 23 “Then said the King to the servants, bind him hand and foot and take him away, and cast him into Outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. for many are called, but few are Chosen.”  
These passages I have selected to prove, that the Bible contains more Philosophy, than man, in this life, can ever pretend to—  
These hints may likewise show, what despised Irishmen might do, if they had the Advantage of those Seminaries of Learning, which admit none but the great and opulent.—I cant but look back to my native country, once the Seat of Arts and

their occupation was gone. But the cultivators of fields of ice are as sure

“Ice,” in the language of a scientific writer, “is only a re-establishment  
of the parts of water in their natural state.” The mere absence of fire is  
supposed to account for this re-establishment. Gallileo was the first that  
observed that ice is lighter than the water of which it is composed; hence  
the floating of ice upon the water. This rarefaction of ice is owing to the

taunt that his doctrine of the sameness of body, in point  
of substance, implied sameness in visible qualities. He  
held unquestionably that the body buried and the body  
raised would be like the seed sown and like unto its  
flower blooming.  
  
He farther refutes his opponents by showing, even from  
visible nature, how wide the varieties even of flesh and  
other materialities. “All flesh is not the same flesh;  
but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of  
beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There  
are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the  
glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terres-  
trial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and  
another glory of the moon, and another glory of the  
stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.”  
Therefore, such being the varieties of fleshly and other  
material existénces, let it not be imagined that the body  
can not arise with some new character of glory and  
beauty.  
  
That this is his meaning will appear from the applica-  
tion of the previous illustrations which now follows. For  
that the following verses is the application of the previ-  
ons analogies appears from the initial “so.” And mark,

 assumed. The better way—indeed,  
the only wise way—is to accept the doctrine  
upon the autbority of the Bible, without  
any attempt to icll how the dead are  
raised up. Tne attempt can end only in  
failure.  
  
The other question which the apostle  
supposes to be asked, is this: ‘‘ And with  
what body do they [the dead] come?” The  
answer to this question is prefaced by  
stating, as follows, the general fact of  
diversity among bodies: ‘‘ All flesh is not  
the same flesh; but there is one kind of  
flesh of men, anotber flesh of beusts,  
another of fishes, and another of birds.  
There are also celes ial bodies and bodies  
terrestrial; but the glory of the celestial is  
one, and the glory of the terrestrial is  
another. There is one glory of the sun,  
and another glory of the moon, and  
another glory of the stars, for one star  
differeth from another stur in glory.”
