As I doubt not but you have heard of our defeat, and perhaps have had it represented in a worse light (if possible) than it deserves; I have taken this earliest oppertunity to give you some acct of the Engagement, as it happen’d within 7 miles of the French Fort on Wednesday the 9th Inst.  
We Marchd onto that place witht any considerable loss, havg only now and then a stragler pickd up by the French Scoutg Indns. When we came there, we were attackd by a body of French and Indns whose number (I am certain persuaded) did not exceed 300 Men; our’s consisted of abt 1,300 well armd Troops; chiefly of the English Regular Soldiers, who were struck with such a panick, that they behavd with more cowardice than it is possible to conceive; The Officers behav’d Gallantly in order to encourage their Men, for which they sufferd greatly; there being near 60 killd and wounded; a large proportion out of the number we had! The Virginia Troops shewd a good deal of Bravery, &amp; were near all killd; for I believe out of 3 Companys that were there, their is scarce 30 Men left alive; Capt. Peyrouny &amp; all his Officer’s down to a Corporal was killd; Capt. Polson shard near as hard a Fate, for only one of his was left: In short the dastardly behaviour of thos⟨e⟩ they call regular’s, exposd all other’s that were inclind to do their duty to almost certain death; and at last, in dispight of all the efforts of the Officer’s to the Contrary, they broke, and run as Sheep pursued by dogs; and it was impossible to rally them. The Genl was wounded; of wch he died 3 Days after; Sir Peter Halket was killd in the Field: where died many other brave Officer’s; I luckily escapd witht a wound, tho’ I had four Bullets through my Coat, and two Horses shot under me; Captns Orme &amp; Morris two of the Genls Aids de Camps, were wounded early in the Engagemt which renderd  
  
the duty harder upon me, as I was the only person then left to distribute the Genls Orders, which I was scarcely able to do, as I was not half recovered from a violent illness that had confin’d me to my Bed, and a Waggon, for above 10 Days; I am still in a weak and Feeble condn which induces me to halt here 2 or 3 Days in hopes of recovg a little Strength, to enable me to proceed homewards; from whence, I fear I shall not be able to stir till towards Sepr, so that I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you till then, unless it be in Fairfax; please to give my love [to] Mr Lewis and my Sister, &amp; Compts to Mr Jackson and all other Fds that enquire after me.

M Honored Madam,  
As I doubt not you have heard of m»r

serves, T have taken the earliest opportu­  
nity to give you some account of the en­

up by tne French scouting Indians. When  
■we came there we were attacked by a bo­  
dy of French and Indians, whose numbers,  
I am certain, did not exceed 500 men.  
Ours consist&#x27;d of about 1,300 well armed  
troops, chiefly of the Rnglisb soldiers, who  
were struck with such a panic that they be­  
haved with more cowardice than it is pos­  
sible to conceive. The officers behaved  
gallantly, in order to encourage the men.  
for which they suffered greatly ; there be­

Virginia troops shewod a great deal of bra­  
very, and were near ail killed * for I be­

Stall the officers, down to a corporal, were

MRS. MARY WASHINGTON.  
Fort Cumberland, July 18th, 1755.  
  
As } doubt not but you have heard of our defeat,* and per-  
haps had it represented in a worse light, if possible, than it  
deserves, { have taken this earliest opportunity to give you  
some account of the engagement, as it happened within sev-  
en miles of the French Fort, on Wednesday, the 9th inst.  
  
We marched on to that place without any considerable  
loss, having only now and then astraggler picked up by the  
French and scouting Indians. When we came there, we were  
attacked by a body of French and Indians, whose number, I  
am persuaded, did not exceed three hundred men, while ours  
consisted of about thirteen hundred well armed troops, chief-  
ly regular soldiers, who were struck with such a panic, that  
they behaved with more cowardice than it is possible to con-  
ceiye. The officers behaved gallantly, in order to encourage  
their men, for which they suffered greatly; there being near  
sixty killed and wounded; a large proportion out of the num-  
ber we had.  
  
*Braddock’s defeat, in which Washington served ag aid-de-  
camp to the commander.  
  
  
  
  
  
= — ———_- =——  
  
The Virginia troops showed a great deal of bravery, and  
were nearly all killed; for I believe; out of three companies  
that were &gt; pioneer’ thirty men are left alive. Captain  
Peyrouny and all his officers down to a corporal were killed.  
Captain Polson had nearly as hard a fate, for only one of his  
was left. In short, the dastardly behaviour of those they call  
regulars, exposed all others that were inclined to do their du-  
ty, to almost certain death; and at Jast, in despite of all the  
efforts of the officers to the contrary, they ran, as sheep pur-  
sued by dogs, and it was impossible to rally them.  
  
The General was wounded, of which he died three days af-  
ter. Sir Peter Halket was killed in the field, where died ma-  
ny other brave officers. luckily escaped without a wound,  
though I had four bullets through my coat, and two horses  
shot under me. Captains Orme and Morris, two of the aids  
de-camp, were wounded early in the engagement, which ren-  
dered the duty harder upon me, as I was the only person then  
left to distribute the General’s orders; which I was scarcely  
able to do, as Iwas not half recovered from a violent illness  
that had confined me to my bed and a waggon for above ten  
days. 1amstill in a weak and feeble condition, which indu-  
ces me to halt here two or three days, in hope of recovering  
a little strength to enable me to proceed homeward, whence,  
I fear, 1 shall not be able to stir till towards September; so  
that I shall not have the pleasure of sceing you till then, un-  
less it be in Fairfax. Please to give my love to Mr. Lewis  
and my sister, and compliments to Mr. Jackson, and all other  
friends that inquire after me.

Fifteen years later an old Indian chief came to see him. He  
said he was in that fight, and fired at him fifteen times, and  
told his young warriors to take him as their mark, but every  
shot was turned aside. Then they believed him to be pro-  
tected by the Great Spirit.

Washington was never wounded in battle.

Honored Madatm:?As I doubt nut  
you hove heard of our defeat, and per  
haps have had it represented in a  
worse light, if possibie, that it deserves.  
1 have taken the earliest opportuniv  
ro give au uccouut of the engagement as  
it Happened within saven m ljs of the  
French fort on Wednesday, the 9 o  
inst. We marched ou to that plac­  
without any considerable lo^s, losit:j  
njw and then a straggler by the French  
md ecouting Indians. When we came  
theie we were attacked by a body oi  
Freuch aud Indians whose number I  
am terluiu did not exceed 300 men.  
Ours consisted of about 1,300 well  
armed troops, cfri&lt; fly of the Eoglich  
soldiers who were si rues wuu r-uch a  
pauic that^ they behaved with mure  
cowardice th*n it is possible to con?  
ceive. The officers behaved gallantly  
in order to encourage the man, for  
which they suffered greatly, there be?  
ing nearly 60 killed and wounded, a  
large proportion out of the number we  
had. The Virginia troops showed a  
great deal of bravery and were neuly  
all killed, for I believe out of t.nre ?  
companies that there is scarce 30 men  
left alive. Capt. Poulson shared a  
hard fate for only one of bis men wan  
left. Iq short, the dastardly behaviour  
of tbosa they called regulars exposed  
all others that were inclined to tbeir  
duty to almost certain death, and at  
last iu spite of all the efforts of the of?  
ficers to the contrary they broke and  
ran as sheep pursued by dogs, and it  
was impossible to rally them. The  
general, Braddock, was wounded and  
died three days after. Sir Peter  
Haiket was killed on the field where  
died maoy other brave officers. J  
luckily escaped without a wound,  
though I had four bullets through my  
c at, and two horses shot under me.  
Captains Orme and Morris, two of the  
generals, aids de camp, were wounded  
early in the engagement, which made  
the duty hard on me, as I was the only  
person left to distribute the general&#x27;s  
order, which I was scarcely able to^  
do, as I was not half recovered from a!  
violent spell of sickness, that confined  
me to my bed and wagon for above ten  
i days. I am still in a weak and feeble  
condition, which in uces me to halt  
here two or three days, in the hopes of  
recovering a little strength to enable  
me to proceed homeward, fn m whence  
1 fear I will uot be able to stir until to?  
wards September. From ycurobedien
