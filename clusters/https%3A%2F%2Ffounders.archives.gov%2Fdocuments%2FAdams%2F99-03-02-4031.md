ancestors.  
  
Henry Adams was the progenitor of the  
Adams family in this country. “ He took  
flight from the Dragon persecution in Dev-  
onshire, England, and alighted with eight  
sons, near Mount Wollaston. One ofthe  
sons returned to England, and after taking  
time to explore the country, four removed to  
Medfield and the neighboring towns, two to  
Chelmsford, one only, Joseph, remained here,  
and was an original proprietor in the town-  
ship of Braintree.” Joseph Adams had a  
son Joseph Adams, who was the father of  
John Adams, who was the father of John Ad-  
ams the President.  
  
They were distinguished, as we learn  
from the epitaph of Henry Adams, ‘‘ tor their  
piety, humility, simplicity, prudence, pa-  
tience, temperance, frugality, industry and  
  
erseverance,.’’.
