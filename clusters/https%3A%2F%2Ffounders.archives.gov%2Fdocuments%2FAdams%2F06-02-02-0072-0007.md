: Seditions proceeding from malice are seldom or never seen in popular governments; for they are hurtful to the people, and none have ever willingly and knowingly hurt themselves. There may be, and often is, malice in those who excite them; but the people is ever deceived, and whatever is thereupon done, ought to be imputed to error, &amp;c. But in absolute monarchies, almost all the troubles that arise proceed from malice; they cannot be reformed, the extinction of them is exceeding difficult, if they have continued long enough to corrupt the people; and those who appear against them seek only to set up themselves or their friends.” The mischiefs designed are often dissembled, or denied, till they are past all possibility of being cured by any other way than force: and such as are by necessity driven to use that remedy, know they must perfect their work or perish. He that draws his sword against the prince, say the French, ought to throw away the scabbard; for tho’ the design be never so just, yet the authors are sure to be ruined if it miscarry. Peace is seldom made, and never kept, unless the subject retain such a power in his hands, as may oblige the prince to stand to what is agreed; and in time some trick is found to deprive them of that benefit.

. God intending that men should live justly with one another, does certainly intend that he or they who do no wrong, should suffer none; and the law that forbids injuries, were of no use, if no penalty might be inflicted, on those that will not obey it. If injustice there­fore be evil, and injuries be forbidden, they are also to be punished; and the law instituted for their prevention, must necessarily intend the avenging of such as cannot be prevented. The work of the magistracy is to execute this law; the sword of justice is put into their hands to restrain the fury of those within the society who will not be a law to themselves; and the sword of war to protect the people against the violence of foreigners. This is without exception, and would be in vain if it were not. But the magistrate who is to protect the people from injury, may, and is often known, not to have done it: he sometimes renders his office useless by neglecting to do justice; sometimes mischievous by overthrowing it. This strikes at the root of God’s general ordinance, that there should be laws; and the particular ordinances of all societies that appoint such as seem best to them. The magistrate therefore is comprehended under both, and subject to both, as well as private men.

rably well, ubi supra §. 210., ’How can a man any more hinder himself from believing in his own mind, which way things are going, or from casting about to save himself, than he could from believing the captain of the ship he was in, was carrying him and the rest of his company to Algiers, when he found him always steering that course, though cross winds, leaks in his ship, and want of men and provisions, did often force him to turn his course another way for sometime, which he steadily return’d to again, as soon as the winds, weather, and other circumstances would let him.’ This chiefly takes place with respect to kings, whose power is limitted by fundamental laws.  
“’If it is objected, that the people being ignorant, and always discontented, to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and the uncertain humour of the people, is to expose it to certain ruin; the same author will answer you, that on the contrary, people are not so easily got out of their old forms as some are apt to suggest. England, for instance, notwithstanding the many revolutions that have been seen in that kingdom, has always kept to its old legislative of king, lords and commons: and whatever provocations have made the crown to be taken from some of their princes heads, they never carried the people so far as to place it in another line. But ’twill be said, this hypothesis lays a ferment for frequent rebellion. No more, says Mr. Locke, than any other hypothesis. For when the people are made miserable, and find themselves exposed to the ill usage of arbitrary power; cry up their governors as you will for sons of Jupiter, let them be sacred and divine, descended or authorised from heaven; give them out for whom or what you please, the same will happen. The people generally ill treated, and contrary to right, will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them. 2. Such revolutions happen not upon every little mismanagement in public affairs. Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people, without mutiny and murmur. 3. This power in the people of providing for their safety anew by a legislative, when their legislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their property, is the best fence against rebellion, and the probablest means to hinder it; for rebellion being an opposition, not the persons, but authority, which is founded only in the constitutions and laws of the government; those whoever they be, who by force break through, and by force justify the violation of them, are truly and properly rebels. For when men by entering into society, and civil government, have excluded force, and introduced laws for the preservation of property, peace and unity, among themselves; those who set up force again, in opposition to the laws, do rebellare, that is, do bring back again the state of war, and are properly rebels, as the author shews. In the last place, he demonstrates, that there are also greater inconveniencies in allowing all to those that govern, than in granting something to the people. But it will be said, that ill affected and factious men may spread among the people, and make them believe that the prince or legislative, act contrary to their trust, when they only make use of their due prerogative. To this Mr. Locke answers, that the people however is to judge of all that; because no body can better judge whether his trustee for deputy acts well, and according to the trust reposed in him, than he who deputed him.

 it has no relation to the subject, I shall pass over.  
The case is shortly this: The East-India company, by their contract with government, in their charter and statute, are bound, in consideration of their important profitable privileges, to pay to the public treasury, a revenue, annually, of four hundred thousand pounds sterling, so long as they can hold up their Dividends at twelve per cent, and no longer.  
The mistaken policy of the ministry, in obstinately persisting in their claim of right to tax America, and refusing to repeal the duty on Tea, with those on glass, paper and paint, had induced all America, except a few merchants in Boston, most of whom were closely connected with the junto, to refuse to import Tea from Great Britain: the consequence of which was a kind of stagnation in the affairs of the company, and an immense accumulation of tea in their stores, which they could not sell. This, among other causes, contributed to affect their credit, and their Dividends were on the point of falling below twelve per cent, and consequently the government was upon the point of losing 400,000 1. sterling a year of revenue. The company solicited the ministry to take off the duty in America: but they adhering to their plan of taxing the colonies and establishing a precedent, framed an act to enable the company to send their tea directly to America. This was admired as a master-piece of policy. It was tho’t they would accomplish four great purposes at once: establish their precedent of taxing America; raise a large revenue there by the duties; save the credit of the company; and the 400,000 1. to the government. The company however, were so little pleased with this, that there were great debates among the directors, whether they should risque it, which were finally determined by a majority of one only, and that one the chairman, being unwilling as it is said to interfere in the dispute between the minister and the colonies, and uncertain what the result would be: and this small majority was not obtained, as it is said, until a sufficient intimation was given that the company should not be losers.  
When these designs were made known, it appeared, that American politicians were not to be deceived: that their fight was as quick and clear as the minister’s, and that they were as steady to their purpose, as he was to his. This was tho’t by all the colonies, to be the precise point of time, when it became absolutely necessary to make a stand. If the tea should be landed, it would be sold; if sold the duties would amount to a large sum, which would be instantly applied to increase the friends and advocates for more duties, and to divide the people; and the company would get such a footing, that no opposition afterwards could ever be effectual. And as soon as the duties on tea should be established, they would be ranked among post-office fees, and other precedents, and used as arguments, both of the right and expediency of laying on others, perhaps on all the necessaries, as well as conveniences and luxuries of life. The whole continent was united in the sentiment, that all opposition to parliamentary taxation must be given up forever, if this critical moment was neglected. Accordingly, New-York and Philadelphia determined that the ships should be sent back; and Charlestown, that the tea should be stored and locked up,—this was attended with no danger in that city, because they are fully united in sentiment and affection, and have no Junto to perplex them. Boston was under greater difficulties. The Consignees at New York and Philadelphia most readily resigned. The Consignees at Boston, the children, cousins, and most intimate connections of governor Hutchinson, refused. I am very sorry that I cannot stir a single step in develloping the causes of my country’s miseries, without stumbling upon this gentleman. But so it is. From the near relation and most intimate connection of the consignees with him, there is great cause of jealousy, if not a violent presumption, that he was at the bottom of all this business, that he had plann’d it, in his confidential letters with Bernard, and both of them joined in suggesting and recommending it to the ministry. Without this supposition, it is difficult to account for the obstinacy with which the Consignees refused to resign, and the governor to let the vessel go. However this might be, Boston is the only place upon the continent, perhaps in the world, which ever breeds a species of misanthropos, who will persist in their schemes for their private interest, with such obstinacy, in opposition to the public good; disoblige all their fellow-citizens for a little pelf, and make themselves odious and infamous, when they might be respected and esteemed. It must be said, however, in vindication of the town, that this breed is spawned chiefly by the Junto. The Consignees would not resign; the custom house refused clearances; governor Hutchinson refused passes by the castle. The question then was, with many, whether the governor, officers, and consignees should be compelled to send the ships hence? An army and navy was at hand, and bloodshed was apprehended. At last, when the continent, as well as the town and province, were waiting the issue of this deliberation with the utmost anxiety, a number of persons, in the night, put them out of suspense, by an oblation to Neptune. I have heard some gentlemen say, “this was a very unjustifiable proceeding”—“that if they had gone at noonday, and in their ordinary habits, and drowned it in the face of the world, it would have been a meritorious, a most glorious action.” But to go in the night, and much more in disguise, they tho’t very inexcuseable.  
“The revenue was not the consideration before parliament,” says Massachusettensis. Let who will, believe him. But if it was not, the danger to America was the same. I take no notice of the idea of a monopoly. If it had been only a monopoly, (tho’ in this light it would have been a very great grievance) it would not have excited, nor in the opinion of any one justified the step that was taken. It was an attack upon a fundamental principle of the Constitution, and upon that supposition was resisted, after multitudes of petitions to no purpose, and because there was no tribunal in the Constitution, from whence redress could have been obtained.

They had been playing into each other’s hands a long time. The smuggler received protection from the whig, and he in his turn received support from the smuggler.

g it, I shall leave to the judgment of the public. The other colonies, it seems, have no scruples about it, for we find that whenever tea arrives in any of them, whether from the East India company, or any other quarter, it never fails to share the fate of that in Boston. All men will agree that such steps ought not to be taken, but in cases of absolute necessity, and that such necessity must be very clear. But most people in America now think the destruction of the Boston tea, was absolutely necessary, and therefore right and just. It is very true, they say, if the whole people had been united in sentiment, and equally stable in their resolution, not to buy or drink it, there might have been a reason for preserving it; but the people here were not so virtuous or so happy. The British ministry had plundered the people by illegal taxes, and applied the money in salaries and pensions, by which devices, they had insidiously attached to their party, no inconsiderable number of persons, some of whom were of family, fortune and influence, tho’ many of them were of desperate fortunes, each of whom, however, had his circle of friends, connections and dependants, who were determined to drink tea, both as evidence of their servility to administration, and their contempt and hatred of the people. These it was impossible to restrain without violence, perhaps bloodshed, certainly without hazarding more than the tea was worth. To this tribe of the wicked, they say, must be added another, perhaps more numerous, of the weak; who never could be brought to think of the consequences of their actions, but would gratify their appetites, if they could come at the means. What numbers are there in every community, who have no providence, or prudence in their private affairs, but will go on indulging the present appetite, prejudice, or passion, to the ruin of their estates and families, as well as their own health and characters! How much larger is the number of those who have no foresight for the public, or consideration of the freedom of posterity? Such an abstinence from the tea, as would have avoided the establishment of a precedent, depended on the unanimity of the people, a felicity that was unattainable. Must the wise, the virtuous and worthy part of the community, who constituted a very great majority, surrender their liberty, and involve their posterity in misery in complaisance to a detestable, tho’ small party of knaves, and a despicable, tho’ more numerous company of fools?  
If Boston could have been treated like other places, like New-York and Philadelphia, the tea might have gone home from thence as it did from those cities. That inveterate, desperate junto, to whom we owe all our calamities, were determined to hurt us in this, as in all other cases as much as they could. It is to be hoped they will one day repent and be forgiven, but it is very hard to forgive without repentance. When the news of this event arrived in England, it excited such passions in the minister as nothing could restrain; his resentment was inkindled into revenge, rage, and madness; his veracity was piqued, as his master piece of policy, proved but a bubble: The bantling was the fruit of a favourite amour, and no wonder that his natural affection was touched when he saw it dispatched before his eyes. His grief and ingenuity, if he had any, were affected at the thought that he had misled the East India company, so much nearer to destruction, and that he had rendered the breach between the kingdom and the colonies almost irreconcileable: his shame was excited because opposition had gained a triumph over him, and the three kingdoms were laughing at him for his obstinacy and his blunders: instead of relieving the company he had hastened its ruin: instead of establishing the absolute and unlimited sovereignty of parliament over the colonies, he had excited a more decisive denial of it, and resistance to it. An election drew nigh and he dreaded the resentment even of the corrupted electors.  
In this state of mind bordering on despair, he determines to strike a bold stroke. Bernard was near and did not fail to embrace the opportunity, to push the old systems of the junto. By attacking all the colonies together, by the stamp-act, and the paint and glass act, they had been defeated. The charter constitution of the Massachusetts-Bay, had contributed greatly to both these defeats. Their representatives were too numerous, and too frequently elected, to be corrupted: their people had been used to consider public affairs in their town-meetings: their councellors were not absolutely at the nod of a minister or governor, but were once a year equally dependent on the governor and the two houses. Their grand jurors were elective by the people, their petit jurors were returned merely by lot. Bernard and the junto rightly judged that by this constitution the people had a check, on every branch of power, and therefore as long as it lasted, parliamentary taxations, &amp;c. could never be inforced.  
Bernard, publishes his select letters, and his principles of polity: his son writes in defence of the Quebec bill: hireling garretteers were employed to scribble millions of lyes against us, in pamphlets and news papers: and setters employed in the coffee houses, to challenge or knock down all the advocates for the poor Massachusetts. It was now determined, instead of attacking the colonies together, tho’ they had been all equally opposed to the plans of the ministry, and the claims of parliament, and therefore upon ministerial principles equally guilty, to handle them one by one; and to begin with Boston and the Massachusetts. The destruction of the tea was a fine event for scribblers and speechifyers to declaim upon; and there was an hereditary hatred of New-England, in the minds of many in England, on account of their non conforming principles. It was likewise thought there was a similar jealousy and animosity in the other colonies against New England; that they would therefore certainly desert her; that she would be intimidated and submit; and then the minister among his own friends, would acquire immortal honour, as the most able, skilfull and undaunted statesman of the age.  
The port bill, charter bill, murder bill, Quebec bill, making all together such a frightful system, as would have terrified any people, who did not prefer liberty to life, were all concerted at once: but all this art and violence have not succeeded. This people under great trials and dangers, have discovered great abilities and virtues, and that nothing is so terrible to them as the loss of their liberties. If these arts and violences are persisted in, and still greater concerted, and carried on against them, the world will see that their fortitude, patience and magnanimity will rise in proportion.

They knew they must suffer, vastly more, than the Tea was worth, but they thought they acted for America and posterity; and that they ought not to take such a step without the advice of the colonies. They have declared our cause their own—that they never will submit to a precedent in any part of the united colonies, by which Parliament may take away Wharves and other lawful estates, or demolish Charters; for if they do, they have a moral certainty that in the course of a few years, every right of Americans will be taken away, and governors and councils, holding at the will of a Minister, will be the only legislatives, in the colonies.

If we recollect how many states have lost their liberties, merely from want of communication with each other, and union among themselves, we shall think that these committees may be intended by providence to accomplish great events. What the eloquence and talents of negociation of Demosthenes himself could not effect, among the states of Greece, might have been effected by so simple a device. Castile, Arragon, Valencia, Majorca, &amp;c. all complained of oppression under Charles the fifth, flew out into transports of rage, and took arms against him. But they never consulted or communicated with each other. They resisted separately, and were separately subdued.

o be established. There are certain prejudices among the people, so strong, as to be irresistible. Reasoning is vain, and opposition idle. For example, there are certain popular maxims and precepts, call’d the ten commandments. Suppose a number of fine gentlemen, superior to the prejudices of education, should discover that these were made for the common people, and are too illiberal for gentlemen of refined taste to observe, and accordingly should engage in secret confidential correspondences to procure an act of parliament, to abolish the whole decalogue, or to exempt them from all obligation to observe it; if they should succeed, and their letters be detected, such is the force of prejudice, and deep habits among the lower sort of people, that it is much to be questioned, whether those refined genius’s would be allowed to enjoy themselves in the latitude of their sentiments. I once knew a man, who had studied Jacob Beckman and other mystic’s, until he conscienciously thought the millennium commenced, and all human authority at an end: that the saints only had a right to property; and to take from sinners any thing they wanted. In this persuasion, he very honestly stole a horse. Mankind pitied the poor man’s infirmity, but thought it however their duty to confine him that he might steal no more.  
The freedom of thinking was never yet extended in any country so far as the utter subversion of all religion and morality; nor as the abolition of the laws and constitution of the country.

The people are then told that “they have been insidiously taught to believe that Great Britain is rapacious, cruel and vindictive, and envies us the inheritance purchased by the sweat and blood of our ancestors.” The people do not believe this—they will not believe it: On the contrary, they believe if it was not for scandals constantly transmitted from this province by the Tories, the nation would redress our grievances. Nay as little as they reverence the Ministry, they even believe that the Lords North, Mansfield and Bute, would relieve them, and would have done it long ago, if they had known the truth. The moment this is done “long live our gracious king and happiness to Britain,” will resound from one end of the province to the other: but it requires a very little foresight to determine, that no other plan of governing the province and the colonies, will ever restore a harmony between the two countries, but desisting from the plan of taxing them and interfering with their internal concerns, and returning to that system of colony administration, which nature dictated, and experience for one hundred and fifty years found useful.

God, intending that men fhould live

tend, that he or they who do no wrong,  
fhould fuffer none ; and the law that for-  
bids injuries, would be of no ufe, if no pe-

fit be said, *“That the People, being ig­  
norant, are always discontented,” I answer,  
quite the contrary. People are not so easily  
got out of their old Forms as some are apt to  
suggest ; they are hardly tobe prevailed withto  
amend the acknowledged Faults in theFrame  
they have been accustomed to. But if the  
People have been made miserable, and find  
themielves exposed to zll the ill Usage of ar­  
bitrary Power,cry up their Governors 2s much  
as youwill for Sons of Jupiter, and give them  
out for what you please, the fame will hap­  
pen. The People ill treated, and contrary  
to right, will be ready on any Occasion to  
ease themfélves of a Burden that fits heavy  
upon them, &amp; they will wish and seek for the  
Opportunity. He must have lived but little  
in the World, who has not seen or read of  
Examples of this in all Sorts of Governments  
inthe World. .  
Such Revolutions happen not upon every  
little Mismanagement in public Affairs.——  
Great Mistakes in the ruling Party, &amp; many  
wrong Lawe, &amp; Slips of human Frailty, will  
be borne by the People ; but if a long Train  
of Abuses and Artifices, all tending the fame  
Way, make the Design visible to the People,  
and they fee whither they are going, it is not  
to be wondered that they should then rouse  
themselves, for specious Names and Forms  
are worse than the State of Nature or pure  
Anarchy.  
Rebellion being an Opposition not to Per­  
sons but Authority, which is founded only in  
the Constitution and Lasws : those, whoever  
they be, who by Force break through,and by  
Force juflify their Violation of them, are  
truly and properly Rebels. Those who setup

from Great Britain; the conſequence of which  
was à kind of ſtagpation in the affairs of the

Aofing 400,0001. ſterling a year of revenue.  
The Company ſolicited the Miniſtry to take off  
the duty in America; but they adhereing to  
their plan of Taxing the Colonies, and eſtabliſh-  
  
ing a precedent, framed an Act to enable the  
  
Company to ſend their tea directly to America.  
This was admired as a maſter- piece of policy.  
  
It was thought they would accomplifh four  
  
great purpoſes at once; eſtabliſh their pre-  
  
- cedent of taxing America; raiſe a large revenue  
  
there by the duties; ſave the credit of the  
  
- Courpany, and the 400, ooo l. to the Govern-  
ment. The Company, however, were fo little  
pleaſed with this, that there were great debates  
  
among the Directors, whether they ſhould  
riſque it, which were finally determined by a  
majority of one only, and that one the Chair-  
man; being unwilling, it is ſaid, to interfere in  
  
- the diſpute between the Miniſter and the Co-  
lonies, and uncertain what the reſult would  
  
be; and this ſmall majority was not obtained,  
  
as it is ſaid, until a ſufficient intimation was  
given that the Company ſhould not be loſers.”  
  
  
„  
  
This was thought by all the Colonies to be  
the preciſe point of time when it became ab-  
ſolutely neceſſary to make a ſtand. If the tea  
ſhould be landed, it would be ſold ; if fold, the  
duties would amount to a large ſum, which  
would be inſtantly applied to increaſe the  
friends and advocates for more duties, and to  
divide the People; and the Company would  
get ſuch a footing, that no oppoſition after-  
wards could ever be effectual. And as ſoon as  
the duties on tea ſhould be eſtabliſhed, they  
would be ranked among Poſt-office fees, and  
other precedents, and uſed as arguments both  
of the right and expediency of laying on  
others, perhaps on all the neceſſaries, as well  
as conveniences and luxuries of life. The  
whole Continent was united in the ſentiment,  
that all oppoſition to parliamentary taxation  
muſt be given up for ever, if this critical mo-  
ment was neglected. Accordingly, New-Vork  
. and Philadelphia determined that the ſhips  
ſhould be ſent back; and Charleſtown, that the  
tea ſhould be ſtored and locked up ;—this, was.

it, I ſhall deave to the judgment of the Public.  
The other Colonies, it ſeems, have no ſcruples  
about it; for we find that whenever tea arrives  
in any of them, -whether from the Eaſt India  
Company, or any other quarter, it never fails  
to ſhare the fate of that in Boſton. All men  
will agree, that ſuch ſteps ought not to be taken,  
but in caſes of abſolute neceſſity, and that ſuch  
neceſſity muſt be very clear. But moſt people  
in America now think, the deſtruction of the  
Boſton tea was abſolutely neceffary, and there-  
fore right and juſt. It is very true, they ſay,  
if the whole People had been united in ſenti-  
ment, and equally ſtable in their reſolution, not  
to buy or drink it, there might have been a  
reaſon far preſerving i it; but the People herc  
were not ſo virtuous or ſo happy. The Britiſh  
&quot;Miniſtry had plundered the People by illegal  
taxes, and applied the money in falaries and  
penſions, by which devices they had infidiouſly  
attached to their party, no inconfiderable num-  
ber of perſons, ſome of whom were of family,  
fortune, and influence, though many. of them  
wereef deſperate fortunes; each of whom, how-  
ever, had his circle of friends, connections and  
dependants, who were determined to drink tea,  
both as evidenceet their ſervility to Adminiſtra-  
15A 18:1 vo I tion,  
  
Cc 89  
tion, and their contempt and hatred of the  
People. Theſe it was impoſſible to reſtrain  
without violence, perhaps bloodſhed ; certainly  
without hazarding more than the tea was  
worth. To this tribe of the wicked, they ſay,  
muſt be added another, perhaps more. nu-  
merous, of the weak, who never could be  
brought to think of the conſequences of theit  
actions, but would. gratify their appetites, if  
they could come at the means. What num-  
bers are there in every Community, who have  
no providence or prudence in their private  
affairs, but will go on indulging the preſent  
appetite, prejudice or paſſion, to the ruin of  
their eſtates and families, as well as their own  
health and characters! How much larger is the  
number of thoſe who have no forefight for  
the Public, or conſideration of the freedom of  
poſterity ! Such an abſtinence from the tea, as  
would have avoided the eſtabliſhment of a pre-  
cedent, depended on the unanimity of the  
  
  
the wiſe, the virtuous, and worthy part of the  
Community, whe conſtituted a very great ma-  
jority, ſurrender their liberty, and involve their  
poſterity in miſery, in complaiſance to a de-  
  
  
of fools ?

Ix B6fton £obld: have been treated like other  
places; «like New-York and Philadelphia, the  
tea might have gone home from thence as it  
did from thoſe cities. That inveterate, def-  
petate Junto, to whom we owe all our calami-  
ties, were determined to hurt us in this, as in  
all other cafes, as much as they could. It is to  
be hoped they will one day repent; and be for-  
given; hut it is very hard to forgive without  
repentande When the news of this event ar-  
riveil an England, it excited ſuch paſſions in the  
Miniſter as nothing could reſtrain; his reſent-  
ment was kindied into revenge, rage and mad-  
neſs; his veracity was piqued, as his maſter»  
piece of Policv proved but a bubble: The bant-  
ling was the fruit of a favourite amour, and no  
wonder that his natural affection was touched,  
when he ſaw it diſpatched before his eyes.—  
His grief and ingenuity, if he had any, were  
affected at the thought that he had miſled the  
Eaſt Iodia Company, ſo much nearer to de-  
ſtruction, and that he had rendered the breach  
between the Kingdom and the Colonies almoſt  
irreconciteable; his ſhame was excited becauſe  
Oppoſition had gained a triumph over him, and  
the three kingdoms were laughing at him for  
his obſtinacy and his blunders : Inſtead of  
  
  
Sf I  
  
fovereignty of Parliament over the Colonies, he  
had excited a more deciſive denial of it, and reſiſt-  
  
ance to it. An election drew nigh, and he dread-  
  
ed the reſentment even of the corrupted electors.  
  
Isx this ſtate of mind, bordering on deſpair,  
he determines to ſtrike a bold ſtroke. By at-  
racking all the Colonies together, by the Stamp  
Act, and the Paint and Glaſs Act, they had  
been defeated. The Charter Conſtitution of the  
Maſſachuſets Bay had contributed greatly to  
both theſe defeats. —Their Repreſentatives were  
too numerous, and too frequently elected, to be  
corrupted; their People had been uſed to con-  
fider affairs in their Town-meetings : Their  
Counſellors were not abſolutely at the nod of a  
Miniſter or Governor; but were, once a year,  
equally dependant on the Goyernor and the two  
Houſes. Their Grand Jurors were elective by  
the People ; their Petit Jurors were returned  
merely by lot. The Junto rightly judged, that  
by this Conſtitution: the People had a check on  
every. branch of: power; and therefore, as long  
as it laſted, Parliamentary Taxations, &amp;c. could,  
never be inforced.

us, in pamphlets and news- papers; and Setters  
employed in the coffee-houſes, to challenge or  
knock down all the advocates for the poor Maſ-  
ſachuſets.—It was now determined, inſtead of  
attacking the Colonies together, though they  
had all been equally oppoſed to the plans of the  
Miniſtry, and the claims of Parliament, and  
therefore, upon miniſterial principles, equally  
guilty, to handle them one by one; and to be-  
gm with Boſton and the Maſſachuſets. The  
de ſtruction of the tea was a fine event for ſcrib-  
blers and ſpeechifyers to declaim upon; and  
there was an hereditary hatred of New Eng-  
tand, in the minds of many people in England,  
on account of her non-conforming principles.  
It was likewiſe thought there was a fimilar  
jealouſy and animoſity in the other Colonies  
againft New England; that they would there-  
fore certainly defert her; that ſhe would be in-  
timidared, and ſubmit ; and then the Miniſter,

I have merely mentioned this to shew  
that the Minister&#x27;s eloquence is more to be  
admired than his sound reasoning, his words  
more than his arguments. But 1s this prin-  
ciple, which Mr. Pitt so reprobates, really  
dangerous? Another passage from Locke  
will decide this matter. It will perhaps  
be said, that the people being ignorant and  
always discontented, to lay the foundation  
of government in the unsteady opinion and  
uncertain humour of the people, is to ex-  
pose it to certain ruin; and no government  
will be able long to subsist, if the people  
may set up a new legislative whenever they  
take offence at the old one. To this I an-  
swer, quite the contrary. People are not  
80 easily got out of their old forms, as some  
are apt to suggest. They are hardly to be  
  
prevailed  
  
( 0 )  
  
prevailed with to amend the acknowledged  
faults in the frame they have been accus-  
tomed to. And if there be any original  
defects, or adventitious ones introduced by  
time or corruption, &#x27;tis not an easy thing  
to get them changed, even when all the  
world secs there 1s an opportunity for do-  
ing it. But &quot;twill be said, this hypothesis  
lays a ferment for frequent rebellion. &#x27;To  
which I answer, no more than any other  
hypothesis. For when the people are made  
miserable, and find themselves exposed to  
the ill usage of arbitrary power, cry up  
their governors, as much as you will, for  
sons of Jupiter; let them be sacred and di-  
vine, descended, or authorised from heaven;  
give them out for whom or what you  
please, the same will happen. The people,  
generally ill treated, and contrary to right,  
will be ready on any occasion to ease them-  
selves of a burthen, that sits heavy upon  
them. They will wish and seek for th

“If Boston could have been treated like other  
places—like New-York and Philadelphia, the tea  
might have gone home from thence as it did from  
those cities. That inveterate, desperate junto, to  
whom we owe all our calamities, were determined to  
hurt us in this, as in all other cases, as much as they  
could. It is to be hoped they will one day repent,  
and be forgiven; but it is very hard to forgive with-  
out repentance. When the news of this event ar-  
rived in England, it excited such passions in the  
minister as nothing could restrain; his resentment  
was kindled into revenge, rage and madness; his  
veracity was piqued, as his master-piece of policy  
proved but a bubble: The bantling was the fruit of  
a favorite amour, and no wonder that his natural  
affection was touched, when he saw it dispatched  
before his eyes.—His grief and ingenuity, if he had  
any, were affected at the thought that he had mis-  
led the East-India company, so much nearer to de-  
struction, and that he had rendered the breach  
between the kingdom and the colonies almost  
irreconcileable; his shame was excited because op-  
position had gained a triumph over him, and the  
three kingdoms were laughing at him for his  
obstinacy and his blunders: Instead of relieving  
the company, he had hastened its ruin: Instead of  
establishing the absolute and unlimited sovereignty  
of parliament over the colonies, he had excited a  
more decisive denial of it, and resistance to it.—An  
election drew nigh, and he dreaded the resentment  
even of the corrupted electors.”  
  
The necessity of union is thus pointed out—

“If we recollect how many states lave lost their  
liberties, merely from want of communication with  
each other, and union among themselves, we shall  
think that the committees of correspondence may be

What the eloquence and talents of Demosthenes  
could not effect, among the states of Greece, might  
have been effected by so simple a device. Castile,  
Arragon, Valencia, Majorca, &amp;c. all complained of  
oppression under Charles the fifth; flew out into

## [FIRST PRINCIPLES.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/36254179)

preservation of their property. When the  
people are made miserable,and find  
themselves exposed to the ill usage of  
arbitrary power, cry up their governors  
as much as you will for sons of Jupiter,  
let them be sacred and divine, descended  
or authorised from heaven, give them for  
whom or what you please, the same will  
happen. If a long train of abuses,  
prevarications, and artifices, all  
tending the same way, make the design  
visible to the people, and they cannot  
but feel what they lie under, and see  
whither they are going; &#x27;tis not to be  
wondered that they should then rouse  
themselves, and endeavour to put the  
rule into such hands which may secure to  
them the ends for which government was  
at first erected; and without which,  
ancient names and specious forms, are so  
far from being better, that they are  
much worse than the state of nature, or  
pure anarchy. This power in the people  
of providing for their safety anew by a  
new legislative, when their legislators  
have acted contrary to their trust, by  
invading their property, is the beet  
fence against rebellion, and tile  
probablest means to hinder it. For  
rebellion being an opposition, not to  
persons but authority, which is founded  
only in tihe constitutions and laws of  
tile government; those, whoever they be,  
who by force break through, and by force  
justify their violation of them, are  
truly and properly rebels. For when men  
by entering into society and civil  
government, have excluded force, and  
introduced laws for the preservation of  
property, prace, and unity amongst  
themselves; those who set up force again  
in opposition to the laws, do rebellare,  
that is, bring back again the state of  
war, and are properly rebels: which they  
who are in power, by the pretence they  
have to authority, the temptation of  
force they have in their hands, and the
