Sir  
  
Your first letter, in a style too peremptory, made a demand, in my opinion, unprecedented and unwarrantable. My answer, pointing out the embarrassment, gave you an opportunity to take a less exceptionable course. You have not chosen to do it, but by your last letter, received this day, containing expressions indecorous and improper, you have increased the difficulties to explanation, intrinsically incident to the nature of your application.  
If by a “definite reply” you mean the direct avowal or disavowal required in your first letter, I have no other answer to give than that which has already been given. If you mean any thing different admitting of greater latitude, it is requisite you should explain.  
I have the honor to be   Sir   Your obed servt.

Sir—Your first letter, i’j style too pe­  
remptory, made a demand, in my opini­  
on, unprecedented and unwarrantable.  
M v answer, pointing out the embarrass*  
ment, gave you an opportunity to take a  
less exceptionable course. Vou have  
not chosen to do it, but by pur last let­  
ter received this day, containing expres­  
sions indecorus and improper, you have  
increased the difficultiet to explanation,  
intrinsically incident to the nature of  
your application.  
If by a 4 definite reply,&#x27; you mean the  
direct avowal or disavowal required ip  
your first letter, I have no other answer  
to give than that which (has already been  
given. If you mean aiiy thing di fiferent  
admitting of greater latitude, it ia requi­
