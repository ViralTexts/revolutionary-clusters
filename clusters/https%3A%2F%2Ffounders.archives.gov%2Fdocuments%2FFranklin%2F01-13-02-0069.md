mp duties and other duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America, . . . Then the said Bill was read a second Time, and it being proposed to commit the Bill, the same was objected to. After a long Debate thereupon, the Question was put, Whether the said Bill shall be committed: It was resolved in the Affirmative.

[BF:] Comp[limen]t the Lords. Not a wiser or better Body of Men on Earth. The deep Respect imprest on me by the Instance I have been witness to of their Justice. They have been mislead by misinformation. Proof of my Opinion of their Goodness is the Freedom with which I purpose to examine their Protests.  
  
First  
Dissentient,  
Because, as this House has in this Session by several resolutions most solemnly asserted and declared, first, “That the King’s Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled, had, hath, and of right ought to have, [BF: Neg.] full power and authority, to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the Colonies, and people of America, subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever:” [BF: Neg.] Secondly, “That tumults and insurrections of the most dangerous nature have been raised and carried on in several of the North American Colonies, in open defiance of the power and dignity of his Majesty’s Government, [BF: Neg.] and in manifest violation of the laws and legislative authority of this Kingdom:” Thirdly, “That the said tumults and insurrections have been encouraged and inflamed, by sundry votes and resolutions passed in several of the Assemblies of the said Provinces, derogatory to the honour of his Majesty’s Government,  
[BF:] Neg. All acknowledge their Subjection to his Majesty.  
and destructive of the legal and constitutional dependency of the said Colonies, on the imperial Crown and Parliament of Great Britain”: [BF: Neg.] Which resolutions were founded on a full examination of the papers on our table, manifesting a [BF inserts: daring] denial of the legislative authority of the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain,  
[BF:] Thrust yourselves in with the Crown in the Governmt. of the Colonies. [Struck out: Do your Lordships mean to call the Parliamt. imperial.]  
to impose duties and taxes on our North American Colonies; [BF: Not our, the King’s] and a criminal resistance [BF: Qu.] there made to the execution of the commercial and other regulations of the Stamp Act, and of other acts of parliament: we are of opinion, that the total repealing of that law, especially while such resistance continues, would (as Governor Barnarde says is their intention) “make the authority of Great Britain contemptible hereafter:” [BF: Not the King’s] and that such a submission of King, Lords, and Commons, under such circumstances, in so strange and unheard of a contest, would in effect, surrender their antient, unalienable rights of supreme jurisdiction, [BF: They have no such Rights.] and give them exclusively to the subordinate Provincial Legislatures established by prerogative; [BF: Glad this is acknowledg’d.] which was never intended or thought of, and is not in the power of prerogative to bestow;  
[BF:] Dispute this with the King my Lords, he has done it.  
as they are inseparable from the Three Estates of the Realm assembled in Parliament.  
[BF:] Quy, Agreed, within the Realm.  
Secondly.  
Because the law, which this Bill now proposes to repeal, was passed in the other House with very little opposition, and in this without one dissentient voice, during the last session of Parliament, which we presume, if it had been wholly and fundamentally wrong, could not possibly have happened; as the matter of it is so important,  
[BF:] Strange that a Matter of so much Importance should be pass’d over so lightly. Wise Men happening to get wrong do not therefore think it right to continue so.  
and as the intention of bringing of it in, had been communicated to the Commons by the first Commissioner of the Treasury the year before, and a resolution relating and preparatory*  
*[BF:] Much has been said of this Notice given the Colonies.  
to it was then agreed to in that House, without any division

?  
Thirdly.  
Because, if any particular parts of that law, the principle of which has been experienced and submitted to in this country, without repining,  
[BF:] The Principle differs when extended to America, toto caelo.  
for near a century past, had been found liable to just and reasonable objections, [these might have been altered by a bill for the purpose, and had the Commons sent the Lords such an amending bill, it would have been our duty to give it] a most serious consideration, with a warm desire of relieving our countrymen in America from any grievance or hardship;  
[BF:] Applaud this. Thanks for the Acknowledgment that we are your Countrymen. We desire always to be considered as such, &amp;c.  
but with proper care to enforce their submission and obedience to the law so amended,  
[BF:] This would have been wrong if the Law not well founded in Right.  
and to the whole legislative authority of Great Britain, without any reserve or distinction whatsoever.  
[BF:] This is encroaching on the Royal Power.  
Fourthly.  
Because, it appears to us, that a most essential branch of that authority, the power of Taxation, cannot be properly, equitably or impartially exercised, if it does not extend itself to all the members of the state in proportion to their respective abilities;  
  
[BF:] Right, but we are different States, Subject to the King.  
but suffers a part to be exempt from a due share of those burthens, which the public exigencies require to be imposed upon the whole:  
[BF:] If we were Parts of the State, we are not exempt from a Share of the Burthen.  
Repeat on this Head all that has been done and paid by America. King’s Message, Parl[iamen]t, Grants, &amp;c.  
a partiality which is directly and manifestly repugnant to the trust reposed by the people in every legislature, and destructive of that confidence on which all government is founded.  
[BF:] The Trust of Taxing America was never reposed by the People of America in the Legislature of Gr. Britain.  
They had one kind of Confidence indeed in that Legislature, that it would never attempt to tax them without their Consent, the Law was destructive of that Confidence among them. No body of Men on Earth more worthy of such Confidence, i e, the Power of Taxing, &amp;c. The Repeal shows it.  
Fifthly.  
Because, the ability of our North American Colonies, to bear without inconveniency the proportion laid on them by the Stamp Act of last year, appears to us most unquestionable, for the following reasons:  
[BF:] Ability to pay gives no Right to demand.  
First, That the estimated produce of this Tax, amounting to sixty thousand pounds per Annum, [BF: far too short] if divided amongst twelve hundred thousand people (being little more than one half of the subjects of the Crown in North America) would be only one shilling per head a year; which is but a third of the wages usually paid to every labourer or manufacturer there for one day’s labour:  
[BF:] Ship Money might have been easily paid. Carrying the Money out of the Province where raised to the Prejudice of their Trade.  
Secondly, That it appears by the accounts that have been laid before this House from the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, that of the debt contracted by those Colonies in the last war, above £1,755,000 has already been discharged during the course of three years only, by the funds provided for that purpose in the several Provinces;  
[BF:] These Accounts defective and short. Much easier to discharge being done by Paying in their Paper Bills to be Burnt, no Silver as the Stamp Act requird.  
and the much greater part of the remaining incumbrance, which in the whole is about 760,000 pounds, will be paid in two years more: [BF: A Mistake] We must likewise observe, that the bounties and advantages given to them by Parliament in 1764 and 1765,  
[BF, at the top of a page, partly lost by trimming:] the Dearness of Labour that you may obtain what you could not otherwise have.  
[BF:] Quy. The Principle of these Bounties. The Quantity. Why give with one hand to take away with the other?  
and the duties thereby lost to Great Britain for their service, and in order to enable them the more easily to pay this Tax,  
[BF:] How? Strange Policy! Lay an odious Tax and give Bounties to enable People to pay it!  
must necessarily amount in a few years to a far greater sum than the produce thereof. It is also evident, that such produce being wholly appropriated to the payment of the army maintained by this Kingdom in our Colonies,  
[BF:] The Stamp Revenue would necessarily have carried in Proportion. In the conquer’d Colonies. Unnecessary. Would cost as much at home. The Colonies will maintain as many as are necessary.  
at the vast expence of almost a shilling in the pound land tax, annually remitted by us for their special defence and protection;  
[BF:] Unnecessary. Give a Civil Govt. to Canada.  
not only no money would have been actually drawn by it out of that country,  
[BF:] Drawn out of different Parts.  
  
but the ease given by it to the people of Great Britain, who are labouring under a debt of seventy millions, contracted by them to support a very dangerous war, entered into for the interest and security of those Colonies,  
[BF:] The fact deny’d. State the Cause and Effect of the War. The expensive Manner of Carrying it on &amp;c.  
would have redounded to the benefit of the Colonies themselves in their own immediate safety, by contributing to deliver them from the necessary expence, which many of them have hitherto always borne, in guarding their frontiers against the savage Indians.  
[BF:] true; they have always borne it, and never desir’d you to bear any Part of it.  
The frontiers still as open to Inds. as ever. Troops posted at Fort William in Scotland as useful to protect Travellers from Highwaymen on Hounslow Heath.  
Sixthly.  
Because, not only the right, but the expediency and necessity of the supreme legislature,  
[BF:] There is yet no such Thing. It is indeed wanted and to be wish’d for. But then it should be properly qualified, by Repn.  
exerting its authority to lay a general tax on our American Colonies, whenever the wants of the public make it fitting and reasonable, that all the Provinces should contribute in a proper proportion to the defence of the whole, appear to us undeniable, from these considerations: First, that every Province being separate and independent on the others, and having no Common Council  
[BF:] Why do you not give them a Common Council. They pland one. You rejected it. They would have carried on the War without any Expence to you.  
impowered by the constitution of the Colonies to act for all, or bind all, such a tax cannot regularly, or without infinite difficulty, be imposed upon them* at any time,  
  
*[BF:] but they may as they did last War give voluntarily; Defend Marylanders.  
even for their immediate defence or protection, by their own provincial assemblies; but requires the intervention and superintending power of the Parliament of Great Britain. Secondly, That in looking forwards to the possible contingency of a new war, a contingency perhaps not far remote, the prospect of the burthens which the gentry and people of this Kingdom must then sustain, in addition to those, which now lie so heavy upon them, is so melancholy and dreadful,  
[BF:] The Colonies will contribute voluntarily. Ask ’em. Why were they not ask’d before tax’d.  
that we cannot but feel it, a most indispensible duty to ease them [BF: There’s the Rub] as much as is possible, by a due and moderate exertion of that great right, which the constitution of this realm has vested in the Parliament, [BF: Neg.] to provide for the safety of all, by a proportionable charge upon all, equally and indifferently laid. We likewise apprehend, that a partial exemption of our Colonies from any exercise of this right by the British Legislature, would be thought so invidious, and so unjust [BF: If they paid no Taxes] to the other subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, as to alienate the hearts of these from their Countrymen residing in America,  
[BF:] Great Pains has been taken to do this. The folly of it. As it will likewise necessarily alienate the Hearts of Americans.  
to the great detriment of the latter, who have on many occasions received, and may again want assistance, from the generous warmth of their affection.  
[BF:] England has on some Occasions received Assistance from America. Affection of America full as great, or greater.  
Seventhly.  
Because, the reasons assigned in the public resolutions of the Provincial Assemblies, in the North American Colonies, for their disobeying the Stamp Act, viz. “That they are not represented in the Parliament of Great Britain,” extends to all other laws, of what nature soever,  
[BF:] It is so reason’d here, not there, but in time they may be convinc’d.  
which that Parliament has enacted, or shall enact, to bind them in times to come, and must (if admitted) set them absolutely free from any obedience to the power of the British Legislature;  
[BF:] but not to the Power of the Crown.  
we likewise observe, that in a letter to Mr. Secretary Conway, dated the 12th of October 1765; the commander in chief of his Majesty’s forces in North America has declared his opinion, “That the Question is not of the inexpediency of the Stamp Act, or of the inability of the Colonies to pay the Tax; but that it is unconstitutional and contrary to their Rights, supporting the independency of the Provinces, and not subject to the legislative power of Great Britain.”  It is moreover affirmed, in a letter to Mr. Conway, dated 7th November, “That the people in general are averse to Taxes of any kind;  
[BF:] Never refuse to pay Taxes laid by their own Representatives.  
and that the merchants of that place think they have a right to every freedom of trade which the subjects of Great Britain now enjoy.”   
[BF:] If Subjects of Great Britain, not merely Subjects of the King, Why not?  
This opinion of theirs strikes directly at the Act of Navigation, and other subsequent laws, which from time to time have been made in the wise policy of that Act;  
[BF:] The Policy wise with regard to foreigners. Selfish with Regd. to Colonies.  
  
and should they ever be encouraged to procure for themselves that absolute freedom of trade, which they appear to desire, our plantations would become, not only of no benefit, [BF: Quy.] but in the highest degree prejudicial to the commerce and welfare of their Mother-country;  
[BF:] Other Advantages of Colonies besides Commerce. Selfishness of Commercial Views.  
nor is it easy to conceive a greater encouragement, than the repealing of a law opposed by them on such principles, and with so much contempt of the Sovereignty of the British Legislature.  
[BF:] The Sovereignty of the Crown I understand. The Sov[ereignt]y of the British Legislature out of Britain, I do not understand.  
Eighthly.  
Because, the appearance of weakness and timidity in the Government and Parliament of this kingdom, which a concession of this nature may too probably carry with it,  
[BF:] Govt. and Parlt. seem here to be distinguish’d.  
The Fear of being thought weak is a Timidity and Weakness of the worst Sort, as it betrays into a Persisting in Errors, that may be much more mischievous than the Appearance of Weakness. A great and Powerful State like this has no Cause for such Timidity. Acknowledging and correcting an Error, shows great Magnanimity. Small States and small Reputations [remainder lost by trimming at the bottom of the page.]  
has a manifest tendency to draw on further insults, and by lessening the respect of all his Majesty’s subjects to the dignity of his Crown,  
[BF:] Dignity of the Crown not concern’d in this.  
and authority of his Laws,  
[BF:] It was upon Laws of Parlt.  
throw the whole British empire into a miserable state of confusion and anarchy, with which it seems by many symptoms to be dangerously threatned; and this is the more to be feared, as the plea of our North American Colonies, that not being represented in the Parliament of Great Britain, they ought not to pay Taxes imposed or levied upon them by the authority thereof, may by the same reasoning be extended to all persons in this Island, who do not actually vote for Members of Parliament;  
[BF:] Case widely different, as has been often shown. But if wrong here, rectify it.  
nor can we help apprehending, that the opinion of some countenance being given to such notions by the Legislature itself, in consenting to this Bill, for the Repeal of the Stamp Act, may greatly promote the contagion of a most dangerous doctrine, destructive to all Government,  
[BF:] The Danger safely removed.  
which has spread itself over all our North American Colonies, that the obedience of the subject is not due to the Laws and Legislature of the Realm, farther than he in his private judgment shall think it comformable to the ideas he has formed of a free constitution.  
[BF:] The Subject in America only. America not in the Realm of England or G.B. No Man in America thinks himself exempt from the Jurisdiction of the Crown and their own Assemblies —or has any such private Judgment.  
Ninthly.  
Because, we think it no effectual guard, or security against this danger, that the Parliament has declared in the resolutions of both Houses, passed during this session, and now reduced into a Bill, That such notions are ill founded; as men will always look more to deeds than words, and may therefore incline to believe, that the insurrections in our Colonies, excited by those notions, having so far proved successful, as to attain the very point, at which they aimed, the immediate repeal of the Stamp Act, without any previous submission on the part of the Colonies; the Legislature has in fact submitted to them, and has only more grievously injured its own dignity and authority, by verbally asserting that Right, which it substantially yields up to their Opposition.  
  
[BF:] It is to be wish’d it had not asserted it, or asserted it with some Limitation as when qualified, &amp;c.  
The reasons assigned for this concession render it still more alarming, as they arise from an illegal and hostile combination of the people of America,  
[BF:] Surely there is nothing illegal in People’s resolving to work for themselves. Every Man in Britain may do it.  
to distress and starve our Manufacturers, and to with-hold from our Merchants the payment of their just debts:  
[BF:] No such Combination to with hold the Payment of just Debts. The Ldps. are misinform’d and ought to be highly displeas’d with those who led them to give Countenance to so horrible a Calumny.  
the former of which measures has only been practised in open war between two States; and the latter, we believe, not even in that situation, either by the public or by individuals, among the civilized nations of Europe, in modern times. If this unprecedented plan of intimidation shall meet with success, [BF: No such Plan.] it is easy to foresee, that the practice of it for other and still greater objects will frequently be renewed,  
[BF:] It is pity to give such a Hint to the Colonies, that in your Ldps. Opinion, the Act was repeal’d on Intimidation.  
and our manufacturers and merchants reduced to the like, and more permanent distress;  
[BF:] The Merchts. may avoid Distress by not giving such extensive Credit. Hope they will. The Credit ruinous to the Colonies.  
we cannot therefore but wish, that some more eligible method, consistent with their future safety and our dignity, had been taken by Parliament, to shew our tender concern and compassion for their sufferings, and to discourage any other such unwarrantable attempts;  
[BF:] Query what can that be? Pride Force  
which we are fully persuaded would have been very practicable, with due care and attention, and at an expence very inferior to the importance of the object.  
  
[BF:] Charge of Troops to subdue the Colonies.  
And do your Lordships really think Force and Bloodshed more eligible than rectifying an Error?  
Lastly.  
Because, we are convinced from the unanimous testimony of the Governors, and other officers of the Crown in America,  
[BF:] Strange Testimony to rely on. The Nature of it.  
that if, by a most unhappy delay and neglect to provide for the due execution of the law, and arming the Government there with proper orders and powers, repeatedly called for in vain,  
[BF:] Governors always complain for want of Power. Paint them.  
these disturbances had not been continued and encreased, they might easily have been quieted before they had attained to any dangerous height; and we cannot, without feeling the most lively sense of grief and indignation, hear arguments drawn from the progress of evils, which should and might have been stopped in their first and feeble beginnings, [BF: A Mistake] used for the still greater evil of sacrificing to a present relief the highest permanent interests, and the whole Majesty, Power, and Reputation of Government: This afflicts us the more deeply, because it appears from many letters, that this law, if properly supported by Government, would from the peculiar circumstances attending the disobedience to it, execute itself without bloodshed.  
[BF:] It has executed it self; that is, it has been felo de se. Observe how in some of the Colonies that there was no Occasion to execute their Laws, they died of themselves. A Law universally odious can never be executed in any Govt.  
  
And it is said in one of the letters to Mr. Secretary Conway, “That the principal view is to intimidate the Parliament; but that if it be thought prudent to enforce their authority, the people dare not oppose a vigorous resolution of the Parliament of Great Britain.”   
[BF:] The People had indeed a high Respect for Parlt.  
That vigorous resolution has not yet been found in the Parliament; and we greatly fear, that the want of it will certainly produce one of these two fatal consequences; either that the repeal of this law will in effect annull and abrogate all other laws and statutes*  
*[BF:] The Agitation of the Question of Right makes it now necessary to settle a Constitution for the Colonies.  
relating to our Colonies, and particularly the Acts that restrain or limit their Commerce, of which they are most impatient,†  
†[BF:] Restrictions should be only for the General Good. Endeavour to convince reasonable Creatures by Reason. Try your Hands with me.  
or, if we should hereafter attempt to enforce the execution of those laws against their will,  
[BF:] Never think of it. They are reasonable Creatures. Reasonable Laws will not require Force!  
and by virtue of an authority, which they have dared to insult with impunity and success, that endeavour will bring upon us all those evils and inconveniencies, to the fear of which we now sacrifice the Sovereignty of the Realm;  
[BF:] This should not have been suppos’d.  
and this at a time when the strength of our Colonies, as well as their desire of a total independence on the Legislature and Government of their Mother-country, [BF: a Mistake] may be greatly augmented, and when the circumstances and dispositions of the other powers of Europe, may render the contest far more dangerous and formidable to this Kingdom.

## Marginalia in Protests of the Lords against Repeal of the Stamp Act, [March 1766]

#### From unknown source

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

I  
Die Lunae, 17° Martii, 1766  
The Order of the Day being read for the third reading of the Bill, entituled An Act to repeal an act made in the last session of parliament, entituled, An Act for granting and applying certain stamp duties, and other duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America,. . . Then the said Bill was read a third Time, and it being proposed to pass the Bill, the same was objected to. After some Debate thereupon, the Question was put, Whether the said Bill shall pass: it was resolved in the Affirmative.  
First.  
Dissentient, [because the protesting lords think that the Declaratory Bill passed last week] cannot possibly obviate the growing mischiefs in America, where it may seem calculated only to deceive the people of Great Britain, by holding forth a delusive and nugatory affirmance of the Legislative Right of this Kingdom,  
[BF:] It is indeed a nugatory Affirmance and we Americans are oblig’d to your Lo[rdshi]ps for justifying our Esteeming it such.  
If you had such Right before it was unnecessary. If not, you could not give your selves a Right you had not, without our Consent.  
whilst the enacting part of it does no more than abrogate the Resolutions of the House of Representatives in the North American Colonies, [BF: It cannot abrogate them] which have not in themselves the least colour of authority; and declares, that which is apparently and certainly criminal, only null and void [BF: neither].  
[BF:] I beg your Lps. Pardon. They are only declaratory of their own Opinion of their own Rights, and are certainly authentic; they may indeed like this Act be null and void or as your Lps. call it nugatory. But I should think by no means criminal.   
Secondly.  
[Because the particular objections made to the Stamp Act in America and adopted in the course of the debates on the repealing bill are contradicted by undeniable evidence before us] First, that all the money to be collected by this Tax was to be annually remitted hither, and that the North American Colonies would thereby be drained of all their specie;  
[BF:] Particular Colonies drained, all drained, as it would all come home. Those that were to pay most of the Tax would have least of it spent at home. It must go to the conquer’d Colonies. The View of Maps deceives.  
and Secondly, That the institution of Vice Admiralty Courts in those Colonies, for the recovery of Penalties upon Revenue Laws without Juries, is a novel practice, [whereby the colonists would be deprived of trial by jury, “one of their most valuable Liberties,” and would thereby be distinguished from fellow subjects in Britain;]  
  
[BF:] Talk with Bollan on this Head. Query, Courts of Common Law.  
[In reference to the first of these objections, it appears that the Treasury had ordered that the revenue to be raised by the act was to be paid over directly] to the Deputy Pay-master in America, to defray the subsistence of the troops, and any military expences incurred in the colonies.  
[BF:] America not a Village; may not England be drain’d by a War in Germany, tho’ the Money still in Europe.  
[In reference to the second objection, sundry acts of Parliament show that a jurisdiction has been assigned to the judges of the Admiralty Courts] for the recovery of penalties upon the Laws of Revenue and of Trade, without Juries for near a century past [and in some colonies these Admiralty judges] are the only Judges not elected by the people:  
[BF:] All a Breach of the Constitution. Juries better to be trusted. Have rather an Interest in suppressing Smugglers. Nature of Smuggling. It is Picking of Pockets. All Oppressions take their Rise from some Plea of Utility, often in Appearance only.  
[The Americans are far from being distinguished by being deprived of trials by jury, for the laws regarding stamp duties in Great Britain provide that penalties are to be] recoverable also without a Jury, before two Justices of the Peace, with the like Powers in both cases;  
[BF:] Gentlemen of Property, and Character. No Profit. Arguing from one Evil to another.  
[the Lords are glad to learn, moreover, that the Treasury reported on July 4 last a plan to erect] three different Courts of Vice Admiralty at the most convenient Places [in America], with proper Districts annexed to each; and to give the Judges sufficient and Honorable Salaries in lieu of all poundage and fees whatsoever;  
[BF:] well intended.  
[The Lords observe with concern and surprise that this representation was incorporated in a clause in the Stamp Act, and was expressly calculated to relieve the American subjects] from many unnecessary hardships and oppressions, to which they are now liable by many other Laws still subsisting  
[BF:] Query, What were the particulars. Ask Mr. Cooper.  
[but that this arrangement] should be totally disregarded for several months, and be suffered to remain unexecuted in every part of it even to this day; [and no notice of this plan has been sent to the gover

lthough the matter had been fully “opened and approved in Parliament” when the Stamp Act was proposed;] and as the total neglect of it has given occasion to great Clamour and Dissatisfaction in the Colonies.  
[BF:] An Excuse however, for the Colonies. Repeat all the other Articles of Excuse.  
[The Stamp Act was not to take place until November 1; if Parliament had been summoned early] their determinations, either for enforcing or repealing that Law, would probably have delivered the Merchants and Manufacturers here from all the difficulties and distress to which they have been for so many months exposed; nor would the disorders in America, where all government is prostrate, have risen to so great a height, or taken so deep a root.  
[BF:] They were risen to the highest Pitch before any Advice of Parli[amenta]ry Proceedings could have reach’d them, tho’ the Parl[iamen]t had met in Novr. as usual.  
Thirdly.  
[Because the argument is “extremely ill founded” that the experiment of a Stamp Act has failed; if it had been properly tried] with the same zeal for its success with which it was first proposed, it would not have failed in any of the Colonies: and that this was the opinion of the greater part of the Governors in North America;  
[BF:] Their Opinion not to be relied on.  
and of many of the most intelligent and respectable persons in those provinces [is evidenced by letters from the governors now on our table and from] the latter having applied for, and accepted the Office of Distributor of the Stamps under that Act, which they certainly would not have done [thereby exposing their lives and fortunes, had they considered the success of the act precarious:]  
[BF:] Their Interest blinded them.  
[and we have heard of no “impracticability” attending the act in Jamaica, Barbados,] and some other of the West India islands, or in those of our Colonies in North America, where it has been executed.  
[BF:] West India Islands. Jamaica divided—Barbados weak. St. Kits and some others burnt the Stamps. Canada, New Subjects and Soldiers, Halifax, few People. Georgia Ditto. Both Parl[iamentar]y Colonies.  
Fourthly.  
Because, a Precedent of the two Houses of Parliament, lending their Power, from motives of Fear or Impatience under a present uneasiness, to overturn in one month a Plan of Measures, undertaken with their warmest Approbation and Concurrence, after the most mature deliberation of two years together,  
[BF:] but one year and no Deliberation, no Debate in the Lords.  
for the improvement of our Revenue, and the relief of our People [BF: Ay there!] will effectually discourage all officers of the Crown in America from doing their duty, and executing the Laws of this Kingdom;  
[BF:] Likely, ’till those Laws are more reasonable or better founded.  
and is enough to deter future Ministers, in any circumstances of distress or danger to their Country, from opposing their fortitude and zeal for the service of the Publick, to strong Combinations of private and particular Interests, to the Clamour of Multitudes, or the Malice of Faction [which will create such weakness as will soon end in the downfall of the State].  
[BF:] The Clamour of Multitudes. It is good to attend to it. It is wise to foresee and avoid it. It is wise, when neither foreseen nor avoided, to correct the Measures that give Occasion to it. Glad the Majority have that Wisdom.  
Lastly.  
Because, the Repeal of this Law under the present Circumstances, will, we fear,  
[BF:] Do not fear, my Lords, this is an unnecessary Timidity.  
not only surrender the Honour and essential Interests of the Kingdom now and for ever, both at home and abroad,  
[BF:] The Honour and essential Interests to be maintaind by Equity and Justice.  
but will also deeply affect the fundamental Principles of our Constitution;  
[BF:] They are mistaken. Legislation over the Colonies is not one of them.  
for if we pass this Bill against our Opinion, from the Threats and Compulsion publickly avowed in our Colonies, and enforced by the most unjustifiable means within Great Britain, we disclaim that Legislative Authority over the subjects, which we own ourselves unable to maintain.  
[BF:] over the Subjects within the Realm you have it. I do not disclaim. You are able to maintain it: for the People are willing you should.  
[If the lords give assent to this bill without conviction that it is right, merely because it has passed the Commons,] we in effect annihilate this branch of the Legislature, and vote ourselves useless. Or if by passing this Bill, we mean to justify those, who in America, and even in Great Britain, have treated a series of British Acts of Parliament as so many Acts of Tyranny and Oppression, which it is scarcely criminal to resist;  
  
[BF:] They are such when extended beyond the Realm to take Money without Consent.  
[or to justify] those officers of the Crown, who, under the eye, and with the knowledge of Government, have taken upon themselves, whilst the Parliament was Sitting, without its Consent, to suspend the Execution of the Stamp Act, by admitting Ships from the Colonies, with unstampt Clearances, to an Entry, in direct Violation of it,  
[BF:] Would you seize your own Property? Quy the Act.  
[which appears to have been done;] we shall then give our approbation to an open breach of the first Article of that great Palladium of our Liberties, the Bill of Rights;* [which declares the suspending of laws without the consent of Parliament to be illegal].  
*[BF:] Wish your Lordships had attended to that other great Article of the Palladium “Taxes shall not be laid but by common Consent in Parliament.” We Americans were not there to give our Consent.  
Lastly, If we ground our Proceedings upon the Opinion of those who have contended in this House, that from the Constitution of our Colonies they ought never to be taxed,†  
†[BF:] meaning here. No body thinks they ought not to tax themselves.  
even for their own immediate Defence, we fear that such a Declaration, by which near a fifth part of the subjects of Great Britain, who by the Acts of Parliament to restrain the Pressing of Seamen in America, are already exempted from furnishing Men to our Navy, are to be for ever exempted from contributing their share towards their own support in money likewise, will, from the flagrant Partiality and Injustice of it,  
[BF:] No, no. they never did or will desire it. Fact wrongly Stated.  
either depopulate this Kingdom, or shake the basis of Equality, and of that Original Compact, upon which every Society is founded; and as we believe, that there is no instance of such a permanent Exemption [BF: No Exemptions desired] of so large a body of the subjects of any State in any History, antient or modern, we are extremely apprehensive of the fatal Consequences  
[BF:] too apprehensive. No bad Consequences will arise.  
of this unhappy Measure [BF: rather happy]; to which, for these Reasons, in addition to those contained in the Protest of the 11th of this month, our Duty to the King, and Justice to our Country, oblige us to enter this our Solemn Dissent. [Here follow the n

deſtructive of the legal and conſtitutional de-

Which reſolutions were founded on a full exa-  
mination of the papers on our table, manifeſt-  
ing a denial of the legiſlative authority of the  
Crown and Parliament of Great Britain, to im-  
pole duties and taxes on our North American  
Colonies; and a criminal reſiſtance there made  
to the execution of the commercial and other  
regulations of the Stamp Act, and of other acts  
of parliament : we are of opinion, that the to-  
tal repealing of that law, eſpecially while ſuch  
reſiſtance continues, Would (as Governor Bar-  
narde ſays is their intention) make the autho-

3dly, Becauſe, if any particular parts of that  
law, the principal of which has been experi-  
enced and ſubmitted to in this country, with-  
out repining, for near a century paſt, had been  
found liable to juſt and reaſonable objections,  
they might have been altered by a Bill to ex-  
plain and amend it, without repealing the  
whole. And, if any ſuch Bill had been ſent  
to us by the Commons, we ſhould have thought  
it our duty to have given it a moſt ſerious con-  
ſideration, with a warm deſire of relieving our  
countrymen in America from any grievance or  
hardſhip ; but with proper care to enforce their  
ſubmiſſion and obedience to the law ſo amend-  
ed, and to the whole legiſlative authority of  
Great Britain, without any reſerve or diſtinc-  
  
tion whatſoever.  
lh.  
  
3  
 4thly, Becauſe, it appears to us, that a  
moit eſſential branch of that authority, the  
power of Taxation, cannot be properly, equi-  
tably, or impartially exerciſed, if it does not  
extend itſelf to all the members of the ſtate in  
21 ia to their reſpective abilities; but  
ſuffers a part to be exempt from a due ſhare of  
thoſe. burthens, which the public exigencies re-  
quire to be impoſed upon the whole : a parti-  
ality which is directly and manifeſtly repugnant  
to the truſt repoſed by the people in every le-  
giflature, and deſtructive of that confidence on  
which all government is founded.  
 Zthly, Becauſe, the ability of our North-  
American Colonies, to bear without inconveni-  
ency the proportion laid on them by the Stamp  
Act of lat ear, appears to us moſt unqueſtion-  
able, for the following reaſons: Firſt, That  
the eſtimated produce of this Tax, amounting  
to ſixty thouſand pounds per Annum, if divided  
amongſt twelve hundred thouſand people (being  
little more than one half of the ſubjects of the  
Crown in North America) would be only one  
ſhilling per head a year; which is but a third  
of the wages uſually paid to every labourer or  
manufacturer there for one day&#x27;s labour : Se-  
condly, That it appears by the accounts that *  
Have been laid before this Houſe from the Com-  
miſſioners of Trade and Plantations, that of the  
debt contracted by thoſe Colonies in the laſt  
war, above 1,755,000/, has already been diſ-  
charged during the courſe of three years only,  
by the funds provided for that purpoſe in the  
  
ſeyeral Provinces; and the much greater _  
0  
  
0  
  
(7  
of the remaining incumbrance, which in the  
whole is about 760,000 pounds, will be paid  
in two years more: We mult likewiſe obſerve,  
that the bounties and adyantages given to them  
by Parliament in 1764 and 1765, and the du-  
ties thereby loſt to Great Britain for their ſer-  
vice, and in order to enable them the more eaſily  
to pay this Tax, muſt neceſſarily amount in a  
few years to a far greater ſum than the pro-  
duce thereof. It is alſo evident, that ſuch pro-  
duce being wholly appropriated to the payment  
of the army maintained by this Kingdom in  
our Colonies, at the vaſt expence of almoſt a  
ſhilling in the pound land tax, annually remit-  
ted by us for their ſpecial defence and protec-  
tion ; not only no money would have been ac-  
tually drawn by it out of that country, but the  
_ eaſe given by it to the people of Great Britain,  
who are labouring under a debt of ſeventy mil-  
lions, contracted by them to ſupport a very  
dangerous war, entered into for the intereſt and  
ſecurity of thoſe Colonies, would have re-  
dounded to the benefit of the Colonies them-  
ſelves in their own immediate ſafety, by con-  
tributing to deliver them from the neceſſary  
expence, which many of them have hitherto  
always borne, in guarding their frontiers againſt  
the ſavage Indians.  
  
6:hly, Becauſe, not only the right, but the  
expediency and neceſſity of the ſupreme le-  
Ane exerting its authority to lay a gene-  
ral tax on our American Colonies, whenever  
the wants of the public make it fitting and  
reaſonable that all the Provinces ſhould contri-  
bute  
  
11  
  
bute in a proper proportion to the defence of  
the whole, appear to us undeniable, from theſe  
conſiderations: Firſt, That every Province be-  
ing ſeparate and independent on the others, and  
having no Common Council impowered by the  
conſtitution of the Colonies to act for all, or  
bind all, ſuch a tax cannot regularly, or with-  
out infinite difficulty, be impoſed upon them,  
at any time, even for their immediate defence  
or protection, by their own provincial aſſem-  
blies; but requires the intervention and ſuper-  
intending power of the Parliament of Great-  
Britain. Secondly, That in looking forwards  
to the poſſible contingency of a new war, a  
contingency perhaps not far remote, the proſ-  
pect of the burthens, which the gentry and  
  
eople of this Kingdom muſt then ſuſtain, in  
addition to thoſe, which now lie ſo heavy upon  
them, is ſo melancholy and dreadful, that we  
cannot but feel it, a molt indiſpenſible duty, to  
eaſe them as much as is poſſible, by a due and  
moderate exertion of that great right, which  
the conſtitution of this realm has veſted in the  
Parliament, to provide for the ſafety of all, by  
a proportionable charge upon all, equally and  
indifferently laid. We: likewiſe apprehend,  
that a partial exemption of our Colonies from  
any exerciſe of this right by the Britiſh Le-  
giſlature, would be thought ſo invidious, and  
ſo unjuſt to the other ſubjects of the Crown of  
Great Britain, as to alienate the hearts of theſe  
from their Countrymen reſiding in America, to  
the great detriment of the latter, who have on  
many occaſions received, and may again want  
  
aſſiſt -  
  
5  
aſſiſtance, from the generous warmth of their  
affection.  
  
7thly, Becauſe, the reaſons aſſigned in the  
public reſolutions of the Provincial Aſſem-  
blies, in the North American Colonies, for  
their diſobeying the Stamp Act, viz. That  
they are not repreſented in the Parliament of  
Great Britain, extends to all other laws, of  
what nature ſoever, which that Parliament has  
enacted, or ſhall enact, to bind them in times  
to come, and muſt (if admitted) ſet them ab-  
ſolutely free from any obedience to the power of  
the Rritiſh Legiſlature. We likewiſe obſerve,  
that in a letter to Mr. Secretary Conway, dated  
the 12th of October 1765; the commander in  
chief of his Majeſty&#x27;s forces in North America  
has declared his opinion, “ That the Queſtion  
« is not of the inexpediency of the Stamp Act,  
« or of the inability of the Colonies to pay the  
© Tax; but that it is unconſtitutional and con-  
„ trary to their Rights, ſupporting the inde-  
« pendency of the Provinces, and not ſubject  
* to the legiſlative power of Great Britain.”  
It is moreover affirmed, in a letter to Mr. Con-  
way, dated 7th November, That the peo-  
« ple in general are averſe to Taxes of any  
&amp; kind; and that the merchants of that place  
ce think they have a right to every freedom of  
e trade which the ſubje&amp;s of Great Britain  
* now enjoy.” This opinion of theirs ſtrikes  
directly at the Act of Navigation, and other  
ſubſequent laws, which from time to time have  
been made in the wiſe policy of that Act; and  
  
ſhould they ever be encouraged to procure for  
them-  
  
11  
themſelves that abſolute freedom of trade, which  
they appear to deſire, our plantations would be-  
come, not only of no benefit, but in the higheſt  
degree prejudicial to the commerce and welfare  
of their Mother- country; nor is it eaſy to con-  
ceive a greater encouragement, than the repeal-  
ing of a law, oppoſed by them on ſuch prin-  
ciples, and with ſo much contempt of the Sove-  
reignty of the Britiſh Legiſlature.  
 8tbly, Becauſe, the appearance of weakneſs  
and timidity in the Government and Parlia-  
ment of this kingdom, which a conceſſion of  
this nature may too probably carry with it, has  
a manifeſt tendency to draw on further inſults,  
and by leſſening the reſpect of all his Majeſty&#x27;s  
ſubjects to the dignity of his Crown, and au-  
thority of his Laws, throw the whole Britiſh  
empire into a miſerable ſtate of contuſion and  
anarchy, with which it ſeems by many ſymp-  
toms to be dangerouſly threatened : and this is  
the more to be feared, as the plea of our North  
American Colonies, that, not being repreſent-  
ed in the Parliament of Great Britain, they  
ought not to pay Taxes impoſed or levied upon  
them by the authority thereof, may by the  
ſame reaſoning be extended to all perſons in  
this Iſland, who do not actually vote for Mem-  
bers of Parliament; nor can we help appre-  
hending, that the opinion of ſome countenance  
being given to ſuch notions by the Legiſlature  
itſelf, in conſenting to this Bill for the Repeal  
of the Stamp Act, may greatly promote the  
contagion of a moſt dangerous doctrine, de-  
ſtructive to all Government, which has ſpread  
| | itſelf  
  
1  
  
itſelf over all our North American Colonies,  
that the obedience of the ſubject is not due to  
the Laws and Legiſlature of the Realm, farther  
than he in his private judgment ſhall think it  
_ conformable to the ideas he has formed of a  
free conſtitution.  
  
9:hly, Becauſe, we think it no effectual guard,  
or ſecurity, againſt this danger, that the Par-  
liament has declared in the reſolutions of both  
Houſes, paſſed during this ſeſſion, and now re-  
duced into a Bill, That ſuch notions are ill  
founded ; as men will always look more to  
deeds than words, and may therefore incline to  
believe, that the inſurrections in our Colonies,  
excited by thoſe notions, having ſo far proved  
ſucceſsful, as to attain the very point, at which  
they aimed, the immediate repeal of the Stamp  
Act, without any previous ſubmiſſion on the  
part of the Colonies; the Legiſlature has in  
fact ſubmitted to them, and has only more  
grievouſly injured its own dignity and autho-  
rity, by verbally aſſerting that Right, which it  
ſubſtantially yields up to their Oppoſition, The  
reaſons aſſigned for this conceſſion render it  
{till more alarming, as they ariſe from an illegal  
and hoſtile combination of the people of Ame-  
rica, to diſtreſs and ſtarve our Manufacturers,  
and to with-hold from our Merchants the pay-  
ment of their juſt debts : the former of which  
meaſures has only been practiſed in open war  
between two States ; and the latter, we be-  
lieve, not even in that ſituation, either by the  
  
public or by individuals, among the civilized  
B 2 nations  
  
12 J  
  
nations of Europe, in modern times. If this  
unprecedented plan of intimidation ſhall meet  
with ſucceſs, it is eaſy to foreſee, that the prac-  
tice of it for other and ſtill greater objects will  
frequently be-renewed, and our manufacturers  
and merchants reduced to the like, and more  
permanent diſtreſs : we cannot therefore but  
wiſh, that ſome more eligible method, conſiſ-  
tent with their future ſafety and our dignity,  
had been taken by Parliament, to ſhew our  
tender concern and compaſſion for their ſuf-  
ferings, and to diſcovrage any other ſuch un-  
warrantable attempts ; which we are fully per-  
ſuaded would have been very practicable, with  
due care and attention, and at an expence very  
inferior to the importance of the object.  
  
| Laſily, Becauſe, we are convinced from the  
unanimous teſtimony of the Governors, and  
other officers of the Crown in America, that if,  
by a moſt unhappy delay and neglect to provide  
for the due execution of the law, and arm the  
Government there with proper orders and pow-  
ers, repeatedly called for in vain, theſe diſturb-  
ances had not been continued and encreaſed,  
they might eaſily have been quieted before they  
had attained to any dangerous height; and we  
cannot, without feeling the moſt lively ſenſe of  
grief and indignation, hear arguments drawn  
from the progreſs of evils, Which ſhould and  
might have been ſtopped in their firſt and feeble  
beginnings, uſed for the {till greater evil of ſa-  
crificing to a preſent; relief the higheſt perma-  
  
nent intereſts, and the whole Majeſty, Power,  
and  
  
TR]  
and Reputation of Government: This afflicts  
us the more deeply, becauſe it appears from  
many letters, that this law, if properly ſup-  
ported by Government, would from the pecu-  
liar circumſtances attending the diſobedience  
to it, execute itſelf without bloodſhed. And  
it is ſaid in one of the letters to Mr. Secretary  
Conway, That the principal view is to inti-  
* midate the Parliament; but that if it be  
thought prudent to enforce their authority,  
* the people dare not oppoſe a vigorous reſo-  
« lution of the Parliament of Great Britain.“  
That vigorous reſolution has not yet been  
found in the Parliament ; and we greatly fear,  
that the want of it will certainly produce one  
of theſe two fatal conſequences ; either that the  
repeal of this law will in effect annull and abro-  
gate all other laws and ſtatutes relating to our  
Colonies, and particularly the Acts that reſtrain  
or limit their Commerce, of which they are  
moſt impatient ; or, if we ſhould hereafter at-  
tempt to enforce the execution of thoſe laws  
againſt their will, and by virtue of an authori-  
ty, which they have dared to inſult with im-  
punity and ſucceſs, that endeavour will bring  
upon us all thoſe evils and inconveniencies, to  
the fear of which we now ſacrifice the Sove-  
reignty of the Realm; and this at a time when  
the ſtrength of our Colonies, as well as their  
defire of a total independence on the Legiſlature  
and Government of their Mother-country, may  
be greatly augmented, and when the circum-  
ſtances and diſpoſitions of the other powers of  
  
Europe,

Die Lune, 17 Martii, 1766.  
  
The Order of the Day being read for the third reading of  
the Bill, entituled, An A to repeal an af? made in the laſt  
ſeſſion of parliament, entituled, An A for granting and ap-  
plying certain Stamp Duties, and other duties in the Britiſh  
Colonies and Plantations in America, towards further defray -  
ing the expences of defending, protecting, and ſecuring the  
fame, and for amending ſuch parts of the ſeveral atts of par-  
liament relating to the Trade and Revenues of the ſaid Colonies  
and Plantations, as direct the manner of Determining and Re-  
covering the Penalties and Forfeitures therein mentioned. Then  
the ſaid Bill was read a third Time, and it being propoſed  
to paſs the Bill, the ſame was objected to. After ſome  
Debate thereupon, the Queſtion: was put, Whether the  
ſaid Bill ſhall paſs: It was reſolved in the Affirmative.  
  
Di ſentient,  
1/t, DECAUSE ve think, that the Decla-  
ratory Bill we paſt laſt week, can-  
not poſſibly obviate the growing miſchiefs in  
  
America, where 1t may ſeem calculated only to  
  
deceive the people of Great Britain, by holding  
  
forth a delufive and nugatory affirmance of the  
  
Legiſlative Right of this Kingdom, whilſt the  
  
enacting part of it does no more than abrogate  
  
the Reſolutions of the Houſe of Repreſenta-  
tives in the North American Colonies, which  
have not in themſeives the leaſt colour of au-  
thority ; and declares that, which is apparent-  
ly and certainly criminal, only null and void.  
2dly, Becauſe the particular Objections, which  
have been made to the Stamp Act in North  
  
America, and which have been adopted in the  
  
courſe of the Debates upon this Bill tor repeal-  
  
ing it, are in fact contradicted by undeniable  
  
Evidence upon our Table; it having been urg-  
  
ed, Firſt, That all the money to be collected  
by  
  
„5 „  
by this Tax was to be annually remitted hither,  
and that the North American Colonies would  
thereby be drained of all their ſpecie; and Se-  
condly, That the inſtitution of Vice Admiralty  
Courts in thoſe Colonies, for the recovery of  
Penalties upon Revenue Laws without Juries,  
is a novel practice, by means of which his  
Majeſty&#x27;s Subjects in thoſe dominions, © would  
be deprived of one of their moſt valuable Li-  
« berties, Trials by Juries, and in this reſpect  
tt diſtinguiſhed from their Fellow Subjects in  
« Great Britain ;” and would likewiſe be liable  
to the greateſt Inconvenience, Vexation and In-  
juſtice, through the option left to any Proſe-  
cutor to call them from one end of that exten-  
ſive Continent to the other; and through the  
temptation to the Judge, to condemn rather  
than to acquit, from his being paid by pound-  
age of the condemnation- money: Whereas

tion, it is manifeſt, from ſundry Acts of Parlia-  
ment, that a juriſdiction has beea aſſigned to  
the Judges of thoſe Courts, for the recovery of  
penalties upon the Laws of Revenue and of  
Trade, without Juries, for near a century paſt,  
from the conſideration (as we apprehend) that  
in ſome of the Colonies they are the only Judges  
not elected by the people: and fo far it is from  
being true, that the Subjects in North America,  
by being deprived in theſe Caſes of Trials by  
Juries, were in that reſpect diſtinguiſhed from  
their Fellow - ſubjects in Great Britain; that,  
in this very inſtance of the Stamp Duties, the  
Penalties, which by the American Stamp Act  
were made recoverable without a Jury before  
a Judge of the Vice Admiralty Court, are, by  
the Laws now in force for collecting the Stamp  
Duties in Great Britain, recoverable alſo with-  
out a Jury, before two Juſtices of the Peace,  
with the like Powers in both caſes, which we  
earneſtly wiſh were not ſtill more neceſſary for  
the collection of the Public Revenue in Ame-  
rica than in Great Britain; and which we  
ſhould be moſt deſirous, if poſſible, to alleviate  
in both countries: with this view, and to take  
away all juſt occaſion for diſcontent, we were  
very glad to find by the Repreſentation from  
the late Commiſſioners of the Treaſury to his  
Majeſty in Council, dated on the 4th day of  
July laſt, that the ſtricteſt attention had been  
given by that Board to prevent the inconveni-

to eſtabliſh three different Courts of Vice Ad-

that Minute and Repreſentation, had been fully  
opened and approved in Parliament, at the  
time when the Stamp Act was propoſed ; and  
as the total negle&amp; of it has given occaſion to  
great Clamour and Diſſatisfaction in the Colo-  
nies. We cannot help further obſerving, that  
as the Stamp Act was not to take place till  
the iſt of November, if the Parliament had  
been called early, their determinations, either  
for enforcing or repealing that Law, would  
probably have delivered the Merchants and  
Manufacturers here from all the difficulties and  
diſtreſs to which they have been for ſo many  
months  
  
[ 19 ]  
months expoſed; nor would the diſorders in  
America, where all government 1s proſtrate,  
have riſen to fo great a height, or taken ſo deep  
a root.  
3dly, Becauſe, the Argument which has been  
uſed in favour of this Bill of Repeal, that the ex-  
3 of the Stamp Act has been tried, and  
as failed, is extremely ill founded; as it mani-  
feſtly appears from the whole tenor of the Pa-  
pers laid before us, that if this experiment had  
been properly tried, with the ſame zeal for its  
ſucceſs with which it was firſt propoſed, it  
would not have failed in any of the Colonies :  
and that this was the opinion of the greater  
art of the Governors in North America, and  
of many of the moſt intelligent and reſpect-  
able perſons in thoſe provinces, for ſome time  
after this Act was paſſed, is evident beyond a  
doubt, from the Letters of the former now  
upon our Table, and from the latter having  
applied for, and accepted the Office of Diſtri-  
butors of the Stamps under that Act, which  
they certainly would not have done, and thereby  
have expoſed their Lives and Fortunes to the  
violence and outrages which they have ſince  
undergone, if they had then thought the ſuc-  
ceſs of this meaſure in any degree precarious :  
nor have we heard of any impracticability at-  
tending this Law in Jamaica and Barbadoes,  
and ſome other of the Weſt India iflands, or  
in thoſe of our Colonies in North America,  
where it has been executed,  
4thly, Becauſe, a Precedent of the two Houſes  
of Parliament lending their Power, from x”  
C 2 0  
  
( 20 ]  
  
of Fear or Impatience under a preſent uneaſi-  
neſs, to overturn in one month a Plan of Mea-  
ſures, undertaken with their warmeſt Appro-  
bation and Concurrence, after the moſt mature  
deliberation of two years together, for the im-  
provement of our Revenue, and the relief of  
our People, will effectually diſcourage all offi-  
7 cers of the Crown in America from doing their  
duty, and executing the Laws of this King-  
  
1 dom ; and is enough to deter future Miniſters,  
in any circumſtances of diſtreſs or danger to  
their Country, from oppoſing their fortitude  
and zeal for the ſervice of the Public, to ſtrong  
Combinations of private and particular In-  
tereſts, to the Clamour of Multitudes, or the  
Malice of Faction; which muſt neceſſarily  
bring on ſuch a Weakneſs and Puſilanimity in  
the Adminiſtration of Government, as will ſoon  
  
end in the Downfal and Ruin of the State.  
TLaſiiy, Becauſe, the Repeal of this Law under  
the preſent Circumſtances, will, we fear, not  
only ſurrender the Honour and efſential Intereſts  
| of the Kingdom now and for ever, both at home  
if and abroad, but will alſo deeply affect the fun-  
| damental Principles of our Conſtitution ; for  
if we paſs this Bill againſt our Opinion, from  
the Threats and Compulfion publicly avowed  
in our Colonies, and enforced by the moſt un-  
juſtifiable means within Great Britain, we dif-  
claim that Legiſlative Authority over the ſub-  
jects, which we own ourſelves unable to main-

where our interpoſition, for many obvious Rea-  
ſons, would be peculiarly proper; we in effect  
annihilate this branch of the Legiſlature, and  
vote ourſelves uſeleſs. Or if by paſſing this  
Bill, we mean to juſtify thoſe, who in Ame-  
rica, and even in Great Britain, have treated  
a ſeries of Britiſh Acts of Parliament as ſo  
many Acts of Tyranny and Oppreſſion, which it is  
ſcarcely criminal to reſiſt ; or thoſe officers of  
the Crown, who, under the eye, and with the  
knowledge of Government, have taken upon  
themſelves, whilſt the Parliament was Sitting,  
without its Conſent, to ſuſpend the Execution  
of the Stamp Act, by admitting Ships from the  
Colonies, with unſtampt Clearances, to an En-  
try, in direct Violation of it, which from the  
Papers upon our Table appears to have been  
done ; we ſhall then give our approbation to an  
open breach of the firſt Article of that great

by which it is declared, That the pretended  
% power of ſuſpending of Laws, or the exe-

If we ground our Proceedings upon the Opi-  
nion of thoſe who have contended in this  
Houſe, that from the Conſtitution of our Co-  
lonies they ought never to be taxed, even for  
their own immediate Defence, we fear that

eſpecially  
  
1  
  
eſpecially while ſuch reſiſtance continues,  
would (as Governor Barnarde ſays is their in-  
tention) © make the authority of Great Bri-  
tain contemptible hereafter;“ and that ſuch  
a ſubmiſſion of King, Lords, and Commons,  
under ſuch circumſtances, in ſo ſtrange and un-  
heard of a conteſt, would in effect, ſurrender  
their antient, unalienable rights of A  
juriſdiction, and give them excluſively to the  
ſubordinate Provincial Legiſlatures eſtabliſhed  
by prerogative; which was never intended  
or thought of, and is not in the power of  
prerogative to beſtow ; as they are inteparable  
from the Three Eſtates of the Realm aſſem-  
bled in Parliament.  
  
SECON DLX.  
  
Becauſe the law, which this Bill now  
propoſes to repeal, was paſſed in the other  
Houſe with very little oppoſition, and in this  
without one diſſentient voice, during the laſt  
feſſion of Parliament, which we preſume, if  
it had been wholly and fundamentally wrong,  
could not poſhbly have happened; as the  
matter of it is fo important, and as the in-  
tention of bringing of it in, had been com-  
municated to the Commons by the firſt Com-  
miſſioner of the Treaſury the year before, and  
a reſolution relating and preparatory to it

THIRDLY.  
  
Becauſe, if any particular parts of that  
law, the principal of which has been ex-  
perienced and ſubmitted to in this country,  
without repining, for near a century patt,  
had been found liable to juſt and reaſon-  
able objeCtions, they might have been al-  
tered by a Bill to explain and amend it, with-  
out repealing the whole. And, if any ſuch Bill  
had been ſent to us by the Commons, we  
ſhould have thought it our duty to have  
given it a moſt ſerious conſideration, with  
a warm defire of relieving our countrymen  
in America from any grievance or hardſhip ;  
but with proper care to enforce their ſub-  
miſſion and obedience to the law ſo amend-  
ed, and to the whole legiſlative authority  
of Great Britain, without any reſerve or  
diſtinction whatſoever.  
  
FoUuRTHLY.  
  
Becauſe, it appears to us, that a moſt  
eſſential branch of that authority, the pow-  
er of Taxation, cannot be properly, equita-  
bly or impartially exerciſed, iff it does not  
extend itſelf to all the members of the  
ſtate in proportion to their reſpective abili-  
lities; but ſuffers a part to be exempt from  
a due ſhare of thoſe burthens, which the  
pubiic exigencies require to be impoſed  
upon the whole: a partiality which is di-  
  
rectly  
  
1  
  
rectly and manifeſtly repugnant to the truſt  
repoted by the people in every legiſlature,  
and deſtructive of that confidence on which  
all government is founded.  
  
FIF THL.  
  
Becauſe, the ability of our North Ameri-  
can Colonies, to bear without inconveni-  
ency the proportion laid on them by the  
Stamp Act of laſt year, appears to us moſt  
unqueſtionable, for the following reaſons :  
Firſt, that the eſtimated produce of this Tax,  
amounting to ſixty thouſand pounds per An-  
num, if divided amongſt twelve hundred  
thouſand people (being little more than one  
half of the ſubjects of the Crown in North  
America) would be only one ſhilling per  
head a year; which is but a third of the  
wages uſually paid to every labourer or ma-  
nutacturer there for one day&#x27;s labour: Se-  
condly, That it appears by the accounts that  
have been laid before this Houſe from the  
Commiſſioners of Trade and Plantations, *  
that of the debt contracted by thoſe Colo-  
nies in the laſt war, above 1,755,000 /. has  
already been diſcharged during the courſe of  
three years only, by the ſunds provided for  
that purpoſe in the ſeveral provinces ; and  
the much greater part of the remaining  
incumbrance, which in the whole is abour  
760,000 pounds, will be paid in two years  
more: We muſt likewiſe obſerve, that the  
  
A 4 bounties  
  
*  
  
bounties and advantages given to them by  
Parliament, in 1764 and 1765, and the duties  
thereby loſt to Great Britain for their ſer-  
vice, and in order to enable them the more  
eaſily to pay this Tax, muſt neceſſarily a-  
  
mount in 2 few years to a far greater  
ſum than the produce thereof. It is alſo  
evident, that ſuch produce being wholly  
appropriated to the payment of the army  
maintained by this Kingdom in our Colo-  
nies, at the vait expence of almoſt a ſhil-  
ling in the pound land tax, annuaily re-  
mitted by us for their ſpecial defence and  
protection; not only no money would have  
been actually drawn by it out of that coun-  
try, but the eaſe given by it to the people  
of Great Britain, who are labouring under  
a debt of ſeventy millions, . contracted by  
th:m to ſupport a very dangerous war, en-  
tered into for the intereſt and ſecurity of  
thoſe Colonies, would have redounded to the  
benefit of the Colonies themſelves in their  
  
  
which many of them have hitherto always  
borne, in guarding their frontiers againſt the  
ſavage Indians.  
  
SIXTHLY.  
  
Becauſe, not only the right, but the expe-  
diency and neceſſity of the ſupreme lægiſla-  
ture, exerting its autaority to lay a general  
  
tax  
  
[LS]  
  
tax on our American Colonies, whenever the  
wants of the public make it fitting and rea-  
ſonable, that ai the Provinces ſhould contri-  
bute in a proper proportion to the defence  
of the whole, appear to us undeniable, from  
theſe conſiderations : Firſt, That every Pro-  
vince being ſeparate and independant on the  
others, and having no Common Council im-  
powered by the conſtitution of the Colonies  
to act for all, or bind all, ſuch a tax can-  
not regularly, or without infinite difficul-  
ty, be impoſed upon them at any time,  
even for their immediate defence or pro-  
tection, by their own provincial aſſem-  
blies; but requires the intervention and ſu-  
perintending power of the Parliament of  
Great Britain. Secondly, That in looking  
forwards to the poſſible contingency of a  
new war, a contingency perhaps not far re-  
mote, the proſpect of the burthens which  
the gentry and people of this King-  
dom muſt then ſuſtain, in addition to thote,  
which now lie ſo heavy upon them, is ſo  
melancholy and dreadful, that we cannot  
but feel it, a moſt indiſpenſible duty to eaſe  
them as much as is poſſible, by a due and  
moderate exertion of that great right, which  
the conſtitution of this realm has veſted in  
the Parliament, to provide for the ſafety  
  
of all, by a proportionable charge upon all,  
equally and indifferently laid. We like-  
wiſe apprehend, that a partial exemption of  
| our  
  
1  
our Colonies from any exerciſe of this right  
by the Britiſh Legiſlature, would be thought  
fo invidious, and ſo unjuſt to the other ſub-  
jects of the Crown of Great Britain, as to  
alienate the hearts of theſe from their Coun-  
  
  
detriment of the latter, who have on many  
occaſions received, and may again want aſ-  
  
fiſtance, from the generous warmth of their  
affection.  
  
SEVENTHLY.  
  
Becauſe, the reaſons aſſigned in the public  
reſolutions of the Provincial Aſſemblies, in  
the North American Colonies, for their diſ-  
obeying the Stamp Act, viz. © That they are  
not repreſented in the Parliament of Great  
Britain,” extends to all other laws, of what  
nature ſoever, which that Parliament has  
enacted, or ſhall ena, to bind them in times  
to come, and mult (if admitted) ſet them abſo-  
lately free from any obedience to the power of  
the Britiſh Legiſlature; we likewiſe obſerve,  
that in a letter to Mr. Secretary Conway, dated  
the 12th of October 1765; the commander  
  
  
© the Queſtion is not of the inexpediency of  
*« the Stamp Act, or of the inability of the  
« Colonies to pay the Tax; but that it is  
* unconſtitutional and contrary to their  
  
« Rights,  
  
Wi 4.  
« Rights, ſupporting the independancy of  
* the Provinces, and not ſubject to the le-  
« giſlative power of Great Britain.“ It is  
moreover affirmed, in a letter to Mr. Con-  
way, dated 7th November * That the peo-  
« ple in general are averſe to Taxes of any-  
« kind; and that the merchants of that  
« place think they have a right to every  
freedom of trade which the ſubjects of  
« Great Britain now enjoy.” This opinion  
of theirs ſtrikes direQAly at the Act of Navi-  
gation, and other ſubſequent laws, which  
from time to time have been made in the  
wiſe policy of that Act; and ſhould they  
ever be encouraged to procure for themſelves  
that abſolute freedom of trade, which they  
appear to defire, our plantations would be-  
come, not only of no benefit, but in the  
higheſt degree prejudicial to the commerce  
and weltare of their Mother-country ; nor  
is it eaſy to conceive a greater encourage-  
ment, than the repealing of a law oppoſed  
by them on ſuch principles, and with fo  
  
much contempt of the Sovereignty of the  
Britiſh Legiſlature.

a manifeſt tendency to draw on further in-  
ſalts, and by leſſening the reſpect of all his  
Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects to the dignity of his Crown,  
and authority of his Laws, throw the  
whole Britiſh empire into a miſerable ſtate  
  
  
ſeems by many ſymptoms to be dangerouſly  
threatned; and this is the more to be feared,  
as the plea of our North American Colonies,  
that not being repreſented in the Parliament  
  
  
Taxes impoſed or levied upon them by the  
authority thereof, may by the ſame reaſon-  
ing be extended to all perſons in this Iſland,  
  
  
Parliament; nor can we help apprehending,  
  
  
given to ſuch notions by the Legiſlature it-  
ſelf, in conſenting to this Bill, for the Repeal  
of the Stamp Act, may greatly promote the  
cantagion of a moſt dangerous doctrine, de-  
ſtructive to all Government, which has ſpread  
itſelf over all our North American Colonies,  
that the obedience of the ſubject is not due  
to the Laws and Legiſlature of the Realm,  
farther than he in his private judgment ſhall  
think it conformable to the ideas he has  
  
  
NINT HL.  
  
E  
NINTHLY.  
  
Becauſe, we think it no effectual guard, or  
ſecurity againſt this danger, that the Parlia-  
ment has declared in the reſolutions of both  
Houſes, paſſed during this ſeſſion, and now  
reduced into a Bill, That ſuch notions are  
ill founded; as men will always look more  
to deeds than words, and may therefore in-  
cline to believe, that the inſurrections in our  
Colonies, excited by thoſe notions, having ſo  
far proved ſucceſsful, as to attain the very  
point, at which they aimed, the immediate  
repeal of the Stamp Act, without any pre-  
vious ſubmiſſion on the part of the Colonies;  
the Legiſlature has in fact ſubmitted to them,  
and has only more grievouſly injured its own  
dignity and authority, by verbally aſſerting  
that Right, which it ſubſtantially yields up  
to their Oppoſition. The reaſons affigned  
for this conceſſion render it ſtill more alarm-  
ing, as they ariſe from an illegal and hoſtile  
combination of the people of America, to  
diſtreſs and ſtarve our Manufacturers, and  
to with-hold from our Merchants the pay-  
ment of their juſt debts: the former of which  
meaſures has only been practiſed in open war  
between two States; and the latter, we be-  
lieve, not even in that fituation, either by  
the public or by individuals, among the ci-  
vilized nations of Europe, in modern times.  
  
It  
  
114  
  
If this unprecedented plan of intimidation  
ſhall meet with - ſuccels, it is eaſy to foreſee  
that the practice of it for other and till  
greater objects will frequently be renewed,  
and our manufacturers and merchants re-  
duced to the like, and more permanent diſ-  
treſs; we cannot therefore but with, that  
ſome more eligible method, conſiſtent with  
their future ſafety and our dignity, had been  
taken by Parliament, to ſhew our tender  
concern and compaſſion for their ſufferings,  
and to diſcourage any other ſuch unwarrantable  
attempts} which we are fully perſuaded  
would have been very practicable, with due  
care and attention, and at an expence very  
inferior to the importance of the object.  
  
LASTLY.  
  
Becauſe, we are convinced from the una-  
nimous teſtimony of the Governors, and other  
officers of the Crown in America, that if, by  
a moſt unhappy delay and neglect to pro-  
vide for the due execution of the law, and  
arming the Government there with proper  
orders and powers, repeatedly called for in  
vain, theſe diſturbances had not been con-  
tinued and encreaſed, they might eaſily have  
been quieted before they had attained to any  
dangerous height; and we cannot, without  
feeling the moſt lively ſenſe of grief and in-  
dignation, hear arguments drawa from the  
  
| | progreſs  
  
18  
  
progreſs of evils, which ſhould and might  
have been ſtopped in their firſt and feeble  
beginnings, uſed for the ſtill greater evil of  
ſacrificing to a preſent relief the higheſt per-  
manent intereſts, and the whole Majeſty,  
Power, and Reputation of Government: This  
afflicts us the more deeply, becauſe it appears  
from many letters, that this law, if properly  
ſupported by Government, would from the  
peculiar circumſtances attending the diſobe-  
dience to it, execute itſelf without blood-  
ſhed. And it is faid in one of the letters to  
Mr. Secretary Conway, . That the principal  
view is to intimidate the Parliament; but  
* that if it be thought prudent to enforce  
* their authority, the people dare not op-  
* poſe a vigorous reſolution of the Parlia-  
«© ment of Great Britain.” That vigorous  
reſolution has not yet been found in the Par-  
liament; and we greatly fear, that the want  
of it will certainly produce one of theſe two  
fatal conſequences ; either that the repeal of  
this law will in effe&amp; annull and abrogate all  
other laws and ſtatutes relating to our Co-  
lonies, and particularly the Acts that reſtrain  
or limit their Commerce, of which they are  
moſt impatient; or, if we ſhould hereafter  
attempt to enforce the execution of. thoſe  
laws againſt their will, and by virtue of an  
authority, which they have dared to inſult  
with impunity and ſucceſs, that endeavour  
will bring upon us all thoſe evils and incon-  
veniences,  
  
C  
  
veniences, to the fear of which we now ſa⸗  
  
crifice the Sovereignty of the Realm; and this  
  
at a time when the ſtrength of our Colonies,  
  
as well as their deſire of a total independance  
  
| on the Legiſtature and Government of their  
; Mother-country, may be greatly augmented,  
: and when the circumſtances and diſpoſitions  
of the other powers of Europe, may render  
  
p the conteſt far more dangerous and formi-  
  
{| dable to this Kingdom.

trom ſundry Acts of Parliament, that a ju-  
riſdiction has been aſſigned to the Judges of  
thoſe Courts, for the recovery of penalties  
upon the Laws of Revenue and of Trade,  
without Juries for near a century paſt, from  
the conſideration (as we apprehend) that in  
ſome of the colonies they are the only Judges  
not elected by the people: and fo far it is  
from being true, that the Subjects in North  
Sp A 3 America,  
  
  
1-8-1  
  
America, by being deprived in theſe Caſes  
of Trials by Juries, were in that reſpect diſ-  
tinguiſhed from their Fellow- ſubjects in  
Great Britain; that, in this very inſtance  
of the Stamp Duties, the Penalties, which  
by the American Stamp Act were made re-  
coverable without a Jury before a Judge of  
aws  
  
now in force for collecting the Stamp Du-  
ties in Great Britain, recoverable alſa without  
a Jury, before two Juſtices of the Peace,

venue in America than in Great Britain ; and  
which we ſhould be moſt deſirous, if poſſi-

opened and approved in Parliament, at the  
time when the Stamp Act was propoſed ;  
and as the total neglect of it has given occa-  
fiorr to great Clamour and Diffattsfation in  
the Colonies. We cannot help further ob-  
ſerving, that as the Stamp Act was not to  
take place till the iſt of November, if the  
Parliament had been called early, their de-  
terminations, either for enforcing or repeal-  
ing that Law, would probably have deliver-  
ed the Merchants and Manufacturers here  
from all the difficulties and diſtreſs to which  
they have been for ſo many months expoſed ;

THIRDLY.  
  
Becauſe, . the Argument which has been.  
uſed in favour of this Bill of Repeal, that  
the experiment of the Stamp Act has been  
tried, and has failed, is extremely ill found-  
ed; as it manifeſtly appears from the whole  
tenor of the Papers laid before us, that if  
this experiment had been properly tried, with  
the ſame zeal, for its ſucceſs with which it  
was firſt propoſed, it would not have failed  
in any of the Colonies: and that this was  
the opinion of the greater part of the Go-  
vernors in North America, and of many of  
the moſt intelligent and reſpectable perſons  
in thoſe provinces, for ſome time after this  
Act was paſſed, is evident beyond a doubt,  
from the Letters of the former now upon  
our Table, and from the latter having ap-  
plied for, and accepted the Office of Diſtri-  
butor of the Stamps under that Act, which  
they certainly would not have done, and  
thereby have expoſed their Lives and For-  
tunes to the violence and outrages which the  
have ſince undergone, if they had .then  
thought the ſucceſs of this meaſure in any  
degree precarious : nor have we heard of any  
impracticability attending this Law in Ja-  
maica and Barbadoes, and ſome other of the

” Wai 4 a 8 of the two Houſes of  
Parliament lending their power, from mo-  
tives of Fear or Impatience under a preſent  
uncaſineſs, to overturn in one month a Plan  
of Meaſures, undertaken with their warm-  
eſt Approbation and Concurrence, after the  
moft mature deliberation of two years toge-  
ther, for the improvement of our Reve-  
nue, and the relief of our People, will ef-

the Malice of Faction; which muſt neceſ-

our interpoſition, for many obvious Rea-  
ſons, would be peculiarly proper; we in ef-  
fect annihilate this branch of the Legiſlature,  
and vote ourſelves uſeleſs. Or if by paſſing

America, and even in Great Britain, have  
treated a ſeries of Britiſh Acts. of Parlia-

PROT. 111. Page 14. ¢ Because weare con­  
vinced from the unanimous Testimony of the  
  
overnors, and other Officers of the Crown in  
America, that if, by a most unhappy Delay and  
Negleét to provide for the due Execution of the  
Law, and arming the Government there with  
proper Orders and Powers, repeatedly called for  
in vain, these Disturbances had not been con­  
tinued and encreafed, they might cafily have been  
quieted before they had attained to any dangerous  
Height ;ad we cannot, without feeling the  
most lively Sense of Grief and Indignation, hear  
Arguments drawn from the Progres of Lvils,  
which should and mi-it have been {topped in  
their firft and feeble Beginnings, used for the still  
greater Evil of facrificing to a present Relief the  
highest permanent Interelts, and the whole Ma­  
jesty, power and reputation of government ; this  
affli&amp;ts us the moredeeply, because it appears from  
many letters, that this Law, if properly supported  
by government, would from the peculiar cticum­  
ftances -attending the disobedience to it, execute  
itfelf without bloodshed. = And it is said in one of  
the letters to Mr. Secretary C--w--y, ¢ &quot;I&#x27;hat the  
¢ principal view is to intimidate the parliament ;  
““ but that if it be thought prudent to enforce  
‘¢ their Authority, the peoplg dare not oppose a  
¢ vigorous resolution of the patliament of Great­  
¢¢ Britain.”  
L PR OT-EST HE Pyoe 3.  
¢ Thirdly, Because the Argument which has  
been used in Favor of this Bill of Repeal, that the  
Experiment of the Stamp-A&amp; has been tried,and  
has failed, is extremely ill founded ; as it mani­  
feftly appears from the whole Tenor of the Papers  
laid before us, that if this Experiment had been  
properly tried with the fame Zeal for its Success,  
with which it-was firft proposed, it would nor  
have failed in any of the Colonies : And that  
this was the Opinion of the greater part of  
the Governors in North-Arherica, and of many  
of the most intelligent and respectable Persons in  
those Provinces, for some Time after the A&amp; was  
pafled, is evident beyond a doubt fiom the Letters  
of the former now upon ocur Table and from the  
latter having applyed for, and accepted the Office  
of Distributor of the Stamps under that AQ,  
which they certainly would not have done, and  
thereby have exposed their Lives and Fortunes to  
the Violence and Outrages which they have since  
undergone, if they had then tho’t the Succels of  
this Measure in any Degree precarious : Nor  
have we heard of any Impra&amp;icability attending  
this law in Jamaica and Barbados, and some other  
of the Weft-India Islands, or in those of our C­  
olonies in North- America, where it has been ex­

tremely ill founded ; as it manifeftly ap-  
pears, fromthe whole tenor of the pa-  
pers laid before us, that if this experi-  
ment had beén properly tried, with the  
fame zeal for its fuccefs with which it was  
firft propofed, it would not have failed  
in any of the colonies : and that this was  
the opinion of the greater part f the go-  
vernors in North America, and of tnany  
of the moft&#x27; intelligefit atid refpectable  
perfons in thofe ptovinces, for fome time  
after. this aét was paffed, is evident, be-  
yond a doubt, from the letters of the for-  
mer, now upon our table, and from the  
latter havin  
the office o ributors of the ftamps  
under that act, which they certainly  
would not have done, and thereby have  
expofed their lives and fortunes to the  
violence and outrages which they have  
fince undergone, if they had then thought

our colonies in North-America, where it

one month, a plan of meafures under-  
taken with their warmeft approbation  
and concurrence, after the moft mature  
deliberation of two years together, for  
the improvement of our revenue, and  
the relief of our people, will effettually  
difcourage all officers of the crown in

is enough to deter future minifters, in

our dpinién, from the threats and com-

difclaim that legiflative authority over

able to maintain.. If we give our con-  
fent to it Here, without a full convittion  
merely becaufe it has  
paffed the other Hoult, by declining to  
do ot duty oti the moft jmportant oc-  
cafion which can. ever prefent itfelf, and  
where éur interpofition, for many ob-  
vious reafons, would be penta’ pro-  
per, we, in effect, annihilate this branch  
of the legiflature, and vote ourfelves ufe-  
  
Or, if by — this bill, we  
mean to juftify thofe who in America,  
and even in Great Britain, have treated  
a feries of ‘Britifh acts of parliament as  
fo many atts of tyranny and oppreffior,  
which it is fcarcely criminal to refit ; or  
thofe officers of the crown, who, under  
the eye, and with the knowledge of go:  
vernrient, have taken upon themfelves,  
whilft the parliament was fitting, with-  
outits confent, to fufpend the execution  
of the ftamp ad, by admitting thips from  
the colonies, with cattalypeds clearances,  
to an entry, in direct violation: of it,  
which, from the papers upon our table,  
appears to have been done; we fhall  
  
E then give our approbation to an open  
  
breach of the firft article of that great  
palladium of. our liberties, the bill of

‘* the pretended power of fufpending of

‘¢ regal authority, without confent of

aes our proceedings upon the  
opinion of thofe who have contended in  
this houfé, that from the conttitution of  
our colonies they ought never to be  
taxed, even for their own immediate de-  
fence, we fear that fuch a declaration,  
by which near a fifth part of the {ub-

of parliament to reftrain the prefling of  
feamen in America, are already ex-  
empted from furnifhing men to our navy,  
are to be for ever exempted from contri-  
buting their fhare towards their own fup-

flagrant partizlity and injuftice of it,

pudiated by the American people whenever  
  
it has been attempted to be enforced. As  
  
proof of tho fact, we call attention to the  
following record which wc find in tho Day­  
ton Empire:  
The Britih Parliament contended for the  
absolute power (or, in the words of the Repub­  
lican platform, its &quot;sovereign power&quot;; over the  
inhabitants of the British Territories and in  
11 arch, 17CC, the following declaratory resolu­  
tion passed the House of Commons, the House  
of Lords, and received the royal signature:  
&quot;Reiohed, That the King&#x27;s Majesty, by and  
with the advice aud consent of lords spiritual  
and lords temporal, and commons of Great  
Britain, in parliament assembled, had, hath  
and of right ought to have full power and  
authority to make laws aud statutes of sufficient  
force and validity to bind the colonies and  
people of America, subjects of the crown of  
Great Britain, in all fates whatsoever.&quot;  
This Was the English Tory doctrine directly  
antagonistic to the principles laid down by OUT  
ancestors. Now compare this doctriue with the  
third resolution of the Republican platform,  
the chief plank iu it. It reads:  
&quot;llesolccd, That the Constitution confers  
upon Coueress sovereign power over the terri  
  
tories of the United States for their government,  
and that in the exercise of this power, it is
