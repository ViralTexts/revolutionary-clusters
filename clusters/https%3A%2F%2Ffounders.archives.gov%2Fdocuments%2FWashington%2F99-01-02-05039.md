The next &amp; I believe the last thing I shall have time to touch upon is our Military establishment. and here if I thought my conviction of having a permanent force had not—ere this—flashed upon every mans Mind I could write a volume in support of the  
utility of it; for no day, nor hour arrives unaccompd with news of some loss—some expence—or some misfortune consequent of the want of it. No operation of War offensive or defensive can be carried on, for any length of time without it—No funds are adequate to the supplies of  
a fluctuating army—tho’ it may go under the denomination of a regular one—much less are they competent to the support of Militia—In a word, for it is, unnecessary to go into all the reasons the subject will admit of, we have brought a cause which might have been happily  
terminated years ago by the adoption of proper measures to the verge of Ruin by temporary enlistments &amp; a reliance on Militia—The sums expended in bounties—waste of Arms—consumption of Military Stores—Provisions—Camp Utensils &amp;ca—to say nothing of Cloathing which  
temporary Soldiers are always receiving, &amp; always in want of—are too great for the resources of any nation; &amp; prove the fallacy &amp; danger of temporary expedients which are no more than Mushrooms and of as short duration, but leave a sting (that is a debt which is  
continually revolving upon us) behind them.  
It must be a settled plan, founded in system, order &amp; œconomy that is to carry us triumphantly through the War. Supiness, &amp; indifference to the distresses &amp; cries of a sister State when danger is far of—and a general but momentary resort to Arms  
when it comes to our doors, are equally impolitic &amp; dangerous, and prove the necessity of a controuling power in Congress to regulate and direct all matters of general concern—without it the great business of War never can be conducted at  
all—While the powers of congress are only recommendatory—while one State yields obedience, &amp; another refuses it—while a third mutilates &amp; adopts the measure in part only—&amp; all vary in time &amp; manner it is scarcely possible our Affairs should prosper, or that  
anything but disappointmt can follow the best concerted plan—the willing States are almost ruined by their exertions—distrust &amp; jealousy succeeds to it—hence proceed neglects &amp; ill-timed compliances (one State waiting to see what another will do)—this thwarts all our  
measures after a heavy tho’ ineffectual expence is incurred.  
Does not these things shew then in the most striking point of view the indispensable necessity—the great and good policy, of each State’s sending its ablest &amp; best men to Congress? Men who have a perfect understanding of the constitution of their  
Country—of its policy &amp; Interests—And of vesting that body with competent powers. Our Independance depends upon it—our respectability &amp; consequence in Europe depends upon it—our greatness as a Nation, hereafter, depends upon it. the fear of giving sufficient powers to  
Congress for the purposes I have mentioned is futile, without it, our Independence fails, &amp; each Assembly under its present Constitution will be annihilated and we must once more return to the Government of G: Britain—&amp; be made to Kiss the rod preparing for our  
correction—a nominal head, which at present is but another name for Congress, will no longer do—That honble body, after hearing the interests &amp; views of the several States fairly discussed &amp; explained by their respective representatives, must dictate, not merely  
recommend, and leave it to the States afterwards to do as they please—which, as I have observed before, is in many cases, to do nothing at all.

In 1781, in a letter to Mr. Custis, he writes :—*&lt;If I  
thought the conviction of the necessity of having a per-  
manent force, had not, ere this, flashed upon every man’s  
mind, [ could write a volume in support of the utility of  
it; for no day or hour arrives unaccompanied with proof  
of some loss, some expense, or some misfortune conse-  
quent on the want of it. No operation of war, offensive  
or defensive, can be carried on for any length of time  
without it. No funds are adequate to the supplies of a  
fluctuating army, though it may go under the denomina-  
tion of a regular one, much less are they competent to  
the support of militia. In a word, for it is unnecessary  
to go into all the reasons the subject will admit of, we  
have brought a cause, which might have been happily  
terminated years ago, by the adoption of proper mea-  
sures, to the verge of ruin by temporary enlistments and  
a reliance on militia. The sums expended in bounties,  
waste of arms, consumption ef military stores, provi-  
sions and camp utensils, to say nothing of clothing which  
temporary soldiers are always receiving, and always in
