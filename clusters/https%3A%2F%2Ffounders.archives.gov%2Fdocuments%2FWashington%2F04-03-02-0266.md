.  
The War, as you have very justly observed, has terminated most advantageously for America—and a large &amp; glorious field is presented to our view. But I confess to you, my dear Sir, that I do not think we possess wisdom, or justice enough to cultivate it properly. Illiberality, Jealousy, &amp; local policy mix too much in all our public Councils for the good government of the Union. In a word, the Confederation appears to me to be little more than an empty sound, and Congress a nugatory body; the ordinances of it being very little attended to.  
To me, it is a solecism in politics, indeed it is one of the most extraordinary things in nature, that we should Confederate for National purposes, and yet be affraid to give the rulers thereof who are the Creatures of our own making—appointed for a limited and short duration—who are amenable for every action—recallable at any moment—and subject to all the evils they may be instrumental in producing, sufficient powers to order &amp; direct the affairs of that Nation.  
By such policy as this the wheels of government are clogged; &amp; our brightest prospects, and that high expectation which was entertained of us by the wondering world, is turned into astonishment. and from the high ground on which we stood we are descending into the Valleys of confusion &amp; darkness. That we have it in our power to be one of the most respectable Nations upon Earth, admits not, in my humble opinion, of a doubt, if we would pursue a wise, Just, &amp; liberal policy towards one another—and would keep good faith with the rest of the World. That our resources are ample, &amp; encreasing, none can deny; But whilst they are grudgingly applied, or not applied at all, we give the vital stab to public credit, and must sink into contempt in the eyes of Europe.  
It has long been a speculative question amongst Philosophers and wise men, whether foreign Commerce is of advantage to any Country—that is, whether the luxury, effeminacy, &amp; corruption which are introduced by it, are counterbalanced by the conveniencies and wealth of which it is productive. But the right decision of this question is of very little importance to us. We have abundant reason to be convinced, that the spirit of Trade  
  
which pervades these States is not to be restrained. it behoves us therefore to establish it upon just principles; and this, any more than other matters of national concern cannot be done by thirteen heads, differently constructed; The necessity therefore of a controuling power is obvious, and why it should be with-held is beyond comprehension.
