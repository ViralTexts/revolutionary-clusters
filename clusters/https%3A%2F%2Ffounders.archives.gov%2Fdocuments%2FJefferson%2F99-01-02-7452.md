rd them to Monticello in the way I shall advise him: and I must intreat you to send me either a note of their amount, or the bills that I may be enabled to reimburse you. there can be no pecuniary matter between us against which this can be any set-off. but if, contrary to my recollection or knolege, there were any thing, I pray that that may be left to be settled by itself. if I could have known the amount before hand I should have remitted it, and asked the advance only under the idea that it should be the same as ready money to you on your arrival.

My Dear Sir,  
******  
I see with infinite grief a contest n­  
rising between yourself and another  
who have been very dear to each other,  
md equally so to me* I sincerely  
pray that these dispositions may not be  
iffected between you: with me I con­  
fnlently trust they will not; for inde­  
pendently of the dictates of public du­  
ty which prescribe neutrality to me, mv  
sincere frienship tor you both will in­  
sure its sacred observance* I suffer no  
&gt;ne to converse with me on the subject.  
I already perceive my friend Clinton  
estranging himself from me. No doubt  
lies are carried to him, as they will he  
to the other two candidates, under  
forms which, however false, he can  
scarcely question. Yet I have been e­  
quallv careful as to him also never  
to sav a word on this subject. The ob­  
ject of the contest is a fair and hono­  
rable one, equally open to you all, and  
l have no doubt the personal conduct  
if each will he so chaste as to offer no  
ground of dissatisfaction with each o­  
lier. but vnnr f riends will not he as  
  
delicate. I know too well from expe­  
rt nee the progress of political contro­  
versy, and the exacerbation of spit it  
into which it degenerates, not to fear  
for the continu nice of vour mutual es­  
teem. Oae piquing thing said, draws  
on another, that a third, and al\va\ s  
with increasing acrimony, until nil  
restraint is thrown off, and it becomes  
&#x27;difficult for yourselves to keep-clear of  
tite toils in which vour triends will en­  
deavor to interlace you, and to avoid  
the participation in their passions  
which they will endeavor to produce.  
A Candid recollection of what voy  
know ot each other will be the true  
corrective. With respect to mystic I  
hope they will spare me. .My long­  
ings for retirement are so strong that  
I with difficulty encounter the daily  
drudgeries of my duty. But my wish  
for retirement itself is not stronger  
than that of carrying into it the airet­  
tions of all rav friends. I have ever  
viewed Mr. Madison and yourself as  
two principal pillars of my happiness.  
Were either to lie withdrawn, i should  
cons&#x27;der it as among the greatest cala­  
mities which could assail my future  
peace of mind. I have great confi­  
dence that the candor and high under­  
standing of both will guard me against  
| tin&#x27;s misfortune, the bare possibility ol  
| which has so far weighed on my mind  
| that I could not be easy without un­
