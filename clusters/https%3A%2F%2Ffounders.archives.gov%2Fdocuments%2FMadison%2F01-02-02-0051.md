ern boundary of Pennsylvania to the Mississippi, Virginia claimed all, and New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut claimed some, of the area. The alleged legality of Virginia’s title stemmed from the charter of King James I in 1609 to the London Company, granting that corporation two hundred miles north and south of Cape Comfort along the Atlantic Coast and “up into the Land, throughout from Sea to Sea, West, and Northwest.” Although this territory had been given to a company and not to its colony, although the charter had been rescinded by the Court of the King’s Bench in 1624, although later sovereigns by grants to other proprietors had encroached upon the seaboard frontage of Virginia, and although that colony made no vigorous protest on the strength of “its” old charter when Parliament in 1774 extended the southern limits of the Province of Quebec to t

ssion in the Continental Congress—(a) upon what terms a legal union of the states might be created; and (b) upon what terms patriots might be induced to enlist in the army for the duration of the war. In harmony with the sovereignty of each state, the Articles of Confederation provided not only that it would not go into effect until every state had ratified it (Preamble and Art. XIII) but also that “no State shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States” (Art. IX). The latter guarantee was included upon the insistence of the delegates from “the landed” states and over the opposition of those from Maryland and other “landless” states. In September 1776 Congress passed the first of several acts promising bounties in land to men who would enlist in the “continental line” for the duration of the war. H

. The following day the Maryland delegates countered by making known the mandate from their state assembly forbidding them to sign the Articles until an amendment was added granting Congress discretionary power to create “free, convenient and independent governments” in the “common property” won “by the blood and treasure of the thirteen states” (ibid., XIV, 619–22). A month later the Virginia legislature, led by George Mason, took a similarly uncompromising stand by creating a land office to issue warrants for, and to sell, the state’s “waste and unappropriated lands” (Hening, StatutesWilliam Waller Hening, ed., The Statutes at Large; being a

northern half of the province, Virginia laid claim to a large portion of the  
western part. The origin of this claim dates very far back in the history  
of the country.  
  
The charter of 1607 granted to the London Company all the territory  
in America lying between the 34th and 38th degrees of north latitude.*  
In 1609 the charter was amended and enlarged, so that it comprised a re-  
gion stretching two hundred miles north and the same distance south of  
Point Comfort, and extending “up into the land throughout, from sea to  
sea, west and northwest.” In 1623 the London Company was dissolved  
by a decree of the King’s Bench, and the territory above described, except  
where grants had been made to private individuals, reverted to the Crown.  
But the Virginians never fully: accepted this decision. Penn’s grant was  
respected ; but any other territory within the limits of their charter they  
continued to claim, notwithstanding the action of the King’s Bench. To  
explore and occupy this vast domain was one of the most fascinating ob-  
jects to the early Virginians.t It was to vindicate their claim to the valley  
of the Ohio that the youth
