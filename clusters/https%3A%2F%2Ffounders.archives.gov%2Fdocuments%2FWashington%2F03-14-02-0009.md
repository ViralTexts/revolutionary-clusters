r Sir,  
Head Qrs Valley-forge Mar. 1st 1778.  
  
Your favor of the 8th of Decr came safe to my hands—after considerable delay in its passage.  
The Sentiments you have expressed of me in this Letter are highly flattering—meriting my warmest acknowledgements, as I have too good an opinion of your sincerity and candour, to believe that you are capable of unmeaning professions—&amp; speaking a language foreign from your heart—The friendship I ever professed, &amp; felt for you, met with no diminution from the difference in our political sentiments—I knew the rectitude of my own intentions &amp; believing in the sincerity of yours, lamented, though I did not condemn, your renunciation of the creed I had adopted—nor do I think any person, or power ought to do it whilst your conduct is not opposed to the general Interest of the People, &amp; the measures they are pursuing—The latter, that is our actions, depending on ourselves may be controuled, while the powers of thinking originating from higher causes, cannot always be moulded to our wishes.  
The determinations of Providence are always wise—often inscrutable—and, thô its decrees appear to bear hard upon us at times, is, nevertheless meant for gracious purposes—In this light I cannot help viewing your late disappointment; for if you had been permitted to have gone to England, unrestrained even by the rigid Oaths which are administred upon those occasions, your feelings as a husband, parent, &amp;ca must have been considerably wounded in the prospect of a long—perhaps lasting seperation from your nearest relatives—what then must they have been if the obligation of an Oath had left you without a Will?  
Your hope of being instrumental in restoring peace, would prove as unsubstantial as mist before a Noon day Sun; and would as soon dispel;  
  
for believe me Sir, G. Britain understood herself perfectly well in this dispute, but did not comprehend America—She meant as Lord Cambden in his late speech in Parliament clearly, &amp; explicitly declares, to drive America into rebellion, that her own purposes might be more fully answered by it; but take this along with it, that this plan originating in a firm belief founded on mis-information, that no effectual opposition would, or could be made, they little dreamt of what has happened, and are disappointed in their views.  
Does not every act of Administration from the Tea act to the present Sessions of Parliament declare this in plain &amp; selfevident characters? Had the Commissioners any powers to treat with America? If they meant peace, would Lord Howe have been detained in England five Months after passing the Act? Would the powers of these Commissioners have been confined to mere acts of grace upon condition of absolute submission? No—surely No! they meant to drive us into what they termed rebellion, that they might be furnished with a pretext to disarm, and then strip us of the rights &amp; previledges of Englishmen—If they were actuated by principles of Justice, why did they refuse, indignantly to accede to the terms which were humbly supplicated before hostilities commenced, and this Country deluged in blood, &amp; now make their principal officers, and even the Commissioners themselves, say that these terms are just &amp; reasonable; nay, that more will be granted than we have yet asked, if we will relinquish our claim to Independancy—what name does such conduct as this deserve? and what punishment is there in store for the Men who have distressed Millions—Involved thousands in ruin—and plunged numberless families in inextricable woe! Could that which is just &amp; reasonable now have been unjust four years ago? If not, upon what principles I repeat, does Administration act? they must either be wantonly wicked &amp; cruel or (which is only another mode of expressing the same thing) under false colours are now endeavouring to deceive the great body of the People by industriously propagating an Idea, that G. Britain is willing to offer any, &amp; that we will accept of no terms; thereby hoping to poison, &amp; disaffect the minds of those who wish for Peace, &amp; create feuds and dissentions in consequence—In a word, having less dependance now on their Arms than their Arts, they are practicing such low, &amp; dirty tricks, that Men of Sentiment and honor must blush for their fall. among other manœuvres in this way, they are forging Letters and publishing them as intercepted ones of mine, to prove that I am an enemy to the present measures of this Continent; having been deceived, &amp; led on by Congress in hopes that at length, they would recede from their claims &amp; withdraw their opposition to G. Britain.  
I am sorry to hear of the indispositio

Valley Firgc, March 1, 1778.  
Dxak Sin,  
Your favor of the dlh of L)e­  
eember came safe to my ha,ids, af­  
ter considerable delay in its passage,  
• sentiments you have express­  
ed of mc in this letter arc highh  
—meriting my warmest ac­  
knowle.t;ements, as I iuivp too good  
an opinion oi your sincerity and can­  
dor, io believe that you are capable of  
unmeaning professions, ar.d speaking  
a language foreign front your heart ;  
the IVi.&#x27;ie L;cd, and  
felt &#x27; liminution  
  
&#x27; from the difference in our political  
. sentiments. I knew the rectitude of  
my own intentions ar.d believing in  
he sincerity of yours, lamented, tho&#x27; &#x27;  
I did not condemn, your renunciation  
•f the creed I had adopted. Nor do  
I think any person, or power ought  
to do it whilst your conduct is not  
opposed to ihe general interests of i  
the people, and the measures they  
are pursuing. The latter,that i  
actions, depending on ourse  
be controled, while the power  
thinking originating from 1 i  
causes, cannot always he moulded lv  
our wishes.  
The determinations of Providence  
ar? always wise—.often ii scrutablc— j  
and, though its decrees appear to  
hear hard upon us at times, is, ne  
j vert he Jess meant for gracious pur­  
. poses. In this light I cannot help  
: viewing yqur late disappointment ;  
i for if you hod been permitted to •  
&#x27;gone to England, unrestrained even  
by the rigid oaths which are adrninis  
tered upon iiiosc occasions, your  
feeling&#x27;s as a husband, parent, tkc  
must have been considerably wounded  
in the prospect ofa long, perhaps last  
ii.;&gt;; separation from your nearest re  
lathes—what then must they have  
been if the obligation of an oalh  
had left you without ;&gt; will ?  
Your hope of being instrumental  
in restoring peace would prove as  
.bstanliul aa mist before ft noon­  
day sun ; and would as soon dispi I ;  
for believe me, sir, Great Britain un­  
derstood herself perfectly well in this  
dispute, but did not comprehend ;  
America. She meant, asLord Camb*  
den in his hue speech In Parliament) j  
clear&#x27;}&#x27; and explicitly declare-, to j  
drive A.v.erica into rchehion, that her  
own purposes might he more fully  
answered hy it ; but take this along  
with it, that this plan originatingin  
a firm belief founded on misinforma­  
tion, thai no effectual opposition would  
or could he made ; ihey little dreamt  
of what Ins happened, and are disap­  
&#x27; pointed in their views.  
Decs not every act of c.dniir.is;  
tion from tlie tea act to the present  
sessions of Parliament declare this  
in plain and self-evident characters ?  
Had the commissioners any powers  
to treat with America ? If they  
meant peace, wen&#x27;:! Lord Howe have  
her, detained in England fiver,or-.ths  
alter passing the act ? Would the  
powers of these Commissioners have  
been confined to mere acts of grace  
upon condition of absolute submis­  
sion ? No. Surely no i They in  
to draw us into what they lerraed re­  
bellion, that they might he funished  
with a pretext to disarm, and then  
Btrip US ofthe rights and privileges of  
Englishmen. If they were actuat­  
ed by principles of justice, why did  
ihey refuse, indignantly, to ccede io  
ihe terms which we humbly suppli­  
cated before hostilities commenced,  
•and this country deluged in blood,  
now make thci- pri cipa! officers,  
and even the commissioners them­  
selves, say that thi ore just  
and reasonable; nay, that more will  
granted than we have yet asked, if we  
will relinquish our ii depen­  
dency What name does such com  
as this deserve} AndwhfM punishment  
is there in store tor the men who have  
distressed millions—lnvolved them­  
;hi ruin—and plunged number*  
families in inexuical Ie woe !—  
C »uld that which is jre-t and reasona­  
ble now, have been m just four)  
ago I If not, upon what principles  
I repeat, docs administration act ?  
They mull either he wantonly Wicked  
and cruel, or (which is only another  
mode of expressing the same thing)  
under false calors arc now endeavor­  
ing to deceive the great body of the  
people hy industriously propagai  
an idea, thai Great Britain is willing  
•o offer -.iiv. and that we will accept  
of no terms ; thereby hoping lo poi­  
son, and disnffe-ct the minds of those  
who wish for peace, and create feuds  
| and dlasentions m consequence—in a  
i word, having less dependence now on  
their arms than their arts, they arc  
practising such low k dirty tricks, that  
men of sentiment and honor must  
blush for their fall. Among other  
m ■ ,sures in this way, they arc forging  
letters and publishing them as inter­  
cepted ones of mine, to prove that

deceived, and led on by Congress in
