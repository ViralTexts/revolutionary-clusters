Copy of a letter from B. Franklin, Esq. to R. Oswald, Esq. dated 1782.  
Sir—You may well remember, that in the beginning of our conferences, before the other commissioners arrived, on your mentioning to me a retribution for the loyalists whose estates had been forfeited, I acquainted you that nothing of that kind could be stipulated by us—the confiscations being made by virtue of laws of particular states, which the congress had no power to contravene or dispense with, and therefore could give us no such authority in our commission.—And I gave it as my opinion and advice, honestly and cordially, that if a reconciliation was intended, no mention should be made in our negotiations of those people, for they having done infinite mischief to our properties by wantonly burning and destroying farm-houses, villages, and towns; if compensation for their losses were insisted on, we should certainly exhibit against it an account of all the ravages they had committed, which would necessarily recal to view scenes of barbarity that must inflame instead of conciliating, and tend to perpetuate an enmity that we all profess a desire of extinguishing.—Understanding however from you, that this was a point your ministry had at heart, I wrote concerning it to congress, and have lately received the following resolutions, viz.  
By the United States in congress assembled, Sept. 10, 1782.  
Resolved—That the secretary of foreign affairs be and he is hereby directed to obtain, as speedily as possible, authentic returns of the slaves and other property, which have been carried off or destroyed in the course of the war by the enemy, and to transmit the same to the minister plenipotentiary for negotiating a peace.  
Resolved—That in the mean time the secretary for foreign affairs inform the said ministers that many thousands of slaves and other property to a very great amount, have been carried off or destroyed by the enemy; and that in the opinion of congress, the great loss of property which the citizens of the United States have sustained by the enemy, will be considered by the several states, as an insuperable bar to their making restitution or indemnification to the former owners of property which has been, or may be forfeited to, or confiscated by any of the states.  
In consequence of these resolutions, and the circular Letters of the Secretary, the assembly of Pennsylvania then sitting, passed the following Act, viz.  
The State of Pennsylvania in the General Assembly:  
Wednesday, Sept. 18, 1782.  
The Bill entitled an Act for procuring an estimate of the damages sustained by the inhabitants of Pennsylvania, from the troops and adherents of the king of Great Britain, during the present war,

ght to the nations of Europe, the conduct of the said King, his ministers, officers, and adherents; to the end, therefore, that proper measures be taken to ascertain the damages aforesaid, which have been done to the citizens and inhabitants of Pennsylvania, in the course of the present war, with this State.

f the proper county.”  
We have not yet had time to hear what has been done by the other assemblies—but I have no doubt that similar acts will be made by all of them—and that the mass of evidence produced by the execution of those acts, not only of the enormities committed by those people under the direction of British generals, but of those committed by the British troops themselves, will form a record that must render the British name odious in America to the latest generations—In that authentic record will be found the burning of the fine towns of Charlestown near Boston; of Falmouth, just before winter, when the sick, the aged, the women and children, were driven to seek shelter where they could hardly find it; of Norfolk, in the midst of winter; of New London; of Fairfield; of Esopus; &amp;c. &amp;c. besides near a hundred and fifty miles of well settled country laid waste, every house and barn burned, and many hundreds of farmers with their wives and children, butchered and scalped.  
  
The present British ministers, when they reflect a little, will certainly be too equitable to suppose that their nation has a right to make an unjust war, which they have always allowed this against us to be, and to do all sorts of unnecessary mischief, unjustifiable by the practice of any civilized people; which those they make war with are to suffer without claiming any satisfaction; but that if Britons or other adherents are in return deprived of any property, it is to be restored to them, or they are to be indemnified! The British troops can never excuse their barbarities. They were unprovoked. The loyalists may say in excuse of theirs, that they were exasperated by the loss of their estates, and it was revenge. They have then had their revenge. Is it right they should have both?  
Some of those people may have merit with regard to Britain. Those who espoused her cause from affection. These it may become you to reward. But there are many of them who were waverers, and were only determined to engage in it by some occasional circumstances or appearances. These have not much of either merit or demerit—And there are others who have abundance of demerit, respecting your country, having by their falsehoods and misrepresentations, brought on and encouraged the continuance of the war. These instead of being recompensed should be punished.  
  
It is usual among   christian people at war, to profess always a desire of peace. But if the ministers of one of the parties choose to insist particularly on a certain article, which they know the others are not, and cannot be impowered to agree to, what credit can they expect should be given to such professions?  
  
Your ministers require that we should receive again into our bosoms, those who have been our bitterest enemies, and restore their properties who have destroyed ours; and this while the wounds they have given us are still bleeding. It is many years since your nation expelled the Stuarts and their adherents, and confiscated their estates: much of your resentment against them may by this time be abated. Yet if we should insist on, and propose it as an article of our treaty with you, that that family should be recalled, and the forfeited estates of its friends restored, would you think us serious in our professions of earnestly desiring peace?  
  
I must repeat my opinion, that it is best for you to drop all mention of the refugees. We have proposed indeed nothing but what we think best for you, as well as ourselves. But if you will have them mentioned, let it be in an article which may provide, that they shall exhibit accounts of their losses, to commissioners hereafter to be appointed, who shall examine the same, together with the accounts now preparing in America, of the damages done by them, and state the account—and that if a balance appears in their favor, it shall be paid by us to you, and by you divided among them as you shall think proper; and if the balance is found due to us, it shall be paid by you.  
  
Give me leave however to advise you to prevent the necessity of so dreadful a discussion, by dropping the article; that we may write to America and stop the enquiry.  
  
To John Adams, Benjamin Franklin

y articles.—  
It is agreed, that his Britannic Majesty will earnestly recommend it to his parliament to provide for and make a compensation to the merchants and shop-keepers of Boston, whose goods and merchandise were seized and taken out of their stores, warehouses and shops, by order of General Gage and others of his commanders and officers there, and also to the inhabitants of Philadelphia, for the goods taken away by his army there; and to make compensation also for the tobacco, rice, indigo, and negroes, &amp;c. seized and carried off by his armies under Generals Arnold, Cornwallis and others, from the states of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia; and also for all vessels and cargoes, belonging to the inhabitants of the said United States, which were stopped, seized or taken either in the ports or on the seas, by his Governors, or by his ships of war, before the declaration of war against the said states.  
  
And it is further agreed, that his Britannic majesty will also earnestly recommend it to his parliament to make compensation for all the towns, villages and farms burnt and destroyed by his troops or adherents in the said U. States.  
Facts—There existed a free commerce upon mutual faith between Great Britain and America. The merchants of the former credited the merchants and planters of the latter, with great quantities of goods, on the common expectation that the merchants, having sold the goods, would make the accustomed remittances; that the planters would do the same, by the labor of their negroes, and the produce of that labour, tobacco, rice, indigo, &amp;c.  
  
England, before the goods were sold in America, sends an armed force, seizes those goods in the stores, some even in the ships that brought them, and carries them off; seizes also and carries off the tobacco, rice and indigo, provided by the planters to make returns, and even the negroes from whose labour they might hope to raise the produce for that purpose.  
  
Britain now demands that the debts shall nevertheless be paid.  
Will she? Can she justly refuse making compensation for such seizures?  
If a draper who had sold a piece of linen to a neighbor on credit, should follow him, take the linen from him by force; and then send a bailiff to arrest him for the debt; would any court of law or equity award the payment of the debt, without ordering a restitution of the cloth?  
Will not the debtors in America cry out, that if this compensation be not made they were betrayed by the pretended credit, and are now doubly ruined, first by the enemy and then by the negotiators at Paris; the goods and negroes sold them being taken from them, with all they had besides, and they are now to be obliged to pay for what they have been robbed o

Extract of a letter from Doctor Franklin ts Richard Ofwald, Efqure.  
Pass x, November 26th, 1782.  
SIR, |  
  
YOU may well remember, that in the beginning of our conferences, be-  
fore the other commiſſioners arrived, on your mentioning to me a retribution  
tor the loyaliſts whoſe eſtates had been forfeited, I acquainted you that no-  
dung of that kind could be e by us, the confication being made by  
  
z Firtue

| cn)  
virtue of laws of particular ſtates, which the Congreſs had no power to con»  
travene or diſpenſe with, and therefore could give us no ſuch authority in  
our commiſſion. And I give it as my opinion and advice, honeſtly and cor.  
dially, that if a reconciliation was intended, no mention ſhould be made, in  
our negociations, of theie people; for they have done infinite miſchief to our  
properties, by wantonly burning and deftroying farm-houſes, villages, and |  
towns; if compenſation for their loſſes were inſiſted on, we ſhould certain!  
exhibit againſt it an account of all the ravages they had committed, which  
would neceſſarily recal to view ſcenes of barbarity that muſt inflame inſtead  
of conciliating, and tend to perpetuate an enmity that we all profeſs a defire  
of extinguiſhing. Underſtanding however from you, that this was a point  
our - miniſtry had at heart, I wrote concerning it to Congreſs, and I hare  
ately received the following reſotution, viz. .  
  
« By the UNITED STATES in CONGRESS aſſembled.  
  
September 10, 1782,  
  
e RESOLVED, That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs be, and he is  
hereby directed to obtain, as ſpeedily as poſſible, authentic returns of the  
ſlaves and other property which have been carried off or deſtroyed in the  
courſe of the war, by the enemy, and to tranſmit the ſame to the Miniſters  
Plenipotentiary for negociating peace.”  
rx RESOL Eb, That in the mean time the Secretary for Foreign Af.  
fairs inform the ſaid Miniſters, that many thouſands of flaves and other pro-  
perty to a very great amount, have been carried off or deſtroyed by the ene-  
my; and that, in the opinion of Congreſs, the great loſs of property which  
the citizens of the United States have ſuſtained by the enemy, will be con-  
fidered by the ſeveral States, as an inſuperable bar to their l reſtitution,  
or inden nification to the former owners of property, which has been, or  
may be forfeited to, or coniiſcated, by any of the ſtates.”  
  
Tn conſequence of theſe refolutions, and the circular letters of the Secre-  
tary, the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania, then fitting, paſſed the following act, viz,  
  
« An Act for procuring an eſtimate of the damages ſuſtained by the in-  
habitants of — lvania, from the troops and adherents of the King of Great  
Britain, during the preſent war.“ x  
  
We have not yet had time to hear what has been done by the other aſſem-  
blies, but I have no doubt that ſimilar acts will be made by all of them, and  
that the maſs of evidence produced by the execution of thoſe acts, not on  
of the enormities committed by thoſe people, under th direction of Britiſh  
generals, but of thoſe committed by the Britiſh troops themſelves, will form  
a record that muſt render the Britiſh name odious in America to the lateſt  
generations. In that authentic record will be found the burning of the fine  
towns of Charleſtown near Boſton, of Falmouth juſt before winter, when  
the ſick, the aged, the women and children, were driven to ſeek ſhelter where  
they could hardly find it. Of Norfolk in the midſt of winter. Of New-  
London, of Fairfield, of Eſopus, &amp;c. &amp;c. beſides near a hundred and fifty  
miles of well ſettled country laid waſte, every houſe and barn burnt, and  
many hundreds of farmers, with their wives and children, butchered and

unneceſſary miſchief, unjuſtifiable by the practice of any civilized people,  
which thoſe they make war with are to ſuffer without claiming any fatis-

unprovoked. The loyaliſts * ſay in excuſe of theirs, that&quot; they were  
exaſperated by the loſs of their eſtates, and it was revenge. They have then  
had their revenge. ls it right they ſhould have both? | |  
  
Some of theſe people may have a merit with regard to Britain, thoſe who  
eſpouſed her cauſe from affection; theſe ir may become you to reward. Bur  
there are many of them who were waverers, and were only determined to  
engage in it by ſome occaſional circumſtances or appearances ; theſe have not  
much of either merit or demerit, and there are others who have abundance  
of demerit, reſpecting your country, having by their falſhoods and miſrepre-  
ſentations brought on and encouraged the continuance of the war. Theſe,  
inſtead of being recompenſed, ſhould be puniſhed. _ |  
  
It is uſual among chriſtian people at war, to profeſs always a defire of  
peace: but if the miniſters of one of the parties chooſe to inſiſt particularly  
on a certain article which they have known the others are not and cannot be  
empowered to agree to, what credit can they expect ſhould be given to ſuch  
profeſſions ? .  
  
Your miniſters require that we ſhould receive again into our boſom, thoſe  
who have been our bittereſt enemies, and reſtore their properties who have  
deſtroyed ours; and this, while the wounds _ have given us are ſtill bleed-  
ing. [rt is many years ſince your nation expelled the Stuarts and their ad-  
herents, and confiſcated their eftates. Much of your reſentment againſt them  
may by this time be abated; yet if we ſhould mp in it, and inſiſt on it as  
an article of our treaty with you, that that family ſhould be recalled, and the  
forfeited eſtates of its friends reſtored, would you think us ſerious in our  
profeſſions of earneſtly deſiring peace?  
  
I muſt repeat my opinion, that it is beſt for you to drop all mention of the  
refugees. We have propoſed indeed nothing but what we think belt for  
you as well as ourſelves, But if you will have them mentioned, let it be in  
an article which may provide, that they ſhall exhibit accounts of their loſſes, to  
commiſſioners hereafter to be appointed, who ſhall examine the ſame, to-  
gether with the accounts now preparing in America, of the damage done  
them, and ſtate the account ; and that 1f a balance appears in their favour, it  
fall be paid by us to you, and by you divided among them as you ſhall  
think proper. And if the balance is found due to us, it ſhall be paid by  
  
ou.  
2 Give me leave, however, to adviſe you to prevent the neceſſity of fo dread-  
ſ:] a diſcuſſion, by dropping the article, that we may write to America, and  
  
ſtop the enquiry,

that we should receive again into our bosom those who have  
been our bitterest enemies, and restore their properties who  
have destroyed ours; and this while the wounds they have  
given us are still bleeding. Itis many years since your nation

their estates. Much of yourresentment against them may  
by this time be abated, yet, if we should propose it, and  
insist on it as an article of our treaty with vou, that the  
family should be recalled and the forfeited estates of its  
friends restored, would you think us serious in our profes-  
sions of earnestly desiring peace? I must repeat my opin-  
ion that it is best for you tv drop all mention of the refu-  
gees.”°—Ibid., 221.
