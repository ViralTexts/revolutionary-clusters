Everything in the house was arranged with  
the idea of furnishing the comforts de-  
manded by a man of refinement and position  
among the first families of Virginia. Per-

of the drawing room was the marriage of  
Jefferson’s eldest daughter, Martha, to  
Thomas Mann Ranuolph of Tuckahoe, Feb.  
23, 1790, when there was great festivity.  
  
The grave of Jefferson is in sight from  
the driveway between the house and the  
lodge. In fitting his tomb his wishes were  
carried out. They were found written out,  
among his private papers, after his death.
