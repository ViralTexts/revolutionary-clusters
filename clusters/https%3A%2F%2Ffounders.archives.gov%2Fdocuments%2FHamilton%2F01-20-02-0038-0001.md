Washington proclaimed the treaty on February 29, 1796, and on March 1, 1796, he sent the following message to the Senate and House of Representatives: “The Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, concluded between the United States of America and His Britannic Majesty, having been duly ratified, and the ratifications having been exchanged at London on the 28th day of October, 1795, I have directed the same to be promulgated; and herewith transmit a copy thereof for the information of Congress.”

, a New York City Republican, stated “that it was generally understood that some important Constitutional questions would be discussed when the Treaty lately concluded between this country and Great Britain should come into consideration; it was very desirable, therefore, that every document which might tend to throw light on the subject should be before the House.…” He then made the following motion: “Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested to lay before this House a copy of the instructions given to the Minister of the United States who negotiated the Treaty with Great Britain, communicated by his Message of the first instant, together with the correspondence and other documents relative to the said Treaty.”  
At this time not all the opponents of the Jay Treaty in the House necessarily agreed with Livingston’s resolution. On March 6, 1796, James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson: “… A motion has been laid on the table by Mr. Livingston, calling on the President for the instructions to Jay &amp;c. The policy of haza

The resolution was consequently agreed to and reported to the House.” On April 30, after defeating by a vote of 50 to 49 a preamble to the motion which was proposed by Henry Dearborn of Massachusetts and which stated among other things that the treaty was “highly objectionable,” the House passed the resolution of the Committee of the Whole by a vote of 51 to 48. On the same day the House “Ordered that a bill or bills be brought in pursuant to the said resolution, and that Mr. [James] Hillhouse [of Connecticut], Mr. [Theodore] Sedgwick [of Massachusetts], and Mr. [Albert] Gallatin [of Pennsylvania] do prepare and bring in the same.” On May 2 Hillhouse “reported a bill,” and on May 3 the House passed the measure.
