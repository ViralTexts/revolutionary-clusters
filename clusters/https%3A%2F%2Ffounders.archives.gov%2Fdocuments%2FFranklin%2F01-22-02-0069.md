interlined: entred into] by the Delegates of the several Colonies of New Hampshire &amp;c. in general Congress met at Philadelphia, May 10. 1775.  
Art. I. The Name of the Confederacy shall henceforth be The United Colonies of North America.  
Art. II. The said United Colonies hereby severally enter into a firm League of Friendship with each other, binding [interlined: on] themselves and their Posterity, for [interlined: their common] Defence [interlined: against their Enemies, for] the Security of their Liberties and Propertys, the Safety of their Persons and Families, and their mutual and general welfare.  
Art. III. That each Colony shall enjoy and retain as much as it may think fit of its own present Laws, Customs, Rights, Privileges, and peculiar Jurisdictions within its own Limits; and may amend its own Constitution as shall seem best to its own Assembly or Convention.  
Art. IV. That for the more convenient Management of general Interests, Delegates shall be annually elected in each Colony to meet in General Congress at such Time and Place as shall be agreed on in the next preceding Congress. Only where particular Circumstances do not make a Deviation necessary, it is understood to be a Rule, that each succeeding Congress be held in a different Colony till the whole Number be gone through, and so in perpetual Rotation; and that accordingly the next [interlined: Congress] after the present shall be held at Annapolis in Maryland.  
Art. V. That the Power and Duty of the Congress shall extend to the Determining on War and Peace, to [interlined: sending and receiving Ambassadors, and] entring into Alliances, [the Reconciliation with Great Britain;] the Settling all Disputes and Differences between Colony and Colony [interlined: about Limits or any other cause] if such should arise; and the Planting of new Colonies when proper. The Congress shall also make such general Ordinances as tho’ necessary to the General Welfare, particular Assemblies cannot be competent to; viz. those that may relate to our general Commerce [in the margin: or general Currency]; to the Establishment of Posts; and the Regulation of [interlined: our common] Forces. The Congress shall also have the Appointment of all Officers civil and military, appertaining to the general Confederacy, such as General Treasurer Secretary, &amp;c.  
Art. VI. All Charges of Wars, and all other general Expences to be incurr’d for the common Welfare, shall be defray’d out of a common Treasury, which is to be supply’d by each Colony in proportion to its Number of Male Polls between 16 and 60 Years of Age; the Taxes for paying that proportion [interlined: are] to be laid and levied by [interlined: the] Laws of each Colony.  
Art. VII. The Number of Delegates to be elected and sent to the Congress by each Colony, shall be regulated from time to time by the Number of [interlined: such] Polls return’d, so as that one Delegate be allow’d for every [5000] Polls. And the Delegates are to bring with them to every Congress an authenticated Return of the number of Polls in their respective Provinces, [interlined: which is] to be annually [interlined in another hand: triennially] taken, for the Purposes abovementioned.  
Art. VIII. [In the margin: At every Meeting of the Congress One half of the Members return’d exclusive of Proxies be necessary to make a Quorum, and] Each Delegate at the Congress, shall have a Vote in all Cases; and if necessarily absent, shall be allowed to appoint [interlined: any other Delegate from the same Colony to be his] Proxy, who may vote for him.  
  
Art. IX. An executive Council shall be appointed by the Congress [interlined: out of their own Body,] consisting of [12] Persons; of whom in the first Appointment [interlined: one Third, viz.] [4], shall be for one Year, [4] for two Years, and [4] for three Years; and as the said Terms expire, the vacancies shall be filled by Appointments for three Years, whereby One Third of [the] Members will be changed annually. [In the margin: And each Person who has served the said Term of three Years as Counsellor, shall have a Respite of three Years, before he can be elected again.] This Council [interlined: (of whom two thirds shall be a Quorum)] in the Recess of the Congress is to execute what shall have been enjoin’d thereby; to manage the general [interlined: continental] Business and Interests to receive Applications from foreign Countries; to prepare Matters for the Consideration of the Congress; to fill up (pro tempore) continental Offices that fall vacant; and to draw on the General Treasurer for [such] Monies as may be necessary for general Services, and appropriated by the Congress to such Services.  
Art. X. No Colony shall engage in an offensive War with any Nation of Indians without the Consent of the Congress, or great Council above-mentioned, who are first to consider the Justice and Necessity of such War.  
Art. XI. A perpetual Alliance offensive and defensive, is to be entered into as soon as may be with the Six Nations; their Limits to be [interlined: ascertain’d and] secur’d to them; their Land not to be encroach’d on, nor any private [interlined: or Colony] Purchases made of them hereafter to be held good; nor any [interlined: Contract for Lands] to be made but between the Great Council [interlined: of the Indians] at Onondaga and the General Congress. The Boundaries and Lands of all the other Indians shall also be [in the margin: ascertain’d and] secur’d to them [interlined: in the same manner]; and Persons appointed to reside among them in proper Districts, who shall take care to prevent Injustice in the Trade with them, [in the margin: and be enabled at our General Expence by occasional small Supplies, to relieve their personal Wants and Distresses.] And all Purchases from them shall be by the Congress for the General Advantage and Benefit of the United Colonies.  
Art. XII. As all new Institutions may have Imperfections which only Time and Experience can discover, it is agreed, that the General Congress from time to time shall propose such Amendment of this Constitution as may be found necessary; which being approv’d by a Majority of the Colony Assemblies, shall be equally binding with the rest of the Articles of this Confederation.  
Art. XIII. Any and every Colony from Great Britain [interlined: upon the Continent of North America] not at present engag’d in our Association, may upon Application [interlined: and joining the said Association,] be receiv’d into this Confederation, viz. [Ireland] the West India Islands, Quebec, St. Johns, Nova Scotia, Bermudas, and the East and West Floridas: and shall [interlined: thereupon] be entitled to all the Advantages of our Union, mutual Assistance and Commerce.  
These Articles shall be propos’d to the several Provincial Conventions or Assemblies, to be by them consider’d, and if approv’d they are advis’d to impower their Delegates to agree to and ratify the same in the ensuing Congress. After which the Union thereby establish’d is to continue firm till the Terms of Reconciliation proposed in the Petition of the last Congress to the King are agreed to; till the Acts since made restraining the American Commerce [interlined: and Fisheries] are repeal’d; till Reparation is made for the Injury done to Boston by shutting up its Port; for the Burning of Charlestown; and for the Expence of this unjust War; and till all the British Troops are withdrawn from America. On the Arrival of these Events the C[olonies are to] return to their former Connection and Friendship with Britain: But on Failure thereof this Confederation is to be perpetual.

approved, they are advifed to empower  
their Delegates to agree and ratify the

the union thereby eftablifhed is to con-  
tinue firm, till the terms of reconciliati-  
on propofed in the Petition of the laft  
Congrefs to the King are agreed to;  
till the Acts, fince made, reftraining the  
American commerce and fifheries, are  
repealed; till reparation is made for the  
injury done to Bofton by fhutting up its  
ports ; for burning Charleftowns and

till all the Britifh troops are withdrawn  
from America. On the arrival of thefe

their former connexions and friendfhip  
with Great Britain; but on failure there-  
of, this Confederation is to be per-

This is a somewhat curious description—‘“ every colony  
from Great Britain upon the continent of North America,  
namely, Ireland,” (to say nothing of the islands,) etc. Such  
a form of speech the proposition for a North American asso-  
ciation inclusive of Ireland—might more reasonably have  
been expected from some Hibernian pen than from one so  
accurate as Franklin’s. So however it is written. How the  
lapsus is to be explained we do not know, but as we have  
quoted it, the article stands in the documents relative to the  
confederation, contained in the secret journal of the old con-  
gress,
