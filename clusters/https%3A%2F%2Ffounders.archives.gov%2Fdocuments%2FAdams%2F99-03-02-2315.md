3 June 1813.  
  
The whole system of Christian morality appears to have been set forth, by its divine author in the sermon upon the mount, recorded in the 5th: 6th: and 7th: Chapters of St: Matthew. I intend hereafter to make them the subject of remarks, much more at large.—For the present I confine myself merely to general views. What I would impress upon your mind as infinitely important to the happiness and virtue of your life is the general spirit of Christianity and the duties which result from it.  
In my last letter I shewed you from the very words of our Saviour that he commanded his disciples to aim at absolute perfection, and that this perfection consisted in self-subjugation and brotherly love—In the complete conquest of our own Passions, and in the practice of benevolence to our fellow creatures, including among them our most inveterate enemies.  
Among the Grecian systems of moral philosophy that of the stoics resembled the Christian doctrine in this particular of requiring the total subjugation of the Passions and this part of the Stoic principles was adopted by the academics. You will find the question discussed with all the Eloquence and ingenuity of Cicero in the fourth of his Tusculan disputations, which I advise you to read and to meditate upon. You will there find proved as fully as human reason can prove the duty of totally subduing the Passions.  
It is sometimes objected that this theory is not adapted to the infirmities of human Nature that it is not made for a being so constituted as man—than an earthen vessel is not formed to dash itself against a rock—that in yielding to the impulse of the Passions, man only follows the dictates of his Nature; and that to subdue them entirely is an effort beyond his powers.  
The weakness and frailty of man it is not possible to deny: it is too strongly attested by all human experience as well as by the whole tenor of the scriptures: but the degree of weakness must be limited by the efforts to overcome it, and not by indulgence to it—Once admit weakness as an argument to forbear exertion and it results in absolute impotence.  
It is also very inconclusive reasoning to infer that because perfection is not absolutely to be obtained, it is therefore not to be sought. Human excellence consists in the approximation to perfection; and the only means of approaching to any term, is by endeavouring to attain the term itself.  
With these convictions upon the mind; with a sincere and honest effort to practice upon them, and with the aid of a divine blessing which is promised to it, the approaches to perfection may at least be so great as nearly to answer all the ends which absolute perfection itself could attain. All exertion therefore is virtue, and if the tree is to be judged by its fruits, it is certain that all the most virtuous characters of heathen antiquity were the disciples of this stoic doctrine.  
Let it even be admitted that a perfect command over the Passions, is unattainable to human infirmity, and it will yet be true that the degree of moral excellence possessed by every individual is in exact proportion to the degree of controul which he exercises over himself—According to the Stoics all vice was resolvable into folly—according to Christian principles, it is all the effect of weakness.  
In order to preserve the dominion of our own Passions, it behooves us to be constantly and strictly upon our guard, against the influence and the infection of the Passions of others—This caution is above all necessary in youth, and I deem it the more indispensable to enjoin it upon you, because as kindness and benevolence comprize the whole system of Christian duties; there may be and often is great danger of falling into error and vice, merely by the want of energy to resist the example or the enticement of others—On this point the true character of Christian morality appears to me to have been misunderstood by some of its ablest and warmest defenders—In Paley’s View of the Evidences of Christianity there is a Chapter upon the morality of the Gospel, the general tenour of which as of the whole Work is excellent, but in which there is the following passage.  
“The truth is, there are two opposite descriptions of character, under which mankind may generally be classed. The one possesses vigour, firmness, resolution, is daring and active, quick in its sensibilities, jealous of its fame, eager in its attachments, inflexible in its purpose, violent in its resentments.  
“The other, meek, yielding, complying, forgiving; not prompt to act, but willing to suffer; silent and gentle under rudeness and insult, suing for reconciliation, where others would demand satisfaction, giving way to the pushes of impudence, conceding and indulgent to the prejudices, the wrongheadedness, the intractability with whom it has to deal.  
“The former of these characters is, and ever hath been the favourite of the world. It is the character of great men. There is a dignity in it which universally commands respect.  
“The latter is poor-spirited, tame, and abject. Yet so it hath happened, that with the founder of Christianity, this latter is the subject of his commendation; his precepts, his example; and that the former is so in no part of its composition.”—  
Dr: Paley, is in this place adopting the opinion of Soame Jenyns, whose Essay upon the internal Evidence of Christianity he very strongly commends—But I cannot consider this either as accurate and discerning delineation of character, or as exhibiting a correct representation of Christian principles.  
The founder of Christianity did indeed pronounce distinct and positive blessings upon the poor in spirit, (which is by no means synonimous with the poor-spirited) and upon the meek—But in what part of the Gospel did Dr Paley find him countenancing by commendation, precept or example the tame and abject? The Character which Christ assumed upon Earth was that of a Lord and Master—It was in this Character that his disciples received and acknowledge him—The obedience that he required was unbounded—infinitely beyond that which ever was claimed by the most absolute earthly sovereign over his subjects—Never for one instant did he recede from this authoritative Station—He preserved it in washing the feet of his disciples—He preserved it in his Answer to the High-Priest before whom he was brought for trial—He preserved it in his answer to the Officer who struck him for this very deportment to the High-Priest—He preserved it in the very agony of his ejaculation upon the Cross “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do”—He expressly declared himself to be the Prince of this World, and the Son of God—He spoke as one having authority not only to his disciples, but to his Mother, to his Judges, to Pilate, the Roman Governor, to John the Baptist his precursor; and there is in the four Gospels not one act, not one word recorded of him, excepting in his communion with God, that was not a direct or implied or assertion of authority.—He said to his disciples, (Matth: XI.29) “learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls”—But where did he ever say to them “learn of me, for I am tame and abject?”—There is certainly nothing more strongly marked in the precept and example of Christ than the principle of stubborn and inflexible resistance against the impulses of other to evil—He taught his disciples to renounce everything that is counted enjoyment upon Earth, to take up their Cross, and suffer ill-treatment, persecution and death for his sake—What else is the Book of Acts of the Apostles, than a record of the faithfulness with which those chosen Ministers of the Gospel, carried these injunctions into execution.—In the conduct and speeches of Stephen, of Peter and John, or of Paul is there any thing that could justly be called tame or abject?—Is there any thing in them indicating a resemblance to the second Class of Characters into which Dr Paley divides all mankind?—If there is a character upon historical record, distinguished by a bold, intrepid, tenacious and inflexible Spirit, it is that of St: Paul.—It was to such characters only that the Commission of teaching all Nations could be committed with the certainty of success—Observe the expressions of Christ in his charge to Peter—(Matth: XVI.18.) “And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, (a Rock) and upon this Rock, I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”—Dr: Paley’s Christian is one of those drivellers who to use a vulgar adage, can never say “No,” to any body. The true Christian is the “justum et tenacem propositi Virum” of Horace—The combination of these qualities so essential to the Heroic Character, with those of meekness, lowliness of heart, and brotherly love, is what constitutes that moral perfection, of which Christ gave an example in his own life, and to which he commanded his disciples to aspire.  
Endeavour, my dear Son, to discipline your own Heart, and to govern your conduct through life by these principles, thus combined—Be meek, be gentle, be kindly affectioned to all mankind, not excepting even your enemies—But never be tame or abject—never give way to the pushes of impudence, or show yourself yielding or complying to prejudices, wrong-headedness or intractability which would lead or draw you astray from the dictates of your Conscience and your own sense of right—“Till you die, let not your Integrity depart from you.”—Build your house upon the Rock—and then, let the rain descend, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon that house—It shall not fall; for it will be founded upon a Rock. so promises your blessed Lord and Master, and so prays your affectionate father.

to enable us to accomplish.” “In my last, 1  
shewed you from the very words of our Saviour,  
that he commanded his disciples to aim at per­  
fection; and that this perfe&lt; lion consisted in self  
subjugation and brotherly love, in the complete  
conquest of the passions, and in the practice of  
benevolence to our fellow creatures, including  
among them our most inveterate enemies.”—  
“You will there find proved the duty of totally  
uhdii&#x27;ng the passions. It is some times objer­  
  
&#x27;7 . ...» r iw uu; iimrmi­  
tics of human nature; that it is not made fora  
beiug so constituted as man; than an earthen  
vessel is not formed to dash against a rod-, that  
in yielding to the impulse of the passions, man  
only follow- the diet itesof his nature; and that to  
subdue them entirely, is an effort bey ond his  
power. The weakness and frailty of man, is  
strongly attested by all human experience, as  
well as by Hie whole tenor of the scriptures; but  
the degree of weakness is to be limited hy the ef­  
forts to overcome, it, and not by indulgence to it.  
Once admit weakness as an argument to for­  
bear exertion, and it results in absolute impo­  
te.ice. It is also very inconclusive reasoning,  
to infer, that because, perfection is not absolute­  
ly *o he obtained, it is therefore not to be sought.  
Human excellence consists in the approxima­  
tion to perfect ion; and the only means of ap­  
proaching to any term, is by endeavoring to ob­  
tain the term, itself. With these convictions  
upon the mind, and with a sincere, honest ef­  
fort, to practise upon them, and with the aid of  
a divine blessing, which is promised to it, the  
approaches to perfection may at least he so great  
as nearly to answer nil the ends that absolute  
perfection itself could attain.”  
“ In order to preserve the dominion of our  
own passions, it behoves us to be constantly and  
strictly upon our guard, against the influence  
and infection of the passions of others. This  
caution is a 1) necessary in youth; and I deem it  
the more indispensable to enjoin if upon you;  
because, as kindness and benevolence, comprise  
the whole system of Christian duties; there may­  
be, and often is great danger of falling into er­  
ror and vice; merely by the want of energy to  
resist the example, or the enticement of others.  
On this point, the true character of Christian  
morality, appears to have been misunderstood,  
by some of its ablest and warmest defenders.  
In Pa ley’s “ View of the Kvidcnees of Christi­  
anity” there is a chapter upon the morality of  
the Gospel; in which is the following passage,  
“The truth is, there arc two opposite descrip­

way to the pushes of impudence, conceding and  
indulgent to the prejudices, the iulractibility of  
of those it has to deal with; the former of these  
characters is and ever hath been the favorite of  
! the world. It is the character of great men.  
There is a dignity in it, which universally com­  
mands respect. The latter is poor spirited,  
tame and abject. Yet so it happened with the  
/&#x27;o:i)nier of Christianity’, the latter is the subject  
of his commendation, his precepts, his example;  
and that the former is no part of its composi­  
tion. Dr. l*aley is in this place adopting the  
opinion of Soatne Jenyngs, whose essay upon  
the internal evidence of Cliristanity he very  
strongly rccomincuds; but I cannot consider it  
as an accurate and discerning delineation of  
character, or as exhibiting a correct represen­  
tation&#x27;)!&#x27; (&#x27;hnstiun principles. The founder of  
Christianity, did indeed pronounce, distinct ami  
positive blessings upon the poor in spirit (which  
is by no means synonymous with the poor spiri­  
ted,) and the meek. But in what part of the  
gospel did i Jr. Pa ley find him countenancing by  
commendation, precept or example, the tame  
and abject. The character which Christ as­  
sumed upon earth,was that of Lord and Master,  
jit was in this character that his disciples rc­  
i ceived and acknowledged him. The obedience  
| that he re piircd, was unbounded; infinitely be­  
I vond that which was claimed by the most abso­  
| lute earthly sovereign over his subjects,  
j IN’ever for one moment, did he recede  
from the authoritative system.-lie pre­  
served it in wasling the feet of his disciples.  
He preserved it in his answer to the high priest,  
lie preserved it in the very agony of his excla­  
mation upon the cross. “ Farther forgive them,  
they know not what they do:” lie expressly&#x27;  
declares himself to be the prince of this world,  
and the Son of Gotl. 1 Ie spoke as one having au­  
thority ; not only to Ins Disciples, hut to his mo­  
ther, iiis Judges ; to Pilate the Roman Govern­  
or, to John the Baptist, his precursor. And  
there is not in the four Gospels, one act, nor  
one word recorded ofhiui (exceptingin his com­  
munion with Cod) that was not a director im­  
plied assertion of authority. lie said to his dis­  
ciples (Mathew, xii, 2D,) ‘learn of me, for 1 am  
meek and lowly in heart, and ve shall find rest  
  
to your souls. But where uul lie ever say, iearn  
of mo, for i am tame and abject. There is cer­  
tainly, nothing more strongly marked in the  
precept and example of Christ, than the princi­  
ple of stubborn and inflexible resistance, a­  
gainst the impulses of others to evil. He taught  
his deciplos, to renounce every thing that is  
counted enjoyment upon earth ; to take up their  
cross, and sutler all ill-treatment, persecution &amp;  
tie ith for his sake. What else is the Book of  
Acts, than a record of the faithfulness with which  
these chosen ministers of thegospel carried these  
injunctions of the gospel into execution. In tire  
conduct and speeches of Stephen, and Peter, of  
John, or of Paul, is there any thing indicating a  
resemblance to the second class of characters,  
into which Dr. Agley divides all mankind ? if  
there is a character upon historical record, dis­  
tinguished by a bold, intrepid, tenacious: and in­  
flexible spirit, it is that of St. Paul. It was to  
such characters only, that the commission of  
teaching could be committed, with certainty of  
success. Observe the expression of Christ to  
Peter, (Matt. x. IK)‘and I say unto thee that  
thou art Peter, (a rock) and upon this rock will  
l I build my church, and the gates of hell shall  
not prevail against it.’ Dr. Paley’s Christian is  
one of those drivellers, who to use a vulgar a­  
dage. can never say Ao, to any body—The true  
Christian is the llJustum et tenace.nipropositi” *  
of Horace. The combination of those qualities  
so essential to the heroic character, with those  
of meekness, lowliness of heart, and brotherly  
love, is what constitutes that moral perfection,  
of which Christ gave an example in his own life,  
and to which lie commanded his disciples to as­  
pire. Kudcavouriny dear son, to discipline your  
own heart, and to govern your conduct by these  
principles thus combined. Be meek, be gentle,  
be kindly&#x27; affectionate to all mankind, not ex­  
cepting your own enemies. But never be tame  
or abject, never give way to (lie pushes of impu­  
dence, or show yourself yielding and complying  
to prejudices, wrong headed ness, or intraeiibili­  
ty, which would lead or draw you astray from the  
dictates of your own conscience, orsense of  
right.—“ Till you die, let not your integrity de­  
part from you.’&#x27; Build your house upon a R&lt; r/r;  
! and then let the rains descend, and Ihe floods  
come, and the winds blow and beat upon that  
house ; it shall not fall, for it will lie founded up­  
on a rocK\—So promises your blessed Lord and  
Saviour, and prays your affectionate father.”

least be so great, as nearly to answer al*  
the ends tliaf absolute perfection itself  
could attain.”  
  
••m oroer to preserve the dominion o1  
our o vn passions, it behoves us to be  
con&amp;iantJy and strictly upon our guard,  
against the influence and infection of the  
passions of others. This caution is all  
necessary in youth ; and I deem it the  
more indispensable to enjoin it upon you;  
because, as kindness apd benevolence,  
comprise the whole system of Christian  
duties ; there may be, and often is great  
danger of falling into ertor and vice ;  
merely by the want of energy tb resist  
the example, or enticement of others.—  
On this point, the true character of  
Chris&#x27;.inn morality, appears to have been  
misunderstood, by some of its ablest and  
warmest defenders. In Paley&#x27;s“Vicw of  
the Evidences ol Christianity&quot; there is a  
chapter upon the morality of the Gospel;  
in which there is the following passage :  
*• 1&#x27;he truth is, there are two opposite  
descriptions of characters under which  
mankind may generally be classed. The  
one possesses vigor, firmness, resolution,­  
is daring and active, quick, in its sensi­  
bilities, jealous of its fame, eager in its  
attachments, inflexible in its purposes,  
violent in its resentments- The other,  
meek, yielding, complying, forgiving,  
not prompt to act, but willing to suffer,  
silent and gentle under rudeness and  
insult, suing for reconciliation, when  
others would demand satisfaction; giving  
wav to the nnshpc rf 1 m 1Mtfli*nrp rnn. &#x27;  
  
ceding and indulgent to the prejudices,  
the intractibility of those he has to deal  
with; the former of these cha’ acters is and  
everhath been the favorite of the world.  
It 13 the character of great men. There  
is a dignity in it, which universally com­  
mands respect. The latter is poor spiri­  
ted, tame and abject. Yet so it happened  
with the founder of Christianity, the lat­  
ter is the subject of his commendation,  
his precepts and his example ; and that  
the former is no part of its composition.&quot;  
Dr. Paley is in this place adopting the  
opinion of Soame Jennings, whose essay  
upon the internal evidence of Christian!*  
ty he very strongly recommends ; but I  
cannot consider it as an accurate and dis­  
cerning delineation of character, or as  
exhibiting a correct representation of  
Christian principles. The founder  
of Christianity, did indeed pronounce  
distinct and positive blessings upon the  
poor in spirit (which is by no means sy­  
nonimous with the poor spirited,) and  
the meek. Dut in what part of the Gos  
pel did Dr. Paley find him countenancing  
by commendation, precept or example,  
the tame and abject. The character  
which Christ assumed on earth, was that  
Lord and Master. It was in this ona­  
racter that his disciples received and  
acknowledged him. The obedience that  
he required was unbounr^d j infinitely  
beyond that which w«j* claimed by the  
most absolute earthy sovereign over his  
subjects. Nev»jf for one moment, did  
he recede fro’m the authoritative system.  
He preserved it in washing the feet of his  
dicciple?t. ||c preserved it ir&gt; his answer  
  
•tie high piiest. H\: preserved i» in  
the very eg&#x27; nr of his exclamation upon  
• he cross, “Father forgiye them, they  
know not what they do.’&#x27; He cxpVcssly  
declares himself to be the prince of this  
world, and the Son of God. He spoke  
as one having authority, not only to his  
disciples, hut to his mother, his judges .­  
to Pilate the Roman governor, to John  
the Baptist, his precursor. And there is  
not in the four Gospels, ohe act, nor one  
Word recorded of (except in his com  
munion with God) that was not a diret*  
or implied assertion of authority lie  
said to his disciples (Matthew, xii. 29.&gt;  
“I.eam of me, for 1 am meek and lowlv  
in heaVt, and ye shall find rest to your  
souls&quot; But where did he ever say.  
learn of me, For 1 am lame and abject.—­  
There is certainly nothing more strongly  
marked in the precept and example of  
Christ, than the principle of stubborn and  
inflexible resistance against the impulse­  
ol others to evil, lie taught his disci  
pies to renounce every thing that is coun­  
ted enjoyment upon, earth ; to take up  
their cross, and suffer all ill-treatment,  
persecution and death for his sake.  
W hat else is the Book of Acts, than a  
record of the faithfulness with which  
these chosen ministers of the gospel car­  
ried these injunctions of the gospel into  
execution. In the conduct and speeches  
of Stephen, and Peter, of John, or of  
Paul, is there any thing indicating a  
resemblance to the second class of cha­  
racters into which Dr. Paley divides all  
mankind ? If there is a character upon  
historical record, distinguished by a bold.  
  
intrepid, tenacious and inflexible spirit, it  
is that of St. Paul. It was to such cha­  
racters only, that the commission of  
teaching could be committed with cer­  
tainty of success. Observe the expres­  
sion of Christ to Peter,(Matt. x. 18)“and  
I say unto thee, thou art Peter, (a rockj  
&amp; upon this rock will I build my church,  
and the gates of hell shall not prevail  
against it.&quot;  
Dr. Paley&#x27;s Christian is one of those  
drivellers, who, to use a vulgar adage,  
can never say not to any body—The true  
Christian is the “Juatum et tenacem firo­  
t of Horace. The combination or  
those qualities so essential to the heroic  
character, with those of meekness, low­  
liness of heart, and brotherly love, is what  
constitutes that moral perfection, ol  
which Christ gave an example in his own  
life,8c to which he commanded his disci  
pics to aspire. Endeavor,my dear son,to  
discipline your own heart, and to govern

John, or of Paul, is there any thing indica-  
ting a resemblance to the second’ Class of  
characters, into which Dr. Paley divides  
all mankind? If there isa character upon  
  
~ historical record, distinguished by a bold,  
  
intrepid, tenacious. and inflexible spirit, is  
js that of St. Paul. It was to such charac-  
  
ters, only, that the commission of teaching  
could be commitied with certainty of suc-  
cess, Observe the expression of Christ to  
Peter; (Mat. x. 18,)¢and 1 say unto thee,  
that thou art Peter, (a rock; ) and upon  
this rock will I build my-church, and the  
gates of hell shall not prevail against it.’  
Dr. Paley’s Christan is one of those drivel-  
lers, who, to use a vulgar adage, can never  
say No, to any body—the true Chrisian is  
the “Justum et tenacem propositi virum”,  
of Horace. Vhe combination of those qual-  
ities, so essential to the heroic character,  
with those of meekness, lowliness of heart,  
and brotherly love is what constitutes that  
moral perfection, of which Christ gave an  
example in his own life, and to which he  
commanded his disciples to aspire. En-.  
deavo1, my dear son, to discipline your own  
heart, and to govern your conduct by these  
principles thus combined. Be meek, be gen-  
tle be kindly affectionate to all mankind, not  
excepting yourenemies. But never be tame  
or abject; never give way to thée*pushes of  
impudence, or show yourself yielding, and

or intractability, which would lead or draw  
you astray from the dictates of your own

die, let not your integrity depart from you.’  
Build your house upon a rock ; and then let

” In my last, I showed you Irom the ve­  
ry words of our Saviour, that he com­  
manded his disciples to aim at perfec­  
tion ; and that this perfection consisted  
in self-subjugation and brotherly love, in  
the conquvM of the passions, and in the  
practice of brncvolence to our fellow­  
creatures, including among them our  
most inveterate enemies.” “ You will  
tnere find proved the duty of totally sub­  
duing the passions. It is sometimes ob­  
jected that this theory is not adapted to  
the infirmities of human na ure ; that it  
is not made for a being so constituted  
as man ; that an ca&#x27;rthern vessel is not.  
.formed to dash against a rock ; that in  
I yielding to the impulse ol the pas-ions,  
1 man only follows the dictates of Ins na­  
ture ; and that to subdue them entirely,  
is an effort beyond his power. The  
weakm s-. and frailty of man, ii is not pos­  
sible to deny ; it is too strongly attested  
by all human experience, as well as by  
the whole tenor of the Scriptures; hut  
the degree of weakness is to he limited  
:&gt;y the efforts to overcome it, and not by  
mdu&#x27;geiire to it. Once arlir.it weakness  
as an argument t&#x27;i forberr exertion, and  
it results in absolute impotence. It is  
also very inconclusive rc.is ming, to iu­  
*er, that because perfection is not abso­  
lutely to he obtained, it is tin refute not  
[ to be s tight. Human excellence con­  
sists in the approximation to perfection;  
and tile only means of approaching to  
any term, is by endeavoring td obtain the  
term itself. With these convictions tip­  
on the mind, anil with a sincere, honest  
effort to practise upon them, and wit.i  
the aid ol a Divine blessing, which is  
promised to u, the approaches to per­  
fection may at least he so great, as near­  
ly to answer all the ends that abs lute  
perh•cii&#x27;in itself cop Id attain ”  
“ In order to preserve the dominion of  
our own passions, it behoves us to be  
constantly and strictly upon our guard,  
against the influence and infection of the  
passions of others. This caution is all  
necessary in youth, anti ! deem it the  
more indispensable to enjoin it upon you,  
because as kindness and benevolence,

/’|n this point, the true character ol Chris­  
tian morality, appears to have been mis­  
understood, tip some of ns ablest and  
w u nir.st d- fenders. In Fairy’s “ View  
of the Idvidfclif.es of Chiis&#x27;i.u.i-y,” there  
is a chapter upon the morality oi the Gos­  
pel ; in which there is the sallowing pas­  
sage. “ ’&gt; he truth i- tlirte are two op­  
posite descriptions of chi meters under  
which, mankind may generally he class­  
ed. The one possesses vigi r, firmness,  
resolution; i dating and active, quick

conceding and indulgent to the prejudi­  
ces, the tniractihility of those it lus to  
,&#x27;teal with ; the lurmer ol these charac­  
ters is, and ever hath been, the favorite  
&gt;f&#x27;he world. Ii is the character of f&#x27;reul  
’’ten. There is a dignity in it, which uni.  
versally commands respect. The latter  
is poor spirited, ;ame slid abject. Yet  
so it happened with &#x27;lie founder of Chris­  
tianity, the latter is the subject of his  
commendation, his precepts, his exam­  
ple ; an I that the former is no part of  
Us composition.” Dr. Paley is in this  
nlace adopting the opinion ol Soame Jen­  
nings, whose «-:say upon the internal evi  
deuce of Christianity, lie very strongly  
commends; hut I cannot consider it as  
an accurate and decerning delineation  
of eharact tr, or as exhibiting a correct  
H-orcsentatiifn of Christian principles.  
The founder of Christianity did indeed  
pronounce, distinct and positive hlcssings  
upon the poor in spit it (which is by no  
means synonitnous with the poor spirit­  
ed) and the meek. But in what part of  
the gospel did Dr. Paley find hint coun­  
tenancing by commendation, precept or  
example, the tame and abject. The  
character which Christ assumed upon  
earth, was that of Lord and Master. It  
was in this character that his disciples  
received and acknowledged him. The  
obedience that he required was unbound­  
ed : infinitely beyond that which was  
claimed by the most absolute earthly ;  
sovereign over his subjects. Nevtr for !  
one moment did he recede from the au­  
thoritative system. He preserved it in  
washing the feet of his diseipl- s. He  
preserved it in his answer to the high  
priest. He preserved it in the very ago­  
ny of his acclamation upon the cross.  
“ Father forgive them, they know not  
what they do.” He expressly declared  
himself to be the prince of this world,  
and the son of God. He spoke, as one  
having authority, not only to his disciples,  
hut to his mother, his judges; to Pilate  
the Roman Governor, te John the Rap-,  
  
tist, his precursor. And there is not in  
the iour Gospels, one set, nor one word  
recorded ol him (excepting in his com­  
munication with G d) that was not a di­  
rect or implied assertion of authority.  
He said to his disciples (Matthew xii. 29)  
11 learn ol me, lor I am meek and lowly  
in heart, and you shall find rest to your  
souls.” But where did he ever say learn  
ol me, for I ant tame and abject. There  
is certainly nothing more strongly mark­  
ed i;i the precepts and examples ol Christ,  
than the principle ofs&#x27;.ubborn and infl xt­  
blc resistance, against the impulses of  
others to evil. He taught his discipiex  
to renounce every thing that is coumed  
enjoyment u|ion earth : lo take up their  
cross and suffer all ill-tr atment, perse­  
cution and death for his sake. What  
else is the book of arts, than a record of  
the faithfulness with which these chosen  
ministers ol the gospel carried these in­  
junctions of the gospel into execution.  
In ihe conduct anil s|&gt;eeches of Stephen,  
and Peter, of John, or ol Paul, is there  
any thing indicating a resemblance to  
the second class of characters, into  
which Dr. l’aky divides all mankind ?  
it mere u a character upon historical  
record, distinguished by a bold, intrepid,  
tenacious and inflexible spirii, it is (nut  
ol St. Paul. It was to such characters  
only, that the commission of tea i gall  
nations, could bs committed, with cer­  
linty of success. Observe &#x27;he expres­  
sion ol Christ to Peter, (Matt. x. 12)  
“ and 1 say into thee that thou art Peter,  
(a rock) and upon ibis rock will 1 build  
my church, and toe gates of hell shall  
not prevail against it.” Dr. Paiey’s  
Christian is one of those drivell is, who,  
to use a vulgar adage, can never say A&#x27;o  
to any body. ’Pile line Christian is the  
*• Justum et tenacctn (u o/iostei virum”*  
of Horace. 1 he &lt;■ oobinaiion .,f thus,  
qualities so essential to the heroic cha­  
racter, with those of meekness, loivli iess

stt&#x27;utes that moral perfection, of which  
Christ gaic an example in his own life,  
and to which he commanded his disci­  
l&gt;les to aspire. Endeavor, my dear son,  
to discipline your own heart, and to go­  
vern your conduct by these principles  
thus combined. Be meek, be gentle,  
be kindly affectionate to all mankind, not  
excepting your own enemies. Bui ne­

‘In my last, 1 shewed you, from the’ very  
words of our Saviour, that he commanded his  
disciples to aim at perfection; and that this  
perfection consisted in self-subjugation and  
brotherly love, in the complete conquest of the  
passions, and in the practice of benevolence to  
our fellow-creatures, including among them our  
most inveterate enemies.”—*&gt; You will there  
find, proved the duty of totally subduing the pas-  
sions. It is sometimes objected that this theo-  
ry isnot adapted to the infirmities of human  
nature ; that it is not made for a being so con-  
stituted as man; that an earthen vessel is not  
formed to dash against a rock; that in yielding  
to the impulse of the passions, man only follows  
the dictates of his nature; and that, to subdue  
them entirely, is an effort beyond his power.—  
The weakness and frailty of man, it is not pos-  
sible to deny ; it is too strongly attested by all  
human experience, as well as by the whole  
tenor of the scriptures ; but the degree of weak-  
ness is to be limited by the efforts to overcome  
it, and not by indulgence to it. Once admit  
weakness as an argument to forbear exertion, &amp;  
it results in absolute impotence. It is also very  
inconclusive reasoning, to infer, that, because  
perfection is not absolutely to be obtained, it is  
therefore not to be sought. Human excellence  
consists in the approximation to perfection ;—  
and the only means of approaching to any term,  
is by endeavouring to obtain the term itself.—  
With these convictions upon the mind, and with  
a sincere, honest effort to practise upon them,  
and with the aid of a divive blessing, which is  
promised to it, the approaches to perfection  
may at last be so great, as nearly to answer all  
the ends that absolute perfeetion itself could at-  
tain.”

‘In order to preserve the dominion of our  
own passions, it behoves us to be constantly and  
strictly upon our guard, againsi the influence  
and infection of the passions of others. This  
caution is all necessary in youth; and I deem  
it the: more indispensable to enjoin it upon you ;  
because, as kindness and benevolence comprise  
the whole system of Christian duties, there may  
be, and often is, great danger of falling into er-  
ror and vice ; merely by the want of energy to  
resist the example, or the enticement of others.  
On this point, the true character of Christian  
morality appears to have been misunderstood,  
by some of its ablest and warmest defenders.—  
In Paley’s ‘ View of the Evidences of Christian-  
ity,’ there is a chapter upon the morality of the  
Gospel; in which there is the following pas-  
sage : —‘&#x27;The truth is, there are two opposite de-  
scriptions of characters, under which mankind  
may generally be classed. ‘I&#x27;he one possesses  
vigour, firmness, resolution; is daring and  
active, quick in its sensibilities, jealous of its  
fame, eager in its attachments, inflexible in its  
purposes, violent in its resentments. ‘The oth-  
er meek, yielding, complying, forgiving, not  
prompt to act, but willing to suffer, silent and  
gentle under rudeness and insult, suing for re-  
conciliation, where others would demand satis- |  
faction, giving way to the pushes of impudence, |  
conceding and indulgent to the prejudices, the

of his disciples. He preserved it j |  
to the high priest. He preserved it in tamer  
agony of his exclamation upon the cr nt  
ther, forgive them, they know not what t e  
do.’ He expressly declared himself to be nf  
prince of this world and the son of God. : “  
spoke as one having authority, not only to his  
disciples, but to his mother, his judges; to Pj  
late the Roman Governor, to John the Ba ;  
his Precursor. And there is not in the os.  
Gospels, one act, nor one word recorded of bin  
(excepting in his communion with God,) th  
was not a direct or implied assertion of auithor  
ity. He said to his disciples, (Matthew. y::  
29.) ‘learn of me, for I am meek and low! +  
heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls, But  
where did he ever say, learn of me, for 1 am  
tame and abject? ‘There is certainly n  
more strongly marked in the precept and  
  
ple of Christ, than the princhpta of sulicora vt  
inflexible resistance, against the impulses of  
others to evil. He taught his disciples to re.  
nounce every thing that is counted enj y ment  
on earth; to take up their cross, and suffer all il}  
treatment, persecution and death, for his sake.  
  
  
  
the faithfulness with which these chosen minis.  
ters of the Gospel carried these injunctions of  
the Gospel into execution? In the conduct and  
speeches of Stephen, and Peter, of John, or of  
Paul, is there any thing indicating a resem.  
blance te the second class of characters, into  
which Dr Paley divides all mankind. If there  
is a character upon historical records, distin.  
guished by a bold, intrepid, tenacious, and ip.  
flexible spirit, it is that of St Paul. Itwwas to  
such characters, only, that the commission of  
teaching could be committed with certainty of  
success. Observe the expression of Christ to  
Peter, (Matthew x. 18,) ‘and I say unto thee,  
  
will 1 build my church, and the gates of hell  
shall not prevail against it.’ Dr Paley’s Chris.  
  
vulgar adage, can never say .No, to any body  
—the true Christian is the ‘ Justum et teaacem  
propositt virum,* of Horace. The combination  
of those qualities, so essential to the heroic  
character, with those of meekness, lowliness of  
heart, and brotherly love, is what constitutes  
that moral perfection, of which Christ gave an  
example in his own life, and to which he com.  
manded his disciples to aspire. Endeavour, my  
dear son, to discipline your own heart, and to  
govern your conduct by these principles thus  
combined. Be meek, be gentle, be kindly af-  
fecttonate to all mankind, not excepting your  
enemies. But never be tame or abject; nevér  
give way to the pushes of impudence, or show  
yourself yielding and complying to prejudices,  
wrong-headedness, orintractability, which would  
lead or draw you astray from the dictates of  
your own conscience, or sense of right. * Till  
you die, let not your integrity depart from you.  
Buiid your house upon a rock ; and then let the  
rains descend, and the floods come, and the  
winds’ blow and beat upéh that house, it shall  
not fall, for it will be founded upon a rock. So  
promises your blessed Lord and Saviour, and  
prays your affectionate father.”

“In my lasi, I shewed you from the  
very words of ©ur Savour that he com­  
manded his disciples to aitn at per­  
fection— and that this perfection be  
considered in self subjection and bro­  
therly love, in the complete conquest  
of the passions, and in the practice of  
benevolence to our fellow creatures, in­  
cluding among them our most inveterate  
enemies.” “You will there find proved  
the duly of totally subduing the pas­  
sions. It is sometimes objected that  
this theory is not adapted to the infirmi­  
ties of human nature-that it is not made  
for a being so constituted as man, that  
an earthen vessel is not formed Io dash  
against a rock, that in yielding to (he  
impulse of the passions, man only fol­  
lows the dictates of his nature; and that  
to subdue them entirely, is an effort be­  
yond his power. The weakness and  
frailty of man, it is not possible to deny  
it is too strongly attested by all human  
experience, as well as by the whole ten­  
or of the scriptures ; but degree of  
weakness to be limited by the efforts to  
overcome it; and not by indulgence to  
it. Once admit weakness in an argument  
to forbear exertion, and it results in ab­  
solute impotence. It is also very in­  
conclusive reasoning, to infer, that be­  
cause perfection is not absolutely to be  
obtained, it is therefore not t© be sought.  
Human excellence consists in the ap­  
proximation to perfection ; and the only  
means ofapproaching Io any term, is by  
endeavouring to obtain the term itself.  
With these convictions upon the mind,  
and with a sincere,-honest effort to prac­  
tise upon them, and with the aid of a  
divine blessing, promised to it,  
the approaches to perfection may al  
least be so great as nearly to answer all  
the ends that absolute perfection itself  
could attain.”  
“ In order to preserve the dominion of  
our own passions, it behoves us to be  
constantly mid strictly upon our guard  
against the influence and iofecti »n of the  
passions oi others. This caution is all  
necessary in youth ; and I de&lt; m it the  
more indispensable to enjoin it upon  
you, because as kindness and benevo­  
lence comprise the whole system of  
Christian duties,Jhere may be, and often  
is, great danger of falling into error and  
vice, merely by the want of energy to  
resist the example, or the enticement of  
others. On this point, the true charac­  
ter of Christian morality,appears to have  
been misunderstood, by some of its  
ablest and warmest defenders. In Pa­  
ley’s “ View of the Evidences of Chri­  
tianity,” there is a chapter upon the  
morality of the Gospel, in which there  
is the following passage: “The truth is,  
there are two opposite discriptions of  
character under* which mankind may  
generally be classed. The one possess­  
es vigor, firmness, resolution—is daring  
and active, quick in its sensibilities,  
jealous of its fame, imager in its attach­  
ments, inflexible in iis purposes, violent  
in its resentments. The other meek,  
yielding, complying, forgiving, not  
prompt to act, but willing to suffer, si­  
lent and gentle under i ndeness und in­  
sult,suing for reconciliation, when others  
would demand satisfaction ; giving way  
to the pushes of imprudence, conceding  
and indulgent to the prejudices, the  
intractibility of those it has to deal with,  
the former of these characters is, ami  
ever hath been the favorite of the

world. It is the character of great men.  
There is a dignity in it, which universal­  
ly demands respect. The latter is poor  
spirited; tame and abject. Yet it so  
happened with the founder of Christiani­  
ty, the latter is the subject of his com­  
mendation, his precepts,his ex imple.aod  
that the former is no part of iis compo­  
sition.  
Dr. Paley is in this place adopting (Le  
opinion oi Soame Jennings, whose essay  
upon the internal evidences of Christian­  
ity, he very strongly recommends; but  
I cannot consider it as an accurate and  
discerning Arimoition nr characlet, or  
as exhibiting a correct representation of  
Christian principles. The founded of  
Christianity did indeed pronounce dis­  
tinct and positive blessings upon the poor  
in spirit (which is by no means synony­  
mous with the poor spirited.) and (he  
meek. But in what part oi the gospel  
did Dr. Paley find him countenancing by  
commendation, -precept or example, (fie  
tame and abject. The character which  
Christ assumed upon earth, was that of  
Lord and Master. It was in this char­  
acter that his disciples received and ac­  
knowledged him. The obedience (hat  
he required was unbounded, infinitely  
beyond that which was claimed by the  
most absolute earthly sovereign over his  
subjects. Neither for one moment  
did he recede from the authoritative  
system.  
lit preserved it in washing the feet of  
his disciples. He preserved it in his an­  
swer to the high priest. He preserved  
it in the very agony of his exclamation  
upon the cross, “ Farther forgive them,  
they know not what (hey do.” He ex­  
pressly declares himself to he the prince  
of this world, and the Son of Ged. He  
spoke as one having authority, not only  
to his disciples, but (o his mother, bis  
Judges ; to Pilate the Roman Governor,  
to John the Baptist, his precursor. And  
there is not in the four Gospels, one act,  
nor one word recorded of him(excepting  
in his communion with God)that was  
not a direct or implied assertion of au­  
thority. He said to his disciples, (Malt,  
xii. 29) “learn ol Ine,for lam meek and  
lowly in In-art, and ye shall find rest to  
your souls.” But where did he ever say,  
learn of me, for 1 atn tame and abject.  
&#x27;I here is certainly nothing more strong­  
ly marked in the precept and example  
of Christ than the principle of stubborn  
and inflexible resistance against the im­  
pulses of others to evil. He taught his  
disciples to renounce every thing lliet  
is upon eartli; to  
take uptheircross and sufferall ill treat­  
ment, persecution and death for his sake.  
What else is Hie Book of Acts, than a  
record oi the faithfulness with wL.ch  
these chosen ministers of the gospel ear­  
ned these injunctions of the gospel into  
execution. In the conduct and speech­  
es ol Stephen and Peter, of John or of  
Paul, is there any thing indicating a re­  
semblance to the second class of charac­  
ters, into which Dr. Paley divides all  
mankind 1 11 there is a character upon  
historical record distinguished by a I old  
intrepid, tenacious and inflexible spirit,  
it is that of St. Paul.  
It was to such only that the  
commssion of teaching could be commit­  
ted, with certainty of success. Observe  
the expression of Christ to Peter. (Matt,  
x. 18.) “And 1 say unto thee that thou  
art Peter, (a rock) and upon this ruck  
will 1 build my church, and the gales of  
hell shall not prevail against it.” Dr.  
Paley’s Christian is one of those drivel­  
lers who, to u-e the vulgar adage, can  
never say no, (o any body. The true  
Christian is the “ Jus t uns et tenaenn pro­  
positi of Horace. The combination of  
those qualities so essential to the heroic  
character, with those oi meekness, low­  
liness of heart, and brotherly love, is  
what constitutes that moral perfection  
of which Christ gave an example-in his  
own life, and to which he commanded  
his disciples to aspire. Endeavor, my  
dear son, to discipline your own heart,  
and to govern your conduct by these  
principles thus combined. Be meek, be  
gentle,-be kindly affectionate to ail man­  
kind, not excepting jour own cmmics.  
But never he tame or abject, never give  
way to the pushes of iinpud/nce, or  
show yourself yielding and complying  
to prejudices, wrong headedness, or in­  
tractihilily, which would lead or draw  
you astray from the dictates ofyour own  
conscience or sense of right.— “ Till you  
die, let not your integrity depart from  
you.” Build your house upon a Kock,  
and then let the rains descend and the  
floods come, and the winds bkw and  
beat upon that house, it shall not fall ;  
for it will be founded upon a rock. So  
promises your blessed Lord and Saviour,  
and prays your affectionate father.”

absolutely to be obtained, it is therefore not to be  
sought. Human excellence consists in the ap-  
proximation to perfection ; and the only means of  
approaching to any term, is by endeavoring to  
obtain the term itself. With these convictions

to practice upon them, and with the aid ofa di-

danger of falling into error and vice, merely by  
  
enticement of others. On this point, the true  
| character of Christian morality appears to have  
  
heen misunderstood, by some of its warmest and  
ablest defenders. In Paley’s View of the evi-  
  
dences of Christianity, there is a chapter mpon  
  
the morality of the Gospel, in which there is the  
  
following passage :—‘* The truth is, there are two  
| Opposite descriptions of character under which  
_ mankind may generally be classed.—The one pos-  
_ sesses vigor, firmness, resolution—is daring and  
| active, quick in its sensibilties. jealous of its fame,  
&#x27; eager in its attachments, inflexible in its purposes,  
| violent in its resentments. The other meek, yield-  
| ing, complying, forgiving, not prompt to act, but  
| willing to suffer, silent and gentle under rudeness  
| insult, suing for reconciliation, when others would  
| demand satisfaction ; giving way to the pushes of  
| imprudence, conceding and indulgent to the pre-  
| judices, the intractability of those it has to deal  
with: the former of these characters is, and ever  
| hath been, the favorite of the world. !t is the  
| character of great men. There is a dignity in it,  
which universally demands respect. The latter  
  
is poor spirited, tame and abject. Yet it so hap-  
p pened with the founder of Christianity. The  
latter is the subject of his commendation, his pre-  
cepts, his example, and that the former is no part  
of its composition.” Dr. Paley is in this place  
adopting tho opinion of Soame Jennings; whose  
essay upon the evidences of Christianity, he very  
strongly fecommends ; but | cannot consider it as  
an accurate and discerning delineation of charac-  
ter, or as exbtbitiag a correct representation of  
Christian principles. The founder of Christianity  
did indeed pronounce distinct and positive bles-  
sings upon the poor in spirit (which is by no means  
synonymous with the poor spirited,) and the meek.  
But in what part of the gospel did Dr. Paley find  
him countenancing by commendation, precept or  
xample the tame and abject. The character  
which Christ assumed upon earth, was that ot  
  
his disciples received and acknowledged him.  
The obedience that he required, was unbounded ;  
infinitely beyond that which was claimed by the  
most absolute earthly sovereign over his subjects.  
Neither for one moment did he recede from the  
authoritative system.  
  
He preserved it in washing the feet of his disci-  
ples. —He preserved it in his answer to the high  
priest. He preserved it in the very agony of his  
exclamations upon the cross—‘* Father torgiv:  
them, they know not what they do.”&quot;—He ex  
pressly declares himseif to be the Prince of this  
world and the Sen of God. He spoke as one  
basing authority not only to bis disciples, but to  
his mother, his Judges. and to Pilate, the Roman  
governor. to John the Baptist, bis precursor. And  
there is not, in the four Gospels, onc act, nor one  
word recorded of him (excepting in his commun-  
| ion with God,) that was not a direct or implied  
| assertion of authority. He said to his disciples  
(Matt xii. 29,) ‘ learn of me for lam meek and  
| lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls.”  
But where did he ever say, learn of me, for | am  
teme and abject. There is certainly nothing  
more strongly marke in the precept and example  
| of Christ. than the principle of stubborn and _ in-  
flexible resistance against the impulses of others to  
| evil. He tanght his disciples to renounce every  
thing that is counted enjoyment upon earth: to  
| take their cross, and suffer all ill treatment, per-  
secution and death, for his sake.—What eise is  
the Book of Acts, than a record of the faithfulness  
| with which these chosen ministers of the gospel  
| carried these injonctions of the gospel into execu-  
| tion? In the conduct and speeches of Stephen and  
| Peter, of John or of Paul, is there any thing indi-  
cating a resemblance to the second class of  
}  
  
  
  
characters, into which Dr. Paley divides all man-  
} kind? If there is a character on historical record,  
| distinguished by a bold, intrepid, tenacious end  
inflexible spirit, it is that of St. Paul.  
  
It was to such characters only, that the com-  
mission of teaching could be committed, with cer-  
tainty of success. Observe the expression of Christ  
to Peter, (Matt. x. 18.) “And I say untp thee, that  
thou art Peter, (a rock,) and upon this rock I will  
build my church, and the gates of hell shall not  
prevail against it.” Dr. Paley’s Christian is one  
of those drivellers, whe to use a vulgar adage, can  
never say No to any body. The true Christian is  
the ** Justum el fenacem proposili”” of Horace.  
The combination of those qualities so essential to  
the heroic character, with those of meekness, low-  
liness of heart, and brotherly love, is what consti-  
tutes the moral perfection, of which Christ gave  
an example in his own life, and to which he com-  
manded his disciples to aspire. Endeavor, my  
dear son, to discipline your heart, and to govern  
your conduct by these principles thus combined.  
—Be meek, be gentle, be kindly affectionate to  
all mankind, not excepting your own enemies,—  
But never he tame or abject: never give way to  
the pushes of imprudence, or show yourself yield  
ing and complying to prejudices, wrong headed-  
ness, or intractability, which would lead or draw  
you astray from the dictates of your own consci-  
ence, or sense of right. —‘** Tili you die let not your  
integrity depart from you.” Build your house  
upon a fock, and then let the rains descend, the  
floods come, and the winds blow and beat upon  
that house, it shall not fall, for it will be found on  
arock. So promises your blessed Lord and Sa-  
viour, and prays your affectionate father.”

‘ection consisted in self subjugation and broth-  
erly love, in the complete conquest of the  
passions, and in the practice of benevolence

there find proved the duty of totally subdu-  
ing the passions. It is sometimes objected  
that this theory is not adapted to the infirmi-

a being so constituted as man, that an earthen  
vessel is not formed to dash against a rock ;

beyond his power. The weakness and frail-  
ty of man itis not possible to deny, is too  
strongly attested by all human experience,  
as well as by the whole tenor of the scrip-  
tures; but the degree of weakness is to be  
limited by the eff rts to overcome it, and not  
by indulgeace to it. Once admit weakness  
is an argument to forbear exertion and it re-  
sults in absuiute impotence, It is also very  
inconclusive reasoning, to infer, that because  
perfection is not absolutely to be obtained, it  
is theretore not be sought. Human excel-  
lence consists in the approximation to perfec-  
tion; and the only means of approaching to  
any term, is by endeavouring to obtain the  
term itself. With these convictions upon my  
mind, and with a sincere honest, effort to  
practice upon them, and with the aid of a  
divine blessing which is promised to it, the  
approaches tu perfection may at least be so  
great as nearly to answer all the ends that

it is too strongly attested by all human experience,  
a,well as by the wiiole tenor of the scriptures, bat  
the degree of weakness ts to be limited, by the ef- So  
Art to overcome it, and nut by indulgence to it.  
Once admit weakness as an argument to forbear ex­

In order to preserve the dominion over our  
own passions, it behoves us to be constantly and  
ytrictly on our guard, against the influence and in­

all necessary m youth. 1 deem it tile more aidis- f ^

Christian duties, there may be and often is great own  
danger.,f lali,tig into error and vice, merely by want S(  
energy to resist the example and enticement of f  
other». On this point, tiie true character ol Chris- wor  
tiun morality appears to have been npsuudcrstoud,  
bvso.ne of its ablest and warmest defenders. In  
Dr. raid&#x27;s **Y tew ot the evidences ot Christianity, &#x27;  
there is a chapter upon the morality of the Gospel, fCrl  
in which there is the following passage : &#x27;-The truth  
is, there are two opposite descriptions of characters  
under which mankind may generally be classed.  
I he one possesses vigor, firmness, resolution, is dar­  
L- i„ ;,,i,.„u r  
mg and active, quick m its sensibilities, jealous of h |,  
r in its attachments, nillcxiule in its ..

its fame,  
purposes, violent in its resentments,  
is meek, yielding, complying, forgiving, not prompt  
to act, but willing to suffer, silent and gentle under  
rudeness and insult, suei ig for reconciliation where  
others would demand satisfaction, giving way to die  
pushes of impudence, conceding and indulgent to  
the prejudices and the intractability of those it lias  
to deal with. The former of these characters is,  
and ever hath been, the favorite of the world. It is  
the character of great men. There is a dignity in  
it, which universally commands respect. I he lat­  
ter is poor spirited, tame and abject. Yet so it hap­  
pened with tiie founder of Curistiaiiity. tiie latter is  
■•lie subject of bis commendation, Ins precepts, Iiis  
example ; and that tiie funner is nu part of its com­  
position.&quot;  
Dr. I&#x27;aley is in this place, adopting the opinion  
of rioaina Jennings, wtiose essay upon the internal  
evidence of Christianity lie very strongly recom­  
mend- ; Imt 1 cannot consider it as au accurate ami  
disccruiug delineation of character, or as exhibiting  
•c correct representation of Christian principles. The  
founder of cbi i-tiamiy dal mdeed pronounce distinct  
and positive blessin  
by no means synonymous  
gs, upon tiie poor in spirit (which  
with the poor spirited) I  
and ttie meek ; but to wuat part of tbe gospel dm  
Dr. Pali y find him countenancing by commendation,  
precept or example, tiie tame and abject ? Tiie  
character which Christ assumed upon lie earth was  
that of Lord ami Master. It was in this character, a  
that his disciples received and acknowledged him.  
Tire obedience that he required was unbounded,  
sminiteiy beyond rviiat was claimed by tile most ab­  
solute Sovereign over bis subjects. Never, for ouc  
luomon&#x27;jdid he recede from tbe authoritative system.  
He preserved it, in washing tiie feet of his disci­  
ples ; lie prunerved it, in his answer to the high  
priest ; he preserved it in tiie very agony of his ex­  
clamation on tiie Cross, •• Father forgive them, they  
He expressly declares  
Know not what they di  
irimseifto be the prince of this world, and tire Son  
of God. He spoke as one having authority,  
only to his disciples, but to his mother and judges ;  
to Pilate tiie Roman Governor, to John tiie Baptist,  
his precursor. And there is not in tiie four Gos­  
pels one act nor one word recorded of him (excep­  
ting in his Communion with Oral) that  
red or implied assertion of authority.  
Ins disciples (Mathew 12th, 2&#x27;Jlh,) &quot; Learn of  
for l am meek and lowly of heart, and yon shall find  
rest to your souls &quot; But where did he ever say,  
learn of me, for i am tame and abject,  
certainly nothing more strongly marked, in the pre-  
cept aud example of Christianity, than ! he principle  
of stubborn and inflexible resistance of tiie impulses  
of others to evil. He taught liis&#x27;discipleg to renouuce  
every thing that is counted enjoyment on eartli ;  
-.0 take up their cross, and suffer all ill treatment,  
persecution, and death tor his sake,  
the Book of Acts, than a record ot the faithfulness,  
with which these chosen Ministers of the Gospel put  
these commands into execution ? In the conduct .mil  
speeches ol Stephen and Peter; of John or of Paul,  
there any tiling indicating a resemblance to the second  
class of characters, into winch Dr. Paley divides  
all mankind ! It there is a character upon historical  
record, distinguished by a bold, iutrepid, tenacious,  
anil inflexible spirit, it is that of St. Paul,  
to such characters only that tiie commission of  
1 inching should be entrusted with certainty of suc-  
cess. Observe the expression of Christ to Peter  
(Matthew loth 23th.) And l say unto thee, that  
thou art Peter (a rock,) and upon this rock I will  
Build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not  
•prevail against it. &quot; Dr. Paley&#x27;s Christian is one  
of those drivellers, who, to use a vulgar adage, can  
never say no to any body. The true Christian is tiie  
jtisnan et lenacempropositi virutn (the mun who is  
just and constant to his purpose.) Tile combination  
of those qualities, so essential to the heroic char­  
&#x27;acter, with those of meekness, lowliness of heart  
and brotherly love, is what constitutes that moral  
perfection, ot which Christ gave an example, in Iiis  
own life, and to which he commanded iiis disciples  
to aspire. Lndeuvor, my dear son, to discipline  
your own heart, and to govern your conduct, by  
these principles so combined. L e meek, be gentle,  
V&gt;ii kindly aücctionntc lo all mankind, nut excepting  
your enemies. But never be tame nor abject • ne-  
ver give way to the pushes of impudence., or show  
yourself yielding of compiymg or prejudices, wroim-

ssions. It is in the Bible you  
must learn these rules and principles. &quot; .  
  
Ifthere isa character upon historical record, dis-  
tinguished by a bold, intrepid, tenacious, and in-  
flexible spirit, it isthat of St. Panl. It was to such  
characters only that the commission of teaching  
could be entrusted with certainty of success. Ob-  
serve the expression of Christ to Peter, (Mat. x, 18.)  
  
“And I say unto thee, that thon art Peter, [a  
rock,] and upon this rock I will build my church,  
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”  
Dr. Paley’s Christian is one of those drivellers, who  
to use a vulgar adage, can never say no to any body.  
The true Christian is the ji-stum et tanacem proposi-  
ti virum, (the man who is just and constant to his  
purpose.) The combination of those qualities, so  
essential to the heroic charaeter, with those of meek-  
ness, lowliness of heart, and brotherly love, is what  
constitutes that moral perfection, of which Christ  
gave an example in his own life, and to which he  
commanded his disciples to aspire. Endeavour,  
my dear gon, to discipline your own heart, and to  
govern your conduct, by these principles so combi-  
ned. Be meek, be gentle, be kindly affectionate to  
all mankind, not excepting yourenemies. But nev-  
er be tame nor abject; never give way to the pushes  
of impudence, or show yourself yielding or comply-  
ing to prejudices, wrong-headedness, or intractabil-  
  
ity, which would lead or draw you astray from the  
dictates of your own conscience or sense of right.  
‘Till you die let not your integrity depart from you.”  
Build your house-upon a rock ; and then let the rain  
descend and the floods come, and the winds blow,  
  
  
  
  
  
tid beat tipon that/hcuse ; it shall not fall, it shall  
| be founded on a rock. So promises your blessed  
| Lord and Saviour, and so prays your affectionate  
father.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
The whole system of Christianity appears to  
have been set forth by its Divine Author in His  
Sermon on the Mount, recorded in the 5th, 6th, and  
7th chapters of Matthew. I intend hereafter to  
make them the subject of remarks much more at  
large, for the present I confine myself merely to  
general views. What I would impress upon your  
mind is infinitely important to the happiness and  
virtue of your life, as the general spirit of Chris  
tianity and the duties which results from it. In  
my last letter, I showed you, from the very words  
of our Saviour, that He commanded His disciples to  
aim at absolute perfection, and that this perfection  
consisted in self subjugation and brotherly love, in  
the complete conquest of our own passions, and in  
the practice of benevolence to our fellow-creatures.  
Among the Grecian systems of moral philosopy,  
that of the Stoics resembles the Christian doctrine  
in the particular of requiring the total subjugation  
of the passions; and this part of the Stoic principle  
was adopted by the academies. You will find the  
question discussed with all the eloquence and in  
genuity of Cicero, in the fourth of his Tusculan  
disputations, which I advise you to read and medi  
tate upon. You will there find proved the duty of  
subduing the passions. It is sometimes objected  
that this theory is not adapted to the infirmities of  
human nature; that it is not made for a being so  
constituted as man; that an earthen vessel is not  
formed to dash itself against a rock, that in yielding  
to the impulses of the passions, Man only follows  
the dictates of his nature; that to subdue them en  
tirely is an effort beyond his powers. The weak  
ness and frailty of our nature, it is not possible to  
deny--it is too strongly tested by all human ex-  
perience, as well as by the whole tenor of the  
Scriptures; but the degree of weakness must be  
measured by the efforts to overcome it, and not by  
indulgence to it. Once admit weakness as an  
argument to forbear exertion, and it results in abe  
solute impotence. It is also very inconclusive reas-­  
oning to infer that because perfection is not abso  
lutely to be obtained, it is therefore not to be  
sought. Human excellence consist in approxima-  
tion to perfection; and the only means of approach  
ing to any term, is by endeavoring to obtain the  
term itself. With these convictions upon the mind,  
with a sincere and honest effort to practice upon  
them, and with the aid of a divine blessing which  
is promised to it, the approaches to perfection may  
at least be so great as to nearly answer all the  
ends which absolute perfection itself could attain.  
All exertion, therefore, is virtue; and if the tree  
be judged by its fruit, it is certain that all the  
most virtuous characters of heathen antiquity were  
the disciples of the Stoic doctrine. But let it even  
be admitted that a perfect command of the pas  
sions is unattainable to human infirmity, it will  
still be true that the degree of moral excellence  
posseased by any individual is in exact proportion  
to the degree of control; he exercises over hime  
self. According to the Stoics, all vice was resolva  
ble into tolly according to the Christian principle, it  
is all the effect of weakness. In order to preserve  
the dominlon of our own passions, it behooves us to  
be constantly and strictly on our guard against the  
influence and intection of the passions of others.  
This caution above all is necessary to youth, and I  
deem it indispensable to enjoin it upon you,-be­  
cause, as kindness and benevolence compriaes the  
whole syatem of Christian duties, there may be,  
and often is, great danger of falling into errors and  
vice merely for the want of energy to resist the  
example or enticement of others. On this point the  
true character of Christian morality appears to me to  
have been misunderstood by some of its ablest and  
warmeat defenders. In Paley&#x27;s View of the Evi­  
dences of Christianity, there is a chapter upon the  
morality of the Gospel, the general tenor of which  
fas of the whole work) is excellent, but in which  
thare is the following passage: &quot;There are two  
opposite descriptions of character, under which  
mankind may generally be classed; the one pos  
sesses vigor, firmness, resolution, is active and  
daring, quick in its sensibilities, jealous of its  
fame, enger in its attachments, inflexible of its  
parposes, violent in its resentment, the other meek,  
yielding, complying, forgiving, not prompt to act,  
but willing to suffer, silent and gentle under rude­  
nees and insults, soing for reconciliation where  
tthers would demand satisfaction; giving away  
to the pushes of impudence, conceding and indul.  
gest to the prejudices, the wrong headedness,  
the intractability of others with whom it has  
to deal. The former of these characters is, and  
ever has been, the favorite of the world; it is the  
character of great men, -there is a dignity in it  
  
which commands respect. The latter is poor  
spirited, tame and abject. Yet, so it has happened.  
that with the Founder of Christianity, the latter is  
the subject of His commendation, His precepts, His  
example, and that the former is so in no part of  
its composition De. Paley in this place adopts  
the opinion of Soame Jennings, whose essay on the  
Internal Evidences of Christianity,&quot; he strongly  
amends; but I cannot consider it eitner as an  
accurate and discerning delineation of character, nor  
as exhibiting a correct representation of Christian  
principles. The founder of Christianity did indeed  
pronounce distinct and positive blessings upon the  
&quot;poor in spirit,&quot; which is by no means synonymous  
with the &quot;poor spirited;&quot; and upon the meek  
but in what part of the Gospel did Dr. Paley find  
Him countenancing by &quot;commendation, by precept  
or example the tame and abject?&quot; The character  
which Christ assumed upon earth, was that of a  
Lord and Master; it was in that character His dis.  
ciples received and acknowledged Him. The obe-  
dience He required was unbounded infinitely beyond  
that which was ever claimed by the most absolute  
earthly sovereign of his subjects; never for one  
moment did He recede from this authoritative sta  
tion; He preserved it in washing the fect of His dis­  
ciples; He preserved it in answer to the officers  
who struck Him for this very deportment, to the  
High Priest, He preserved it in the agony of His  
ejaculation on the Cross, &quot;Father forgive them, for  
they know not what they do.&quot; He expressly de  
clared Himself &quot; the Prince of this world, and the  
Son of God.&quot; He spoke as one having auth  
not only to His disciples, but to His mother, to His  
s to Pilate the Roman Govervor, to John the  
Baptist, His precursor; and there is not in the four  
Gospels, one act, not one word recorded of Him,  
g His communion with God, that was not  
a direct, or implied assertion of authority. He  
said to His disciples, &quot;Learn of me, for I am meek  
and lowly of heart;&quot; &amp;e but where did He ever  
say to them, learn of me for I am tame and abe  
ject? There is certainly nothing more at  
marked in the precepts and example of Christ,  
than the principle of stubborn and inflexible re-  
sistance against the impulses of others to evil. He  
taught His disciples to renounce everything that is  
counted enjoyment upon earth; &quot;to take up their  
cross,&quot; and to suffer ill treatment, persecution and  
death for His sake. What else is the book of the  
&quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; than a record of the faith.  
fulness with which these chosen ministers of the  
Gospel carried these injunctions into execution?  
In the conduct and speeches of Peter, John, and  
Paul, is there anything that could justly be called  
&quot;tame or abject?&quot; Is there anything indicating  
a resemblance to the second class of character into  
which Dr. Paley divides all mankind? If there is  
a character upon historical record distinguished by  
a bold, inflexible, tenacious and intrepid spirit, it  
is that of Paul. It was to such characters only, that  
mmission to &quot;teach all nations,&quot; could be  
committed with certainty of success. Ohserve the  
impression of Christ, in His charge to Peter; (a  
rock) and upon this rock will I build my Church  
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
De. Paley&#x27;s Christian is one of those drivelers,  
who, to use a vulgar phrase, can never say no, to  
anybody. The true Christian is the &quot;Justum et  
tenacem propositivirum&quot; of Horace, (the man wh

solution, is active and daring, quick in its sen-  
sibilities, jealous of its fame, eager in its attach-  
ments, inflexible in its purposes, violent in its

plying, forgiving, not prompt to act, but willing  
to suffer, silent and gentle under rudeness and  
insults, suing for reconciliation where others  
would demand satisfaction; giving away to  
the pushes of impudence, conceding and indul-  
gent to prejudices, the wrong-headedness, the  
intractability of others with whom it has to

LETTER VIII.  
  
The whole system of Christianity appears to  
have been set forth by its Divine Author io his  
sermon on the Mount, recorded in the 5th, 6th,  
and 7th chapters of Matthew.

merely to general views.  
press upon your mind as infinitely important to  
the happiness and virtue of your life, is, the  
general spirit of Christianity and the duties  
In my last letter, I show-  
ed you, from the very words of our Savior, that  
He commanded His disciples to aim at absolute  
perfection, and that this perfection consisted in  
self-subjugation and brotherly love, in the com-  
plete conquest of our own passions, and in the  
practice of benevolence to our fellow-creatures,  
Among the Grecian systems of moral philosophy,  
that of the Stoics resembles the Christian doc-  
trine in the particular of requiring the total sub-  
jogation of the passions; and this part of the  
Stoic principle was adopted by the academies,

en ood is sometimes objected that this theory is  
  
not adapted to the infirmities of human nature;  
that it is not made for a being so constituted as  
man; that an earthen vessel is not formed to  
dash itself against a rock; that in yielding to  
the impulses of the passions, man only follows  
the dictates of his nature; that to subdue them  
entirely is an effort beyond his powers. The  
weakness and fiailty of our nature, it is not pos-  
sible to deny—it is too strongly tested by all hu-  
man experience, as well as by the whole tenor!  
of the Scriptures; but the degree of weakness |

and not by indulgence to it.

it results in absolute impotence.  
inconclusive reasoning to infer that because per-  
fection is not absolutely to be obtained, it is  
therefore not to be sought. Human excellence  
consists in approximation to perfection ; and the  
only means of approaching to any term, is by  
endeavoring to obtain the term itself. With these  
convictions upon the mind—with a sincere and| moembers to adhere to such, the church,” say

to it, approaches to perfection may at least be| rents, as well as the teachings of her pastors,  
so great as nearly to answer all the ends which  
absolute perfection itself could attain.  
ertion, therefore, is virtue; and if the tree be  
judged by its fruit, itis certain that all the  
most virtuous characters of heathen antiquity  
were the disciples of the Stoic ‘doctrine.  
let it even be admitted that a perfect command  
of the passions is unattainable to human infirmity,  
it will still be true that the degree of moral ex-  
cellence possessed by any individual is in exact  
proportion to the degree of control he exercises  
According to the Stoics, all vice  
was resolvable into folly; according to the Chris-  
tian principle, it is all the effect of weakness. In  
order to preserve the dominicn of our own pas-  
sions, it behooves us to be constantly and strict-  
ly on our guard against the influence and infec-  
tion of the passions of others.  
above all is necessary to youth; and J deem it  
indispensable to enjoin it upon you,—because,  
as kindness and benevolence comprise the whole  
system of Christian duties, there may be, and  
often is, great danger of falling into errors and  
vice merely for the want of energy to resist the  
example or enticement of others. were  
On this point the true character of Christian  
morality appears to me to have been misunder-

In Paley’s “View of the Evidences of  
Christianity,” there is a chapter on the Morality  
of the gospe}, the general tenor of which (as of  
the whule work) is excellent, butin which there  
is the following passage: ‘‘there are two opposite  
descriptions of character, under which mankind  
may generally be classed: the one possesses vigor,  
firmness, resolution, is active and daring, quick  
in its sensibilities jealous of its fame, eager in  
its attachments, inflexible of its purposes, viv-  
lent in its resentment: the other meek, yielding,  
complying, forgiving, not prompt to act, but  
willing to suffer, silent and gentle ander rude-  
ness and insults, suing for reconciliation where  
others would demand satisfaction; giving away  
to the pushes of impudence, conceding and in-  
dulgent to the prejudices, the wrong headed-  
ness, the intractability of others with whom it

and ever has been, the favorite of the world; it

whose essay on the “Internal  
Christianity,’’ he strongly recommenda; but I  
cannot consider it either as an accurate and dis-  
cerning delineation of character, or as exhibit-  
ing a correct representation of christian princi-  
ples. The founder of christianity did indeed  
pronounce distinct and positive blessings upon  
the ‘* poor in spirit,” which is by no means sy-

the true character of Christian morality,   
appears to inc to have been misunder­  
stood by sonic of its ablest and Wannest   
defenders. In Paley&#x27;s &quot;View of the Ev­

general tenor of which (as of the whole   
work) is excellent, but in which there is   
the following passage: &quot;There fire two   
opposite descriptions of character under
