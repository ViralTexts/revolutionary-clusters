Philada. Sept. 11. 1755  
Begone, Business, for an Hour, at least, and let me chat a little with my Katy.  
I have now before me, my dear Girl, three of your Favours, viz. of March the 3d. March the 30th. and May the 1st. The first I receiv’d just before I set out on a long Journey and the others while I was on that Journey, which held me near Six Weeks. Since my Return, I have been in such a perpetual Hurry of publick Affairs of various kinds, as render’d it impracticable for me to keep up my private Correspondencies, even those that afforded me the greatest Pleasure.  
You ask in your last, How I do, and what I am doing, and whether every body loves me yet, and why I make ’em do so? In [the first place, I am so well?] Thanks to God, that I do not remember I was ever better. I still relish all the Pleasures of Life that a temperate Man can in reason desire, and thro’ Favour I have them all in my Power. This happy Situation shall continue as long as God pleases, who knows what is best for his Creatures, and I hope will enable me to bear with Patience and dutiful Submission any Change he may think fit to make that is less agreable. As to the second Question, I must confess, (but don’t you be jealous) that many more People love me now than ever did before: For since I saw you, I have been enabled to do some general Services to the Country, and to the Army, for which both have thank’d and prais’d me; and say they love me; they say so, as you us’d to do; and if I were to ask any Favours of them, would, perhaps, as readily refuse me: So that I find little real Advantage in being belov’d, but it pleases my Humour.  
Now it is near four Months since I have been favour’d with a single Line from you; but I will not be angry with you, because ’tis my fault. I ran in debt to you three or four Letters, and as I did not pay, you would not trust me any more, and you had some Reason: But believe me, I am honest, and tho’ I should never make equal Returns, you shall see I’ll keep fair Accounts. Equal Returns I can never make, tho’ I should write to you by every Post: For the Pleasure I receive from one of yours, is more than you can have from two of mine. The small News, the domestic Occurrences among our Friends, the natural Pictures you draw of Persons, the sensible Observations and Reflections you make, and the easy chatty Manner in which you express every thing, all contribute to heighten the Pleasure; and the more, as they remind me of those Hours and Miles that we talk’d away so agreably, even in a Winter Journey, a wrong Road, and a soaking Shower.  
I long to hear whether you have continu’d ever since in that Monastery; or have broke into the World again, doing pretty Mischief; how the Lady Wards do, and how many of them are married, or about it; what is become of Mr. B. and Mr. L. and what the State of your Heart is at this Instant? but that, perhaps I ought not to know; and therefore I will not conjure, as you sometimes say I do. If I could conjure, it should be to know what was that oddest Question about me that ever was thought of, which you tell me a Lady had just sent to ask you.  
I commend your prudent Resolutions in the Article of granting Favours to Lovers: But if I were courting you, I could not heartily approve such Conduct. I should even be malicious enough to say you were too knowing, and tell you the old Story of the Girl and the Miller.  
I enclose you the Songs you write for, and with them your Spanish Letter with a Translation. I honour that honest Spaniard for loving you: It show’d the Goodness of his Taste and Judgment. But you must forget him, and bless some worthy young Englishman.  
You have spun a long Thread, 5022 Yards! It will reach almost from Block Island hither. I wish I had hold of one End of it, to pull you to me: But you would break it rather than come. The Cords of Love and Friendship are longer and stronger, and in Times past have drawn me farther; even back from England to Philadelphia. I guess that some of the same kind will one day draw you out of that Island.  
I was extreamly pleas’d with the Turff you sent me. The Irish People who have seen it, say, ’tis the right Sort; but I cannot learn that we have anything like it here. The Cheeses, particularly one of them, were excellent: All our Friends have tasted it, and all agree that it exceeds any English Cheese they ever tasted. Mrs. Franklin was very proud, that a young Lady should have so much Regard for her old Husband, as to send him such a Present. We talk of you every Time it comes to Table; She is sure you are a sensible Girl, and a notable Housewife; and talks of bequeathing me to you as a Legacy; But I ought to wish you a better, and hope she will live these 100 Years; for we are grown old together, and if she has any faults, I am so us’d to ’em that I don’t perceive ’em, as the Song says,  
  
Some Faults we have all, and so may my Joan,  
But then they’re exceedingly small;  
And now I’m us’d to ’em they’re just like my own,  
I scarcely can see ’em at all,  
My dear Friends,  
I scarcely can see them at all.  
  
Indeed I begin to think she has none, as I think of you. And since she is willing I should love you as much as you are willing to be lov’d by me; let us join in wishing the old Lady a long Life and a happy.  
With her respectful Compliments to your good Mother and Sisters, present mine, tho’ unknown, and believe me to be, Dear Girl, Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant  
B Franklin  
  
  
Sally says, Papa, my Love to Miss Katy.  
  
If it was not quite unreasonable I should desire you to write to me every Post, whether you hear from me or no. As to your Spelling, don’t let those laughing Girls put you out of Conceit with it. ’Tis the best in the world, for every Letter of it stands for something.

young or old. Franklin was captivated by her gaiety of spirit, and  
her devoted affection to himself,—then so far advanced in age, as  
to make the attachment of a young lady a high compliment to his  
mental graces. She seems not to have been a lady of cultivation,—  
hardly one of decent education ; for we find the following rather sus-  
picious comment on her orthography in one of his letters to her. ‘* As

Begone business, for an hour at Jeast, and let  
me chat with my Katy. I have now before me, my  
dear girl, three of your favors, viz., March 3d and  
30th, and May Ist. The first I received before I  
set out on my journey, which held me near six  
weeks: since my return,] have been in such a  
hurry of public affairs of various kinds, as rendered  
it impracticable for me to keep up my private cor-

do, and what I am doing, and whether everybody  
loves me yet. ‘Thank God, I never was better. I  
still relish all the pleasures of life, that a temper-  
ate man can in reason desire, and, through favor, I  
have them all in my power. This happy situation  
shall continue as long as God pleases, who knows  
what is best for his creatures, and I hope will ena-  
ble me to bear with patience and dutiful submission  
any change He may think fit to make which is less  
agreeable. As to the second question, I must con-  
fess (but don’t be jealous) that many more people  
love me than ever did before ; for since | saw you

say Ido; if I could conjure it, it would be to  
know what was that oddest question about me  
that ever was thought of, which you tell me a  
lady has just sent to ask you.  
  
I commend your prudent resolution in the arti-

courting you I could not heartily approve such con

duct; I should be even malicious enough to say  
you were too knowing, and tell you the old story  
of the girl and the miller. Ienclose you the song,  
and with your Spanish letter a translation. I honor  
that honest Spaniard for loving you ; it shows the  
goodness of his taste and judgment ; but you must  
forget him, and bless some worthy young English-  
man. You have spun a long thread, 502 yards—  
it would reach almost from Bustle Island. 1 wish  
[ had hold of one end of it to pull you to me; but  
you would break it rather than come ; the cords of  
love and friendship are loriger and stronger, and in  
times past have drawn me further, even from Eng-  
land to Philadelphia. I guess that some of the  
same kind will one day draw you out of that island.  
  
I was extremely pleased with the turf you sent  
me; the Irish people who have seen it say ‘tis of  
the right sort, but 1 cannot learn that we have any-  
thing like it here. The cheeses, particularly one  
of them, were excellent ; all our friends have tasted  
it, and agree that it excels any English cheese they  
have ever tasted. Mrs. Franklin was very proud  
that a young lady should have so much regard for  
her old husband as to send him such a present.  
We talk of you every time it comes to the table.  
She is sure you are a sensible girl and a notable  
housewife, and talks of bequeathing me to you as  
a legacy ; but I ought to wish you a better, and  
hope she will live these hundred years ; for we are  
grown old together, and if she has any faults, |  
am so used to ’em, that I don’t perceive ‘em ; as  
the song says—  
  
Some faults have we all, and so may my Joan,  
But then they ’re exceedingly small,  
  
And now Iam used, they are just like my own,  
I can scarcely see ’em at all.  
  
My dear friend, I can scarcely see ‘em at all; in-  
deed, I begin to think she has none. As I think of  
you, and as she is willing I should love you as much  
  
as you are willing to be loved by me, let us join in  
  
wishing the old lady a long and happy life.  
  
Sally says, ‘“‘ Papa, my love to Miss Katy.”’  
Don’t let those laughing girls put you out of con-  
ceit with your spelling ; ’t is the best in the world,  
for every letter stands for something.

Now it is near four months since I have been  
favored with a single line from you; but I will not  
be angry with you, because it is my fault. I ran  
in debt to you three or four letters, and, as I did  
not pay, you would not trust me any more, and  
you had some reason. But, believe me, I am hon-  
est, and, though I should never make equal re-  
turns, you shall see I will keep fair accounts.  
Equal returns I can never make, though I should  
write to you by every post; for the pleasure I re-  
ceive from one of yours is more than you can have  
from two of mine. The small news, the domestic  
occurrences among our friends, the natural pic-  
tures you draw of persons, the sensible observa-  
tions and refiections you make, and the easy,  
chatty manner in which you express every thing,  
all contribute to heighten the pleasure; and the  
more as they remind me of those hours and miles  
that we talked away so agreeably, even in a win-  
ter journey, a wrong road, and a soaking shower.
