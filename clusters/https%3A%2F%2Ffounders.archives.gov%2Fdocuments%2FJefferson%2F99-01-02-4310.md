d the Continent of North America to the Pacific  
Ocean, and sufficiently explored the interior of the country to affirm with confidence that we have discovered the most  
practicable rout which dose exist across the continent by means of the navigable branches of the Missouri and Columbia  
Rivers. such is that by way of the Missouri to the foot of the rapids, five miles below the great falls of that river a  
distance of 2575 miles, thence by land passing the Rocky Mountains to a navigable part of the Kooskooske 340; with the  
Kooskooske 73 mls. a South Easterly branch of the Columbia 154 miles and the latter river 413 mls. to the Pacific Ocean;  
making the total distance from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi to the discharge of the Columbia into the  
Pacific Ocean 3555 miles. the navigation of the Missouri may be deemed safe and good; it’s difficulties arrise from it’s  
falling banks, timber imbeded in the mud of it’s channels, it’s sand bars and steady rapidity of it’s current, all which  
may be overcome with a great degree of certainty by taking the necessary precautions. the passage by land of 340 miles  
from the Missouri to the Kooskooske is the most formidable part of the tract proposed across the Continent; of this  
distance 200 miles is along a good road, and 140 over tremendious mountains which for 60 mls. are covered with eternal  
snows; however a passage over these mountains is practicable from the latter part of June to the last of September, and  
the cheep rate at which horses are to be obtained from the Indians of the Rocky Mountains and West of them, reduces the  
expences of transportation over this portage to a mere trifle. The navigation of the Kooskooske, the South East branch of  
the Columbia itself is safe and good from the 1st. of April to the middle of August, by making three portages on the  
latter; the first of which in descending is that of 1200 paces at the great falls of the Columbia, 261 mls. from the  
Ocean, the second of two miles at the long narrows, six miles below the falls, and the 3rd. also of 2 miles at the great  
rapids 65 miles still lower down. the tides flow up the Columbia 183 miles, or within seven miles of the great rapids,  
thus far large sloops might ascend in safety, and vessels of 300 tons burthen could with equal safety reach the entrance  
of the river Multnomah, a large Southern branch of the Columbia, which taking it’s rise on the confines of Mexico with  
the Callarado and Apostles rivers, discharges itself into the Columbia 125 miles from it’s mouth.—from the head of tide  
water to the foot of the long narrow the Columbia could be most advantageously navigated with large batteaux and from  
thence upwards by perogues.

has permitted, we have discovered the best  
route which does exist across the continent of  
North America in that direction. Such is that  
by way of the Missouri to the foot of the ra-  
pids below the great falls of that river, a dist-  
ance of 2575 miles; thence by land passing  
by the Rocky Mountains to a navigable part  
of the Kooskeoske, 340 ; and with the Koos-  
kooske 73 miles, Lewis’s river 154 miles, and  
the Columbia 413 miles to the Pacific Ocean ;  
making the total distance from the confluence  
of the Missouri and Mississpi to the discharge  
of the Columbia into the Pacific Ocean 3,554  
miles. The navigation of the Missouri may  
be deemed good ; its difliculties arise from its  
falling banks, timber embedded in the mud of  
its channels, its sand-bars, and steady rapidity  
of its current; all which may be overcome,  
with a great degree of certainty, by usiug the  
necessary precantions. The passage by Jand of  
  
(374  
  
340 miles, from the falls of the Missouri to  
the Kooskooske, is the inostformidable part of  
the track proposed across the continent. Of  
this distance 200 mites is along a good road,  
140 miles over tremendous mouritains, which  
for 60 miles are covered with eternal snows. A  
passage over these mountains is, however prac-  
ticable from the latter part of June to the ast  
of September ; and the cheap rate at which  
horses are to be obtained from the Indians of  
the Rocky Mountaims, and west of them, re-  
duees the expenses of transportation over this  
portage to a merc trifle, The navigation of the  
Kooskooske, Lewis&#x27;s river, and the Columbia,  
is safe and good from the Ist of April to the  
middle of August, by making three portages  
on the latter river; the tirst of which, in de-  
scending, is 1,200 paecs at the falls of Colum-  
bia, 261 miles up that river; the second, of  
two miles, at the Long Narrows, six miles be-  
low the falls ; and a third, also of two miles,  
at the Great Rapids, (15 miles still lower down.  
The tide flows up the Columbia 183 miles,  
and within seven miles of the Great Rapids.  
Large sloops may with safety ascend as high  
as tide water, and vessels of 300 tons burthen  
reach the entrauce of the Multnomah river,

which takes its rise,on the confines of New  
Mexico, with the Callcrado and Apostle’s ri-  
vers, discharging itself into the Columbia, 125  
miles from its entrance into the Pacific Ocean.

more cifectualiy to explore the country, and discover the most practicable  
route which does exist across the continent by the way of the Missouri and  
Columbia rivers. In this we were completely successful, and have there-  
fore no hesitation in declaring, that such as nature has permitted we have  
éiiscovered the best route which does exist across the continent of North  
America in that direction. Such is that by way of the Missouri to the foot  
of the rapids below the great falls of that river, a distance of 2575 miles,  
thence by land passing by the Rocky Mountains, to a navigable part of the  
Kooskooske 340 ; and with the Kooskooske 73 miies, Lewis’s river 154  
miles, and the Columbia 413 miles to the Pacifick Ocean, making the total  
distance from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi, to the dis-  
charge of the Columbia into the Pacifick Ocean 3555 miles. ‘The naviga-  
tion of the Missouri may be deemed good—its difficulties arise from its  
fullme banks, timber imbedded in the mud of its channel, its sand-bars and  
the steady rapidity of its current, all which may be overcome with a great  
degree of certamt) ys by using the necessary precautions. The passage by  
tand of 340 miles from the falls of the Missouri to the Kooskooske, is the  
most formidable part of the tract proposed across the continent. Of this  
distance, 200 mili es 18 along a good road, and 140 miles over tremendous  
gynpountains, which for 60 miles are covered with eternal snows. A passage  
over these mountains is, however, practicable from the latter part of June  
to the last of September ; and the cheap rate at which horses are to be ob-  
tained from the Indians of the Rocky Mountains, and West of them, re-  
duces the expenses of transportation over this portage to a meretrifle. The  
navigation of the Kooskeoske, Lewis’s river, and the Columbia, is safe and

Ocean, making the total distance, from the confluence of the

its difficulties arise from its falling banks, timber imbedded in

practicable from the latter part of June to the last of September;  
and the cheap rate at which horses are to be obtained from the

the expences of transportation over this portage to a mere trifle.  
The navigation of the Kooskooske, Lewis’s river, and the Co-

August, by making three portages on the latter river; the first  
of which, in descending, is twelve hundred paces at the falls of
