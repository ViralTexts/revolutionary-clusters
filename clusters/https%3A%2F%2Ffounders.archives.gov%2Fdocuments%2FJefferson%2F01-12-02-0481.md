Versailles, December 29. 1787.  
  
I have the honour, Sir, to send you a copy of an Arret passed in Council, for encouraging the Commerce of the United States of America in France. I shall furnish you with a number of others as soon as they shall be printed.  
You will therein see that several considerable favors, not before promised to the American Commerce, have been added to those which the king announced to you, in the letter addressed to you on the 22d. of october of the last year.  
If in the mean time any duties have been levied, contrary to the  intentions of that letter, they shall be repaid on sight of the vouchers.  
I have also ordered a verification of the facts whereon it was represented to you, that the decision of the 24 of may 1786, relative to the Commerce of tobacco, had not been fully executed. Be assured that if it shall appear that engagements have been evaded, which were taken under the sanction of the king, effectual provision shall be made for their scrupulous fulfillment.  
You will learn also with pleasure that the measures I have taken to prevent the interruption of the Commerce of tobacco, have had full success.  
This commodity shall not be excepted from among those to which the right of entrepot is given. The farmers general shall have no preference in the purchases, the proprietors shall be perfectly masters of their speculations, and free to export their tobaccoes by sea to foreign countries.  
Measures only must be taken to prevent those frauds to which the entrepot might serve as a pretext; and the chambers of commerce for the ports shall be consulted, in order that the precautions necessary for this purpose, may not be in a form incompatible with that liberty which Commerce ought to enjoy in its operations.  
Although the present stock of the farmers general amounts to about three years consumption I have engaged that company to continue to purchase yearly from the 1st day of january 1788. to the end of their lease fourteen thousand hogsheads of tobacco brought directly into the ports of France in French or American bottoms, and to shew at the end of every four months that their purchases amount to four thousand six hundred and sixty six hogsheads.  
As to the prices, you have been sensible yourself of the necessity of leaving them free; and this freedom of price was the principal object of the applications of the American and French merchants when they complained of the contract of M. Morris.  
The determination then taken to force the purchases of tobacco, tho at high prices, insomuch that the farmers general now find themselves possessed of three years provision, shews that the interests of the planters and merchants of the United States of America have ever been precious to the King.  
The arret of Council herein inclosed, and the other regulations which I have the honour of communicating to you, are a further  confirmation of a truth tending somuch to strengthen the bands which unite the two nations.  
I have the honour to be with a very sincere and inviolable attachment, Sir, your most humble and most obedient servant.  
  
Signed Lambert.

Verfailles, Dec, 29, 1737.  
  
HAVE the honour, fir, to fend  
  
you a copy of an arret, pafled in  
council, for encouraging the com-  
merce of the united flates of America  
in France. I fhall furnith you with  
a number of others, as foon as they  
fhall be printed.  
  
You will therein fee, that feveral  
confiderable favours, not before pro-  
mifed to the American commerce,  
have been added to thofe which the  
king announced to you, in the letier  
addreffed to you onthe 22d of Odto-  
ber of the laft year.*  
  
If in the mean time any duties  
have been levied, contrary to the in-  
tentions of that letter, they fhall be  
repaid, on fight of the vouchers.  
  
1 have alfo ordered a verification  
of the facts whereon it was repre-  
  
“fented to you, that the decifion of  
24th of May, 1786, relative to the  
commerce of tobacco, had not been  
fully executed. Be affured, that if it  
fhall appear, that engagements have  
been evaded, which were taken un-  
der the fanction of the king, effeciu-  
al provifion fhall be made for their  
fcrupulous fulfilment.  
  
You will learn alfo with pleafure,  
that the meafures I have taken,to pre-  
vent the interruption of the commerce  
of tobacco, have had full fuccefs,  
  
This commodity fhall not be ex-  
cepted from among thofe to which  
the right of entrepot is given. The  
farmers-general fhall have no prefer-  
  
ROTE.  
  
* See American Mufeum, Vol. I.  
p- 224, of the firft edition; and  
page 200, of the fecond.  
  
ence in the purchafes: the propri.  
etors fhall be perfeétly maflers of  
their fpeculations---and free to ex.  
port their tobaccos by fea to foreign  
countries.  
  
Meafures only muft be taken to  
prevent thofe frauds to which the ep-  
trepot might ferve as a pretext : and  
the chambers of commeice for the  
ports fhall be confulted, in order  
that the precautions neceflary for  
this veep may not be in a form  
incompatible with that liberty which  
commerce ought to enjoy in itsope-  
rations.  
  
Although the prefent ftock of the  
farmers-general amounts to about  
three vears confuntption, I have ep.  
gaged that company to continue to  
purchafe yearly, from the 1ft of Ja.  
nuary, 1788, to the end of their  
leafe, fourteen thoufand hogtheady  
of tobacco, brought direétly inio the  
ports of France, in French or Ame.  
rican bottoms; and to fhew, at th  
end of every four months, that their  
purehafes amount to four thoufani  
fix hundred and fixty-tix hogf.  
heads.  
  
As to the prices, you have been  
fenfible yourfelf of the neceffity of  
leaving them free: and this freedom  
of price was the principal objeét of the  
applications of the American and  
French merchants, when they com-  
plained of the contract of mr. Mor.  
ris.  
  
‘The determination then taken,  
to force the purchafes of tobacco,  
though at high prices, infomuch  
that the farmers-general now find  
themielves poflefled of three years pro-  
vifion, fhews that the interefts of the  
planters and merchants of the united  
ftates of America have ever been pre-  
cious to the king.
