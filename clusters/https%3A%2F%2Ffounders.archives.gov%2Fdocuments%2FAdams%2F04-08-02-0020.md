POETRY.  
  
The Fall —Gen. itl. 6.—BY ©. WESLEY  
She saw; she took; she ate;  
  
Death entered by the eye;  
And pailying in a tempted state  
  
They lust, consent, and die.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
But all mankind, restored,  
Their Eden may retrieve:  
  
And lo, by faith we see our Lord,  
We touch, and taste, and live!  
  
Jesus, thou art a tree  
That makes the foolish wise;  
And safely We may feed on thee,  
And feast both heart and eyes.  
  
Wisdom divine Thou art,  
Received through faith alone,  
And when thou didst thyself impart  
We know as we are known.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
DEATH OF MOSES.—pr. warts  
Sweet was the journey to the sky,  
The holy prophet trie od:  
“Climb up the mount,” said God, “and die,”  
The prophet climbed, and died.  
Softly his fainting head he lay  
Upon his maker’s breast,  
His maker soothed his soul away,  
And laid his flesh to rest
