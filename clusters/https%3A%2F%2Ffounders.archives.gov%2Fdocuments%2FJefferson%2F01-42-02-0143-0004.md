In order to bring the members of society together in the first instance the custom of the country has established that the residents shall pay the 1st. visit to strangers, &amp; among strangers first comers to later comers, foreign &amp; domestic;  
When brought together in society all are perfectly equal, whether foreign or domestic, titled or untitled, in or out of office.   
To the 1st. rule there is a single exception. foreign ministers, pay the first visit to the ministers of the nation: which is returned.   
  
  
  
All other observances are but exemplifications of these two principles. e.g.  
  
  
1.  
 The families of foreign ministers arriving at the seat of government recieve the first visit from those of the National ministers, as from all other residents.   
  
  
3.  
 No titles being admitted here, those of foreigners give no precedence.   
  
  
4.  
 Difference of grade among  the diplomatic  members gives no precedence.  
  
  
2.  
 Members of the Legislature &amp; of the Judiciary, independant of their offices, have a right as strangers to recieve the first visit.   
  
  
5.  
 At  public ceremonies to which the government invites the presence of foreign ministers &amp; their families,  a convenient seat or station, will be provided for them with any other strangers invited, &amp; the families of the national ministers, each taking place as they arrive, &amp; without any precedence.   
  
  
6.  
 To maintain the principle of equality, or pêle mêle, and prevent the growth of precedence out of courtesy, the members of the Executive will practise at their own houses &amp; recommend, an adherence to the antient usage of the country, of gentlemen in mass giving precedence to the ladies in mass in passing from one apartment where they are assembled, into another.

‘‘When brought together in society all are perfectly  
equal, whether foreign or domestic, titled or untitled, in  
or out of office.”  
  
Jefferson himself is said to have drawn up the follow-  
ing explanation of the rule;  
  
‘‘No title being admitted here, those of foreigners give  
no precedence, Difference of grade among the diplomatic  
members gives no precedence. At public ceremonies to  
which the Government invites the presence of foreign  
ministers and their families, a convenient seat or station  
will be provided for them, with any other strangers in-  
vited, and the families of the national ministers, each tak-  
ing place as they arrive, and without any precedence. To  
maintain the principle of equality—or of péle-méle, and  
prevent the growth of precedence out of courtesy, the  
members of the executive will practice at their own  
houses, and recommend an adherence to the ancient  
usages of the country, of gentlemen in mass giving pre-  
cedence to the ladies in mass, in passing from one apart-  
ment where they are assembled into another.

1, In order to bring members of society to-  
gether in the first instance, the custom of the  
country has established that residents shall pay  
the first visit to strangers, and among strangers  
first comers to later comers, foreigh and domestic.  
  
The character of strangers ceases after the first  
visit. Tothis rule there is asingle exception.  
Foreign Ministers, from the necessity of making  
themselves known, pay the first visit to the Min-  
istors of the nation, which is returned.  
  
2. When brought together in society all are  
perfectiy equal, whether foreign or domestie,  
titled or untitled, in or out of office. All other  
observances are but exemplifications of these two  
principles.  
  
1. The families of forsign Ministers arriving  
at the seat of government receive the first visit  
from those of the national Ministers, as from all  
other residents. ; ~  
  
The members of the Legislaturé and of the  
judiciary, independent of their offices, have a  
right as strangers to receive the first visit.  
  
‘2. No title being admitted here, those of  
foreigners give no precedence. Differences of  
grade among the diplomatic members give no  
precedence. |  
  
_ At public ceremonies to which the government  
invites the presence of foreign Ministers and  
their families, a convenient place or station will  
be provided for them, with any other strangers  
invited, and the families ofthe national Munis-

any precedence.
