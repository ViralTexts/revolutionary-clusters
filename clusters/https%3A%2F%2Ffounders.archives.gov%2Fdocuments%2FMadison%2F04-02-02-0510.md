Sir  
Ocr. 1822  
  
The enclosed Resolutions of the Agricultural Society of Albemarle explain the wish of the Society to provide for Agriculture, the advantage of a Professorship to be incorporated into the University of Virginia; the  
  
means proposed for making the provision, and the hope entertained of a general Co-operation in the scheme.  
The present seems to be an important crisis in the Agriculture of Virginia. The portions of her Soil first brought into cultivation have for the most part been exhausted of its natural fertility, without being repaired by a meliorating system of husbandry: and much of what remains in forest, and can be spared from the demands of fuel and other rural wants, will need improvement, on the first introduction of the plough.  
These truths are now sufficiently impressed on the Public attention; and have led to the establishment of the Agricultural Societies among us, which are so laudably promoting the work of reform.  
As a further means of advancing the great object, it has occurred to the Albemarle Society, that a distinct Professorship in the University of the State if sanctioned by the proper Authority, might be advantageously appropriated to the instruction of such as might attend, in the theory &amp; practice of rural economy in its several branches.  
To the due success of agriculture as of other Arts, Theory &amp; practice are both requisite. They always reflect light on each other. If the former without the test of the latter be a vain Science, the latter without the enlightening precepts of the former, is generally enslaved to ancient modes however erroneous or is at best but too tardy &amp; partial in adopting salutary changes. In no instance perhaps is habit more unyielding, or irrational practice more prevalent, than among those who cultivate the earth: And this is the more to be lamented as Agriculture is Still so far below the attainments to which it may fairly aspire.  
A professorship of agriculture in the University might derive special advantages from the lights thrown out from the Chair of Chemistry in that Institution. This Science is every day penetrating some of the hidden laws of nature, and tracing the useful purposes to which they may be made subservient. Agriculture is a field on which it has already begun to shed its rays, and on which it promises to do much towards unveiling the processes of nature to which the principles of Agriculture are related. The professional Lectures on Chemistry which are to embrace those principles could not fail to be auxiliary to a professorship having lessons on Agriculture for its essential charge.  
The fund contemplated for the support of such a professorship is to consist of a sum drawn from unexpended subscriptions, from special donations, and from a diffusive contribution not exceeding a dollar from an individual. It is hoped, that for a purpose of such general utility, the number of contributors will more than make up for the smallness of the respective sums: and that with the other resources, means may be gathered not only adequate to the immediate views entertained; but justifying an enlargement of them.  
  
Should this prove to be the case, it will be an improvement of the plan of Agricultural instruction to provide and place under the superintendance of the Professor a small farm in the vicinage, to be cultivated partly as a pattern farm illustrating practically a system at once profitable &amp; improving; partly as an experimental farm, not only bringing to the test new modes of culture &amp; management, but introducing new plants &amp; animals deemed worthy of experiment. In obtaining these, aid might be found in the patriotic attention of the public &amp; private naval commanders in their visits to foreign Countries: And it might well happen that occasional successes in rearing new species or varieties, of peculiar value, would yield in seeds &amp; stocks a profit defraying the expences incurred on this head.  
A farm exhibiting an instructive model, observed as it would be by occasional visitors, and understood as it wd. be in its principles &amp; plans, by students returning to their dispersed homes, would tend not a little to spread sound information on the subject of Agriculture &amp; to cherish that spirit of imitation &amp; emulation which is the source of improvement in every Art &amp; enterprize.  
You will oblige, Sir, the Society of Albemarle by laying this communication before that over which you preside; and by transmitting its sentiments thereon; which will afford particular pleasure if they should accord with the views of this Society and promise so valuable a co operation in carrying them into effect.  
By order of the Society

October SI, 1822.  
Sin—The enclosed resolutions of the  
Agricultural Society of Albemarle; explaii  
the wish of the society to provide for a­  
gricullure the advantage of a professor­  
ship, to be incorporated in the Universit)  
of Virginia ; the means proposed for ma­  
king the^provision ; and the hope enter­  
tained of a general co-operation in the  
scheme.  
The present seems to be an important  
crisis in the Agriculture of Virginia. The  
portions of her soil first brought into cul­  
tivation, have, for the most part, been ex­  
hausted of its natural fertility without  
being repaired by a meliorating system o!  
husbandry ; and much of what remains in  
forest and can be spared from the de­  
mands of fuel and other rural wants, will  
need improvement, on the first introduc­  
tion of the plough.  
These truths are now sufficiently im­  
pressed on the public attention ; and have  
led to the establishment of the Agricultu­  
ral Societies among us, which are so lau­  
dably promoting the work ot reform.  
As a further means of advancing the  
great object, it has occurred to the Albe­  
marle Society, that a distinct professorship  
in the University of the State, it sanction­  
ed by the proper authority, might be ad  
vantageously appropiiated to the instruc­  
tion ot such as might attend, in the theor&gt;  
and practice ot rural economy, in its se­  
  
veral branches.  
To the due success ot agriculture, as 01  
other arts, theory and practice are both  
requisite. They always reflect light on  
each other. It the tormer, without the  
test ot the latter.be a vain science; the&#x27;  
latter, without the enlightening precepts ot  
the tormer, is generally enslaved to an­  
cient modes, however erroneous, or is at  
best but loo tardy and partial in adopting  
, salutary changes. In no instance, per­  
haps, is habit more unyielding, or irra­  
tional practice more prevalent, than among  
those who cultivate the earth- And this  
is the more to be lamented, as agriculture  
is still so tar below the attainments to  
which it may fairly aspire.  
A proteisorship ot agriculture might de­  
rive special adyautage from the lights  
thrown out from the chair of chemistry in  
that institution. This science is every  
day penetrating some of the hidden laws  
of nature, and tracing the useful purposes,  
to which they may be made subservient  
Agriculture is a field on which it has al- j  
ready begun to shed its rays, and on which  
it promises to do much towards unveiling  
the processes of nature to which the prin­  
ciples of agriculture are related. Jbe!  
professional lectures on chemistry, which  
are to embrace those principles, could not  
fail to be auxiliary to a professorship hav­  
ing lessons on agriculture for its essential  
charge.  
The fund contemplated dor the support !  
of such a professorship, is to consist of a j  
sura drawn from unexpended subscriptions,  
from special donations, and from a diffu- i  
sive contribution not exceeding a dollar  
i from an individual. It is hoped, that for  
a porpose of such general utility, the num­  
ber of contributors will more than make  
up for the smallness ot the respective sums;  
and that with the other resources, means  
may be gathered not only adequate to the  
immediate views entertained ; but justi­  
fying an enlargement ot them  
  
Should thi* prove to be the case, it will  
be an improvement ot the plan of agricul­  
tural instruction, to provide and place un­  
der the superintendance of the Professor,  
a small farm in the vicinage to he cultiva­  
ted partly as a pattern farm illustrating  
practically a system at once profitable and  
improving,partly as an experimental tan«&gt;,  
j not only bringing to the test new modes ot  
culture atid management, but introducing  
new plants and animals deemed worthy of  
experiment. In obtaining the^e aid might  
be found in the patriotic attention of the  
public and private Naval Commanders,  
in their visits to foreign countries; and it  
might well happen that occasional succes­  
in rearing new species or varieties, ot pe  
cuiiar value would yield in seeds and  
stocks a profit delraying the expences in­  
curred on this head.  
A larra ezhiti mg au instructive model,  
observed as it would be by occasional vi­  
sitors, and understood as it would be in its  
principles and plans, by students return­  
ing to their dispersed homes, would tend  
to spread sound information on the subject  
ol agriculture, and to cherish that spirit ot  
imitation and emulation which is the  
source of improvement in every art and  
enterprize.  
• You will oblige, Sir, the society of Al­  
btrmarle, by laying this communication  
before that over which you preside ; and  
by transmitting its sentimeots thereon ;  
which will afford particular pleasure, il  
they should accord with the views of this

Sir, * ; ;  
- The enclosed Resolutions of the Agricultu-  
“yal Society of Albemarle, explain the wish of  
the Society to provide for Agriculture the ad-  
a Professorship, to be incorporated  
in the University of Virginia ; the means pro-  
posed for making the provision ; and the hope  
entertained, of a general co-operation in the  
scheme.  
The present seems to be an important cri-  
sis in the Agriculture of Virginia. The por-  
  
_ tion of her soil,-first brought into cultivation,  
  
has, for the most part, been exhausted of its  
natural fertility, without being repaired. by a  
meliorating system of husbandry: and much  
of what remains in forest and can be spared  
from ‘the. demands of fuel and other rural  
wants, willneed improvement, on the first in-  
troduction of the plough.  
  
These truths are now’sufficiently impressed  
on the public attention; and haveled to the  
éxtablidhinent of the Agricultural Societies  
among us, which are so laudably promoting  
the work of reform. |  
  
Asa further means of advancing the great  
object, it has occurred to the Albemarle Seci-  
ety, thata distinct Professorship in the Uni-  
versity of the State, if sanctioned by the pro-  
per authority, might be advantageously ap-  
propriated to theinstraction of such as_might  
attend, in the theory and practice of rural  
  
economy, in its several branches.  
‘To the due success of agriculture, as of  
other arts, theory and nee are both requi-  
ect light on each other.  
If the former, without the test of the latter, be  
  
a vain science ;: the latter, without the enlight- || -  
  
ened precepts of the former, is generally en-  
‘slaved to ancient modes, however erroneous,  
or is at-best but too tardy and partial in adopt-

j.x The enclosed Resolutions of the  
Agricultural Society of Albemarle, explain  
the wish of the Society to provide for Ag­  
riculture the advantage of a l’rofcssor»hij,  
to be inccrpurated in the University «&gt;i  
Virginia; the means proposed for nr. king  
the provision; and the hope entertained of  
a general co-operation in the scheme.  
The present seems to be an important  
crisis in the Agriculture ol Virginia. 1 he  
portions of her soil first brought into culti­  
vation, have,fbr the most part,been exhaus­  
ted of its natural fertility, without being  
repaired by a meliorating system of hus­  
bandry; and much of what remains in for­  
  
rst can he spared Acrr. the demands of  
luel and other rural Wf nts, will need im­  
provement, on the first introduction of  
the plough.  
These tniths are now sufficiently im­  
pressed on the public attention; and have  
led to the establishment of the Agricultu­  
ral Societies among* us which are so lauda­  
bly promoting the work of reform.  
As a further means of advancing the  
great object, it has occurred to the Albe­  
marle Society, that a distan t Professor­  
ship m the University&quot; of the State, if  
sanctioned by the proper authority, might  
be advantageously appropriated to the&#x27;m­  
stnicticn o| such as might attend, in the  
theory and practice ol rural economy, ni  
its several branches.  
To the due success of agriculture, as of  
oilier arts, theory and practice are both  
requisite. They always reflect light on  
each other. If the former, without the  
teSt of the latter, be a vain science; the  
latter without the enlightening precepts of  
the former, is generally enslaved to an­  
cie t modes, however men ecus, or is at  
best but t, o tardy and partial in adopting  
salutary changes.—In no instance, per­  
haps, is hallt more unyielding, or irration­  
al practice more prevalent-, than among  
those who cultivate the earth. And this  
is the more to be lamented, as agriculture  
is still so far below the attiir.rnents to  
which it may fairly aspire.  
A prolessorship ol agriculture might de­  
rive special advantage from the lights  
thrown out 1‘rcm the chair ol Chemistiy in  
that Institution. This science is every  
day penetrating seme of the hidden laws  
ol natuie, and tracing the useful mimeses  
  
to which they may he made subservient.  
Agricultbre is a field on which it has al­  
ready begun to shed its ray s, and on  
which it promises to do much towards  
unveiling the processes ol nature to which  
the principles of agriculture are related.  
The proiessional lectures on chemistry,  
which are to embrace the se principles  
could not tail to be auxiliary to a profes­  
sorship hating lessons on agriculture for  
its e-sebtiai eharge.  
The fund contemplated for the support  
of such a professorship, is to consist ol a  
sum drawn from unexpended subscrip­  
tions, Ifohi special donations, and from a  
dihusive contribution not exceeding a dol­  
lar Irum an individual. It is hoped, that  
for a purpose of such general utility, the  
number of contributions will more than  
make up lor the Smallness of the respec­  
tive sums; and that with the other resour­  
ces. means may be gathered net only ade­  
quate to the immediate 4 lews entertained;  
hut justifying an enlargement of them.  
Miouiu tins prove to he the case, it will  
he ail-improvement ol the plan of agricul­  
tural iustniction, to provide and place un­  
der the superiiitendahce of the Professor, a  
small larm in the vicinage to be cultivated  
partly as a pattern iaim illustrating prac­  
tically a system at oix;e profitable and im­  
proving, partly as an experimental farm,  
hot only bring mg to the test new modes of  
culture and management but introducing  
new plants and animals denned worthy of  
expel linehi. In obtaining these aid might  
be louriii in the patriotic ; uuition of the  
public rthd private iSaval Commanders, in  
their »?sffs to loreign countries; and it  
hiight well happen that occasional success  
in rearing hew species or varieties, of pe­  
culiar value would*yield in seeds &amp; stocks  
a profit defraying the c.vj ernes incurred  
&lt;ai this head.  
  
A lain) exhibiting n» instructive model,  
observed as it would I e l»y occasional visi  
tois, and understood as it would be in its  
pimt iples and plans, by students returning^  
to rtf&#x27; u dispersed bonu s, would tend to  
spread sound information on the subject of  
agriculture, and to cherish that spirit of  
imitation and emulation which is..the  
source ol improvement in every art and

I&#x27;lie-ie truth* are now sufficiently impressed on the  
blic attention, and have led to the establishment tin­  
agricultural societies among us, which are so  
niabLy promoting tin* work of reform.  
A* a lurtloT means of advancing the great object, I  
ban occurred to the Albemarle Society itint a die a  
ict professorship in the University of the State, if ]  
net.oiied by the proper authority, might be advan- *  
eeouely appropriated to the instruction of euch a*  
ight attend, in the theory ntid practice of rural

To the due success of agriculture, as of other art&quot;, &#x27; ,j  
*ory and practice are both requisite. They always , ti  
fleet light on each other. If the toriner without s  
test of the latter tie a vain science, the latter, j li  
ithout the enlightening precepts of the former, is  
merally enslaved to ancient modes, however erro ou*.  
or is, at best, too tardy and partial in adopt- ?  
g salutary changes. In no instance, perhaps, is (  
ihit more unyielding, or irrational practice more : v  
evalent. than among those who cultivate the earth; I t  
id this is the more to be lamented, as agriculture is , ?  
ill so far below the attainments to which it may &#x27;  
irly aspire. ; J  
A professorship ol agriculture in the University &#x27;  
light derive special advantage from the light&#x27;s &#x27; j  
rown out from the Charrof Chemistry in that in- : .  
imtion. This science is every day penetrating some 1 j  
the hidden laws of nature and tracing the useful &lt;  
lrposes to wtiich they inay be lu-tde subservient.? ! !  
griculture is a held on which it has already begun j1  
shed its rays, and on which it promises to do much : 1  
wards unveiling the processes of nature to which &#x27;1  
e principles of agriculture are related. The pro- | &#x27;  
siotml lectures on Chemistry, which are to embrace j  
ose principles, could not fail to be auxiliary to a i  
of-ssorship Laving leaeons on agriculture for its es-&#x27;  
ntial charge.  
The fund contemplated for the support of such a  
ofe-soodiip, is to consist of a sum drawn from uncpended  
subscripiions, from special donations and j  
  
from a diffusive contribution not excelling * ,j?m  
from a individual. It is hoped that for a purp.it.f ut
