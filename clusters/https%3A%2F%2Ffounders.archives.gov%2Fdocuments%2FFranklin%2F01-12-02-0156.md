“ When you went from home, Billy. desired  
to take some more of your books than what  
you laid out, so I got him a trunk to take  
them up in: and as the shelves look pretty  
empty, 1 took down the rest and dusted them,  
and had the shelves taken down and put up  
in the south garrets in the new house, and  
Miss Elmer and myself put them up. I took  
all the dead letters and papers that were in  
the garret and put them into boxes, barrels,  
and bags, as I did not know in what manner  
you would have shelves in your room. Now  
this I did for several reasons: one, as it did  
employ my mind and keep me very busy, and  
as the weather was pretty good, and I should  
make room if Mrs. Franklin should come to  
town to stay any time I was ready to receive  
her. Now for the room we call yours: there  
is in it your desk, the harmonica made like  
a desk, a large chest with all the writings that  
were in your room down-stairs, the boxes of  
glass for music and for the electricity, and all  
your clothes and the pictures, as I don’t drive  
nails lest it should not be right. Sally has  
the south room two pair of stairs; in itis a  
bed, a bureau, a table, a glass, and a picture  
she used to have in her room, a trunk and  
books, but these you can’t have any notion of  
The north room Nancy took for her own use,  
and I can’t tell much about it, only it has a  
bed and curtains, and it is kept locked. I  
never saw it but once, I think, except when  
she was ill. The blue room has the har  
monica and the harpsichord in it, the gilt  
sconce, a card-table, a set of tea-china I bought  
since you went from home, the worked chairs  
and screen, a very handsome mahogany stand  
for the teakettle to stand on, and the orna-  
mental china; but the room is not as yet  
finished, for I think the paper has lost much  
of the bloom by pasting of it up, therefore I  
thought best to leave it until you came home;  
the curtains are not made, nor did I press for  
them, as we had a very great number of flies,  
as it is observed they are very fond of new  
paint. The south room I sleep in, with my  
Susannah, a bed without curtains, a chest o

not suit the room by any means. The pat-  
terns of the chairs are a plain horsehair, and  
look as well as a el everybody  
admires them. The little south room I had  
papered, as the walls were much soiled; in  
that is a pretty card-table, and our chairs that  
used to stand in the parlor, and ornamental  
china over the fireplace; on the floor, a car-  
pet I bought cheap for the goodness; it is  
not quite new. The large carpet is in the  
blue room; the fire not made yet. In the  
room for our friends the picture of the Earl  
of Bute is hung up, and a glass. This is but  
a very imperfect account. In the parlor there  
is a Scotch carpet which was found much fault  
with, and your timepiece stands in one corner,  
which is all wrong, I am told; so then I tell  
them we shall have all these as they should  
be when you come home. As to curtains I  
leave it to you to do as you like yourself; or  
if, as we talked before you went away, if you  
could meet with a Turkey carpet I should like  
it, but if not I shall be very easy, as all these  
things are become quite indifferent to me at  
this time; but, since you do so kindly inquire  
what things I want, I will tell you that when  
Mrs, Franklin came to town and went to the  
assembly, Sally had nothing fit to wear suitable  
to wait on her; and as I never should have  
” on in your absence any thing good, I gave  
Sally my new robe as it wanted very little  
altering: I should be glad if you would bring  
me a plain satin gown, a if our cousin  
would make me a little lace of a proper  
width for a cape or two, I should like it as it  
  
was their making, and a light cloak such as |  
a sent for Sally, but it must be bigger than |  
I should have had that, but it was too |  
  
hers,  
small for me. In the north room we sit, as  
it is not quite finished

whether she ever wrote about it or no. Have  
you ever seen Capt. Oney? has he arrived ?  
My compliments to our good Mrs. and Miss  
Stephenson, and all friends as those men-  
tioned. I have counted the panes in the  
doors; there are eight in each door, besides  
the pieces at top the largest size. I will get  
Mr. Rhodes to take measure of the fireplaces  
and the pier fora glass. All the chimneys  
that I have used are very good. I have baked  
in the oven, and it is good. The same man  
lives in [the] house that did where I bought  
it, but I don’t know his name. He paid £26  
a year, but now the lot is taken off, but he’s  
never spoke to me, nor, as he is a Dutchman,  
I have not spoke to him, only to make a  
water-tube for the area. The pest-house is  
not done, nor the steps, as the lot is not set-  
tled. I fear you have not received all my let-  
ters. I told you Mr. Rhodes thought it best  
not to dig a vault, but I shall see him this  
evening if I can, but I don’t go out anywhere  
if I can help it.”  
  
From Sarah, Franklin’s only daughter,  
and afterwards Mrs. Sarah Bache, there are  
fifteen letters to her father. Her portrait  
indicates a fine looking woman, with a larger  
and more comprehensive nature than her  
mother’s, and her letters are consistent with  
this portrait. She is the Sally of Mr

pictures. In the front room, which I  
designed for ? ?, I had the bed which  
you sent from England, a chamber  
mahogany table and stand ; in the room  
down stairs is the sideboard that you  
bespoke, which is very handsome and  
plain, with two tables made to suit it,  
and a dozen of chairs also. I sold to Mr  
Foxcroft the tables wo had, as they did  
not suit the room by any means. The  
pntterns of the chairs are a plain  
horsehair, and look as well as a  
paddusoy : everybody admires them. The  
little south room I had papered as the  
walls were much soiled ; im that is a  
jpretty card table, and our chairs tliat  
used to stand in the parlour, and  
ornamental china over the fire-place ;  
on the floor, a carpet I bought cheap  
for the goodness ; it is not quite new.  
The large carpet is in the blue room,  
tliu fire not made yet. In the room, for  
our friends the picture of the Earl of  
Bute is hung .ip, and a g ass. This is  
but a very imperfect Account. In the  
parlour there is a Scotch caryet which  
was found much fault with, and your  
timepiece stands in one corner, which is  
all wrong, I am told ; so then I tell  
them we shall have all these as they  
should be when you come home. As to  
curtains I leave it to you to do ss you  
like yourself; or if, as we talked  
before you went away, if you could meet  
with a Turkey cavpet I should like it,  
but if not I shall be very easy, as all  
these things are become quite  
indifterent to me at this time ; but,  
since you do so kindly inquire what  
things I want, I will tell you that when  
Mrs Franklin came to town and went to  
the assembly, Sally had nothing fit to  
wear suitable to wait on her, and as I  
never should have put on in your absence  
anything good, I gave Sally my new robe  
as it wanted very little altering ; I  
should be glad if you would bring me a  
plain satin gown, and if our cousin  
Would make me a little lace of a proper  
width for a cape or two, I should like  
it as it was their making, and a light  
cloak such as you sent for Sally, but it  
must be bigger than hers. 1. should have  
had that, but it was too small for me.  
In the north room we sit, as it is not  
quite finished yet, as the doors are not  
up ; we nave a table and chairs, and the  
small book-case, brather John&#x27;s picture,  
and the king and queen&#x27;s picture, and a  
small Scotch carpet on the floor. I  
desire you to remember drinking glasses  
and a large tablecloth or two when you  
come, but I shan&#x27;t want them till then.  
If you should meet with a pair of silver  
canisters I should like it, but as you  
please, everything I have mentioned.  
When I say doors, it is the closet doors  
; they are glazed, but it was unknown to  
me ; they are in your room. I shall  
count the panes and send to you. The  
crane was put up this week, and not  
before ; the rails not done as yet, but  
promised soon to be done. Oh, my child,  
there is great odds between a man&#x27;s  
being at home and abroad ; as everybody  
is afraid they shall do wrong, so  
everything is left undone. Sally is  
still at Burlington. I wrote her that  
Captain Friend would sail this week. I  
hope she writes to you. Captain Oney  
took with him her white satin to have  
made fit to wear again. I don&#x27;t know  
whether she ever wrote about it or no.  
Have you ever seen Captain Oney 1 has he  
arrived ? My compliments to our good Mrs  
and Miss Stephenson, and all friends as  
those mentioned. I have counted the  
panes in the doors ; there are eight in  
each door, besides the pieces at top the  
largest size. I will get Mr Rhodes to  
take measure of the fireplaces and the  
pier for a glass. All the chimneys that  
I have used are very good. I h.ive baked  
in the oven, and it is good. The same  
man lives in [the] house that did where  
I bought it, but I don&#x27;t know his name.  
He paid £26 a year, but now the lot is  
taken off, but he&#x27;s never spoke to me,  
noi, as he is a Dutchman, I have not  
spoke to liim, only to make a watertube  
for the area. The pest-house is not  
done, nor the steps, as the lot is not  
settled. I fear you have not received  
all my letters. I told you Mr Rhodes  
thought it best not to dig a vault, but

laid out, so I got him a trunk to take them up in;  
| and as the shelves look pretty empty, I took down | glasses and a large table-cloth or two when you  
the rest and dusted them, and had the shelves | come, but I shan’t want them till then.  
  
  
  
I sold to Mr. Foxcraft the tables  
  
of chairs also.  
we had, as they did not suit the room by. any  
  
means. The patterns of the chairs are a plain  
horsehair, and look as well as a paddusoy; every-  
body admires them. The little south room I had  
papered, as the walls were much soiled ; in that is  
a pretty card-table and our chairs that used to stand  
in the parlour, and ornamental china over the fire-  
place; on the floor, a carpet I bought cheap for the  
goodness ; it is not quite new. The large carpet is  
in the blue room; the fire not made yet. In the  
room for our friends the picture of the Earl of Bute  
is hung up, and a glass. This is but a very imper-  
In the parlour there is a Scotch  
| carpet which was found much fault with, and your  
timepiece stands in one corner, which is all wrong,  
I am told; so then I tell them we shall have all  
these as they should be when you come home. As  
to curtains, I leave it to you to do as youlike your-  
self; or if, as we talked before you went away, if  
you could meet with a Turkey carpet I should like  
it, but if-not I shall be very easy, as all these  
| things are become quite indifferent to me at this  
| time; but, since you do so kindly inquire what things  
I want, I will tell you that when Mrs. Franklin  
| came to town and went to the assembly, Salley had  
| nothing fit to wear suitable to wait on her; and as  
never should have put on in your absence any-  
thing good, I gave Salley my new robe as it wanted  
very little altering: I should be glad if you would  
bring me a plain satin gown, and if our cousin  
would make me a little lace of a proper width for a  
cape or two, I should like it as it was their making,  
| and a light cloke such as you sent for Salley, but  
| it must be bigger than hers. I should have had  
that, but it was too small for me. In the north  
room we sit, as it is not quite finished yet, as the  
  
| doors are not up; we have a table and chairs, and  
  
|  
|  
  
««* * When you went from home, Billy desired | the small bookcase, brother John’s picture, and the  
  
king and queen’s picture, and a small Scotch carpet  
| on the floor. I desire you to remember drinking-  
  
If you  
| should meet with a pair of silver canisters I should  
| like it ; but as you please, everything I have men-  
| tioned. When I say doors, it is the cleset doors ;  
| they are glazed, but it was unknown to me; they  
are in your room. I shall count the panes, and  
| send to you. The crane was put up this week, and  
| not before; the rails not done as yet, but promised
