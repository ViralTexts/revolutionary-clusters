The troops are to march [  ] at [  ] o Clock and move by the right, making a short halt at the Creek, or run next on this side Clements’s. Every officer, and non commissioned officer will remain with, and be answerable for every man in their platoons. No soldier to be permitted to quit the ranks on any pretence whatever, untill a general halt is made, and then to be attended by one of the officers of the Platoon. When the Vans of the troops arrive in the rear of the hill Z Colo. Febiger will form his regiment into a solid column of a half platoon in front as fast as they come up. Colo. Meggs will form next in Febeger’s rear, and Major Hull in the rear of Meggs, which will form the right column.  
Colo. Butler will form a column on the left of Febeger, and Major Murphy in his rear. Every officer and soldier is then to fix a piece of white paper in the most conspicuous part of his hat, or Cap to distinguish him from the enemy. At the word, march, Colo. Fleury will take charge of One Hundred, and fifty determined and picked men, properly officered, and with their arms unloaded, placing their whole dependance on the bayonet will move about twenty paces in front of the right column by the rout No. 1 and enter the Sally port 6; he is to detach an officer and twenty men a little in front, whose business it will be to secure the Sentries, and remove the abbatis, and other obstruction for the column to pass through.  
The column will follow close in the rear with shouldered Musquets under Colo. Febeger, with General Wayne in person. When the works are forced, and not before, the victorious troops as they enter will give the watch word [  ] with repeated and loud voice, and drive the enemy from their works and Guns, which will favor the pass of the whole. Should the enemy refuse to surrender, or attempt to make their escape by water or otherwise, vigerous means must be used to force them to the former, and to prevent their accomplishing the latter. Colo. Butler will move by the rout No. 2, preceeded by one hundred men with unloaded arms, and fixed Bayonets under the command of Major Steward, who will observe a distance of twenty yards in front of the Column, which will immediately follow under the commd of Colo. Butler with shouldered musquets, and enter the Sally ports C or D. The Officer commanding the above named one hundred men, will also detach a proper officer and twenty men a little in front to remove the obstructions; as soon as they gain the works, they are also to give, and continue the watch word, which will prevent confusion and  
  
mistake. Major Murphy will follow Colo. Butler to the first figure 3, when he will divide a little to the right and left, and wait the attack on the right, which will be his signal to begin, &amp; to keep up a perpetual and gauling fire, and endeavor to enter between, and possess the works a, a. If any Soldier presumes to take his musquet from his Shoulder, or attempts to fire, or begins the battle till ordered by his proper officer, he shall be instantly put to death by the officer next him, for the cowardice and misconduct of one man is not to put the whole in danger, or confusion with impunity. After the troops begin to advance to the works, the stricktest silence must be observed; and the greatest attention paid to the commands of the Officers. As soon as the lines are carried, the officers of Artillery with the men under their command will take possess[i]on of the Cannon, to the end that the Shipping may be secured, and the post at Verplanks point annoyed so as to fecilitate the attack on that quarter.  
The General has the fullest confidence in the bravery, and fortitude of the Corps he has the happiness to command; the distinguished honor confered on every officer, and soldier who has been drafted into this Corps by his Excellency Genl Washington; the credit of the States they respectively belong to, and their own reputation will be such powerful motives for each man to distinguish himself, that the General cannot have the least doubt of a glorious victory; and farther, he solemnly engages to reward the first man who enters the work, with five hundred dollars, and immediate promotion; to the second 400; to the third 300; to the fourth 200, &amp; to the fifth 100 dollars, and will represent the conduct of every officer and Soldier who distinguishes himself on this occasion in the most favorable point of view to his Excellency, who always receives the greatest pleasure in rewarding merit. But should there be any soldier so lost to every feeling, every sence of honor, as to attempt to retreat one single foot, the officer next him is immediately to put him to death, that he may no longer disgrace the name of a Soldier, or the Corps, or the State to which he belongs.  
As General Wayne is determined to share the danger of the night, so he wishes to participate of the glory of the day in common with his fellow Soldiers.

When the head of the troops arrive in the rear of the hill, colonel

Colonel Butler will form a column on the left of Febiger, and

a little in front, whose business will be to secure the sentries, and  
remove the abbattis and obstructions for the column to pass  
through. The column will follow close in the rear with shouldered  
muskets, led by colonel Febiger and general Wayne in person:—  
when the works are forced, and not before, the victorious troops as  
they enter will give the watchword with repeated and  
loud voices, and drive the enemy from their works and guns, which  
will favour the pass of the whole troops: should the enemy refuse  
to surrender, or attempt to make their escape by water or other-  
wise, effectual means must be used to effect the former and prevent  
the latter.  
  
Colonel Butler will move by the route (2), preceded by one  
hundred chosen men with fixed bayonets, properly officered, at the  
distance of twenty yards in front of the column, which will follow  
under colonel Butler with shouldered muskets. ‘These hundred  
will also detach a proper officer and twenty men a little in front to  
remove the obstructions; as soon as they gain the works they will  
also give and continue the watchword, which will prevent confusion  
and mistake.  
  
If any soldier presume to take his musket from his shoulder, or to  
fire, or begin the battle until ordered by his proper officer, he shall  
be instantly put to death by the officer next him; for the miscon-  
duct of one man is not to put the whole troops in danger or dis-  
order, and he be suffered to pass with life.  
  
After the troops begin to advance to the works, the strictest  
silence must be observed, and the closest attention paid to the com-  
mands of the officers.  
  
The general has the fullest confidence in the bravery and forti-  
tude of the corps that he has the happiness to command—the  
distinguished honour conferred on every officer and soldier who  
has been drafted into this corps by his excellency general Washing-  
ton, the credit of the states they respectively belong to, and their  
own reputations, will be such powerful motives for each man to  
distinguish himself, that the general cannot have the least doubt of  
a glorious victory; and he hereby most solemnly engages to reward  
the first man that enters the works with five hundred dollars and  
immediate promotion, to the second four hundred dollars, to the  
third three hundred dollars, to the fourth two hundred dollars, and  
to the fifth one hundred dollars; and will represent the conduct of  
every officer, and soldier, who distinguishes himself in this action,  
in the most favourable point of view to his excellency, whose  
greatest pleasure is in rewarding merit.  
  
But should there be any soldier so lost to every feeling of  
honour, as to attempt to retreat one single foot, or skulk im the  
face of danger, the officer next to him is immediately to put him to  
death, that he may no longer disgrace the name of a soldier, or  
the corps or state he belongs to.

attack of Stony Point  
  
and Major Murphej in his rear. Every offi-!  
oer and soldier is then to fix a piece of white  
paper, on the most conspicuous part of his  
hat, or cap, to distinguish them from the ;  
enemy. At the word march. Col. Febegerj  
will take command ot one hundred and fifty |

their whole dependence upon their bay-1

in front of the right column by the route No. I

officer and twenty men, whose business it |  
will be to secure the sentries, remove the ab- j

and give the watch word; *• The Forts our!

drive the enemy from their works and guns,  
which will favour the passage of the whole.  
Should the enemy refuse to surrender, or at¬  
tempt to make their escape by water or oth¬  
er way, vigorous means must be used to force  
them to the former, and prevent their accom -1  
plishing the latter. Col. butler will move&#x27;  
by the route No 2, preceded by one hundred i  
men w’ith unloaded arms, and fixed bayonets  
under the command of Major Stewart, who  
will observe the distance of twenty yards in

the aforenamed hundred men, will also de¬  
tach a proper officer and twenty men, a little  
in front to remove the obstructions. As soon  
as they gain the works, they are also to give  
  
and continue the watch word, which will pre¬  
vent confusion and mistakes. Major Mur-  
phey will follow Col. Butler to the figure H,  
when he will divide a little to the right,  
which will be his signal to begin, and to keep  
up a perpetual and galling fire and endeavor  
to enter between and possess the works A. A.  
If any soldier presumes to take his musket  
from his shoulder, or at tempts to fire or be¬  
gin the battle, until commanded by his pro¬  
per 0 .) cer, he will be immediately put t &gt; death  
by the officer ue irest to him, for the coward¬  
ice or mistake of one man, is not to put the  
whole into danger or di.sorder with impuni¬  
ty. After the troops [several words miss¬  
ing] advance to the works, the strictest si¬  
lence must be observed, and the greatest at¬  
tention be paid to the commands of the officers.  
As soon as the lines are carried, the officers  
of Artillery, and men under tlieir command,  
will take possession of the cannon to the end  
that the shipping may be secured, and the  
Post or Verplanks Point annoyed as much as  
possible, to facilitate the attack on that quar¬

soldier, who has been dratted by his Excel¬

the last written order Wayne gave before the fight.&quot;

At two o&#x27;clock E. M. Wayne promptly responds that  
he shall be ready at the time mentioned. Ileutan  
Colonel De Fleury takes command of 150 picked

the patriotism and State pride of his troops, Wayne  
adds, by authority of Washington, an offer of $500  
and immediate promotion to the first man entering
