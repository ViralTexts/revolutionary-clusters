To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives  
  
of the United States  
  
  
In pursuance of a measure proposed to Congress by a message of Jan. 18. 1803. and sanctioned by their  
appropriation for carrying it into execution, Capt Meriwether Lewis of the 1st. regiment of infantry was appointed, with  
a party of men, to explore the river Missouri, from it’s mouth to it’s source, &amp;, crossing the highlands by the shortest  
portage, to seek the best water communication thence to the Pacific ocean; &amp; Lieutt. Clarke was appointed second in  
command. they were to enter into conference with the Indian nations on their route, with a view to the establishment of  
commerce with them. they entered the Missouri May 14. 1804. and on the 1st. of Nov. took up their winter quarters near the  
Mandan towns, 1609 miles above the mouth of the river, in Lat. 47°.21’-47&quot; North, &amp; Long. 99°-24’-45&quot; West from Greenwich. on the  
8th. of April 1805. they proceeded up the river in pursuance of the objects prescribed to them. a letter of the preceding  
day Apr. 7. from Capt. Lewis, is herewith communicated. during his stay among the Mandans, he had been able to lay down  
the Missouri, according to courses &amp; distances taken on his passage up it, corrected by frequent observations of  
Longitude &amp; Latitude, &amp; to add to the actual survey of this portion of the river, a general map of the country between  
the Missisipi &amp; Pacific, from the 34th. to the 54th. degrees of Latitude. these additions are from information collected  
from Indians with whom he had opportunities of communicating during his journey &amp; residence with them. copies of this  
map are now presented to both houses of Congress. With these I communicate also a statistical view, procured and forwarded  
by him, of the Indian nations inhabiting the Territory of Louisiana, &amp; the countries adjacent to it’s Northern and  
Western borders, of their commerce, &amp; of other interesting circumstances respecting them.  
In order to render the statement, as compleat as may be, of the Indians inhabiting the country West of the  
Missisipi, I add Doctr. Sibley’s account of those residing in &amp; adjacent to the territory of Orleans.  
I communicate also from the same person, an Account of the Red river, according to the best information he had  
been able to collect.  
Having been disappointed, after considerable preparation, in the purpose of sending an exploring party up  
that river in the summer of 1804. it was thought best to employ the autumn of that year in procuring a knowledge of an  
interesting branch of the river called the Washita. this was undertaken under the direction of mr Dunbar of Natchez, a  
citizen of distinguished science, who had aided, and continues to aid us, with his disinterested &amp; valuable services in  
the prosecution of these enterprizes. he ascended the river to the remarkeable Hot springs near it in Lat. 34°.31’-4.16&quot;  
Long. 92°50’-45&quot; West from Greenwich, taking it’s courses &amp; distances, &amp; correcting them by frequent celestial  
observations. Extracts from his observations, and copies of his map of the river, from it’s mouth to the Hot springs, make  
part of the present communications. the examination of the Red river itself, is but now commencing.

dence with them. Copies of this map  
!ale now pi esenfed to both houses of Con­

ing the territory of Louisiana, and the  
countries adjacent to its northern and  
western borders, of their commerce, and  
&lt;&gt;f other interesting ciicuiustances respec­

In order to render the statement, as  
, Complete as may be, of the Indian* inha- •  
i biting the country west of the Mississip.  
pi, I add Dr. Sibley’s account of those  
i esiding in and adjacent to the territory  
ol Orleans.  
I communicate also Horn the same

communicate also a statistical view, procured and forwarded  
by him, of the Indian nations inhabiting the territory of  
Louisiana and the countries adjacent to its northern and  
western borders ; of their commerce, and of other interesting  
circumstances respecting them.  
  
‘“‘ In order to render the statement as complete as may be  
of the Indians inhabiting the country west of the Missisippi,  
I add Dr. Sibley’s account of those residing in and adjacent  
to the territorv of Orleans.  
  
** T communicate also, from the same person, an account  
of the Red River, according to the best information he had  
been able to collect.  
  
“ Having been disappointed, after considerable preparation,  
in the purpose of sending an exploring party up that river, in  
the summer of 1804, it was thought best to employ the au-  
tumn of that year in procuring a knowledge of an interesting  
branch of the river called the Washita. This was undertaker  
under the direction of Mr. Dunbar, of Natchez, a citizen of  
distinguished science, who had aided, and continues to aid us,  
with his disinterested and valuable services in the prosecu-  
tion of those enterprises. He ascended the river to the re-  
markable hot springs near it, in latitude 34° 31’ 4” 16”, lon-  
gitude 92° 50’ 45” west from Greenwich, taking its courses  
and distances, and correcting them by frequent celestial ob-  
servations. Extracts from his observations, and copies of  
his map of the river, from its mouth to the hot springs,  
  
make part of the present communications. The examina-  
tion of the Red River itself is but now commencing.”

To the-Senate and Houfe of Reprefen-  
tatives of the United States.  
  
IN purfuance of a meafure propofed to Congrefs by a meflage of January  
18th, 1803, and fanctioned by their appropriation for carrying it into execu-  
tion, captain Meriwether Lewis, of the firft regiment of infantry, was ap-  
pointed, with a party of men, to explore the river Miffouri, from its mouth  
to its fource, and, crofling the highlands by the fhorteft portage, to feek the  
beft water communication thence to the Pacific ocean ; and lieutenant Clarke  
was appointed fecond in command. They were to enter into conference  
with the Indian nations on their route, with a view tothe eftablifhment of  
commerce with them. They entered the Miffouri, May rath, 1804, and on  
the firft of November. took up their winter quarters near the Mandan towns,  
1609 miles above the mouth of the river, in latitude 47 deg. 21 min. 47 fec.  
north, and longitude 99 deg. 24 min. 45 fec. weft from Greenwich. On the  
8th of April, 1805, they proceeded up the river in purfuance of the objects  
preicribed to them. A letter of the preceding day, April 7, from captain  
Lewis, is herewith communicated. During his ftay among the Mandans, he  
had been able to lay down the Miffouri, according to courfes and diftances  
taken on his paflage up it, corrected by frequent obfervations of longitude  
and latitude ; and to add to the actual furvey of this portion of the river, a  
general map of the country between the Miffifippi and Pacific, from the 34th  
to the s4th degrees of latitude, Thefe additions are from information col-  
lected from Indians with whom he had opportunities of communicating, dur-  
ing his journey and refidence with them. Copies of this map are now pre-  
fented to both houfes of Congrefs. With thefe I communicate alfo a ftatifli-  
cal view, procured and forwarded by him, of the Indian nations inhabiting  
the territory of Louifiana, and the countries adjacent to its northern and wetft-  
  
ern borders ;-of their commerce, and of other iiterefting circumftances ref  
becting them.

In order to render the ftatement as complete as may be, of the Indians  
inhabiting the country we of the Miffifippi, I add door Sibley’s account  
of thofe refiding in and ad’. sent to the territory of Orleans.  
  
I communicate alfo, from the fame perfon, an account of the Red river,  
according to the beft information he had been able to collec.  
  
Having been difappointed, after confiderable preparation, in the purpofe of  
fending an exploring party up that river, in the fummer of 1804, it was  
thought beft toemploy the autumn of that year in procuring a knowledge of  
an interefting branch of the river called the Wafhita. This was undertaken  
under the direction of Mr. Dunbar, of Natchez, a citizen of diftinguifhed  
{cience, who had aided, and continues to aid us, with his difinterefted and  
valuable fervices in the profecution of thefe enterprizes. He afcended the  
river to the remarkable hot {prings near it, in latitude 34 deg. 31 min. 4 fec.  
16, longitude 92 deg. 50 min. 45 fec. weft from Greenwich, taking its courfes  
and diftances, and correcting them by frequent celeftial obfervations. Ex-  
tracts from his obfervations, and copies of his map of the river, from its  
mouth to the hot fprings, make part of the prefent communications. The  
examination of the Red river itfelf is but now commencing.
