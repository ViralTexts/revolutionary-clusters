[United States, 28 Feb. 1797]  
U.S. Gentln of the house of representatives.  
  
Having maturely considered the bill, to alter and amend an Act intitled an Act to ascertain and fix the military establishment  
  
of the United States, which was presented to me on the 22d day of this month I now return it to the house of Representatives, in which it originated, with my objections.  
First. If the bill passes into a law, the two companies of light dragoons will be from that moment legally out of service, though they will afterwards continue actually in service, and for their services during this interval, namely from the time of legal to the time of actual discharge, it will not be lawful to pay them, unless some future provision be made by law. Though they may be discharged at the pleasure of Congress, in justice they ought to receive their pay not only to the time of passing the law, but at least to the time of their actual discharge.  
Secondly. It will be inconvenient and injurious to the public to dismiss the light dragoons, as soon as notice of the law can be conveyed to them one of the companies having been lately destined to a necessary and important service.  
Thirdly. The companies of light dragoons consist of one hundred and twenty six non commissioned officers and privates, who are bound to serve as dismounted dragoons when ordered so to do: they have received in bounties about two thousand dollars; one of them is completely equipped, and above half of the non commissioned Officers and privates, have yet to serve more than one third the term of their inlistment; and besides there will in the course of the year be a considerable deficiency in the complement of infantry intended to be continued. Under these circumstances, to discharge the dragoons, does not seem to comport with oeconomy.  
Fourthly. It is generally agreed that some cavalry, either militia or regular; will be necessary; and according to the best information I have been able to obtain, it is my opinion, that the latter will be less expensive, and more useful, than the former, in preserving peace between the frontier settlers, and the indians, and therefore a part of the military establishment should consist of cavalry

&quot; Gtntltmrn of the Hostst of Rtpresrnlalires:  
&quot;Having maturely considered the bill to alter i  
amend an act entitled &#x27;An act to ascertain and  
the military establishment of the United Stat

day of this month, I now return it to the House  
Representatives in which it originated, with  
objections.  
&quot;First If the bill passes into a law, the two cc  
panies oflight dragoons will be, from that mom&lt;  
  
legally outof service,though they will afterward* ci  
tinue af/ual/t/ in service; and for their services, dur  
this interval, hamely, from the time of lefal to  
time of actual discharge, it will not be lawful  
pay them, unless some future provision be made  
law. Though they may be discharged at the pit  
ure of Congress, in justice they ought to recr  
their pay, not only to the time of passing the li  
but at least to the time of their actual discharge.  
&quot;Secondly. it will be inconvenient and injurii  
to the public to dismiss the light dragoons as si  
as notice of the law can be conveyed to them, i  
of the companies having been lately destined t&lt;  
necessary and important service.  
&quot;Thirdly. The companies of light dragoops c  
sist of one hundred and twenty-six non-comn  
sioned officers and privates, who are bound to se  
as dismounted dragoons when ordered so to  
They have received, in bounties, about two tho  
and dollars; one of them is completely equipp  
and above half of the non-commissioned officers i  
privates have yet to serve more than one-third  
the time of their enlistment; and besides, there w  
in the course of the year, be a considerable defir.i  
ry in the complement of infantry intended to  
continued. Under these circumstances, to i  
charge the dragoons does not seem to comport w  
economy.  
&quot;Fourthly. It is generally agreed that some ca  
ry, either militia or regular, will be nccensary; a  
according to the best information I have been r  
to obtain, it is my opinion that the latter will be  
nxpensive and more useful than the former, in |  
erring peace between the frontier settlers and
