Mr. Madison. He wished not, he said, to waste a moment of the small portion of time left, by regretting its insufficiency for a full discussion of the subject before the committee. But he thought it due to truth and to the honourable and independent motives of his colleague (Mr. Giles) in proposing the resolutions, to remark that the lateness of the day to which they had been postponed did not justify the strictures which had been made on it. If the delay was not to be considered as unavoidable, some blame at least would fall elsewhere. The enquiries in which the whole business originated, had been moved by his colleague and passed the house some weeks ago. The reports in answer to these enquiries had not been finally made and printed a single day before the present resolutions were submitted to the house. He admitted that it might have been impracticable to report the information called for as early as was desired by the house: He was sensible of the anxiety that would be naturally felt by the officer called upon, to present every consideration that might place his conduct in the most favourable point of view: yet with all these allowances, it was impossible to deny that the reports contained things which did not belong to them, and therefore consumed time which belonged to the period for discussion. He would mention one instance on which there could not possibly be a difference of opinion; viz. the vindication, formally undertaken by the secretary, of the policy of borrowing money abroad. Whether this policy was right or wrong, the legislature had themselves decided in favour of it; and it was the duty of the Secretary in complying with the orders of the house, to inform the house, how the law had been executed, not why it had been made; to explain his own conduct, not to justify that of the legislature.  
It had been asked why the call for information had not been sooner made? The answer was obvious and simple. It was not sooner perceived by the house, that there was such a necessity for it. The want of information was first suggested by the bill for paying 2,000,000 of dollars to the bank although 200,000 only were immediately due, and for authorising another foreign loan to the amount of 2,000,000. From the dawn of light thrown by some circumstances incident to the occasion, on the darkness in which the house had remained, proceeded those doubts and enquiries which had led to the information now possessed. His colleague had great merit in having brought about this development. He had rendered a service highly valuable to the legislature, and no less important and acceptable to the public. One good effect of the information had been, that it prevented the passage of the bill for borrowing 2,000,000 of dollars as an anticipated payment to the bank. The bill had dropt from the hand of its patron with the first light that broke in upon the house. What other measures would have been prevented or varied, if a like knowledge of our funds and finances had been sooner obtained, was matter of serious consideration.  
Another consequence of the reports taken together, was that the face of them presented to his colleague, an evidence of the charges contained in the resolutions. Whether at so late a day it was best to leave the subject as exhibited by the various documents in print, for the examination and opinion of the public, or to press it on the consideration of the house, was a point which every member had a right to decide for himself. His colleague had viewed the positions stated in his motion as too important to be suspended; and as supported by such clear and authentic proofs, that a small portion of time would suffice for the subject. Under this impression, what was his right became his duty; and he had discharged it by offering his resolutions to the house.  
As the house had refused to commit the two introductory resolutions which established the rule of judgment to be applied to the case, and the last also, which declared the inference to be drawn; the task of the committee was limited to a simple enquiry into the facts stated. They were to make out and report a special verdict of these, and leave it to the house to pronounce the proper judgment arising from them.  
The resolution immediately before the committee imported “that the Secretary of the Treasury had violated the law passed on the 4th of August 1790, making appropriations of certain monies,” first, “by applying a certain portion of the principal borrowed, to the payment of interest on that principal”—secondly, “by drawing part of the same monies into the United States, without the instruction of the President.”  
The questions here are questions of fact; and whatever quality may be attached by different gentlemen to the several facts, it would seem as if the facts themselves are too clearly supported by the reports of the Secretary, and the documents attending them to be denied or controverted:  
The law of August 4, 1790, authorised the President to cause to be borrowed 12,000,000 of dollars to be applied to the foreign debt of the United States. A subsequent law of August 12, 1790, authorised another loan of 2,000,000 of dollars, to be applied to the domestic debt of the United States.  
A power to make these loans was delegated on the 28th August 1790, to the Secretary by a general commission in the usual form, referring to the several acts above-mentioned; but without any farther discrimination of the loans to be made. As the law however for applying loans to the foreign object was prior in date, the presumption would rather be that it was to have a priority of execution; that the first money borrowed was to belong to the first object provided for. It was unnecessary however to dwell on this consideration, because the President had removed all uncertainty by the precise explanations and instructions which accompanied the power to the Secretary, and which ought in truth to be deemed a part of the commission.  
The instruction having been more than once read to the committee, he would content himself with referring to it. (The part referred to is in the following words, “I do hereby make known to you, that in the execution of the said trust, you are to observe and follow the orders and directions following, viz. Except where otherwise especially directed by me, you shall employ in the negotiation of any loan or loans which may be made in any foreign country, William Short, Esquire, you shall borrow or cause to be borrowed, on the best terms which shall be found practicable, and within the limitations prescribed by law, as to time of repayment and rate of interest, such sum or sums as shall be sufficient to discharge, as well all instalments or parts of the principal of the foreign debt, which now are due, or shall become payable to the end of the year 1791, as all interest and arrears of interest which now are or shall become due, in respect to the said debt, to the same end of the year 1791. And you shall apply, or cause to be applied, the monies which shall be so borrowed, with all convenient dispatch, to the payment of the said instalments, and parts of the principal and interest, and arrears of interest of the said debt. You shall not extend the amount of the loan which you shall make, or cause to be made, beyond the sum which shall be necessary for completing such payment, unless it can be done upon terms more advantageous to the United States, than those upon which the residue of the said debt shall stand or be. But if the said residue, or any part of the same can be paid off by new loans, upon terms of advantage to the United States, you shall cause such further loans as may be requisite to be made, and the proceeds thereof to be applied accordingly. And for carrying into effect the objects and purposes aforesaid: I do hereby further empower you to make or cause to be made, with whomsoever it may concern, such contract or contracts, being of a nature relative thereto, as shall be found needful and conducive to the interest of the United States.”)—By this formal act issued along with the commission to the secretary, the President designated the object to which the loans to be made, were to be applied; and by declaring the object to be that provided for by the act of August 4th 1790, he expressly placed the loan under the authority and provision of that act; so that the moment the money should be borrowed, it was to stand legally appropriated to its specified object; as much as if another law, authorising another loan, for another purpose had not existed.  
This arrangment of the President was the more proper, not only because provision for the payment of the foreign debt had been the primary object of the legislature, and the payment of the French debt, the anxious wish of their constituents but because payments to France were no longer matter of option, but of strict and positive obligation on the United States. In proof of this, he stated, that the debt to France, calculated to the end of 1791, and computing the livre at 5 4–10 to a dollar, amounted to 4,814,814 dollars, whilst the payments actually made, computing the florin at 2 1–2 to a dollar, amounted to no more than 3,372,717, leaving as a balance at the end of 1791–1,442,097 dollars. Adding to this balance, the instalments due for 1791, amounting to 638,888 dollars—there were to be paid within that year 2,082,985 dollars. The entire payments, however, composed of 656,500 dollars in Europe, and 726,000 put to the account of St. Domingo (although 444,263.83 were actually paid) amounted to 1,382,500 dollars, leaving due at the end of 1791, a balance of 698,485.  
Here he adverted to and read a paragraph in the report of the secretary page 16, where in allusion to the measure of drawing bills in the latter part of 1792, he says “I feel myself the more at liberty to do it, because it did not interfere with a compleat fulfilment of the public engagements in regard to the foreign debt. It could be done consistently with a full reimbursement of all arrears &amp; instalments which had accrued on account of that debt.” Mr. M. observed, that as he could not reconcile this paragraph with the calculations which he had stated, and which were drawn from official documents, he must regard it as an unquestionable error produced by some hasty view of the subject.  
Returning to the commission, Mr. M. repeated that all the money which that instrument, defined and qualified by the instruction annexed to it, authorised the secretary to borrow, was actually and specifically appropriated to the payment of the foreign debt, and under circumstances particularly urgent, in relation to a part of it.  
In what manner had this trust been carried into execution? It was to be observed with regret, that on the very day, on which the commission and instruction issued from the President, the secretary commenced his arrangement for diverting part of a loan, accepted and ratified by virtue of his commission to a purpose different from that specified and required by his instruction. That a fact of so extraordinary a complexion, might be grounded on the most unexceptionable proof, Mr. M. said, he should take the liberty of supporting it by the authority of the secretary himself. Here he read from the secretary’s letter dated August 28, 1790, to the Dutch houses from whom the loan had been accepted, the following passages, viz “I should also wish, for particular reasons that the business may be so regulated as to give it the form of two loans one for two millions under the first act, and the other for one million under the second. But neither about this, am I so solicitous as to be willing that it should constitute an embarrassment.”  
“I destine a million and an half of this sum as a payment to France under the direction of Mr. Short, our chargé des affairs at that court, whose orders for that purpose you will please to follow.”  
The aspect here presented by a comparison of the several documents, was singular and remarkable. The subordinate officer appeared in direct opposition to the chief magistrate. The agent was seen over-ruling by his own orders, the orders of his principal. The language of the president was—By virtue of the power vested in me by law, I destine the money to be borrowed, to the discharge of the instalments and interest of the foreign debt. The language of the secretary was—I destine a part of the money only to that purpose, and a part to be brought to the United States for other purposes. He left every member to make his own reflections on the subject. He would only observe in general that it demonstrated the truth asserted in the proposition that the secretary had violated both the law of August 4th. 1790, and the instruction of the President relating to it.  
He then proceeded to a more distinct view of the two points particularly stated in the resolution.  
The first was “That a certain portion of the principal, borrowed under the act of August 4, 1790, had been applied to the payment of the interest falling due on that principal.” As the fact, would not, he presumed be denied, he forbore to quote that part of the documents, which admitted and authenticated it. He would however, premise to any observations on it, a cursory view of the nature of appropriations.  
It was unnecessary to repeat the emphatic remarks on this subject, which had fallen from the member from Pennsylvania (Mr. Findley). It was sufficiently understood: he concluded that appropriations of money were of a high and sacred character; that they were the great bulwark which our constitution had carefully and jealously established against executive usurpations. He meant only to take notice of the different plans into which appropriations might be moulded, and of the particular operation, which ought to be given to them.  
One of the plans, was that of appropriating specified funds to specified objects; in which the supposed certainty of the funds was adjusted to the supposed importance of the objects.  
The other plan formed all the branches of revenue into an aggregate fund; on which the several objects should have a priority of claim, according to their superiority of importance.  
It was evident, that in both these cases, the legislature alone, possessed the competent authority. The exclusive right of that department of the government to make the proper regulations, was the basis of the utility and efficacy of appropriations.  
There was a third question incident to the doctrine of appropriations, viz. Whether, under specific appropriations, such as had been adopted by Congress, the executive authority could, without special permission of the law, apply the excess of one fund to the aid of a deficient one; or borrow from one fund for the object of another. On this question there might perhaps be a difference of opinion. He would only remark, that admitting such a discretion to be implied in the trust of executing the laws, it would still be requisite that the due sanction of the executive should be given, that a regular account should be kept between the different funds, and that all advances from one to the other should be replaced as soon as possible. This was equally necessary to the preservation of order in the public finances, and to a proper respect for the authority of the laws.  
In the present case it did not appear that the monies taken at different times from the loans designated by the President, and thereby placed under the appropriation of the act of August 4, 1790, to the foreign debt, had ever been replaced. It did not appear that any such replacement was regularly planned or provided for. It was particularly worthy of observation moreover, that the only use within the United States for which any loan in Europe could be assigned, was that of the sinking fund; that the trustees of this fund had never been even informed of the drafts; that if all the monies drawn had been carried to the sinking fund, the limited sum of 2,000,000 of dollars would have been exceeded; and that the statements and accounts had in fact been so wound up, as mentioned by the Secretary, that not a single dollar of the money laid out in purchasing the public debt, had been charged on loans drawn into the United States; altho’ such was the only purpose to which they were legally applicable, and such the principal reason assigned for making the drafts.  
He did not go into a particular proof that the sum drawn into the United States, after subtracting the whole sum placed to a foreign account, exceeded the sum of 2,000,000 of dollars, because the fact had been conceded on the other side, particularly by the statement of the member from Connecticut (Mr. Hillhouse).  
Thus it appeared clearly, in confirmation of the first point, that the application of a certain portion of the principal borrowed in Europe, to payment of the interest, was not a mere transposition of monies, to prevent the sending them backwards or forwards; nor an advance of money from an overflowing fund in favor of a deficient one; but an absolute diversion of appropriated money: and consequently a violation of the law making the appropriation.  
The second point in the resolution, related to the drawing of monies into the United States without the instruction of the President.  
This point had been fully established by the documents and explanations applied to the first. They had done more: They had demonstrated that the instructions of the President which dedicated the loans to be made under his commission, to a foreign object, were an express prohibition of drafts for any domestic object. It was sufficient therefore to refer to the instructions of the President, and to the contradictory steps taken by the Secretary.  
Two attempts had been made to elude the force of these official proofs.  
The first appealed to the President’s speech at the opening of the Session in 1790; to the report of the Secretary made in consequence of it to the house; and to the supplementary act of Congress passed in conformity to the report.  
Had the circumstances involved in this transaction been attended to by those who seemed to rely on it, Mr. M. was persuaded that a reference to it would never have been made by gentlemen on that side. As they had thought fit however to draw arguments from that source, it was proper to give an answer to them; and the best answer would be a naked statement of facts.  
The instruction of the President to the Secretary, was given, as has been seen, on the 28th of August 1790. The letter of the secretary contravening this instruction, was dated, as has also been seen, on the same 28th day of August, 1790.  
The actual drawing of bills by the secretary commenced the 15th of December, 1790.  
The law now pleaded in justification of the conduct of the secretary passed on the 3d of March 1791.  
There are other facts material to a correct and full view of the business.  
  
The speech of the President was delivered on the 8th of December, 1790. It briefly informed the two houses that “a loan of three millions of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place, had been completed in Holland,” and, “That the secretary of the treasury had his direction to communicate such further particulars as might be requisite for more precise information.”  
The consequent report of the secretary recommending the provision in the supplementary act, was not received till the 25th of February, 1791: six days only before the constitutional dissolution of the house.  
In the interval between the speech of the President and the secretary’s report, he had proceeded to draw bills to the amount of 793,392 florins.  
His report, notwithstanding, what had been said of it, contained not a word from which it could be known, that a single florin had been actually drawn over to the United States.  
The other attempt to elude the evidence before the committee recoiled with equal force on the gentlemen who had hazarded it. In the report lately made by the trustees of the sinking fund, is a statement laid before them by the secretary, in which it is noted, “that the acceptance of the loan of three millions of florins, and the application of one third of it to the purpose of that fund, was under the consideration of the President.”  
From this fact it had been inferred, not only that the secretary had withheld no proper information from the trustees, but that the result of the President’s deliberations on the subject had varied the purpose signified by his first instructions to the secretary.  
It happened however most unfortunately for the gentlemen who exulted in this argument, that they had entirely overlooked the dates of the two papers. The paper laid before the trustees, and alledged to have explained the final purpose of the President, was dated on the 25th of August 1790. The paper relied on by the other side, as the final, as well as the most formal, designation of the will of the President, was dated the 28th of August 1790. The gentlemen, therefore, instead of the inference they had made, should have reversed their premises, and joined with their opponents in concluding that the President was led, by a consideration of the subject, not to do what the secretary in his note to the trustees seemed to anticipate, but what had been evinced by the President’s own act of posterior date.  
The second point then, as well as the first, rests on the most solid proofs taken from a collective view of authentic documents.  
Much has been said on the necessity of sometimes departing from the strictness of legal appropriations, as a plea for any freedoms that may have been taken with them by the secretary. He would not deny that there might be emergencies, in the course of human affairs, of so extraordinary and pressing a nature, as to absolve the executive from an inflexible conformity to the injunctions of the law. It was, nevertheless, as essential to remember, as it was obvious to remark, that in all such cases, the necessity should be palpable; that the executive sanction should flow from the supreme source; and that the first opportunity should be seized for communicating to the legislature the measures pursued, with the reasons explaining the necessity of them. This early communication was equally enforced by prudence and by duty. It was the best evidence of the motives for assuming the extraordinary power; it was a respect manifestly due to the legislative authority; and it was more particularly indispensible, as that alone would enable the legislature, by a provident amendment of the law, to accommodate it to like emergencies in future.  
In the proceedings falling under the present enquiry, no necessity appeared for the liberties which had been taken, the money appropriated in Europe being more wanted there than at home. It appeared that the instructions of the Supreme Executive, instead of warranting those liberties, had precluded them. Nor had the proper explanations been disclosed in due time to the Legislature.  
To place the subject in a more distinct point of view, it was proper to advert to the precise authorities and duties of the Secretary, as his office is defined by the act establishing the treasury department. For this purpose Mr. M. read the second section of that act, which is in the words following—“That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the treasury to digest &amp; prepare plans for the improvement and management of the revenue, and for the support of public credit; to prepare and report estimates of the public revenue, and the public expenditures; to superintend the collection of the revenue; to decide on the forms of keeping and stating accounts and making returns, and to grant under the limitations herein established, or to be hereafter provided, all warrants for monies to be issued from the treasury, in pursuance of appropriations by law; to execute such services relative to the sale of the lands belonging to the U. States as may be by law required of him; to make report and give information to either branch of the Legislature, in person or in writing (as he may be required) respecting all matters referred to him by the Senate or House of Representatives, or which shall appertain to his office; and generally to perform all such services relative to the finances, as he shall be directed to perform.”  
This establishment of the office, evidently had no reference beyond the case of superintending the regular and ordinary collection of the revenue, and granting warrants for monies issued from the treasury, in pursuance of appropriations by law.  
The case of loans, as an occasional and extraordinary resource, was left to be provided for by particular laws for the purpose. The authority with respect to the loans in question was accordingly committed to the President, in order to secure for so special a trust, the highest responsibility to be found in the government. And when it was considered that the whole sum contemplated was no less than fourteen millions of dollars; and when the latitude as to the terms and contracts was combined with the vastness of the sum; it might well be questioned whether so great a power would have been delegated to any man in whom the legislature and the people of America, had less confidence than they so justly reposed in the existing chief magistrate; and whether an equal power will ever be committed to a successor.  
This distinction between the case of ordinary revenue and that of loans, is not only consonant to the actual policy of our laws, but is founded in obvious and solid considerations.  
In the collection and disbursement of the ordinary revenues arising from taxation, the business flows in official channels; is subject in every stage to official checks; and the money being in constant influx and efflux, nowhere accumulates in immense sums.  
The case of loans is in all these respects different. In settling the terms and arranging the negociations, there is always an important discretion involved. When the loans are foreign as well as great, regulations concerning the bills of exchange form another occasion where great latitude is implied in the trust. Whilst the magnitude of the sums falling under the same direction at the same moment, present a further and material variance between the two cases.  
The tendency of these observations is to shew, that as the permanent law establishing the treasury department does not extend the authority of the secretary to the case of loans, and as the law authorising loans, exacts, for special reasons, a responsibility from the President himself, the authority of the secretary in executing the loans and the appropriation of them, must be derived from the President; and, consequently where that authority fails, there can be no resort to the law establishing the department, much less to any general discretion incident to his official character. It is evident, that the President, although no doubt guided by the most proper considerations in employing the agency of the secretary of the treasury in the business of the loans, might, if he had judged fit, have substituted the agency of another; and that whatever agency he might prefer, his own instructions would always regulate the extent and exercise of the power conferred.  
The want of any apparent authority from the President had led several gentlemen to insist on presumed authorities, superceding the instruction joined with the commission to the secretary: But here again the fair inference was to be reversed. A communication of the authorities given by the President to the secretary as to the application of the foreign loans, had been expressly requested by the vote of the house. It was not to be supposed that the secretary, if he had received further authorities or instructions would have failed to produce them, or to refer to them, in the justification of his conduct. Far less could it be presumed that the President, if he had given any superceding authorities or instructions, would not have caused them to be communicated to the house; or that he would have suffered a partial communication to mislead the house into an error, as to so important a fact. The President was the last man in the world to whom any measure whatever of a deceptive tendency could be credibly attributed.  
Thus far said Mr. M. his observations had departed as little as possible from the question in its strictest sense. He should now avail himself of the opportunity afforded by the terms of the last clause which spoke of drafts generally, to take a more particular notice of those recently made; in doing which he considered himself safe within the rules of the House, which were so rigorously enforced against the affirmative side of the question.  
The whole amount of foreign loans transferred directly or indirectly to the United States, appeared from the several statements to be about three millions of dollars.  
The amount of the direct draughts was 2,304,769.13.  
Of the drafts made since the 16th of April 1792, and sold by the bank, the proceeds now in the bank, or payable into it, before the 1st of April next, amount to 1,220,476.01 dollars. Of this sum, 510,000 dollars have been drawn in the course of the present session of Congress.  
With respect to the times and the amount of these draughts, hitherto absolutely unknown to the Legislature, because the account of them had remained in the books of the bank without ever appearing in the books of the Treasurer, Mr. M. confessed that he had found no explanations that to him were satisfactory. He had looked through all the reports and all the communications before the house, without discovering either that they had been made by the authority or with the knowledge of the President; or had been required for, or applied to the purchase of the public debt; or had been ever communicated to the trustees of the sinking fund, who had the direction of such purchases; or that they were the effect of any necessity that could justify them.  
And if there was no evident necessity for the proceeding, it was the more to be lamented that whilst we were every where sympathising with our allies, in their arduous struggles for liberty, and echoing from every part of the union, our congratulation, and good wishes, the pecuniary succours, so critically necessary to their cause, and the most substantial proof of the sincerity of our professions, should be silently withdrawn across the Atlantic, from the object for which they were intended: succours too, which were not merely a tribute of gratitude, of generosity, or of benevolent zeal for the triumph of liberty; but a debt moreover of strict and positive obligation, for value acknowledged and received. In contemplating the subject in this point of view, he felt a pain which he could not easily express; and to which he persuaded himself, the breast of no other member could be a stranger.  
Laying aside however, all these unfavourable considerations, the important question still remained, why the legislature had been uninformed of the monies so unexpectedly drawn into the bank, and to so very great an amount. If the drafts had received every requisite sanction; if they had been produced by the most justifiable causes, the existence of 1,220,476 dollars in a situation so different from what had been contemplated, was a fact, which the representatives of the people had a right to know; which it was important to them, and their constituents, that they should know; and which it was the indispensable duty of the officer charged with it, to have made known.  
This omission was the more remarkable, when considered in relation to the measure above mentioned, of paying off at once the whole sum of 2,000,000 dollars, payable to the bank by instalments in ten years. A bill for this purpose had been introduced, and was on its passage. The object of it had been patronized by a report of the secretary not long since made. In one of his last reports, he expressly states among the inducements to such extensive drafts of money from Europe, that they were made “with an eye to placing within the reach of the legislature”—the means requisite for this object. Was it not extraordinary; was it not unaccountable, that so important a measure should be recommended, and be actually introduced, and that money otherwise appropriated in Europe, should be transferred to this country and deposited in the bank, in order that it might be within the reach of being applied by the legislature to that measure; and yet that no disclosure should be made to the legislature of the fact, that the money was so drawn &amp; lay at the bank within their reach to be so applied.  
  
If any thing could heighten astonishment on this occasion, it must be the reason assigned by the Secretary for any obscurity that might have hung over our finances—“that till the last resolutions, no call had been made on the department, which rendered it proper to exhibit a general view of the public monies and funds, or to shew the amount and situation of such as were unapplied.” Mr. M. would not decide that the Legislature was free from blame, in not using more full and efficacious means of obtaining such information, as would have removed all obscurity. But whatever degree of blame might fall on them, it never could be admitted, that their calls on the department had furnished no proper occasion for exhibiting a full view of the public finances. He referred generally to the various resolutions, which, without the least force of construction, would have extended to every proper article of information. He reminded the committee of the latitude of reports under certain other orders of the House; and asked whether less freedom of construction was to be allowed when information was to be given, than when power or discretion was to be exercised? But independently of this view of the matter, Mr. M. held it to be clear and palpable, that the very situation of the money, afforded an occasion which rendered it proper, that the House should be informed of it. If a liberty could be taken, of removing money from Europe where it stood appropriated by law, to this country, where there was no legal object that required it, and with an eye, as was stated, to an object to which no money was applicable, without the authority of the Legislature, how could it possibly be supposed improper to take the further liberty of communicating what was done, to the Legislature?  
He concluded with recurring to the particular form, in which the subject presented itself to the committee, and repeating, that whatever quality might be attached to the facts charged, or however improper it might be thought by some, to proceed in haste to any affirmative decision on them, it appeared irreconcilable with the evidence which had been produced, to decide, by a negative vote, against the truth of the facts

colleague (Mr. Giles) in propofirtg the re­  
solutions, to remark that the lateness of  
the day to which they had been poflponcd  
did not juftify the ftr&#x27;n&#x27;,hires which lir.d been  
made on it. If the delay was not to be  
co .lidered as lome blame at  
iea.!i would fail elsewhere. The enquiries  
in which the whole buiinefs originated,  
had been moved by his colleague and pas­  
sed the House fouie v. cexs ago. The re­  
&#x27;ports in ailfwer xh these enquiries had not  
tieen finally ma.&#x27;e and p.&#x27; ired a (ingle day  
- before the prc&#x27;fent refulutkms were fub­  
m.tted to the house. He admitted that it  
might have been impracticable to report  
t:i„» information Called lor as early as was  
denred by the house ; He v. a ,&#x27;i-nJible of  
thtf anxi. ty that,would be natu - lly felt by  
t i _r called tip • to j-rc-fent every  
coiil.deration that might place his conduit  
in ill ■ v,i &gt;11 :&#x27;iv vurable point of view ; yet  
with all t . &#x27;fe ill iw. n- es it was impo(Ebk  
| to deny t&#x27;-. it the r.-ports contained thing  
which did not h-. io:ig to them, and t&#x27;here­  
fore ior.frncd tine which belong-&lt; 1  
to the period for difcuffiott: I&#x27;e would  
mention our iuftanceon which there conid  
lotpodvbly be a difference of cpipion, viz :  
the vindication formerly undertaken by  
the Secretary, oi&#x27;thr policy of b -.rrowrng  
money abroad. Whether this policy w.-  
right or wrong, the i?gifl-jtura had theiu­  
felves decided in favour of itand it mi:  
the duty of the Secretary in complying  
with the orders of the house, to inform  
the houfe,how the law had been executed,  
lot Why it had been made; to-exphiin hi.;  
own conduct,not to juftify that ol the le­  
gislature.  
It had been a Iked why the call for infor­  
mation had not been sooner made ? The  
ailfwer was obvious and limple. 11 was  
not sooner perceived by the house, that  
there was such a nectffity for it. The  
\\ lit of information was firft fuggefled  
by the bill fir p ivin.g 2,000,000 of dollars  
to the bank, altho-&#x27;200,000 only were im­  
mediately due, and for authorizing another  
foreign loan to the amount of 2,000,000 :  
From the dawn of light thrown by some  
circ.imftanccs incident to the occalion, on 1  
the darkness in w liich the House had re- 1  
mained, proceeded those doubts and en- 1  
quiries which had led to the information 1  
now poirefl&#x27;cd. His colleague had great 1  
merit in having brought about this deve- 1  
lopement. He had rendered a service 1  
highly valuable to the legillature, and nc &lt;  
less important and acceptable to the pub­  
lic. One good effect of the information t  
had been, that it prevented the palfage of  
the bill for borrowing 2,000.c00 of dollars t  
as an anticip ted payment to the bank. &lt;■  
  
The bill bad dropt from the hand of it  
palion with the lirft light that broke ii  
upon the house. What other nieafure  
•voir d have been prevented or varied, if :  
like knowledge ol our funds and finance  
liarl been C •.r obtained, was matter o  
fclious «*nl:den ttotj.  
-■ :other tonfeqceiKe of the reports ta  
I;. &#x27;I together, was that the face of then  
p fen ted to his colleague, an evidence o:  
charges contained in the refolntions  
v, he ther at foJLte a day it was belt tc  
isave the fubjeit as exhibited by the varf  
o:is document- in print, for the exanimate  
o i and opinion of the public, or ro press ii  
o i the cc!:::derat:on of the house, was ;  
point which every member had aright tc  
decide for himfeif. His colleague hac  
viewed the politions stated in his inotiot;  
as too important to be suspended*; and a:  
fupportcd by Inch clear and authentic  
proofs. that a small portion of time would  
I&#x27;tiiiice for the subject. Under this impref­  
i.&#x27;oti, what was his right became ins duty ;  
\! he had difcharped it by offering his re­  
iViittions to the House.  
As the HojiXe had.refufed to commit the  
: #o introductory resolutions which eltab­  
filed t.&#x27;ie&#x27;ruleol judgment to beapplied to  
tile cafe, and the I alt alio, which declared  
. :ie inference to be drawn, the talk of the  
: amniiltee was limited to a liiuple enqui­  
ry into the facts Hated .They were to  
wake out and report a fpecinl verdiit ot  
caefe, and leave it to the House to pro-  
I&#x27;ounce the proper judgment ariling from  
them.  
The refoiution immediately before the  
committee in poi red &#x27;■ that the Secret.iry  
&quot;i tile rreaiiuy id violated .lie. law pas­  
: d on the 4th ot .iug&#x27;.lit 1790 making ap­

The questions here are questions of fact;  
and whatever quality may be attached by  
diiferent gentlemen to the several feds, it  
would feein as if the facts tliemfelves are  
too clearly supported by the reports of the  
Secretary, and the documents attending  
them,to be denied or controverted.  
The law of August 4, j-00, authorised  
the Prefidept to catife to be borrowed  
12,000,000 of dollars to be applied to the  
foreign dgbt of the United Stat cs. A sub­  
sequent law of August 12, 1790, authorised  
mother loan oF2,coo,cgo of dollars, to be  
applied to the domeitic debt of the United  
States.  
A power to make these loans was dele­  
gated on the 28th August 1-90, to the Se­  
cretary by a general commission in the ufu­  
il form, referring to the several aits above  
mentioned ; but without any farther dif­  
.riminataon of the loans to be made. As  
:he law however for applying loans to the  
■&#x27;oreign objefl was prior ill date, the pre­  
emption would rather be that it was to  
lave a priority of execution ; that the ilt  
noncy borrowed was to belong to the ift  
ibjeit provided for. It was nnnecefTary  
lowever. ro dwell on this conlideration,  
lecaufe the Preside.it had removed nil 11 1-  
rtair.ty by the precise explanations and  
iiitructions which accompanied ;he power  
o the Secretary, and which ought in truth  
o be deemed a part of the commission.  
The inftruftion having been more than  
nice i&#x27;t ad to the committee, he would con­  
ent liiirif.lt with referring to it. [The  
• a t referred to is in the following words ;  
&#x27; I do hereby make known to you that in  
he execution of the J aid trujt, you are to  
ibferve and follow the orders and directi­

I do hereby further empower yGu to mat  
or cause to be made, \v tth whomsoever  
may, concern, such . contrast or contrast  
being of a nature relative thereto, as Ilia  
be found needful and conducive to the ir  
terelt of the United States.&quot;&quot;] By-thja for  
iUal ast ifliiecl along with the comrniliioti.t  
the Secretary, the Prelident delignated th  
object to which the loans to be made, wer  
to be applied ; and by declaring the objei  
to be that provided for by the ast of A tic  
4, 1790 he expressly placed the loan, un  
.ler the authority and purview of that a£l  
so that the moment the. money ihouid b  
borrowed, it was toftand leg illy approuri  
ated to i:s fpccifted object ; as much -is i  
another la\v, authoritmg another &#x27;can, so  
another purpose, had not exilUd.  
This arrangement of the PreGdent wr.  
the more proper&#x27;, not only became provili  
011 for the payment of the foreign deb  
iiad been the primary obj.ft of the Legifia  
ture, and the payir.e.irpt the French debt  
the anxiou-. vviiu of&#x27; his cqnllitueiits : bu  
jbecaufe payments to France were no long  
er matter of option, but c. j.s-IcC and po  
iitiveobligation on the United States. Ii  
proof of this, he J&#x27;tatcd tn.it the deb: t.  
France, calculated to the end of i~yi, ani  
computing tbe iivre at j 4-10 to a dollat  
amounted to 4,81,4,814 -iuilars j, wivil.lt!..  
payments axtutiTiy iViatre, ctimfjuti- fnl  
florin at 2 1-2 to a dollar, amiSi-.ntcd to r  
more than 3,372,717 ; leaving a balance a

ding to this balance, the indalments du  
for 179 a, ar, ounung to 638,888, there  
were to be paid within that year i,cEo,i 8;  
dollars. The entire payments, however

and 726,000, put to the account of St. Do

paid) amounted to 1.382,500 dollars, ler.v  
ing due at the end of 1792, a balance ol  
698,485 dollars.  
Here he adverted to and read a para­  
graph in the report of the Secretary&#x27;, pagt  
16, where in allulion to the measure o]  
:lrawing bills in the latter part of 179;  
:ie fays, &quot; 1 felt myfelf the more at liberty  
.0 do it, becatife it did not interfere witi  
t complete fulfilment of the publicengage­  
ncnts in regard to the foreign debt. It  
:ould be done consistent with a full rtini  
nirfement of all arrears and instalment  
which had accrued on account of that  
iebt.&quot; Mr. M. cbferved that as he could  
lot reconcile this paragraph with the cal­  
. illations which he had:t.i:ed,&amp; which were  
Irawnfromoificial documents, he mult re­  
gard it as an unqueftionabte error produ­  
ce! by some hally view ol the fubjcct.  
Returning to the comniiffioo, Mr.  
cpeated that all the money which that  
imminent, defined and qualified by the  
nflruftion annt«ed to it, authoriftd the  
lecretary to burrow, was actually and  
pecifically appropriated to the payment 1 f  
he for&gt; ign debt, and under circumftanci s  
larticularly urgent, jn relation to a part  
if it.  
111 what manner had this trufl been car­  
ied into execution ? It was to be obit-r­  
---ed with regret, that on the pery dry. on  
vhich the comn ifiiori and hiflruftion ifln­  
d from the Prelident, the Secretary com­  
nenced his arrangements for diverting

August /t, and the inftru&amp;ions o  
the Prtfident relating to it.  
He then proceeded to a more diftinfi  
view of the two points particularly liatec  
ill the resolution.  
&#x27;I he firll was &quot;that a ce:tain portior  
of Ihe principal borrowed under the ail  
of August 4th, 1790, bad been applied cc  
the p yrnent of the interest falling due or  
that principal.&quot; As the fact would lit t  
be preluined, be denied, he forebore ti  
quote that part of the documents whicl  
admitted aud authenticated it. He won&#x27;t  
however premie, to any observations or  
it, a cursory view cf the nature of appro  
pi iations.  
It was unncceffaiy to repeat the em  
plistic remarks on thi fubj ft which bar  
fallen f nm the mem&#x27;ier from Pennfylva  
nia (&quot;-Ir. lindley.) It was fufficieutly  
undeftood, he concluded, tint appropria  
lions of money were of .1 hijjh and sacred  
character ; that they were the great bid  
wark \vh ch our constitution had careful y  
and j&#x27;raloufly eftablilhed againll executive  
uirpationi. lie meant onl t:&gt; take no­  
ti.eof the different pl.ms into which ap  
j.roprialioiu might be moulded and q!  
the particular operation which ought to be  
given to them.  
One of the plans was that of appro  
priating fpecified funds to Ipccifir 1 ob­  
lefts, i i which the supposed certainty ol  
the funds w.s adjlifted to the supposed  
iiliportance of the object  
&#x27;i&#x27;he o her plan formed all the bran­  
ch.&#x27;:; of icvenue into an aggregate fund,  
on which the several objects (hould have a  
| riot ity of claim, accordirg to their su­  
periority of importance.  
It was evident, that in both these ca  
fes, the legiflaturc alone possessed the  
competent authority. The exc ufive right  
i f that department of t e government  
to ni ke the proper regulations, was the  
bails ol the utility and effieaiy of appro­  
priations.  
There was a third qucftion incident to  
the dcitrine of appropriation , viz whe­  
ther, under fpecilic ppropriationi, such  
as had been adopted by Cougrefs, the ex  
e utive authority could, without f &gt;ecial  
p r.niffion of the law, apply the excess of  
one fund&#x27;to the aid of a deficient one ;or  
borrow from one fund for the object of an  
o&#x27;her. On this question there initilit per­  
haps be a difference of opinion. He would  
only remark, that admitting such a discre­  
tion to be implied in the tfuft of executing  
the ans it would flillbe requili&#x27;e that the  
due fanftaon of the executive fliould be  
given, that a regular account fhoul.l be  
kep: between the different funds, and that  
all advances from one to the other, fliould  
be re:i!.:ccd as foc.n .is poflil.le. I his vva-.  
equally necessary to the prefcrvation of or  
der in the public si iance», and to a proper  
refpedt for the authority of the laws  
In Ihe present cafe it did riot appear  
that the monies taken at different tune  
from th&lt; loans defignaied by the Prefideiil,  
and thereby placed u der the appropr a  
tion of the ast of August 4th, , 790, to tin  
foreign had ever been replaced. Ii  
did not appear that any such lepiacemvnt  
was regularly planned or provided fur —  
It was particular y worthy of obfeivation,  
moreover, that the only use within tin  
United States for which any loan in En  
10 ie c&lt; nld be afligned, was that of th&#x27;  
linking fund ; that the trullees of this sunn  
  
had never been even informed of the  
that if all the nonius drawn !;nd been cur  
to the finking fund, the limited sum  
of i,OCO,COO of dollars would have tbeeu  
exceeded; and that the fta&#x27;tments and ac  
counts lisd in fait I.•■en f» w.ii :&lt;j t&#x27;p, a­  
mentioned by tl e secretary, that not a  
lingle dollar of the money laid out in pur­  
chafiug the public debt, had been charged  
on loam drawn into the United Stales ;  
a&#x27;tho&#x27; such wr.s the only purpose to which  
they were lega&#x27;ly applies! 1., and f:ich thi  
principal reason assigned for making the  
drafts  
He did not go into a particular proof  
that the sum drawn into the United States,  
after fubtradting the whole sum placed to  
a fore gn account, exceeded the sum ot  
2,000.c00 ofdollais, because the fadt had  
been conceded on the oth.r fide particu­  
larly by the llatement of t&#x27; e member from  
Connecticut, (Mr. Hillhoufe.)  
hus it p: eared clearly, in confi»ma­  
tion ot the fir 11 point, that the application  
of a certain portion of the principal bor­  
rowed in Europe, t&gt; the payment of the  
interest was not a mere tianfpofition of  
moni s, to prevent the fending them back­  
wards or farwaids. Ncr an advance of mo  
ney from one overflowing fund in favor of  
a deficient one, but an absolute diversion  
of appropriated money ; a d conlequt ntly  
a violation of the law making the appro­  
priation.  
The second point in the resolution r&lt; la  
ted to the drawing of monies into the Uni­  
ted States without the inftrudtion of the  
President.  
This point bad been fully efiablifhed by  
the documents and explanations a plied to  
&#x27;hefirfl. They had done more: ey  
ad demi nftrated that the inltrudtiona of  
the Prefident,which dedicated the loans, to  
be made under hiscommifli mi, o a foreign  
object, were an express prohibiti no drat»  
f r any domestic object, It was f fiicient  
herefore to n fer to the inflrudt ons of the  
President, and to the contradictory (leps  
t&amp;ken by the Secretary.  
Two attempts have been made to elude  
the force of hefe official proofs  
Ihe firll app aled to the President&#x27;s  
Tpeech at the opening of the session in  
1790 ; to the report ol the Secretary made  
n consequence of it to the H&lt; life ; and to  
he supplementary ast ofCongreft pafTetl in  
ionformity to the r port.  
I :a.l the circumflances involved in thi  
ranfedtion been attended to by those wo  
eemed to rely on it, Mr. Madison w .•  
jerfuaded that a reference to it would ne.  
rer have been made by gmtlem n on th :t  
ide. As they had thought fit, however,  
o draw arguments from that fourcv, it w s  
iroper to give an answer to them : and  
he be it answer would be a naked (latent nt  
)f fadts  
The infirudtions of the President to the  
Secretary were given, as has been seen, on  
he 28th of August 1790. The letter &lt;if  
he Secretary contravening this inftrudtion,  
rvas dated, as has also been seen, on the  
ame 2lith day ofAuguft, 1 790.  
I&#x27;he adtual drawing of hi Is by the Se  
■retarv commenced on the ijtu of De  
.ember 1790.  
The law now pleaded in jollification of  
he conduct of the Secretary pasTed on the  
jd of March 1791.  
There are titer f&#x27;dts material to a cor­  
edt and full view of the hulinefs.  
I he speech of the Prefi I nt was deliver­  
don the Bth of D cember 1790. It  
&gt;riefly informed the House that &quot; a loan  
&gt;fth ee millions of fl lins, towards which  
ome proviiional meaftires had previotifly  
aken place, had been completed in Hoi  
and,&quot; and &#x27;• that the Secretary of the  
frcafury hail his diredtlon to communicate  
uch further part iculars as might be re­  
juilite for more precise information &quot;  
The consequent report of the Secretary  
■ecommending the provilion in the supple  
•nentary adt, was not received till the 25th  
jf February 1 79 t, fix days only before the  
:onllitutional diflblution of the House,  
In the interval between the speech of  
the President and the Secretary&#x27;s report,  
lie had proceeded to draw bills to tile a­  
mount of 793,392 florins.  
His report, nt witliftan ling what has  
been fa&#x27;d of it, contained not a word fr. m  
which it could be known th t a single (1 &gt;-  
rn had bee 1 adtually drawn over to the  
United .&#x27;•tales.  
The other attempt to elude the evidence  
before the committee recoiled w-th equal  
force on the gentlemen who had hazarded  
it. In the report lately made by the lYii!-  
lees of the finking fund, i a (latenicnt laid  
before th.m by the Secretary, in which i; j  
  
&#x27;* noted, &quot;11.r.t the acceptance of the&#x27;oaii  
of three n.ilJions of florins, and the app ica  
tion of one third of if to the purpose of  
that fund w s under the consideration of  
lie Prelident.&quot;  
Fio&#x27;n this fact it had been inferred, not  
only t&#x27;.iat the Secretary had withheld no  
proper information frum the trustees, bat  
ihat the result of t!ie Prelident&#x27;s delibcra  
lions on the fubjeft had varied the purpose  
fignified by his firll inflruftions to the Se  
cretary.  
k happened, however, mod unfortu­  
nately for the gentlemen who exulted in  
thin argument, that they had entirely o­  
veilooked the dates of the two papers  
The paper l iid before the trustees and al­  
ledgcd to liave explained the final pur,iofc  
of the President, was dated on the ij h ol  
Augull 1790. The paper relied on bv  
the other tide, as the final, as well as the  
moll forma) designation of the will of tht  
President, was dated the 28th of Augull  
179 a. The gentlemen, therefore, inllead  
ot the inference they hadmade, fh.valJ  
hsve reversed their premises, and joined  
with their opponents in concluding thai  
tin President was led, by a consideration ol  
the fuljeft, not to do what the Secretar  
in his rote to the truilecs, fee:red to anti  
cipate, but what had been evinced by the  
Prcfidrnt&#x27;s own ast of pollerior date.  
he second point, then, as will as the  
fi;(l, refls 011 the moll solid proofs tak.r:  
from a collective view of authentic docu  
mcuts.  
Much has been said on the nectfTiy o  
I mctimes depar ing from the ftriftnefs ol  
leg I appropi ia ions, as a p!. a for any free  
dorm that may have been tak n with them  
bv the Sen tary. He would not deny  
that there might be emergencies 11 tht  
course of hnman affair , of lo extraordina  
ry and p effing a nature, as to a solve (I&lt;«  
txe utive fr m an infl»xible Conformity tc  
the injunctions of the law It was, never  
thclifs, as eflVntial to rememl er, as it wai  
obvious to remark, that in all such cases,  
thenccifii&#x27;y should be palp.bit ; that Ihe  
execut ve fanftion (hould flow from the  
fnpreme foutce, and tlut the firll oppor­  
tunity should be foized for communicating  
to the legifl.itlire the meafares pursued.  
wth the re Tons explaining the neceflily  
of them. Th s early communication »-ai  
equ il v enforce ! by pi udence ami by duty.  
It was the liefl evidence of the motives foi  
affu ning the xt&#x27;aordinary power ; i&#x27; wai  
arefpect manif-llly due to the legiflatm  
authority ; and it was more particularly  
in &#x27;ifpei.fible, as that alone would enablt  
the legislature, by a provident amendment  
ol the law, to acconwiodaie it lo like e  
mergencies in future.  
In the proceedings f.dli g under tht  
pref nt enquiry, no neei Iliry appeared sot  
he liberties which had been taken, th.  
money appropr ated in Europe being inort  
wanted there than ;t home. It appeared  
that the inilruftions of the supreme exe­  
cutive, inllead of warranting tliofe liber  
&#x27;its, had precluded them. Nor had tht  
prope explanations been disclosed in dut  
time to the legillature.  
To phrc the fubjeft in a more dilinft  
poiiit of view, it was proper to advert tc  
lie preeife authorities and duties o» the  
Secretary as his ollice ia defined by the  
ast ellablilhing a treasury department.—  
For this purpose Mr. M. read the second  
feftion of that ast, wh eh is in the woidi  
following—&quot; That it (hall he the duty ol  
the eeretary of the Treasury to digell or  
prepare plans for the improvement and  
management of the revenue, and for Ihe

the public expenditures ; to superintend  
the revenue ; to decide on the forms of  
keepi g and lining accounts, an I making

from the treasury, in pursuance of appro,  
priations by law ; to execute luch fe viccs

to the United tates as may be by law

Numb. 42 of Vol. ll.]  
  
Debate on the Official Conduct of the Se­  
cretary of the Treasury, (continued  
from our last.)  
FiudAy, March i.  
Mr. Madison —{in continuation.)  
The want of any apparent authority from  
the Prelident had led fever.il gentlemen to  
infill on presumed authorities, fuperfe&#x27;ding  
the inftruetior.s joined with the conuniilu.n  
to the Secretary : But here 3g;;i 11 the fair  
inference was to be reversed- A commu­  
nication of the authorities given by the  
President to the Secretary as to the appli­  
cation of the foreign loans, h id been ex­  
pressly requeued by the vote of the house : It  
was not to be supposed that the Secretary, if  
lie had received further authorities or in­  
ftru£tions would havefail.edtoproducethem  
or to refer to them, in the jultiScation of hi;  
conduG. Far less could it be presumed that  
the President, if he had given any fuperfe­  
din~ authorities or inltruitions, would not  
have caused them to be communicated tc  
the houfr ; or that he would have futfe-red  
a partial communication to mislead tht  
house into an error, as to so important a  
fait. The President was the lalt man in  
the world to whom any meafuie whatever  
of a deceptive tendency could be crediblj  
attributed. .  
Thus far (said Mr. M.) his obfervationi  
had departed a; little aspoftble from the  
question in its (tr&#x27;ureft fenle. t-e Ihoulc  
now avail himfeli* of the opportunity af­  
forded by the terms of the last clause which  
fuoke of drafts, generally to take a more  
particular notice o! thpfe recently made, it  
doing which he conlidered himfelt fafe  
within the rules of the house, which ivert  
so rigoronfly enforced aga&#x27;mit the affirma­  
tive fide of the que(tio:i.  
The whole amount of the foreign loan:  
transferred directly or indirectly to the U­  
nhed Stated, npp-artd from the vera  
statements to be about tnree millions o  
dollars.  
The amount of the d;reit dratts \va:  
2,304,769 dollars 13 cents1.  
Ot the draft; made since the 16th of A­  
pril 1*92 and fold by t ie ban»v, or payable  
into it, b-&#x27;fore the fir(t of April nest, a­  
mount to 1,220.476 dollars. Qt this fun  
5 to,ooo dollars have been diawn in thi  
course of theprefent fLllion ot Co lgrefs.  
With refpeft to the times and the a,noun  
of theft draughts, hitherto absolutely un­  
known to the legislature, because the ac  
count of them had remained in the books o  
the bank without ever appesring in th&lt;  
books of the treasurer, Mr. M- co.ifefiet  
that he had found no explanation-, that t&lt;  
him were fatisfaftory. He had   
through all the reports and all the commu  
nications before the house, without disco.  
vering either that they had been made bi  
the authority or with the knowledge of the  
President ; or had been required for, 01  
applied to the purchafc of the public debt  
or had been ever communicated to th&lt;  
trufteei of the linking fund, who had tht  
direction or such purchafe3; or that the)  
were the effect of any necessity that coule  
juftify them.  
And if there was no evident necessity foi  
the proceeding, it was the more to be la­  
mented that whillt we were every where  
fympathi.&#x27;ing with our allies, in their ardu­  
ous ltruggles for liberty, and echb.ng fron  
every part ot the union our congratulations  
and good willies, the pecuniary succours.  
so critically nccelfary to their cause, and  
the molt substantial proof of the fiucerity o!  
our profeffions.iiiouUl befilently withdrawn  
across the Atlantic, from the object for  
which they were intended ; succours, too,  
which Were not merely a tribute of grati­  
tude, of generosity, or of benevolent zeal  
for the triumph of liberty ; but a debt  
moreover of Itrict and positive obligation,  
lor value acknowledged and received. In  
contemplating the fubjeft m this point o,&#x27;  
view, lie felt a pain which he could not ea­  
sily etprifs ; and to which he persuaded  
» liimlelf, the breast of rio other member  
co11M be a flranger.  
Laying alide. however, all these unfa­  
vourable considerations, the important  
queition (till remained, why the legislature  
had been uninformed of the monies so un­  
expectedly drawn into the bank, and to so  
very great an amount If the drafts had  
received every requisite fanfticn ; if they  
had been produced by the mod juftiftable  
tauf.s, the exillence of 1,220,476 dollars,  
in a lituation so very different from what  
had been contemplated, was a fact, which  
the reprefentntives of the people had a  
l ight to know ; v. hich U was important to  
them, and their conftititents, that they

should know ; and which it was the imhf­  
penfible duty of tiie officer charged with it,  
to have nude known.  
This omission was the more remarkable,  
when conlidered in relation to the measure  
above mentioned, of paying otFatonce the  
whole sum of 2,000,000 dollars, pay;*ble to  
the bank by instalments in ten years. A  
bill to this purpose had been introduced,  
and was on its pafTage. The object of it  
had been patronized liy .a report of the Se­  
cretary not long lince made. In o:ie of  
his lalf reports, he expref&gt;ly llates among  
the inducements to fnch extensive drafts of  
money from Europe, that they were made  
&quot; with an eye to placing within the reach  
of the legislature&quot; the means requisite for  
this ohj-&#x27;ct- Was it not extraordinary ;  
was it not unaccountable, that so impor­  
tant h meaftire should be recommended,  
and be actually introduced, and that mo­  
ney otherwise appropriated in Europe,  
fliould be transferred to this country and  
depolited in the bank, in order that it  
might be within the reach of being applied  
by the legislature to that ineafure : and  
yet that no dilclofure should be made tc  
the of the fa t, that the money  
was so drawn and lay at the bank withii  
their reach to be applied.  
If any thing could heighten afionifhnient  
on this occafiQ&#x27;i, it mult be the reafo.i as­  
signed by the Secretary for an obfeurity  
that mighc have hung over our finance —  
■&#x27; that till the lalj refutations, no call had  
seen made on the department, which ren­  
dered it proper to exhibit a general view of  
the public monies and funds, or to (hew the  
imoiint and situation of such as were un­  
applied.&quot; Mr. M would not di vide that  
:he legislature was free from blame, in not  
iiiiug more full and efficacious means of  
obtaining such informations, as would have  
removed all obfeurity &#x27; but whatever de­  
cree of blame might fall on them, it never  
:onld be admitted, that their calls 011 the  
department had furnifhed no proper occafi­  
m for exhibiting a full view of the pnbiic  
fiances. He referred generally to the various  
&quot;efoiutions, which, without the lead force of  
:onftru£ti&lt;vi, would have extended to cve­  
■y proper article of information. He re­  
minded the committee of the,latitude ofre­  
?orts under certain orders of the house ;  
and asked whether less ireedom of con­  
(tru£tion was to be allowed when inform. 1  
tion was to be given, than when power or  
tliferetion was to be cxercifed ? But inde­  
pendently of this view of the matter, Mr.  
M. held it to be clear and palpable, that  
the very situation of the money afforded an  
occafio.i which rendered it proper, that  
the house should. be informed of it. If a  
liberty could be taken, of removing money  
from Europe, where it flood appropriated  
by law, to this country, where there was  
no legal object that required it, and with  
an eye, as was stated, to an object to which  
no money was applicable, without the au­  
thority of the legislature, how could it pof­  
iibly be supposed improper to take the fur­  
ther liberty of communicating what was  
done to the legislature ?  
He concluded with recurring to the par­  
ticular form, in which the subject preferr­  
ed itfelf to the committee, and repeating  
that whatever quality might be attached  
to .lie faefs charged, or however improper  
it might be thought by fume, to proce. d in  
lialte to any affirmative decision 011 them,  
it appeared irreconcileable with the evi­  
dence which had been produced, to de­  
cide, by a negative vote, against the truth

MR. Madison. He wilhed not, he said, to  
watte a moment of the small portion of  
time left, by regretting its for a  
(full difculiion of the fubjeet before the commit­  
tee. But he thought it due to truth,and to the  
honorable and inde|&gt;endent motives of his col­  
league (Mr. Giles) in proposing the resolutions,  
to remark that the lateness oi the day to  
which they had been postponed did not juftify  
the ftridhires which had been jnade on it. If  
the delay was not to be con fide ted as unavoid­  
able, folne blame at least woukl fall elsewhere.  
The enquiries in which the whole bufinei&#x27;s ori­  
ginated, had been moved by Us colleague »nd  
pafftd the house some weeks ago. The re­  
ports in answer to theie enquiries had not  
been finally made a single day be­  
fore the pre&#x27;ent resolutions were fubmltted to  
the bouse. He admitted that it might have  
been impracticable to report the information  
called for as early as was deliredby the house :  
He was sensible cf the anxiety tlmt would be  
naturally felt by the officer called upon, to  
present every confide ration that might place  
his conduct in the most favorable poiut of  
view : yet with all these allowances, it was  
inipoliible to deny that the reports contained  
thing&#x27;s which did not belong to thein,and there­  
fore consumed time which belonged to the pe­  
riod for difcufilon. He would mention one  
in dance on which there could not possibly be  
a difference of opinion ; viz the vindication,  
formally undertaken by the Secretary, of ihe  
policy of borrowing money abroad. &#x27;Whether  
this policy was right or wrong, the leLiiflature  
had themselves decided in favor of it ; and it  
was the duty of the Secretary in complying  
with the orders&#x27;of the house, to inform the  
house, how the law had been executed, not  
why it had been made; to explain his own  
conduct, not to juftify that of the legislature.  
It had been why th© c»U svt«M~u&gt;a­  
lionhad not been sooner made ? The anfiwe*  
was obvious and simple. It was not sooner  
perceived by the house, that there was fucli a  
necessity for it. The want of information  
was firft suggested by the bdl for paying two  
millions of dollars to the bank, altho&#x27; 200,000  
only were immediately due, and for authoriz­  
ing another foreign loan to the amount of two  
millions. From the dawn of light thrown by  
fjnie eh curaftances incident to the occasion,  
on the darkr.efs in which the house had re­  
mained, proceeded those doubts and enquiries  
which had led to the information now possess­  
ed. His colleague had great merit in having  
brought about this devclopement. He had  
rendered a service highly valuable to the le­  
gislature, and 110 less important and acceptable  
to the public. One good etfeft of the infor­  
mation had been, that it prevented the pas  
of the bill for borrowing 2,0q0,000 of  
dollars as an anticipated payment to the bank.-  
The bill had dropt from the hand of its pa­  
tron with the firft light that broke in upon  
the house. What other meafutes would have  
been prevented or varied, if a like knowledge  
of our Tulwls and finances had I Ten sooner ob­  
tained, was matter of serious consideration.  
  
Another consequence of the reports taken  
together, was that the face of them presented  
to his colleague, an evidence of the charges  
contained in the resolutions. Whether at so  
late a day it was heft to leave the fubjeft as  
exhibited by the various documents in print,  
for the examination and opinion of the public,  
or to press it on the confederation of thehoufe,  
V/as a point which every member had a 1 igbt  
to decide for himfelf. His colleague had  
viewed the portions stated in his motion, as  
too important to be suspended ; and as sup-  
P:)1 re(* by such clear and authentic proofs,that  
a finall portion of time would fufrce for the  
fubjeA. Under this impreffton, what was his  
right became his duty ; and he had discharged  
it Wy  
ofFe ing his resolutions to the houle.  
  
. thfc house had refufed to commit the two  
introdu&amp;or* resolutions which ellablifhed the  
r( °f judgment to be applied to the cafe, and  
the lalt also, which declared the iiifcrance to  
dra\vn : the talk of the committee was li­  
niitted to a fiijiple enquiry into thq fads dat­  
ed. _ Tliey were to make out and reports  
lpecial vendiftofthefe, and leave it to the  
notift to pronounce the proper judgment arif  
ing from then).  
  
The refolutfon immediately before the com­  
mittee imported 4t that the Secretary of the  
Trcufury had violated the Jaw palled on the  
4th of Angustf 1790, making appropriations  
©1 certain monies,&quot; frfi*44 by &quot;applying a cer­  
tain portion of the principal borrowed, to the  
payment of interefton   
vt u by drawing part of tiie fame monies into  
the Un»ted States, without the iuftruftiou of  
the President.&quot;  
  
The qwiftions here are questions of fact;  
«&lt;id whatever quality maybe attached bvdiJ­  
  
Saturday, March 25. 1795.  
  
ferent gentlemen to the &amp;veraJfaftsEit would  
feetii as if the facts them felve.s. are too Nearly  
supported by flic reports of tbp Secretary, and  
the documents attending them, to be denied  
or controverted.  
The law of Auo;uft 4, 179% authorised the  
Prehd&lt;nt*o cause to be borrowed i;2,ooo,ooq  
of dollars to lie applied to the foreign debt of  
th~ United States. A fublequent law of An­  
guft 12, 1790, authorised another loan of two  
millions of dollars, to be applied to the do  
meftic debt of the United States,  
A power to make these loans was delegated  
on the 28th 1790, to the Secretary by  
a genaral commifh&#x27;on in the uftial form, re­  
ferring, to the Jeveral acts above-mentioned ;  
but without any farther discrimination of&#x27;the  
loans to be made. As the layv however for  
applying loans to the foreign object was. prior  
in date, the prcfuuvptiori would rather be Chat  
it was to have a priority of execution ; that  
the firft money borrowed was to belong to the  
firft object provided for. It was unnecelfary  
however 10 dwell on this consideration, be.  
cause the President had removed all uncertain*  
ty by the preci&#x27;e explanations and irftru^iT  
ons which aceomptmied the power to the Se­  
cretary, and. which oright m vnutfa to be d«« m­  
ed a part of the commiifion.  
The inftruftion having been more than once  
read to the committee, he would content him*  
felf with referring to it. [The part referred  
to is in the following words, il I do hereby  
make known to you, that in the execution of  
thejaid truJL yoU are to observe and follow  
the orders and directions following, viz. Ex­  
cept where otherwise especially directed by  
me, you lhall employ in the negociation of  
any foreign loan or loans which may be made  
in any foreign country, William Short, Esq.  
you fliall borrow or cause to be borrowed, on  
the best terms which fliall be found practica­  
ble, and within the limitations piefcribed by  
law, as to tittle of repayment and rate of in­  
terest, Oich fmn or funis as fliall be fufticient  
to discharge, as well all inftallinents or parts  
of the principal of the foreign debt, which  
now are due, or fliall become payable to the  
end of the year 1791, as all interest and an,  
rears of interest which now are or lhall be­  
come due, in refpeft to the said debt, to the  
fame end of the year 1791- And you lhall  
apply, or cmtjc to be applied, the monies \i hch  
(hall be so borrowed, with all convenient dif­  
patcb, to tht payment of the said inftalments,and  
parts of the principal and interest, and arrears  
of interest 0] the jrid debu You fliall not ex­  
tend the ariiouv.t of the loan which you thai!  
make, or cause to be made, beyond the fuin  
which lhall be neceflary for completing inch  
payment, unless it can be done upon terms  
more advantageous to the United States,than  
those upon which the residue of the said debt  
fliall stand or be. But if the said rejidue, or  
any part of the fataie can be paid off by new  
loans, upon terms of advantage to the United  
States, you lhall caufefudi further loans as may  
be requisite to be made, and the proceeds  
thereof to be applied accordingly. And for car­  
rying into effect the ohjtfts ar.dpurpofcs ajorefaid:  
1 do hereby further empower you to make or  
cause to be made, with whomsoever it may  
concern, such contra# orl:ontrafts, being of  
a nature relative thereto, as fliall be found  
needful and conducive to the interest of the  
United States.&quot;]—By this formal ast iflued  
along with the commijjion to the fecretaty, the  
Prelident designated the object to which the  
loans to lie made, were to lie applied ; and  
declared the object to be that provided for by  
the ast of August 4th, 179°&gt; be expressly plac*  
ed the loan under the authority and provision  
of that ast ; so that the moment the money  
Ihould be borrowed, it was to stand legally ap­  
propriated to its fpecified object ; as much as  
if another law, authorising another loan, for  
another purpose, had not existed.  
This arrangement of the President was the  
more proper, not only because provision for  
the payment of the foreign debt had been the  
primary object of the legislature, and the pay­  
ment of the French debt, the anxious wish of  
their constituents ; but because payments to  
France were no longer matte? of option, but  
of ftrift and positive obligation on the United  
States. In proof of this, he stated, that the  
debt to France, calculated to the end of 179**  
and computing the livre at 5 4-10 to a dollar,  
amounted to 4,814,814 dollars, whilst the pay­  
ments aftuaiy made, computing the florin at  
2 1-2 to a dollar, amounted to 110 more than  
3,372,717, leaving as a balance at the end of  
1791 of 1,442,097—Adding to thjc balance the  
inftalmentsduefor 1792, amounting to 683,858  
dollars—there were to be paid within the  
year 2,080, dollars. The entire payments,  
however, composed of 656,500 dollars in Eu­  
rope, and 726,000 put to the account of St.  
Domitigo, (although 441,263.83 were actually  
paid) amounting to 1,382,530 dollar*, leaving  
due at the end of 1792, a tialance of 698,485.  
Here he adverted to and read a paragraph  
in the report of the secretary, page 16, whertf  
in alJulion to the measure of drawing bills in  
the latter part of 1792, he fays, I feel my­  
felf tlie more at liberty to do it, bccaufe it did  
not interfere with a compleat fulfilment of  
the public engagements in regard to the fo­  
reign debt. It could be done conliftently  
  
337  
  
  
witwj * full re im bur foment of all arrears and  
tnftaimentsi which had accrued on account of  
that debt.&quot; Mr. M. observed, that as he  
could not reconcile this paragtapb with tie  
calculations which lie had stated, and which  
wete drawh from official documents, he mult  
regard it aslan uuqueftiooable error produced  
by Ibme hasty view of the fubjeft.  
  
Returning to the commifiion, Mr. M. re­  
peated that all the money which that instru­  
ment, defined and qualified by the inftruftion  
annexed to it, authorised the secretary to bor­  
row, Vvas actually and fpecificatly appropriated  
to the payment (if the foreign debt, and under  
circutpftances particularly ip relation  
. to a p^rtofit.  
In what manner had ttlis trust been carried  
into execution ? It was to be ohferved with  
regret, that on the very day, 011 which the-coin­  
million and inftruftion issued from the Prefir  
dent, the secretary commenced his arrange­  
ment for diverting part of a loan, accepted  
and ratified by virtue of his commission, to a  
purpofV different from that fpecified and re­  
quired by his inftruftion. That a fact of lb  
extraorilitery a complexion, might be ground­  
e4 °n the proof, jVJj.M.  
ft.J, he ihould take the line ty of fttpporting  
it by the authority of the Secretary himfelf.  
Here l&gt;e read from the Secretary&#x27;s letter dated  
Auguji 28, 179&quot;), to the Dutch houses from  
whom the loan had been accepted, the follow­  
ing padages, viz. 44 I Ihould also wilh for par­  
ticular reasons that the business may be lb re­  
gulated as to give it the form of two Joans,  
one for two millions under the fir ft ast, and  
the other for ore million under tk:fecond. But  
neither about this, am I so solicitous as to be  
willing it fnotild constitute an embkrrafT­  
ment.&quot;  
  
I dejiive a million and an ha!J of this Jum as a  
payment to France under the direction of Mr.  
Short, our charge des affaires at that court,  
whole orders for that purpose you will please  
to follow.&quot;  
  
The afpfcft here presented by a companion  
of the several documents, was Angular and re­  
markable; The subordinate officer appeared  
in dircft opposition to the chief magistrate.  
The agent was seen over-ruling by his own  
orders,, the orders of his principal. The lan­  
guage of the President was—By virtue cf the  
power vetted in me by law, I deifcine the mo­  
ney to be borrowed, to the discharge of the iti­  
ftalments and interest of the foreign debt*  
The language of the secretary was—l defline  
a part of the money only to that purpose, and  
a pat t to be brought to the United States for  
ether purposes. He left every member to  
make his own reflections on the fubjeft. He  
would only oblerve in general that it del&#x27; on­  
ftrated the truth afterted in the proposition,  
that the secretary had violated both the law  
of August 4th, 1792, and the inftruftion of  
the President relating to it.  
He then proceeded to a more diftinft view  
of the two points particularly stated iu the  
resolution.  
  
The firft was, ** That a certain portion of  
the principal, borrowed under tne ast of Au­  
gust 4, 1790, had been applied to the payment  
of the irtterett falling due on that principal &quot;  
As the f.ift would not, he presumed, be deni­  
ed, lie forbore to quote Chac part of the docu­  
ments, which admitted and authenticated it.  
He would, however, premise to any obl&#x27;erva­  
tiofis on it, a cur.fory view of the natute of  
appropriations.  
Jt was unr.etcflary to repeat Ihe emphatic  
remarks on this fubjeft, which had fallen from  
the member from Pennsylvania (Mr. Findley)  
It was fufficiently understood, he concluded,  
that appropriations of money were of a high  
and sacred character; that they were the  
wrestt bulwark which our ronfritution had  
carefully and jealously established against ex­  
ecutive ufurparions. He meant only to take  
notice of the different plans into which appro­  
priations might be moulded, and of the patti­  
cular operatior, which ought to he given to  
them.  
  
One of the plans, was that of appropriating  
fptcified funds to fpecified objects ; in which  
the supposed cerrainty of the funds was ad­  
jufled to the fuppoled importance of the ob­  
jects.  
The other plan formed all the branches of  
the revenue into an aggregate fund; on which  
&#x27; the several objects should have a priority of  
claim, according to their fuperior.ty of im­  
pel nee.  
It was evident, that in both these cafes,the  
leffiflature alone poffcftYd the competent au­  
thority. Theexclufive right of that depart­  
ment of the government to make the proper  
regulations, was the basis of the utility and  
efficacy of appropriations.  
  
There was a third question incident to the  
doctrine of appropriations, viz—Whether,  
under fpecific appropriations,fuch as had been  
adopted by Congress, the executive «uthonty  
could, without Ipecial permission of the law,  
apply the excess of one fund to the aid of a  
deficient one ; or borrow from one fund for  
the object of another. On this question there  
might perhaps be a difference of opinion. He  
would only remark, that admitting ftich adif­  
cretion to be implied in the trust of executing  
Uie laws, it \ypuld still be requisite that the  
  
  
[Whole No. 40;.]  
  
due fivxftiwi &lt;rfK*«HJe«tlve flion&#x27;d he give*,  
that a fefcular accoiitrflHonld be ktfitr Bef\#een  
the different and that yjl advai&#x27;Cts  
from one tp t!je other&#x27;lftonld he le&#x27;plaeud a#  
soon S&#x27;.pofliblc. . Thii equally necelfary  
to the.preservation of order in tlie public fi­  
nancesj ami to a prop.&#x27;i relj&gt;e&lt;ft for the autho­  
rity of the laws.  
  
In tfie present cafe it did not appear tfuip  
the monies taken at different times from tha  
leans designated by the President, and thereby  
.placed under the appropriation of the ast of  
.August 4, 1791, to the foreign debt, ever  
been replaced. It did not appear that #ay  
ftich replacement was regularly planned* or  
provided ibr. It was particularly worthy of  
•bier vat ion moreover, that the only life with­  
in the United States for which afiv loan iq  
Eitttope could be afiigned, was that of the (ifik­  
ingfiind j that the trutteei of this fund&#x27; had  
never been even informed of the drafts;   
if all the moniei drawn had been carried to  
the finking fund, tlie liinitted Turn of 2,066,b00  
of dollars would have been exceeded; and  
tbat the ftatethents and accounts had ly  
so woumi up, as njcntioned by&#x27;tlfiel SeOfe­  
tai not a fingk flilTar of tlie money &quot;laid  
out iiV purebafihg the public debt,, had. beert  
charged on loan ; draw 11 into the United .States;  
although such was the onlj pnrpoie to which  
they were legally applxahle, and such the  
principal reason alfigued for making the drift.  
  
He did not go into a particular proof that  
the sum drawn into the United States, after  
fubtra&amp;ing the whole sum placed to a foreign  
account, exceeded the Aim of 2,000,000 of  
dollar-;, becanfe the fa&lt;ft had been conceded on  
the other fide, particularly by the ftatemcnt  
of the member from Connecticut (Mr. Hill­  
hou&#x27;e).  
  
Thus it appeared clearly, fn confirmation  
of the firft point, that the application of a cer­  
tain portion of the principal borrowed in Eu­  
rope, to payment of the inteieft. vas not a  
mere transposition of monies, so prevent the  
fending them backwards or forwards ; nor  
an advance of money from an overflowing  
fund in favor of a deficient one ; but an al&gt;-  
solute diversion of appropriated money : and  
consequently a violation of the law making  
the appropriation,  
  
Tlve (econd point in the resolution, renting  
to the drawing of monies into the United  
States without the inltruClion of the President.  
  
This point had been fully eftablilhed by the  
documents and explanations applied to the  
firft. They had done more : They had &#x27;de­  
monstrated that the inftru&amp;ions of the Prtfi­  
der.t which dedicated the loans to be made  
under his commission, to a foreign ohjec%wiei e  
an cxprefs prohibition of drafts for any do­  
mestic object. ft was f\ifficient therefore to  
refer to the inftru&amp;ions of the Pre/jrient, 4r,d  
to the contradictory steps taken by the Secre­  
tary.  
  
Two attempts had been made to eluHe the  
force of tbeie official proofs.  
The firft appealed to the President&#x27;s speech  
at the opening of theSeflion in 1790 ; to Vhe  
report of the Secretary made in   
of.it to the house; and to the fuppiemcntfcry  
ast of Congress paifed in conformity to the  
report,.  
  
Had the circumstances invoked in this  
tranfa&amp;ion been attended to by those who  
Teemed to rely on it, Mr. M. was periuaded  
that a reference to it would never have been  
made by gentlemen on that fide. As they had  
thought fit however to draw argument-, from  
that f&#x27;ource, it was proper to give an anfXyer  
to them 5 and the best aniwer would be 3,  
naked statement of  
  
The inftruftign of the President to the Se­  
cretary, was given, as has been seen, on £he  
28thofAuguft 179°&#x27; The letter of the Se­  
cretary contravening this inftrultion, was  
dated, as has also been seen, on the fame 28th  
dayofAnguft, 179°-  
  
The actual drawing of bills by the secretary  
commenced tbe I jth of December, 1790.  
The law now pleaded in justification of the  
condgft of tl-e secretary pulled on the 3d of  
Marcb, 1791. , ■ &#x27; &#x27;  
  
There are other facts material to a correct  
ard full view of the bu(ii;efs.  
  
The speech of the President was delivered  
on the Bth ofDete&#x27;mber, 1790. It biiefly in­  
formed the two houses that &quot; a loan of three  
  
millions of florins, towards which some pio­  
vifional measures had previoiifly telcen place;  
had been completed in Holland,&quot;—and,&quot;That  
the secretary of the treasury had his direftioo  
to communicate such further particulars a}  
plight be requisite fur mort prccile inl&#x27;orma­  
tion.&quot;  
  
The confeqnent report of the (ecretary re»  
comniending the provision in the fuppltnien­  
tary ast, was not received till the 2jth of Fe­  
bruary, 1791 : fix days only before the con­  
stitutional diflolution of tl.e house.  
In the interval between the speech of the  
Prtfident and the fecretary&#x27;j woport, le had  
proceeded to draw bills to the amount of  
793.392 florins.  
  
His rep«rt( ratwilhftaxdtng what had been  
Jaid of it, contained not a word from which it  
couid be known that a fii&#x27;gte florin had been  
actually drawn over to the U &lt;lted-StaU«.

HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES.  
FRIDAY,&#x27; March r.  
&#x27; In committee of the whole, Mr. MuHlenberg  
&lt; &#x27; in the chair, on the 3d, 4th, stb, 6th, 7th,  
and Bth refolntions, refpefting the offidaf  
cinduft of the Secretary of the Treasury,  
1 for which fee Gazette of the 6th inft.  
J ( (Mr. Madison&#x27;j Speech concluded.)  
T&#x27;HE other attempt to elude the. erideilcf  
. before the Comntittjgjecoiled with eqvtal  
. fiSrt? 011 the gentlemen wlio bad hazardedit.  
In the report lately made by the trnfteesof  
i the linking fund, is a statement laid befire  
■ them by the Secretary, in which it is noted,  
that the acceptance of-the loan of three mil­  
•&lt; li«»as of florins, and the application, of one  
third of it to ftie purpose of that fund,&#x27;was  
, un&lt;ier the cogfide ration of the President.&quot;  
From thlsYaft it bad been interred, not on­  
ly that the secretary had withheld no proper  
iiifu-ination from the tfuftees, but that the  
rciilt of the President&#x27;s deliberations on the  
• fubteft bad varied the purpose lighMi&amp;d by his  
$riit iuftruftioos to the secretary.  
Jt happened however 1110 ft unfortunately  
for the gentlemen&#x27;who exulted in this argu­  
ment, that they had entirely overlooked the  
dates of the two papers. The paper laid be­  
fore the trustees, and alledged to have explain­  
ed the final purpose of the President, was dat­  
ed on the 2jth of August, 1790. The paper  
relied on by the othef fide, as &#x27; js final, as* well  
as the mpft formal, deflgnation of tiie will of  
the President, was dated the 28th of Augnft,  
1713- The gentlemen, therefore, instead of  
the inference they had made, should have re­  
versed their premises, and joined&#x27; with their  
j opponents in concluding that the Prefideni  
j was a consideration of the fubjeft, Hot  
to do what the secretary in his note to thd  
trustees feeined to anticipate, but whai had  
■ been evinced by the President&#x27;s own&#x27; ast of  
posterior date.  
Much has been said on the necessity of  
, foroetimes.departing from.the ftriftnefs of le­  
_ gal appropriations, as a plea for anyfre?doins  
that/may have been taken with them&#x27; by the  
secretary. He would not deny that there  
• W emergencies, in &#x27;the cburß of human  
■affairs, tjf To extraordinary artd preffing-a na­  
ture, as to absolve the executive frorii an in­  
flexible conformity to thc of ther  
law. It was, nevertheless, as efTential to re­  
member, aS it was obvious to that  
in ail such cases, the necessity should be pal­  
pable ; that the executive fanftjon should  
flow from the supreme source ; and that the1  
firfl opportunity should be feiztd for commu­  
nicating to the (jSgifiature the measures pur-  
I&#x27;ued, with the reafqos explaining the necessity  
of fhem. Th|s early communication was e­  
qutlly enfotcid by prudence and by duty. It  
was the best evidence o&#x27;f th£ motive&#x27;s for as­  
suming the extraordinary pbwer ; it was a  
due to the legi/iative au­  
thority ; if was more particularly indis­  
pensable, as tfcit.alofle would enable the legis­  
lature, by a provident amendment of the law,&#x27;  
to accommodate it to like emergencies in fu­  
we. , ,  
In tlie proceedings falling under theprerent  
enquiry, no necessity appeared for the liber­  
ties which had b?en taken, the money appro­  
priated in Eprope being tfiore wanted there&#x27;  
than at home. It appeared that the jnftruc­  
tions of the Supreme Executive.&#x27; iiifteVd of.  
varranting thofi; libertiesj had precluded;  
iiem. Nor had the proper explanations 6een  
Jifclofed in duwtime to the legislature. .  
To place the fi»bjeft.in a morf tfiftiiift point&#x27;  
of view, it wasproper toadv&#x27;ext to the   
mtborities and. duties.of* the £-crertary, as his&#x27;  
afSce is defined&#x27;by the ast establishing the  
1 trpaiury department. For this pnrpofe Mr.  
M..read the second feftion of that ast, which&#x27;  
is in the words following—&quot; That it stall be  
the duty of ,the ftcretnry of the treasury to  
idifeft and prepare plans for the improvement  
&lt; iivd management of the revenue, and fur the  
support of public credit ; to prepare and&#x27;re­  
pott eflimate&#x27;s of the public revenue, arid the  
public.expenditures ; io fupti intend the colUOion  
tjtherevenue ; t.o decide on Jlje. fprms of keep­  
ing and stating accmiotsandmaking returns,  
and to grant under the limitations herein ef­  
tabli&#x27;lbed, or to be hereafter provided,&#x27;all war­  
rants for monies/o ft ijfued from ike treasury,  
in pnrfuance of appropriations by law.; to cx­  
, ecu re fycb fervit^s.relative to the.sale &lt;jf the  
lands belonging to .the&#x27;limited States,, a j may  
be By law retjulredl&#x27; of him { jo make

may be required) refpefting all matters re­

prerentativ«s, p)T which fbaU appertain to.hu  
office ; and generally to perfprm ajl fuchfer­  
vices relative to,Jthe finances, as he shall be  
directed to perform.&quot; &#x27; * ,  
This eftaMifhment of the office, evidently  
had no reference beyond the cafe of fuperift­  
tending the regular and ordinary cotitctim of  
tie reunite, and granting warrants for mpnies  
i/fueifriru the treafurj, in parfuamre of appro­  
prlattoas by law.  
  
  
AEST,  
  
[Whole No. 408.]  
  
f The cafe of loans, as an ocoafional and ev­  
&#x27;/&#x27;&#x27;aarclinary resource, waj left to be provided  
,/or by particular laws for the purpoie. The  
Authority with refpeft to the loans in guefli­  
on was accordingly committed to the i&#x27;refi-  
I dent, in order to secure for so special a trnft,  
the higlieft refponiibilityjto he found in the  
government. And .when it was conljdej ed  
that the whole fun&gt; contemplated wkis no lets  
than fourteen millions of dollars; and wLen  
the latitude as to the terms and contracts  
was combined with the vaftnefs of the futn ;  
it might well be questioned whether so great  
a power would have been delegated to any  
man in whom the legiflaturc and the people of  
America, lels confidence than they so j nit­  
ty reposed in the existing chief magiflrate;  
and whether an equal power will ever be coii.-  
nrtte;! to a successor.  
This diftfnftion between the cafe of ordina­  
nary revenue and that of loans, is. not only  
consonant to the a&lt;ftual policy of our Jaws,  
but is foiinded in&#x27;obvious and solid ccnfifleja­  
tious.  
In the collection and dilburlVment of the  
ordiiiary revenues arising from taxation&#x27;,&#x27; the  
bufiriefs flows in official channels; is fubjeft  
lii every stage to official checks ; and the mo­  
ney being w constant influx and effl&#x27;uxj 1:0  
where accumulates in imjnenje fumj.  
Tj&#x27;he ca(e o*&quot;loans is in ail thele pefpefts  
different. In fettling the&#x27;tcirps and arrang­  
ing the negotiations, ther&amp;&#x27;jii aj\yays aii im­  
portant discretion involyecf. the loans  
are foreign as well as great, regulations con­  
cerning the bills offexchangefjfiti&#x27;ailower oc­  
caiop where great latitude is implied in the  
trull. Whilst the the funis fall­  
ing under the fame direction at tlie firne jho­  
ment, prelent a fur thffr and material variance  
between the; two cases.  
The tendency of thele obfervatiofls, js t to  
(hew, that as thi permanent law qlfablifhir.g  
the treafurv t does not extend the  
authority of the secretary to,the cafe of;loanr,  
and as the law authorizing loans, exaftSj for  
special reasons, a refponfibijity from the pre­  
sident himfeTf, the authority of the secretary  
in executing the loans and the appropriation  
of them, rnuft be derived from the JPrefideiit;  
and, cotifequently where the autliiotJty fajls,  
there pan be no resort, to the law eitablifliing  
. much Id&#x27;s tp any general Hif­  
cretion incident to his official charaffer. Jtr  
is,evident,- that the President, although no  
doubt guided by the molt proper confiderati­  
ons&#x27;in employing the agency of the fee etai y  
of the treafuryin the bufineisof the loans,  
might, if lie forjudged fit, Ijave fubfiitiited  
the agency of another ; and that whatcyer  
agency he might prefer, his own inftru&lt;stions  
would always regulate the extent and exfirciia  
of the power conferred,  
, ,Tbe want.of any apparent authority from  
the President had led several gentlemen to in­  
, fift on presumed authorities, fuperce|ding the  
inftruvTi.ons joined with the (jommiifion to the  
secretary : But here again the fair inference  
was to bp revcrfed. A communication of tie  
authorities given by the President to the se­  
cretary as,lto tVie application of the foreign  
loans,had been expreftly requested by.the vote  
of the house. It was not to Be fpppofed that  
the secretary, if he-had received furtjier au­  
, thorities or iiiftruftions would,have faile«£to  
. produce tjhenl, or to ,refer to, them, in the jus­  
tification of his eondjnft. Far leis could it be  
r presumed that the President, if he had given  
any fuperceding authorities or inflruoions,  
would not have caul&#x27;ed them to be coiujmuii­  
-1 cated to the house ; or that he wpuld have  
fuffered a partial communication to iniflead  
the houle into an error, as tofo important a  
fh&lt;st. The President was the last man in (he  
world to whom any measure whatever of a  
deceptive tendency Could be credibly attfi&#x27;ibut-  
  
~ve tei.  
Thus far, said Mr. Madison, bis obfervi&#x27;  
ions had departed as little as pofliblf from thi  
[lieftlon in its ftrifteft sense. He Ihould now  
ivail himfelf of the opportunity afforded b)  
he terms of the last clause, which spoke nt  
Irafts generally, to take a more particular  
lotice of those recently made; in doing which  
ie considered himfclf fafe within the rules of  
he House, which were so rigorously enforced  
igainft the affirmative fide of the question.  
TJie whole amount of foreign Iqans tranf­  
erred directly or indirectly to the United  
itates, appeared from the several statements  
.0 be about three millions of dollars.  
The aipount of the direst draughts was  
(,304,769 13.  
Ot the drafts made ftnee the 16th of Apri),  
1792, and fold by the bank, the proceeds, now  
in the bank, or payable into it, before the Ift  
&gt;f April next, amount to 1,220,4:76 r dollars.  
Of this fuin, 5)0,000 dollars have been drawn  
With, refpeft to time and t&amp;e amount of  
fhefe draftl;, {lithe absolutely unknown  
to tho Legiljature, because the account of  
them had remained in the books of the banlc  
without ever appearing in the books of the  
Treasurer... Mr, JWad)fon conftffed that he  
had toupd po explanations th?t to hjn, were  
fatisfaiftory. He had.looked thrpugh aU the  
reports and all the co:ttmuni&lt;atior.i t&gt;ef«re fa.

•Hon&#x27;e, wit! curt ili.rtcv»iing tliat tfiev  
Had been made by the authority or with tlie  
knowledge of&quot;the President; or lad been re­  
quired for, or applied to the pnrsriafe of the  
public debt; or had been ever CorAinunicated  
to the trufte«s of the (hiking fund, who had  
the direftlon of fuclrporcjiafes; or &#x27;that tbejr  
were the etfeftof any ueceflity. that Cyuld jus­  
tify thtm. \
  
And if there was no evident necciHty f?r  
the proceeding, it w.ai the&gt;moie to be lahisnt­  
ed, chat wbilft we we&#x27;re every where f)n;pa­  
thifing with our in their a&#x27;duousftrug­  
gles for liberty, and echoing from every part  
of the union, our and food  
withe,, the.pecuniary fuct.ouri, lb critically  
necessary to their cause, and the most !üb­  
ftantial proof of the fvueerity of our pri|&#x27;&#x27;ef­  
fio&#x27;ris, (hould be silently withdrawn across the  
Atlantic, from the object for which they w re  
intended ; fuccotirs too, which were not mere­  
ly a tribute of gratitude, of geflerofity, orof  
binevofent zeal for the triumph of liberty;  
hut Si debt moreover of ffricl and positive oft­  
-1 gation, for value ackliowleded and received.  
In contemplating the fubjeft in this point of  
view, lit felt a pain which he cbuld not easily&#x27;  
express ; &quot;and&#x27;to which he persuaded himfelf,  
the bread of no other meni&amp;er could be a  
stranger.  
Laying aside however alt these unfavora­  
ble considerations, the important question still  
remained, why the legislature had been unin­  
formed of the monies so unexpectedly drawn  
into the bank, and to so very great an a­  
mount. If the drafts had received every r«-  
quifite fanftiori—;f they had been produced by  
the mod&#x27;juftifiable caafes, xhe exiflence of  
1,220,476 dollars in a situation so different  
from what had been contemplated, was a fact,  
which the repre-eut&#x27;ativffs of the people had a  
right to know; which it was important&#x27; to  
them, and their c?nditi\ents, that they should  
know; and which it was the indispensable  
duty of the officer charged with it, to&#x27;&#x27; bave  
Iftade known.  
This omission-was the more remarkable,  
when COrtfukred in relation to the measure  
above&#x27; mentioned, of paying off at once the  
whole Dim of 2,609,960 dollars, payable to  
the bank by irtftalments In ten years. A bill  
for this purpose had l&gt;eeji introduced, and was  
on its passage. Tile object of it had been pa­  
tronized by a icport of the Secretary not long  
firttfe Jhadfc- In one of his last reports, be ex­  
pressly among the inducements to such  
extenfiYeirfrafts °f money frotn Europe, that  
they were made &quot; with an eye to placing  
within the reach of the legislature&quot;—the  
means requisite for this object. Was it not  
extraordinary; was it not unaccountable,  
that&#x27;!&#x27;o important a measure (hould be recom­  
mendeclj and be actually introduced, and that  
money otberwife appropriated in Edrope,  
flfOuld be transferred to this country afid de­  
posited in the,{rank, in order that it might be  
within the reach of being applied by tlie legis­  
lature to that meafureand yet that no dif­  
eTofure Jhoukl be made to the legislature of  
the fas, that the money was so drawn aiid  
lay at ttie batik within their reach tot&gt;4&#x27;&lt;bap­  
plied.&#x27;-.  
If any thing could heighten aftonifhroenton  
this oeVaftoii, it inuft be the reason afligned.by  
the Seqf&#x27;etWy tor any obfeurity that might  
. liave hung over our finances,—that till the  
last resolutions, 110 call had been made on the  
department, which rendered it proptr to exhibit  
a.genera) view of the public monies and funds,  
•Or to rfiew the amount and situation of such  
-&gt;as were unapplied.&quot; Mr. Madison would  
not decide that the Legislature was free from  
Maine, in not using more full and efficacious  
means of obtaining such .information, as would  
have removed all obfeurity. But whatever  
degree of blame might fall on them, it never  
eould be admitted, that their calls on the de­  
partment had furnifhed no proptr occasion for  
exhibiting a fnll view of the public finances.  
He referred generally to the various resolu­  
tions, which, without the lead force of con­  
ftruftion, would have extended to every pro­  
per article of information. He reminded the  
committee of the latitude of reports under  
certain other orders of the hnufe ; and asked  
Vjiether less freedom of .ponftruftion was to  
be allowed when information was to he giver,  
tli&#x27;an when power or discretion was £0 be ex­  
ercised ? But independently of this view of  
the raatte{, Mi\ M. held it to be clear and  
palpable, that the very situation of the 1110,  
ney, afforded in occaiion which rendered it  
proper, that the House Ihoaki be informed of  
i*. If ajiberty could be taken&gt; of removing  
. m&#x27;qiiey from Europe where it flood appropri­  
ated by law, to this country, where there was  
nd legal object that required it, and with an  
eye,&quot; as was dated, to an object to which no  
nrOrrey was applicable, without the authority  
of tlie Legislature, how could it possibly be  
. supposed improper to take the furtlier liberty  
of communicating wliat Was done, to tlie Le­  
gislature ?  
He concluded with recurring to the parti­  
ycular form, in which the fubjeft presented it­  
felf to the committee, arid repeating, that  
whatever qualify might be attached to the  
facts charged, or however improper it might  
be thought by some, to proceed-in bade to any  
affirmative decijion on tlrem, it appeared ir­  
reconcileahle with the evidence which had  
been produced, to decide, by a negative vote,  
against the truth of the facts. • •

He w ifhed not, he faid, to wallc  
a tnooftnt of the fmall portion of  
time left, by regretting its iafuffici-  
ency for a full difcuflion of the fub-  
ject before the committee. But he  
thought it due to. truth, and to the  
bono. able and independent motive  
of his coleague (Air. Giles) in pro-  
poftpg ihe refolutions, to remark  
that t&#x27;re latenefs of the day to which  
they had been poftponed, did not juf-.  
tify the tinctures which had been  
mtide on it. If the delay was not to  
beronfidered ss u:nvo ; dabie, fume  
Mime at leaft would fall elfc where.  
The enquiries in which the whole  
bofin&lt; li originated, had b;en moved  
by his col. -igue, and paued the houle  
fome weeks .&quot;go. The reports in  
anf^ver to tbefe enquitic: had not  
been finally made and printed a tin-  
gle day before the prtfent refoluti-  
ons were fubmUted to the houfe.  
He admitted that it might have been  
impracticable to report the informa-  
tion callel for as early as wa« dclir-  
ed by the houfe : He was fendble of  
the .in:-;:c v that woflid he naturally  
felt by the officer called upon, to  
pr:h.nt every confideration that  
taiglitplr.ee his conduct in the moil  
favourable point of ^i -w ; yet v ith  
ail thefe allowances it was ini^iffi-  
b!s to deny that the repcrts con ain ■  
ed things which did not belong to  
them, an.l therefore coidumed nuie  
which belonged to the period for  
dileuffibn. He would mention one  
ihftaoce cn which thete could not  
pouibly be a difference, of opinion,&#x27;  
fit ■ &#x27;I ne vindication formerly un-  
de tta ken by the Secretary, of the po-  
licy of borrowing money acro.id.  
Whether this policy was right or  
wrong, the le^ nature had them-  
felves decided in favor of it ; and it  
was &#x27;he duty of the Secretary in  
complying with the orders of thr  
houfe, to inform the hcufe ho.v the  
law had been executed, not why it  
had betn made : to explain his uv.n  
conduct, not to juftify that of ihe le-  
g Hature.  
  
I t had been aflted why the call for  
ihformation had not been fooner  
made ? The anfwer was obvious  
and liinple. It was nor fnoner per-  
ceived by the houfe, that there was  
fuch a neceffity for it. The want  
  
the bill for paying 2,000,600 of dol-  
lars to the bank, altho&#x27; 200,000 on-  
ly were immediately due, and for  
authoring another foreign loan to  
the amount of 2,000,000 : From the  
dawn of light thrown by fome cir-  
cum dances incident to the occafion,  
on the darknefs in which the houfe.  
lud rejnainedi proceeded . thofe?  
doubts i% enquiries n Inch had led to  
the information now pofsefsed. Hi?  
coleague had great merit in having  
brought about . this developement.  
lie had rendered a fervice highly  
valuable to the leg fhture, and no  
lefs important and acceptable to ihj  
public. ..One good effect of the in-  
formation had been, that it prevent-  
ed the pafsage of the b ll for bor-  
lowing 2,ooo.poo . of dollars as an  
anticipated payment to the bank.

Another conference c ^ tRC re -^  
ports taken together was that the  
face of them prefented. to Ids co-  
league, an evidence of the charge  
co it. lined in the rcfolu&#x27;ions.. Whe-  
ther at fo late a day it was be:t -o

concile this fwraaraoh with the cal-  
nUiioni which M had ftated, and  
  
which were drawn from official do-  
cument?, lie mull rega r d it as an un-&gt;  
quedionable error, prdkluced by fome  
haily view of the fuhject.  
  
Pveturrrfng to the commiffion,  
Mr. M. repeated that all the money  
which t! .at inftrument, defined and  
e^uaRfied by the inflruction annexed  
to ir, authorifed the Secretary to bor-  
row,«was actually and fpecificial&#x27;y  
rporoprialed to the payment of ;ne  
foreign deiit, and under circutn. » ,  
ce? particularly u-gent, in icU:  
to a part of it.  
  
In what manner had this truft  
been carried into execution ? It was  
to be obferved with regret, that on  
the very day, on which the commifli-  
on ami mftrUttio&#x27;n ifTued from the  
Prefident, the Secretary commenced  
his arrangements for diverting part  
of a loan, accepted and ratified by  
virtue of his rommifTion, to a pur-  
p-&gt;fe different from that fpecified and  
required by his inflructiou. That  
a fact of fo extraordinary a com;4ex -  
ion, migiitbe grounded cn the moft  
utK-xcefti mible |.rocf, &gt;.ir M. h ; I  
he lhould take the liberty of tupport-  
ia; il by the authority of the Secre-  
tary Wmfelf. Here he read from  
the&#x27; Secretary&#x27;s letter dared Auguft  
?S, 1790, to the* Dutch Houles from  
whom the loan had been accepted^  
the following paflages, viz: *&#x27; I  
lhould alio wifly, for particular rea-  
fons, that the bufiliefs may be fo re-  
gulated as to give n the form of twO&#x27;  
loans, one for two millions under  
the firrt act, and the crher for ont  
million uniler the fecond. But neU

to be wi ling it (hou!d conftitute an  
einbarraffment.&#x27;*

the direction of Mr. Short, our  
charge del affaires at&quot; that court,  
whoie orders for that puri*)fe you  
will pleafe to follow/&#x27;  
  
The afpect here prcfenfed by a  
e*mparifap of the feveral documemt  
was (&quot;ngular and remarkable. The  
fubordinntc officer appeared in direct  
Oppofirfon to the chief magiflrate.  
The agent was feen overruling by  
his own orders the order* ot his  
principal. The language of the  
Prefidenr, was— By virtue of the  
power verted in me by law, I defltne  
the money to bt borrov.ed ro the  
difcharge of the inftalmcnts and m-  
terefl of the foreign debt.— The larv-  
puage of the Secretary was— I def-  
tirjeapart of the money only to that  
purpofe, an«Up&quot;t tube brought to  
the U. S. for other purposes, he  
left every member id make his own  
reflection on thll view of the fuh-  
ject He would only, obferve in ge-

He then proceeded to a WXt CU1-  
  
tinctview of tl* two points par;icu &#x27;

The ffrft was, H tha\ a certain  
portion of the principal borrowed  
under the act of Augulf 4th, 179^,  
had been applied to the pavrrfcnt of  
the intereft falling due on that prin-  
cipal.&quot; As the fact would nor he

The want of any apparent au-  
thority from the PrcfHent had led  
fevrral gentlemen to inuft cn prefu-  
me&lt;J authorities, fuperceding the  
inftru &#x27;lions jo&#x27;ned with the commif-  
{ion to the Secretary; but here  
a^ain the fair inference was to bs  
reveffed. A comrpunica&#x27;ion of  
the authorities given by the Pre fi •  
dent to the Setrcary as to :! e ap-  
plication of the foreign loans, had  
b^en cxrreiTly requeued by the vote  
o&#x27;~ trie houfe : [t was not to be fup-  
pofed that the Secretary, if he had  
received fun h&quot;r aothoririe.t or in-  
ftf unions wouid have failed to pro-  
duce thertl or to refer to the n, in  
t!«- juftification of his conduct. Far  
left could it be prefumed that the  
PrefrJent, if he had given any fun s -  
Ceding nuthorities or inlfrujions,  
wouid not h?.ve caufed them to be  
cp:nmu&#x27;.icated to the houfe ; of

T£dc in the booXs oft he Treafdi er.  
Mr. M. con felled that he had fotmd  
no explanations {hat to him were

all the reports ami all the commu-

out discovering either that they

linking fund, -.vim had the directi-  
on of I nch pnrchafes ; or that they  
were the effect of any neceh&#x27;ity  
that could j unify them.  
  
And if there w as no evident nc-  
celiity for the proceeding, it was  
the more to be lamented that vhilll  
we were every where fympathiz-  
ing with onr allies, in their ardu-^  
ous druggies for liberty, and echo-  
ing from every pair of the union  
our congratulations and good wim-  
es, the pecuniar^ ficcours, fo criti-  
cally nerellary to their tai.fe, an  
the mod fubitontial prccf of the  
fincetity of our pvofeiiions, fnould  
be iDcntiy withdrawn decofi the  
Atlantic, from the object for which  
they wei e intended ; faccours, too  
w hiclt were not merely a tribute of  
gratitude, of generolity, or of be-  
novelent zeal for the triumph of li-  
berty ; but a debt moreover of ibricl  
and pofitive cbligation, for value  
acknowledged and received. In

lie conldr not caiilv expref; ; and  
towhich h« perfaaded hivtielf, the  
breaft ofno.othet membet- could  
be a ftrange-. \
  
Laying alidej however, all thefe&#x27;  
1 &quot; Arable couliderariohs, Fhe im-  
portant queftion lfill remained,  
why the Legifloture had been un-  
informed of the monies fo unex-  
pedtedly drawn into the bank, and  
10 io very great rfji amount. If the  
drafts had rt-ceived every reqv.i-

written report could be more perfectly mastered, while others  
contended that inquiries would be necessary, and that the  
Secretary ought to be present to answer them, It was re-  
solved to receive the report in writing, and the precedent  
thus established has been followed ever since; though it  
may be seriously questioned whether, if the Secretary were  
allowed to explain his reports and required to answer ques-  
tions put to him orally in the House in regard to them,  
more light would not be cast on the Treasury business and  
greater watchfulness and wisdom be displayed in conducting  
it.  
  
The act establishing the Treasury Department provided  
for the appointment of a Secretary, who was to be the head  
of the Department; and also for an assistant to the Secre-  
tary, who was to be appointed by the Secretary himself;  
a Comptroller, an Auditor, a Treasurer and a Register.  
  
The Secretary was required to digest and prepare plans  
for the improvement and management of the revenue and  
for the support of the public credit; to prepare and report  
estimates of the public revenue and the public expenditures;  
to superintend the collection of the revenue; to decide on  
the forms of keeping and stating accounts and making

require of him; to report and give information to either  
branch of the Legislature in person or in writing respecting  
all matters referred to him by either body, or which should
