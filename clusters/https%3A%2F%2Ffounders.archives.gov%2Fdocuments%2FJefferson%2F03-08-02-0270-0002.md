r  Monticello Mar. 13. 15.  
Your favor of Jan. 30. was recieved after long delay on the road, and I have to thank you for the volume of discourses which you have been so kind as to send me. I have gone over them with great satisfaction, and concur with the able preacher in his estimate of the character of the belligerents in our late war, and lawfulness of defensive war. I consider the war, with him, as ‘made on good advice,’ that is, for just causes, and it’s dispensation as providential, inasmuch as it has exercised our patriotism and submission to order, has planted and invigorated among us arts of urgent necessity, has manifested the strong and the weak parts of our republican institutions, and the excellence of a representative democracy compared with the misrule of kings; has rallied the opinions of mankind to the natural right of expatriation, and of a common property in the ocean, and raised us to that grade in the scale of nations which the bravery and liberality of our citizen-souldiers, by land and by sea, the wisdom of our institutions and their observance of justice entitled us to in the eyes of the world. all this mr Mcleod has well proved, and from those sources of argument particularly which belong to his profession. on one question only I differ from him, and it is that which constitutes the subject of his first discourse, the right of discussing public affairs from in the pulpit. I add the last words because I admit the right in general conversation, and in writing; in which last form it has been exercised in the valuable book you have now favored me with.  
The mass of human concerns, moral and physical, is so vast, the field of the knolege requisite for man to conduct them to best advantage is so extensive, that no human being can acquire the whole himself, and much less in that degree necessary for the instruction of others. it has of necessity then been distributed into different departments, each of which singly may give occupation enough to the whole time and attention of a single individual. thus we have teachers of languages, teachers of mathematics, of Natural philosophy, of chemistry, of medecine, of law, of history, of government Etc. religion too is a separate department, and happens to be the only one deemed requisite for all men, however high or low. collections of men associate together, under the name of congregations, and employ a religious teacher, of the particular sect of opinions of which they happen to be, and contribute to make up a stipend as a compensation for the trouble of delivering them, at such periods as they agree on, lessons in the religion they profess. if they want instruction in other sciences or arts, they apply to other instructors, and this is generally the business of early life. but I suppose there is not an instance of a single congregation which has employed their preacher for the mixt purposes of lecturing them from the pulpit, in chemistry, in medecine, in law, in the science and principles of government, or in any thing but religion exclusively. whenever therefore preachers, instead of a lesson in religion, put them off with a discourse on the Copernican system, on chemical affinities, on the construction of government, or the characters or conduct of those administering it, it is a breach of contract, depriving their audience of the kind of service for which they are salaried, and giving them, instead of it, what they did not want, or, if wanted, would rather seek from better sources in that particular art or science. in chusing our pastor we look to his religious qualifications, without enquiring into his physical or political dogmas, with which we mean to have nothing to do. I am aware that arguments may be found which may twist a thread of politics into the cord of religious duties. so may they for every other branch of human art or science. thus, for example, it is a religious duty to obey the laws of our country. the teacher of religion therefore must instruct us in those laws, that we may know how to obey them. it is a religious duty to assist our sick neighbors: the preacher must therefore teach us medecine, that we may do it understandingly. it is a religious duty to preserve our own health: our religious teacher then must tell us what dishes are wholsome, and give us recipes in cookery, that we may learn how to prepare them. and so ingenuity, by generalising more and more, may amalgamate all the branches of science into any one of them, and the physician who is paid to visit the sick, may give a sermon instead of medecine; and the merchant to whom money is sent for a hat, may send a handkerchief instead of it. but notwithstanding this possible confusion of all sciences into one, common sense draws lines between them sufficiently distinct for the general purposes of life, and no one is at a loss to understand that a recipe in medecine or cookery, or a demonstration in geometry, is not a lesson in religion.I do not deny but that a congregation may, if they please, agree with their preacher that he shall instruct them in medecine also, or law, or politics. then lectures in these, from the pulpit, become not only a matter of right, but of duty also. but this must be with the consent of every individual; because the association being voluntary, the mere majority has no right to apply the contributions of the minority to purposes unspecified in the agreement of the congregation. I agree too that on all other occasions the preacher has the right, equally with every other citizen, to express his sentiments, in speaking or writing, on the subjects of medecine, law, politics, Etc his leisure time being his own, and his congregation not obliged to listen to his conversation, or to read his writings; and no one would have regretted more than myself, had any scruple as to this right witheld from us the valuable discourses which have led to the expression of an opinion as to the true limits of the right. I feel my portion of indebtment to the reverend author, for the distinguished learning, the logic and the eloquence with which he has proved that religion, as well as reason, confirms the soundness of those principles on which our government has been founded and it’s rights asserted.  
These are my views of this question. they are in opposition to those of the highly respected and able preacher, and are therefore the more doubtingly offered. difference of opinion leads to enquiry, and enquiry to truth; and that, I am sure, is the ultimate and sincere object of us both. we both value too much the freedom of opinion sanctioned by our constitution, not to think cherish it’s exercise even where in opposition to ourselves.  
Unaccustomed to reserve or mystery in the expression of my opinions, I have opened myself frankly on a question suggested by your letter and present. and altho’ I have not the honor of your acquaintance, this mark of attention, and still more the sentiments of esteem so kindly expressed in your letter, are entitled to a confidence that observations not intended for the public will not be ushered to their notice, as has happened to me sometimes. tranquility, at my age, is the balm of life. while I know I am safe in the honor &amp; charity of a Mcleod, I do not wish to be cast forth to the Marats, the Dantons, &amp; the Robespierres of the priesthood: I mean the Parishes, the Ogdens, and the Gardiners of Massachusets.  
I pray you to accept the assurances of my esteem &amp; respectTh: Jefferson

works :  
The mass of human concerns, moral and  
physical, is so vast, the field of knowledge  
requisite for man to conduct them to tho  
best advantage is so extensive, that no hu­  
man being can acquire the wholo himself,  
and much less in that degree necessary for  
the instruction of others. It has of neces­  
sity, then, been distributed into different de­  
partments, each of which, singly, may give  
occupation enough to tho whole time and  
attention of a single individual.  
Thus we have teachers of language, teach­  
ers of mathematics, of uatural philosophy, of  
chemibtry,of medicine, of law, of history, of  
  
government, &amp;c.  
  
Religion, too, is a separate uepaitmcnt, and  
happens to be the only one deemed requisite  
for all men, however high or low.  
Collections of men associate together un­  
der the name of congregations, and employ  
a religious teacher of the particular sect of  
opinions of which they happen to be, and  
contribute to make up a stipend as a com­  
pensation for the trouble of delivering them,  
  
at such periods as they agree on, lessons in  
  
the religion they profess.  
If they want instruction in other sciences  
  
or arts, they apply to other instructors ; and  
  
this is generally the business of early life.  
  
Bnt I supi-ose there is not an instance ot a  
  
single congiegation which has employed their  
  
preacher for the mixed purpose of lecturing  
  
puipit in aittmvstcy, in rneai  
  
Ik  
  
am trn-m  
  
cice,in law, in the science and principles of  
  
government, or in anything but religion ex­  
clusively.Whenever, therefore, preachers, instead of  
a lesson iu religion, put them off with a dis­  
course on the Copernican system, on chemi­  
cal affinities&#x27;, on tho construction of govern­  
ment, or the character or conduct of those  
administering it, it is a breach of contract,  
depriving their audiences of the kind of ser­  
vice for which they are salaried, and giving  
them instead of it what they did not want;  
or, if wanted, would rather seek from better  
sources in that particular art or science.  
In choosing our pastor, we look to his re­  
ligions qualifications, without inquiring into  
his physical or political dogmas, with which  
we mean to have nothing to do.

gone over them with great satisfaction,  
and concur with the able preacher in his  
estimate of the belligerents in our late

&quot; made on good advice,&quot; that is for just  
causes, and its dispensation as providen­  
tial, inasmuch as it has exercised our  
patriotism aud submission to order, has  
plauted and invigorated apiong us arts  
of urgent necessity, has manifested the  
  
strong and the weak part of our republi­

a representative Democracy compared  
with the misrule of kings, has rallied  
the opinions of mankind to the natural  
rights of expatriation, and of a common  
property iu tho ocean, and raised ua to  
that grade in the scale of nations which  
the bravery and liberality of our ciiizuu  
soldiers by land and by sea, the wisdom  
  
of our iubtitutions aud their observance  
of justice, entitled us to in the eyes of  
the world. All this Mr. McLeod has  
well proved, and from those sources of  
argument parliculary, which belong to  
h&#x27;a profession,  
0:i oi;o question only I differ from  
him, and it is that which constitutes the  
subject cf his first discourse, the right  
of discussing public affairs in the pulpit.  
I add the last words because I admit  
the right ia general conversation and iu  
writing, in which last farm it has been  
exercised in the valuable book yoj have

The mass of human concerns, moral

that no human being can acquire the

Thus we have teachers of Languages,

ple, it is a religious duty to obey the

religious duty to preserve our own health;

Montickllo, March lo, 181a.  
,:Sir: Your favor of January 30, was duly  
  
received, after long delay on the road, and I have  
  
to thank you for the volume of discourcos which  
  
you have been so kind as to send me.- I havo  
  
gone over tham with great satisfaction, and con  
  
cur with tha able preacher in his estimate o&#x27;  
the belligerents in our lato war. I consider the  
  
war, with him, &quot;made on good advico,&quot; that is  
  
for just causes, and its dispensation as provi­  
dential, inasmuch as it has exercised our patri­  
otism and submission to order, has planted and  
  
invigorated anions us arts of urgent necessity,  
lias manifested tho strong and thu weak part of  
our republican institutions and the excollonce  
of a representative Democracy compared with  
the misrule of. Kings, has rallied, the opinions  
of mankind to tho natural rights of expatria­  
tion, and of a common property in tits ocean,  
and raisod us to that grade in the sctle of na  
  
tions which the bravery and liberality of our  
citizen soldiers by land and by sea, the wis-  
doin of our institutions and their observance of  
justice, entitled us to in the eyes of tho world.  
All this Mr. JIcLiodhas Welt proved, and from  
those sources of argument particularly, which  
belong to his profession. &quot; &#x27;  
&quot;On one question only I differ from him, and  
it is that which constitutes tho subject of his  
first discourse, tho righ!; of diseasing public af  
  
fairs in tho pulpit. I a id the last words bo­  
cause I admit tho right in general conversation  
and in writing, in which last form it has been  
exercised in the valuable book you have fuvorod  
me with.  
  
The mis? of humin concern, moral and  
  
physical is so va3t; the field of knowledge re­  
quisite for man to conduct to the best advan­  
tage is so cxtensivo, that no human being can  
  
acquire ths whole himself, and much less in that  
degree nscossary for tha injtruction of others.  
It has of necessity, then, bean distributed  
into different departments, each of which, sin­  
gly, mav givo occupation enough to the who!e  
  
time and attention of a single individual. - &#x27;  
&quot;Thus wa have teachers of Languages, tea.  
chers of Mathematics of Natural Philosophy,  
of Chemistry, of Medicine, of Law, of History,  
of Government, &amp;c. . Religion, too, is a sepa­  
rate department, and happens to be the only  
  
one deemed requisite for all men, high or low.  
&quot;Collections of men associate together, un­  
der the name of conceptions&#x27;, and employ a  
  
religious teacher of the particulor sect of opin­  
ions which they happsn&#x27;to be, an I- contribute  
to make up a stipond as a Compensation for tho  
trouble of delivering thein, at- such periods as  
  
they agree on, Iossom in the religion theyprofess.  
  
&quot;If they want instruction in other scionces  
  
orarts, they apply to other instructors; and  
this i3 generally the businews of early life. But  
  
suppose there is not an instance of a single  
  
congregation which has employed their preach­  
er for the mixed purposes of lecturing them  
  
frorn the pulpit, on chemistry, on medicine, on  
  
aw, on the science and principles of govern  
  
ment, or in anything but religion exclusively.  
  
Whonever, therefore, preachers instead of les  
  
sons in religion, put them off with a discourse  
  
on tha Copernican system, on chemical affini  
  
ties, on tho contract, depriving thoir1 audionip  
of the kind service for which they are sala&#x27;riod,  
  
and giving them instoad of it, what thoy- did  
  
not want, or, if wanted, would rather seek from  
  
bettor souraos in that particular art or scienco.  
  
In choosing our pastor wo look to his religious  
  
qualifications, without inquiring into his phyg.  
  
ical or political dogmas, with which we mean to  
  
have nothing to do.  
  
&quot;I am aware that arguments may be found  
  
which may twist a thread of politics into a cord  
  
of religious duties. So may th&#x27;ay for. every oth  
  
r branch of human art or science.&quot; &#x27; Thus, for  
  
example, it is a. religious duty , to &#x27;obey the  
laws of our country; tha&quot; taachor of religion,  
  
insreiore, musi. iidm ucii ut 111 iuoso laws, mat  
  
we may know how to obey thorn, &#x27; It is a roli-  
  
gious duty to assist our sick neighbor; the prea  
  
cher must, therefore, teach us msdiciho, that wp  
  
may do it undorstandingly., It is a religious  
duty to preserve our own hoalth; our religious  
  
teacher, inon, must tea us wnai , autnes, are  
wholesome and give us.rcc&#x27;ipe&#x27;s&#x27;in cookery, that  
  
we may loara hoyv to prepare them.- And so  
  
ingenuity, by generalizing raqre and more, -may  
  
amalgamate all the branches of science into any  
  
one of them, and tho physician who is paid to  
Visit the&#x27;sick may give a sermon instead, of med-  
  
icinet and the merchant to whom money is sent  
  
for a hat,&#x27; may send a handkerchief Instoad -of  
  
tt. But,&#x27; notwithstanding this possible confu  
  
sion of all sciences into one,1 common Bensa  
  
draws lines betweorrsuulcientljr distinct1 for the  
  
general purposes of life, and no one is at&#x27; a3 loss  
  
to understand that a recipe of medicine or cook  
  
ery, or a demonstration in geometry, is not a  
lesson in religion. I do not deny that a congre­  
gation may, if they please, agree with their prea­  
cher that be shall instruct them in medicine,  
aUo, or law, or politics.  
&quot;Then, lectures in these, from the pulpit, be­  
come not only a matter of right, but of duty al­  
so. But this must be with the consent of every  
  
individual; because the association being volun  
  
tary, the mere majority has no right to apply  
the contributions of the minority tt purposes  
  
unspecified in the agreement of the congrega­  
tion. , 1 agree, too, that on all other occasions,  
the preacher has his right, equally with every  
other citizen, to express his sentiments in speak  
  
ing or writing on the subjects of medicine, law,  
politics, &amp;c.. His leisure time being hia cwn,  
and his congregation not obliged to listen to his  
conversation or read his writings; and no one  
  
would have regretted more than myself, had  
  
any scruple as to this right, withheld from us  
  
the valuable discources which have lea to tue  
expression of an opinion as to the true lishits  
of the right.

&quot;These are my views of this question, They  
are in opposition to those of the highly respect­  
ed and able preacher, and are therefore the more  
doubtingly offered. - Difference of opinion leads  
to inquiry, and inquiry to truth, and that, lam  
  
sure, is the ultimate and sincere object ef us

the honor of your acquaintance, this mark of  
attention, and still more the enactments of es­

titled to a confidence that observations not in­

Tranquility, at my ago, is the balm of life.

Sir:  
On one question only I differ from him, and  
it is that which constitutes the subjeot of his  
first discussing public affairs in the pulpit. I  
add the last words, because I admit the right  
in general conversation and in writing, in  
which last form it has been exercised in the  
Aimirable book you have now favored me  
with.  
The mass of human concarns! mocal and  
tributed into different departments, each of  
which, singly, may give occupation enough to  
have teachers of Langn  
teachers of Mathematics, of Natural Philoso-  
phy, of Chemistry, of Medicine, of Law, of  
History, of Government, ke. Religion, too,  
parate department, and happens to be  
the only one deemed requisite for all men,  
  
however high or low. Collections of men as  
sociate together, under the name of associa  
tions, and employ a religions teacher of the  
ne etienlay aeot os eutelon of mtet e   
ing them, at such periods as they agree  
lessons in the religion they profess. If they  
want instructions in other sciences or arts,  
they apply to other instructors, and this i  
generally the business of early life. But I  
suppose there is not a single instance of a  
congregation which has employed their  
preacher for a mixed purpose of lecturing  
them from the pulpit, in chemistry, in medi-  
cince, in the science and principles of Gov  
ernment, or in anything but religion exclus-  
ively.  
Whenever, therefore, preachers, instead of  
a lesson of religion, put them off with a dis-  
on the Copernican avstem on chemi  
cal affinities, on the constructions of Govern  
ment or the character of these administering  
 it is a breach of contract, depriving their  
e o a  
theey ale salalied, and giving thehl thstend o  
it, what they did not want, or if wanted, would

to do. I am aware that arguments may be  
tound, which may twist a thread of politics  
into the cord of religious duties. So they may  
 for every other branch of human art or science.  
1o  
Thus, for example, it is a religious duty to  
obey the laws of our country; the teacher of  
religion, therefore, must instruct us in those  
laws that we may know how to obey them. It  
is a religious duty to assist our sick neigh  
bors; the preacher, must therefore, teach us  
medicine that we may do it understandingly,  
it is a religious duty to preserve our health;  
our teacher, then, must tell us what dishes are  
wholesome, and give receipts for cookery, that  
we may learn how to prepare them. And so  
ingenuity, by generalizing more and more,  
may amalgamate all the branches of science  
into one of them, and the physician who is  
paid to visit the sick, may give a sermon in  
stead of medicine; and the merchant to whom  
 money is sent for a hat, may send a hanker-  
chief instead of it. But notwithstanding this  
possible confusion of all sciences into one,  
common sense draws lines between them  
sufficiently distinct for the general purposes  
of life, and no one is at a loss to understand  
that a recipe in medicine or cookery, or a de  
monstration in geometry, is not a lesson in

may, if they please, agree with their preacher  
that he shall instruct them in medicine also,  
or law, or politics. Then, lectures in these,

 association being voluntary, the mere majori-

human being can acquire the whole himself,  
and much less the degree necessary for the  
instruction of others. It has of necessity  
then, been distributed into different depart­  
ments, each of which, singly, may give oc­  
cupation enough to the whole time and at­  
tention of a single individual. Thus we  
have teachers of Languages, teachers of  
Mathematics, of Natural Philosophy, of  
Chemistry, of Medicine, of Law, of History,  
of Government, &amp;c. Religion, to0, is a  
separate department, and happens to be the  
only one deemed requisite for all men, how-  
ever high or low. Collections of men as­  
sociate together, under the name of associa­  
tions, and employ a religious teacher of the  
particular sect or opinion of which they  
happen to be, and contribute to make up a  
stipend as a compensation for the trouble of  
delivering them, at such periods as they  
agree on, lessons in the religion they profess.  
If they want instructions in other sciences  
or arts, they apply to other instructors, and  
this is generally the business of early life.  
But I suppose there is not a single instance  
of a congregation which has employed their  
preacher for a mixed purpose of lecturing  
them from the pulpit, in chemistry in medi­  
cine, in the science and principles of Gov­  
ernment, or in anything but religion ex  
clusively.e   
Whenever, therefore, preachers, instead  
of a lesson of religion, put them off with a  
discourse on the Copernican system, on  
chemical affinities, on the constructions of  
Government or the character of those ad-  
ministering it, it is a breach of contract,  
depriving their audience of the kind of  
service for which they are salaried; and  
giving them instead of it, what they did  
not want, or if wanted, would rather seek  
from better sources in that particular art  
or science. In choosing our pastor we look  
to his religious qualifications, without in­  
quiring into his physical or political dog­  
mas with which we mean to have nothing  
to do. I am aware that arguments may be  
found, which may twist a thread of politics  
into the cord of religious duties. So they  
may for every other branch of human art  
or science. Thus, for example, it is a re  
ligious duty to obey the laws of our coun­  
try; the teacher of religion, therefore, must  
instruct us in those laws that we may know  
how to obey them. It is a religious duty  
to assist our sick neighbors; the preacher  
must, therefore, teach us medicine that we  
may do it understandingly; it is a religious  
duty to preserve our health; our teacher,  
then, must tell us what dishes are whole­  
some, and give receipts for cookery, that  
we may fearn how to prepare them. And  
so ingenuity, by generalizing more and  
more, may amalgamate all the branches of  
science into one of them, and the physician  
who is paid to visit the sick, may give a  
sermon instead of medicine; and the mer­  
chant to whom money is sent for a hat,  
may send a hankerchief instead of it. But  
notwithstanding this possible confusion of  
all sciences into one, common sense draws  
lines between them sufficiently distinct for  
the general purposes of life, and no one is at a  
loss to understand that a recipe in medicine  
for cookery, or a demonstration in geometry.  
is not a lesson in religion. I do not deny that  
a congregation may, if they please, agree  
with their preacher that he shall instruct  
them in medicine also, or law, or polities.  
Then, lectures in these, from the pulpit, be­  
come not only a matter of right, but of du­  
ty also. But this must be with the consent  
of every individual; because the associa­  
tion be ing voluntary, the mere majority has  
no right to apply the contributions of the  
minority to purposes unspecified in the  
agreement of the Congregation.  
Very sincerely.

Sir : On one question only I differ  
from him, and it is that which constitutes  
the subject of bis disoouree the right of  
discussion ot public affsirs in tho pulpit. 1  
add .tho last words because I admit the  
right in general conversation and in  
writing, in which lost form it has been  
exercised in the admirable book yon have  
now favored mo with. it.  
The mass of human conocrns, moral  
and physical, is lo vast, iho ficliof knowl  
edge requisite for man to conduct them to  
the best advantage is so extensive, that  
no human being can acquire the whole  
himself, and much loss in the dfljireo nco­  
essnry for the iiutruolion of others. It  
has of necessity then boon distributed in.  
to different departments, each of which,  
Mngly, may give occupation enough to  
tho whole time and attention of a single  
individual. &#x27; Thus wa havo teadicrs of  
languages, ; teachers of mathematics, of  
nataral philosophy, of chemistry, of med  
ioine. nf law. of history, of rovcinment,  
  
etc Religion, t!o, is.a separate dcftttegenfcr2ato Empire.

hied or low. uancciions 01 men  
associates together under the name of as  
socintions, and employ a religious teacher  
of tbe particular seet or opinicu or winch  
they happen to bo, and contribute totnuke  
up a slipend as a compensation &quot;for the  
trouble of delivering them at such peri&#x27;ofr:  
as they agree on. lessons in tho religion  
they profess.&#x27;: If they want instruction in&#x27;  
in -other scitneo and arts they apply to  
other instructors; and this is generally  
tho business of early ma. But 1 suppis?  
there is hot a single instance of a con ere  
galinn which has employed their preacher!  
tor tho mixed purpo e ot lecturing then1  
from tho pulpit in chemistry in medicine.  
in the sciences and principles of govern­  
ment, or in anything but religion exclu­  
sively. Whenever, therefore, preachers  
instead of a lesson in religion, put them  
off with a disoourse on the Copcrnican  
,;yslein, on ohemionl othmtcs, on tho con  
siruclion of government or conduct of  
those administering it, it is a 4ireaoh of  
contract, depriving their nuuionco of the  
kind nf service forwhiuh they aio salaried,  
and giving them instead ot what they did  
not w nt, of if wanted would rather seek  
from better sconrses In that particular art  
ersoiencr. In choosing our pastor, we look  
to religious qtialificaiions, without inquir  
ing into his physical or political dogmas,  
whth which we mean to hove nothing to  
do. 1 am awaro that arguments may be  
found, whioh may twist a (bread of pqli­  
tics. into the cord of religious duties&#x27; . 80  
may they for&#x27; every otlior branch of hu­  
man art br ecionoe. . &#x27; &quot; . . .  
Thus, for example, It is a religious duly  
tooboytho lawaof our country ; the teach  
er of .religion,, therefore, must instruot  
us in those laws, that we may know how  
to obey thorn. It is a religious duty lo  
assist our sick neighbors ; tho preacher  
must, there-lore, teach ns medicine, that  
wc may do it nndoTwtandtngly. It is a  
religious duty to preservo our health; our  
religions teacher, then; must tell us what  
dislioj are wholesome, and givo us&quot; recipes  
for c&#x27;d&#x27;okcry, thotw may know. how to  
prepare them. . And so ingenuity, by  
generalising more ana more, may amalga­  
mate all brnnolios of soienoea into any one  
of them ; and the physician,&#x27; who is paid  
to. visit the sick, may gavo a sermon in  
stead of medicno; and, the merchant, to  
whom money is sent for a hat, may send a  
haodkorchii&#x27;t instead or. it - A reeipo in  
mcdioine or cookery, or a demonstration  
in geometry, is not a lesson in religion.  
I do not deny that a congregation may, if  
t.iioy please, agroa with their preacher  
mat he shall instruot them in medicine  
also, or law, or politics. Then lcoturcs in  
these from the pulpit becomo not only a  
matter ol r&#x27;ght but ot duty also. But  
this must be with tho consont of every in­  
dividual, because the association being  
voluntary, the more majority his no right  
to apply the contributions of the minority  
to putposes unspecified in the agreement  
ol tho congregation-&#x27; &#x27;.&#x27;.
