Monticello Mar 6. 22.  
  
I have duly recieved your letter of Feb. 16. and have now to express my sense of the honorable station proposed to my ex-brethren and myself in the constitution of the society for the civilisation and improvement of the Indian tribes. the object too expressed as that of the association is one which I have ever had much at heart, and never omitted an occasion of promoting while I have been in situations to do it with effect. and nothing even now in the calm of age and retirement, would excite in me a more lively interest than an approvable plan of raising that respectable and unfortunate people from the state of physical and moral abjection to which they have been reduced by circumstances foreign to them. that the plan now proposed is entitled to unmixed approbation, I am not prepared to say, after mature consideration, and with all the partialities which it’s professed object would rightfully claim from me. I shall not undertake to draw the line of demarcation between private associations of laudable views and unimposing numbers, and those whose magnitude may rivalise &amp; jeopardise the march of regular government. yet such a line does exist. I have seen the days, they were those which preceded the revolution, when even this last and perilous engine became necessary. but they were days which no man would wish to see a second time. that was the case where the regular authorities of the government had combined against the rights of the people, and no means of correction remained to them but to organise a collateral power which, with their support, might rescue and secure their violated rights. but such is not the case with our government. we need hazard no collateral power which by a change of it’s original views, and assumption of others we know not how virtuous or how mischievous, would be ready organised &amp; in force sufficient to shake the established foundations of society, and endanger it’s peace and the principles on which it is based. Is not the machine now proposed of this gigantic stature? it is to consist of the Ex-presidents of the US. the Vice-president, the heads of all the Executive departments, the members of the supreme judiciary, the governors of the several states and territories, all the members of both houses of Congress, all the General officers of the army, the Commissioners of the Navy, all Presidents and Professors of Colleges and Theological seminaries, all the Clergy, of the US. the Presidents and Secretaries of all associations having relation to Indians, all commanding officers within or near Indian territories, all Indian Superintendants and Agents; all these ex officio; and as many private individuals as will pay a certain price for membership. observe too that the Clergy will constitute   
*the clergy of the US. may probably be estimated at 8000. the residue of this society at 400. but if the former number be halved the reasoning will be the same.  
nineteen twentieths of this association, and by the law of the majority, may command the 20th part, which, composed of all the high authorities of the US. civil and military, may be outvoted and wielded by the 19. parts with uncontrolable power, both as to purpose and process. Can this formidable array be reviewed without dismay? it will be said that in this association will be all the confidential officers of the government, the choice of the people themselves. no man on earth has more implicit confidence than myself in the integrity and discretion of this chosen band of servants. but is confidence or discretion, or is strict limit, the principle of our constitution? it will  comprehend indeed all the functionaries of the government, but seceded from their constitutional stations as guardians of the nation, and acting, not by the laws of their station, but by those of a voluntary society having no limit to their purposes but the same will which constitutes their existence. it will be the authorities of the people and all influential characters from among them, arrayed on one side, and on the other the people themselves, deserted by their leaders. it is a fearful array. it will be said that these are imaginary fears. I know they are so at present. I know it is as impossible for these agents of our choice and unbounded confidence to harbor machinations against the adored principles of our constitution, as for Gravity to change it’s direction, and gravid bodies to mount upwards. the fears are indeed imaginary; but the example is real. under it’s authority, as a precedent, future associations will arise with objects at which we should shudder at this time. the society of Jacobins, in another country, was instituted on principles and views as virtuous as ever kindled the hearts of patriots. it was the pure patriotism of their purposes which extended their association to the limits of the nation, and rendered their power within it boundless; and it was this power which corrupted degenerated their principles and practices to such enormities as never before could have been imagined. yet these were men; and we and our descendants will be no more. the present is a case where, if ever, we are to guard against ourselves. not against ourselves as we are, but as we may be. for who can now imagine what we may become under circumstances not now imaginable? the object too of this institution seems to require so hazardous an example as little as any one which could be proposed. the Government is at this time going on with the process of civilising the Indians on a plan probably as promising as any one of us is able to devise; and with resources more competent than we could expect to command by voluntary taxation. is it that the new characters called into association with those of the government are wiser than these? is it that a plan, originated by a meeting of private individuals is better than that prepared by the concentrated wisdom of the nation, of men not self-chosen but clothed with the full confidence of the people? is it that there is no danger that a new authority, marching independantly along side of the government, in the same line, and to the same object, may not produce collision, may not thwart &amp; obstruct the operations of the government, or wrest the object entirely from their hands? might we not as well appoint a committee for each department of the government, to counsel &amp; direct it’s head separately, as volunteer ourselves to counsel and direct the whole in mass? &amp; might we not do it as well for their foreign, their fiscal, &amp; their military, as for their Indian affairs? and how many societies, auxiliary to the government, may we expect to see spring up, in imitation of this, offering to associate themselves in this and that of it’s functions? in a word, why not take the government out of it’s constitutional hands, associate them indeed with us to preserve a semblance that the acts are theirs, but ensuring them to be our own by allowing them a minor vote only?  
These considerations have impressed my mind with a force so irresistable, that, (in duty bound to answer your polite letter, without which I should not have obtruded an opinion) I have not been able to withold the expression of them. not knowing the individuals who have proposed this plan, I cannot be concieved as entertaining personal disrespect for them. on the contrary, I see in the printed list persons for whom I cherish sentiments of sincere friendship; and others for whose opinions and purity of purpose I have the highest personal respect. yet thinking, as I do, that this association is unnecessary, that the government is proceeding to the same object under controul of the law, that they are competent to it in wisdom, in means and inclination, that this association, this wheel within a wheel is more likely to produce collision than aid, and that it is, in it’s magnitude, of dangerous example, I am bound to say that, as a dutiful citizen, I cannot in conscience become a member of this society, possessing, as it does, my entire confidence in the integrity of it’s views. I feel with awe the weight of opinion to which I may be opposed, and that, for myself, I have need to ask the indulgence of a belief that the opinion I have given is the best result I can deduce from my own reason and experience, and that it is sincerely conscientious. repeating therefore my just acknolegements for the honor proposed to me, I beg leave to add the assurances, to the society &amp; yourself of my highest confidence and consideration.

Movnc,::.Lo. March C. 1®22.  
Sin: I have duly received your letter of Febru­  
ary lWth,nnd have now to express my sense of the  
honorable station, proposed to my ex-brethren and j  
myself, in the Constitution of the Society, for the)  
civilization and improvement of the Indian tribes.  
The object, too. expressed, as that of the associa­  
tion, is one which 1 hove ever had much at heart,  
and never on.:,ted an occasion of promoting, while  
1 have been in situations to do it with effect. And  
nothing, even now, in tho calm of age and retire­  
ment, \yould excite in tnc a more lively interest  
than an approvable plan of raising that respectable  
and unfortunate people from the state of physical  
and moral abjection, to which they have been re­  
duced, -by circumstances foreign to them. That  
the plan, now proposed, is entitled to unmixed ap­  
probation, I am not prepared to say. After mature  
consideration and with ail the partialities, which its  
professed object would rightfully claim from me, I  
shall not undertake to draw the line of demarca­  
tion between private associations of laudable  
views awl itnitnposing numbers, and those whose  
magnitude may rivalize the inarch of regular  
Government. Thi such a line docs exist. I j  
have seen the days—they were those whit h pre­  
ceded the revolution, when even this List and  
perilous engine became necessary. JJut they ,  
were iLays wtiiehno man Would wish tp see a sc- j  
cond time. That was the case, tnhei&#x27;e the regular!  
authorities of the Government had combined&#x27;,  
against the rights of the people, and no means,  
of correction remained to them, but to organize  
a collateral power, which, with their support, j  
might rescue and secure their violated rights.— j  
Hut such is not the case with our Government.— &#x27;•  
  
rYc need hazard no collateral power, which, In/  
a change of its original views, and assumption if  
others u-e know not how virtuous or how mis- 1  
chievous, would be ready organized and in force  
sufficient to shake the established foundations of  
society, and endanger its peace and the principles  
oil which it is based. Is not tlni machine now  
proposed of this gigantic stature? It is to consist of  
the Ex-Presidents of the United States, the Vice  
Presidents, the Heads of all the Executive De­  
partments, the Members ot the Supreme Judici­  
ary, the GovdVnors of the several States and Ter­  
ritories, all the Members of Loth Houses pf Con- I  
gress, all the General Officers of the Army, the !  
Commissioners of the Navy, all Presidents and  
Professors of Colleges and rheological Seminaries,  
all the Clergy of the United States, the Presidents  
,and Secretaries of all associations having relation  
to Indiana, all Commanding Officers within or near  
Indian Territories, all Indian Superintendents and  
Agents; all these ex-officio and as many private  
individuals as will pay a certain price for member­  
ship. Obierve, too, that the Clergy will consti­  
tute * nineteen-twentieths of this association, and,,  
by the law of the majority, may command the  
twentieth part, composed of all the high authori­  
ties of the United States; civil and military. These &#x27;  
may he outvoted by the nineteenth parts&#x27;with un­  
controlable power, both as to purpose and process.  
Can this formidable array be reviewed without  
dismay.&#x27; it will bo said, that in this association,  
will he all the confidential officers of the Govern­  
ment, the choice of the people themselves. No  
man on earth has more implicit confidence than  
myself in the integrity and discretion of this cho­  
sen band til servants; but i, confidence m discre­  
tion, or is strict, limit, the principle of our consti­  
tution? It will comprehend, indeed, all the func­  
tionaries of the Government, but seceded from  
, their constitutional stations ns guardians of the  
j nation, and acting, not by the laws of their sta­  
i lion, bat by those of a voluntary society, having  
j no limit to their purposes, hut the same trill  
I which constitutes their existence. It will be, the  
authorities of the people and all influential char­  
acters among them, arrai/ed on one side and on  
the other, the. people desert -1 by their leaders.  
It is a fearful array. It wilk he said that these  
are imaginary fears. I know they arc so at pre­  
sent. 1 know it is ns impossible for these agents  
of our choice and unbounded confidence to harbor  
machinations against the adorable principles of our  
  
Constitution, as lor gravity to change its direction  
and gravid bodies to mount upwards. The fears  
ire, indeed, imaginary, but the example is real.—  
Under its authority, as a precedent, future associa­  
tions w ill arise, with objects with which we should  
shudder, at this time. The Society of Jacobins, in  
another country, was instituted on principles and  
views as virtuous ai ever kindled the hearts of  
Patriots. It wax the pure patriotism of their  
purposes, which extended their association to the  
limits of the notion, and rendered their power  
within it boundless: and it was their power which  
degenerated their principles and practices to  
such enormities as never before could have, been  
imagined; yet dieso were men and we ami our  
descendants will be no more. The present is a  
case, where, if over we arc to guard against our­  
selves: not against ourselves as we are, but as we  
may he, for who can now imagine what w o rnav  
become under circumstances not now imaginable.1  
The object, too, of this institution seems to require  
so hazardous an example, as little ns any one  
which could be proposed. The Government is, at  
this time, going on with the process of civilizing  
j the Indians, on a plan probably as promising as  
| any one of ns is able to devise, and with resources  
. more competent than we could expect to command  
! by voluntary taxation. Is it that then w charac­  
i tecs called into association with those rf the Go­  
vernment are wiser thou these; is it that a plan  
originated by a meeting of private individuals, is  
better than that prepared by the concentrated w is­  
dom of the nation, of men not self-chosen, but  
clothed w ith the full confidence of the people? Is  
it thru there is no Hanger that a new authority,  
marching independently alongside the Govern­  
ment in the same line and to the same ohjrrt, may  
not produce collision, may not thwart and ob­  
struct the operations of the Government, or wrest  
the object entirety from their hands/ Might* we  
not an well appoint a Committee for each jtepart­  
nv nt of the Governor nt to conn-el and direct its  
head separately, as volunteer ourselve ? to counsel  
and direct the whole in mass; ami might we not  
| do it as well for heir foreign, their fjsc d and their  
military, as for their indian affairs? ami how many  
societies, auxiliary to the Government, may we  
not expert to see spring up in imitation of this,  
offering to associate themselves in this awl that  
of its functions? In a word, why not take the  
Government out of its constitutional hands, »*.o­  
ciatc them,- indeed, with us, to preserve a sem­  
blance that the acts arc theirs, but ensuring them  
to be. our own, by allowing them a minor vote  
only? j  
The«e considerations have impre-ssed my mind  
with a force so irresistible, that (in duty bound to  
I answer your jiolite letter, without which, I should &#x27;  
I not have obtruded my opinion.) I have not been I  
ablo to withhold the expression of them. Not I

, Monticello, March 6, 1822.  
Sir: T have duly received your letter  
of February l6th, and have now to ex  
press my sense of the honorable station,  
proposed to my ex-brethren and myself.  
in the Constitution of the Society for the  
civilization and improvement oi the In  
dian tribes. The object, too, expressed,  
as that of the association, is one which I  
have ever had much at heart t and never  
omitted an occasion of promoting, while  
f have been in situations to do it with ef­  
fect. And nothing, even now, in tin  
calm of age and retirement, would excite  
in me a more lively interest than an ap  
provable plan of raising that respectable  
and unfortunate people from the slate of  
physical and moral abjection, to which  
they have been reaucea, circumstan-  
ces foreign to them.  
That the plan, now  
proposed, is entitled  
tO tinmiXed appro-  
bation,I am not prepared to say. After  
mature&#x27; consideration, and with all the  
partialities which its professed object  
would rightfully claim from me, 1 shall  
not undertake to draw the line of demar  
cation between private associations&#x27; of  
laudable views and unimposing numbers,  
and those whose magnitude may rivattze  
the march of regular Government.: Yet  
such a line does exist. . I have seen the  
days- they were those &#x27; which precedeci  
the revolution, when even this last and  
perilous engine became necessary. But  
they were days which no man would wish  
fcec u BCLuriu iune. j. nut. wasmecase,  
where the regular authorities of the Go  
vernment hadcombmed against the rights  
of the people, and no means of correction  
remainea 10 inem, om w organize a coiT  
lateral powert which, , with their support,  
might rescue and secure their violated  
rights. -i-&#x27;But such U not the case with  
our Government. lye need ; hazard no  
collateral power 9 which by a change of  
its original views t and assumption of o-  
titers we know not how virtuous or how  
mischievous , would be readily &#x27;organized  
and m j orce sufficient to shake the est ab  
iished foundations of societyv .and en  
danger its peace and the principles on  
which it is based. Is
