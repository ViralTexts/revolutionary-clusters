Three game cocks were brought back  
from Porto Rico by Admiral Sampson  
for his boys and placed at the Samp  
son home at Glen Ridge, N.J. They  
had records as fighters, and some care  
was taken to keep them from attack­  
ing and hurting a little American ban­  
tam which strutted around the place.  
These precautions falled, however, and  
the bantam killed two of the Spanish  
chickens one after the other, and the  
third roosted so high that it took the  
admiral&#x27;s glass to find him.
