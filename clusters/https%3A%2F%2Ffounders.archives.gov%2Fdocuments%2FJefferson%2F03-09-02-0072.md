son&#x27;s Works, vol. 0, pages 434-5).  
&quot;We are undone, my dear sir, if this  
banking mania be not suppressed, Aut  
Carthago aut Koma dolenda est. The  
war, had it proceeded, would have  
upset our government, and a new one,  
whenever tried, will do it. And so it  
must be while our money, the nerve  
of war, is much or little; real or im­  
aginary, as our bitterest enemies  
chose to make it. Put down the banks,  
and if this conntry could not be car­  
ried through the longest war against  
her most powerful enemy without  
ever knowing the want of a dollar,  
without dependence on the traitorous  
classes of her citizens, without bear­  
ing hard on the resources of the peo­  
ple, or loading the public with an in­  
definite burden of debt, I know noth­  
ing of my countrymen. Not by any  
novel project, not by any charlatanry,  
but by ordinary and well experienced  
mean&#x27;s; by the total prohibition of all  
private paper at all times, by reason­  
able taxes in war aided by the neces­  
sary emissions of public paper of cir­  
culating size, this bottomed on special  
tax redeemable annually &#x27;as this spec­  
ial tax comes in, and finally within a  
moderate period even with the flood  
of private paper by which we are  
deluged would the treasury have  
ventured its creoit in outs ot circulat­  
ing size of five or ten dollars, etc.,they  
would have been greedily received by  
the people in preference to bank pa­  
per. But unhappily the towns of  
America were considered as the na  
tion of America, the dispositions of  
tne inhabitants ot tne tormer as tnose  
of the latter, and the treasury, for  
want of confidence in the country, de­  
livered itself bound hand and foot to  
bold and bankrupt adventurers and  
pretenders to be money holders, whom  
it&#x27; could have crushed at any momont.  
Even last half bold, half timid threat  
of the treasury showed at once that  
these jugglers were at the feet of the  
government.

Jefferson, wrote to Gallatin as follows:  
We are undone, my dear sir, if this  
banking mania be not uppressed. The  
war, had it proceeded, would have upset  
our government; and a new one, when-  
ever tried, will do it. And so it must be  
while our money, the nerve of war, is  
much or littie, real or imaginary, as our  
bitterest enemies choose to make it. Tut  
&quot; &quot;&quot;. &quot; country coiuu  
not be carried through the longest war  
against her nwist powerful enemy without  
ever kuowiug tbe want of a dollar, with­  
out dciencling upon the traitorous dames  
of her citizens, without bearing hard on  
the resour-es of the people, loading the  
public with an indefinite burden of debt,
