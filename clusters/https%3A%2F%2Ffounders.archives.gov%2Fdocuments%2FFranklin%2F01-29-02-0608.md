Sir,  
[before June 28, 1779]  
Playing at Chess, is the most ancient and the most universal game known among men; for its original is beyond the memory of history, and it has, for numberless ages, been the amusement of all the civilized nations of Asia, the Persians, the Indians, and the Chinese. Europe has had it above 1000 years; the Spaniards have spread it over their part of America, and it begins lately to make its appearance in these northern states. It is so interesting in itself, as not to need the view of gain to induce engaging in it; and thence it is never played for money. Those, therefore, who have leisure for such diversions, cannot find one that is more innocent; and the following piece, written with a view to correct (among a few young friends) some little improprieties in the practice of it, shows at the same time, that it may, in its effects on the mind, be not merely innocent, but advantageous, to the vanquished as well as to the victor.  
The MORALS OF CHESS.  
The game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement. Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions. For life is a kind of chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effects of prudence or the want of it. By playing at chess, then, we may learn:  
1. Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action: for it is continually occurring to the player, “If I move this piece, what will be the advantages of my new situation? What use can my adversary make of it to annoy me? What other moves can I make to support it, and to defend myself from his attacks?  
2. Circumspection, which surveys the whole chess-board, or scene of action, the relations of the several pieces and situations, the dangers they are respectively exposed to, the several possibilities of their aiding each other; the probabilities that the adversary may make this or that move, and attack this or the other piece; and what different means can be used to avoid his stroke, or turn its consequences against him.  
3. Caution, not to make our moves too hastily. This habit is best acquired by observing strictly the laws of the game, such as, if you touch a piece, you must move it somewhere; if you set it down, you must let it stand. And it is therefore best that these rules should be observed, as the game thereby becomes more the image of human life, and particularly of war; in which, if you have incautiously put yourself into a bad and dangerous position, you cannot obtain your enemy’s leave to withdraw your troops, and place them more securely; but you must abide all the consequences of your rashness.  
  
And, lastly, we learn by chess the habit of not being discouraged by present bad appearences in the state of our affairs, the habit of hoping for a favourable change, and that of persevering in the search of resources. The game is so full of events, there is such a variety of turns in it, the fortune of it is so subject to sudden vicissitudes, and one so frequently, after long contemplation, discovers the means of extricating one’s self from a supposed insurmountable difficulty, that one is encouraged to continue the contest to the last, in hopes of victory by our own skill, or, at least, of giving a stale mate, by the negligence of our adversary. And whoever considers, what in chess he often sees instances of, that particular pieces of success are apt to produce presumption, and its consequent, inattention, by which more is afterwards lost than was gained by the preceding advantage; while misfortunes produce more care and attention, by which the loss may be recovered, will learn not to be too much discouraged by the present success of his adversary, nor to despair of final good fortune, upon every little check he receives in the pursuit of it.  
That we may, therefore, be induced more frequently to chuse this beneficial amusement, in preference to others which are not attended with the same advantages, every circumstance, that may increase the pleasure of it, should be regarded; and every action or word that is unfair, disrespectful, or that in any way may give uneasiness, should be avoided, as contrary to the immediate intention of both the players, which is to pass the time agreeably.  
Therefore, 1st. If it is agreed to play according to the strict rules, then those rules are to be exactly observed by both parties; and should not be insisted on for one side, while deviated from by the other: for this is not equitable.  
2. If it is agreed not to observe the rules exactly, but one party demands indulgencies, he should then be as willing to allow them to the other.  
3. No false move should ever be made to extricate yourself out of a difficulty, or to gain an advantage. There can be no pleasure in playing with a person once detected in such unfair practice.  
4. If your adversary is long in playing, you ought not to hurry him, or express any uneasiness at his delay. You should not sing, nor whistle, nor look at your watch, nor take up a book to read, nor make a tapping with your feet on the floor, or with your fingers on the table, nor do anything that may disturb his attention. For all these things displease. And they do not show your skill in playing, but your craftiness or your rudeness.  
5. You ought not to endeavour to amuse and deceive your adversary, by pretending to have made bad moves, and saying you have now lost the game, in order to make him secure and careless, and inattentive to your schemes; for this is fraud, and deceit, not skill in the game.  
6. You must not, when you have gained a victory, use any triumphing or insulting expression, nor show too much pleasure; but endeavour to console your adversary, and make him less dissatisfied with himself by every kind and civil expression, that may be used with truth, such as, You understand the game better than I, but you are a little inattentive; or, You play too fast; or, You had the best of the game but something happened to divert your thoughts, and that turned it in my favour.  
7. If you are a spectator, while others play, observe the most perfect silence. For if you give advice, you offend both parties; him, against whom you give it, because it may cause the loss of his game; him, in whose favour you give it, because, though it be good, and he follows it, he loses the pleasure he might have had, if you had permitted him to think till it occurred to himself. Even after a move or moves, you must not, by replacing the pieces, shew how it might have been played better: for that displeases, and may occasion disputes or doubts about their true situation. All talking to the players, lessens or diverts their attention, and is therefore unpleasing; nor should you give the least hint to either party, by any kind of noise or motion.— If you do, you are unworthy to be a spectator.— If you have a mind to exercise or show your judgments, do it in playing your own game when you have an opportunity, not in criticising or meddling with, or counselling, the play of others.  
Lastly. If the game is not to be played rigorously, according to the rules above mentioned, then moderate your desire of victory over your adversary, and be pleased with one over yourself. Snatch not eagerly at every advantage offered by his unskilfulness or inattention; but point out to him kindly that by such a move he places or leaves a piece in danger and unsupported; that by another he will put his king in a dangerous situation, &amp;c. By this generous civility (so opposite to the unfairness above forbidden) you may indeed happen to lose the game to your opponent, but you will win what is better, his esteem, his respect, and his affection; together with the silent approbation and good will of impartial spectators

the laws of the game, fuch as, /f  
youtouch 2, pieces you muft move it  
fomeswhere 3 if you fet it down, you  
mufi let,it fland. And it is there-  
fore belt that thefe rules fhould be  
obferved, as the game thereby be-  
comes more, the image of human  
life, and, particularly of war; in  
which, if you have incautioufly, put  
yourfelf into a, bad and dangerous  
pofition, you cannot obtain your  
enemy’s,.leave to withdraw your  
troops, aud place them more fecure-  
ly; but. you muft abide all the con-  
fequences of your rafhnefs.  
  
And, Jafily, we learn by chefs  
the habit of not being difcouraged by  
prefent bad appearances in the {late  
of our affairs, the habit of /oprng  
for a favorable change, and that of  
perfevering in the fearch of refourtes.  
The ame.is fo full of events, there  
isfach a variety of turns in it, the  
fortune of it is fo fubjeé&amp;t. to fudden  
viciflitudes, and one fo frequently,  
after long contemplation, difcovers  
  
means of extricating one’s felf  
from a fuppofed infurmountable  
difficulty, that one is encouraged  
to continue the conteft to the latt,  
in hopes of vitory by our own fkill,  
or, at leat, of giving a /fale mate,  
by the negligence of our adverfary.  
And whoever confiders, what in  
chefs he often fees inftances of, that  
Particular pieces of fuccefs are apt  
to produce prefumption, and its con-  
fequent, inattention, by which more  
is afterwards loft than was gained  
y the preceding advantage ;_ while  
misfortunes produce more care and  
attention, by which the lofs may  
be recovered, will learn not to be  
too much difcouraged by the pre-  
fent fuccefs of his adverfary, nor to  
defpair of final good fortune, upon  
every little check he receives in the  
purfuit of it.  
  
159  
  
That we may, therefore, be im-  
duced more frequently to chufe this  
beneficial amufement, in preference  
to others which are not attended  
with the fame advantages, / every  
circumftance, that may encreafe.the  
pleafure of it, fhould be regarded;  
and every action. or word that is  
unfair, difrefpe¢tful, or that in any  
way may give uneafinefs, fhould be  
avoided, as contrary to the imme-  
diate intention of both the players,  
which is, to pafs the time agreeably.  
  
Therefore 1/7. If it is agreed to  
play according to the flric rules,  
then thofe rules are to be exadly  
obferved by both parties; and  
fhould not be infifted on for one  
fide, while deviated from. by, the  
other: for this,is not equitable.  
  
2. If it is agreed not to obferve  
the rules exa@ly, but one party de-  
mands indulgencies, he fhould then  
be as willing to allow them te  
the other.  
  
3. No falfe move fhould ever be  
made to| extricate yourfelf out of a  
difficulty, or to gain an advantage.  
There can be no pleafure in playing  
with a perfon once deteéted in fuch  
unfair praétice.  
  
4. If ,your adverfary is long in  
playing, you ought not to hurry  
him, or exprefs any uneafinefs at  
his delay. You fhould not fing, nor  
whiftle, nor look at your watch,  
nor take up’a book to read, nor  
make a tapping with your feet on  
the floor, or with your fingers on  
the table, nor do any thing that  
may difturb his attention. For all  
thefe things difpleafe. And they  
do not fhow your {kill in playing,  
but your craftinefs or your rude-  
nefs.  
  
5. You ought not to endeavour  
to amufe and deceive your adverfa-  
ry, by pretending to have made  
bad moves, and faying you have pom  
  
a 2  
  
  
  
  
  
160  
  
loft the game, in order to make him  
fecure and carelefs, and inattentive  
to your fchemes ; for this is fraud,  
and deceit, not fkill in the game.  
  
6, You muft not, when you have  
gained a victory, ufe any triumph-  
ing or infulting expreffion, nor  
fhow too much pleafure; but en-  
deavour to confole your adverfary,  
and make him lefs diffatisfied with  
himfelf by every kind and civil ex-  
preffion, that may be ufed with  
truth ; fuch as, You underftand the  
game better than I, but you are a  
little inattentive ; or, You play too  
faft; or, You had the beft of the  
game, but fomething happened to  
divert your thoughts, and that  
turned it in my favour.  
  
7. If you are a fpectator, while  
others play, obferve the moft perfeé&amp;  
filence. For if yougiye advice, you  
offend both parties; him, againft  
whom you give it, begaufe it may  
caufe the lofs of his game; him, in  
whofe favour you give it, becaufe,  
tho’ it be good, and he folllows it,  
he lofes the pleafure he might have  
had, if you had permitted him to  
think till it occurred to himfelf.  
Even after a move or moves, you  
muft not, by replacing the pieces,  
fhow how it might have been played  
better : for that difpleafes, and may  
occafion difputes or doubts about  
  
  
  
On the Power of Sound.  
  
their true fituation. All talking to  
the players, leffens or diverts their  
attention, and is therefore unplea.  
fing ; nor fhould you give the leaf  
hint to either party, by any kind  
of noife or motion.—If you do, you  
are unworthy to be a fpeGator—  
If you have a mind to exercife or  
fhow your judgment, do it in play.  
ing your own game when you have  
an opportunity, not in criticifing  
or meddling with, or eounfelling,  
the play of others.  
  
Lattly. If the game is not to be  
played rigoroufly, according to the  
rules above mentioned, then mode.  
rate your defire of viétory over your  
adverfary, and be pleafed with one  
over yourfelf, Snatch not eagerly  
at every advantage offered by his  
unfkilfulnefs or inattention; but  
point out to him kindly that by  
fuch a move he places or leaves a  
piece in danger and unfupported ;  
that by another he will put his king  
in a dangerous fituation, &amp;c. By  
this generous civility (fo oppofite to  
the unfairnefs above forbidden) you  
may indeed happen to lofe the game  
to your opponent, but you will win  
what is better, his efteem, his re-  
fpe&amp;t, and his affection; together  
with the filent approbation and  
good will of impartial fpectators

The Morats of Cutss.  
By Dr, FRANKLIN.  
  
: i game of chefs is not mere-  
ly an idle amufement ; feveral  
very valuable qualities of the mind,  
ufeful in the courfe of human life,  
are to be acquired and {trengthened  
by it, fo as to become habits ready  
on all occafions: for life is a kind  
of chefs, in which we have often  
points to gain, and competitors or  
acverfaries to contend with, and in  
which there is a vaft variety of  
«ood and ill events that are, in fome  
degree, the efte&amp;t of prudence, or  
the want of it. By playing at  
chefs, then, we may learn,

make this or that move, and attack  
this or that piece; and what dif-  
ferent means can be uled to avoid  
his {troke, or turn it’s confequences  
againit him.  
  
gd. Caution, not to make our  
moves too haftily. This habit is  
beft acquired by obferving ftriétly  
the laws of the game; fuch as, if  
you touch a piece, you mult move  
it fomewhere; if you fet it down,  
you mutt let it ftand.  
  
Theretore, it would be the bet-  
ter way to obferve thefe rules, as  
the game becomes thereby more the  
image of human life, ard particu-  
jarly of war; in which, if you  
have incautioufly put yourfe!f into  
a bad and dangerous pofition, you  
cannot obtain your enemy’s leave  
to withdraw your troops, and place  
them more fecurely ; but you mutt  
abide all the confequences of your  
safhnefs. ;  
  
And laftly, we icarn by chefs  
the habit of not being dilfcouraged  
by prefent bad appearances in the  
ftate of our affairs, the habit of ho-  
ping for a favourable chance, and  
that of perievering in the fearch of  
relources, ‘The vame is fo full of  
events, there is fuch a variety of  
turns in #, thc fortune of it 1s fo  
fudden to vici tudes, and one fo  
frequently, atter contemplation,  
difcovers the means of extricating  
one’s felf from a fuppoled infur-  
mountable difficulty, that one is  
encouraged to continuc the conteft  
to the laft, in hopes of vidtory  
from our fkill; or, at lcaft, from  
the negligence of our adveriary.  
And whoever confiders, what ‘in  
chefs he often fees inftances of,  
that fuccefs is apt to produce pre-  
fumption and it’s confequent inat-  
tention, hy which more is after-  
wards loft than was gained by the  
preceding advantaze, while mif-  
iurtuses produce more care and at-  
tention, by which the lofs may be  
recovered, svill learn not to be too

much difcouraged by any prefent  
fucceffes of his adverfary, nor to  
defpair of final good fortune, upon  
every little check he receives in the  
puriuit of it.  
  
That we may, therefore, be in-  
duced more frequently to chufe  
this beneficial amufement in pre-  
ference to others, which are not  
attended with the fame advantages,  
every circumftance that may in-  
creale the pleafure of it fhould be  
regarded: and every ation or  
word that is unfair, difrefpeéful,  
or that in any way may give unca-  
finefs, fhould be avoided, as con-  
trary to the immediate intention of  
both the parties, which is to pafs  
the time agreeably,  
  
ift, Theréfore, 1f it is agreed to  
play according to the ftritt rules,  
then thofe rules are to be ftri@ly  
obferved by both parties; and  
fhould not be infifted upon for one  
fide, while deviated from by the  
other, for this is not equitable.  
  
2d. If it is agreed not to obferve  
the rules cxattly, but one party  
demands indulgencies, he fhould  
then be as willing to allow them to  
the other.  
  
gd. No falfe move fhould ever  
be made to extricate yourlelf out  
of a difficulty or to gain an advan-  
tage; for there can be no pleafure  
in playing with a man once detec-  
ted in fuch unfair pra@tice,  
  
4th. If your se is long  
in playing, you ought not to hurry  
him, or exprefs any uneafinefs at  
his delay ; not cven by looking at  
your watch, or taking up a book  
to read: you fhould not fing, nor  
whiflle, nor make a tapping with  
your feet on the floor, or with your  
fingers on the table, nor do any  
thing that may diftra&amp; his atten-

+ E game of Chefs is not merely  
an idle amufement; feveral va-  
luable qualities of the mind, ufeful in  
the courfe of human life, are to be ac-  
quired and ftrengthened by it, fo as to  
become. habits ready on all occafions :  
for life-is a kind of Chefs, in which  
.we have often points to gain, and  
  
competitors or adverfaries to contend  
with, and in which there is a vaft va-  
riety of, good and ill events that are,  
in fomedegree, the effeét of prudence,  
  
or of the want of it.  
chefs, then, we may learn,  
  
ift. Forefight, which looks a little  
into futurity, and confiders the con-  
fequence that may attend an action ;  
  
for it is continually occurring’ to the -  
  
player, ‘* If I move this piece, what  
will be the advantage or difadvantage  
of my new fituation? What ufe-can  
my adverfary make of it, to annoy  
. me?—What other moves can I make  
to fupport it, and to defead mylelf  
- from his attacks ?”’  
2d.. Circumipeétion, which furveys  
the whole chefs-board, or fcene of ac-  
tion ; the relation of the feveral pieces,  
and their fituations ; the dangers they  
are repeatedly expofed to; the feveral  
poffibilities of their aiding each other ;  
the probabilities that the adverfary  
may make this or that move, and  
attack this or that piece; and what  
different means can be ufed to avoid  
- the ftroke, or turn its eonfequences

too haftily. ‘This habit is beft agquired  
by obferving ftrictly the laws of the  
game; fuch as, if Pag touch a piece,  
you muft move it fomewhere; if you  
fet it down, you mutt let it ftand.  
  
Therefore, it would be the better  
way to obferve thefe rules, as the game  
becomes thereby more the image of  
human life, and particularly of war ;  
in which, if you have incautioufly pat  
yourfelf into a bad&#x27;and dangerous po-  
fition, you cannot obtain leave of your  
enemies to withdraw your troops, and  
place them more fecurely; but you  
mutt abide all the confequences of your  
rafhnefs,  
  
And, laftly, we learn by chefs the  
habit of not being difcouraged by pre-  
fent bad appearances in the fate of  
our affairs ;. the habit of hoping for a  
favourable chance, and that of per-  
fevering in the fearch of refources.  
The game is fo full of events, there is  
fuch a varicty of turns in it, the for-  
tune of it is fo fudden to viciffitudes,  
and one fo frequently, after contem-  
plation, difcovers the means of extri-  
cating one’s felf from a fuppofed ip-  
furmountable difficulty, that one is  
encouraged to continue the conteft to  
the lait, in hopes of victory from our  
fkill; or, at leaft, from the negligence  
of our adverfary. And whoever con-  
fiders, what in chefs he often fees in-  
ftances of, that fuccefs is apt to pro-  
duce prefumption and its. confequent

inattention, by which more is after-  
wards loft than was gained by&#x27;the pre-  
etding advantage, while misfortunes  
  
uce more care and attention, by  
which the lofs may be recovered, will  
Jearn not to be too much difcouraged  
dy any prefent fuccefles of his adver-  
fary, nor to defpair of final good for-  
tune, upon every-little check he re-  
ceives in the purfuit of it.  
  
That we may, therefore, be in-  
duced more frequently to chufe this  
beneficial amufement in preference to  
others, which are not attended with  
the fame advantages, every circum-  
ftance that may increafe the pleafure  
of it fhould be regarded ; and every ac-  
tion or word that is unfair, difreipect-  
ful, or that in any way may-give un-  
eafinefs, fhould be avoided, as “con-  
trary to the immediate intention of  
both the parties, which is to pafs the  
  
‘ime agreeably :  
  
1. Therefore, if itis agreed to play  
‘according to the ftrict rules, then thoie  
rules are to be ftriétly obferved by both  
patties; and fhould not be infitted  
upon for‘one fide, whiledeviated from  
by the other, for this is not equitable.  
  
z. If it isagreed not to oblerve the  
  
“rules exa&amp;tly, but one party demands  
iudulgences, he fhould then be as will-  
ing to allow them to the other.  
  
3- No falfe-move fhould even be  
made to extricate yourfelf out of a dif-  
ficulty, or to gain an advantage ; for  
  
there can be&#x27;no pleafure in playing  
with a man once deteéted in fuch un-  
fair praGice.  
  
4. If your adverfary is long in  
playing, you oughtnot to hurry him, or  
exprefs any uneafinefs at his delay ;  
mot even by looking at your watch,  
er taking up a book to read: you  
fhould not fing, nor whiitle, nor make  
a tapping with your feet on the floor,

do any thing that may diftract his at-  
tention ; for all thefe things difpleafe,  
end they do not prove your skill in  
playing, but your craftinefs, and your  
rudeneis.

The MORALS of CHESS.  
  
By the late Dr. Bixjamin FRanxuiy.  
  
HE game of Chefs is not mere-  
  
ly an idle amufement ; feveral  
  
very valuable qualities of the mind,  
uleful in the courfe of human life,  
are to be acquired and flrengthened  
by it, fo as to become habits ready  
on all occafions; for life isa kind of  
Chefs, in which we have often points  
to gain, and competitors or adverfa-  
ries to contend with, and in which  
there is a vaft variety of good and ill  
events that are, in fome degree, the  
effect of prudence, or of the want  
  
of it. By playing at Chefs, then,  
  
we may learn,  
  
tit. Forefight, which looksa little  
into futurity, and confiders the con-  
fequence that may attend an aétion;  
for it is continually occurring to the  
player, * If I move this piece, what  
will be the advantage or difadvantage  
of my new fituation? what ufe can  
my adverfary make of it to annoy  
  
me? what other moves can I make

Therefore, it would be the better  
way to obferve thefe rules, as the  
game becomes thereby more net eee  
ace of human life, and particularly  
of war; in which, if you have in-  
cautioufly put yourielf intoa bad and  
dangerous pofition, you cannot Ob-  
tain your enemies’ leave to withdraw  
your troops, and place them more  
fecurely ; but you muit abide all the  
confequences of your rajhnels. f  
  
And, laitly, we leatn by Chefs  
the habit of not being difcouraged by  
prefent bad appearances in the itave  
of our affairs; the habit of hoping  
fora favourable chance, and that of  
perfevering in the fearch of reiources.  
‘The game is fo full of events, there  
is fuch a variety of turns in it, the  
fortune of it is fo fudden to vicifli-  
tudes, and one fo frequently, after  
contemplation, diicovers the means  
of extricating one’s-lelf from a iup-  
pofed infurmountable diliiculty, that  
one is encouraged to continue the  
conteft tothe lait, in hopes of victory  
from our fkill; or, at leat, from the  
negligence of our adveriary, And  
whoever confiders, what in Cheis he  
often fees initances of, that fuccefs  
isapt to produce prefumption and its  
confequent inattention, by whic!  
more is afterwards loit than was gain-  
ed by the preceding advantage, while  
  
usiortunes produce more care and  
attention, by which the lofs may be  
recovered, will learn not to be too  
much difcouraged by any prefent  
luccefles of his adverfary, nor to  
defpair of final good-fortune, upon  
every little check he receives in the  
purtuit of it.  
  
That we may, therefore, be in-  
éuced more frequently to chuie this  
beneficial amufement in oreference  
to others, which are not attended  
with the lame ad Vantages, every cir-  
camitance that may ~ increafé the  
Pitalure of it fhould be regarded ;  
and every action or word that is un-  
tai, difrefpectful, or that in any  
  
of Chefs. 267  
  
way may give uneafinefs, fhould be  
avoided, as contrary to the immedi-  
ate intention of both the parties,  
which is to pafs the time agreeably :  
  
ift. Therefore, if it is agreed to  
play according to the itrict rules, then  
thofe rules are to be ftriftly obferv-  
ed by both parties; and fhould not  
be infitted upon for one fide, while  
deviated from by the other, for this  
is not equitable.  
  
2d.‘If it is agreed not to obfetve  
the rules exaétly, but one party de-  
mands indulgences, he fhould then  
be as willing to allow them to the  
other.  
  
3d. No falfe move fhould even be  
made to extricate yourfelf out of a  
difficulty or to gain an advantage ;  
for there can be no pleafure in play-  
ing witha man once detected in {uch  
untair practice.  
  
4th. If your adverfary is long in  
playing, you ought not to hurry him,  
or expreis any uneafinefs at his de-  
lay; not even by looking at your  
watch, or taking up a book to read;  
you fhould not fing, nor whiflle, nor  
make a tapping wiih your feet on the  
floor, or with your fingers on the  
table, nor do any thing that may  
diftraét his attention; for. all thele  
things difpleafe, and they do not  
prove your fkillin playing, but your  
craftinefs, and your radenedfs.  
  
sth. You ought not to endeavour  
to amufe and deceive your adverfary,  
by pretending to have made bad  
moves; and iaying you have now  
loit the game, in order to make him  
fecure and carelefs, and inattentive  
to your fchemes; for this is fraud  
and deceit, not skill in the game of  
Chefs.  
  
6th. You muft not, when you  
have gained a victory, ufe any tri-  
umphing or infulting expreflions, ner  
ew too much of the pleafure you  
el; but endeavour to confole your  
verfary, and make him lets diffa-  
tished with himfelf by every kind.

HE game of Chefs is not  
merely an idle amufement ;  
feveral very valuable qualities of  
the mind, ufeful in the courle of  
human life, are to be acquired and  
ftrengthened by it, fo as to be-

for life is a kmd of Chefs in  
which we have often points to

there is a vaft variety of good and  
Hl events that are, in fome degree,  
the effeét: of prudence, or of the  
want of it. By playing at Chefs,  
then, we may fearn,  
ift. Forefight, which looks a  
little into futurity, and confiders  
the confequences that may attend  
an aétion ; for it is continually  
Occurring to the player, «If [  
move this piece, what will be the  
advantage or difadvantage of my  
new fituation ? what ule can my  
adverfary make of it to annoy me ?  
what other moves can I make to  
{upport it and to defend myfelf

ed. Circumfpeftion, which fur-

more is afterwards loft than was

LAYING at chefs, is the mo ancient and the moft univerfal came known  
among men ; for its original is beyond the memory of hiitory, and it has,  
for numberlefs ages, been the amufement of ali the civilized nations of Afia,  
the Perfians, the Indians, anu the Chinefe. Europe has had it above 1000 years 5  
the Spaniards have fpread it over their part of America; and it begins lately to  
make its appearance in thele ftates. It is fo mterefting in itfelf, as not to need  
the view of gain to induce engaging in it; and thence it is never played for mo=  
ney. Thole, therefore, who have leilure for fuch diverfions, cannot find one that  
is more innocent; and the following piece, written with a view to correct  
(among a few young fricnis) fome little impropricties in the praftice of it,  
fhows, at the Jame time, that it may, in its effects on the mind, be not meiely  
innecent, but advantageous, to the vanquifhed as weil as the vitor.  
  
THE game of chefs is not merely an idle amufement. Several very valua-  
ble qualities of the mind, ufeful in the courfe of human life, are to be acquired  
or ftrengthened by it, fo as to become habits, ready on all occafions. For lifeis  
a kind of chefs, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or ad-  
verfaries to contend with, and in which there is a vait variety of good and ill  
events, that are in fome degree the effeéts of prudence er the want of it. By  
playing at chefs, then, we may learn:  
  
1. Forefight, which looks a little into futurity, and confiders the confequences  
that may attefid an action: for it is continually occurring to the player, “* if E  
move this piece, what will be the advantages of my new fituation? What ufe  
can my adverfary make of it to annoy me? What ciher moves can I make to  
fupport it, and to defend myflf from his attacks 7”

144 The morals of chefs. [Aprily  
  
ly expofed to, the feveral poffibilities of their aiding each other; the probabili-  
ties that the adverfary may take this or that move, and attack this or the other  
piece ; and what different means can be ufed to avoid his ftroke, or turn its con-  
fequences again{t him.  
  
3- Caution, not to make our moves too haftily. This habit is beft acquired by  
obferving ftriétly the laws of the game, fuch as, if you touch a piece, you  
mutt move it fomewhere; if you fet it down, you muft let it ftand.”” And it is  
therefore beft that thele rules thould be obferved, as the game thereby becomes  
more the image of human life, and particularly of war; in which, if you have  
incautioufly put yourfelf into a bad and dangerous pofition, you cannot obtain  
your enemy&#x27;s leave to withdraw your troops, and place them more fecurely ;  
but you muft abide all the coniequences of your rafhnefs.  
  
And, laftly, we learn by cheis the habit of not being difcouraged by prefent  
bad appearances in the ftate of our affairs, the habit of hoping for a favourable  
change, and that of perfevering in the fearch of refources. The game is fo full of  
events, there is fuch a varicty of turns in it, the fortune of it is fo fubje&amp; to  
fudden vicifliuudes, and one fo frequently, after long contemplation, difcovers  
the ineans of extricating one’s felf, trom a fuppofed infurmountable difficulty,  
that one is encouraged to continue the conteft to the laft, in hopes of viétory by  
our own {kill, or, at leaft of giving a flale mate, by the negligence of our ad-  
verfary. And whoever confidersy what in chefs he often fees inftances of, that  
particular pieces of fucceis are apt to produce prefumption, and its confequent  
inattention, by which more is afterwards loft than was gained by the preceding  
advantage; while misfortunes produce more care and attention, by which the  
Jofs may be recovered, will learn not to be too much difcouraged by the prefent  
fuccels of his adverfary, nor to deipair of final good fortune, upon every little  
check he receives in the purfuit of it.  
  
That we may, therefore be induced more frequently to choofe this beneficial a-  
mufement, 10 prefe: ence to others which are not attended with the fame advantages,  
every ciicuniftance, that may increafe the pieafure of it, fhould be regarded;  
and every action or word that 1s untair, difrefpe&amp;ful, or that in any way may  
give uneafinefs, fhould be avoided, as contrary to the immediate intention of  
both the players, which is to pafs the time agreeably.  
  
Therefore, sft. If itis agreed to play according to the ftri&amp;t rules, then  
thofe rules are to be exactly obferved by both parties; and fhould not be  
infifted on for one fide, while deviated from by the other: for this is not equi-  
table.  
  
2. If it is agreed not to obferve the rules exa&amp;tly, but one party demands in-  
dulgencies, he fhould then be as willing to aliow them to the other.  
  
3. No falfe move fhould ever be made, to extricate yourfelf out of a difficulty,  
or to gain an advantage. There can be no picafure in playing with a perfon once  
deteSted in fuch unfair practice.  
  
4. If your adverfary is long in playing, you ought not to hurry him,  
or expre(s any uneafinefs at his delay. You fhould not fing, nor whif-  
tle, nor lock at your watch, nor take up a book to read, nor make a tapping  
with your feet on the floor, or with your fingers on the table, nor do any  
thing that may diturb his attention. For all thefe things difplea’e. And  
they do not fhow your {kill in playing, but your craftinefs or your rude-  
nefs.  
  
5. You ought not to endeavour to amufeand deceive your adverfary, by pre-  
tending to have made bad moves, and faying you have now loft the game, in or-  
der to make him fecure and carelefs, and inattentive to your tchemes; for this  
is fraud and decci*, not (kill in the game.

infulting expreffion, nor fhow too much pleafure ; but endeavour to cenfole your  
adverfary, and make him lefs diffatisfied with himfelf by every kind of civil ex-  
preffion, that may be ufed with truth, {uch as, ‘* you underftand the game bet-  
ter than I, but you are a Iutle inattentive; or, ‘ you pizy too talt;” or,  
** you had the beft of the game but fomething happened to divert your thoughts,  
and that turned it in my favour.”  
  
7. If you area {peétator, while others play, obferve the moft perfe&amp; filence.  
For if you give advice, you offend both parties; him, againft whom you give  
it, becaufe it may caufe the lofs of his game; him, in whofe favour you give  
it, becaufe, though it be good, and he follows it, he lofes the pleafure he might  
have had, if you had permitted him to think till it occurved to bimfelf. Even af-  
ter a move or moves, you mutt not, by replacing the pieces, fhow how it might  
have been placed better : for that difpleafes, and may occafion dilputes or doubts  
about their trus fitdation. All talking to the players, leflens or divets their at-  
tention, and is therefore unpleafing; nor fhould you give the leat hint to,ecither  
party, by any kind of noife or motion.—If you do, you are unworthy to be a  
fpeétator.—If you have a mind to exercife or fhow your judgment, do it in play-  
ing your own game when you have an opportunity, not in criticifing or med-  
dling with, or counfelling the play of others.  
  
Laftly. If the game is not to be played rigoroufly, according tothe rules above  
mentioned, then moderate your defire of victory over your adverfary, and be  
pleafed with one over yourfelf. Snatch not eagerly at eyery advantage offered by  
his unfkilfulnels or inattention; but point out to him kindly, that by fuch a  
move he places or Jeaves a piece in danger and uniupported; that by another he  
will put his king in a dangerous fituation, &amp;c, By this generous civijity (fo op-  
polite to the unfairnefs above forbidden) you may indeed happen to lofe the  
game to your opponent, but you will win what is better, his efteem, his re-  
fpe&amp;, and his affection; together with the filsnt approbation and good will of  
impartial {pectators

above a thouſand years ; the Spaniards have ſpread

to make its appearance in theſe ſtates, It is ſo in-

to induce engaging in it; and thence it is never

there is a vaſt variety of good and ill events, that

THE MORALS or CHESS. 19  
  
 #_  
MORALS OF CHESS,  
BY DR. FRANKLIN,  
  
Tux game of cheſs is not merely an idle  
amuſement. Several very valuable qualities  
  
  
life, are to be acquired or ſtrengthened by it,  
ſo as to become habits, ready on all occaſions,  
For life is a kind of cheſs, in which we have  
often points to gain, and competitors or ad-  
verſaries to contend with, and in which there  
is a vaſt variety of good and ill events, that  
are, in ſome degree, the effects of prudence  
or the want of it. By playing at cheſs, then,  
we may learn, |  
  
I. Fore/ight, which looks a little into futu-  
  
  
attend an action: for it is continually occur-  
ring to the player, If I move this piece,  
what will be the advantage of my new ſitu-  
ation? What uſe can my adverſary make of  
it to annoy me? What other moves can I  
make to ſupport it, and to defend myſelf  
from his attacks?  
  
IT. Cir-  
  
20 THE MORALS OF CHESS,  
  
II. Circumſpe#ion, which ſurveys the whole  
cheſs-board, or ſcene of action, the relations  
of the ſeveral pieces, and ſituations, the  
dangers they are reſpectively expoſed to,  
the ſeveral poſſibilities of their aiding each  
other, the probabilities that the adverſary  
may take this or that move, and attack this  
or the other piece, and what different means  
can be uſed to avoid his ſtroke, or turn its  
Nur bee againſt him. *  
  
III. Caution, not to make our moves too  
haſtily. This habit is beſt acquired by ob-  
ſerving ſtrictly the laws of the game, ſuch as,  
If you touch a piece, you muſt move it  
ſome where; if you ſet it down, you muſt let  
it ſtand:“ and it is therefore heſt that theſe  
rules ſhould be obſerved, as the game there-  
by becomes more the image of hnman life,  
and particularly of war; in which, if you  
have incautiouſly put yourſelf into a bad and  
dangerous poſition, you cannot obtain your  
enemy&#x27;s leave to withdraw your troops, and  
place them more ſecurely, but you muſt abide  
all the conſequences of your raſhneſs.  
  
And laſtly, we learn by cheſs the habit of  
not being diſcouraged by preſent bad appear-  
ances in the flate of our, affairs, the habit of  
Hoping for a favourable change, and that of  
  
per-  
  
THE MORALS OF CHESS. 21.  
  
perſevering in the ſearch of reſources. The  
game is ſo full of events, there is ſuch a  
variety of turns in it, the fortune of it is ſo  
ſubject to ſudden viciſſitudes, and one ſo  
frequently, after long contemplation, diſ-  
covers the means of extricating oneſelf from  
a ſuppoſed inſurmountable difficulty, that one  
is encouraged to continue the conteſt to the  
laſt, in hopes of victory by our own ſkill, or  
at leaſt of giving a ſtale mate, by the negli-  
gence of our adverſary. And whoever con-  
  
  
of, that particular pieces of ſucceſs are apt  
to produce preſumption, and its conſequent  
  
  
covered, will learn not to be too much diſ.  
couraged by the preſent ſucceſs of his adver-  
ſary, nor to deſpair of final good fortune,  
upon every little check he receives in the  
  
  
That we may, thereſore, be induced more  
frequently to chooſe this beneficial amuſe-  
ment, in preference to others, which are not  
attended with the ſame advantages, every  
circumſtance which may increaſe the plea-  
ſures of it ſhould be regarded; and every  
action or word that is unfair, diſreſpectful,  
or that in any way may give uneaſineſs,  
  
ſhould  
  
22 THE MORALS OF CHESs.  
  
ſhould be avoided, as contrary to the imme-  
diate intention of both the players, which is,  
to paſs the time agreeably.  
  
Therefore, firſt, If it is agreed to play  
according to the ſtrict rules; then thoſe rules  
  
  
and ſhould not be inſiſted on for one fide,  
while deviated from by the other—for this  
is not equitable.  
  
Secondly, If it is agreed not to obſerve  
the rules exactly, but one party demands  
indulgencies, he ſhould then be as willing  
to allow them to the other.  
  
Thirdly, No falſe move ſhould ever be  
made to extricate yourſelf out of a difficulty,  
or to gain an advantage. There can be no  
pleaſure in playing with a perſon once de-  
tected in ſuch unfair practices.  
  
Fourthly, If your adverſary is &quot;ou in  
playing, you ought not to hurry him, or ex-  
preſs any uneaſineſs at his delay. You ſhould  
not ſing, nor whiſtle, nor look at your watch,  
nor take up a book to read, nor make a  
tapping with your feet on the floor, or with  
your fingers on the table, nor do any thing  
that may diſturb his attention. For all theſe  
things — and they do not ſhew your  
  
{kill  
  
THE MORALS OF CHESS. 23  
  
Kill in playing, but your craftineſs or your  
rudeneſs.  
  
Fifthly, You - ought not to endeavour to  
amuſe and deceive your adverſary, by pre-  
tending to have made bad moves, and ſay-  
ing that you have now loſt the game, in  
order to make him ſecure and careleſs, and  
inattentive to your ſchemes: for this is fraud  
and deceit, not ſkill in the game.  
  
Sixthly, You muſt not, when you have  
gained a victory, uſe any triumphing or in-  
fulting expreſſion, nor ſhow too much plea-  
fure; but endeavour to conſole your adver-  
fary, and make him leſs diſſatisfied with him-  
ſelf, by every kind of civil expreſſion that  
may be uſed with truth, ſuch as, © You  
underſtand the game better than I, but you  
are a little inattentive;F or, © You had the  
beſt of the game, but ſomething happened  
to divert your thoughts, and that turned it  
in my favour.”  
  
Seventhly, If you are a ſpectator while  
others play, obſerve the moſt perfect ſilence.  
For if you give advice you offend both parties;  
him againſt whom you give it, becauſe it  
may cauſe the loſs of his game; him in whoſe  
favour you give it, becauſe, though it be good,  
and he follows it, he loſes the pleaſure he

to be too much difcouraged by any prefent fucceffes of his ad.  
verfary, nor to defpair of final good fortuns, upon every little

That we may, therefore, be induced more frequently ‘to

muinediate intention of both the parties, which is to pafs the  
time agreeably :  
ift. Therefore, if it is agreed to play according to the firi&amp;  
rules, then thofe rules are to be ftnétly obferved by both par-

ated from by the other, for this isnot equitable. :

Jow them to the other. uF

CHESS.  
  
Th« Game of Chen it not neraly an idle amote-  
neot: Mveral very valuable qualities of the mind,  
useful in the course of hamau life, are to be acquired  
and sfrenghtened by it, so as to b^Mne habits ready  
for all occasions ; life is a kind of Chess, in which I  
we hare often points to fain, and competitors to coo*  
lend with, and in which there is a vast variety of food  
and ill events, that are, in some defree, the elle^s of  
prudence, or the want of it.—&gt;By playinf Chess, then,  
we may learn  
  
Jst. Foresifht, whidi looks a little into futurity,  
and considers the consequences that may attend an  
action; fir it is continu^ly occurrinf to the player,  
^ If I move this piece, what will be the advantafe or  
disadvantage of my new situation ? what use can my  
adversary make of it to annoy me f what other move  
CAD I make to support it, and to defend myself from  
his attacks  
  
2 d. Circumspection, which surveys the whole of  
the Chess&gt;board, or scene of actionthe relation of  
the several pieces, and their situations ; the daofew  
they are repeatedly exposed to, and the several possi¬  
bilities of their atdinf each other.  
  
3d. Caution, not to make our moves loo hastily.  
This habit is best acquired by observinf strictly the  
Jaws of the fame ; such as, if you touch a piece, you  
must more it somewhere ; if you set it down, you  
must let it stand.—Therefore, it would be better to  
observe these rules, as the fame becomes thereby  
more the itnafe of human life, and particularly of  
&#x27;^ar : in which if vou have incautiously put vourscif  
  
fori  
  
  
  
into a bad and dangerous position, you cannot obtain  
your enemy&#x27;s leave to withdraw your troops, and place  
them more securely, but you must abide all the con¬  
sequences of your rashness.  
  
And, lastly, we learn from Chess the habit of not  
heioff discouraged by present bad appearances in the  
state of our affairs ; the habit of hoping fora favorable  
chance, and that of perseverinf in the search of re¬  
sources. The fame is so full of events, there is snch  
a variety of turns in it, the fortune of it is so subject  
to vicissitudes, and one so frequently, after contem¬  
plation, discovers tlic means of extricating one&#x27;s self  
iiom a supposed insurmountable ditTiciilty, that one is  
encouraged to continue the contest to the last, in  
hopes of victory from skill; or at least from the negli¬  
gence of our adversary.

Praiss or Cuxss.—We learn by chess the habit of not being discouraged by present  
bad appearances in the state of our affairs, the habit of hoping for a favourable change,  
and that of persevering in the search of resources. The game is so full of events, there  
is such a variety of turns in it, the fortune of it is so subject to sudden vicissitudes, and  
one 80 hequstl , after long contemplation, discovers the means of extricating one’s  
self from a supposed insurmountable difficulty, that one is encouraged to continue the  
contest to the last, in hope of victory by our own skill, or at least of giving a stale mate  
by the negligence of our adversary ; and whoever considers, what in chess he often  
sees instances of, that particular pieces of success are apt to produce presumption and  
its consequent inattention, by which the loss may be recovered, will learn not to be  
much discouraged by the present success of his adversary, nor to despair of final good  
fortune upon every little check he receives in the pursuit of it.—Franklin’s Life, by

the secret, that none, as yet, have  
found out. It may be reserved for  
.«!omc one of our citizens, to make  
the disclosure. The game itself is  
an interesting one; for ‘Life itself is  
but a kind of Chess, in which we  
have often points to gain, and com¬  
petitors or adversaries to contend  
with, ami in which there is a vast  
variety of good and ill events, that  
are, in some degree, the efl&#x27;ects of  
prudence, or the w ant of it.’ Play¬  
ing at Ciiess, savs Dr. Franklin, ‘is  
the most antient and most universal  
game among men; for its original is  
beyond the memory of history, and  
  
it has,for numberless agc=, hem ‘ho  
amusement of ali the civiii/ed na¬  
tions of Asia, the Persians, and the  
Chinese. Europe has had it above  
a thousand years; the Spaniards  
have spread it over their part of  
America, and it is not unknown in  
the United States. It is so inter¬  
esting in itself, as not to need the  
view of gain to induce any one to  
engage in it; and hence it is never  
played for money. They, therefore,  
who have leisure for such diversions,  
cannot find one that is more inno¬  
cent, and in its effects on the mind,  
more advantageous, both to the van¬  
quished as well as the victor.

that is more innocent ;  
and the fi piece, written with a view to correct  
(among a few young friends) some little im ieties in the  
ractice of it, shows, at the same time, that it may, in its ef.  
jects on the mind, be not merely innocent, but ous  
tothe vanquished as well as the victor.  
  
The of chess is not merely an idle amusement. Se-  
veral very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course  
of human life, are to be acquired or « i by it, so as  
~ hneeste hapiie-senyreniehenantionss fe pine a kind  
  
chess, in which we have points to gain, and competitors or  
adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast  
variety of good and ill events, that are, in sume degree, the  
effects of prudence or the want of it. By playing at chess  
then, we learn, fess } .  
  
I. Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, considers  
the consequences that may attend an action : for it is conti-  
nually occurring to the player, ‘IfI move this what  
will be the advantage of my new situation? W hat use cen  
my adversary make te annoy me? Whatother moves  
can I make to s t al to defend myself from his

IT. Ci i which surveys the whole chess-board,  
or scene of action, the vena of the steered po and ~  
tuations, the dangers they are respectiv to, t  
several possibilities of thelr aiding each other, the probabili-  
ties that the adversary may make this or that move, and at-  
tack this or the other piece, and what different means can be  
used to avoid his stroke, or turn its inst him.  
  
III. Caution, not to make our moves too hasty. This  
habit is best acquired by observing strictly the laws of the  
game, such as, ‘If you touch a piece, you must move it  
somewhere ; if oat de a. you must let it stand ; and  
it is therefore that these rules should be observed ;  
as the game more becomes the image of human life, and par-  
ticularly of war; in which, if you have incautiously put  
yourself into a bad and dangerous position, you cannot ob-  
tain your enemy’s leave to re troops, and place  
them more securely, but you must all the consequences  
of your rashness. : .  
  
And, lastly, we learn by chess the habit of not being dis-  
couraged by present bad &#x27;s in the state of owr affairs,  
the habit of hoping for © ‘avorable change, and that of perse~  
vering in the search of resources. The game is sofull of events,

give it, because, though it be good, and he follows it, he loses  
the pleasure he might have had, if you hed permitted him to  
think until it had occurred to himself. Even after a move, or  
moves, you must not, by replacing the pieces, show how it  
might have been placed better ; for that displeases, and —

“Secondly. Cireumspection, which surveys the whole  
board or scene of action—the relations of the several  
pieces and situations—the dangers they are perpetually  
exposed to—the several possibilities of their aiding each  
other—the probabilities that the adversary may take this  
or that move, and attack this or the other piece ; and  
what different means can be used to avoid the stroke, or  
turn its consequences against him.  
  
“ Thirdly. Caution—not to make our moves too hasti-  
lv; this habit is best acquired by observing strictly the  
laws of the game, such as, ‘If you touch a piece you  
must move it some where ; if you set it down you must  
let it stand, and it is therefore best that these rules  
should be observed ; as the game thereby becomes more  
the image of human life, and particularly of war: and  
which, if you have incautiously put yourself into a bad  
and dangerous position, you cannot obtain your enemy’s  
leave to withdraw your troops and place them more  
securely, but must abide all the consequences of your  
rashness,  
  
“« And, lastly, we learn by chess the habit of not being  
discouraged by present bad appearances in the state of  
our affairs: the habit of hoping for a favourable change,  
and that of persevering in the search of resources.”

whose work entitled “ Ta; Mjrals of  
Chess,” to Hams &#x27;-he folio .vi .g passages  
to the pomt:  
“ Tae gam? of Chess is not merely an  
amusement; several very valuable qual­  
ities of the mini, useful in me coarse of  
human life, are to be acquired by it, so  
as to become habits ready on ail occasions,  
for life is a kind of Chess, in which we  
have often points to gam. and competitors  
or adversaries to contend with, in which  
there is a vast variety of gsod and ill  
events that are, in some degree, the elfeci  
of prudence, or of the want of it. By  
playing at Chess, then, we may learn,  
“ First.—Foresight, which looks a lit­  
tle into futurity, and considers the conse­  
quence that mly alien 1 the action; for  
u is continually occurring to the player.  
If 1 move tins piece what will be the ad­  
vantage or disadvantage of my new sit­  
uation ? what use can my adversary make  
of it to at uoy me ? what other moves can  
i make to support it. and to defend my­  
, seif front-, lus attacks I  
  
“ Secosd.—Circumspection, which sur­  
veys the whole Chess hoard, or scene of 1  
action ; the relations of the several pie­  
ces, and their situations, the dangers tb-y   
are repeatedly exposed to, the several i  
possibilities of their aiding each other,&#x27;,  
i tUe probabilities that the adversary may  
make this or that move, and attack this!  
or that piece, an i what different means  
can be used to avoid his stroke, or turn  
us consequences against him.  
“Thiko.—Caution, not to &#x27;make our  
I moves too hastily. This habit Is Lest  
  
acquired by observing strictly the laws of  
the game; such as, if you touch a piece  
you must move it somewhere; if you set  
it down you must let it stand.  
“ Therefore, never deviate from strict  
play ; as the game becomes thereby more  
the image of human life, and particularly  
of war. in which, if you have incautiously  
put yourself in a Lad and dangerous po­  
sition, you cannot obtain your enemy&#x27;s  
leave to withdraw your troops and place  
’.hem more securely, but you must abide  
all the consequences of your rashness.  
“ And Lastly, we learn by Chess the  
habit of not being discouraged by psesent  
bad appearances of our affairs ; the hab­  
it of hoping for a favorable chance, and  
that of persevering in the search of re­  
sources. The game is so full of events,  
there is such a variety of turns in it, the  
fonune of it is so sudden to vicissitudes.  
  
and one so frequently, after contempla­  
tion, discovers the means of extricating  
ones self from a supposed insurmountable  
difficulty, that one is encouraged to cou­  
tiuue the contest to the last, in hopes of  
victory from our skill; or, at least, from  
the negligence of our anversary. And  
whoever considers, what in Chess he sees  
instances of, that success is apt to produce  
presumption and its consequent inatten­  
tion, by which more is afterwards lost  
than was gained by the preceding advan­  
tage, while misfortunes produce more  
care and attention, by which the loss may  
be recovered, will learn not to be discour­  
aged by any present successes of hi? ad­  
versary, nor to despair of final good for­  
tune, in every little check he receives in  
the pursuit of it.&#x27;

THE MORALS OF CHESS. -BY DB. FRANKLIN.  
THE game of Chess is not merely an idle  
amusement ; several very valuable  
qualities of the mind, useful in the  
course of human Ufe, are to be acquired  
and strengthened by it, so as to become  
habits ready on all occasions ; for life  
is a kind of Chess, in, which we have  
often points to gain, and competitors or  
adversaries to contend with, and in  
which there is a vast variety of good  
and ill events that are, in some degree,  
the effect of prudence or the want of  
it, By playing at Chess, then, we may  
learn, 1st, Foresight, which looks a  
little into futurity, and considers the  
consequence that may attend an action ;  
for it is continually occurring to the  
player, &quot; If I move this piece, what  
will bo tho advantage or disadvantage of  
my new situation? What use can my  
adversary make of it to annoy me ? What  
other moves can I make to support it and  
to defend myself from his attacks ?&quot;  
2nd, Circumspection, which surveys the  
whole Chess hoard or scene of action  
:-the relation of the several pieces,  
and their situations : the dangers they  
aro repeatedly oxposed to, the several  
possibilities of their aiding each  
other, the probabilities;that the  
adversary may make this or that move,  
and attack this or that piece, and what  
different means can be used to avoid his  
stroke, or turn its consequences against  
him. 3rd, Caution, not to make our moves  
too hastily. This habit is best acquired  
by observing strictly the laws of the  
game, such as, if you touch a piece, you  
must move it somewhere, if you set it  
down, you must let it stand. Therefore,  
it would bo tho bettor way to observe  
these rules, aa the gamo becomes thereby  
more the imago of human life, and  
particularly of war, in which if you  
have incautiously put yourself into a  
bad and dangerous position, you cannot  
obtain&#x27; your enemies&#x27; leave to withdraw  
your troops, and place them moro  
securely, but you must abido all tho  
consequences of your rashness. And,  
lastly, we learn by Chess the habit of  
not being discouraged by present bad  
appearances in tho state of our affairs,  
tho habit of hoping for a favourable  
chanco, and that of persevering in tho  
search of resources. Tho game is so full  
of events, there is such a variety of  
turns in it, the fortuno of it is so  
open to vicissitudes, and1 one so  
frequently, after contemplation,  
discovers tho means of extricating one&#x27;s  
self from a supposed insurmountable  
difficulty, that one is encouraged to  
continue the contest to tho last, in  
hopes of viotoryfrom ourskill, or, at  
least, from the negligence of our  
adversary, and whoever considers, what  
in Chess he often sees instances of,  
that success is apt to produce  
presumption and its consequent  
inattention, by which more is afterwards  
lost than was gained by tho proceeding  
advantage while misfortunes produce more  
care and attention, by which the loss  
may be recovered, will learn not to be  
too much discouraged by any present  
successes of bis adversary, nor to  
despair of final good fortunelupon every  
little cheok he receives in the pursuit  
of it.

de San Angel, receiver of the ecclesiastical  
revenue in Aragon, but Columbus had re­  
fused to take charge unless created admiral  
and vicerov over the countries he might dis­  
cover. This title had been refused him and  
he had taken his departure with the inten­  
tion of offering his servies to some other  
sovereign.  
Above all, what moral instruction there  
is in the game, when compared to that of  
life, to which Franklin, that noble philoso­  
pher most fitly likens it in his essay entitled,  
&quot;The Morals of Chess&quot; from which, in con­  
clusion, I quote a few passages:  
The game of chess is not merely an idle amuse.­  
ment; several very valuable qualities of the mind,  
useful in the course of human life, are to be acquir-­  
ed and strengthed by it, so as to become habits  
ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of chess, in  
which we have often points to gain, and competitors  
or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is  
a vast variety of good and iil events that are, in  
some degree, the effect of brudence, or of the want  
of it. By playing chess, then, we may learn:  
First- Foresight, which looks a l ttle into futur­  
ity, and considers the consequences that may attend  
an action; for it is continually occurring to the  
player, &#x27;If I move this piece, what will be the ade­  
vantage or disadvantage of my new situation! What  
use can my adversary make of it, to annoy me!  
What other moves cand make to support it, and to  
defend my self from h ttack!  
decond- Circumsy action, which surveys the whole  
chess-board, or scene of action; the relation of the  
several spieces, and their situations; the dangers  
they are repeatedly exposed to; the several posse­  
bilities of their aiding esch other; the probabilities  
that the adversary may make this or that move, and  
attack this or that piece, and what different means  
can be used to avoid his stroke, or turn its conse­  
quences against him.  
&quot;Third-Caution, not to make our moves too hastr­  
y. This habit is bestecquired by observing strict­  
ly the laws of the game; such as, if you touch a  
piece, you must move it somewhere; if you set it  
down you must let it stand.  
Therefore, never deviate from strict play; as  
the game becomes thereby more the image of hu­  
man life, and particularly of war; in which, if you  
have incautiously put yourself into a bad and an­  
gerous position, you cannot obtain your enemy  
leave to withdraw your troops and place them more  
securely; but you must abide all the consequences  
of your rashness.  
And, lastly, we learn by chess the habit of not  
being discouraged by present bad appearances in  
the state of our affairs; the habit of hoping for a  
favorable chance, and that of perseveriag in the  
scarch of resources. The game is so full of events,

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
The game of chess is not merely an idle amusement ; several valuable qualities  
of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened  
by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions : for life is a kind of chess, in  
which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with,  
and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events that are, in some  
degree, the effect of prudence, or of the want of it. By playing at chess, then, we  
may learn—  
  
1st. Foresight, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequence  
that may attend an action ; for it is continually occurring to the player, “If I move  
this piece, what will be the advantage or disadvantage of my new situation? What  
use can my adversary make of it, to annoy me! What other moves can I make to  
support it, and to defend myself from his attacks ?”  
  
2d. Circumspection, which surveys the whole chess-board, or scene of action ;  
the relation of the several pieces, and their situations ; the dangers they are repeat-  
edly exposed to; the several possibilities of their aiding each other ; the probabil-  
ities that the adversary may make this or that move, and attack this or that piece ;  
and what different means can be used to avoid the stroke, or turn its consequences  
against him.

3d. Caution, not to make our moves too hastily. This habit is best acquired  
by observing strictly the laws of the game ; such as, if you touch a piece, you must  
move it somewhere ; if you set it down, you must let it stand.  
  
Therefore, it would be the better way to observe these rules, as the game  
becomes thereby more the image of human life, and particularly of war ; in which,  
if you have incautiously put yourself into a bad and dangerous position, you can-  
not obtain leave of your enemies to withdraw your troops, and place them more  
securely ; but you must abide all the consequences of your rashness.  
  
And, lastly, we learn by chess the habit of not being discouraged by present  
bad appearances in the state of our affairs; the habit of hoping for a favorable  
chance, and that of persevering in the search of resources. The game is so full of  
events, there is such a variety of turns in it, the fortune of it is so sudden to vicis-  
situdes, and one so frequently, after contemplation, discovers the means of extri-  
cating one’s self from a supposed insurmountable difficulty, that one is encouraged  
to continue the contest to the last, in hopes of victory from our skill ; or, at least,  
from the negligence of our adversary. And whoever considers, what in chess he  
often sees instances of, that success is apt to produce presumption and its conse-  
quent inattention, by which more is afterwards lost than was gained by the preced-  
ing advantage, while misfortunes produce more care and attention, by which the  
loss may be recovered, will learn not to be too much discouraged by any present  
successes of his adversary, nor to despair of final good fortune upon every little  
check he receives in the pursuit of it.  
  
That we may, therefore, be induced more frequently to choose this beneficial  
amusement in preference to others, which are not attended with the same advan-  
tages, every circumstance that may increase the pleasure of it should be regarded ;  
and every action or word that is unfair, disrespectful, or that in any way may give  
uneasiness, should be avoided, as contrary to the immediate intention of both the  
parties, which is to pass the time agreeably :  
  
1. Therefore, if it is agreed to play according to the strict rules, then those  
rules are to be strictly observed by both parties; and should not be insisted upon  
for one side, while deviated from by the other, for this is not equitable.  
  
2. If it is agreed not to observe the rules exactly, but one party demands  
indulgences, he should then be as willing to allow them to the other.  
  
3. No false move should ever be made to extricate yourself out of a difficulty,  
or to gain an advantage ; for there can be no pleasure in playing with a man once  
detected in such unfair practice.  
  
4. If your adversary is long in playing, you ought not to hurry him, or express  
any uneasiness at his delay ; not even by looking at your watch, or taking up a  
book to read ; you should not sing, nor whistle, nor make a tapping with your feet  
on the floor, or with your fingers on the table, nor do anything that may distract  
his attention ; for all these things displease, and they do not prove your skill in  
playing, but your craftiness and your rudeness.
