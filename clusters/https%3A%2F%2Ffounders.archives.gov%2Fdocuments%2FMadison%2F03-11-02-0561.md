It has happened, either from the remissness of the President of the Convention in not sending them, or from their having miscaried if sent by the Mail, that neither the President of the Senate, nor the Speaker of the House of Representatives, have received the Copies which were intended for them.

any subsequent qualification, on enteringon the du­

remember having seen any reference to the  
law of March 1, 1792, relating to the case of

It is well understood that when the office of  
President becomes vacant, the Vice-President  
becomes President ; and in case of his death,  
removal, or other cause, the President of the  
Senate succeeds to the position, or if there be

have succeeded. On the contrary, they can
