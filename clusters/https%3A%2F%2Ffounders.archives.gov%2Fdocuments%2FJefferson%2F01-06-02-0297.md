The chances that in marriage she will draw a  
blockhead, I culculate at about fourteen to

combine a certain extent of reading in the

time in Philadelphia will be chiefly occupied  
in acquiring as little taste and execution in

 ON WOMAN&#x27;S EduCATION.  
Cleveland Sunday Sun: Mrs. Mary J.  
Holmes, of Memphis, Tennessee, at present the  
guest of a friend in this city, during a recent visit  
to Paris discovered the following remarkable letter-  
in the manuscript department of the &quot;Bibliotheque  
Nationale.&quot; It is from Thomas Jefferson to M. de  
Marbois, then secretary of the French legation at  
Philadelphla, Mrs. Holmes made an exact copy of  
the letter, which contains ideas clearly showing  
Jefferson&#x27;s ideas and patriotic impulses:  
ANNAPOLIS, December 5, 1783.  
Monsieur de Marbois, Secretary of the French Le­  
gation at Philadelphia:  
Your very obliging letter of November 23d was  
put in my hands just in the moment of my depar­  
ture from Philadelphia, which put it out of my  
power to acknowledge in the same instant my of  
ligations for the charges you were so kind as to  
UlueI tnkool preschtliin  hohel e a  
daughter,-and for the very friendly dispostion  
you flatter me with. The same cause prevented  
my procuring the books you were so kind as to  
recommend, but this shall be supplied by orders  
from hence. I had left with her a Gil blas and  
Don Quickotts, which are among the best books of  
their class, as far as I am acquainted with them.  
The plan of reading which I have formed for her is  
iderably different from what I think would be  
most proper for her sex in any other country  
than America. I am obliged in it to extend my  
views bavond herself and consider her as possible  
at the head of a little family of her own. The  
chances are that in marriage she will draw  
blockhead I calculate at about fourteen to one  
and of course that the education of her family wi  
probably rest on her own ideas and direction with­  
out assistance. With the best poets and prose  
writers I shall, therefore, combine a certain extent  
of reading in the graver scenes; however, I scarce­  
ly expect to enter her on this until she returns to  
me. Her time in Philadelphia will be chiefly oc­  
cupied in such of the fine arts as she could not  
prosecute to equal advantage in a more retired sit  
uation. We have yet but fourteen States in con­  
gress. I think when we are assembled we shall  
propose to despatch the most urging and important  
business, and, putting by what may wait, separate  
and return to our respective States, leaving only a  
committee of the States. The constant session of  
Congress cannot be necessary in time of peace, and  
their separation will destroy the strange idea of  
their being a permanent bo dyewhich unaccounta  
has taken possession of the heads of their con­  
stituents, and occasions jealousies injurious to the  
public good. I have the honor being with very  
perfect esteem and respect, sir, your most obedient  
and most humble servant,  
THOMAS JEFFERSON
