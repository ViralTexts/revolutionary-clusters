Dear Sir  
Washington July 11. 1801.  
  
Your favor of the 15th. came to hand on the 25th. of June, and conveyed a great deal of that information which I am anxious to recieve. the consolidation of our fellow citizens in general is the great object we ought to keep in view, and that being once obtained, while we associate with us in affairs to a certain degree the federal sect of republicans, we must strip of all the means of influence the Essex junto &amp; their associate monocrats in every part of the union. the former differ from us only in the shares of power to be given to the executive, being with us attached to republican government, the latter wish to sap the republic by fraud if they cannot destroy it by force, &amp; to erect an English monarchy in it’s place, some of them (as mr Adams) thinking it’s corrupt parts should be cleansed away, others, (as Hamilton) thinking that would make it an impracticable machine. we are proceeding gradually in the regeneration of offices, &amp; introducing republicans to some share in them. I do not know that it will be pushed further than was settled before you went away, except as to Essex men. I must ask you to make out a list of those in office in your’s &amp; the neighboring states, &amp; to furnish me with it. there is little of this spirit South of the Hudson. I understand that Jackson is a very determined one, tho’ in private life amiable &amp; honorable. but amiable monarchists are not safe subjects of republican confidence. what will be the effect of his removal? how should it be timed? who his successor? what place can Genl. Lyman properly occupy? our gradual reformations seem to produce good effects every where except in Connecticut. their late session of legislature has been more intolerant than all others. we must meet them with equal intolerance. when they will give a share in the state offices, they shall be replaced in a share of the General offices. till then we must follow their example. mr Goodrich’s removal has produced a bitter remonstrance, with much personality against the two Bishops. I am sincerely sorry to see the inflexibility of the federal spirit there, for I cannot believe they are all monarchists.
