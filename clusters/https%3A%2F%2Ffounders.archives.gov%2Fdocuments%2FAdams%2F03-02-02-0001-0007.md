And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.

e Afternoon. Immediately after Prayers we had a Class meeting for the Purpose of choosing a Valedictory Orator, and Collectors of Theses. Eaton was moderator. A motion was carried that a majority of the votes of Class should be necessary for an Election. When the votes were collected it was found there was no choice. There were five votes, for Jackson, the last Person, that would have been suspected of obtaining any. A second attempt was made, equally fruitless. Jackson had ten Votes. It was then resolved, that the choice of an Orator should be deferred; and that the Class should proceed to that of the Collectors. The one for Technology, Gra

mmar, and Rhetoric was first ballotted. Waldo, had 20 Votes; but as a majority of all the Votes was required there was no Choice. It was voted then, that the Person who should have for the future, the greatest number of Votes, should be duly elected. Waldo said, he was sensible of the honour done him by those gentlemen, that had voted for him; but that he wished to be excused. He was taken at his word, and Abbot 2d. was chosen. His modesty and diffidence were such that he earnestly requested to be excused; but with great difficulty was prevailed upon to accept. The second Collector for Logic, Metaphysics, Ethics, Theology, and Politics, was then Chosen. Fiske was the Person. The Mathematical Part fell to Adams, and the Physical to Johnstone. The choice of those was not so judicious as that of the others. Cranch and Abbot 1st would undoubtedly have been more proper Persons, but neither of them would probably have accepted, a second choice. The meeting at about 7 o’clock was adjourned till Monday evening, when we shall proceed to the Choice of an Orator.

to the conduct of it, we may readily confess that few dramatic performances are better; but the very foundation upon which the whole fabric is erected appears injudicious, disgusting, and contrary to all probability. Who can believe that the Senate of Venice, would give the government of an island belonging to the State, to a moor, when it is known how constantly the Venitian nobility have always enjoy’d every employment in the State? And how tenacious they have ever been of this Prerogative? And is it natural that a young Lady so virtuous and Chaste as Desdemona is represented would as Brabantio expresses it,   
  
“Run from her guardage to the sooty Bosom  
of such a thing as him, to fear, not to delight.”  
  
In short I never could conceive what induced the Poet to take a negro for an example of Jealousy. But from this defect great Beauties are derived. In particular the speech of Othello to justify himself before the Senate   
  
“My Story being done  
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs,  
She swore in faith twas strange, twas passing strange  
Twas pitiful, twas wondrous pitiful.  
She wish’d she had not heard it; yet she wish’d  
That heaven had made her such a man. She thank’d me  
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,  
I should but teach him how to tell my Story  
And that would woo her. On this hint I spake,  
She loved me for the dangers I had past  
And I loved her that she did pity them.”  
  
This is to perfection, the artless, and rough, but winning eloquence of a Soldier.
