“ Washington, July 19, 1803,  
  
“MY LORD,  
  
¢« 1 received through the hands of Mr.  
[.ennox, on his return to the United States,  
the valuable volume you were so good as to  
send me on the life and writings of VLeicu­  
en of Salton.  
  
“ The political principles of that Patriot  
were worthy of the purest periods of the Bri­  
tish constitution. They are those which were  
in vigour at the epoch of the American emi­  
gration ; our ancestors brought them here,  
and they needed little strengthening to make

dition of English Whigism, at this day, it  
requires more firmness to publish and advo­  
cate them than it did then to act upon them.  
This merit is peculiarly your Lordship’s, and  
no one honours it more than mysell ; freely  
admitting at the same time, the right of a  
natien to change its political priaciples and  
constitution at will ; and the impropriety of  
any but its’ own citizens censuring that  
change. I expect your Lordship has been  
disappointed, as I acknowledge 1 have been,  
in the issue of the convulsions on the other  
side of the channel, (in France.) This has  
certainly lessened the interest which the phi­  
lanthropist warmly felt in those sirupgles.  
Without befriending human liberty, a gigan­  
tick force has risen upry, which seems to threa­  
ten the world=&lt;but it hangs on the thread of  
opinion, which may break from one¢ duy to a­  
nother. .

which your nation is again engaged, and

together the waters under the heavens into  
one place, divided the dry lands of your hem­

¢ here at least be there peace.” 1 hope that  
peace and amity with all nations will long be  
the charter of ourland and that its prosperi­  
ty, under this charter will react on the mind  
of Europe, and profit her by the example.  
My hope of preserving peace for our coun­  
try is not founded on the Quaker-principle,  
ol non-resistance under every wrong ; but in  
~the belief thata just and friendly conduct on  
~our part wiil procure justice and fricudship

another. I feel real anxiety on the conflict  
in which your nation is again engaged; and  
bless the Almighty Being, who in ‘ gather-  
ing together the waters under the heavens  
into one place, divided the dry lands’ of  
your hemisphere, from the dry lands of  
ours, and said ‘ here, at least, be there peace.’  
I hope that peace and amity with all nations  
will long be the charter of our land, and  
that its prosperity under this charter will  
re-act on the mind of Europe, and profit  
her by the example. My hope of preserv-  
ing peace for our country is not founded on  
the Quaker principle of non-resistance un-  
der every wrong, but in the belief that a  
just and friendiy conduct on our part will  
procure justice and friendship from others,  
and that in the existing contest, each of the  
combatants will find .an interest in our  
friendship. I cannot say we shall be un-  
concerned spectators of the combat. We  
feel for human sufferings ; and we wish the  
good of all. We shall look on therefore  
with the sensations which these dispositions  
and the events of the war will produce.

your Lordship’s; and po one honors it  
more than myself; freely admitting at  
the same time, the right of a nation to  
change its political principles and con-

I expect your Lordship has been disap-
