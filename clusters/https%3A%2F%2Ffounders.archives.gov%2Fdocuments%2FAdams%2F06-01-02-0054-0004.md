We hear from Braintree that the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of that Town, legally assembled on Tuesday the Twenty fourth of September last, unanimously voted, that Instructions should be given their Representative, for his Conduct in General Assembly, on this great Occasion—The Substance of these Instructions is as follows:  
To EBENEZER THAYER, Esq.  
SIR,  
“In all the Calamities which have ever befallen this Country, we have never felt so great a Concern, or such alarming Apprehensions, as on this Occasion.—Such is our Loyalty to the King, our Veneration for both Houses of Parliament, and our Affection for all our Fellow subjects in Britain, that Measures, which discover any Unkindness in that Country towards Us, are the more sensibly and intimately felt. And we can no longer forbear complaining, that many of the Measures of the late Ministry, and some of the late Acts of Parliament, have a Tendency, in our Apprehension, to divest us of our most essential Rights and Liberties.—We shall confine ourselves, however, chiefly to the Act of Parliament, commonly called the Stamp-Act, by which a very burthensome, and in our Opinion, unconstitutional Tax, is to be laid upon us all; and we subjected to numerous and enormous Penalties, to be prosecuted, sued for, and recovered, at the Option of an Informer, in a Court of Admiralty without a Jury.  
We have called this a burthensome Tax, because the Duties are so numerous and so high, and the Embarrassments to Business in this infant, sparsely-settled Country, so great, that it would be totally impossible for the People to subsist under it, if we had no Controversy at all about the Right and Authority of imposing it. Considering the present Scarcity of Money, we have Reason to think, the Execution of that Act for a short Space of Time would drein the Country of its Cash, strip Multitudes of all their Property, and reduce them to absolute Beggary. And what the Consequence would be to the Peace of the Province, from so sudden a Shock and such a convulsive Change, in the whole Course of our Business and Subsistence, we tremble to consider.—We further apprehend this Tax to be unconstitutional: We have always understood it to be a grand and fundamental Principle of the Constitution, that no Freeman should be subjected to any Tax, to which he has not given his own Consent, in Person or by Proxy. And the Maxims of the Law as we have constantly received them, are to the same Effect, that no Freeman can be separated from his Property, but by his own Act or Fault. We take it clearly, therefore, to be inconsistent with the Spirit of the Common Law, and of the essential fundamental Principles of the British Constitution, that we should be subjected to any Tax, imposed by the British Parliament: because we are not represented in that Assembly in any Sense, unless it be by a Fiction of Law, as insensible in Theory as it would be injurious in Practice, if such a Taxation should be grounded on it.  
But the most grievous Innovation of all, is the alarming Extension of the Power of Courts of Admiralty. In these Courts, one Judge presides alone! No Juries have any Concern there!—The Law, and the Fact, are both to be decided by the same single Judge, whose Commission is only during Pleasure, and with whom, as we are told, the most mischievous of all Customs has become established, that of taking Commissions on all Condemnations; so that he is under a pecuniary Temptation always against the Subject. Now, if the Wisdom of the Mother Country has thought the Independency of the Judges, so essential to an impartial Administration of Justice, as to render them independent of every Power on Earth, independent of the King, the Lords, the Commons, the People, nay independent, in Hope and Expectation, of the Heir apparent, by continuing their Commissions after a Demise of the Crown; What Justice and Impartiality are we, at 3000 Miles distance from the Fountain to expect from such a Judge of Admiralty? We have all along thought the Acts of Trade in this Respect a Grievance: but the Stamp-Act has opened a vast Number of Sources of new Crimes, which may be committed by any Man, and cannot, but be committed by Multitudes, and prodigious Penalties are annexed, and all these are to be tried by such a Judge of such a Court!—What can be wanting, after this, but a weak or wicked Man for a Judge, to render Us the most sordid and forlorn of Slaves? We mean the Slaves of a Slave of the Servants of a Minister of State:—We cannot help asserting therefore, that this Part of the Act will make an essential Change in the Constitution of Juries, and is directly repugnant to the Great Charter itself. For by that Charter “No Amerciament shall be assessed, but by the Oath of honest and lawful Men of the Vicinage.”—And “No Freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or disseized of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, nor passed upon, nor condemned, but by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.”—So that this Act will “make such a Distinction, and create such a Difference between” the Subjects in Great-Britain, and those in America as we could not have expected from the Guardians of Liberty in “Both.”  
As these, Sir, are our Sentiments of that Act, We, the Freeholders and other Inhabitants, legally assembled for this Purpose, must enjoin it upon you, to comply with no Measures or Proposals for countenancing the same, or assisting in the Execution of it, but by all lawful Means, consistent with our Allegiance to the King, and Relation to Great Britain, to oppose the Execution of it, till we can hear the Success of the Cries and Petitions of America for Relief.  
We further recommend the most clear and explicit Assertion and Vindication of our Rights and Liberties, to be entered on the Public Records; that the World may know, in the present and all future Generations, that we have a clear Knowledge and a just Sense of them, and, with Submission to Divine Providence, that we never can be Slaves.  
Nor can we think it adviseable to agree to any Steps for the Protection of stamped Papers, or Stamp-Officers.—Good and wholsome Laws we have already, for the Preservation of the Peace: And we apprehend there is no further Danger of Tumult and Disorder,—to which we have a well-grounded Aversion; and that any extraordinary and expensive Exertions, would tend to exasperate the People and endanger the public Tranquility, rather than the contrary.—Indeed we cannot too often inculcate upon you our Desires, that all extraordinary Grants and expensive Measures, may, upon all Occasions, as much as possible be avoided.—The Public Money, of this Country, is the Toil and Labour of the People, who are under many uncommon Difficulties and Distresses, at this Time: So that all reasonable Frugality ought to be observed. And we would recommend particularly, the strictest Care, and the utmost Firmness to prevent all unconstitutional Draughts upon the Public Treasur

SIR.  
ce N all the Calamities which have ever befallen this Country, we have  
never felt ſo great a Concern, or ſuch alarming Apprehenſions, as on  
this Heeg eee Sc is our Loyalty to the King, our Veneration for both  
Houſes of Parliament, and our Affection for all our Fellow ſubjects in Bri-  
tain, that Meaſures, which diſcover, any Unkindneſs in that Country to-  
wards Us, are the more ſenſibly and intimately felt. And we can no long-  
er forbear complaining, that many of the Meaſures of the late Miniſtry,  
and ſome of the late Acts of Parliament, have a Tendency, in our Appre-  
henſion, to diveſt us of our moſt eſlential Rights and Liberties.—We ſhall  
confine ourſelves, however, chiefly to the Act of Parliament, commonly  
called the Stamp Act, by which a very burthenſome, and in our Opinion,  
unconſtitutional Tax, is to be laid upon us all; and we ſubjected to nu-  
merous and enormous Penalties, to be proſecuted, ſued for, and recovered,  
  
at the Option of an Informer, in a Court of Admiralty without a Jury.—  
«© We have called this a burthenſome Tax, becauſe the Duties are fo.  
numerous and fo high, and the Embarraſſments to Buſineſs in this infant,  
Tparſely-ſettled Country, ſo great, that it would be totally impoſſible for the  
People to ſubſiſt under it, if we had no Controverſy at all about the Right  
and Authority of impoſing it. Conſidering the preſent Scarcity of Money,  
we have Reaſon. to think, the Execution of that Act for a ſhort Space of  
Time would dren the Country of its Caſh, ſtrip Multitudes of all their  
Property, and reduce them to abſolute Beggary. And what the Conſequence  
would be to the Peace of the Province, from ſo ſudden- a Shock and  
ſuch a convulſive Change, in the whole Courſe of our Buſineſs and Subſiſt-  
ence, we tremble to conſider. —We further apprehend this Tax to be uncon-  
ſtitutional: We have always underſtood it to be a grand and fundamental  
Principle of the Conſtitution, that no Freeman ſhould be ſubjected to any  
Tax, to which he has. not given his own Conſent, in Perſon or by Proxy.  
And the Maxims of the Law as we have conſtantly received them are to the  
  
ſame Effect, that no Freeman can be ſeparated from his Property, but b  
his own Act or Fault—We take it clearly, therefore, to be inconſiſtent with  
the Spirit of the Common Law, and of the eſſential fundamental Principles  
of the Britiſh Conſtitution, that we ſhould be ſubjected to any Tax, im-  
poſed by the Britiſh Parliament: becaufe we are not repreſented in that Aſ-  
ſembly in any Senſe, unleſs it be by a Fiction of Law, as inſenſible in Theory  
as it would be injurious in Practice, if ſuch a Taxation ſhould be grounded

Miles diſtance from the Fountain to expect from ſuch a Judge of Admiralty ?  
We have all along  
  
thought the Acts of Trade in this reſpect a Grievance :  
but the Stamp-Act — ened a vaſt Number of * of new Crimes,  
which may — committed by any Man, and cannot, but be committed by  
Multitudes, and prodigious Penalties ate annexed, and all thefe are to be  
tried by ſuch a 2 of ſuch a Court What can be wanting after this,  
but a weak or wicked Man for a Judge, to render us the moſt ſordid and  
forlorn of Slaves? We mean the Slaves of a Have of the Servants of a Mini-  
ſter of State: We cannot help aſſerting therefore, that this Part of the Act  
will make an eſſential — in the — of Juries, and is directly  
repugnant to the Great Charter itſelf. For by that Charter No Amercia-  
ment ſhall be aſſeſſed, but by the Oath of honeſt and lawful Men of the  
Vicinage. „And No Freeman ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, or diſſeized  
of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Cuſtoms, nor paſſed upon, nor con-  
demned, but by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.”  
— 80 that this Act will“ make ſuch a diſtinction, and create ſuch a Differ-  
ence between” the Subjects in Great- Britain, and thoſe in America as we  
could not have expected from the Guardians of Liberty in Both,”— _  
  
As theſe, Six, are our Sentiments of that Act, We, the Freeholders and  
  
other Inhabitants, legally aſſembled for this Purpoſe, muſt enjoin it upon  
you, to comply wah 3 no Meakures or Propoſals for countenancing the ſame,  
or aſſiſting in the Execution of it, but by all lawful Means, conſiſtent with  
our Allegiance to the King, and Relation to Great-Britain, to oppoſe the  
Execution of 1t, till we can hear the Succels of the Cries and Petitions of  
America for Relief.  
We further recommend the moſt clear and explicit Aﬀertion and Vindi-  
cation of our Rights and Liberties, to be entered on the Public Records;  
that the World may know, in the preſent and all future Generations, that  
we have a clear Knowledge and a juſt Senſe of them, and, with Submiſſion  
to Divine Providence, that we never can be Slaves.  
  
Nor can we think it adviſeable to agree to any Steps. for the Protection  
of ſtamped Papers, or Stamp-Officers——Good and whollome Laws we  
have already, for the Preſervation of the Peace : And we apprehend there  
is no further Danger of Tumult and Diſorder, —to which we have a well-  
grounded Averſion; and that any extraordinary and expenſive Exertions,  
would tend to exaſperate the People and endanger the public Tranquility,  
rather than the contrary, Indeed we cannot tov often inculcate upon you  
our Defires, that all extraordinary Grants and expenſive Meaſures, may,  
upon all Occaſions, as much as poſſible be avoided. —The Public Money, of  
  
this Country, is the Toil and Labour of the People, who are under many  
uncommon Difficulties and Diſtreſſes, at this Time: So that all reaſonable  
Frugality ought to be obſerved. And we would recommend particularly,  
the ſtricteſt Care, and the utmoſt Firmneſs to prevent all unconſtitutional  
Dr aughts upon the Public Treaſury

Bofton, OStober 10. We hear from  
Braintree, that the frecholders, and other  
inhabitants of that town, legally aflembled,  
on Tuefday, the twenty-fourth of Septem~  
ber laft, unanimoufly veted, that inftruc-  
tions fhould be given their Repretentative,  
for his conduét in General Aflembly, on  
this great occafion.—T he fubftance of thefs  
inftructions is as follows :  
  
To EBENEZER THAYER, Efq.  
  
‘STIR,  
  
* IN all the calamities which have ever  
befallen this country, we have never felt  
fo great a soncern, or fuch alarming ap.  
Pprehentions,  
  
  
  
  
  
46  
prehenfions, as on this occafion.—Such is  
our loyalty to the King, our veneration for  
both Houfes of Parliament, and our af-  
fection for all our fellow-fubjeéts in Bri-  
tain, that meafures, which difcover any  
wnkindnefs in that country towards us,  
are the more fenfibly and intimately félt.  
And we can no longer forbear complain-  
ing, that many of the meafures of the Tate  
Miniftry, and fome of the late aéts of  
Parliament, have a tendency, in our ap-  
prehenfion, to diveft us of our moft effen-  
tial rights and liberties.— We thall confine  
ourfelves, however, chiefly to the aét of  
Parliament commonly called the ftamp-  
aét, by which’ a very burthenfome, and,  
3p our opinion, unconftitutional tax, is to  
be laid upon us’ all 5: and-we fubjected to  
numerous and enormous penalties, to. be  
  
profecuted, fued for, and recovered, at the’  
  
option of an informer, in a Court of  
Admiralty, without a jury.  
  
¢ We have ‘called this a burthenfome  
tax, becaufe the duties are fo numerous  
and fo high, and. the,embarraffinents to  
bufinefs in this infant, fcarcely-fetuled coun-  
try, fo great, that it would be totally  
impoffible for the people to fubfift under  
it, if we-had-no controverfy at all about  
  
the right and authority of impofing it.”  
  
Confidering the prefent fcarcity of money,  
we have reafon to think, the execution of  
that a&amp;t-for-a fhort {pace of time would  
drain the country of its cafh, ftrip multi-  
tudes of all their property, and reduce  
them to abfolute begg’ry. And what the  
confequence would be, to the peace of the  
provmee, from fo fudden a fliock, and  
fuch a cofvulfive charge, in the: whole  
courfe of our bufincfs and fubfiftence, we  
tremble to confider.—We further appre-  
hend this tax to be unconftitutional : We  
have always underftood it to bea grand  
and fundamental principle of the conttitu-  
tion, that ‘no freeman fhould be fubjected  
to any tax, to which he has not given his  
own confent, in perfon, or by proxy.”  
And the maxims of the law, as we have

be inconfiftent with the fpirit of the com-  
mon law, and of the effential fundamental  
principles of the Britith conftitution, that

as infenfible in theory as it would be inju-  
  
rious in prattice, if fuch a taxation fhould  
be grourided on it.  
  
« But the moft grievous innovation of  
all is the alarming extenfion of the power  
of Courts of Admiralty. In thefe Courts  
* one Judge prefides alone! No Juries  
have any concern there !—The law, and  
the fa&amp;, are both to be decided by the  
fame fingle Judge, whofe commiffion is  
only during plealtre, and with whom, as  
we are told, the * moft mifchievous of al!  
cuftoms” has become eftablifhed, that of  
« taking commiffions * on all condemna.  
tions,” fo that he is under a pecuniary temp.  
tation always againft the fubjeét. Now,  
if the wifdom of the mother-country has  
thought the independency of the Judges  
fo effential to an impartial adminittration  
of juftice, as to render them independent.  
of every power on earth, independent of  
the King, the Lords, the Commons, the  
people, nay, independent, in hope-and ex-  
pectation, of the heir apparent, by conti-  
nuing their €ommiffions after a demife of  
the Crown ; what juftice and impartiality  
are we, at 3000 miles diftance from the  
fountain, to expect from fuch a Judge of  
Admiralty ? ‘We have all along thought  
the acts of trade, in this refpeé, a griev-  
ance: But the ftamp-aé has opened a vaft  
number of fources of new crimes, which  
may becommitted by any man, and can-  
not but be committed by multitudes, and  
prodigious penalties are annexed, and all  
thefe are to be tried by fuch a Judge of  
fuch a Court !—What can be wanting, af-  
ter this, but a weak or wicked man fora  
Judge, to render us the moft fordid and  
forlorn of flaves ? We mean the flaves of  
a flave of the fervants of a Minifter of  
State.—We cannot help afferting, there-  
fore, that this part of the act will make  
an effential change in the conftitution of  
Juries, and is direétly repugnant to the  
Great Charter itfelf: For, by that charter,  
* No amerciament fhall be affeffed, but by  
the oath of honeft and lawful men of the  
vicinage ;&quot;—-and ¢ No freeman fhal) be ta-  
ken, or imprifoned, or diffeized of his  
freehold, or liberties, or free cuftoms, nor  
paffed upon, nor condemned, but by law-  
ful judgment of his peers, or by the law of  
the land.’— So that this aé will make fuch  
a diftin&amp;tion, and create fuch a difference  
between’ the fubje&amp;s in Great Britain and  
thofe in America, as we could not have  
expected from the guardians of liberty in  
* both.” :
