Nothing overcomes passion more than  
suence.  
If we do not wrong others, God will  
right us.  
Whatsoever we beg of God, let us also  
work for it.  
Habit if not resisted, soon becomes a  
necessity.  
To rule oneself is in reality the great

You cannot make a general rule ap­

Those who would have a happy death

Friendship gives no privilege to make
