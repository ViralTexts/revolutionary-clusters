For my own part, conscious of having acted while a Servant of the public, in the manner I conceived best suited to promote the real interests of my Country; having in Consequence of my fixed belief, in some measure, pledged myself to the Army, that their Country would finally do them complete and ample justice, and not willing to conceal any instance of my official conduct from the eyes of the World, I have thought proper to transmit to your Excellency the inclosed Collection of Papers, relative to the half pay and commutation granted by Congress to the Officers of the Army. From these communications, my decided Sentiment will be clearly comprehended, together with the conclusive reasons, which induced me at  
  
an early period, to recommend the Adoption of this measure in the most earnest and serious manner. As the proceedings of Congress, the Army, and myself are open to all, and contain, in my Opinion, sufficient information to remove the prejudice and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it unnecessary to say anything more, than just to observe, that the Resolutions of Congress, now alluded to, are as undoubtedly and absolutely binding upon the United States, as the most solemn Acts of Confederation or legislation.  
As to the idea, which I am informed has in some instances prevailed, that the half pay and commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a pension, it ought to be exploded forever. That provision should be viewed as it really was a reasonable Compensation offered by Congress, at a time when they had nothing else to give to Officers of the Army for Services then to be performed. It was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the Service; it was a part of their hire. I may be allowed to say, it was the price of their blood and of your independency; it is therefore more than a common debt, it is a debt of honour; it can never be considered as a Pension or Gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly discharged.

which he advocated it. They, and all who  
went with them, acted under the weight of a  
powerful conviction of the righteousness of  
Vie cause. No personal considerations—no  
promises of benefit—no epicurean entertain­  
ments have had any thing to do with the  
action of members in the matter. The case  
stands on its own broad merits, and as  
  
Washington said, is a “debt of honor which

The announcement of the cessation of hostili-  
ties between the United States and Great Britain  
was made on the 18th of April, 1783. No provision  
for paying the debts dug to the army was uttered.  
The jealousies of the States rendered the Con-  
federation still more powerless than ever.  
  
On the 8ta of June, 1783, Washington an-  
nounced the proposed disbanding of the army ‘0  
the Governors of the several States, and thus de-  
fended and insisted on the_provision which had  
been promised to the officers of the army:

The learned counsel for the State of Iowa referred to General  
Washington’s Circular Letter of June 8th, 1783, to the governors  
of the States, and especially to the passage in which he insisted  
that the half pay and commutation promised by the Congress  
of the Confederation to the officers of the army, during the war  
of the Revolution, “should be viewed, as it really was, a  
reasonable compensation offered by Congress, at a time when  
they had nothing else to give, to the officers of the army for  
services, then to be performed; it was the only means to pre-  
vent a total dereliction of the service; it was a part of their  
hire; I may be allowed to say, it was the price of their blood  
and of your independency ; it is therefore more than a common  
debt; it is a debt of honor; it can never be considered as a  
pension or gratuity, nor be cancelled until it is fairly discharged.

debt of some three or four millions, even more  
sacred and obligatory than the debt due to the  
sufferers by the French spoliations. It is more  
acred and obligatory in the proportion of the  
whole nation to three or four states, for (I  
quote no less respectable testimony than that
