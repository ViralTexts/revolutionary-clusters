t 3 o’clock. After Prayers the Class met by adjournment, and Fiske was chosen moderator. It was then resolved that if after the first ballot, there was not a majority for any one Person; the Class should the 2d. Time confine their Votes to the 3 Persons who should have the most votes. I supposed that the greatest contest would lay between Bridge and Little, but to my great surprise, the second ballot Was between Freeman, Little, and Waldo. The third was between Freeman, and Little, who finally carried it by a considerable majority. The Class then all went to his Chamber, but did not stay there more than an hour.

to the conduct of it, we may readily confess that few dramatic performances are better; but the very foundation upon which the whole fabric is erected appears injudicious, disgusting, and contrary to all probability. Who can believe that the Senate of Venice, would give the government of an island belonging to the State, to a moor, when it is known how constantly the Venitian nobility have always enjoy’d every employment in the State? And how tenacious they have ever been of this Prerogative? And is it natural that a young Lady so virtuous and Chaste as Desdemona is represented would as Brabantio expresses it,   
  
“Run from her guardage to the sooty Bosom  
of such a thing as him, to fear, not to delight.”  
  
In short I never could conceive what induced the Poet to take a negro for an example of Jealousy. But from this defect great Beauties are derived. In particular the speech of Othello to justify himself before the Senate   
  
“My Story being done  
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs,  
She swore in faith twas strange, twas passing strange  
Twas pitiful, twas wondrous pitiful.  
She wish’d she had not heard it; yet she wish’d  
That heaven had made her such a man. She thank’d me  
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,  
I should but teach him how to tell my Story  
And that would woo her. On this hint I spake,  
She loved me for the dangers I had past  
And I loved her that she did pity them.”  
  
This is to perfection, the artless, and rough, but winning eloquence of a Soldier.  
The manner in which Iago raises the jealousy of Othello, at first by, obscure hints and insinuations, an

goes to show that, though &quot;Othello&#x27;s  
occupaton may be gone&#x27; the results  
of the schemes to which he resorted are  
still the suuie. She listened to the  
story of his dangers, pitied hina on  
their account and surrendered the  
fortress of her heart, to which he  
laid siege no less valiantly than he  
had agninst the attacks of- the most  
noted outlaw of modern times.  
&quot;She swore, in faith &#x27;twas strange &#x27;twas passing  
strange ;  
&quot;Twas pitiful, &#x27;twas wondrous pitiful.&quot;

And he lov&#x27;d her, that she did pity them.
