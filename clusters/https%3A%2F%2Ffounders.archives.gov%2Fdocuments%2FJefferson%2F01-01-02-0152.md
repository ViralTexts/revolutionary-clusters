NVENTION MAY THE 15TH 1776.PRESENT ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MEMBERS.  
FORASMUCH as all the endeavours of the United Colonies by the most decent representations and petitions to the king and parliament of Great Britain to restore peace and security to America under the British government and a re-union with that people upon just and liberal terms instead of a redress of grievances have produced from an imperious and vindictive administration increased insult oppression and a vigorous attempt to effect our total destruction. By a late act, all these colonies are declared to be in rebellion, and out of the protection of the British crown our properties subjected to confiscation, our people, when captivated, compelled to join in the murder and plunder of their relations and countrymen, and all former rapine and oppression of Americans declared legal and just. Fleets and armies are raised, and the aid of foreign troops engaged to assist these destructive purposes: The king’s representative in this colony hath not only withheld all the powers of government from operating for our safety, but, having retired on board an armed ship, is carrying on a piratical and savage war against us tempting our slaves by every artifice to resort to him, and training and employing them against their masters. In this state of extreme danger, we have no alternative left but an abject  submission to the will of those over-bearing tyrants, or a total separation from the crown and government of Great Britain, uniting and exerting the strength of all America for defence, and forming alliances with foreign powers for commerce and aid in war: Wherefore, appealing to the SEARCHER OF HEARTS for the sincerity of former declarations, expressing our desire to preserve the connection with that nation, and that we are driven from that inclination by their wicked councils, and the eternal laws of self-preservation.  
RESOLVED unanimously, that the delegates appointed to represent this colony in General Congress be instructed to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent states, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the crown or parliament of Great Britain; and that they give the assent of this colony to such declaration, and to whatever measures may be thought proper and necessary by the Congress for forming foreign alliances and a confederation of the colonies, at such time, and in the manner, as to them shall seem best: Provided, that the power of forming government for, and the regulations of the internal concerns of each colony, be left to the respective colonial legislatures.  
RESOLVED unanimously, that a committee be appointed to prepare a DECLARATION of RIGHTS, and such a plan of government as will be most likely to maintain peace and order in this colony, and secure substantial and equal liberty to the people.

In Convention, present one hundred and twelve

“ Foi-mranch ns all the endeavours of the United  
Colonies by the most dcecnt representations and  
petitions to the King and Parliament of Orest  
Britain, to restore penes and securty to America  
under the British government, and a re-unlon with  
that people upon just and liberal terms, instead  
ot a redress of grievances, have produced, from an  
imperious snd vindictive administration, increased  
insult, oppression, and a vigorous attempt to ef­  
fect our total destruction. Bv a late act all in: so  
colonies are declared tn he in rebellion, end out of  
the protection nfa British crown, onr properties  
subject to confiscation, onr people, when captiva­  
ted, compelled to join in the murder and plunder  
ot their relations and countrymen, and all former  
rapine and oppression of Americans, declared legal  
and jest. Fleets and armies are raised, and the  
aid of foreign troops engaged to assist tlu-sc de­  
structive put poses. The King’s representative in  
this colony hath not only withheld all the powers  
ot government from operating for our safety, but  
having retired on board an armed sliip, is” carry­  
ing on a piratical anil savage war against ns, tempt­  
ing onr slaves by every artifice to resort to him,  
and training and employing them against their  
masters. In this s’ate of extreme danger, we  
have no idternat ve left hut an abject sn&#x27;nnixsion f.v  
the will of those over-bearing tyrants, or n total  
separation from the c:own and government of (i.  
Britain, uniting and exerting the strength of a!|  
America for defence, and forming alliances with  
foreign powers for commerce and aid in war ;  
Wherefore, appealing to the searcher of hearts for  
the sincerity of former declarations, expressing  
our desire to preserve the connection wiili that  
nation, and that we are-driven from that inclination

from an imperious and vindictive administration,  
increased insults, oppression, and a vigorous at­

ploying them against their masters.  
  
“.&lt;In this state of extreme danger, we have no alternative left, but an abject  
submission to the will of those overbearing tyrants, or a total separation from  
the crown and government of Great Britain, uniting and exerting the strength  
of all America for defence, and forming alliances with foreign powers for  
commerce and aid in war. Wherefore, appealing to the Searcher of all hearts,  
for the sincerity of former declarations, expressing our desire to preserve our  
connexion with that nation, and that we are driven from that inclination by  
their wicked counsels and the eternal laws of self-preservation; resolved,  
unanimously, that the delegates appointed to represent this colony in general  
congress, be instructed to propose to that respectable body, to declare the  
united colonies free and independent states, absolved from all allegiance to,  
or dependence upon, the crown or parliament of Great Britain; and that they  
give the assent of this colony to that declaration, and to whatever measures  
may be thought proper and necessary by the congress, for forming foreign  
alliances, and a confederation of the colonies, at such time and in such manner  
as to them may seem best. Provided, that the power of forming government  
for, and the regulations of the internal concerns of each colony, be left to the  
respective colonial legislatures.  
  
‘Resolved, unanimously, that a committee be appointed to prepare a  
declaration of rights, and such a plan of government, as will be most likely  
to maintain peace and order in this colony, and secure substantial and equa!  
liberty to the people.’

‘‘For as much as all the endeavors of the  
United Colonies, by the most decent representa-  
tions and petitions to the King and Parliament of  
Great Britain to restore peace and security to  
America under the British government, and a  
reunion with that people upon just and liberal  
terms, instead of a redress of grievances, have  
produced, from an imperious and vindictive ad-  
ministration, increased insult, and oppression, and  
  
  
  
a vigorous attempt to effect our total destruction.  
By a late act, all these colonies are declared to be  
in rebellion, and out of the protection of the Bri-  
tish crown, our properties subjected to confisca-  
tion, our people, when captured, compelled to  
join in the murder and plunder of their relatives  
and countrymen, and all former rapine and op-  
pression of Americans declared legal and just.  
Fleets and armies are raised, and the aid of foreign  
troops engaged toassist these destructive purposes.  
The king’s representative in this colony hath not  
only withheld all the powers of government from  
operating for our safety, but, having retired on  
board an armed ship, is carrying on a piratical  
and savage war against us, tempting our slaves, by  
every artifice, to resort to them, and training and  
employing them against ‘their masters. In this  
state of extreme danger, we have no alternative  
left but an abject submission to the will of these  
overbearing tyrants or a total separation from the  
crown and government of Great Britain, uniting  
and exerting the strength of all America for de-  
fence, and forming alliances with foreign powers  
for commerce and in war: Wherefore, appealing  
to the SEARCHER OF Hearts for the sincerity of  
former declarations, expressing our desire to pursue  
the connexion with that nation, and that we are  
driven from that inclination by their wicked coun-  
cils, and the eternal laws of self-preservation,  
&quot; Resolved, unanimously, That the delegates ap-  
pointed to represent this colony in General Con-  
gress be instructed to propose to that respect-  
able body to declare the United Colonies free and  
independent States, absolved from all allegiance  
to or dependence upon the crown or Parliament  
of Great Britain; and that they give the assent of  
the colony to such a declaration, and to whatever  
measures may be thought proper and necessary by  
the Congress for forming foreign alliances, and a  
confederation of the colonies, at such time and in  
the manner as to them shall seem best. Provided,  
that the power of forming government for and the  
regulation of the internal concerns of each colony  
be left to the respective colonial legislatures.  
  
Resolved, unanimously, That a committee be  
appointed to prepare a DECLARATION OF RIGHTS,  
and such a plan of Government as will be most  
likely to maintain peace and order in this colony,  
and to secure substantial and equal liberty to the  
people.’’

Colonies ; the King’s proclamation declaring them to be out of the  
protection of the Crown; and that there was no alternative but  
abject submission or a total separation. ‘The first resolution was as  
follows :  
  
‘*That the delegates appointed to represent this colony in  
the General Congress be instructed to propose to that respectable  
body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States,  
absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the crown or  
parliament of Great Britain, and that they give the assent of this  
colony to such declaration, and to whatever measures may be  
thought proper and necessary by the Congress for forming foreign  
alliances, and a confederation of the colonies, at such time and in  
the manner as to them shall seem best; Provided, the power of  
forming government for, and the regulations of the internal con-  
cerns of each colony, be left to the respective colonial legislatures.’”*
