August 28th. 1830.  
  
  
  
I have duly received your letter in which you refer to the &quot;nullifying doctrine&quot; advocated, as a  
Constitutional right, by some of our distinguished fellow citizens; and to the proceedings of the Virginia Legislature in  
-98 &amp; 99, as appealed to in behalf of that doctrine; and you express a wish for my ideas on those subjects.  
I am aware of the delicacy of the task in some respects, and the difficulty in every respect of doing full  
justice to it. But having in more than one instance complied with a like request from other friendly quarters, I do not  
decline a sketch of the views which I have been led to take of the doctrine in question, as well as some others connected  
with them; and of the grounds from which it appears, that the proceedings of Virginia have been misconceived by those who  
have appealed to them. In order to understand the true character of the Constitution of the United States, the error, not  
uncommon, must be avoided, of viewing it through the medium, either of a Consolidated Government, or of a Confederated  
Government, whilst it is neither the one nor the other; but a mixture of both. And having in no model, the similitudes and  
analogies applicable to other systems of Government, it must more than any other, be its own interpreter according to its  
text and the facts of the case.  
From these it will be seen, that the characteristic peculiarities of the Constitution are 1. the mode of its  
formation. 2. the division of the supreme powers of Government between the States in their united capacity, and the States  
in their Individual capacities.  
1. It was formed not by the Governments of the component States, as the Federal Government for which it was  
substituted, was formed: Nor was it formed by a majority of the people of the United States, as a single community, in the  
manner of a consolidated government.  
It was formed by the States, that is by the people in each of the States, acting in their highest sovereign  
capacity; and formed consequently by the same authority which formed the State Constitutions.  
Being thus derived from the same source as the Constitutions of the States, it has, within each State; the  
same authority as the Constitution of the State; and is as much a Constitution, in the strict sense of the term, within  
its prescribed sphere, as the Constitutions of the States are, within their respective spheres: But with this obvious and  
essential difference, that being a compact among the States in their highest sovereign capacity, and constituting the  
people thereof one people for certain purposes, it cannot be altered or annulled at the will of the States individually,  
as the Constitution of a State may be at its individual will.  
2. And that it divides the Supreme powers of Government, between the Government of the United States, and the  
Governments of the Individual States, is stamped on the face of the Instrument; the powers of war and of taxation, of  
commerce and of treaties, and other enumerated powers vested in the government of the United States, being of as high and  
sovereign a character, as any of powers reserved to the State Governments.  
Nor is the Government of the United States, created by the Constitution, less a Government in the strict  
sense of the term, within the sphere of its powers, than the Governments created by the Constitutions of the States are,  
within their several spheres. It is like them organized into a legislative Executive and Judiciary Departments. It  
operates like them, directly on persons and things And like them, it has at command a physical force for executing the  
powers committed to it. The concurrent operation, in certain cases, is one of the features marking the peculiarity of the  
system.  
Between these different Constitutional governments, the one operating in all the States, the others operating  
separately in each, with the aggregate powers of government divided between them, it could not escape attention, that  
controversies would arise concerning the boundaries of jurisdiction; and that some provision ought to be made for such  
occurrences. A political system that does not provide for a peaceable and authoritative termination of occurring  
controversies, would not be more than the shadow of a Government; the object and end of a real government being, the  
substitution of law and order, for uncertainty confusion and violence.  
That to have left a final decision, in such cases, to each of the States, then thirteen, and already twenty  
four, could not fail to make the Constitution and laws of the United States different in different States, was obvious;  
and not less obvious, that this diversity of independent decisions, must altogether distract the Government of the Union,  
and speedily put an end to the Union itself. A uniform authority of the laws, is in itself a vital principle. Some of the  
most important laws could not be partially executed. They must be executed in all the States or they could be duly  
executed in none. An impost or an excise, for example, if not in force in some States, would be defeated in others. It is  
well known that this was among the lessons of experience, which had a primary influence in bringing about the existing  
Constitution. A loss of its general authority would moreover revive the exasperating questions between the States holding  
ports for foreign commerce and the adjoining States without them; to which are now added, all the inland States,  
necessarily carrying on their foreign commerce thro’ other States.  
To have made the decisions under the authority of the Individual States, co-ordinate, in all cases, with  
decisions under the authority of the United States, would unavoidably produce collisions incompatible with the peace of  
society, and with that regular and efficient administration, which is of the essence of free governments. Scenes could not  
be avoided, in which a Ministerial officer of the United States and the correspondent officer of an individual State,  
would have rencounters in executing conflicting decrees; the result of which would depend on the comparative force of the  
local posse attending them; and that, a casualty depending on the political opinions and party feelings in different  
States.  
To have referred every clashing decision, under the two authorities, for a final decision to the States as  
parties to the Constitution, would be attended with delays, with inconveniences, and with expences, amounting to a  
prohibition of the expedient; not to mention its tendency to impair the salutary veneration for a system requiring such  
frequent interpositions, nor the delicate questions which might present themselves as to the form of stating the appeal,  
and as to the Quorum for deciding it.  
To have trusted to negociation for adjusting disputes between the Government of the United States and the  
State Governments, as between Independent and separate Sovereignties, would have lost sight altogether of a Constitution  
and Government for the Union; and opened a direct road from a failure of that resort, to the ultima ratio between nations  
wholly independent of and alien to each other. If the idea had its origin in the process of adjustment, between separate  
branches of the same Government, the analogy entirely fails. In the case of disputes between independent parts of the same  
Government, neither part being able to consummate its will, nor the Government to proceed without a concurrence of the  
parts, necessity brings about an accommodation. In disputes between a State Government, and the Government of the United  
States, the case is practically as well as theoretically different; each party possessing all the departments of an  
organized government, legislative, executive, and judiciary; and having each, a physical force to support its pretensions.  
Although the issue of negociation might sometimes avoid this extremity, how often would it happen among so many States,  
that an unaccommodating spirit in some would render that resource unavailing? A contrary supposition would not accord with  
a knowledge of human nature or the evidence of our own political history.  
The Constitution not relying on any of the preceding modifications, for its safe and successful operation,  
has expressly declared, on one hand 1. &quot;that the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made  
under the authority of the United States, shall be the Supreme law of the land; 2. that the Judges of every State shall be  
bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution and laws of any State, to the contrary notwithstanding; 3. that the Judicial  
power of the United States shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the  
United States, and treaties made under their authority &amp;ca.&quot;  
On the other hand, as a security of the rights and powers of the States, in their individual capacities,  
against an undue preponderance of the powers granted to the Government over them in their united capacity, the  
Constitution has relied on 1. the responsibility of the Senators and Representatives in the Legislature of the United  
States to the Legislatures and people of the States. 2. the responsibility of the President to the people of the United  
States; and 3. the liability of the Executive and judiciary functionaries of the United States to impeachment by the  
Representatives of the people of the States, in one branch of the Legislature of the United States, and trial by the  
Representatives of the States, in the other branch: the State functionaries, Legislative Executive, and Judiciary, being  
at the same time, in their appointment and responsibility, altogether independent of the agency or authority of the United  
States.  
How far this structure of the Government of the United States be adequate and safe for its objects, time  
alone can absolutely determine. Experience seems to have shewn that whatever may grow out of future stages of our national  
career, there is, as yet a sufficient controul, in the popular will, over the Executive and Legislative Departments of the  
Government. When the Alien and Sedition laws were passed in contravention of the opinions and feelings of the community,  
the first elections that ensued, put an end to them. And whatever may have been the character of other acts, in the  
judgment of many of us, it is but true, that they have generally accorded with the views of a majority of the States and  
of the people. At the present day it seems well understood, that the laws which have created most dissatisfaction, have  
had a like sanction without doors; and that whether continued varied or repealed, a like proof will be given of the  
sympathy and responsibility of the Representative body, to the Constituent body. Indeed the great complaint now is,  
against the results of this sympathy and responsibility in the Legislative policy of the nation.  
With respect to the Judicial power of the United States, and the authority of the Supreme Court in relation  
to the boundary of Jurisdiction between the Federal and the State Governments, I may be permitted to refer to the XXXIX  
number of the &quot;Federalist&quot; for the light in which the subject was regarded by its writer, at the period when the  
Constitution was depending; and it is believed, that the same was the prevailing view then taken of it, that the same view  
has continued to prevail, and that it does so at this time, notwithstanding the eminent exceptions to it.  
But it is perfectly consistent with the concession of this power to the Supreme Court, in cases falling  
within the course of its functions, to maintain that the power has not always been rightly exercised. To say nothing of  
the period, happily a short one, when Judges in their Seats, did not abstain from intemperate and party harangues, equally  
at variance with their duty and their dignity; there have been occasional decisions from the Bench, which have incurred  
serious and extensive disapprobation. Still it would seem, that, with but few exceptions, the course of the Judiciary has  
been hitherto sustained by the predominant sense of the Nation.  
Those who have denied or doubted the supremacy of the Judicial power of the United States, and denounce at  
the same time a nullifying power in a State, seem not to have sufficiently adverted to the utter inefficiency of a  
supremacy in a law of the land, without a supremacy in the exposition and execution of the law; nor to the destruction of  
all equipoise between the Federal Government and the State Governments if, whilst the Functionaries of the Federal  
Government are directly or indirectly elected by and responsible to the States, and the Functionaries of the States are in  
their appointment and responsibility wholly independent of the United States, no constitutional controul of any sort  
belonged to the United States over the States. Under such an organization, it is evident that it would be in the power of  
the States, individually, to pass unauthorised laws, and to carry them into compleat effect, anything in the Constitution  
and laws of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding. This would be a nullifying power in its plenary character;  
and whether it had its final effect, thro’ the Legislative Executive or Judiciary organ of the State, would be equally  
fatal to the constituted relation between the two Governments.  
Should the provisions of the Constitution as here reviewed, be found not to secure the Government and rights  
of the States, against usurpations and abuses on the part of the United States, the final resort within the purview of the  
Constitution, lies in an amendment of the Constitution according to a process applicable by the States.  
And in the event of a failure of every Constitutional resort, and an accumulation of usurpations and abuses,  
rendering passive obedience and non-resistance a greater evil, than resistance and revolution, there can remain but one  
resort, the last of all; an appeal from the cancelled obligations of the Constitional compact, to original rights and the  
law of self preservation. This is the ultima ratio under all Goverments, whether consolidated, confederated, or a compound  
of both; and it cannot be doubted that a single member of the Union, in the extremity supposed, but in that only, would  
have a right, as an extra and ultra constitutional right, to make the appeal.  
This brings us to the expedient lately advanced, which claims for a single State, a right to appeal against  
an exercise of power by the Government of the United States decided by the State to be unconstitutional, to the parties to  
the Constitutional compact; the decision of the State to have the effect of nullifying the act of the Government of the  
United States, unless the decision of the States be reversed by three fourths of the parties.  
The distinguished names and high authorities which appear to have assented and given a practical scope to  
this doctrine, entitle it to a respect which it might be difficult otherwise to feel for it.  
If the doctrine were to be understood as requiring the three fourths of the States to sustain, instead of  
that proportion, to reverse the decision of the appealing State, the decision to be without effect during the appeal, it  
would be sufficient to remark, that this extra constitutional course might well give way, to that marked out by the  
Constitution, which authorises two thirds of the States to institute, and three fourths to effectuate, an amendment of the  
Constitution establishing a permanent rule of the highest authority, in place of an irregular precedent of construction  
only.  
But it is understood that the nullifying doctrine imports that the decision of the State is to be presumed  
valid, and that it overrules the law of the United States, unless overruled by three fourths of the States.  
Can more be necessary to demonstrate the inadmissibility of such a doctrine, than that it puts it in the  
power of the smallest fraction over one fourth of the United States, that is, of seven states out of twenty four, to give  
the law, and even the Constitution to seventeen States; each of the seventeen having as parties to the Constitution, an  
equal right with each of the seven, to expound it, and to insist on the exposition. That the seven might, in particular  
instances be right, and the seventeen wrong, is more than possible. But to establish a positive and permanent rule giving  
such a power, to such a minority, over such a majority, would overturn the first principle of free government, and in  
practice necessarily overturn the government itself.  
It is to be recollected that the Constitution was proposed to the people of the States as a whole, and unanimously adopted by the States as a whole, it being  
a part of the Constitution that not less than three fourths of the States should be competent to make any alteration in  
what had been unanimously agreed to. So great is the caution on this point, that in two cases where peculiar interests  
were at stake, a proportion even of three fourths are distrusted, and unanimity required to make an alteration.  
When the Constitution was adopted as a whole, it is certain that there are many parts which, if separately  
proposed, would have been promptly rejected. It is far from impossible, that every part of a Constitution might be  
rejected by a majority, and yet taken together as a whole, be unanimously accepted. Free Constitutions will rarely if ever  
be formed, without reciprocal concessions; without articles conditioned on and balancing each other. Is there a  
Constitution of a single State out of the twenty four, that would bear the experiment of having its component parts  
submitted to the people and separately decided on?  
What the fate of the Constitution of the United States would be if a small proportion of the States could  
expunge parts of it particularly valued by a large majority, can have but one answer.  
The difficulty is not removed by limiting the doctrine to cases of construction. How many cases of that sort,  
involving cardinal provisions of the Constitution, have occurred? How many now exist? How many may hereafter spring up?  
How many might be ingeniously created, if entitled to the privilege of a decision in the mode proposed?  
Is it certain that the principle of that mode would not reach further than is contemplated. If a single State  
can of right require three fourths of its co-states to overrule its exposition of the Constitution, because that  
proportion is authorised to amend it, would the plea be less plausible that, as the Constitution was unanimously  
established, it ought to be unanimously expounded?  
The reply to all such suggestions seems to be unavoidable and irresistible; that the Constitution is a  
compact, that its text is to be expounded according to the provisions for expounding it– making a part of the compact; and  
that none of the parties can rightfully renounce the expounding provision more than any other part. When such a right  
accrues, as may accrue, it must grow out of abuses of the compact, releasing the sufferers from their fealty to it.  
In favor of the nullifying claim for the States, individually, it appears as you observe that the proceedings  
of the Legislature of Virginia in 98 &amp; 99 against the Alien and Sedition Acts, are much dwelt upon.  
It may often happen, as experience proves, that erroneous constructions not anticipated, may not be  
sufficiently guarded against, in the language used; and it is due to the distinguished individuals who have misconceived  
the intention of those proceedings, to suppose that the meaning of the Legislature, though well comprehended at the time,  
may not now be obvious to those unacquainted with the cotemporary indications and impressions.  
But it is believed that by keeping in view the distinction between the Governments of the States, and the  
States in the sense in which they were parties to the Constitution; between the rights of the parties, in their  
concurrent, and in their individual capacities; between the several modes and objects of interposition against the abuses  
of power; and especially between interpositions within the purview of the Constitution, and interpositions appealing from  
the Constitution to the rights of nature paramount to all Constitutions; with these distinctions kept in view, and an  
attention, always of explanatory use, to the views and arguments, which were combated, a confidence is felt, that the  
Resolutions of Virginia as vindicated in the Report on them, will be found entitled to an exposition, shewing a  
consistency in their parts, and an inconsistency of the whole with the doctrine under consideration.  
That the Legislature could not have intended to sanction such a doctrine, is to be inferred from the debates  
in the House of Delegates, and from the address of the two Houses, to their Constituents, on the subject of the  
Resolutions. The tenor of the debates, which were ably conducted and are understood to have been revised for the press by  
most if not all of the speakers, discloses no reference whatever to a constitutional right in an individual State, to  
arrest by force the operation of a law of the United States. Concert among the States for redress against the Alien and  
Sedition laws, as acts of usurped power, was a leading sentiment; and the attainment of a concert, the immediate object of  
the course adopted by the Legislature, which was that of inviting the other States &quot;to concur,  
in declaring the acts to be unconstitutional, and to co-operate by the necessary and proper  
measures, in maintaining unimpaired the authorities rights and liberties reserved to the States respectively and to the  
people&quot;.* That by the necessary and proper measures to be concurrently and co-operatively taken, were meant measures known to the Constitution, particularly the ordinary  
controul of the people and Legislatures of the States, over the Government of the United States, cannot be doubted; and  
the interposition of this controul, as the event shewed, was equal to the occasion.  
* see the concluding Resolution of -98.It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the intentions of the Legislature, that the words &quot;not law, but  
utterly null, void, and of no force or effect&quot; which had followed, in one of the Resolutions, the word &quot;unconstitutional&quot;,  
were struck out by common consent. Tho’ the words were in fact but synonomous with &quot;unconstitutional&quot;; yet to guard  
against a misunderstanding of this phrase as more than declaratory of opinion, the word unconstitutional, alone was  
retained, as not liable to that danger.  
  
The published Address of the Legislature to the people their Constituents affords another conclusive evidence  
of its views. The address warns them against the encroaching spirit of the General Government, argues the  
unconstitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Acts, points to other instances in which the constitutional limits had been  
overleaped; dwells on the dangerous mode of deriving power by implication; and in general presses the necessity of  
watching over the consolidating tendency of the Federal policy. But nothing is said that can be understood to look to  
means of maintaining the rights of the States, beyond the regular ones, within the forms of the Constitution.  
If any further lights on the subject could be needed, a very strong one is reflected in the answers to the  
Resolutions, by the States which protested against them. The main objection of these, beyond a few general complaints of  
the inflammatory tendency of the Resolutions, was directed against the assumed authority of a State Legislature to declare  
a law of the United States unconstitutional, which they pronounced an unwarrantable interference with the exclusive  
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. Had the Resolutions been regarded as avowing and maintaining a  
right, in an individual State, to arrest by force the execution of a law of the United States, it must be presumed that it  
would have been a conspicuous object of their denunciation. With cordial salutations

States, then thirteen, and already twenty-four, could not fail to  
make the Constitution and laws of the United States different in  
different States, was obvious; and not less obvious, that this diver-  
sity of independent decisions, must altogether distract the Govern-  
ment of the Union, and speedily put an end to the Union itself.  
A uniform authority of the laws, is in itself a vital principle.  
Some of the most mes ee laws could not be partially executed.  
They must be executed in all the States, or they could be duly  
executed in none. An wonton or an excise, for example, if not in  
force in some States, would be defeated in others. It is well  
known that this was among the lessons of experience, which had  
a primary influence in bringing about the existing Constitution.  
A loss of its general authority would moreover revive the exaspe-  
rating questions between the States holding ports for foreign com-  
merce, and the adjoining States without them; to which are now  
added, all the inland States, necessarily carrying on their foreign  
commerce through other States.  
  
‘To have made the decisions under the authority of the indi-  
vidual States, co-ordinate, in all cases, with decisions under the  
authority of the United States, would unavoidably produce col-  
lisions incompatible with the peace of society, and with that regu-  
lar and efficient administration, which is of ‘the essence of free  
governments. Scenes could not be avoided, in which a ministe-  
rial officer of the United States, and the correspondent officer of an  
individual State, would have rencounters in executing conflicting  
decrees ; the result of which would depend on the comparative  
force of the local posses attending them; and that, a casualty de-  
pending on the political opinions and party feelings in different  
States.  
  
‘’T’o have referred every clashing decision, under the two author-  
ities, for a final decision, to the States as parties to the Constitu-  
tion, would be attended with delays, with inconveniences, and  
with expenses, amounting to a prohibition of the expedient ; not  
to mention its tendency to impair the salutary veneration for a sys-  
tem requiring such frequent interpositions, nor the delicate ques-  
tions which might present themselves as to the form of stating the  
appeal, and as to the quorum for deciding it.  
  
‘&#x27;To have trusted to negotiation for adjusting disputes between  
the Government of the United States and the State Governments,  
as between independent and separate sovereignties, would have  
lost sight altogether of a Constitution and Government for the  
Union; and opened a direct road from a failure of that resort, to  
the ultima ratio between nations wholly independent of and alien  
to each other. If the idea had its origin in the process of adjust-  
ment, between separate branches of ‘the same Government, the

analogy entirely fails. In the case of disputes between indepen-  
dent parts of the same Government, neither part being able to con-  
summate its will, nor the Government to proceed without a con-  
currence of the parts, necessity brings about an accommodation.  
In disputes between a State Government, and the Government of  
the United States, the case is practically as well as theoretically  
different ; each party possessing all the departments of an organ-  
ized Government, Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary ; and hav-  
ing each a phy sical force to support its pretensions. Although the  
issue of negotiation might sometimes avoid this extremity, how  
often would it happen among so many States, that an unaccommo-  
dating spirit in some would render that resource unavailing? A  
contrary supposition would not accord with a knowledge of human  
nature, or the evidence of our own political history.  
  
“The Constitution, not relying on any of the preceding modifi-  
cations, for its safe ‘and successful operation, has expressly de-  
clared on theone hand, I, ‘‘ that the Constitution, and the laws made  
in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made under the authority of  
the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; 2, that  
the Judges of every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the  
Constitution and laws of any State, to the contrary notwithstand-  
ing; 3, that the judicial power of the United States shall extend  
to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the  
laws of the United States, and treaties made under their author-  
ity, &amp;c.”  
  
‘On the other hand, as a security of the rights and powers of  
the States, in their individual capacities, against an undue pre-  
ponderance of the powers granted to the Government over them in  
their united capacity, the Constitution has relied on, 1, the respon-  
sibility of the Senators and Representatives in the Legislature of  
ce United States to the Legislatures and people of the States ;  
  
, the responsibility of the President to the people of the United  
ec and 3, the liability of the Executive and Judicial fune-  
tionaries of the United States to impeachment by the Representa-  
tives of the people of the States, in one branch of the Legislature  
of the United States, and trial by the Representatives of the  
States, in the other branch: the State functionaries, Legislative,  
Executive, and Judicial, being, at the same time, in their ap-  
pointment and responsibility, altogether independent of the agency  
or authority of the United States.  
  
‘ How far this structure of the Government of the United States  
is adequate and safe for its objects, time alone can absolutely de-  
termine. Experience seems to have shewn, that whatever may  
grow out of future stages of our national career, there is, as yet, a  
sufficient control, in the popular will, over the Executive and Le-

gislative Departments of the Government. When the Alien and  
Sedition Laws were passed in contravention to the opinions and  
feelings of the community, the first elections that ensued put an  
end to them. And whatever may have been the character of  
other acts, in the judgment of many of us, it is but true, that they  
have generally accorded with the views of a majority of the States  
and of the people. At the present day it seems well understood,  
that the laws which have created most dissatisfaction, have had a  
like sanction without doors; and that, whether continued, varied,  
or repealed, a Jike proof will be given of the sympathy and respon-  
sibility of the Representative body, to the constituent body. In-  
deed, the great complaint now is, against the results of this sym-  
pathy and responsibility in the Legislative policy of the nation.  
  
With respect to the judicial power of the United States, and the  
authority of the Supreme Court in relation to the boundary of juris-  
diction between the Federal and the State Governments, | may be  
permitted to refer to the thirty-ninth number of the “ Federalist,’’*  
for the light in which the subject was regarded by its writer, at  
the period when the Constitution was depending ; and it is be-  
lieved, that the same was the prevailing view then taken of it, that  
the same view has continued to prey vail, and that it does so at this  
time, notwithstanding the eminent exceptions to it.  
  
‘ But it is perfectly consistent with the concession of this power  
to the Supreme Court, in cases falling within the course of its  
functions, to maintain that the power has not always been rightly  
exercised. To say nothing of the period, happily a short one,  
when Judges in their seats did not abstain from intemperate and  
party harangues , equally at variance with their duty and their dig-  
nity ; there ‘have been occasional decisions from the bench, which  
have incurred serious and extensive disapprobation. — Still it would  
seem, that, with but few exceptions, the course of the Judiciary  
has been hitherto sustained by the predominant sense of the na-  
tion.

cial power of the United States, and denounce at the same time a  
nullifying power in a State, seem not to have sufficiently adverted  
to the utter inefficiency of a supremacy in a law of the land, with-  
out 2 supremacy in the exposition and execution of the law ; ; hor  
to the destruction of all equipoise between the federal Govern-  
ment and the State Governments, if, whilst the functionaries of  
the Federal Government are directly or indirectly elected by and  
responsible to the States, and the functionaries of the States are in  
their appointment and responsibility wholly independent of the  
United States, no constitutional control of any sort belonged to the  
United States over the States. Under such an organization, it is  
evident that it would be in the power of the States, individually,  
to pass unauthorized laws, and to carry them into complete effect,  
  
any thing in the Constitution and laws of the United States to the  
contrary notwithstanding. ‘This would be a nullifying power in its  
plenary character ; and whether it had its final effect, through the  
Legislative, Executive, or Judiciary organ of the State, would be  
equally fatal to the constituted relation between the two Govern-  
ments.  
  
‘Should the provisions of the Constitution as here reviewed, be  
found not to secure the Government and rights of the States,  
against usurpations and abuses on the part of the United States,  
the final resort within the purview of the Constitution, lies in an  
amendment of the Constitution, according to a precess applicable  
by the States.  
  
‘ And in the event of a fhilure of every constitutional resort, and  
an accumulation of usurpations and abuses, rendering passive obe-  
dience and non-resistance a greater evil, than resistance and revo-  
lution, there can remain but one resort, the last of all; an appeal  
from the cancelled obligations of the constitutional compact, to  
original rights and the law of self-preservation. &quot;This is the ultima  
ratio under all Governments, whether consolidated, confederated,  
or a compound of both: and it cannot be doubte d, that a single  
member of the Union, in the extremity supposed, but in that only,  
would have a right, as an extra and ultra-constitutional right, to  
make the appeal.  
  
‘This brings us to the expedient lately advanced, which claims  
for a single State a right to appeal against an exercise of power  
by the Government of the United States decided by the State to  
be unconstitutional, to the parties to the constitutional compact :  
the decision of the State to have the effect of nullifying the act  
of the Government of the United States, unless the decision of  
the State be reversed by three fourths of the parties.  
  
The distinguished names and high authorities which appear to  
have asserted and given a practical scope to this doctrine, entitle  
it to a respect which it might be difficult otherwise to feel for it.

‘If the doctrine were to be understood as requiring the three  
fourths of the States to sustain, instead of that proportion to re-  
verse the decision of the appealing State, the decision to be  
without effect during the appeal, it would be sufficient to remark,  
that this extra-constitutional course might well give way to that  
marked out by the Constitution, which authorizes two thirds of  
the States to institute and three fourths to eflectuate an amend-  
ment of the Constitution, establishing a permanent rule of the  
highest authority, in place of an irregular precedent of con-  
struction only.  
  
‘ But it is understood that the nullifying doctrine imports that  
the decision of the State is to be presumed valid, and that it  
overrules the law of the United States, unless ov erruled by three  
fourths of the States.  
  
‘Can more be necessary to demonstrate the imadmissibility of  
such a doctrine, than that it puts it in the power of the smallest  
fraction over one fourth of the United States, that is, of seven  
States out of twenty four, to give the law and even the Constitu-  
tion to seventeen States, each of the seventeen having as parties  
to the Constitution, an equal right with each of the seven, to ex-  
pound it, and to insist on the e xposition ? ‘That the seven ‘might,  
in particular instances be right, and the seventeen wrong, is  
more than possible. But to establish a positive and permanent  
rule giving such a power, to such a minority, over such a major-  
ity, would overturn the first principle of free government, and in  
practice necessarily overturn the Government itself.  
  
‘It is to be recollected that the Constitution was proposed to  
the people of the States as a whole, and unanimously adopted by  
the States as a whole, it being a part of the Constitution that not  
less than three fourths of the States should be competent to  
make any alteration in what had been unanimously agreed to.  
So great is the caution on this point, that in two cases where  
peculiar interests were at stake, a proportion even of three  
fourths is distrusted, and unanimity required to make an alter-  
ation.  
  
When the Constitution was adopted as a whole, it is certain  
that there were many parts, which, if separately proposed, would  
have been promptly rejected. It is far from impossible, that  
every part of a Constitution might be rejected by a majority, and  
yet taken together as a whole be unanimously accepted. Free  
Constitutions will rarely if ever be formed, without reciprocal  
concessions ; without articles conditioned on and balancing each  
other. Is there a Constitution of a single State out of the  
twenty-four that would bear the experiment of having its compo-  
nent parts submitted te the people and separately decided on ?

‘What the fate of the Constitution of the United States would  
be if a small proportion of the States could expunge parts of it  
particularly valued by a large majority, can have but one answer.  
  
‘ The difficulty is not removed by limiting the doctrine to cases  
of construction. How many cases of that sort, involving cardi-  
nal provisions of the Constitution, have occurred? How many  
now exist?) How many may hereafter spring up? How many  
might be ingeniously created, if entitled to the privilege of a de-  
cision in the mode proposed !  
  
‘Is it certain that the principle of that mode would not reach  
further than is contemplated. If a single State can of right re-  
quire three fourths of its co-States to overrule its exposition of  
the Constitution, because that proportion is authorized to amend  
it, would the plea be less plausible that, as the Constitution was  
unanimously established, it ought to be unanimously expounded ?  
  
‘The reply to all such suggestions seems to be unavoidable and  
irresistible ; that the Constitution is a compact, that its text is to  
be expounded according to the provisions for expounding it—  
making a part of the compact ; and that none of the parties can  
rightfully renounce the expounding provision more than any  
other part. When such a right accrues, as may accrue, it must  
grow out of abuses of the compact releasing the sufferers from  
their fealty to it.  
  
‘In favor of the nullifying claim for the States, individually, it  
appears, as you observe, that the proceedings of the Legislature  
of Virginia, in ’98 and ’99, against the Alien and Sedition Acts,  
are much dwelt upon.  
  
‘It may often happen, as experience proves, that erroneous  
constructions not anticipated, may not be sufficiently guarded  
against, in the language used ; and it is due to the distinguished  
individuals, who have misconceived the intention of those pro-  
ceedings, to suppose that the meaning of the Legislature, though  
well comprehended at the time, may not now be obvious to those  
unacquainted with the contemporary indications and impressions.  
  
‘But it is believed that by keeping in view the distinction be-  
tween the Governments of the States, and the States in the sense  
in which they were parties to the Constitution; between the  
rights of the parties, in their concurrent and in their individual  
capacities ; between the several modes and objects of interposi-  
tion against the abuses of power, and especially between inter-  
positions within the purview of the Constitution, and interposi-  
tions appealing from the Constitution to the rights of nature  
paramount to all Constitutions; with an attention, always of ex-  
planatory use, to the views and arguments which were combated,  
the Resolutions of Virginia, as vindicated in the Report on

them, will be found entitled to an exposition, showing a consist-  
ency in their parts, and an inconsistency of the whole with the  
doctrine under consideration.  
  
‘That the Legislature could not have intended to sanction  
such a doctrine, is to be inferred from the debates in the House  
of Delegates, and from the address of the two Houses to their  
constituents, on the subject of the Resolutions. ‘The tenor of  
the debates, which were ably conducted and are understood to  
have been revised for the press by most, if not all, of the speak-  
ers, discloses no reference whatever to a constitutional right in  
an individual State, to arrest by force the operation of a law of  
the United States. Concert among the States for redress against  
the Alien and Sedition Laws, as acts of usurped power, was a  
leading sentiment; and the attainment of a concert, the imme-  
diate object of the course adopted by the Legislature, which was  
that of inviting the other States “‘ to concur, in declaring the acts  
to be unconstitutional, and to co-operate by the necessary and  
proper measures in maintaining unimpaired the authorities,  
rights and liberties reserved to the States respectively and to the  
people.”* ‘That by the necessary and proper measures to be  
concurrently and co-operatively taken, were meant measures  
known to the Constitution, particularly the ordinary control of  
the people and Legislatures of the States, over the Government  
of the United States, cannot be doubted ; and the interposition  
of this control, as the event showed, was equal to the occasion.  
  
‘It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the intentions of  
the Legislature, that the words ‘ not law, but utterly null, void  
and of no force or effect,’ which had followed, in one of the  
Resolutions, the word ‘ unconstitutional,’ were struck out by  
common consent. ‘Though the words were in fact but synony-  
mous with ‘‘ unconstitutional ;’ yet to guard against a misunder-  
standing of this phrase as more than declaratory of opinion, the  
word ‘ unconstitutional’ alone was retained, as not liable to that  
danger.  
  
‘&#x27;The published Address of the Legislature to the people,  
their constituents, affords another conclusive evidence of its  
views. ‘The Address warns them against the encroaching spirit  
of the General Government, argues the unconstitutionality of the  
Alien and Sedition Acts, points to other instances in which the  
constitutional limits had been overleaped ; dwells upon the dan-  
gerous mode of deriving power by implication ; and in general  
presses the necessity of watching over the consolidating ten-  
dency of the Federal policy. But nothing is said that can be

understood to look to means of maintaining the rights of the  
States, beyond the regular ones, within the forms of the Consti-  
tution.  
  
‘If any further lights on the subject could be needed, a very  
strong one is reflected in the answers to the Resolutions, by the  
States which protested against them. ‘he main objection of  
these, beyond a few general complaints of the inflammatory ten-  
dency of the Resolutions, was directed against the assumed  
authority of a State Legislature to declare a law of the United  
States unconstitutional, “which they pronounced an unwarranta-  
ble interference with the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme  
Court of the United States. Had the Resolutions been regarded  
as avowing and maintaining aright, in an individual State, to

Dear Sir,—I have duly rifeivotl your Inner, in

ideas on these subjects.  
1 am aware ot itic delicacy of the ask in «om« res­

lusliro to it. But, h tvirig, in more than one ins nnce,

of viewing it through the mod.tun, either of a conso­

From these it will be seen tint the clurac er s ic  
peculiarities of the Constituiion are. 1, the mope ot

ed in others. Tt is well known that this was ninont*

‘ MoNTPELIER, A&#x27;:rn. 1530.  
* Dear Sir-~lhave duly recei our letter,  
in whiclxou refer to the “nullifying doctrine”  
advocated, as a constitutional mght, bm‘  
of our distinguished fellow ci‘.bt»uJ to the &#x27;  
proceedings of the Virginia h”’ob o 8  
and &quot;OV, as appealed to in belix that doc-l  
trine; and you expressa wish for my ideas on |  
those subjects. . -  
‘I am aware of the delicacy of the task in \
some respects, and the difficulty in every re­  
spect, of doing full justice to it.” But, having,  
in more than one umtuneo.complio&amp; with a  
like request frqm other friendly quarters, | do  
not decline a sketch of the views which |  
have been led to take of the doctrine in ques.  
tion, as well as some others connected with  
them; and of the grounds from whieh it ap­  
pesrs, that the proceedings of Virginia have  
heen misconceived by those who have appeal.  
ed to themn In order to understand the true  
character of the Constitution of the United  
States, the error, not uncommon, must be a­  
‘voided, of viewing it throngh the medium, ei­  
‘ther of a consolidated Govermnent, or of a  
confederated Government, whilstit is neither  
ane nor the other; but a mixture ofboth. And  
having, in no model, the similitude and analo­  
gies applicable to othar systems of Twern­  
ment, it must, more than any other, be its own  
interpre er sccording to its text and the fucts  
of the case.  
* From these it will bo seen that the charac.  
terestic peculiaritios of the Constitution are,  
1, the mode of its formation; 2, the division of  
the snpreme powers of governmant between  
the States in their united capacity, and the  
States in their individual capaciti  
1. It was formed, not by the (l&#x27;:termmnt­  
of the component States, as the Federal Gov.  
ernmoent for which it was substituted was  
formod. Nor was it formed by a majority of  
&#x27; the people of the United States, as a single  
community, in the manner of a consolidated  
| Government,  
  
‘lt was formed bﬁ the States, that is, bythe  
people in each of the States, acting in their  
highest sovereign eapacity; and formed conse­  
r‘uontly by the same authority which fermed  
the State Constitutions,  
* Being thus derived from the same source  
as the (!omtitulimu of the States, it has,  
within each State, the same autherity as the  
Constitution of the State; and is a 8 much a  
Constitution, in the strict sense of the term,  
within ite prescribed sphare, a 9 Yha cons!iu­  
tions of the States are, within their respoctive  
spheres : but with this obvions and essential  
difference, that being a compact ainong the  
Staites in their highest sovercign eapaeity,  
and constituting the peopls thereol one peo­  
ple for certain purposes, it eannnot be altered  
or annulled at the will of the States individu­  
ally, as the constitution of a State may be at  
its individual will.  
  
“2. And that it divides the supreme powers  
of Government, batween the Government of  
the United States, and the Governments of  
the individual States, is stamped on the face  
of the instrnment; the powers of war and of  
taxation,of commerce and of treaties, and oth­  
er enuinerated powers vestod in the Govern  
ment of the United States, being of as high  
and soveraign a character, as any of the pow  
ers resorved 1o the State Governments.  
  
¢ Nor is the Government of the U. States, |  
created by the constitution, lnss a Govern­  
ment in tho strict sense of the term, wilhinl  
the sphere of its nowers, than the Govern.  
ments created by the constitutions of the  
Statos are, within their sevetal sphores It is  
like them organized into Legisistive, Execu­  
tive, and Jndiciary departments. [t aperates,  
like them, directlyy on persons and things  
Aud, like them, it has at command a physical 1  
force for executing the powers committed to  
it The toncurrent operation in certain cases, ‘  
is one of the features marking the peculiarity  
of tho system. l  
‘ Between these different constitutional Go.  
vernments, the one operating inallthe States,  
the others operating separately in each, with  
the nggre.f‘n!e powers of Government divided  
between them, it could not eseape attention,  
that eontroversies would arise concerning the  
houndaries of jurisdiction; and that some pro.  
vision ought to be made for such ncenrrences.  
A political system that does net provide for a  
peaceabls and puthoritative tefmination of nc.  
curring contraversies, would not be more than  
the shadow of a Government; the object and  
‘end of a real Government being, the substitu.  
‘tion of law and order, for uncertainty, confu­  
‘sion and violence.  
“That to have left a final Beision, in such  
‘cases, to each of the States, thes thirteen, and  
already twenty four, could not fil to make  
‘the constitution and the laws of the U. Btates  
different in different States, was obvious ; and  
  
not less obvious, that thisdiversity of indepen- |  
dent decisions, must altogether dist act thel  
Government of the Union, and speedily put |  
an end te the Union itself. A uniform au.  
thority of the laws, is in iteslla vital principle. |  
Some of the most important laws eould not be |  
partially executed. They must be exocuted  
in all the States, or they eould be duly exeen­  
ted in none. An impost, or an excise, for ex- I  
ample, if not in force in some States, would be  
doleud in others. It is well known that this  
was among the lessons of experience, which  
had a primary influence in bringing about the  
existing constitution A loss of its general  
authority would moreover revive the exaspe­  
rating questions between the States holding  
rts for foreign commerce, and the adjoining  
E.um without them; to which age now sdd«f. ‘  
all the inland States, mnry. earrying on  
their foreign commerce through other States.  
* To have made the decisions under the au­  
thority of the individual Buates, co-ordinate,  
in all cases, with decisions under the authority  
of the United States, would unaveijably pro­  
duce collisions incompatible with the peace of  
society, and with that rzvlu and offieiont ad­  
ministration, which s of the essence of free  
governments. Bcenes could notbaavoided, in  
&#x27;whish &amp; ministerial officer of the U. 8, aad  
  
‘the correspondent officer of an individual  
State, would bave rencounfers in ox»cmins  
conflicting degrees; the result of which woul  
depend on the comparative force of the loeal  
posses attending them; and that, a casualty  
depending on tgo political opinions and parly  
feelings in different States.  
To have referred every clashing decis­  
ion, under the two authorities, for a final  
decision, to the States as parties to the  
Constitation, would be attended with ae­  
lays, with inconveniences, and with expen  
ses, amounting to a prohibition of the ex.  
pedient; not to mention its tendency to im  
pair the lllullt{ veneration for a system  
requiring such frequent interpositions, nor  
the delicate questions which might present  
themselves as to the form of stating the ap.  
peal, and as to the quorum for deciding it  
To have trusted to negocistion for ad  
Justing disputes between the Government  
of the United States and the State Govern.  
ments, as between indcx\endem and sepa.  
rate sovereignties,would have lost sightal­  
togethor of a constitution and government  
for the Union; and opened a direct road  
from a failure of that resort, to the wiima  
ralio between nations wholly independent  
of and alien to each other. ¥flbc idea had  
its origin in the process of adjustment, be.  
tween separate branches of the same Gov­  
erament, the analogy entirely fails. Inthe  
case of disputes between independent parts  
of the same Government, neither part be.  
ing able to consummate its will, nor the  
Government to proceed witheut a concur­  
rence of the parts, necessity brings about  
an accommodation. In disputes between  
a State Government, and the Government  
of the United States, the case is practicslly  
as well as theoreticnlz’y different; each par­  
ty possessing all the departments of an or­  
grnized Government, Lafialltnvo, lixecu.  
tive, and Judiciary; and having each a  
physical force to support its pretensions.  
Although the issue of negociation might  
sometimes avoid this extremity, how o&amp;en |  
would it happen among so many States,  
that an unaccommodating epirit in some |  
would render that resourze unavailing? A |  
oontnr{ supposition would not accord with |  
o knowledge of human nature, or the evi­  
dence of our own political history,  
The constitution, not relying on any of  
the preceding modifications, for its safe and  
successful operation, has exproasly declar |  
ed, on the one hand, 1, “‘that the constitu­  
tion, and the laws made in pursuance  
thereof, and all tresties made under the  
authority of the &quot;&#x27;nited States, shall be the  
supreme law of the land; 2, that the Judges  
of every State shiuil be bound thereby, any  
thing in the constitution and laws of an  
State, to the contrary notwithstanding; :{ |  
that the judicial power of the United States  
shall extend to all casos in law and equity |  
arising under the constitution, the laws of  
the United States, and treaties made under  
their wlbogy, &amp;e”  
On the other hand, as a seeurity of the  
rights and powers of the States, in their in­  
dividual capacities, against an udue prepon­  
derance of the powers granted to the Gov  
ernment over them in their united capacity,  
the constitution has relied on, I, the re­  
spongibility of the Senators and Represen:  
tatives in the Legislature of the United  
States to the Legislatures and people of  
the States; 2, the responsibility of the Pres­  
ident to the people of the United States;  
and 3, the liability of the Executive and ju­  
dicial functionaries of the United States to  
impeachment by the Representatives of the  
people of the States, in cne branch of‘the‘  
Legislature of the United States, and trial |  
by the Represcotatives of the States, in the |  
other branch: the State functionaries, Leg­  
islative, Fixecutive, and Judicial, being, at  
the same time, in their appointment and  
responsibility, altogether independent of  
the ungency or authority of the United  
States, p  
  
flow far this structure of the Gavern­  
ment of the UnitedsStates is adequate and  
safe for its objects, time alone can absolute.  
ly determine, Experience seems to have  
shewn, that whatever may grow out of fu.  
ture stages of our national carcer, there is,  
ae yet, a sufficient control in the popular  
will, over the Executive and Legisiative  
Departments of the Government, When  
the Alien and Sedition lews were passed in  
contravention to the opiniens and feelings  
of the community the first elections that  
‘ensued put an end to them, And whatey.  
er inny rmn- been the character of other  
lncto. in the judgement of many of vs, it is  
but true, that t|l¢¥ have generally accorded  
| with the views of a majority of the States  
and of the people. At the present day it  
seems well understood, that the laws which  
have created most dissatisfaction, have had  
&#x27;a like sanction without doors; and that  
  
whether continned, varied, or repesled, a  
like proof will be given of the sympathy  
and responsibility of the Representative  
body, to the constituent body. Indeed, the  
great complaint now is, against the results  
of this sympathy and responsibility in the  
Legislative policy of the nation,  
With respect to the judicial power of the  
United States, and the lulhoritg of the Su­  
preme Court in relation to the boundary of  
jurisdiction between the Federal and the  
State Governments, [ may be permitted to

stbject was regnided by its writer, at the  
period when the Constitution was deponds  
ing;and it is believed, that the same was  
the prevailing view then taken of it,that the  
same view has continued to prevail, and  
that it does so ut this time, notwithstanding  
the eminent exceptions to it,  
But it is perfectly consistent with the  
concession of this power to the Supreme  
Court, in cases falling within the course of  
its functions, to maintain that the power has  
not always been tighl&#x27;ljv exercised. To  
say nothins of the period, happily a shord  
one, when Judges in their scats did not  
abstain from intemperate and parly ha­  
rangnes, equally at variance with their du­  
ty and their dignit‘y; there have been occa«  
sional decisions from the bench, which  
have incurred serious and extensive disap­  
probation, Still it would seem, that, with  
but faew exceptions, the course of the Ju­  
diciary has been hitherto sustained by the  
predominant sense of the nation,  
* Those who have denied or doubted the sus  
romacy of the judicial power of the United  
gmu. and denounce at the same time a nul.  
lifying power in a State, scem not to have  
sutliciently adverted to the utter inefliciency  
of a supremacy in a law of the land, without  
a supremacy in the exposition and exeeution  
of the law ; nor to thoe destruction of all egui­  
poise between the Federal Government and  
the State Governments, if, whilst the funce  
tionaries of the Faderal Government are di«  
roctly or indirectly elected by and responsibla  
to the States, and the functionaries of&#x27; the  
‘ States are in their appointment and responsis  
bility whoelly lndopem?:nt of the U. States, no  
constitutional control of any sort belonged to  
the United States over the States. {Jndor  
such an organization, it is evident that it  
would be in the power of the States individu­  
ally, to pass unauthorised laws, and to carry  
them into complete offoct, any thing in the  
constitation and the laws of the U. gtntoo to  
the contrary notwithstanding. This would be  
a nullifying power in ite plenary charactor ;  
and whether it had its final effect, through the  
Legislative, Executive, or Judiciary organ of  
the State, would be equally fatal to the con­  
stituted relation between thes two Govern-  
L ments,  
  
* Bhould the provisions of the constitution  
as hore reviewed, be found not to secure the  
Government and rights of the States uﬁ‘ulnot  
uml;rnlinm and abuses on the part of the U­  
nited States the final resort within the pnr­  
view of the Constitution, lies in an amend=  
ment of the Constitution, according to a pro=  
cess applicable by the States  
‘An(r in the event uf a failure of every  
constitutional resort, and an accumulation  
of usurpations and abuses, rendering pas­  
sive obedience &amp; non resistance a greater  
evil, than resistance and revolution, there  
can remain but one resort, the last of all;  
an appeal from the cancelled obligations o&quot;  
the constitutional eompact, to original  
rights and the law of self-preservation.  
T?nil is the wltima ratio under all Govern­  
ments, whether consolidated, confoderated,  
or a compound of both; and it cannot be  
doubted, that asingle member of the Union,  
in the extremity supposed, but in thatonly,  
would have a right, as an extra and ultra­  
‘constitutional right, to make the lrpon‘,.  
~ This brings us to the expedient lately ad.,  
vanced, which claims for nsingle State  
right to n;a)otl against an exercise of pow­  
er by the Government of the United States  
decided by the State to be unconstitutional  
to the parties to the constitutional compact;  
the decision of the State to have the effecs  
of nollifying the act of the Government of  
the United States,unless the decision of the  
State be reversed by three fourths of the  
!parl_ics. S st  
  
~ T&#x27;he distinguished names and high au­  
thorities which appear to have asserted and  
given a practical scope to this doctrine, en­  
title it to a respect which it might ‘)o diffi­  
cult otherwise to feel for it.  
‘lfthe doctrine were to bo understood ag  
requiring the three fourths of the State to  
sustain,instead of that proportion to reverse  
the decision to the appealing State, the de­  
cision to be without effect Juring the ap­  
peal, it would be sufficient to remark, that  
this extra constitntional eourse might well  
give way to that marked out by the Consti­  
tution, which authorizes two thirds of the  
States to institute and three fourths to ef­  
factuate an amendment of the Constitution,

But it 18 understood that the nullifying  
doctrine imports that the decision olytb.  
State is to be presumed valid, and that it  
overrules the law of the United States, un  
less overruled by three fourthe of the  
Stetes,  
  
Can more be necessary to demonsirate  
the inadmissibility of such a doctrine, than  
that it puts it in tie power of the smallest  
fraction over one fourth of the United  
BStates, that is, of seven States out of twen­  
ty four, to give the law and even the con­  
stitution to seventeen States, each of the  
sevonteen having as parties to the consti­  
tution, an equal right with each of the seve  
en, to expound it, and to insist on the ex.  
‘position? That the seven m(ifht. in par­  
ticular instances be right, and the seven­  
teen wrong, is more than possiblo. Butto  
establish a positive and permanent rule  
giving such a power, to such a minority,  
over such a mn}ority, would overturn tho  
firet principle of free government, and in  
practice neccessarily overtura the Govern­  
ment iteelf.  
It is to be recollected tha¢™the eonstitu­  
tion was proposed to the people of the  
States as a whole, and vnanimeusly adopt.  
ed by the States as a whole, it being a part  
of the constitution that not less than three  
fourths of the States should be competent  
to make any alteration in what had been  
unanimously agreed to. So great is the  
caution on this point, that in two cases  
where poculiu interosts were at stake, a  
proportion even of three fourths is distrust­  
ed, and unanimity required to make an al­  
teration.

qsarts, which, if separately proposed, would |  
have been promptly rejected. [tis far from  
impossible, thgt every part of a constitution |  
might bo re{&quot;ected by a majority, and yet  
taken togethar as a whole be unanimously |  
ucceptod‘. Free constitutions will rarely  
if ever be formed, withont reciprocal con*  
cesgions; without articles conditioned on!  
and balancing each other. Isthere a Con- |  
stitution of a single State out of the tweunty  
tour that would bear the experiment of hav.  
ing its component parts submitted to the  
pcwlo and separately decided on ? »  
hat the fate of the constitution of the  
United States would be if a small propor­  
tion of the States could expunge parts of it  
particularly valued by a large majority,can  
have but one answer, t  
The difficulty is not removed by limiting  
the doctrine to cascs of construction. How  
nany cases of that sort, involving cardinal |  
provisions of the constitution, have occur- f  
red? How many now exist? How many  
may hereafter spring up? How many  
might be ingeniously created, if entitled to  
the privilege of a decision in the mode  
proposed ? &#x27;  
Is 1t certain that the principle of that  
mode would not resch further than is con- |  
templated. Ifa single State can of right  
require three fourths of its co States to o­  
verrule its exposition of the constitution,  
because that proportion is authorized to a­  
mend it, would the plea be less plausible’  
that, as the constitution was unanimously  
established, it ought to be unanimously ex  
pounded ?  
The reply to all such suggestions secms  
to be unavoidable and irresistible ; that the  
constitution is a compact, that s text is  
to be expounded according to the provi­  
sions for expounding it—making a part of  
the compict : and that none of the parties  
can rightfully renounce the expounding  
provision more than any other part. When  
such a right accrues, as may accrue, it  
must grow out of abuses of the compact re  
leasing the sufferers from their fealty to it.  
fo favor of the nullifying elnim for the  
States, individually, it appears, as you ob­  
serve, that the procecdings of the Legis­  
lature of Virginia, in &#x27;OB, and in *O9, against  
the Ahen and Sedition Acts, are much  
dwelt upon,  
It may often happen, as experience  
proves, that erroneous counstructions not  
anticipated, may not be sufliciently goard  
ed against, in lf;o language used ; and it is  
due to the distinguished individuals, who  
have misconceived the intention of those  
proceedings, to suppose that the meaning  
of the Legislature, though well comwre  
hended atthe time, may net now be obvious  
to those unacquainted with the contempo  
rary indications and impressions.  
l{nl it ia believed that by kecping in view  
the distinction between the Governments  
of the States, and the States in the sensc  
in which thay were parties to the constitu  
tion; between the rights of the parties, in  
their concurrent and in theirindividual ea­  
pacities; between the several modes and  
objects of interposition ngainst the abuses  
of power, and especially between interposi  
tions within the purview ol the constitution,  
~and interpositions appealing from the con  
stitution to the rights of nature paramouint  
to all constitutions ; with an attention, ol  
ways of explanatory 0 e to the views and  
argumenta which are combated, the Reso  
lutions of Virzinin, as vindicated in the Re  
port on them, will be found eatitled to an  
exposition, showing a consistency in their  
parts, and an incunsistency of the whole  
with the doetrine under consideration.  
That the Leeisiature conld not have in  
tended to sanction such a doetrine.is tobe  
inferred from the debates in the House of  
Delegates, and from the address of the two  
flonses to their constituents, on the sub  
ject of the Resolutions. The tenor of the  
debates, which were ably conducted and  
are understood to have been revised for  
the press by most, ifnot all, of the speakers, |  
l]ii(,&quot;l).ﬂ.‘ﬂ no I&#x27;(&quot;&#x27;l‘N‘lH&#x27;.L&#x27; whateyver to a con- 1  
stitutional right of an individual State, to  
arrest by force the operation of a law of  
the United States. Concert among the  
States for redress against the Alien and  
Sodition Laws, as acts of usurped power,  
was n leading sentiment; and the attain­  
ment of a concert, the inmediate object of  
the course adopted by the Legislature,  
which was that of inviting the other States  
“to concwr, in declaring the aects to be an­  
constitutional, and to co operate by the nec­  
esaary and proper measures in maintaining  
unimpaired the authorities, rights and lib­  
erties regerved to the States respoctively  
and to the people.™ That by the necessa.  
ry and proper measures to be concurrently  
and co operatively taken, were meant meas­  
ures known to the constitution, particular­  
ly the ordinary control of the people and  
Lerislatures of the States,over the Govern­  
ment of the United States, cannot be doubt­  
ed; and the interposition of this control, as  
the event showed, was equal to the occa­  
sion,  
It is worthy of remark, and explanatory  
of the inteations of the Legislature, that  
the words “not law, but utterly null, void  
and of no force or effuct,” which had fol­  
lowed, in one of the Resolutions, the word  
sunconstitutional,” were atrnck out by com  
mon consent. Though the words were in  
fact but synonymeus with “uncoenstitution­  
aly’ yet to guard against a misunderstana­  
ing of this phrase as more than .(eclnutory  
of opinion, the word “unconstitutional”  
alone was retained, as not liable to that  
danger.  
The published Adlress of the Legisla­  
ture to the people, their constituents.aflords  
another cunclusive evidence of its views,  
The Address warns themn against the en  
croaching spirit of the General Govern  
ment, argues the unconstitutionality of he  
Alien and Sedition Acts, points to other  
instances in which the constitutional limits  
had been overieaped ; dwells upon the dan  
gerous mode of deriving power by implica  
tion; and in general presses the necessity  
of watching over the consolidating tenden­  
cy of the Mederal policy. Bnt aothing 1  
said that can be understood to look to  
means of maintaining the rights of the  
States, beyond the rcguhr ones, within the  
forms of the constitution.  
I any further lights on the subject could  
be n“XuI. a very strong one is reflected in  
the answers to the Resolutions, by the  
States which protested against them, Thw  
mainobjection of these,beyond a few gener­  
al complaints of the intlummatory tendency  
fthe ;eloluuonr,f\‘.&#x27;ss dirested agained the  
  
nssumed authority of a State Legislature to  
declare a law of the United States tmcol-‘  
stitutional, which they pronounced an un­  
warrantable interference with the exclusive |  
Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the U -  
nited States. Had the Resolutions been re­  
garded as avowing and maintaining a right;  
in an individoal State, to arrest, by gorce. the  
execution of a law of the United States, it  
“must be presumed that it would have heen  
‘a conspicuons object of their denuncistion,  
‘ With cordial salutations, &#x27;

ttqrfrpKi.iER, August, 18JO.  
* Dc&#x27;.t Sir,—I have duly received your letter, m  
Which you refetto the “nullifying doctrine.” advoca­  
ted a?, a i (institutional rigf.t,&#x27; by some of our distin­  
jeoi^hed fellow-citizens; and to the proceedings of ihe  
Virginia Legislature in’9U ‘90, as appeal&#x27;d to mbe-j  
halt of that doctrine; and you express a wish for my j&#x27;  
ideas on those subjects.  
i am aware of the delicacy of the task in some res­  
pects, and .tbo difficulty in every respect, of doing full  
jastice to it. But, hiving, in more than one instance, (  
Complied with a like request from other friendly quur- (  
ters, I do not decline a sketch of the views which I  
hpve bean led to take of tho doctrine in question, as J  
Well as soino’othors connected with them; and of the  
£roundl from which it appears, that the proceedings &#x27;  
of Virginia have been misconceived by those who 1  
have appealed to them, la order to understand the  
txua character of t&amp;o Constitution of the United !  
Qfatos, the error, uot uncommon, must bo uvoided, i  
Of viewing it through tho medium, either of a conso­  
lidated Government, or of a confederated Govern­  
ipent, wbilsi.it is neither tho one nor the other; hut o  
mixture of both. And having, in no model, tho si­  
militudes and analogies applicable to other systems of  
Government, it must, more than any tuber, bo its own  
interpreter according to its text and the facts of the  
&lt;3tso.  
Prom these it will be seen that the characteristic  
pjjcaliaritics of the Constitution ore, 1, the mode of  
U&amp; formation; 2, the division of the supreme1 powers  
of Government between the Stutes in their united  
capacity, and the States m their lcdividaal on paci­  
fies.  
I. It wos formed, not by the Governments of the  
component States, us the Uederal Government for  
which it was substituted was formed. Nor was it  
formed by a majority of the people of tho United  
(states, as a single community in the maimer of a  
Chneolidstud Government.  
&quot; It was formed by t.io Stales, that is by tho people  
ill each of the States, acting in their highest sove­  
reign capacity; and formed consequently by the  
same ambority • which formed the State constitu­  
tions. .  
Being thus derived from the same source as the  
chnstitutions of the States; it has, withjg each State,  
the same authority as the constitution of the State;  
and is as much a constitution, in the 6tnct sense of  
tho term, within its prescribed sphere, as the consti  
lotions of the States are, within their respective  
spheres; bat with ifusobviods and essential diCbrcnce,  
♦fiat being a compact among the States in their high­  
est sovereign capacity, and constituting tho people  
thereof ono people for certain purposes, it cannot bo  
tittered or annulled at the will of tho States indivi­  
dually, as tho constitution of a State may he at its in  
uividanl will.  
  
S* And that it divides the anprcrao powers of Gov  
Cfrnment, between the Government of the United  
•States, and the Governments of the individual States,  
i5 stamped on the face of the instrument; the powers  
of war and of taxation, of commerce and of treaties,  
and other enumerated powers vested in the Govern­  
ment of tho Uaited States, being of as high and sove­  
reign a character, 03 any cf the powers reserved to  
the State Governments.  
Nor is the Government of the United States, crea­  
ted by the constitution, less a Government in the  
strict sense of the term, within the spfiere of its  
powers, than tb&#x27;* Governments created by the consti­  
tutions ot the States are, within their several spheres  
It is like them organized into Legislative, Executive,  
trad Judiciary Departments. It operates like them,  
directly on persons and things. And, like them, it  
has at confimnd a physical torco for executing the  
powers committed to it. Tho concurrent operation  
ih certain cases, is one of the features marking the  
peculiarity of the system.  
BotVreen these d fiWent constitutional governments,  
the one operating in all the states, the others opera­  
ting separately in each. With the aggregate powers of  
gpvenuneut divided between them, it could not cs  
&lt;2ipi? attention, that controversies would arise con­  
OCTuing the boundaries of jurisdiction; and shat some  
provision ought to bo made for such occurrences. A  
political sybtam that does not provide for a peaceable  
and authoritative termination of occuring omfrover­  
Qi«3, would not bo moro than tbe&#x27;shadow of a gov­  
tjrnnjont, the object and end of a real government  
faring tho snbstitntioo of law nod order for uncertain­  
ty. confusion and violence.  
That to have left a final decision, to such oases, to  
C&amp;ch of the elates, then thirteen, and already twenty  
Oor, could not fail to anko the constitution and laws  
cf tho Duited States different in different states, was.  
Obvious; and not leas obvioas, that tins diversity oT  
independent decisions, most altogether distract the&#x27;  
governtDcot of tho Union, and speedily pnr an end to ‘  
the Union itself A nniform authority of the laws, is.  
£il itself a vital principle. Sonjo of the most impor-f  
Aat laws coold not bo partially executed. They most  
ho executed in all tho status, or they could be duly&quot;  
tucecoied in none. An impost, or an exciso, for ex  
ample, if not in force in come states, would b* defeat­  
ed ir, others. It is well known tbut this was arann™  
tho lessons of experience, which bad a primary influ­  
ence in bringing aboot the existing constitution. A  
loss of its general authority Would moreovor revive&#x27;&#x27;  
file exasperating questions be#, wean the states holdim*!  
ports f&gt;r forcigu commerce?, and tho adjoining states  
without them; to which are now added all the inland •  
sftates, uecessarily carrying on tboir foreign commerce1 i  
  
Tjirougu omur BiarcB.

tho individual states, co-ordinate, in nil cases, with  
flcrtrtsioiw under tho authority of the United States&#x27;,  
xyon.d unavoidably produco collisions incompatible  
with the peace of society, and with that regular and  
efficient administration which is ot tho evsenco of free  
governmonta Scones could not bo avoided, in which  
A oiioistorial officer of tho United Stntes, and ibo cor­  
respondent officer of an individual state, would have

Bnlt of which would depend on tho comparative force  
of tho local posse attending them; tujdtbat, a casu  
itl.y depending on tho political opinions and party  
fetrings in diuoreot stores.

Tha not rc’yingcn any ^ n„. i  
  
*  
-ruling modifications, tbr iia sale aiul sueee&amp;afui i  
pperatioo, Jias expressly declared, on the one hand, t  
1 .“That the&quot; constitution, Ond the laws made in 1  
pdrsuanee thereof, and ail treaties made under the &lt;  
author: y of the United States, snail be the supreme I  
law *»f th»* land; 2, that the Jydges of every State i  
shall be bound thereby, any thing m the Constitution &lt;  
and laws of any State to the contrary notwilhst&amp;&#x27;iid- i  
ing; 3, that the judicial power of the United Slates ,  
dial! extend to all cases in law and equity arising  
under die Constitution, the laws of the United Stales,  
ind treaties made under their authority,&quot; &amp;c  
On the other hand, as a security of the rights and  
lowers of the States, in their individual capacities,  
(gainst an undue preponderance of the powers grant  
ju to the government over them in their united ca­  
pacity, the constituteni has relied on, 1, the respon­  
sibility of the senators uud representatives in the  
Lioapslaturo of the United States to the Legislatures  
inu the people of the Slates; 2, &lt;he responsibility of  
:he President to the people of the United States;  
md 3, the liability of the executive and judicial  
functionaries of the United States to impeachment  
fry the representatives of the people of the States,  
in one branch of the Legislature of United  
Slates, and trial by the Representatives of the  
States, m the other branch: the State functionaries,  
legislative, executive end judic.al, being at the  
same time, in their appointment and responsiblity,  
altogether mdependent of tho ugoncy or authiority  
ofthe United States.  
Wow fur this structure of tho Government of the  
United Slates is adequate and safe for i*s objects,  
time alone can absolutely determine. Experience  
seems to have shewn, that whatever may grow out  
offatu&#x27;re stages of our national career, theid is, as  
yet, a sufficient control in the popular will, over the  
Executive ami Legislative Departments ofthe Gov­  
ernment. When the Alinu and Sedition Laws wer»*  
parsed in contravention to the opinions and feelings  
of the community, tho first elections that ensued put  
an end to them. Aod whatever may have been the  
character of other acts, in tho judgment of many  
of us, it is but true, that they have generally accorded  
with the views of a majority of the States and the  
people. At the present day it 6cems well under  
stood, that the laws winch have created most dissat­  
isfaction, have had a like sanction without doors; and  
that whether continued, varied, or repealed, a like  
proof will he given of the sympathy and ruspoosib.lit v  
of tho representative body to the constituent body.  
Indeed, the great complaint n« w is, against the re­  
sults of this sympathy and responsibility in the legis­  
lative policy of the nation.  
  
wun respect to tnc judicial power of &#x27;ho United  
States, and the authority of tho Supreme Court in  
relation to the boundary of jurisdiction between  
tbe Federal and the State Governments, I may be  
dermitted to refer ro the thirty ninth number of &#x27;he  
“Federalist,”* for the flight in which the subject  
was regarded by its writer, at. the period when the  
Constitution was depending: and it is believed, that  
the same was the prevailing view then taken of it,  
that the same view has continued to prevail, and  
that it does so at this time, notwithstanding thg  
eminent exceptions to it.  
But it is perfectly consistent with the concession  
of this power to tho Supreme Court, in cases fall  
ing within the course of its- functions, to maintain  
that the power has not always been rightly ex»r—  
oised. To say nothing of the period, happily a short  
one, when Judges in their scats did not^ abstain  
from intemperate and party harangues, equally at  
variance with their duty and their dignity, there have  
been occasional decisions (rani the bench, which  
have incurred serious and extensive disapprobation.  
Still ir. would seem, that., with but lew exceptions,  
tho course of tha Judiciary has bern hitherto s s­  
tained by tho predominant sense of the nation  
Those who fv:ve denied or doubted the suprema  
cy of the Judicial power of the Untied States, und de­  
nounce at tho same time n nullifying power m a  
i f3fate,seem not to nave sufficiently adverted trr the  
; utter inefficiency of a supremacy ip a law oftiie land,  
without a supremacy in tli»j exposition and execution  
of the law: nor to the destruction of all equipoise  
between the Federal Government and tbe State  
Governments, if, whilst he functionaries of the Fed­  
eral Government n»o directly or indirectly elected  
by, and responsible to tho States, and the function­  
aries of the States are in thoi ppointment and  
responsibility wholly independent of tho United  
States, no constitutional control of any sort belonged  
to tbe United States. Under such an orgunizu ion,  
it is evident that it would bo in the power of the  
StntCB, individually, to pass unauthorized laws, and  
to carry ih&#x27;-tn into comploto effect, any thing in  
the Constitution and laws of tho United States m  
the contrary notwithstanding This would be a  
nullifytngpower in its plenary character; and wheth­  
er it h?d its final effect, through the Legislative,  
Executive, or Judiciary organ&#x27;of the State, would  
he equally fatal to tho constituted relation between  
the two Governments.  
Should the provisions of the Constitution as here  
reviewed bo found not to secure the government and  
r&#x27;gh&#x27;s of the States against usurpations and abuses  
on the part of the United S&#x27;ates, the final resort  
within the purview of the Constitution lies in an  
amendment of the Constitution, according to a pro­  
cess applicable by the States.  
And in tho even1 of the failure of every constitu­  
•tonal resort, and an accumulation of usurpations and  
lbuses, rendering passive obedience and non-reuis­  
ance a greater evil than resistance and revolution.  
:hcro can remain but one resort, the last of aU-^-an  
tppeal from the cancelled obligation:; of the compact,  
:o original rights and the law of self-preservation.  
Fliis is the tilt/uia ratio under ail govern men -s,  
whether consolidated, confederated, or a compound  
both; and it cannot be doubted that « single mem­  
ber ol tho Union, in tho extremity supposed, but in  
dial only, would have a right, as an extra and ufra­  
Jonstitiitiona! right, to make tho appeal.  
This brings ns to theT expedient lately advanced,&#x27;  
Which claims for a single State a right to appeal I  
against an exercise of power by tlie government of  
the United States, decided by the State to be uncon­  
btitulional, to the parties to tho cons&#x27; itulionnl compact;  
tho decision of tbe State to ixive the cfTeci. of nullify­  
ing tho act of the Government of too United States,  
unless tho decision of the State be reversed by three­  
fourths of the parties.  
  
^1 iic distinguished names and high authorities  
w.iich appear to have nssserted and given a prncticnl  
scope to this dnetrino, entitle it to a respect which  
it might be difficult otherwise to feel for rt.  
If the loctrine wero to be understood ns requiring  
tho three fourths ol tho States to sustain, instead of  
that proportion to reverse the decision of the appeal­  
ing State, the decision to &quot;be wituout effect during  
the appeal, u would be sufficient to remark that this  
extra-constitutional course might well give way to  
that marked out by the.constitution, which authorises  
two-thirds of the States to msiitule and three-four th3  
to effectuate an amendment of the constitution, es­  
ablishtngn permanent rule of the highest autnority,  
n place of an irregular precedent of construction -  
&gt;nly.  
JBut it is understood that the nullifying doctrine  
tnporr? that tlie decision of the State is to ue pre3U  
tied valid, and that it ovorrulcs the low of the United  
3tat^, unless overruled by three-fourths of the  
States.  
Can more be necessary to demonsirale tho inad  
bienibility of such a doctrine, than that it puts it in1  
he power of tlie smallest fraction over one fourth of  
-ho U. States, that, is, of seven Stales out of twenty*  
oor, to givo tho law and even the constitution to se

&#x27;Oiitccn dilutes, each of the seveuieen having&#x27; as uar- .  
irs to the constitution, no equal right with cacn of  
ho sevea, to expound it, nnd to insist on the exposi  
sition? That tho seven might, iii particular instances  
&gt;% right, and the seventeen Wrong, is more than pos­  
uble liut to establish a positive und permanent rule  
jiviug such a power ,.to such a minority, over such a  
nnjoritv, would overturn the first principle of free  
Tovernment, and in practice necessarily overturn tho  
Government itself.  
Is it to be recollected thgi the constitution was  
proposed to the people of the plates us a whole, and  
jnnnunously adopted by t heStatcs as a whole, it be­  
ing b part of the constitution that not less than three  
fourths of the Slates should be competent to make  
any alteration iu what had been unanimously agreed  
to. So great is the caution on this point, that ill two  
cases where peculiar interests were at stuke, a uro­  
portiou even of three fourths is distrusted, und una­  
nimity required to muke an alieration  
When the constitution was adopted as a whole, it  
is certain that there wero many parts, which if sep­  
arately proposed would have been protnp&#x27;ly rejected.  
It is far from impossible, ihat every putt of a consti.  
tution mighfbe rejected by a ina ortty. and yet taken  
together as a whole be unanimously accepted. Free  
constitutions will rarely if ever be foiuied. without  
reciprocal conccssiuns; without articles conditioned  
on and balancing each other. Is there a constitution  
of a single State ont of the twenty four that would  
bear the experiment of having its component parts  
submitted to (lie people und separately decided on?  
What the fate of tho constitution of the United  
Sta&#x27;es would be if a small proportion of the States  
could expunge parts of it paiticularly valued by a  
large majority, can have but one unswer.  
The difficulty 16 not removed by limiting the doc­  
trine to cuses of construction. How many cases of  
that sort, involving cardinal provisions of the consti  
tution, have occurred? How muny now exist?* How  
many may hereafter spring up? IIow many might  
be ingerfionsly created, if entitled to tho privilege of  
a decision in the mode proposed?  
it is certain that the principle of that mode would  
not reach further than is contemplated? If a single  
State can of right require three fourths of its c&lt;*­  
Statee to overrule its exposition of the constitution,  
because that proportion is authorized to amend it,  
would the plea be loss plausible, that, as the consti  
tution was unanimously established, it ought’ to be  
unanimously expounded? ,  
The reply to all sucli suggestions qeems to be un­  
avoidable and irresistible, that tho cons itution is a  
compact, that its text is to be expounded according  
to th*‘ provisions for expounding u—making a par&#x27; of  
jtbe compact; anJ that none of the parties can right­  
fully renounce the expounding provision more than  
any other part. When such a rigiiUneeruc3. as may  
accrue, it must grow out of abuses of the compact  
releasing the sufferers from their fealty to it.  
In favor of the mi&#x27;lfying claim for the States, in  
div^diiully. it appears, as yon observe, that the pro­  
repiliiliT^ of tho I .OfTIpfil II ro of Viririnin in ’QJ! u in!  
  
in &#x27;99, against tne Alien and Sedition Acts, are much  
dwelt upon  
It may often happen, as experience proves, that  
erroneous constructions not anticipated, may not be  
sufficiently guarded against, in tho language used;  
and it is due to the distinguished individuals, who  
have misconceived th- intention of those proceedings,  
to suppose that iho meailing of the Legislature,  
though well comprehendedlpt the time, inay not now  
be obvious to those unucqunated with the conlempo  
rary indications and lnVpresaons  
But it is b-Iieved that by keeping in view the dis­  
tinction between tho goveri meins of th- States and  
the States in the s.-use in witch they were parties to  
the Constitution; between thi rights of the parties in  
their concurrent and in tnelr individual capacities;  
between the several modes dnd objecis of interposi­  
tion against the abuses of prtwer, and especially be  
tween interpositions within |ho purview of the*con­  
stitution, and interpositions appealing from iho con­  
stitution to the rights of nature, paramount to all  
constitutions; with an attenwon, always of e.vpluna  
tory use, to the views end arguments which wero  
combated, tlie Resolutions of Virginia, as vindicated  
in the report on them, will be found entitled to an ex­  
position, shewing a abnsiateucy in their parrs, and on  
| inconsistency of tho whole with tho doctrine under  
j consideration  
That the legislature could not have intended to  
sanction such n doctrine is to be inferred from the  
debates in the House of Delegates, and from the ad  
dress of the two houses to their constituents, on he  
subject of the Resolutions The tenor of t he debates,  
which were ably conducted, and are understood to  
have been revised for the press by most, if not all ot  
the speakers, discloses no reference whatever to a  
constitutional right of an individual State to rrest  
by force the operation of a law of the United States.  
Concert among the.States for redress against the  
Alien and Sedition Laws, as acts of usurped power,  
was a leading sentiment; and the attainment of u  
concert, the immediate object of the course ndopt.-d  
by the legislature, which was that of inviting the  
other States “to concur in declaring the acts to be  
unconstitutional, and to ca-operale by tho necessary  
and proper measures in maintaining unimpaired the  
authorities, rights and liberties reserved o the State*  
respectively and to the people.”* That&#x27;-by the ne­  
cessary and proper measures to be concurrently and  
co-operatively taken, wore meant measuies known tc  
tho Constitution, particularly the ordinary control ol  
the people and legisla’tires of iho States, ovor the  
government of the United States, cannot be doubted;  
and the interposition of this control, as tho event  
shewed. was equal to the occasion.  
It i« worthy of remark, and explanatory of the in­  
tentions of the legislature,that the words ‘&#x27;not law.  
but itfterly null, void and of no force or &lt; which  
hnd followed, in one of th&lt;- Resolutions,the word •un­  
constitutional,” were struck onr by common consent.  
Though the words wer»i in fact but synonymous with  
-unconstitn&#x27;ionul.&#x27;’ yet, io guard against a misunder­  
standing of th&#x27;s phrase as moro than declaratory ol  
opinion, the word -‘unconstitutional” alono was re­  
tained, as not l ahie to that dnnorer  
  
The published Addro-s of &#x27;he Legislator® to the  
people, their constituents, affords another conclnsive  
evidence ot its views. The Address warn.-? them n  
gnmst the encroaching spirit of the General Govern­  
ment. argues the unconstitutionally of the Alien and  
Sedition Acts, points to othc^ instances in winch the  
constitutional limits had been ov»rleaped; dwells up­  
on the dangerous mode of deriving power by implied  
tion; aed in general presses tho necessity of watch  
ing over the consolidating tendency of the Federal  
policy But nothing is said that can ho understood  
to look to means of maintaining the rights of the  
States, beyond tho regular ones, with the forms of the  
Constitution,  
It nnv further lights on the subject could be need­  
ed, a very strong one is reflected in the answers to  
flu* Resolutions, by the States which protested against  
them. The main objection of those, beyond a few  
general complain&#x27;s of tho inflammatory tendency oi  
the Resolutions, was directed ngnins! the assumed au­  
t h^it y of a State Legislature to declare a law of the  
U. States unconstitutional. which thoy pronounced  
an unwarrantable interference with the exclusive jn  
rLdintiofl of the Supreme Court of the Unitod States  
Mfld the resolutions been regarded as avowing and  
maintaining a right, in nn individual state, to arrest,  
by force, the execution of a law of ihe United States  
it must be presumed that it would have been a con  
ppicuous object of their denunciation. With cordin  
snluta tons, - JAMES MADISON

Montpelier, August 1S:5&lt;).  
Dear Sir:—I have duly receiv-d your le&#x27;ter, in  
wlrrh you rvler to tho “ null tying doctrine,” advo­  
cated as a ronstltu&#x27;ional right by some of our distin­  
guished fellow-ci’i/.en*; and to the proceeding* ol the  
t irginia Legislature in ’J)S, and ’911, as appealed to in  
behalt ot that doctrine; and you express a wish tor my  
idea* on those subjects  
I am aware of the delicacy of tho task in seine res­  
pects, and the difficulty in every respect, of doing lull  
justice to It. Hut, having, in more than otic ins nrire,  
compil&#x27;d with a like request from oilier friendly quar­  
ter«, I • not decline a «ke’rli of the views which l hive  
been led to take of the do&#x27;trine in question, a* well a*  
•oiua other* connected with them; and ol the ground*  
from which it nppeir*, that the proceeding* ot Virginia  
have been misconceived by tho«e who have appealed to  
them. In order to understand the true character of  
th» Constitution of the United States, the error, not un­  
common, must be avoided, of viewing it through the  
medium, either of a consolidated Government, or ol a  
confederated Government, whilst it is neither the one  
nor the other; but a mixture ol both. And having, in  
no model, the similitude* and analogies applicable to o  
th*r system* of Govermit&#x27;iit, it must, more than any  
other, bn it* own interpreter according to its text and  
the facta of the case.  
F mm these it will ha seen that the characteristic  
peculiarities ol tho Constitution are, 1, the mode  
ol it* formation; 2, the division of the supreme pow­  
ers of Government between the S’ates iu their unit­  
ed capacity and (ha States in their individual rapacities.  
1. It was formed, not by (lie Government* of the com­  
ponent States, as the Federal Government for which I*  
wss substituted was formed. Nor was it formed by a  
majority of the people ol the United 8:a&#x27;«s, a* a single  
community, in the manner of a consolidated Govern­  
ment. -  
It was formed by the S&#x27;ate*. that is, by the people in  
each of the States, ac&#x27;ing in their highest sovereign ca­  
pacity; and formed consequently by the satiio authority  
which formed the State Constitution.  
Heing thus derived from the same source as the con­  
stitution* of the States, it has, within e .ch State, tho  
same authority a* the constitution of the State; and i* as  
much a constitution, in the strict sen«e of the term,  
within its prescribed sphere, a* the rons&#x27;i&#x27;u&#x27;icns of the  
S ate* are, within their rcspectivo sphere* ; but with  
this obvious and essential difference, that being a com­  
pact among the Sia&#x27;es in their highest sovereign rapa­  
city, tnd constituting (he people thereof one people for  
certain purposes, it cannot he al&#x27;ered or annulled at tho  
will of the States individually, as the constitution of a  
State may he at its individual will.  
2. And that it divi les the supreme powers of Gov­  
ernment, between the Government of the United  
Slates, and the Governments of the individual Slates, i*  
stamped on the face ol the instrument, tin powers of  
war and of taxation, of commerce and of treaties, and  
other enumerated powers vested In the Government of  
’.lie United States, being ot as high and sovereign a  
character, as ary

n o( occurring controversies, would not be  
more titan th* shadow of a Government ; (he object and  
end of a real Government being, tiie substitution of law  
and order, for uncertainty, contusion, and violence.  
1 liat to have left a filial d -cisinn, in such cases, to  
each of die Slates, then thirteen, and already twenty­  
four. could not fail to make tiie constitution and laws ot  
the United States different in different Slates, was ob­  
vious; and not Itss obviou*, that this diversity of inde­  
pendent deci-ion*, must altogether distract the govern­  
ment of tiie Union, and speedily put an end to tiie U­  
nion it-elf. An uniform mithority of tho law*, is in  
itself a vital prinriple. Som- of tiie mod important  
laws could no! he partially executed. They must be  
executed in all the States, or they could be duly exe­  
cuted jn none. An impost, or an excise, for example,  
if not in force in some State*, would lie defeated in o­  
thers. It is well known that (his was among the les­  
sen* of experience, which had a primary influence in  
bringing about tiie existing constitution. A loss of it*  
general authority would moreover revive the exaspera­  
ting questions between the S’ates hold ng ports for fo­  
reign commerce, and the adjoining States without them;  
to which aio now added, all the inland States, necessa  
rily carrying on their foreign commerce through other  
Stales.  
  
I o nave m&amp;(!« (fie &lt;Terii»jon*i un»ier the authority of  
ihe individual Stales, cn-ordi&quot;ate, in all cases, with de­  
cisions under the authority of the United Slates, would  
unavoidably produce co&#x27;lisinn* incompatible with the  
peace of society, and with that regular and efficient ad­  
ministration, which is of the essence of free govern­  
ment*. Scenes could not be avoided, in which a min­  
isterial officer of the United S&#x27;ate», anti the correspon­  
dent officer of an Individual Sta&#x27;e, wnuh! hare rencoun­  
ters in executing conflicting decree*; thp result of which  
would depend on the comparative force of the local pos­  
se* attending them; and that, n casually depending on  
the political opinion* and parly feeling iu difl-rent  
State*.  
To have referred every clashing decision, tinder the  
two authorities, fora final derision, to the S’atesa* par­  
ties to the Constitulion, would he attended with delay-,  
with inconveniences, and with expenses, amounting to  
a prohibition of the expedient; not to mention it« tenden­  
cy to impair the salutary veneration lor a system re­  
quiring such frequent interpositions, nor the delicate  
questions which might present themselves »• to the form  
of slating (he appeal and as lo the quorum for derid­  
ing it.  
To have trusted to nogoeiatlon for adjusting dis­  
pute* between Ihe Government of the United States  
• ft# State Government#, a* between independent and  
separate sovereignties, would have lost eight altoge­  
ther of a constitution and government for the Union;  
and opened a direct road from a failure of that resort,  
to the ultimo mlin between nation* wholly independ­  
ent of and alisn to each other. If the idea had its ori­  
gin in the process of adjustment, between separate bran­  
ches of the same Government, the analogy entirely  
fail*. In Ihe case of di.pites between independent  
parts of the same Government, neither part being able  
to consummate, its wilt, nor the Government to proceed  
without a roncutretire of the parts, necessity brings  
about an accommodation. In disputes h»tw&#x27;fn a State  
Governr tent, and the Government of the United States,  
the case is practically as well a» tlieoretieally different;  
each pirty possessing all the department* of an organ  
ized Government, Legislative, Executive, and Judicia­  
ry; and having curb a physical lorce to support its pre­  
tensions. Although the i**utt of negocialicn might  
sometimes avoid this extremity, how olt-n would it  
happen among so many Slate*, that an unaccommo­  
dating spirit 111 some would render (hat resource una­  
vailing? A contrary supposition would not accord with  
a knowledge of human nature, or the evidence of our  
own political history.  
The constitution, not relying on any of the preceding  
modifications, for it* safe anil successful operation, ha*  
expressly declared, on Ihe one ham), I, •• that Ihe  
constitution, and the laws mads in pursuance thereof,  
and all treaties mate under the authority of the United  
States, shall he the supreme law of the land;. 2, that the  
Judge* of every State shall he hound thereby, any  
thing in the constitution and la tv* ol any state, to th«  
contrary noiwidistan ling; 2, that the judicial poster  
of Ihe United S ate* shall extend lo all ca-e* in law  
and equity arising under the constitution, the laws of  
tli* United States, and treaties in ule under their au­  
thority, kc.

United State* is adequate mi l safe fur it* objects, time a­  
lonn c in absolutely determine. Kxpcrience seems to  
have shewn, that whatever may grow out of future  
• tag** of our national career, tliero i*. a* yet, a sufficient  
control in the popular will, over the Kxecutive and Le­  
gislative Dr pertinents ol the Government. When the  
Ali*n and Sedition laws were pi«*ed in contravention  
to Class opinion and feeling* of tho community the first  
olections that ensued put an end to them. And what­  
ever may have been the character ef other acts, in the  
judgment of many of ns, it is hut true, that they have  
generally accorded with the views of a majority of tho  
States and of the people. At tho present day it seem*  
well understood, that the liwa which have created  
most di**ati*(actioo, have had a like sanction without  
floors; and tha* whether continued, varied, or repealed,  
a like proof will be given of the sympathy and responsi­  
bility of file Representative body, to the constituent bo­  
dy. Indeed, the great complaint now Is, against tha  
results of this sympathy and responsibility in the Legis­  
lative policy of the nation.  
With respect to tha judicial power of Rio United  
States, ami (tie authority of the Supreme Comt in re­  
lation to tiie boundary of jui isifiction between th* Fed­  
eral and tiie State Governments, I may he oerini.tsd to  
refer to the thirty-ninth number of the “ Federalist,’*•  
for the light in which the subject wa* rrgstdod by its  
writer, at th* period when tho Cuns&#x27;i&#x27;.utioii was depend­  
ing; and it i« believed, that the same wa* the prevailing  
view then taken of it, that tho same vie w lias continued  
|o prevail, and that it doe* *o at this time, notwithstand­  
ing &#x27;lie eminent exceptions to it.  
But it is perfectly consistent with the concession of  
thi* power to the Supreme Court, in cases falling wi h­  
in the course of its functions, to main’ain that the pow­  
er has not always been rightly exercised. To say no­  
thing of the period, happi y a short one, when Judge*  
in their seats did not abstain from intemperate and party  
harangues, equally at variance with th-ir duty and  
their dignity, there have hern occasional decisions from  
the bench, which have incurred serious and extensive  
disapprobation. Still it would seem, that, with but few  
exceptions, the courso of tfie Judiciary ha* been hither­  
to sustained by tho predominant sense of the nation.  
1 hose who have denied or doubted the supremacy  
of the judicial power of the Unit&#x27;d Stafos, and denounce  
at tho stme time a nullifying power in a S&#x27;at*. se£m  
not to have sufficiently adverted to the utter inefficien­  
cy of a supremacy in a law of the land, without a su­  
premacy in the expo.ition and execution of th# law;  
nor to the destruction of all equipoise between tha Fed­  
eral Government and the S&#x27;ate Governments, if, whilst  
the functionaries of the Frderal Government are di­  
rectly or indirectly elected hy and responsible to the  
States, and the functionaries of the States are in their  
appointment and responsibility wholly independent of j  
the United S&#x27;ate*, no constitutional control of anv sort  
belonged to the United S ate* over tiie State*. Under  
such an organization, it is evident that it would In in  
the power ot tiie States, individually, to p*s* unauthor­  
i/.ed laws, and to carry ihoin into complete effect, any  
thing in the Constitution and laws of tiie United States  
to the contrary notwithstanding. This would ho a nul­  
lifying power in if* plenary character; ami whether it  
had its final effect, through the Legislative, Execu  
five, or Judiciary organ of th# Slate, would he equally  
fatal to the cons&#x27;ituted relation between tho two Gov­  
ernment*.  
  
anouiii me provisions of (he Con*ti&#x27;n&#x27;ion »« here re­  
\iewed, fie found not to secure the Government end  
right* of the Status, against usurpations and abuses on  
the part of the United States, the tinal resort within the  
purview ol the Constitution, lies in an amendment of  
the Constitution, according to a process applicable liv  
the States. J  
•Andiu the event of a failure of every constitutional  
resort, and an accumulation of usurpations and abuses,  
rendering passive obedience and non-resistance a great­  
er evil, than resistance and revolution, there can re­  
main but one resort, the la*tof all; an appeal from the  
cancelled obligations of the ro atitulional compact, to  
original right* and the law of sell preservation. This is  
the ultima mlio under all Governments, whether con­  
solidated, confederated, or a compound of both; and it  
cannot Ire doubted, that n single member of the Union,  
in the extremity supposed, hut in that only, would have  
a right, as an extra and ultra-comti utional light, to  
make the appeal.  
This brings us to the expedient lately advanced,  
which claim* (or a single Sfa(p a right to appeal ag^inM  
an exercise of power by the Government of (lie Unit,  
ed States derided by the State to he unconstitutional, to  
the parlies to (he constitutional compact; the deei-ion  
of the Siate to have the effect of nullifying the act of  
(lie Government of the United Stales, unless (lie deris­  
ion of tho State be reversed by three-lourth* of the  
pai tics.  
  
I MC u.B.mgmsiied names ami men authorities which  
aupear (o have asserted and given a practical scope to  
•.hi* docttine, entitle it to a respect which il might be  
difficult otherwise to feel for it.  
If the doctrine were lo he understood as requiring  
the three fourths of the Slates to sustain, instead of that  
proportion to reverse the decision oi the appealing State,  
the decision to be without rtfpet during the appeal, it  
would be sufficient to remark, that this exlra constitu­  
tional cour»e might well give way to that marked out by  
the constitution, which authorise* two-thirds of the  
State* to institute am) three fourth* to effectuate an  
amendment ol the constitution, establishing a perma­  
nent rule of (lie highest authority, in place ol an ir­  
regular precedent of con-truction only.  
fhit it i- understood that the nullifying doctrine im­  
ports that the decision ol the State i* to ho presumed  
valid, ami that it overrules the law of the United Slates,  
unless overruled by three fourths of the Stater.  
Can more tie necerary to demonstrate the fnadmiasi­  
bility of such a doctrine, than (hat it puts it in the power  
of the smallest fraction over one fourth of the United  
States, (hat is, of seven State* out of twenty-four, to  
give the law ami even the constitution lo seventeen Slates  
each ol the seventeen having a* parties to the conslilu.  
tion, an equal right with each of the seven, to expound  
it, ami to insist on the exposition ? That the seven  
might, in particular Instance* be right, and the seven-I  
teen wrong, i&lt; more than possible. Hut to establish a  
positive ami permanent rule giving such a power, to  
• uch a minori&#x27;y, over such a majority, would overturn  
the first principle of free government, and in practice,  
necessarily overturn the Government it*elf.  
II is to he recollected that the constitution was pro­  
posed to ibe people ol the Slates a* a fvhole, and unani­  
mously adopted by the Slate* a* n whole, it being * part  
of the constitution that not le*s than three fourths of  
the States should he competent to make any alteration  
in what had been unanimously agreed to. So great is  
the caution on this point, (hat In two case* where p»cu­  
liar interest* were at slake, a proportion even of three  
fourth* i« distrusted, and unanimity required lo make an  
altera’lon.  
&quot; hen the constitution was adopter! *• a whole, it Is  
certain that there were many parts, which, If separate­  
ly proposed, would have h en promptly rejected. It is  
fir from Impossible, that every part of a ronstllu&#x27;lon  
might he rej-cted by a majority, and yet taken togeth­  
er as a whole he itn.uiitno&#x27;i-ly accepted. Fre» constitu­

alter spring up? How many might bo ingeniously  
created, il entitled to tho privilege ol decision in the  
mode proposed ?  
Is it certain that the principle of that inode would  
not reach luither than i# contemplated. It n single

plea be le»* plausible that, ns the constitution w is unani­  
mously established, it ought to be unanimously expound  
ed?  
Tim reply to all such suggestion* seems to be una­  
voidable ami irrebauble ; that the C institution is a rum­  
pact; that its text is in be expounded according to the  
provision* for expounding it—making n pail ot the com­  
pact l »nd that ii&quot;ii« ol the parties can rightfully re­  
nounce the expounding provision more than any o&#x27;her  
pari. M hen such a rigtit accents, as may accrue, it  
must grow out ol abuses ol the compact, releasing the  
sufferer# from their fealty to it.  
In favor of the nullifying claim for tho State*, indi­  
vidually, it appe ir», as you observe, that the proceed­  
ings of the L»gi*latnre ol Virginia, iu *1)8, and in’‘J9.  
against the Alieu and S-rditiou Art*, are much dwelt  
upon.  
Itmayoftan happen, as experience proves, that er­  
roneous construction* not anticipated, may not he suffi­  
riently guarded again*!, in the langu-gn used ; and it i«  
due to tho distinguished individuals, w ho have miscon­  
ceived the intention ot thoso proceedings, to suppose  
that the moaning of the Legislature, though well com­  
prehended at the time, may not non be obvious to thore  
unacquainted with the contempoiary indications and  
lmr&gt;r&lt; aiiou*.  
Hut, it i# believed, that by keeping in view the dis­

An attention, always of explanatory u*e to the views  
; and arguments which were combated, die Resolutions  
o| Virginia, a* vindicated in the report on them, will  
be found entitled to an expoiilion, allowing a consisten­  
cy in their parts, and au inconsistency of tho whole,  
with the doctrine under consideration.  
That the Legiriauire could no&#x27; have intended to sanc­  
tion such a doctrine, is to be inferred from the debate#  
in the I louse ol Delegate*, and Irom the address of tbe  
two House* to their censtiMient*, on the snbj rt of the  
Resolution*. The tenor of the debate*, w hich wer-i  
ably conducted, and are umierstoo I to have been revi*­  
ed tor tlie Press, by most, if not all, of the speakers, dis­  
closes no relere.nco whatever to a constitutional right of  
an individual State, to arrest by force the operation of  
a law of the United Sta&#x27;o*. Concert among the S&#x27;ates  
for redress against the Alien &amp;. Sedition Laws, a* art*of  
usurped pow er.wa* a leading sentiment; &amp; the attainment  
j ol a concert, the immediate object of the course adopted  
by the Legislature, which wa* tliatol inviting tbe other  
States “ to concur, in declaring tbe act* to be uncon­  
stitutional, and to co-operate by tbe necessary ami pro­  
per measures, in maiu&#x27;aining uniinpai.rd the authori­  
ties. right* and libertio*, resetved to the States icipec­  
lively, and to tho people.”* That by the nereysary and  
proper measure* to be concurrently and co-operatively  
taken, were meant measures known to the Const&#x27;iu Ion,  
particularly the ordinary control of the pe -pie «ml L g  
islatures ot the State*, over the Government ol the U.  
nited States, cannot ha doubted ; and the interposition  
of this control, as the event showed, was equal to the  
- occasion.  
  
It ia worthy of remark, oml expl matory of the In­  
tentions of the Legislature, tint tlie words &#x27;• not law,  
but utterly null, void, nnJof no force or • fleet,” which  
had followed in one of tlie Resolutions, the word “ un­  
constitutional,” were struck out by common content.—  
Though tho words we e in fact but synonymous widi  
&quot; unconstitutional,”—yet to guard against a misunder­  
standing of thi* phrase as more (Inn declaratory of opin­  
ion, the word “ unconstitutional” alone was retained,  
as not liable to that danger.  
Tlie published Address of the Legislature to the peo­  
ple, their constituents, affords another conclusive evi­  
dence of its views. Tlie Address warn* them against  
the encroaching -piiitof the General Gnvsrnmenl, ar­  
gue* the unrenatitutionality of die Alien and Sedition  
Acts, points to odier instances in which the con-fitu­  
tional limits had been overleaped ; dwells upon die dan­  
gerous mode of deriving power hy implication ; and in  
geneial presses the necessity of watching over tlie con­  
solidating tendoncy of tlie Federal policy. But nothing  
is said that can he understood to look to means of main­  
taining die rights of die States, beyond tlie regular  
ones, widiin the form* of the Constitution.  
If any further light* on the subject could he needed,  
a very strong one is reflected in (he answers to the  
Resolutions, by die States which protested against distn.  
The main objection of these, beyond a few general  
complaints of die inflammatory tendency of the Reso­  
lutions, wa« directed against die assumed eirliority i  
ol a State Legislature to declare a law of the Unit- ]  
ed States unconstitud nal, which they pronounced an  
mi warrantable interference with the exclusive juru­  
diction cf die Supreme Court of the United States.—  
Had the Resolutions baen regarded as avowing and  
maintaining a right, in an Individual State, to arrest,  
by force, tho execution of a hw of (he United States,  
it must be presumed that it would have been a con­  
spicuous object of their denunciation.

Montpeher, August, 1850.  
  
Dear sin—I hove duly received your letter, in wheeh heould not ‘ail to make th  
  
you refer to the “‘nullit ing doetrine,” advoeated as a  
constitutional right, by some of our distinguished fellow  
entizens; and to the proceedings of the Virginia legisla-  
wre m 798 °99, as appealed to im behal! of that doctrine;  
and you express a wish for my idess on those subjcets.  
  
I am aware of the delicacy of the task in some re-  
spects, and the difficulty in every respect, of doing tull  
justice ton, But, having, in more than one instance, eom-  
, with a like request from other friendly quarters,  
  
led to take of the doctrine in question, as well of some  
others connected with them; and of the grounds from  
which it appears, that the proceedings of Virginia have  
been misconceived by those who have appealed to them.  
In order to understand the trae character of the constitu-  
tion of the Un.ted States, the error, not uncommon, must  
be avoided, of viewing it through the medium, either of  
a consolidated government, or of a confederated govern-  
ment, whilst it is neither the one nor the other; buta  
mixture of both. And having, in no model, the simul  
tudes and analogies applicable to other systems ot go-  
vernment, it must, more than anv other, be its own in-  
terpreter according to its text and the fucts of the cuse.  
  
From these it will be seen that the characteristic pe-  
euliarities of the constitution sre, 1, the mode of its tor-  
mution; 2, the division of the supreme powers of govern-  
ment between the states in their united capacity, and the  
states in their individual capacities.  
  
1. Ii was formed, not by the governments of the com-  
ponent states, as the federal government for which it was  
substituted was formed. Nor was it formed by «a ma-  
jority of the people of the United States, as a single  
community in the manner of a consolidated government.  
  
It was formed by the states, that is by the people in  
each of the states, acting in their highest sovereign eapa-  
city; and formed consequently by the same authority  
which formed the state constitutions,  
  
Being thus derived from the sume source as the con-  
stitutions of the states, it has, within cach state, the same  
authority as the constitution of the states; and is-as much  
a cons itution, in the strict sense of the term, within its  
prescribed sphere, as the constiutions of the states are,  
withia their respective spheres; but with this obvious and  
éssential ditlerence, that being a compact among the  
efafes ih tteit highest sovereign capacity, and constitut.  
  
  
  
  
  
partially executed,  
  
  
  
ing the people thereof one people for certain purposes,  
itcannot be altered or annulled at the will of the states  
individually, as the constitution of a state may be at its  
individual with,  
  
2. And that it divides the snpreme powers of governe  
ment, between the government of the United States,  
vnd the governments of the individual states, is stamped  
on the tree of the instrument; the powers of war and of  
taxation, of commerce and of treaties, and other enume-  
rated powers vested in the government of the United  
States, being of as bigh and sovereign a charscter, as any  
of the powers reserved to the state governments.  
  
Nor is the governm nt of the United States, created  
by the constitution, less a government in the strict sense  
of the term, within the sphere of its powers, than  
the governments created by the constitutions of the  
stutes are, within them several spheres. Tt is like them  
organized into legislative, executive, and judiciary de-  
partments, Tt operates hke them, direetly on persons  
and things. And, bke them. nt bas at conmand a physi-  
cal force for executing the powers committed to it, The  
concurrent Operation in certain eases, is one of the fea-  
tures marking the peculiarity of the system,  
  
Between these different constitutional governments,  
the ohne operating in all the states, the others operating  
separately in each, with the aggregate powers of governe  
mont divided between them, it could not escape atten=  
tion, that controversies would arise concerning the boune  
daries of jurisdiction; and that some provision ought to  
be made for such occurrences. A’ political systeni that  
does not provide for a peaceable and authoritative termi-  
nation of occurring controversies, would not be more  
than the shadow of a government, the objeet and end of  
areal government bemg the substitution of law and ore  
der for uneertainty, confusion and violence,  
  
That to have left a final decision, in such eases, to  
each o! the states, then thirteen, and already twenty-four,  
constitution and laws of the  
United States different in d ferent states, was obvious;  
and not less obvious, that this diversity of independent  
decisions, must altogether distract the government of  
the union, and speed:ly put an end to the union itsell. A  
uniform authority of the laws, is in uself a vital prinel-  
ple. Some of the most important laws could not be  
bhey must be exceuted in all the  
States, or they could be duly execnted in none. An ime

states, would) be defeated in others. Tt is well known  
that this was among the lessons of experience, which  
had a primary influence in’ bringing about the existing  
constitution, A loss of its general authority would  
moreover revive the cxasperating questions between the  
states holding ports for forcign commerce, and the ade  
  
joming states without them; to: which are now added all  
  
the inland states, necessarily carrying on thew foreign  
commerce through other states.  
  
To have made the dee:sions under the authority of the  
individual states, co-ordinate, in all eases, with decisions  
under the authority of the United States, would unavoid-  
ably produce collisions incompatible with the peace of  
society, and with that regular and efficient adimimistration  
which is of the essence of tree governments. Scenes  
cond not be avoided, in which a ministerial officer of  
the United States, and the correspondent officer of an ine  
dividual state, would have rencontres im executing cone  
flieting decrees; the result of which would depend on  
the comparative force of the local posses attending them;  
and that, a casualty depending on the political opimions  
und party feelings in d.ff-rent states,  
  
Yo have referred every clashing decision, under the  
two wuthoritics, for a final decision, to the states as pare  
ties to the constitution, would be attended with delays,  
with inconveniences, and with expenses, amounting to a  
prohivition of the expedient; not to mention its tenden-  
cy to impair the salutary veneration for a system requir-  
ing such frequent interpos tions, nor the delicate ques  
tions which might present themselves as to the form of  
stating the appeal, and as to the quorum for deciding it.  
  
To have trusted to negotiation tor adjusting disputes  
between the governinent of the United States and the  
state governments, as between independent and separate  
sovereignties, would have Jost sight altogether of a con-  
stitution and government for the urfion, and opened a di-

rect road from a failure of that resort, to the ultima ratio  
between nations wholly independent of and alien to each  
other. If the idea had its origin in the process of adjust-  
ment, between separate branches of the same govern-  
ment, the analogy entirely fails. In the case of dis-  
putes between independent parts of the same govern-  
ment, neither party being able to consummate its will,  
nor the government to proceed without a concurrence  
of the parts, necessity brings about an accommodation,  
In disputes between a state government, and the govern-  
ment of the United States, the case is practically as well  
as theoretically different; each party possessing all the  
departments of an organized government, legislative, ex-  
ecutive, and judiciary; and having each a physical force  
to support its pretensions. Aithough the issue of nego-  
tiation might sometimes avoid this extremity, how often  
would it happen among so many states, that an unaccom-  
modating spirit in some would render that resource un-  
availing. A contrary supposition would not accord with  
a knowledge of human nature, or the evidence of our  
own political history.  
  
The constitution, not relying on any of the preceding  
modifications, for its safe and successtul operation, has  
expressly declared, on the one hand, 1, “That the con-  
stitution, and the laws made in pursnance thereof, and  
all treaties made under the authority of the United  
States, shall be the supreme law of the land; 2, that the  
judges of every state shall be bound thereby, any thing  
in the constitution and laws of any state to the contrary  
notwithstanding; 3, that the judicial power ofthe United  
States shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising  
under the constitution, the laws of the United States,  
and treaties made under their authority,” ke.

powers of the states, in their individual capacities, against

the subject was regarded by its writer, at the period when  
the constitution was depending; and it is believed, that  
the same was the prevailing view then taken of it, that  
the same view has continued to prevail, and that it does  
so at this time, notwithstanding the eminent exceptions  
to it,  
  
But it is perfectly consistent with the concession of  
this power to the supreme court, in cases falling. within  
the course of its functions, to maintain that the power has  
not always been rightly exercised. To say nothing of  
the period, happily a short one, when judges in their  
seats did not abstain from intemperate and party liae  
rangues, equally at variance with their dignity, there  
have been occasional decisions from the bench, which have  
incurred serious and extensive disapprobation. Stil it  
would seem, that, with but few exceptions, the course  
of the jadiciary lias been hitherto sustained by the pres  
dominant sense of the nation.  
  
‘Those who have denied or doubted the supremacy of  
the judicial power of the United States, and denounce at  
the same time nullifying power in a state, seem not to  
have sufficiently adverted to the utter inefficiency of a  
supremacy in @ Jaw of the land, withont a supremacy in  
the exposition and execution of the law; nor to the dee  
struction of all equipoise between the federal government  
and the state governments, if, whilst the fanctionaries of  
the federal government are directly ov indirectly eleeted  
by and respeusible to the states,and the functionaries of the  
states are in their appointment and responsibility whotly  
independent of the United States, no constitutional cone  
trol of any sort belonged to the United States over the  
states. Under such an organization, itis evident that it  
would be in the power of the states, individually, to pass  
unauthorized laws, and to earry them into complete ef  
fect, any thing in the constitution and laws of the United  
States to the contrary notwithstanding. This would be

stitution has relied on, 1, the responsibility of the sena-  
tors and representatives in the legislature of the United  
States to the legislatures and people of the states; 2, the  
responsibility of the president to the people of the Unit-  
ed States; and 3, the lability of the executive and judi-  
cial functionaries of the United States to impeachment  
by the representatives of the people of the states, in one |  
branch of the legislature of the United States, and trial  
by the representatives of the states, in the other beanch:  
the state functionaries, legislative, executive and judicial,  
being, at the same time, in their appointment and res |  
sponsibility, altogether independent of the agency or  
authority of the United States.  
  
How far this structure of the government of the Unit-  
ed States is adequate and safe for its objects, time alone  
can absolutely determine. Experience scems to have  
shown, that whatever may grow out of tuture stages of  
our national career, there is, as yet, a sufficient control  
in the popular will, over the executive and legislative de-  
partments of the government. When the alicn and se-  
dition laws were passed in contravention to the opi-  
nions and feelings of the community, the first elections  
that ensued putan endtothem. And whatever may have  
been the character of other acts, in the judgment of  
  
  
  
many of us, itis but true, that they have generally accord.  
ed with the views of a majority of the stetes and of the  
people. At the present day it seems well understood,  
that the laws which have created most dissatisfaction,  
have had a like sanction without doors; and that whether  
continued, varied or repealed, alike proof will be given  
of the sympathy and responsibility of the representative  
body to the constituent body, Indeed, the great com-  
plaint now is, against the results of this syimpathy and  
responsibility in the legislative policy of the nation,  
With respect to the judicial power of the United States,  
and the authority of the supreme court in relation to the  
boundary of jurisdiction between the feder J and the state  
governments, | may be permitted to refer to the thirty-

a nullitving power in its plenary cheracter; and whether  
it had its final effect, through the legislative, exvcutive,  
or judiciary organ of the state, would be equally fatal to  
the constituted relation between the two governments,  
  
Should the provisions of the constitution as here ree  
viewed, be found not to secure the government and rights  
of the states against usurpations and abuses on the part of  
the United States, the final resort within the purview of  
the constitution lies in an amendment of the constitution,  
according to a process applicable by the states.  
  
And in the event of the failure of every constitutional  
resort, and an accumulation of usurpations and abuses,  
rendering passive obedience anil non-resistance a greater  
evil than resistance and revolution, there can remain but  
one resort, the last of all—an appeal from the cancelled  
obligations of the compeet, to original rights and the law  
of self-preservation. ‘This is the ultazma ratio under all  
governments, whether consolidated, contederated, ora  
compound of both; and it cannot be doubted thit a single  
member of the umion, in the extremity supposed, but in  
that only, would have a right, as an extva and ullra-cone  
stitniional right, to make the appeal.  
  
Thus brings us to the expedient lately advanced, which  
cluims for « single state a right to appeal against an exere  
cise of power by the government of the United States de-  
cided by the state to be unconstitutional to the parties to  
the constitutional compact; the decisson of the state to  
have the effect of nullifying the act of the government of  
United States, unless the decision of the state be revers-  
ed by three-fourth of the parties,  
  
The distinguished names and high authorities whieh  
appear to have asserted and given a practica | scope to  
this devctrine, entile it to a respect which jt might be dife  
ficuit otherwise to feel for it,  
  
if the doctrine were to be understood as requiring the  
three-fourths of the states to sustain, instead of that pro-  
portion to reverse the decision of the appealing state,  
the decision to be without effect during the appeal, it

would be sufficient to remark that this extra-constitutional  
course might well give way to that marked out by the  
constitution, which authorizes two-thirds of the states to  
Institute and three-fourths to effectuate an amendment of  
the constitution, establishing a permanent rule of the  
highest authority, in place of an irregular precedent of  
construction only,  
  
But it is understood that the nullifying doetrine im-  
o. that the decision of the state is to be presumed va-  
id, and that it overrules the law of the United States,  
unless overruled by three-fourths of the states.  
  
Can more be necessary to Memonistrate the inadmis3i-  
bility of such a doctrine, than that it ptts it in the power  
of the smallest fraction over one-fourth of the United  
States, thut is, of seven states out of twenty-four, to give  
the law and even the constitution of seventeen states,  
each of the seventeen having as parties to the constitu.  
tion, an equal right of the seven, to expound it, and to  
insist on the exposition? Vhat the seven might, in par- |  
ticular imstances be right, and the seventeen wrong, is  
more than posible. But to establish a positive and per-  
manent rule giving such « power, to such a minority,  
over such a majority, would overturn the first principle |  
of free government, and in practice necessarily overturn  
the government itself.  
  
It is to be recollected that the constitution was propos-  
ed to the people of the states as @ whele, and unani-  
mousty adopted by the states.as a whole, it being a part’  
of the constitution that not less.than three-fourths of the |  
states should be competent to make any alteration in  
what had been unanimously agreed to. So great is the |  
caution on this point, that in two eases where peculiar  
interests were at stake, a proportion even of three-  
fourths is distrusted, and unanimity required to make an  
afteration.  
  
When the constitution was adopted as a whole, it is’  
eertain that there were many parts, which, if scparately  
pivpests would have been promptly rejected. Lt is far  
rom impossible, that every part of a constitution might  
be rejected by a majority, and yet taken together as a  
whole, be unanimously accepted. Free constitutions  
will rarely if ever be formed, without reciprocal conces- |  
sions; without articles conditioned on and balaneing-each |  
‘other. . Is there &amp; constitution of a singte state out of the |  
twenty-four that would bear the experiment of having its |  
component parts submitted to the people and separately  
decided on?  
  
What the fate of the constitttion of the United States  
would be if a small proportion of the states could ex-|  
punge parts of it particularly valued by a large majority,  
can have but one answer,  
  
The difficulty is no, removed by limiting the doctrine  
to cases of construction. How many eases of that sort,  
involving cardinal provisions of the constitution have oc-  
curred? How majiy now exist?) Tow many may here-  
after spring up? How many might be ingeniously create |  
ed, fF entitled to the privilege of a decision in the mode  
proposed? :  
  
Is it certain that the principle of that mode would not  
reach further than is contemplated? If a single state |  
can of right require three-fourths of its co-states to over-  
rule its exposition of the constitution, because that pro- |  
portion is authorized to amend it, would the plea be less -  
plausible that, as the constitution was Unaninrously ese |  
tablished, it ought to be unanimously expounded?  
  
The reply to all such suggestions seems to be an-4  
avoidable and irresistable, that the constitution is a com-  
pact, that its text is to be expounded according to the  
provisions for expounding t—making a geaar&#x27;e of the com-  
pact; and that none of the partics ean rightlolly renounce  
the expounding provision more than any other part,  
When such a right acerues, as may accruc, it must grow |  
out of abuses of the compact relcasing U  
  
  
  
  
  
x the sufferers trom |  
  
their fealty to it.  
  
In favor of the nullifying claim for the states, individu. |  
  
ally, it appears, as you observe, that the proceedings of  
  
the legislature of Virginia, in 98, and in “99, against the |  
alien and sedition acts, are much dwelt upon.  
  
It may often happen, as experience proves, that erro-  
neous constructions not anticipated, may not be suffice nte|  
ly guarded against, in the languase used; and itis due to  
the distinguished individuals, who have misconceived the  
‘satention of those proceedings, to suppose that the mean-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ing of the legislature, though well comprehended at the  
time, may not now be obvious to thdse unacquainted with  
the contemporary indications and impressions.  
  
But itis believed that by keeping in view the distinc-  
tion between the governments of the states, and the states  
in the sense in which (hey were parties to the constitution;  
between (he rights of the parties in their concurrent and  
in their individual capacities; between the several modes  
wnd objects of interposition against the abuses of power,  
and especially between interpositions within the purview  
of the constitution, and interpositions appealing from the  
constitution to the rights of nature, paramount to all con-  
stitutions, with an attention, always of explanatory use,  
to the views and arguments which were combated, the  
resolutions of Yirgmia, as vindicated in the report on  
them, will be found entitled to an exposition, shewing a  
consistency in their parts, and an inconsisteney of the  
whole with the doctrine under consideration.  
  
That the legislature cou&#x27;d not have intended to sane-  
tion such a doctrine, is to be inferred from. the debates  
in the house of delegates, and from the address of the  
  
| two houses to thei constituents, on the subject of the  
  
resolutions. The tenor of the debates, which were ably  
conducted, and ave understood to have been revised for  
the press by most, if not all of the speakers, discloses no  
reference whatever to a-eonstitutional right of an indi-  
vidual state to arrest by force the operation of a law of  
the United States. Conecrt among the states tor redress  
against the alien and sedition laws, a3 acts of usurped  
power, was a leading sentiment; and the attamment of a  
concert, the immediate object of the course adopted by  
the lesislature, which was that of inviting the other states  
“to concur in declaring the acts to be unconstitutionals  
and to co-operate by the necessary and proper measures  
in maintaining unimpaired the authorities, mghts and lib-  
erties reserved to the stales respectively and to the peo-  
ple.”’* “That by the necessary and proper measures to  
be concurrentiy sad co-operatively taken, were meant  
  
measures known to the constitution, particularly the ore  
  
dinary control of the people and legislatures of the states,  
over the government of the Unned States, cannot be  
doubted; aud the interposiion ot this control, as the  
event shewed, was equal to the oceasion.  
  
It is worthy of remark, and explenatery of the inten-  
tions of the legistature; that the words ‘‘not haw, but  
utterly null, vod and of no force or cffeet,” which had  
fatlowed, in one of the resolutions, the word ‘tunconsti-  
tational,” were struck out by commonconsent. Though  
the words were in fact but synonymous with “unconsti-  
tutional,’ yet, to guard against a misunderstanding of  
this phrase as more than dectaratory of opinion, the word  
‘‘unconstitulional” alone was retained, as not Jiable te  
that danger.  
  
‘The published address of the legishture to the peo-  
ple, their constituents, affords another conclusive evi-  
dence of its views. ‘The address warns them against the  
encroaching spirit of the general government, argues the  
uncoustituuionality of the alien and sedition acts, points  
to other instances in which the constitutional Jimits had  
been overleaped; dwells upon the dangerous mode of de-  
riving power by implication; and im general presses the  
necessity of watching over the consolidating tendency ot  
the federal policy. Bat nothing is said that can be une  
derstood to look to means of maintaining the rights .of  
the states, beyoud the regular ones, within the forms of  
the constitution. &gt;  
  
Ifany further lights on the subject could be needed, a  
very strong one is reflected in the answers to the reso-  
lutions, by the states which ‘protested @eainst them.  
The main objection of these, beyond afew general eom-  
pleints of the mflunmatory tendency of the resolutions,  
was directed aginst the assumed authority of a state le-  
gislature to declare a law of the United States unconsti-  
tutional, which they pronounced an unwarrantable ine  
terterence with the exclusive jurisdiction of the supreme  
court ot the United States. fhid the resviuuons been  
regarded as avowing aud twaintaming a right, in an indi-  
  
vidual state, to arrest, by foree, the execution of a Jaw of  
  
the Unied States, it must be presumed that it would  
have been a conspicuous object of their denunciation.  
W ith cordial salutations, JAMES MADISON

With respect of the judicial power of Ihe

light ill which the subject was regarded tty its  
writer, at ttie period when die fJnnsttliiiinii was  
pending ; and it i* believed that the same was  
the ptrvailiug vmw then taken of it. that the  
saiuo view has continued to prevail, and that it  
«loes so at this time, not w iiliilanding the emi  
nent exceptions to it.  
Hut it is perfectly consistent with the conces­  
sion of Ihi* power to the Suprautc Court, in ca­  
ses falling within ihe course of its functions, to  
maintain that tue power lias not always been  
l ightly eierci*ed To say nothing of the period,  
happily a short one. when Judges in their seals  
did not abstain from intemperate and paity  
haraogoes, equally at variance with their duty  
and dour dignity ; there have l#e*-n occasional  
decision* from the bench, which have incurred  
serious and extensive dmuppiobation. Still it  
Would Serin, that, with hut lew exceptions, the  
course of ihn Judiciary has been hitheito  
* ixUtnied by ihe pf dominant trust) of tin* na­

I hose who have denied or doubted the supre­  
macy of the judicial power of the United States,  
and deuiMinc&#x27; at the same time a nnl&#x27;ifying  
power m a State, seem not fo have suflicienlly

and of the grounds from which it appears,  
that the proceedings of Virginia have  
been misconceived by those who have  
Cappealed to theme Inoorder to under­  
stand the true character of the Constitu­  
tion of the United States, the error, not  
uncommon, must be avoided; of viewing  
itthrongh the medivm, either of a con­  
sohidated Government, or of a confede­  
rated Government, whilst it s neither  
Tone nor the other; but a misture of both,  
And having, in no model] the similitudes  
and analogies applicable to other systems  
of Government, it must, more than any  
other, he its own interpreter according to  
its text and the fucls of the case, |  
C Irom these it will be geen, that the  
characteristic peculiaritics of the Consti­  
tution are, I, the mode of its formation;  
2, the division of the supreme powers of  
Government hetween the States in their  
united capacity, and the States i thei  
imdividual eapacities, ’  
i 1. It was formed, not by the Govern-|  
ments of the component States, as the  
Federal Government for which 1t was  
substituted was formed. Nor wasit form­  
ed by a majority of the people of the  
[Tnited States; as a single community,  
in the manner of a consolidated Govern-|  
‘ment, !  
  
| ‘lt was formed by the States, that is by ?‘  
‘the people in each of the States, acting i |  
their highest sovercign capacity; and !  
Sormed consequently by the same anthor­  
ity which formed the State Constitutions,  
| ““Being thus derived from the same  
source as the Constitution of the States,  
it has, within each State; the same an­  
thority as the Constitution ol the State;  
and is as much a Constitution, in the  
striet sense of the term, within s |n&#x27;l--|  
seribed sphere; as the Constitutions of  
the States are, within their respective  
spheres: but with this obvious and es-!  
sentinl dificrence, that being a compact  
among the States in their highest sove-,  
reign capacity s and constituting the peo-|  
ple thereof” one people for certain pur-,  
poses, it cannot he altered or annulled at!  
the will of the State individually, as the  
Constitution of a State may be at its in-‘  
dividual will,  
  
- 92, And that it divides the supreme  
powers of Government hetween the Goy-!  
crnment of the United States, and the  
Governments of the individual States; s  
stamped on the face of the strument;  
the powers of war and of taxation, of  
commerce and of treaties; and other enu­  
‘merated powers vested in the Govern­  
ment of the U, States; heing of as high  
and sovereign a character, as any of the  
powers reserved to the State Govern­  
ments, |  
  
“Noris the Government of the United  
States, ereated by the Constitution, less  
a Government in the striet sense of the  
term, within the sphere of s powers,  
than the Governments ereated by the  
Constitutions of the States are, within&#x27;  
their several spheres, Itis like them  
organized into Legislative, Executive |

would not accord with a knowledge ol  
human nature, or the evidence of our  
own political history. |  
“I&#x27;he Constitution not relying on any  
of the precedimg modifications tor its sate.

declared that on the one hand, 1, “that the

ment of the United States is adequate  
and safe for its objects, time alone can  
absolutely determine, Fixperience seems  
to have shewn, that whatever may grow  
out of futare stages of our national career,

it seems well underdood, that the laws

that the same was the prevailing view

dated, confederated, or a compound of  
hoth; and it cannot be doubted, that a  
single member of the Union, in the ex­  
tremnty sapposed, but in that only, would  
have a night, as an extra and ultra-con­  
stitutional - right, to make the appeal.  
This brings us to the expedient lately  
advanced; which elaims for a single State  
a nght to appeal against an exercise of  
power by the Government of the United  
States decided by the Stute to be uncon­  
stitutional, to the partics to the constitu­  
tional compaet; the decision of the State  
to have the effect of nullifying the act of  
the Government of the United States, un­  
less the decision of the State be revers­  
ed by three fourths of the paities, t  
The distinguished names and high au­  
thoritics which appear to have asserted  
and given a practical scope to this doe­  
thne, entitle it to a respect which i might  
be diflicult otherwise to feel for at,  
St the doctrine were to be understood  
as requinng the theee fomths of the  
Stite to sustaing instead of that propor­  
tion to reverse the decision to the appeal­  
ing Stateg the decision to be without ef­  
feet during the appeal, it would he suf­  
ficient to remark, that this extra constitu­  
tional course might well gzive way to that  
marked out by the Constitution, which  
anthorizes two thirds of the States to -  
stitute and three fourths to effectuate an  
amendment of the Constitution, estaili=h­  
ing a permanent roule of the highest au­  
thority Jin place ofan irregular precedent  
of constructions ouly. {  
  
‘But it 15 understood that the nullify­  
ing doctrine imports that the decision of  
the State is to be presumed valid, and that  
it overrules the law of the United States,  
unless overruled by three fomths of the  
States, Canomore he necessary to de­  
monstrate the nadmissibility of such a  
doctvine, thanat putsitin the power ot the  
sinadlest fraction over one fowth of the  
United States, that s, of seven States out  
of twenty four, to give the law and even  
the con=tituti n, to seventeon States,  
  
ccneh ot the seventeen having as partics to

Lot the seven, to expound aty and to insist

Lseventeen wrongs, 15 more than pos&lt;ible, !  
&quot;Hul to cstabhish a positive and perma­  
&quot;nent rale giving such a power, to such al  
’u:iumili\&#x27;, over such a majority, would  
foverttrn the first principle of free gove  
Lernment, and in practicenecessanly over­  
lturn the Government iself’ |  
! “Utas to be recollected that the coneti-  
Htation was proposcd to the people of the  
|States as a whol. y and unanimously adopt­  
‘H&#x27; by the States as a wlole, it heine al  
it of the constitution that not less than  
Hhiree fourths of the States should be ecme­  
fpetent to make any alteration e what  
Chad been unanmmounsly agreed to, So  
‘great is the caution on this point, that in  
(Lo cases wepe peculiar interests were at  
ctake,aproportion even of three foarths is  
Adistrusted) and unanimity requued to  
&quot;make an alteration, |  
  
When the constitution was adopted ne  
awholeitis certatn that there were many  
parts, whichy af separately proposed,  
would have been promptly rejected, It  
is far from impossible, that every part of  
a constitution might be rejected by a  
majority, and yvet taken together as a  
whole be unamimonsly accepted, Free  
constitutions will ravely i ever be formed,  
without reciprocal concessions; without  
articles condittioned on and balancing  
cach other, Isthere a constitution of a  
single State out of the twenty four that  
would bhear the experiment of having its  
component pa ts submitted to the people  
and separately decuded on? i  
‘What the fate of the constitution of the  
United States would be if&#x27;a small part of  
the States could expunge parts ol it par­  
tenlarly valued by a large majoniy, ean’  
have bhut one answer., [  
  
| “The difficulty is not removed by limit­  
“ing the doctrine to cases of eonstruction.  
How many cases of that sort, mvolving  
cardinal provisions of the constitution,  
have occurred? How many now exist?  
How many may hereafier spring up?  
How many might be ingenonsly ereated,  
i entitled to the privilege of a deeision |  
in the mode proposed? l  
| sit certain that the principle n!&#x27;ﬂml’  
mode would not veach further than s  
ccontemplated. 16 a single State can of  
right requice three fourths ofits coStatesto  
overrule its exposition of the Constitution,  
becnuse that proportion s authorized to  
Samend ity wounld the plea be less |v|:|||~!-  
ble that, as the constitution was anam-|  
monsly established, it ought to be unani­  
mmul&#x27;y expounded? ‘  
  
, “Phe reply to all such suggaestions  
seems to be unavoidable and wresistable s  
that the constitution 15 a compact, that  
its et s to be I&#x27;\|m||m|c&#x27;l| ne c&#x27;nnlmg to  
the provisions for expounding it—malk­  
ing a part of the compactand that none  
of the parties can nghtiully renounce the  
expounding provisionmore than any other  
part. When such aright acernes, as may  
accrne, it must grow out of abuses of the  
compact releasing the sufferers from their  
fealty toat, ‘  
  
I favor of the nullifying elaim for !Im“  
Otates individually, 1t appears, as vou  
  
observe, that the proccedings of the Leg­  
islatare of Virginia in ’9B and ’99, a­  
gainst the Alien and Sedition Acts, are  
much dwelt upon.  
‘lt may often happen, as experience  
proves, that erroncous constructions not  
anticipated, may not be suflicient]  
gumded against, in the language usN{Y;  
and at s due to the distingmished individ­  
nalsy who have miseonceiwved the inten­  
tion of those procecdings, to suppose that  
the meaning of the Legislature, though  
well comprehended at the time, may not  
now he obvious to those unacquainted  
with the contemporary indications and  
l‘“l:”’l‘ﬁ.\‘i”“.‘i. :  
  
‘But it is believed that by keeping in  
view the distinetion between the Govern­  
ments of the States, and the States in  
the sense inwhich they were parties to  
the Constitution; between the rights of  
the purties, in their coneurrent and in  
their mdividaal eapacities; hetween the  
  
several modes and ohjects of interposition  
agast the abuses of power, and espe­  
cially between interpositions within the  
purview of the constitution, and interpo­  
sittons appealing from the constitution to  
the rights of nature paramount to all  
constitutions; with an attention, always  
of explanatory use, to the views and ar­  
guments which were combatted; the Re­  
solutions of Virgima, as vindicated in the  
Report on themn, will be found entitled to  
an exposition showing a consistency in  
their parts, and an inconsisteney of the  
whole with the doctrine under consider­  
ation,  
  
“I&#x27;hat the Legislature eould not have  
imtended to sanction such a doctrine is  
to be inferred from the debates in the  
House of Delegates, and from the ad­  
dress of the two Houses to them  
con&lt;titnents on the subject of the  
Ilesolutions The tenor of the de­  
bates, which were ably eonducted  
and are nnderstod to have been revised  
for the press by most; 1l not all; of the  
r‘lll&#x27;il&#x27;(l&#x27;l‘.ﬂ‘ discloses no reference whatev­  
er to a constitutional right in an individ­  
ual State, to arrest by foree the operation  
of alaw of the nited States, Concert  
among the States for redress against the  
Alcn and Sedition Laws, as acts of usur­  
ped power, wasa leading sentiment; and  
the attainment of a concert, the immedi­  
ate objeet of the conrse adopted by the  
Legilature, which was that of inviting  
the other States “to concur, in declaring *  
the acts to be unconstitutional, and to co­  
operate by the iecessary and proper meas­  
ures i maintaiing unimpaired the au­  
thoritics, righta and liberties reserved  
to the States respectively and to the  
people.™ That by the necessary and  
proper measures to he conenrrently and  
co=opevaticely taken, were meant meas­  
ures known tothe constitution, particular-  
Iy the ardinary control of the people and  
Legislatures of the States; over the Gove  
ernment of the United States, cannot be  
donbited: and the interposition of this con­  
trol, as the event showed; was equal to  
the oceasion,  
  
Tt is worthy of remark, and explana­  
tory of the intentions of the Legislature,  
that the words “not law, but utterly null

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Monrrewier, Auaust, 1830.  
  
Dear Sir: | have duly received your lettter, in which  
you refer to the “ nullifying doctrine,” advocated as con-  
stitutiona! riglt, by some of our distinguished fellow citi-  
zens ; and to the proceedings of the Virginia Legislature in  
‘98 and ‘99, as appealed to in behalf of that doctrine ; and  
you express a wish for my ideas on those subjects.  
  
J am aware of the delicacy of the task in some respects,  
and the diticulty in every respect, of doing full justice to  
it. But, having, in more than one instance, complied with  
alike request from other friendly quarters, I do aot decline  
a sketch of the views which | have been led to take of the  
doctrine in question, as well as some others connected with  
them ; and of the grounds from which it appears that the  
proceedings of Virginia have been misconceived by those  
who have appealed to them. In order to undetstand the  
true character of the Constitution of the United States, the  
error, not uncommon, must be avoided, of riewing it  
through the medium, either of a consolidated Government, &#x27;  
or of a confederated Government, whilst it is neither the  
one nor the other; but a mixture of both. Ami having,  
in no mode., the simuilitudes and analogies applicable to  
other systems of Government, it must, more than any other,  
be its own interpreter, according to its text and the facts  
of the case.  
  
From these it will be seen, that the characteristic. pecu-  
liarities of the Constitution are, 1, the mode of its forma-  
ticn ; 2, the division of the supreme powers of Gevernment  
between the States in their united capacity, and the States  
in their individual capacities.  
  
1. It was formed, not by the Governments of the com-  
ponent States, as the Federal Government for which it was  
substituted was formed. Nor was it formed by a majority  
of the people of the United States, as a single community,  
m the roanner of a consolidated Government.  
  
It was formed by the States, that is, by the People in  
each of the States, acting im their highest sovereign capa-  
city ; and formed consequently by the same authority which  
formed the State Canstitntinns.  
  
Being thus derived from the same source as the Consti-  
tutions of the States, it has, within each State, the same  
authority as the Constitution of the State ; and is as much a  
Constitution, in the strict sense of the term, within its pre-  
scribed sphere, as the Constitutions of the States are, with-  
in their respective spheres: but with this obvious and es-  
sential difference, that, being a compact amor the States  
m their highest severeign capacity, and consututing the  
people thereofone people for certain purposes, it cannot be  
altered or annulled at the will of the States individually, as|  
the Constitution of a State may be at its individual will.  
  
2. And that it divides the supreme powers of Govern-  
ment, between the Government of the United States, and/|  
the Governments of individual States, is stamped on the.  
face of the instrument ; the powers of war and of taxation,  
of commerce, and of treaties, and other enumersted powers  
vested in the Government of the U. States, being of as high |  
and sovereign a character as any of the powers reserved to|  
the State Governments.  
  
Nor is the Government of the United States, created by  
the Constitution, less a Government in the strict sense of.  
the term, within the sphere of its powers, than the Govern-  
ments created by the Constitution of the States are, with-  
in their several spheres. It is like them organized into  
Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary Departments. It)  
operates, like them, directly on persons and things. And,  
dike them, it has at command a physical force for execut-  
ing the powers committed toit. The concurrent operation  
in certain cases, is one of the features. marking the peculi-  
arity of the systein.  
  
Between these different Constitutional Governments, the  
one operating in all the States, the others operating separate-  
ty in each, with the aggregate powers of Government divid-  
ed between them, it could not escape attention, that contro-  
versies would arise concerning the boundaries of jurisdic-  
tion ; and that some provision ought to be made for such  
occurrences. A political system that does not provide for  
a peaceable and authoritative termination of occurring con-  
troversies, wou!d not be more than the shadow of a Govern-  
ment; the object and end of a real Government being the  
substitution of law and order, for uncertainty, confusion,  
and violence.  
  
‘That to have left a final decision, in such cases, to each  
of the States, then thirteen, and already twenty-four, could  
not fail to make the Constitution and laws of the United  
States different in different States, was obvious; and not  
less obvious, that this diversity of in t decisions  
must altogether distract the Government of the Union, and

should be competent to make any alteration in what had  
been unanimously agreed to. So great is the caution on  
this point, that in two cases where peculiar interests were  
at stake, a proportion even of three-fourths is distrusted, and  
unanimity required to make an alteration.  
  
When the Constitution was adopted as a whole, it is  
certain that there  
proposed, would have been promptly rejected.  
trom impossible, that every part of a Constitution might be  
rejected by a majority, and yet taken together as a whole,  
be unanimously accepted. Free Constitutions will rarely,  
if ever, be formed, without reciprocal concessions ; without  
articles conditioned on and balancing each other. Is there  
a Constitution of a single State out of the twenty-four, that  
would bear the experiment of having its component parts  
submitted to the people, and separately decided on?  
  
What the fate of the Constitution of the United States  
would be, if a small proportion of the States could expunge  
parts of it particularly valued by a large majority, can have  
but one answer.  
  
The difficulty is not removed by limiting the doctrine to  
cases of construction. How many cases of that sort, involv-  
ing cardinal provisions of the Constitution, have occurred ?  
How many now exist ? How many may hereafter spring up ?  
tlow many might be ingeniously created, if entitled to the  
privilege of a decision in the mode proposed ?  
  
Is it certain that the principle of that mode would not  
reach further than isconiemplated? Ifa single State can  
of right require three-fourths of its co-States to overrule its  
exposition of the Constixution, because that proportion is  
authorized to amend it, would the plea be less plausible  
that, as the Constitution was unanimously established, it  
ought to be unanimously expounded ?  
  
The reply to all such suggestions seems to be unavoid-  
able and irresistible; that the Constitution is a compact,  
that its text is to be expounded according to the provisions  
for expounding it, making a part of the compact; and that  
none of the parties can rightfully renounce the expounding  
provision more than any other part. When such a right  
accrues, as may accrue, it must grow out of abuses of the  
compact releasing the sufferers from their fealty to it.  
  
In favor of the nullifying claim for the States, individu-  
ally, it appears, as you observe, that the proceedings of the  
Legislature of Virginia, in ’9S and ’99, against the Alien  
and Sedition Acts, are much dwelt upon.  
  
It may often happen, as experience proves, that erroneous  
constructions not anticipated may not be sufficiently guard-  
ed against, in the language used ; and it is due to the distin-  
guished individuals who have misconceived the intention of  
these proceedings, to suppose that the meaning of the Le-  
gislature, though well comprehended at the time, may not now  
be obvious tothose unacquainted with the contemporary indi-  
cations and impressions.  
  
But it is belieféd, that, by keeping in view the distinction  
between the Governments of the States, and the States in  
the sense in which they were parties to the Constitution ;  
between the rights of the parties, in their concurrent and in  
their individual capacities ; between the several modes and  
objects of interposition against the abuses of power, and es-  
pecially between interpositions within the purview of the  
Constitution, and interpositions appealing from the Consti-  
tution to the rights of nature, paramount to all Constitutions ;  
with an attention, always, of explanatory use, to the views  
and arguments which were combatted, the Resolutions of  
Virginia, as vindicated in the report on them, will be found  
entitled to an exposition, showing a consistency in their  
parts, anéan inconsistency of the whole with the doctrine  
under consideration.  
hat the Legislature could not have intended to sanction  
  
a doctrine is to be inferred from the debates in the  
  
» of Delegates, and from the address of the two Houses  
  
r constituents, on the subject of the resolutions. The  
  
r of the debates, which were ably conducted, and are  
uncderstoed to have been revised for the press by most if not  
ail of the speakers discloses ho reference whatever to a con-  
  
: nal right in an individual State, to arrest by force the  
  
eration of a law of the United States. Concert among  
  
“rates for redress against the Alien and Sedition Laws,  
as scts of usurped power, was a leading sentiment ; and the  
. rent of a concert the immediate object of the course  
axcopted by the Legislature, which was that of inviting the  
other States “to concur in declaring the acts to be uncon-  
stiintional, and to co-operate in the necessary and proper  
measures in maintaining unimpaired the authorities, rights,  
and liberties reserved to the States respectively, and to the  
That, by the necessary and proper measures to be  
roncurrent/y and co-operatively taken, were meant measures  
known to the Constitution, particularly the ordinary control  
of the people and Legislatures of the States over the Gov-  
ernment of the United States, cannot be doubted ; and the  
imterposition of this control, as the event showed, was equal  
to the occasion. |

other instances in which the constitutional limits had been  
overleaped ; dwells upon the dangerous mode of deriving  
power by implication : and in general presses the necessity

were many parts, which, if separately|to look to means in maintaining the rights of the States,  
It is far| beyond the reguler ones, within the forms of the Consti-  
  
tution.  
  
If any further lights on the subject could be needed, a  
very strong one is reflected in tbe answers to the Resolu-  
tions, by the States which protested against them. ‘The  
main objection of these, beyond a few general complaints  
of the inflammatory tendency of A4he Resolutions, was di-  
rected against the assumed authority of a State Legisla-  
ture to declare a law of the United States unconstitution-  
al, which they pronounced an unwarrantable interference  
with the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the  
United States. Had the reselutions been regarded as  
avowing and maittaining a right, in an individual State,  
to arrest, by force, the execution of a law of the United  
States, it must be presumed that it would have been a con-  
spicuous object of their denunciation.

The difficulty ia not removed by lim-,

Is it certain that the principle of that  
mode would not reacli further than is con­

4 The reply to all such suggestions  
seems to be unavoidable and irresistible ;  
that the Constitution is a compact, that  
its text is to be expounded according to

of the local &#x27;posses attending them 5 and  
that; a casualty ilepending on the joliti­  
cal opinions and party feelings in differ­  
etjt States ; &quot; ; &#x27;  
&quot; To have referred every clashing de­  
rision, under the .two authorities, for a  
final decision, tp the States as parties to  
the Constitution, would be attended with  
delays with inconveniences, and with  
expenses, amounting to a prohibition of  
  
the, expedient ; not to mention its ten-  
  
qencV Jo ipipair the salutary veneration  
tor a system requiring such frequent in­  
terpositions, nor the delicate questions  
which might present themselves as to the  
form of stating the appeal, and as to the  
quorum for deciding it.  
.. &#x27; To have trusted to negotiation for ad­  
justing disputes between the Government  
of the United States and the State Go­  
vernments, as between independent and  
separate sovereignties, would have lost  
  
sight altogether of a Constitution and Go­  
vernment; for the Union 5 and opened a  
direct road &quot;from a failure of that resort,  
to the ultima ratio between nations whol­  
ly independent of and alien to each other.  
  
If the idea had its origin in the process of  
adjustment, between separate branches of  
the same Government, the analogy en  
  
tirely fails. In the case of disputes be­  
tween independent parts of the same Go­  
vernment neither part being able to con­  
summate its will, nor the Government to  
proceed without a concurrence of the parts,,  
necessity brings aboutan accommodation.  
In disputes between a State Government,  
apd the Government of the United States,  
&#x27;he case is practically as well as theoreti­  
cally different : each party possessing9 all  
he departments of an organized Govern­  
nent, Legislative, Executive, and Judi­  
ciary 5 and having each a physical force  
to support its &#x27;pretensions. Although the  
issue of negotiation might sometimes a­  
void iiiis extremity, how often would it  
  
happen among so many S&#x27;ates, that an  
unaccommodating spirit in some would  
render that resource unavailing ? A con-  
  
trary supposition would not accord with a  
  
knowledge of human nature, or the evi­  
dence of our own political history.  
fc The Constitution, riot relying on any  
of the preceding modifications, for its  
safeahd successful operation, has express­  
ly declare!,-on the one hand 1. -&#x27;That

dary of jurisdictioubetweenFederal  
  
and. the State Governments, may beper  
mitted totefer to the thirty-ninth number  
of the Federalist,&#x27;&#x27;, for the light in  
which the subject was regarded by its  
writer at the period when the Constitu­  
tion was denendinE and it is beliexed,  
  
that the same was the prevailing view then  
taken of it that the same view has con­  
tinued to prevail, and that it does so at  
tliis time; notwithstanding the eminent  
exceptions to it.  
s Hut it is perfectly consistent with the  
concession of this power to the Supreme  
Court, in cases falling within the course  
of its functions, to maintain that the pow­  
er has not always been rightly exercised­  
To say nothing of the perioti, happily a  
short one, when Judges in their seats 1 id  
  
not abstain from intemperate and party  
harangues, equally at variance with their  
duty and their dignity ; there have been  
occasional decisions from thebench, which  
have incurred serious and extensive dis­  
approbation. Still it would seem, that,  
with, but few exceptions, the course of  
the Judiciary has been hitherto sustained  
  
by the predominant sense of the nation.  
Those who have tlenied or doubted the  
supremacy of the judicial power of the U­  
nited States, and denounce at the same  
time a nullifying power in a State, seem  
not to have sufficiently adverted to the  
utter inefficiency of a supremacy in a law  
of the land, without a supremacy in the  
exposition and execution of the law ; nor  
to the destruction of all equipoise between  
the Federal Government and the State  
Governments, if, whilst the functionaries  
of the Federal Government are directly or  
  
indirectly elected by and responsible to  
the States, and the functionaries of the;  
  
States are in their appointment and res­  
ponsibility wholly independent of the U­  
nited State, no constitutional control of  
any sort belonged to the United States o­  
vcr the States. Under such an organiza­  
tion, it is evident that it would be in the  
power of the..State, individually, to pass  
unauthorized laws, and to carry them in­  
to complete effect, any thing in the Con­  
stitution alid laws of the United States to  
  
the contrary notwithstanding. This would  
be a nullifying power in its plenary char­  
acter ; and whether it had its final effect  
through the Legislative, Executive, or Ju­  
diciary organ of the Slat-, would be e­  
quallv fatal to the constituted relation be­  
tween the two Governments.  
4 Should the provisions of the Constitu  
  
tion as here reviewed, he found not to se­  
cure the Government and rights of the  
States, against usurpations and abuses on  
the part of the United States, the final re­  
sort within the purview of the Constitu­  
tion, lies in an amendment ol the Consti­  
rution, according to a process applicable  
by the States  
And in the event of a failure of every  
  
constitutional report, and an accumula­  
tion of usurpations and abuses, rendering  
passive obedience and non resistance a  
greater evil, than resistance ami revolu­  
tion, there can remain but onesresort, the  
last of all ; an appeal from the cancelled  
obligations of the constitutional compact,  
to original rights and the law ofself-preservation.  
This is the itlfima ratio under  
  
all Governments, whether consolidated&#x27;,&#x27;!  
confederated, or a compound of both ; &amp;  
it cannot be doubted, that a single mem­  
ber of the Union, in the-extremity sup  
posed, but in that only would have a  
right, as an extra and ultra-constitutional  
right, to make the appeal.  
This brings us to the expedient lately  
advanced, which, claims for a single State  
a right to appeal against an exercise of  
power by tin? Government of the United  
States decided by the State to be uncon­  
stitutional, to the parties of the constitu  
  
tional compact : the decision of (he State  
  
to have the effect of nullifying the act of  
the Government of the United States,  
unless the decision of the State be reversed  
by three fourths of the parties. :  
The distinguished names and&#x27;high au­  
thorities which appear to have asserted  
and given a practical scope to this doc­  
trine, entitle it to a respect which it  
might be difficult otherwise to feel for it.  
If the doctrine were to be understood  
as requiring the three fourths of the State  
to sustain instead of that proportion to  
reverse the decision to the appealing  
  
State,, the. decision to- be without effect  
during the appeal, it would be sufficient  
to remark, that this extra constitutional  
course might well giVe way to that mark­  
ed out by th$ (Constitution, whichJiutho

nrst-principle oi ire goTeruiiieuu aoifiu  
practice necessarily overturn the Govern­  
ment itself. . &#x27; j  
It i tt be recollected that the - Con­  
stitution was, proposed to the people  
of. the State&quot; as n whole, and - unan­  
imously adopted by the States as a  
who!, it being a part of the Constitution  
that not less than three -fourths of the  
States should he competent. to make anv  
alteration in what had been unanimously  
agreed to. So great is the caution oir  
this point, that in two cases where pr-cu  
culiar interests were at stake, a propor­  
tion even of three fourths is -distrusted,  
and unanimity required to make analteration.7  
  
kVhen the Constitution Was adopted  
as a whole, it is certain that there were  
many pa; i,which, if separately proposed,  
would have been promptly rejected. It  
is far from impossible, that every part of  
a Constitution might be rejectedf by a mv  
  
jority, and yet takeu together as a, whole  
be&#x27;unanimously accepted. Free Constil  
tutions will rarely if ever be formed, with­  
out reciprocal concessions ; without arti­  
cles conditioned on -balancing: each other.  
Is there a Constitution of a single State  
tut of the twenty four that would bear  
the experiment of having its component  
parts submitted to the people and sepa­  
rately decided on ?  
What the fate of the Constitution of  
the United States would be if a small part  
of the States could expunge parts of it  
  
particularly valued by a large majority ,can  
have but one answer-  
The difficulty is not removed by lim­  
iting the doctrine to cases of construc­  
tion. &#x27;&#x27; How many cases of that sort, in­  
volving cardinal provisions of the Con­  
stitution, have occurred ? How many now  
exist ? How many may hereafter spring  
up ? How many might be ingeniously  
  
created, it entitled to the privilege of a  
decision in the mode proposed ?  
Is it certain that the principle of that  
mode would not reach further than is con­  
templated. If a single State can of right  
require three fourths of its co-States to o­  
verrule its exposition of the Constitution,  
because that proportion is authorized to  
to amend it, would the plea be less plau­  
sible that, as the Constitution was unan­  
imously established, it ought to be unan­  
imously expounded ?  
The reply to all such suggestions  
seems to be unavoidable and irresistible ;  
that the Constitution is a compact, that  
its text is to be expounded according to  
the provisions for expounding it making  
a part of the compact ; and that none of  
the parties can rightfully renounce the  
expounding provision more than any o­  
ther part. When such a right accrues,  
as may accrue, it must grow out of abu­  
ses of the compact realising the sufferers  
from their fealty to it. ,  
  
In favor rf the nullifying claim for  
the States individually, it appears, as&#x27;vou  
observe, that the proceedings -of the Le  
  
gislature ot Virginia in &#x27;98 and &#x27;99, a­  
gainst the Alien and Sedition Acts, are  
much dwelt upon.  
&#x27; It may often happen, as experience  
proves, that erroneous constructions not  
anticipated, may not be sufficiently guard­  
ed against, in language used 5 and it is  
due to the distinguished individuals, who  
have misconceived the intention of those  
proceedings, to suppose that the meaning  
of the Legislature, though well compre­  
hended at the time, may not now be ob­  
vious to those acquainted with the con-,  
temporary indications ami impressions.-  
&#x27;But it is believed that by keeping in  
view the distinction between the Govern­  
ments of the U. States. &amp; the States in the  
sense in which they were parties to the  
Constitution ; between the rights of the  
parties, in their concurrent and in their  
individual capacities : between&#x27; the seve  
  
ral modes and objects of interposition a­  
gainst the abuses of power, and especial­  
ly between interpositions within the pur­  
view of the Constitution, and f interposi­

the error, not uncommon, must be avoided, of

at moJel, the similitudes and analogies applicable  
t other systems of Government, it must, more  
than any oihrr, be its own interpreter according  
to its text and the facts of the case.  
From these it will tie seen that tne characterise  
it peculiarities of the Constitution are, 1, &#x27;lie  
audi of its formation : J- the division ef the su  
preme powers of Government between the Si ites  
in their united capacity, and the Slates in their  
individual capacities.  
1 . It was formed, not by tne uovei omenta ui  
the component States, as the federal Govern  
ment for which it was suDsiuuira was lormeo.  
Ntr was it formed by a majority of the pt-iple of  
lh United States, as a single community, in the  
maoner of a consolidated Government.  
It was formed by the States, that is, by the  
ewule in each ef the States, acting in their high-  
m sovereign capacity ; and formed Cunsrqm-ntly  
!by tbd same authority which formed the St te

&quot;e mdividnal States, co-ordinate, io  
  
all cases, with decisions under the authority of  
jthe United States, . would . unavoidably produce  
collisions incompatible with the peace of society,  
and with that regular and efficient administration)  
which is of the essence ot free governments.  
Scenes could not be avoided, in which a ministe­  
rial officer of tne United, and the correspondent  
officer of an individual State, would have ren­  
counters in executing conflicting degress ; the re­  
sult of which would depend on the comparative  
force of the local posses attending thorn; and  
that a casualty depending on the political opinions  
and party feelings in different States.  
To have referred every clashing decision, un­  
der the two authorities, for a final decision, to  
the States as parties to the Constitution, would  
be attended with delays, with inconveniences,  
and with expenses amounting to a prohibition of  
the expedient ; not to mention its tendency to  
impair the salutary veneration for a system re­  
quiring such frequent interpositions, nor the de­  
licate questions which might present themselves  
ns to the form of stating the appeal, and as to the  
quorum for deciding it.  
To have trusted to negotiation for adjusting  
disputes between the government of the United  
St ites and the State Governments, as between  
independent and &quot; separate sovereignties, would  
have lost sight altogeher of a constitution and  
government for the Union ; and opened a direct  
red from a failure of that resort, to the ultima  
ratio between nations wholly independent of and  
alien to e ich other. If the idea had its origin  
in the process of adjustment, between separate  
branches of the same government, the analogy  
entirely fails. &quot; In the case of disputes between  
independe.it parts of the same Government,  
neither part being able to consummate its will,  
nor the government to proceed without a concur­  
rence of Ike parts, necessity brings about an accom­  
modation. Io disputes between a State Govern­  
ment, and the Government of the United States,  
the case is practically as well as theoretically  
different; each party possessing all the depart­  
ments of an organized government, Legislative,  
Executive, and Judiciary; and having each a  
physical f.rce to support its pretensions. Al­  
though the issue of negotiation might sometimes  
avoid this extremity, how often would it happen,  
among so many States, that an unaccommodating  
spirit in some would render that resource unavail­  
ing? A contrary supposition would not accord  
wiih a knowledgo of human nature, or the evi­  
o&#x27;ence of eur own political history.  
The constitution, not relying on any of the pre­  
ceding modifications, for its safe and successful  
operation, has expressly declared, on the one  
hand, 1, &quot;that the constitution, and the laws  
made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties mnde  
unuer the authority of the United States; shall  
be the supreme law of the land ; 2, that the Judges  
of every State shall he bound thereby, any thing  
in the constitution and laws of any State to the  
contrary no withstanding ; 3, that the jndicial  
power of the United States shall extend to all  
cases in law and equity arising under the con­  
stitution, the laws of the United States, and trea­  
ties made under their authority, dec.&quot;  
On the other hand, as a security of the rights  
and powers of the States, in their individual  
rapacities, against an undue preponderance of the  
powers cr intcd to the government over them ia  
(heir united capacity, the constitution has relied  
o&quot;, 1, the responsibility of ihe Senators and  
Represent itives in, the Legislature of the United  
Slates to the Legislatures and people of the  
Uniied States; 2, the responsibility of the Pre­  
sident to the people of the United States; and 3,  
the liability of the Executive and judicial func­  
tionaries of the United States to impeachment  
by tht- Representatives of the people ef the  
Stales, in one branch of the Legislature of the  
Uniied States, and trial by the Representa­  
tives of the States, in the other branch; the State  
functionaries, Legislative, Executive, and Judi­  
cial, being, at the same time, in their appoint­  
ment and rrponsibility, altogether independent  
of the agency or authority of the United Su.fs.  
How far this structure of the Government  
of the United States is adequate und safe for its  
objects, time alone can absolutely determine.--Experience  
seems to have shown, that whatever  
may grow out of future stages of our national ca­  
reer, there is, as yet, a sufficient control in the  
popular will, over the Executive and Legislative  
Departments of the government. When the  
Alien and Sedition Laws were passed in con  
  
travention to the opinions and feelings of the  
community, the first elections that ensued put  
an end to them. And whatever may have been  
the character of other acts, in the judgment of  
many of us, it is but true that they have general­  
ly accorded with the views ef the majority of  
the States and of the people. At the present  
day it seems well understood, that the laws  
which have created most dissatisfaction, have  
had a like sanction without doors; and that  
whether continued, varied, or repealed, a like  
proof will be given of the sympathy and respon­  
sibility of the Representative body to the consti­  
tuent body. Indeed, tho great complaint now  
is, against the results of this sympathy and re  
sponsibility in the Legislative policy cf the  
nation.  
With respect to the judicial power of the Uni­  
ted States, and the authority of the Supreme  
Court in relation to the boundary of jurisdiction  
between the Federal and the. State Govern­  
ments, I may be permitted to refer to the thirty­  
ninth number of the Federalist,&quot; for the light  
in which the subjoct was regarded by its writer,  
at the period when the Constitution was pend

ing; and it is believed that the, same was the  
prevailing view then taken of, it, that the sane  
view lias continued to prevail, and that it does  
so at this time, notwithstanding the eminent ex­  
ceptions to it.  
. But It is perfectly consistent with the conces­  
sion of this power to the Supreme Court, in cases  
falling within the course-of its functions, to main­  
tain that the power has not always been rightly  
exercised. To say nothing of the period, happi­  
ly a shnrt one, when Judges in their seats did not  
abstain from intemperate and party harangues,  
equally at variance with their duty and their dig­  
iiity ; there have been occasional decisions from  
the bench, which have incurred scrions and ex­  
tensive disapprobation. Still it would seem, that,  
with but few exceptions, the course of the Judi­  
ciary has been hitherto sustained by the predo­  
minant sense of the nation.  
Those who have denied or doubted the supre­  
macy of the judicial power of the United States,  
and denounce at the same time a nullifying pow­  
er in a Sute, seem not to have sufficiently ad­  
verted to the utter inefficiency of supremacy  
in a law of the tand, without a supremacy in the  
exposition and execution of the law; nor to the  
destruction of all equipoise between the Federal  
Government and the State Governments, if,  
whilst the functionaries of the Federal Govern­  
ment are directly or indirectly elected by and  
responsible to the States, and the functionaries  
of the States are in their appointment and re­  
sponsibility wholly independent of the United  
States, no constitutional control of any sort be­  
longed to the United States over the States.  
Under such an organization, it is evident that  
it would be in the power of the States, indivi­  
dually, to pass unauthorized laws, and to carry  
them into complete effect, any thing in the  
Constitution and laws of the United States to  
the contrary notwithstanding. This would be  
a nullifying fower in its plenary character ; and  
whether it had its final effect, through the Legis­  
lative, Execuiive, or Judiciary organ of the State,  
would be equally fatal to the constituted relation  
between the two Governments.  
Should the provisions of tho Constitution, as  
here reviewed, be found not to secure the Go­  
vernment and rights of the States, against usur­  
pations and abuses on the part of tho United  
States, the final resort within the purview of the  
Constitution, lies in an amendment of the Con  
slitution, according to a process applicable by  
the States.  
And in the event of a failure of every consti­  
tutional resort, and an accumulation of usurpa­  
tions and abuses, rendering passive obedience  
and non-resistance a greater evil than resistance  
and revolution, there can remain but one resort,  
the last of 11 ; an appeal from the cancelled  
obligations of the constitutional compact, to ori­  
ginal rights and the law of self preservation.  
This is the ultima ratio under the all Govern­  
ments, whether consolidated, confederated, or  
a compound of both; and it cannot be doubted  
that a single member of the Union, in the exH  
trenntv supposed, but in that only, would have a  
right, as an extra and ultra-constitutional right,  
to make the appeal.  
This brings us to the expedient lately ad­  
vanced, whir-h claims for a single State a right  
to appeal against an exercise of power by the  
Government of the United States, decidod by  
th State to be unconstitutional, to the parties  
to the constitutional compart; the decision of  
the Sine tit have the effect of nullifying the act  
of the Government of the United States, unless  
the derision of the State be reversed by three­  
fourths of he parties.  
The distinguished names and high authorities  
which appear to have asserted and given a pra­  
ticnl scope to this doctrine, entitle it to a respect  
which it might be difficult otherwiso to feel for  
it.  
If the doctrine were to be understood aa re­  
quiring the three fourths of the States to sustain,  
instead of that proportion to reverse the decision  
of the appealing State, the decision to be with­  
out effect during the appeal, it would be sufficient  
to remark, that this extra-constitutional course  
might well give way to that marked out by the  
constitution, which authorizes two thirds of the  
Slates to institute and three fourths to effectuate  
aa amendment of the constitution, establishing  
a permanent rule of the highest authority, in  
place of an irregular precedent of construction  
only.  
But it is understood that the nullifying doc­  
trine imports that the decision of the State is  
to be presumed valid, and that it overrules tbe  
law of the United States, unless overruled by  
three fourths of the States.  
Can more be necessary to demonstrate tho  
inadmissibility of such a doctrine, than that it  
puts it iu the power of the smallest fraction ever  
one fourth of the United Stales, that is, of seven  
States out of twenty-four, to give tho law and  
even the constitution to seventeen States, each  
of the seventeen having, as parties to tho consti­  
tution, an equal right with each of the seven, to  
expound it, and to insist on the exposition T  
That tho seven might, in particular instances, be  
right, and the seventeen vrong, is more than pos­  
sible. But to establish a positive and permanent  
rule giving such a power, to such a minority, over  
such a majority, would overturn the first prin­  
ciple of free government, and in practice neces­  
sarily overturn the Government itself.  
It is to be recollected that the constitution was  
proposed to the people of the States as a whole,  
and unanimously adopted by the State as a whole,  
it being a part of the constitution, that not less  
than three fourths of the States should be com­  
petent to make any alteration in what had been  
unanimously agreed to. So great is the caution  
on this point, that in two cases where peculiar  
interests were at stake, a proportion even of  
three fourths is distrusted, and unanimity required  
to make an alteration.  
When the constitution was adopted as a whole,  
it is certain that there were many parti, which,  
if separately proposed, would have been prompt­  
ly selected. It is far from impossible, that every  
part ef a cenititutiso might. fcs rejected by a I  
  
majority, and yet taken together as a whole be  
unanimously accepted. Freo constitutions will  
rarely if ever be formed, without reciprocal con­  
cessions: without article! conditioned on and  
  
balancing each other&#x27;. , Is there a constitntion of  
a single State out of the twenty-four that would  
bear the experiment of having Us compoaent  
parts submitted to the people and senaratcly de­  
cided on f . , .  
- What the fate of the constitution of tW Uni­  
ted States would be if a small proportion of the  
States could expunge parts of it particularly  
valued by. a large majority, can have but one  
answer.  
The difficulty is not removed by limiting the  
doctrine to cases of construction. How many  
cases of that sort, involving cardinal nio visions  
of the constitution have occurred 1 How many  
nowexist? how many may hereafter spring upT  
How many might be ingeniously created, if en­  
titled to the privilege of a decision in the mode  
proposed 1  
Is it certain that the principle of that mode  
would not reach further than is contemplate ).  
If a single State can of right require three fourths  
of its co-States to overrule its exposition of the  
constitution, because that proportion is authorised  
to amend it, would the plea be less plausible that,  
as the constitution was unanimously established,  
it ought to be unanimously expounded!  
The reply to all such suggestions seems to be  
unavoidable and irresistible ; that the constitu­  
tion is a compact, that its text is to be expounded  
according to the provisions for expounding it­  
making a part of the compact ; and that none of  
the parties can rightfully renounce the expound­  
ing provision more than any other part. When  
such a right accrues, as may accrue, it must grew  
out of abuses of the compact releasing the suf­  
ferers from their fealty to it.  
In favor of the nullifying claim for the States,  
individually, it appears, as you observe, that tbe  
proceedings of the Legislature of Virginia, in  
&#x27;98, and in &#x27;99, against the Alien and Sedition  
Acts, are much dw.lt upon.  
It may often happen, as experience proves,  
that erroneous constructions not anticipated, may  
not be sufficiently guarded against, in the lan­  
guage used ; and it is due to the distinguished  
individuals, who have misconceived the intention  
of those proceedings, to suppose that the mean­  
ing of the Legislature, though well compre­  
hended at the time, may not now bo obvious to  
those unacquainted with the contemporary indi­  
cations and impressions.  
But it is believed that by keeping io view tho  
distinction between the Governments ef the  
States, and the States in the sense in which they  
were &#x27; parties to the constitution ; between tho  
rights of the parties, in their concurrent and in  
their individual capacities; between the several  
modes and objects of interposition against the  
abuses of power, and especially between interpo  
sitions within the purview of the constitution.  
and interpositions appealing from the constitu­  
tion to the rights of nature paramount to all con  
stitutions; with an attention, always ol expla­  
natory use to the views and arguments which  
were combated, the Resolutions of Virginia,  
as vindicated in the Report on them, will be  
found entitled to an exposition, showing a con­  
sistency in their parts, and an inconsistency of  
tho whole with the doctrine under consideration.  
That the Legislature could not have intended  
to sanction such a doctrine, is to be inferred  
from the debates in the house f Delegates, and  
from the address of the two houses to their con­  
stituents, on the subject of tho Resolutions.  
The tenor of the debates, which were ably con­  
ducted and are understood to have been revised  
for the press by most, if not all, of the speakers,  
discloses no reference whatever to a constitution­  
al right of an individual State, to arrest by force  
the operation of a law of tbe United States.  
Concert among the States for redress against the  
Alien and Sedition Laws, as acts of usurped  
pott er, was a leading sentiment ; and the attain­  
ment of a concert the fcmnediate object of the  
course adopted by the Legislature, which was  
that of inviting the other S&#x27;.ates &quot;to concur in  
declaring the acts to be unconstitutional, and to  
co-operate by the necessary and proper measures  
in maintaining unimpaired the authorities, rights  
and liberties reserved to the States respectively  
and to the people.&quot;  
That by the necessary and proper measures to  
bo concurrently and co-operatively taken, were  
meant measures known to tho constitution, par­  
ticularly the ordinary control of the people and  
Legislatures of the States, over the Government  
of the United States, cannot be doubted: and tho  
interposition of this control, as the event showed,  
was equal to tbe occasion.  
It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of  
the intontions of the Legislature, that the words  
&quot; not law, but utterly null, void of no force or  
effect,&quot; which had followed in one of the Reso­  
lutions, the word &quot; unconstitutional,&quot; were struck  
out by common consent. Though the words  
were in-fact btt syoonymous with &quot;unconstitu­  
tional yet to guard against a misunderstanding  
of this phrase as more than declaratory of opi­  
nion, the word &quot; unconstitutional&quot; alone was re­  
tained, as tot liable to that danger.  
The published Address of the Legislature to  
the people, their constituents, affords another  
conclusive evldenca of its views. The Address  
warns them against the encroaching spirit of the  
General Government, argues the unconstitution­  
ality of tho Alien and Sedition Acts, points to  
other instances in which the constitutional limits  
had been overleaped ; dwells upon the dangerous  
mode of deriving power by implication ; and ia  
general, presses tho necessity of watching Aver  
the consolidating tendency of the Federal policy.  
But nothing is said that can be understood to look  
to means of maintaining the rights of tht States,  
beyond the regular ones, within the forms of tho  
constitution.  
If any further lights on the subject could be  
needed, a very stiong one is reflected in the an­  
swers to tho Resolutions, by the States which  
See tbe concluding Resolution, cl 1708.  
  
VOL. 111.-10.110.  
  
protestea against mem. l he mam objection ot  
these, btyond a few general complaints , ef lh  
inflammatory tendency of the Resolutions, was  
directed against the assumed authority of a State  
Legislature to declare a law of the United Statet  
unconstitutional, which thev nrnnnn -( an un  
warrantable interference with tht exclusive ju  
risdiction of the Supreme Court of tht &#x27; United  
States. . Had the, Resolutions been regarded as  
avowing and maintaining a right, in aa individual  
State, to arrest, by force the execution of a law  
of the United States, it must be presumed that it  
would have been a conspicuous object &#x27; of their .  
denunciation. ;  
With cordial salutation&#x27;s, . t

#### 1830-10-28 &middot; [Martinsburg, Va. [W. Va.]](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martinsburg%2C_West_Virginia)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Dear Sir: J have duly received your letter,  
in which you refor t® tha “nullifying do tArtfte,’  
advocated a* a constitutional right, hy vmn  
of our distinguished fellow citizens; and to  
the proceedings «»• the \ irgini.v I .egi-l iture in  
»gg_Append to in t&gt;* hftll of tii«U «ioa­  
trine: and you exprew a wish for my ideas  
on the&#x27;*&#x27; subjects. ......  
I ant aware of the delieacv of the task in  
»ome respect*, and the difficulty in every res  
pud, of doing justice to it I5ut, haring, in  
more than oneinsUncc, complied with a like  
request from other friendly quarters, I do  
not decline a sketch of the views which I  
have been lei to take of the doctrine in ques­  
tion, a» well a* some others connected with  
them; and of th* ground* from winch it ap­  
Eear* that the proceedings of Virginia have  
een misconceived by lho&gt;e who have appeal­  
ed to them. In ortr r to understand the true  
character of the Constitution of the United  
Stales, the error, not uncommon, must lie a­  
voided, of viewing it through the medium,  
either of a confederated Government, whilst  
it is neither the *uc nor ttie other; but a mix­  
ture of both. And having, in no model, the  
similitudes and analogies applicable t&lt;* other  
systems of Govermn nt, it must, more than  
any ether, be its own interpreter according  
to its text and the feet* oj the cue*.  
From these it will be -seen that the char­  
acteristic pecularities of the Constitution are,  
1, the inode ef its formation, 2, the division  
of the suprem* power&quot; of Government be­  
tween the States in their united capacity,and  
the States in their individual capacity.  
1. ft was found, not by the Governmants  
of the component Sl ates, as lh&lt;- Federal Go  
▼eminent lor which it was substituted was  
formed. Nor was it formed by a majority of  
the people ef the United Slates, rs a single  
community, in the manner of a consolidated  
Government.  
It was formed bv the States, that is, by the  
Ceople in each of the States, acting in their  
ighest sovereign capacity, and formed con­  
sequently hy tiie same authority which form­  
ed ihe State constitution.  
I) d ag thus derived from the same source  
ns the constitutions of the States, it has, with &#x27;  
in each Slate, the same authority as the con  
stitution of the State; and is as much a con­  
stitution, in the strict sense of the. terra, with |  
to its prescribed sphere, as the constitutions ;  
of the Slat*&#x27;* are, within their respective, j  
spheres: bid with this obvious and essential i  
difference, that being a compact among the  
totaies in their highest sovereign capacity,  
srid constituting the people thereof one peo- j  
.pie for oertain purposes, it cannot he altered j  
or annulled at the wdl of I be Slates indivitiu-1  
ally, as the constitution of a S.ale miy be at j  
its individual will.  
2 And that it divides the supreme powers  
of Government, between the Government of  
the United States, and the Governments of  
the individual Slates, is stamped on the face  
of th* instrument; the powers of war and of  
taxation, nf commerce amt of treaties, and  
wther enumerated powers * &gt; sled »n the Gov- j  
eminent of the United Slates, being of as  
high and sovereign a character, as any ol the  
powers reserved to the State Governments, i  
Nor is the Government ol thu United States,  
created hy the constitution, h vs a Govern- j  
went in the strict sense ol the term, within  
-the sphere of its powers, than the Govern-.  
created hv the constitutions of the  
States are, within their several spheres. It  
is like them organized into Legislative. Exe­  
cutive, and Judicipiy Departments If opt- (  
rates, like them, directly on persons and  
things. And, like them, it has at command  
a physical for excepting the powers commit­  
ted to it. The concurrent operation m.cer­  
tain coses, is one of the features making the  
peculiarity of the system.  
Between these, different constitutional Go­  
vr laments, the on* operating in all the States,  
the other operating separately in each, with  
the aggregate powers of Government divided  
between them, it could not escape attention,  
that controversies would arise concerning the  
boundaries of jurisdiction; and that some  
provision ought to be made for such occur­  
reaees. A political system that does not pro  
vide for a peaceable and authoritive termina­  
tion of occurring controversies, would net fee  
Mere than the shadow of a Govermneat; the  
object and *nd of a real Government being,  
the substitution of law and order, for uncer­  
tainty, contusion, and violence.  
Thatto bare left a tiual decision, in suds  
cases, to each of the Slates, then thirteen,  
and already twenty-four, could not fail to  
make the constitution and laws of ihc United  
State* different in different States, was ob­  
vious; and not less obvious, that this di­  
versity of iuJ&#x27; pendent decisions must aito­  
g &#x27;h&#x27;-r distract the Government of the Union,  
and speedily put an end to th* Union itself.  
A uniform authority of the laws, is in itself a  
vital piincipie. Some of the most important  
la * s could not be partially executed. &#x27;They  
mud fee executed in all liie Stales, or they  
could be ddy executed in none. An impost,  
or an exercise, for example, if not in force  
some States, would be defeated in others,—  
It is well known that this was among the les­  
sons *1 experience, which had a primary i:i­  
tlnence in bringing about the existing consti­  
tution. A fos- of its general authority would  
moreover revive the exasperating questions  
between the States holding ports far foreign  
commerce, and the adjoining Stales without  
them; to which are now added, all the inland  
States, necessarily carrying on their loreigu  
commerce through other Sdutcs.  
To have made the decisions under the au­  
thority of the individual States, co-ordinate,  
in all cases, with decisions under the author­  
ity of the Uniter! States, would unavoidably  
produce collisions incompatible with the  
peace of society, and with that regular and  
efficient administration, which i* of the es­  
sence of free governments. Scenes could  
not be avoided, in which a ministerial officer  
of the U S. mid the correspondent officer of  
an individual State, would have rencounter*  
in executing conflicting decrees; the result  
of which would depend on the comparative  
force of the local past * attending them; and  
that a casualty depending on th.- pu&#x27;ifL.il o  
pinions and party &lt;Vtiu&amp;» i.i different Js&#x27;xiex  
To have referred every clashing decision,  
under the two authorities, for aliaal decision,  
to the 8fotcs as parii&gt; s to the Constitution,  
.would he *ff tended wnb delays, with iacon

and opened a dire.ct road trysn * fad orb ol

tions vsirollr independent of and ahon to each

tirely fads. In tb : case of disputes between

| the issue of negotiation ought sometimes a  
void thin extremity, how often would it hap­  
pen, among so tinny States, that an unae  
commodating spirit in some would render  
that resource unavailing&#x27;* A contrary suppo  
I sition would not accord with a knowledge oi  
human nature, or the evidence tl&#x27; our own  
political history.  
The constitution, not-relying on any ol the  
preceding modification*, lot it* safe and suc­  
cessful operation, has expressly declared, on  
the one hand, i, “(hat the constitution, ami  
the laws made in pursuance thereof, tail all  
treaties mode under the authority of the IJ­  
u&#x27;tcd States, shall be the supreme law of tin­  
land; 2, that the Judges of every State shall  
he bound thereby, anv thing in the eoivstitu  
tion and laws of any State to the contrary  
notwithstanding; 3. that the judical power oi  
the United States shall extend to all cases in  
law anil equity arising under the constitution,  
the laws &lt;d the U nited States, and treaties  
t»Rile under their authotity, c- &#x27;-”  
On the other hand, a* a security of the  
rigbls and powers of the States, in their indi­  
vidual capacities against ail undue preponde­  
rance of the powers granted to the govern  
inent over them in their united capacity, the  
constitution lias relied on, 1, tho respeiisihil  
ity of the Senators aud UejM-escntatives in  
the Legislaturo of the United States to the  
Legislatures and people of the United States;  
2, responsibility ol the President to the peo­  
ple of the United States; and A, the liability  
of the Executive and juiliei d functionaries of  
(’he United States toimjie.n liintut by theltc­  
prcsenlativcs of the. people of the Stales, in  
one branch of the Legislature of the l nited  
States, and trial by Representative* of the  
State- , in the other branch, the State func­  
tionaries, Legislative, Executive, am! Judi­  
cial, being, at the same time, in their ap­  
pointment and responsibility, altogether inde­  
pendent of the agency or authority of the U­  
tsiti d States.  
ilow far this structure of the Government  
of the United States is adequate and sale for  
its objects, time alone can absolutely deter­  
mine.—Experience seems to have shown,  
that whatever may grow.out of future stage,  
of our national career, there is,as &gt;. t, u s it  
ficient control in the popular will, over the  
Executive -and Legislative Departments of  
the government.—When the Alien and Sedi  
turn Laws were passed in contravention to  
tin* opinions and feelings of the community,  
ii* mat ejections that ensued put an cad to  
them. And whatever may have been (be  
character of other acts, iu the judgment ol  
many of us, it is but true that they have ge­  
nerally accorded with the views of the ins.  
jorrty of the tate and of the people. At the  
present day.lt seems well understood, that  
the laws which have created most dissatislac  
tion, have had a like sanction out of doors;  
and that whether continued, varied, or re­  
pealed. a like proof will be giv en of the sym­  
pathy and responsibility of tlu Il.-prescntu  
live body to the constilutcnt body. Indeed,  
♦he great complaint now is against thcrosults  
of this sympathy and responsibility in the  
Legislative policy of the nation.  
With respect to the judicial power of the  
United -States, and the authority of tho Su  
preme Court in relation to the boundary of  
jurisdiction between tbe Federal ai d State  
, Governments, I may be permitted to refer  
♦o the thirty ninth number of the •‘Federal­  
ist,&quot;* for the light iu which the subject was  
regarded by its writer, at (lie period when  
tbe Constitution was pending; and it is be­  
lieved that the &gt;a:ne was the prevailing view  
then taken ol it, that the saiue view has con  
tinned to prevail, and that it does mi at this  
time, notwithstanding tho eminent excep­  
tions to it.  
But it i* perfectly consistent with the con­  
cession of this power to tho Supreme Court,  
in e ases falling within the course of its I unc­  
tions, to maintain that the power hat cot al­  
ways been rightly exercised- To say nothing  
of tho period, happily a short our, vilicn  
Judges in their scats did not abstain from  
i«temperate and party harangues, equally  
at variance with their duty and their dignity;  
there have beeu occasional decisions from  
the bench, which have incurred serious and  
extensive disapprobation.—(Still it would seem,  
that, vvith but levy exceptions, the course ol  
the Judiciary ha* been hitherto su-duiucti by  
the predominant reuse of tbe nation.  
■Those who have denied or doubted the su  
pre.raacy ol the judicial power of (he United  
Males, anil denounce at the same time a nul­  
lifying power in a State, seem not to have  
sufficiently adverted to tho utter inefficiency  
ot a supremacy in a law of the land without a  
supremacy iu the exposition ami execution o

such a majority, would overturn the. first  
principle ol live Government, and in prac­  
tice, necessarily oveiriiiu the Government it­  
! self.  
It is tol)c*reco]l“ctcd lliat the Constitution  
was pioposed to the I’cople of the Matt s as  
h whole, and unanimously adapted hr Ihe  
States as « it being a p irt of the. Con­

&#x27;point, trial iu two cases where peculiar inter­  
ests were at stake, a proportion oven of  
tkres fourths is distrusted, and unanimity re  
quired to make an alteration.  
V\ hen the Constitution was adopted as a  
whole it is ccttain that there were many  
parts, which, if separately proposed, would  
have been promptly rejected. It is far from  
impossible, that every part of a Constitution  
might be rejected by u majority, unu yat. ta­  
ken together as a whole, be unanimously ac­  
cepted. Kl ee Constitutions will rarely, if rv­  
I ev, be formed, w ithout reciprocal concessions;  
without articles conditioned on and balanc­  
ing each other. Is there a Constitution of a  
siugle State of the twent) four, tliat would  
bear the experiment of having its component  
part*, submitted to the People, and separate­  
ly decided on?  
V\ hat. the fate of the Constitution of the  
, Uni i d Mates would be, if so small a pro  
portion of the State* would expunge pails of  
it p uticuUrly v alued by a large majority,  
can have but one answer.  
| The difficulty is not removed by limiting  
the doctrine to cas« » of construction. How  
many eases of that sort, involving cardinal  
prov isions ot the Constitution, have occurred.1  
&#x27; How many now exist? How many may  
hereafter spring up? How many might he in­  
geniously created, ifentdied to the privilege  
of a decision in ihe mode proposed?  
Is it certain that the prineijple of that mode  
would uot reach further than is contemplated?  
!i a single Mato can of right require Ibree­  
!fourths of its co Mates to overrule its expo­  
Vition of the Constitution, because, that pro­  
portion is authorized to amend it, vvi u!d the  
jplea be lr-s plan ible that, us the Con«titu  
jtl &gt;n was unanimously established, it ought  
I to be ummmou-ly expounded?

» sarve, that tha proceeding* of d»e Legiaiatnre  
of Virginia, »r. 1*8 -xml *W. against the Aden  
and Sedition Act*, are nau&quot;h dwelt upon.  
Itinav often happen, a* experience proves,  
that erroneous construction* not anticipated  
miT not he sutSeientiy guarded against, tn  
the language used; and it is due to the dis­  
tinguished individuals, who have mwconccjv­

pose that the meaning of the Lefer mture.  
though well comptehcndc.d at the time. maj  
| not now he obvious (a those nnaeq nmted  
iriili the contemporary indication, and im­  
pressions.  
But it is believed, that, by keeping in view  
the distinction between the Governments ol  
the States, and the States in the sense, ia  
which they were parties to the Cwistitutiiii;  
hetweeu the rights of the parties, in their con­  
errrent and individual capacities ; between  
(tie fcveral modes and objects ol interposi­  
tion against the abuses ol power, and espe­  
cially between interpositions within the pur­  
view of the Oonst i tut ion, and interpositions  
appealing from the. Constitution-to the rights  
of nature paramount to all Constitution#;  
with an attention always of explanatory one,  
to the views and urguinctffs which were  
combatted, the. Resolutions of Virginia, as  
vindicated in the Report on them, will be  
found entitled to an exposition, showing a  
consistency in their parts, and an inconsis­  
tency of the whole with the doctrine under  
consideration.  
That the. Legislature could not have in­  
tended to sanction such a doctrine is to be in­  
i lerred from the debates in the House ti Ue­  
| legates, and from tlie address of the two H®n  
ses to their constituents, on the subject ol  
the resolutions The tanor of the debates,  
which were aldy condncted, and are under  
stood to have been revised for the press by  
ino t, if not all, of the speakers, discloses ru;  
reference whatever to h constituti &gt;nul right  
in nii individual Stale, to arrest hy lerce the  
operation of the law of the l J State*. Conceit  
among the States for redress against the  
Alien and Sedition Laws, as acts of usurped  
power, was a leading sentiment; and the at

/ control ol the people and Legislatures ol - inr  
j State# over the Government of the United  
| States, cannot be doubted: and the interposi­  
tion ®f this control, as the e\ ent sliswcd was  
•equal to the occasion.  
11 i« worthy of remark and explanatory of  
the intentions of tlie Legislature, that the  
words, -not taw, but utterly mill and void,  
and of no force or effect,” tvhi.it had Iblhvw­  
e 1, in one of the resolutions, (he words “«n­  
j constitutional,” was struck out h\ &#x27;ormaon  
I consent, Though the word* were, in fact,  
synonymous with “u.won stili:: no,&gt;.t,” yet to  
guard against a in:.,understanding of this  
jdirase as mori decluraloiy of opinion, the  
word &quot;wnconstitutiori.d” ulor.e was retained,  
&#x27; as not liable to that danger.  
Tlie published Vddress of the Legislature­  
»:f the People, their colistitu nts. affords ano­  
ther conclusive evi.i i ce. of its views. 1&#x27;he.  
Address warns them against the encroaching  
spirit of-the Genera! Government, argut ■ the  
uncenstituiionaiity of the Mien and Sedition  
Acts,points to other instances in which tire  
(onotitutional limits hud been overlenjved;  
dwells upon the dangerous mode ol deriving  
i power by implication; anti in general presv v  
; flic nee.-ssity of watching over the consoli  
i &gt;1 ting tendency of the Federal policy. But  
nothing is said that can be understood to !o»k  
&#x27; to means in maintaining the lights oi the  
. States, beyond tlie regular ones, within the  
j forms of the Constitution.  
if any further lights or the subject could  
! tv needed, a very strong one is reflected in  
the answ ers to the Resolutions, by the Slates  
&#x27; which protested against them. The main  
1 objection «f these, beyond a f«wgeneraloo’.u­  
! plaint* of the inflammatory tendency of the  
i Resolutions, was directed against tlie assurn­  
&#x27; ed authority of a State Legislature to de­  
Haro a law of the United States unconstitu­  
tional. which they pronounced an unwar­  
rantable interference with the exclusive ju­  
risdiction of live Supreme Court of die Uni­  
ted Slate*. Had the Re* ilutions been re­

Montpelier, Jlugust 1830.— Dear Sir; 1  
have duly received your letter, iu which you  
refer to the “ nullilving doctrine,’&#x27;advocated  
as coiintiliiiioniil right, by some of our distin­  
guished fellow citizens ; and to the proceed­  
ings of tlio Virginia Legislature in &#x27;1)8 and  
iK’&gt; as appealed to in behalf of that docliinc •  
and you express a wish for my ideas on those  
subjects.  
I am aware of the delicacy of the task in  
somo respects, and the difficulty in every re­  
spect, of doing lull justice to it. lint, ha vino  
in more than one instance, complied with°n  
like request from other friendly quarters, I  
do not decline a sketch of the viewsWhich I  
have been led to take of the doctrine in  
question, ns well ns&#x27; sonic others connected  
with them i and of the ground from which it J  
appears that the proceedings of Virginia  
have been misconceived by those who&#x27;ll* ve  
appealed to them. In order to understand  
the true character of the Constitution of the  
United States, the error, not uncommon,  
must be avoided, of viewing it. through the  
medium, cither of a consolidated Govern­  
ment, or of a confederated Government,  
whilst ii is neither the ono nor the other ;  
but a mixture of both. And having, in  
model, tlio similitudes and analogies applica­  
ble to other systems of Government, it must,  
moro than any other, be its own interpreter,  
according to Us text and the facts of the case.  
I rum these it will bo seen, that the th.i­  
racloriHiic peculiarities of the Constitution  
arv *&gt; l*,c mode ot iu formation ; 2, tl«o di­  
vision ot the supreme powers of Government  
between their Mute* intboir united capaci.  
ly, and the States in their individual capaci­  
ties. 1  
  
i. ii wuh lorinou, not by the Governments  
&lt;&gt;» the component States, as the Federal Gov­  
erunienis ot llio component Slates, asllio Fe­  
deral Government lor winch it was substitu­  
ted was formed. Nor was it formed by a  
majority of the people ol the United States,  
as a single community, in the maiinct of a  
consolidaled Government.  
&gt; It was formed by toe Stater, that is. by the  
I eojde in each of tiiu States, acting iri their  
highest, sovereign capacity ; and formed con­  
sequently, by the same authority which form,  
ed the State Constitutions.  
iJeing^ thus derived from the same source  
as the Constitutions of the Stales, il has,  
williiri each Slate, the samu authority as the  
Constitution of ihp Stale; and is ns much a  
Constitution, in the strict sense of the term,  
within its prescrib&#x27;d sphere, os the Constitu­  
tions ol the State* are, within their respective  
spheres: but with this obvious and essential  
uittorenee, tlint, bein&#x27; a compact among the  
&amp;lute* in their highest sovereign capacity,  
&lt;V constituting Hie people thereof one people  
for certain purposes, it cun.ml he altered or  
annulled at tiie will of the States individual,  
ly, as the Constitution ot a Suite may be at  
its individual will.  
*2. And that it divides tbe supreme powers  
of Goveiiiiiient, between the Government of  
the I tilled States, and the Governments of  
individual stales, is stamped on the fiice of  
the instrument; the powers of war and ot  
taxation, ol commerce, and «»f treaties, and  
other enumerated power* vested in the Gov­  
ernment of the U. States, being of as high  
and sovereign a character as any of the  
powers reserved to the State Governments.  
Nor is the Government of the United  
States, created by the Constitution, less a  
Government in the strict seas* of the term,  
  
wiUiin the sphere of ||B power9, than the  
G iv-rn:i»ents created by the Constitution of  
Ih.. M.tt&quot;* are, w.ibin their several spheres  
It ih like tlie.-n organised into Legislative.  
Cxecutivo, nod Judiciary Departments It  
•iporates, like them, directly or. persons end  
tilings. And, like them il has at command  
a physical three (hr executing the powers1  
committed to it. The concurrent operation m  
certain casos, is one of the features marking  
tho peculiarity of the system  
Between them different Constitutional  
Governments; tho one operating in all tl*o *  
Mules, tho others operating separately in  
each, with the aggregate powers of Govern­  
ment divided between them, it pautd not es.  
I cape attention, tho controversies would a  
rise concerning the boundaries of jurisdm!  
lion-; and that some provision ought to hn  
made for such Occurrences. A political sys­  
tem tint ones not provide fot it peaceable  
and authoritative termination of occummr  
controversies, would not bo moro tlnn tho  
shadow of a government ; tho object and .  
oud of a real Government being the suhstitu-!  
lion of law and order, for uncertainty, Coiifu.  
: sion, ami violence.  
j 1 hat to have left a final decision, in such  
| cases, to each of the States, then thirteen,  
; and already 21, could not fail to uiako the  
Constitution and laws of the United Staler  
different in dillerenl states. Was obvious; an 1  
not less obvious, that this diversity of imto  
pendent decisions must altogether dislrsc  
the Government of the Union, and speedily  
put an cud to the Union itself. A unit tr.it  
authority of the laws is iu itself a vital prm  
ciple. Sumo of the most important taws,  
could not be partially executed. They inns  
be executed in all tho Mates, or they coul i  
bo duly executed in none. An impost, or an  
excise, for example, il not in force iu some  
Matos, would ho defeated in others. Il is  
well known that this wus among tho lessons  
of experience, which had a primary influence  
in bringing about the existing Constitution.  
A loss of its general authority would moruo  
ver revive the exasperating questions be­  
tween the blutes hulding ports lor foreign  
commerce, and the adjoining States without  
them ; to which are now added all the inland  
States necessarily currying on their foreign  
commerce through ollioi States.  
To have made tile decisions under tho au­  
thority of tho individual Stales, co-ordinate,  
in all cases, with decisions under tini autho­  
rity of the United Stales, would unavoidably j  
produce c-llmons incompatible with tho  
peace of society, and with that regular and  
eliteicnladministration which is the essence  
ol free government. Scones could not he a­  
vmded, in which u ministerial olticer of the  
United States, and the correspondent officer  
of an individual Slate, would liavo rencoun­  
ters in executing conflicting decrees ; the ru­  
sult of which would depeiiu ou tho compara­  
tive force of the local posses attending luem; i  
and that, a casualty depending on the point- !  
cal opinions uud patty feelings in different  
Si.ites.  
  
lotiavo returreu every clashing decision, |  
under the two autliorilies, for a final deci­  
sion, to the States, us parlies to the Consti­  
tution, would be attended with delays, with  
inconveniences,and with expenses, amount,  
ing ton prohibition ol tho expedient; not to  
mention its tendency to impair tlie sanitary  
veneration for a system requiring such iro­  
qnenl interpositions, nor tiic delicate ques­  
tions which might present themselves as to  
the form of staling the appeal, and us to Ihu  
quorum for deciding it.  
To have trusted to negotiation lor adjust­  
ing disputes between llio Government ot&#x27; tno  
United Mates and the Mute Governments, as  
| between independent and separate sovereign,  
lies, would have Inst sight altogether ol a  
Constitution and Government foi the Union ;  
and opened a diiuct road fiom a failure ot  
that rosort to the ultima ratio between na­  
tions wholly independent of an alien to each  
oilier. If the idea had its origin in Ihu pro­  
cess of adjustment, between separate branch­  
es ol the same government, in- analogy on.  
tirely fails. In the case of disputes between  
the independent parts ol the same govern,  
iner.t, neither part being able to consuiuiualo  
its will, nor the government to proceed with­  
out a concurrence of the parts, necessity  
brings about mi accommodation. In disputes  
between a State Government and tho Gov­  
ernment of llio United Matos, the ense is  
praeticnlly as well ns theoretically dift&#x27;erent,  
each party possessing all the departments ot  
an organized government, legislative, execn.  
live, and judicial, and having each a physical  
force to support its pretensions. Although  
the issue of negotiation might sometimes a.  
void this extremity, how ottun would it hap­  
pen, among so many Slates, that an unac­  
commodating spirit in some would render  
that resource unavailing? A contrary sup­  
position would not accord with {l knowledge  
of hiininn nature, or the evidence of our own  
political history.  
“ The Constitution, not relying on any  
part of the peceding modifications, for its  
safe and successful operation, has expressly  
declared on tho one hand—1, that the Con­  
stitution, and the laws made in pursuance  
thereof, and all treaties im.de under the au  
thority of tho United States, shall be tho so.  
promo law of the land; Si. that tho judges of  
every State shall t»e hound thereby,anv tlu. g  
in the constitution and laws of nny State to  
the contrary nat withstanding; :t, that the ju­  
dicial power of tho United Himes shall extend  
to all cases in law and equity arising under  
the Constitution, the laws &quot;of the United  
Stales, nnd treaties made under.their author­  
ity. Ac.”  
  
| inline omer nano, as a security ol Iho  
rights nnd poweis of the States, in their in.  
dividual capacities, against an undue prepon.  
derancc ol the powers granted to the Gov- &#x27;  
eminent over them in their united capacity, j  
the constitution has relied on—I, The re-I  
sponsihility of the Senators nnd Representa­  
tives in the Legislature of tho United States  
to the Legislatures nnd tho people of the  
Slates, y. To the responsibility of the l’res.  
ident to the people of the United Stales.  
And, ’i, The liability of tho Lxeciltive and  
Judicial Functionaries of the United States  
to impeachment bv the Representatives of  
the people of the Slates, in one branch of the  
Legislature of the United States, and trial by  
the Representatives of the States, in the oth.  
cr branch; the Slate functionaries, legisla­  
tive, executive, nnd judicial, heing. at the  
same time, ip their appointment and respon­  
sibility, altogether independent of the agency  
ot authority «.f the United States.  
How lar this structure of the&#x27; Government  
of the United States is adequate and safe lor  
its object, time alone can absolutely deter  
mine. Experience seems to have shown,  
that whatever may grow out of future stages  
of our national career, there is, ns yet, a sof.  
fieient control, in the popular will, over the  
I xccutive nnd Legislative departments of the  
Government. W hen tho alien and sedition  
laws were passed, in contravention of the o­  
pinions and fee lings of the community, the  
first elections then ensued put an end to  
them. And whatever may have been the  
character of other acts, in the judgment of  
many of ns, it is but true, that they have  
generally accorded with the view of a major­  
ity of the States and of tho people. At the

disapprobation. Still it would seem that  
wuh but tew exceptions, the cotuse of the’  
Judiciary bug been hitherto sustained by the  
predominant «enso of the nation.  
1 hose who have denied nr doubted tho su.  
jire.uaoj ot the judicial power of the United  
Mates, and denounce at the same tuno a nul­  
lifying power in a State, seem not to have  
utJicienUy adverted le the utter inefficiency  
ot a supremacy in a law of tho land, without  
a supremacy in the exposition and execution

s.blo to the »lutes, and the functionaries ol  
lliu Males arc, in thoir appointment and re­  
sponsibility, wholly independent of the Uni­  
ted Suites, no constitutional control of any  
s .n belonged to tho United States over the  
Males. Under such an organization, it is ev­  
ident that it would be in the power of the  
States, individually, t„ pass unauthorized  
Uws, mid to carry them into complete effect,

r&lt;iuo under ait governments, whether cun­  
sblidfliid, couieoernlud, or a compound of  
batii ; and it cannot Lo doubted that a single  
Uienioer Ot the Union, in the extremity sup­  
posed, bill in that only, would have u liglil,  
as an extra and ullru-cunstilutiuii.it right, to  
niaie the appeal. a  
i&#x27;ms brings us to tho expedient lately ad­  
vanced, which claims lor a single Slate a  
right to appeal against an exercise of power  
b&gt; tiie Government ot tlie United States, du­  
cideu by the Stale to bo unconstitutional, to  
tlie puilies to tlie constitutional compact;  
the decision ol tiie Slate to have tho cti&#x27;ect  
ot utility mg tlie act of tho Government ol  
tho tin lied dialed, unless the decision ot the  
Stall ho reversed by lluee-loiirtbs of the par.  
lies. *  
The distinguished names and high author­  
ities which uppear to have usserluu and given  
a practical scope to this doctrine, entitle it 10  
a respect wiiicn it might bo diliicull oilier­  
wise lo loci tor it.  
It the ductrme were to be understood as re­  
quiting the three-lourilis ol the Stales to  
sustain, instead ot that proportion to reverse  
the decision ot the appealing Slate, the de­  
cision lo be without el.ecl during the appeal,  
it would be suiliciciil to remark, that tins ex­  
tra constitutional course might well give way  
to Unit marked out by the Constitution,  
which authorizes two-Hurds of the Slates lu  
institute, and three fourths to effectuuto, an  
amendment to the Constitution, establishing  
a permanent rule ol the highest authority, in  
place ol aiunegular precedent of construc­  
tion only.  
  
.v .3 unucrsioon uiat Uio uullifyin&lt;r  
doctrine imports that tho decision ot the  
fctate is to be presumed valid, and that it o­  
verruloa tlm law of the United Slates, unless  
overruled by three-fourths of tiio States.  
Can more bo necessary to demonstrate the  
lund.i.legibility olsiirli a doctrine, than that  
it puts it m the power of the smallest I ruction  
over one-fourth of the U. States, that is, &lt;f  
seven States out of twenty four, to givo the  
law, and even the Constitution to seventeen  
States, each of the seventeen having, as par­  
ties to the Constitution, an equal right with  
each ol the seven, to expound it, and to insist  
on t be exposition ? That the seven might in  
particular instances be right, anti the seven­  
teen wrong, is more than possible, llut to  
establish a positive and permanent rule, giv­  
ing such a power to such a minority over  
such a majority, would overturn the first  
principle of tree Government,and m practice  
necessarily overturn tile Government itself.  
It is to be recollocted that the Constitution  
was proposed to the people of the Slatcsas a  
ic/iolt, and unanimously adopted by IheStales  
us n trhole. it being a part of the Constitution  
tlmt no less than three fourths of the States  
should be competent to make any alteration  
in what had been unanimously agreed to —  
So great is the caution on Ibis point, that in  
two cases where peculiar interests wero at  
stake, a proportion even of three fourths is  
di&#x27;trusted, and unanimity required to make  
an alteration.  
\\ ben the Constitution was adopted ns a  
whole, it is certain that tliero were many  
parts, which if separately proposed, would  
have been promptly rejected. It is far fr-m  
impossible, that every pari of a Constitution  
.i.iglit be rejected by a majority, and yet tak.  
en together os a wb-.lo. Lj unanimously ac­  
cepter!. Free Constitutions will rnrely, if  
ever, be formed, without reciprocal conces­  
sions ; without articles conditional on and  
balancing each other. Is there a Constitu­  
tion of n single Mat# out of the twenty four,  
that would beat the experiment of having its  
component part* ftiibuiitted to the peopltj &lt;St  
•aparaUlj decided an f  
  
What the fate of the Constitution of the If  
States would he, if a small proportion of tho  
States could expunge parts ot it particularly  
valued by a lurgu majority,can have hutt.no  
answer.  
The difficulty is not removed by limiting  
the doctrine t&lt;&gt; cases of construction. How  
many cases ol that sort, involving cardinal  
fire visit ns ol the Ct nstituticn, heve occur­  
r,’d 3 How many now exist? How many  
may hereafter spring up ? How many might  
he ingeniously created, if entitled to the pri­  
I vilege ot a decision in tho mode proposed ?  
•Is it certain that the principle of that muds  
would lift leach further than is contemplat­  
ed;&#x27; It a single State can of right require  
three fctrllis of its co-States to overrule it*  
exposition of tho Constitution, because that  
proportion is authorized to amend it, would  
the pUa bo less plausible Hint, as the Consti­  
tution was unanimously established, it ought  
to In unanimously expounded ?  
Tbe reply to ail such suggestions seems to  
be tiaavoidabie and irresistible; that tlieCon­  
slitutiori is a compact, thnt its text is to bo  
expounded according to the provisions for ex­  
pounding it, innking a part of the compact;  
and that none of the parties can rightfully re­  
nounce tho expounding provision more than  
any other part. When such a right accrues  
ns may accrue, it must grow out of abuses of  
tho compact releasing the sufferers from their  
fealty to it.  
In favor of the nullifying claim for th®  
states, individually, it appears, as you ob.  
servo, that tho piocoedingsofthe Legislature  
cf Virginia in ’US and &#x27;99, against tho Alien  
and Sedition Acts, are much dwelt upon.  
It may often happen, as experience proves  
that the erroneous constructions not antici­  
pated may not be sufficiently guarded against  
in the language used : and it is due to the  
distinguished individuals who have miscon­  
ceived the intention of those proceedings, to  
suppose that iho meaning of tho Legislature,  
though well comprehended at the time, may  
not now bo obvious, to those unacquainted  
with the contemporary indications nod im­  
pressions.  
Bui it is believed that, by keeping in view  
tho distinction between tho Governments of  
the States, and the States in the sense in  
which they were parlies to the Constitution;  
between the rights of the parties, in their  
concurrent and in their individual capacities;  
between the several modes and objects of in­  
terposition against the abuse of power, and  
especially between interpositions within tbe  
purview of the Constitution, and interposi­  
tions appealing from the Constitution to tho  
rights of nature, puiaruount to all Constitu­  
lions ; with an attention, always, of explan­  
atory use, to the views and arguments which  
wore combatted, tho Resolutions of Virginia  
as vindicated in tho report.on them, will be  
found entitled to an exposition, showing a  
consistency in their parts, and an inconsis.  
tencypftlie whole with the doctrine under  
consideration.  
  
1 hut the Legislature could not have in­  
tended to sanction such a doctrine ia to bo  
inferred from the debates in the House ofDo.  
legates, and from the address of the Houses  
to tln»ir constituents on the subject of the  
resolutions. The tenor of the debates,which  
&gt;lt&quot;i yt dl‘tit1irti and nro understood U,  
vseWlf!# 7 not­  
all ot tho speakers, discloses no^Teffffenco  
whatever in a constitutional right in an in­  
dividual State, toarrost by force tho operation  
.of a law of tho U. States. Concert among  
| the S&#x27;atos for redress against tho Alien and  
Sedition Laws, as acts of usurped power, was  
a leading sentiment; and tho attainment of a  
concert tlm immediate object of tho course  
adopted by the Legislature, which was that  
ct inviting the other States “ to concur in  
declaring the nets to bo unconstitutional,and  
to co-operate in the necessary and proper  
measures in maintaining unimpaired the au.  
thorilies, rights and liberties reserved to the  
Slates respectively, and to tho people.”*—  
That, by the necessary and proper measures  
to bn concurrently and co-operatively taken,  
weie meant measures known to tire Consti­  
tution, particularly tho ordinary control of  
the people and Legislatures of the States over  
the Government of the U. States, cannot bo  
doubled; and the interposition of this control  
as the event showed, was equal to tho occa­  
sion.  
It is worthy of remark, and explanatory  
of the intentions of the Legislature, that the  
words, “not law, but utterly null, void, and  
of no force or effect, which had followed, ill  
one of the resolutions, tho Word “unconstitu­  
tional,” was struck out by common consent.  
Though tho words were, in fact, synonymous  
with “unconstitutional,” yet, to guard against  
a misunderstanding of this phrase as nmro  
than declaratory of tho opinion, tho word  
“unconstitutional” alone was retained, as not  
liable to that danger.  
  
1 he published Address of the Legislature  
to the people, their consituents, affords anoth­  
er conclusive evidence of its views. The  
Address warm them against the encronch­  
ing spirit of the General Government,  
argues tho unconsitutionality of the Alien  
and Sedition Acts, points to other instances  
in which the constitutional limits had been  
overleaped; dwells upon tho dangerous modu  
of deriving power by implication; and in  
general presses tho necesity ofwnlehing over  
thocnnsolulnting tendency of the federal  
policy. But nothing is said that can be un­  
derstood to look to means in maintaining  
the rights of the States, beyond the regular  
ones, within tho forms of tho Constitu­  
tion.  
If any further lights on the subject cor. hi  
bo needed, a very strong one is reflected in  
tho answers to the Resolutions, by the States  
which protested against them. The main  
objection of these, beyond a fow general  
complaints of tho inflamatory tendency of the  
Resolutions was diiectcd against the assumed  
authority cf a State Legislature to declare  
a law of the United States unconstitutional,  
which they pronounced an unwrarantuble in­  
terference with tho exclusive jurisdiction of  
the Supreme Court of the United Slates.  
Hnd the. resolutions been regarded as avow­  
ing and maintaining a right, in an individual  
State, to arrest, by force, tho execution of a  
law of the United States, it must bo presum­  
ed that it would have been a conspicuous ob­  
| joct of their denunciation.  
With cordiul salutations.

Mo.vTrki.ir.a.stofsT. 18.10.  
I Dear Sir: I have duty racer ve.l your let  
ter, in which you refer t• Hie *• nullifying  
| doctrine,*1 advocated as a constitutional  
rifht, by some of our distinguished feSow­  
eitisens; and to the proceedings of the  
Virginia legislature in &#x27;OSapd tlO, „ 3|,  
peated to in behalf of that doctrine : and  
you express a wi*h fisrn.y idoss on tbo.c  
subjects. &#x27;• V*  
I am aware of the delirarv af rli* t».L  
  
in some respects, aod the difficulty in ere  
ry respect, of doing full justice to it. Uul,  
hiving, in more than one instance, com- j  
[•lied with a like request from other friend  
iy quarter*. I do not decline a skutcli of  
the views which I have been led to take of  
the doctrine in question, «s well Is some  
others connected with them; and of the  
grouods from which&quot; it appears that the |  
proceedings of Virginia have head mitCon  
crired by those who have appealed to  
&#x27;them. In order to unde rstaodT the true  
; character of therConstitutlon of ttieTnifrd  
States, the error, not uoeonimnn. must he  
avoided, of viewing it through the mrdi  
uin, either of a convoliilafed Government,  
or of a confederated GovenMoeat, whilst  
it is neither the one nor (ho writer: but a  
mixture of both. And haring, in no mo­  
del, the similitudes and analogies apptica  
hie to other systems of government, it  
must, more than any other, be its own in  
« *CCOrtl,D* to &quot;• til( aud t,u  
FseW lWu it will lie seen that the eha  
ra*t«ftnfic |&gt;rea|i«nlirsnf the constitution  
are. I, the malt of its formaib.n , 1, the  
division of the supreme powers of govern  
(neat between the states, in their united  
capacity, and the itatea ia their individual  
MOfencifir*  
It was formed, not hy the govern  
menfs of the component states, as the fe­  
deral government for which it was suhsti  
luted was harmed. Nor was it formed liy  
a majority of the people «f the (.&#x27;sited  
! Niafrs.as a *mgl« community, in the man  
ner of a mneolidated government.  
| It was formed by the states ; thnt is. I?y  
i the peepfe in raeh of the states, acting in  
their highest sovereign rapacity -t and  
nemed consequently by the same ewfhon  
•y which formed the *t»fe constitutions  
  
Being (busderived from (be HUtf source  
■» the constitutions of tho states, it Us.  
within each state, the same authority as;  
the constitution of the state ; and is as  
much a constitution, io the strict sense of  
the term, within its prescribed sphere, as  
the constitutions of the states ere, within I  
their respective spheres: hut with Ibis ob­  
vious ahd esseutial difference, that being a  
compact among the stales, in their highest  
sovereign capacity, and Constituting the ;  
people thereof one people f«r certain pur  
poses.it cannot he altered or anndBed at  
tha will of the states individually, a* the  
constitution or a state may be at its tndi- i  
vidual will.  
at. And that it divides the supreme pow­  
ers of government, between the govern-1  
went ot the United Stolen and tha go  
lament of Ibn individual stales, is  
stamped on the face of tha instrument;1  
the powers of war and taxation, of com  
mere# and of troalic*. and other enumera  
*n the government of  
the United- States, being of as high and  
sovereign a character, as any of the pow­  
ers reserved to the state governments.  
Nor is Ilia government of the United  
States, created by the constitution, less a  
government io tha strict sense of the term,  
within the sphere or its powers, than ih.­  
governments created by the constitutions  
of the states are. within their several  
spheres.&#x27; It is like them organized into  
I.eigislitive, Kxfcutire*, and Jtidirijrv do­  
pat tmeots. It operates,like them, direct  
ly on persons and things And. like them,  
it has at common a phyviral force for eve  
cuting tho power* committed to it The  
concurrent operation in ceitaiu cases, is  
one of the feature* mailing tho peculiari­  
ty of the system.  
Betweeo these different constitutional  
governments, (he o«r operating in all the  
states, the others operating separately in  
each, with the aggregate powers of go­  
vernment dirided between them, it could  
not escape attention, that controversies  
would arise concerning the boundaries of  
jurisdiction; and that asm* provision  
  
HJ DC niaae i«r such occurrences.  
A political system that docs not provide  
lor a peaceable and authoritative termina­  
tion of occurring controversies, would oot  
be more than the shadow of a government;  
the object and end of a real government  
beiog. the substitution af law and order,  
for uncertainty, confusion, and violence.  
I hat to have Jett a final decision, in such  
cases, to each of the states, then thirteen,  
and already twenty four, could oot fail to  
make the constitution and laws of the U  
States different in different states, was ob­  
vious; and not less obvious, that this di­  
versity of independent decisions roust al­  
together distract the government af the  
L nion, and speedily put an end to the L’­  
nioo itself. An uniform authority of the  
laws, is in itself a litul principle. Some  
of the most important laws could not he  
partially executed. They must be execu­  
ted in all the states, or they could be duly  
executed iu none. An impost, or an ex­  
cise, fur example, if not in force in some  
states, would be defeated in others. It is  
well known that this was among the les­  
sons of experience, which had a primary  
influence in bringing about tho existing  
constitution. A loss of its general autho  
rity would moreover revive the exaspera­  
ting questions between the states holding  
ports for foreign commerce, and the ad  
joiniog states without them ; to which are  
now added, nil the inland states, iitctos  
rily carrying on their foreign commerce  
through other states.  
To have made the derisions under the  
authority of the Individual states, co ordi­  
nate, in ail eases, with decisiutis undvr itn  
authority of tho I rnitei| States, would una  
voidably produce Collisions incompatible  
with the peace of society, and with that  
regular and cfl&#x27;n ient administration,which  
is the essence ef free governments. Scenes  
Could not be atoided, in which a ministe­  
.1.1 . 41*._IV si. . a _s  
  
uro i &#x27;♦ oiaicv nnu ine cor  
respondent oHirer of an indu idual state,  
would bare rencounters in executing con­  
flicting decrees ; ‘.he result of which would  
deptuid on tho comparative force of the  
local posses attending them; and that a  
casualty depending on the political opin  
ions and parly frrlings in different states. 1  
lo hate referred every clashing dec is !  
ion, under the two authorities, for a final  
decision, to the states, as parties to the  
constitution, would he attended with dr  
lays, with inconvenir nces,. and with e«  
p&lt;*n»e», amounting to a prohibition of the  
expedient; not to mention its tendency to  
impair the salutary veneration for a sjs  
trm requiring such frequent interposition*,  
nor tho delicate questions which might  
present themselves as lo the form of sta  
ling the appeal, nud at tu the quorum for  
deriding it.  
To have trusted to negotiation for ad  
justing disputes between the government |  
of the l nitrd Slates and the state govern  
nieols, as between independent and aepa ,  
rate sovereignties, would have lost sight  
altogether of a constitution and got em­  
inent for the t nion ; ml opened a direct  
road from a failure n^tbat resort, to the  
ultima ml to between nations wholly inde  
pendent of and alien fo each oilier. If the  
idea had its origin in the pencest of ad­  
justment, between separate hr a tie he* sL  
the isms government, the analogy enlirpJ  
ly fails. In the c*«« of disputes between*  
independent parts of the same govern  
ment, neither part betn^ ahl* to eonsum  
■sate its will, nor the government to pro  
reed without a roururrence of fhe part*,  
necessity brings about an »ccommg4na#on  
In disputes between a state (nirr^Wst,&#x27;  
and the government of the ! &#x27;nitrd States,  
the ra«w is practically as w ell as theoretic- (  
ally different ; each party possessing all  
‘.he deporto eff» -*f jn ory*nigef gov err. -1  
  
merit. Legislative, Executive, amt Judtri- ,  
•ry ; and having each • physical fore* to  
support its pretensions. Although the is. j  
sue ef negotiation might sometimes avoid  
thh extremity, bow often would it hap­  
pen, among so many states, that an unac­  
commodating spirit in some would readier  
that resource unavailing&#x27;/ A contrary sup-!  
position would not accord with a know-!  
ledge of human nature, or tho ovidcoce of  
our own political history.  
Tha constitution, not relying on any of  
the preceding&#x27; uiedihcations, for its safe  
and successful operation, has expressly  
declared, on the one hand, I, ‘that the&#x27;  
constitution, and the laws made in pursu­  
ance thereof, and all treaties made under  
the authority of the United States, shall  
l»e the supreme law of the land; *2. that I  
the Judges of every slate shall be bound  
thereby, sny thin- in the constitution and  
laws oi any stale to the contrary notwith- i  
lUtding; 3, that the judicial power of the  
Loiled Stales shsll extend to sll cases in j  
law and equity arising under the constitu .  
lien, the laws of the United States, ami  
treaties made under tin ir authority, itc.*  
fin the other hand, as a security of the  
lights and powers oi the Slates, in tbeir  
individual capacities, agotost an uoduc  
preponderance of the (Kiwrrs granted to!  
the government over them in their united  
capacity, the constitution bus relied on, 1.  
the responsibility of the senators or repre­  
sentatives in the Legi-laturr of the l.’ni-j  
ted States to the Legislatures ami people  
of tho United State*; ‘2, responsibility ol  
the President to the people of tlm United  
Slates ; and 3. the liability of the Kxcru-!  
live and Judicial functionaries of the U.1  
Slates to impeachment by the represents-!  
lives ot the people of the states, in one  
branch of ilia Legislature of the United&#x27;  
States, and trial by representatives of the  
states, in the other branch; the state !  
functionaries, legislative, executive, snd  
judicial, being, at the same time, in their  
appointment and responsibility, altogether i  
independent of the atrenev or aulhuiiiv ■.(  
  
the United Stales. j  
How far this structure of Ibe govern  
men! of tbe United States is adequate and  
safe for its objects, time alone can abso­  
lutely determine. Experience seems to  
base shown, that whatever may grew eut  
of future stages of our nations! career,  
there is, as yet, a sufficient control in the  
popular will, over the executive end Icgis- ^  
lative departments of the government.— !  
W hen the alien and sedition laws were  
passed in contraventioo to the opinions  
and fadings of tha community, the first  
elections that ensued put an end to them.1  
And whatever tuay have beeo Ibe charac  
ter of other acts, in the Judgment of many  
of us, it is but true that they have gene 1  
rally accorded wilhlha views of the ma- j  
jinty of the states and of the people. At  
the present day it sectna well Understood, i  
that the laws which have created most j  
dissatisfaction, hare lisd a liko sanction !  
without dnors; and that whether contin­  
ued, varied, or repealed, a like proof will i  
he given of tbe sympathy and rrsponsibili i  
ty of the representative body to die const it u  
enl body. Indeed, the great complaint now  
is against the results of this sytrps&#x27;hy and re.  
sponsibility in the legislative policy of the  
nation.  
&#x27;Viih respect In the judicial power of the !  
United Slates, and the authority of the an i  
preme Court, in relation to the boundary of:  
jurisdiction between the federal anil the stale  
governments, I may be permitted to refer to  
the tbirty-ninth number of the • Federalist/*  
for tfie light in which the subject was regard­  
ed by its writer, at the period when the con  
stiliiiion was pending; anil it is hr lined that  
the name w as the prevailing view then taken  
l*d •*, that the s.une view lias continued to  
prevail, and that it does so at thin time, not  
withstanding tl»r eminent exceptions to it.  
Ilot ii is |»rtfi-&lt;-.ily consistent with ibe con- &#x27;  
cession «,f this power to the aupteme rnurt, •  
incases Idling within the course t.f its func- ,

that, with Inti few exceptions, the course of

Irary notwithstanding. Tina would be • nttl­  
* ,HI*fr in iu plenary character; and  
whether t« bail its final effect, through (he le­  
gislative, executive, or judicial y organ of the  
■tale, vuuld be equally f.ul to the constitu­  
teilrela .on between the two governments.  
Should the prm-&#x27;atons of tl.« constitution,  
aa reviewed, be found not to secure tbe go.  
vrmment and rights of tbe slates, agaiTwt  
iiMirpatiuns and abuaea on the part of tl»n l).  
States, tbe final resort, within the purview of  
the constitution, lies in an amendment of tbe  
constitulion, according to a process applica­  
ble by the states.  
And in tbe event of a failure o*&#x27; every eon.  
si Motional resort, and an accumulation of usur­  
pations and abuses, rendering passive obedi­  
ence and non resistance a greater evil than  
resistance and revolution, ihcre can remain  
but one resort, tbe last of all; an appeal from  
the cancelled obligations of the runelfcvlion­  
•1 compact, to original rights and the law of  
■elf preservation. I his la the •tltima ratio  
under aM governmeots.whctl.rr consolidated,  
confederated, or a compound of both; and it  
cannot be doubted that a single member of  
the Union, in the extremity supposed, but in  
that only, would have a right, aa an extra and  
uhra-conetMutional right, to make the appeal  
This brings us to the expedient lately ad­  
vanced, which claims for a single state a right  
to appeal againat an exercise ot power by tbe  
government of the United States, decided by  
the State to be unconstitutional, to the par­  
lies to the constitutional compact; tbe decis­  
ion of the state 1u bare the effect of nullify,  
tng the act of die government of the United  
States, unless the decision of the alar# be re­  
versed by three-fourths of the parties.  
The distinguished names and higltauthori­  
tiea which appear to have asserted and given  
■ partial scope to this doctrine, ciilHle n to a  
respect which it might be difficult otherwise  
tu feel for it.  
If the doctrine were to be understand as  
requiring the three fouMli* of the atates to  
sustain, instead of that proportion to reverse  
llie decision of the aripealmg state, the decis­  
ion to be without tfleet during the appeal, it  
would be sufficient to remark, that tbia extra­  
constitutional course might well give wsy to  
that marked out by the constitution, winch  
authorizes two-thirds of the slates to institute  
nnd three-fourths to effectuate an amendment  
of the constitution, establishing a paramount  
  
..... w. .HV au&#x27;iiumy, in place ot an  
irregular precede r.t of roiotiuctiuu only.  
Hut it is understood that lUc nullifying  
doctrine imports that the decision of the state  
is to be presumed valid, and that it overrules  
the law of the United Slates­  
Can mote be necessary to demonstrate the  
inarlinissiudfty „f such a doctrine, than that it  
puts in the power of the sim iles! fraction  
over one-fourth ot the United States, that ia,  
ot seven states out of twenty four, to give the  
law and even the constitution to seventeen  
states, each of the seventeen having, as par­  
lies to the constitution, an equal right with  
the seven, to expound it, and to insist on the  
exposition * That the seven might, in pat lie­  
ular instances, be right, and the seventeen  
wrong, is more than possible. But to esta­  
blish a positive and permanent rule giving  
such a power, to sucli a minority, over such  
a majority, would overturn the first principle  
••f tree government, and in practice necessa­  
rily overturn the government itself  
It is to be recollected that the constitution  
was proposed to the people uf the states as a  
seWe, Mid unanimously adopted by the states  
as a u7«•/&lt;•, it being a part of the Constitution  
that no leas than three fourths of the staif s  
should be competent to make any alteration  
in wlist had been unanimously agreed, (in  
great is the caution on this point, that in two  
cases where peculiar interests were at stake,  
a proportion of Sven thrre-fuurthsrs distrust  
cd, and unanimity requited to uiakc an altei­  
ation  
When the runstitution was adopted as a  
whole, it is certain there were mini parts,  
&quot;tii&#x27;li, if separately proposed, would have  
been promptly rejected. It i» i»r from m  
possible, that escry part ot a constitution  
might be rejected by a majority, and yet ts  
krn togi liter iii s w hole, l&gt;* unanimously ac­  
cepted. Ktfs constitutions will rarely, if  
ever, be foimed, without reri;»ro« al cone**­

 of the  
United States would be if a small propor  
  
tion of the States could expunge parts of  
  
it particularly valued by a large majority,  
can have but one answer.  
The difficulty is not removed by limit­  
ing the doctrine to cases of construction.  
How many cases of that sort, involving  
cardinal provisions of the constitution, have  
occurred? How many exist? how many  
may hereafter spring; up ? How many  
might be ingeniously cxeated,if en titled to  
fhe privilege of decision iathe mode pror  
posed? ; r-&quot;&#x27;&#x27;&quot;- &#x27; ;  
  
I Is it certain that the principle of that  
  
mode would not reach further than  
  
is contemplated. If a singleState can of  
  
iigm require tnree iounns or its co-istates  
to overrule its exposition of the constitu-  
  
lon, because mat proportion is authorized  
o amend it, would the plea be less plau-  
  
iible that, as the constitution was unani­  
mously established, it ought to be unani  
  
mously expounded ?  
  
The reply to all such suggestions seems  
  
to be? unavoidable and irresistible : that the  
  
vonatitution is a compact ; that its text is  
  
to be, expounded according to the provis  
  
ions for expounding it making a part of  
  
the compact : and that none of the parties  
  
Can rightfully renounce the expounding  
  
provision more than any other part. .When  
such a right accrues, as may&#x27; accrue, it  
  
must grow out of abuses of the compact,  
  
releasing the sutterers trom theu: fealty to  
it. : 1;V. i &#x27; , &#x27; : ,X &#x27;: - .  
  
In favor of the nullifvinsr claim for the  
  
States, individually it appears as you ob  
  
serve, that the proceedings of the Legisla-  
  
ftire ofVirginia in &#x27;98, and in 99, against  
the Alien and Sedition Acts are much  
  
aweit upon.  
  
I I1 may often -happen, as experience  
  
proves, tnat erroneous constructions not  
anticipated, may not be sufficiently guar  
  
ded against, in the language used ; and it  
duef to thedistinguished individuals, Who  
have ithisconceived the intention of those  
  
proceedings, to suppose that the meaning  
of the Legislature, though well compre­  
hended at the time, may not; now be obvi­  
ous to those unacquainted with the cotem-  
  
porary indications and impressions.  
  
But, it is b&#x27;elieved that by keeping- in  
view the distinction between the Govern  
  
ments of the States; and the States in the  
sense in which they were parties to the

Montprlicr. August, 1S30.&quot;  
&#x27; &#x27; Dear Sir: I have Uiily received your let­  
. tef, in which you . refer to the nullifying  
doctrine,&quot; &#x27;advocated as a constitutional  
, right, by some of our distinguished fellow  
citizen, and to-the proceedings of the  
Virginia Legislature in &#x27;OS and -&#x27;99, &#x27;as  
appealed to in behalf 4of that doctrines  
. find you express a wish for ny idea&#x27;s on  
those subjects. . . ,; ,. ,  
I am aware of the delicacy of tho task  
in ,some ..respects, and the difficulty in  
, every fccspect, of dojrig&#x27; full justice o it,  
&#x27; But, having, in. more thai) one instance,  
complied with a like reijuest from other  
. .1 7.I-1.&#x27; I.  
&quot; inenui  
Of the  
  
idly quarters, I do not decline a sketch authority of the individ  
he views which I have been led tojdinate, in all cases with&#x27; t  
  
take of the doctrine in question, as well  
.fas s,ome others connected with them; and  
: of the grounds from which jt appears that  
v :, .the proceedings of Virginia nave been  
misconceived by those who have appealed  
l&#x27; t,thenv, In order to understand the true  
j-; eMtacteV of the Constitution of the United  
, States, the error, hot uncommon, must.be  
avoided of viewing it through the medium,  
-either of a consolidated Government, or  
f a confederated Government, whilst, it is  
neither the one nor the other; but a mix-  
, tureof both. And having, in no model,  
the similitudes and analogies applicable  
to other systems of Government, it must,  
,more than any other, be its oyvh interpre­  
ter according to its text and thhfacts of (tie  
ease. &#x27; . s&quot; :-k  
. I From these it will be seenithat thdehar-  
&#x27; acteristic peculiarities of the constitution  
. are 1, the mode of its formation ; 2,&quot; tlie di­  
vision Of the supreme powers of Gpvern­  
inent between the States in their united  
apacity, and the States in their individual  
r -fcapacilics.,.&quot;,&quot; . . ,;-tvv:?:-:?...  
1. It was formed, not by tne uavejrn­  
, xnents of the coraponent. States&#x27;, as, the  
Federal Government for which it &quot;was  
aubstituted was formed. Nof was it forni  
ed by a majority of the people of the Uni-  
ted states, as astnffic nomniunuy, miuv  
manner of a consolidated Governme  
It was formed by the, States, tnat is,  
&#x27; by the people in each of the States, acting  
in their highest sovereign capatity;and  
formed conseauentlv bv thysame -au-  
thority which formed the Stiitc constitu­  
&quot;tions.Being thus derived Hfrom the &#x27; same  
aourco as the constitutions of the Stales,  
-it has, within each State, the same autho  
rity as the constitution of the State and  
jg-as much a constitution, in the strict  
sense of the tenn; within its prescribed  
  
&#x27;.. spheres the constitutions of the States  
. ; arc, withMi tlietr respective spheres&#x27;: but  
F with this obious and essential diuer­  
: - -Tehee, that &quot;jbeing a compact among the  
States i;i their highest ereiirn capacity,  
.,, . &amp;constitutiiig the people thereofonepeo­  
! pie forpertain purposes.it cannot be altered  
&#x27;! ar annulled at the will of the Slates in  
&#x27; , - dividuallv, us the constitution of aState  
  
&#x27;&#x27;&quot;t &#x27;Wy he at its individual will. &#x27; &#x27;  
  
2. And that it divides the supreme  
&#x27;powers of Government, between the Go-  
Tcrnment of the -United States, and the  
Governments of the individual States&quot;, is  
srapedv on the face. of4ke Lg-ivaejit, j  
the po wers of war and of taxation, of com  
merce and of treaties, and other enume  
rated powers vested in the Government  
of the United States, being of as high and  
sovereign a character, as any of the pow­  
ers reserved to the State Governments. r ?  
Nor is the Government of the .Uni­  
ied States, created by the constitution, less  
a Government in the strict sense of the  
term,&#x27; within -the sphere of its powers,  
than the Governments created by the con­  
stitutions of the States are, within their se  
veml spliere.i.&#x27;&quot; It is like them organized  
Into Legislative Executive, and Judiciary  
departments, r It operates like them, 1 di  
rectly on persons and things. And. like  
them, it has at command a physical force  
for executing the pon&#x27;ers committed to it.  
Theonearrenff)Watlon4r  
cs, is one of the features marking the  
, pflculiarilYof the system. , : , &#x27;  
Between these -difierent Constitutional  
Gprernmcnts the one operating in all the  
&quot;States the other operating separately in  
. each, with the aggregate powers of Go­  
&#x27; vernment divided -between them, it could  
ot escape attention,-that controversies  
would arise concerning the boundaries of  
jurls;liction ; and that some provision ought J  
to be made tor sueu occurrences. a po­  
litical system that does not provide for a

To hare-trusted to&quot; negoliatiori for ad  
justing disputes between the government  
oJ the United states and the Mtate liov­  
ernmenls, as between independent and  
separate sovereignties, would have lost  
sight altogether &#x27; of a constitution and  
government for the Union ; and -opened  
a direct road from a failure of that resort,  
to the ultima rath between nations whol­  
ly independent of and alien to each oth­  
er. If the idea had its origin in the pro­  
cess of adjustment, - between - separate  
branches -of &#x27;.the earac government, the  
aualogy cniirely fail&#x27;s. In the case of  
disputes between the independent parts of  
the same Go vernnnt, neither part being  
able to consummate itiwilLnorthe govern  
ment to proceed without a concurrence of  
the parts,ne?esgity brings about an accom­  
modation. In disputed between a State  
Government, and the Government of the  
United State?, the &quot;case is practically as  
well as theoretically &#x27;diForcnt 5 each party  
possessing all the &quot;departments of an or­  
ganized government, Legislative, Exe­  
cutive; and Judicial ; &#x27; and having each a  
physical force to support its pretensions.

of the preceding modifications, for its  
safe and successful operation, has express­  
ly declared, on the one hand, 1, that the

MoNTPELIEH, August 1830.  
Dear Sir: I have duly received  
your letter, in which yon refer to the  
&quot;tTH&#x27;iIlilying doctrine,” advocateu us r»  
constitutional right by some of our dis­  
tinguished fellow-citizens; and to the  
proceedings of the Virginia Legislature  
in&#x27;98, and ’99, as appealed to in behalf  
of that doctrine; and you express a wish  
for rny ideas on those subjects.  
! am aware of the delicacy of the  
task ie. some respect&#x27;:,and the difficulty  
in every respect, of doing full justice to  
it. But, having, in more than one in­  
stance, complied with a like request from  
other friendly quarters, I do not decline  
a sketch of the views which I have been  
led to take of the doctrine in question,  
•as well « some others connected with  
them; and oi the grounds from which it  
appears, that the proceedings of Vir­  
ginia have been misconceived by those  
who have appealed to them. In order  
to understand the true character of the  
Constitution of the United States, the  
error, not uncommon, must be avoided,  
of viewing it through the medium,either  
of a consolidated Government or of a  
confederated Government, whilst it is  
neither the one nor the other; but a mix­  
ture of both. And having, in no model,  
the similitudes and analogies applicable  
to other systems of Government, it must,  
more than any other, he its own inter­  
preter according to its text and the facts  
of the case.  
From these it will be seen that the  
Characteristic peculiarities of the Con­  
stitution are, 1, the mode of its forma­  
tion; 2, t!ie division of the supreme pow­  
ers of Government between the States  
*n their united capacity and the States  
in their individual capacity.  
F It was formed, not by the Govern­  
ments of the component States, as the  
federal Government for which it was  
substituted was formed. Nor was it  
Ibrmed by a majority of the people of  
the United States, as a single communi­  
ty, in the manner of a consolidated Go­  
vernment.  
v It was formed by the States, that is,  
ty the people in each of the States, ac­  
ting in their highest sovereign capacity;  
und formed consequently by the same  
authority which formed the‘State Con­  
stitution.  
Iking thus derived from the same  
source as the constitutions of the States,  
it has, within each Stale, the same au­  
thority as the constitution of the State;  
and is as much a constitution, in the  
strict sense of the term, within its pre­  
scribed sphere, as the constitutions ot  
the States are, within their respective  
spheres; but with this obvious and es­  
sential difference, that being a compact  
among the States in their highest sove­  
reign capacity, and constituting the peo­  
ple thereof one people for certain pur­  
poses, it cannot be altered or annulled  
at the will of the States individually, a?  
the constitution of a State may be at it;  
Individual will  
2 And that it divides the supreme  
powers of Government, between the  
Government of the United States, and  
the Government of the individual States.  
ls stamped on the face of the instru  
^nt, the powers of war and of taxation.  
°f commerce and of treaties, and othei  
enumerated powers vested in the Go  
vernmeht of the United States, being;  
of as high and sovereign a character, as  
any of the powers reserved to the Stati  
Governments.  
is the Government of the Unit  
  
i ed States, created by the constitution,  
less a Government in the strict sense of  
t ieterrn, within t :e sphere of its powi r,  
than tiie Governments created by the  
constitutions of the States arc, within  
their respective splieres. It is like them  
l Oi ^(iiiized into Gegislative, Iiixccutivc,  
and Judiciary Departments. It oper­  
ates, like them, directly on persons and  
things. And, like them, it has at com­  
mand a physical force for executing the  
powers committed to it. The concur­  
rent operation in certain case?, is one ol  
j the features marking the peculiarity of  
I the system.  
I Between these different constitution­  
j al Governments, the one operating in all  
the States, the others operating separ­  
jateJy in each, with the aggregate pow­  
j c.rs ol Government divided between  
:• them, it could not escape attention, that  
j controversies would arise concerning  
: the boundaries of jurisdiction; and that  
| some provision ought to be made for  
j such occurrences. A political system  
j that does not provide for a peaceable  
j and authoritative termination of occur­  
( ring controversies, would not be more  
than the shadow of a Government;  
the object and end of a real Govern­  
ment being, the substitution of law and  
order, for uncertainty, confusion and  
violence.  
That to have left a final decision, in  
such cases, to each of the States, then  
thirteen, and already twenty four could  
not fail to make the constitution and  
laws of the United States different in  
different States, was obvious; and not  
less obvious, that this diversity of in­  
dependent decisions, must altogether  
distract the government of the Union,  
and speedily put an end to the Union it­  
sell. An uniform authority of the laws,  
is in itself a vital principle. Some of  
most * it&#x27; pcrt«Tn^ oahM »g,  
partially executed. They must be ex­  
ecuted in all the States,or they could he  
duly executed in none. An impost,oran  
excise, for example, ifoot in foreeinsome  
| States, would be defeated in others. I­  
is well known that this was among the  
| lessons of experience, which had a pri­  
j mary influence ir bringing about tne  
existing constitution. A loss of ifcsger­  
: eral authority would moreover revive  
j the exasperating questions between the  
j States bolding ports for foreign com­  
merce, and the adjoining States without  
I them; to which are now added,all the  
i inland States, necessarily carrying on  
  
i iviuign commerce inrougn ouier  
i States.  
To have made the decisions under  
the authority of the individual States,  
co-ordinate, in all case?, w;th decisions  
under the authority of the United States,  
would unavoidably produce collisions  
incompatible with the peace of society,  
and with that regular and efficient ad­  
ministration, which is of the essence of  
free governments. Scenes could not  
he avoided, in which a ministerial offi­  
cer of the United States, and &#x27;the cor­  
respondent officer of an individual State,  
would have rencounters in executing  
conflicting decrees, the result of which  
would depend on the comparative force  
of the local posses attending them; and  
that, a casualty depending on the polit­  
ical opinions and party feelings in differ­  
ent States.  
To have referred every clashing di­  
cision under the two authorities, for a  
final decision, to the States as parties to  
the Constitution, -would be attended  
with delays, with inconveniences, and  
with expenses, amounting to a pro­  
hibition of the expedient; not to men­  
tion its tendency to impair the salutary  
veneration for a system requiring such  
frequent interpositions, nor the delicate  
questions which might present them­  
selves as to the form of stating the ap­  
peal and as to the quorum for deciding  
it.  
To have trusted to negotiation for  
adjusting disputes between the govern­  
ment ol the United States and the state  
governments, ax between independent  
and separate sovereignties, would have  
lost sight altogether of a constitution  
and government for the Union; and o­  
pehed a direct road from a failure of that  
resort, to the ultimate ratio between na­  
tions wholly independent of and alien  
to each other. If the idea had its ori­  
gin in the process of adjustment, be­  
tween separate branches of the same  
government, the analogy ervtiiely fails.  
In the case of disputes between inde­  
pendent parts of the same government,  
neither party being able to consummate  
its will, nor the government to proceed  
without a concurrence of the parts, ne  
cessity brings about an accommodation  
In disputes between a state governmen  
, and the Govern meat of the Uni ted States  
the case is practically as well as theo  
retically different;each party possessing  
all the departments of an organized &quot;ov  
eminent legislative, executive and ju  
diciary; and having each a physica  
! force to support its pretentions. A1  
though the issue of negotiation migh  
i sometimes avoid this extremity, how&#x27; ol  
: ten would it happen among so mam  
states,that.an unaccommodating spirii  
• in some would render that resource un  
  
I availing! A contrary supposition would  
| not accord with a knowledge of human  
! nature, or the evidence of our own po­  
j litical history.  
TIhS constitution, not relying on any  
! of the preceding modifications, for its  
safe and* successful operation, has ex­  
pressly declared, on the one hand, i,  
“That the constitution and laws made  
in pursuance thereof, and all treaties  
made under the authority of the United  
Strifes, shall he the supreme law of the  
land: 2,that the -Judges of every state  
shall he hound thereby, any thing in  
the Constitution and laws of any state  
to the contrary notwithstanding; 3&quot;, that  
the judicial power of the United States  
shall extend to all cases in law and equi­  
ty arising under the Constitution, the  
laws of the United States, and treaties  
made under their authority,” &amp;c.  
On the other hand, as a security of  
the rights and powers of the states,in  
their individual capacities, against an  
undue preponderance of the powers  
granted to the government over them in  
their united capacity, the constitution  
has relied on, 1,&#x27;the responsibility of the

absolutely determine, laxperienceseems  
to have shown, that whatever may grow  
I out of future stages of our national ca­  
reer, there is ns yet, a sufficient control  
m the popular will, over the executive  
and legislative departments of the gov­  
ernment. When the Alien and Sedi­  
tion Laws w ere passed in contravention  
to die opinions and feelings of the com­  
munity, the first elections that ensued  
put an end to them. knd whatever  
may have been the character of other  
acts, in the judgment of many of us, it  
  
out u ik1, uj:n utoy nave generally ac­  
corded with the views of a majority of  
the states and of the people. At the  
i present day it seems well understood,  
that the laws which created mostdissat­  
isfaction, have had a like sanction with­  
out doors; and that whether continued,  
varied, or repeated, a like proof will be  
given of the sympathy and responsibili­  
ty of the representative body to the con­  
stituent body&#x27;. Indeed the great com­  
plaint now is, against the results of this  
sympathy and responsibility in the legis­  
lative policy of the nation.  
With respect to the judicial power of  
the United States, and the authority of  
the Supreme Court in relation to &quot;the  
boundary of jursidiction between the  
Federal and State Governments, 1 may  
be permitted to refer to the thirty-ninth  
number of the “Federalist,”* for the  
light in which the. subject was regard­  
ed by its writer, at the period when the  
Constitution was depending; and it is  
believed, that the same was the prevail­  
ing view then taken of it, that the same  
view has continued to prevail; and that  
it does so at this time, notwithstanding  
the eminent exceptions to it.  
But it is perfectly consistent with the  
concessions of this power to the Supreme  
Court, in cases falling within the course  
of its functions, to maintain that the pow­  
er has not always been rightly exercis­  
ed. To say nothing of the period, hap­  
pily a short one, when Judges in their  
seats did not abstain from intemperate  
and party harangues,equally atvariance  
with their duty and their dignity, there  
j have been occasional decisions from the  
bench, which have incurred serious and  
extensive disapprobation. Stiii it would  
seem, that, with but few exceptions, the  
course of the Judiciary has been hither­  
to sustained by the predominant sense  
of tlic nation*  
Those who have denied or doubted  
the supremacy of the Judicial power oi  
the United States, and denounce at the  
same time a nullifying power in a State,  
seem not to have suiiicicntiy adverted  
to the utter insufficiency of a supremacy  
* No. 33.

. in a law of the land, without a supre-;  
macy in tlie exposition and execution of&#x27;

! equipoise between the Federal Govern-!  
i merit and the Slate Governments, if,  
whilst the functionaries of the Federal  
1 Goverment are direclly or indirectly  
j elected by and responsible to the States,  
, and the functionaries of the Slates are  
I in thqir appointment and responsibility  
1 wholly independent of the United States,  
| no constitutional control of an) sort be­  
l longs to .the U, States over (he States.  
! 1 ndersuch-anorganization,it is erident  
I that it would he in the power ol the  
States, individually, to pass unauthori­  
; zed laws, and to carry them into com­  
i plete effect, any thing in the Constitu­  
; lion and laws of the United States to  
! the contrary notwithstanding. This  
i would be a nullifying power in iis nien­  
| ary character, and whether it had its ii- j  
nal effect, through the Legislative, Ex-1  
ecutive, or Judiciary organ of the State, j  
would be equally latal to the constituted j  
relation between the two Governments, j  
Should the provisions of the Consti­  
tution as here reviewed be found not ]  
to secure the governments and rights of I  
the States, against usurpations and abu-;  
ses on the part of the United States, j  
the final resort within the purview of  
the Constitution lies in an amendment  
of tlie Constitution, according to a pro­  
cess applicable by the States.  
And in the event of the failure ofev- j  
cry ,constitutional resort, and an accu­  
mulation ol usurpations and abuses, ren­  
dering passive obedience and non-re­  
sistance a greater evu than resistance  
and revolution, there can remain but one  
resort; the last of all—an appeal from  
the cancelled obligationsof the compact,  
to original rights and the law of self­  
preservation. This is the ultima ratio un­  
der .-ill governments whether consolida­  
ted, confederated or a compound of both,  
and it cannot be doubted that a single  
member ol the Union, in the extremity  
supposed,but in that only, would have  
a right, as an extra and ultra constitu­  
tional right, to make the appeal.  
This brings us to the expedient late­  
ly advanced, which claims for a single  
State a right to appeal against an exer­  
cise of power by the Government of the  
United States decided by the State to be  
unconstitutional, to the parties to the  
constitutional compact; the decision ol  
the State to have the effect of nullifying  
the act of the Government of the Unit-,  
ed States, unless the decision of the  
State be reversed by three fourths ofthe  
parties.  
The distinguished names and high au­  
thorities which appear to have assert­  
ed and given a practical scope to this  
doctrine, entitled it to a respect which  
it might be difficult otherwise to feel for  
  
If the doctrine were to he understood  
as requiring (he three fourths of the  
States to sustain, instead of that portion  
to reverse the decision of the appealing  
State, the decision to be without effect  
during the appeal, it would be sufficient  
to remark that this extra constitutional  
course might well give way to that mark­  
ed out by the constitution, which author­  
ises two-thirds ot the States to institute  
and three-fourths to effectuate an amend­  
ment of the constitution, establishing a  
permanent rule of the highest authori­  
ty, in place of an irregular precedent  
of constitution only.  
But it is understood that the nullify­  
ing doctrine imports that the decision of  
the State is to be presumed valid, and j  
that it overrules the law of the United-!  
States, unless overruled by three-fourths  
of the States.  
Can more be necessary to demonstrate  
the inadmissibility of such a doctrine,  
than that it puts it in the power of the  
smallest fraction over one Iburthof the  
United Slates,&#x27;that is, of seven states  
out of twenty-four, to give the law and  
even the constitution to seventeen states,  
each of the seventeen having, as parties  
to the constitution, an equal right with  
the seven, to expound it, and to insist  
on the exposition? That the seven  
might, in particular instances, be right,  
and the seventeen wrong, is more than  
possible. But to establish a positive  
and permanent rule, giving such a pow­  
er, to such a minority, over such a ma­  
jority, would overturn the first principle  
of free government,and in practice ne­  
cessarily overturn the government itself.  
It is to be recollected that the consti­  
tution was proposed to the people of the  
Sales as a 711 hole ^and unanimously adopt­  
ed by the States a whole, it being a part  
of the constitution that not less than  
three-fourths of the states should be  
competent to make any alteration in  
what had been unanimously agreed to.  
So great is the caution on this point, that  
in two cases where peculiar interests  
were at stake, aproportion even of three­  
fourths is distrusted, and unanimity re­  
quired to make an alteration.  
When the constitution was adopted  
as a whole, it is certain that there were  
many parts, which, if separately propos­  
ed, would have been promply rejected,  
j It is far from impossibility, that every  
1 part ef a constitution mi§ht bq rejected  
  
by a majority, and yet taken together  
as aw hole be unanimously accepted.  
Free constitutions will rarely if ever be  
formed, without reciprocal concessions-;  
without articles conditioned on and ba­  
lancing each other. Is there a consti­  
tution of a single State out of the twen­  
ty-four that would bear the experiment  
of having its comupnent parts submitted  
to the people and separately derided  
on?  
Vi hat the fate of the constitution of  
the United States would be if a small  
proportion of the States could expunge  
parts o! it particularly valued by a  
large majority, can have but one aiv  
SW’cr.  
The difficulty is not removed by limi­  
ting the doctrine to cases of construc­  
tion. How many cases of that sort,  
involving cardinal provisions of the con­  
stitution, have occurred? Ilow- many  
now exist? how many may hereafter  
spring up? How many might be in­  
geniously created,it entitled to the privi­  
lege of decision in the mode propos­  
ed?  
Is it certain that the principle of that  
inode would not reach farther than is  
contemplated. If a single State can of  
right require three fourths of its co-States  
to overrule its exposition of the consti­  
tution, because that proportion is au­  
thorised to amend it, would the plea be  
less plausible that, as the constitution  
w as unanimously established, it ought  
to be unanimously expounded?  
The reply to all such suggestions  
seems to be unavoidable and irresistible;  
that the Constitution is a compact; that  
its text is to be be expounded according  
to the provisions for expounding it—ma­  
king a part of the compact; and that  
none of the parties can rightfully re­  
nounce the expounding provision ’more  
than an v otbpr n:ir+_ \Vh*»n  
. , tr­  
acer ues, as may accrue, tt must grow  
out of abuses of the compact, releasing  
the suflerers from their fealty to it.  
In favor of the nullifying claim for  
the States, individually, it appears, as  
you observe, that the proceedings of tl&gt;c  
Legislature of Virginia, in ’98, and ia  
&#x27;90 against the Alien and Sedition Acts,  
are much dwelt upon.  
  
It may often happen, as experience  
proves that erroneous construction* rot  
anticipated, may not be Sufficiently  
guarded against, in the langauge used;  
and it is due to the distinguished iraH­  
vidoals, who have misconceived the in­  
tention of those proceedings, to sup­  
pose that the meaning of the Legisla­  
ture, though well comprehended at th©  
time, may not now be obvious to those  
unacquainted with the contemporary  
indications and impressions.  
But, it is believed, that by keeping­  
in view the distinction between the  
governmentsof the States,and the States  
in the sense in which they were parties  
to the constitution; between the rights  
of the parties, in their concurrent and  
their individual capacities; between the  
&#x27;several modes and objects of interposi­  
tion against the abuses of power, and  
especially between interpositions within  
the purview of the constitution, and in­  
terpositions appealing from the Consti­  
tution to the rights of nature,paramount  
to all constitutions; with an atten­  
tion, always of explanatory use to the  
views and arguments which were com*­  
bated, the Resolutions of Virginia, aa  
vindicated in the report on them, will  
be found entitled to an exposition, show­  
ing a consistency in their parts, and an  
inconsistency of the whole with thedoet  
trine under consideration.—I — ;  
That the legislature could not have it&gt;  
tended to sanction such a doctrine, if  
to be inferred from the debates in tbo  
House of Delegates, and from the ad­  
dress of the two houses to their constitu­  
ents, on the subject of the Resolutions*  
The tenor of the debates, which were  
ably conducted, and are understood to  
have been revised for f he press by most,  
if not all of the speakers, discloses no re­  
ference whatever to a constitutional right  
of an individval State to arrest by force  
the operation of a law of the United  
States. Concert among the States for  
redress against the Alien and Sedition  
Laws, as acts of usurped power, was a  
leading sentiment; and the attainment  
of a concert, the immediate object of the  
courses adopted by the legislature, which  
was that of inviting the other States «to  
concur in declaring the acts to be un­  
constitutional, a 1 to co-operole by the  
necessary and proper measures in main­  
taining unimpaired, the authorities,  
rights and liberties reserved to the States  
respectively and to the people.”* That  
by the necessary and proper measures  
to be concurrently and co-operatively taken,  
were meant measures known to the  
Constitution,particularly the ordinary  
control of the people and legislatures  
of the States, over the government of  
the United States, cannot be doubted?  
and the interposition of this control, ait  
the event showed, was equal to the oc­  
casion.  
It is worthy of remark, and expira­  
tory of the intentions of the legislature,

4bat the words ‘‘lud law, but utterly

word ‘Unconstitutional,” were stiuck

‘unconstitutional,’ yet to guard against  
a misunderstanding of this phrase as

tme WtWTC*

The published address of the Legis­  
Iatnre to the people, their constituents,  
affords another conclusive evidence ol  
its views. The Address warns thorn a*  
gainst the encroaching spirit of the  
oeneral Government, argues the uncon­  
etitutiooality of the Alien and Sedition  
Acts, points to other instances in which  
the constitutional limits had been over­  
leaped ; dwells upon the dangerous mode  
of deriving power by implication; and  
in general presses the necessity of watch­  
ing over the consolidating tendency of  
the Federal policy. But nothing is said  
that can be understood to look to means  
of maintaining the rights of the States,  
beyond the regular ones, within the  
forms of the Constitution.  
If any farther lights on the subject  
could he needed, a very strong one is  
reflected in the answers of the resolu­  
tions, by the States which protested n­  
gainst them. The main objection of  
these, beypnd a few general complaints  
of the inflammatory tendency of tlie Re­  
solutions, was directed against the as­  
sumed authority of a State Legislature  
to declare a law of the United States to  
be unconstitutional,which they pronoun­  
ced an unwarrantable interference with  
the exclusive jurisdiction of tlie Su­  
preme Court of the United States.—  
Had the resolutions been regarded as  
avowing and maintaining a right, in an  
individual state, to arrest, by force, the  
ciccutionof the law of the United States  
it must be presumed that it would have  
been a conspicuous object of their de­  
nunciation. With cordial salutations,

this experiment, the example will soon be imitated  
by others; acts of nullification will become as fre­  
quent as the sessions of Congress. In this way the  
constitution might linger for a few years through n  
sickly existence; hut it would at last be driven to the  
same fatal destiny.  
* The following is the opinion of Mr Madison, which is be­  
lieved to he conclusive aim incontrovertible.  
The Constitution was funned by the state*, that is by the  
people in each of the seates, acting in their highest sovereign  
capacity; and formed consequently hy the same authority  
which formed the state constitutions. Being thus derived  
front the same source ns the constitutions of the states, it has  
within each state the same authorifv us the constitution of  
the state, nnd is ns much a constitution, in the strict sense of  
the term, within its prescrib&#x27;d sphere, ns the constitutions of  
the states are within their prescribed spheres, but with this  
obvious and essential difference, that being a compact among  
the states, in their highest sovereign capacity, anti constitu­  
ting the profile thereof one people, for certain purposes. it can­  
not he altered or annullt .7 at the will of the state individually,  
as the constitution of a state may be, at its individual will.—  
A political system that does not provide for a peaceable and  
authoritative termination of concurring controversies, would  
not be more than the shadow of a government. The object

“Should the provisions of the Constitution, as hero re­  
viewed, be found not to secure the Government and tho 1  
rights of the States, against usurpations and abuses, on the &#x27;  
part oi tho United Stales, the liu.il resort, within the pur &#x27;  
view of the Constitution, lies in an amendment to the ■  
Constitution, according to a process applicable by the &#x27;  
States.”  
“And in the event ol the failure ol every constitutional  
resort, and an accumulation ot usurpations and abuses, ren­  
dering passive obedience, and non-resistance a greater  
evil than resistance and revolution; there can remain but &#x27;  
one resort, the hist of all—an appeal from the cancelled  
obligations of the constitutional compact, to original rights,  
and the law of self-preservation. This is the ultima ratio  
under all governments, whether consolidated, confedera­  
ted, or a compound of both; and it cannot ho doubted,  
that a single member of the Union, in the extremity sup­  
posed, but in that 011I3&#x27;, rvould have a right, as an extra  
and ultra-constitutional right, to make the appeal.  
“This brings us to the expedient lately advanced, which  
claims for a single State a right to appeal against an exer- I  
rise of power by the Government of tho United States,  
decided by the State to he unconstitutional, to the parties  
to the constitutional compact; the decision of the State  
to have the effect of nullifying the acts ot the Govern­  
ment of the United States, unless the decision oi the  
State he reversed by three-fourths of the parties.  
“The distinguished names and high authorities which  
appear to have asserted and given a practical scope to this  
doctrine, entitle it to a respect which it might he difficult  
otherwise to leel lor it.  
“ If the doctrine were to he understood as requiring the  
three-fourths of the states to sustain, instead of that pro­  
porlion to reverse, the decision of the appealing state, tin­  
decision to he without effect during the appeal, it would  
he sufficient to remark, that this extra-constitutional course  
might well give way to that marked out by the Constitu­  
tion, which authorizes two-thirds of the states to institute  
and three-fourths to effectuate an amendment ol the Con­  
stitution, establishing* permanent rule of the highest au­  
thority, in the place of an irregular precedent ol construc­  
tion only.  
  
“ But it is understood that the nullifying doctrine im- j  
ports, that the decision of the State is to he presumed va- j  
lid, uml that it overrules the law of the United States, un- j  
less overruled by three-fourths of the Slates.”  
“Can more l&gt;e necessary to demonstrate the inadmiasi- !  
liility ot such a doctrine, than that it puts it iu ibe power i  
of the smallest fraction over one-fourth of the U. States, i  
that is, of seven States out of twenty-four, to give the law  
and even the Constitution to seventeen States, each of (bo  
seventeen having, as parties to the Constitution, an equal j  
right with each of tho seven, to expound it, ami to insist !  
on the exposition ? That the seven might, in particular in- i  
stances, be right, and the seventeen wrong, is more than  
possible: But to establish a positive and permanent rule I  
giving such a power, to such a minority, over such a ma- |  
jority, would overturn the first principle of free govern- \
nicnt.aud in practice necessarily overturn the government I  
itself.  
“ H i* lo he recollected, that the Constitution was pro- &#x27;  
posed to tho people as a whole, and unanimously adopted  
by the States as a whole, it being a part ol the Constitu- i  
lion that not less than three-fourths of the States should be  
competent to make any alteration in what had been unani­  
mously agreed to. So great is the caution on this point,  
that in two casus where peculiar interests were at stake a  
proportion even of If.sec tom tits is distrusted, and unanimi­  
ty required lo make an alteration.  
  
“ When the Constitution was adopted as a whole, it is  
certain that there were many parts, which, it separately  
proposed, would liavo been promptly rejected. It is far  
from impossible, that every part ol a constitution might be  
rejected by a majority, and yet taken together as a whole  
he unanimously accepted. Free constitutions will rarely,  
il ever, b« mi med without reciprocal concessions; without  
articles conditioned on, and balancing each other. Is there  
a Constitution of a single State out ol the twenty-four, that  
would bear the experiment of having its component parts  
submitted to the people and separately decided on ?  
^&#x27;’,c 0 ,*l° ^’on,fHulion of the United States  
would he, if a small proportion of the States could expunge  
purls ol it particularly valued by a large majority,can have  
Imt one answer.  
“ * •&#x27;« slifficulty is not removed by limiting the rioclftnc  
to css. s of construction. Mow many cases of that sbrl,  
involving cardinal provisions of the Constitution, Imvcoc­  
ciirrcil. Mow many now exist ? how many may hereafter  
spring up. Mow many might he ingeniously created, if  
entitled to the privilege of decision in Ihc mode proposed ?  
, &#x27; rinr*,|in that the principle of that mode would not  
icnrh further than is contemplated ? If a single State can  
l . right require three-fourths of its co-Slates to over-rule  
its exposition of the Constitution, because lhat proportion  
is authon/.ed lo amend it, would the plea he less plausible  
dial, as the Constitution was unanimously established, it  
ought to he unanimously expounded?  
■ Vi* reHy oil such suggestions seems to he una­  
void ddo and irresistible; that the Constitution is a com­  
part ; that its text is to he expounded according tn&lt;4hr  
provisions for expounding If—making a pari oi the coni

TO THE EDITORS OF THE K.YQIHRER.  
THE VIRGINIA DOCTRINES,  
Not Nullification—[No. VI.]  
Tho opinions ol Mr. Madison as to the supposed analo­  
gy, between the .N unification doctrines and those main­  
tained in the Virginia Report and Resolutions, will appear  
from the passages I am about to insert, in ins letter to  
the Editor of the Review, he says: -  
“ In favor of the nullifying claim for tho Slates indivi­  
dual!}, it appears, as you observe, that tho proceedings of  
the Legislature ol Virginia in ’US and ’UU, against the alien  
and sedition acts, are much dwelt upon.”  
” It may often happen, as experience proves, that erro­  
neous constructions not anticipated, may not he sufficiently  
guarded against in tho language used ; and it is due to the  
distinguished individuals who have misconceived the in­  
tention of those proceedings, to suppose that the meaning  
of the Legislature, though well comprehended at the time,  
may not now he obvious to those unacquainted with the  
contemporary indications and impressions.”  
“ I3ul it is believed, that l&gt;y keeping in view the di-tinc­  
lion between the government of the States, and the States  
in the sense in which they were parties to the Constitu­  
tion ; between the rights of the parties in their concurrent  
and in their individual capacities ; between the Several  
modes and objects of interposition against the abuses of  
power, and especially between interpositions within the  
purview of the Constitution, and interpositions appealing  
from the Constitution to the rights of nature, paramount to  
all Constitutions; with an attention always of explanatory  
use, to the views and arguments which&#x27;were combated;  
the resolutions of Virginia, as vindicated in tho report on  
them, will be found entitled to an exposition, shewing a  
consistency in their parts, ami an inconsistency of The  
whole will* the doctrine under consideration.  
1 hat the Legislature could not have intended to sanc­  
tion such a doctrine, is to be inferred from the Debates in  
the House of Delegates, and from the Address of tho two  
Houses to their constituents on the subject of the resolu­  
tions. The tenor of the debates, which were ably conduct­  
ed, and are understood to have beer, revised for the press,  
by most if not all ot the speakers, discloses no reference  
whatever to a constitutional right of an individual Slate, to  
arrest by force the operation of a law of the United States, ,  
Concert among the States for redress against the alien and  
sedition laws, as acts of usurped power, was a leading sen- J  
timent; and the attainment of a concert, the immediate!  
object of the course by the Legislature, which was that I  
ol inviting the other States “ to concur in declaring the ;  
“ acts to he unconstitutional, and to co-operate by the nr- I  
“ cessary and proper measures, in maintaining unimpaired, :  
“ the authorities and right* reserved to the States reaper- i  
lively and to the people. I hat by the necessary and |  
proper measures to he concurrently and co-operatively la- 1  
•ten, were meant measures known to the Constitution, par- &lt;  
ticulaidy the ordinary control of the people and the I.egis- ;  
I at u res of the Slates over tho Government of the United j  
States, cannot he doubted ; and the interposition of this!  
control, as the event shewed, was equal to the occasion.  
“It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the inten- I  
Rons of the Legislature, that the word* “not law. but ot- I  
terly null, void, and of no force or effect,” which bad fol­  
lowed in one of die Resolutions Hie word “unconstHu­  
tional,” were struck out by common consent.—Though the I  
words were in part but synonimotis with “unconsfilution­  
al”—yet, to guard against a misunderstanding of this  
phrase as more than declaratory of opinion, the word “un­  
constitutional” alone was retained, as not liable to that  
danger.”

That the semi might, jn particular instances be

our present form of government than did  
Mr. Madison no mau better understood  
its theory and more especially, no man  
can be so confidently relied on, as to the  
nature and object of the Virginia report  
and resolutions as he who conceived and  
matured them. In his letter to the edi­  
tor of the North American Review, ( 830)  
he speaks thus &quot;In the event of the  
failure of every constitutional resort, and  
an accumulation of usurpations and abu­  
ses, rendering passive obedience and  
non-resistance, a greater evil than resist­  
ance and revolution, there can remain  
but one resort an appeal from the can­  
celled obligations of the constitutional  
compact, to original rights and the law of  
self-preservation: This is the ultima ratio  
under all governments, whether consoli­  
dated, confederated or a compound of  
both; and it cannot be doubted that a  
single member of the Union, in the extre­  
mity supposed, but in that only, would  
have a right, as an extra and ultra consti­  
tutional right to make the appeal. This  
brings us to the expedient lately advan­  
ced, which claims for a single SrntP n  
  
Tight to appeal against an exercise of  
  
power by the government of the United  
States, decided by the State to be un­  
constitutional, to the parties to the fede­  
ral compact; ihe decision of the State to  
have the effect of nullifying the acts of the  
government of the United States, unless  
the decision of the State be reversed by  
three-fourths of the parties. The distin­  
guished names and high authorities which  
appear to have asserted and given a prac­  
tical scope to this doctrine, entitle it to a  
respect which it might be difficult other  
wise to feel for it,&quot; &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Subse

Montpelier, August, IvlO.  
‘Dear Sir:  
‘1 have duly received your letter, in which  
von refer to the “nullifying doctrine,” advoca­  
ted as a constitutional tight, by some of our dis  
tinguished fellow-citizens; and to the proceed  
ings of the Va. legislature in *1)8 &amp;. ’ill), as ap  
pealed to in behalf of that doctrine; and you  
express a wish for my ideas ott those subjects.  
‘I am aware of the delicacy of the task m  
some respects, and :he difficulty in every re­  
spect, of doing full justice to it. 15.it having,  
in more than one instance, complied with a  
like request from other friendly quarters, I do  
not decline a sketch of the views which 1 have  
been led to take of the doctrine in question, a­  
well as sortie others connected with litem; and  
of the grounds from which it appears, that the  
proceedings of Virginia have beeu misconceiv­  
ed by those who have appealed to them. Ir.  
order to understand the true character of the  
Constitution of the United States, the error,  
not uncommon, must he avoided, of viewing  
it through the mediant, either of a consolidat­  
ed Government, or of a confederated Govern­  
  
ncnt, whilst it is neither the one nor the other;  
nit a mixture &lt;4 both. And having, in no mcd­  
:J, the similitudes and analogies applicable t&lt;»  
*ther systems of Government, it must, more  
ban any other,he its own interpreter, accord­  
ing to its text ahd facts the of the case.  
‘From these [f will be,seen the characteris­  
in&#x27; peculiarities of ihu Constitution are, 1. the  
mode of its foruatiou; 2, the division of the  
supreme powed of Government between the  
Slates in their ini ted capacity, and the States  
m their indivuhpl capacities.  
‘1. F was firmed, not by the Government­  
•f the ci.mponeit States, as the Federal G &gt;\
ernment for whim it was substituted was form­  
ed. Nor was i t rrned by a majority of the  
people of the U:it-d States, as a single com­  
inmiity, in the nk itu • u consolidated Gov­  
ernment.  
‘It was firmed by the States; that is, by the  
i ct ; le in each of the States; acting in their  
highest sovereign capacity; and firmed conse­  
quently by the same authority which forme&#x27;1  
the State G nstituti iris.  
  
‘.»eingtins derived from the same source  
the Constitutions of die States, it has, vvithi.  
each Slate, the s um*, authority as the Constilu  
tion of the S ate; and is as much a Constit  
tion, in the* strict sense of the term, within its  
prescribe} sphere, as the Constitutions of the  
Slates are, within their respective spheres: bin  
with this i&gt;hvic»tis and essential difference, th *  
beingn mtnpnct anwngthe States in their high  
est sovereign capacity, and constituting tho  
people thereof one people for certain purposes ,  
it cannot be altered or annulled at the will of  
the State individually, as the Constitution of &amp;  
State may he at its individual will.  
‘2. And that it divides the supreme powers  
of Government, between the Government »&gt;:  
the United States, and the Government of the  
individual States,is stamped on the face of the  
instrument; the powers of war and of tax­  
ation, of commerce and of treaties, and othr  
enumerated powers vested in the Government  
of the United States, being of ns high and sove­  
reign a &lt;lnr .cter, as any of the powers re  
served to the S a&#x27;e Governments  
‘Nor is the Government of the Uniter  
Slates created by the Constitution, less a Gov­  
ernment in the strict sense of the term, within  
the sphere of irs powers, than the G vermnent*  
created by the Constitutions of the States arc.  
w ithin »h«ir several spheres. It is like them  
organized into Legislative, Executive, and  
Judicial&quot;. Departments. It operates, like them  
distinctly on persons and things. And, lik  
them,it has at command a physical force fn ex­  
executing the powers committed to it. The  
concurrent operation m certain cases, is one o;  
the features making the peculiarity of the sys  
tern.  
‘Between these different Constitutional Gov­  
ernments, the one. operating in all the States,  
the others operating separately in each, with  
the aggregate powers of Government divided  
between them, it could not escape attention,  
that controversies would arise concerning the  
boundaries of jurisdiction; and that some pro­  
vision ought tu be made for such occurrences.  
A political system that doc3 not provide f »r a  
peaceable and authoritative termination of oc­  
curring controversies, would not be more than  
ihe shadow of 3 Government; the object and  
end of a real Government being, the substitu­  
tion of law an^ order, for uncertainty, confu­  
sion, and violence.  
  
‘1 hat, to htfve left a final decision, in such  
cases, to each!of the States, then thirteen, and  
a!roadv twentv-four, could not fail to make the  
Constitution and laws of the United States  
different in different States, was obvious; and  
n &gt;t less obvious, that this diversity of inde­  
pendent decisions must altogether distract the  
Government of the Union, and speedily put an  
end to the Union itself. An uniform authori­  
ty of the laws, is in itself a vital principle.  
Some of the most important laws could not be  
partially executed. They must be executed  
in all the States, or they could be duly execu­  
ted in none. An impost, or an excise, for  
example, if not in force in some States, would  
be defeated in others. It is well known that  
this was among the lessons of experience,  
which had a primary influnce in bringing about  
the existing Constitution. A loss of its general  
authority would moreover rev ive the exaspera­  
ting questions between the States holding ports  
f»r foreign commerce, and the adjoining States  
without them to which are now added all the  
inland States, necessarily carrying on their  
foreign commerce through other Suites.  
‘To have made the decision under the au­  
thority of the individual States, co-oruinate, in  
ail cases, with decisions under the authority  
of the United States, would unavoidably pro­  
duce collisions incompatible with the peace of  
society, and with that regular and efficient ad  
ministration, which is the essence of free gov­  
ernments. Scenes could not be avoided, in  
which a ministerial officer of the United States,  
and the corresponding officer of an individual  
State, would have rencontres in executing con­  
flicting decrees; the result of which would de &lt;  
pond on the comparative force of the local pos  
scs attending them; and that, a casualty de­  
pending on the political opinions and part}  
(eelings in different States.  
‘To have referred every clashing decision,  
under the two authorities, for a final decision,  
to the States ns parties to the Constitution,  
would be attended with delays, with inconve­  
niences, and with expenses, amounting to u  
prohibition of the expedient; not to mention  
ts tendency to impair the salutary veneration  
ora system requiring such frequent interpos?  
ton®, nor the delicate questions which migh  
  
present themselves as to the f&#x27;ortn of stating the  
appeal, and us to the quorum for deciding it.  
‘To have trusted to negotiation for adjusting  
disputes between the Government of tho U.  
S. and the Stale Governments, as between  
independent and separate sovereignties, would  
have lost sight altogether of a Constitution  
and Government for the Union; and opened a  
direct road from n failure of that resort, to the  
ultima ration between nations wholv independ­  
ent of and alien to each other. If the idea  
had its origin in the process of adjustment, be­  
tween separata branches of the same Govern­  
ment, the analogy entirely fails. In the case  
■f disputes between independent parts of tho  
t ame Governments, neither par* being able te  
&#x27; tnsumatc its Mill, nor the Government to pro­  
ceed without a concurrence of the parts, neces­  
sity brings uncut an RCttomnusl-ti— I . ,j  
/utes been a State Government, and the Gov­  
ernment of the United States, the ease is praC­  
  
iicailv, rs well as theoretically,dim rent; &quot;&#x27;:&quot;U  
party possessing all the departments el an  
organized government, legislative, executive,  
judiciary; and having each a phyiscal foroe td  
upport its pretensions. Although the issue of  
negotiation might sometimes avoid this extrem  
itv, how often would it happen among so many  
M ates, that an unaccommodating spirit in some  
would render that resoureeu navailing? A  
contrary supposition would not accord with a  
knowledge of human nature, oi the evidence j  
of nnrown political history.  
‘The Constitution, not relying on any of the  
rcceeding modifications, for its safe and sue*  
••essful operation, has expressly declared  
n one hand—1. “that the Constitution, and  
die laws made in pursuance thereof, and all  
trenties made under the the authority of the  
United States, shall he the supreme law of the  
land; 2, that the Judges of every State shall  
n hound thereby, any thing in the Constitution  
and laws of any State to tho contrary notwitb- ,  
standing; I), that the judicial power of tli­  
United States shall extend to all cases in law I  
id equity arising under the Con-titulion, the ’  
laws of the United States, and treaties made  
under their authority, &amp;c.”  
‘Oo the othar hand as a security of thb  
: ightsand powers of the Slates, in their mdi­  
v ideal oa|&gt;acities, against an undue prep ndor­  
..-nee of the powers granted to the Govern­  
ment aver them in their united capacity, the  
Constitution has relied oo—I, the rcsponsiailj­  
i’- »f the Senators and Representatives in the  
Legislature of tile United States to the Legis  
iatures and people of the States; 2, the respoli  
-ibililyof the President to the people of the  
United States; and 3, the liability of the Ex­  
ecutive and Judicial fi nction-vn&#x27;ev of the. Uni.  
ted States to impeachment bv the Represents  
lives of the people of the States, in one branch  
of the Legislature of the United States, and  
srial by the Representatives of the States, it.  
the other branch: the State functionaries, Ltj  
gislative, Executive, and Judicial, being, at  
• lie same time, in thuir appointment and re­  
sponsibility, altogother independent of the  
agency or authoritv of tho United States.  
H ow far this structure of the Government of  
the United Slates is adequate and safe for its ;  
ejects, time alone can absolutely determine.  
Experience seems to have shown, that, what­  
ever may grow out of future stages of our na­  
tional career, there is, as vet, a sufficient con­  
trol, in the popular will over the Executive  
and L: gislative Departments of the Govern­  
ment. When the Alien and Sedition Laws  
were passed in contravention to the opinions  
and feelings of the community, the first elec­  
tions thut ensued put an end to them. And  
whatever may have been the character of  
other acts, in the judgment of many of ns,it is  
but true, that they generally accorded with the  
views of a majority of the States and of the  
people. At the present day, it seems well un­  
derstood, that the laws which have created  
most dissatisfaction, have had a like sanction  
without doors; und that, whether continued;  
varied, or repealed, like proof will be given  
of the sympathy and responsibility of tho  
Representative body, to the constituent body.  
Indeed, the great complaint now is, against tho  
results of this sympathy and responsibility, in  
the Legislative policy of the nation.  
  
‘With respect to the judicial power of the •  
United States, and the authority of the So- 1  
preme Courts in relation to the boundary of  
jurisdiction of the Federal and the State Gov­  
ernments, I mnv be permitted to refer to the  
thirty-ninth number of the “Federalist,”* foTic,  
the light in which the subject was regarded ,1c  
by its writer, at the period when the Const itu-&gt;  
tion was depending; a„d it is believed, that the  
same \va6 the prevailiag view then taken of it,  
that the same view has continued to prevail,  
and that it does so at this timo, notwithstand­  
ing the eminent exception to it.  
‘But itis perfectly consistent with the con■&gt;  
cession of this power to the supreme Court, in.  
cases falling within the course of its functions,  
to maintain that the power has not always been  
rightly exercised. To say nothing of iho pe­  
riod, happily a short one, when Judges in their  
-cuts did not abstain from intemperate and  
party harangues, equally at variance with  
heir dignity, there have been occasional de­  
cisions from the bench, which have iucurred  
.-•&#x27;rious and extensive disapprobation. Still it  
would seem, that, with hut few exceptions,Vhe  
course of the Judiciary has been hitherto  
sustained by the predominant sense of the  
Nation.  
‘Those who have denied or doubted the  
jpremaey of the judicial power of the United  
States, aj J denounce at the same time a uulli­  
ying putver in the States, seem not to hare

ture and aggravation of the case,  
Mr. Madison’s letter-concluded.  
‘Should the provisions of the Constitution  
as here reviewed, be found not to secure the&#x27;  
Government and rights of the Slates against;  
usurpations and abuses on the part of the  
United States, the final resort, within the pur­  
view of the Constitution, lies in an amend­  
ment ol the Constitution, according to a pro­  
cess applicable by the S ates.  
‘And in the event of a failure of every con­  
otitutinnn! rp-anrt, and accumulation of usurj&gt;a­  
tions and abuses, rendering passive obedience  
and non-resistance a greater evil than resist­  
ance and revolution, there can remain but one  
resort, the last of all; an appeal from the can  
celled obligations of the constitutional com­  
pact, to original rights and the law of self-pre­  
servation. This is the ultima ratio under all j  
Governments, whether consolidated, c nfe ler­  
uted, ora compound ofbeth; and it cannot be  
doubted, that a single member of the Un­  
ion, in the extremity supposed, but in that  
o ily, would have u righ% as an extra and ultra­  
constitutional right, to make the appeal.  
‘This brings us to the expedient lately ad­  
vanced, which claims for a single State a right  
to appeal against an exercise of power !&gt;v the  
Government of the United States decided by  
the State to be unconstitutional, to the parties  
to the constitutional compact; the decision of  
the State to have the effect of uullitying the  
act of the Government of the United States&#x27;  
unless the decision of the State be reversed by  
three fourths of the parties.  
  
‘ 1 he distinguished names and high authori­  
ties which appear to have asserted and given a  
practical scope to the doctrine, entitle n to a  
respect which it might he difficult otherwise to  
feel for it.  
‘If the doctrine were to he understood re­  
quiring the three fourths of the States to sus­  
tain, instead of that proportion to reverse the  
decision of the appealing Slate, the decision to  
he without effect during the appeal, it would he  
sufficient to remark, that this extra-constitu­  
tional course might well give way to that  
marked out by the Constitution, which authori­  
zes two thirds of the States to institute and  
three fourths to effectuate an amendment of  
the Constitution, establishing a permanent rule  
of the lightest authority, in place of an irreg­  
ular precedent of construction only.  
  
‘Bui it is understood that the nullifying doc­  
trine imports that the decision of the State is  
to be presumed valid, and that it overrules the  
law of the United States, unless overruled by  
thiee fourths of the States.  
‘Can more be necessary to demonstrate the  
inadmissibility of such a doctrine, than that it  
puts it in the power of the smallest fraction  
over one fourth of the United States, that is, of  
seven States out of twenty-dour, to give the  
law and even the Constitution to the seventeen  
States, each of the seventeen haviug, as par­  
ties to the Constitution, an equal right with  
each ol the seven, to expound it, and to insist  
on the exposition? That the seven might, in  
particular insiunces be right, and the seventeen  
wrong, is more than possible. But to estub  
lish a positive and permanent rule giving such  
power, to such a minority, over such a majori­  
ty, would overturn the first principle office  
government, and in practice necessarily over­  
turn the Government itself.  
‘It is to be recollected that the Constitu­  
tion was proposed to the people of the State­  
as a whole, and unammosly adopted by tin  
States as a whole, it being a part of the Con­  
stitution th&amp;i no less than throe fourths of the  
  
States should be competent to make any alter­  
ation in what had been unanimously agreed to.  
So great is the caution on this point, that in  
two cases where peculiar interests were at  
stake, a proportion even oi three fourths is  
distrusted, and unanimity required to make an  
alteration.  
•When the Constitution was adopted as a  
whole, it is certain that there were many  
parts, which, if separately proposed, would  
have been promptly rejected. It is far from  
impossible, that every part of a Constitution  
might be rejected by a majority, and yet taken  
together as a whole b- unanimously accepted.  
Free Constitution will rarely if ever be formed  
without reciprocal concessions; without arti­  
cles conditioned on and balancing each other.  
Is there a Constitution of a single State out of  
•he twenty-four that would bear the experiment  
&gt;f having its componer^t parts submitted to the  
people and separately decided on?  
‘What the fate of the Constitution of the  
United States would be, if a small proportion  
f the States could expunge parts of it partieu­  
arly valued by a large majority,can have but  
one answer.  
  
‘The difficulty is not removed by limiting  
rhe doctrine to cases of construction. II v  
many cases of that sort, involving cardinal pro­  
visions of the Constitution, have occurred?  
How many now exis ? H«»w many may here­  
after spring up^ How many might be ingen­  
iously created, if entitled to the privilege of a,  
decision it* the mode proposed?  
‘Is it certain that the principle of that mod.*  
would not reach further than is contemplated?  
If a single State can ot right require the three­  
fourths of its co-States to overrule its exposi­  
tion of the Constitution, because that propor­  
tion is authorized to amend it, would the plea  
be less plausible that as, the Constitution was  
unanimously established, it ought to he unan­  
imously expounded?  
‘Thereply to all such snggestions seems t •  
be unavoidable and irresistible; that the Con­  
stitution is a compact, that its text is to be ex-&#x27;  
pounded according to the provisions more  
than any other part. When such a right ac­  
t-rues, as may accrue, it must grow out ol  
abuses of the compact releasing the sufferers  
from their fealty to it.  
‘In favor of the nullifying claim for the  
States, individually, it appears, as you obser e  
• hat the proceedings &lt;&gt;f the legislature ol Vir­  
ginia, in ’1)8 aud ’1)9, against the Alien and  
Sedition Acts, are much dwelt upon.  
‘It may often happen, as experience prove*,  
that erroneous constructions not, anticipate.:,  
may not be sufficiently guarded against, in the  
I language used; and it is due to the distinguish­  
ed individuals, who have misconceived the  
intention of those proceedings to suppose that  
the meaning of the Legislature, though well  
comprehended at the time, may not now be  
obvious, to those unacquainted with the con  
temporary indications and impressions.  
‘But it is believed that by keeping in view  
the distinction between the Government of the  
States, and the States in the sense in which  
they are parties to the Constitution; between  
the rights of the parties, in their concurrent  
and in their individual capacities; between the  
several modes a d objects of interposition  
against the abuses ot power, and especially  
between interp sitions within the purview of  
the Constituti &gt;n, and interpositions appealing  
from the Constitution to the rights of nature  
paramount to all constitutions with an inten  
tion, always of explanatory use, to the views  
•md arguments which were combatted, the  
Resolutions of Virginia, as vindicated in the  
Report on them, wili be found entitled to an  
exposition, showing a consistency in their parts  
and an inconsistency of the whole with the  
doctrine under consideration.  
  
‘That the Legislature could not have intent,  
ed to sanction such a doctrine, is to lie interred  
from the debates in the House ot Delegates,  
and from the address of the two Houses to heir  
constituents, oil the subject of the Rcsoluiina  
The tenor of the debates, v hicli were aid)  
conducted,and understood to have been revised  
torthe press by most, if not all,of the speakers,  
discloses no reference whatever to a consiilti  
tional right in an individual State to arrest by  
force the operation of a law of the United  
States. Concert afiiong the States for  
redress against the alien and sedition laws, as  
acts of usurped power, w as leading sentiment,  
and the attainment of a concert, the immediate  
object of ihe course adopted by the Legisla  
ture, which was that of inviting the other  
States “to concur in declaring the acts to he  
unconstitutional, and to co operate, b) the  
necessarv and proper measures, in maintain  
lug unimpaired the authorities, rights, and  
liberties leserved to the Sates respectively,  
and to the I’eop!e.”t Thai by the necessary  
and proper measures to he currently and co­  
operatively taken,were meant measures know n  
to the Constitution, particularly the ordinary  
control of the People and Legislatures of the  
States, over the Government of the United  
Stales, cannot lie doubted; and the interposi  
lion of this control, as the event showed, was  
equal to the occasion.  
•It is worthy of remark,and explanatory of the  
intentions of the Legislature, that the words  
“not law, but utterly null, void, and of no force  
or effect,” which had followed, in one of the  
Resolutions, the word “unconstitutional,” were  
struck out by common consent. Though the  
words were in fact hut synonymous with “un  
^institutional,” yet to guard against a liusun  
■lerslanding of this phrase as more than  
tecluratory of opinion, the word “unconstitu  
,101ml,” alone was retained. a« not liable to that  
danger  
  
‘The published Address of the Legislature  
to the Peep le, their constituents, uflords an  
other conclusive evidence of its views. The  
Address warns them against the encroaching

“In order,” savs he, “to onh&#x27;rs&#x27;.tnd the  
true character of the Constitution or the United  
States, the error, not uncommon, must b • uvo d  
ed of viewing it through the medium, either of a  
Consolidated Government,” (as Mr MeDi ffi j  
in 1821 viewed it.) “ or of a Confederated Go  
vernment,” (as Mr. McDuffie in 1833 views it,)  
“ whilst it is neither the one nor the other; but !  
a mixture of both. And having in no model the  
similitudes and analogies applic able to other svs  
terns of Government, it must, m ire than any  
other, be its own interpreter, according to its  
text, and the facts of the case. It was form-d  
bv the States; that is, by the People in each of  
the Stales, acting in their highest sovereign &lt; a  
parity, and formed consequently by the same au  
thority which formed the State Constitution*.—  
Being thus derived from the saoie source as the  
Constitution of the States, it lias, within each  
State, the same authority as the Constitution of  
the State, and is as much a Constitution, in the  
strict sense of the term, within its prescribed  
sphere,-a9 the Constitution of the States are.  
  
within ineir respective spheres: but with Ibis ob  
vious and essential difference, that being a com  
pact among the States in their highest sovereign  
capacity, and constituting the People thereof one  
People for certain purposes, it cannot be alter­  
ed or annulled at the will of the States indivi­  
dually, as the Con&gt;.tituiion of a State may be at  
its individual will.  
“ .ind that it diviiles the stipreme powers of

The Constitution Vindicated In a letter to Mr. E.  
Everett, dated in August, 1830, Mr. Madison gives,  
0 few words, his views of the true character of the  
Constitution ol tbe United States. We are not less  
impressed with the precision and condensation of this  
extract, than with the great fundamental truths which it  
authoritatively expounds.  
&quot; In order,&quot; says he, &quot; to undcrtand the true charac­  
ter of the Constitution of the United States, the error,  
not uncommon, must be avoided, of viewing it through  
tbe medium, either of a consolidated Government,&quot; (as  
Mr. McDuffie, in 1321, viewed it,) &quot;or of a Confede­  
rated Government,&quot; (as Mr. McDuffie, in J833, views  
itj u whilst it is neither the one nor the other ; but a  
mixture of both. And having in no model the similitudes  
and analogies applicable to other systems of Govern­  
ment, it must, more than any other, be its own interpreter,  
according to its text, and the facts of the case. It was  
.formed by the States ; lAat is, by the People in each of the  
Mates,. acting in their highest sovereign capacity, and  
formed consequently by the same authority which form­

the same source as the Constitution of the States, it has,  
within each Ste, the same authority as the Constitu­

strict sense of the term, within its prescribed sphere, as  
the Constitution of the States are, within their respec­

written to him, referring to the proceedings of  
the Virginia Legislature of 1798-&#x27;99, as appealed  
to in behalf of the Nullifying doctrine which had  
then just bloomed into existence. Without a  
word of comment (because it would be both pre­  
sumptuous and superfluous) we extract from the  
Letter the following passages touching the points  
embraced in the Enquirer&#x27;s argument:  
44 Between these different Constitutional Govern­  
* ments, the one operating &#x27;in all the States, the  
4 others operating separately in each, with the ag­  
* gregate powers of Government divided between  
4 them, it could not escape attention that controver­  
4 sies would arise concerning the boundaries of ju­  
risdiction, and that some provision ought to be  
* made for such occurrences. A political system  
4 that does not provide for a peaceable and autho­  
* ritative termination of occurring controversies,  
* would not be more than the shadow of a Govern­  
4 metit, the object and end of a real Government  
4 being the substitution of law and order for uncer­  
* tainty, confusion, and violence.&quot;  
&quot;The Constitution has expressly declared?  
41, 4 That the Constitution, and the laws made  
4 in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made un­  
4 der the authority of the United States, shall be  
4 the supreme law of the land; 2, that the Judges  
4 of every State shall be bound thereby, any thing  
* in the constitution and laws of any State to the  
4contrary notwithstanding; 3, that the Judicial  
4 power of the United Stales shall extend to all cases  
* in law and equity arising under the Constitution,  
4 the laws of the United States, and treaties made  
4 under their authority,&#x27; &amp;c.&quot;  
44 Should the provisions of the Constitution be  
4 found not to secure the government and rights of  
4 the States against usurpations and abuses on the  
4 part of the United States, the final resort within  
4 the purview of the Constitution lies in an amend­  
4 ment of the Constitution, according to a pro­  
4 cess applicable by the States.  
44 And in the event of the failure of every con­  
* stitutional resort, and an accumulation of usurpa­  
4 tions and abuses, rendering passive obedience and  
4 non-resistance a greater evil than resistance and  
4 revolution, there can remain but one resort, the  
4 last of all?an appeal from the cancelled obliga­  
* tions of the compact to original rights and the law  
4 of self-preservation. This is the ultima ratio  
4 under all Governments, whether consolidated, con­  
federated, or a compound of both; and it cannot  
4 be doubted that a single member of the Union,  
4 [[not a Confederacy of States.?Editors.&#x27;] in the  
4 extremity supposed, but in that only, would  
4 have a right, as an extra and ultra-constitutional  
4 right, to make the appeal.

44 That the Legislature [of Virginia] could not have  
4 intended to sanction such a doctrine, is to be inferred  
?* from the debates in the House of Delegates, and  
* from the address of the two houses to their consti­  
4 tuents on the subject of the resolutions. The tenor  
* of the, debates, which were ably conducted, and  
* are understood to have been revised for the press  
* by most, if not all of the speakers, discloses no  
4 reference whatever to a constitutional right of  
* an individual State to arrest by force the opera­  
4 tion of a law of the United States.&quot; Concert  
-* among the States for redress against the alien and  
* sedition laws, as acts of usurped power, was a  
4 leading sentiment; and the attainment of a eon­  
4 cert the immediate object of the course adopted  
4 by the Legislature, which was that of inviting the  
4 other States 4 to concur in declaring the acts to be  
4 unconstitutional, and to co-operate, by the neces­  
4 sary and proper measures, in maintaining unim­  
4 paired the authorities, rights, and liberties reserved  
4 to the States respectively and to the People.&#x27;  
* That, by the necessary and proper measures, to  
4 be concurrently and co-operatively taken, were  
meant measures known to the Constitution,  
4 particularly the ordinary control of the People and  
4 Legislatures of the States over the Government  
4 of the United States, cannot be doubted.&quot;  
44 It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the  
4 intentions of the Legislature, that the words 4 not  
4 law, but utterly null, veid, and of no force or effect,&#x27;  
which had followed, in one of the resolutions, the  
word 4 unconstitutional,&#x27; were struck out by com?  
4 mon consent. Though the words were, in fact, but  
&quot;* synonymous with 4 unconstitutional,&#x27; yet, to guard  
* against a misunderstanding of this phrase as  
* more than declaratory of opinion, the word 4 un­  
* constitutional&#x27; alone was retained, as not liable to  
* that danger.  
44 The published Address of the Legislature to the  
4 people, their constituents, affords another conclu­  
4 sive evidence of its views. The address warns  
4 them against the encroaching spirit of the General  
4 Government; argues the unconstitutionality of the  
4 alien and sedition acts; points to other instances  
4 in which the constitutional limits had been over­  
4 leaped; dwells upon the dangerous mode of deri­  
4 vingpower by implication; and, in general, presses  
4 the necessity of watching over the consolidating  
4 tendency of the Federal policy. But nothing is  
4 said that can be understood to look to means of  
4 maintaining the rights of the States beyond the  
% regular ones, within the forms of the Consti­  
* tution.  
44 If any further lights on the subject could be  
4 needed, a very strong one is reflected in the an­  
4 swera to the resolutions by the States which pro­  
&#x27; tested against them. The main objection of these,  
4 beyond a few general complaints of the inflamma­  
4 tory tendency of the resolutions, was directed  
  
* against the assumed authority of a State Legislature  
&#x27; to declare a law of the United States unconstitu*  
* tional, which they pronounced an unwarrantable  
&#x27;interference with the exclusive jurisdiction of the  
4 Supreme Court of the United States. Had the

argument:  
“ Between these different constitutional Governments,  
the one operating in all the States, the others operating  
separately in each, with the aggregate powers of Go­  
vernment, divided between them, it could not escape  
attention that controversies would arise concerning the  
boundaries of jurisdiction, and that some provision  
ought to be made for such occurrences. A political  
system that does not provide for a peaceable and au­  
thoritative termination of occurring controversies,  
would not be more than the shadow of a Government,  
the object and end of a real Government being the  
subst tution of law and order for uncertainty, confusion,  
and violence.”  
  
“The Constitution has expressly declared—1, that  
the Constitution, and the laws made in pursuance  
thereof, and all treaties made uuder the authority ol  
the United States,shall be the supreme law of the land ;  
2, that the Judges ol every State shall be bound thereby,  
any thing in the constitution and laws of any State to  
the contrary notwithstanding; 3, that the Judicial  
power of the United States shall extend to all cases in  
law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws  
of the United States, and treaties made under their au­  
thority,’ &amp;c.”

according to a process applicable by the States.  
“And in the event of the failure of every constitu­

abuses, rendering passive obedience and non-resistance  
a greater evil than resistance and revolution, there can  
remain but one resort, the last of all—an appeal from

“That the Legislature [of Virginia] could not have  
intended to sanction such a doctrine, is to be inferred  
from the debates in the House ol Delegates, and from  
the address of the two houses to their constituentson the  
subject of tho resolutions. The tenor of the debates,  
which were ably conducted, and are understood to have  
been revised for the press by most, if not all of the  
speakers, discloses no reference whatever to a consti­  
tutional right of an individual State to arrest by force  
the operation of a law of the United States.&quot; Concert  
among the States tor redress against the alien and sedi­  
tion laws,as acts of usurped power, wasa leadingsenti­  
ment; and the attainment of a concert the immediate  
object of the course adopted by the Legislature, which  
was that of inviting the other Stales ‘to concur in de­  
claring the acts to be unconstitutional, and to co-operate,  
by the necessary and proper measures, in maintaining  
unimpaired the authorities, rights, and liberties reserved  
to the Slates respectively and to the People.’ That, liy  
I the necessary and proper measures, to be concurrently  
and co-operatively taken, were meant measures known  
to the Constitution, particularly the ordinary control  
of the People and Legislatures of the States over the  
Government of the United States, cannot be doubted.”  
“It is worthy of remark, and explanatory ol the in­  
tentions of the Legislature, thatthe words&#x27;not law, but  
utterly null, void, and of no force or effect,’ which had  
followed, in one of the resolutions,tho word ‘unconsti­  
tutional,’ were struck out by common consent. Though  
the words were, in tact, but synonymous with ‘uncon­  
stitutional,’ yet, to guard against a misunderstanding  
of this phrase as more than declalory of opinion, the  
word ‘nnconsti1 u ional’ alone was retained, as not liable  
to that danger.  
‘ Thepublished address of the Legislature to the peo­  
ple, their constituents, affords another conclusive evi­  
dence of its views The address warns them against  
the encroaching spirit of the General Government; ar­  
gues the unconstitutionally of the alien and sedition  
acts; points toother instances in which the constitution­  
al limits had been overleaped; dwells upon the dange­  
rous mode of deriving power by implication; and, in  
general, presses the necessity of watching over the con­  
solidating tendency of the Federal policy. Hut nothing  
is said that canoe understood to look to means of  
maintaining the rights of the States beyond the regu­  
lar ones, WITHIN THE FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION.  
“ If any further lights ou the subject could be needed,  
a very strong one is reflected in the answers to the re­  
solutions by the States which protested against them.—  
The main objection of these, beyond a few general  
complaints of the inflammatory tendency of the reso­  
lutions, was directed against the assumed authority of  
a State Legislature to declare a law of the United  
States unconstitutional, which they pronounced an un­  
warrantable interference with the exclusive jurisdiction  
of the Supreme Court of the. United States. Nad the  
resolutions been regarded as avowing and maintaining  
a right, in an individual State, to arrest by force the  
execution of a law of the United States, it must be  
presumed that it would have been a conspicuous  
OBJECT OF TI1E1R DENUNCIATION.

unconstitutional, and, therefore, “null and void.”  
The result, as is well shown in the remarks of the  
high legal authority quoted by the Intelligencer,  
would doubtless be the same.  
Our opinion that Mr. Madison’s authority, in  
the letter of 1830, might more properly have been  
adduced in favor of the proposed consultation  
amongst the Southern States at Nashville, than  
against it. was founded upon the following passage  
of that letter:  
&quot;The tenor of the debates [in the Virginia Legisla­  
ture. of 1798-9] which were ably conducted, and are  
understood to have been revised tor the press by most, if  
not ail, of the speakers, discloses no reference whatever  
to a constitutional right of an individual State to arrest  
by force a law of the United States. Concert among  
the States for redress against the alien and sedition  
laws, as acts of usurped power, was a leading senti­  
ment ; and the attainment of such a concert the im­  
mediate object of the course adopted by the Legisla­  
ture, which was that of inviting the other States to con­  
cur in declaring the acts to be unconstitutional, and to  
co-operate, by the necessary and proper measures, in  
maintaining unimpaired tile authorities, rights and liber­  
ties reserved to the States respectively and to the  
People.”  
Mr. Madison, indeed, in the next sentence, goes  
on to say, “That, by the necessary and proper  
measures, to be concurrently and co-operatively  
taken, were meant measures known to llie consti­  
tution, particularly the ordinary control of the Peo­  
ple and Legislatures of the States over the Gov­  
ernment of the United States, cannot be doubted.”

letter, where, after showing that thc judicial, power  
extends “to all cases in law and equity arising un­

e erected upon it. As a  
sufficient vindication of his commcn sense as  
well as of his unwavering devotion to the  
Union as it is, we turn to a Letter address­  
ed by him to the Editor of the North Ame­  
rican Review, dated at Montpelier, August,  
1S30, in reply to a Letter written to him,  
referring to the proceedings of the Virginia  
Legislature of l70S-&#x27;99, us appealed to in  
behalf of the Nullifying doctrine which had  
then just blomed into existence. Without  
a word of comment (because it would be  
both presumptuous and supejfluous) we ex­  
tract from the Letter cmbiaced in the En­  
quirer&#x27;s argument :  
Between these different Constitutional  
Governments, tho one operating in all the  
States, the others operating separately in  
each, with the aggregate powers of Govern­  
ment divided between them, it could not  
escape attention that controversies would  
arise concerning the boundaries of jurisdic­  
tion, and that some provision ought to be  
made for such occurrences. A volitical  
tern that does not -providefor a jycaccahle and  
authoritative termination of occurring con-  
real Government being the substitution of  
law and order for uncertainty, confusion, and  
violence.&quot;  
&#x27;The Constitution has expressly declared  
1, That the Constitution, and the laws  
made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties  
made under the authority of the U. States,  
shall be the supreme law of the land ; 2,  
that the Judges of every State shall be bound  
thereby, any thing in the Constitution and  
laws of any State to the rontrary notwith­  
standing; 3, that the Judicial power of the  
United btates shall extend to all eases in law  
and equity arising under the Con3titulion,  
the laws of the United Stales, and treaties  
made undfcr their authority.&#x27; &amp;c.&quot;  
Should the provisions of the Constitution  
be found not to secure tiie government and  
rights of the States against usurpations and  
abuses on the part of the United States, the  
final resort within the pcrvicic of the Con  
stitution lies in an Amendment of the Con­  
stitution, according to a piocess applicable  
by the States.  
And in the event of tho failure of every  
constitutional resort, and an accumulation of  
usurpations and abuses, rendeiing passive  
obedience and non-resistance a greater evil  
than resistance and revolution, there can  
remain but one resort, the last nf all an  
appeal from the cancelled obligations of the  
compact to original rights and the law of  
self-preservation. This is the ultima ratio  
under all Governments, whether consolidated,  
confederated, or a compound of both ; and it  
cannot be doubted that a single member of  
the Union, not a Confederacy of States.  
Editors. in the extremity supposed, but in  
that only, would have a right, as an extra  
and ultra-constitutional right, to make the  
appeal.&quot;  
&#x27;&#x27;The Constitution is a compact ; its text is  
to be expounded according to the provisions  
for expounding it making a part ef the  
compact ; and none of the parties can right­  
fully renounce the expounding provision  
more than any other part.

&#x27;That the Legislature of Virginia could  
not have intended to sanction such a doctrine,  
is to be inferred from the debates in the  
House of Delegates, and from the address of  
the two houses to their constituents on the  
subject of the resolutions. The tenor of  
the debates, which were ably conducted, and  
are understood to have been revised for the  
press by most, if not all of the speakers, dis­  
close? no lefeienco whatever, to a constitu  
  
tional light of an individual State to arrest  
by force the operation of a law of the United  
States.&quot; Concert among the States for re­  
dress against the alien and sedition laws, as  
acts of usurped power, was a leading senti­  
ment; and the attainment of a concert the  
immediate object of the course adopted by. the  
Legislature, which was that of inviting the  
oiher States 4to concur in declaring the acts  
to be unsonstituu&#x27;oiial, and to co-operate, by  
the necessary and proper measures, in main­  
taining unimpaired the authorities, rights,  
and liberties reserved to the States respect­  
ively and to the people.&#x27; That, by the ne­  
cessary arid proper measures, to be concur  
  
rently and co-operatively taken, were meant  
measures known to the Constitution, partic­  
ularly the ordinary control of the people and  
Legislatures of the States over the Govern­  
ment of the U. States, can not be doubted.&quot;  
&quot;It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of  
the intentions of the Legislature, that the  
words, &#x27;noi Uw, but utterly null, void, and of  
no force or effect which had followed, in one  
of the resolutions, the word &#x27;unconstitutional,&#x27;  
wcie struck out by common consent. Vlio&#x27;  
the words were, in fact, but synonymous with  
unconstitutional,&#x27; yet, to guard against a  
misunderstanding of this phrase as more  
than declaratory of opinion, theNword &#x27;un­  
constitutional&#x27; alone was retained, as not  
liable to that danger,  
&quot;The published Address of the Legisla  
ture to the people, their constituents, affords  
another conclusive evidence of its views.  
The address warns them against the encroach­  
ing spiiit of the General Government; argues  
the unconstitutionality of the alien and sedi­  
tion acts? points to other instances in which  
tho constitutional limits had bpen overleaped;  
dwells upon tho dangerous mode of deriving  
power by implication ; and, in general, pres  
ses the necessity of watching over tho con­  
solidating tendency of the Federal policy.  
But nothing is said that can be understood to  
look to means of maintaining the lights of  
the States beyond the regular ones, within  
the forms of the Constitution.  
If any further lights on the subjects could  
bo needed, a very strong one is reflected in  
the answers to the resolutions by the States  
which protested against them. Tho main  
objection of these, beyond a few general com­  
plaints of the inflammatory tendency of the  
resolutions, was directed against the assumed  
authority of a State Legislature to declare a  
law of the United States unconstitutional.  
which they pronounc d an un wairantable  
inteiference with the exclusive jurisdiction of  
the Supreme Ccurt of the United States.  
Had the resolutions beGn regarded as avow­  
ing and maintaining a light, in an individual  
State, to arrest, by force, the execution of a  
law of tho U. States, it must he presumed  
that it would have been a conspicuous object  
of their denunciation.

rest of the States, but to the despotism of a  
fraction, more intolerable and arrogant than  
any oligarchy that ever existed. Well may  
Mr. Madison exclaim, as in the letter above  
referred to, “ that nothing can better demon-  
strate the inadmissibility of such a doctrine,  
than that it puts it in the power of the smadl-  
est fraction to give the law and even the  
Constitution to the remaining States ;” each  
claiming, as he says, “ an equal right to ex-  
pound it, and to insist on the exposition.”  
Such a bedlam of discord would never be-  
fore have existed to curse a nation, if such  
had been the end of the present Constitu-  
tion, and the design of those who framed it.  
Greatly would I have preferred a re-estab-  
lishment of the old Articles of Confedera-  
tion, to such a Constitution as these secession-  
ists would have ours to be.

A.  
consequently by th,&#x27;

Being thns&quot; derived from the same source . ,i,  
constitutions of the States.it has, within each sJt  
the same authority as the constitution or the Si .  
and is as much a constitution, io the strict gen &#x27;  
the term, within its prescribed sphere, tne f  
tutioas of the States are. within their respecl  
spheres ; bat with this obvious and essential (jiff  
diffei

people&#x27; thereof one

States individually, as the seastitatiea ef a IV  
my beat its individual will.  
3. And that it divides the anpreaae powtn tr  
vernment, between the governuieut uf the TJn &#x27;I  
States, and the governments of the individual St  
is stamped ou the face of the instrument ; le,  
ers of war and of taxation, of Commerce .&#x27;nd 0ff0&quot;  
ties, and other enumerated powers vested io th&#x27;&quot;  
vernment of the United States, being of as high  
sovereign a character, as any of the powers reserved  
to the State governments.  
Nor is the government ef the United States ere­  
uted by the Constitution, less a government jD ti  
strict sense of the term, within the sphere of ill  
powers, than the governments created by the eo  
stitatiuns of the Ststes an-, within their g,erjj  
spheres. It is like them orgauised into legislative  
executive and judiciary department!. It opera, i  
like tnem. directly on persons aud things. And like  
them, it has at command a physical foree for&#x27;eie.  
cuting the powers committea to it. The concurrent  
operatiou in certain cases, is one of the featurta  
marking the peculiarity of the system. t &#x27;  
To have trusted to negotiation for adjusting  
putes between the government of the Uuited Mates,  
and the Stale governments, as between independent,  
and separate sovereignties, would have lost si.-ht tC  
together of a constitution and government for thr  
Union, and opened a direct road from a f.ilur, of  
that resort, to the ultima ratio between nations whoU  
ly independent of and alien to each other. It ib­  
idea had its origin in the process of adjustment, be­  
tween separate br ioches of the same gorerixnent  
the analogy entirely fails. In the case oidiapoie,  
bet wees independent parts of the tame government  
neither party being able to consummate its win,  
the government to pracead without a conemrenee.  
of the p trU, necessity brings about aa ueccia modi­  
lion, la disputes between a state governoaat, ani  
the government of the United Statei, th&amp;iH is,  
practically. as well as theoretically different-nek  
party possessing all the departments of an itaBiirL  
government, legislative, executive and jjidioiary­  
and haviug each a physical force le aopps&#x27;ta ir,. are.&quot;  
tensions. Ahbouijh the issue of Begatiatiaa might  
sometimes avoid this extremity, how oUn would it  
happen among so ma ay states, that an auaceiiwno.  
datiug spirit in some would render that resource un­  
availiag. A contrary supposition wouiAaot aetori  
with a knowledge of human nature, or lha eMutnas­  
of bar own political history.  
The constitution, not relying on aej- ef me pre­  
ceding modification, fer it safe bd4 sacoersfsl ope­  
ration, has expressly declared, ou the as hand,.!,  
&quot;That the constitution, and the law suds ia  
irarsnanse thereof, and all treutie made sader  
ihe authority at ihe United State, saatl be-tke-ao-prama  
law ef the land ; 9, that the jpeges eioery  
state shall be bound thereby, any t:uo ia.thoe­  
siitatioa and laws of auy state to tae-eontaaay set­  
withstanding ; S, that the judicial powe ef ibe

equity arising under the constitutwa, the laws ef  
the United States, and treaties mad-aodes Uuir aa­  
ihorily,&quot;&#x27; i-e.  
&quot; On the other hand, as a security ef She sight aa4  
powers of the state, in iuiiidua&#x27;,ojcke,agaiiit  
an undue preponderance of the peweia- granted l  
the government over them io their Baited riptieitj,  
ihe &quot;constitution has relied on, l,e responsibility  
of ihe senators and repreaentaliveaiath legislature  
of the United Stales to the legUhtautes&#x27; and pep)e  
of the slates ; 3, the responsibility ef the President  
to the people ef the United Slates ; and k, ihe liabil­  
ity of the executive and judicial foneiionarie f th  
United Stales to impeachment by vhs-pepresentniive  
of the people of Ihe States, in one fceaach eftbe leg­  
islature or the United States, and tvial by the teure­  
seniatives ef the states, in ihe ether braach : the  
stale functionaries, legislative, exeewtvve aad judicial  
being, at the same lime, in their appeiotmeul sad t­  
sponsibility, altogether independ&quot; ef the agency  
or authority of the Uaited Stales  
Should the provisions of the constitution as here  
reviewed, be louod not to secure the government  
and rights of the states against ibe tisurpatioa? aua  
abuses on the part of the United) Slates, the inal  
resort within the purview of the constitution lies  
in an amendment of the constitution, according  
to a process applicable by the states.  
And in the event of the failure ef every consti­  
tutional resort, and an accumukuspeiof usurpations  
and abuses, rendering passive obedience and aoa­  
resistance a greater evil than icsieunce and revo­  
lution, there cau reaaain but oee resort, the last of  
all an appeal from the cancelled obligation of  
ike compact, to original ngbis and the law of self­  
preservation. This is the ultima- nlio under all  
governments, whether consolidated, confederated  
or a corapOund of both; and it caonot be doubted  
that a single member of tbt union, in the extrem  
ity supposed, but in thai only, would hare a right,  
as an extra and ulira-consiiiutioaal right, to make

Resolved, That the said Constitutian was formed,

people of tbe United States, as a single community in

It waa formed by tbe States that is by the people

Being thus derived from the some source as the  
Constitutions of the States, it has, within each State,

ry earthly blessing, and recorded honors have gathered  
round and thickened over him.  
Let us now examine this letter of Mr. Madison, and  
see if it can bear the construction the gentleman from  
Guilford has put upon it. The letter commences by  
stating the true character of our government. &quot;In  
order, says Mr. Madison, to understand the true char­  
acter of the Constitution of the United States, the  
error not uncommon, must be avoided, of viewing it  
through the medium either of a consolidated govern  
  
ment, or of a confederated government, whilst it is  
  
Government than unorganized insurrection or rebellion  
  
which are never resorted toby the people until their  
personal sufferings become intoleratde. and we will then  
have established a government which in a few years will  
never have been equalled by any other since the days  
of Imperial Rome, tor its indifference to the wants and  
  
sufferings of the remote provinces.

were stricken out by common consent.  
  
I hough the words were, in feci, but  
synonymous with &quot;unconstitutional,&quot;  
yet to guard against a misunderstand­  
ing of this phrase, as more than  
declaratory of opinion, the word  
&#x27;unconstitutional&#x27; alone was retained as  
not liable to that danger.  
&quot;The published address of the legis­  
lature to Ihe people, their constituents,  
affjrds another conclusive evidence of  
ils views. The address warns them  
against the encroaching spirit of ths  
general government; argues ihe con­  
stitutionality of the alien and ledition  
acts; points lo other instances in w hich  
the constitutional limits had been over­  
leaped, dwells upon the dangerous mode  
of deriving power by implication; and  
in general professes the necessity of  
watching over the consolidating ten­  
dency of the federal policy. But noth­  
ing is said that can be understood to  
  
look to means of maintaining the  
rights of ihe states beyond the regular  
ones, within theforms of the constitution.  
&quot;Had ihe resolutions been regarded  
as avowing and maintaining aright in

the debates in the House of Delegates,  
and from the address of the two houses

&quot;In order to understand the true charne­  
ter of the Constitution of the United States,  
the error, not uncommon, must be avoided,  
of viewing it through the medium either of  
a consolidated Government or, of a confedera­  
ted government, whilst it is heither the one  
nor the other; but a mixture of both. And  
having, in no model, the similitudes and anal.  
ges applicable to other systems of govern­  
ment it must more than any other, be its  
own interpreter according to its text and the  
facts of the case.  
&quot;From these it will be seen that the char­  
acteristic peculiarities of the constitution are,  
I, the mode of its formation; 2, the citison  
of the supreme powers of government between  
the States in their united capacity, and the  
States in their individual capacities.  
&quot;I. It was formed, not by the Governments  
of the component States, as the lederal gove  
ernment for which it was substituted was  
formed. Nor was it formed by a majority  
of the people of the United States, as a single  
community in the manuer of a consolidated  
government.  
  
It was formed by the States, acting in their  
highest sovereign capacity; and formed con­  
equently by the same authority which form­  
ed the State constitutions,  
&quot;Being thus derived from the same source  
the Constitutions of the States, it has with.  
in each State the same authority as the con­  
stitution of the State; and is as much a cone  
titution, in the strict sense of the term, with.  
in its prescribed sphere, as the consti ution  
of the S ates are, within their respective  
pheres; but with this obvious and essential  
d fference, that being a compact among the  
States in their highest sovereign capacity,  
and constituting the people thereof one peoe  
ple for certain purposes, it cannot be altered  
or annulled at the will of the States individu  
ally, as the constitution of a State may be at  
its individual will.

AndreW Jackson in his proclamation of  
the 11th of December, 1832, said:  
&quot;This right to secede is deduced from the  
nature of the constitution, which they say is  
a compact between sovereign states who have  
preserved their whole sovereignty and there­  
fore are subject to no superior; that because  
  
they made the compact, they can break it,

4&#x27; That the Legislature [of Virginia] could not  
4 have intended to sanction such a doctrine, fas  
4 that of Nullification,] is to be inferred from the  
4 debates in the House of Delegates, and from the  
4 address of the two bouses to their constituents  
* on the subject of the resolutions. The tenor of  
4 the debates, which were ably conducted, and are

* Hon of a law of the United States.&quot; Concert  
4 among the States for redress against the alien and  
4 sedition laws, as $cts of usurped power, was a  
4 leading sentiment; and the attainment of a con­  
4 cert the immediate object of the course adopted  
4 by the Legislature, which was that of inviting the  
4 other States ? to concur in declaring the acts to be  
4 unconstitutional, and to co-operate, by the neces­  
4 sary and proper measures, in maintaining unim­  
4 paired the authorities, rights, and liberties reserved  
? to the States respectively and to the people.&#x27;  
  
* That, by ihe necessary and proper measures, to  
* be concurrently and co-operatively taken, were  
4 meant measures known to th* Constitution,  
* particularly the ordinary control of the People and  
* Legislatures of the States over the Government of  
4 the United States, cannot be doubted.&quot;  
&#x27; ** It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the.  
* intentions of the Legislature, that the words 4 not  
4 la w, but utterly null, void, and of no force or effect,  
* which had followed, in one of the resolutions, the  
* word 4 unconstitutional,&#x27; were struck out by com­  
1 mon content. Though the words were, in fact, but  
4 synonymous with4 unconstitutional,&#x27; yet, to guard  
4 against a misunderstanding of this phrase as  
4 more than declaratory of opinion, the wofd * un­

4 that danger. ... . ..

4 people, their constituents, affords another conclu­  
* sive evidence of its views. The address warns

“That the Legislature [of Virginia] could not have  
intended to sanction such a doctrine, [as that of Nulli­  
fication,] is to he inlerred from the debates in the House  
of Delegates, and from the address of the two houses to  
their ccnstituants on the subject of the resolutions._  
Thetenorot thedebates, which were ably conducted,  
and are understood to have been revised for the press by  
most, ii not all the speakers, discloses no reference  
whatever to a constitutional right of an individual  
State to arrest hv force the operation ol a law of the  
United States.” Concert among the States lor redress  
against the alien and sedition laws, as acts of usurped  
power, was a leading sentiment; and the attainment of  
a concert the immediate object of the course adopted  
by the Legislature, which was that of inviting the other  
States ‘ to contur in declaring the acts to be unconsti­  
tutional, and to co-operate, by the necessary and pro­  
per measures, in maintaining unimpaired the authori­  
ties, rights and liberties reserved to the States respec­  
tively and to the people.’ That, by the necessary and  
proper measures, to be concurrently and co operatively  
taken, wete meant measures known to the Constitution,  
particularly the ordinary control of the People and Le­  
gislatures of the States over the Government of the  
United States, cannot be doubted.  
“It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the in­  
tentions of the Legislature, that the words “not law,  
but utterly null, void, and of no force or effect,”  
which had followed, in one of the resolutions, tho  
word ‘unconstitutional,’ were struck out by common  
consent. Though tho words were, in tact, but synon­  
ymous with ‘unconstitutional,’ yet, to guard against  
a misunderstanding of this phrase as more thau decla­  
ratory of opinion, the word ‘unconstitutional’ alone  
was retained, as not liable to that danger.  
The published Address oftltc Legislature to the peo­  
ple, their constituents, affords another conclusive evi­  
dence ot its views. The address warns them against  
khe encroaching ipirit of the General Government; ar­  
gues the unconstitutionality of the alien and sedition  
acts; points to other iustancesin which the constitution­  
al limits had been overleaped; dwells upon the dangor­  
ous mode of doming power by implication; and, in  
genet al, presses, the necessity of watching over the  
consolidating tendency of the Federal policy. But no­  
thing is Eaid that can be understood to look to means  
el maintaining the rights of the Stales beyond the regu­  
lar ones, within the forms ofibe Cuustitution.  
“If any further lights on the subject could he. needed;  
a very sno.-ig one is reflected in the answers to the re­  
solutions by the States which protested against them.  
  
1 no mam objeedon ot these, beyond a tew general j  
, complaints of the inflammatory tendency of the resolu- I  
dons, was directed against the assumed authority of a

u 1. It wsa formed, not by the Governments of  
the component Sfctes, as the Federal Government  
for which it tu substituted wa formed nor was  
it formed by a majority of the People of the Uni  
ted Stales as a single community in the manner  
of a consolidated Government. It was formed by  
the States, that is, by the People in each of the  
States, acting in their highest sovereign capacity ;  
and formed consequently by the same authority  
which formed the State Constitutions.  
Being thus derived from the same source as  
the onstitutions of the States, it has within each  
State, the same authority as the Constitution of  
tbe State ; and is as much a Constitution, in the  
strict sense of the term, within its prescibed  
sphere, as the Constitutions of tho States are,  
within iheir respective spheres ; but with this ob  
vioas and essential difference, that being a com­  
pact among the States in their highest sovereign  
capacity, and constituting the people there f one i  
  
people for certun purposes, it cannot oe altered  
or annulled al the icill of the Slates individually,  
as the Constitution of a State may be at individ­  
ual will,&quot; &amp;C-, &amp;C  
I endorse these sentiments, sir, to their full  
extent. They will enable us not only to  
escape Consolidation, which seems to pre­  
sent so many terrors &#x27;o that Senator, but that  
other extreme, Secession, in which, I think,  
there is equal, if not greater danger to the  
peace and liberties of the country

the words were, in fact, but synony mous with  
&quot;unconstitutional,&#x27; yet, to guard aguinst a mis­

far as 1 hive been able to understand, contended  
for any such position. I submit therefore, to the

consideration of the Senator, whether it is not at  
lesst, so unnecessary consumption dfliriie, to Bs  
debating points, in relation to which, there it no  
difference or Opinion. In Ihe remarks which !  
had the honor to tuhmit, tome day since, t took

component States, as the Federal Government for  
which it was substituted was formed ndr was it

States, that is, by Ihe peeple in each Of the (States,  
acting in their highest sovereign capacity ; and form  
ed consequently by the same authority which form&quot;

I I recognize in him a different character I vener­  
ate his name, and see him as one standing between

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
M o.NTi&#x27;i&#x27;Li eh, August, 1S33. I  
Dear Sir.- I have duly received your letter in i  
which you refer to the nullifying doctrine,&quot;  
advocated as a constitutional right, by some of  
our distinguished fellow-citizens ; and to the  
proceedings of the Virginia Legislature in &#x27;U8  
and UJ&#x27;J as appealed to in behalf of that doc­  
trine ; and you express a wish for my ideas on  
those subjects.  
I am aware of the delicacy ot the task in  
some respects, and the difficulty in every respect,  
of doing full justice to it. Hut having in morR  
than one instance, complied with a like request  
from other friendly quarters, I do not decline a  
sketch of the views whicli I have been led to  
take of the doctrines in question, as well as  
some others connected wilh them; and of the  
grounds from which it appears that the proceed­  
ings of Virginia have been misconceived by  
those who have appealed to them. In order to  
understand the true character of the constitu­  
tion, tie error, not uncommon, must be avoided,  
ol viewing it through the medium, either of a  
consolidated government, or of a confederated  
government, whilst it is neither one nor the  
other, but a mixture of both. And having, in no  
model, the similitudes and anilogies appl cable  
to other systems of government, it must, more  
than any other, he itsown interpreter, according  
to its text and the facts of the case.  
From these it will be seen that the character­  
istic peculiarities of the Constitution are: 1st,  
the mode of its formation ; -Jtl, the division of  
the supreme powers of government between the  
States in their uniied capacity, and the States in  
their individual capacities.  
1st. It was firmed, not by the governments  
of the component Stales, as the Federal Govern­  
ment for which it was substituted was formed.  
Nor was it formed by a majority of the people  
of the United States, as a single community, in  
the manner of a consolidated government. It  
was formed by the States ; that is, by the people  
in each of the States tiding in their highest  
sovereign capacity ; and formed consequently  
by the same authority which formed the State  
Constitutions.  
Peing thus derived from the same source as  
the Constitutions of the States, it has within  
each State, the same authority as the Constitu­  
tion of the Stale; and is as much a Constitu­  
tion, in the strict sense of the term, within its  
prescribed sjihere, as the Constitutions of the  
States are, within their respective States; but  
with this obvious and essential difference, that  
being a compact among the States in the ir high­  
est sovereign capacity, and constituting the peo­  
ple thereof one people for certain purposes, it  
cannot be altered or annulled at the will of the  
States individually, as the Constitution of a  
State may at its individual will.  
2d. And that it divides the supreme powers  
of government between the government of the  
United Stales and the government of the indi­  
vidual States, is stamped on the face of the in­  
strument; the powers of war and of taxation,  
of commerce and of treaties, and other enumer­  
ated powers vested in the government of the  
United Slates, being of as high a sovereign  
character as any of the powers reserved to the  
State government.  
Nor is the government of the United States,  
created by the Constitution, less a government  
in the strict sense of the term, within the sphere  
of its powers, than the powers created by the  
constitutions of the States are, within their  
several spheres. It is like them, organized in­  
to legislative, executive and judiciary depart­  
ments. It operates like them directly on per­  
sons and things. And like thern it has a com­  
mand, a physical force for executing the powers  
committed to it. The concurrent operation in  
certain cases is one of the features marking the  
peculiarity of the system.  
Should the provisions of the Constitution as  
here reviewed, he found not to secure the govern­  
ment and rights of the State against usurpation  
and abuses of the United States, the final resort  
within the perview of the Constitution, lies  
in an amendment of the Constitution, accord­  
ing to a process applicable by the States.  
In the event of a failure of every conntilution­  
al resort, and an accumulation of usurpations and  
abuses, rendering paxsive obedience andmm-resis-tance  
a greater evil than resistance and revolution,  
there can remain but one resort the last of all : ap­  
peal from the cancelled obligations of the con­  
stitutional compact, to the original rights, and  
the law of self-preservation. This is the ulti­  
ma ratio under all governments, whether consoli­  
dated, confederated or a compound of both ;  
and it cannot be doubted that a single member  
of the Union, in the extremity supposed, but in  
that only, could have a right, as an extra and  
ultra constitutional right, to maka the appeal.  
In favor of the nullifying claim of the Stales  
individually, it appears, as you observe, that  
the proceedings ot the legislature ol v irginta in  
&quot;98 and &#x27;99, against the alien and sedition acts,  
t are much dwelt upon. It may often happen, as  
  
  
  
experience proves, that erroneous constructions,  
not anticipated, may not be sufficiently guarded  
ag-ainst, in the language used ; and it is due to  
the distinguished individuals, who have miscon­  
ceived the intention of those pro -eedings to sup­  
pose that the meaning of the legislature, though  
w ell comprehended at the time, may not uow  
be obvious to those unacquainted wilh the co  
temporary indications and impressions.  
But it is believed that by keeping in Tiew the  
distinctions between the governments of th  
States, and the Stated in the sense in which  
they are parties to the Constitution ; betwren  
the rights of the parlies in their concorreni, and  
in their individual capacities ; between the sever­  
al modes and objects of interposition airainst  
  
the abuses of power, and especially between in  
terpositions wiinin me purview or tne oonauiu­  
tion, and interpositions appealing from the Con­  
stitution to the rights of nature paramount to all  
constitutions; with an intention, always of ex­  
planatory use, to the views and arguments which  
were coinbatted, the rcsortttions of Virginia, as  
vindicated in the report on them, will be found  
entitled to an exposition, showing a consistency  
in their parts, and an inconsistency of the whole  
with the doctrine under Consideration.  
That the legislatare conld not have intended  
to sanction such a doctrine?, is to be inferred  
from the debates in the house of delegates, and  
from the address of the two honses to their con­  
stituents, on the subject of the resolutions.  
The tenor of the debates, which were ably con­  
ducted, and are understood to have been revised  
for the pre 93 by r?ros! ft not all of the speakers,  
discloses no reference whatever to a constitution­  
al right in an individual State to arrest by force  
the operation of a law of the United States,  
Concert among ihe States for redress against  
the alien and sedition laws, as acts of usurped  
power, was a leading sentiment, and the attain­  
ment of a concert, the immediate object of the  
course adopted by the legislature, which was  
that of inviting the other States &quot; to concur in  
declaring the acts unconstitutional, and to co­  
operate, by the necessary and proper measures,  
in maintaining unrepaired the anfhorities, rigbls  
and liberties, reserved to the States respectively,  
and lo the people.&quot; That by the necessary and  
proper measures to be conjointly andco-opera-lively  
taken, were meant measures known to  
the constitution particularly the ordinary con­  
trol of the people and legislatures of the Slates,  
over the government of the United States, can­  
not he doubled, and the interposition of tti isi  
control, as the event showed, was equal to the  
occasion.  
It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of  
the intentions of the legislature, that the words  
&quot; not law, but utterly null, void, and of no force  
or effect,&quot; w hich had followed in one of the res­  
olutions, the word unconstitutional,&quot; were struck  
out by common consent. Though Ihe words  
were in fact synonymous with uiiconsiiiiitiiiii.l,  
yet to guard against a misunderstanding of il.is  
phrase as more that declaratory of opinion, the  
word &quot; unconstitutional &quot; alone w is n l. in.d,  
as not liable to that danger.  
The published address of the legislature i i  
the people, their constituents, affords auotln-r  
conclusive evidence of its vie as. The address  
warns them against the encroaching spirit of tin­  
general government, argues the unconsliinll ia­  
ality of the alien and sedition acts, points n  
other instances iu which the consli ttilonal limits  
have been overleaped, dwells upon the danpi r­  
ous mode of deriving power by implication, ai.d  
in general presses the necessity of watchii g  
over Ihe consolidating tendency of federal p &quot;ii­  
cy. Put nothing is said that can be uuderstoo.&#x27;.  
to look to means of maintaining the rights o!  
the States beyond the regular ones, within the  
forms of the constitution.  
If any further lights on the subject could he  
needed, a very strong one is reflected in the  
answers to the resolutions, by the Slates which  
protested against them. The main objection of  
these, beyond a few general complaints of the  
inllainmatory tendency of the resolutions, was  
directed against the. assumed authority of a Stale  
legislature to declare a law of Ihe United States  
unconstitutional, which they pronounced an un­  
warrantable interference with the exclusive ju­  
risdiction of the Supreme Court of the United  
States. Had the resolutions been regarded n  
avowing and maintaining a right in an individ­  
ual State, to arrest by force the execution of a  
law of the United States, it must be presumed  
it would have been a conspicuous object of their  
denunciation.  
With cordial salutations,

king an experiment. May no disaster dash our hopes to the  
ground!  
Mr. Madison has well said that &quot;in order to understand  
the true character of the Constitution of the United States,  
the error, not uncommon, must be avoided, of viewing it  
through the medium, either of a consolidated government, or  
of a confederated government, while it is neitfier the one,  
nor the other, but a mixture of both. And having, in no  
model, the similitudes and analogies applicable to other  
systems of government, it must, more than any other, be its  
own interptetcr according to its text and the facts of the  
case.&quot;  
&#x27;?It was formed not by the governments of the component  
States, as the federal government, for which it was substitu­  
ted, was formed. Nor was it formed by u majority of the  
people of the United States, as a single community, in the  
manner of a consolidated government.&quot;  
&quot;It was formed by the States; that is, by the people in each  
of the Stales, acting in their highest sovereign capacity ;  
and formed, consequently, by the same authority which  
formed tne State Constitution &quot;  
&quot;Being ihusderivtd from the same source as the constitu­  
tions of the Stales, it has w ithin each State the same author­  
it) as the Constitution of the State; and isas much a con­  
stitution in the strict sense of the term within its prescribed  
sphere, as the constitutions of the States are, within their j  
spheres.&quot;  
Judue Iredell (3 Dallas, 92) holds the same dotcrine. He  
says: &quot;I conclude, theretore, that every particle ot authority ,  
which originally resided either in Congiess or in any branch  
?.f the State governments, was derived from the people of

?uch a doctrine, is to be Inferred from the debates In ths  
house of delegates, end from the adifreis of tbe two hou*es  
to tbeir constituents, on tbe subject of the resolutions. Tbr  
tenor of the debates, wbicb were ably conducted, and are  
understood to hmve been revised lor tbe press by most, if  
not ail, of the speakers, discloses no reference whatever to  
a constitutional right in an individual State to arrest by  
force tbe operation of a law of the United States Con­  
cert anion* the States for redress against the alien and se&lt;li  
lion laws, as acU of usurped power, was a lending senti­  
ment and the attainment of a concert, the immediate ob­  
isct of the course adopted by the legislature, which was  
that of inviting &amp;e other States &#x27; to concur in declaring the  
acts to be unconstitutional, and to co operate by the neces­  
sary and proper measures In mairuaining unimpaired the  
authorities, ri,hts, and liberties reserved to the States  
respectively and to Ihe people.&#x27; -That by tbe necessary  
SDd proper measures to be concurrently and cooperativtly  
taken, were meant measures known to tbe constitution,  
particularly the ordinary control of tbe people and legisla­  
tures of the States over the governtneat of the United  
States, cannot be doubted ; and tbe interposition of this  
control, a? the ?vent ihowid, was eqisal to the oocasion.  
&quot;It it worthy of remark* and explanatory of the intentions  
of the legislature, that the words * not law, but utterly null,  
void, and of no force or effect,&#x27; which had followed, in one  
of the resolutions, the word &#x27; unconstitutional,&#x27; were struck  
out by common oonsent. Though the words were in fact  
bat ?ynonymous with * unconstitutional,&#x27; yet, to guard  
against a misunderstanding of this phrase as more than  
declaratory of opinion, the word 1 unconstitutional&#x27; alone  
was retained, as not liable to that danger.  
&quot;The published address ol the legislature to the people,  
their constituents, affords another conclusive evidence of |  
Its views. The address warns them against ihe encroach­  
ing spirit of the general government ; argues the unconsti- j  
tutionality of tbe alien and sedition acts; points to other in­  
stances in which the constitutional limits had l?een over­  
leaped ; dwells upon the dangerous mode of deriving  
power by implication ; and in general presses the necessity  
of watching ovef the consolidating tendency of the federal  
policy But nothing is said that can be understood to look  
to means of maintaining the rights of the States, beyond  
the regular ones, within the forms of the constitution.  
?? II my farther lights on the a abject could be needed, a  
very strong on# is reflected in the answers to the resolu­  
tions, by the States which protested against them. The  
main objection of these, beyond a few general complaints  
ef the inflammatory tendency of the resolutions, was  
directed against the assumed authority of a State legisla­  
ture to declare a law of the United States unconstitutional,  
whtnh they pronounced an unwarrantable interference  
with tbe exclusive jurisdiction of tbe Supreme Court of the  
United States Had the resolutions been regarded as avow­  
ing and maintaining a right, in an individual State, to ar­  
rest by force the exstcution of a law ol the United States,  
it moat be presumed that it would have been a conspicu­  
ous ob)?et of then denunciation.**

&quot; It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the

character ot the constitution of the U. States,  
the error, not uncommon, must be avoided of

From these, it will be seen, that the character­

The mode of its formation; t&gt;J. The division of  
the supreme powers of the government between  
the States in their united capacity, and the

1. It was formed, not by the governments of

Nor was it formed by a majority ot the people

This cuts up secession by the roots—the pow­  
er is decided by Mr. Madison tor the plainest  
reason. Again he says: “Should the provisions  
ol the constitution as here reviewed, be found  
not to secure the government and rights of the  
Slates, against usuipations and abuses on the  
part of the U. Mates, the final resort within  
the purview of the constitution, lies in an  
amendment of the constitution, according to a  
process applicable by the States. And in the  
event of a lailure of every constitutional re­  
&gt;ort, and an accumulation of usurpations and  
abuses, rendering passive obedience and non­  
resistance a greater evil than resistance and  
revolution, there can remain hut one resort, the  
last ol all; an appeal from the cancelled obli­  
gations of the constitutional compact, to origi­  
nal rights and the law ot self-preservation.—  
This is the ultima ratio under all govern­

compound ol both; and it cannot be doubted  
that a single member of the Union, in the ex­  
tremity supposed, but in that only, would have  
a right, as an extra and ultra-constitutional  
right, to make the appeal.” Here is the right  
for which 1 contend—the right of revolution—  
no secession, no “altering or annulling&quot; the  
constitution by a smgie State—but when  
an accumulation of usurpations and abuse*

how and when a state may appeal to origi­

Mr. Madison, in this letter, goes on to  
show that the doctrines of &#x27;98, have been  
greatly misunderstood; that they only  
meant, and were only understood to mean;  
a resistance to an unconstitutionalact with­

prove this, refers to the debates, in which

“What the fate of the constitution ot the L nited  
States w ould be if a small proportion ot the states j  
fcould expunge parts of it particularly valued by a  
large majority, cau have but one answer.  
“The difficulty is not removed by limiting the i  
doctrine to cases of construction. How many  
cases of that sort, involving cardinal provisions ol i  
the constitution, have occurred! How many now j  
exist! How many may hereafter spring up! How &gt;  
many might be ingeniously created, if entitled to  
the privilege of a decision in the mode proposed! j  
“Is it certain that the principle of that model  
would not reach further than is contemplated ! It  
a single state can of right require three-fourths ot  
its co-States to overule its exposition of the consti­  
tution, because that proportion is authorized to  
amend it, would the plea be less plausible that, as  
the constitution was unanimously established, it  
ought to be unanimously expounded!  
“The reply to all suen suggestions seems to be  
unavoidable and irresistible—that the constitution  
is a compact; that its text is to be expounded ac­  
cording to the provisions for expounding it—mak­  
ing a part of the compact; and that in ne of the  
parties can riglrfully renounce the expounding  
provision more than any other &#x27;part. When such  
a right accrues, as may accrue, it must grow out  
of abuses of the compact, releasing the sufferers  
from thfir fealty to it  
“In favor of the nullifying claim for the States,  
individually, it appears, as you observe, that the  
proceedings of the legislature of Virginia, in *9S  
and 99, against the alien and sedition acts, are  
much dwelt upon.  
“It may often happen, as experience proves, that  
erroneousconstruetions not anticipated may not be  
sullicieutly guarded against in the language u-eti;  
and it is due to tin; distinguished individuals who  
have misconceived the intention of those proceed­  
ings to suppose that tie; meaning ot the legislature,  
though well comprehended at the time, may not  
now be obvious to those unacquainted with the  
contemporary indications and impre**ions.  
“ilut it is believed that, by keeping in view the  
distinction between the governments ol the States  
! and the State* in the sense in which they were  
parties to the constitution—between the right* of  
the parties .11 their concurrent and in their indivi­  
dual capacities—between the several modes and  
objects of interposition against the abuses ot {low­  
er and especially between interposition* \v ithm the  
purview of tin; constitution and interpositions  
appealing from the constitution to the rights of na­  
ture, paramount to all constitutions with an in­  
tention always of explanatory use to the view* and  
arguments which were combated—the; resolutions  
of Virginia, a* vindicated in the report on them,  
will be found entitled to an exposition showing a  
consistency in their parts, and an incon*istency of  
the whole with the doctrine under consideration.  
“That the legislature could not have intended to  
sanction such a doctrine is to be inferred from the  
debates in the house of delegate*, and from the  
address of the two houses to their constituents on  
the subject of the resolution*. The tenor of the  
debate*, which were ably conducted, and are un­  
derstood to have been revised for the press by  
most, if not all, ot the speakers, discloses no refer­  
ence whatever to a constitutional right in an indi­  
vidual State to arrest by force the operation of a  
law of the United States. Conceit amon-&#x27; the  
States lor redress against the alien and sedition  
laws, a* acts of usurped power, was a leading sen­  
timent; and the attainment of a concert the imme­  
diate objertofthe course adopted by the legislature,  
which was that of inviting the other States ‘to con­  
cur in declaring the acts 10 he unconstitutional,  
and to co-opcrate, by the necessary and proper  
measures, in maintaining unimpaired the author­  
ities, rights, and liberties reserved to the States  
respectively ami to the peopled* That by the ne­  
cessary and proper measures, to be ron&gt;urrenth/  
and ro-ojurntirch/ taken, were meant measures  
known to the constitution, pari icularlv the ordina­  
ry control of the people and legi*latu:e* of the  
State* over the government of the United States,  
cannot he doubted; and the interposition of this  
control, as the event showed, wasequal to the occa­  
sion.

tions, the word ‘unconstitutional,* wen* &#x27;truck  
out by common consent. Though the words were  
in fact but synonymous witn ‘unconstitutional,’  
yet, to guard against a misunderstanding of tins  
phrase a* more than declaratory of opinion, the  
word ‘unconstitutional’ alone was retained, as not  
liable to that danger.  
“The published address of the legislature to the  
people, their constituents, affords another conelu­  
&#x27;ive evidence ot its views. T lie address warns  
them against the encroaching spirit of the general  
government, argues the unconstitutionality ot the

which the constitutional limits have been over­  
leaped, dwell* upon the dangerous mode of deri­

tendency of’the federal policy,. Hut nothing is j  
said that can bo understood to look to means oi  
inaint lining the rights ot the States beyond the  
regular ones, within the forms of the constitution.  
“If any limber lights on the subject could be  
needed, a very strong one is redacted in the an­  
swers to the resolutions by the States which pro­  
tested against them. The mam objection of these,  
beyond a few general complaints of theinfiamma­  
torv tendency of the resolution?, was directed  
against the assumed authority of a State legisla­  
ture to declare a law of the United States uncon­  
stitutional, which they pronounced an unwarrant­  
able interference with the exclusive jurisdiction ot  
the Supreme Court of the United State?. Had the  
resolution&#x27;been regarded a* avowing and main­  
taining a right in an individual State to arrest by

it must be presumed that it would have been a

the legislature.&quot;  
Extracts from Mr. Madison&#x27;s Letter to Mr. Everett,  
1830.  
Should the provisions of the Constitution, as  
here reviewed, be found not to secure the government  
and tights of the Sla&#x27;es against usurpations  
and abuses on the part of the United  
States, the final rngor*, within the purview of  
the Constitution, lies in an amendment of the  
Constitution, according to a p oeess applicable by  
L.. C* a... A  
  
Liits omits*.  
And in the event of a failure of every constitutional  
resort, and an accumulation of usurpations  
and abuses, rendering passive obedience  
and non resistance a greater ev I than resistance  
and revolution, there can remain but one resort,  
the last of all?an appeal from the cancelled obligations  
of the constitutional compact to original  
rights and the law of self-preservation.?  
This is the ultima ratio under all governments,  
whether consolidated, confederated, or a compound  
of both ; and it cannot be doubted that a  
single memb&quot;r of the Union, in the extremitv  
supposed, but in that only, would have a right,  
as an extra and ultra constitutional right, to  
make the appeal. * * &#x27; * * *  
What, the fate of the Constitution of the  
United States w?uild be, if a small proportion  
of the States could expunge parts of it particularly  
valued hy. a largo mHjority, oan have but  
one answer.  
The difficulty is not removed by limiting the  
doctrine to cases of construction. How many  
cases of that sort, involving cardinal provisions  
of tho Constitution, have occurred ? IIow many  
now exist I How many may hereafter spring up ?  
How m my might be ingeniously created, if en.  
titled to the privilege of a decision in the mode  
proposed ?  
Is it certain that the principle of that mode  
would not reach further than is contemplated ?  
If a single feltate oan of right require threefourth  
of its co States to overrule its exposition  
of the Constitution, because that proportion is  
authorised to amend it, would tho plea be less  
plausible that, as the Constitution was unanimously  
established, it ought to be unanimously  
expounded ?  
The reply to all such suggestions seems to be  
unavoidable and irresistible?-tha*. the Constitution  
is a compact; that its text is to be expounded  
according to the provisions for expounding  
it?making n part of the compact; and that  
none of the parties can rightfully renounce the  
expounding provision more than any other part  
When such n right accrues, as may accrue, it  
must grow &lt;&gt;ut of abuses of the compact, releasing  
tho suflfiirors from their fpnity to it.  
In favor of the nullifying claim for the States, j  
individually, it appears, as you observe, that the  
proceedings of the legislature of Virginia* in &#x27;98  
and &#x27;99. against the alien i;r?d sedition acts, are  
much dwelt upon. .  
It may often happen, as experience proves, i  
that erroneous construed ins not anticipated

language un&lt;-&lt;]; and it i* due to the dia?ingn|$hed  
individual* who have misconceived the inlen  
lion of those proceeding*, to suppose that the  
meaning of the legislator?, though well comprehended  
at the time, imy not now he obvious  
to tho-e nracqusintcd with the contemporary  
indication* and impresaion*.  
But it is believed, that by keeping in view the  
distinction between the government* of the  
States i.nd the State* in the *en*e in which they  
were parties to the Gooa&#x27;itijtion?between the  
rights of the parties In their concurrent and in  
their individual capacities?between the aeveral  
mode* and object* of interposition against the  
abuses of power-^nnd especially between interpositiona  
within the purview of, the Constitution  
and Interpoaillnna appealing from the Constitu  
tlon to the rlghta of nature, paramount to all

were combated?the resolution* C&#x27;  
vindicated in the report on them, will be foil no  
entitled to an exposition showing a conaiatencv  
in their parts, and an incompetency of the whole  
with the doc rine nnder consideration.  
That the leg&#x27;mlatnre could not have intended  
to sanction aoch a doctrine is to be inferred from  
the debates in thn hou*e of duleg-ites. and from  
the address of the two bouses to their constituent*  
on the subj &gt;ct of the resolution*. The  
tenor of the debates, which were ably conducted  
and are understood to h*ye been revised for the  
press by most, if not all, of the speakers, discloses  
no reference whatever to a constitutional  
right in an indiviiual State to arrest hy force  
the opprstlsn of a law of the United StatesConcert  
among the Statea for redresa against the  
alien and sedition law?, as *rt.? of usurped power  
wn* n leading eontirnent; and the attainment of |  
* &quot; * .l; a .f ? .. I  
  
concert mo m meoiaie o/ijwi 01 in?- cnnr?r  
adopted by the legislature, which was that of inviting  
the other Stales to concur in declaring  
the net* to be unconstitutional, and Utcn ofierair.  
by the necessary and proper mature*, in maintaining  
unimpaired the anthnritlee, rights, and  
liberties reaerved to the Slates respectively and  
to the people.&#x27;* That by the necessary and  
proper measure*, to be cnnrnrr&#x27;Mly and ro oper  
atir&#x27;ly taken, were meant measure* known to  
the Constitution, particularly the ordinary control  
of the people and legislatures of the Sta&#x27;e*  
over the government of Ibe United State*, cannot  
be doubted; and the interposition of this  
control, as the event showed, was cqnAl to the  
cca-l? n.  
It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the  
intentions of the legislature, that the worda  
&#x27; not law, hot utterly null, void, and of no force  
or effect,&#x27; which had followed, ?n one of the res? ;  
Iiilions, the word &#x27;uncp&#x27;stitntionaP were ?trgek  
out *?r common consent.^ Though the words &#x27;  
were in fac.l hut aynonUM^| with &#x27; unconstitutional,&quot;  
yet, to guard sg^^M misunderstanding  
of this phrase as wnrTwtp declaratory of npj &#x27;  
ninn, the word * unconstitutional&#x27; alone was retained,  
as not liable to that danger.  
The published address of the legislature to  
ths people, their o^nstituents, affords another  
ronclusiye evidencWWif its views. The address  
warns tnem against the encroaching spirit of tlie  
general government; argues the unconsti&#x27;utionslity  
of the alien and sedition acta; points to  
other instances in which the constitutional limits  
had been overleaped; dwells upon the danger* i  
  
rms mode of deriving power bv implication:  
and In general presaea the necessity of watching  
over the consolidating tendency of the federal  
policy. Hut nothing is ??id tlmt can be onleratood  
to I004 to mean* of maintaining the  
right* of the State*, beyond the regular one*,  
aithin the forma of the Constitution.  
If any further liglita on the aubject could ba  
See the concluding resolution of 171*8&#x27;  
  
I need?d,s very strong one ia reflected in the an&gt;  
swers to the resolutions by the States which  
t protested against theui. The main objection of  
. these, beyond a few general complaints of the  
, inflammatory tendency of the resolutions, was  
directed against the assumed authority of a Suite  
, legislature to declare a law of the United States  
, unconstitutional, which they pronounced an unwarrantable  
interference with the exclusive jurisdiction  
of the Supreme Court of the United  
States. Hud the resolutions been regarded as  
uvowing and maintaiuinga right in an individual  
State to arrest by force the execution of a law  
of the United States, it must be presumed that  
it would have been a conspicuous object of their  
denunciation.

‘‘In favor of the nullifying claim for the States, in­  
dividually, it appears, as you observe, that the pro­  
ceedings of the legislature of Virginia, in ’9S and ’99,  
qrainst the alien and sedition acts, are inqch dwelt  
upon.  
“It may often happen, aa oxnerince proves, that or

the speakers, discloses no reference whatever to a  
constitutional right in an individual State to arrest by  
force the operation of a law of the United Slates.—  
Concert among the States for redress against the  
alien and sedition laws, as acts of usurped power, was  
a leading sentiment; and the*attainment of a concert  
the immediate object of the course adopted by the  
legislature, which was that of inviting the other  
Stales Mo concur in declaring (lie acts to be unconsti­  
tutional, ami to co-operate, by the necessary and pro­  
per measures, in maintaining unimpaired the authori­  
ties, rights, and liberties reserved to the States re­  
spectively and 10 the people.** That by the necessa­  
ry and proper measures, to be concurrently and co­  
operatively taken, were meant measures known to the  
constitution, particularly the ordinary control of the  
people and legiaj^tres of the States over the govern­  
ment of the UrMRl States, cannot he doubted; and  
the interposition of this control, as the event showed,  
was equal to the occasion.  
“It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the  
intentions of the legislature, that the words ‘not law,  
but utterly mill, void, and of no lorce or effect,’  
which had followed in one of the resolutions, the  
ward ‘unconstitutional,’ were struck out by common  
consent. Though the words were in fact but synon­  
ymous with ‘unconstitutional,’ yet, to guard against a  
misunderstanding of this phrase as move than declar­  
atory of opinion, the word ‘unconstitional’ alone was  
retained, as not liable to that danger.  
“The published address of the legislature to the

on the dangerous mode of deriving power by impli­  
cation, and in general presses the necessity of watch­  
ing over the consolidating tendency of the federal po­  
licy. Hut nothing is said that can be understood  
to look to means of maintaining the rights of the  
Sta es beyond the regular ones, within the forms of  
the constitution.  
“If any further lights on the subject could be need­

constitutional campact to original rights and the  
law of self-preservation. This is the ultima ratio  
under all Governments, whether consolidnted, con­  
federated, or a compound of both; and it cannot be  
doubted that a single member of the Union, in the  
extremity supposed, but in that only, would have a  
right, as an extra and ultra constitutional right, to  
make the appeal. This brings us to the expedient  
lately advanced, which claims for a single State a  
right to appeal against an exercise of power by the  
Government of the United States, decided by the  
State to be unconstitutional to the purties to the  
constitutional compactt the decision of the State to  
have the effect of nullifying the act of the Govern­  
ment of the United States, unless the decision of  
the State be reversed by three fourths of the par  
ties.  
&quot;To distinguished names and high authorities  
which appear to have asserted, and given a practi­  
cal scope to this doctrine, entitle it to a respect  
which it might be difficult otherwise to feel for it.  
  oo  oo e  
&quot;The favor of the nullifying claims for the States  
individually, it appears, as you observe, that the  
proceedings of the Legislature of Virginia, in &#x27;as  
and &#x27;99, against the Alien and Sedition acts, are  
much dwelt upon.  
&quot;It may often happen, as experience proves, that  
erroneous constructions not anticipated may not ue  
sufficiently guarded against, in the language used;  
and it is due to the distinguished individuals who  
have misconceived the intention of those proceed­  
ings, to suppose that the meaning of the Legisla­  
ture, though well comprehended at the time, may  
not be obvious to those unacquainted with the con­  
temporary indications and impressions  
&quot;That the Legislature could not have intended to  
sanction such a doctrine is to be inferred from the  
debates in the House of Delegates, and from the ad­  
dress of the two houses to their constituents, on the  
subject of the resolutions. The tenor of the debates,  
which were ably, conducted, and are understood to  
have been revised for the press by most, if not all of  
the speakers, discloses no reference whatever to a  
constitutional right in an individual State to arrest  
by force the operation of a law of the United States.  
Concert among the States for redress against the A­  
lien and Sedition laws, as acts of usurped power, was  
a leading sentiment; and the attainment of a con­  
cert, the immediate object of the course adopted by  
the Legislature, which was that of inviting the oth­  
er States &#x27;to concur in declaring the acts to be un-  
constitutional, and to co-perate by the necessary and  
proper measures in maintaining inviolate the author­  
ities, rights and liberties reserved to the States re­  
spectively, and the interposition of this control,as the  
event showed, was equal to the occasion.  
&quot;It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the  
intensions of the Legislature, that the words not law  
but utterly null, void, and of no force or effect,&quot; which  
had followed, in one of the resolutions, the word  
tunconstitutional,&quot; were struck out by comnion con­  
sent. Though the words were in fact but synony­  
mous with &#x27;unconstitutional;&quot; yet, to guard against  
a misunderstanding of this phrase as more than de­  
claratory of opinion, the word unconstitutional&#x27; a­  
lone was retained, as not liable to that danger. The  
published address of the Legislature to the people,  
their constituents afford another conclusive evidence  
of its views. The address warns them against the  
encroaching spirit of the General Government; ar­  
gues the unconstitutionality of the Alien and Sedi­  
tion acts; points to other instances in which the con­  
stitutional limits had been overleaped; dwells upon  
the dangerous mode of deriving power by implica­  
tion; and in general presses the necessity of watch­  
ing over the consolidating tendency of the federal  
policy. But nothing is said that can be understood  
to look to means of maintaining the rights of the  
States, beyond the regular ones, within the forms of  
the Constitution.&quot;  
Will the Republican copy this lefter?  
To place the matter still farther be­  
yond the reach of doubt, by showing the  
understanding with which the constitu­  
tion was adopted, we re-publish the let­  
ter of Mr Madison to Mr. Hamilton, writ­  
ten in 1788,after the adoption of the Con­  
stitution by the Virginia Convention, and

In frvor of the bullifying claim of the State  
indivilually, it appears, as you observe, that the  
roceedings of the legislature of Virgiia in&#x27;98  
and &#x27;00 azainst the alien and sedition acte, are  
much dwelt upon. It may often happen, as ex-  
serience proves, that erroncous constructions,  
not anticipated, may not be sufficiently guarded  
against, in the language used, and it is due to  
the distinguished individuals who have miscon.

wse that the meaning of the legislature, though  
ell comprehended at the time, may not now he  
obvious to those unequainted with the cotempo-  
rary indications and impressions.  
But it is believed that by keeping in view the  
distinctions he ween the covernments of the  
States, and the States in the sense in which they  
are parties to the Censtimtion; between the  
rights of the parties in their concurrent, and in  
their individual capacities; between the several  
modes and objects of interposition against the

in the manner of a consolidated Government.  
  
*&lt; It was formed by the States, that is, by the people in

city; and formed, consequently, by the same authority  
which formed the State constitutions.  
  
** Being thus derived from the same source as the consti-

authority as the constitution of the State, and is as much  
a constitution, in the strict sense of the term within its pre-  
scribed sphere, as the constitutions of the States are within  
their respective spheres ; but with this obvious and essen-  
tial difference, that being a compact among the States in

. Madison, that the  
remedy for all the evils we complain of is to be  
sought within the Constitution, and that the Fed-  
eral judiciary must be resorted to to protect vio-  
lated rights. The Dred Scott decision furnishes  
  
a remarkable illustration in modern history. Mr. |  
  
Madison, however, like myself, looks to the pos-  
sibility of a contingency when all the safeguards  
of the Constitution may prove inadequate to pro-  
tect the rights of the people and the States; but  
his remedy in that event is not peaceable seces-

says on this point. Here it is:  
  
‘¢ Should the provisions of the Constitution, as here re-  
viewed, be found not to secure the government and rights  
of the States against usurpations and abuses on the part of  
the United States, the final resort within the purview of the  
Constitution, lies in an amendment of the Constitution,  
according to a process applicable by the States.  
  
“« And, in the event of a failure of every constitutional  
resort, and an accumulation of usurpations and abuses,  
rendering passive obedience and non-resistance a greater  
evil than resistance and revolution, there can remain but  
one resort, the last of all—an appeal from the canceled ob-  
ligations of the constitutional compact to original rights  
and the law of self-preservation. is is the ultima ratio

&quot;That the Legislature could not have in-  
tended to sa&amp;CtlOn such a doctrine, is to be  
inferred from the debates in the House of  
Delegates, and from the address of the two  
houses to their constituents, on the subject of  
the resolutions. The tenor of the debates,  
which were ably conducted, and are under-  
stood to have been revised for the press by  
most, if not all, of the speakers, discloses no  
reference whatever to a constitutional right in an  
individual Slate to arrest by force the operation  
of a law of the United States. Concert among  
the States for redress against the alien and  
sedition laws, as acts of usurped power, was  
a leading sentiment ; and the attainment of a  
concert, the immediate object of the course  
adopted by the Legislature, which was that  
of inviting the other States to concur in de-  
claring the acts unconstitutional, and to co  
&quot;•operate by the necessary and proper measures  
in maintaining unimpaired, the authorities,  
rights and liberties reserved to the States re-  
spectively, and to the people. That by tho  
necessary and proper measures to be concur  
rently and co-operately taken, were meant  
Measures known to the Constitution, particular  
lv the ordinary control of the people and  
Legislatures of the States, over the Govern-  
ment of the United States, cannot be doubt  
ed; and the interposition of this control, as  
the event showed, was equal to the occasion  
&#x27; The published addressof the Legislature  
to the people, their constituents, affords an  
other conclusive evidence of its views. The  
address warns them against the encroaching  
spirit of the general government; argues the  
unconstitutionality of the alien and sedition  
acts; points to other instances in which the  
constitutional limits have been overleaped;  
dwells upon the dangerous mode of deriving  
power by implication, and, in general, presses  
the necessity of watching over the consoli-  
dating tendency of the federal policy. But  
nothing is said that can be understood to look to  
means of maintaining the rights of the States,  
beyond the regular ones, within the forms of thi  
Constitution.&quot;  
  
Have we not shown enough to convince  
fftiy sane man that the doctrine of the seces-  
sionists is anything but a Democratic doc-  
trine? It is the doctrine of the enemies of

It operates like them, directly on persons and

Dr. Hodge thus continues to quote Mr. Madison,  
marking the extracts as quotations:  
&quot;It was not formed, he continues, by the gov­  
ernment of the component States, m the Federal  
Government, for which it was substituted.&quot; What  
did Mr. Madison mean by tbo pronoun &quot;It?&quot; It  
be meant the Federal Constitution, then it is clear  
that this Constitution was not substituted for &quot;the  
Federal Government,&quot; but for the Articles of Coo­  
federation. No other view of Ibis quotation will  
make sense, and certainly it is no argument  
against secession. &quot;Nor was it formed by a ma­  
jority of the people of the United States, as a sin­  
gle community, in the manner of a consolodated  
government.&quot;  
Here again, Dr. flodge makes Mr. Madison use  
the words and &quot;government,&quot; to vaguely as  
to be incomprehensible, and consequently, it is no  
proof (.gainst secession.  
Dr. Hodge thus continues his quotations.  
&quot;It was formed by the States; that is by the  
people in each of the United, aoling in their highest  
sovereign capacity, and formed consequently by  
the same authority which formed the Slate Consti­

&quot;It will be seen that the characteristic pecu­  
liarities of the constitution are, 1st, Tbe mode  
of its formation 2nd, The division of the su­  
preme powers of government between the states  
in their united capacity, and the states in their  
individual capacities.  
1. &quot;It WHS formed, not by the government of  
the component states, as the federal government  
for which it was substituted was formed. Nor  
was it formed by a majority of the people of the  
United States, as a single community in tbe man­  
ner of a consolidated government.  
&quot;It was formed by the statea, tbat is, by the  
people in each of tbe statea, acting in tiieir  
hii(he?t sovereign capacity and formed conse­  
quently by the same authority which formed the  
state constitutions.  
&quot;Being thus derived from the aame source as  
the Constitutions of the Stales, it has, within  
each State, the same authority aa the Constitu­  
tion of the State, and is aa much a Conatitution,  
in .the strict sense of the term, within its pre  
scribed sphere, HS the Constitutions of the Stales  
are, within their respective spheres but with this  
obvious and essential difference, that being a  
conipivt among the States in their highest sov­  
ereign capacity, and constituting the people  
thereof one people for certain purposes, .t can­  
not be altered or annulled at the will of the  
States individually, as the Constitution of a State  
may be at its iudiwduxl will.  
2. &quot;And that it divides the supreme powers of  
government, between the government of the  
Oniied States, and the government of the indi­  
vidual States,  
  
.8  
  
stamped on the face of the in­  
  
strument the powers of war and of taxation, of  
commerce and of treaties, and other enumerated  
powers vested in the government of the United  
States, being of as high and sovereign a charac­  
ter, as any of tbe powers reserved to the State  
governments.  
&quot;Nor is the government of the United States,  
created by tbe Constitution, less a government  
in the strict sense of the term, within the sphere  
of its powers, than the governments created by  
the Constitutions of the States are, within their  
several spberea. It is like tbem organized into  
legislative, executive, and judiciary departments.  
It ooerates, like them, directly on persons and  
things. And, like them, it has at commend a  
physical force for executing the powers commit­  
ted to it The concurrent operation in certain  
cases, is one of tbe features marking the pecu  
liarity of the system.  
  
Between theea-diflerent Constitutional gov  
ernments, the one operating i&#x27;i all the States,  
tbe others operating separately in each, with he  
aggregate powers ot government divided be­  
tween them, it could not escape attention, tbat  
controversies would arise concerning tbo boun­  
daries of jurisdiction and tbat some provision  
ought to be made for such occurrences. A po­  
litical system that does not provide for a peace­  
able and authoritative termination of occurring  
controversies, would not be more than tbe shad­  
ow af a government the object and end of a  
real government being, tbe substitution of law  
and order, for uncertainty, confusion, and vio­  
lence.  
&quot;Tbat, to have left a final decision, in such  
cases, to each of the States, then thirteen, and  
already twenty four, could not fail to make the  
Conatitution and laws of the United 8tates dif­  
ferent in different States, was obvious and not  
jess obvious, that thia diversity ot independent  
decisions must altogether distract tbe govern­  
ment of the Union, and speedily put an end to  
the Union itself. An uniform authority ol the  
laws, is in itself a vital principle. Some of the  
most important laws could not be partially exe  
cuted. They must be executed in all the States,  
or they could be duly axeciited in none. An im­  
post, or aa excise, for example, if not in force in  
some States, would be defeated in others. It is  
well known tbat this was among tbe lessons of  
experience, which bad a primary influcnca in  
  
bringing  
  
about the existing Constitution. A loss  
  
of its general authority would moreover revive  
the exasperating questions between tbe States  
holding ports for foreigu oommerce, and the ad­  
joining states without them to which are now  
added ail the inland States, nroessarilv carrying  
on their foreign commerce through other States.  
&quot;To bave made tbe decisions under tbe au  
thoritv of the individual Ststes, co-ordinate, in  
ailcaaes, with decisions under the suthority of  
the United Ststes, would unavoidably produce  
collisions incompatible with the pesca of society,  
and with the regular and eflclent administration,  
which is of the essence of free governments  
Scenes could not be avoided, in which a minis  
terisl officer of the United States, and the cor­  
respondent ofReer of id Individual State, would  
have rencontres in executing conflicting decrees  
the result of which would depend on the com­  
parative foroo of the local possee attending  
tbem and that, a eaaaalitj depending ?nti»

says, (in a letter published in the North  
American Review of August 1830):  
“It (the Constitution) was formed by the  
States, that by the people in each of the  
Stales, acting in their highest sovereign ca­

same authority which /firmed the State (Jonsti­

source as the Constitutions of the States, it  
lias, within each State, the same authority as  
(lie Constitution of the State, and is ns much  
a Constitution in the strict sense of the term,  
within its prescribed sphere, as the Constitu­  
tions of the States are within their respective  
spheres ; but with this obvious anil essential  
difference, that being a compact among the  
Stales in their highest sovereign capacity,  
and constituting the people thereof one people  
for certain purposes, it cannot he altered or  
annulled at the will of the States individual///,  
as the Constitution of a State may he at its  
individual will.  
“Nor is the Government of the United  
States, created by the Constitution, less a you  
eminent, in the strict sense of the term, with­  
in the sphere of its powers, than the govern­  
ments created by the constitutions of the States

by Dr. Palmer, but they have some bearing on his cause.  
They relate to the alien and sedition laws, those exceedingly  
odious measures of the dominant or federal party. The Vir-  
ginia resolutions, of December, 1798, protest against these  
laws as unconstitutional, and express the hope that the other  
States will codperate with Virginia “in maintaining unim-  
paired the authorities, rights, and liberties reserved to the  
States respectively, or to the people.” The codperation here in-  
tended is declared by Mr. Madison to consist in “ measures  
known to the Constitution, particularly the ordinary control  
of the people and legislatures of the States over the govern-

showed, was equal to the occasion. The tenor of the debates  
discloses no reference whatever to a constitutional right in an  
individual State to arrest by force the operation of a law of the  
United States.”* And yet the doctrine maintained by the ad-  
vocates of these resolutions in regard to the concurrent inter-  
preting power of the States, and of the Supreme Court, must,  
if we understand it, have brought the States into collision with  
the authorities of the Union.

and of such as were essential towards  
carrying them into effect--that if reser­  
vations were mentioned in the consti­  
tution--an omission of a reservation  
of a power might be construed to im­  
ply the grant thereof.  
As Mr. Madison was more than any  
other man, active and able in advoca­  
ting the adoption of the Constitution,  
his theories regarding it must be high­  
ly esteemed. They may be defined as  
fo&#x27;lows: That the Constitution was a  
compact between soveign communi  
ties; That it formed a Government  
formed by a majority of the people as  
one community, but by the peoples of  
the several State Constitutions. Being  
thus derived from the same source as  
the latter--it has in its presribed limits  
equal authority with the State Consti­  
tution, with this superiority that being  
a compact between several communi­  
ties, each acting in its sovereign capaci­  
ty--it cannot be annulled at the will  
of the States individually.  
That the Constitution, and the laws  
made in pursuance thereof, and all trea­  
sies made under the authority of the

rather, was, that the constitution of the  
United States is a compact between the  
people of the different States with each  
other as stparute and independent sovere?j/e&gt;  
ties. Now, admit this doctrine to be true  
for the argument&#x27;s sake, let us see what  
Mr. Madison says of the compact thus  
formed, what this compact did, and the  
legitimate deduction that he draws from  
it. Mr. Madison in 1830, in his letter in  
answer to inquiries made of him touching  
this matter, says:  
living thus derived from the same source  
as tbe constitutions of the States, it has  
within each State the same authority as the  
constitution of the State, and is as much a  
constitution wi&#x27;liiu the strict sense of the  
term, within its prescribed sphere, as the  
s&#x27;itutious of the States are Within their  
respective sphere-; but with this obvious  
il essential difference, that being a com­  
pact among tbe States iu their highest sov­  
ereign capacity, und constituting the people  
thereof one /&#x27;topic for certain purposes, it  
can not be altered or aunullcd at the will  
of the States individually, as tbe constitu­  
tion of a State may Oie at its individual wili.  
Chief Justice Marshall, in the great case  
of McCulloch vs. the State of Maryland,  
says:  
The goyernipout proceeds direc tly from  
the people. The as-&gt;ent of the States in  
their sovereign capacity is implied in their  
calling a convention and then submitting  
hat instrument to the people. But the  
people were at perfect liberty to accept or

intention of giving the resolutions any such construc-

of Taylor the disunionist and the nullifiers of South

August, 1830, the venerable ex-President, then eighty-  
nine years of age, said:  
  
“The tenor of the debates (in the Legislature of Virginia),  
which were ably conducted and are understood to have been

closes no reference whatever to a constitutional right in an

erned by reality, not by theories and speculations.  
Even the preamble is characteristic. If a union  
of states only had been intended they would have  
said, &quot;We the states,” and if of a people, inde­  
pendently of state organization, they would have  
ordained, “We the people;” but neither one nor  
the other would have been sufficient. &quot;We the  
people of the United States&quot; expresses that it  
was to be a perfect union of states through and

are: (1) The mode of formation. (2) The division  
of the supreme powers of government, between  
the states in their united capacity, and the states  
in their individual capacity. This division of the  
powers of government is peculiar to the United  
States, and is an effective safeguard against dis­  
integration on the one hand, and centralism on  
the other; each has its own sphere in which it can  
move without colliding with that of the other.  
Each is independent and complete in relation to  
its own work; incomplete and dependent on the
