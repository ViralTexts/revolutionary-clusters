As it is probable I shall soon be under the necessity of quitting this place, and entering once more into the bustle of publick life, in conformity to the voice of my Country, and the earnest entreaties of my friends, however contrary it is to my own desires or inclinations; I think it incumbent on me as, your Uncle &amp; friend, to give you some advisory hints, which, if properly attended to, will, I conceive, be found very useful to you in regulating your conduct and giving you respectability not only at present but through every period of Life.  
You have now arrived to that age when you must quit the trifling amusements of a boy, and assume the more dignified manners of a man. At this crisis your conduct will attract the notice of those who are about you; and as the first impressions are generally the most lasting, your doings now may mark the leading traits of your Character through life. It is therefore, absolutely necessary, if you mean to make any figure upon the Stage, that you should take the first steps right. What these steps are—and what general line is to be pursued to lay the foundation of an honorable and happy progress, is the part of age and experience to point out. This I shall do, as far as is in my power, with the utmost chearfulness; and I trust, that your own good sense will shew you the necessity of following it.  
The first and great object with you at present is to acquire, by industry and application, such knowledge as your situation enables you to obtain, and as will be useful to you in life. In doing this two other important objects will be gained besides the acquisition of knowledge—namely, a habit of industry, and a disrelish of that profusion of money &amp; dissipation of time which are ever attendant upon idleness. I do not mean by a close application to your Studies that you should never enter into those amusements which are suited to your age and station. They may be made to go hand in hand with each other—and, used in their proper seasons, will ever be found to be a mutual assistance to each other. But what amusements are to be taken, and when, is the great matter to be attended to. Your own judgement, with the advice of your real friends who may have an opportunity  
  
of a personal intercourse with you can point out the particular manner in which you may best spend your moments of relaxation, much better than I can at a distance. One thing, however, I would strongly impress upon you, viz., that when you have leisure to go into Company that it should always be of the best kind that the place you are in will afford; by this means you will be constantly improving your manners and cultivating your mind while you are relaxing from your books; and good Company will always be found much less expensive than bad. You cannot offer, as an excuse for not using it, that you cannot gain admission there—or that you have not a proper attention paid you in it; this is an apology made only by those whose manners are disgusting, or who⟨se character⟩ is exceptionable; neither of which I hope, will ever be said of you.  
I cannot enjoin too strongly upon you a due observance of economy &amp; frugality—as you well know yourself the present state of your property &amp; finances will not admit of any unnecessary expense. The article of clothing is now one of the chief expenses you will incur; and in this, I fear, you are not so economical as you should be. Decency &amp; cleanliness will always be the first objects in the dress of a judicious &amp; sensible man. A conformity to the prevailing fashion in a certain degree is necessary—but it does not follow from thence that a man should always get a new Coat, or other clothes, upon every trifling change in the mode, when, perhaps, he has two or three very good ones by him. A person who is anxious to be a leader of the fashion, or one of the first to follow it, will certainly appear, in the eyes of judicious men, to have nothing better than a frequent change of dress to recommend him to notice. I would always wish you to appear sufficiently decent to entitle you to admission into any company where you may be; but I cannot too strongly enjoin it upon you—and your own knowledge must convince you of the truth of it—that you should be as little expensive in this respect as you properly can; you should always keep some clothes to wear to Church, or on particular occasions, which should not be worne every day; this can be done without any additional expense; for whenever it is necessary to get new Clothes, those which have been kept for particular occasions will then come in as every day ones, unless they should be of a superior quality to  
  
the new. What I have said, with respect to Clothes, will apply, perhaps, more pointedly to Lawrence than to you; and as you are much older than he is, and more capable of judging of the propriety of what I have here observed, you must pay attention to him, in this respect, and see that he does not wear his clothes improperly or extravagantly.  
Much more might be said to you, as a young man, upon the necessity of paying a due attention to the moral virtues; but this may, perhaps, more properly be the subject of a future letter when you are about to enter into the world. If you comply with the advise herein given to pay a diligent attention to your studies, and employ your time of relaxation in proper company, you will find but few opportunities and little inclination, while you continue at an Academy, to enter into those scenes of vice &amp; dissipation which too often present themselves to youth in every place, &amp; particularly in towns. If you are determined to neglect your books, and plunge into extravagance &amp; dissipation nothing I could now say would prevent it—for you must be employed, and if it is not in pursuit of those things ⟨which are⟩ profitable it must be in pursuit of those which are ⟨destructive⟩.  
As your time of continuing with Mr Hanson will expire the last of this month, and I understand Doctor Craik has expressed an inclination to take you &amp; Lawrence to board with him, I shall know his determination respecting the matter; and if it is agreeable to him &amp; Mrs Craik to take you I shall be pleased with it, for I am certain that nothing will be wanting on their part to make your situation agreeable &amp; useful to you. Should you live with the Doctor I shall request him to take you both under his peculiar care—provide such clothes for you, from time to time, as he shall judge necessary—and do by you in the same manner as he would if you were his own children; which if he will undertake, I am sensible, from the knowledge which I have of him, and the very amiable Character &amp; disposition of Mrs Craik, that they will spare no proper exertions to make your situation pleasing a[nd] profitable to you; should you or Lawrence, therefore, behave in such a manner as to occasion any complaints being made to me—you may depend upon losing that place which you now have in my affections—and any future hopes you may have from me. But if, on the  
  
contrary, your conduct is such as to merit my regard you may always depend upon the warmest attachment &amp; sincere regard of Your affectionate friend &amp; Uncle

Dear GeorgeAs it is probable I shall soon  
be under the necessity of quitting this place,  
and entering once more into the bustle of pub­  
lick life in conformity to the voice of my coun­  
try, and the earnest entreaties of my friends,  
however cootrary it is to mjf own desires or iu­  
clination?-; 1 think it incumbent oo me as your  
uucie and friend, to give you some advisory  
hints, which, if properly attended to, will, J  
conceive, be found very useful to you in regu­  
lating your conduct and giving you respecta­  
bility. uot only at preseut, but through every  
period of life.  
1&#x27;ou have now arrived to that age when you  
must quit the trifling amt&amp;emeuts of a boy,  
and assume the more dignified manners of a  
wail. At this crisis your conduct will attract  
the notice ot those who are about you; and as  
the first impressions are generally the most  
lasting, your doings now may mark the lead­  
ing traits of character through life.  
It is therefore absolutely necessary, if you  
mean to make any figure upon the stage, that  
you should take the first steps right. What  
these steps are, and what geueral line is to be  
pursued to lay the foundation of an houorable  
and happy progress, is the part of age and ex­  
perience to point out. This I shall do, as far  
as is in my power, with the utmost cheerfulness;  
aud I trust that your own good sense will show  
you the necessity of following it.  
The first aud great object with you at pres­  
ent is to acquire, by industry and application,  
such knowledge as your situation enables y.iu  
to obtain, aud as will be useful to you iu iife.  
lu doing this two other important objects  
will be gained besides the acquisition of knowl  
edge, namely: A habit of ludustry and a dis­  
relish ol that profusiou ol money and a dissipa­  
tion of time which are ever attendant upou  
iJJfOt-ss. I do not mean by a close application  
to your studies that you should never enter in­  
to those amusements which are suited to your  
aue and station. They may be made to go band  
in hand with each other, and used in their  
I&#x27;Piper seasons, will ever be found to be a mu­  
tual assistance to each other. But what amuse­  
ments are to be taken, and when is the great  
matter to be attended to? Your own judge­  
ment, with the advice of your real friends who  
may have an opportunity of a personal inter­  
course with you, can point out the particular  
manner iu which you may best spend your mo­  
ments of relaxation much better than I can at  
a distance.  
One thing, however, I would strongly im­  
press upon you, vz: that when you have leiz­  
ure to go into company that it should always  
bo of the best kiud that the place you are iu  
will afford; by this means you will be constant­  
ly improving your manners, aud cultivating  
you mind, while you are relaxing from your  
books; and good company will always be fouud  
less t xpeusive than bad.  
You cauuot offer, as an excuse for not using  
it. that you cannot gain admission there, or  
that you have not a proper attention paid you  
in it; this is an apology made only by those  
whose mauuers are disgusting or whose charac­  
ter is exceptionable; neither of which I hope  
will ever be said of you. I cannot enjoin too  
strongly upou you a due observance of eoonomy  
and frugality, as you well know yourself the  
present state of your property and finances  
will not admit of auy unnecessary expense.  
flie article of clothing is now one of the  
chief expenses you will incur; and in this, I  
fear you are not so economical as you should  
be. Decency and cleanliness will always be  
the first objects iu the dress of a judicious,  
sensible man. A conformity to the prevailing  
fashion in a certaiu degree is necessary; but it  
dots uot loilow from thence, that a man should  
always get a new coat or other clothes upon  
tverv trifling change in the mode when, per­  
haps, he has two or three very good ones by  
luiu. A persoo who is anxious to be a leader  
of the fashion, or oue of the first to follow it,  
*&gt;11 certainly appear in the eyes of judicious  
irn.-u, to have nothing better than a frequent  
flange ot dress to recommend him to uoiice.  
1 Would always wish you to appear sufficiently  
ileceut to entitle you to admission into auy  
company where you may be; but 1 oannot too  
strongly enjoin it upou you, aud your own know­  
ledge must couvii.ee you of the truth of it, that  
you should be as little t xpeus^ve in this respect  
as you properly can; you should always  
keep some clothes to wear^ to ohurch, or  
on particular occasions, which should not be  
worn every day. This eau be done without any  
additional expense, for whenever it is neces­  
sity to get new clot bos those which have been  
kept ibr particular occasions will then come in  
as every day oues, unless they should be of a  
superior quality to the uew. What I have said  
*?th respect to clothes will apply perhaps more  
pointedly to Lawreuce than to you, and as you  
!?:?? much older than he is, and more capable  
0 ju i.dug of the propriety of what I have here

t.tis respect, aud see that he does uot wear his

MOUNT VERNON, 23d March, 1789.  
  
DEAR GEORGE: As it is probable I shall soon  
he under the necessity of quitting this place and  
entering once more into the bustle of publick  
life, in conformity to the voice of my country  
and the earnest entreaties of my friends, how-  
ever contrary it is to my own desires or inclina-  
tions, I think itincumbent on meas your uncle  
and friend to give you some advising hints,  
which, if properly attended to, will, { conceive,  
be found very useful to you in regulating your  
conduct and giving you respectability not only  
at present but through every period of life.  
  
ou have now arrived at that age when you  
must quit the trifling amusements of a boy, and  
assume the more dignified manners of a man.  
At this crisis your conduct will attract the notice  
of those who are about you, and as the first im-  
pressions are generally the most lasting, your  
doings now may mark the leading traits of your  
character through life. It is therefore absolute-  
ly necessary, if you mean to make any figure  
upon the stage of life, that you should take the  
first steps right. What these stepa are,and what  
general line is to be pursued to lay the founda-  
tion of an honorable and happy progress, is the  
part of age and experience to point out. This I  
shall do as far as in my power, with the utmost  
cheerfulness, and I trust that your own good  
sense will show you the necessity of following it.  
  
The first and great object wita you at present  
isto acquire by industry and application such  
knowle ige as your situation enables you to ob-  
tain and as will be useful to youinlife, In  
doing this two other important objects will be  
gained besides the acquirement of knowledge—  
namely, a habit of industry and disrelish of  
that profusion of money and dissipation of time  
which are ever attended upon idleness. I do not  
mean ciose application to your studies; that  
you should never enter into those amusements  
which are suited to your age and station. They  
may be made to go hand in hand with each  
other, and used in their proper seasons will be  
found to be @ mutual assistance to each other.  
But what amusements are to be taken and  
what is the great matter to be attend-  
ed to? Your own judgment, with the  
advice of your real friends, who may  
have an-opportunity of a personal tintercourse  
with you, can point out the particular manner  
in which you may best spend your moments of  
relaxation, much better than:I can at a distance.  
One thing, however, I would strongly impress  
npon you, namely, that when you have leisure  
to go into company thatit always should be of  
the best kind that the place you are in will  
afford. By this means you will be constantly  
improving your manners, and cultivating your  
mind while you are relaxing from your books,  
and good company will always be found much  
less expensive than bad.  
  
You cannot offer as an excuse for not using it  
thatyou cannot gain admission there, or that  
  
ou have nota proper attention paid you init.  
  
his isan apology made only by those whose  
manners are disgusting, or whose character is  
exceptionable, neither of which I hope will ever  
be said of you. I cannot enjoin too strongly  
upon you a due observance of economy and  
frugality. As you will know yourself, the pres-  
ent state of your property and finances will not  
admit of any unnecessary expense.  
  
The article of clothing is now one of the chief  
expenses you will incur, and in this I fear you  
are not so economical as youshould be. Decency  
and cleanliness will always be the first objects in  
the dress of a judicious and sensible man. A  
conformity to the prevailing fashion in a certain  
degree is necessary, but it does not follow  
from thence that a man _ should always  
get anew coat or other clothes upon every  
trifling change in the mode, when perhaps he  
has two or three very good ones by him. A per-  
son who is anxious to be a leader of the fashion  
or one of the first to follow it will certainly ap-  
pear in the eves of judicious men to have noth-  
ing better than a frequent change of dress to  
recommend him to notice. 1 would wish you to  
appear sufficiently decent to entitle you to ad-  
mission into any company where you may be.  
Icannot too strongly enjoin it upon you, and  
your own knowledge must convince you of the  
truth of i1t—that you should be as little expen-  
sive in this object as you properly can; you  
should always keep some clothes to wear to  
church or on particular occasions, which  
should not be worn every day. This  
can be done without any additional ex-  
pense, for whenever it is necessary to get new  
clothes those which have been kept for particu-  
lar occasions will then come in as every day  
clothes, unless they should be of a superior qual-  
ity tothe new. What I have said with respect to  
clothes will apply, perhaps, more pointedly to  
Lawrence than to you. And as you are much  
older than he is, and more capable of judging of  
the propriety of what I have observed, you must  
pay, attention to him in this respect and see that  
  
e does not wear his clothes improperly or ex-  
travagantly.  
  
Much more might be saidto you as a young  
man upon the necessity of paying a due atten-  
tion to the moral virtues; but this may, per-  
haps, more properly be the subject of a future  
letter when you are about to enter into the  
world. If you comply with the advice herein  
given to pay a diligent attention to your studies  
andemploy your time of relaxation in proper  
company, you will tind but few opportunities  
and little inclination while you continue at an  
academy to enter those scenes of vice and dis-  
sipation which too often present themselves ta  
youth in everg place and particularly in towns.  
If you are determined to neglect your books  
and plunge into extravagance and dissipation,  
nothing that I could now say would prevent it,  
for you must be employed, and if it is not in  
pursuit of those things which are profitable, it  
must be in pursuit of those which are destructr  
ive. Your affec. triend &amp; uncle,

“Mount Vernon, 33d March, I7s:i.  
“Dear Oe.orpe: As it is probable I shall  
soon he under the necessity of quitting  
| this plaee and entering once more into the  
bustle of puhlick life, in conformity to the  
voice of my country and the earnest en­  
treaties of my friends, however contrary  
it is to my own desires or inclinations, 1  
think it incumbent on me as your uncle  
anil friend to give you some advising hints,  
which, if properly attended to, will, I con­  
ceive, he found very useful to you in regu­  
lating your conduct and giving you re­  
spectability not only at present but  
through every period of life.  
“You have now arrived at that age when  
you must quit the trifling amusements of  
a boy and assume the more dignified  
manners of a man. At this crisis your  
conduct will attract the uotice of those  
who are about you, and as the first, im­  
pressions are generally the most lasting,  
your doings now may mark the leading  
iraits ot your character through life. It  
is therefore absolutely necessary, If you  
mean to make any figure upon the stage  
of life, that you should take the first steps  
right. What these steps are. anil what  
general line is to he pursued to lay the  
foundation of an honorable and happy  
progress, is the part of age and experience  
to point out. This l shall do as far as in  
my power, with the utmost cheerfulness,  
and 1 trust that your own good sense will  
show you the necessity of following it.  
“The first and great object with you at  
present is to acquire by industry and ap­  
plication such knowledge as your situa­  
tion enables you to obtain and as will be  
useful to you in life. In doing this two  
other important objects will be attained  
besides the acquirement of knowledge—  
namely, a bnbit, of Industry and disrelish  
of that profusion of money and dissipation  
of time which are ever attended upon idle­  
ness. I do not mean close application to  
your studies; that you should never enter  
into those amusements which are suited to  
your age and station. They may lie made  
to go hand in hand with each other, and  
used in their proper seasons will tie found  
to be a mutual assistance to each other.  
Hut what amusements are to be taken  
and what is the great matter to tie attend­  
ed to? Your own judgment, with the ad­  
vice of vour real friends, who may have  
an opportunity of a personal intercourse  
with you, can point out the particular  
manner in which you may best spend  
your moments of relaxation, much belter  
than 1 can at a distance, one thing, how­  
ever, 1 w ould strongly impress upon you,  
namely, that when you have leisure to go  
into company that it always shouid be of  
the best kind that the place vou are In will  
afford. By this means you will be con­  
stantly improving your manners and cul­  
tivating your mind while you are relaxing  
from your books, and good company will  
always be found much less expensive  
than bad.  
“You cannot offer as an excuse for not  
using it that you cannot gain admission  
there, or that you have not a proper atten­  
tion paid to you in it. This is an apol­  
ogy made only by those whose man­  
ners are disgusting, or whose character is  
exceptionable, neither of which 1 hope  
will ever lie said of you. I cannot enjoin  
too strongly upon you a due observance  
of economy&quot; and frugality. As you will  
know yourself, the present state of your  
property and finances will not admit of  
any unnecessary expense.  
“The article of clothing is now one of  
the chief expenses you will incur, and in  
this 1 fear you are not so economical as  
you should be. Recency anil cleanliness  
will always lie the first objects in the  
dress of a judicious and sensible man. A  
conformity to the prevailing fashion in a  
certain degree is necessary, but it does  
not follow Irom thence that a man should  
always get anew coat or other clothes  
upon every trifling change in the mode,  
when perhaps he has two or three very  
good ones by him. A person who is anx­  
ious to be a &quot;leader of the fashion or one of  
the first to follow it will certainly appear  
in the eyes of judicious men to have noth­  
ing better than a frequent change of dress  
to recommend him to notice. I would  
wish you to appear sufficiently decent to  
entitle you to admission into any com­  
pany where you may be. I cannot too  
strongly enjoin it upon you, and your own  
knowledge must convince you of the truth  
of it— that you should lie as little expen­  
sive in this object as you properlv can;  
you shouid always keep some doth:s to  
wear to church or on particular occasions,  
which should not be worn every day. This  
can be done without any additional ex­  
pense. for whenever it is necessary to get  
new clothes those which have been kept  
for particular occasions will then come In  
as every-day clothes, unless they should  
be of a superior quality to the new. What  
I have said with respect to clothes will  
apply, perhaps, more pointedly to Law­  
rence than to you. And as you are much  
older than he is, and more capable of  
fudging of the propriety of what I have  
observed, you must pay attention to him  
in this respect and see that lie does  
not wear his clothes improperly or ex­  
travagantly.  
  
“Much more might be said toyoujas a  
young man upon the necessity of paying  
a due attention to the moral virtues; but  
this may. pprhaps. more properly be the  
subject of a luture letter when you are  
about to enter into the world. It you  
comply with the advice herein given to  
pay a diligent attention to your studios  
and employ your time of relaxation in  
proper company, you will find but few  
opportunity and little inclination while  
you continue at an academy to enter

too often present themselves to youth  
in every place nnd particularly in  
towna. If you areJdetermlncS to nog­  
loot your Itooka and plunge into extrava­  
gance and dissipation, nothing that I  
could now aay would prevent it, for you  
must be employed, and if it is not in pur­  
suit ol those things which are profitable,  
it must be In pursuit of those which are  
destructive. Your affec. friend A unde

“You have now arrived to that age when you must  
quit the trifling amusement of a boy, and assume the  
more dignified manners of a man. At this crisis your  
conduct will attract the notice of those who are about  
you ; and as the first impressions are generally the most  
lasting, your doings now may mark the leading traits of  
your character through life. It is therefore absolutely  
necessary, if you mean to make any figure upon the  
stage, that you should take the first steps right... .  
The first and great object with you at present is to  
acquire, by industry and application, such knowledge as  
your situation enables you to obtain, and as will be use-  
ful to you in life. In doing this, two other important  
objects will be gained besides the acquisition of knowl-  
edge—namely, a habit of industry, and a disrelish of  
that profusion of money and dissipation of time which  
are ever attendant upon idleness. [ do not mean by a  
close application to your studies that you should never  
enter into those amusements which are suited to your  
age and station. They may go hand in hand with each  
other, and, used in their proper seasons, will ever be  
found to be a mutual assistance to each other. But  
what amusements are to be taken, and when, is the  
great matter to beattended to. Your own judgment, with  
the advice of your real friends who may have an oppor-  
tunity of a personal intercourse with you, can point out  
the particular manner in which you may best spend your  
moments of relaxation, much better than I can at a  
distance. One thing, however, I would strongly impress  
upon you, viz., that when you have leisure to go into  
company, that it should always be of the best kind that  
the place you are in will afford. By this means you  
will be constantly improving your manners and cultivat-  
ing your mind while you are relaxing from your books ;  
and good company will always be found much less ex-  
pensive than bad.”

After answering the boy that it was his uncle’s  
wish that he should always be well dressed, he  
tells him it is necessary always to have “ clothes for  
church, and for particular occasions which should  
not be worne every day,” and then tells him that the  
clothes saved for church and particular occasions  
will be found suitable for daily wear. Washington  
then refers to the use of time, saying :

Mount VERNON, 2}, March 1789.  
DEAR GEORGE.  
  
As it is probable I shall soon be under the necessity of quit-  
ting this place and entering once more into the bustle of public  
life, in conformity to the voice of my Country, and the earnest  
entreaties of my friends, however contrary it is to my own de-  
sire or inclinations; I think it incumbent upon me as, your  
uncle and friend, to give you some advisory hints, which, if  
properly attended to, will, | conceive, be found very useful to  
you in regulating your conduct and giving you respectability  
not only at present but through every period of life.—  
  
You have now arrived to that age when you must quit the  
trifling amusements of a boy, and assume the mere dignified  
manners of a man.—At this crisis your conduct will attract  
the notice of those who are about you ;—and as the first im-  
pressions are generally the most lasting, your doings now may  
mark the leading traits of your character through life. It is  
therefore, absolutely necessary, if you mean to make any figure  
upon the stage, that you should take the first steps right.—  
What these steps are—and what general line is to be pursued  
  
  
  
to lay the foundation of an honorable and happy progress, is  
the part of age and experience to point out.—This I shall do,  
as far as is in my power, with the utmost cheerfulness ; and,  
I trust, that vour own good sense will show you the necessity  
of following it.—  
  
The first and great object with you at present, is to acquire  
by industry and application, such knowledge as your situation  
enables you to obtain, a u as will be useful to you in life.—In  
doing this two other important objects will be gained besides

—or that you have not a proper attention paid you in it, this  
is an apology made only by those whose manners are dis-  
gusting, or whose character is exceptionable ; neither of which,  
I hope, will ever be said of you.— —  
  
I cannot enjoin too strongly upon you a due observance of  
economy and frugality—as you well know yourself the present

necessary expense.—The article of clothing is now one of the  
chief expenses you will incur, and in this, I fear, you are not

judicious men, to have nothing better than a frequent change  
of dress to recommend him to notice.—I would always wish  
you to appear sufficiently decent to entitle you to admission  
into any company where you may be :—but I cannot too strongly  
enjoin it upon you—and your own knowledge must convince  
you of the truth of it—that you should be as little expensive  
in this respect as you properly can ;—you should always keep  
some clothes to wear to Church, or on particular occasions,  
which should not be worn every day.—This can be done with-  
out any additional expense ;-—for whenever it is necessary to  
get new clothes, those which have been kept for particular occa-  
sions will then come in as every day ones, unless they should  
be of a superior quality to the new.—What I have said with re-  
spect to clothes will apply pehaps more pointedly to Lawrence  
than to you ;—and as you are much older than he is, and more  
capable of judging of the propriety of what I have here ob-  
served, you must pay attention to him, in this respect, and see  
that he does not wear his clothes improperly or extravagantly.—  
  
Much more might be said to you, as a young man, upon the  
necessity of paying a due attention to the moral virtues, but  
this may perhaps more properly be the subject of a future let-  
ter when you are about to enter into the world.—If you comply  
with the advice herein given to pay a diligent attention to your  
studies, and employ your time of relaxation in proper com-  
pany, you will find but few opportunities and little inclination,  
while you continue at an academy, to enter into those scenes  
of vice and dissipation which too often present themselves to  
youth in every place, and particularly in towns.—If you are  
determined to neglect your books, and plunge into extrava-  
gance and dissipation, nothing that I could now say would  
prevent it, for you must be employed, and if it is not in pur-  
suit of those things which are profitable it must be in pursuit  
of those which are not.—As your time of continuing with Mr.  
Hanson will expire the last of this month, and I understand  
that Doctor Craik has expressed an inciination to take you and  
Lawrenc@to board with him, I shall know his determination  
respecting the matter ; and if it is agreeable to him and Mrs.  
Craik to take you, I shall be pleased with it, for I am certain  
that nothing willbe wanting on their part to make your situation

agreeable and useful to you should you live with the Doctor.  
I shall request him to take you both under his peculiar care—  
provide such clothes for you, from time to time, as he shall  
judge necessary—and do by you in the same manner as he  
would if you were his own children ;—which if he will under-  
take, I am sensible, from the knowledge which I have of him,  
and the very amiable character and disposition of Mrs. Craik  
that they will spare no proper exertions to make your situa-  
tion pleasing and profitable to you ;—should you or Lawrence,  
therefore, behave insuch manner as to occasion any complaints  
being made to me—you may depend upon losing that place which  
you now have in my affections—and any future hopes you may  
have from me.—But if, on the contrary, your conduct is such  
as to merit my regard you may always depend upon the warmest  
attachment, love and sincere regard of  
  
Your affectionate friend and Uncle,  
  
Go. WASHINGTON

Mount Vernon, 23rd March, 1789.  
Dear George: As it is probable I shall  
soon be under the necessity of quitting  
this place and entering once more into the  
of publick life, in conformity to the  
voice of my country and the earnest en  
treaties of my friends, however contrary  
it is to my own desires or inclinations, I  
think it incumbent on me as your uncle  
friend to give you some advising  
hints, which, if properly attended to, will.  
I conceive, be found very useful to you in  
g your conduct and giving you  
tability, not only at present, but  
through every period of life.  
You have now arrived at that age when  
you must quit the trifting amusements of  
a boy, and assume the more dignified  
manners of a man. At this crisis your  
conduct will attract the notice of thost  
who are about you, and as the first im­  
enerally the most lasting.  
your doings now may mark the leading  
traits of your character through life, It  
is, therefore, absolutely necessary, if you  
 mean to make any figure upon the stage  
of life, that you should take the first step  
right. What these steps are, and what  
general line is to be pursued to lay the  
foundation of an honorable and happy  
progress, is the part of ase and exper  
to point out. This I shall do, as far as in  
my power, with the utmost cheerfulness,  
and I trust that your own good sense will  
show you the necessity of following it.  
The first and great object with you at  
present is to acaulre by industry and  
application such knowledge as your  
situation enables you to obtain and as  
will be useful to you in life. In doing  
this two other important objects will be  
gained, besides the acquirement of knowl­  
edge-namely, a habit of industry  
disrelish of that profusion of money and  
dissipation of time which are ever  
attended upon idleness. I do not mean  
close application to your studies; that  
you should never enter into those amuse  
ments which are suited to your ase and  
station. They may be made to go hand  
in hand with each other, and used in  
their proper seasons will be found t  
be a mutual assistance to each other.  
But what amusements are to be taken  
and what is the great matter to be  
attended to? Your own judgment, with  
the advice of your real friends, who may  
have an opportunity of a personal  
urse with you, can point out the  
particular manner in which you may best  
spend your moments of relaxation, much  
better than I can at a distance. One thing  
however, I would strongly impress upon  
you--namely, that when you have i  
to go into company that it always should  
be the best kind that the place you are­  
in will afford. By this means you will  
be constantly improving your manners,  
and cultivating your mind while you are  
relaxing from your books, and good  
company will always be found much less  
expensive than bad.  
You cannot offer as an excuse for not  
it that you cannot gain admission  
there, or that you have not a proper at-  
tention paid you in it. This is an  
made only by those whose manners are  
ing or whose character is excep-­  
tionable, neither of which I hope winl  
ever be sald of you. I cannot enjoin too  
strongly upon you a due observance of  
economy and frugality. As you will know  
yourself, the present state of your  
properly and finances will not admit of  
any unnecessary expense.  
article of cdotning is now one of  
the chief expenses you will incur, and in  
this I fear you ar not so economical as  
should be. Decency and cleanliness  
will always be the first objects in the  
dress of a judicious and sensible man. A  
conformity to the prevalling fashion in a  
certain degree is necessary, but it does  
not follow from thence that a man should a  
always get a new coat or other clothes f

upon trifling change in the mode, when  
perhaps he has two or three very good  
by him. A person who is anxious  
to be a leader of the fashion or one of the  
first to follow it will certainly appear in  
the eyes of judicious men to have no-  
thing better than a frequent change of  
to recommend him to notice. I  
would wish you to appear sufficiently de  
t to entitle you to admission into any  
company where you may be. I cannot  
too strongly enjoin it upon you, and your  
own knowledge must convince you of the­  
truth of it--that you should be as little  
expensive in this object as you properly  
an; you should always keep  
 wear to church or on particu-­  
ir occasions, which should not be worn  
y day. This case can be done with  
out any additional expense, for when-­  
ever it is necessary to get new clothes  
those which have been kept for particu-  
lar occasions will then come in as every.  
day clothes, unless they should be of a  
superfor quality of the new. What I have  
aid with respect to clothes will apply,  
perhaps, more pointedly to Lawrence  
than to you. And as you are mucp older  
than he is, and more capable of judging  
of the propriety of what I have observed,  
you must pay attention to him in this re  
and see that he does not wear his  
clothes improperly or extravagantly.  
Much more might be said to you as a  
young man upon the necessity of paying  
a new attention to the moral virtues, but  
this may, perhaps, more properly be the  
subject of a future letter when you are  
about to enter into the world. If you  
comply with the advice herein given to  
pay a diligent attention to your studies  
and employ your time of relaxation in  
proper company, you will find but few  
opportunitles and little inclination while  
you continue at an academy to enter  
scenes of vice and dissipation  
which too often present themselves to  
youth in every place, and particularly in  
towns. If you are determined to neglect  
your books and plunge into extravag  
and dissipation, nothing that I could now  
would prevent it, for you must be  
employed, and if it is not in pursuit of  
things which are profitable, it must  
be in pursuit of those which are destruce  
tive. Your affec, friend a uncle,  
GO. WASHINGTON
