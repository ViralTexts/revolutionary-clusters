To the People of the State of New-York.  
THE third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the executive authority is an adequate provision for its support. It is evident that without proper attention to this article, the separation of the executive from the legislative department would be merely nominal and nugatory. The Legislature, with a discretionary power over the salary and emoluments of the Chief Magistrate, could render him as obsequious to their will, as they might think proper to make him. They might in most cases either reduce him by famine, or tempt him by largesses, to surrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations. These expressions taken in all the latitude of the terms would no doubt convey more than is intended. There are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of their duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils: And in the main it will be found, that a power over a man’s support is a power over his will. If it were necessary to confirm so plain a truth by facts, examples would not be wanting, even in this country, of the intimidation or seduction of the executive by the terrors, or allurements, of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body.  
It is not easy therefore to commend too highly the judicious attention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed Constitution. It is there

e on the appointment of a President is once for all to declare what shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which he shall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to alter it either by increase or diminution, till a new period of service by a new election commences. They can neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon his necessities; nor corrupt his integrity, by appealing to his avarice. Neither the Union nor any of its members will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty to receive any other emolument, than that which may have been determined by the first act. He can of course have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by the Constitution.  
The last of the requisites to energy which have been enumerated are competent powers. Let us proceed to consider those which are proposed to be vested in the President of the United States.  
The first thing that offers itself to our observation, is the qualified negative of the President upon the acts or resolutions of the two Houses of the Legislature; or in other words his power of returning all bills with objections; to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws, unless they should afterwards be ratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the legislative body.  
The propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights and to absorb the powers of the other departments, has been already suggested and repeated; the insufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each, has also been remarked upon; and the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own defence, has been inferred and proved. From these clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of a negative, either absolute or qualified, in the executive, upon the acts of the legislative branches. Without the one or the other the former would be absolutely unable to defend himself against the depredations of the latter. He might gradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions, or annihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or the other, the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the same hands. If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the legislative body, to invade the rights of the executive, the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us, that the one ought not to be left at the mercy of the other, but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of self defence.  
But the power in question has a further use. It not only serves as a shield to the executive, but it furnishes an additional security against the enaction of improper laws. It establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body calculated to guard the community against the effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence a majority of that body.  
The propriety of a negative, has upon some occasions been combated by an observation, that it was not to be presumed a single man would possess more virtue or wisdom, than a number of men; and that unless this presumption should be entertained, it would be improper to give the executive magistrate any species of controul over the legislative body.  
But this observation when examined will appear rather specious than solid. The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the executive: But upon the supposition that the legislative will not be infallible: That the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of the other members of the government; that a spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations; that impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which itself on maturer reflection would condemn. The primary inducement to conferring the power in question upon the executive, is to enable him to defend himself; the secondary one is to encrease the chances in favor of the community, against the passing of bad laws, through haste, inadvertence, or design. The oftener a measure is brought under examination, the greater the diversity in the situations of those who are to examine it, the less must be the danger of those errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of those misteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or interest. It is far less probable, that culpable views of any kind should infect all the parts of the government, at the same moment and in relation to the same object, than that they should by turns govern and mislead every one of them.  
It may perhaps be said, that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones; and may be used to the one purpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the laws, which form the greatest blemish in the character and genius of our governments. They will consider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of lawmaking, and to keep things in the same state, in which they may happen to be at any given period, as much more likely to do good than harm; because it is favorable to greater stability in the system of legislation. The injury which may possibly be done by defeating a few good laws will be amply compensated by the advantage of preventing a number of bad ones.  
Nor is this all. The superior weight and influence of the legislative body in a free government, and the hazard to the executive in a trial of strength with that body, afford a satisfactory security, that the negative would generally be employed with great caution, and that there would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness, in the exercise of it. A King of Great-Britain, with all his train of sovereign attributes, and with all the influence he draws from a thousand sources, would at this day hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions of the two houses of Parliament. He would not fail to exert the utmost resources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to him, in its progress to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect, or of risking the displeasure of the nation, by an opposition to the sense of the legislative body. Nor is it probable that he would ultimately venture to exert his prerogative, but in a case of manifest propriety, or extreme necessity. All well informed men in that kingdom will accede to the justness of this remark. A very considerable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown has been exercised.  
If a magistrate, so powerful and so well fortified as a British monarch, would have scruples about the exercise of the power under consideration, how much greater caution may be reasonably expected in a President of the United States, cloathed for the short period of four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and purely republican?  
It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not using his power when necessary, than of his using it too often, or too much. An argument indeed against its expediency has been drawn from this very source. It has been represented on this account as a power odious in appearance; useless in practice. But it will not follow, that because it might be rarely exercised, it would never be exercised. In the case for which it is chiefly designed, that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights of the executive, or in a case in which the public good was evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable firmness would avail himself of his constitutional means of defence, and would listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility. In the former supposition, his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate interest in the power of his office; in the latter by the probability of the sanction of his constituents; who though they would naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case, would hardly suffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain case. I speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a common share of firmness. There are men, who under any circumstances will have the courage to do their duty at every hazard.  
But the Convention have pursued a mean in this business; which will both facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this respect in the executive magistrate, and make its efficacy to depend on the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body. Instead of an absolute negative, it is proposed to give the executive the qualified negative already described. This is a power, which would be much more readily exercised than the other. A man who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single VETO, might not scruple to return it for re-consideration; subject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one third of each house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections. He would be encouraged by the reflection, that if his opposition should prevail, it would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the legislative body, whose influence would be united with his in supporting the propriety of his conduct, in the public opinion. A direct and categorical negative has something in the appearance of it more harsh, and more apt to irritate, than the mere suggestion of argumentative objections to be approved or disapproved, by those to whom they are addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt to offend, it would be more apt to be exercised; and for this very reason it may in practice be found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it will not often happen, that improper views will govern so large a proportion as two-thirds of both branches of the Legislature at the same time; and this too in defiance of the counterpoising weight of the executive. It is at any rate far less probable, that this should be the case, than that such views should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority. A power of this nature, in the executive, will often have a silent and unperceived though forcible operation. When men engaged in unjustifiable pursuits are aware, that obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot controul, they will often be restrained, by the bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with eagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be feared.  
This qualified negative, as has been elsewhere remarked, is in this State vested in a council, consisting of the Governor, with the Chancellor and Judges of the Supreme Court, or any two of them. It has been freely employed upon a variety of occasions, and frequently with success. And its utility has become so apparent, that persons who in compiling the Constitution were violent opposers of it, have from experience become its declared admirers.  
  
Mr. Abraham Yates, a warm opponent of the plan of the Convention, is of this number.  
  
  
I have in another place remarked, that the Convention in the formation of this part of their plan, had departed from the model of the Constitution of this State, in favor of that of Massachusetts—two strong reasons may be imagined for this preference. One is that the Judges, who are to be the interpreters of the

Besides, why was the Veto given to the President?  
The Federalist (in its7;hl No.) declares, that “It not

## We invite the attention of our readers to the following extracts from the Federalist, a series of papers written, as they are aware, by three of the most distinguished of those who framed the present Constitution of the United states, namely, Hamilton, Jay, and Madison; and written with the purpose of explaining to the people the nature and provisions of that instrument, and to influence their minds in favor of its adoption

to restrain the legislative department from intruding upon  
the rights, and absorbing the powers, of the other departments of  
government; to be a means of protection for the executive; for,  
says he, “ a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each

the executive unquestionably is; and hence arises the constitu-

It was replied, that the superior weight and influence of the  
legislative body, in a free government, and the hazard to the  
Executive in a trial of skill with it, afforded satisfactory security  
that the negative would generally be employed with great cau-  
tion, and that in its exercise there would oftener be*room for a  
charge of timidity than of rashness.  
  
A king of Great Britain, with all his train of sovereign attri-  
butes, and with all the influence he draws from a thousand  
sources, would, at this day, hesitate to put a negative upon the  
joint resolution of the two houses of parliament. But he would  
not fail to exert the utmost resources of that influence to strangle  
a measure disagreeable to him, in its progress to the throne, to  
avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take  
effect, or of risking the displeasure of the nation by an oppo-  
sition to the sense of the legislative body. Nor is it probable  
that he would ultimately venture to exert his prerogative, but  
in a case of manifest propriety or of extreme necessity. A very  
considerable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown  
has been exercised. The friends of the veto power therefore  
remarked, if a magistrate, so powerful, and so well fortified as  
a British monarch, would have scruples about the exercise of  
the power under consideration, how much caution might, reason-  
ably, be expected in a President of the United States, clothed,  
for the short period of four years, with the executive authority  
of a government, wholly and purely republican. It is evident,  
that there would be greater danger of his not using his power,  
when necessary, than of his using it too often or too much.*

rejecting a bill or resolution would bring in review not only all  
the arguments pro and con in relation to the measure that had

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
the I&#x27;eil era list, No. 73, will be a useful aid :  
The propensity of the legislative department to in­  
trude upon the rights, and to absorb the powers of the  
other departments, ha* been already more than once  
suggested , the insufficiency of a mere parchment  
delineation of the boundaries of each, has also been  
remarked upon; and the necessity of furnishing  
each with constitutional arms for its own defence,  
has been inferred and proved. From the?e clear and |  
indubitable principles, results the propriety of a ne­  
gative, either absolute or qualified, in the executive,  
upon the act* of the legislatue branches. W ithout  
the one or the other, the former would be absolutely j  
unable to defend himself against the depredations ot  
the latter. He might gradually be stripped of his  
authorities hy successive resolutions, or annihilated  
by a single vote. And in the one mode or the other,  
the legislative and executive powers might speedily  
come, to be blended in the same hands. If even  
no propensity had ever discovered itself in the le­  
gislative body, to invade the rights of the executive,  
the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety  
would of themselves teach us, that the one ought  
not to be left at the mercy of the other, but ought to  
possess a constitutional and effectual power of self­  
defence.  
But the power in question has a further use. Ii  
not only serves as a ihield to the executive, but ii  
furnishes an additional security against the enaction  
of improper laws. It establishes a salutary check  
upon the legislative body, calculated to guard the  
community against the effect* of faction, precipitan­  
cy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good,  
which may happen to influence n majority of that  
body.  
The propriety of a negative has, upon some occa­  
sions, been combatted by an observaiiott, that it was  
not to be presumed a single man would (Missess  
more virtue or wisdom than a number of men ; and  
that unless this presumption should be entertained,  
it would lie improper to give the executive magis­  
trate any species of control over the legislative  
bod).  
  
But this observation, when examined, will appear  
rather specious than solid. The propriety of the  
thing doe* not turn upon the supposition of ?up&lt;*rior  
wisdom or virtue in the executive; but upon the  
supposition, that the legislative will not lie infalli­  
ble ; that the love of power may sometime* la-tray  
it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of  
the other members of the government ; that a spirit  
of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberation* ,  
that impression* of the moment may sometimes  
hurry it into measures which itself, on mature reflec­  
tion, would condemn. The primary inducement to  
conferring the power in question upon the execu­  
tive, is to enable him to defend himself , the secon­  
dary is to increase the chances in favor,of the com­  
munity against the passing of bad laws, through  
haste, inadvertence, or design. The oftener a mea­  
sure is brought under examination, the greater the  
diversity in the situations of those who are to exam­  
ine it, the less must be the danger of those errors  
which How from want of due deliberation, or ol  
those misteps which proceed from the contagion of  
some common passion or interest. It is far less pro­  
bable, that culpable views of any kind should infect  
all the parts of the government at the same moment,  
and in relation to the same object, than that they  
should by turns govern and mislead every one of  
them.  
It may [lerhaps be said, that the |&gt;owcr of pre­  
venting bad laws includes that of preventing good  
ones ; and may be used to the one purpose, as well  
as to the other. Hut this objection will have little  
weight w ith those who can properly estimate the  
mischiefs ol that inconstancy and mutability in the  
laws, which form the greatest blemish in the clia­  
rectcr and genius of our governments. They w ill  
consider every institution calculated to restrain the  
excess of law-making, and to keep things in the  
same state in which they may happen to lie al any  
given period, as much more likely to do good than  
harm, because it is favorable to greater stability in  
the legislation. The injury which may possibly be  
done by defeating a few good laws, will be amply  
compensated by the advantage of preventing a num­  
ber of bad ones.  
Nor is this all. The superior weight and influ­  
ence of the legislative body in a free government,  
and the hazard to the executive in a trial of strength  
w ith that body, aliord a satisfactory security, that  
the negative would generally be employed with  
great caution ; and that, in its exercise, there would  
oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of  
rashness. A king of Great Britain, with all his tram  
ol sovereign attributes, and with all the influence he  
draws from a thousand sources, would, at this day,  
hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions  
of the two houses of parliament. He would not  
tail to exert the utmost resources of that influence to  
strangle a measure disagreeable to him, in its pro­  
gress to the throne, to avoid being reduced to the  
dilemma of permitting it to lake, elfect, or of risking  
the displeasure of the nation, by an opposition to the  
sense of the legislative body. Nor is it probable,  
that he would ultimately venture to exert bis prero­  
gative, but in a case of manifest propriety, or extreme  
necessity. All well-informed men in that kingdom  
w ill accede to the justness of this remark. A very  
considerable period lias elapsed since the negative of  
the crown has been exercised.  
If a magistrate so powerful, and so well fortified  
as a British monarch, w ould have scruples about the  
exercise of the pow er under consideration, bow much  
greater caution may be reasonably expected in a  
President of the I nitcd Stales, clothed, for the  
short period of four years, w ith the executive au­  
thority of a government wholly and purely repub­  
lican ?  
It is evident that there would be greater danger of  
bis not using his power when necessary, than of  
his using it too often or too much. An argument,  
indeed, against its expediency, lias been drawn from  
this very source. It has been represented, on this  
account, as a pow er odious in appearance, useless in  
practice. Hut it will not follow, that because it  
might rarely, it would never be exercised. In the  
case for which it is chiefly designed, that of an im­  
mediate attack, upon the constitutional rights of the  
executive, or in a case in which the public good w as  
evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man of tolerable  
firmness would avail himself of bis constitutional  
means of defence, and would listen to the admoni­  
tions of duty and responsibility. In the former sup­  
position, his fortitude would be stimulated by his  
immediate interest in the power of his office ; in the  
latter, by the probability of the-sanction of his con­  
stituents . who, though they would naturally incline  
to the legislative body in a doubtful case, would  
hardly sutler their partiality to delude them in a  
very plain one. 1 speak now w ith an eye to a ma­  
gistrate possessing only a common share of firmness.  
There are men, who, under any circumstances,  
will have the courage to do their duty at every  
  
hazard.  
But the convention have pursued a mean in tliis  
business, which will both facilitate the exercise of  
the power vested in this respect in the executive  
magistrate, anil make its efficacy to depend on the  
sense of a considerable part of the legislative body­  
Instead of an absolute, it is proposed to give the ex­  
ecutive the qualified negative, already described.?  
This is a power w hich would be much more readily  
exercised than the other. A man who might be  
afraid to defeat a law by his single i n o, might not  
scruple to return it for re-consideration ; subject to  
being finally rejected, only in the event ot more  
than one-third of each house concurring in the suf­  
ficiency of his objections, lie would be encouraged  
by the reflection, that if his opposition should pre­  
vail, it would embark in it a very respectable pro­  
portion of the legislative body, whose influence  
would be united with his in supporting the propri­  
ety of his conduct in the public opinion. A direct  
and categorical negative, has something in the ap­  
pearance of it more harsh, and more apt to irritate,  
than the mere suggestion of argumentative objec­  
tions to be approved or disapproved, by those to  
whom they are addressed. In proportion as it  
would be less apt to offend, it would be more apt to  
be exercised ; and for tins very reason it may in  
practice be found more effectual. It is to be hoped  
that it w ill not often happen, that improper views  
will govern so large a proportion as two-thirds of i  
both branches of the legislature at the same time ;  
and this too in defiance of the counterpoising weight  
of the Executive. It is at any rate far less probable,  
that this should be the case, than that such views  
should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare  
majority. A power of this nature in the Executive,  
will often have a silent and unperceived, though  
forcible operation. When men, engaged in unjusti­  
fiable pursuits, are aware, that obstructions may  
come from a quarter which they cannot control, they  
will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of  
opposition, from doing what they would w ith eager­  
ness rush into, if no such external impediments were  
to be feared.  
This qualified negative, as has been elsewhere re­  
marked, is in this Stale vested in a council, consist­  
ing of the Governor, with the chancellor and judges  
of tin&#x27; supreme court, or any two of them. It has  
been freely employed upon a variety of occasions,  
and frequently with success. And its utility has  
become so apparent, the persons&#x27;, w ho, in compiling  
the constitution, were its violent opposers, have from  
experience become its declared admirers.

satisfy our readers that this power never was in  
tended to bo exercised by tho President, in cases  
where he hsppened to differ from Congress, or  
where his scruples did not arise fiom hasty and in­  
discreet legislation.  
&quot; The first thing that olTers itself to our observa­  
tion, is the qualified negative of the president upon  
Ihe acts or resolutions of the two houses of the  
legislature; or, in other worc&quot;s, his pr.wcr of re­  
turning all bills with ohjectiions, which will have  
the effect of preventing ihcir becoming laws, un­  
less liny should afterwards be ratified by two  
thirds of each of the component members of the  
legislative body.  
&#x27;&#x27; The propensity of the legislative department to  
intrude upon th- rights, and lo absorb the powers,  
of the other departments, has been already more  
than once suggested ; the insufficiency of a mere  
paichment delineation of the boundaries of each,  
lias also been remarked upon ; and Ihe necessity  
of furnishing each wnh constitutional arms for its  
own defence, has been inferred and proved. From  
these clear and indubitable principles, results the  
propiiely of a negative, either absolute or qualified,  
in the executive upon tbe acts of tho legislative  
branches. Without the one or the other, ine fur.  
mcr would he absolutely unable to defend himself  
against the depredations of Ihe latter, lie might  
  
gradually be stripped of his authorities by succes­  
sive resolutions, or annihilated by a aingle vote.  
And in the one mode or the other, the legislative  
and executive powers might speedily come to be  
blended in the same hands. If even no propensity  
had ever discovered itself in the legislative body,  
to invade the rights of the executive, the rules of  
just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of  
thimselvea teach us, that the one ought not to be  
left at tho mercy of the other, but ou&quot; lit to possess  
a constitutional and effectual power of self-defence.  
&quot; But the power in question has a further use.  
It not only Berves as a shield to the executive, but  
it furnishes an additional security against the en­  
action of improper laws. It establishes a salutary  
check upon the legislative body, calculated to  
guaid the community against the effects of faction,  
precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the  
public good, which may happen to influence a ma­  
jority of that body.  
&quot; The primary inducement to conferring the  
power in question upon tho executive is, to enable  
him lo defend himself: the secondary is, to in­  
crease the chances in lavor of the community  
against the passing of bad laws, through haste,  
inadvertence, or design.  
&quot;The superior weight and influence of Ihe legis­  
lative body in a free government, and the hazard  
to Ihe executive in a trial of strength with that  
body, afford a satisfactory secarity, that the nega­  
tive would generally be employed with great cau­  
tion ; and that in its exercise, there would oflener  
be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness.  
A king of Great Britain, with all his train of sove­  
reign attributes, and with all the influence he  
draws from a thousand sources, would, at this  
day, hesitate to put a negative upon the joint reso­  
lutions of the two houses of parliament. He  
would not fail to exert the utmost resources of that

aid:.  
The propensity of the legislative department to  
intrude upon the rights, and to ahsoib the powers  
ol the other departments, has been ulready more  
than once suggested; the insufficiency of a mere  
parchment delineation of the boundaries of each,  
has also been remarked upon; and the necessity  
of furnishing each with constitutional onus for its  
own defence, has been in i r rd and proved.  
From these clear and indub.&#x27;ehle principles, re­  
suits the propriety of a nega., .e, either absolute  
or qualified, in the executive, upon the acts ol  
the legislative benches. Without the one or the  
other, the former would be t-bsoiutcly unable to  
defend himself against the depredations of the lat­  
ter. He might gradually be stripped of his au­  
thorities by successive resolutions, or annihilated  
by e single vote. And in the one mode or the  
oilier, the legislative and executive powers might  
speedily come to be biended in the same hands.  
If even no propensity had ever discovered itsell  
in the legislative body, to invade the rights of the  
executive, tin rules of just reasoning and theo­  
retic propriety would of themselves leach us, that  
the one ought not to be left at the mercy of the  
other, but ought to possess a constitutional and  
effectual power of self-defence.  
But the power in question has a further use.  
It not only serves as a shield to the executive, but  
it furnishes an additional security against the en­  
action of improper laws. It establishes a saluta  
ry check upon the legislative body, calculated to  
guard the community against t!u- effects of faction,  
precipitancy, or of any i.npulse unfriendly to the  
public good, which may happen to influence o  
majority of that body.  
The propriety of a negativo has, upon somo oc  
casions, b:;en combalted bv an observation, that  
it was not to be presumed a single nan would  
possess more virtue or wisdom than a number of  
men; and that unless this presumption should be  
entertained, it would be improper to give the ex  
ecutive magistrate any species of conuol over the  
legislative body.  
But this observation, when examined, will ap  
pear rather specious than solid. The propriety of  
the thing does nut turn upon the supposition of  
superior wisuo.n or virtue in the executive; but  
upon the supposition, that the legislative will not  
be infallible; that the love of power may some­  
times betray it into a disposition to encroach upon  
the rights of the other members of the govern­  
ment; that a spirit of faction may sometimes per­  
vert its deliberations, that impressions of the mo  
ment iimy sometimes hurry it into measures which  
i &#x27;.sell, on mature reflection, would condemn.  
Tho primary inducement to conferring the pow  
cr in question upon the executive, is to enable  
him to defend himself; the secondary is to in  
crease the chances in favor of tho community  
ajainst the passing of bad laws, tlirouuh haste, in-  
udvertance, or des&#x27;eu. The oftcner a measure is  
brought cuder examination, the greater the diver­  
sify iu the situations of those who are to examine  
it, ine less must ue l!,o danger ot those errors  
which flow from want of due deliberation, or of  
thosa missteps which proceed liom the contagion  
of some common passion or interest. It is far  
less probable, that culpable views of any kind  
should infect all parts of tiie government at the  
same moment, and iu relation to the Knue object,  
than that they should by turns govern and mis­  
Jead every one of them.  
It may perhaps be sa d, thut the power of pre­  
venting bad Inws includes that of preventing good  
ones; unu may 01 useu to tne one purpose, as  
well as to the other. But this objection wil  
nave nine weight witn those wno can propeiiy  
estimate the inis&#x27;hii-ls of that inconstancy and  
mutHbility in the laws, which form the greatest  
u!e ntsh in the character and genius of our gov  
ermiMitts. I hey will consider evpry insiiiiinon  
calculated to resliini the ev-ess of law-making,  
and, to keep things in the same slate in which  
they til. v hap;n to be at any given period, as  
iiiikIi more likely to do good than harm, because  
it is laviiralilu lo greater stability in the legislation  
The injury which may possibly be duna by de  
fealing a few good laws, will be amply compen  
sated by the advantage of preventing a riutnbei  
of bud ones.  
Nor is ibis all. The supnrior weieht and infill  
enoeof the legislative body in a free government,  
and the hazard to the executive in a trial of  
strength with that body, afford a satisfactory tecu­  
rity, that the negative would be generally em-  
ployed with great caution; and that, in its exer  
cise, there would oflener be room for a charge of  
timidity than of rashness. A king or Ureat 13 n­  
.Jain, with ii hia trai n aovareign attribute, and  
  
with all the influence he draws from a thousand  
sources, would, at this day, hesitate to put a neg­  
ative upon the joint resolutions of the two Houses  
  
of rurliament. Ho would not Tail to exert the  
utmost resources of that influence to strangle a  
measure disagreeable to him, in its piogresslo tho  
throne, lo avoid being reduced to the dilemma of  
permuting it to take ettect, or ol risking the dis­  
pleasure of the nation, by an opposition to the  
sense of the legislative body. Nor is it probable,  
that he would ultimately venture to exert his  
prerogative, but in a case of manifest propriety, or  
extreme necessity. All well-informed men in  
that kingdom will accede to the justness of this re.  
mark. A veiy considerable period has elapsed  
since the negative of the crown has been exercised.  
If a magistrate so powerful, and so well foiti.  
Ced as a British monarch, would have scruples  
about the exercise or the power under considera­  
tion, how much greater caution may be reasona-  
bly expected in a President of the United Slates,  
clothed, for the short period of four years, with the  
executive cuthority of a government wholly and  
purely republican!  
It is evident that iheie would be a greater dan  
ger of his not using his power when necessary,  
than ol his using it too ollen or too much. An  
argument, indeed, against its expediency, has  
been drawn Irom this very source. It has been  
represented, on this account, as a power odious in  
appearance, useless in practice. But it will not  
follow, that because it might rarely, it would nev-  
er be exercised. In the case lor which tt is chief.  
ly designed, that of an immediate attack upon the  
constitutional rights of the executive, oi in a case  
in which the public good was evideutly and pa  
pauly sacrificed, a man ol tolerable hnnness  
would avail himself of his constitutional means or  
defence, and would listen to the admonitions of  
duty and responsibility. In tho former supposi.  
lion, his for itudo would be stimulated by his im­  
mediate interest in the power of his office; in the  
latter, by the probability of ihe sanction of his  
constituents; who, though they would naturally  
incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case,  
would hardly suffer their paitiulity lo delude them  
in a very plain one. I speak now with en eye to  
a magistrate possessing only a common share ol  
firmness. There ate men, who, under any cir­  
cumstances will have the couiage lo do their duty  
at every hazard.  
But the convention have pursued a mean in this  
business, which will both facilitate the exercise of  
the power vested in this respect in the executive  
magistrate, and make its efficacy to depend on  
the sense of a considerable part of tho legislative  
body. Instead of an absolute, it is proposed to  
give the executive the qualified negative, already  
described. This is a power which would be much  
more, readily exercised than tho other. A man  
who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single  
veto, might not scruple to return it forre-consideration;  
subject to being finally rejected, only in  
the event of more than one-third of each house  
concuning in the sufficiency of his objections.  
He would be encouraged by the reflection, that if  
his opposition should prevail, it would embark in  
tt a very respectable proportion of the legislative  
body, whose influence would be united with his  
in supporting the propriety of his conduct in the  
public opinion. A direct and categorical nega  
live, has something in the hppearsnce of it more  
harsh, and nioie apt to irritate, than the mere  
suggestion of argumentative objections lo be ap.  
proved or disapproved, by those to whom they are  
addressed. In proportion as it would be less apt  
to ohend, it would be more opt to be exercised;  
and for this very reason i may in practice be  
found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it  
will not often happen, that improper views will  
govern so large a proportion 83 two-thirds of both  
branches of die legislature at the same time; and  
this too in defiance of the counterpoising weight  
of the Executive. It is at any rate far less proba­  
ble, thut this should be the case, than that such  
views should taint the resolutions and conduct  
of a bare majotily. A power of this notuie in  
the Executive, will often have a silent and un­  
peiceived, though forcible operation. When  
men, engaged in justifiable pursuits, are aware,  
that obstructions may come from a quarter  
which they cannot control, they will often be re.  
strained by the bare apprehension of opposition,  
from doing what they would with eagerness rush  
into, if no such external impediments were to be  
feared.  
This qualified negative, as bus been elsewhere  
remarked, is in this State vested in a council,  
consisting of tho Governor, with the chancellor  
and judges of the supreme, court, or any two of  
them. It has been freely employed on a variety  
of occasions, and frequently with success. And  
its utility has become so apparent, &#x27;he persons,  
who, in compiling the constitution, were its vio  
lent opposeis, have, from experience, become  
its declared admirers.  
A PARE INSTANCE OF INTREPIDITY.  
Mr. Spring had a farm on an island in Saco  
River, from which he wished to build a bridge  
lo the main land, where it would encroach upon  
tho land of his neighbor, Mr. Dennett. The  
channel was not very broad, and a few rods be­  
low were some considerable lalls. Spring built  
abutments and laid the string pieces, but Den­  
nett came iu the night and lore them down.  
Spring, naturally enraged, threatened that if he­  
did so again he should answer for it to him per­  
sonally.Unawed by this threat, no sooner were the  
beams again laid on the abutments than he de

*“The propensity of the Legislative department to in.-

old arguments.  
In the first place it was contended that the Ex­  
ecutive needed the power of either an absolute or  
qualified veto, in order to defend himself against  
the depredations of the legislative department.  
Without the veto power, Mr. Hamilton contended  
that the President &quot;might gradually be stripped of  
his authorities by successive resolutions, or anni­  
hilated by a single vote. And in the one mode  
or the other, the legislative and the executive  
powers might speedily come to be blended in the  
same hands. If even no propensity had ever dis­  
covered itself in the legislative body, to invade  
the rights of the executive, the rules of just rea­

We say the suae thing of the exercise of the Veto  
Power by the Presidents of the United Slate*. The  
mea who formed the constitution, no doubt, intend­  
ed the Veto as a safeguard to the liberties of the peo­

uf the legislature, to give him a qualified control over  
baaty and imperfect legislation, to enable liipi to refer  
doubtful measures hack to the decision of the constit­

power was adopted. Hamilton in the Federalist,  
apeaks of it, to this effect. “It establishes,” he says,

perhaps, they might not have been so conversant  
with history  
In the 73d No, of the Federalist, we find the  
following exposition of the object of the Veto  
&quot;The propensity of the Legislative department  
to thirude upon the righis and to absorb the pow­  
ers of the other departments has already been more  
than once suggested; the insufficiency of a mere  
parchment delineation of the boundaries of each  
has also been marked upon; and the necessity of  
furnishing each with constitutional arms for its  
own defence has been inferred and proved. From  
these clear and indubitable principles resuits the  
propriety of a negative, either absolute or quali­  
fied, in the Executive, upon the acts of the Legisla­  
tive branches. Without the one or the other, the  
former would be absolutely unable to defend him­  
self aguinst the depredations of the latter. He  
might be stripped of his authority by successire  
rerolutions, or annihilated by a single vole. And

Executive powers might speedily come to be blen  
ded in the same hands.  
&quot;If even no propensity had ever discovered it-  
self in the Legislative body to inrade the rights of  
the Eweculire, the rules of just reasoning and theo­  
retic propriety would of themselves teach us that  
the one ought not to be left at the mercy of the

Lhe President&#x27;s conduct is?approval or disapproval ?  
There is no distinction made as to the character of the  
bill*. If the President does not approve the bill, from  
liny cause whatever, ho is commanded by the Constitu  
tiou not to &#x27;i^n it. The papers of the Federalist, con­  
sidered by the Supreme Court itself as authority on all  
constructions of the Constitution, in commenting on  
this power, observes:  
&quot;It not only serves as a shield to the Executive, but  
it furnishes a n additional security against the enaction

upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in |  
the Executive, but upon the supposition that legisla- ?

niously blended, and afford a striking example of the  
mutual checks and balances of the Constitution, ho ad­  
mirably adapted to preserve the rights of the Stales and

Tiie last reason to which I shall advert why the veto  
power was adopted, and ought to be preserved, I shall  
stale in the language of the seventy-third number of the  
Federalist:  
&quot;The propensity (says the author) of the Legislative  
Department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb  
the powers of the other Departments, has been already  
more than once suggested. This instilliciency of a  
mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each,  
Ins also been remarked upon, and the necessity of fur­  
nishing each with constitutional arms for its own de­  
fence, lias been inferred and proved. From these clear  
and indubitable principles results the propriety of a  
negative, either absolute or qualified in the Executive,  
upon the act3 of the legislative branches.&quot;  
Tne Executive, which is the weaker branch, in the  
opinion of the Federalist, ought not to be left at the  
mercy of Congress, &quot;but ought to possess a constitu­  
tional and effectual power of self-defence.&quot; It ought  
to he able to resist encroachments on its constitutional  
rights.

ment. This abundantly appears from what is said  
on this subject by the writers of the Federalist, to  
which we may at all times refer when we wish to  
know how the Constitution was understood by its  
advocates previous to its adoption. They advert  
to the length of time during which this power has  
remained dormant in the English Constitution, in  
order to show the safety of adopting it into our own,  
and for the purpose of quieting the fears of those  
who were alarmed at its dangerous tendency. The  
following extracts will serve to show the scope of  
the argument:  
  
A King of Great Britain, with all his train of  
sovereign attributes, and with all the influence he  
draws from a thousand sources, would, at this day,  
hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions  
of the two Houses of Parliament.&quot;  
&quot;If a Magistrate, so powerful, and so well fortis  
fied, as a British Mlonarch, would have scruples  
about the exercise of the power under consideration,  
how much greater caution may be reasonably ex­  
pected in a President of the United States, clothed

Astatesman might certainly waver  
on so nice a point as that of re-  
quiring one twelfth, more or less, of  
the legislature to carry a measure,  
against the will of the chief magis-  
trate. Two thirds prevailed at this  
time against three fourths, by a  
small majority, and in opposition to  
the vote of the largest states.  
  
The Federalist* soon afterwards  
gave the reasons for the veto as it  
stands, very briefly and clearly as  
follows. “The primary induce-  
ment to conferring the power in  
question upon the executive, is to  
enable him to defend himself; the  
secondary is to increase the chances  
in favor of the community, against  
the passing of bad laws, through  
haste, inadvertence, or design.”  
This latter reason is a good one,  
and sufficient to vindicate some kind  
of executive negative against disap-  
pointed and angry partisans. But it  
may be doubted whether the fears  
entertained by the convention, that  
the legislative would crush the ex

a The superior weight and influence of the legia.   
lalive body in a free government, and the hazard to   
the executive in a trial of strength with that body,   
afford a satisfactory security, that the negative   
would general:y be employed with great caution;   
and that in its exercise, there would oftener be room   
for a charge of timidity than of rashness. A king   
of Great Britain, with all his train of sovereign at­  
tributes, and with all the influence he draws from a   
thousand source., would, at this day, hesitate to put   
a negative power upon the joint resolutions of the   
two houses of parliament. He would not fail to   
exert the utmost resources of that influence to stran­  
gle a measure disagreeable to him, in its progress to   
the throne, to avoid being reduced to the dilemma   
of permitting it to take effect, or of risking the dis.   
pleasure of the nation, by an opposition to the sense   
of the legislative body. Nor is it probable, that he   
would ultimately venture to exert his prerogative,   
but in a case of manifest propriety, or extreme ne­  
cessity. All well informed men in that kingdom   
will secede to the justness of this remark. A very   
considerable period has elapsed since the negative   
of the crown has been exercised.   
  
If a magistrate, so powerful, and so well fortified.   
as a British monarch, would have scruples about   
the exercise of the power under consideration, how   
much greater caution may be reasonably expected   
in a President of the United States, clothed, for the   
short period of four years, with the executive au­  
thority of a government wholly and purely repub­  
lican!   
  
It it is evident, that there would be greater dan­  
ger of his not using his power when necessary,   
than of his using it too often, or too much. A n ar­  
gument, indeed, against its expediency, has been   
&#x27;hewn from this very source. It has been represen­  
ted, on this account, as a power odious in appear-  
I once, useless in practice. But it will not follow, that   
because it might rarely, it would never be exercised.   
Tn the case for which it is chiefly designed, that of   
an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights   
of the executive, or in a case in which the public   
good was evidently and palpably sacrificed, a man   
of tolerable firmness would avail himself of his   
constitutional means of defence, and would listen   
to the admonitions of duty and responsibility. In   
the former supposition, his fortitude would be stim­  
ulated by his immediate interest in the power of his   
office; in the latter, by the probability of the sanc­  
tion of his constituents; who, though they would   
naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubt­  
ful case, would hardly suffer their partiality to de­  
lude them in a very plain one. I speak now with   
an eye to a magistrate possessing only a common   
share of firmness. There are men who, under any   
circumstances, will have the courage to do their   
duty at every hazard.&quot;

id the necessity of furnishing each with constitu

“The propensity of the Legislative De-  
partment to intrude upon the rights, and to  
absorb the powers, of other departments, has  
been already more than once suggested ; the  
insufficiency of a mere parliamentary deline-  
ation of boundaries of each, has also been  
remarked upon ; and the necessity of furnish-  
ing each with constitutional arms for its own  
defence, has been inferred and proved. From  
these clear and indubitable principles, results  
the propriety of a negative, either absolute  
or qualified, in the Executive, upon the acts  
of the legislative branches. ithout the  
one or the other, the former would be abso-  
lutely unable to defend himself against the  
depredations of the latter. He might gradu-  
ally be stripped of his authority by succes-  
sive resolutions, or annihilated by a “_ *  
vote ; and in the one mode or the other, the  
executive and legislative power might speedi-  
ly come to be blended in the same hands. If  
even no poopenay had ever discovered it-  
self in the Legislative body to invade the  
rights of the Executive, the rules of just rea-  
soning and theoretic propriety would, of  
themselves, teach us, that the one ought not  
to be left at the inercy of the other, but ought  
  
to possess a_ constitutional and effective  
power of self-defence.”  
  
Nothing can be more explicit than this  
language—nothing more clear than that  
this exceptional power was granted to  
the President, under our system, mainl  
from an apprehension, that in its practi-  
cal working, the Executive would prov

But the same eminent expounder of the  
Constitution, to whom we have already  
referred for explanation of the chief  
motives for engrafting upon a republican  
Executive this kingly prerogative, thus  
goes on to explain the secondary use of  
the conceded power :  
  
“Tt not only serves as a shield to the Ex-  
ecutive, but it furnishes an additional secu-

It establishes a salutary check upon the legis-

public good, which may happen to influence

them:  
&quot;The first thing that otters itself to our observation, is the  
qualified negative of the President upon the acts or resolu9500  
t&#x27;ons ?f l&#x27;,,e two &#x27;&#x27;?uses of the legislature ; or, in other words,  
100 hi&quot; power of returning all bills with objections, which will  
have the effect of preventing their becoming laws, unless  
they should afterwards bo ratified by two-thirds of each of  
the comjionent members of tho legislative body.  
&quot;The propensity of the legislative department to intrude  
upon tho rights and to absorb tho powers of the other departments,  
has been already more than once suggested ; the  
  
lnsuthciency ol a mere parcuineni delineation 01 me uounuaries  
of each, has also been remarked upon ; and (be neces|  
ooo sity of furnishing eacli with constitutional arms for its own  
600 defence, lias been inferred and proved. From these clear  
40,1 and indubitable principles results the propriety of a negate  
tive, either absolute or qualified, in the Executive, upon the  
q0 acts of the legislative branches. Without tho one or the  
00 other, tho former would be absolulely unable to defend him Ml  
self against tho depredations of the latter. He might grad06  
ually bo stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions,  
or annihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or the  
other, the legislative and executive powers might speedily  
come to be blended in the same hands. If even no propensity  
had ever discovered itself in the legislative body to in10^  
vade the rights of the executive, the rules of just reasoning  
and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us that  
the one ought not to be left at the mercy of the other, but  
100 ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of selfJJ{?  
defence.  
[JJJJ &quot;But the power in question has a further use. It not  
gg) only serves as a shield to the Executive, but it furnishes an  
100 additional security against the enaction of improper laws  
W0 It establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body,  
calculated to guard the community against the effects of  
faction, precipitancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the  
public good, which may happen to influence a majority ol  
ares, l&#x27;iat body.  
may &quot;The propriety ol a negntive has, upon some occasions,  
d by been combated by an observation, that it was not to be presumed  
a single man would possess more virtue or wisdom  
|(l than a number of men ; and that, unless this presumption  
should be entertained, it would be improper to give the  
Executive Magistrate any species of control over the legis.  
lative body,  
n of  
a/.or &quot;But this observation, when examined, will appear rathuse  
er specious than solid. The propriety of the thing does  
&#x27;J&quot;-&#x27; not turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue  
ade &#x27;n &#x27;k&quot; Executive, but upon the supposition that the legislaving  
l&#x27;ve wl&quot; not k? infallible; that the love of power may  
,&#x27;S sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon  
the rights of the Other members of tho government;  
that a spirit of faction may sometimes perlean  
vort deliberations; that impressions of the inoat  
ment may sometimes hurry it into measures which itself,  
pply on mature reflection, would condemn. The primary inpre­  
ducement to conferring the power in question upon the Exetest  
ctive, is to enable him to defend himself; the secondary,  
* is to increase the chances in favor of the community  
against the passing of bad laws, through haste, inadverWl  
tence, or design. The oftener a measure is brought under  
examination, the greater tho diversity in the situ,ere­  
ations of those who are to examine it, the less must be  
onal the danger of those errors which flow from want ol due deliberation,  
or of those missteps which proceed from the  
anti contaK&#x27;on ?&#x27; ??&#x27;ne common passion or interest. It is far  
less probable that culpable views of any kind should infect  
all the parts of the government at the same moment, and  
in relation to the same object, than that they should by  
nas turn* govern and mislead every one of them,  
uiest &quot;I&#x27; may perhaps be said, that the power of preventing  
hich bad laws includes that of preventing good ones, and may  
odes be used to the one purpose as well as to the other. But this  
erel&quot; ?*&gt;j,,ction w&#x27;&quot; llllve&#x27;&quot;&#x27;&#x27;e weight with those who can pro|e  
t ^ erly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability  
in the laws, which form the greatest blemish in the  
character and genius of our governments. They will considerevery  
institution calculated to restrain the excess ol  
law-making, and to keep things in the same state in which  
cket ihey may happen to be at any given period, as much more  
N&quot;: likely to do good than harm, liecause it is favorable to greater  
stability in the legislation. The injury which may possibly  
be done by defeating a few good laws, will bo amply  
compensated by the advantage of preventing a number of  
bad ones.&quot;

KHfc &quot;It it trident that there would be greater danger of hi*

useless In praotioe. But it will not follow, that be­

self of his constitutional means ol defence, and would Ilei*n  
to the admonition* ol duty and lespoiisibiiity. lu lie  
former supposition, his fortitude would be stimulated by  
his immediate interest in the power of hts ottice ; in thr  
latter, by trie probability of the sanction of his constituent*  
; who, though they would naturally incline to the le  
gisiauve body in a doubtful case, would hardly suller then  
partiality to delude them in a very plain oue. 1 speak now  
with an eye lo a Magistrate possessing only a common  
share of firmness There are men who, under any circumstances,  
will have the courage to do their duty at every  
hazard  
&quot; But the convention have pursued a ine&amp;n in this business,  
which will both facilitate the exercise of the j&gt;ower  
vested 111 this respect in the Executive Magistrate, and  
make its ellicacy to depend on the sense of a considerable  
part of the legislative body. Instead of an absolute, it is  
proposed to give the Executive the qualified negative, already  
described. This is a power which would be much  
more readily exercised than the other A man who might  
be afraid to delcat a law hy his single rrfo, might not scruple  
to return it for reconsideration ; subject to being finally  
rejected, only in the event of more than one-third ol each  
house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections. He  
would be encouraged by the reflection, that il his opi&gt;o-i  
lion should pruyail, it would embark in it a very respecta  
ble proportion of the legislative body, whose influence  
would he united with his in supporting the propriety of his  
conduct in the public opinion. A direct and categorical  
negative has something in the appearance of it more  
harsh, and more apt to irritate, than the mere suggestion oi  
argumentative objections, to he approved or disapproved  
hy tbo&gt;e to whom they are addressed. In proportion as n  
  
would be loss apt to offend, it would be mote apt to bo exorcised;  
and for this very reason it may in practice be  
found more effectual. It is to be hoped that it will not often  
happen, that Improper views will govern so largo a proportion  
us two-thirds of both branches of the legislature at the  
same tune ; and this, too, in deliance o( the counterpoising  
&quot;weight of the Executive. It is at any rate far less probable  
thut this should be the case, than that such views should  
taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority. A  
power of this nature tit the Executive, will often havr a silent  
and unperceived, though forcible optration. IVhtn men, engaged  
in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware thut obstructions  
may come from a quarter which they cannot control, they will  
often be restrained by the bare ap/irehension of opposition,  
from doing what they would with eagerness rmh into if no  
such external impediments uere to be feared.

does not seem to have been muchd versity of opinion on the  
subject of the propriety of giving to the President a nega­

qualified negative, if they are not quite obvious, are, at  
least, when fairly expounded, entirely satisfactory. In the  
first place, there is a natural tendency in the legislative de­  
partment to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the pow­  
ers of the other departments of Government. A mere parch­

The following extract from the Federalist, illustrates the same idea  
  
* The propensity of the legislative d pare ‘nt to intrude upon the rights, and  
to absorb the powers, of the other d partments, has been already more than once  
suggeste 1; the insu fici snCy of a mere par chment delineation of the bound ries of  
each, lias also been remarked upon; and the necessity of furuishing each with con-  
stitational arms for its owa defence, has been inferred and proved. From these  
clear and indubitable principles siecle the propriety of a negative, either absolute  
or qualifie 1, in the executive, upon the acts of the legislative branches. Without  
the ove or the other, the former will be absolutely unable to defend himself against  
the usurpations of the latter. He might gradually be stripped of his authority  
by successive resolutions, or annihilated by a single vote. And in the one mode or  
the other, the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended  
in the same hands. If even no propeasity had ever discovered itself in the legis-  
lative body, to invade the rights of the executive, the rules of just reasoning and  
theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us, that the one ought not to be left  
at the mercy of the other, but ougat to possess a constitutional and effectual power  
of self-defence.’’

An extraordinary mutability has, by this  
means, been introduced into their legis-

the instability of their laws as a  
necessary consequence of a system whose  
general resultB are beneficial. But no  
one in the United States affects to deny  
the fact of this instabi-lity, or to  
contend that it ia not a great evil.  
Hamilton, after having demonstrated the  
utility of a power which might prevent,  
or which might at least impede, the  
promulga-tion of bad laws, adds : &#x27; It  
may perhaps be said that the power jof  
preventing bad laws includes that of  
preventing good ones, and may be used to  
the one purpose as well as to the other.  
But this objection will have little  
weight with those who can pro-perly  
estimate the mischiefs ofthat  
inconstancy and mutability in the laws  
which form the greatest blemish ia the  
character and genius of our  
government.&#x27;-Ferlsralist, No. 73. And,

The propensity of the legislative depart­

the powers of other departments has been  
frequently etbserved, and from the necessity  
of a check upon this assumption of power  
  
results the propriety of a negative, upon the

It seems to be the mission of the Demo­

come into power in crises of extreme peril to  
the Constitution, and by the agency of the  
Executive veto to arrest the tide of Federal  
corruption in the la3t moment of resistance  
to its power. The brightest chapter of the

of the country, is that which perpetuates the

to the support of the President, says:  
  
“The third ingredient towatd constituting the vigor of the executive  
authority is an adequate provision for support. It is evident that without a  
09) attention to this article, the separation of the executive from the legis-  
ative department would be merely nominal and nugatory. The legislature,  
with a discretionary power over the salary and emolument of the chief magis-  
trate, could render him as obsequious to their will as they might see proper to  
make him. ‘They might, in most cases, either reduce him to famine, or tempt  
him by largesses to surrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations.  
‘These expressions, taken in all the latitude of the terms, would doubtless convey  
more than is intended. ‘There are men who could neither be distressed nor  
won into a sacrifice of their duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few  
soils; and, in the main, it will be found that a power over a man’s support is a  
power over his will. If it were necessary to confirm so plain a truth by facts,  
examples would not be wanting, even in this country, of the intimidation or  
seduction of the executive by the terrors or allurement of the pecuniary  
arrangements of the legislative body.”

over hisewill. When favors, once granted, may be withdrawn at pleasure,  
there is ordinarily little security for personal independence of character.”  
  
“The power of giving office thus affects the fears of all who are in and  
the hopes of all who are out; those who are out endeavor to distinguish  
themselves by active political friendship, by warm personal] devotion, by the

One of the means relied on to fortify  
the Executive, was the Veto power;  
without which, HAMIlton said, in No.

solutely unable to defend himself against  
the depredations&quot; of the Legislature.

made to believe these lying hypocrites,   
are frightened to think such a man sits   
in the Presidential chair. But what are   
the facts of the ease ? Let a signer of the   
Constitution answer these charges against   
the President and those who sustain him.   
Alexander Hamilton says in his exposi­  
tion of &quot;The Power of the President:&quot;   
&quot;The first thing that offers itself to our   
observation, is the qualified negative of   
the President upon the acts or resolutions   
of the two Houses of the Legislature; or   
in othet-words, tiffs power of returning all   
bills with his objections, which will have   
the effect of preventing their becoming   
laws, unless they should afterward be rat­  
ified by two thirds of each of the compo­  
nent members of the legislative body.—  
The propensitysof the legislative depart­  
ment to intrude upon the rights and to   
absorb the powers of the other depart­  
ments, has. already been more than once   
suggested ; the insufficieney of a mere   
parchment delineation of each, has also   
been remarked upon, and the necessity of   
furnishing each with constitutional arms   
for its own defence, has been inferred and   
proved. From these clear and indubita­  
ble principles results the propriety of a   
negative, either absolute or qualified, in   
the executive, upon the acts of the legis­  
lative branches. Without the one or the   
other, the President would be absolutely   
unable to defend himself against the dep­  
redations of the legislature. He might   
gradually be stripped of his authority, by   
successive resolutions, or annihilated by a   
single vote. And in one mode or the oth­  
er, the legislative and executive powers   
might speedily come to be blended in the   
same hands.&quot;

tionAms been fully demonstrated to the   
people of this nation, to their great sor­  
row ; and even with the aid of the veto,   
the President has been unable to defend   
himself against their depredations, and   
has gradually been stripped of his onsti­  
tutional authority, and threatened with   
impeachment for even daring to remain   
in office, and not resign the executive   
chair into the hands of Coogress.   
&quot;Bat the power of a negative,&quot; says   
Hamilton, &quot;has a further use. It not on­  
ly serves as a shield to the Executive, but   
it furnishes an additional security against   
the enactment of improper laws. It es­  
tablishes a salutary check upon the legis­  
lative body, calculated to guard the com­  
munity against the effects of-faction, pre­  
cipitancy, or of an impulse unfriendly to   
to the public good, which may happen to   
influence a majority of that body.   
&quot;The propriety of a negative has, upon   
some occasions, been combatted by an ob­  
servation, that it was not to be presumed   
that a single man would possess more vir­  
the and wisdom than a number of Men ;   
and that, unless this presumption should   
be entgrtained, it, would be improper to   
give the executive magistrate any speCies   
of control over the legislative body. But   
this observation, when examined, will ap­  
pear rather specious than solid.   
&quot; The propriety of the thing does not   
turn upon the supposition of superio,Vir­  
tue or wisdom in the executive, but upon   
the supposition that the legislature may   
not be infallible • that the love of power   
may sometimes betray it into a disposi­  
tion to encroach upon the:members .of the   
government ; that a spirit of faction may   
sometimes pervert, its deliberations. It is

Second that &quot;the President shall, at stated times, ree  
coive for his services a compensation, which shall neither

ample that Congress, in the suggestive comment of Mr.

to the veto power was one of the  
elements that entered into the can­  
vass of 1849, which resulted in the  
election of ; General Taylor to the  
Presidency.  
Theframersof our Constitution

taries on tne uonsutution, gives

, In the first place, there is a nat

e ‘veto power’ goes a  
good deal beyond anything ever dreamt of  
either by the founders of American inde­  
pendence or by the builders of English  
libertv.&quot;  
  
Fortunately we an- not left without good  
authority as to what the “founders of  
American independence&quot; understood by  
the “veto power&quot; when they placed it in  
the constitution. It may be found in &quot;The  
Federalist,&quot; the l&gt;est authority wc have as  
to the meaning and intent of those who  
framed the constitution. In article No.  
I,XXII, in the discussion of the the pow­  
ers proposed to lie vested in the President  
of the United States, is the following:  
The first thing that offers itself to our ob­  
servation. is the qualified negative of the Pres­  
ident upon the acts or resolutions of the two  
Houses of the Legislature; or, in other  
words, his power of reluming all bill* w ith  
objections: to have the effect of preventing&#x27;  
them becoming laws, unless tbev should af­  
terwards be ratified by two-thirds of each of  
the component numbers of the Legislative  
body.  
The propensity of the legislative depart­  
ment to intrude upo.i the rights, and to absorb  
the powers, of the other departments, has been  
already suggested ami repeated: the insutti­  
ciency of a mere parchment delineation of the  
boundaries of each, has also been remarked  
upon; and the necessity of furnishing each j  
with constitutional arms for its own defence,  
has been inferred and proved. Front these  
clear ami indisputable principles, results the  
propriety of a negative, either absolute or ;  
qualified, in th« Executive, upon the acts  
of the Legislative branches. Without  
the one or the other, the former:  
would be absolutely unable to defend  
himself against the depreciations of the latter.  
He might gradually be stripped of his au- i  
thorities by successive resolutions or annihil­  
ated by a single vote. And in the one mode  
or the other, the Legislative ami Executive j  
powers might speedily come to be blended in  
the same hands. If even no propensity had  
ever discovered itself in the Legislative body  
to invade the rights of the Executive, the  
rules of just reasoning snd theoretic proprie­  
ty would of themselves teach us. that the one !  
ought not to lie left at the merer of the other,  
but ought to possess a constitutional and ef­  
fectual power of self defence.  
The above and more in the same arti-1  
ole of like tenor shows that the “veto  
power&quot; was intended by those who placed  
it in the constitution to be an instrument in  
the hands of the Executive for his own  
protection os well as to prevent hasty an

the supposition that the Legislative will  
not be infallible ; that the love of power

encroach upon the rights of the other mem-

odged in (he President, was  
not noted for proposing measures that  
would enlarge the liberties of the people.  
He rather desired to limit their power by  
making a House of Lords and in other  
monarchical ways. Most of his sugges  
tions along that line were rejected by  
the liberty -loving Jeffersonians of that  
decade. They adopted his -veto power,  
and no doubt the knowledge that Wash­  
ington, as President, would set a safe  
precedent by its wise exercise, had more  
to do with its adoption than Hamilton&#x27;s

&quot;It is evident that there would be greater  
danger of his not using his power when  
necessary than of his using it too often  
or too much. But it will not follow, that  
because it might be rarely exercised, it

for which&quot; it is chiefly designed, that of  
an immediate attack upon the Constitu­

tolerable firmness would avail himself

since the war, and others have increased  
the proportion of leglalative votes needed  
to override it. Ohio is one of the very few  
states which have never given the gov­  
ernor any control over legislation, and its  
newspapers are now advising an amend­  
ment of the Constitution investing him  
with such power as nearly all other ex-  
ecutives in the country enjoy.  
The great Alexander Hamilton, in the  
Federaliet, defends this prerogative when  
he says: &quot;It not onty serves as a shield  
to the executive, but it furnishes an addi­  
tional sscurity against the enaction of im­  
proper laws. It establishes a salutary  
check upon the legislative body, calcu­  
lated to guard the community against the  
effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any  
impulse unfriendly to the publio good  
which may happen to influence a majority  
of that body.&quot;  
Hamilton further points out that the  
propriety of the veto power did not turn  
upon the supposition of superior wisdom  
or virtue in the executive, &quot;but upon the  
supposition that the legislature will not be  
infallible; that the love of power may  
sometimes betray it into a disposition to  
encroach upon the rights of other meme  
bers of the Government; that a spirit of  
faction may sometimes pervert its deliber­  
ations; that impressions of the moment  
may sometimes hurry it into measures  
which itseif upon maturer reflection would  
condemn.&quot; While the primary induce­  
ment to conferring the power was to  
enable the executive to defend himself, the  
secondary one was to &quot;increase the  
chances in favor of the community against  
the passing of bad laws through haste, in­  
advertence or design.&quot;

Judge Story says: ‘‘ There is a natural tendency in the  
legislative department to intrude upon the rights and absorb  
the powers of the other departments of the government. A  
mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each is  
wholly insufficient for the protection of the weaker branch,  
as the executive unquestionably is, and hence there arises a  
constitutional necessity of arming it with powers for its own  
defence.’’ And Smyth in his lectures on modern history,  
written in 1811, from an English standpoint, says: ‘‘ If there  
results to America a grand calamity and failure of the whole,

from time to time ordain and establish. It  
certainly never was the intention of the  
framers of the constitution to make the exec-  
utive department part of the legislative de-  
partment. Each department was to be co-  
ordinate and interdependent of the others.  
In giving the president a veto power, the con-  
  
  
  
stitution merely furnished him with a weapon  
with which to defend himself, and one with  
which to protect the public from unwise and  
hasty legislation. Hamilton, in the 73d paper  
of the Federalist, writes: ‘‘The propensity  
of the legislative department to intrude upon  
the rights of and to absorb the powers of the  
other departments has been already more  
than once suggested. The necessity of fur-  
nishing each with constitutional arms for its  
own defense has been inferred and proved.  
From these clear and indubitable principles  
results the propriety of a negative of the ex-  
ecutive upon the acts of the legislature  
branches. It not only serves as a shield to  
the executive, but it furnishes an additional  
security against the enaction of improper  
laws. It establishes a salutary check upon  
the legislative body.

The framers of the Constitution would  
have been amazed to hear such a plea,  
that the President of the United States  
should be nothing more than the mere  
echo of fleeting public sentiment. One  
chief reason for vesting him with the veto  
power was that he might stand as a bul-  
wark against thisdanger. Hamilton says  
in the ‘ Federalist’ of this prerogative :  
  
‘‘The power in question not only serves as  
a shield to the executive [from encroachments  
upon his power by the legislative department],  
but it furnishes an additional security against  
the enaction of improper laws. It establishes  
a ree’ f check upon the legislative body,  
calculated to guard the community against  
the effects of faction, precipitancy, or of any  
impulse unfriendly to the public good, which  
may —— to influence a majority of that  
body. The propriety of the thing does not  
turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom  
or virtue in the executive, but upon the suppo-  
sition that the Legislature will not be infal-  
lible ; that impressions of the moment may  
sometimes hurry it into measures which itself,  
on maturer reflection, would condemn. The  
primary inducement to conferring the power  
  
  
  
in question upon the executive is to enable him  
to defend himself; the secondary one is to  
increase the chances in favor of the commu-  
nity against the passing of bad laws, through  
haste, inadvertence, or design. The oftener  
the measure is brought under examination,  
the greater the diversity in the situations of  
those who are to examine it, the less must be  
the danger of those errors which flow from  
want of due deliberation, or of those missteps  
which proceed from the contagion of some  
common passion or interest.”
