My Dear SirN. York Sunday Evening [20 July 1788]  
Yours of yesterday is this instant come to hand &amp; I have but a few minutes to answer it. I am sorry that your situation obliges you to listen to propositions of the nature you describe. My opinion is that a reservation of a right to withdraw if amendments be not decided on under the form of the Constitution within a certain time, is a conditional ratification, that it does not make N. York a member of the New Union, and consequently that she could not be received on that plan. Compacts must be reciprocal, this principle would not in such a case be preserved. The Constitution requires an adoption in toto, and for ever. It has been so adopted by the other States. An adoption for a limited time would be as defective as an adoption of some of the articles only. In short any condition whatever must viciate the ratification. What the New Congress by virtue of the power to admit new States, may be able &amp; disposed to do in such case, I do not enquire as I suppose that is not the material point at present. I have not a moment to add more than my fervent wishes for your success &amp; happiness  
Js. Madison  
This idea of reserving right to withdraw was started at Richmd. &amp; considered as a conditional ratification which was itself considered as worse than a rejection.

There is no douht he referred to the pro­  
position of Mr. Lansing.The reply of  
Mr. Madison is clear and emphatic. &quot;My  
opinion,&quot; said he, &quot;is, that a reservation  
of a right to withdraw if amendments be  
not decided on, under the form of the  
Constitution, within a certain time, is a  
conditional ratification, that it does not  
make New York a memher of the New  
Union, and consequently that she could  
not be received on that plan. Compacts  
must be reeiprocalt this principle would  
not in such a case be preserved. The  
Constitution requires an adoption in toto,  
and forever. It has been so adopted by  
the other States. An adoption for a limit­  
ed time would be as defective, as an adop  
tion of some of the articles only. In short,  
any condition whatever must vitiare the  
ratification. What the new Congress, un  
der the power to admit new States, may  
be able and disposed to do in such a case,  
I do not inquire, as it is not the materiol  
point at present. The idea of reserving a  
right to withdraw was started at Rich­  
mond and considered as a conditional ra­  
tification, which was itself abandoned as  
worse than a rejection!

perfect Union&quot; was recorded in the Constitution  
law, order and peace in inseparable Union: dis­  
order, anarchy and revolution in its abandon­  
ment and destruction. This idea was prominent­  
ly brought forward by the venerated Madison,  
when he wrote Hamilton:  
&quot;My oninion is, that a reservation of a right to

For, in a letter to Mr. Hamilton, at the time  
of the holding of conventions in New York  
and Virginia for the adoption of the constitu­  
tion, Mr. Madison said :  
My opinion is, that a reservation of a right  
to withdraw, if amendments be not decidod  
on under the form of the constitution), within  
a certain time, is a condit ional ratification ;  
that it does not make New York a moinber ot  
the new Union, and consequently that she  
could not be received on that plan. Compacts  
must be reciprocal ; this principle would not  
in such a case be preserved. Trie constitution  
requires an adoption in toto and forever. It  
has been so adopted by the other States. An.  
adoption for a limited time would be as defec­  
tive as an adoption of some of the articles only.  
In short any condition whatever must vitiate  
the ratification. What the next Congress, by  
virtue of the power to admit new States, may  
be able and disposed to do in such case, I do  
not inquire, as I suppose that it is not the ma­  
terial point at present. I have not a moment  
add more than my fervent wishes for your  
success and happiness. The idea of reserving  
a right to withdraw was started at Richmond,

&quot;My opinion is that a reservation of a  
right to withdraw, if amendments be not  
decided on under the form of the Constitu­  
tion within a certain time, is a conditional  
ratification; that it does not make New York  
a member of the new Union; and cor sequent­

principle would not in such a case be pre­  
served. The constitution requires an adop­  
tion in toto and forever.&quot;  
  
It the right was reserved to each State  
to withdraw, it would have been an act of  
supererogation on the part of New York,  
or any other State, to declare, in advance,  
that she would withdraw or secede if the  
amendments she proposed to the constitu­  
tion were not adopted. If the right existed,  
it could be exercised as well without as  
with the condition annexed to her ratifica­  
tion of the Constitution, and the assertion of  
it would have been a useless interpolation  
and a nullity. It was not so regarded,  
however, at the time, by those who have  
been active participants in the framing of  
the Constitution. Mr. Madison considered  
the reservation of a right to withdraw from  
the Union as &quot;a condition that would vitiate  
the ratification.&quot; He says further in wri  
ting to Mr. Hamilton on this subject: &quot;The  
iden of resereing a right to withdran was  
started at Richmond, and considered as a  
conditional ratification, which was itselfa­  
baxdoned as worse than a rejection.

vention. Mr. Hamilton wrote to Mr. Madison on this very  
point, and received for reply these memorable words: “ The  
reservation of a right to withdraw is a conditional ratification.  
It does not make New York a member of the new Union, and  
consequently she could not be received on that plan. The  
Constitution requires an adoption in toto, and for ever. It has  
been so adopted by the other States.”  
  
But it is alleged that the States, being sovereign, have a  
right to decide upon an alleged violation of the Constitution

with tho right reserved to withdraw. Mr. Hamil­  
ton wrote to Mr. Madison for his opinion on .the  
subject : It is well to remember that! Mrj .Madison  
is called i &quot; the father of tbe constitution&quot; and to  
note well his reply. It is as follows :; I  
&quot; My opinion is&#x27; that a reservation jof a&#x27;right o  
withdraw, if amendments be not decided on under  
the form of the constitution, is a conditional ratifi-  
catiotij that it doe3 not make New York a l member  
of the Union ; and consequently that sjbe wuld riot  
be received on that plan. Compacts ijiust e recip­

‘*requires an adoption in toto and forever.  
It has been so adopted by the other States. An  
adoption for a limited time would be as defec-  
tive as an adoption of some of the articles

the friends and of the enemies of the Constitu-
