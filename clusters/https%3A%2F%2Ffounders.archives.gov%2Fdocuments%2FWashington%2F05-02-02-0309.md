Gentlemen,  
[New York, May 1789]  
  
I request that you will accept my best acknowledgments for your congratulation on my appointment to the first office in the nation. The kind manner in which you mention my past conduct equally claims the expression of my gratitude.  
After we had, by the smiles of Heaven on our exertions, obtained the object for which we contended, I retired at the conclusion of the war, with an idea that my country could have no farther occasion for my services, and with the intention of never entering again into public life: But when the exigence of my country seemed to require me once more to engage in public affairs, an honest conviction of duty superseded my former  
  
resolution, and became my apology for deviating from the happy plan which I had adopted.  
If I could have entertained the slightest apprehension that the Constitution framed in the Convention, where I had the honor to preside, might possibly endanger the religious rights of any ecclesiastical Society, certainly I would never have placed my signature to it; and if I could now conceive that the general Government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution—For you, doubtless, remember that I have often expressed my sentiment, that every man, conducting himself as a good citizen, and being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to be protected in worshipping the Deity according to the dictates of his own conscience.  
While I recollect with satisfaction that the religious Society of which you are Members, have been, throughout America, uniformly, and almost unanimously, the firm friends to civil liberty, and the persevering Promoters of our glorious revolution; I cannot hesitate to believe that they will be the faithful Supporters of a free, yet efficient general Government. Under this pleasing expectation I rejoice to assure them that they may rely on my best wishes and endeavors to advance their prosperity.  
In the meantime be assured, Gentlemen, that I entertain a proper sense of your fervent supplications to God for my temporal and eternal happiness.  
  
G. Washington

your congratulation on my appointment  
to the first office in the nation; and the  
kind manner in which you mention my  
past conduct equally claims the expres­  
sion of my gratitude.  
Alter we had, by the smiles of Di  
vine Providence on our exertions, ob­  
tained the object for which we conten  
ded, I retired at the conclusion of the  
war, with an idea that my country  
could have no further occasion for my  
services, and with the intention of ney  
er entering again into public life; but,  
when the exigencies of my country  
seemed to require me once more to en  
gage in public affairs, an honest con  
viction of duty superseded my former  
resolntions, and became my apology  
for deviating from the happy plan  
which I had adopted. If I could have  
entertained the slightest apprehensions,  
that the constitution framed in the con­  
vention where I had the honor to pre-  
side migut possibly endangenthe re­  
LIiOus riGhts oF AnY eCLeSIAst­  
CAl society, certainly I would  
Never HAVE PLACEd MY SIGNATUre to  
ir; and if I could now conceive that  
the general government might ever be  
so administered as to render the liberty  
of conscience insecure, I beg you will  
be persuaded that no one would be  
more zealous than myself to establish  
effectual barriers against the horrors of  
spiritual tyranny and every species of  
religious persecution, for you doubtless  
remember I have often expressed my  
sentiments that every man, conducting  
himself as a citizen, and being accoun  
table to God alone for his religious  
opinions, ought to be protected in wor  
shipping the Deity according to the  
dictates of his own conscience.  
&quot;While I recolect with satisfaction  
that the religious society of which you  
are members have been throughout  
America uniformly and almost unanis  
mously the firm friends th civil liberty  
and the persevering promoters of our  
glorious revolution, I cannot besitate  
to believe that they will be the faithful  
supporters of a free yet efficient general  
  
tlemen, that I entertain a proper sense  
ee e   o  
Of yollt lervent supiiiicatiols to t0

pectation, I rejoice to assure them that  
may rely upon my best wishes

&quot;Gkntlkmkn—I request that you will  
accept my best acknowledgments for youi  
congratulations on my appointment to the  
first office m the nation. The kind man­  
ner in whioh you mention my past  
conduct e qually claims tb^ expression of  
my gratitude.  
‘‘After we bad, by the smiles of Divina  
Providence on our exertions, obtained^B  
contended. I  
at tho war, with  
that my country would have no further  
occasion for my servioes, and with the in­  
tention of never agaiu entering into publio  
jife. Rut when the exigencies of my coun­  
try seemed to require me once more to en­  
gage in public affairs, an honest convietion  
of duty superseded my former resolution,  
and became my apology for deviating  
from the happy plan whioh I had  
adopted.  
“If I could have entertained the slight­  
est apprehension that the Constitution  
planned by the Convention where I had  
the honor to preside might possibly en­  
danger the religious rights of any Eoole  
shstioal Society, certainly I never would  
have placed my signature to it; and If I  
could now conceive that the General Gov­  
ernment might ever be so administered as  
to render the liberty of conscience inse­  
cure, I beg you will be persuaded that no  
one would be more zealous than myself to  
establish effectual barriers against the hor­  
rors of spiritual tyranny and every species  
of religious persecution.  
“You doubtless remember, for I have  
often expressed my sentiments, that every  
man conducting himself as a good citi­  
zen, and being aooountable to God alone  
for bis religious opinions, ought to be pro­  
tected in worshipping the Deity according  
to the dictates of his own conscience.  
Whilst I recollect with satisfaction that  
the religious society of whioh you are  
members has been, throughout America,  
uniformly and almost unanimously, the  
firm friends of oivil liberty, and the per­  
severing promoters of our religious revo­  
lution, &lt;1 cannot hesitate to believe that  
they will be faithful supporters of a free,  
yet efficient General Government  
“Under this pleasing expectation I re­  
joice to assure them that they may rely  
upon my best wishes and endeavors to ad­  
vance their prosperity. In the meantime  
be assured, gentlemen, that I entertain  
a proper sense of your fervent supplies  
tions to God for my temporal and eternal  
happiness.”
