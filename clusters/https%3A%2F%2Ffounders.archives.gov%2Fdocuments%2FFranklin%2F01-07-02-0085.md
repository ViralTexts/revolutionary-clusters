he Continuance of Peace, Love, and affectionate Performance of mutual Duties to their Lives End. But if any Dispute should arise among them, or between them or any of them and my Executors, relating to my Estate or any Part thereof, or to the Intention of this my Will in any [res]pect, I would have the same submitted to the Determination of my said three Friends, and that their Determination be final.  
And now humbly returning sincere Thanks to God, for producing me into Being, and conducting me hitherto thro’ Life so happily, so free from Sickness, Pain and Trouble, and with such a Competency of this World’s Goods as might make a reasonable Mind easy; that he was pleased to give me such a Mind, with moderate Passions, or so much of his gracious Assistance in Governing them; and to free it early from Ambition, Avarice and Superstition, common Causes of much Uneasiness to Men: That he gave me to live so long in a Land of Liberty, with a People that I love; and rais’d me, tho’ a Stranger, so many Friends among them; bestowing on me, moreover, a loving and prudent Wife and dutiful Children: For these, and all his other innumerable Mercies and Favours, I bless that Being of Beings who does not disdain to care for the meanest of his Creatures. And I reflect on those Benefits received, with the greater Satisfaction, as they give me such a Confidence in his Goodness, as will, I hope, enable me always in all Things to submit freely to his Will, and to resign my Spirit chearfully into his Hands, whenever he shall please to call for it; reposing my self securely in the Lap of God and Nature, as a Child in the Arms of an affectionate Parent.  
B Franklin [seal]  
  
  
  
Signed, sealed published and declared by the said Benjamin Franklin, as and for his last Will and Testament, in the Presence of us.
