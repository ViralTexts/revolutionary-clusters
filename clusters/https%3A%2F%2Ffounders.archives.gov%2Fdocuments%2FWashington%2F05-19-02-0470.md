⟨My dear Nelly,  
Philadelphia 21st Mar. 1796  
  
In one respect, I have complied fully with my promise to you, in another I have deviated from it in a small degree. I have given you letter for letter, but not with the promptitude I intended; your last of the 29th ult. having lain by me several days unacknowledged. This, however might reasonably have been expected from the multiplicity of my⟩ business.  
Your letter, the receipt of which I am now acknowledging, is written correctly, and in fair characters; which is an evidence that you command, when you please, a fair hand. Possessed of these advantages, it will be your own fault if you do not avail yourself of them: and attention being paid to the choice of your subjects, you can have nothing to fear from the malignancy of criticism, as your ideas are lively, and your descriptions agreeable.

is is the time to form your character, improve your diction.  
  
This much by way of advice and⟩ admonition. Let me touch a little now, on your George Town Ball; and happy, thrice happy for the fair who were assembled on the occasion, that there was a man to spare; for had there been seventy nine Ladies &amp; only seventy eight Gentlemen, there might, in the course of the evening, have been some disorder among the caps; notwithstanding the apathy which one of the company entertains for the “youth of the present day, and her determination never to give herself a moments uneasiness on account of any of them.” A hint here; Men and Women feel the same inclinations towards ⟨each other now that they always have done, and which they will continue to do until there is a new order of things. And you, as others have done, may find perhaps, that the passions of your sex are easier roused than allayed. Do not therefore boast too soon, nor too strongly, of your insensibility to, or resistance of its powers.  
In the composition of the human frame there is a good deal of inflaminable matter; however dormant it may be for a while, and like an intimate acquaintance of yours, when the torch is put to it, that which is within you may burst into a blaze; for which reason, and especially too, as I have entered on the chapter of advices I will read you a lecture drawn from this text.  
Love is said to be an involuntary passion and it is therefore contended that it cannot be resisted. This is true, in part only; for like all things else when nourished and supplied plentifully with [aliment,] it is rapid in its progress; but let these be withdrawn and it may be stifled in its birth or much stunted in its growth.  
For example—a woman (the same with the other sex) all beautiful &amp; accomplished will, while her hand &amp; heart are [undisposed] of[, turn] the heads, and set the Circle in which [she moves on fire].  
Let her marry, and what is the consequence? The madness ceases and all is quiet again: Why? not because there is any diminuation in the charm of the lady but because there is an end of hope. Hence it follows that love may and therefore that it ought to be under the guidance of reason. For although we cannot avoid first impressions, we may assuredly place them under guard; and my motives in treating on this subject are to show you “whilst you remain Eleanor [Parke] Custis [Spinster], and retain the resolution to love with moderation” the propriety of  
  
adhering to the latter; at least until you have secured your game, and the way by which it is to be accomplished.  
When the fire is beginning to kindle, and your heart growing warm, propound these questions to it. Who is this invader? Have I competent knowledge of him? Is he a man of good character? A man of sense? for be assured a sensible woman can never be happy with a fool. What has been his walk in life? Is he a gambler? a spendthrift, a drunkard? Is his fortune sufficient to maintain me in the manner I have been accustomed to live, and my sisters do live? and is he one to whom my friends can have no reasonable objections? If these interogations can be satisfactorily answered there will remain but one more to be asked; that however is an important one. Have I sufficient ground to conclude that his affections are enjoyed by me? Without this, the heart of sensibility will struggle against a passion that is not reciprocated; delicacy, custom, or call it by what epithet you will having precluded all advances on your part, the declaration without the most indirect invitation on yours must proceed from the man to render it permanent &amp; valuable. And nothing short of good sense, and an easy unaffected conduct can draw the line between prudery &amp; coquetry; both of which are equally despised by men of understanding; and soon or late, will recoil upon the actor.  
Flirting is hardly a degree removed from the latter and both are punished by the counter game of men, who see this the case &amp; act accordingly. In a word it would be no great departure from truth to say that it rarely happens otherwise, than that a thorough coquette dies in celibacy, as a punishment for her attempts [to] mislead others; by encouraging looks, words, or actions, given for no other purpose than to draw men on to make overtures that may be rejected.  
This day according to our information gives a husband to your dear sister; and [consummates], it is presumed her fondest desires.  
The dawn (with us) is bright, and propitious I hope, of her future happiness; for a full measure of which she and Mr. Law have my earnest wishes. Compliments &amp; congratulations on this occasion, and best regards are presented to your Mama, Dr. Stuart &amp; family, and every blessing, among which a good  
  
husband when you want, &amp; deserve one, is bestowed on you by Your affectionate⟩  
  
Go: Washingto

&quot;Love is said to be an involuntary pas­  
sion, and it is therefore, contended that it  
cannot be resisted. This is true in part  
only for like all things else, when nourished  
and supplied plentifully with aliment, it is  
rapid in its progress; but let these be with­  
drawn and it may be stified in its birth or  
much stinted in its growth. For example,  
a woman, (the same may be said of the  
other sex) all beautiful and accomplished  
will, while her hand and heart are undis­  
posed of, turn the heads and set the circle  
around on fire. Let her marry, and  
what is the consequence? The madness  
ccases, and all quict again. Why? Not  
because there is any diminution in the  
charms of the lady, but becauze there is an  
end of hope. Hence it follows that love  
may, and therefore ought to be, under the  
guidance of reason; for although we can­  
not avoid first impressions, we may as­  
suredly place them under guard; and my  
motives for treating on the subject are to  
show you--while you remain Eleanor  
Parke Custis, spinster, and retain the res­  
olution to love with moderation--the pro­  
priety of adhering to the latter resolutions,  
at least until you have secured your game  
and the way by which it may be accom-  
plished.  
&quot;When the fire is beginning to kindle  
and your heart growing warm, propound  
these questions to it: Who is invader?  
Have I a competent knowledge of him  
O  
Is he a man of good character, a man of  
sense! For, be assured, a sensible wo­  
man can never be happy with a fool.  
What has been his walk of life? Is he a  
gambler, a spendthrift, or a drunkard?  
Is his fortune sufficient to maintain me in  
the manner I have been accustomed to live  
and my sisters do live, and is he one to  
whom my friends can have no reasonable  
objection? If these interrogations can be  
satisfactorily answered, there will remain  
but one more to be asked. That however  
is an important one: Have I sufficient  
ground to conclude that his affections are  
engaged by me! Without this the heart  
of sensibility will struggle against a pass  
ion that is not reciprocated--delicacy, cus  
tom, or eall it by what epithet you will,  
having precluded all advances on your  
part. The declaration, without the most  
indirect invitation of yours, must procced  
from the man to render it permanent and  
valuable; and nothing short of good sense  
and an easy unaffected conduct can draw  
the line between prudury and coquetry.  
It would be no great departure from the  
truth to say that it rarely happens other  
wise than that a thorough-placed coquette  
dies in celibacy, as a punishment for her  
attempts to mislead others, by encouraging  
looks, words, or actions given for no other  
purpose than to draw men on to make  
overtures that they may be rejected.

PRESIDENT WASHINGTON.  
Written to His Neice Nellle Custis and  
DiscuSSing LOvE.  
ICopied from the MS, in the possession of the  
late Mrs. Gena R. E. Lee, and published in the  
Philadelphia Weekly Times.)  
WASHINGTON ON &quot;LOVE.&quot;  
PHILADELPHIA, January 16, 1795.  
Your letter, the receipt of which I am now  
acknowledging, is written correctly and in  
fair characters, which is an evidence that  
you command, when you please, a fair hand.  
Possessed of these advantages, it will be  
your fault if you do not avail yourself of  
them, and attention being paid to the choice  
of your subjects, you can have nothing to  
fear from the malignancy of criticism, as  
your ideas are lively and your discriptions  
agreeaDle.  
Let me touch a little now on your George­  
town ball, and happy, thrice happy, for the  
fair who were assembled on the occasion, that  
there was a man to spare; for had there been  
seventy-nine ladies and only seventy-eight  
gentlemen, there might, in the course of the  
evening, have been some disorder among the  
caps; notwithstanding the apathy which one  
of the company entertains for the &quot;youth&quot; of  
the present day, and her determination  
&quot;never to give herself a moment&#x27;s uneasiness  
on account of any of them,&quot; a hint here;  
men and women feel the same inclination to  
each other now that they have always done,  
and which they will do until there is a  
new order of things, and you, as others  
have done, may find, perhaps, that the pas­  
sions of your sex are easier raised than  
allayed. Do not, therefore, boast too soon or  
too strongly of your insensibility to or resist­  
ance of its powers. In the composition of the  
human frame there is a good deal of in­  
flammable matter, however dormant it may  
lie for a time; and, like an intimate acquaint­  
ance of yours (a sister just married) when  
the torch is put to it, that which is within you  
may burst into a blaze; for which reason,  
and especially, too, as I have entered upon  
the chapter of advices, I will read you a lec­  
ture drawn from this text.  
  
Love is said to be an involuntary passion,  
and it is, therefore, contended that it cannot  
be resisted. This is true in part only, for,  
like all things else, when nourished and sup­  
plied plentifully with aliment it is rapid in  
its progress; but let these be withdrawn and  
it may be stifled in its birth or much stifled  
in its growth. For example, a woman (the  
same may be said of the other sex) all beauti­  
ful and accomplished, will, while her hand  
is undisposed of, turn the head and set the  
circle in which she moves on fire. Let her  
marry and what is the consequence? The  
madness ceases and all is quiet again. Why?  
Not because there is any diminution in the  
charms of the lady, but because there is  
an end of hope. Hence, it follows that love  
may, and therefore ought to be, under the  
guidance of reason, for although we cannot  
avoid impressions, we may assuredly place  
them under guard; and my motives for treat­  
ing on this subject are to show you; while  
you remain Eleanor Parke Custis, spinster,  
and retain the resolution to love with mode­  
ration, the propriety of adhering to the latter  
resolution, at least until you have secured  
your game, and the way by which it may be  
accomplished. When the fire is beginning to  
kindle and your heart grows warm, propound  
these questions to it: Who is the invader?  
Have I competent knowledge of him? Is he  
a man of good character, a man of sense?  
For, be assured, a sensible woman can  
never be happy with a fool. What has been  
his walk in life? Is he a gambler, a spend­  
thrift or drunkard? Is his fortune sufficient  
to maintain me in the manner I have been ac­  
customed to live and my sisters do live? And  
is he one to whom my friends can have no  
reasonable objection? If these interrogatorles  
can be satisfactorily answered there will re­  
main but one more to be asked. That, how­  
ever, is an important one. Have I sufficient  
ground to conclude that his affections are en­  
gaged by me? Without this the heart of sen­  
sibility will struggle against a passion that  
is not reciprocated--delicacy, custom, or call  
it by what epithet you will, having precluded  
all advances on your part.  
The declaration, without the most indirect  
invitation of yours, must proceed from the  
man to render it permanent and valuable,  
and nothing short of good sense and an casy,  
unaffected conduct can draw the line between  
prudery and coquetry. It would be no great  
departure from truth to say that it rarely  
happens otherwise than that a thorough­  
paced coquette dies in celibacy as a punish­  
ment for her attempts to lead others, by  
encouraging looks, words or actions, given  
for no other purpose than to draw men on to  
make overtures that they may be rejected

&quot;PhILADELpHIa, Jan. 16, 1795.- Your  
letter, the receipt of which I am now ac­  
knowledging, is written correctly and in  
fair characters, which is an evidence that  
you command, when you please, a fair  
hand. Possessed of these advantages, it  
will be your own fault if you do not  
avail yourself of them, and attention be­  
ing paid to the choice of your subjects,  
you can have nothing to fear from the  
malignancy of criticism, as your ideas  
are lively and your descriptions agree­  
able me touch a httle now on your  
Georgetown ball, and happy, thrice hap­  
py, for the fair who were assembled on  
the occasion, that there was a man to  
spare; for had there been seventy-nine  
ladies and only seventy-eight gentlemen,  
there might, in the course of the even­  
ing, have been some disorder among the  
caps; notwithstanding the apathy which  
one of the company entertains for the  
youth&#x27; of the present day, and her de­  
termination &quot;never to give herself a mo­  
ment&#x27;s uneasiness on account of any of  
them, a hint here: Men and women  
feel the same inclinations toward each  
other now that they always have done,  
and which they will continue to do until  
there is a new order of things, and you,  
as others have done, may find, perhaps,  
that the passions of your sex are easier  
raised than allayed. Do not, therefore,  
boast too soon or too strongly of your  
insensibility to, or resistance of, its pow  
ers. In the composition of the human  
frame there is a good deal of inflamable  
matter, however dormant it may lie for  
a time, and, like an intimate acquaint­  
ance of yours (a sister just married),  
when the torch is put to it, that which  
is within you may burst into a blaze;  
for which reason, and especially, too, as  
I have entered upon the chapter of ad  
vices, I will read you a lecture drawn  
from this text.  
ove is said to be an involuntary pas  
sion, and it is, therefore, contended that  
it cannot be resisted. This is true in  
part only, for, like all things else, when  
nourished and supplied plentifully with  
aliment, it is rapid in its progress; but  
let these be withdrawn and it may be  
stifled in its birth or much stinted in its  
growth. For example, a woman (the  
same may be said of the other sex), all  
beautiful and accomplished, will, while  
her hand and heart are undisposed of,  
turn the heads and set the circle in  
which she moves on fire. Let her mar-  
ry and all is quiet again. Why? Not  
because there is any diminution in the  
charms of the lady, but because there is  
an end of hope. Hence it follows that  
love may and therefore ought to follow  
the guidance of reason, for although we  
cannot avoid first impressions, we may­  
assuredly place them under guard; and  
my motives for treating on this subject  
are to show you, while you remain  
Eleanor Parke Custis, spinster, and re­  
tain the resolution to love with modera  
tion, the propriety of adhering to the  
latter resolution, at least until you have  
secured your game, and the way by  
which it may be accomplished. When  
the fire is beginning to kindle and your  
heart grows warm propoand these gic  
to it: Who is the invader? Have  
I a competent knowledge of him? I  
he a man of good character, a man of  
sense? For, be assured, a sensible wo­  
man can never be happy with a fool.  
What has been his walk in life? Is he a  
gambler, a spendthrift, or drunkard? Is  
his fortune sufficient to maintain me in  
the manner I have been accustomed to  
live and the way my sisters do live?  
And is he one to whom my friends have  
can have no reasonable objection? If  
these interrogatories can be satisfactori  
ly answered there will be but one more  
to be asked. Have I sufficient ground to  
conclude that his affections are engaged  
by me? Without this the heart of sen  
sibility will struggle against passion that  
is not reciprocated--delicacy, custom, or  
call it by what epithet you will, having  
preciuded all advances on your part.  
&quot;The declaration, without the most in  
direct invitation of yours, must proceed  
from the man to render it permanent  
and valuable, and nothing short of good

Nellie Cnstie was a sweet child aud blos­  
somed into a charming woman. When she  
was sixteen yea&#x27;s of ate she first attended a  
hall at Georgetown, and wrote au animated  
descr ption of it to her foster father, then  
Presdent of tbe United States, tbe seat of gov­  
ernment being in Philadelphia. In her letter  
Nellie made some remark about her indiffer­  
ence to the beaux The letter drew from Wash­  
ington a reply as follows, which I copied from  
the original manuscript, in possession of tbe  
  
late Mrs. Lee, wife of Gen. Hebert L. Lee:  
Philadelphia, January 16, 1793.—Yonr  
letter, the receipt of which I am now acknowl­  
edging, is written c rrecily aud in fair charac­  
ters, which is an evidence that yon command,  
whenyoQ please, a fair hand. Possessed of  
these advantages, it will bs your own fault if  
you do not avail yourself of them, and atten­

you can have nothing lo fear from the malig

heart are uoutspoeed of, turn the beads and  
set the circle in which sho moves on tire. Let  
her mary, and what is ihe consequence? The  
tnadhess ceases and all is quet again. Why?  
Not because there is any diminution in the

the way by which it may be accomplished.  
When the tire is beginning 10 kindle and yoai

Tonr letter, the receipt of which I am  
now acknowledging, is wiitten correctly  
snd in fair characters, which is sn evi­  
dence thit you command, when you  
please, a fair hand. Possessed ot these  
advantages, it will be your own fault if  
yon do not avail yourself of them, and  
attention being paid to the choice of  
your subject, yon can have nothing to  
fear from the malignancy of criticism,  
and your ideas are lively and yonr  
descriptions sgreeable.  
Let me touch a little now on yonr  
Gtorgetowu ball. and happy,  
thrice happy, for the fair who  
were assembled Sn tue 6ccaiou  
. s .  
,u&quot; ,,,ero WM nan lo lor  
&quot;lu8i owu noma uisor  
der smong the caps; notwithstanding  
the apathy which oue of th company  
entertains for the &quot;youth&quot; of the pres­  
ent day, and Iter determination &quot; never  
to give herself a moment&#x27;s uneasiness  
on scconnt of any of them, a hint here:  
Men and women fe-d the same inclina­  
tions to e ch oth r now thai tbey al­  
ways have -lone and which they will con­  
tinue to do anttl there is a new order  
of thing, and you, as others have done,  
may find, perhaps, that the passions of  
your sex sre easier raised than allayed.  
Do not therefore boast too soon or too  
strongly of your insensibility to or re­  
sistance of its powers. In the composi­  
tion of the hnmsn frame there is a good  
d. al of inflammable matter, however  
dormant it may lie for a time, and, like  
! an intimate acquaintance of Tours (s  
aiaier just niarneti), when the toreu is  
j pat to it, that which is within yon may  
burst iuto a blaze; (or which reason,  
and especially, too, as I Lave entered  
upon the chapter of advices, I will  
read you a lecture drawn from this  
text.  
Love is said to be sn involuutary  
passion, aud it is therefore contended  
that it cannot be resisted. This is true  
in part only, for, lika all things else,  
when nourished snd supplied plentiful­  
ly with aliment, it is rapid in its pro­  
gress; but let these be withdrawn aud it  
msy be stifled in its birth or nincb  
stinted in its growth. For ex imple, a  
woman (the same may be said of the  
other sex), all beautiful and accomplish­  
ed, will, while her hand and heirt are  
undisposed of, turn the heads and set  
the circle in which she moves on fire.  
Let her marry, and what ia the conse­  
quence ? The madness cesses and all  
in quiet again. Why ? Not because  
there is any diminution in the charm  
of the lady, but because there is an end  
of hope. Hence it follows that love  
may, and therefore oaght to be, under  
the guidance of reason, for although we  
eannot avoid first impressions, we my  
assuredly place them under gnard; and  
my motivea for treating on this snbject  
are to show yon, while yoa remain  
Eleanor Parke Custis, spioter, and re  
tain the resolution to love with moder­  
ation, the propriety of adhering to the  
latter resolution, at least nnti! yon have  
seen red yonr game, and the way by  
which it may lie accomplished. When  
the fire ia beginning to kindle and jour  
heart grows warm, propound these ques­  
tions to it: Who is the invader? Have  
I competent knowledge of Urn t Is he  
a man &#x27; ot good character, a man of  
sense? Fur be assured a sensible wo­  
man ess never be happy with a fool.  
What has been bis walk In life 7 Is he i  
  
  
MARCH 27, 1879.  
a gambler, a spendthrift, or a drunkard f  
Is his fortune sufficient to maintain me  
in the scanner I have been accustomed  
to live and my sisters do live f And ia  
he one to whom my friends can have  
noieasonable objection? Ii these in  
terrogatories e&amp;n be -satisfactorily an­  
swered, there will remain bat one more  
to be asked. That, however, m an im­  
portant one. Have I sufacient ground  
to conclude that&#x27; bis affections .are en­  
gaged by me 9 Without this the heart  
of sensibility will straggle agairsi a  
passion thai, is not reciprocated deli  
eaey, custom, or call it by what epithet  
yon wi.1, having precluded all advances  
f on yout part.  
The declaration, without the most in­  
direct invitation of yours, most proceed  
from the man to, rcnler it perm men t  
and valuable, and nothing short of  
good reuse and an easy, unaffected con­  
duct can draw the line between pru­  
dery and conqnetry. It would be no  
great dejarture from truth to say that  
it rarely happens otherwise than that a  
thorough-paced coquette dies in celi­  
bacy a a punishment for her attempts to  
mislead others by encouraging looks,  
word, or actions, given for no other  
purose than to draw men on to make  
overtures that they may be rejected.  
Best regards sre presented to your  
mamma. Dr. Stuart and family, and  
every blessiug among which a good  
husband, when you WMnt and deserve  
one is bestowed on you by yours, al­  
fectioustely, G. WASHINGTON

that it cannot be resisted. This is true  
in part only, for, like all things else,  
when nourished and supplied plenti  
fully with aliment, it is rapid in its  
progress; but let these be withdrawn  
and it may be stified in its birth or  
much stinted in its growth. For ex­  
ample, a woman (the same may be said  
of the other sex), all beautiful and ac  
complished, will, while her hand and  
heart are undisposed of, turn the heads  
and set the circle in which she moves  
on fire. Let her marry and what is  
the consequence? The madness ceas  
es and all is quict again. Why? Not  
because there is any diminution in the  
charms of the lady, but because there  
is an end of hope. Hence it follows  
that love may and therefore ought to  
be under the guidance of reason, for  
although we cannot avoid first impres­  
sions, we may assuredly place them un  
der guard; and my motives for treating  
on this subject are to show you, while  
you reman Eleanor Parke Custis,  
spinster, and retain the resolution to  
love with moderation, the propriety of  
adhering to the latter resolution, at  
least until you have secured your game,  
and the way by which it may be accom­  
plished. When the fire is beginning  
to kindle and your heart grows warm,  
propound these questions to it: Who  
is the invader? Have I a competent  
knowledge of him? Is he a man of  
good character, a man of sense? For,  
be assured, a sensible woman can nev­  
er be happy with a fool. What has  
been his walk in life? Is he a gam  
bler, a spendthrift or drunkard? Is his  
fortune sufficient to maintain me in  
the ntanner I have been accustomed to  
live and my sisters do live? And is  
he one to whom my friends can have  
no reasonable objection? If these in­  
terrogatories can be satisfactorily an­  
swered there will remain but one more  
to be answered. That, however, is an  
important one. Have I sufficient  
ground to conclude that his affections  
are engaged by me? Without this the  
heart of sensibility will struggle  
against a passion that is not recipro­  
cated--delicacy, custom, or call it by  
what epithet you will, having pre­  
cluded all advances on your part.  
The declaration, without the most  
direct invitation of yours, must pro­  
ceed from the man to render it per­  
manent and valuable, and nothing  
short of good sense and an easy, unaf­  
fected conduct can draw the line be­  
tween prudery and coquetry. It would  
be no great departure from truth to  
say that it rarely happens otherwise  
than that a thorough-paced coquette  
dies in celibacy as a punishment for  
her attempts to mislead others by en­  
couraging looks, words or actions,  
given for no other purpose than to  
draw men on to make overtures that  
they may be rejected.  
Best regards are presented to your  
mamma, Dr. Stuart and family, and  
every blessing, among which a good  
husband, when you want and deserve  
one is bestowed on you by  
Yours, affectionately,

children of Gen.  
Washington.  
Nelly Custis was a sweet child, and  
blossomed into a charming woman.  
When she was 16 years of age she at­  
tended a ball at Georgetown, and wrote  
an animated description of it to her  
foster-father, then President of the  
United States, the seat of Government  
being in Philadelphia. In her letter  
Nelly made some remark about her in­  
difference to the beaux. This letter  
drew from Washington a reply as fol­  
lows, which I copied from the original  
manuscript in possession of the late Mrs.  
Lee, wife of Gen. Robert E Lee:  
WASHINGTON ON “ LOVE.”  
“Philadelphia, Jan. 16, 1795.—  
Your letter, the receipt of which I am  
now acknowledging, is written correct­  
ly and in fair characters, which is an  
evidence that you command, when yon  
please, a fair hand. Possessed of these  
advantages, it will be your own fault if  
you do not avail yourself of them, and  
attention being paid to the choice of  
your subjects, you can have nothing to  
fear from the malignancy of criticism,  
as your ideas are lively and your de­  
scriptions agreeable.  
“ Let me touch a little now on your  
Georgetown ball, and happy, thrice  
happy, lor the fair who were assembled  
on the occasion, that there was a man  
to spare; for had there been seventy­  
nine ladies and only seventy-eight gen­  
tlemen, there might, in the course of  
the evening, have been some disorder  
among the caps; notwithstanding the  
apathy which one of the company en­  
tertains for the ‘ youth’ of the present  
day, and her determination ‘ never to  
give herself a moment’s uneasiness on  
account of any of them,’ a hint here:  
Men and women feel the same inclina­  
tions to each other now that they al­  
ways have done, and which they will  
continue to do until there is a new or­  
der of things, and you, as others have  
done, may rind, perhaps, that the pas­  
sions of your sex are easier raised than  
allayed. Do not, therefore, boast too  
soon or too strongly of your insensibil­  
ity to, or resistance of, its powers. In  
the composition of the human frame  
there is a good deal of inflammable  
  
matter, however dormant it may lie for t  
a time, and, like an intimate acquaint- s  
ance of yours (a sister just married),  
when the torch is put to it, that which 8  
is within you may burst into a olaze, f  
for which reason, and especially, too,

he gives her the following advice on the  
subject of love:  
&quot;Men and women feel the same inclina­  
tion to each other now that they always  
have done, and which they will continue  
to do until there is a new order of things,  
and you, as others have done, may find per­  
haps that the passions of your sex are easier  
raised than allaved. Do not, therefore.  
boast too soon or too strongly of your insen  
sibility to or resistance of its powers. In  
the composition of the human frame there  
is a good deal of inflammatory matter, how­  
ever dormant it may be for a time, and,  
like an intimate acquaintaintance of yours  
(a sister just married), when the torch is  
put to it, that which is within you may  
burst into a blaze; for which reason, and  
especially, too, as I have entered upon the  
chapter of advices, I will read you a lec­  
ture drawn from this text.  
&quot;Love is said to be an involuntary pas  
sion, and it is therefore contended that it  
cannot be resisted. This is true in part only,  
for, like all things else, when nourished  
and supplied plentifully with aliment, it is  
rapid in its progress; but let these be with­  
drawn and it may be stifled in its birth or  
much stinted in its growth. For example,  
a woman (the same may be said of the  
other sex) all beautiful and accomplished,  
will, while her hand and heart are undis­  
posed of, turn the heads and set the circle in  
which she moves on fire. Let her marry,  
and what is the consequence? The mad­  
ness ceases, and all is quiet again. Why?  
Not breause there is any diminution in the  
charms of the lady, but because there is an  
end of hope. Hence it follows that love  
may and therefore ought to be under th  
guidance of reason; for although we can-  
not avoid first impressions, we may as­  
suredly place them under guard; and my  
motives for treating on this subject are to  
show you, while you remain Eleanor Parke  
Custis, spinster, and retain the resolution to  
love with moderation, the propriety of ad­  
hering to the latter resolution, at least until  
you have secured your game and the way by  
which it may be accomplished.  
&quot;When the fire is beginning to kindle and  
your heart grows warm propound these  
questions to it: Who is the invader? Have  
I a competent knowledge of him? Is he a  
man of good character, a man of sense?  
For, be assured, a sensible woman can never  
be happy with a fool. What has been his  
walk in life; is he a gambler, a spendthrift  
or a drnnkard? Is his fortune sufficient  
to maintain me in the manner I have been  
accustomed to live and my sisters do live?  
And is he one to whom my friends can have  
no reasonable objection? If these interrog­  
atories can be satisfactorily answered there  
will remain but one more to be asked. That  
however, is an important one. Have I suffi­  
cient ground to conclude that his affections  
are engaged by me? Without this the heart  
of sensibility will struggle against a passion  
that is not reciprocated- delicacy, custom,  
or call it by what epithet you will, having  
procluded all advances on your part.  
&quot;The declaration, without the most ind&#x27;­  
rect invitation of yours, must proceed from  
the man to render it permanent and valua­  
ble, and nothing short of good sense and an  
easy, unaffected conduct can draw the line  
between prudery and coquetry. It would  
be no great departure from truth to say that  
it rarely happens otherwise than that a tho  
rough-placed coquette dies in celibacy as a  
pun ishment for her attempts to mislead  
others, by encouraging looks, words, or ac­  
tion, given for no other purpose than to  
draw men on to make overtures that they  
may be rejected.&quot;

Philadelphia, Jan. 16,1794—Your let

fair characters, which is an evidence tha*  
you command, when you please, a fair

Let me touch a little now on your George­

“Men and women feel the same in­  
clination to each other now that  
they always have douc, and which  
they will continue to do until there is  
a new order of things, and you, as  
others have done, may iind perhaps  
that the passions of your sex are  
easier raised than allayed. I)o not,  
therefore, boast too soon or too  
strougiy of your insensibility to, or  
resistance of its powers. In the com­  
position of a human frame there is a  
good deal of inflammable matter,  
however dormant it may lie for a  
time, and like an intimate acquain­  
tance of yours (a sister just married,)  
when the torch is put to it that which  
is within yon may burst into a blaze;  
lor which re^isou, and especially, too,  
as I have entered upon the chapter  
of advice, I will read you a lecture  
drawn from this text.  
“Love is said to be an involuntary  
passion, and it is contended cannot  
be resisted. This is true in part only,  
for, like all things.else, when nour  
ished aud supplied plentifully with  
aliment, it is rapid iu its progress ;—  
let these be withdrawn aud it may be  
stifled in its birth or much stunted  
iu its growth. For example, a wo­  
man (the same may be said of the  
other sex) all beautiful and ac­  
complished, will, while her hand and  
heart are undisposed of, turn the  
bead and set the circle in which she  
moves ou lire. Let her marry, aud  
what is the consequence I The mad­  
ness ceases and all is quiet again.  
Why? Not because there is any di­  
minution in the charms of the lady,  
but because there is an end of hope.  
Ueuce it follows that love may and  
therefore ought to be under the guid­  
ance of reason ; for although we can­  
not avoid first impressions, we may  
assuredly place them under guard;  
and my motives for treating ou tins  
subject are to show that while you  
retain (he resolution to love with  
moderation, the property of holding  
to the latter resolution, at least until  
yon have secured yonr game and  
the way by which it may be accom­  
plished.  
  
‘‘When the fire is beginning to  
kindle and your heart grows warm  
propound these questions to it: Who  
is the invader 1 Have I a compe.

of good character, a man of sense I  
For be assured, a sensible woman can  
never be happy with a fool. What  
has been his walk iu life I Is he a  
gambler, a spendthrift or drunkard t  
Is his fortune sufficient to maintain  
me in the manner I have been accus  
tomed to live and my sisters do live f  
And is he one to whom my friends  
can have no reasonable objection T If  
these interrogatories can be satisfac­  
torily answered there will remain but  
one to be asked. That, however, is  
an important one. Have I sufficient  
ground to conclude that bis affections  
are engaged by met Without this  
the heart of sensibility will struggle  
against a passion that is not recipro­  
cated—delicacy, custom, or oall it by  
what epithet you will, have precluded  
all advances on your part.  
“The declaration, without the most  
indirect invitation of yours, must pro­  
ceed from the man to render it per­  
manent and valuable, and nothing  
short of good sense and an easy, un­  
affected conduct can draw the line

would be no great departure from  
truth to say that it rarely happens  
otherwise thau that a thorough paced  
coqnette dies in celibacy as a punish­  
ment for her attempts to mislead

Curtis his foster daughter. &quot;In  
the composition of the human  
frame there is a good deal of im­  
flammable matter, which, when  
the torch is put to it, may burst  
into a fiame. Love is said to be  
an involuntary passion, and it is  
therefore conteneed that it can­  
not be resisted. This is true in  
part only, for, like all things else,  
when nourished and supplanted  
plentifully with aliment, it is rap­  
id in its progress; but let these  
be withdrawn and it may be stif­  
led in its birth or much stunted  
in its growth. For example; A  
woman(the same may be said of  
the other sex,) all beautiful and  
accomplished, will, while her  
hand and heart are undisposed of,  
turn the heads and set the circle  
in which she moves on fire.  
Let her marry, and what is the  
consequence ? &#x27; The madness ceas­  
es and all is quiet again. Why?  
Not because there is any diminu­  
tion of charm in the lady, but be­  
cause there is an end of hope.  
Hence it follows that love may,  
and therefore ought to be und er  
the guidance of reason; for al­  
though we cannot avoid first im­  
pressions, we .may assuredly  
place them under guard, and my  
motives for treating on this sub­  
ject are to show, you that while  
  
you remain Nelly Parke Curtis

to love with moderation, the pn,.  
prietyof adhering to the latter  
resolution, at least until you  
  
have secured your game or Xv  
way by which it may be aceon,.  
plished.  
When the tire is beginning to  
kindle and your heart growing  
warm, propound these questions  
to it: Who is this invader Kuf  
I a competent knowledge of li&#x27;m,?  
Is he a man of good&#x27; character, a

py with a fool. &#x27; What lias beeii  
his walk in life? Is he a ftambkr,

his fortune sufficient to majntnin  
me in the manner I have, been ac:

my friends can have no reasona­  
ble objection? If these interrog

swered, there will remain but one  
  
more to be asked ; that, however  
is a n Import ant one: Have I suffi­  
cient ground to conclude that  
his affections are &quot; engaged by  
me? Without this the heart of  
sensibility will struggle against  
a passion that is not reciprocated;  
delicacy, custom, .or call it by  
what epithet you will, having pre­  
cluded all advances on your part.  
The declaration, without the most  
indirect invitation of yours, must  
proceed from the man to render  
it permanent and valuable, and  
nothing short of good sense and  
an easy, unaffected conduct can  
dra w the line between prudery  
and coquetry.&#x27;&#x27;
