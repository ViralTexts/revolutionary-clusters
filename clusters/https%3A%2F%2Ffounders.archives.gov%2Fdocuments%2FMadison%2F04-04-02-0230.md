 the other, and the whole closed; so that the convention should be entirely silent with regard to the respective claims: or, they proposed, to stipulate expressly for the spoliation claims, and also expressly for the claims due to France from the United States. But the Envoys declined both propositions; and then, at their instance, the following article was introduced into the Convention:  
“Article 2d. The Ministers plenipotentiary of the two parties not being able to agree at present respecting the treaty of alliance of 6th. Feby, 1778, the treaty of Amity and Commerce of the same date, and the  
  
Convention of 14th. Nov 1788, nor upon the indemnities mutually due or claimed; the parties will negotiate further on these subjects at a more convenient time, and until they may have agreed upon these points, the said treaties and convention shall have no operation, and the relations of the two Countries shall be regulated as follows.”  
The French government ratified the Convention with said article. The Senate of the United States, voluntarily and unconditionally, struck out said article. The First Consul ratified the Convention as amended, by adding to his ratification the following condition, “provided that by this retrenchment the two states renounce the respective pretensions which are the object of the said article.” And President Jefferson ratified the Convention finally, in the following words:  
“Which ratifications were duly exchanged at Paris, on the 31st. day of July, in the present year; and having been so exchanged were again submitted to the Senate of the United States, who, on the 19th. day of the present month, resolved that they considered the said Convention as fully ratified, and returned the same to the president for the usual promulgation. Now, therefore, &amp;ce.—dated 21st. Dec 1801.” Signed Thomas Jefferson.  
The ratification of the Convention in its original form by France, was a full recognition of the existence of the claims, and a direct obligation on France to negotiate and pay them. The claiming Merchants were entitled to the whole benefit of this stipulation (as we allege); but the

In soliciting the opinion of those Statesmen who are removed from all party, political or pecuniary considerations, you are approached as one of the Fathers in whom we have a right to appeal.  
The principal objections that have been urged against the claims, I ought not to pass over. They are, first, that Congress, in 1798, solemnly declared that the treaties with France were no longer obligatory on the United States: and second, that, subsequently to the dep

from Italy the negotiations were renewed ;  
but the best attainable result upon the ques-  
tion of*claims was that the “ indemnities  
mutually due or claimed” should be the sub-  
ject of further negotiation at a convenient

France, but not by the United States, which

The treaty was sent to the Senate of  
the United States, Article 2, given  
above, struck out by that body, ratified  
with this amendment, and returned to  
France for ratification by that nation.  
Bonaparte ratified the amended treaty,  
but accompanied the ratification with  
this declaration: ‘Provided that, by  
this retrenchment, the two States re-  
nounce their respective pretensions,  
which are the object of the said article.”  
With this declaration it was returned to  
the Senate, and considered by that body  
**fully ratitied,’? on the 19th December,  
1801. This action of the Senate put an  
end to all claims on the part of our Gov-  
ernment against France, and whatever  
damages lad been done by either Gov-  
ernment to the rights and property of  
the citizens of the other, prior to 1800,  
were canceled as between the two na-  
tions; and on this action of the Govern-  
ment rest the claims familiarly known  
as the French Spoliation claims.
