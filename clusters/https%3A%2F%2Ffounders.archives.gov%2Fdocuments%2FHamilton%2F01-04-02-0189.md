To the People of the State of New-York.  
ALTHOUGH I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the consequences, which seem to be apprehended to the State Governments, from a power in the Union to controul them in the levies of money; because I am persuaded that the sense of the people, the extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the State Governments, and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local administrations, for local purposes, would be a complete barrier against the oppressive use of such a power: Yet I am willing here to allow in its full extent the justness of the reasoning, which requires that the individual States should possess an independent and uncontrolable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their own wants. And making this concession I affirm that (with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports) they would under the plan of the Convention retain that authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense; and that an attempt on the part of the national Government to abrige them in the exercise of it would be a violent assumption of power unwarranted by any article or clause of its Constitution.  
An intire consolidation of the States into one complete national sovereignty would imply an intire subordination of the parts; and whatever powers might remain in them would be altogether dependent on the general will. But as the plan of the Convention aims only at a partial Union or consolidation, the State Governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had and which were not by that act exclusively delegated to the United States. This exclusive delegation or rather this alienation of State sovereignty would only exist in three cases; where the Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it granted in one instance an authority to the Union; and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like authority; and where it granted an authority to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant. I use these terms to distinguish this last case from another which might appear to resemble it; but which would in fact be essentially different; I mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional interferences in the policy of any branch of administration, but would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority. These three cases of exclusive jurisdiction in the Fœderal Government may be exemplified by the following instances: The last clause but one in the 8th section of the 1st. article provides expressly that Congress shall exercise “exclusive legislation” over the district to be appropriated as the seat of government. This answers to the first case. The first clause of the same section impowers Congress “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts or excises” and the 2d. clause of the 10th. section of the same article declares that “no State shall without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports except for the purpose of executing its inspection laws.” Hence would result an exclusive power in the Union to lay duties on imports and exports with the particular exception mentioned; but this power is abriged by another clause which declares that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State; in consequence of which qualification it now only extends to the duties on imports, This answers to the second case. The third will be found in that clause, which declares that Congress shall have power “to establish an UNIFORM RULE of naturalization throughout the United States.” This must necessarily be exclusive; because if each State had power to prescribe a DISTINCT RULE there could be no UNIFORM RULE.  
A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter, but which is in fact widely different, affects the question immediately under consideration. I mean the power of imposing taxes on all articles other than exports and imports. This, I contend, is manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority in the United States and in the individual States. There is plainly no expression in the granting clause which makes that power exclusive in the Union. There is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the States from exercising it. So far is this from being the case, that a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced from the restraint laid upon the States in relation to duties on imports and exports. This restriction implies an admission, that if it were not inserted the States would possess the power it excludes, and it implies a further admission, that as to all other taxes the authority of the States remains undiminished. In any other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be unnecessary because if the grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties implied the exclusion of the States, or even their subordination in this particular there could be no need of such a restriction; it would be dangerous because the introduction of it leads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned and which if the reasoning of the objectors be just, could not have been intended; I mean that the States in all cases to which the restriction did not apply would have a concurrent power of taxation with the Union. The restriction in question amounts to what lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREGNANT; that is a negation of one thing and an affirmance of another; a negation of the authority of the States to impose taxes on imports and exports, and an affirmance of their authority to impose them on all other articles. It would be mere sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them absolutely from the imposition of taxes of the former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others subject to the controul of the national Legislature. The restraining or prohibitory clause only says, that they shall not without the consent of Congress lay such duties; and if we are to understand this in the sense last mentioned, the Constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision for the sake of a very absurd conclusion; which is that the States with the consent of the national Legislature might tax imports and exports; and that they might tax every other article unless controuled by the same body. If this was the intention why not leave it in the first instance to what is alleged to be the natural operation of the original clause conferring a general power of taxation upon the Union? It is evident that this could not have been the intention and that it will not bear a construction of the kind.

earances. It is not however a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers, but an immediate constitutional repugnancy, that can by implication alienate and extinguish a preexisting right of sovereignty.  
The necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases results from the division of the sovereign power; and the rule that all authorities of which the States are not explicitly divested in favour of the Union remain with them in full vigour, is not only a theoretical consequence of that division, but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the proposed constitution. We there find that notwithstanding the affirmative grants of general authorities, there has been the most pointed care in those cases where it was deemed improper that the like authorities should reside in the States, to insert negative clauses prohibiting the exercise of them by the States. The tenth section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions. This circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the Convention, and furnishes a rule of interpretation out of the body of the act which justifies the position I have advanced, and refutes every hypothesis to the contrary.

Congress could not emancipate slaves prior to that period. He  
remarked that either the power of manumiflion still remained with  
the several States, or it was exclulively veiled in Congress ; for no  
one would contend that such a power could be concurrent in the  
several States and the United States. He then lhewed that the

“T am willing here to allow, in its full extent, the justness of the rea-  
soning, which requires that the individual States should possess an inde-  
pendent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the  
supply of their own wants. And making this concession, I affirm that,  
(with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports,) they would,  
under the plan of the convention, retain that authority in the most ab-  
solute and unqualified sense ; and that an attempt on the part of the na-  
tional government to abridge them in the exercise of it, would be a vio-  
lent assumption of power, unwarranted by any article or clause of its  
constitution.  
  
* An entire consolidation of the States into one complete national  
sovereiguty, would imply an entire subordination of the parts; and what-  
ever powers might remaim in them, would be altogether dependent on  
the general will. But as the plan of the convention aims only at a partial  
union or consolidation, the State governments would clearly retain all  
the rights of sovereiguty which they before had, and which were not, by  
that act exclusively de leeated to the United States. This exclusive de-  
legation, or rather this alienation of State sovereignty, would only exist  
in three cases: where the Constitution in express terms granted an ex-  
clusive authority to the Union; where it granted, in one instance, an au-  
thority to the Union, and in another, prohibited the States from exercis-  
ing the like authority ; and where it granted an authority to the Union,  
to which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and to-  
tally contradictory and repugnant. 1 use these terms to distinguish this  
last case from another which might appear to resemble it; but which  
would, in fact, be essentially different: Limean where the exercise of a  
concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional interferences  
in the policy of any branch of administration, but would not imply any  
direct contradiction or repugnaney in point of constitutional authority.  
These three cases of exclusive jarisdiction in the Federal Government,  
may be exemplitied by the following instances: The last clause but one  
in the eighth section of the first article, provides expressly, that Con-  
gress shall exercise * exclusive legislation” over the district to be appro-  
priated as the seat of government. This answers to the first case. The  
first clause of the same section empowers Congress, “to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts and excises ;” and the second clause of the tenth  
section of the same article declares, that “‘no State shall, without the  
consent of Congress, ay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, ex-  
except for the purpose of executing its tuspection laws.” Hence would

result an exclusive power in the Union to lay duties on unports and ex-  
ports, with the particularexception mentioned; but this power is abridg-  
ed by another clause, which declares, that no tax or duty shall be laid  
on articles exported from any State ; in consequence of which qualiti-  
cation, it now only extends to the duties on imports. This answers to  
the second case. The third case will be found, in that clause which de-  
clares,, that Congress shall have power * to establish an uniform rule of  
naturalization throughout the United States.” This must necessarily  
be exclusive; because if each State had power to prescribe a distinct  
rule, there could be no uniform rule.  
  
* A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter, but  
which is in fact widely different, affeets the question nuinediately under  
consideration. Tmean the power of imposing taxes on all articles other  
than exports and imports. This | contend, is manifestly a concurrent  
and coequal authority in the United States, and in the individual States.  
There ts plainly no expression in the granting clause, which makes that  
power erclusive in the Union. There ts no independent clause or seu-  
tence which prolubits the States from exercising it. So far is this froin  
being the case, that a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is  
deducible from the restraint made upon the States in relation to duties  
on imports and exports. &quot;This restriction implies an admission, that if  
it were not mserted, the States would possess the power it excludes ;  
and it implies a further adinission, that as to all other taxes, the autho-  
rity of the States remains undiminished. In any other view, it would be  
both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be unnecess: iry because, if  
the grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties, unplie cd the ex-  
clusion of the States, or even their subordination in this particular, there  
could be no need of such a restriction; it would be dangerous, because  
the introduction of ut leads direetly to the conclusion which has been  
mentioned, and which, if the reasoning of the objectors be just, could  
not have been intended; [ mean that the States, mi all cases to whieh  
the restriction did not apply, would have a concurrent power of taxation  
with the Union. The restriction in question amounts to what lawyers  
call a negative pregnant ; that is, a negation of one thing, and an ajfirm-  
ance of another: anegation of the authority of the States to impose taxes  
on imports and exports, and an affirmance of their authority to impose  
them on all other articles. It would be mere sophistry to argue, that it  
was meant to exclude them absolutely from the imposition of taxes of the  
former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others subject to the con-  
trol of the national legislature. The restraining or prohibi tory cliuse  
only says, that they shall not, without the consent of Congress, lay such  
duties; and if we are to understand this in the sense last mentioned, the  
Constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision, for the  
sake of a very absurd conclusion; which is, that the States, with the  
consent of the national legislature, might tax imports and exports ; and  
that they might tax every other article, unless controlled by the same  
body. If this was the intention, Why was it not left, in the first instance,  
to what is alleged to be the natural operation of the original clause,  
eonferring a general power of taxation upon the Union? It is evident  
that this could not have been the intention, and that it will not bear a  
construction of the kind.”

of all power in congress to legislate on the subject. It is rendered then a judicial  
power, to be put in force by this court, and not by legislation, and yet have the  
judiciary any power to regulate commerce among the states? It isasullen, dog in  
the manger power, that can neither act itself, nor permit action by any other au-  
thority. In the 32d number of the Federalist, Mr. Hamilton, who was the boldest  
opponent of state power, tells us there are but three cases under the constitution,  
in which a state cannot exercise a power, “ where the constitution in express terms  
granted an exclusive authority to the Union. Where it granted in one instance an  
authority to the Union, and in another, prohibited the states from exercising the  
like authority ; and where it granted an authority to the Union, to which a similar  
authority in the states would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repug-  
nant.” Itis conceded that there is no express grant of exclusive power to congress,  
or express prohibition to the states; but it is contended that the prohibition of the  
state power follows in this case, because its exercise would be the exercise of the  
same power granted exclusively to congress ; and, therefore, the possession of such  
a power by the state would be “absolutely and totally contradictory and repug-  
nant” to the possession of the same power by congress.

Congress and the courts of the Union ?  
  
The rule laid down by Mr. Hamilton in the Federalist, and  
pretty generally adopted, is, that the alienation of State power ex-  
ists in three cases only, namely, where the Constitution in express  
terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it grant-  
ed in one instance authority to the Union, and in another prohib-  
ited the States from exercising the like authority; and where it  
granted an authority to the Union, to which a similar authority in  
the States would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repug-  
nant. No. 32.

weiinu : i  
&quot;Yet I am willing here to allow, in its full ex  
tent, the justness of thereasoning, which requires,  
that the individual states should possess an inde  
pendent and uncontrjlcle authority to raise their  
own revenues for the yipply oj their own wants.  
And making this concision, I affirm, that (with  
the sole exception of duts on imports and exports)  
they would, under the plan of the convention, re­  
tain that authority in the most absolute and unqua­  
lified sense ; andthat an attempt on the part of the  
national government ta-&#x27;abridge them in the exer­  
cise of it, would be a violent assumption of power,  
unwarranted by any article or clause of its consti­  
tution.&quot;&quot;A case which may perhaps be thought to re­  
semble the latter, but w hich is in fact widely dif­  
ferent, affects the question immediately under con­  
sideration. I mean the power of imposing taxes  
on all articles other than exports and imports. This  
I contend, is manifestly a concurrent and co-equal  
authority in the United States and in the individual  
states. There is plainly no expression in the grant­  
ing clause, which makes that power exclusive in the  
union. There is no independent clause or sentence  
which prohibits the states from exercising it. So  
far is this from being the case, that a plain and  
conclusive argument to the contrary is deducible,  
from the restraint laid upon the states in relation  
to duties on imports and exports. This restriction  
implies an admission, that if it were not inserted,  
the states would possess the power it excludes ;  
and it implies a further admission, that as to all  
other taxes, the authority of the states remains un­  
diminished. In any other view it would be both  
unnecessary and dangerous.&quot;  
Not only was the clause of the Constitution un­  
der consideration so construed, by its framers and  
advocates, in procuring its ratification by the States,  
but the State Conventions so received it ; and its  
advocates in the respective States placed its rati­  
fication and adoption in their respective Conven­  
tions, upon the same high platform of their entire  
independence and equality, as to the taxing power.  
In the Convention of New York, the objection  
was made to the taxing power given to Congress  
by the Cth section of the 1st article of the Consti­  
tution. Mr. Smith first raised the w

becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the  
People to Alter or Abolish it.&quot;  
Contemplate for a moment the denial of this right,  
and what a picture is presented to the mind. To deny  
the right of secession to a State, is to establish the con­  
trary doctrine of &quot;unlimited submission&quot; to the gener­  
al will of a majority of the people of the several States,  
and it is also a denial of State sovereignty, for submis­  
sion and sovereignty are not convertible terms. Mr.  
Hamilton asserted in opposition to the objections raised  
against the constitution that  
&quot; An entire consolidation of the States into one  
complete national sovereignty, would imply an entire  
subordination of the parts ; and whatever powers  
might remain in them, would be altogether dependent on  
the General Will.&quot;  
lie further says that the convention aimed at only a  
partial union or consolidatiou, and that &quot;the State gov­  
ernments would clearly retain all the rights of sover­  
eignty which they before had, and which were not, by  
that act, exclusively delegated to the United States.&quot;  
As there is none fatuous enough to deny that the  
States were sovereign before the formation of the pres­  
ent contistution, it follows if Mr. Hamilfon is right,  
that they are so still in every particular save those only  
exclusively delegated away. Have they delegated a-  
way the right to alter or abolish the present form of  
government J  
What is the meaning of the 9th and 10th articles of  
the constitution quoted above 1 There must be rights  
and powers reserved by the States and the People, and  
it is clear that the States, one or many, may withdraw  
from the Union whenever

to centralize and consolidate all power

total destruction of the Federal sys-

‘¢An entire consolidation of the States in«

cases : where the Constilution tn express terms

must be received as a correct and conclusive exposition of

cussing the subject of taxation, and con­  
ceding that &quot;the individual States should  
posses an independent uncontrolable au­  
thority to raise their own revenues for the  
supply of their own wants,&quot; Alexander  
Hamilton said:  
I affirm that (with the sole exception of

under the plan of the Constitution, retain  
that authority In the most absolute and  
unqualified sense; and that any attempt on  
tho part of the National Government to  
abridge them in the exercise of  
it would bo a violent assumption of  
power, unwarranted by any article or clause  
of the Constitution. An entire consolida­  
tion of tho States into one complete sover­  
eignty, would imply an entire subordina­  
tion of the parts; and whatever powers  
might remain in them, would be altogether  
dependent upon the general will. But as  
the plan of the convention aims only at a  
partial union or consolidation, the State  
governments would clearly retain all the  
rights of sovereignty which they before  
bad, and which were not by that act ex­  
pressly delegated to the United States.&quot;  
Referring to the clause of the Constitu­  
tion which declares that Congress shall  
have power &quot;to establish an uniform rule  
of naturalization throughout the United  
States,&quot; Mr. Hamilton says:  
&quot;A case which may perhaps bo thought  
to resemble the latter, but which is in fact  
widely different, affects the question imme­  
diately nnder consideration. I mean the  
power of imposing taxes on all articles oth­  
er than exports and imports. This, I con­  
tend, is manifestly a concurrent and co-  
  
equal authority in the United States and in

makes that power exaluMte 14&quot; the Union.  
.There ls.no independent cl&amp;ase or seetence  
which prohibits the States from exercising  
it. So far Is this from being trie-case, that  
a plain and conclusive argumenE to the con  
trary Is deducible from toe restraint laid
