The honorable the Congress having thought it necessary at this juncture to pass the following resolutions the Commander in chief takes occasion to communicate them to the Army.  
By the United States in Congress assembled August 12th 1782.  
Whereas from the late publications the people throughout the United States may be induced to beleive that Congress have received authentic communications upon the subject of an approaching peace.  
Resolved that the letter of August 2d 1782 from Sir Guy Carleton, and Admiral Digby to the Commander in Chief be made public.  
Resolved that Congress consider the above letter as mere matter of information inexplicit as to the nature and extent of the Independency directed to be proposed by the British Plenipotentiary—And as Congress have received no information on this subject  
from their Ministers for negotiating a peace therefore no public measures can or ought to be taken upon it in its present form.  
Resolved that it be and it is hereby recommended to the several states in the union not to remit of their exertions for carrying on the war with vigor as the only effectual means of securing the settlement of a safe and honorable peace.  
The sentiments contained in the foregoing are too just and obvious to need discanting upon—the General therefore flatters himself, that both officers and soldiers so far from relaxing in the least from that laudable spirit which at present actuates them,  
will rather encrease their endeavors to render the

N.B. The Letter alluded to in the above resolutions is that of the 2d of August from Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby to the Commander in Chief which having been already published in most of the Newspapers it is thought unnecessary to transcribe into  
General orders.
