Private  
Sir,  
Philadelphia 11th Decr 1796  
  
The near view which you have of the Revolution in France, and of the political state of things in Europe, especially those of Great Britain, has enabled you to form a judgment with so much more accuracy than I could do, of the probable result of the perturbated state of the countries which compose that quarter of the globe, and of the principal actors on that theatre, that it wd be presumption in me, at the distance of 3000 miles, to give an opinion relatively to either men, or measures; and therefore, I will proceed to the information required in your private letter of the 11th of September, wch I will give from the best knowledge I possess, &amp; with the candour you have a right to expect from me.  
The United States, as you well know, are very extensive—more than 1500 miles between the North Eastern, &amp; So. Western extremities; all parts of which, from the Seaboard to the Apalachian Mountains, (which divide the Eastern from the Western waters) are entirely settled; though not as compactly as they are susceptible of; and settlements are progressing rapidly beyond them.  
Within so great a space, you are not to be told, that there are a great variety of climates; and you will readily suppose too that, there are all sorts of land—differently improved, and of various prices, according to the quality of the Soil; its contiguity to, or remoteness from Navigation; the nature of the improvements, and other local circumstances. These however, are only sufficient for the formation of a general opinion, for there are material deviations, as I shall mention hereafter.  
In the New England States, and to Pennsylvania inclusively, landed property is more divided than it is in the States South of them. The farms are smaller, the buildings and other improvements, generally, better; and, of consequence, the population  
  
is greater: But then, the climate, especially to the Eastward of Hudsons River, is cold, the winters long, consuming a great part of the Summers labour in support of their Stocks, during the Winter: nevertheless, it is a country abounding in grass, and furnishes much fine Beef, besides exporting many horses to the West Indies. A Mill-dew or blight (I am speaking now of the New England States particularly) prevents them from raising Wheat adequate to their own consumption; and of other grains they export little or none: Fish being their Staple. They live well notwithstanding, and are a happy People. Their numbers are not augmented by foreign Emigrants; yet, from their circumscribed limits, compact situation, and natural population. they are filling the western parts of the State of New York, and the country on the Ohio with their own surplusage.  
New Jersey is a small state, &amp; all parts of it, except the Southwestern, are pleasant—healthy—and productive of all kinds of grain, &amp;ca. Being surrounded on two sides by New York, and on the other two by Delaware River &amp; the Atlantic, it has no land of its own to supply the surplus of its population, of course their emigrations are principally towards the Ohio.  
Pennsylvania is a large state, and from the policy of its founder, and of the government since; and especially from the celebrity of Philadelphia, has become the general recepticle of foreigners from all countries, and of all descriptions; many of whom soon take an active part in the politics of the State; and coming over full of prejudices against their own governments, some against all government, you will be enabled, without any comment of mine, to draw your own inference of their conduct.  
Delaware is a very small State—the greater part of which lyes low, and is supposed to be unhealthy. The Eastern shore of Maryland is similar thereto. The lands in both, however, are good.  
But the Western parts of the last mentioned State, and of Virginia, quite to the line of No. Carolina, above tide water and more especially above the Blue Mountains, are similar to those of Pennsylvania between the Susqu[e]hanna &amp; Potomac Rivers, in Soil, climate &amp; productions; and in my opinion will be considered, if it is not considered so already, as the Garden of America; forasmuch as it lyes between the two extremes of heat &amp; cold, partaking in a degree of the advantages of both, without feeling much, the inconveniences of either: and with truth it may  
  
be said, is among the most fertile lands in America, East of the Apalachian Mountains.  
The uplands of North &amp; So. Carolina, and Georgia, are not dissimilar in soil; but as they approach the lower latitudes, are less congenial to Wheat—and are supposed to be proportionally more unhealthy. Towards the Seaboard of all the Southern States (and further South the more so) the country is low, sandy and unhealthy; for which reason I shall say little concerning them, for as I should not chuse to be an inhabitant of them myself, I ought not to say any thing that would induce others to be so.  
This general description is furnished, that you may be enabled to form an idea of the part of the United States which would be most congenial to your inclination. To pronounce with any degree of precision what lands could be obtained for in the parts I have enumerated, is next to impossible, for the reasons I have before assigned; but upon pretty good data it may be said, that those in Pennsylvania are higher than those in Maryland (and I believe in any other State) declining in price as you go southerly, until the Rice Swamps of So. Carolina &amp; Georgia are met with, &amp; these are as much above the medium in price, as they are below it in health. I understand however, that from 30 to 40 dollars pr Acre (I fix on dollars because they apply equally to all the States, and because their relative value to sterling is well understood) may be denominated the Medium price in the vicinity of the Susquehanna, in the State of Pennsylvania: from 20 to 30 on the Potomac, both in what is called the Valley—that is—lying between the Blue Mountain &amp; North Mountain wch are the richest lands we have—and less, as I have noticed before, as you proceed Southerly. But what may appear singular, and was alluded to in the former part of this letter, the lands in the parts of which I am now speaking, on, and contiguous to, tide water (with local exceptions) are in lower estimation than those which are above, and more remote from Navigation. The causes however are apparent—1. the land is better. 2. higher &amp; more healthy—3. they are chiefly, if not altogether, in the occupation of Farmers; and 4. from a combination of all them, purchasers are attracted, and of consequence the prices rise in proportion to the demand.  
The rise in the value of landed property, in this country, has been progressive, ever since my attention has been turned to the subject (—now more than 40 years)—but for the last three  
  
or four of that period, it has increased beyond all calculation—owing in part to the attachment to, and the confidence which the people are beginning to place in, their form of Government—and to the prosperity of the country from a variety of concurring causes, none more than to the late high prices of its produce.  
From what I have said, you will have perceived that the present prices of Land in Pennsylvania are higher than they are in Maryland and Virginia, although they are not of Superior quality. Two reasons have already been assigned for this, first, that in the settled part of it, the land is divided into smaller farms, and more improved; and 2dly being, in a greater degree than any other, the recepticle of emigrants, these receive their first impressions in Philadelphia, and rarely look beyond the limits of the State; but besides these, two other causes, not a little operative may be added; namely, that until Congress passed general Laws relative to naturalization and citizenship, foreigners found it easier to obtain the previledges annexed to them in this State than elsewhere; and because there are Laws here for the gradual abolition of Slavery, which neither of the two States abovementioned have, at present, but which nothing is more certain than that they must have, &amp; at a period not remote.  
Notwithstanding these obstacles, and although I may incur the charge of partiality in hazarding such an opinion at this time, I do not hesitate to pronounce that, the Lands on the Waters of Potomack will, in a few years, be in greater demand, and in higher estimation than in any other part of the United States. But as I ought not to advance this doctrine without assigning reasons for it, I will request you to examine a general Map of the United States, and the following facts will strike you at first view. that they lye in the most temperate latitude of the United States; that the main river runs in a direct course to the expanded part of the Western country, and approximates nearer to the principal branches of the Ohio than any other Eastern water, &amp; of course must become a great, if not (under all circumstances) the best highway into that Region; That the upper Sea port of the Potomac is considerably nearer to a large portion of the State of Pennsylvania than that portion is to Philadelphia, besides accomodating the settlers thereof with inland navigation for more than 200 miles. that the amazing extent of tide navigation afforded by the Bay &amp; Rivers of Chesapeak has scarcely a parallel.  
  
When to these are added, that a site at the junction of the inland, &amp; tide navigations of that river is chosen for the permanent Seat of the general government, and is in rapid preparation for its reception. that the inland navigation of the River is nearly completed to the extent abovementioned, &amp; that its lateral branches are capable of great improvement, at a small expence through the most fertile parts of Virginia, in a Southerly direction, and crossing Maryland and extending into Pennsylvania in a northerly one; thro’ which (independent of what may come from the Western country) an immensity of produce will be water borne, thereby making the Federal City the great emporium of the United States. I say, when these things are taken into consideration, I am under no apprehension of having the opinion I have given relative to the value of land on Potomac, controverted by impartial men.  
There are farms always, and every where for Sale; if therefore, events should induce you to cast an eye towards America, there need be no apprehension of your being accomodated to your liking; and if I could be made useful to you therein, you might command my Services with the greatest freedom.  
Within full view of Mount Vernon—seperated therefrom by Water only—is one of the most beautiful Seats on the River, for sale; but of greater Magnitude than you seem to have contemplated. It is called Belvoir, and did belong to George William Fairfax Esqr.; who, was he living, would now be Baron of Cameron, as his younger brother in this country (he George William dying without issue) at present is, though he does not take upon himself the title. This seat was the residence of the abovenamed Gentleman before he went to England, and was accomodated with with very good buildings, which were burnt soon after he left them. There are near 2000 Acres of land belonging to the tract, surrounded in a manner by water. The Mansion house stood on high and commanding ground: the soil is not of the first quality, but a considerable part of it lying level may with proper management, be profitably cultivated. There are some small tenements on the Estate, but the greater part thereof is in wood. At present it belongs to Thomas Fairfax—Son of Bryan Fairfax, the Gentleman who will not, as I said before, take upon himself the title of Baron of Cameron. A year or two ago the price he fixed on the land was (as I have been informed) 33⅓  
  
dollars pr Acre; whether not getting that sum—or whether he is no longer disposed to sell it, I am unable, with precision to say, for I have heard nothing concerning his intentions lately.  
With respect to the tenements I have offered to let, appertaining to my Mount Vernon Estate, I can give no better description of them, and of their appurtenances, than what is contained in the printed Advertisement here with enclosed: but that you may have a more distinct view of the farms, and their relative situation to the Mansion House, a sketch from actual Survey is also enclosed; annexed to which, I have given you from memory, the relative situation, &amp; form of the Seat of Belvoir.  
The terms on which I had authorised the Superintendent of my concerns at Mount Vernon to lease the farms there, are also enclosed; which, with the other papers, &amp; the general information herein detailed, will throw all the light I am enabled to give you, upon the Subject of your enquiry. To have such a tenant as Sir John Sinclair, however desirable it might be, is an honor I dare not hope for; and to alienate any part of the Fee simple estate of Mount Vernon is a measure I am not inclined to, as all the Farms are connected, and are parts of a whole. With very great esteem &amp; respect I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most Obedient &amp; Obliged Hble Servant  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
P.S. As I shall have an opportunity in the course of the present Session of Congress to converse with the Members thereof from different States—and from different parts of each State, I will write you a supplimentary account if essential information should be obtained in addition to, or corrective of⟨,⟩ what is given to you in the aforegoing sheets.

f Mei near view Which you have of the revolution in France,  
and of the political state of things in Europe, especially  
those of .Great Britain, has epabled you to form a judgment  
with so much more accuracy than [ could do of the probable  
result of tlie pe rturbated state of the countries which compose  
that quarter of the globe, and of the principal actors in that thea-  
tre, thatit would be presumpiuous in me, at the distance of $000  
miles, to give an opinion relatively to either men or measures ;  
and therctore [ wil ser to the information required in your  
private letter of the 11th of September, which | will give from  
the best knowledge &#x27; possess, and with the candour you have a  
right to expect from me.  
  
“The United States, as you well know, are very extensive, more  
than 1500 miles between the north-eastern aad south-western ex-  
tremities ; al! parts of which, from the Seaboard to the Apalach-  
  
Jan mountains (which divide the eastern from the western wa-  
ters,) are cutirely settled, though uot as compactly as they are  
susceptible of; and settlements are progressing rapidly be youd  
them.  
  
Within so great a space you are not to be told that there are  
  
a great varicty of climates ; and you will readily suppase, too,  
that there are all sorts of lan: |, differently i improved, and of va-  
rious prices, according to the quality of the soil; its conti-  
  
guity to, or remoteness from navigation ; the nature of the im-  
provements, and other local circumstances. These, however,  
are only sufficient for the formation of a general opinion ; for  
there are material deviations, as [ shall mention hereafter.  
  
In the New England states, and to Pe nnsylvania inclusively,  
landed property is more divided than it isin the states south of  
them.  
  
The farms are smaller; the buildings and other improve-  
ments generally better: and, of consequence, the population  
is greater: but then, the climate, especially to the eastward of  
Hudson’s river, is cold 5 the winters long, consuming a great  
part of the summer’s labour in support of their stocks during  
the winter. Nevertheless, it is a country abounding in grass,  
and furnishes much fine beef, besides exporting many horses to  
the West Indies.  
  
A mildew or blight, (I am speaking now of the New Eag-  
land states particularly) prevents them from raising wheat ade-  
quate to their own consumption, and of other grains they ex-  
port little or none ; fish being theirstaple. They live well, not-  
withstanding, and area happy people. Their numbers are not

in the parts | have enumerated, is next to impossible, for the  
reasons I have before assigned; but upon pretty good data it  
may be said, that those in Pennsylvania are higher than those  
in Maryland (aud, I believe, in any other state), declining. ‘in  
price as you go southerly, until the rice swamps of South Ca-  
rolina and Georgia are met with ; and ‘these are as much above  
the medium in price, as they are below it in health. I under-  
stand, however, that from SO to 40 dollars per acre (I fix on  
dollars beeause they apply equally to all the states, and because  
their relative value to sterling is well nnderstood,) may be deno-  
minated the medium price in the vicinity of the Susquehanna,  
in the state of Pennsylvania; from 20 to 30 on the Potoinac* ;  
and less, as 1 have noticed before, as you proceed southerly,  
But, what may appear singular, and was alluded to in the for-  
ner part of this letter, the lands in the parts of which Tam  
now speaking, on and contiguous to tide-water (with local ex-  
  
ceptions), are in lower estimation than those which are above  
  
and more remote from navigation. ‘The causes, however, are  
apparent: 1, the land is better; 2, higher, and more healthy ;  
}, they are chieily, if not altogether, in the occupation of far-  
mers; and 4, from a combination of ail these, purchasers are  
attracted, and of consequence the prices tise in proportion io  
the demand. ‘The rise in the value of landed prope rty in th  
  
country hus been progressive ever since my attention has been  
turned to the subject, now more than 40 years; but for the last  
three or four of that period, it has increased beyond all caleu-

degree than any other the receptacle of emigrants, these re-  
ceive their first impressions in Philadelphia, and rarely look  
beyond the limits of the state. But besides these, two other  
causes, not a little operative, may be added ; namely, that wn-

there are laws here for the gradual abolition of slavery, which  
neither of the two states above-incniioned have at present, but  
whieh nothing is more certain than that they must have, and at  
a peri iod not remote.  
  
Notwithstanding these obstacles, and although I may incur  
the charge of partiality in hazarding such an opinion at this  
tine, I do not hesitate to pronounce that the lands of the wa-  
tersof Potomac wiilin a few years be in greater demand, and  
in higher estimation, than in any other part of the United States.  
But as Ll ought not to advance this doctrive without assigning  
reasons for 1i, | will request you to examine a general map of  
the United States, and the following facts will strike you at the  
first view : that they lie in the most temperate latitude of the  
United Stats s; that the main river runs in a direct course to  
the ex pande «l part of the western country, and approximates  
  
nearer to the principal branches of the Ohio than any other  
eastern water; aud of course must become a great, if not (un-  
der all circumstances) the best highway into that region: that  
the upper sea-port of the P otomac is consider ably nearer to a  
Jarge portion of the state of Pennsylvania, than that portion is  
to Philad: Iphia ; beside: accommodating the setilers thereof  
with inland naviention for mere than 200 miles: that the  
amazing extent of tide navigation afforded by the bay “avin ri-  
vers of Chesapeak, has scarcely a parallel. Wien to these are  
added, that a site at the junction of the inland and tide navi-  
gation of that river is chosen for the permanent seat of the ge-  
neral government, and is in rapid preparation for its reception ;  
that the inlond navigation of a river is nearly compleced to  
the extent above-me ntioned 1 that its lateral branches are  
capabie of great diel at a small expeuce, through the  
most fertile i irts of \ gpa in as yutherly directo n, and cros-  
sing Maryland and e xtending into Pennsylvania in a northerly  
one, th rough which (indepe ident of what m: wv come from the  
western country) an uninensity of produce wiil be water-borne,  
thereby making the federal city the great emporium of the  
United States—I say, when these &quot;things : tre taken into couside-  
ration, | am under no appre hension of having the opinion I  
have given relative to the value of land on Potemet coutro-  
verted by in nparti il men.  
  
There are farms always, and cvery where, for sale: if, there-  
fore, events should induce you to cast an eye towards Ame-  
rica, there need be no apprehension .of your ‘being accommo-  
dated to your liking; and if L could be made useful to you  
therein, you might command my services with the greate: st  
tree “dom,  
  
Within full view of Mount Vernon, separated therefrom by

There are near 2000 acres of land belonging to the tract,  
surrounded in a manner by water. ‘The mansion-house stood  
on high and commanding ground. The soil is not of the first  
cuality ; but a considerable part of it lying level, may, with pro-  
per management, be profitably cultivated. There are some  
small tenements on the estate, but the greater part there of is in  
wood. At present it belongs to ‘Thomas Fairiax, son of Bryan

in toe, afc the distance of 3000 miles,  
to give an opinion rela-tive to. either  
men or measures, and therefore 1 will  
proceed to the information required in,  
your private letter of the 11th  
September, which I will give ftom the  
best knowledge 1 possess, and with the  
candour you have a right to expect from  
me» Tbe Un it od States, as you well  
know, are very extensive, more thin 15i&gt;  
miles between the north eastern, and  
south-westward extremities ; all parts  
of which, from thc seaboard to the A pal  
ach ia&#x27;i mountains, which divide the  
easter« from the western waters, are  
entirely settled, though not as  
completely as they are susceptible of,  
and settlements are progressing rapidly-  
be-yond them. Within so great a space  
you are not to be told that there are a  
great variety of classes, and you will  
readily suppose too that there are all  
aorta of land, differently improved, and  
of various prices, according to the  
quality of the soil, and tts contiguity  
to, or remoteness from, navigation; t&#x27;ae  
nature of i\n improvements, and other  
loca,! circumstances. These, however,  
are only suffi-cient for the formation  
of a general opinion, for there are  
material deviations, as I sha!! mention  
hereafter. In the New Kngland States,  
and to Pennsyl-vania inclusively, landed  
property is morl di-vided than it is in  
the States south of them. The farms are  
smaller, the buildings and other  
improvements generally better, and of  
con-sequence the population is greater;  
but then, the climate, especially tu ¿he  
eastward oí Hud-; son&#x27;s River, is cold,  
the winters long, consuming a great part  
of the summer labour, in support of  
their flocks during the wiuter.  
Nevertheless, Ut is a country abounding  
in grass, ;;nd furnishes ; much fine  
beef, bt sides exporting many horses ¡  
to the West Indies. j A mildew or blight  
(I am speaking now of the ; New England  
Slates particularly) prevents them I  
from raising wheat adequate to their own  
con i sumption, and of other grains they  
export little ! or none- fish being  
their staple. They live well j  
notwithstanding, aud are a happy people.  
Their numbers are not augmented by  
foreign emigrants, yet from their  
circumscribed limits, compact situation,  
and tis:ural population, they are  
filling the wester« parts of the State  
of New York and the country on the Ohio  
with their own surplusage. ! New Jersey  
is a small State, aud all parts pf it,  
except t&#x27;tie south western, are  
pleasant, and productive of alt kinds of  
grain, &amp;c. Being surrounded on two sides  
by New York, and ott the oilier two by  
the Delaware River aud the Atlantic, it  
has uo laud &lt;&gt;f its owit to supply the  
surplus of its population ; of course i  
h 3ir end gration is principally towards  
the Ohio. Pennsylvania is a targe Stale,  
aud from the policy of its founder, ami  
of lite gjvertimetit since, and  
especially from ti¿e celebrity of Phi-  
ladelphia, has becoiue the general  
receptacle of foreign men fro ir. ali  
countries and of all descrip-tions,  
mitty of whom soon take au active part  
in the polities of the »tate, and coming  
over full of the prejudices against  
their owa govern-ments, you will ba  
enabled, without any com-ments of »iii  
e, to dia-.v your owu conclusions of  
their coudie . Delaware is a very small  
State, the greater part of which lies  
low, and is supposed to be unhealthy.  
The eastern shore of Maryland is similar  
thereto. The lands itt both, however,  
are good. Bul the western patts of the  
last mentioned states, an 1 of Virginia,  
quite to the line of North Carolina,  
above tide water, aud more especially  
above the Blue Mountains, ate similar to  
those of Pennsylvania, between the  
Suspuehat ni and Potomac Rivers, in  
soil, climate, and produc-tions; and in  
my opinion will be considered, if it is  
not considered so already, as the garden  
of America; forasmuch as it lies betweeu  
the two extreme of heat aud cold,  
partaking tu a degree of the advantages  
of both, without feeling much the  
inconveniences of either, and with truth  
it may be said, is among the most  
fertile lauds iu America east of the  
Apalacbian mountains. The uplands of  
North and S&#x27;Uth C roh&#x27;na aud Georgia are  
notdisstmilarin soil, but a? U)ey  
approach the lower latitudes arc less  
congenial to wheat, and are supposed to  
be proportionabiy more unhealthy, for  
which reason I shall say but little  
concerning them ; foras I should not  
choose tp be au inhabitant of them  
myself» I ought uot lo say any thing  
that would induce others to be so. The  
general description is furnished that  
you may be enabled to farm ap idea of  
tbs part of life IJuited States which  
would ba moat conge-nial to your  
inclination. To pronounce with any  
degree of precision what lands could be  
obtained for iu the parts T have  
enumerated is next to j impossible, for  
tbe reasons I have before ae ; signed ;  
but, upon pretty good data, it may be  
said that those in Pennsylvania aie  
higher than those in Maryland (and I  
believe in any other «tate), declining  
in price as you go southerly, until the  
rice swamps of South Carolina and  
{reorgta are met with; and these are  
much above the medium pf price, a? they  
are below it ia health. I understand,  
however, that from 30 to 40 dollars per  
acre (i fix dollars because they apply  
equally to all the states, and because  
their relative value in sterling is well  
under-stood) may be denominated as jibe  
medium price bi the vicinity of the  
Susquehanna, tn the State of  
Pennsylvania, from 20 to 30 on the  
Potomac,f and less, as I have noticed  
before, as you proceed southerly. But  
what may appear singu-lar, and was  
alluded to hi the former part of this  
-letter, the lauds in the parts of which  
I am pow! speaking are contiguous to the  
tide water (wijlji local exceptions),,  
ai» iu lower esti^âtipa than those which  
ure above aud remote from naviga-tion,.

perity of the. country ftojn * vjaneiy  
of conçujç* ; ring causes, none mare  
than to the late high prices of hs  
produce From what Î have said, yon will  
have percenTed that the present prices  
of land in Pennsylvania are higher than  
in Maryland and Virginia, aldroagh they  
are not of superior quality; Two  
reasons&quot; have already been assigned for  
this.; first, it is the settled part of  
it, the land is divided into smaller  
farms and more improved j secondly,  
being in a greater degree, than others  
the receptacle of emigrants, they  
receive their first impression iii &#x27;  
Philadelphia, and rarely look beyond the  
luniks of the State. But, besides,  
these, two other canses not a little  
operative may be added, namely-«hat  
ontií Congress passed general laws  
relative to natnratea tion and  
citizenship, foreigners founrl rt easaer  
to &#x27; obtain the privileges annexed to  
them in this State than elsewhere;.and  
because there ave laws here for the  
gradual abolition of slavery, which  
neither of the two States above  
mentioned have at present; but which  
nothing is more certain than they most  
haye, and at a period not remote.  
Notwithstanding these obstacles, and  
although I may incur the charge of  
partiality in hasnurffing -such an  
opinion at this time, X do not hesitate  
to pronounce that tuglands of the waters  
ofPennsyl^ vania will in a few y«ars be  
in greater demand, mud in higher  
estimation, than in any other part of  
the United States ; and the following  
facts will strike you at the first view  
:-That they lie in ¿he most temperate  
latitude of the^flfruted States ; that  
the main river runs in a direct course  
to the expanded part of the western  
country, and approximates nearer to the  
principal branches of the Ohio than any  
ether eastern »rater, and of coarse must  
beatme a great, if not (under all  
circumstances) the best» highway into  
that region ; that thc upper sea-part of  
the Potomac is considerably nearer to a  
large portion of the State of  
Pennsylvania than that portion is to  
Philadelphia; besides accommodatingthe  
settlers thereof with inland navigation  
for more than two hundred miles, that  
the amazing extent of the navigation  
afforded by the bay and livers of  
Chesapeake, -has scarcely a parallel.  
When to these &quot; are added, that a site  
at the junction of the inland and tide  
navigation of that river is chosen for  
the permanent seat of the general  
Government, and is .iu rapid preparation  
for its reception ; that the in-land  
navigation of thc river is nearly  
completed to the extent above mentioned  
; and that its lateral branches are  
capable of great improvement at a small

of Vir-ginia in a southerly direction,

through which (independent of what may  
come from the western country) an  
immensity of produce will be water  
borne, thereby making; the federal city  
the great emporium of the United States.  
I say, when these things are taken imp  
consideration, 1 am under no  
apprehension of l»aving the opinion I  
have given relative to the value&quot; of the  
Land of Potomac contradicted by  
impartial men. There are farms always

might command my services with the  
greatest free-dom. &quot; &#x27; Within full viea

to have con I tem plated, ft is called  
Belvoir, and did belong to George

was the residence of th? above uaaed  
gentleman before he went to England, and  
wa» accommodated with very good  
buildings, which were burnt soon after  
he left them. There are near 2000 acres  
of land belonging&#x27; to the tract,  
surrounded in * manner by water. The  
mansion house stood on high and com-  
manding grouid; the soil is-not of the  
first quality ; but a considerable part  
of it lying level, may, with proper  
management, be profitably cultivated.  
There are some small tenements on the  
estate, but a greater i art thereof is  
in wood. At present it belongs to Thomas  
Fairfax, son of ||ry%a Fairfax« the  
gentleman who will not, as I »aid

[Triplicate.} a PHILADELPHIA, Lith Dec., 1796.  
Sir: The near view which you have of the Revolution in France, and of the  
political state of things in Europe, especially those of Great Britain, has enabled  
yo £6 form a judgment, with so much more accuracy than I could do, of the  
probable result of the perturbated state of the countries which compose that  
quarter of the globe, and of the principal actors on that theatre, that it would be  
présumptuous in me, at the distance of 3,000 miles, to give an opinion relatively  
  
: to either men or measures ; and therefore I will proceed to the information re-  
  
uired in your private letter of the 11th of September, which I will give from  
the best knowledge I possess, and with the candor you have a right to expect  
from me.  
  
The United States, as you well know, are very extensive—more than 1,500  
miles between the north-eastern and south-western extremities—all parts of  
  
which, from the sea-board to the Apalachian Mountains, (which divide the east-  
  
ern from the western waters,) are entirely settled, though not as compactly as  
they are capable of, and settlements are progressing rapidly beyond them.  
ithin so great a space, you are not to be told that there is great variety of  
climates ; and you will readily suppose, too, that there are all sorts of land, dif-  
ferently improved and of various prices, according to the quality of the soil ; its

contiguity to, or remoteness from, navigation ; the nature of the improvements;  
and other local circumstances. These premises, however, are only sufficient for  
the formation of a general opinion, for there are material deviations, as I shall  
mention hereafter.  
  
In the New-England States, and to Pennsylvania inclusively, landed property  
is more divided than it is in the States south of them. The farms are smaller,  
the buildings and other improvements, generally better, and of consequence the  
population is greater. But, then, the climate, especially to the eastward of Hud-  
son “iver, is cold, the winters long, consuming a great part of the summer’s la-  
bor in support of their stocks durimg the winter. Nevertheless, it is a country  
abounding in grass, and sells much fine beef, besides exporting many horses to  
the West Indies. A mildew or blight (1 am speaking now of the New-England  
States particularly) prevents them from raising wheat adequate to their own.  
consumption ; and of other grains they export little or none, fish being their sta-  
ple. They live well, notwithstanding, and are a happy people. Their numbers  
are not augmented by foreign emigrants, yet from their circumscribed limits,  
compact situation, and natural population, they are filling the western parts of  
the State of New-York, and the country on the Ohio, with their own surplusage.  
  
New-Jersey is a small State, and all parts of it, except the south-western, are  
pleasant, healthy, and productive of all kinds of grain, &amp;c. Being surrounded  
on two sides by New-York, and on the other two by Delaware River and the  
Atlantic, it has no land of its own to supply the surplus of its population ; of  
course their emigrations are principally toward the Ohio.  
  
Pennsylvania is a large State, and from the policy of its founder, and of the  
Government since, and especially from the celebrity of Philadelphia, has become  
the general receptacle of foreigners from all countries, and of all descriptions,  
many of whom soon take an active part in the politics of the State ; and coming  
over full of prejudices against their own Governments—some against all Goy-  
ernments—you will be enabled, without any comment of mine, to draw your  
own inference of their conduct.  
  
Delaware is a very small State, the greater part of which lies low, and is sup-  
posed to be unhealthy. ‘The eastern shore of Maryland is similar thereto. The  
lands in both, however, are good.  
  
But the western parts of the last-mentioned State, and of Virginia, quite to  
the line of North Carolina, above tide water, and more especially above the Blue  
Mountains, are similar to those of Pennsylvania between the Susquehanna and  
Potomac Rivers, in soil, climate and productions, and, in my opinion, will be  
considered, if it is not considered so already, as the garden of America; foras-  
much as it lies between the twoextremes of heat and cold, partaking in a de-  
gree of the advantages of both, without feelimg much the inconveniences of  
either, and with truth it may be said, is among the most fertile lands in America,  
east of the Apalachian Mountains.  
  
The uplands of North and South Carolina and Georgia are not dissimilar in  
soil, but as they approach the lower latitudes, are less congenial to wheat, and  
are supposed to be proportionally more unhealthy. ‘Toward the sea-board of all  
the Southern States, (and farther south the more so,) the country is low, sandy,  
and unhealthy ; for which reason I shall say little concerning them; for, as I  
should not choose to be an inhabitant of them myself, I ought not to say anything  
that would induce others to be so.  
  
This general description is furnished, that you may be enabled to form an idea  
of the part of the United States which would be most congenial to your inclina-  
tion. To pronounce with any degree of precision what lands could be obtained  
for in the parts I have enumerated, is next to impossible, for the reasons I have  
before assigned ; but upon pretty good data it may be said that those in Pe l-  
vania are higher than those in Maryland, (and I believe in any other State,) de-  
clining in price as you go southerly, until the rice-swamps of South Carolina  
and Georgia are met with, and those are as much above the medium in price as  
they are below it in health. I understand, however, that from 30 to 40 dollars  
per acre (I fix on dollars because they apply equally to al? the States, and be~ _  
cause their relative value to sterling is wel! understood) may be denominated  
the medium price in the vicinity of the Susquehanna, in the State of Penosyl-  
vania ; from 20 to 30 on the Potomac, in what is called the valley—that is, lying

between the North Mountain and the Blue Mountain, which are the richest  
lands we have, and less, as I have noticed before, as you proceed southerly. But  
what may appear singular, and was alluded to in the former part of this letter,  
the lands in the parts of which I am now speaking, on and contiguous to tide-  
water, (with local exceptions,) are in lower estimation than those which are  
above and more remote from navigation. The causes, however, are apparent—  
1. The land is better; 2. Higher and more healthy ; 3. They are chiefly, if not  
altogether, in the occupation of farmers; 4. From a combination of all of them,  
=—- are attracted, and of consequence the price rises in proportion to the  
emand.  
  
The rise in the value of landed property, in this country, has been progressive  
ever since my attention has been turned to the subject, (now more than 40 years, )  
but for the last three or four of that period it has increased beyond all calcula-  
tion ; owing it part to the attachment to, and the confidence which the people  
are beginning to place in their form of Government, and to the prosperity of the  
country from a variety of concurring causes—none more than to the late high  
prices of its produce.  
  
From what I have said, you will have perceived that the present prices of  
land in Pennsylvania are higher than they are in Maryland and Virginia, although  
they are not of superior quality. ‘Two reasons have already been assigned for  
this: first, that in the settled part of it the land is divided into smaller farms,  
and more improved ; and, secondly, being in a greater degree than any other the  
receptacle of emigrants, these receive the first impressions in Philadelphia, and  
rarely look beyond the limits of the State; but besides these, two other causes  
not a little operative may be added, namely, that until Congress passed general  
laws, relative to naturalization and citizenship, foreigners found it easier to ob-  
tain the privileges announced to them in that State than elsewhere ; and because  
there are laws here for the gradual abolition of slavery, which neither of the two  
States above mentioned have at present, but which nothing is more certain than  
that they must have, and at a period not remote.  
  
Notwithstanding these obstacles, and although I may incur the charge of par-  
tiality in hazarding such an opinion, at this time, I do not hesitate to pronounce  
that the lands on the waters of Potomac will in a few years be in greater demand  
and in higher estimation than in any other part of the United States. But as I  
ought not to advance this doctrine without assigning reasons for it, I will re-  
quest you to examine a general map of the United States, and the following facts  
will strike you at first view: That they lie in the most temperate latitude of the  
United States ; that the main river runs in a direct course to the expanded part  
of the western country, and approximates nearer to the principal branches of  
the Ohio than any other eastern water, and of course must become a great, if  
not (under all circumstances) the best highway into that region ; that the upper  
seaport of the Potomac is considerably nearer to a large portion of the State of  
Pennsylvania than that portion is to Philadelphia, besides accommodating the  
settlers thereof with inland navigation for more than 200 miles; that the ama-  
‘zing extent of tide navigation afforded by the bay and rivers of Chesapeake has  
‘scarcely a parallel. When to these are added, that a site at the junction of the  
anland and tide navigations of that river is chosen for the permanent seat of the  
«General Government, and is in rapid preparation for its reception ; that the inland  
mavigation of the river is nearly completed to the extent above mentioned ; that  
its lateral branches are capable of great improvement at a small expense, through  
the most fertile parts of Virginia, in a southerly direction, and crossing Mary-  
Aand and extending into Pennsylvania in a northerly one, through which (inde-  
pendent of what may come from the western country) an immensity of produce  
will be water-borne, thereby making the Federal city the great emporium of the  
United States—I say when these things are taken into consideration, I am un-  
der no apprehension of having the opinion I have given relative to the value of  
dand on Sealine controverted by impartial men.  
  
There are farms always and everywhere for sale ; if, therefore, events should  
induce you to cast an eye toward America, there need be no apprehension of  
your being accommodated to your liking: and if I could be made useful to you  
therein, you might command my services with the greatest freedom.

## [From _The Monthly Journal of Agriculture, Containing the Best Current Productions in Promotion of Agricultural Improvement, Including the Choicest Prize Essays Issued in Europe and America. With Original Contributions from Eminent Farmers and Statesmen (1845-1848)_](https://archive.org/details/sim_monthly-journal-of-agriculture_1847-04_2_10/page/n4/mode/1up?view=theater)

of the most beautiful seats on the river, for sale, but of greater magnitude than  
  
ou seem to have contemplated. 1t is called Belvoir, and did belong to George  
William Fairfax, Esq., who, was he living, would now be Baron of Cameron, as  
his younger brother in this country (George William dying without issue) at  
present is, though he does not take on himself the title.  
  
This seat was the residence of the above named gentleman before he went to  
England, and was accommodated with very good buildings, which were burned  
soon after he left them. There are near 2,000 acres of land belonging to the  
tract, surrounded in a manner by water. The mansion-house stood on high and  
commanding ground. The soil is not of the first quality, but a considerable part  
of it lying level may, with proper management, be profitably cultivated. There  
are some small tenements on the estate, but the greater part thereof is in wood.  
At present it belongs to Ferdinando Fairfax, son of Bryan Fairfax, the gentle-  
man who will not, as I said before, take upon himself the title of Baron of Cam-  
eron. &lt;A year or two ago the price he fixed on the land was (as I have been in-  
formed) 333 dollars per acre ; whether not getting that sum, or whether he is  
no longer disposed to sell it, I am unable with precision to say ; for I have heard  
nothing concerning his intentions lately.  
  
With respect to the tenements I have offered to let, appertaining to my Mount  
Vernon estate, I can give no better description of them and of their appurten-  
ances, than what is contained in the printed advertisement herewith inclosed ;  
but, that you may have a more distinct view of the farms, and their relative  
situation to the mansion-house, a sketch from actual survey is also inclosed ; an-  
nexed to which I have given you, from memory, the relative situation and form  
of the seat at Belvoir.  
  
The terms on which I had authorized the superintendent of my concerns at  
Mount Vernon to lease the farms there, are also inclosed ; which, with the other  
papers and the general information herein detailed, will throw all the light I am  
enabled to give you upon the subject of your inquiry. ‘To have such a tenant as  
Sir John Sinclair, however desirable it might be, is an honor I dare not hope for ;  
and to alienate any part of the fee-simple estate of Mount Vernon is a measure  
I am not inclined to, as all the farms are connected and parts of a whole.  
  
With very great esteem and respect ! have the honor to be, Sir,  
Your most obedient and obliged h’ble servant, G. WASHINGTON.  
  
  
  
P.S. As I shall have an opportunity in the course of the present Session of  
Congress to converse with the members thereof from different States, and differ-  
ent parts of each State, I will write you a supplementary account, if essential  
information should be obtained in addition to, or corrective of, what is given to  
you in the aforegoing sheets

&quot;From what I have said, you will  
perceive that the present price of  
lands in Pennsylvania are higher  
than they are in Maryland and Vir­  
ginia, although they are not of a  
superior quality. Two reasons have  
already been assigned for this: First,  
that in the settled part of it, the land  
is divided into smaller farms and  
more improved; and secondly, it is  
in a greater degree than any other,  
the receptacle of emigrants, who  
receive their first impressions in Phil­  
adelphin and rarely look look beyond  
the limits of the State. But, besides  
these two other causes, not a little  
operative, may be added, namely,  
that until Congress passed general  
laws relative to naturalization and  
citizenship, foreigners found it easier  
to obtain the privileges annexed to  
them in this State than elsewhere,  
and because thera are laws here for  
the gradual abotition of slavery,  
which neither of these two States  
above mentioned have at present, but  
which nothing is more certain than  
that they must have, and at a period  
not remote. Writings, vol 13 p.

The Buchanters are constantly

the People&#x27;s party are seeking such  
a conclusion. Their whole argu­

der-to better acquaint himself with=   
our then new born and free Republic, he addressed   
a letter to President: Washington, inquiring as to   
the most desirable section of our country to locate   
.   
or reside 311.   
  
P 1 eeitient Washington&#x27;s reply bears date Phila­  
delphia, 1 iih December, 1796, from which I desire to   
matte a few extracts pertinent to the question now   
engrossing- the mind of every &quot;Unconditional Union   
man&quot; in our State. After enumerating several   
States in particular, and all in general, he says:   
&quot;This mere] descsiption is furnished that you may   
to enabled to form Ll&#x27; rled   
States which would be most congenial to y.ne incli­  
nation. To pronounce with any degree of precision   
what lands could be obtained for in the parts I have   
enumerated is next to impossible, for the reasons I   
have before assigned; but upon pretty good data it   
may be said that those in Pennsylvania are higher   
than those in Maryland (and, I believe, in any other   
State), declining in price as you 90 southerly until the   
rice swamps of South Carolina and Georgia are met   
with, and those are as much above the medium In   
&#x27;nice as they are below it in health.   
&quot;1 undostand, however, that from $3O to $4O per   
acre may be denominated the medium price in the   
vicinity, of the Susquehanna, in the State of Penn­  
sylvania ;-from $2O to $3O on the Potomac, in what   
is called the Vidley—that is, lying between the   
North Mountain and the Blue Mountain—which are   
the tidiest lands we have ,• and less, as I have no­  
ticed before, as you proceed southerly. From what   
I have said, you will have perceived that the pre­  
sent prices of land in Pennsylvania are higher than   
they are in Maryland and -Virginia, although they­  
arenetof&gt; superior quality.   
&quot; TWo reasons have already been assigned for this :   
first, that in the settled part of it the land is divided   
into smaller farms, and more improved; and,   
secondly, being in a greater degi ee than any other,   
the ieceptacle of emigrants, these receive the first   
impressions in Philadelphia, and rarely look beyond   
the limits of the State; but besides these, two other   
causes not a little operative, may be added, namely   
that until Congress passed general laws relative to.   
naturaiization and citizenship, foreigners found it   
easier to obtain the privilege announced to them in   
that State than elsewhere; and, because, there are   
laws here for the gradual abolition of slavery, which   
neither of the two States above mentioned have at   
present, but which nothing is more certain than   
that they must have,,and at a period not remote.&quot;

owing in part to the attachment to, and the confi-

&quot;The United States, as you well know, are  
very extensive. More than 1,500 miles be­  
tween the Northeastern and Southwest­  
ern extremities. * * Within ho grout a  
space you are not to be told there is a great  
variety of climates ; and you will readily  
suppose, too, that there are all sorts of  
lands differently improved, and of various  
prices, according to the quality of the soil,  
its contiguity to, aud remoteness from, nav­  
igation, the nature of the improvements,  
and other local circumstances, f n the New  
England States, and to Pennsylvania, in­  
clusively, landed property is more divided  
than it uin the States south of them. The  
farms are smaller, the buildings and other  
improvements, generally better anil of con­  
sequence the population is greater. Hut,  
then, the climate, especially to the east­  
ward of the Hudson River, is cold, the  
winters long, consuming a great part of the  
summers labor in support of their stocks  
during the winter, &amp;c. * * Pennsylvan­  
ia is a largo State, and from the policy of  
its founder, and of the goFernment since  
and especially from the celebrity of Phila­  
delphia, has become the general receptacle  
of foreigners from all countries and of all  
descriptions. Delaware is a very small  
State, the greater part of which lies low,  
and is supposed to be unhealthy. The  
Eastern shore of Maryland is similar there­  
to. The land in both, however, are good.  
Hut the Western parts of the last mentioned  
State, and of Virginia, quite to the line of  
North Carolina above tide water, and more  
especially above the Blue Mountains, are  
similar to those of Pennsylvania between  
the Susquehanna and Potomac rivers, in  
soil, climate and productions, and, in my  
opinion will be considered, il* it is not con­  
sidered so ahead;/, as the Garden of  
America for as much as it lies between  
the two extremes of heat and cold partak­  
ing in a degree of the advantages of both,  
without feeiing much the inconveniences  
of cither, and with truth it may be said,  
is among the most fertile lands in America,  
east of the Apalachian Mountains. The  
uplands of North and South Carolina and  
(ieorgia are not dissimilar in soil, but as  
they approach the lower latitudes, one less  
congenial to wheat, and are supposed to be  
proportionately more unhealthy, &amp;c.  
VVrhat may appear singular, the lands be­  
tween the North .Mountains and the Blue  
Mountains, which are the richest lands we  
have, are in lower estimation than those  
which are above and more renmte from  
navigation. The causes, however, are aj&gt;­  
parent. Ist. The land is better. 3d. High­  
er and more healthy, lid. They are chief­  
ly in the hands of formers. -Hit. From a  
combination of all of them, purchasers are  
attracted, and of consequence the prices  
rises iv proportion to the demand. From  
what I have said, you will have per­  
ceived that the presont prices of land in  
Pennsylvania are higher than thoy are in  
Maryland and Virginia, although they are  
not of superior quality. Two reasons have  
already been assigned for this: first, that in  
the settled part oi it, the land is divided in­  
to smaller farms, and more improved, and,  
secondly, being iv a greater degree than  
any other, the receptielc of emigraids, these  
recoive their first impressions in Philadel­  
phia, and rarely look beyond the limits of  
the State. Besides these, two other causes  
not a little operative may be added, one of  
which was that foreigners found it easier to  
obtain the privileges announced to them in  
that State, than elsewhere, and because  
there arc laws here for the gradual aboli­  
tion of slavery, which neither of the two  
States above mentioned have at present,  
but which nothing is more certain than they  
■must have at a period, nut remote.  
Notwithstanding, I do not hesitate to pro­  
nounce that the lands ou the waters of the  
Potomac, (its tributariesofcour.se included)  
will in a few years be in greatei demand,  
aud in higher estimation, than in any other  
part of the United Slates. But, as I ought  
not to advance this doctrine, without giving  
sufficient reasons for it, I will request you  
to examine a general map of the United  
States, and the following facts will strike  
you at first view. That they lie in the  
most temperate latitude of the United  
States, that the Main river runs iv a direct  
course to tho extended part of the Western  
counties, and approximates nearer to tho  
principal branches of the Ohio, than any  
other eastern water, aud, of course, mutt  
become a great, if not, (under all circum­  
stauces) the best highway into that legion,  
that the upper seaport of the Potomac, is  
considerably nearer to a large portion of  
Pennsylvania, than that-portion is to Phila­  
delphia, besides accommodating the settlei.  
thereof with inland navigation for more  
than two hundred miles. That the amaz­  
ing extent of tide navigation allbrded by  
the bay and rivers of Chesapeake has  
scarcely a parallel. When to those are  
added, that a site at the junction of tlie  
inland and tide navigations of that river is  
chosen for the permanent seat of the gene­  
ral government, that the inland navigation  
of the river is nearly completed to tlie ex­  
tent above mentioned, that its lateral  
branches are capable of great improvement  
at a small expense, through the most fer­  
tile parts of Virginia in a southerly direc­  
tion, and coming Maryland in a northerly  
one, through which an immensity of pro­  
duce will be water borne, and I say, when  
these things are taken into consideration, 1  
am under no apprehension of having the  
opinion I have given relative to the value  
of land on the Potomac, (in Virginia) con­  
troverted by impartial men.

ginia to the North Carolina line above tide  
\\ater, and more especially above the Blue  
Kidge mountaius are very similar to those of  
Pennsylvania between the Susnuehana and  
Potomac rivers, in soil, climate and production,  
and in my opinion will be considered, if not  
considered already so, tlw Gnrdcn of America,  
inasmuch as it lies between the two extremes of  
IbXit a ml culd, partaking in a degree of the ad­  
vantages of both, without feeling much the in­  
convenience of either, and with truth it may  
said, isamonff the most fertile lands in America  
east of the Apalachian mountains. The up­  
lands of North and South Carolina and Geor- j  
gia are not dissimilar in soil, but as they ap­  
proach the lower latitudes, are less congenial to  
wheat, and are supposed to be proportionally  
more unhealthy. But what may appear singu­  
lar the lands iu the parts of which I am now  
referring to, on and contiguous to tide water  
(with local exceptions) are in lower estimation  
than those which are above and more remote  
from navigation. The causes, however, are ap­  
parent. : 1st. the land is better; 2d, higher and  
more healthy; ild, they are chiefly, if not al­  
together, in the occupation of farmers; 4th,  
from a combination of all these, purchasers are  
attracted, and of consequence, the price rises  
iu proportion to the demand. Prom what I  
have said you will have perceived that the  
present prices of laud in Pennsylvania and New  
Kngland States are higher than they are in  
Maryland and Yirgiuia, although they are not  
of superior quality. Two reasous have already  
been assigned for this, first, in the settled parts  
of it the land is divided iuto smaller farms and  
more improved as a consequence, and secondly,  
being in a greater degree than any other, the  
reciptacle of emigrants, they receive their first  
impression in Philadelphia, and rarely look  
beyond the limits of the State. But besides  
these, two other causes, not a little operative,  
may be added, namely, that until Congress  
passed general laws, relative to naturalization  
and citizenship, foreigners found it easier to  
obtain the privileges announced to them in that  
State than elsewhere, and because there are  
laws there for the gradual abolition of slavery,  
which neither of the two States above rneu­  
tioued, Maryland and Virginia,have at present,  
but which nothing is more certaiu than that  
they must have.andat a period not remote. Not­  
withstanding these obstacles, and I do not hesi­  
tate to pronounce, that the lands on the waters  
of the Potomac,will, in a few years, be in great­  
er demand and in higher estimation than in  
any other part of the United States. But as I  
ouuht not to advance this doctriue without as­  
signing reasons for it, I will request you to  
examine a general map of the United States  
and the following facts will stiike you at first  
view: That Maryland and Virginia lie in the  
most temperate latitude of the United States;  
that the main river, the Potomac, runs in a di  
rect course to the expanded parts of the We.-t­  
crn country, and approximates, nearer to the  
principal branches of the Ohio than any other  
eastern waters, and of course must become a  
great, if not (under all circumstances) the best  
highway into that region; that the upper sea­  
port of the Potomac is considerably nearer to a  
large portion of the State of Pennsylvania  
than that portion is to Philadelphia, besides,  
accommodating the settlers thereof with inland  
navigation for more than 200 miles; that the  
amazing extent of fide navigation afforded by  
the bay and rivers of the Chesapeake has scarce­  
  
Jy a parallel.  
jThe &quot;upper seaport&quot; of the Potomac here  
spoken of is our own beloved city of Alexan

These are the opinions and views of Gen.

County of Londonderry in Ireland and at the  
present day the great bulk of tho Valley  
people are either North of Ireland people or  
descendants of people from the North of Ire­  
land. The lands in the Valley are much  
more fertile and productive than the lands  
in Eastern Virgiuia. George Washington  
in his report to Sir John Sinclair in 1700,  
writes “The western parts of Virginia more  
especially above the Blue mountains in my  
opinion will be considered, if not considered  
so already,as the “garden of Americafor­  
asmuch as it lic3 between the two extremes  
of heat and cold, partaking in a degree of  
the advantages of both,without feeling much

it may be said, is among the most fertile  
lands in America east of the Appalachian  
mountains.” In another place he writes  
“The Valley lands are the richest we have.”  
In 1870 Burrit writes “This Valley is one of  
the most beautiful, fertile and delightful re­  
gions on the American Continent.”  
To investors in land the present prices in  
Virginia are most tempting; large tracts may  
be purchased, and if retained in hand for a  
short time would quadruple in value. But  
apart from the land itself, it is important to  
observe that mineral wealth lies beneath,  
which some day will yield a ducal revenue  
to those who have the foresight to become  
owners thereof. The mineral

During rhe political troubles in E;g)end  
in 1796 Sir John Sinclair, the founder and  
firat President of the British Bjard of Agri?  
culture, thinking of emigrating to this  
country, wrote to Gen. Waehington for in­  
formation, and iu his rrp&#x27;y ocoars the fol­  
bwhig desoiiptlon pf itiH bistor&#x27;c plaoa.  
&quot;Within foil view of Mr. Vernon, sep?  
arated tberefrcm by water ouly, isone of the  
most beautiful sea&#x27;s on the river for Bale,  
but of greater magnitude than you seem to  
have contemplated. It is oailed Belvoir,  
and did belong to George William Fair/ax,  
e-q . who, was be living, would be Baron of  
Cameron, aa his younger brother in tbia  
country (George William djing without it­  
sue) at present I?, rhcugh be does no take cn  
himself the title. This Beat was the resi?  
dence of tbo above named gentleman before  
he went to England, and was accororno  
dated with very good buildings, wbioh were  
burned Boon after he left them. There are  
nearly 2.000 acrea of land belonging to the  
tract, surrounded in a manner by water.  
The maneion house stood on high and com?  
manding ground. The soil ia cot of the  
first quality, but a oonsideraole part  
of it lying level may with proper  
management be profitably cultivated.  
There are some small tenements on the es?  
tate, but the greater part of it is In wood,  
At present it belongs to Ferdinande Fairfax,  
son of Bryan Fairfax, the gentleman who  
will not, aa I said before, take upon himself  
the title of Baron of Oameron. A year or  
two ago tbe price he fixed on the land, was  
(as I have been informed) $33J per acre.  
Whether not getting that sum or whether he  
is no longer disposed to sell it, I am uoable  
to say, for I have beard nothing concerning  
bia intentions lately. With respect to the  
tenement I have offered to let appertaining  
to my Mount Vernon estate, I can give no
