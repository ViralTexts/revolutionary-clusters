We have seen in the Gazette on Monday last, the result, as given under the Paris head of August the 8th, of the negociation between our Commissioners and the French Government. It seems, it has failed, and is for the present, suspended, the reasons of which are assigned. This account of the matter, tho without an official stamp, has strong marks of being an enunciation by authority of the French government.  
It is not improbable, that the leading points in the statement are true; and considering the quarter from which it comes, and the views to be answered, it is not deficient in moderation. There are, however some discolourings, and several artful terms, of a nature to mislead the public opinion of this country, which may require an antidote by a fair explanation. This shall be offered.  
After a preliminary view of the subjects discussed in the negociation, it is stated in the sequel, that “the negociation turned on three points.”  
1. The continuance in force, or the modified renewal of the Treaty of 1778.  
  
This point (it is alledged) was waved by France, in consequence of the assurance of our envoys that they could not renew it.  
2. The principle of compensation for illegal captures.  
This point (it is said) France offered to admit. But on conditions only that the Treaty of 1778 should be renewed, with the modifications contained in the instructions given by Washington.  
3. The 25th article of the Treaty between the United States and Great-Britain, relative to the protection granted to the armed vessels of that nation.  
France (it is said) will probably insist upon enjoying the same advantage as long as it is possessed to her injury by her enemy.  
It is mentioned as supplementary, that  
“There is another principle which France was anxious to establish, namely, That neutral bottoms should constitute neutral property.” But that our treaty of 1798, with Great Britain, prevented our acceding to this system.  
  
On the very face of the statement, as to the two first points, we discover a stroke of French finesse.  
France, it is pretended waved the point of a continuance of modified renewal of the treaty of 1778, upon the assurance of our Envoys that they could not renew it: Yet we are informed in the next sentence that acceding to the principle of compensation for illegal captures, she did it upon the express condition only that the treaty of 1778 should be renewed with modifications.  
That is to say, she waved the modified renewal of the treaty of ’78, upon the condition that the United States would wave their claim of compensation for illegal captures—a claim by herself admitted to be just.  
This, it must be confessed, was an odd method of waving. It was more properly an attempt to barter a bad debt for a good one, a nullity (in other words a treaty which for these very illegal captures in violation of it, and for other injuries had been rightfully declared void) for a valid claim equal to 20,000,000 of dollars.  
The argument by which it is intended to color this subterfuge is this:  
“That as the twin nations had never been in a state of war with each other, the treaty of 1778 could not have been annuled without the consent of both.”  
  
But there is not a writer on the law of nations, who will not inform the French Government, that when one party to a treaty violates the compact in any material article, the other party is free to annul the whole.  
France, before she had the least pretence of complaint against the U. States, had infringed the Treaty in some of its essential points especially the famous provision now again so much vaunted, that neutral bottoms shall constitute neutral property; and she went on increasing her violations down to the period of abrogating the treaty in this country: than which no national measure was ever justified by more cogent reasons.  
But it isserted that this treaty is the only basis of our claim to compensation. This position is as unfounded as the other.  
France, in her revolutionary phrenzy, denied the existence of a Law of Nations. Returned (as is hoped) to reason, she at present recognizes that law, and promises to be governed by it.  
Then, as the greater part of the captures of which we complain were unjust and illegal; not by the peculiar stipulations of the treaty of ’73, but by the general law of Nations—it is plain that as to them our claim to compensation is independent of, and paramount to the treaty.  
It follows that the ground which has been taken by France, in this particular, is untenable.  
Further—as to the 25th article of the treaty, between the United States and Great-Britain, relative to the protection granted to the armed vessels of that nation.  
Towards a clear understanding of this point it may be necessary to remind the public of some facts:  
Our treaty with France already mentioned in the 17th article, contains stipulations equivalent to the 25th article of our treaty with Great-Britain.  
As this article has an express saving of prior existing treaties, France was left by the treaty with Great-Britain in full posessession of the privileges in this respect which our treaties with them had granted.  
The consequence was that France being at war with Great-Britain, might bring prizes made from the latter, into our ports, while British ships could not enter with prizes made from France. France, therefore, had no cause to complain of the article in question. It left her where she was before, and with a privilege not enjoyed by Great-Britain.  
  
If the case is now altered, and Great-Britain has acquired the preference which before belonged to France—it is by accident, or, more properly speaking, by the fault of France, whose violence drove our government to the abolition of our treaty with her—thereby transferring to our treaty with Great-Britain, the advantages of priority, which formerly were attached to our treaty with France.  
This priority, therefore occasioned by the misconduct of France, ought not to have been an obstacle to the formation of a treaty with us, which, in other respects, should have been the same as our treaty with Great-Britain. And doubtless it will appear hereafter, that our Envoys were authorised to offer, and did offer, such a treaty.  
This circumstance ought the less to have been an obstacle, because the 25th is one of the articles of our Treaty with Great-Britain, which, by its own limitation, will expire in 12 years after the making of it, that is, in the year 1807.  
Again—As to the principle, that neutral bottoms should make neutral property, which, it is said, France was anxious to establish—  
It is not true, as alledged, that our treaty with Great-Britain was an impediment to our establishing that principle with France; unless it was meant to do more than was done by the treaty of 1778.  
It is clearly shewn by Mr. Jefforson, in his correspondence on the subject, and has been otherwise amply demonstrated, that this treaty did nothing more than adopt the principle as a rule to be observed, between the United States and France, with regard to each other when one was at peace, the other at war—that it did not bind either party to enforce or insist upon the rule as against other nations.  
If more was desired by France at this time; if it was meant that we were to agree to insist upon the rule as against other nations—it is evident that this was nothing more nor less than an attempt to involve us in war with Great Britain.  
As a violation of our treaty with her, this would have been the natural consequence; as an attempt to change, by force, the present law of nations in a point which she is deeply interested to maintain, the same consequence was to be expected.  
  
This would be another specimen of the old policy—War with Great Britain, as the price of friendship with France.  
It is not unlikely that our Envoys have been instructed to decline in any shape, the stipulation, that neutral bottoms should make neutral property; and if they were, the instruction was a perfectly wise one.  
Experience has shewn, in the conduct of France herself towards the United States, that is a stipulation not to be relied upon; too contrary to the spirit of maratime war to be observed—and that the most probable effect of making it, will always be to introduce a germ of contention between the parties to the contract. It has been a cause of extreme embarrassment to us in the prese[n]t war.  
An unwillingness to repeat the experiment of this contentious innovation, ought certainly to have been no obstacle to a Treaty with the very power which has given us proof that it was worse than nothing, and taught us the necessity of distrusting it.  
Hence we perceive the unreasonableness and futility of the ostensible motives which, on the part of France, have obstructed a treaty with the United States.  
Let us now conjecture the true reasons of the failure of negociation. They were—1. The hope that an unsettled state of things between the two countries might favor, in the approaching election of Chief Magistrate the choice of person more complaisant to the views of France, namely Mr. Jefferson. 2. The expectation that with him a bargain more advantageous to France would be made than with our present executive.  
Will the people of the United States be the dupes of this scheme? Will they think it their interest to elevate to the head of the Government a man with whom France expects to make such a bargain as will suit her purpose, after the repeated proofs they have had of the wish of France to entangle them in her interest, and embroil them with other nations? Why should they do this.  
Things are now upon a good footing. A treaty, it is true, has not been made: but if we are to credit the French statement, their depredations on our commerce are to cease, and our neutral rights are in future to be respected. It is therefore in our option to have peace in fact with France, though not by treaty; and if she keeps her word (the only security a Treaty would give us) we shall be as well off (except in the article of compensation for captures) as if a treaty had been made.  
In little more than six years the parts of our treaty with Great Britain respecting external commerce and navigation will expire. We can then stand both with France and her upon new ground, and, it is matter of indifference whether we ever again have a commercial treaty with either of them, unless upon better terms than heretofore. The trade between us and them may as well be left to regulate itself till bargains more positively advantageous for us can be made.  
The getting rid, on fair ground, of the Guarantee of the French West Indies in our Treaty of Alliance with France, is a point of substantial interest gained to the U. States.  
We observe that an attempt was made to revive this Guarantee in a qualified form; whether this revival was urged as an ultimatum or not does not appear. It is probable that it has been a very serious point with France. And the reasons which induce her to desire it, ought to induce the United States to avoid it. The Guarantee as it formerly stood, would have engaged this Country in every maratime war in which France was a defensive party. Commuted for a pecuniary aid, it would cost them a large sum of money in every such case, and would be hazardous to their peace.  
President Washington wisely proposed the substitute when the treaties were yet in force. But France would not then listen to the moderate prepositions of this great man. Now, that the treaties are at an end, in consequence of French aggressions, we ought not voluntarily to resume so serious an incumbrance. It would be far better for the United States to compensate their own citizens for losses by French spoliations.  
On this head it is to be observed, That nothing more than a promise of compensation could at present have been expected from France, with the best intentions on our part. The state of her finances does not permit more. The enjoyment of the boon must have been in future. In all probability, by patience and perseverance a more convenient opportunity will occur for a favorable settlement of the matter, and early enough to meet the resources of France for payment.  
In the interim, let our government take preparatory measures; such as will thoroughly sift and ascertain the claims which ought to be compensated; and by this expedient the affair will be refined for definitive negociation, and little, if any time, will be lost.  
As to the rest, a single and obvious course of conduct presents itself. Let hostilities on the part of the United States cease, and let the two countries pass into a state of peace in fact on the basis of the laws of nations. In this position it will be seen whether France is sincere, and at the same time able to execute her assurance that our rights, as a neutral nation, will hereafter be respected.  
But in doing this, let us take care that we are not found hereafter unprepared. Let effectual measures be taken to increase our means of future resistance; if again we shall be compelled to protect our rights and defend our commerce by force. The posture of Europe is still eventful—eventful beyond all human calculation. Absurd indeed must be that American who will rest the safety of his country on any other foundation than her own ability to repel violence.

We have seen in the Gazette of Monday &lt;  
last the refiilt, as given und«r the Pans head I  
of August the&quot; sifr, of (he negofciStfon be­  
twcen our Commidinners and the Fiench j  
jr-jyerHment. It teems, it has failed, and is  
for the present, fufpcnded, the reafoiu of  
which are afligned. This account of tl-,e  
matter, though without an official ilim p5  
has Orong marks of b«ing an enunciation by  
authority of the French Government.  
It is not improbable, that the le /ding  
points in the rtatement are true ; and con­  
sidering the quarter from which iv comer,  
and the views to he answered, it :&lt;s not f*,e-  
Gcierit in moderation. There are, howt&#x27;vT,  
some difcolourings, and several arrful  
of a nature to milleid the public opi;yjon of  
this country, which insy require a:i &#x27;jiytidote  
hya fair explanation, 1 his (hall he offered.  
After a preliminary view of t&#x27;llc fobjeftj  
difculTed in the negociation, i 4 stated in  
the frquel, that &quot; the negocif_tjon turned or  
three points.&quot; i  
1. The conUßiianc* ir, force, or the mo- \
ditied renewal of the t&#x27;.eaty of 1778.  
Tcis (it ii&#x27;alledged) was waved by j  
France, in of the affuranre oi |  
ou* envoys, they could not renew it. j  
2. The pr.nciple of compmfation for il- j  
legal fciftirret.  
Tins -point (it is nid) France offered to |  
admfc. But 011 condition only that the treaty ,  
nj 1 778 should be rcnezcedj with tiie modi- ,  
&#x27;coitions contained in the inftru&amp;ions given  
by Wafhiligton.  
j. The 25th article of the 1 reaty, bet­  
wee;&#x27; the United States and Great-Britain,  
relative to the proteflion grafted to the arm­  
ed veffcls of that nation.  
France, it- is f.-id, wiH pnbabty infill up­  
on enjoying the fame advantage as long as it  
is poffefledto her,injury by her enemy.  
It is mentioned as Utpplementa y, that  
&#x27;&#x27;There is another principle which France  
anxious to ejtablilh, namely, That ?teu­  
bottoms should constitute neutrdbfiro­  
■••.ertv.&quot; But that cur treaty of 179-3 with  
ijrest-Bi iuin prevented our acceding to this  
l&#x27;vftein. 1  
On the very face of the ftatemeiu, as to  
ttie two firPV points, we discover a stroke of  
frcmb jinestc.  
France, it is preten !ed, tvaved the point  
of&#x27;a continuance or modified renewal of the j  
treaty of 1778, upon the assurance of our ;  
envoys th.v. they could not renew it ;  
vet we are informed in the next sentence ,  
thai acied nf to the principles   
fation for illegal capture?, flit dd it up n  
the &#x27; express lOnJUion only that the treaty  
qf&#x27;72 fllouM be relieved with m ulilications. |  
  
That is to f.&#x27;.y, tUc pjved the mod&gt;k:2  
renewal of the treaty ot &gt;7B, upon the con­  
dition that the United States would wave  
tueir claim of cotuprnutio&#x27;i for Illag.ll cap­  
tures ; a d lira by hc» I&#x27;olt&quot; admitted to be jufl.  
This, it nm.fl be conlkflVdi was an oil I  
method of w.w%. ft was more proprrly  
an attempt to barter a bul debt tor a fteocl  
one, a nullity (m other words a treaty, wtiifh  
for these very c iptures in violation o!  
it, and&#x27;for other injuries, had been rii&#x27;Wul­  
ly declare.! void) for a valid claim equal to  
20-coo,ooo of dollars*  
i 1 The argument by which it is in ended to  
| colour this fubterfugc is this .- |  
j &quot; That as the two nation1&#x27; h d never  
j been in a llate of war with eaeh other, the  
j treaty of 1773 could not have been annul­  
j led without the consent of both.  
But there&#x27; is not a writer on the law of  
rations who will not inform the French  
Government, that when one party to a  
treaty violates the compaft in any material  
article, the other party is free to -nojil the  
whole.  
Fiance, before (lie had the lead p; etc nee  
of complaint againll ihe United States, had  
I infringed the treaty in some of its elTctiual  
I points especially in the famous provision  
now again much vaunted that neutral bottoms  
■ (hall conjlitue neutral properly; and (he  
went on, ii creafieg her violations down to  
the period of abrogating the treaty in this  
country ; than which no national meaiure  
was everjuftified bv more cogent reasons.  
But it is aflerted that this t-eaty is the  
oily bars of our claim 10 compenfatioti.  
Thii pofiition ia as unfounded as the  
ether. _  
France in her revolutionary phrenzy, de­  
nied the exitlence of a Law of Nations,  
i Returned (as is hoped) to reason, (lie it pre­  
: sent recognizes that law, and promises to be  
I governed by it.  
i Tlien, as the greater part ofthe captures  
I of which we complain were unjust and ille-  
I gal ;&#x27; not by the preculiar llipulations of the  
j treaty of 1778, hut, by the General L w  
of Nations— ii is plain that as to them our  
I claim to compenf a&#x27;tion is independant of,  
I and pa amount to the treaty.  
1 It follows, that the ground which has i  
been taken by France, in this particulxr, is j  
untenable. _ (  
Further—as to the 25th article of thy |  
treaty between the United Statel and Grf/at  
Britain, relative to the pretention grafted  
&#x27; to the armed veffeli of tho na.ion.  
j Towards a clear underllaoding 0/ th&#x27;s  
i pint, it may be neceflary to rera.nd the  
public of fuine faSs :   
Our treaty with France already mention­  
. ed. in th I||h article cot tains llipulations  
equivalent to the 55th article our treaty  
with Great Britian.  
As this artie&#x27;e ha 9 an ex.press favhg of  
prior existing treaties, F-.ance was left by  
the treaty with Great £ it an in lull pol­  
feffion of the privile gcS in this refpeft  
&#x27; which our treaties wr,th them hud granted.  
The cons quenc,, was th&lt;t France being

j ivhile Britilh ftips cauld not enter with pri­

I queilio:lt left her where (he was before,  
and w fih a pnviiege not er,joyed by Great-  
Brit  
I &#x27;/f the abuse ia now altered, and Grtat-  
B f&#x27;iiaTn has acquired the preference which  
|&#x27;*efor- b.-lpnged to France, it ii by acct-  
I dent. or. more properly fpeakiug, by the  
fault of France, whose yiolei#e drove oar  
■ government to the abolition of our treaty  
, with her -thereby tran.feriog to our treaty  
r with Great Britain, the advantages of prior­  
ity, which formerly were attached to oar  
; Treaty with France.  
This priority, therefore occaiioned by the  
, mifcondua of&#x27; France, ouglu not to have  
. been an obstacle to the formation of a ! rea­  
ty wi h us, which in other rtfpe&amp;a, ftiould  
&#x27; have been the fame as our Treaty with  
,f Great Britain. And doubtlels it will ap­  
« pear hereafter, that our K.,v yi were author­  
1. ifed to offer and did offer such a Trea­  
n i y Thi* cirnumftance ought the less to have |  
II I been an obstacle. because the 2Jth s one  
&#x27; „f the articles of our Treaty with Great-  
Britain whioh by its own limitation, will  
rx ire in twelve years after the making of  
it, that is, in the year 1807.  
Again—A» to the principle, that neutral  
&#x27; bottoms ihould make neutral property,  
which it ia said, France was anxious to ef­  
tab i(h.  
IT is not true, as alledged, that our 1 rea­  
&#x27; ty with Great-Britain was an impediment  
to our eftablifliing principle with  
Frtnce ; unless it was rreant to do more  
than was done by the Treaty of 177 N.  
It is clearly (hewn by Mr. Jefferfon, in  
his correspondence on the fubjeft, and has &#x27;  
been otherwise amply demonltrated, that  
this Treaty did nothing more than adopt  
the principle as a Rule to be observed, be­  
t tween the United States and Fiance, with  
rega d to each other when one was at peace,  
and the other at war ; that it did not bind

s .0 infill upon the rule as agninft other na  
tions ; it is evident that thia wa« nothing  
mo e nor less than an attempt to i.-,voW us  
in w.ir with Great-Britain.  
As a violation of our treaty with lur,

This would be ar,other specimen of the  
cldpolcy War -with Great Britain, at ihe

I It is 1.01 unlikely that our Er.voya have

Experience has (hewn, in the conduft of  
France herfelf towards the United States,  
that it is a llipulation not 10 be upon ;  
too contrary to the spirit ps maritime war  
to be obfeived, and that the probable eftert  
of making it, w.ll be always to introduce a  
germ of content ioobetween the parties to the  
contrail. It has been a cause of extreme  
embarrafTnent to us in the present war,  
  
Aii unwi lingnfcfs to repeatlthe experiment  
of this contentious innovatiw&gt;, &gt; ought cer­  
tainly to have been no obllacle to a treaty  
with the very power has given 1,9  
proof that it was iv tfr than nothing, and  
taught us the necessity-os distrusting it.  
Hence wc perceive the unreafonab&#x27;enels  
and futility of the offef.fiye which,  
on the part of Ftao,cpj have ob(lru£ted a  
treaty wtVb the United States.  
Let tiV now. conje£hir» the true reasons  
of the (allure of th,e •negocintion. They  
wer? —l. The hope that an unfeuted liate  
of things between the two.countries might   
favour in the approaching ele&amp;ion of Chief ;  
1 Magistrate, the choice of a person more |  
! comt&#x27;ilaifntrt to the view 3 of France, namely  
Mr.&#x27; Jeffcrfon.—2. The expedition that  
with him a bargain ropre advantageous to  
France would be made than with our pre­  
sent Executive.  
Will the people of tjit United States be  
the dupes of the scheme? Will they think  
it their interest to elevate to the head of the  
government a mari with wnom France ex­  
perts to make such a bargain as will suit  
her purpose, after th? repeated proofs they  
have had of the with of France to entangle  
ihem in her interests, and embroil them with  
oth-r nations ? Why should they do this.  
Things are now uimn n good footing.  
A treaty it is t.rue has not been made ; but  
if we aie toccredittt the Fiench ftatcment,  
their d*precUti«ns oil, our commerce are to  
cease, and oVr neutral rights are in future to  
be   
to have peace infect with France, though  
not by treaty ; and if (he keeps her word  
(t&#x27;.ie only security a treaty would give »s)  
zve lha!l be aa well off (except in the article  
of compensation for captures) as it a tre.ity  
In little more&quot; than fix years ih- pirts ot  
our treaty with Great-Britain refpeAingex­  
ternnal commerce and navigation will expire,  
i We can than Hand both with France and  
| Uer Mi new ground, and U is matter ot  
indifference whtthVr we ever again have a  
commercial treaty wtth either of them, un­  
less upt&gt;n better terms than heretotor:. ihe  
trade between us and them may as well be  
le:&#x27;t to re-ulate itfelf till bargains mote po­  
liticly advantageous tor us can be made.  
The jetting fid, on fair groui&#x27;d, ot the  
Kuaru.tee of the French Weft-Indies lit our  
treaty of aHianer with France, is a point ot  
fifcftantial interest&#x27; gained to tke United

We obferv* thii&#x27;sn attempt was made

France was a defepfive party. Commutes

large sum of money in every such cafe, and  
would be more or less hazardous to their  
  
Pepresident Walkington wifely propofo

in confcquence of the French aggr* ons  
we ought not voluntarily to refnmc lo ien

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
E have seen in the papers, the  
v ‘ Result, as given under the  
Paris head of Auguf? the 6th, of the  
Negotiation between our Commission­  
ers and the French Government. It  
seems, it has failed, and is for the  
present, suspended, the reasons of  
which are afligned. This account of  
the matter, though without an official  
stamp, has strong marks of being an  
annunciation by authority of the #7¢irch  
Government. -  
It is not improbable, that the lead-  
Ing points in the Statement are true ;  
and considering the quarter from  
which it comes, and the views to be  
answered, it is not deficient in modera­  
tion. There are, however some dif­  
colourings, and several artful terms,  
of 2 nature to mislead the public o­  
pinion of this country, which may  
require an antidote by a fair explana­  
tion. This shall be offered.  
After a preliminary view of the  
fubjedls difcufled in the Negotiation,  
it is stated in the sequel, that the  
negociation turned on three points.”  
1. The continuance in force, or the  
modified renewal of the Treaty of  
1778.  
7572&quot;8&amp;:&#x27;: point (it is alledged) was  
waved by France, in consequence of  
tbe assurance of our Envoys, that they  
could not renew it.  
2. The principle of compensation  
for illegal captures.—  
This point (it is said) France offer­  
ed to admit. But on condition onjy  
that the Treaty of 1778 should be renea­  
ed, with the modifications contained  
in the inftrutions given by Wasuing-  
TON. ’  
3- The 25th Article of the Treaty  
between the United States and Great  
&#x27;Britain,- relative to the proteétion  
granted to the armed veflels of that  
nation.  
France (it is said) will probably in­  
fitt upon enjoying the fame advan­  
tage as long asit is pofleffed to her in­  
jury by her enemy.  
Itis mentioned asfupplementary,that  
“ There is another principle which  
France was anxious to eftablith, name­  
ly, &lt; That neutral bottoms fball confii­  
tute neutral property” But that our  
Treaty of 1793, with Great-Britain,  
prevented our acccding to this system.  
On the very face of the statement,  
as to the two firft points, we discover  
a firoke of French finefe. &#x27;  
France, it is pretended avaved the  
point of a continuance or modified re­  
neawal of the treaty of 1778, upon the  
aflurance of our Envoys that they  
could not renew it : Yet we are in­  
formed in the next sentence that ac­  
ceding to the principle of compensa­  
tion for illegal captures, the did it up­  
on the express condition only that the  
treaty of 1778 should be renewed with  
modifications. ,  
  
That is to fay, the waved the modi­  
fied remewal of the treaty of *7B, up­  
on the condition that the United States  
would wave their claim of compensa­  
tion for illegal captures—a claim by  
herfelf admitted to be just. i  
This; it -mufl be confefled, was an  
odd method of awaving. It was more  
propérly an attempt to Jarzer a bad  
debt for a good one, a #nullity (in oth­  
er words a Zreafy which for those very  
illegal captures in violation of it, and  
for other injuries had been rightfully  
declared void) for a valid claim equal  
to 20,000,000 of dollars.  
. The argument by which it is in­  
tended to colour this fubterfuge is  
this :— 9 Pt  
¢ That as the two nations had never  
- been in a state of war with each other,  
the treaty of 1778 could not have  
~ been atnuled without the consent of  
- both.” G iRS ey  
~_But there is not a writer on the law

party 10 a treaty violates the compa

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

in afy thaterial article, the other party  
1s free to annul the whole.  
France, before she had the least pre­  
rence of complaint against the United  
States, had infringed the Treaty in  
some of its essential points efpecilly­  
n the famous provision now again o  
wwch vaunted, that neutral bottoms /baﬂ  
conflitute neusral property ; and she  
went on increasing her violations  
down to thaperiod of abrogating the  
treaty in this country 3 than which  
no national measure was ever jultined  
by more cogent reasons. :  
But it is asserted that this treaty is  
the only basis ¢f oir claim to com­  
pensation. This position ils as un­  
founded as the other.  
France, in her revolutionary phren­  
2y, denied the existence of a Law oF  
NaTions. Returned (asis hoped) to  
reason, she at present recognizes 2hat  
law, and promises 10 ke governed by  
it.  
Then, as the gréater part of the  
captures of which we complain were  
unjult and illegal ; not by the pe­  
culiatr stipulations of the Treaty of  
1778, but by the General Law of  
Nations—it is plain that as to them  
our claim to compensation is inde­  
pendent of, and paramiount to the  
Treaty. St  
It follows, that the ground which  
has been taken by France, in this par­  
ticular, is untenable.  
Further—as&#x27; to the 2 sts‘ article of  
the T&#x27;reaty between the (Miited States  
and Great-Britain, relative to the pro­  
te&amp;ion granted to the armed veflels of  
that nation.  
‘F&#x27;owards a clear understanding of  
this point, it may be neceflary to re­  
mind the public of fothe salts :  
Our treaty with France already  
tnentioned, in the 27th Article, con­  
tains stipulations equivalent to the  
25th Article of our Treaty with Great  
Britain;. : e :  
As this article has an exprels saving  
of prior exilting Treaties, I&#x27;rance was  
left by the Treaty with Great-Britain  
in full pofleflion of the privileges in  
this refpe&amp; which our Treaties with  
them had granted.  
The coniequence was that France  
being at war with Great-Britain,  
might bring prizes fmade from the  
latter, into our ports, while Biitith  
ships could not enter Wwith prizes made  
fiom France. France, therelore, had  
no cause to complain of the article in  
quefltion, It left her where she was  
before, and with a privilege not enjoy­  
‘ed by Great-Britain.  
If the case is now altered, and Great  
Britain has acquired the preference  
which before belonged to France—it  
is by aceident, or, more properly  
ipeaking, by the fault of France, whose  
violence drove our government to tlie  
abolition of our Treaty with her—  
thereby transferring to our Treaty  
“with Great-Britain, the advantages or  
“priority, which formerly were attach­  
ed to our Treaty with France.  
This priority, therefore, occasioned  
  
by the mifcondu&amp; of France, ought  
not to have been an obstacle to the for­  
“fnation of 4 Treaty with us,” which,  
in other reipells, should have been the  
fame as our Treaty with Great-Bri­  
tain. And doubtless it will appear  
hereafter, that our. Envoys were au­  
“thorifed Yo offér, and did offer, such  
a I&#x27;reaty. - ‘ &#x27;  
This circumstance ought the fefs to  
have been an obstacle, becatife the  
25th is one of the articles of our treaty  
with Great-Britain, which, by its own  
limitation, will expire in- twelve §edrs  
atter the making of it, that is, in &#x27; the  
“year 18c7. e :  
Aguin—As to the principle, that  
neutral bottoms should make neutral  
property, which, it is said, France was  
anxicus to eftablith—  
IT is not true, as alledged, that cur  
Treaty with Great-Britain was an  
impeditnent to our eftablithing that  
principle with France ; unless it was  
meant to do more than was done by  
the treaty of 1778,  
It is clearly ihewn by Mr. Jer-  
FERSON, in his correspondence on the  
subject, and has beén otherwile amply  
demonstrated, that this Treaty did  
nothing more than adopt the princi­  
ple as a rule to be observed, between  
the United States and Yrance, with  
‘regard to eacl! other when one was at­  
peace, the other at war—that it did  
not bind either party to enforce or in­  
fik upon therule as against other Na­  
tions. e .  
If mote¢ was desired by France at  
this timhe 3 if it was fneant that we  
were 10 agtet to infilt updbn the rule  
as againlt other nations—it is evident  
that this was nothing more nor less  
than an attempt to invélve us in war  
with Great-Britain. :  
As a violation of our Treaty wnh  
her, this would have been the natuzal  
consequences as an dttempt to change,  
by forée, the present Law of Nations  
in a point which she is deeply interest­  
ed to maintain, the fame consequence  
was to be expefted. . 7 -  
This would be another specimen of  
the old policy—Har with Great-Bri­  
toing as the price of friendflip with  
It is not unlikely that oor Envoys  
}ave been inttiudicd to decling, in a­  
ke A RS G e  
  
ny shape, the fipulation, that neutral  
bottoms thould make neatral proper­  
ty 5 and if they were, the inftiu&amp;ion  
was a perfeétly wife one. : :  
Experience has shewn, in the con­  
du&amp; of France herfelf towards the  
United States, that it isa flipulation  
not to be relied upon ; foo contrary  
to the spirit of maritime war to be  
observed—and that the most probable  
effe@ of making it, will always be to  
introduce a germ of contefition be­  
tween the parties to the contraét. It  
has been a cauie 6f extreme embar­  
rafiment to us in the present war.  
An unwillingness to repeat the ex­  
periment of this contentious innova­  
tion, ought certainly to have been no  
obltacle to a Treaty with the very  
power which has siven to us proof  
that it was aworjfe than mthing, and  
taught us the neceflity of diftrulting it.  
Hence weperccive the unreafona­  
blemefs and futillity of the oftenfiyje  
motives which, on the part of Fra  
have obftra&amp;ted a treaty with th nces  
nited States. e U-  
  
Liet us now conjeéture the true rea­  
sons of the failure of the negociation.  
They were—l. The hope that an un­  
settled ttate of things between the two  
fountries might favour in the ap­  
proaching ele¢tion of Chief Magistrate,  
the choice of a person more complai­  
sant to the views of France, namely,  
Mr. JeFFersoN.——2. Theé expefta­  
tion that with him a bargain more ad­  
vantageous to I&#x27;rance woild be made  
than with our present Executive.  
Will the people of the United States  
be thé dupes of this {cheme ? Will  
they think it their interelt to elevate  
to the head of the Government a man  
with whom France expe&amp;s to make  
such a bargain as will suit her pur­  
pose, after the repeated proofs they  
have had of the with of France to  
entangle them in her own interests,  
and embroil them with other nations ?  
Why thould they do this ?  
Things ate now upon a good foot­  
ing. A treaty, it is trize, has not been  
made ; but if we are to credit the  
French statement, the depredations on  
our commerce até to ceife, and ot  
neutral rights are in future to be re­  
fpe&amp;ed.—-—?t is, therefore, in our op­  
tion to Have peace in fa? with France,  
though not by treaty ; and if the keeps  
her word (the only security a treaty  
would give us) we shall be as well off  
gemept in the article of compensation  
or captures) as if a treaty had been  
made. , :  
In little more than fix yedrs the  
partsof out treaty with Great-Britain  
refpe@ing external commerce and na­  
vigation will expire. We can then  
stand both with France and hes upon  
new ground, and, it is matter of in­  
difference whethet we ever again have  
a commercial treaty with either of  
them, unless upon bettet terms than  
heretofore. The trade between us  
and thein may as well be left to re­  
gulate itfelf until bargains more posi­  
tively advantageous for us can be  
made.  
  
. The getting rid, on fair ground, of  
the Guarantee of the French Weft-  
Indies in our treaty of Alliance with  
France, is a point of substantial inter­  
eflt gained to the United States. :  
~ We observe that an attempt was  
made te revive this Guarantee in a  
qualified form, whether this revival  
wis urged as an a/timatum or not, does  
not appear. It is probable that it has  
been a very serious point with France.  
And the reasons which induce her to  
desfire it, ought to induce the United  
~States to avoid it. The Guarantee  
; as it formerly stood, would have en­  
~gaged this Country in every maritime  
“wat in which France was a defenfive  
party. Commuted for a pecuniary  
aid, it would cost them a large sum  
of money in every such case, and  
would be more or less hazardous to  
their peace. : |  
- President WasuingTon wifely pro­  
posed the substitute when the treaties  
.were yetin force. But Frdance would  
not listen to the moderate propositions  
of this great man. Now, that the  
Treaties are at an end, in consequence  
of ¥rench aggreflions, we ought not  
voluntarily to resume {o serious an  
‘incumbrance. It would be far better  
for the United States to compensate  
their own citizens for lofles by French  
{poliations.  
. On this head it is to be observed,  
That nothing more than a promise of 1  
compensation could at present have 1  
beent expe@ted from France, with the  
beftintentions onherpart. The ftateof 1  
her finances does not permit more.  
The enjoymeit of the boon must have  
been in future. &#x27;ln all probability, by  
patience and perfeverdnce a &#x27; rhore  
convenient oppertunity will occur for  
a favorable settlement of the matter,  
and early enough to meet the resour­  
ces of I&#x27;rance for payment.  
In the interim, let our Govern­  
ment take preparatory meaftires ; such  
as will thoroughly fift and ascertain  
the claims which ought to be com­  
pensated ; and by th%s expedient the  
affair will be refined for definitive ne~  
gotiation, and litle, if any time, will  
PRy e e  
&quot;As to the reff, a iﬂnpié and ob­  
vious cowrfe of condu&amp; presents it- !  
  
feltj. Let hostilities on the part of the”  
U. States geafe, and let the two coun­  
tries pass into a state of Peace in faét.  
on the basis of the Laws of Nations.  
In this position it will be seen whe­  
ther France is sincere, and at the {fame  
time able to execute her aflurance  
that our rights, 2s a neutral fation,  
will hereafter be refpeéted.  
But in doing this, let us take care  
that we are not- found hereafter un­  
prepared. Let effe@ual measures be  
taken to increase our means of futute  
resistance ; if again we fhiall be cém­  
pelled to prote&amp; otr rights and de­  
fend our commerce by force. The  
posture of Europe is still eventful—  
eventful beyond all human calcula­  
tiofi.— Absurd indeed must be that  
American who will rest the fafety of  
his country on any other foundation  
than her owe ability so repel vio­  
letice: ;

It thus appears that the negotiation  
turned chieflv on three points.  
  
1. The continuance in force, or the  
modified renewal of the treaty of 1778.  
France waved ibis point in confequenct  
of the affurances of the American envoys  
that they could not renew it.

ftructions given by Washington;  
  
3. The 25th article of the treaty be-
