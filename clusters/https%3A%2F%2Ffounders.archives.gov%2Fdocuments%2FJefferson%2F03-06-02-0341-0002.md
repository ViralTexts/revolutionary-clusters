r Monticello. Aug. 18. 1813.  
In compliance with the request conveyed in your letter of May 25. I have endeavored to obtain,  from the relations &amp; friends of the late Governor Lewis, information of such incidents of his life as might be not unacceptable to those who may read the Narrative of his Western discoveries. the ordinary occurrences of a private life, and those  
			 also while acting in a subordinate sphere in the army, in a time of peace, are not deemed sufficiently interesting to occupy the public attention; but a general account of his parentage, with  
			 such  
			 smaller incidents as marked early character are briefly noted; and to these are added, as being peculiarly within my own knolege, whatever related to the public mission, of which an account is  
			 now to  
			 be published. the result of my enquiries &amp; recollections, shall now be offered, to be enlarged or abridged as you may think best; or otherwise to be used with the materials you may have  
			 collected  
			 from other sources.  
Meriwether Lewis, late Governor of Louisiana, was born on the 18th of Aug. 1774. near the town of Charlottesville, in the county of Albemarle, in Virginia, of one of the distinguished families of that state. John Lewis, one of his father’s uncles, was a member of the king’s council, before the revolution. another of them, Fielding Lewis, married a sister of Genl Washington. his father William Lewis, was the youngest of five sons of Colo Robert Lewis of Albemarle, the fourth of whom, Charles, was one of the early patriots who stepped forward in the commencement of the revolution, and commanded one of the regiments first raised in Virginia, and placed on Continental establishment. happily situated at home, with a wife and young family, and a fortune placing him at ease, he left all, to aid in the liberation of his country,  
			 from foreign usurpations, then first unmasking their ultimate end &amp; aim. his good sense, integrity, bravery, enterprize and remarkable bodily powers, marked him as an officer of great promise. but he unfortunately died early in the revolution.  
			 Nicholas Lewis, the second of his father’s brothers, commanded a regiment of militia in the succesful expedition of 1776. against the Cherokee Indians; who, seduced by the agents of the British  
			 government, to take up the hatchet against us, had committed great havoc on our Southern frontier, by murdering and scalping helpless women and children, according to their cruel and cowardly principles of warfare. the chastisement they then recieved closed the history of their wars, prepared them for recieving the elements of civilisation, which, zealously inculcated by the present government of the United States, have rendered them an industrious, peaceable and happy people. this member of the family of Lewises, whose  
			 bravery was so usefully proved on this occasion, was endeared to all who knew him by his inflexible probity, courteous disposition, benevolent heart, &amp; engaging modesty &amp; manners. he was the Umpire of all the private differences of his county, selected always by both parties. he was  
			 also the guardian of Meriwether Lewis, of whom we are now to speak, and who had lost his father at an early age. he continued some years under the fostering care of a tender mother, of the respectable family of Meriwethers of  
			 the same county; and was remarkable even in infancy for enterprise, boldness &amp; discretion. when only eight years of age, he habitually went out, in the dead of night, alone with his dogs,  
			 into  
			 the forest to hunt the raccoon &amp; opossum, which, seeking their food in the night, can then only be taken. in this exercise, no season or circumstance could obstruct his purpose, plunging  
			 thro’  
			 the winter’s snows and frozen streams, in pursuit of his object. at thirteen he was put to the Latin school, and continued at that until eighteen, when he returned to his mother, and entered on  
			 the  
			 cares of his farm, having, as well as a younger brother, been left by his father with a competency for all the correct and comfortable purposes of lif temperate life. his talent for observation, which had led him to an accurate knoledge of the plants &amp; animals of his own country, would have distinguished him as a farmer; but at the age of twenty,  
			 yielding to the ardor of youth, &amp; a passion for more dazzling pursuits, he engaged as a volunteer in the body of militia which were called out by Genl Washington on occasion of the discontents produced by the Excise-taxes in the Western parts of the United States; and from that situation he was removed to the regular service as a lieutenant in the line. at twenty three he was promoted to a Captaincy; and, always attracting the first attention, where  
			 punctuality &amp; fidelity were requisite, he was appointed paymaster to his regiment.about this time a circumstance occurred which, leading to the transaction which is the subject of this book, will justify a recurrence to it’s original idea.while  
			 I resided in Paris, John Ledyard of Connecticut arrived there, well known in the United States for energy of body &amp; mind. he had accompanied Captn Cook on his voyage to the Pacific ocean, and distinguished himself on that voyage by his intrepidity. being of a roaming disposition, he was now panting for  
			 some new enterprize. his immediate object at Paris was to engage a mercantile company in the fur-trade of the Western coast of America, in which however he failed. I then proposed to him to go by land to Kamschatka, cross in some of the Russian vessels to Nootka sound, fall down into the latitude of the Missouri, and penetrate to, and thro’, that, to the United States. he eagerly siesed the idea, &amp; only asked to be assured of the permission of the Russian government. I interested, in obtaining that, M. de Simoulin M.P. of the Empress at Paris, but more especially the Baron de Grimm, M.P. of Saxe-Gotha, her more special agent, &amp; correspondent there, in matters not immediately diplomatic. her permission was obtained, &amp; an assurance of protection, while the  
			 course of the voyage should be thro’ her territories. Ledyard set out from Paris, &amp; arrived at St Petersburg after the Empress had left that place, to pass the winter, I think, at Moscow. his finances not permitting him to make unnecessary stay at St Petersburg, he left it with a passport from one of the ministers; and, at 200. miles from Kamschatka, was obliged to take up his winter quarters. he was preparing, in the spring, to resume his journey, when he was arrested by an officer of the Empress, who by this time had changed her mind,  
			 and forbidden his proceeding. he was put into a close-carriage, &amp; conveyed day &amp; night, without ever stopping, till they reached Poland, where he was set down, &amp; left to himself. the fatigue of this journey broke down his constitution, and when he returned to Paris, his bodily strength was much impaired. his mind however remained firm, &amp; he after this undertook the journey to Egypt. I recieved a letter from him, full of sanguine hopes, dated at Cairo, the 15th of Nov. 1788. the day before he was to set out for the head of the Nile, on which day however he ended his career and life. and thus failed the first attempt to explore the Western part of our Northern continent.  
In 1792. I proposed to the American Philosophical Society that we should set on foot a subscription to engage some competent person to explore that region in the opposite direction, that is, by ascending the Missouri, crossing the Stony mountains, and descending the nearest river to the Pacific. Capt Lewis being then stationed at Charlottesville, on the recruiting service, warmly sollicited me to obtain for him the execution of that object. I told him it was proposed that the person engaged should be attended by a  
			 single companion  
			 only, to avoid exciting alarm among the Indians. this did not deter him. but mr  
			 André Michaux, a professed botanist, author of the Flora Boreali-Americana, and of the Histoire des chesnes d’Amerique, offering his  
			 services, they were accepted. he recieved his instructions, and when he had reached Kentucky in the prosecution of his journey, he was overtaken by an order from the Minister of France, then at Philadelphia, to relinquish the expedition, and to pursue elsewhere the Botanical enquiries for on which he was employed by that government. and thus failed the 2d attempt for exploring that region.  
In 1803. the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes being about to expire, some modifications of it were recommended to Congress by a confidential message of Jan. 18. and an extension of it’s views to the Indians on the Missouri. in order to prepare the way, the Message proposed the sending an exploring party to trace the Missouri to it’s source, to cross the Highlands, and follow the best water-communication which offered itself from thence to the Pacific ocean. Congress approved the proposition, and voted a sum of money for carrying it into execution. Capt Lewis, who had then been near two years with me as private Secretary, immediately renewed his sollicitations to have the direction of the party. I had now had opportunities of knowing him intimately. of courage undaunted, possessing a firmness &amp; perseverance of purpose which nothing but impossibilities could divert from it’s direction, careful as a father of those committed to his charge, yet steady in the maintenance of order &amp; discipline, intimate with the Indian character, customs &amp; principles, habituated to the hunting life, guarded, by exact observation of the vegetables and animals of his own country, against losing time in the description of objects already possest possesd, honest, disinterested, liberal, of sound understanding, and a fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever he should report would be as certain as if seen by ourselves; with all these  
			 qualifications, as if selected &amp; implanted by nature in one body, for this express purpose, I could have no hesitation in confiding the enterprize to him. to fill up the measure desired, he  
			 wanted nothing but a greater familiarity with the technical language of the natural sciences, and readiness in the Astronomical observations necessary for the geography of his route. to acquire  
			 these  
			 he repaired immediately to Philadelphia, and placed himself under the tutorage of the distinguished Professors of that place, who with a zeal &amp; emulation, enkindled by an ardent devotion to science, communicated to him freely  
			 the information requisite for the purposes of the journey. while attending too, at Lancaster, the fabrication of the arms with which he chose that his men should be provided,  
			 he had the benefit of daily communication with mr Andrew Ellicot, whose experience in Astronomical observation, and practice of it in the woods, enabled him to apprise Capt Lewis of the wants &amp; difficulties he would encounter, and of the substitutes &amp; resources offered by a woodland and uninhabited country.  
It being deemed necessary also to provide an associate properly qualified to succeed to the direction of the enterprise in the event of accident to Capt Lewis, he proposed Capt William Clarke of Ohio, brother to Genl George Rogers Clarke, who was approved without hesitation Deeming it necessary he should have some person with him, of known competence to the direction of the enterprise, in the event of accident to himself, he proposed William Clarke, brother of General George Rogers Clarke, who was approved, and, with that view recieved a commission of Captain.  
In April 1803. a draught of his instructions was sent to Capt Lewis, and on the 20th of June they were signed in the following form.  
	TJ’s instructions to Meriwether Lewis, drafted in April 1803 and signed on 20 June of that year, are printed as part of a grouping of documents at 13 Apr. 1803 in PTJJulian P. Boyd, Charles T. Cullen, John Catanzariti, Barbara B. Oberg, and others, eds., The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, 1950– , 34 vols., 40:176–83. The copy that TJ incorporated into his biography of Lewis in 1813 is accordingly omitted here.  
  
While these things were going on here, the country of Louisiana, lately ceded by Spain to France, had been the subject of negociation at Paris between us and this last power; and had actually been transferred to us by treaties executed at Paris, on the 30th of April. this information, recieved about the 1st day of July, increased infinitely our the interest we felt in the expedition, &amp; lessened the apprehensions of interruption from other powers. every thing in this quarter being now prepared, Capt Lewis left Washington on the 5th of July 1803. and proceeded to Pittsburg, where other articles had been ordered to be provided for him. the men too were to be selected from the military stations on the Ohio. delays of preparation, difficulties of navigation down the Ohio, &amp; other untoward obstructions, retarded his arrival at Cahokia until the season was so far advanced as to render it prudent to suspend his entering the Missouri before the ice should break up in the succeeding spring.  
From this time his journal, now published, will give the history of his journey to and from the Pacific ocean, until his return to St Louis on the 23d of Sep. 1806. never did a similar event excite more joy thro’ the United States. the humblest of it’s citizens had taken a lively interest in the issue of this journey, &amp; looked forward with impatience for the information it would furnish—their anxieties too for the  
			 safety of the corps had been kept in a state of excitement by lugubrious rumors, circulated from time to time, on uncertain authorities, and uncontradicted by letters, or other direct information from the time they had left the Mandan towns, in on their ascent up the river, in April of the preceding year 1805. until their actual return to St Louis.  
It was the middle of Feb. 1807. before Capt Lewis, with his companion Clarke, reached the city of Washington, where Congress was then in session. that body granted to the two Chiefs and their followers the donation of lands which they had been encoraged to expect in reward of their toil &amp; dangers. Capt Lewis was soon after appointed Governor of Louisiana, and Capt Clarke a General of it’s militia, and Agent of the US. for Indian affairs in that department.  
A considerable time intervened before the Governor’s arrival at St Louis. he found the territory distracted by feuds &amp; contentions among the officers of the government, &amp; the people themselves divided by these into factions &amp; parties. he determined at  
			 once to take no side with either; but to use every endeavor to conciliate and harmonise them. the even-handed justice he administered to all soon established a respect for his person &amp;  
			 authority;  
			 and perseverance and time wore down animosities, &amp; reunited the citizens again into one family.  
Governor Lewis had, from early life, been subject to hypocondriac affections. it was a constitutional disposition in all the nearer branches of the family of his name, and was more immediately inherited  
			 by him from his father. they had not however been so strong as to give uneasiness to his family. while he lived with me in Washington, I observed at times sensible depressions of mind; but knowing their constitutional source, I estimated their  course by what I had seen in the family. during his Western expedition the constant exertion, which that required, of all the faculties of body &amp; mind, suspended these distressing affections; but  
			 after his establishment at St Louis in sedentary occupations, they returned upon him with redoubled vigor, &amp; began seriously to alarm his friends. he was in a paroxysm of one of these, when his affairs rendered it  
			 necessary for him to go to Washington. he proceeded to the Chickasaw bluffs, where he arrived on the 16th of Sep. 1809. with a view of continuing his journey thence by water. mr Neely, agent of the US. with the Chickasaw Indians, arriving there two days after, found him extremely indisposed, and betraying, at times, some symptoms of a derangement of mind. the rumors of a war with England, &amp; apprehensions that he might lose the papers he was bringing on, among which were the vouchers of his public accounts, &amp; the journals of &amp; papers of his Western expedition, induced him here to change his mind, and to take his course by land thro’ the Chickasaw country. altho’ he appeared somewhat relieved, mr Neely kindly determined to accompany &amp; watch over him. unfortunately, at their encampment, after having passed the Tennisee one day’s journey, they lost two horses; which obliging mr Neely to halt for their recovery, the Governor proceeded, under a promise to wait for him at the house of the first white inhabitant on his road. he stopped at the house of a mr Grinder, who not being at home, his wife, alarmed at the symptoms of derangement she discovered, gave him up the house, &amp; retired to rest herself in an outhouse, the Governor’s and Neely’s servants lodging in another. about three aclock in the night, he did the deed which plunged his friends into affliction, and deprived his country of one of her most valued citizens, whose  
			 valour and intelligence would have been now employed in avenging the wrongs of his country, and in emulating by land the splendid deeds which have honored her arms on the ocean. it lost too to  
			 the  
			 nation the benefit of recieving from his own hand the Narrative now offered them of his sufferings &amp; successes, in endeavoring to extend for them the boundaries of science, and to present to  
			 their knolege that vast &amp; fertile country, which their sons are destined to fill with arts, with science, with freedom &amp; happiness.  
To this melancholy close of the life of one, whom posterity will declare not to have lived in vain, I have only to add that all the facts I have stated are either known to myself, or communicated by his family or others, for whose truth I have no hesitation to make myself responsible; and I conclude with tendering you the assurances of my respect &amp; consideration.

MoNTiCiLLo, August 18, 1813.  
Sir,— »  
In compliance with the request con­  
veyed in your letter of May 25,1 have en­  
deavored to obtain, from the relations and  
friends of the late governor Lewis, informa­  
tion of such incidents of his life as might be  
not unacceptable to those who may r* ad the  
narrative of his western discoveries The or­  
dinary occurrences of privae life, and tho*e  
also while acting in a subordinate sphere in  
the army, in a time ol peace, are net deem •  
cd sufficiently interesting M»occupy the pub­  
lic attention; but a general account ol his  
parentage, with such smaller incidents as  
marked his early character, are briefly no.  
ted ; and to those are added, as being pecu­  
liarly within my own knnwli, &lt;je. whatever  
related to the public mission, of which an  
account is now published. The result of my  
enquiries and recollections ^slujll now he of­  
fered, to be enlarged or abridged as you may  
think best ; or otherwise to he used with the  
materials you may have collected from oth  
cr source?.  
Meriwether Lewi*, late governor of Lou­  
isiana, was born on the eighteenth of August,  
1774, near tin town of Chsrlo&#x27;trsville, in the  
county of Albemarle, in \ iiginia, of one of  
the distinguished families of that state.—  
John Lewis, one of his father’s uncles, was a  
member of the king’s council, before the re­  
1 volution. Another of them, Fielding Lewis,  
  
married a sister of general Washington,—  
His father, William Lewis, was the young*  
est of five sons of colonel Robert Lewis of  
A!bemar!e,the fourth uf whom, Charles, was  
one of the early patriots who stepped for­  
ward in the commencement of the revoluti­  
on, and cmmnatKft&lt;J one of the regiments  
first raised in Vjhgmia, and placed on con­  
tinental establishment. Happily situated at  
with a wife and young family, and a  
fortune placing him at ease, he left all to  
aid in the liberation of his country from to­  
reign usurpations, then first unmasking their  
ultimate end and aitu. His gMtl sense, in­  
tegrity, bravery, enterprise, anf remarkable  
bodily powers, marked him as*an officer of  
great promise j but he unfortunately died  
early in the revolution. Nicholas Lewis, the  
sec ud of his father’s brothers commanded  
a regimen of militia untie successful expe­  
dition of 1776, against the Cherokee Indi­  
ans ; who seduced by the agents of the Bri­  
tish government to take up the hatchet a  
gainst us, had committed great havoc on our  
southern fr oner, by murdering and scalp­  
ing helpless women and childreu, according  
to their cruel and cowardly principles of  
warfare. The chastisement they then receiv­  
ed closed the history of their wars, and pre­  
pared them for receiving the elements of ci­  
vilization, which, zealously inculcated l&gt;y the  
present government of the United States,  
have rendered them an industrious, peacea­  
ble, and happy people. This member of the  
family of Lewises, whose bravery was so  
usefudy proved on this occasion, was en  
deared tu all who knew him by his inflexi­  
ble probity, courteous dUmnsiiion, benevo­  
lent heart, and engaging modesty and man  
ners. He was the umpire c4 all the private  
differences of his county——selected always  
by both parties. He was also the guardian  
ot Men vetlier Lewis, of whom we are now  
to speak, and who hud lost lib father at an  
early age. He continued some years under  
the fostering care ota tender mother, of the  
respectable family of Metiwethers, of the  
same county ; and was remarkable even in  
infancy for enterprise, boldness and discre­  
tion. When only eight years of age he ha  
bitually went out, in the dead of night, a­  
1« ne with his dogs, into the forest to hunt th  
racoon and opossum, which, seeking their  
tood in the night, can then only be taken.­  
In this exercise, no season or circumstance  
could obstruct his purpose—plunging tUr..&#x27;  
the winter’s snows and frozen streams in  
pursuit of his object. At thirteen he was  
put to the latin school, and continued at that  
until ighteeu, when he returned u his mo­  
* her, and entered on the cares of his farm ;  
having, as well as a younger brother, been  
left y his iather with a competency for ali  
the correct and comfortable purposes of a  
temperate life. His talent for observation,  
I which had led him to an accurate know­  
  
icu&amp;e nt the piuiiLs aim aniuiais &lt;&gt;i Uis own  
country, wouid nave distir.guh h« J him as a  
farmer; but at the age of twenty, yielding  
u* the urtioui of youth, and a passion lor  
more dazzling pursuits, he engaged as a vo­  
lunteer in the body of militia which were  
called out by general Washington, on occa­  
sion of tlie discontents produced by the ex  
c.se tax in the western pans cf the Uni­  
ted btates ; and from that si&gt;uatioh he was  
removed to lh- regular service as a lieuten­  
ant in the title. At twenty three he was  
promoted to a captaincy ; and, always at­  
tracting the first attention where punctuali­  
ty and fidelity were requisite, he was ap­  
pointed paymaster to his regiment. About  
this time a Circumstance occurred which,  
leading to the transaction which is the sub­  
ject of this book, will justify a recurrence to  
its original idea. While 1 resided in Paris,  
John Ledyard, of Connecticut, arrived there,  
well known in the United States for energy  
of bony and mind. lie had accompanied  
captain Cook ou his \oyage to the Pacific  
ocean; and du-ti.iguished housed on that voy &#x27;  
age by his intrepidity, being of a roaming  
disposition, he was now panting for some  
new enterprise. His immediate object at  
Paris was to engage a mercantile company  
in the fur-trade of the western coast of A­  
merica* in which, hnwC\e , he failed. 1  
then proposed to him to go by land to Kani­  
schatka, cross in some of the Russian vessels  
to Nootka bound, fall down into the latitude  
of the Missouri, and penetrate to, and thro*  
that to the United States. He eagerly %eiz»  
ed tile idea, and only asktd to be assured of  
the permission of the Russ ~ I government.  
1 interested, in obtaining that, M. de Simou­  
lin, minister plenipotentiary of the empress  
at Paris, but more especially the baron de  
(iriinm, minister plenipotentiary of Saxe  
  
ixoirca, ner more special agent and corres­  
pondent there in matters not immediately  
diplomatic. Her permission was obtained,  
and an assurance of protection while the  
course of the voyage should be through her  
territories. Hedy ai d set out from Paris, and  
arrived at baiut Petersburg after the em­  
press hau left that place to pass the winter,  
i chink, at Moscow. His finances not per  
milting him to make unnecessary stay at St.  
Pe&gt;ersburg, he left it with h passport from  
one af the minister* ; and at two hundred  
miles from Ivair.sc&#x27;natka, was obliged io take  
up his winter quarters. He was preparing,  
in the spring, to resume his journey, when  
he whs arrested by an ofTicwr of.the empress,  
who by this time had changed her mind, Ct  
forbidden his proceeding. He was put into  
a close carnage, and conveyed day ffc night,  
without ever stopping, till they reached Po­  
land ; where he was set down and left to  
lumsctr. 1 he fatigue ol t|u* journey broke  
down his constitution ; and when lie return­  
ed to Paris his bodily health was much im­  
paired. His mind, however, remained firm,  
and he after tins flnclertook the journey to  
Kgypt. I received a letter from him, full  
•»f sanguine hopes, dated at Cairo, the 15th  
of November, 1788, tho dny before he whs  
to set not for the head of the Nile ; on which  
day, iover, ended hi career anil life  
and thus failed the first attempt to explore  
the western part of our northern continent  
In 179‘i, I proposed to the American Phi  
losophical Society that we should set on foot  
a subscription to engage some competent  
person to explore that region in the opposite  
direction ; that is by ascending the Missouri,  
  
crossing the Stony mountains, and deciding  
the nearest river to the Pacdic. Captain  
Lewis being then stationed at Charlottesville,  
on the recruiting service, warmly solicited  
me to obtain for him the execution of that  
object. I told him it was proposed that the  
person engaged should be attended by a sin­  
gle companion only, to avoid exciting alarm  
I among the Indians. This did not deter him ;  
but Mr. Andrew Michaux.a prof, ssed bota­  
nist, author of the Flora Boreali-Amei icaua,  
and ol the Histoire des Chesues d’Ameri  
que, offering ni» services, they were accep­  
ted. He received his instructions, and when  
he had reached Kentucky in the prosecution  
of his journey, he was overtaken by an or­  
der the minister of France, then at  
Philadelphia, to relinguish the expedition,  
and to pursue elsewhere the botanical inqui­  
ries uu which he was employed by that go­  
vernment.&#x27; and thus failed the second at­  
tempt for exploring that region.  
In 1803, the act for establishing trading  
houses with the Indian tribes being about to  
expire, some modifications of it were recom­  
mended to congress by a confidential mes­  
sage of January 18th, and an e* tension of its  
view* to the Indians on the Missouri. In or­  
der toprepare the way, the message proposed  
the sending an exploring party to trace the  
Missouri to its source, to cross the Highland*,  
j and follow the best water communication  
which offered itself from thence to the Pa­  
cific ocean. Congress approved the propo­  
sition, and voted a sum of njoney for carry­  
ing it Into execution Captain Lewis, who  
bad then been near two years with me as  
private secretary, immediately renewed hi.  
solicitations to have the direction of the par -  
ty; I had now had opportunities of know­  
ing him intimately. Of courage undaun­  
ted ; possessing firmness and perseverance  
of purpose which nothing but impossibilities  
could divert from its direction ; careful as a  
father of those committed to his charge, yet  
steady in the maintenance of order and dis  
cjpline ; intimate with the Indian character,  
customs, and pi inciples ; habituated to the  
hunting life; guarded, by exact observation  
of the vegetables and animals of his own  
country, against losing time in the descrip  
tion of objects already possessed ; honest, dis­  
inter sted, liberal, of sound understanding,  
and fidelity to truth so scrupulous, that  
whatever he should report would be as cer  
tain as if seen by ourselves ; with all these  
qualifications as if selected and implanted  
by nature in one body for this express pur­  
pose, 1 could have no hesitation in confiding  
the enterpise io hi n. To fill up the mea­  
sure desired, he wanted nothing but a grea­  
ter familarity with the technical language  
of the natural sciences, and readiness in the  
astronomical (•bservations necessary lor the  
  
1 .i^ny is route. 10 acquire tnese  
tie repaired immediately to Philadelphia,  
ml placed himself under the tutorage of  
the distinguished professors of that place,  
who with a zeal and emulation, enkindled  
by an ardent devotion to science, com muni  
cated to him freely tne information requisite  
for the purpose of the journey. Whilt at­  
tending too, at Lancsster, the fabrication of  
the arms with which he chose that his men  
should be provided, he had the benefit, of  
daily communication with vfr. Andrew El­  
licot, whose experience in astrominical ob­  
servation, and patience of it in the woods,  
enabled him to apprze captain Lewis of the  
wants and difficulties he would encounter,  
and of the substitutes ar.d resources offered  
by a woodland and uninhabited country:

While three things were going on here, the  
country of Lnuisana, lately ceded Ijy. Spam  
to France, had been the subject of ncgocia«  
tion at Paris between us and this last power ;  
and had actually been transferred to us by  
treaties executed at Paris on the thirtieth o!  
April. This information, received about  
the first day of July, increact d infinitely thr

from other pokers. Every thing in this

from the Pacific reran, until his return u&gt;  
S’ . Louis on the 23d of September. 180&lt;&gt;.—  
Never did a similar event excite more joy  
through the United Stales. Thr humblest  
of their citizrns had taken u lively interest  
in the issue of this journey, and looked for*  
  
ward with impatience for the information it 1  
would furnish. Their anxieties too for the  
safety ot the corps had beeu kept in a state  
u! excitement by lugubrious rumors. Circu­  
lated from time to time on certain authori­  
ties, and uTiComradicted by letter*, «*r other  
direct itifei am tiro, from the time they had  
left the Mund-ui towns, on their ascent up  
the river in April of the preceding year, \
1805, until their actual return to bt. Louis.  
It was the middle of February, 1807, be­  
fore captain Lewi.-, with his companion cap­  
tain Clark, reached the city of Washing*  
ion, where congress was then in session.—  
1 hut body grantee* to the two chiefs nnd their  
followers the donation of lamU which they  
ha l bcvii encouraged to expect in reward of  
li.tir toil and dangers. Captain Lewis was  
soon alter appointed governor of Louisiauna,  
and captain Clark a general of its militia,  
and agent of the United b’.ates for Indian nf  
fairs in that department.  
A considerable time intervened liefore&#x27;the  
governor’s arrival at St. Louis, lie found  
■ he territory distracted by feuds and conlcit  
tio. s among the officers of the government,  
and the people themselves divided by these  
into factions and parties. He determined at  
once to take no side with either; but to .use  
every endeavor to conciliate and harmonize  
them. The even handed justice he admini  
tered to all soon established a respect for his  
person and Authority ; and perseverance fit  
lime wore down animosities, and re united  
the citizens again into one familv  
Governor Lewis had, from early life, been  
subject to hypochondriac affections. It was  
a constitutional disposition in all the nearer  
branches of the family of his name, and was  
more immediately innciited by him from his  
father. &#x27;I hey had not, however, been so  
strong as to give uneasiness to his family.—  
While he lived with me in Washington, I ob  
served at times sensible depressions of mind:  
but knowing their constitutional source, I es­  
timated theii course by what I had seen in  
ihe family. During his western expedition,  
the constant exertion which that required of  
all the faculties of body and mind sus­  
pended these di*trtssing affections; but after  
his establishment at bt. Louis in sedentary  
occupations, they returned upon him with  
redoubled vigour, and began seriously to a­  
larm his frieuds. He was in a paroxysm of  
one of these, when his affairs rendered it ne­  
cessary lor him to goto Wav-met on. He  
  
proceeded to the Tluckasaw Bluffs, where he  
arrived on the sixteenth of September, 1809,  
with a view of continuing his journey  
thence by water. Mr, Neely, agent of the  
United States with the Chickasaw Indians,  
arriving there two days after, found him  
extremely indisposed, ami betraying at times,  
some symptoms of a derangement of mind.  
The rumors of a war with England, and ap  
prehensions that he might lose the papers  
he was bringing on, among; which were the  
vouchtr. of lib public recounts, &amp;thejour­  
nals ami papers of his western expedition,  
induced him here to change his mind, and to  
take his course bv land through the Chicka  
saw count:y. Although iie appeared some  
what relieved, Mr. Neely kindly determin­  
ed to accnmpauy and watch over him. Un­  
ion urately, at their encampment, after ha­  
ving passed the Tennessee one day’s jour  
ney, they lost two horses, which obliging  
Mr. Neely to halt for their recovery, the go  
••ernor piocecdcd, under a promise to wait  
for him at the house of the first white inha­  
bitant on the road. He stopped at the bouse  
of a Mr Grinder, who not being at home,  
his wife, alarmed at the symptoms of de­  
rangement she discovered, gave up the house  
and retired to rest herself in an out house,  
the governor’-.&#x27;, and Ncdly’s servants lodging  
ia another. About three o’clock in the night  
he did the deed which plunged his friends  
into affliction, and deprived his country’ of  
one of her most valued citizens, whose va­  
lour and intelligence would have been now  
employed in avenging the * wrongs of his  
country, and in emulating by land the splea  
did deeds which have honored her arms on  
the ocean. It lost too to the nation the bene  
fit of receiving from his own hand the nar­  
rative now offered them of his sufferings and  
successes, in endeavoring toextendfor them  
boundaries of science, and to present to their  
knowledge that vast and fertile country,  
which their sons are destined to fill with  
art9, with science, with freedom and happi­  
ness.  
To this melancholy close of the life of one,  
whom posterity will declare not to have liv­  
ed in vain, 1 have only to add, that all the  
facts I have stated are either known to my­  
self, or communicated by bis family or others,  
lor whose truth I have no hesitation to make  
myself rcsponstblr; and I conclude with ten­  
dering you the assurances of my respect and  
consideration.

“ Monticello, August 18, 1813.  
&amp; Sir,  
  
“IN compliance with the request conveyed in your letter of  
May 25, I have endeavored to obtain, from the relations and  
friends of the late governor Lewis, information of such inci-  
dents of his life, as might be not unacceptable to those who  
may read the narrative of his western discoveries. The ordie  
nary occurrences of private life, and those also while acting in  
a subordinate sphere in the army; in a time of peace, are not  
deemed sufficiently interesting to occupy the public attention;  
but a general account of his parentage, with such smaller inci-  
dents as marked his early character are briefly noted; and to  
these are added, as being peculiarly within my own knowledge,  
whatever related to the public mission, of which an account is  
now to be published. The result of my inquiries and recollec-  
tions shall now be offered, to be enlarged or abridged as you  
may think best; or otherwise to be used with the materials you  
may have collected from other sources.  
  
“ Meriwether Lewis, late governor of Louisiana, was born  
on the eighteenth of August, 1774, near the town of Char  
lottesville, in the county of Albemarle, in Virginia, of one of the  
distinguished families of that state. John Lewis, one of his fa-  
ther’s uncles, was a member of the king’s council, before the  
_Tevolution. Another of them, Fielding Lewis, married a sister

of general Washington. His father, William Lewis, was the  
youngest of five sons of colone) Robert Lewis, of Albemarle,  
the fourth of whom, Charles, was one of the early patriots who  
stepped forward in the commencement of the revolution, and  
commanded one of the regiments first raised in Virginia, and  
placed on continental establishment. Huppily situated at home;  
with a wife and young family, and a fortune placing him at mi  
he icft all to aid in the liberation of his country from foreign:  
usurpations, then first unmasking their ultimate end and aim.  
  
His good sense, integrity, bravery, enterprisc, and- remarkable’  
bodily powers, marked him as an officer of great promise; but:  
he unforciunately died early in the revolution. Nicholas Lewis,  
  
the second of his father’s brothers, commanded a regiment of  
miiitia in the successful expedition of 1776, against the Cheroe  
  
kee Indians; who, seduced by the agents of the British governe  
  
ment to take up the hatchet against us, had committed great  
Ravoc on our southern frontier, by murdering and: scalping  
  
helpless women and children, aecerding to their cruel and  
cowardiy principles of warfare. The chastisement they then  
yeceived closed the history of their wars, and prepared them  
fer receiving the elements ef civilization, which, zealously in-  
culcated by the present government of the United States, have’  
rendered them an industrious, peaceable, and happy people.  
  
This member of the family of Lewises, whose bravery was’  
so uscfully proved on this occasion, was endeared to all who  
knew him by his inflexible probity, courteous disposition, bene-  
volent heart, and engaging modesty and manners. He was the’  
umpire of all the private differences of his county—selected al-’  
ways by both parties. He was also the guardian of Mcriwether  
Lewis, of whom we are new to speak, and who had lost his fa-  
ther at ao early age. He continued some years under the foster-’  
ing cure of a tender mother, of the respectable family of  
Meriwethers, of the same county: and was remarkable even in  
  
infancy for enterprise, boldness, and discretion. When only’  
eight years of age he habitually went out’ in the dead of the  
night, alone with his dogs. into the forest to hunt the raccoon’  
and opossum, which, seeking their food in the night, can then’  
only be taken. In this: exercise, no&#x27;season- of circumstance’

gould obstruct his purpose—plunging threugh the winter’s  
snows and frozen streams in pursuit of his object. At thir-  
teen he was put to the Latin school, and continued at that une  
til eighteen, when he returned to his mother, and entered on  
the cares of his farm; having, as well as a younger brother,  
been left by his father with a competency for ali the correct and  
comfortable purposes of temperate life. His talent for obser-  
vation, which had led him to an accurate knowledge of the  
plants and animals of his own country, would have distinguish-  
ed him as a farmer; but at the aye of twenty, yielding to the  
ardor of youth, and a passion for more dazzling pursuits, he  
engaged as a volunteer in the body of militia which were call-  
ed out by general Washington, on occasion of the discontents  
produced by the excise taxes in the western parts of the United  
States; and from that situation he was removed to the regular  
service as a lieutenant in the line. At twenty-three he was pros  
moted to a captaincy; and, always attracting the first attention  
where punctuality and fidelity were requisite, he was appoint-  
ed paymaster to his regiment. About this time a circumstance  
eccurred, which, leading to the transaction which is the subject  
of this book, will justify a recurrence to its original idea. While  
I resided in Paris, John Ledyard, of Connecticut, arrived there,  
well known in the United States for energy of body and mind.  
He had accompanied captain Cook on his voyage to the Pacific  
ocean; and distinguished himself on that voyage by his intrepid-  
ity. Being ef a roaming disposition, he was new panting for  
some new enterprise. His immediate object at Paris was to  
engage a mercantile company in the fur-trade of the western  
coast of America, in which, however, he failed. I then propo-  
sed to him to go by land to Kamtschatka, cross in some of the  
Russian vessels to Nootka Sound, fall down into the latitude of  
the Missouri, and penetrate to, and through that, to the United  
States. He eagerly seized the idea, and only asked to be assu-  
red of the permission of the Russian government. I interested,  
in obtaining that, M. de Simoulin, Minister plenipotentiary of  
the empress at Paris, but more especially the baron de Griinm,  
minister plenipotentiary of Saxe-Gotha, her more special agent  
and carrespondent there in matters not immediately diplomatic.

Her permission was obtained, and an assurance of protectioa  
while the course of the voyage should be through her territo.  
ries. Ledyard set out from Paris and arrived at St. Petersburgh  
after the empress had left that place to pass the winter, I think,  
at Moscow. His finances not permitting him to make unneces-  
sary stay at St. Petersburgh, he left it with a passport from one  
of the ministers; and at two hundred miles from Kamtschatka,  
was obliged to take up his winter quarters. He was preparing  
in the spring to resume his journey, when he was arrested by  
an officer of the empress, who by this time had changed her  
mind, and forbidden his proceeding. He was put_into a close  
carriage, and conveyed day and night, without ever stopping,  
till they reached Poland; where he was set down afd left to  
himself. The fatigue of this journey broke down his constitue  
tion; and when he returned to Paris his bodily strength was  
Much ‘impaired. His mind, however, remained firm, and he af-  
ter this undertook the journey to Egypt. I received a letter  
from him fuil of sanguine hopes, dated at Cairo, the fifteenth  
of November, 1788, the day before he was to set out for the  
head of the Nile; on which day, however, he ended his career  
and life: and thus failed the first attempt to explote the western  
part of our northern continent.  
“In 1792, I proposed to the American Philosophical Socie  
pety that we should set on foot a subscription to engage some  
competent person to explore that region in the opposite direc-  
tion; that is, by ascending the Missouri, crossing the Stony  
mountains, and descending the nearest river to the Pacific.  
Captain Lewis being then stationed at Charlottesville, on the re-  
6ruiting service, warmly solicited me to obtain for him the ex-  
ecution of that object. I told him it was proposed that the per-  
son engaged should be attended by a single companion only, to  
avoid exciting alarm among the Iudians. This did not deter  
him; but Mr. Andrew Michaux, a professed botanist, author of  
the Fiora Borealis Americana, and of the Histoire des Chesnes  
d’Amerique, offering his services, they were accepted* He

received his instructions, and when he had reached Kentucky  
in the prosecution of his journey, he was overtaken by an order  
from the minister of France, then at Philadelphia, to relinquish  
the expedition, and to pursue elsewhere the botanical inquiries  
on which he was employed by that government: and thus failed  
the second attempt for exploring that region.  
  
“ In 1803, the act for establishing trading houses with the  
Indian tribes being about to expire, some modifications of it  
were recommended to congress by a confidential message of  
January 18th, and an extension of its views to the Indians on  
the Missouri. In order to prepare the way, the message pro-  
posed the sending an exploring party to trace the Missouri to  
its source, to cross the Highlands, and follow the best water  
eommunication which offered itself from thence to the Pacific  
ocean. Congress approved the proposition, and voted a sum of  
money for carrying it into execution. Captain Lewis, who had

ately renewed his solicitations to have the direction of the par-  
ty. I had now nad opportunities of knowing him intimately. Of  
courage undaunted, possessing a firmness and perseverance of  
purpose which nothing but impossibilities could divert from its  
direction; careful as a father of those committed to his Charge,  
yet steady in the maintenance of order and discipline; intimate  
with the Indian character, customs, and principles; habituated  
to the hunting life ; guarded, by exact observation of the vege.  
tables and animals of his own country, against Icsing time in the  
description of objects already possessed , honest, disinterested,  
liberal, of sound understanding, and a fidelity to truth so scru-  
pulous, that whatever he shouid report would be as certain as if  
seen by ourselves; with all these qualifications, as if selected  
and implanted by nature in one body for this express purpose,  
I could have no hesitation in confiding the enterprise to him.  
To fill up the measure desired, he wanted nothing but a great-  
er familisrity with the technical language of the natural scien-  
ces, aud readiuess in the astronomical ovservations necessary for  
the geography of his route. To acquire these he repaired im-  
mediately to Philadelphia, and placed himself under the tutorage  
of the distinguished professors of that place, who, with a zeal and  
an emulation, enkindled by an ardent devotion to science, com-  
municated to him freely, the information requisite for the pur-  
poses ofthe journey. While attending too, at Lancaster, the fa-  
brication of the arms with which he chose that his men should  
be provided, he had the benefit of daily communication with  
Mr. Andrew Ejlicot, whose experience in astronomical obser-  
vation, and practice of it in the woods, enabled him to apprise  
captain Lewis of the wants and difficultics he would encoun-  
ter, and of the substitutes and resources offered by a woodland  
anc uvinhabited country.  
  
“ Deeming it necessary he should have some person with  
him of known competence to the direction of the enterpris:, in  
the event of accident to himself, he proposed William Ciarke,  
brother of general George Rogers Clarke, who was approved;  
and, with that view, received a commission of captain.  
  
  
  
CAPTAIN LEWIS. 299  
  
«In April, 1803,a draught of his instructions was sent to  
captain Lewis, and on the twentieth of June they were defim»  
tively signed.*  
  
“ While these things were going on here, the country of  
Louisiana, lately ceded by Spain to France, had been the sub-  
ject of negociation at Paris between us and this last power ; and  
had actually been transferred to us by treaties executed at Paris  
on the thirtieth of April. This information, received about  
the first day of July, increased infinitely the interest we felt in  
the expedition, and lessened the apprehensions of interruption  
from other powers. Every thing in this quarter being now pre-  
pared, captain Lewis left Washington on the fiith of July, 1803,  
and proceeded to Pittsburgh, where other articles had been  
ordered to be provided for him. The men too were to be se-  
lected from the military stations on the Ouio. Delays of pre-  
paration, difficulties of navigation down the Ohio, and other un-  
toward obstructions, retarded his arrival at Cahokia until the  
season was so far advanced as to render it prudent/to suspend  
his entering. the Missouri before the ice should break up in the  
succeeding spring.  
  
“ From this time his journal, now published, will give the  
history of his journey to and from the Pacific ocean, until his  
return to St. Louis on the twenty-third of September, 1806.  
Never did a similar event excite more joy through the United  
States. The humblest of its citizens had taken a lively interest  
in the issue of this journey, and looked forward with impa-  
tience for the information. it would furnish. ‘Their anxieties  
too for the safety of the corps had been kept in a state of ex-  
citement by lugubrious rumors, circulated from time to time  
on uncertain authorities, and uncontradicted by letters, or other  
direct information, from the timg they had left the Mandan  
towns, on their ascent up the river in April of the preceding  
year, 1805, until their actual return to St. Louis.

300 CAPTAIN LEWIS.  
  
« It was the middle of February, 1807, before captain Lew.  
fs, with his companion captain Clarke, reached the city of  
Washington, where congress was then in session. That body  
granted to the two chiefs and their followers the donation of  
lands which they had been encouraged to expect in reward of  
their toil and dangers. Captain Lewis was spon after appoint-  
ed governor of Louisiana, and captain Clarke a general of its  
militia, and agent of the United States for Indian affairs in that  
department.  
  
«© A considerable time intervened before the governor’s ar-  
rival at St. Louis. He found the territory distracted by feuds and  
contentions among the officers of the government, and the peo-  
ple themselves divided by these into factions and parties. He  
determined at once to take no side with either; but to use eve-  
ry endeavor to conciliate and harmonize them. The even-handed  
justice he administered to all soon established a respect for his  
person and authority; and perseverance and time wore down  
animosities, and re-united the citizens again into one family.  
  
“ Governor Lewis had, from early life, been subject to hypo-  
chondriac affections. It was a constitutional disposition in all  
the nearer branches of the family of his name, and was more  
immediately inherited by him from his father. They had not,  
however, been so strong as to give uneasiness to his family.  
While he lived with me in Washington I observed at times  
sensible depressions of mind: but knowing their constitutional  
source, | estimated their course by what I had seen in the fami-  
ly. During his western expedition, the constant exertion which  
that required of all the faculties of body and mind, suspended  
these distressing affections; but after his establishment at St.  
Louis in sedentary occupations, they returned upon him with  
redoubled vigor, and began seriously to alarm his friends. He  
was in a paroxysm of these, when his affairs rendered it neces  
sary for him to goto Washington. He proceeded to the Chic-  
kasaw Bluffs, where he arrived.on the sixteenth of September,  
1809, with a view of continuing his journey thence by water.  
Mr. Neely, agent of the United S.ates with the Chickasaw In-  
dians, arriving there twe days after, found him extremely indis-  
posed, and betraying at times some symptoms of a derangement

of mind. The rumors of a war with England, and apprehen-  
sions that he might lose the papers he was bringing on, among  
which were the vouchers, of his public accounts, and the jour-  
nals and papers of his western expedition, induced him here to  
change his mind, and to take his course by land through the  
Chickasaw country. Although he appeared somewhat relieved,  
Mr. Neely kindly determined to accompany and watch over  
him. Unfortunately, at their encampment, after having passed  
the Tennessee one day’s journey, they lost two horses, which  
obliged Mr. Neely to halt for their recovery, the governor pro-  
ceeded, under a promise to wait for him at the house of the first  
white inhabitant on his road. He stopped at the house of a Mr.  
Grinder, who not being at home, his wife, alarmed at the symp-  
toms of derangement she discovered, gave him up the house  
and retired to rest herself in an out-house, the governor’s and  
Necly’s servants lodging in another. About three o’clock in  
the night he did the deed which plunged his friends into afflic-  
tion, and deprived his country of one of her most valued citi-  
zens, whose valor and intelligence would have been now em-  
ployed in avenging the wrongs of his country, and in emulat-  
ing by land the splendid deeds which have honored her arms on  
the ocean. It lost too to the nation the benefit of receiving  
from his own hand the narrative now offered them of his suffer-  
ings and successes, in endeavoring to extend for them the  
boundaries of science, and to present to their knowledge that  
vast and fertile country, which their sons are destined to fill  
with arts, with science, with freedom and happiness.  
  
“ To this melancholy close of the life of one, whom posteri-  
ty will declare not to have lived in vain, I have only to add, that  
all the facts I have stated are either known to myself, or com-  
municated by his family or others, for whose truth I have no  
hesitation to make myself responsible; and I conclude with  
tendering you the assurances of my respect and consideration.”  
  
TH. JEFFERSON.

In compliance with the request con-

age, with such smaller incidents as one  
ed his early character, are briefly noted ;  
and to these are added, as being peculiar-  
ly within my own knowledge, whatever  
related to the public mission, of which sm  
account is now to be published. ‘The re-  
sult of my inquiries and recollections shall  
now be offered, to be enlarged or abridg-  
ed as you may think best; or otherwis€ io  
be used with the materials you may jhave  
coliccted frony other sources.  
  
Meriwether Lewis, late governor. of  
Louisiana, was born on the eighteenth of  
August, 1774, near the town of Charlottes-  
ville, in the county of Albermarle, in. Vir-  
ginia, of one of the distinguished families |  
of that state. John Lewis, one of his fa-|  
ther’s uncles, was a member of the king’s |  
council. before the revolution. Another  
of them, Fielding Lewis, marriéd a sis-|  
ter of general Washington. His father,  
William Lewis, was the youngest of five |  
sons of colonel Robert Lewis of Alber-|  
marie, the fourth of whom, Charles, was  
  
one of the carly patriots who stepped for-}  
  
ward in the commencement of tlre revolu-  
iton, and com;manded one of the regiments  
first raised in Virginia, and placed on con-  
menial establishment, Happily situated  
at home, with a wife and young family,  
and a fortune placing him at ease, he left  
ail t6 aic in the liberation of his country  
from foreign usurpations, then fivst un-  
masking their ultimate endand aim. His  
good seuse, integrity, bravery, enterprise,  
and= remarkable bodily powersy»marked  
him as an officer of great promise ; but  
he unfortunately died early in the revolu-  
tion. Nicholas Lewis, the second of bis  
father’s brothers, commanded a regi-|  
ment of militia in the successful expe-  
dition of 1776, against the Cherokee In-  
dians ; who, seduced by the agents, of the  
British government to \ake up the haichet  
against us, had committed great havoc on  
our southern frontier, by murdering and  
scalping helpless women and children.  
according to their cruel and cowardiy  
principles of warfare. The chastisement  
they then received closed the history of  
t.eir wars, and prepstcd them for receiy-  
ing the clements of civilization, which,  
zealously inculcated by the present gov-  
ernment of the United States, have render-  
ed them an industrious, peaceable, and  
happy people. This ember of the fan

weare now to speak, and who had lost  
hig father ai an early age. He continued  
ake years under the tostering care of a  
tender mother of the resp@ctable family of  
Meriwethers, of the same county ; and  
  
remarkable even in infancy, for en-  
t se, boldness and discretion. When

dogs, into the forest, to hunt the raccoon

and opossum, which, seeking their food  
  
in the night, can then only be taken. In  
this exercise, no season or circumstance  
éould obstruct his purpose-—plunging  
through the winter’s snows and frozcn  
streams in pursuitof his object. At thir-  
teen he was put to the latin school, and  
continued at that until eighteen, when he  
returned to bis mother, and entered on  
the cares of his farm; having, as wellas  
a younger brother, been {eft by his father  
With a competency for all the correct and  
gemfortabie purposes of a tc mperate life.  
His talent for observation, which had led  
him to an accurate knowledge of the plants  
and animals of his own country, would  
have distinguished him a8 a farmer; but  
at the age -of twenty, yielding to the ar-  
dour of youth, and a passion for more daz-  
zling pursuits, he enguged as a volunteer  
in the body of militia which were called  
out by general Washington, on occasion  
of the discontents produced by the excise  
taxes in the wesicern parts of the United  
tates ; and from that situation he was r¢-  
moved to the regular service as a lieuten-  
ant of the line. At twenty-three he was  
promoted to a captaincy ; and, always at-  
ivracting the first aitention where punctu-  
ality and fidelity were requisite, he was  
appointed paymasicr to his regiment.  
About this time a cireumstance occured  
which, leading to the transaction which is  
the subject of this book, will justily a re-  
curtence to its original idea. While I  
resided in Paris. John Ledyard, of Con-  
ueecticut, arrived there, well known in the  
  
United States for energy of body and mind. ,  
  
He had accompanied captain Cook on his  
voyage to the Pacific ocean; and distin-  
cuished himself on that voyage by his in-  
ivepidity. Being of a roaming disposi-  
ion, he was now panting for some new  
enterprise. His immediate object at Pa-

I then proposed to him to go by land to &#x27;  
  
Kamschatka, cross in some of the Russian  
- vessels to Noota Sound, full down anto  
the latitude of the Missouri, and pene-  
  
trate to, and through, that to the United |  
  
t States. He eagerly scized the idea,  
only asked to be assured of the permis-  
ston of the Russian government, | inter  
PY ested, in obk ing thaty M. de =.  
7 minister pletpetentiary.of the ress

Cirimm, minister plenipotentiary of Saxes  
Gotha, her more special agent and cor-  
respondent there in matters not immedi-  
ately diplomatiegs Her permission was ob-  
and an™assurance of protection  
While the course of the voyage should be  
through her territories. Ledyard set out  
from Paris, and arrived at St. Petersburg  
after the empress had left that place to  
pass the winter, I think,at Moscow. His  
finances not permitting him to make une  
wecessary stay at St. Petersburgh, he left  
it with a passport from one of the minis-  
ters; and at two hundred miles from  
Kumse berks 1, was obliged to take u &#x27;P his  
winter quarters. Ile was preparing. in  
the spring, to resume his jou: ney, w » Ase  
he was arrested by an officer of the em-  
press, wh a) oF this time had changed  
her mind, and forbidden his proceeding.  
He was into a close Curriage, and  
and night, without ever  
  
tained,  
  
rut  
&#x27;  
  
conveyed day  
  
stupping, tll they reached Poland; where  
he was set down and left to himseif. The  
fatigue this-journey broke down bis  
  
ecnstitution; and when be rcturned to  
Paris his bedily bealth wes much tmpair-  
ed. His mind, however, remained firm,  
and he after this undertook the journey to  
Exvpt. I received aletter from him, full  
of sanguine hopes, dated at Cairo, the  
Isth of November 1788, the day before  
he was to set out forthe head ef the Nile  
on which day, however, he ended his ca-  
reer and jife: and ihus failed the first at-  
tewipt to explore the western part of our  
northern continent.  
  
In 1792, I proposed to the American  
Philosophical Society that we should set  
on foot a Subscription to engage some  
competent person to explore that region  
in the opposite direction; that is by as-  
cending the Missouri, crossing the Steny  
mountains, and descending the nearest  
river to the Pacific. Capiain Lewis being  
then stationed at Chariottesville, on the  
recruiting service, warmiy solicited me  
to obtain for him the exceution of that ob-  
ject. [told him it was propose«l that the  
person engaged should be attended bya  
sitile companion only, to avoid exciting  
alarm emong the Indians. This did got  
detcr him; but Mr. Andre Michaux, a  
professed botanist, author of the Fiora  
Soreali-Americana. and of the Histoire  
des Chesnes d’Amerique, offering his ser-  
vices, they Were .ceepted. He received

racommended to congress by a confiden-  
tial messuge of January 18th, and an ex-  
tension of its views-to the Indians on the  
Missouri. In order to prepare the way,  
the message proposed the sending an ex-  
ploring party to trace the Missouri to its  
source, to cross the Highlands, and fol-  
low the best water communication which  
offered itself from thence to the Pacific  
Ocean. Congress approved the proposi-  
tion, and voted a sum of money for carry-  
ing tt into execution. Captain Lewis, who  
had then been near two years with me as  
private secretary, immediately renewed  
his solicitations to have the direction of  
the parity. Lhad now had opportunities  
of knowing him intimately. Of courage  
undauated; possessing a firmness and  
perseverance of purpose which nothing  
but impossibilities could divert from its  
direction ; careful as a father of those  
committed to his charge, yet steady in  
the maintenance of @rder and discipline ;  
intimate with the Ifdian character, cus-  
toms, and principies; habituated to the  
hunting life; guarded, by exact observa,  
tion of the vegetables and animals of his  
own country, against losing time in the  
description of objects already possessed ;  
honest, disinterested, liberal, of sound un-  
derstanding, and a fidelity to truth so  
scrupuious, that whatever he should re-  
port would be as certain as if seen by our-  
selves; with all these qualifications, as if  
selected and implanted by nature in one  
  
body for this express purpose, I could |  
  
have no hesitation in confiding the enter-  
prise to him. ‘To fil up the measure  
desired, he wanted nothing but a great-  
er familiarity with the technical lan-  
guage of the natural sciences, and readi-  
ness in the astronomical observations ne-  
cessary tor the geography of bis route.  
To acquire these he repaired immedi..tely  
to Philadeiphia, and placed himself under  
the tutorage of the distinguished profes-  
sors of that place, who with a zeal and  
emulation, enkindied by an ardent devo-  
tion to science, communicated to bim  
freeiy the information requisite for the  
purposes of the journey. While actend.  
ing tow, at Lancaster, the fabrication of  
the arms with which-he chose that his  
men shouid be provided, he had the ben-  
efit of daily communication with Mr. An-  
drew Eilicot, whose experience in asiro-

the woods, enabled him to epprise captain |  
Lewis of the wants and difficulties he *  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
country.  
  
t necessary he should have  
some person with him of known compe-

in the event of accident to himself, he  
proposed William Clarke, brother of gen-  
eral George Rogers Clarke, who was ap-

last power; and had actually Leen trans-  
  
“  
  
ferred to us by treaties exccuted at Paris |  
  
on ine thirticth of April.

tion, ‘received about the first day of July, |

how prepared, captain Lewis lett Wash-  
ingion on the fifth of July, 1805, afid pro-  
ceeded to Putsburg, where other articies  
had been ordered to be provided for him.  
  
The men too were to be selected from the |  
  
miliary stations on the Ohio. Delays of  
preparation, difficulties of navigation down  
the Ohio, and other untoward obstruc-  
tions, retarded his arrival at Cahokia until  
the season wus so far advanced as Ww ren-  
der it prudent to suspend his entering the  
Missouri before the ice should break up  
in the succeeding spring. .  
  
From this time his journal, now pub-  
lished, witl give the history of his jour-  
ney to and from the Pacific ocean, util  
Lis rewrn to St. Lowis on the 23d of Sep-  
tember, 1806. Never dida sinular event  
excite more joy through the U. States.  
The bumblest of their citizens had wken  
  
  
  
a lively interest inthe issue of this jour-  
  
— ee ee a whe oe eee  
  
ney, and looked forward with impatience  
for the information it would furnish. Their  
anxieties too for the safety of the corps  
had been kept in a state of excitement by  
lugubrious rumors, circulated from time  
to Ume on uncertain authorities, and un-  
contradicted by letters, or other direct in-  
  
formation, from the time they had left the _  
- Mandap towns, on their ascent up the riv-  
  
er in April of the preceding year, 1805,  
until their actual return to St. Louis.  
  
It was the middle of February, 1807,  
befure capt. Lewis, with his companion  
capt. Clarke, reached the city of Wash-  
ington, where congress was then in ses-  
sion. That body granted to the two chiefs  
and their followers the donation of lands  
which they had been encouraged to expect  
in reward of their toil and dangers. Cap-  
tain Lewis was soon after sppoimed gov-  
ernor of Louisiana, and captain Clarkea  
gencral of its militia, and agent of the  
United States for Indian affairs in that de-  
pariment.  
  
A considerable time intervened before  
the governor’s arrival at St. Louis. He  
found the territory distracted by feuds and  
contentions among the officers of the gov-  
ernment, and the people themselves di-  
vided by these into factions and parties.  
He dletermined at once to take no side  
with either ; but to use every endeavor to  
conciliate and harmonize them. ‘The  
even-handed justice he administered to  
all, sdon established a respect for bis per-  
son arkl authority; and perseverance und  
time wore down animosities, and re-unit-  
éd the citizens again into one family.  
  
Governor Lewis tad, from early life,  
been subject to bypochondriac «ffections.  
It was a constitutional disposition in all the  
nearer branches of the family of his name,  
and was more immediately inherited by  
him from his father. They had not, how-  
ever, been so strong as to give uneasiness  
to bistamily. While he lived with me in  
  
depressions of mind: but knowiig their  
constitutional source, I estimated their  
  
_ course by what I had seen in the family.

During his western. expedition, the con-

the fucuities of body and mind sagpended  
these distressing affections; but after bis  
establishment at St. Louis in sedentary  
occupations, they returned upon bim with  
  
| redoubied vigour, and began seriously to  
  
alarm his friends. He was ina paroxysm  
of one of these, when his affairs render-  
ed it necessary for him to go to Washing-  
ton. He proceeded to the Chickasaw  
Binffs, where he arrived on the sixteenth  
of September, 1809, with a view of con-  
tinuing his journey thence by water. Mr,  
Neeiy, agent of the U. States with the  
Chickasaw Indians, arriving there two days  
after, tound Lim extremely indisposed. and

him here to change his mind, and to take  
his course by land through the Chickasaw  
country. Although he appeared some-  
what relieved, Mr. Neely kindly determin-  
ed to accompany and watch over him.  
Unfortunately, at their encampment, after  
having passed the Tennessee one day’s  
journey, ‘hey lost two horses, which obli-  
ging Mr. Neely to halt for their recove-  
ry, the governor proceeded, under a pro-  
mise to wait for him at the house of the  
first white inhabitant on his road. He  
stopped at the house of a Mr. Grinder,  
who not being at home, his wife, alarmed  
at the symptoms ‘wf derangement she dis-  
covered, gave liim up the house and re-  
tired to rest herself in an out-house, the  
governor’s and Neely’s servants lodging  
in another. About three o’clock in the  
night he did the deed which plunged his  
friends into sffliction, and deprived his  
country of one of her most valued citizens,  
whose valor and intelligence would have  
been now employed in avenging the  
wrongs of his country, and in emulating  
by land the splendid deeds which have  
honored her arms on the ocean. It iost  
too to the nation the benefit of receiving  
from his own hand the narrative now offer-  
ed them of his&#x27;sufferings and successes,  
in endeavoring to extend for them the  
boundaries of sciehce, and to present to  
their knowledge that vast and fertile coun-  
try, which their sons are destined to fill  
with arts, with science, with freedom and  
happiness.  
  
Tothis melancholy close of the life of  
one, whom posterity wiii declare not to  
have livedin vein, | have only to add;  
that all the facts I have stated are either  
known to myself, or communicated by his

Monticello, August 18, 1813.  
SIR,  
  
In compliance with the request conveyed in your letter of  
May 25, have endeavoured to obtain from the relations and friends  
of the late governor Lewis, information of such incidents of his  
life as might be not unacceptable to those who may read the nar-  
rative of his western discoveries. The ordinary occurrences of a  
private life, and those also while acting in a subordinate sphere in  
the army, in atime of peace, are not deemed sufficiently interest-  
ing to occupy the public attention; but a general account of his  
parentage, with such smaller incidents as marked his early cha-  
racter are briefly noted; and to these are added, as being peculi-  
arly within my own knowledge, whatever related to the public,  
mission. The result of my inquiries and recollections shall now  
be offered, to be enlarged or abridged as you may think best; or  
otherwise to be used with the materials you may have collected  
from other sources.  
  
Meriwether Lewis, late governor of Louisiana, was born on thé  
18th of August, 1774, near the town of Charlottesville, in the  
county of Albemarle, in Virginia, of one of the distinguished  
families of that state. John Lewis, one of his father’s uncles, was  
a member of the king’s council, before the revolution. Another  
of them, Fielding Lewis, married a sister of general Washington.  
His father, William Lewis, was the youngest of five sons of colo-

nel Robert Lewis, of Albemarle, the fourth of whom, Charles,  
was one of the early patriots who stepped forwalll in the com-  
mencement of the revolution, and commanded one of the regi-  
ments first raised in Virginia, and placed on continental establish-  
ment. Happily situated at home, with a wife and young family,  
and a fortune placing him at ease, he left all to aid in the liberation  
of his country from foreign usurpations, then first unmasking their  
ultimate end and aim. His good sense, integrity, bravery, enter-  
prise, and remarkable bodily powers, marked him as an officer of  
great promise; but he unfortunately died early in the revolution.  
Nicholas Lewis, the second of his father’s brothers, commanded  
a regiment of militia in the successful expedition of 1776, against  
the Cherokee Indians; who seduced by the agents of the British  
government to take up the hatchet against us, had committed  
great havoc on our southern frontier, by murdering and scalping  
helpless women and children, according to their cruel and coward-  
ly principles of warfare. The chastisement they then received  
closed the history of their wars; and prepared them for receiving  
the elements of civilization, which zealously inculcated by the  
present government of the United States, have rendered them an  
industrious, peaceable, and happy people. This member of the  
family of Lewises, whose bravery was so usefully proved on this  
eccasion, was endeared to all who knew him by his inflexible  
probity, courteous disposition, benevolent heart, and engaging  
modesty and manners. He was the umpire of all the private dif-  
ferences of his county—selected always by both parties. He was  
also the guardian of Meriwether Lewis, of whom we are now to  
speak, and who had lost his father at an early age. He continued  
some years under the fostering care of a tender mother, of the  
respectable family of Meriwethers, of the same county; and was  
remarkable even in infancy for enterprise, boldness, and discretion.  
When only eight years of age he habitually went out, in the dead  
of night, alone with his dogs, into the forest, to hunt the raccoon  
and opossum, which, seeking their food in the night, can then on-  
ly be taken. In this exercise, no season or circumstance could  
obstruct his purpose—plunging through the winter’s snows and  
frozen streams in pursuit of his object. At thirteen he was put  
te the Latin school, and continued at that until eighteen, when he

returned to his mother, and entered on the cares of his farm; hav-  
ing, as well as a younger brother, been left by his father with a  
competency for all the correct and comfortable purposes of tem-~-  
perate life. His talent for observation, which had led him to an  
accurate knowledge of the plants and animals of his own country,  
would have distinguished him as a farmer; but at the age of twen-  
ty, yielding to the ardour of youth, and a passion for more daz-  
zling pursuits, he engaged as a volunteer in the body of militia  
which were called out by general Washington, on occasion of the  
discontents produced by the excise taxes in the western parts of  
the United States; and from that situation he was removed to the  
regular service as a lieutenant in the line. At twenty-three he was  
promoted to a captaincy; and, always attracting the first attention  
where punctuality and fidelity were requisite, he was appointed  
paymaster to his regiment. About this time a circumstance oc-  
curred, which, leading to the transaction which led to the expedi-  
tion to the Pacific ocean, will justify a recurrence to its original  
idea. While I resided in Paris, John Ledyard, of Connecticut, ar-  
rived there, well known in the United States for energy of body  
and mind. He had accompanied captain Cook on his voyage to  
the Pacific ocean; and distinguished himself on that voyage by his  
intrepidity. Being of a roaming disposition, he was now panting  
for some new enterprise. His immediate object at Paris was te  
  
  
  
  
  
engage a mercantile company in the fur-trade of the western  
coast of America, in which however he failed. I then proposed  
to him to go by land to Kamschatka, cross in some of the Russian  
vessels to Nootka Sound, fall down into the latitude of the Mis-  
souri, and penetrate to, and through that, to the United States. He  
eagerly seized the idea, and only asked to be assured of the per-  
mission of the Russian government. I interested, in obtaining that,  
M. de Simoulin, minister plenipotentiary of the empress at Paris,  
but more especially the baron de Grimm, minister plenipotentia-  
ry of Saxe-Gotha, her more special agent and correspondent there  
in matters not immediately diplomatic. Her permission was ob-  
tained, and an assurance of protection while the course of the  
voyage should be through her territories. Ledyard set out from  
Paris, and arrived at St. Petersburgh after the empress had left  
that place to pass the winter, I think, at Moscow. His finances

not permitting him to make unnecessary stay at St. Petersburgh,  
he left it with a passport from one of the ministers; and at two  
hundred miles from Kamschatka, was obliged to take up his win-  
ter quarters. He was preparing, in the spring to resume his jour-  
ney, when he was arrested by an officer of the empress, who by  
this time had changed her mind, and forbidden his proceeding.  
He was put into a close carriage, and conveyed day and night,  
without ever stopping, till they reached Poland, where he was set  
down, and left to himself. The fatigue of this journey broke down  
his constitution; and when he returned to Paris his bodily strength  
was much impaired. His mind, however, remained firm, and he  
after this undertook the journey to Egypt. I received a letter  
from him, full of sanguine hopes, dated at Cairo, the 15th of No-  
vember, 1788, the day before he was to set out for the head of the  
Nile; on which day, however, he ended his career and life: and  
thus failed the first attempt to explore the western part of our  
northern continent.  
  
In 1792, I proposed to the American Philosophical Society,  
that we. should set on foot a subscription to engage some compe-  
tent person to explore that region in the opposite direction; that  
is, by ascending the Missouri, crossing the Stony mountains, and  
descending the nearest river to the Pacific. Captain Lewis being  
then stationed at Charlottesville, on the recruiting service, warm-  
ly solicited me to obtain for him the execution of that object.  
I told him it was propesed that the person engaged should be at-  
tended by a single companion only, to avoid exciting alarm among  
the Indians. This did not deter him; but Mr. Andre Michaux, a  
professed botanist, author of the Flora Boreali-Americana, and of  
the Histoire des Chesnes d’Amerique, offering his services, they  
were accepted. He received his instructions, and when he had  
reached Kentucky in the prosecution of his journey, he was over-  
taken by an order from the minister of France, then at Philadel-  
phia, to relinquish the expedition, and to pursue elsewhere the  
botanical inquiries on which he was employed by that government:  
and thus failed the second attempt for exploring that region.  
  
In 1803, the act for establishing trading houses with the In-  
dian tribes being about to expire, some modifications of it were  
recommended: to congress by a confidential message of January

18th, and an extension of its views to the Indians on the Missou-  
ri. In order to prepare the way, the message proposed the send-  
ing an exploring party to trace the Missouri to its source, to cross  
the Highlands, and follow the best water-communication which  
offered itself from thence to the Pacific ocean. Congress ap-  
proved the proposition, and voted a sum of money for carrying it  
into execution. Captain Lewis, who had then been near two years  
with me as private secretary, immediately renewed his solicitations  
to have the direction of the party. I had now had opportunities  
of knowing him intimately. Of courage undaunted; possessing  
a firmness and perseverance of purpose which nothing but impos-  
sibilities could divert from its direction; careful as a father of those  
committed to his charge, yet steady in the maintenance of order  
and discipline; intimate with the Indian character, customs, and  
principles; habituated to the hunting life; guarded by exact ob-  
servation of the vegetables and animals of his own country, against  
losing time in the description of objects already possessed; hon-  
est, disinterested, liberal, of sound understanding, and a fidelity to  
truth so scrupulous, that whatever he should report would be as  
certain as if seen by ourselves; with all these qualifications, as if  
selected and implanted by nature in one body for this express pur-  
pose, I could have no hesitation in confiding the enterprise to him.  
To fill up the measure desired, he wanted nothing but a greater  
familiarity with the technical language of the natural sciences, and  
readiness in the astronomical observations necessary for the geo-  
graphy of his route. To acquire these he repaired immediately to  
Philadelphia, and placed himself under the tutorage of the dis-  
tinguished professors of that place, who with a zeai and emulation,  
enkindled by an ardent devotion to science, communicated to him  
freely the information requisite for the purposes of the journey.  
While attending too, at Lancaster, the fabrication of the arms with  
which he chose that his men should be provided, he had the bene-  
fit of daily communication with Mr. Andrew Ellicot, whose expe-  
rience in astronomical observation, and practice of it in the woods,  
enabled him to apprise captain Lewis of the wants and difficul-  
ties he would encounter, and of the substitutes and resources of.  
  
fered by a woodland and uninhabited country.

Deeming it necessary he should have some person with him  
of known competence to the direction of the enterprise, in the  
event of accident to himself, he proposed William Clark, brother  
of general George Rogers Clark, who was approved, and, with  
that view, received a commission of captain.  
  
In April, 1803, a draught of his instructions was sent to cap-

While these things were going on here, the country of Lou-  
isiana, lately ceded by Spain to France, had been the subject of  
negociation at Paris between us and this last power; and had actu-  
ally been transferred to us by treaties executed at Paris on the  
thirtieth of April. This information, received about the first  
day of July, increased infinitely the interest we felt in the expedi-  
tion, and lessened the apprehensions of interruption from other  
powers. Every thing inthis quarter being now prepared, cap-  
tain Lewis left Washington on the fifth of July 1803, and proceed-  
ed to Pittsburgh, where other articles had been ordered to be pro-  
vided for him. The men too were to be selected from the mili-  
tary stations on the Ohio. Delays of preparation, difficulties of  
navigation down the Ohio, and other untoward obstructions, retard-

of its citizens had taken a lively interest in the issue of this jour-  
ney, and looked forward with impatience for the information it  
would furnish. Their anxieties too for the safety of the corps had  
been kept in a state of excitement by lugubrious rumours, circu-  
lated from time to time on uncertain authorities, and uncontradict-  
ed by letters, or other direct information, from the time they had  
left the Mandan towns, on tieir ascent up the river in Aprii of the  
preceding year, 1805, until their actual return to St. Lewis.  
  
It was the middle of February, 1807, before captain Lewis,  
with. his companion captain Clark, reached the city of Washing-  
ton, where congress was then in session. That body granted  
to the two chiefs and their followers the donation of lands which  
they had been encouraged to expect in reward of their toil and  
dangers. Captain Lewis was soon after appointed governor of  
Louisiana, and captain Clark a general of its militia, and agent of  
the United States for Indian affairs in that department.  
  
A considerable time intervened before the governor’s arrival at  
St. Louis. He found the territory distracted by feuds and conten-  
tions among the officers of the government, and the people them-  
selves divided by these into factions and parties. He determined  
at once to take no side with either; but to use every endeavour to  
conciliate and harmonize them. The even-handed justice he ad-  
ministered to all, soon established a respect for his person and au-  
thority; and perseverance and time wore down animosities, and  
reunited the citizens again into one family.  
  
Governor Lewis had, from early life, been subject to hypo-  
chondriac affections. It was a constitutional disposition in all the  
nearer branches of the family of his name, and was more imme-  
diately inherited by him from his father. They had not, however,  
been so strong, as to give uneasiness to his family. While he liv-  
ed with me in Washington I observed at times sensible depres-  
sions of mind: but knowing their constitutional source, I estima-  
ted their course by what I had seen in the family. During his  
western expedition, the constant exertion which that required of  
all the faculties of body and mind, suspended these distressing af-  
fections; but after his establishment at St. Louis in sedentary occu-  
pations, they returned upon him with redoubled vigour, and began  
seriously to alarm his friends He was in a paroxysm of ‘one of  
these, when his affairs rendered it necessary for him to go to

Washington. He proceeded to the Chickasaw Bluffs, where he  
arrived on the 16th of September, 1809, with a view of continuing  
his journey thence by water. Mr. Neely, agent of the United  
States with the Chickasaw Indians, arriving there two days after,  
found him extremely indisposed, and betraying at times some  
symptoms of a derangement of mind. The rumours of a war  
with England, and apprehensions that he might lose the papers he  
was bringing on, among which were the vouchers of his public  
accounts, and the journals and papers of his western expedition,  
induced him here to change his mind, and to take his course by  
land through the Chickasaw country. Although he appeared  
somewhat relieved, Mr. Neely kindiy determined to accompany  
and watch over him. Unfortunately, at their encampment, after  
having passed the Tennessee one day’s journey, they lost two hor-  
ses, which obliging Mr. Neely to halt for their recovery, the go-  
vernor proceeded, under a promise to wait for him at the house of  
the first white inhabitant on his road. He stopped at the house of  
a Mr. Grinder, who not being at home, his wife, alarmed at the  
symptoms of derangement she discovered, gave him up the house  
and retired to rest herself in an out-house, the governor’s and  
Neely’s servants lodging in another. About three o’clock in the  
night he did the deed which plunged his friends into affliction, and  
deprived his country of one of her most valued citizens, whose  
valour and intelligence would have been now employed ia avenging  
her wrongs, and in emulating by land the splendid deeds which  
have honoured her arms on the ocean. It lost too to the nation the  
benefit of receiving from his own hand the narrative now offer-  
ed them of his sufferings and successes, in endeavouring to ex-  
tend for them the boundaries of science, and to present to their  
knowledge that vast and fertile country, which their sons are des-  
tined to fill with arts, with science, with freedom and happiness.  
  
To this melancholy close of the life of one, whom posterity  
will declare not to have lived in vain, I have only to add, that all  
the facts I have stated are either known to myself, or communica-  
ted by his family or others, for whose truth I have no hesitation to  
make myself responsible; and I conclude with tendering you the  
assurances of my respect and consideration.

3 Monticello, August 18, 1813.  
Sir,  
  
3 Py ,  
In compliance. with the request conveyed in your letter of  
May 25, I have endeavored to obtain from the relations and  
friends of the late Governor Lewis, information of such incidents  
of his life as might be not unaceptable to those who may read the  
narrative of his western discovenes. The o:dinary occurrences of  
a private life, and those also while acting in a suborninate sphere  
in the army, in a time of peace, are not deemed sufficiently iw  
teresting to occupy the public attention; but a general account  
of bis parentage, with such smaller incidents as marked his early  
character are brictly noted; and to these are added, as being pes  
culiarly within my own knowledge, whatever related to the pube  
lic mission, of which an account is now to be published. The re«  
sult of my inquiries and recollections shall now be «ffered, to be  
enlarged or abridged as you may think best; or otherwise to be  
used with the materials you may have collected from others  
sources.  
  
Meriwether Lewis, late governor of Louisiana, was born on the  
eighteenth of August, 1774, near the town of Chatlortesville, im  
the county of Albemarle, in Virginia, of one of the distinguished  
families of that state. John Lewis, one of his father’s uncles,  
was a member of the king’s council, before the revolution. Ane  
other of them, Fielding Lewis, married a sister of General Wash.  
ington. His father, William Lewis, was the youa of five  
sons of Colonel Robert Lewis of Albemarle, the fourth of whom,  
Charles, was one of the early patriots who stepped forward in  
the commencement of the revolution, and commanded one of the  
regiments first raised in Virginia, and placed on continental estae  
blishment. Happily situaced at home, with a wife and young  
family, and fortune placing him at ease, he left all to aid in the  
liberation ef his countiy from foreign usurpations, then first un-  
masking their ultimate end and aim. His good sense, integrity,  
bravery. enterprise, and rematkable bodily powers, marked him  
as an officer of great promise; but he unfortunately died early in  
the revolution, Nicholas Lewis, the second of his father’s fo  
thers, commanded a regiment of militia in the successful expedi-  
tion of 1776, against the Cherokee Indians: who. seduced by the  
agent of the British government to take up the hatchet aguinst  
us, had committed great havoc on our southern frontier. by mure  
dering and sealping helpless wowen and children, according to  
their cruel and cowardly principles of warfare. The chastisement  
they then received closed the history of their wars, aud prepared  
them for receiving the e‘ements of civilization, which, zealously  
inculeated by the present government of the United States, have  
rendered them an industrious, peaceable. and happy people. This  
member of the family of Lewises, whose bravery was so uses  
fully proved on this occasion, was endeared to all who knew hina  
by his inflexible probity, courteous disposition, benevolent heart  
and engaging modesty and manners. He was the umpire of all  
the private differences of his county—selected always by both par-  
ties. He wasalso the guardian of Meriwether Lewis, of whom  
we are now to speak, and who had lost his father at an early age.  
He continued some years under the fostering care of a tender  
mother, of the respectable family of Meriwethers, of the same  
county; and was remarkable even im infancy for enterprise, bold-  
ness, and discretion. When only eight years of age he habitually  
went out, in the dead of night alone with his dogs, into the forest,  
to hunt the racoorm and opossum, which, seeking their food in the  
night, can then only be taken. In this exercise no seasoi: or cireume  
stance could obstruct his pu&quot;pose—piunging through the winter&#x27;s  
snows and frozen streams in pursuit of his object. At thirteen  
he was put to the Latin school. and continued at that‘ until  
eighteen. when he returned to his mother, and entered on the  
cares of his farm; having, as well as a younger brother been left  
by his father with a competency for all the correct and comforta-  
ble purposes of a temperate life. His talent for observation  
which had led him to an accurate knowledge of the plants and  
animals of his own country, would have distinguished him as a  
farmer; but, at the age of twenty, yielding to the ardour of youth  
and a passion for more dazzling pursuits, he engaged as a volun-  
teer in the body of militia which were called out by General  
Washington, on oecasion of the diseontents produced by the exe  
cise taxes in the western parts of the United States; and from  
that situation he was removed to the regular service as a lientem  
ant in the line. At twenty-three he was promoted to a captaincy;  
and always attracting the first attention where punctuality and  
fidelity were requisite, he was appointed paymaster to his vegi-  
ment. About this time a circumstance occurred, which, leading  
to the transaction which is the subject of this book, will justify a  
recurrence to its original ideas While I resided at Paris, John  
Ledyard, of Connecticut, arrived there, well known in the U) ited  
States for energy of body and mind. He had aceompanied Cap-  
tain Cook on his voyage to the Pacific Ocean; and distinguished  
himself on that voyage by his intrepidity. Being of a roaming  
dispusition, he was now panting for some new enterprise. Hie  
immediate siged it Paris was to engage a mercantile company  
in the fur-trade of the western coa-t of America, in which, howe  
ever, he failed. I then proposed to him to go by land to Kam.  
schatka, cross in some of the Russian vesscls to Nootka Sound  
fall down into the latitude of the Missouri, and penetrate to, and  
through that to the United States. He eagerly seized the idea,  
and only asked to be assured of the permission of the Kussian  
government. I interested, in obtaining that, M. de Simouilin,  
minister plenipotentiary of the empress at Paris, but more espe.

not immediately diplomatic. Her permission was obtained and  
a» assurance of protection while the course of the voyage should  
be through her territories. Ledyard set out from Paris, and ar-  
rived at St. ae after the empress had left that place to.  
poss the winter, I think, at Moscow. His finances not permit)  
ting him to make unnecessary stay at St. Petersburgh, he left it |  
with a passport from one of the ministers; and at two hundred |  
miles from Kamschatka, was obliged to take up his winter quar.  
ters. He was preparing, in the spring, to resume his journey,  
when he was arrested by an officer of the empress, who by this  
tine had changed her mind, and forbidden his proceeding. He  
  
Was put into a Close carriage, and conveyed, day and wight, with .  
out ever stopping till they reached Poland; where he was set  
  
down and left to himself. ‘Uhe fatigue of this journey broke  
  
down his constitution; and when he returned to Paris his bodily  
  
health was much impaired. His mind, however, remained firm,  
  
and he atter this undertook the journey to Egypt. I received a  
  
letter from him, full of sanguine hopes, dated at Cairo, the fif-  
  
teenth of November, 1788, the day before he was to set out for  
  
the head of the Nile; on which day, however. he ended his career  
  
and lite: aud thus failed the first attempt to explore the western  
  
part of our northern continent. ; : :  
  
In 1792, | proposed to the American Philosophical Society  
that we should set on fuot a subscription to engage some compe-  
tent person to ex Se that region in the opposite direction; that  
is by ascending the Missouri, crossing the Stony mountains, and  
descending the nearest river to the Pacific. Captain Lewis being  
then stationed at Charlottesville, o the recruiting service, watim-  
ly solicited me to obtain for him the exeeution of that object. I  
told him it was proposed that the person engaged should be at-  
tended by a single companion only, to avoid ea citing alarm among  
the Indians. This did not deter him; but Mr. Audre Michaus  
a professed botanist, author of the Ilora Boreali-Americana and  
of the Histoire des Chesnes d’Amerique, offering his services,  
they were accepted. He received his instructions, and when he  
had reached Kentucky in the prosecution of his journey, he was  
overtaken by ancrder from the minister ot France then at Phila  
delphia, to relinquish the expedition, and to pursue elsewhere the  
butanical inquiries on which he was employed by that govern-  
ment: and thus failed the second attempt for exploring that re-  
  
jon.  
  
In 1803, the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian  
tribes being about to expire, some modifications of it were recom.  
mended to Congress, by a confidential message of January 15th,  
and an extension of its views to the Indiauson the Missouri. In  
order to prepare the way, the message proposed the sending au ex-  
  
Joring party to trace the Missouri toits source, to cross the High-  
finds, and follow the best water communication which offered it-  
self, from thence to the Pacific ocean. Congress approved the pro-  
position, and yoted a sum of money for carryiig 1t Into execution.  
Capt. Lewis, who had then been near two years with me as private  
secretary, immedi. tely renewed bis sulicitations to have the diree-  
tion of the party, I had now had opportunities of Knowing him  
intimately. Of courage undaunted; possessing a firmness and  
  
rseverance of purpose which nothing but impossibiiities could  
Sivett from its direction; careful as a father of those committed  
to his charge, yet steady in the maintenance of order and discip-  
line; intimate with the Indian character, customs, and principles;  
habituated to the hunting life; guarded, by exact obseivation of  
the vegetables and animals of his own country, against losing  
time in the description of objects already possessed; honest, dis-  
interested liberal, of sound understanding. and a fidelity to truth  
so scrupulous, that whatever he should report would be as certain  
as if see: by ourselves; with all these quahfications, as if selected  
and implauted by nature in one body for this express purpose, 1  
could have no hesitation in confiding the enterprise te him. ‘Lo  
fill up the measure desired, he wanted nothing but a greater fa-  
miliarity with the technical langu ge of the natural sciences, and  
readiness in the astronomical observations necessary tor the geo-  
graphy of his route. To acquire these he repaired imsuediately  
to Philadelphia and placed himself under the tutorage of the  
distinguished professors of that place, who witha zeal and emu-  
lation, enkindled by an ardent devotion to science, Communicated  
so bim freely the information requisite tor the purposes of the  
journey. While attending too, at Lancaster, the fabrication of  
the arms with which he chose that his men should be provided,  
he had the benefit of daily commumieation with Mr. Andrew El-  
licot, whose experience in astronomical observation, and practice  
of it in the woods. enabled him to apprise Captain Lewis of the  
wants and difficulties he would encounter, and of the substitutes  
and resources offered by a woodland and uninhabited country.  
  
Deeming it necessary he should have some person with hiin of  
known competence to the direction of the enterprise, in the event  
of accident to himself, he propused William Clarke, brother of  
General George Rogers Clarke, whe was approved of, and with  
that view, received a commission of captain.  
  
In April, 1803, a draft of his instructions was sent to Captain  
Lewis, and on the twentieth of June they were signed in the fol-  
lowing forin:

While these things were going on here, the country of Louisi-  
ana, lately ceded by Spain to France, had been the subject of ne-  
gotiation at Paris between us and this last power; and had actu-  
ally been transferred to us by treaties, executed at Paris on the  
30th of April. This information, received about the Ist day of  
July, increased infinitely the interest we felt in the expedition,  
and lessened the apprehensions of interruption from other pows  
ers. Every thing in this quarter being now prepared, captain  
Lew s left Washington on the 5th of July, 1803, and proceeded  
&#x27;o Pittsburg, where other articles had been ordered to be provid-  
ed for him. Uhe men too were to be selecced from the military  
stations on the Ohio. Delays of preparation, difficulties of nae  
vigation down the Ohio, and other untoward obstructions, re-  
tarded his arrival at Cahokia uvtil the season was so far advane-  
ed as to render it prudent to suspend his entering the Missouri  
before the ice should break up in the succeeding spring.  
  
From this time his journal, now published, will give the histo-  
ry of his journey to and from the Pacific ocean, uatil his return  
to St. Louis on the 23d of September, 1806. Never did a similar  
event excite more joy through the United States. The humblest  
of their citizens had taken a lively interest in the issue of this  
journey, and looked forward with impatience for the information  
it would furnish. Chetry anxieties too for the safety of the corps  
had been kept ina state of excitement by lugubrious rumours,  
circulated trom time tu time on uncertain authorities, and un  
con&#x27;radicted by letters, or other direet information, from the

Conformably to our usual plan, we accompany the por-  
trait with a biographical sketch, drawn as briefly as possible,  
as the subject of it is already so generally known: it is taken  
from the life of captain Lewis, written by Mr. Jefferson, and  
prefixed to the interesting history of the expedition to the  
Pacific Ocean, under the command of captains Lewis and  
Clark. The passages marked with inverted commas are  
given in Mr.-Jeflerson’s own words.  
  
MERIWETHER Lewis, late governor of Louisiana, was born  
on the 18th of August, 1774, near Charlottesville, in Virginia, of  
one of the distinguished families of that state. Having lost his  
father at an early age, he continued some years under the care of  
a tender mother, and was remarkable even in his childhood for  
enterprise, boldness, and discretion. At thirteen he was put to  
the Latin school, and continued at that until eighteen, when he  
returned to his mother, and entered on the care of his farm;  
having been left by his father with a competency. “ His talent  
for observation, which had led him to an accurate knowledge of  
the plants and animals of his own country, would have distin-  
guished him as a farmer; but at the age of twenty, yielding to the  
ardour of youth, and a passion for more dazzJing pursuits, he en-

gaged as a volunteer in the body of militia which were called out  
by general Washington, on occasion of the discontents produced  
by the excise taxes in the western parts of the United States; and  
from that situation he was removed to the regular service as a  
lieutenant in the line. At twenty-three he was promoted to a cap-  
taincy; and, always attracting the first attention where punctuality  
and fidelity were requisite, he was appointed paymaster to his  
regiment.”  
  
“In 1803, the act for establishing trading houses with the  
Indian tribes being about to expire, some modifications of it were  
recommended to congress by a confidential message of January  
18th, and an extension of its views to the Indians on the Missouri.  
In order to prepare the way, the message proposed the sending  
an exploring party to trace the Missouri to its source, to cross the  
highlands, and follow the best water-communication which offer-  
ed itself from thence to the Pacific ocean. Congress approved  
the proposition, and voted a sum of money for carrying it into  
execution. Captain Lewis, who had then been near two years  
with me as private secretary, immediately renewed his solicita-  
tions to have the direction of the party. I had now had oppor-  
tunities of knowing him intimately. Of courage undaunted, pos-  
sessing a firmness and perseverance of purpose which nothing  
but impossibilities could divert from its direction; careful as a fa-  
ther of those committed to his charge, yet steady in the mainte-  
nance of order and discipline; intimate with the Indian character,  
customs, and principles; habituated to the hunting life; guarded,  
by exact observation of the vegetables and animals of his own  
country, against losing time in the description of objects already  
possessed; honest, disinterested, liberal, of sound understanding,  
and a fidelity to truth so scrupulous, that whatever he should re-  
port would be as certain as if seen by ourselves; with all these  
qualifications, as if selected and implanted by nature in one body  
for this express purpose, I could have no hesitation in confiding  
the enterprise to him. To fill up the measure desired, he want-  
ed nothing but a greater familiarity with the technical language  
  
of the natural sciences, and readiness in the astronomical obser-  
vations necessary for the geography of his route. To acquire these  
he repaired immediately to Philadelphia, and placed himself u

“ Deeming it necessary he should have some person with  
him of known competence to the direction of the enterprise, in the  
event of accident to himself, he proposed William Clark, bro-  
ther of general George Rogers Clark, who was approved, and,  
with that view, received a commission of captain.”’  
  
&#x27; Tn April, 1803, captain Lewis received a draught of his in-  
structions for the expedition. |  
  
“ While these things were going on here, the country of  
Louisiana, lately ceded by Spain to France, had been the sub-  
ject of negociation at Paris between us and this last power; and  
had actually been transferred to us by treaties executed at Paris  
on the thirtieth of April. This information, received about the  
first day of July, increased infinitely the interest we felt in the ex-  
pedition, and lessened the apprehensions of interruption from  
other powers. Every thing in this quarter being new prepared,  
captain Lewis left Washington on the fifth of July, 1803, and pro-  
ceeded to Pittsburg, where other articles had been ordered to be  
provided for him. The men too were to be selected from the  
military stations on the Ohio. Delays of preparation, difficulties  
of navigation down the Ohio, and other untoward obstructions, re-  
tarded his arrival at Cahokia until the season was so far ad-  
vanced as to render it prudent to suspend his entering the Mis-  
souri before the ice should break up in the succeeding spring.  
  
“From this time his journal, now published, will give the his-  
tory of his journey to and from the Pacific ocean, until his return  
to St. Louis on the twenty-third day of September, 1806. Never  
did a similar event excite more joy through the United States.  
The humblest of its citizens had taken a lively interest in the  
issue of this journey, and looked forward with impatience for the  
information it would furnish.  
  
“ It was the middle of February, 1807, before captain Lewis,  
with his companion captain Clark, reached the city of Washing-  
ton, where congress was then in session. That body granted to

had been encouraged to expect in reward of their toil and dangers.  
Captain Lewis was soon after appointed governor of Louisiana,  
and captain Clark a general of its militia, and agent of the  
United States for Indian affairs in that department.  
  
“ A considerable time intervened before the governor’s arri-  
val at St. Louis. He found the territory distracted by feuds and  
contentions among the officers of the government, and the people  
themselves divided by these into factions and parties. He deter-  
mined at once to take no side with either; but to use every en-  
deavour to conciliate and harmonize them. The even-handed  
justice he administered to all soon established a respect for his  
person and authority; and perseverance and time wore down ani-  
mosities, and reunited the citizens again into one family.  
  
“ Governor Lewis had, from early life, been subject to hypo-  
chondriac affections. It was a constitutional disposition in all the  
nearer branches of the family of his name, and was hore imme-  
diately inherited by him from his father. They had not, however,  
been so strong as to give uneasiness to his family. While he lived  
with me in Washington I observed at times sensible depressions  
of mind; but knowing their constitutional source, I estimated their  
course by what I had seen in the family. During his western  
expedition, the constant exertion which that required of all the  
faculties of body and mind, suspended these distressing affections;  
but after his establishment at St. Louis in sedentary occupations,  
they returned upon him with redoubled vigour, and began se-  
riously to alarm his friends. He was in a paroxysm of one of these  
when his affairs rendered it necessary for him to go to Washing-  
ton. He proceeded to the Chickasaw Bluffs, where he arrived  
on the sixteenth September, 1809, with a view of continuing his  
journey thence by water. Mr. Neely, agent of the United States  
with the Chickasaw Indians, arriving there two days after, found  
him extremely indisposed, and betraying at times some symptoms  
of a derangement of mind. The rumours of a war with England,  
and apprehensions that he might lose the papers he was bringing  
on, among which were the vouchers of his public accounts, and  
the journals and papers of his western expedition, induced him  
here to change his mind, and. to take his course by land through  
  
the Chickasaw country. Although he appeared somewhat re

ever him. Unfortunately, at their encampment, after having pass-  
ed the Tennessee one day’s journey, they lost. two horses, which  
obliging Mr. Neely to halt for their recovery, , the governor pro-  
ceeded, under a promise to wait for him at the house of the first  
white inhabitant on his road. He stopped at the house of a Mr.  
Grinder, who not being at home, his wife, alarmed at the symp-  
toms of derangement she discovered, gave him up the house and  
retired to. rest herself in an out-house, the governor’s and Neely’s  
servants lodging in another. About three o’clock in the night he  
did the deed which plunged his friends into affliction, and de-  
prived his country of one of her most valued citizens, whose va-  
lour and intelligence would have been now employed in avenging  
the wrongs of his country, and in emulating by land the splendid  
deeds which have honoured her arms on the ocean.* It lost too  
to the nation the benefit of receiving from his own hand the nar-  
rative of his sufferings and successes, in endeavouring to extend  
for them the boundaries of science, and to present to their know-  
ledge that vast and fertile country, which their sons are destined  
to fill with arts, with science, with freedom and happiness.”

Meriwether Lewis, late governor of Louisi-  
ania, was born in August, 1774, near Char-  
lottesville, Virginia, of one of the distinguished  
families of that state. Having lost his father  
at an early age, he continued some years un-  
der the care of a tender mother, and was re-  
markable, even in his childhood, for enterprise,  
boldness and discretion. At thirteen he was  
put to the Latin school, and continued at that  
until eighteen, when he again returned to his  
mother, and entered on the care of his farm;  
having been left by his father with a compe-  
tency. His talent for observation, which had  
led him to an accurate knowledge of the plants  
and animals of his own country, would have  
distinguished him as a farmer; but at the age  
of twenty, yielding to the ardour of youth, and  
  
®,a passion for more dazzling pursuits, he engag-  
  
ed as a volunteer in the body of militia which  
were called out by general Washington, on oc-  
casion of the discontents produced by the ex-  
cise taxes in the western parts of the United  
States; and from that situation he was removed  
to the regular service as a lieutenant in the  
line. At twenty-three he was promoted to a

‘houses with the Indian tribes being about to  
  
expire, some modifications of it were recom-  
mended to congress by a confidential message  
of January 18th, and an extension of its views  
to the Indians on the Missouri. In order to  
prepare the way, the message proposed the  
sending an exploring party to trace the Mis-  
souri to its source, to cross the highlands, and  
follow the best water communication which  
offered itself from thence to the Pacific ocean.  
Congress approved the proposition, and voted  
a sum of money for carrying it into execution.  
Captain Lewis, who had then been near two  
years with me as private secretary, immedi-  
ately renewed his solicitations to have the di-  
rection of the party. I had now had oppor-  
tunities of knowing him intimately. Of cour-  
age undaunted, possessing a firmness and per-  
severance of purpose which nothing but im-  
possibilities could divert from its direction;  
careful as a father of those commiitted to his  
charge, yet steady in the maintenance of order  
and discipline; intimate with the Indian char-  
acter, customs, and»principles; ‘habituated to  
the hunting life; guarded by exact observa-  
tion of the vegitables and animals of his own  
country, against losing time in the description  
of objects already possessed; honest, disinter-  
ested, liberal, of sound understanding, and a  
fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever  
he should report would be as ccrtain as if seen  
by ourselves; with all these qualifications, as  
if, selected and implanted by nature in one body  
for this express purpose, I could have no hesi-  
tation in confiding the enterprise to him. To  
fill up the measure desired, he wanted nothing  
but a greater familiarity with the technical  
language of the natural sciences, and readiness  
in the astronomical observations necessary for  
the geography of his route. To acquire these  
he repaired immediately to Philadelphia, and  
placed himself under the tutorage of the dis-  
tinguished professors of that place, who with  
a zeal and emulation, enkindled by an ardent  
devotion to science, communicated to him  
freely the information requisite for the purpo-  
ses of the journey.  
Deeming it necessary he should have some  
rson with him of known competence to the  
irection of the enterprise, in the event of ac-  
cident to himself, he proposed William Clark,  
brother of general George Rogers Clark, who  
was approved, and, with that view, received a  
commission as captain.  
In April, 1803,,captain Lewis received a  
draught of his instructions for the expedition.  
While these things were going on here, the  
country of Louisiania, lately ceded by Spain to  
France, had been the subject of negociation at  
Paris between us and this last power; and had  
actually been transferred to us by treaties ex-  
ecuted at Paris on the thirtieth of April. This  
information, received about the first day of Ju-  
ly, increased infinitely the interest we felt in  
the expedition, and lessened the apprehensions  
of interruption from other powers. Every  
thing in this quarter being now prepared, cap-  
tain Lewis left Washington on the fifth of Ju-  
ly, 1803, and to Pittsburg, where  
other articles had been ordered to be provided  
for him. The men too were to be selected  
from the military stations on the Ohio. De-  
lays. of preparation, difficulties of navigation

tions, retarded his arrival at Cahokia until the  
season was so far advanced as to render it pru-  
dent to suspend his entering the Missouri be-  
fore the ice should break up in the succeed-  
ing spring.  
  
From this time his journal, now published,  
will give the history of his journey to and from  
the Pacific ocean, until his return to St. Louis,  
on the twenty-third day of September, 1806.  
Never did a similar event excite more joy  
through the United States. The humblest of  
its citizens had taken a lively interest in the  
issue of this journey, and looked forward with  
impatience for the information it would furnish.  
  
It was the middle of February, 1807, before  
captain Lewis, with his companion captain  
Clark, reached the city of Washington, where  
congress was then in session. That body grant-  
ed to the two chiefs and their followers the do-  
nation of lands which they had been encourag-  
ed to expect in reward of their toil and dan-  
gers. Captain Lewis was soon after appointed  
governor of Louisiania, and captain Clark a  
gencral of its militia, and agent of the United  
States for Indian affairs in that department.  
  
A considerable time intervened before the  
governor’s arrival at St. Louis. He found the  
territory distracted by feudssand contentions  
among the officers of the government, and the  
people themselves divided by these into fac-  
tions and parties. He determined at once to  
take no side with either; but to use every en-

even-handed justice he administered toall soon  
established a respect for his person and author-  
ity ; and perseverance and time wore down an-  
imosities, and reunited the citizens again inte  
one family.  
  
Governor Lewis had, from early life, been  
subject to hypocondriac affections. It wasa  
constitutional disposition in all the nearer  
branches of the family of his name, and was  
more immediately inherited by him from his  
father. They had not, however, been so strong  
as to give uneasiness to hisfamily. While he  
lived with me in Washington, I observed at  
times sensible depressions of mind; but know-  
ing their constitutional source, I estimated their  
course by what I had seen in the family. Du-  
ring his western expedition, the constant ex-

‘est portion of the continent from ocean to ocean, This attempt is scarcely known by the public to  
have been made at all, and is mentioned by Mr. Jefferson alone, and by him only in a cursory way.  
Mr. J. relates that Ledyard called upon him in Paris, panting for some new enterprise, after his suc-  
cessful voyage with Captain Cook ; and that he (Mr, J.) proposed to him that he should go by land  
to Kamschatka, cross in, some of the Russian vessels to Nootka Sound, fall down into the latitude of  
the Missouzi, and then, striking through the country, pass down that river to the United States.—  
Ledyard agreed to the proposal provided the permission of the Russian government could be obtain-  
  
ed... Mr. Jefferson succeeded in obtaining this; and the traveller, setting out from Panis, arrived at  
St. Petersburgh after the Empress had left that place to pass the winter at Moscow. His finances  
not permitting him to. make unnecessary stay at St, P., he continued on his route with a passport  
from one of the ministers, and, at two hundred miles from Kamschatka, was arrested by an officer  
of the Empress, who had changed her mind, and now forbade his proceeding. He was put into.a  
close carriage, and driven day and night, without stopping, till he reached Poland, where he was set  
down and dismissed. Mr. Jefferson, in speaking of Ledyard’s undertaking, erroneously calls it “ the  
Jirst atvempt to explore the western part of our northern continent.”

‘* While I resided in Paris, John Ledyard of Connecticut  
arrived there, well known in the United States for energy of  
body and mind. He had accompanied Captain Cook on his  
voyage to the Pacific Ocean, and distinguished himself on  
that voyage by his intrepidity. Being of a roaming disposition,  
he was now panting for some new enterprise. His immediate  
object at Paris was to engage a mercantile company in the  
fur trade of the western coast of America, in which, however,  
he failed. I proposed to him to go by land to Kamschatka,  
cross in some of the Russian vessels to Nootka Sound, fall  
down into the latitude of the Missouri, and penetrate to and  
through that to the United States. He eagerly seized the idea,  
and only asked to be assured of the permission of the Russian  
government. I interested, in obtaining that, M. de Simoulin,  
minister plenipotentiary of the Empress}at Paris, but more  
especially the Baron de Grimm, minister plenipotentiary of  
Saxe-Gotha, her more especial agent and correspondent there,  
in matters not immediately diplomatic. Her permission was  
obtained, and an assurance of protection while the course of  
the voyage should be through her territories. Ledyard set out  
from Paris, and arrived at St. Petersburg after the Empress  
had left that place to pass the winter, 1 think, at Moscow.  
His finances not permitting him to make unnecessary stay at  
St. Petersburg, he left it with a passport from one of the min-  
isters ; and at two hundred miles from Kamschatka was obliged  
to take up his winter-quarters. He was preparing, in the  
spring, to resume his journey, when he was arrested by an offi-  
cer of the Empress, who by this time had changed her mind,  
and forbidden his proceeding. He was put into a close car-  
riage, and conveyed day and night without ever stopping, till  
they reached Poland ; where he was set down, and left to him-  
self. The fatigue of this journey broke down his constitution ;  
and when he returned to Paris his bodily strength was much  
impaired. His mind, however, remained firm, and he after  
this undertook the journey to Egypt.’ *

84 Discovery beyond the Rocky Mountains. [ Jan.  
  
Thus ended the first serious attempt to explore the west-  
ern part of our northern continent. But Mr. Jefferson did  
not lose sight of the object. In 1792, he proposed to the  
American Philosophical Society to set on foot a subscription  
to engage some suitable person to explore that region in the  
natural direction ; that is, by ascending the Missouri, cross-  
ing the Rocky Mountains, and descending the nearest river  
to the Pacific. Captain Meriwether Lewis, of the United  
States’ army, was selected for the undertaking. André Mi-  
chaux, the botanist, and author of the ‘* Flora Borealis- Amer-  
icana,”’ was then in this country ; and, at his solicitation, he  
was allowed to accompany Lewis, the plan being, that, to  
avoid exciting alarm among the Indians, they should go alone.  
Michaux himself had reached Kentucky in the prosecution  
of his journey ; when the French minister in the United  
States interposed, (Michaux being here at the expense of th

The failure of this attempt occasioned by the jealousy of the Russian  
Empress only served to impress the design more deeply upon the  
mind of Mr. Jefferson, and in 1792 he proposed to the American Phi-  
losophical Society to employ by subscription some competent person,  
to explore the western regions by land. Capt. Lewis warmly solicited  
this position. Mr. Jefferson told him that it was contemplated that  
the person engaged should be attended by a single companion only to  
avoid exciting the Indians, but he still persisted in his solicitation.

Americana, offering his services they were accepted, and after receiv-

The proposed expedition of Ledyard, though undertaken at  
the instance of the American Minister in Paris, can searcely be  
regarded as a governmental effort. It is of interest, however,  
as leading up to the second attempt, which also was inspired  
and placed on foot by Jefferson.  
  
“In 1792,” writes Jefferson, “I proposed to the American  
Philosophical Society, that we should set on foot a subscrip-  
tion to engage some competent person to explore those regions  
in the opposite direction, that is by ascending the Missouri,  
crossing the Stony Mountains, and descending the nearest river  
to the Pacitic.*  
  
“Captain Meriwether Lewis being then stationed at Char-  
lottesville on the recruiting service, warmly solicited me to ob-  
tain for him the execution of that object. I told him that it

The proposed expedition of Ledyard, though undertaken  
at the instance of the American Minister in Paris, can  
scarcely be regarded as a governmental effort. It is of  
interest, however, as leading up to the second attempt,  
which also was inspired and placed on foot by Jefferson.  
  
“In 1792,” writes Jefferson, “I proposed to the American  
Philosophical Society, that we should set on foot a sub-  
scription to engage some competent person to explore those  
regions in the opposite direction, that is, by ascending the  
Missouri, crossing the Stony Mountains, and descending the  
nearest river to the Pacific.’  
  
“Captain Meriwether Lewis, being then stationed at  
Charlottesville on the recruiting service, warmly solicited me  
to obtain for him the execution of that object. I told him  
that it was proposed that the person engaged should be  
attended by a single companion only, to avoid exciting  
alarm among the Indians. This did not deter him; but  
Mr. André Michaux, a professed botanist, author of the  
‘Flora Boreali-Americana,’ and of the ‘ Histoire des Chénes

occasion of the discontents produced by the excise laws in the western

residence in Paris, John Ledyard, of Connecticut, arrived there with the  
object of engaging a mercantile company in the fur trade, in which, how-  
ever, he failed. He had accompanied Captain Cook on his voyage to the  
Pacific ocean, and he distinguished himself for his valor and endurance.  
  
Mr. Jefferson proposed to him to make his way by land to Kamtchatka,  
embark in a Russian vessel for Nootka sound, pass into the latitude of  
Missouri and thence into the United States. Mr. Ledyard was pleased  
with the suggestion, and Mr. Jefferson obtained from Baron de Grimm,  
M. P., of Saxe-Gotha, the special agent of the Russian government, then  
residing in Paris, permission from the empress of Russia for him to pass  
through her territories with an assurance of protection. Ledyard left  
Paris and proceeded to St. Petersburg after the empress had left there for  
Moscow. . Procuring a passport from one of the ministers, he left St.  
Petersburg, but was compelled to take up his winter quarters about two  
hundred miles from Kamtchatka. While making preparations to resume

In 1792 Mr. Jefferson conceived the idea of setting on foot a subscrip-  
tion to employ some competent person to explore this same region in the  
opposite direction ; that is, by ascending the Missouri river, crossing the  
Stony or Rocky mountains, and descending the nearest river to the Pa-  
cific ocean. At this time Captain Lewis was stationed at Charlottesville,  
Virginia, on recruiting service, and he solicited Mr. Jefferson to obtain for  
him the appointment. It being important that the person engaged should  
have a single companion only (it being thought that a large number would  
excite alarm among the Indians), Mr. André Michoux, a botanist, and  
author of the Flora Boreali-A mericana and of Histoire des Chénes ad’ Amer-  
ique, was employed as his companion. Captain Lewis, hzving received his  
instructions, set out in company of Mr. Michoux, and had proceeded as  
far as Kentucky when Mr. Michoux was overtaken by an order from the  
French minister to relinquish the expedition, and by this means the sec-  
ond attempt for exploring that region was defeated.  
  
In 1803, the act of congress establishing trading-houses with the  
Indians being about to expire, President Jefferson, in a confidential mes-  
sage to congress, recommended some modification of the law and its  
extension to the Indian tribes on the Missouri, The message recom-  
mended that an exploring party be sent out to trace the Missouri river  
to its source ; to cross the highlands and follow the best water communi-  
cation to be found from thence to the Pacific ocean. The proposition

into execution, Captain Lewis had been serving for two years previous  
to the passage of this act as private secretary to President Jefferson, and  
immediately on its passage he applied to the President for the appoint-  
ment of director tothe expedition. “ Knowing him from long and intimate  
association” [we quote the language of Mr, Jefferson] “to have courage  
undaunted, possessing a firmness and perseverance of purpose which  
nothing but impossibilities could divert from its direction, careful as a  
father of those committed to his charge, yet steady in the maintenance of

Captain Lewis left Washington on the 5th of July, 1803, and proceeded  
at once to Pittsburgh, where many of the articles prepared and fitted for  
the use of the expedition had been forwarded. The men to accompany  
him were to be selected {rom the military posts on the Ohio river.  
Many causes conspired to retard the movement of the expedition, among  
which not the least was the difficulty of navigation down the Ohio,  
Hence the party did not arrive at Cahokia until the season was too  
far advanced to enter the Missouri with safety, and the movement was

GOVERNOR MERRIWETHER LEWIS I4I  
  
Mr. Jefferson, in his sketch of Governor Lewis, speaking of the return  
of the expedition, says: “Never did a similar event excite more joy  
through the United States. The humblest of its citizens had taken a lively  
interest in the issue of this journey, and looked forward with impatience  
to the information it would furnish. Their anxiety, too, for the safety of  
the corps had been kept in a state of excitement by lugubrious rumors  
circulated from time to time on uncertain authorities, and contradicted by  
letters or other direct information from the time they had left the Mandan  
towns, on their ascent up the river in April of the preceding year, 1805,  
until their actual return to St. Louis.”  
  
In the month of February, 1807, Messrs. Lewis and Clarke reached  
Washington city, congress being then in session. An act was soon passed  
granting to each of them and their companions the donation of lands which  
had been promised them and which they so richly deserved from their  
country, as a reward for their toils and dangers, and in recognition of the  
great service they had rendered the government. Captain Lewis was soon  
after appointed governor of Louisiana, with his coadjutor, Captain Clarke,  
as general of its militia. .  
  
Some time elapsed before Governor Lewis reached St. Louis. On his  
arrival there he found the territory almost in a state of anarchy, distracted  
by feuds and quarrels among the officers, and the people greatly discon-  
tented. Mr. Jefferson says: ‘“ He determined at once to take sides with  
neither party, but to use every endeavor to conciliate and harmonize them.  
The even-handed justice he administered to all soon established a respect  
for his person and authority, and perseverance and time wore down animos-  
ities and reunited the citizens again into one family.”  
  
Governor Lewis had been subject from early life to fits of despondenc

affairs rendering it necessary for him to visit Washington, he proceeded  
down the river to the third Chickasaw bluff, the present site of the city  
of Memphis, Tennessee, with a view of continuing his journey on to New  
Orleans, and thence by a coasting vessel. Mr. Neely, who was the agent  
of the United States with the Chickasaw Indians, having arrived at the  
bluff about this time, found the governor quite indisposed and showing  
evident occasional symptoms of derangement of mind. Rumors of a war  
with England were then prevalent, and, fearing the loss of his papers,  
among which were the vouchers of his accounts with the government and  
the journal of his western expedition, he changed his determination of pro-  
ceeding down the river and started westward&gt;through the Chickasaw

feat thus marked the first attempt at  
exploration of the far West.  
  
In 1792, Mr. Jefferson proposed to the  
American Philosophical Society that a  
subscription be circulated to engage some  
one to explore the region of the Missouri  
River and the Rockies, and learn the  
shortest water-route to the Pacific Ocean.  
At that time, Captain Meriwether Lewis  
was in the recruiting service, stationed at  
Charlottesville, and solicited President  
Jefferson’s aid in obtaining for him the  
direction of the party. Nor was his de-  
sire quenched when informed by Mr.  
Jefferson that whoever undertook the  
work should be attended by one com-  
panion only, in order that the Indians  
might not be alarmed. André Michaux,  
a professed botanist in the employ of the  
French government, proffered his services  
  
  
  
420  
  
  
  
and was accepted as a companion for  
Captain Lewis. He had proceeded as  
far as Kentucky, when he was recalled by  
the French minister, who was at that  
time in Philadelphia, and ordered to pro-  
ceed elsewhere upon his botanical inves-  
tigations. It is said that this recall was  
effected by Mr. Jefferson who, after the  
outset of the expedition, discovered indi-  
cations which led him to believe Michaux  
a French spy. And thus defeat marked  
the second attempt at exploration of the  
far West.

tion he had had abundant proof during the  
preceding two years, during which he had  
served as his private secretary.
