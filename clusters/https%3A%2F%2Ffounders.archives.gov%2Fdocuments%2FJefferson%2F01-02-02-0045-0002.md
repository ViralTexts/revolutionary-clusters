if it can, other points arise in the case which must

This question depends on the construction of that  
elause in the land law which requires that warrants  
shall be located so specially and precisely, as that  
others may be enabled, with certainty, to locate other  
warrants on the adjacent residuum.  
  
In the construction of an act so interesting to the  
people of Kentucky, it is of vital importance that  
principles be adhered to with care, and that as much  
uniformity as is practicable be observed in judicial  
decisions. This court has ever sought, with solicitude,  
for the true spirit of the law, as settled in the state  
tribunals, and has conformed. its judgments to the  
rules of those tribunals whenever it has been able  
to find them established.

identified by the description given of it in the instrument

separating the land from that which is not appropriated, the  
law directs a survey to be made by sworn officers, who, “ at
