Gentlemen  
Washington July 12. 1801  
  
I have recieved the remonstrance you were pleased to address to me, on the appointment of Samuel Bishop to the office of Collector of Newhaven, lately vacated by the death of David Austin; the right of our fellow citizens to represent to the public functionaries their opinion, on proceedings interesting to them, is unquestionably a constitutional right, often useful, sometimes necessary, and will always be respectfully acknoleged by me.  
Of the various Executive duties, no one excites more anxious concern than that of placing the interests of our fellow citizens in the hands of honest men, with understandings sufficient for their station. no duty, at the same time, is more difficult to fulfill. the knolege of characters possessed by a single individual is of necessity limited. to seek out the best through the whole Union, we must resort to other information, which, from the best of men, acting disinterestedly &amp; with the purest motives, is sometimes incorrect.  In the case of Samuel Bishop however, the subject of your remonstrance, time was taken, information was sought, and such obtained as could leave no room for doubt of his fitness. from private sources it was learnt that his understanding was sound, his integrity pure, his character unstained. and the offices confided to him within his own state are public evidences of the estimation in which he is held by the state in general, &amp; the city &amp; township particularly in which he lives. he is said to be the Town clerk, a justice of the peace, Mayor of the city of Newhaven, an office held at the will of the legislature, Chief judge of the court of Common pleas for Newhaven county, a court of high criminal &amp; civil jurisdiction, wherein most causes are decided without the right of appeal or review; and sole Judge of the court of Probats, wherein he singly decides all questions of wills, settlement of estates testate &amp; intestate, appoints guardians, settles their accounts, &amp; in fact has under his jurisdiction &amp; care all the property real &amp; personal of persons dying. the two last offices, in the annual gift of the legislature, were given to him in May last. is it possible that the man to whom the legislature of Connecticut has so recently committed trusts of such difficulty &amp; magnitude is ‘unfit to be the Collector of the district of Newhaven’, tho’ acknoleged, in the same writing, to have obtained all this confidence ‘by a long course of usefulness’? it is objected indeed in the remonstrance, that he is 77. years of age: but, at a much more advanced age, our Franklin was the ornament of human nature. he may not be able to perform in person all the details of his office: but if he gives us the benefit of his understanding, his integrity, his watchfulness, and takes care that all the details are well performed by himself, or his necessary assistants, all public purposes will be answered. the remonstrance indeed does not alledge that the office has been illy conducted, but only apprehends that it will be so. should this happen in event, be assured I will do in it what shall be just &amp; necessary for the public service. in the mean time he should be tried without being prejudged.  
The removal, as it is called, of mr Goodrich, forms another subject of complaint. declarations by myself in favor of political tolerance, exhortations to harmony and affection in social intercourse, and to respect for the equal rights of the minority, have, on certain occasions, been quoted &amp; misconstrued into assurances that the tenure of offices was to be undisturbed. but could candor apply such a construction? it is not indeed in the Remonstrance that we find it: but it leads to the explanations which that calls for.  When it is considered that, during the late administration, those who were not of a particular sect of politics were excluded from all office; when, by a steady pursuit of this measure, nearly the whole offices of the United States were monopolized by that sect; when the public sentiment at length declared itself, &amp; burst open the doors of honor &amp; confidence to those whose opinions they more approved; was it to be imagined that this monopoly of office was still to be continued in the hands of the minority? does it violate their equal rights to assert some rights in the Majority also? is it political intolerance to claim a proportionate share in the direction of the public affairs? can they not harmonize in society unless they have every thing in their own hands? if the will of the nation, manifested by their various elections, calls for an administration of government according with the opinions of those elected; if, for the fulfilment of that will, displacements are necessary, with whom can they so justly begin as with persons appointed in the last moments of an administration, not for it’s own aid, but to begin a career at the same time with their successors, by whom they had never been approved, and who could scarcely expect from them a cordial co-operation? Mr. Goodrich was one of these. was it proper for him to place himself in office, without knowing whether those, whose agent he was to be, would have confidence in his agency? can the preference of another, as the successor to mr Austin, be candidly called a removal of mr Goodrich? if a due participation of office is a matter of right, how are vacancies to be obtained? those by death are few. by resignation none. can any other mode then, but of removal, be proposed?  this is a painful office. but it is made my duty, and I meet it as such. I proceed in the operation with deliberation &amp; enquiry, that it may injure the best men least; and effect the purposes of justice &amp; public utility with the least private distress: that it may be thrown, as much as possible, on delinquency, on oppression, on intolerance, on antirevolutionary adherence to our enemies.  
The Remonstrance laments ‘that a change in the administration must produce a change in the subordinate officers:’ in other words, that it should be deemed necessary for all officers to think with their principal. but on whom does this imputation bear? on those who have excluded from office every shade of opinion which was not theirs? or on those who have been so excluded? I lament sincerely that unessential differences of opinion should ever have been deemed sufficient to interdict half the society from the rights &amp; the blessings of self-government; to proscribe them as unworthy of every trust. it would have been to me a circumstance of great relief had I found a moderate participation of office in the hands of the Majority. I would gladly have left to time &amp; accident to raise them to their just share. but their total exclusion calls for prompter correctives. I shall correct the procedure; but, that done, return with joy to that state of things when the only questions concerning a candidate shall be, is he honest? is he capable? is he faithful to the constitution? I tender you the homage of my high respect.

Washington, July 12, 1801. &#x27;a  
Gentlemen,   
1 HAVE received tire remonftrance you t|,  
were pleafed to add re fs to me, on the ap C(  
pointment of Samuel Bifhop, to the office Cr  
of Collector of New-Havcn, I&lt;!tclyvv-t],  
cated by the death of David Aufliit. The }j,  
right of our fellow-citizens to reprefent to t[,  
the public functionaries their opinion, on \Vr  
proceedings interefting to them, is unquel- p.  
tionably a Conftitutional right, often ufcful&#x27;,  
fome times fieceflary, and will afways be rei- V]  
peCtfully by me. ()f  
Of the various Executive duties, no one tj(  
exeites more anxious concern than that of f„  
placing the interelt of our fellow-citizens in n)  
the hands of honeft mVn, with underltand- js  
ing fufficient for their (lation. No duty at ar  
the fame time, is more difficult to fulfil.—&#x27;  
The knowledge of characters poiTefltil by a t;,  
fingle individual is of neceffity limited. To c(]  
ifeek out the beft through the whole union, ut  
we muft refort to other information, which, ;t  
&#x27;from the bed of men, acting d i finte relied ly cj(J  
and with the purelt motives, is fometimea ot;  
incorrect. In the cafe of Samuel Bifuop, m  
however, the fubject of your reinonftrance,  
time was taken, information was fought, c|:  
and fuch obtained as could leave no room a  
for doubt of his fitnefs. Erotn private four- ot  
ces it was learnt that his underftanding was ce  
found, his integrity pure, his charaCtcr un- j)r  
Itained. And the offices confided to him t;(  
within bis own ftate, are public evidences pr  
of the efbmation in which he is held by the w  
ftate in general, and the city and townfhip  
particularly in which he lives. Pie is faid&#x27;u,  
to be the rown-Clerk, a Juftice of thejju  
Peace, Mayor of the city of New-Haven, ft.  
ui oifir.e held at the will of the legiflature ;  
Chief Judge of the Court of Connnpn Pleas  
for New-Hiven county, a court of high j,.  
criminal and civil jurifdiCtion, wherein molt re  
caufes are decided without the right ofaa-t;  
peal or review ; and fole Judge of the Court j  
of Probates, wherein he fmgly decides all ,j,  
queftions of wills, fcttlement of eftates, te.l- t|  
tate and inteltate ; appoints guardians rt  
fettles their accounts, and in faCt liaS under |r  
his jtyifdiCtion and care all the property ,y  
r *al and perl&#x27;onal&#x27;of perfons dying. The two ;r  
laft offices, in the annual gift of the legif   
lature, were given to him in May laft. ;  
Is it poffible that the man to whom th&#x27;  
legiflature of Connecticut has fo recently  
committed trufls of fuch difficulty and mag­  
nitude, is &quot; unfit to be the collector of th  
diftriCt of New-Haven,&quot; tho&#x27; acknowledged  
in the fame writing to have obtained all this  
confidence &quot; by a long courfe of ufeful  
&gt;&lt;&amp; It is objected indeed, in the re  
n nftrance, that he is 77 years of age ,  
out at a much more advanced age, otu   
FrapkUn waa the ornament of human na- ,  
  
turc. lie may not be able to perform in  
perfon all the details ot* his oflice ; hut if  
lie gives us the benefit of* his underflanding,  
his integrity, his watcbfulnefs, and take.,  
care that all the details are well performed  
by himfelf ,or his neceflary afultants, a!i  
;jublic purpofes will be anfwered. The re­  
monftrance indeed does not alledge that tin  
office has been illy conduit eel, but only ap­  
prehends that it will be fo. Should thi­  
happen in event, be allured I will do in it  
what fhall be jufl and neceflary for the pub  
lie fcrvice. In the mean time he fliould be  
tried without being pre-judged.  
The removal, as &#x27;it is called,&#x27; of Mr.  
Goodrich, fofnrs another lubjetb of coon­  
plaint—Declarations by myfelf in favor of  
political tol ranee, exhortations to har­  
mony and afleftion in i&#x27;ocial intercourse,  
and to relpeit the tgual rights of the­  
minority, have, on certain occ&lt;Hions, been  
quoted and mifcoiifti&#x27;ued into affurances  
that the tenure of offices was to be undii­  
turhed.—But coulu candor apply fucn a con­  
ftruclion ? It is not indeed in the rernon­  
i trance tint we find it : but it leads ta  
the expl uiationS which that calls for.  
When it js confidered that curing the lati  
adrniniftration, thole who were not ot a  
D irtimlar fedt of politics -were excluded  
from all oflice ; when by a ffeady purfuit of  
&#x27;his meafure, nearly the whole offices o*i  
,the United States were,monopolized by that  
ifeft; when the public fentimeat at hngt: &#x27;  
[declared i t lei f, and burit open tiic doors oi  
honor and confidence to thole whole opini  
oris they more approved j wa it to beima  
gined that thi-. monopoly of oflice was flil!  
to be continued in the hands of the minori­  
ty ? Does it violate their equal rights, t­  
nffert forne rights in the majority alio? 1 |  
it political intolerance to claim a propor­  
tionate (lure in the direction of the publii  
affairs ? Can they not harmonize in fociety  
unlefs they have everything n their owi  
hands ? It the .will of the nation, manifell  
ed by their various elections, calls for an  
adminiftration of government accordin;  
with the opinions of thofe etc died ; if, for  
the fulfilment of that will, di placement:  
are nect ffai y, with whom can they fo jultly  
begin as with perfons, appoint&#x27;d in tin.  
laft monicn s of an adiuini&#x27;flrition, not To  
its own- aid, but to begin a career at th,  
fame time with their Jucceffors, by whom­  
they had never been approved, and win  
could fcarcely expeift from them a&#x27;cordial  
co-operation ? Mr. Goodrich was one of  
thefe. Was it proper for him to plate 1  
hiinfelf in office, without ki owing whe- &#x27;  
ther thofe whofe agent he was to be, could  
have confidence in his agency? Can the  
preference of another, as the fuccelfor of  
Mr. A lift in, be candidly Called a removal of  
Mr. Goodrich? If a due participation of  
office is a matter of right, how are vacan­  
cies to be obtained i Thofe by death are­  
few, by resignation none. Can any other  
mode than &#x27;removal, be propoi&#x27;ed ? This  
is a painful office ; but it is made iny duty, &#x27;  
and I meet it as fiich. I proceed in the  
operation with deliberation and enquiry,  
that it may injure the bed men leaft ; and &#x27;  
eff&quot; (St the purpof&#x27;S of juftice and public  
utility with the lealt private diftrefs : that  
it may be thrown as much as poffible on  
delinquency, on oppreffion, on intolerance,  
on anti-revolutionary adherence to our ene-(  
mies. 1  
The Remonftrance laments &#x27; that a  
change in the adminiftration muff produce 1  
a chahge in the fubordinate officers&#x27; : n  
other words, that it fhould be deemed ne- &#x27;  
celTary for all officers to think with their 1  
principal. Bu on whom does this imputa­  
tion bear ? On thofe who have excluded &#x27;  
from office every fhade of opinion which 1  
was not theirs ? Or on thofe who have &#x27;  
fo excluded ? I lament lincerely that &#x27;  
unelfential differences in opinion fhould &#x27;  
jhave been deemed fufficient to inieididt &#x27;  
(half the fociety from the right and the  
jblefiings of felf-government; to profcribe  
them as unworthy of every trull. It would  
have been to me a circumftance of great  
relief had I found a moderate participa­  
tion of office in the hands of the majority ;  
I would gladly have left to time and acci­  
dent to raife them to their juft (hare. But  
their total exclufion calls for prompter cor­  
rectives. I fhall Co re A the procedure ;  
but that done, return with joy to that (late

WASHINGTON, JULY 12, i8ci.  
I Gentlemen,  
I HAVE received the Remonrtrance you  
| were pleafeJ to addrefs to me, on the appoint  
ntert of Samuel Biffiop, to the office of Collec  
tor of New-Haven, lately vacated by the death  
of David Auftin. The right of our feliow citi  
xens to deprefent to the public fundltonaries  
the r opinion, on proceedings interefting to  
them, is ur.qutftiooab’y a Conftituttonal right,  
olten lifcftii, iornetimes necefT.iry, and will al­  
j ways be refpcdfully acknowlegdei by me.  
Of the various Executive duties, no one  
excite* more anxious concern than that rfpHc­  
&#x27; ing he infereft of cur fellcw citizens in the  
h nds « f honelt men, with underfiamiinp fur­  
; ficient for their ft ttion. No duty at the fjrne  
■ time, is more difficult to fu&#x27;fil. The knnw!­  
tdeeot ihtracTrs poffirted by a fiogle indivi  
, du.d isr-t recertify limited. To fe k out the  
• heft thrrugh the whole Union, we muft re  
text to other information, which fr rn the beft

ifi iuuiitu, i5 juu cv incoirccr. m the  
ca ife of Samuel Biliiop, however, the fuhj d ot  
ycur remonftrance, time wa% taken, informa­  
tion was fought, and fucli obtained as could  
leave no room for doubt of his fitnef. From  
private foutces it was learnt that his unJerllan  
I ding wa-, found, hi&gt; integrity pure, his charac  
ter unftained. Aad ihe offices confided to  
! h&#x27;rn within h:s own date are public evidences  
of the eftimation in which he is h-ld by the  
i ft *te iu general, and the city and townfhip par­  
ticularly in which he lives. He is faid to be  
i the Town Cle k. a Juhice of the Peace, Mayor  
cf die city of New H iven, an office held at  
the wih ol tlie Legillatui e ; C h*cl fu Ige of  
the Court of Common Pitas for New Haven  
county, a ccurc of Ivght ci. ninal and civil jit  
riUlidion, wherein molt canfes are d- cidcd with­  
out the right of appeal or review ; and foie ;  
Judge of Court of Probates wherein he fingly  
decides ail queftions of wills, icttlen.ent of]  
eilaies, teftatc and inteftate: apponj/s guir  
dians, fettles their accounts, and in f id has un  
der his jt.r fdidton and ca&#x27;e all the property  
real ar.d perf nal nf perl ms dying. The two  
laft offices, in the annual gift of the lcgtilature,  
were given to him in May lift.  
Is it pcffiblc that the man to whom the Le  
gifla ure of Conneidicut has fo recently com­  
milted trulls of l&#x27;uch difficulty ;-nd magnitude,  
is “ unfit to be the Colled* r of the diftrid of  
Newhaven,” though acknowledged in the fame  
writing, to have obtained all this confidence «• by  
a long coorfe of ufefulncfs ?”—It is objeded  
indeed, in the remonftrance hat he is 77 years  
of age : hut at a mu h mo.c advanced age,our  
Franklin was the ornament of human nature.  
He may not be able to perform in perfon all  
the details of his office ; but if he gives us the  
berfiet of his under Handing, his integrity, his  
watchfulnefs, and takes care that all the defa Is  
are well performed by himfelf or his neccfliry  
affiHants, all public pnrpofes will be anfweted.  
The remonftrance indeed does not allcdge  
that the office bcu been iliy corduded, hut only ]  
apprehends that it wll be fo. Should this hap. j  
pen in event, be allured I will do in it what  
j fiiali be juft and necclfary for the public fer­  
vice. In the mean time he ihouhi be tryed  
_1_1  
  
The removal, as it is railed, of Mr. Good­  
rich, forms another filled of complaint. De­  
clarations by myfelf in f.ivorof political tolerance,  
exhortations to harmony and affedion in facial  
intercom f?, and to relped for the equal rights of  
the minority, hare, on certain occ.tfmns, been  
quoted an J mifconflrued into afturances that the  
tenure of offices was to be undifturbed. Bu:  
could candor apply fuch a conftrudion ? It is  
not indeed in the Remonftrarce that we find  
it; bur it leads to the explanations which that  
cal’s lor. When it is confidered that during  
the late adm&#x27;.niftration, thofe who were not of  
a part cu&#x27;nr fed of politics were excluded from  
all office ; when by a fteady purfu t of this  
meafuie, nearly the whole offices of the United  
S’ates were monapoli/cd by that fed ; when  
the public fentinient at length declared itfelf  
and burft open the doors ot honor and confi­

ved ; was it to be imagined that this monopo­  
ly of office was ftill to be conti- ued in the hands  
of the mino&#x27;ity ? Does it violate their equal \
right, to aftert fome right in the majority all&#x27;o ? ;  
Is it political intolerance to claim a proportion  
ate lha*e in tbs diredion of the public affairs ? 1  
Can they not barmen:*! in fociety un&#x27;ef- they &#x27;

own {tate are public evidemcies of the  
l eftimationin which héis held by the  
Mtate in general, and -the city and  
| townthip particularly in which he lives.  
He is fzid to be the Town Clerk; a  
Juflice of the Peace, Mayor of the Ci­  
ty of New-Haven, an office held at  
the will of the Legislature ; Chief  
Judge of the Court of Common Pleas  
for New-Haven county, a court of=  
- high criminal and civil jurifdiion,  
“wherein most Taufes are decided with.  
out the right of appeal or review :  
and sole Judge of court of Probates,  
wherein he singly decides all queltions  
of wills, settlement of estates, testate  
- and intestate ; appoints guardians, set.  
tles their accounts, and in fa&amp; has un­  
~der his jurifdi®tion and care, all the  
property real and personal of persons  
dying. The two lait offices, in the  
annual gift of the legislature, were  
given to him in May last.  
Is it possible that the man to whom  
the legislature of Conne&amp;icut has o  
recently committed trusts of such diffi­  
culty and magnitude, is “unfit to he  
the colledtor of the diftri® of New-  
Haven,” tho’ acknowledged in the  
fame writing, to have obtainedall this  
confidence ¢ by a long course of uf:-  
fulnefs”—llt is objected indeed, in the  
remonstrance that our Franklin was  
the ornament of human nature. He  
may not be able to perform in person  
all the details of his office, but if he  
gives us the benefit of his underfiand.-  
ing, his integrity, his watchfulnefs, and  
takes care that all the details are well  
performed by himfelf or his néceflary  
afliftants, all public purposes will be  
answered. The remonfirance indeed  
does not alledge that the office 4as seen  
illy conduéted, but only apprehends  
that it wi// te so. Should this happen  
in event, be assured Iwill do in it what  
{hall be just and necessary for the pub­  
lic service. Inthe mean time he should  
be tried without being prejudged.  
The removal, as it is called, of My  
Goodrich, forms another fubje&amp;@ of  
complaint. Declarations by myfit  
in favor of political telerance, exhorta­  
tions to harmony and affe&amp;ion in social  
intercourse, and of refped for the equal  
righti of the minority, have, on certain  
occasions, been quoted and mifcons  
ftruéted into assurances that the tenure  
of offices was to be undisturbed. But  
could candor apply such a confiruc­  
tien ? It is not indeed in the remon­  
strance that we findit: but it leads to  
the explanations which that calls for.  
When it is considered that during the  
late administration, those who were.  
not of a particular fe&amp; of politics were  
excluded from all office ; when by a  
steady pursuit of this measure, nearly  
the whole offices of the United States  
were monopolized by that fe®t—when  
the public sentiment at length declar­  
ed itfelf, and burst open the doors of  
honor and confidence to those whose  
opinions they more approved—was it  
to be imagined that this monopoly of  
office was fill to be continued in the  
hands of the minority ? Does it vio­  
late their equal right:, to assert some  
rights in the majority also ? Is it pos­  
tical intolerance to claim a proportions .  
ate share in the dire®ion of the public  
affuirs ? Can they not barmonize in fo­  
cicty unless they have every thing in  
their own hands ? if the will of the na­  
tion, manifefted by their various elec­  
tions, calls for an admisiftration of  
government accordiag with the opin-,  
ions of those eleéted ; if, for the fulfil­  
ment of that will, displacements are  
necgflary, with whom can they {0 just­  
ly begin as with persons appointed in  
the last moments of an administration,  
not for its own aid, but to begin a ca­  
reer aﬁ%@he_’faxne time with their fuc­  
ceflors, by whom they had nevet beeh’  
approved, and who could scarcely ex­  
peétfrom them a cordial co-operagion?  
Mr. Goodrich was one oﬂg;fewﬂ |

Washington, July 12, 180 1.  
Gentlemen,  
I have received the remonftrance you  
were pleafed to addrefs to me, on the ap-  
pointment of Samuel Bifhop, to the office  
of Collector of New-Haven, lately vaca-  
ted by the death of David Auftin. The  
right of our fellow citizens to reprefeoed  
to the public functionaries their opinio^  
on proceedings interefting to them, is uiv^  
queftionably a conftitutional right, 4R°enq  
ufeful, fotnetimes necefTary, and will al-  
ways be refpectfully acknowledged by  
me.  
  
Of the various executive duties, no one  
excites a more anxious concern than that  
of placing the intereft of our fellow citi-  
zens in the hands of honeft men, wjtdi uii;.  
derflanding fufficient for their fl*Jti#n.  
No duty at the fame time, is more difficult  
to fulfill. The knowlege of characters  
polTefledby a fingle individual is of neceff-  
ity limited, To feck out. the beft through  
the whole Union, we muft refort toother  
informition, which, from the beft of men  
acting difintereltedly and with the pureft  
motives, is fometimes incorrect. In the  
cafe of Samuel Bifhop, however, the fub-  
ject of your remonftrance, time was taken  
information was fought and fuch obtain-  
ed as could lea ve no room for doubt of his  
fitnefs. From private fojjrces it was learnt  
that his underftanding was found, his in-  
tegrity pure, his character unftained. And  
the offices confided to him within his own  
(tate are public evidences of the eftimati-  
on in which he is held by the ftate in ge-  
neral, and the city and townfliip particu-  
larly in which he lives. He is faid to be  
the Town-Clerk, a Juftice of the Peace,  
Mayor of New-Haven, an office held at  
the will of the Legiflatue ; Chief Judge  
of the Court of Common Pleas for New-  
Haven county, a court of high criminal  
and civil jurifdiction, where moft caufes  
are decided without the right of appeal  
or review ; and fole Judge of Court of Pro-  
bates, wherein he fingly decides all quef-  
tions of wills, fettlement of eftates, tef-  
tate and inteftate ; appoints Guardians,  
fettles their accounts and in fact has un-  
der his jurifdiction and care all the pro-  
perty real and perfonal of perfons dying.  
The two laft offices, in the annual gift of  
the Ltgiflature, were given to him in  
May laft.  
  
Is it poflible that the man to whom the  
Legiflature of Connecticut has fo recently  
committed trufts of fuch difficulty &amp; mag-  
nitude, is &quot; unfit to be the collector of the  
diftrict of New-Haven&quot; tho&#x27; acknowledg-  
ed in the fame writing tohave obtained all  
this confidence &quot; by a long courfe of ule-  
fulnefs&quot;? It is objected indeed in the re-  
monftrance that he is 77 years of age: bu

conftruction ? It is not indeed in the Re-  
monftrance that we find it : but it leads  
to the explanations which that calls for.  
Whe&lt;a it is conlidered that during the late  
adminiftration, thofe who were not of a  
particular feet of politics were excluded  
from all office ; when by a fteady purfuit  
of this meafure, nearly the whole offices  
of the United States were monopolized by  
that feet ; when the public fentiment at  
length declared itl&#x27;elf and burft open trfa  
doors of honor and confidence to thqflr  
whofe opinions they more approved ; was  
it to be. imagined that this monopoly of  
office was flill to be continued in the  
hands of the minority ? Does it violate  
their equal rights, to affert fome rights in  
the majority alio ? Is it political intole-  
rance to claim a proportionate fhare in  
the dire ction of public aiTairs ? Can they  
not barmonize in fociety unlefs they have  
every thing in their own hands? If the  
will of the nation, manifefted by their va-  
rious elections, calls for an adminiftration  
of government according with the opini-  
ons of thofe elected ; if, for the fulfilment  
of that will, difplacnsents are necefTary,  
with whom can they fo juftly begin as  
with perfons appointed in the laft mo-  
ments of an adminiftration, not for its  
own aid, but to begin a career at the fame  
time with their fucceflor, by whom they  
had never been approved, and who could  
fcarcely expect from them a cordial co-o-  
peration ?  
  
Mr. Goodrich was one of thefe. — Was  
it proper for him to place himfelf in office  
without knowing whether thofe whofe a-  
gent he was to be, could have confidence  
in his agency ? Can the preference of an-  
other as the fucceflor of Mr. Auftin, be  
candidly called a removal of Mr. Good-  
rich ? If a due participation of office is  
a matter of right, how are vacancies to  
be obtained ?— ^Thofe by death are few  
by refignation none. Can any other mode  
then but removal be propofedi This is a  
I painful office ; But it is maibny duty,  
and I meet it as fuch. I proceed in the  
operation with deliberation and enquiry,  
that it may injure the beft men leaft, and  
effect the purpofes of juftice and public  
utility with the leaft private diftrefs ; that  
it may be thrown as much as poflible on  
delir.quincy, on oppreflion.on intolerance,  
on anti-revolutionary adherence to our  
enemies.  
  
The Remonftrance laments &quot; that a  
change in the adminiftration muft pro  
duce a change in the fubordinate officers :&quot;  
in other words, that it fhould be deemed  
necefTary for all officers to think with their  
principal. But on whom does this im-  
putation bear ? on thofe who have exclu-  
ded from wffice every fliade of opinion  
which was not theirs ? or on thofe who  
have been fo excluded? I lament fin-  
cerely that uneffential differences in opi-  
nion fhould have been deemed fufficient  
to interdict half the fociety from the right  
and the bleffwgs of felf-government : to  
profcribe them as unworthy of every truft.  
It would have been to me a circumftance  
of great relief had I found a moderate  
participation of office in the hands of the  
majority ; I would gladly have left to  
time and accident to raife them to their  
juft fhare. But their total exclufion calls  
for prompter correctives. I fhall correct  
the procedure ; but that done, return  
with joy to that ftate of things when the  
only queftions concerning a candidate  
fhall be, is he honeft ? is he capable ? is  
he faithful to the conftitution ?  
  
I tender you the homage of my  
high refpect,

Wafhington, Fuly 12, 180t.  
GENTLEMEN—  
  
I pave received the remon-  
ftrance you. were pleased to ad.  
drefsto me on the appointment of  
Samuel bifhop to the office ofCol-  
leGtor of New-Haven, lately va-

tin. The right of our fetlow-citi-  
zeus to reprefent to the public  
functionaries their opinion, on

right, olten ufeful, fometimes ne-  
ceflary, and will always be refpect-  
fully acknowle -dged by me.  
  
Of the various Executive du-  
ties, no One excites more anxlous  
concern than that of placing the  
interelts of our fellow-citizens in  
the hands of honeft men, with un-  
derflanding {ufficient for their fta-  
tion. Noduty at the fame time is  
more difficult to fulfil. The  
knowledge of characters pofltffed  
by a fingle individual is of necetlity  
limited. To feek out the beft  
through the whole Union, we mu  
refort to other infortnation, which,  
from the beft of men, acting dif-  
intereftediy and with the purcft  
motives, is fometimes incorreét.  
In the cafe of Samuel Bifhop,  
however, the fubjeét of your re-  
monitrance, time waz taken, in-

Integrity pure, his character un-

imagined that this monopoly of of-  
fice was ftil! to be continued in the  
hands of the minority? Does it  
violate their equal rights, to affert  
fome rights in the majority alfo?  
Is it political intolerance to claim a  
proportionate fhare in the direéti-

not harmonize in fociety unlefs they

Thofe by death are few, by refig-

Thisis a painful office: But this is

The Remonftrance laments ‘ that

it would be deemed neceflary for  
all officers to think with their pria-

Bl - wAsHINGTON} JuLY 12, 1801. -  
Gentlemen.—l] have recieved tlie remonstrance  
you were pleased to address to me, on the ap­  
pointment of Samuel Bislhop, to.the oflice of Col­  
lector of New-Haven, lately vacated by the death  
e .  
  
of David Austin. The right of our fellow-citi­  
z°ns to represent to the public functionaries their  
opinion, on proczedings interesting to themn, is |  
unquestionably a Constitutional right, often use­  
ful, sometimes necessary, and will always be  
resgectfu]ly acknowledged by me. |  
fthe various Executive duties, no one excites  
more anxious concern than that of placing the in­  
terest of our follow-citizens,in the hands of hon­  
est men, with understandine sufficient for their  
siation. No duty at the same time, is™more difji­  
calt to fulfil. The knowledge of characters pos­  
sessed by a single individual is of necessity limit­  
ed. To seek ont the Dbest through the whole  
Union, we must resort to other information, which  
from the best of men, acting disimicrestingly and  
with the purest matives. is sometimes incorrect.—  
In the case of Sanuel Bishop, however, the sub­  
jeet of your remonstrance, tinewas taken, inform­  
ation was seucht, and such obtained as could  
leave no room for doubt of his fiitness. From pri­  
vate sources it was learat, that his understanding  
was sduad, his integrity pure, his character uu­  
staired. And the oilices confided to him within  
his own state are public evidences of the estima­  
tion in which he is held by the State in general  
and the city and township, particularly in which,  
ke lives. He issaid to be the Town Clerk,a Jus­  
tice of the Peace, Mayorof tie city of New-Haven,  
an oflice held at the will of the Legislature ; Chief  
“Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for New-  
Haven county, a court of high criminal and ecivil  
jarisdiction, wherein mo&amp;t causcs are dicided  
without the right” of appeal or review; and sole  
Judge of Court of Probates, wherein he singly  
decides all questions of wills, scttlement of es­  
tates, testaie and intestate; appoints guardians,  
settles their accounts, and in fact has under his  
jurisdictien and carc all the nroperty, real and  
personal of persons dying. Tle two last offices,  
(in the annusil gift of the Legislature, were given  
to hvin.in May last..  
  
N e L N S . S eT Y  
Is it possible that the man to whom the Legis­  
lature of Connecticut has so recentiy committed  
trusts of snch diﬂicult{ and magnitude, is ‘““unfit  
to be the Collsetor of the district of New-Haven,”  
though acknowledged in-the same writiny, to  
have obtained all this confidence, “by a long  
course of usefulness?” 1t is objected indeed, in  
the remonstrance, that he is 77 years of age ;  
but, at 2 much more advanced age, our Franklin  
- was the omament of human naware. He may  
| ot be ablo to perform in’ persoiy®all the dotails  
| of his office ; butif he gives us the benefit of his  
‘ understanding,” his integrity, his watchfulness,  
| and takes care that all the details ars” woll per­  
\ formed by himself or his necessary assistants,  
| al: the public purposes will be answered. The  
remonstrance indeed does not allege that the of­  
fice hus been illy conducted, but only appre­  
hends that it 2ii/ be so. Should this happen, in  
event, be assured I will do i it what shall be just  
and necessary for the public service. In the  
mean time &#x27;he should be tried without being pre­  
judged. e = ;  
The removal as it is called, of Mr. Goodrich,  
forms another subject of complaint. Declara­  
tions by myself in favor of political tolerance, ex­  
hortations to harmony and aftection in social in­  
tercourse, and to respcet for the equal rights of  
the minority, have on certain occasions, been  
quoted and mizconstrued into assurances that the  
tenare of offices was to be undisturbed. But  
couldcandor apply such a construction? Tt ix  
ot indeed in the remonstrance that we find it 2  
but it leads*to the explanations which that calls  
for. When itis considered, that during the late  
administration, thosc who were not of a particular  
sect of polities were exluded from all officc ; and  
when by&#x27;a steady pursuit of this mcasuie, neaily  
the whole offices in the United States were monopoliz­  
ed by that sect ; when the public sentiment at length  
declared itself and burst cpen Yhe doors of honor  
ord confidence to thuse whose opinions they more  
approved ; WAS I&#x27;T TO BEIMAGINED THAT  
THIS&quot;MONCPOLY OF OFFICE WASSTILL  
TO BE CONTINUED IX THE HANDS OF  
THE MINORITY? Dors 17T’ VIOLATE -THEIR  
EQUAL RIGHTS, Tu ASSERT SOME RIGHTS IN THE  
MAJORITY ALSO? Is&#x27;iT POLITICAL INTCLERANCE  
+TO CLAIM &amp; PRCPORTIONATE SHAEE IN THE DI­  
RECTION OF THE PUPLIC A¥FAIRs? CAN THEY  
NOT HARMONIZE IN SOCIETY UNLESS THEY HAVE  
EVERY THING IN THEIR CJvN HANDs? If the will  
of the nation, mnnifesteﬁ)by their various clec­  
tions, calls for an adininistration of government  
accordicg with the opinions of those elected ; if,  
for the fulfillnent of that will, displacements  
arc necessary, with whom can they so justly be­  
gin as with persons appointed in the last mo­  
- ments of an edministration, not for its own aid,  
[ but to begin a career at the same time with their  
- successors, by whom they had never been ap­  
| p.rovegi,and&quot;w&#x27;ho who could ecarcely expect from  
  
them a cordial co-operation ? S :  
~ Mr. Gooarich was one of these. Was it pro­  
- per for him to place himself in office, without  
- knowing whether those whose agent he was to be,  
~could have confidence in his agency ? Can the  
- preference of another, as the succesor of Mr. Aus­  
- tin, be candidly called a removal of Mr. Good­  
rich? IF A DUE PARTICIPATION OF OFFICE IS A  
MATTER OF RIGHT, HOW ARE VACANCIES TO BE  
OBTAINED? . THOSE BY DEATH ARE F&amp;W, BY  
L RESIGNATION KoNE? Can any other mede than  
- removal be proposed ? This ‘is a painful offce;  
but it ismade my dnty,and [ meetitassuch.—  
1 preceed in the operation with deliberation and  
inquiry, that it may injure the best men least;  
-and eflect the purpeses of jusiice and public  
utility with the least private distress; that it  
may be thrown as much as possible on delinquen­  
l cy,on oppression,on intolerance cnanti-revolution  
- ary adherence to our eneuiies. :  
The remonstrance lameats that a change in  
the administration must produce a change in  
the suhordinaie officers; in other words, that it  
should be ‘dcemed necessary for all officers to  
think with their principal.” But on whom does  
. this imputaticn bear? On those who have ex­  
- cludedgfrom office cvery shade of opinion which  
-was not theirs 7 Or on those who Eave been so  
~excluded ? T lament sincerely that unessential  
differénces in opinion should have been deemed  
~suflicient tointerdict half the society from the right  
and the blessings of government; to proscribe  
them as unworthy of every trust.  
It would have been to me a circumstance of  
great relief had T found a moderate participation  
of office in the hands of the majority; I would  
gladly have left to time and accident to raise  
them to their just. share. But their total exclu­  
sion calls for prompter correctives. I shall cor­  
rect the proceedure; but that done, return with  
joy to that statc of things when the only qumes­  
tions concerning a candidate shali be, is he hon­  
est? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the Con­  
stitution ? : L  
I tender you the homage of my high respect.

Washington, July 12, 1801.  
Gentlemen:&#x27; ..&#x27; &#x27; &#x27;. &#x27; &#x27;  
I have received the remonstrance you  
were pleased to address, to me on the- ap­  
pointment of Samuel Bishop, to the office  
of Collector of New, Haven, lately vacated  
by the death of David Austin. The right  
of our fellow-citizens to represent to the  
public functionaries their opinion, n pro­  
ceedings interesting to them is unquestiona  
bly a Constitutional . right, often useful,  
sometimes necessary, and will always be  
respectfully acknowledged by me. ; i  
Of the various Executive duties, . no one  
excites more anxious concern than that of  
placing-the interests ol our fellow citizens,  
in the wands of honest men, with under­  
standing sufficient for their station. JXodu  
- ty.at the same time, is more difficult to lulfil  
The knowledge of chhiacters possessed bv  
a single individual Is of necessity limited.  
io seek pat, the. best through the whole  
Union, we musr.rsort to&#x27;other information  
which, from the best of men, acting disin  
terestitigly and with the purest motives, is  
sometimes incorrect. In the case of Samue  
Bishop, however, the subject of your.re-  
monstiance, time was taken, information  
was sought, and . Such obtained as could  
leave no room for doubt of his fitness Fion  
private sources it was learnt Ahtt hi under  
Standing was sound, his integrity pure, his  
Character unstained. And the offices con  
. tided to him within his own sf-ste are public  
evidences of the estimation in which he is  
held byjhe state in general and the citv  
and township, particularly in which, he  
lives. He is said to be the Town Cltik, h  
..Justice of tbe Peace, Mayor uf the City of  
XSef Haven, an office held at tbe wilt of the  
legislature; iuiei juage o: me vouri o  
Common Pleas for New Haven ceunty, a  
court of high criminal and civil jui isdicticn,  
wherein otost causes are decided without  
the right of appeal or review ; and sole  
Judge of Court of Probates, wherein he  
singly decides all questions of wills, seltle  
nients of estates, testate and intestate; ap  
  
points guardians, settles their accounts, ana  
in fact has under his jurisdiction and care  
all the property, real and personal of per-  
- sons dying..: The two last offices, in the  
, annual gift of the -Legislature, were givei.  
to him invMay last; .-  
Is it possible that the man to whom the  
Legislature of Connecticut has sd recenth  
committed trusts of such difficulty .-and  
magnitude, is &quot; unfit to be Collector of the  
district of New Haven,&quot; though acknow­  
ledged in the same writing, to have obtain  
ed all this confidence,&quot; by a long course oi  
usefulness ?&quot; It is objected, indeed, in tin  
remonstrance that he is 77 years of age  
but,; at , a much more advanced age, oui  
Franklin was &#x27;the .ornament of human na­  
turev cHemay not be&#x27; ble67pVfo.ra&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; in  
person al! the details of bis office j brat if he  
gives us the benefit of his understanding, his  
integrity, his ; watchfulness, and takes care  
that all ,the details are well performed by  
; himself or his neceesary assistants, all pub­  
lic purposes will be answered The remon­  
strance indeed does hot allegelhat the offici  
ha been illy conducted, but , only apprr-  
&#x27; hends that it wWe b -Should this happen  
m event, be, assured T will do&#x27; in it whai  
shall be just and hicessary for the public­  
&quot; ervice In;t he mf an: time 1 should U  
t tried without being&#x27; ptejudged. V :

licb, foms toother, subject of complaint.

Action jn social intercourse and 4oVespec?  
  
vu wjiaiu MWttsignj, oeen quoiea and mis-  
construed. fela assurances that the tenure vi  
  
  
offices was to be undisturbed. But couId  
  
candor apply such: a construction r lt is not  
indeed in the remonstrance that we find it;  
built leads to&quot; the explanations which that  
clls for. Wheri it is considered that ounng  
the late administration, those toho were no  
of a partindarsect of politicsjvere exclud  
d from till office ; &#x27; and when by a steady  
nursuit of this measure, nearly the whole  
I oMcei of the&#x27; United States were monopoliz  
t &#x27; T . . . I A.  
ed hn thai sect : when the puonc sziunuriw  
at Ungth&#x27;deciared itself and burst open the  
doors of honor and confidence to those  
whose opinions they more approved ; was it  
TO BE IMAGINED THAT THIS MONOPOLY OF  
OFFICE WAS STILL TO BE CONTINUED  
IN  
THE HANDS OF -THE wiauww &quot;  
m -vr I I O It  
violate their equal rights, to assert some  
richts in the majority also ? Is it political  
nthlerance to claim a proportionate share  
in Ithe direction of the public affairs ? Can  
they not haimonize in society unless they  
hive every thing in their own hands ? If  
(he will of the nation, manifested by thtir  
various elections, calls for an administration  
of government&#x27; according with the opinion,  
of those elected ; if, for. the fulfilment of  
that will displacements are necessary, with  
whom can they so justly bgin as with per­  
sons appointed in vthe last moments of an  
administration, not for its own aid, but to  
begin a career at the same time with their  
siir.ressnrs. ht whom thev had never been  
-j .-  
approved, and who cou&#x27;d scarcely expect  
from them a cordial co-operation.  
Mr. Goodrich was one of these. Was it  
proper fo!r him to place himself in cnite,  
without knowing whether those whose agent  
he was to be, could have confidence in his  
agency? Can the preference, of another,  
as the successor of Mr. Austin, be candidly  
called a removal of Mr. Goodrich ? If n  
participjilion of office is a matter of right,  
how are vacancies to be obtained ? Those  
by death are few, by resignation none. Cnn  
any other mode than removal be &#x27;proposed?  
This is a painful office ; but it is made my  
duty, and I meet it as such. I proceed in  
the operation with deliberation and inquiry,  
that it may injure the bst men least ; and  
effect the purposes of justice and public  
utility with the least private distress : that it  
may be thrown as much as possible on de  
linquency,on oppression, on intolerance,on  
anti-revoiutionary adherence to ourenemie.  
The remonstrance laments that a change  
in the administration must produce a change  
in the subordinate officers ; in other words,  
that it should be deemed necessary fur ali  
officers to think with their principal. Bu  
on whom does this imDUtation bear ? On  
those who have excluded from office every  
shade of opinion which Was not theirs? O  
on those who have been so excluded?  
lament sincerely that unessential differences  
in opinion should have been deemed suffi  
cient to interdict half the society from the  
right and the ; blessings of government ; t  
proscribe them as unworthy of every trust  
It wouldhave been to me a circumstance o  
great relief had I found a moderate partici  
pat ion of office in the hands of the. majority;  
I would gladly have left to lime and acci  
dent to raise them to their just share. But  
their total exclusion calls for prompter Cor  
rectlves; I shall correct the procedure: but  
that done, return with joy to that state of  
things when the only questions concerning  
a candidate shall be, is he honest? Is h  
capable ? Is he faithful to tbe Constitution ?  
T tender you the homage of my high res-  
oect. THOMAS JEF.FKRSO

that of placing the interests of our fellow-citizens in the hands

No duty, at the same time, is more difficult to fulfil. The

&quot;mi ih*offices confided to him williin his own a tats  
are public evidences of the estimation in whloh he ?  
held by the State in general, and the city and town­  
ship particularly in which he lives. He is and to Vs  
the town clerk, a justice of the peace, majOr of W  
city of New Haven, an office held at the will o! ths  
legislature, chief judge of the court of cowuion pleat  
for New ilaveu county, a court of high crimnal and  
civil jurisdiction, wherein most causes ire decided  
without the right of appeal or review, andso;e judge  
of the court ot probates, wherein he singl] decides all  
questions of wills, settlement of estates, estate and  
intestate, appoints guardians, settles tiler accounts,  
and in fact hits under his jurisdiction and tare all me  
property, real and personal, of persons &lt;&#x27;inc. 1 he  
tw., last offices, in the annual gilt ol the legislature  
were given lo him in May last. Is H p.ssiblo that  
the man to whom the legislature ol Conirclicut has  
so recently committed trusts ot such dihcuhy and  
magnitude, is &#x27;unfit to be the collector ol the district  
of New Haven,&#x27; though acknowledgedin the same

life of usefulness 1&#x27; It is objected, indeed, in the re­  
monstrance, that he is seventy-seven gars of age;  
but at a much more advanced age, our ttankltn was  
the ornament of human nature. He mat not be able  
to perform in person all the detail* of hinoffice; but it  
he gives us the lienefit ol his understating, his in­  
tegrity, his watchfulness, and takes care that all the  
details a.e well pet formed by himself ot lis necissary  
assistants, all public purpo*e* will lie anavercd. The  
reu.oustrance, indeed, does not allege tlat the office  
ha* been illy conducted, but only apprwcnils that it  
.rill be so. Should this happen in event be assured 1  
will do in it what shall be just and necissary for the  
public service. In the mean time, he sloultl be tried  
without being prejudged.  
The removal, an it-is called, of Mr. Gtxnlrich, forms  
another subject of complaint. Dcclartlions by my  
self in favor of jwlitical tolerance^ ejhortations lo  
harmony and a flection in social interiourse, and to  
respect for the equal right? of the minurity, have, on  
certain occasions, been quoted and miiconiitrued into  
assurances that the tenure of offices was lo be undis­  
turbed. But could candor apply such l construction!  
It is not indeed in the remonstrance tint we find it;  
but it leads lo the explanations which that calls for.

tration, those who were not of a particiiar sect of poli­

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Wabuinoton, Joly IS, 1801.  
Gentlemen,  
1 have received the remonstrance you were pleased  
to address to me, on the appointment of Samuel Bishop  
to the office of collector of New Haven, lately vacated  
by the death of David Austin. The right of our i  
fellow-citizens te represent to the public fuitctionaries  
their opinion on proceedings interesting to them, is  
unquestionably a constitutional right, often useful, ]  
tometimes necessaiy, and will always be tespectfully  
acknowledged by me. *  
Of the various executive duties, no one excites  
more anxious concern than that of placing the inte- ,  
rests of our fellow-citizens in the hands of honest  
men, with understandings sufficient for their stations.  
No duty, at the same tune, is more difficult to fulfil.  
The knowledge of characters possessed by a single |  
individual is, of necessity, limited. To seek out the ,  
best through the whole U nion, we must resort to other ,  
information,.which, from the best of men, acting dis- (  
interestedly and with the purest motives, is sometimes ,  
incorrect. In the case of Samuel Bishop, however, ,  
the subject of your remonstrance, time was taken, in- (  
formation was sought, and such obtained as could |  
leave no room for doubt of his fitness. From private  
sources it was learned that his understanding was ,  
sound, his integrity pure, his character unstained. .  
And the offices confided to him within his own State  
are public evidences of the estimation in which he is |  
held by the State in general, and the city and town- |  
ship particularly in which he lives. He w &quot;aid to be ,  
  
th? tuoii i iurU, or me peace, major of the  
city of New Haven, an office held at the will or the  
legislature, chief judge of the court of common pleas  
for New Haveu county, a court of high criminal and  
civil jurisdiction, wherein most causes are decided &lt;  
without the right of appeal or review, and sole judge 1  
of the court of probates, wherein he singly decides all 1  
questions of wills, settlement of estates, testate and 1  
intestate, appoints guardians, settles their accounts, 1  
and in fact has under his jurisdiction and care all the &lt;  
property, real and personal, of persons dying. The 1  
two last offices, in the annual gift of the legislature, i  
were given to him in May last. Is it possible that 1  
the man to whom the legislature of Connecticut has 1  
so recently committed trusts of such difficulty and  
magnitude, is &#x27;unfit to be the collector of the district  
of New Haven,&#x27; though acknowledged in the same 1  
writing to have obtained all this confidence &#x27;by along  
life of usefulness T It is objected, indeed, in th&lt; remonstrance,  
that he is seventy-seven years of age;  
but at a much more advanced age, our Franklin was  
the ornament of human nature. He may not be able  
to perform in person all the details of his office ; but if  
he gives us the benefit of his understanding, hit integrity,  
his watchfulness, and takeB care that all the  
details are well pet formed by himself oi his nectmary  
assistants, all public purposes will be answered. The  
remonstrance, indeed, does not allege that the office  
hae been illy conducted, but only apprehends thit it  
will be so. Should this happen in event, be assured I  
will do in it what shall be just and necessary for &#x27;.he  
public service. In the mean time, he should be tried  
without being prejudged.  
The removal, as it is called, of Mr. Goodrich, foims  
another subject of complaint. Declarations by myself  
in favor of political tolerance, exhortations io  
harmony and afiiction in social intercourse, and to  
respect for the equal right? of the minority, have, on  
  
certain occasions, been quoted and misconstrued mo  
assurances that the tenure of offices was to be undisturbed.  
But could candor apply such a construction?  
It is not indeed in the remonstrance that we find it;  
but it leads to the explanations which that calls for.  
When it is considered, that during the late adiniaistration,  
those who were not of a particular sect of poli- 1  
tics were excluded from all office; when, by a steady &#x27;  
pursuit of this measure, nearly the whole offices of the &#x27;  
United States were monopolised by that sect; when &#x27;  
the public sentiment at length declared itself, and I  
buist open the doors of honor and confidence to those 1  
whose opinions they more approved; was it to be &lt;  
imagined that this monopoly of office was still to be &#x27;  
continued in the hands of the minority 1 Does it vio- 1  
late their taual righta to assert some rights in the majority  
also ( Is it political intolerance to claim a proportionate  
share in the direction of the public affairs? 1  
Can they not harmoniet in society unless they have  
every thing in their own hands? If the will of the  
nation, manifested by their various elections, calls for  
an administration of government according with the  
opinions of those elected; if, for the fulfilment of that  
will, displacements are necessary, with whom can  
they so justly begin as with persons appointed in the  
last moments of an administration, not for its own aid,  
but to begin a career at the same time with their successors,  
by whom they had never been approved, and  
who could scarcely expect from them a cordial co-operation  
? Mr. Goodrich was one of these. Was it  
proper for him to place himself in office, without knowing  
whether those whose agent he was to be would  
have confidence in his agency ? Can the preference  
of another as the successor to Mr. Austin be candidly  
called a removal of Mr. Goodrich? If a due participation  
of office is a matter of right, how are vacancies  
to be obtained ? Those by death are few; by resignation  
none. Can any other mode than that of removal  
be proposed ? This is a painful office. But it is  
made my duty, and 1 meet it as such. I proceed in  
the operation with deliberation and inquiry, that it  
may injure the best men least, and effect the purposes  
of justice and public utility with the least private distress  
; that it may be thrown, as much as possible, on  
delinquency, on oppression, on intolerance, on ante  
revolutionary adherence to our enemies.  
The remonstrance laments &#x27; that a change in the  
administration must produce a change in the subordinate  
officers;&#x27; in other words, that it should be deemed  
necessary for all officers to think with their principal.  
But on whom does this imputation bear i On  
those who have excluded fiom office every shade of  
opinion which was not theirs? Or on those who  
have been so excluded ? I lament sincerely that unessential  
differences of opinion should ever have been  
deemed insufficient to interdict half the society from  
the rights and the blessings ol self-government, to  
proscribe them as unworthy of every trust. It would  
have been to me a circumstance of great relief had I  
found a moderate participation of office in the hands of  
the majority. I would gladly have left to lime and  
accident to raise them to their just share. But their  
total exclusion calls for prompter corrections. I shall  
correct the procedure: but that done, return with joy  
  
to that state of things, when the only questions concerning  
a candidate shall be, Is he honest 1 Is he capable  
1 Is he faithful to the constitution 1  
I tender you the homage of my high respect.

move some of the Pectoral incumbents of   
office and fill their places with Democrats.   
Among the instances of such change was   
that of the Collector at New Haven, Conn.   
The Federalists of that town presented a   
strong remonstrance against the change.—  
Mr. Jeffsrson replied to it as follows:—.N.   
Y. Tribune.   
  
45When&#x27;it is considered that during the   
late Administration those who were not of   
a particular sect of politics were excluded   
from all office when, by a steady pursuit of   
this measure, nearly the whole offices of   
the United States were monopolized by that   
sect; when the public sentiment at length   
declared itself, and burst open the doors of   
honor and confidence to those whose opin­  
ions they more approved; was it to bo im­  
agined that this monopoly of office was   
still to be continued in the hands of tho mi­  
nority? Does it violate their equal rights   
to assert some rights in the majority also?   
It is political intolerance to claim a proper•   
  
tionate share in the direction of the public   
affairs? Can they not harmonize in socie­  
ty unless they. have every thing in their   
own hands? If the will of the nation, man-  
  
ifested by their various elections, calls for   
an administration of government according   
with the opinions of those elected; if, for the   
fulfillment of that: will, displacements are   
necessary, with whom can they so justly   
begin as, with persons appointed in the last   
moments of an Administration, not for its   
own aid, but to begin a career at the same   
time with their successors, by whom they   
had never been approved, and who scarcely   
expect from them a cordial corporation?   
&quot;If a due participation of office is a mat   
ter of right, how are vacancies to be obtain.   
ed? Those by death ore few; by resigna­  
tion none. Can any other mode than that   
of removal be proposed? This is a painful   
office. But it is made my duty, and I moot   
it as such. I proceed in the operation   
with deliberation and inquiry, that ►t&#x27; may   
injure the best men least, and affect the   
purposes of justice and public utility with   
the least private distress; that it may be   
thrown as Much as possible, on delinquency   
on oppression, on intolereneo, on ante-revo­  
lutionary adherence to our enemies.   
The remonstrance la ments&quot;that a change   
in the Administration must produce a   
change in the subordinate officers,&quot; in oth­  
er words, that it should be deemed necessa­  
ry for all officers to think with their princi­  
pal. But on whom does this imputation   
bear? On those who have excluded from   
office every shade of opinion which was not   
theirs? Or on those who have been so exClu­  
did? I lament sincerely that unessential   
differences of opinion should ever have been   
deemed sufficient to interdict hall the socio•   
ty from the rights and the blessings of self­  
government, to proscribe them as unworthy   
of every trust. It would have been to me   
a circums&#x27;ence of great relief bad I found a

A Difficult Task.—Of the various execu-  
tive duties, no one excites more anxious  
concern than that of placing the interests  
of our fellow-citizens in the hands of honest  
men, with understandings sufficient for  
their stations. Noduty, at the same time,  
is more difficult to fulfil. The knowledge  
of character possessed by a single indi-  
vidual is, of necessity, limited. To seek  
out the best through the whole Union, we  
must resort to other information, which,  
from the best of men, acting disinterestedly  
and with the purest motives, is sometimes  
incorrect.— President Jefferson.

with men who had opposed his election, and  
his friends excluded for them because ;they  
,were his friends. It is fns of . the earlier  
Presidents&quot; who found this to be the case.  
This was Thomas Jefferson. He set himself,  
to work to do justice, and he removed the  
Collector of Customs7 at New Haven. Some  
persons complain ed of this, &quot; and he wrote to  
them, in these words : X-  
&quot;I lament sincerely, that unessential differ­  
ence of opinion should evier have been deem­  
ed sufficient to interdict half the society from  
the rights and the , blessings of iself-govern-  
ment, arid to proscribe t  
hern as unworthy of  
every trust. But on wbohi does this imputa-  
tion rest?Ort those who  
have excluded from  
office every shade of opinion

Or on those who have been $o excluded It would

office in the hands of the majority. I would  
gladly have left to time and accident to raise  
them to their just share. But their total exclu­  
sion calls for pfompt corrections. I shall correct  
the procedure; but that doner return with joy

Of the various executive duties, no one excite*  
more anxious concern than that of placing the in­

men, with uuderHtaridings sufficient for their (na­

to fulfil. The knowledge of characters possessed

seek out the b?Kt through the whole Union, we  
must resort to other information, which from the

of Samuel Bishop, howrxer, the subject of your re­

was for the purpose, next to the restoration  
of the principles of the early Presidents, of the  
removal from them of the cruel proscription,  
under which they were put during Genr  
Jackson&#x27;s administration.  
And one of the leading principles of the  
early Presidents is the truth we have been  
inculeming in the remarks above. Mr. Jef­  
ferson, in his letter to Elias Shipman, Es.,  
and others, members of a Committee of the  
merchants of New Haven, said:  
The removal, as it is called, of Mr. Good  
rich, forms another subject of complaint  
Declarations by myself in favor of political  
tolerance, exhortation to hurmony and affec­  
tion in social intercourse, and to respect for  
the equal rights of the minority, have, on  
certain occasions, been quoted and miscon  
strued into assurances that the tenure of offi­  
ces was to be undisturbed. But could can­  
dor apply such a construction? It is not,  
indeed, in the remonstrance that we find it,  
but it leads to the explanations which that  
calls for. When it is considered that during  
the late administration, those who were not  
of a particular sect of politics were excluded  
from all office, when by a steady pursuit of  
this measure, nearly the whole offices of the  
United States were monopolized by that  
sect; when the public sentiment at length  
declared itself, and burst open the doors of  
honor and confidence to those whose opin­  
ions they more approved, was it to be imag­  
ined that this monopoly of office was still to  
be continued in the hands of the minority?  
Does it violate their equal rights to assert  
some rights in the majority also? Is it polit­  
ical intolerance to claim a proportionate share  
in the direction of the public affairs? Can  
they not harmonize in society unless they  
have every thing in their own hands? If  
the will of the nation, manifested by their  
various elections, calls for an administration  
of Government according with the opinions  
of those elected; if for the fulfilment of that  
will, displacements are necessary, with whom  
can they so justly begin as with persons ap­  
pointed in the last moment of an adminis­  
tration, not for its own aid, but to begin a  
carcer at the same time with their succes  
by whom they had never been approved,  
and who would scarcely expect from them a  
cordial co-operation? Mr. Goodrich was  
one of these. Was it proper for him to  
place himself in office, without knowing  
whether those whose agent he was to be,  
would have confidence in his agency? Can  
the preference of another as the successor to  
Mr. Austin, be candidly called a removal of  
Mr. Goodrich? If a due participation of of­  
fice is a matter of right, how are vacancies  
to be obtained? Those by death are few.  
By resignation none. Can any other mode  
than that of removal be proposed? This i  
a painful office. But it is made my duty and  
I meet it as such. I proceed in the opera  
tion with deliberation and inquiry, that it  
may injure the best men least, and effect the  
purposes of justice and public utility with the  
least private distress, that it may be thrown,  
as much as possible, on delinquency, on op­  
pression, on intolerance, on antirevolus  
tionary adhcrence to our enemies.  
&quot;The remonstrance laments &quot;that a change  
in the administration must prodoce a change  
in the subordinate officers&quot;--in other words,  
that it should be doemed necessary for all  
officers to think with the principal. But on  
whom does this imputation bear? On those  
who have excluded from office every shade  
of opinion which was not theirs? or on those  
who have heen so excluded? I lament sin-  
cerely that unessential differences of opinion  
should ever have been deemed sufficient to  
interdict half the society from the rights and  
the blessings of self Government; to pro­  
scribe them as unworthy of every trust. It  
would have been to me a circumstance of  
great relief, had I found a moderate partici­  
pation of office in the hands of the majority.  
I would gladly have left time and accident  
to raise them to their just share. But their  
total exclusion calls for prompter corrections.  
I shall correct the procedure; but that done,  
return with joy to that state of things, when  
the only questions concerning a candidate  
shall be, is he honest? is he capable? is he  
faithful to the Constitution?  
&quot;I tender you the homage of my high re  
spect.&quot;THo. JEFFEasON

GENtLEMen. I have received the re­  
monstrance you were pleased to address  
to me, on the appointment of Samuel  
Bishop to the office of collector of New  
Haven, lately vacated by the death of  
David Austin. The right of our fellow  
citizens to represent to the public fune­  
tionaries their opinion on proceedings in­  
teresting to them, is unquestionably a  
constitutional right, often useful, some­  
times necessary, and will always be re­  
spectfully acknowledged by me.  
Of the various executive duties, no one  
excites more anxious concern than that  
of placing the interests of our fellow citi­  
zens in the hands of honest men, with un­  
derstandings sufficient for their stations.  
No duty, at the same time, is more disfi­  
cult to fulfil. The knowledge of characters  
possessed by a single individual is, of ne­  
cessity, limited. To seek out the best  
through the whole Union, we must resort  
to other information, which, from the  
best of men, acting disinterestedly, and  
with the purest motives, is sometimes in­  
correct. In the case of Samuel Bishop  
however the subject of your remonstrance,  
time was taken, information was sought,  
and such obtained as could leave no room  
for doubt of his fitness. From private  
sources it was learned that his under  
standing was sound, his integrity pure,  
his character unstained, and the offices  
confided to him within his own State are  
public evidences of the estimation in  
which he is held by the State in general,  
and the city and township particularly in  
which he lives. He is said to be the  
Town Clerk, a Justice of the Peace,  
Mayor of the City of New Haven, an of­  
fice held at the will of the Legislature,  
Chief Judge of the Court of Common  
Pleas for New Haven County, a Court of  
high criminal and civil jurisdiction  
wherein most cases are decided without  
the right of appeal or review, and sole  
Judge of the Court of Probates, wherein  
he singly decides all questions of wills,  
settlement of estates, testate and intestate,  
appoints guardians, settles their accounts  
and in fact, has under his jurisdiction and  
care, all the property, real and personal,  
of persons dying. The two last offices,  
in the annual gift of the Legislature, were  
given to him in May last Is it possible  
that the man to whom the Legistature of  
Cennecticut has so recently committed  
trusts of such difficulty and magnitude is  
&quot;unfit to be collector of the District of  
Now Haven,&quot; though acknowledged in  
the same writing to have obtained all this  
confidence &quot;by a long course of useful­  
ness.&quot; It is objected, indeed, in the re­  
monstrance, that he is seventy-seven  
years of age; but at a much more advan­  
ced age, our Franklin was the ornament  
of human nature. He may not be able  
to perform in person all the details of his  
office, but if he gives us the benefit of his  
understanding, his integrity, his watch­  
fulness, and takes care that all the details  
are well performed by himself or his ne­  
cessary assistants, all public purposes will  
be answered. The remonstrance, in­  
deed, does not allege that the office has  
been illy conducted, but only apprehends  
that it will be so.--Should this happen in  
event, be assured I will do in it what  
shall be just and necessary for the public  
  
service. In the meantime, he should be  
tried without being judged.  
The removal as it is called, of Mr.  
Goodrich, forms another subject of com­  
plaint. Declarations by myself in favor  
of political tolerance, exhortations to har  
mony and affection in social intercourse,  
and to respect for the equal rights of the  
minority, have, on certain occasions, been  
quoted and misconstrued into assurances  
that the tenure of offices was to be un­  
disturbed. But could candor apply such  
a construction? It is not, indeed, in the  
remonstrance that we find it; but it leads  
to the explanations which that calls for.  
When it is considered that during the  
late administration, those who were not of  
a particular sect of polities were excluded  
from all affice; when, by a steady pursuit  
  
of this measure, nearly the whole offices  
of the United States were monopolized  
by that sect; when the public sentiment

who were not of a particular sect of poli-  
tics were excluded from all office; that

all filled with men who had opposed his  
election, and hjs friends excluded from  
them because they were his friends. It  
is “one of the earlier Presidents” who  
found this to be the ease. Ihis was  
Thomas Jefferson. He set himself to  
work to do justice, and he removed the  
collector of customs at New Haven.  
Some persons complained of this, and he  
wrote to them in these words:  
“I lament sincerely the unessential  
difference of opinion should ever have  
been deemed sufficient to interdict half  
the society from the rights and the bles­  
sings of self government, and to proscribe  
them as unworthy of every trust. But on  
whom does this imputation rest? On  
those who have excluded from office ev­

Or on those who have been so excluded?  
It would have been to me a circumstance  
of great relief, had I found a moderate  
participation of office in the hands of the  
majority, I would gladly have left to tune  
aud accident to raise them to their just  
share. But their total exclusion calls  
for prompt corrections. I shall correct  
the procedure, but that done, return with  
joy to that state of things when the only  
question concerning a candidate shall be:  
is he honest, is he capable, is he faithful  
to the constitution?  
If a due participation of office is a mat­  
ter ol right, how are vacancies to be ob­  
tained? Those by death are few, resig­  
nations none. Can any other mode than  
that of removal be proposed? This is a  
painful office. But it is made my duty

Rep.  
&quot;When it is considered that during the late  
Administration those who were not of a particu­  
lar sect of politics were excluded from all office;  
when, by a steady pursuit of this measure, near­  
ly the whole offices of the United States were  
monopolized by that sect; when the public sen­  
timent at length declared itself, and burst open  
the doors of honor and confidence to those whose  
opinions they more approved; was it to be im­  
agined that this monopoly of office was still to  
be continued in the hands of the minority?  
Does it violate their equal rights to assert some  
rights in the majority also? Is it political intol-  
erance to claim a proportionate share in the di  
rection of the public affairs? Can they not har-  
monize in society unless they have every thing  
in their own hands? If the will of the nation  
manifested by their various elections, calls for  
an administration of Government according with  
the opinions of those elected; if, for the fuifil­  
ment of that will, displacements are necessary,  
with whom can they so justly begin as with per  
sons appointed in the last moments of an admin­  
istration, not for its own ald, but to begin a ca­  
reer at the same time with their successors, by  
whom they had never been approved, and who  
could scarcely expect from them a cordial co-op-  
cration.  
If a due participation of office is a matter of  
right, how are vacancies to be obtained? Those

Washington, July 12, 1801.—Gentlemen:  
I have received the reiuonstr;  
committee of  
you  
pleased to address to me on the appointment  
Of Samuel Bishop to the office of Collector  
of New Haven, lately vacated by the deatli  
of David Austin. Tbe right of  
citizens to represent to the public function­  
aries their opinion  
to them i  
fellow­  
proceedings interesting  
nquestionably a constitutional  
right, often useful, sometimes necessary,and  
will always be respectfully acknowledged  
by me.  
Of the  
ious execu tive duties  
cites more anxious concern than that of  
plaoing the interests of our fellow-eitizeus  
in the hands of honest  
standings sufficient for their stations,  
duty, at the same time, i  
fulfill. The knowledge of characters  
nossed by a single individual is, of necessity,  
limited. To seek out the best through the  
whole Union we must resort to other iufor­  
itii under­  
No  
e difficult to  
DOS*  
mation, which, from the best of  
disinterestedly and with the purest motives,  
is sometimes incorrect. In the  
, acting  
of Sam­  
uel Bishop, however, the subject of you,,  
remonstrance, time was taken, information  
sought, and such obtained  
could  
leave  
room for doubt of hi  
fitues8.  
From private sources it was learned that his  
understanding  
his character unstained.  
sound,his integrity pure,  
And tfio offices  
confided to him within his  
State are  
public evidences of the est mation in Which  
lie is held by the State tn general and the  
city and township particularly in which he  
lives. He is said to be the Town Clerk, a  
Justice of the Peace, Mayor of the city of  
Now Haven,  
Legislature; Chief Judge of the Court of  
Common Pleas for New Haveu county, a  
Court of high cvimiual and civil jurisdiction  
wherein most causes  
office held at the will of the  
decided without  
the right of appeal or review,and sole Judge  
of tli© Court of Probates, wbereiu he singly  
decides all questions of wills, settlement of  
«states, testate and intestate; appoints  
guardians, settles their accounts, and, in  
fact, has under his jurisdiction and care all  
the property, real and personal, of per  
dying. The r,wo last offices, in the annual  
gift of the Legislature, were given to him in  
May last. Is it possible that the man  
whom tli© Legislature of Couuectiout lias  
recently committed trusts of such difficulty  
aud magnitude is &quot;unfit to be the Collector  
of the district of New Haveu,&quot; though ac­  
knowledged in the same writing to have  
obtained all tills confidence &quot;by a long life  
of usefulness?&quot; It is objected, indeed, in  
the romoustr  
to  
that ho is 77 years of age;  
but at a much more advanced age our  
Franklin was the ornament of human  
nature. He may not be able to perform in  
  
may perform  
person all the details of his office; but if lie  
gives us the benefit of ills understanding, his  
integrity, his watchfulness, and takes  
that all the details  
himself  
woll performed by  
his necessary assistants,all public  
purposes will bo answered. The remou­  
«trance, indeed, does not allege that the  
office has been illy conducted, but only  
apprehends that it will be  
happen iu event, bo assured, I will do i  
what shall be just and necessary for the  
public service. In the meantime, ho should  
be tried without beiug prejudged.  
The removal, as it is called, of Mr. Good­  
rich forms another subiect of complaint.  
Declarations by myself in favor of political  
* tolerance , exhortations to harmony and affec­  
tion in social intercourse and to respect for  
.the equal rights of the minority have, on  
itain occasions, been quoted aud miscon­  
strued into assurances that the tenure of  
.offices  
Should this  
to be undisturbed. But could  
•candor apply such a construction ? It is  
;uofc, indeed, in the remonstrance that  
Itiaul it, but, it leads to tbe explanations  
which that calls for. When it is considered  
that during the late Administration those  
who  
not of a particular sect of politics  
were excluded from all office, when, by a  
steady pursuit of this measure,  
whole offices of the United States  
ly the  
monopolized by that sect; when the public  
sentiment at length declared itself, and  
burst open the doors of honor aud confidence  
to those whoæ opinions they more approved,  
was it to be imagined that this monopoly of  
office was still to be continued iu the bauds  
of the minority? D,&#x27;es it violate their equal  
rights to assert some rights in the majority  
also ? Is it political intolerance to claim a  
proportionate share in the direction of the  
public affaire? Can they not harmonize iu  
society unless they have everything in their  
•own hands ? If the will of tho nation, mani­  
fested by these various elections, calls for  
-Administration of government according  
with the opinions of those elected; if, for the  
fulfillment; of that will, displacements are  
necessary, with whom can they so justly  
bogiu as with persons appointed in the last  
moments of an Administration, not for its  
aid but to begin a career at the same  
time witti their successors, by whom Ltiey  
had never been approved, and who could  
scarcely expect from them a cordial co-oper­  
ation? Mr. Goodrich was one of these.  
Was it proper for him to place himself in  
office without knowing whether those whose  
agent he was to be would have confidence in  
Ids agency ? Can the preference of another,  
the successor to Mr. Austin, be candidly  
called a removal of Mr. Goodrioh ? If a due  
participation of office is a matter of right,  
how are vacancies to be obtained ?  
by death  
Can any other mode than that of removal  
be proposed ? This is a painful office; but  
il is made my duty, and 1 meet it as such.  
Those  
few; by resignation, none.  
  
I proceed in the operation with deliberation  
and inquiry, that it may injure the best  
least and effect Ihe purposes of justice &#x27;amt  
public utility with the least private diat  
that it may be thrown, as much  
delinquency,  
ance, on ante­  
enemies.

iu the Administration must produce a  
change iu the subordinate officers;&quot; in other

8ary for all officers to think with their

whom does this imputa

WAsHINGTON, July 12, 1801  
  
  
GENTLEMeN: I have received the remon  
  
strance you were pleased to address to me on  
the appointment of Samuel Bisiop to the office  
of Collector of Now Haven, lately vacated by  
the death of David Austin. The right of our  
follow citizens to represent to the public func­  
tionaries their opinion on proceedings inter  
esting to them is unquestionably a constitu  
tional right, often useful, sometimes necessary  
and will always be respectfully acknowledged  
by me  
Of the various exocutive duties, no one ex  
cites more anxious concern than that of plac  
ing the interests of our fellow citizens in the  
hands of honest men, with understandings  
sufficient for their stations. No duty at the  
same time is more difficult to fulfil. The  
knowledge of character possessed by a sin  
gle individual is, of necessity, limitod  
To seek out the best through the whole  
Union, we must resort to other informa­  
tion, which, from the best of mon, acting  
disinterestedly and with the purest motives, is  
sometimes incorrect. In the case of SAMUe  
Bishop, however, the subject of your remon­  
strance, time was taken, information was  
sought, and such obtained as could leave no  
room for doubt of his fitness. From private  
sources it was learned that his understanding  
was sound, his integrity pure, his character  
unstained. And the offices confided to him  
within his own State are public evidences  
of the estimation in which he is held by  
the State in general and the city and town­  
ship particularly in which he lives. He is  
said to be the Town Clerk, a Justice of the  
Peace, Mayor of the city of New Haven, an of  
fice held at the will of the Legislature, Chief  
Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for New  
Haven county, a court of high criminal and  
civil jurisdiction wherein most causes are de­  
cided without the right of appeal or review  
and sole Judge of the Court of Probates, where  
in he singly decides all questions of wills, set­  
tlement of estates, testate and intestate, ap­  
points guardians, settles their accounts  
and, in fact, has, under his jurisdic­  
tion and care, all the property, rea  
and personal, of persons dying. The two  
last offices in the annual gift of the Legis­  
lature were given to him in May last, Is it  
possible that the man to whom the Legislature  
of Connecticut has so recently committed  
trusts of such difficulty and magnitude is  
unfit to be the Collector of the District of New  
Haven,&#x27; though acknowledged in the same  
writing to have obtained all this confidence by  
a long life of usefulness?&quot; It is objected, in­  
deed, in the remonstrance, that he is seventy  
seven years of age; but at a much more  
advanced age our Franelin was the  
ornament of human nature. He may  
not be able to perform in person all  
the details of his office; but if he gives us  
the benefit of his understanding, his integrity  
his watchfulness, and takes care that all the  
details are well performed by himself or his  
necessary assistants, all public purposes will  
be answered. The remonstrance, indeed, does  
not allege that the office has been illy conduct­  
ed, but only apprehends that it will be so  
Should this happen, in event, be assured I will  
do in it what shall be just and necessary for the

that it should be deemed necossary for all ofl  
cors to think with their principal? But on  
whom does this imputation bear? On those  
who have oxcluded from office every shade of  
opinion which was not theirs? Or on those who  
  
have been so oxcluded? I lament sinceroly that  
unessential differonces of opinion should ever  
have been deomed sufficient to interdict half  
the society from the rights and the bless  
ings of self-govornment; to proscribe them  
as unworthy of every trust. It would have been  
to me a circumstance of great relief had I  
found a moderate participation of office in the  
hands of the majority. I would gladly have  
left to time and accident to raise them to thoir  
just share. But their total exclusion calls for  
crompter corrections. I shall correct the pro  
cedure; but that done, return with joy to that

been misconstrued as assurances that “‘ the tenure of office was not
