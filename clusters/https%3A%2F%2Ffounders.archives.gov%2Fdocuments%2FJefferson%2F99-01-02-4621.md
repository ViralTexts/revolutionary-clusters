To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the US. of America  
  
  
Dec. 3. 1806.  
  
  
I have the satisfaction to inform you that the negociation depending between the US. and the government of  
Great Britain is proceeding in a spirit of friendship &amp; accomodation which promises a result of mutual advantage. delays  
indeed have taken place occasioned by the long illness, and subsequent death of the British minister charged with that  
duty. but the Commissioners appointed by that government to resume the negociation have shewn every disposition to hasten  
it’s progress. it is however a work of time; as many arrangements are necessary to place our future harmony on stable  
grounds. in the mean time we find by the communications of our plenipotentiaries, that a temporary suspension of the act  
of the last session, prohibiting certain importations, would, as a mark of candid disposition on our part, &amp; of  
confidence in the temper &amp; views with which they have been met, have a happy effect on it’s course. a step so friendly  
will afford further evidence that all our proceedings have flowed from views of justice &amp; conciliation, and that we give  
them willingly that form which may best meet corresponding dispositions.  
Add to this that the same motives which produced the postponement of the act till the 15th. of November last,  
are in favor of it’s further suspension: and as we have reason to hope that it may soon yield to arrangements of mutual  
consent &amp; convenience, justice seems to require that the same measure may be dealt out to the few cases which may fall  
within it’s short course, as to all others preceding &amp; following it. I cannot therefore but recommend the suspension of  
this act for a reasonable time, on considerations of justice, amity, &amp; the public interests.

Special Message from the President.  
  
To the Senate and House of Representatives  
of the United States of America,  
  
I have the satisfaction to inform you that  
the negociation depending between the Uni-  
ted States and the government of Great  
Britain, is proceeding in a spirit of friend-  
ship and accommodation which promises a  
result of mutual advantage. Delays indeed  
have taken place, occasioned by the lon  
illness, and subsequent death of the British  
minister charged with the duty. But the  
commissioners appointed by that govern-  
ment to resume the negociation, have  
shewn every disposition to hasten its prog-  
ress, it is however a work of time; as ma-  
ny arrangements are necessary to place our  
future harmony on stable grounds. In the  
mean time, we find, by the communications  
of our plenipotentiaries, that a temporary  
saspension of the act of the last session,  
prohibiting certain importations, would,as a  
maxk of candid disposition on our part, and  
of confidence in the temper and views with  
which they have been met, have a Wappy ef-  
fect on its course.  
  
A step so friendly will afford further evi-  
dence that all our proceedings have flowed  
from views of justice and conciliation, and  
that we give them willingly that form which  
may best meet corresponding dispositions.  
  
Add to this that the same motives which  
produced the postponement of the act tiil  
the fifteenth of November last, are in favor  
of its further suspension: and as we have  
reason to hope that it may soon yield to ar-  
rangements of mutual consent and conve-  
njence, justice seems to require that the  
same measure may be dealt out to the few  
cases which may fall within its short course,  
as to all others preceding and following it.  
I cannot therefore, but recommend the sus-  
pension of this act for a reasonable time. on  
considerations of justice, amity, and the pub-  
lic interests.
