to the temper of two or three individuals; but the wise ascribed it to the nature of man. the failure of the French Directory, and from the same cause, seems to have authorised a belief that the form of a plurality, however promising in theory is impracticable with men constituted with the ordinary passions. while the tranquil &amp; steady tenor of our single Executive, during a course of twenty two years of the most tempestuous times the history of the world has ever presented, gives a rational hope that this important problem is at length solved. aided by the counsels of a Cabinet of heads of departments, originally four, but now five, with whom the President consults, either singly or all together, he has the benefit of their wisdom and information, brings their views to one center, &amp; produces an unity of action &amp; direction in all the branches of the government. the excellence of this construction of the Executive power has already manifested itself here under very opposite circumstances. during the administration of our first President, his cabinet, of four members, was equally divided, by as marked an opposition of principle as monarchism and republicanism could bring into conflict. had that Cabinet been a Directory, like positive and negative quantities in Algebra, the opposing wills would have balanced each other, and produced a state of absolute inaction. but the President heard with calmness the opinions and reasons of each, decided the course to be pursued, and kept the government steadily in it, unaffected by the agitation. the public knew well the dissentions of the Cabinet, but never had an uneasy thought on their account; because they knew also they had provided a regulating power which would keep the machine in steady movement. I speak with an intimate knolege of these scenes, quorum pars fui; as I may of others of a character entirely opposite. the third administration, which was of eight years, presented an example of harmony in a cabinet of six persons, to which perhaps history has furnished no parallel. there never arose, during the whole time, an instance of an unpleasant thought or word between the members. we sometimes met under differences of opinion, but scarcely ever failed, by conversing &amp; reasoning, so to modify each other’s ideas, as to produce an unanimous result. yet, able &amp; amiable as these members were, I am not certain this would have been the case had each possessed equal &amp; independant powers. ill-defined limits of their respective departments, jealousies trifling at first, but nourished &amp; strengthened by repetition of occasions, intrigues without doors of designing persons to build an importance to themselves on the divisions of others, might, from small beginnings, have produced persevering oppositions. but the power of decision in the president left no object for internal dissension, &amp; external intrigue was stifled in embryo by the knolege which incendiaries possessed that no divisions they could foment would change the course of the Executive power

party of ‘un et indivisible’ had prevailed: no Provincial organisations existed to which the people might rally under authority of the laws, the seats of the Directory were virtually vacant, and a small force sufficed to turn the legislature out of their chamber, &amp; to salute it’s leader Chief of the nation. but with us, sixteen out of seventeen states rising in mass, under regular organisation, &amp; legal commanders, united in object &amp; action by their Congress, or, if that be in duresse, by a special Convention, present such obstacles to an Usurper as forever to stifle ambition in the first conception of that object.Dangers of another kind might more reasonably be apprehended from this perfect &amp; distinct organisation, civil &amp; military, of the states; to wit, that certain states from local &amp; occasional discontents, might attempt to secede from the Union. this is certainly possible; &amp; would be befriended by this regular organisation. but it is not probable that local discontents can spread to such an extent as to be able to face the sound parts of so extensive an union: &amp; if ever they should reach the majority, they would then become the regular government, acquire the ascendancy in Congress, &amp; be able to redress their own grievances by laws peaceably &amp; constitutionally passed. and even the states in which local discontents might engender a commencement of fermentation, would be paralysed and self-checked by that very division into parties into which we have fallen, into which all states must fall wherein men are at liberty to think, speak, &amp; act freely, according to the diversities of their individual conformations, and which are perhaps essential to preserve the purity of the government, by the censorship which these parties habitually exercise over each other
