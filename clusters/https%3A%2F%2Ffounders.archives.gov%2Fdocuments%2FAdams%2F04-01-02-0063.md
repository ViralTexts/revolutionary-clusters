“Parent who vast pleasure find’s  
In forming of her childrens minds  
In midst of whom with vast delight  
She passes many a winters Night  
Mingles in every play to find  
What Bias Nature gave the mind  
Resolving thence to take her aim  
To guide them to the realms of fame  
And wisely make those realms the way

In simple tales beside the fire,  
The noblest Notions to inspire.
