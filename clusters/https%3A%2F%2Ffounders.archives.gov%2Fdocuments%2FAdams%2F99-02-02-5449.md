comparison: Faction buzzes over the body which gave it bulk, and devours it, as the bees, according to Virgil’s story, of their production, fasten on, and become gleen with the vitiated juices of the stag—and, after the manner of these bees, in another stage of their history, faction, when it comes to its own strife, settles it with a king. The materials of such a faction constantly exist in the causes of Government, but it is systematized and put in motion, either by those who are  
“So weary, with disasters, so tugg’d with fortune,  
That they’d set their life on any chance

“Our country sinks beneath the yoke;  
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash

If these cuts of misfortune could serve us like the bite of Virgil’s Culex on the Shepherd, to warn us of the coming of the serpent, we should wake and stand on our defence. But it will not be so; for these dangers do not hiss till their deleterious power has unnerved the people; but they allure, like the Siren, singing till the moment of destruction.
