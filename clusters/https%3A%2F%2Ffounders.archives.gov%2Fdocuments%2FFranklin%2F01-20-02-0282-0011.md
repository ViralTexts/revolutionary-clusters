.  
I have your very obliging favor of the 4th of October. I find myself constrained as well by this letter as by my son and daughter Spooner’s letters since, to render you my most sincere thanks for the very polite notice you have taken of them; and I pray my most respectful compliments to the good lady your mother, whose friendly reception of them at Nonsuch has, I find engaged the warmest esteem and respect. He hath wrote us that he had a prospect of succeeding in the business he went upon; but the last letter we had was from her of the 23d of November, acquainting us that he had been very ill, but was getting better. She writes as a person overcome with a sense of the kindness they had met with, in a place where they were strangers, on this trying occasion.  
You have heard of the arrival of the King’s troops, the quiet reception they met with among us was not at all surprizing to me. I am sorry there was any occasion for sending them. From the address of the gentlemen of the council to General Gage, it might be supposed there was none. I have seen a letter from our friend Ingersoll with this paraphrase upon it. “We hope that your Excellency observing with your own eyes now the troops are among us, our peaceable and quiet behavior, will be convinced that wicked G——r B——d told a fib in saying, We were not so before they came.” I have given you the sense of a stranger on a single paragraph of this address, because I suspected my own opinion of it, ’till I found it thus confirm’d. If you have the newspapers containing the address, your own good sense will lead you to make some other remarks upon it, as well as to trace the influence under which it seems to have been penned. The disturbers of our peace take great advantage of such aids from people in office and power. The lieutenant governor has communicated to me your letter containing an account of the debates in parliament on the first day of the session: We soon expect their decision on American affairs, some I doubt not with fear and trembling. Yet I have very lately had occasion to know, that be the determination of parliament what it will, it is the determination of some to agree to no terms that shall remove us from our old foundation. This confirms me in an opinion that I have taken up a long time since, that if there be no way to take off the original incendiaries, they will continue to instill their poison into the minds of the people through the vehicle of the BOSTON GAZETTE.  
In your letter to the lieutenant governor you observe upon two defects in our constitution, the popular election of the Council, and the return of Juries by the Towns. The first of these arises from the Charter itself; the latter from our provincial Laws. The method of appointing our Grand Juries lies open to management. Whoever pleases, nominates them at our town-meeting; by this means one who was suppos’d to be a principal in the Riots of the 10th of June last, was upon that Jury whose business it was to inquire into them: But the provincial legislature hath made sufficient provision for the return of Petit Juries by their act of 23d Geo. 2d, which requires the several towns to take lists of all persons liable by law to serve, and forming them into two classes, put their names written on separate papers into two different boxes, one for the superior court and the other for the inferior: And when veniries are issued, the number therein required are to be drawn out in open town-meeting, no person to serve oftner than once in three years. The method of appointing Grand Juries appears indeed defective; but if the other is not it may be imputed to the times rather than to the defect of the laws, that neither the Grand Juries nor the Petit Juries have of late answered the expectations of government.  
As to the appointment of the council, I am of opinion that neither the popular elections in this province, nor their appointment in what are called the royal governments by the King’s mandamus, are free from exceptions, especially if the council as a legislative body is intended to answer the idea of the house of lords in the British legislature. There they are suppos’d to be a free and independent body, and on their being such the strength and firmness of the constitution does very much depend: whereas the election or appointment of the councils in the manner before mentioned renders them altogether dependent on their constituents. The King is the fountain of honour, and as such the peers of the realm derive their honours from him; but then they hold them by a surer tenure than the provincial counsellors who are appointed by mandamus. On the other hand, our popular elections very often expose them to contempt; for nothing is more common than for the representatives, when they find the council a little untractable at the close of the year, to remind them that May is at hand.  
It may be accounted by the colonies as dangerous to admit of any alterations in their charters, as it is by the governors in the church to make any in the establishment; yet to make the resemblance as near as may be to the British parliament, some alteration is necessary. It is not requisite that I know of, that a counsellor shou’d be a freeholder; his residence according to the charter is a sufficient qualification; for that provides only, that he be an inhabitant of or proprietor of lands within the district for which he is chosen: Whereas the peers of the realm sit in the house of lords, as I take it, in virtue of their baronies. If there should be a reform of any of the colony charters with a view to keep up the resemblance of the three estates in England, the legislative council shou’d consist of men of landed estates; but as our landed estates here are small at present, the yearly value of £100 sterling per annum might in some of them at least be a sufficient qualification. As our estates are partable after the decease of the proprietor, the honour could not be continued in families as in England: it might however be continued in the appointee quom diu bene se gesserit, and proof be required of some mal-practice before a suspicion or removal. Bankruptcy also might be another ground for removal. A small legislative council might answer the purposes of government; but it might tend to weaken that levelling principle, which is cherish’d by the present popular constitution, to have an honorary order establish’d, out of which the council shou’d be appointed. There is no way now to put a man of fortune above the common level, and exempt him from being chosen by the people into the lower offices, but his being appointed a justice of the peace; this is frequently done when there is no kind of expectation of his undertaking the trust, and has its inconveniences. For remedy hereof it might be expedient to have an order of Patricians or Esquires instituted, to be all men of fortune or good landed estates, and appointed by the governor with the advice of council, and enroll’d in the secretary’s office, who shou’d be exempted from the lower offices in government as the justices now are; and to have the legislative council (which in the first instance might be nominated by the Crown) from time to time fill’d up as vacancies happen out of this order of men, who, if the order consisted only of men of landed estates, might elect, as the Scottish peers do, only reserving to the King’s governor a negative on such choice. The King in this case wou’d be still acknowledged as the fountain of honour, as having in the first instance the appointment of the persons enroll’d, out of whom the council are to be chosen, and finally having a negative on the choice. Or, the King might have the immediate appointment by mandamus as at present in the royal governments. As the gentlemen of the council would rank above the body from which they are taken, they might bear a title one degree above that of esquire. Besides this legislative council, a privy council might be establish’d, to consist of some or all of those persons who constitute the legislative council, and of other persons members of the house of representatives or otherwise of note and distinction; which wou’d extend the honours of government, and afford opportunity of distinguishing men of character and reputation, the expectation of which wou’d make government more respectable.  
I wou’d not trouble you with these reveries of mine, were I not assured of your readiness to forgive the communication, although you could apply it to no good purpose.  
Mr. Spooner sent me a pamphlet under a blank cover, intituled, “the state of the nation”. I run over it by myself before I had heard any one mention it, and tho’t I cou’d evidently mark the sentiments of some of my friends. By what I have since heard and seen, it looks as if I was not mistaken. Your right honorable friend I trust will not be offended if I call him mine, I am sure you will not when I term you such, I have settled it for a long time in my own mind that without a representation in the supreme legislature, there cannot be that union between the head and the members as to produce a healthful constitution of the whole body. I have doubted whether this union could be perfected by the first experiment. The plan here exhibited seems to be formed in generous and moderate principles, and bids the fairest of any I have yet seen to be adopted. Such a great design may as in painting require frequent touching before it becomes a piece highly finish’d; and after all may require the miliorating hand of time to make it please universally. Thus the British constitution consider’d as without the colonies attain’d it’s glory. The book I had sent me is in such request, that I have not been able to keep it long enough by me, to consider it in all its parts. I wish to hear how it is receiv’d in the house of commons. I find by the publications both of governor Pownall and Mr. Bollan, that they each of them adopt the idea of an union and representation, and I think it must more and more prevail. The argument against it from local inconveniency, must as it appears to me be more than balanc’d by greater inconveniencies on the other side the question, the great difficulty will be in the terms of union. I add no more, as I fear I have already trespass’d much on your time and patience, but that I am, Sir, your obliged and most obedient humble Servant,   
Andw. Oliver

* be n) way to take off the original incendi-  
Mes, they will continue to inſtill their poiſon in-  
to Me minds of the people through the vehicle  
of the BOSTON GAZETTE.  
In your letter to the lieutenant gevernor you  
obſerve two defects in our eonſtitution, the  
popular eleftion of the Council, and the return  
of Juries by the Towns, The firſt of theſe a-  
- riſes from the Charter itſelf; the latter from our  
| provincial Laws. The method of appcinting our  
Grand Juries lies open to management. Whoe-  
ver pleaſes, nominates them at our town-meet-  
ings; by this means one who was ſuppos&#x27;d to be  
a principal in the Riots of the roth of June laſt,  
was upon that Jury whole bulineſs it was to in-  
qulre  
  
  
hath made ſufficient proviſion for ih TY of  
Petit Junes by their a&amp; of .23d Geo. 2d, which  
requires the ſeveral towns to take liſts of all per»  
ſons liable by law to ſerve, and forming them ig»  
to two claſſes, put their names written on feparate  
papers into two different boxes, one for the ſu-  
perior court and the-other for the inferior: And  
when veniries are iſſued, the number therein re-  
quired are to be drawn out in open town» meet ·  
ing, no perſon to ſerve oftner than onee in three  
years The method of appointing Grand Juries  
appears indeed defecive; but if the other is not  
it may be imputed to the times rather than to the  
defect of the laws that neither the Grand Ju-  
ries nor the Pexit Jurjes have of late anſwered the  
expectations of government,  
As to the appointment of the council, I am  
of opinion that neither the popular elections in  
this province, nor their appointment in what are  
called the royal goveraments by the King&#x27;s man-  
damus, are free from exceptions, eſpecially.  
council as a legillative body is intended tower  
the idea of the houſe of lords in the Brittth le -  
giſlature. There they are ſuppos&#x27;d to be a free  
and independent body, and on their.being ſuch  
the ſtrength and firmneſs of the canſlitution does  
very much depend: whereas the election or ap-  
pointmeat of the councils in the manner before  
mentioned renders them altogether dependent on  
their conſtituenis. The King is the fountain of  
honour, and as ſuch the peers of the realm derive  
their honours from him; but then they hold  
them by a ſorer tenure than the provincial coun-  
felogs who are appointed by mandamus. On  
| 2 the  
  
36 J  
  
che other hand, our popular tleaions very often  
expoſe them to contempt; for nothing is more  
common, than for the fepreſentatives, when th  
find the council a little untractable at the cloſe  
of the year, to remind them that May is at hand.  
It may be accounted by the eglonies as dan-  
gerous to admit of any alterations in their charters,  
as it is by the governors in the chureh to make  
| any in the eftabliſhment-; yet to make the re-  
| ſemblance as near as may be to the Britiſh pars  
liament, ſome alteration is neceſſary. |  
W - It is not requiſite that I know of, that a  
| counſellor ſnou&#x27;d be a freeholder; his reſidence  
according to the! charter is a ſufficjent quilifica-  
tion; for that provides only, that he be an inha-  
bitatit of or proprĩetòr of lands within the diſtrict  
for which he is choſen : whereas the peers of  
the realm ſit in the hovſe of lords, as J take it,  
in virtue of their baronies, If there ſhou!d be a  
reform of any of the colony charters with a view  
18088 up the reſemblance of the three eſtates  
in gend, te legiſlative council ſhou&#x27;d- conſiſt  
of of landed eſtates; but as our landed  
eſtates here are fmall at preſent, the yearly value  
of J. too ſterling per annum might in ſome of  
them at leaſt be a ſufficient qualification, As our  
ellates are partable after the deceaſe of the pro-  
prietor, the Honour could not be continued in  
families as in England: It might however be con-  
tinued in the appointee quam diu bene ſe peſſern,  
and proof be required of ſome mal - practice be-  
fore a faſpenſion or removal. Bankruptcy al ſo  
might be another ground for removal. A ſmall  
legiflative council might anſwer the purpoſes of  
government; but it might tend to weaken that  
levelling  
  
  
fent popular conſtitution, to have an honqrary  
order eſtabliſh&#x27;d, out of which the council fhou&#x27;d  
be appointed. There is no way now to put a  
man of fortune above the common level, and  
  
exempt him from being choſen by the people  
  
into the lower offices, but his being appoimted a  
juſtice of the peace; this is frequently done when  
  
there is no kind of expectation of his undertak-  
  
ing the truſt, and has its inconveniences. For  
  
remedy hereof it might be expedient to have an  
  
order of Patricians or Eſquires inſtituted, to be  
  
all men of fortune or good landed eſtates, and  
appointed by the governor with the advice of  
  
council; and enroll&#x27;d in the ſecretary&#x27;s office,  
  
who ſhou&#x27;d be exempted from the lower offices  
  
in government as the juſſices now are; and to  
  
have the legiſlative council . (which in the firſt  
  
inſtance might be nominated by the Crown) from  
  
- time to time fill&#x27;d up, as vacancies happen out of  
this order of men, who, it the order conſiſted  
  
only of men of landed eſtates, might elect, as  
  
the Scottiſh peers do, only reſerving to theKing&#x27;s  
  
governor a negative on ſuch choice. The King  
  
in this caſe wou&#x27;d be ſtill acknowledged as the  
  
fountain of honour, as having in the firſt inſtance  
  
the appointment of the perſons enroll&#x27;d, out of  
  
&#x27; whom the council are to be chofen, and finally  
  
having a negative on the choice. Or, the King  
  
might have the immediate appointment by man-  
  
» damus as at preſent in the royal governments.  
  
As the gentlemen of the council would rank  
  
above the body from which they are taken, they  
  
might bear a title one degree above that of eſquire.

I HAVE your very obliging favour^  
the 4tb of October. 1 find nyfelf  
conftrained, as well by this letter, at bf  
my fon and daughter Spooner&#x27;s letters  
fince, to render you my moft fincera  
thanks for the very polite notice you  
have taken of theen; and I pray my nuft  
reIpedtful compliments to the good lady  
your mother, whofe friendly reception  
of them at Nonfneh has, 1 find, engaged  
their warmeft efteem and refpcdk—He  
hath wrote&#x27;us, that he had a proltK^ of  
fucoeeding in the bufinefs he went upon;  
but the laft letter we had was from her  
of the xjd of November, acquainting ••  
that he had been very ill, but was getting  
better. She writes as a perfon Over¬  
come with a fenfe of the Ijodneft they  
had met with, in a place where they  
were ftrangers, on this trying occafioB*  
You have heard uf the arnval of the  
kin^s troops: theqaict reception they  
met with among ui was not  
prifing to me.—I am forry there was sny  
occafi^ for fending them. From the  
addvefs of the gentlcnfwo of the c ouncti  
tfj gen. Gage, it might be fupiHjfcd there  
was none. I have feen a letter f^om oW

1 ha VC given you the fenfe of a  
OD a fingle paragraph of this addrclii®^  
  
EDINBURGH AMUSEMENT  
  
tatifc I fnfpcfted my own opinion of it,  
till I found it thus confirmed.—If you  
have the news papers containing the ad*  
drefs, yuur own good tenfe will lead you  
to make fimie other remarks upon it, at  
well as to trace the infiuence under  
which it feems to have been penned.  
The difturbers of our peace take great  
advantage of fuch aids from people in  
office and power.—The lieutenant go¬  
vernor has communicated to me yout  
letter, containing an account of the de¬  
bates in parliament on the firft day of the  
ftffion: Wc foon expedt their dedlion  
on Ainc’rtcan affairs, fome, I doubt not,  
with fear and trembling—Yet I have ve¬  
ry lately had occafion to know, that, be  
the determination of parliament what it  
will, it is the determination of fbme to  
agree to no terms that (halt remove us  
from our old foundation. This confirms  
me in an opinion that I have taken up a  
long lime fince, that, if there be no way  
to take ulf the original incendiaries, they  
will continue to in(W their poifon into  
the minds of the people through the ve¬  
hicle of the Boston Gazette.  
  
In your letter to the lieutenant-gover¬  
nor, you obferve upon two defedfs In onr  
conftitjition, the popular elcdtion of the  
council, and the return of juries by the  
towns. The firft of thefc arifes from the  
charter itlelf, the latter from our provin¬  
cial laws. The method of appointing  
our grand juries lies open to manage¬  
ment. Whoever pleafes nominates them  
at our town-meetifigs; by this means,  
one who was fuppofed to 1^ a prtocip^  
in the riots of the loth of June Uft, was  
upon that jury whole buHnefs it was to  
inquire Into them; 5ul the provincial le-  
gillature hath made fiifficient protifion  
for the return of petit juries, by their ad  
of the 13d Geo. If. which requires the  
fevera! towms to take lifts of all perfons  
liable by law to ferve, and forming Ihetn  
into two cfafTet, put their names, writ¬  
ten on fcparaic papers,.into two df^ent  
boxes, one fSr the fiiperiur court, and  
The other for the inferior; and when ve-  
.niries are iflurd, the number therein re¬  
quired are to be draum out in open  
town-meeting; no perfon to ferve of*  
tener than once in three years.—The  
.method of appointing grand juries ap-  
• pears indeed defedtive; but, if the other  
.IS not. it may be imputed to the times,  
rather than to the defi;dt of the laws—  
^that neither the grand juries,uor the petit  
  
375  
  
juries, have of late anlWered the expect  
tations of govern men t.  
  
As to the appointment of the council,  
I am of opinion that neither the popular  
eledtlons in this province, nor their ap^  
pointment in what are called the ruyat  
governments by the king&#x27;s&#x27;mandamus;  
are free from exceptions, cfpecially if the  
council, as a Irgiflativcbody, is intended  
to anfwrr the idea of the houfe »^f lords  
In the Britilh legiQatiirc. There Ihe^  
are ftippofed to be a free and Indepen¬  
dent body; and on their being fuch, the  
iftrength and firmnefs of the conftitutioii  
docs very much depend; whereas the  
eledlion or appointment of the councHk  
in the manner befiire mentioned, render!  
them altogether dependent on their eon-  
ftttuents. The king is the fountain df  
honour, and as fuch the peers of the  
realm derive their honours from him 3  
but then they hold them by a furer fe^  
nure than the provincial eounfellors wh6  
are appointed by mandamus. On thk  
othtT hand, our popular eledions very  
often ezpofb them to contempt; for no¬  
thing is more common, than for the r6&gt;  
prefentatives, when they find the council  
a little untraAable at the clofc of the  
ear, to remind them that May it al  
and.  
  
It may be accounted by the colonies lb  
dangerous to admit of any alterations Ih  
theS charters, as itts by the governenb  
in the church to make any in the efta-  
bbihmefit; yet, to make the refemblai^  
as near as may be to the Britifti parlra-  
ment, fome alteration ia/jccefiary-  
  
h is not requifitc that f know of f!iat  
acuunfellor fbould be a freeholder. Hit  
refidence, according to the charter, is a  
fufficieot qualification ; for that prqvides  
only, that he be an inhabitant of, cr pro¬  
prietor of lands, within the diftriA fer  
which he 18 chofen; whereas the pcc;5i  
of tnc realm fit in the houfe of lords, as  
I take it, in virtue of their baronies. .If  
there (hould be a reform of any of tVe  
colony charters, with a ^iew to keep np  
the refemblance of the three eft ate# in  
England, the legiftative council fitouid  
conftft of men or landed eftatei; but, ait  
onr landed eftates here are fmali at pre-  
jent, the value of rool. ftcHing per &lt;rw-  
/rum might, in feme of them at tesft, be  
a fofUcitnt qualificatioii. At pur eMdt  
are partible after the deccafe of the ptti-  
prictor, the Honour could not be conti¬  
nued io families as in Bngiaod ; it n d| Ht »  
  
The weekly MAGAZINE, on  
  
however, heconlinned in the appointed  
quamdiu bene fe and proof be  
  
required of fomc malpradice before a  
fufpcnfion or removal. Bankruptcy alfo  
might be another ground for removal.  
A fmall legifutive council might anfwer  
the purpofcb of government; but it  
might tend to weaken that levelling  
principle which is chcrilhed by the pre-  
fent popular conftitution, to have an ho¬  
norary order cdabiiflied, out of which  
thec&lt;»iincil rtumld be appointed. There  
no way now to put a man of fortune  
above the common level, and exempt  
him from being chofen by the people in¬  
to the lower offices, but his being ap¬  
pointed a jufticc of the peace; this is  
iVequently done when there is no kind  
of expectation of his undertaking the  
Iriift, and has its iuconveniencies. For  
icmedy hereof, it might he expedient to  
liave an order of patricians or efquires  
jnftituted, to be all men of fortune or  
po«&quot;»d landed eltatcs, and appointed by  
the governor, with the advice of council,  
and enrolled in the fccretary’s office, who  
lliould be exempted from the lower t)f-  
iices in government, as the juftices now  
are, and to have the legiflativc council  
(which, in the firft inflance, might be no¬  
minated by the crown) from time to  
time Hiled up, as vacancies happen, out  
of this order of men, who, if the order  
coniiiled only of men of landed edates.  
  
might eleCf as the Scottiffi peers do, on¬  
ly referving to the king&#x27;s governor a  
gative on luch choice.&#x27; The king, in this  
cafe, would be dill acknowledged as the  
fountain of honour, as having, in the firft  
indance, the appointment of the perfons  
enrolled, out of whom the council are to  
be choien, and finally having a negative  
on the choice; or the king might have  
the immediate appointment by manda¬  
mus, as at prefent in the royaj govern¬  
ments. As the gentlemen of the coun¬  
cil w’ould rank above the body from  
which they are taken, they might bear&quot;a  
title one degree above that of efquire  
Befides this legiflativc council, a pri»y&lt;  
council might be eftablifhed, to conlift of  
fomc or all of thofe perfons who condi*  
tate the legiflativc council, and of other  
perfons, members of the houfe of fcprc:  
fentatives, or other wife of ndlc or didinc-  
tion, which would extend the honours  
of government, and afford opportunity  
of didinguiihing men of character and  
reputation, the expedlatioii of which  
would make government more relped&#x27;  
able. , ^  
  
. I would not trouble you with thefe r?  
vcrics of mine, were I not affored of  
your readinefs to forgive the comm&#x27;unb  
cation, although you could apply it to  
no good purpule.

I have doubted whether this union could  
lie perfedled Sy the firft experiment.—  
I&#x27;he pUiu here exhibited, teems to be  
formed in generous and moderate prin¬  
ciples, and bids the faireft of any I have  
yet feen to be adopted. Such a great  
dcfign may, as in painting, require fre¬  
quent touching before it becomes a piece  
highly finidied; and after all, may re¬  
quire tile meliorating hand of time to  
make it pleafe univerfaily. Thus the  
Britilh contlitiuion, confidered as with¬  
out the colonies, attained its glory. The  
book I had fent me is in fnch rcqneft,  
that I have not been able to keep it long  
enough by me to conliib^r it in all its  
parts. I wifli to hear how it is received  
in the houfe of commons. 1 find by the  
publications both governor Pownall  
and Mr Bolian, that they each of them  
adopt the idea of an union and repre-  
lentalion, and I think it muft more and  
more prevail. The argument againft it  
from local inconveniency, muff, as it ap¬  
pears to me, be more than balanced, by  
greater inconveniencies on the other fide  
the queftion ; the great difficulty will be  
in the terms of union.—1 add no more,

account of the debates in parliament, on the firſt day of the  
  
  
ſome I doubt not with fear and trembling—Yet I have  
  
  
  
  
In your letter to the Lieutenant Governor, you obſerve.  
  
  
of the council, and the return of juries by the towns.  
The firſt of theſe ariſes trom the charter itſelf; the latter  
  
  
made ſufficient proviſion for the return of petit juries by  
  
their act of 23d Geo. 2d, which requires the ſeveral towns  
  
to take liſts of all perſons liable by law to ſerve, and form-  
  
ing them into two claſſes, put their names written on ſe-  
| parate  
  
E  
parate papers into two different boxes, one for the {Upcrior  
court, and the other tor the inferior: and when venires  
are iſtucd, the number therein required are to be 1  
out in open town-mecting, no perion to ſerve oftener tha  
once in three years.——1 he method of deb e  
juris appears indeed detective; but if the other is not, it  
may be imputed to the times rather than to the defect of  
the laws—that neither the grand juries nor che petit ju  
Ties have of late anſwered the EXPECLSUGNS of govein-  
ment. _  
As to the appointment of the chal; Lam of opinion  
that neither the popular clections in this province, nor  
their appointment in what are called the royal governments  
by the king&#x27;s mandamus, are tree from exccptions, elpe-  
cially if the council as a legiſlative body is intended to an-  
ter the idea of the Houſe of Lords in the Britiſh legifla-  
ture. There they are ſuppos&#x27;d to be a free and inde-  
  
  
firmneſs of the conſtitution does very much depend:  
whereas the election or appointment of the councils in the  
manner before mentioned renders them altogether depen-  
dent on their conſtituents. The king is the fountain of  
Honour, and as ſuch the pecrs of the realm derive their  
honours from him; but then they hold them by a ſurer te-  
rure than the provincial councellors. who are appointed by  
mandamus. On the other hand, our popular elections very  
often &lt;xpoſe them to contempt; for nothing is more com-  
mon, than for the repreſentatives, when they find the coun-  
ci! a little untractable at the cloſe of the years to remind  
them that May is at hand.  
  
It may be accounted by the colonies 2 dangerous to ad-  
mit of any alterations in their chartcrs, as it is by the go-  
vernors in the church tomake any in the eſtabliſhment ; vet  
to make the reſemblance as near as may be to the  
Britiſh parliament, ſome alicration is neceſſarr. ;  
  
.  
It is not requiſite, that I know of, that a counſellor  
| ſhould be a freeholder ; his reſidence according to the char-  
ter is a ſufficient qualification; for that provides only,  
that he be an inhabitani ot or proprietor of lands within  
| the diſtrict for which he is choſen: whereas the peers of  
9 515 the realm fit in the houſe of Lords, as I take it, in virtue  
of their haronies. If there ſhould be a reform of any of  
the colony charters, with a view to keep up the reſem- _  
| blance of the three eſtates in England, the legiſlative coun-  
cil ſhould conſiſt of men of landed eſtates; but as cur  
landed eſtates here are ſmall at preſent, the yearly value of  
. 100 ſterling per annum, might in ſome of them at leaſt  
be a ſufficient qualification. As our eſtates are partable  
after the deceaſe of the proprietor, the honour could not  
be continued in families as in England: It might however  
be continued in the appointee quam diu bene ſe geſſerit, and  
proof be required of ſome mal- practice before a ſuſpenſion  
or removal. Bankruptcy alſo might be another ground  
for removal. A ſmall legiſlative council might anſwer the  
_ purpoſes of government; but it might tend to weaken that  
| levelling principle, which is cheriſh&#x27;d by the preſent po-  
pular conſtitution, to have an honorary order eſtabliſh&#x27;d,  
out of which the council ſhould be appointed. There is  
no way now to put a man of fortune above the common  
level, and exempt him from being choten by the people into  
the lower offices, but his being appointed a Juſtice of the  
peace; this is frequently done, when there is no kind of  
| expeRation of his undertaking the truſt, and has its incon-  
| veniences. For remedy hereot it might be expedient to  
„„ OM an order of patricians or eſquires inſtituted, to be all  
| men of fortune or good landed eſtates, and appointed by the  
| Governor with the advice of council, and enroll&#x27;d in the  
: | Secretary&#x27;s office, who ſhou&#x27;d be exempted from the lower  
[ offices in government, as the juſtices now are; and to have  
the legiſlative council (which in the firſt inſtance might be  
nominated by the crown) from time to time fill d up, as va-  
D cancies  
  
( 26 }  
cancies hopes; out of this order of men, who, if the |  
order conſiſted only of men of landed eſtates, might elect  
  
as the Scottiſh peers do, only reſcrving to the King&#x27; s Go-  
vernor, à negative on ſuch choice. The King in this caſe  
  
  
ſons enroll&#x27;d, out of whom the council are to be choſen,  
and finally having a negative on the choice. Or, the  
be King might have the immediate appointment by mandamus,  
as at preſent in the royal governments. As the gentlemen  
of the council would rank above the body from which they  
ate taken, they might bear a title one degree above that of  
_ e{quire, Beſides this legiſlative council, a privy council  
might be eſtabliſh&#x27;d, to conſiſt of ſome or all of thoſe per-  
ſons who conſtitute the legiſlative council, and of other  
perſons members of the houſe of repreſentatives, or other- _  
wife of note or diſtinction; which wou&#x27;d extend the ho-  
nours of government, and afford opportunity of diſtin-  
guiſhing men of character and reputation, the —  
of which wou&#x27;d make government more reſpectable.  
I wou&#x27;d not trouble you with theſe reveries of mine,  
were I not aſſured of your readineſs to forgive the com-  
munication, although yUu could apply 1 it to no good pur-  
. poſe.  
  
Mr. Spooner ſent me a pamphlet De a blank cover,  
intituled, „“ the late of the nation.” I run over it by my-  
felt before 1 had heard any one mention it, and tho&#x27;t I  
cou&#x27;d evidently mark the ſentiments of ſome of my friends.  
  
By what I have ſince heard and ſeen, it looks as if I was  
not miſtaken. Your right honourable friend I truſt will  
not be offended if I call him mine—lI am ſure you will  
not when I term you ſuch—I have ſettled it for a long  
time in my own mind, that without a repreſentation in  
| the ſupreme legiſlature, there cannot be that union between  
  
the head and the members as to produce a healthful con-  
{itution of the whole body. I have doubted whether  
  
yes this  
  
By - IN  
this union could be perfected by the firſt experiment.  
The plan here exhibited ſeems to be formed in generous  
  
and moderate principles, and bids the fairelt of any I have  
vet ſeen to be adopted. Such a great deſign may, as in  
  
  
piece highly finiſh&#x27;d ; and after all, may require the me-  
  
  
attain&#x27;d it&#x27;s glory. The book I had ſent me is in ſuch  
  
  
preſentation, and I think it muſt more and more prevail.

Council as a legiſlative body is intended to anſwer

does very much depend: whereas the election or

tions of government.  
As to the appointment of the Council I am  
4 of opinion that neither the popular elections in  
this province, nor their appointment in what are  
called the royal governments by the King&#x27;s man-  
damus, are free from exceptions, eſpecially if the  
Couneil as a legiſlative body is intended to anſwer  
the idea of the Houſe: of Lords in the Britiſh  
  
  
free and independent body, and on their being  
ſuch, the ſtrength and firmneſs of the conſtitution  
does very much depend: whereas the election or  
appointment of the Councils in the manner be-  
fore mentioned renders them altogether depen-  
dent on their conftituents. The King is the  
fountain of honour, and as ſuch the peers of  
the realm derive their honours from him; but  
then they hold them by a ſurer tenure than the  
provincial Counſellors, who are appointed by  
mandamus. On the other hand, our popular  
elections very often expoſe them to contempt ;  
for nothing is more common, than for the repre-  
ſentatives, when they find the Council a little  
untractable at the cloſe of the year, to remind  
them that May is at t hand. i  
  
It may be accounted by the bene as .

It is not requiſite, that 1 know of, that a

according to the charter is a ſufficient qualifica-
