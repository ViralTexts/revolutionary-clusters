Dear President,   
State of New HampshirePortsmouth June 24th. 1808  
  
It is with heartfelt satisfaction that I have the honor to transmit to you herewith the Inclosed address and vote of of both Houses of the general Court.  
This Public approbation of the proceedings of the Executive of the United States, by the Legislature of this State give’s sincere pleasure to the friends of our Country. wishing you every temporal and spiritual blessing I pray you Sir to accept the homage of my greatest esteem and respect  
  
John Langdon   
  
  
Enclosure  
  
  
Sir—  
  
  
  
The Legislature of New Hampshire being assembled, and realizing that the present is to our Country a momentous period; and sensible that the bond of confederation which connects the Independent States of America, is strengthened by unanimity alone between the National Council, and the State Legislatures; and not ignorant that the present crisis in our national affairs, has excited the peccant humours that occasionally afflict the national system, and mar the fair aspect of our political institutions.  
Therefore we feel it incumbent on us as a duty to our Constituents, and to the Nation, to express our sentiments on the nature and tendency of certain measures of your administration. In retracing the progress of events, the necessary brevity of an address of this kind will preclude us from considering many important measures, and we shall be able to notice only, such features of the Republican Administration as will determine its Character—We recur in the first place to the period when you entered upon the duties of the Presidential office. Measures were immediately proposed, and adopted, to effect a reduction of the public expenditures. Oppressive laws which abridged the rights of the citizen, and imposed unnecessary and unequal taxes, were repealed. Useless offices were abolished, supernumerary officers dismissed, and thereby the imposing and dangerous influence of executive patronage, was done away. A system of Economy was established by which the nation soon felt relieved from the burden of an accumulating debt; and a new spring was furnished to commerce, to agriculture, and to all the subordinate instruments of National wealth and greatness—These Sir, were the salutary effects of the first moments of your administration, and they afforded a fair presage that your future endeavours would tend to the advancement of your Country’s glory.  
As we proceed we ought not to omit noticing the regard that has been shewn to our Indian Neighbours. Although they are comparatively weak, yet justice has been done them. Their best interests have been consulted, and under the fostering care of their “Great Father, many Tribes are advancing from a state of Barbarism to civilization.  
Our disputes with Spain relative to a place of deposit at New Orleans or on the Banks of the Missisippi, were happily settled by the purchase of Louisiana. This subject had originated many questions, not so much on the expediency of acquiring that territory, as in regard to the mode of acquisition—.  
Those who opposed the administration in almost all its measures urged, that New Orleans itself was worth a struggle, and that an attempt should be made to wrest it from Spain by force of arms.—But the friends of peace preferred and equitable purchase, to a contest that would have involved us in a war not with Spain only, but with France also and her dependencies. And this purchase of New Orleans, and the Territory of Louisiana, was made at a price far less that would have been required by the expences and sacrifices of one years war—The friends of the Country were aware that the heterogenous particles that composed the population of Louisiana might occasion some trouble, but less danger was ultimately to be apprehended from the people if assimilated with ourselves and under our protection, than if remaining the subjects of European Powers.  
By this acquisition it was foreseen that many advantages would result to commerce and in the event of a State of things (which from the injustice of European Powers does now unhappily exist) our means of bringing nations who might injure us to a Sense of Justice, without an appeal to arms were greatly enlarged in as much as hereby we can more effectually with hold those supplies without which they must suffer—The conspiracy of Aaron Burr engaged the attention of our Country, his objects were happily frustrated by the precaution of Government and the virtue of the people.—  
Notwithstanding the sanguinary conflicts in which the nations of Europe were engaged; and the unceasing endeavours of enemies without, and within, to involved us in a contest that agitated the world, the United States had hitherto maintained its peaceful position. At home the nation was employed in improving its internal policy; disencumbering itself from debt, providing wholesome laws and advancing the general happiness. And abroad our citizens were pursuing the fair objects of commerce. Towards the belligerent powers, a conduct strictly neutral and impartial had been observed by the Government of the United States. Against injuries it remonstrated in a tone of amity and forbearance. It asked for Justice! And not until its sovreignty was attacked, and the lives of its citizens wantonly sacrificed, did it raise its voice and demand reparation for the past and security for the future. The outrageous attack on the Chesapeak excited the sensibility of the nation and a general burst of indignation was heard—The Citizens of the United States pledged to you their property, their lives, and their sacred honor, that they would abide and uphold such measures as the Government should deem expedient for the maintenance of our rights, and the preservation of our dear bought priviledges. You Sir, still influenced by a sincere desire for peace with all nations, had issued a proclamation which for its dignified and moderate tone, was almost universally approved. You repressed the rising indignation of the Country, and dispatched a Messenger to England, and in due time convened Congress to deliberate on the critical State of the Nation. The great Council assembled at an important Juncture. The proclamation and orders of Council in Great Britain, and the decrees of France, were substantial evidence that the rights of neutrals were no longer to be respected, and the alternative was before us, either to submit to the exactions of Great Britain, and thereby be degraded almost to Colonial Subjection, or become a party in the War. In this dilemma a measure was proposed that in its consequences would require the exercise of much virtue, but which was the only measure that could be adopted to save our extensive commerce from the rapacious grasp of a piratical power; and our Seamen Citizens from insults, slavery, and death, a measure well calculated to evince to the world a firm resolution to maintain our national independence and sovreignty—The Embargo Acts with the approbation of a large majority of the Representatives of the Nation Assembled in Congress have become the laws of the land—We Sir, also approve them as the only means that could be devised to preserve our peace and safety—We will suffer any privation, rather than submit to degradation, and will cooperate with the General Government in all its measures—By the goodness of God our Country is abundantly supplied with the comforts, and conveniences of life: should we murmur and repine whilst in possession of blessings and priviledges, for which the Inhabitants of other parts of the world sigh in vain, we should prove ourselves an ungrateful and wicked people.  
Your presidential term will soon expire, and you decline a reelection to Office—The reason you assign for this determination are consistent with the pure principles which have formed the rule of your conduct. In retirement you will not be indifferent to the welfare of your Country; and your Country will remember with grateful feelings the Patriot who devoted a long life to the cause of liberty. That your last days may be your best days, your last comforts your sweetest comforts; and on your exit from this world that you may received the plaudit of God, is Sir, the wish and prayer of the people of New Hampshire—

. THE Legislature of ‘New-Hampfhire  
being assembled, and realizing that the pre­  
-I€nt, 1s to our country a momentous period ;  
and, fenfinle, that thg band of confederation  
which connes the” Independent States of  
America is strengthened by unanimity alone  
between the National Council and the State  
Legislatures ; And, not ignoradt, that the  
present crisis in odr Natiodal affairs, has  
excited the peccant humours that oceafion­  
ally afflict the national fyftém, and mar the  
fair afpe@ -of ‘our pdlitical inlithitions—=  
Therefore, we F:et it incumbent oa us as a  
duty to our conflituents, und to the ndtion,  
t¢ exprels our fentinrents on the natiire and  
tendeacy of certain mecalures of- your aclo&#x27;  
miniftratioa. - : : :  
Ia retracing tlie progress of events, the  
necessary brevity of an address of this kind,  
¥rill preclude us from coufidering maay im­  
portant measures, and we flialk be able td  
notice, oaly, such features of the Republi­  
can Administration, as will dctermine its  
chara®er. SSE  
We recur, in the firft place, to the petiod  
when you entered upoun the duties of the  
Presidential office. . Mcafures were imme­  
diately proposed, and adopted, to effet. a  
reduction of the public expenditures. Op­  
preflive laws wiich abridged the rights of  
the citizen, and imposed uancceilary and uns’  
cual taxee, were repealed. Ulelels offices  
were abolithed, {upernumerary officers dil­  
miffed, and thereby the imposing and dan­  
gerous influence of Executive patronage was  
done away. A system of economy was ef­  
tablithed, by which the nation soon felt re­  
lieved from the burden of an accumulating  
debr ; and 2 new spring was furnifhed to;  
commerce, to agrictlture, and te all the {ub­  
ordinate instruments of natiohal wealth and  
greatness.—These fir, were the salutary ef­  
fects of. the firlt moments of your adminif­  
tration} and they afforded a fair presage that  
your future endeavors would tend to the  
advancement of your tountries glory.  
As we, proceed, we otight not td oniit  
noticing the regard that hes been thown o  
our Indian neighbours. Although they are  
comparatively weak, yot justice has been  
done them. Their belt interests have been  
consulted, and under the fofteting care of  
their * Great Father” many tribes are ad­  
vancing from a state of barbarism to  
civilization. :  
Our disputes with Spaig relative to a place  
of deposit at New Orleans, or on the banks  
of the Miflifippi, were happily fettled by the,  
purchase of Louiftana. This f{ubje&amp;t had  
originated many questions, not {0 much en  
the expediency of acquiring that territory,  
as, in regard to the mode of acquisition.  
Thole whe appofled the administration in  
almost all its mecafures, urged, that New-  
Orleans itfelf was worth a {truggle, and that  
an attempt fhouid be made to wrest it from  
Spain by force of arms. Bat the friends of  
peace, preferred an, equitable purchase to a  
contest that would have iavolved usin a war,  
not with Spain only, but with France also,  
and her dependencies. . And this purchule  
of New Oreans and the territory of Louisi­  
ana was made at a price far iefs than worid  
have been requifed’ by the expences and  
facrifices of one years war, The friends -of  
the country were aware that the heterogenea  
ous partictes that composed the population  
of Louisiana might occasion some trouble,  
but less danger was ultimately to be appre-’  
hended from that people,if aflimilated with  
ourselves, and under our prote&amp;ion, than if  
remaining the subjects of European powers.  
By this acquisition it was forfeen, that many  
advantages would refuit to commercee ; and  
in the event of a state of things (which ftom  
the injultice of Etiropean powers, does now  
unhappily exist) our means of bringing  
nations who might- injure us, to a sense of  
justice, without an” appeal to arms, were.  
greatly enlarged, inasmuch as, hercby, we  
can more cffetually withheld those supplies,  
without which, they must fuffer.  
The Cénfpiracy of Aaron Burr, engaged  
the attention of our Country. His objects  
were happi&#x27;y froftrated by the precaution of  
Government, and the virtue of the People. -  
Notwith{tandiag the fanguigary coaflicts  
in whith the-Natiens of Eutope were engag­  
ed ; and the unceasing endeavor of Enemies”  
without and within,; to involve us in™a con­  
“teft that agitated tfic world i the United  
States had hitherto. ma&#x27;mtaia&#x27;ehi Pea-scful;  
position. = At home, the Nation was employ­  
ed in improving its internal policy ; difcn­  
cumbering itfelf from debt; providing  
-wholesome laws&#x27;; ahd advancing the geaer­  
~al&#x27;happinefs. And abroad, our cutizéns weré  
urfuing the fair objeéts of commerce. To­  
%‘d‘!_dt the Pelligercnt powers, 2 conduct  
strictly newtral, and ifhpartial, had been ob­  
fcrved by the) Government of the Uniigd  
States. Against injurics it remonstrated in.  
a tone of amity apd forbgarance, It asked  
for justice! and not, until its fovercigaty  
was attacked, and the ligc‘;foﬁ its citizens  
- wantonly lacrificed, did it raise its voice and  
‘flemand reparatibn for the past, and feciiri­  
ty for the futare. The outrageots attick  
on the Chesapeake excited the fenfibitity of  
the nation, dnd 2 _]ggn:rﬂ&#x27;bnrﬂf of indigna­  
. ng; was hedid. . The citizens of the ,pred‘-  
States pledged to yoa &#x27; their property, their

would abide, and uphotd \t\q‘é%&amp;_\gafum ‘as

You Bir, still mﬂnenﬂdm sincere desire  
for peace with all nations, had issued a proc­  
12mation which; for its dignified, and mod­  
_erate tone. was almof(t universally approved ;.

cuts, and to the nation, to express ;  
our sentiments on the nature and ten- &#x27; 1  
dency of certain measures of your ad- &#x27;. &lt;  
ministration. 1 ■  
In retracing the progress of events, &#x27; ]  
the necessary brevity of an address,*  
of this kind will preclude us from j i  
considering many important meu- \ ;  
sures, and vve shall be able to notice, ! &#x27;  
only, such features of the republican : I  
administration, as will determine its \ I  
character. i  
We recur, in the first place, to •  
the period when you entered upon i  
the duties of the Presidential office, j  
Measures were immediately pro- &#x27;  
posed, and adopted, to effect a re- j  
duction of the public expenditures. &#x27;  
Oppressive laws which abridged the  
rights of the citizen, and imposed i  
unnecessary and unequal taxes, were  
repealed. Useless offices were a­  
boiished,supernumerary officers dis- &lt;  
missed, and thereby the imposing  
and dangerous influence of executive  
patronage was done away. A system &lt;  
of economy was established by v\ i.h h i  
the nation soon felt relieved from  
the burden of an accumulating debt ; i  
and a new spring was furnished to i  
ccmmcrcc, to agriculture, and to all i  
the subordinate instruments of national &#x27;  
wealth and greatness. These, sir,  
were the salutary effects of the first &#x27;  
moments of your administration, and ,  
they afforded a fair presage that J I  
your future endeavors would tend to &lt;  
the advancement of your country&#x27;s \&#x27;•  
glory. i  
t As we proceed, we ought not to «  
omit noticing the regard that has ) 1  
been Bliewfl to our Indian neighbors. ;&#x27;&lt;  
Altho&#x27; they are comparatively weak, ! &#x27;  
vet justice has been done them, j 1  
Their host imere&#x27;sls have been con-: &lt;  
suited, am! under Ihe fostering care ! &#x27;-■  
of their &quot; Qreat Father,&quot; many v  
arc advancing from a state of barhamm &#x27;  
to civilization. c  
Our disputes with Spain relative J  
to a place of deposit at New Or- &lt;  
leans, or on the banks of the Mis- &lt;  
pi, were happily settled by. the f  
purchase of Louisiana. This subject I 1  
had originated many question*, m t so j i  
much on the expediency r.f acquit  
that territory,as in regard tube n  
juisition. Those who opposed the | &#x27;  
administration, in almost all its mea- i (  
. urged tiiat N. Orleans itself was &#x27; i  
worth a struggle, and that an attempt  
should b« to wrest it from (  
Spain by force °f arms. But the (

“ The Proclamation and Orders of Great­  
Britain and the decree of France were sub­  
stantial evidence that the rights of neutrals  
were no longer to be respected; and the al­  
ternative was before us, either to submit to  
the exactions of G. Britain, and thereby be  
degraded almost to colonial subjection, or be­  
come a party in the war.  
In this dilemma a measure was proposed,  
that its consequences would require the ex­  
ercise of much virtue, but which was the  
only measure that could be adopted to save  
our extensive commerce from *he renacicus  
grasp of a piratical power, and our seamen  
citizens from insults, slavery and death. A  
measure well calculated to evince to the  
world a firm resolution to maintain our na­  
tional independence and sovereignty. The  
Embargo acts, with the-approbation of a  
large majority of the renresentativos of thg  
nation assembled in congress, have become  
the laws of the land. We sir, also approve  
them, as the only means that could bo de­  
vised to preserve our peace and safety. We  
will suffer any privations rather than sub­  
mit to degradation, and will co &lt; pe ate w th  
the general government in all its measures.  
*• By the goodness of God our country is  
abundantly supplied with the comforts and  
conveniences of life. Should we murmur,  
and tepine, whilst in possession ot blessings  
and privileges, for which the inhabitants of  
other parts of the world sigh in vain; we  
should prove ourselves an ungreatful, and  
wicked people.”  
“Your presidential term will soon expire,  
and you decline a re-election to office—  
The reasons you assign for your determina­  
tion, are consitcnt with the pure principles  
which have formed the rule of your conduct.  
In retirement you *viil not he indifferent to  
the welfare of your country ; and your  
country wiii remember with grateful feel­  
ings the patriot who devoted a long life to  
the cause of liberty. That your last days,  
may he your l&gt;est day* ; and your last com­  
forts, your sweetest comforts; and on your  
exit from this world, that you may receive  
tiie plaudit of God, is sir, the wish, and
