Montpellier Feby. 23. 1820  
  
I received yours of the 19th. on Monday. Genl. Brown, who returned from Monticello on that evening, has been since with me, till 10 OClock today. Your letter found me indisposed from exposure to a cold wind without due precaution; and I have continued so. I write now with a fever on me. These circumstances will account for both the delay &amp; the brevity in complying with your request.  
The pinch of the difficulty, in the case stated, seems to be in the words “for ever,” coupled with the interdict relating to the Territory North of Lat: 36°. 30.°° If the necessary import of these words be, that they are to operate as a condition on future States admitted into the Union, and as a restriction on them after admission, they seem to encounter, indirectly, the arguments which prevailed in the Senate for an unconditional admission of Missouri. I must conclude therefore from the assent of the Senate to the words, after the strong vote, on constitutional grounds, against the restriction on Missouri, that there is some other mode of explaining them in their actual application.  
As to the right of Congs. to apply such a restriction during the Territorial periods, it depends on the clause specially providing for the management of those subordinate Establishments.  
On one side, it naturally occurs that the right, being given from the necessity of the case, and in suspension of the great principle of self-Govt; ought not to be extended farther, nor continued longer, than the occasion might fairly require.  
  
On the other side, it cannot be denied, that the Constitutional phrase “to make all rules &amp;c.” as expounded by uniform practice, is somewhat of a ductile nature, and leaves much to Legislative discretion.  
The questions to be decided seem to be 1. whether a territorial restriction, be an assumption of illegimate power, or, 2. a misuse of legitimate power: and if the latter only, whether the injury threatened to the nation from an acquiescence in the misuse, or from a frustration of it, be the greater. On the 1st. point there is certainly room for difference of opinion; tho’ for myself I must own that I have always leaned to the belief that the restriction was not within the true scope of the constitution. On the alternative presented by the 2d. point, there can be no room with the cool &amp; candid, for blame on those, acquiescing in a conciliatory course; the demand for which was deemed urgent, and the course itself deemed not irreconcileable with the Constitution.  
This is the hasty view I have taken of the subject. I am aware that it may be suspected of being influenced by the habit of a guarded construction of Constitutional Powers. And I have certainly felt all the influence that could justly flow from a conviction, that an uncontrouled dispersion of the slaves, now within the U. S., was not only best for the nation, but most favorable for the slaves also, both as to their prospects of emancipation, and as to their condition in the mean time.  
The inflammatory conduct of Mr. K. surprizes every one. His general warfare agst. the slaveholding States, and his efforts to disparage the securities derived from the Constitution, were least of all to have been looked for. I have noticed less of recurrence to cotemporary expositions of the Charter, than was to have been expected from the zeal &amp; industry of the Champions in debate. The proceedings of the Virga. Convention have been well sifted: But those of other States ought not to have been overlooked. The Speeches of Mr. King in Massts. &amp; of Mr. Hamilton in N. York shew the ground on which they vindicated, particularly, the compound rule of Representation in Congs. And doubtless there are many other evidences of the way of thinking then prevalent, on that &amp; other articles, equally the result of a sense of equity, and a spirit of mutual concession.

to pinch of the difficulty in the case stated, seems to be in  
9 words &quot; for ever,&quot; coupled with the interdict relating to  
) territory north of latitude 36 deg. 30 min. If the neceary  
import of these words be, that they are to operate as a ,  
ndition on future States admitted into the Union, and as a  
itriction on them after admission, they seem to encounter,  
lircclly, the argumenla which prevailed in the Senate for  
unconditional admission of Missouri. 1 must conclude,  
trcfore, from the assent of the Senaie to the words, after  
i strong vote, on constitutional grounds, against the rciclion  
on Missouri, that there is some other mode of cxlining

On one side it naturally occurs, that the right, being given  
m the necessity ol the case, and in suspension of the great

On the first point, there is certainly room for difference of  
inion , though, for myself, I must own that I have always

ic acope of the constitution.  
  
On the alternative preeented by the second point, there Th  
can be no room, with the cool and candid, for blame on those Spi  
acquiescing in a conciliatory course, the demand for which wit

, that this thing of restricting tne  
emigration of slaves in the United States into the Ter­  
ritories was a notion at that time not at all entertained, or  
even thought of. In all the exciting and protracted de­  
bates on the slavery question, in that illustrious body, it  
does not appear that there was ever a whisper even to  
indicate that it was the intention or idea of any member  
of the convention that the emigration or transpor­  
tation of slavery from one portion of the Union to another  
  
should be prohibited.  
Here is what Mr. Madison says on this subject, in his  
letter to Mr. Monroe, in 1820:  
&quot;The questions to be decided seem to be?  
&quot;1. Whether 4 territorial restriction be nn msumption of  
illegitimate power.&quot;; or,

Montpkmer, February 23, 1820.  
I received yours of the 10th on Monday. The pinch of  
the difficulty in the case stated seems to be in the wordi  
&quot; for ever,&quot; coupled with ihe interdict relating to the tec  
i ri lory north of latitude 3d deg. 30 inin. If the uecewarj  
import of these words be that they are to operate as a  
condition on future States admitted into the Union, and as a  
restriction on them after admission, they seem to encounter,  
indirectly, the arguments which prevailed in the Senate  
for an unconditional admissiou of Missouri. I must  
conclude, therefore, from the assent of the Senate to the  
words, after the strong vote, on coDStitut&#x27;onal ground.&quot;,  
against the restriction on Missouri, that there is tome other  
mode of explaining them in their actual application.  
As to the right of Congress to apply such a restriction  
during the territorial period, It depends on the clause specially  
providing for the management of those subordinate  
establishments.  
On one side, it naturally occurs that the right, being  
given from the necessity of the case, and in suspension of  
the great principle of self-government, ought not to been  
tended further, nor continued longer, than the occasion  
might fairly require.  
On the ether side, it cannot be denied that the constitutional  
phrase &#x27;&#x27;to make all rules,&quot; Ac., as expounded bp  
uniform practice, is somewhat of a ductile nature, and  
leaves much to legislative discretion.  
The questions to be decided seem to be?  
1. Whether a territorial restriction be an assumption of  
illegitimate {rower; or,  
  
i. misuse or legitimate power; aiiu, 11 me laiier odit,  
whether the injury threatened to the nation from an acquiescence  
iu the misuse, or from a frustration of it, be the  
greater.  
On the first point there is certainly room for different  
of opinion ; though, for myself, I must own that I haettltcay*  
leaned to the belief thai the restriction was not withintk  
true scope of the constitution.  
On the alternative presented by the second point, thin  
can be no room, with the cool and candid, for blame on  
those acquiescing in a conciliatory course, the demand for  
which was deemed urgent, and the course itself deemed not  
irreconcilable with the constitution.  
This is the hasty view 1 have taken of the subject I  
am aware that I may be suspected of being influenced bj the  
habit of a guarded construction of constitutional powers:  
and 1 have certainly felt all the influence that could jnitly  
flow from a conviction that an uncontrolled dispersion if  
the slaves now within the United States was not only best for  
the nation, but most favorable for the slaves also, both as it  
their prospects of emancipation and as to their condition is lb*  
mean time.

uu&gt;* specially providing for the management of those j
