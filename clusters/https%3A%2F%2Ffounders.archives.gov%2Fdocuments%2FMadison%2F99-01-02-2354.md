s of the British Measure.  
					Its great Feature is the Establishment, by the sole operation of an Order of Council, an unexampled Blockade, not existing, or pretended to, exist in Fact, of all the Ports &amp; Places of France &amp; her Allies and all other Countries at War with His  
						Majesty; of all other Ports &amp; Places in Europe from which the British Flag is excluded; and of all Ports and Places in the Colonies belonging to His Majesty’s Enemies. It does more than this however. The first order declares &quot;that all Trade in articles of the produce or  
						Manufacture of the said Countries or Colonies shall be deemed unlawful &amp;c&quot;.  
					Upon those two Provisions, connected with that which relates to Certificates of origin, the Measure relies for its whole Efficacy. The rest is but gratuitous Exception &amp; Qualification, which may at any Time be withdrawn.  
					In the Preamble to the first order we are in Substance referred, for the Inducements to this Measure, to the French Decree of Nove

t Paris was accordingly among the first to demand of the Minister of Marine (who was charged in what concerned his Department with the Execution of it) &quot;the official Explanation which may have been given to this Decree so far as it involves the  
						Rights of neutral Nations.&quot; The answer was prompt &amp; explicit.  
					Here I read General Armstrong’s Letter of the 10th. of December last to the French Minister of Marine, and the Reply of that Minister of the 24th. of the same Month, as communicated by the President to Congress in February 1807. I relied particularly on the  
						following Passages in that Reply.  
					&quot;I consider the Imperial Decree of the 21st. of November last as thus far conveying no Modification of the Regulations at present observed in France with regard to Neutral Navigators, nor consequently &amp;c&quot;  
					&quot;That the Declaration expressed by the first Article not at all changing the present French Laws concerning Maritime Capture &amp;c&quot;  
					&quot;That an American Vessel cannot be taken at Sea for the mere Reason that she is going to a Port of England, or is returning from one; because conformably with the 7th. Article we are limited &amp;c&quot;  
					&quot;That the Provisions of Articles 2d. &amp; 5h. naturally apply to Foreign Citizens domiciliated in France &amp;c.&quot;
