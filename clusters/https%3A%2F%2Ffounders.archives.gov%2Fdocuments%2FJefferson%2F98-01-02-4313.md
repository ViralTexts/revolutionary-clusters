ear and Venerable Sir.  
Monticello in Virginia.  
June 5. 24.  
I am much indebted for your kind letter of Feb. 29. and for your valuable volume on the English constitution. I have read this with pleasure, and much approbation, and think it has deduced the constitution of the English nation from it’s rightful root, the Anglo-Saxon. it is really wonderful that so many able and learned men should have failed in their attempts to define it with correctness. no wonder then that Paine, who thought more than he read, should have credited the great authorities who have declared that the will of parliament is the Constitution of England. so Marbois, before the French revolution, observed to me, that the Almanac Royal, was the  Constitution of France.Your derivation of it from the Anglo-Saxons seems to be made on legitimate principles. having driven out the former inhabitants of that part of the island, called England, they became Aborigines as to you, and your lineal Ancestors. they doubtless had a constitution; and altho’ they have not left it in a written formula, to the precise text of which you may always appeal, yet they have left fragments of their history and laws from which it may be inferred with considerable certainty. whatever their history and laws shew to have been practised with approbation, we may presume was permitted by their constitution whatever was not so practised, was not permitted. and altho’ this constitution was violated and set at nought by Norman force, yet force cannot change right. a perpetual claim was kept up by the nation by their perpetual demand of a restoration of their Saxon laws; which shews they were never relinquished by the will of nation. in the pullings and haulings for these antient rights between the nation and it’s kings of the races of Plantagenets, Tudors &amp; Stuarts, there was sometimes gain, and sometimes loss, until the final reconquest of their rights  from the Stuarts. the destitution and expulsion of this race broke the thread of pretended inheritance extinguished all regal usurpations, and the nation re-entered into all it’s rights; and altho’ in their bill of rights they specifically reclaimed some only, yet the omission of the others was no renunciation of the right to assume their exercise also, whenever occasions should occur the new king recieved no rights or powers but those expressly granted to him. it has ever appeared to me that the difference between the whig and tory of England is, that the whig deduces his rights from the A-Saxon source, and the tory from the Norman. and Hume, the great Apostle of toryism, says, in so many words, Note AA. to Chapter 42. that, in the reigns of the Stuarts, ‘it was the people who encroached upon the sovereign. not the sovereign who attempted, as is pretended, to usurp upon the people.’ this supposes the Norman usurpations to be rights in his successors. and again C.59. ‘the Commons established a principle, which is noble in itself and seems specious, but is belied by all history and experience, that the people are the origin of all just power.’ and where else will this degenerate son of science, this traytor to his fellow-men, find the origin of just powers, if not in the Majority of the society? will it be in the Minority? or in an individual of that minority?Our revolution commenced on more favorable ground. it presented us an Album on which we were free to write what we pleased. we had no occasion to search into musty records, to hunt up Royal parchments, or to investigate the laws &amp; institutions of a semi-barbarous ancestry. we appealed to those of nature, and found them engraved in our   hearts. yet we did not avail ourselves of all the advantages of our position. we had never been permitted to exercise self-government. when forced to assume it, we were Novices in it’s science. it’s principles and forms had entered little into our former education. we established however some, altho’ not all it’s important principles. the constitutions of most of our states assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves, in all cases to which they think themselves competent, (as in electing their functionaries executive and legislative, and deciding by a jury of themselves, both fact and law, in all judiciary cases in which any fact is involved) or they may act by representatives, freely and equally chosen; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed; that they are entitled to freedom of person; freedom of religion; freedom of property; and freedom of the press. in the structure of our legislatures we think experience has proved the benefit of subjecting questions to two separate bodies of deliberants; but in constituting these, natural right has been mistaken, some making one of these bodies, and some both, the representatives of property instead of persons; whereas the double deliberation might be as well obtained without any violation of true principle, either by requiring a greater age in one of the bodies, or by electing a proper number of representatives of persons, dividing them by lots into two chambers, and renewing the division at frequent intervals, in order to break up all Cabals. Virginia, of which I am myself a native and resident, was not only the first of the states, but I believe I may say, the first of the nations of the earth, which assembled it’s wise men peaceably together to form a fundamental constitution, to commit it to writing, and place it among their archives, where every one should be free to appeal to it’s text. but this act was very imperfect. the other states, as they proceeded successively to the same work, made successive improvements; and several of them, still further corrected by experience, have, by conventions, still further amended their first forms. my own state has gone on so far with it’s premiere ebauche; but it is now proposing to call a convention for amendment. among other improvements, I hope they will adopt the subdivision of our counties into wards. the former may be estimated at an average of 24. miles square; the latter should be about 6. miles square each; and would answer to the Hundreds of your Saxon Alfred. in each of these might be 1. an Elementary school. 2. a company of militia, with it’s officers. 3. a justice of the peace and constable. 4. each Ward should take care of their own poor. 5. their own roads. 6. their own police. 7. elect within themselves one or more jurors to attend the courts of justice. and 8. give in, at their Folk-house, their votes for all functionaries reserved to their election. each Ward would thus be a small republic within  itself, and every man in the state would thus become an acting member of the common government, transacting in person a great portion of it’s  rights and duties, subordinate indeed, yet important, and entirely within his competence. the wit of men cannot devise a more solid basis for a free, durable and well administered republic.With respect to our state and federal governments, I do not think their relations correctly understood by foreigners. they generally suppose the former subordinate to the latter. but this is not the case. they are co ordinate departments of one simple, and integral whole. to the State governments are reserved all legislation and administration in affairs which concern their own citizens only, and to the federal government is given whatever concerns foreigners, or the citizens of other states; these functions alone being made federal. the one is the domestic the other the foreign branch of the same government; neither having controul over the other, but within it’s own department. there are one or two exceptions only to this partition of power. but, you may ask, if the two departments should claim each the same subject of power, where is the common umpire to decide ultimately between them? in cases of little importance or urgency, the prudence of both parties will keep them aloof from the questionable ground: but if it can neither be avoided nor compromised, a Convention of the states must be called to ascribe the doubtful power to that department which they may think best. you will percieve by these details that we have not yet so far perfected our constitutions as to venture to make them unchangeable. but still, in their present state, we consider them not otherwise changeable than by the authority of the people, on a special election of representatives for that purpose expressly: they are until than the Lex legum.But can they be made unchangeable? can one generation bind another, and all others, in succession for ever? I think not. the Creator has made the earth for the living, not the dead. rights and powers can only belong to persons, not to things,  not to mere matter, unendowed with will. the dead are not even things. the particles of matter which composed their bodies, make part now of the bodies of other animals, vegetables, or minerals of a thousand forms. to what then are attached the rights and power they held while in the form of men? a generation may bind itself, as long as it’s majority continues in life; when that has disappeared, another majority is in place, holds all the rights and powers  their predecessors once held and may change their laws and institutions to suit themselves. nothing then is unchangeable but the inherent and unalienable rights of man.I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the Judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions that Christianity is a part of the Common law. the proof of the contrary which you have adduced is incontrovertible, to wit, that the Common law existed, while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed. but it may amuse you to shew when, and by what means they stole this law in upon us. in a case of Quare impedit in the year-book 24. H. 6. folio. 38. [anno 1458.] a question was made, how far the Ecclesiastical law was to be respected in a common law court? and Prisot C. S. gives his opinion in these words, ‘a tiel leis que ils de seint eglise ont en ancient scripture, covient à nous à donner credence; car ceo Common ley sur quels touts manners leis sont fondés. et auxy, Sir, nous sumus obligés de conustre lour ley de saint eglise: et semblablement ils sont obligés de conustre nostre ley. et, Sir, si poit apperer or á nous que l’evesque ad fait come un Ordinary fera en tiel cas, adong nous devons ceo adjuger bon, ou auterment nemy.’ Etc see S. C. Fitzh. abr. Qu. imp. 89. Bro. abr. Qu. imp. 12. Finch in his 1st B.c. 3. is the first afterwards who quotes this case, and mistakes it thus ‘to such laws of the church as have warrant in holy scripture, our law giveth credence.’ and cites Prisot, mistranslating ‘ancien scripture’ into ‘holy scripture’ whereas Prisot palpably says ‘to such laws as those of holy church have in antient writing it is proper for us to give credence.’ to wit, to their antient written laws. this was in 1613, a century and a half after the dictum of Prisot. Wingate in 1658. erects this false translation into a Maxim of the Common law, copying the words of Finch, but citing Prisot. Wing. Max. 3. and Sheppard, tit. ‘Religion’ in 1675. copies the same mistranslation, quoting the Y. B. Finch and Wingate. Hale expresses it in these words, ‘Christianity is parcel of the laws of England.’ 1. Ventr. 293. 3. Keb. 607. but quotes no authority. by these echoings and re-echoings from one to another, it had become so established in 1728. that in the case of the King v. Woolston. 2. Stra. 834. the court would not suffer it to be debated whether to write against Christianity was punishable in the temporal courts at Common law? Wood therefore 409. ventures still to vary the phrase, and says that ‘all blasphemy and profaneness are offences by the common law,’ and cites 2. Stra. then Blackstone, in 1763. IV. 59. repeats the words of Hale that ‘Christianity is part of the laws of England,’ citing Ventris and Strange. and finally, Ld Mansfield, with a little qualification, in Evans’s case, in 1767. says that ‘the essential principles of revealed religion are part of the Common law.’ thus ingulphing Bible, Testament and all into the Common law, without citing any authority. and thus we find this  chain of authorities hanging, link by link, one upon another, and all ultimately on one and the same hook, and that a mistranslation of the words ‘ancien scripture,’ used by Prisot. Finch quotes Prisot; Wingate does the same. Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch and Wingate. Hale cites nobody. the court, in Woolston’s case, cite Hale. Wood cites Woolston’s case. Blackstone quotes Woolston’s case and Hale. and Ld Mansfield, like Hale, ventures it on his own authority. here I might defy the best read lawyer to produce another scrip of authority for this judiciary forgery; and I might go on further to shew how some of the A-Saxon priests interpolated into the text of Alfred’s laws the 20th 21st 22d and 23d chapters of Exodus, and the 15th of the acts of the Apostles, from the 23d to the 29th verses. but this would lead my pen and your patience too far. what a conspiracy this, between Church and State! sing Tantarara, rogues all, rogues all, Sing Tantararara rogues all!I must still add to this long and rambling letter my acknolegements for your good wishes to the University we are now establishing in this state. there are some novelties in it. of that of a professorship of the principles of government you express your approbation. they will be founded in the rights of man. that of Agriculture I am sure you will approve. and that also of Anglo-Saxon. as the histories and laws left us, in that type and  dialect, must be the text books of the reading of the learners, they will imbibe, with the language, their free principles of government. the volumes you have been so kind as to send, shall be placed in the library of the University. having at this time in England a person, sent for the purpose of selecting some Professors, a mr Gilmer of my neighborhood, I cannot but recommend him to your patronage, counsel, and guardanship against imposition, misinformation, and the deceptions of partial and false recommendations, in the selection of characters. he is a gentleman of great worth and correctness, my particular friend, well educated in various branches of science, &amp; worthy of entire confidence.Your age of 84. and mine of 81. years ensure us a speedy meeting. we may then commune at leisure, and more fully, on the good and evil which, in the course of our long lives, we have both witnessed; and in the mean time, I pray you to accept assurances of my high veneration and esteem for your person and character.Th: Jefferso

length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative power; for  
such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that  
Christianity is a part of the common law.. The proof of the  
contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to  
wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons  
were yet Pagans; at a time when they had never yet heard  
thename of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a charac-  
terhad ever existed. But it may amnse you to show, wheh,  
and by what means, they stole this law in uponus. Ina  
case of Quare Impedit, in the year book, 34 Henry VI, fo.  
8, [1458] a question was made how far the ecclesiastical law  
was to be respected in a Common Law Court? and Prisot  
C.1., gave his opinion in these words: 4 tiel leis que ils de  
saint eglise ont en ancien scripture,-covient 4 nous 4 donner  
credence; car ceo Common Ley sur quels touts manners

Monticello, in Virginia, June 5, 1824. v  
{iDeur and Venerable Sir.—I am much indebt­  
ed for your kind letter of Feb 39, and for your  
valuable volume on the English constitution. 1  
have read this with pleasure and much appro­  
bation, and I think it has deduced the constitu­  
tion inherited hy the English nation, from its  
rightful root, the Anglo Saxon. It is really  
wonderful that so many able men should have  
failed in their attempts to define it with cor­  
rectness; no wonder then that Paine, who  
thought more than be read, should have credit­  
ed the great authorities who have declared, that  
the Will of Parliament is the Constitution of  
England. So Marbois, before the French Rev­  
olution, observed tome, that the Almanac Roy­  
al was the constitution of France. Your deri­  
vation of it from the Anglo-Saxons, seems to  
be made on legitimate principles. Having  
driven out the former inhabitants of that part  
of the island called England, they became, as to  
you, Aborigines, and your lineal ancestors, they  
doubtless had a constitution, and although they  
have not left it in a written formula, to the pre­  
cise text of which you may always appeal, yet  
they have left fiagments of their history and  
laws,from which it may be inferred, with con­  
siderable certainty. Whatever their history 8c  
laws shew to have been practised with approba­  
tion, we may presume was permittexl by their  
constitution, whatever was not so practised, vyas  
not permitted, and although this constitution  
was violated, and set at nought by Norman  
force, yet force cannot change right; a perpetu­  
al claim w as kept up by the Nation in their per­  
petual demand of the restoration of their Sax­  
on laws, which shews they never were relin­  
quished by the will of the nation. In the pul­  
  
lings and huuhngs tur these ancient rights, ne­  
xween the nation, ami its kings ol the .races of  
Plaiitagenets, Tudors, and Stuarts, there was  
sometimes gain and sometimes loss, until the  
final reconquest of their rights from the Stu­  
arv broke the thread of pretended inheritance,  
extinguished all regal usurpations, and the na­  
tion re-entered into all Its rights; and although  
in their bill ol tights they specifically reclaim  
some onlv, yet the omission ol others was no  
renunciation of the right k&gt; assume their exer­  
cise, also, whenever occasions should occur.—  
The new king received no rights or powers but  
those expressly granted to him. It has ever  
appeared to me that the difference between the  
whig and the torvol England is,that the whig  
deduces his rights from the Anglo-Saxon source,  
the tory from the Norman; and Hume, the great  
apostle of toryism says, in so many words,  
(note aa to chap 42, that in the reigns of the  
Stuarts, it was the people who tncrroached up­  
on the sovereign, not the sovereign who at­  
tempted, as is pretended, to usurp upon the  
people; this supposes the Norman usurpations  
to be rights in his successors; and again, (c. 59)  
“the commons established a principle, which is  
noble in itself, and seams specious, but is be­  
lieved by all history and experience, that the  
people are the origin of all JUSTpomr\ and where  
else will this degenerate son of sience, thip trait­  
or to his fellow-men, find the origin of Just  
powei,if not in the majority of the Society?  
Will it be in the minority, or in an individual  
of that minority?  
“Our revolution commenced on more favour­  
able ground. It presented us an Album, on  
which we were free to write what we pleased;  
we had no occasion to seaich into musty re­  
cords, to hunt up royal parchments, or to in­  
vestigate the laws and institutions of a semi-,  
barbarous ancestry. We appealed to those ol  
nature, and found it engraved in our hearts,  
yet we did not avail ourselves of all the advan­  
tages of our position. We hud never been  
permitted to exercise self government; when  
&#x27; forced to assume it, we were novices in its sci­  
ence, its principles and forms had entered little  
into our former education; we established how­  
ever some, although not all its important prin­  
ciples. The constitutions of most of our  
states assert, that all power is inherent in the  
people, that they may exercise it by themselves,  
competent; (as in ejecting their functionaries,  
executive and legislative, and deciding by a  
jury of themselves both fact and law. in all  
judiciary cases iti which any fact is involved;)  
or they may act by representatives, freely and e­  
qually chosen; that it is their right and duty to  
be at all times armed; that they are entitled to  
freedom of person, firedom of religion, freedom  
of property, and freedom of the press. In the  
structure of our legislatures, we think expe­  
rience has proved the benefit of subjecting  
questions to two seperate bodies of deliberants;  
  
but in&#x27;constituting these, natural right has been  
mistaken; some making one of these »o„se%  
and some both, the representatives of prop­  
erty instead of persons, whereas the double de­  
liberation might be as well obtained without  
any violation of true principle, either by requi­  
ring a greater age in one of the bodies, or by e­  
lectine a proper number of representatives of  
persons, dividing them by lot into two cham­  
bers, and renewing the division at frequent in­  
tervals, in order to break up cabals.  
“Virginia, of which I am myself a native and  
resident, was not only the first of the states, but  
I believe I mav sav, the first of the nations of  
the earth, which assembled its wise men peacea­  
bly together, to form a fundamental constitu­  
tion, to commit it to writing, and place it a­  
mong their archives, where every one should  
he free to appeal to its text. But this act was  
very imperfect; the other states, as they pro­  
ceeded successively to the same work, made  
successive improvements; ami several of them,  
still further corrected by experience, have by  
conventions, still further amended their first |  
forms. My own stale has gone on so lar with |  
its premitre ebauchcy but it is now proposing to  
call a convention lor amendment. Among  
other improvements, I hope they will adopt the  
sub-divisions of our counties into wards; the  
former may be estimated at an average of tvven- j  
tv four miles square, the latter should be six j  
miles square each, and would answer to the  
hundreds of your Saxon Alfred. In each of  
these might be, 1. An elementary school; 2.  
A company of militia, with its officers; 3. A  
justice of the peace and a constable; 4. Each  
ward should take care of their own poor; 5 Of  
their own roads; 6 Their own police; 7. Elect,  
within themselves, one or more jurors to attend j  
the courts of justice; 8. And here give in at j  
their folk-house their votes for all functionaries j  
reserved to their election. Each ward would j  
thus be a small republic within itself, and every j  
man in the state would thus become an acting  
member in the common government, transact- j  
ing in person, a great oortion of its l ights and i  
duties, subordinate indeed, but important, and  
entirely within his competence: the wit of man  
cannot devise a more solid basis for a free, du­  
rable and well administered republic.  
“With respect to our stale and federal gov­  
ernments, I do not think their relations correct­  
ly understood by foreigners. They generally  
suppose the former subordinate to the latter,  
but this is not the case, they are co-ordinate  
departments of or.e simple integral whole. To  
the state governments are reserved all legisla­  
tion and administration in affairs which con­  
cern-their own citizens only; and to the federal  
government is given whatever concerns foreign­  
ers, or the citizens of other states. These  
functions alone being federal, the one is the  
domestic, the other the foreign branch of the  
  
same government; neither having control over  
the other, but within its own department.—  
There are one or two exceptions only to this  
partition of power. But, you may ask if the  
two departments should claim each the same  
subject of power, where is the common umpire  
to decide ultimately between them. In cases  
of little importance or urgency the prudence  
of both parties will keep them aloof from the  
questionable ground, but if it can neither be  
avoided nor compromised, a convention of the  
States must be called to ascribe the doubtful !  
power to that department which rhey may think  
best. You will perceive by thes* details, that  
we have not so far perfected our constitutions  
as to venture to make them unchangeable—but  
still, in their present state, we consider them  
not otherwise changeable, than by the imme­  
diate authority of the people, or a special elec­  
tion of representatives for that purpose express­  
ly. They are till then the lex legum.  
“But can they be made unchangeable? Can  
one generation bind another, and all others in  
succession forever? I think not. The Creator  
hath made the earth for the living,not the dead.  
Rights and powers can only belong to persous,  
not to things; not to mere matter unendowed  
with will—the dead are not even things. The  
particles of matter which compose their bodies  
make part now of the bodies of other animals,  
vegetables, or minerals of a thousand forms.—  
To what then are attached the rights and pow­  
ers they hold while in the form of man? A ge­  
neration may bind itself as long as its majority j  
continues in life. When that has disanp ured, j  
another majority is in place, holds ail the rights |  
and powers their predecessors once held, and |  
may change their laws and instilulions 10 suit ;  
themselves; nothing th&gt;n is unchangeable but  
the inherent and unalienable rights of man.  
“I was glad to find, in your book, a formal  
contradiction, at length, cl the judiciary usur­  
pation of legislative powers; for such the judges  
have usurped, in their repeated decisions that1  
Christianity is a part of the common law.— ,  
The proof of the contrary which you have ad- j  
duced is incontrovertible, to wit, that the corn- j  
mon law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were I  
yet Ragans; at a time when they had never yet !  
heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew ;  
that such a character had existed. But it may  
amuse you to shew when and by what means  
they stole this law in upon us. In a case of  
quare impedit, in the year-book, 34 H. 6, fo. 38,  
(1453,) a question was made, how far the eccle­  
siastical law was to be respected in a common  
law court? And Prisot, r. 5, gives his opinion  
in these words—“A liel &#x27;lies que its dc reint  
egiise ont en ancien scripture, convicnt a nous a  
  
dooner credence; car ceo common ley sur quels  
louts manners leis sont fondcs;et auxy, sir nous  
sumus obliges de conustrc leur ley dc saint  
eglise; et semblablement ils sont obliges de co­  
nustre nostre ley; et, sir, si poit apperer a uous  
que l’evesque ad fait come un ordinary fera en  
tiel cas, adonq nousdevons ceo adjuger bon, ou  
auterment nemy,’ &amp;c. See S. C. Fitzh. Abr.  
qu. imp. 89, Bro. Abr. qu. imp 12. Finch in  
his first book, c. 3, is the first afterwards who  
quotes this case, and misstates it thus—‘To  
such laws of the Church as have warrant in  
holy scripture, our law giveth credence,’ and  
cites Prisot, mistranslating ‘ancien scripture’  
into ‘holy scripture,’ whereas Prisot palpably  
says‘to such laws as those of holy church have  
in antient writing, it is proper for us to give  
credence;’ to wtt, to their ancient written laws.  
1 his was in 1613, a century and a half after the  
dictum of Prisot. Wingate, in 1658, erects  
this false translation into a maxim of t:ie com­  
mon law,copying the words of Finch, but citing  
Prisot. Wingate max. 3, and Sheppard tit.  
‘Religion,’ in 1675, copies the same mistrans­  
*  
  
lation, quoting the Y. B. finch and Wingate.  
Hale expresses it in thes* words, ‘Christianity  
is parcel of the laws of England,’ 1 Ventr. 293,  
3 Keb. 607., but quotes no authority. By these  
echoings and re echoings from one to another,  
it had become so established *n 1728, that in the  
case of the KingQrs. Woolston, 2 Stra. 834, the  
court would not suffer it to be debated, whether  
to write against Christianity was punishable in  
the temporal courts of common law? Wood  
therefore, 409, ventures still to vary the phrase,  
and says, ‘that all blasphemy and profaneness  
are offences by the common law,’ and cites 2  
Stra.; then Blackstone, in 1763, IV 59, repeats  
the words of Hale, that ‘Christianity is part o!  
the common law of England,’ citing Ventris  
and Strange; and finally Lord Mansfield, with  
a little qualification, in Evans’s case in 17t&gt;.,  
says,‘that the essential principles of revealed  
religion are parts oi the common law,’ thus en­  
gulphing Biole, Testament and all, into the  
common law, without citing any authority.-—  
And thus far we find this chain cf authorities  
hanging link by link one upon another, and all  
ultimately upon one and the same book, and  
that a mistranslation of the words ‘ancien scrip­  
ture’used bv Prisot. finch quotes Prisot;  
Wingate does the same; Sheppard quotes Pri­  
sot, Finch and Wingate; Hale cites nobody;  
the court, in Woolston’s case, cites Hale; Wood  
cites Woolston’s case; blaekstonc quotes \\ ooi­  
ston’s case, and II.de; and Lord Mansfield, like  
Hale, ventures it on his own authority. Here  
I might defy the best read lawyer to produce  
another scrip of authority for this judiciary for­  
geryand I might go on further lo shew how  
some of the Anglo-Saxon prints interpolated  
into the text of Alfred&#x27;s laws, the 20th; 21st,  
22d and 23d chapters of Exodus, and the 15th  
of the Acts ol the Apostles, from the 23d to  
the 29th verses. But this would lead my pen  
and your patience too far. W hat a conspiracy  
this between Church and State!!! Sing I an­  
taiarara, Hogues all, Rogues all; sing Tantaia­  
  
rara, Hogues ail!  
“I must still add to this long and rambling  
letter my acknowledgements for your good  
wishes to the University we are now establish­  
ing in tliis state. There are sonic novelties in  
it; of that of a professorship of the principles  
of government, you express your approbation.  
They will be founded in the rights of man; that  
of agriculture I am sure you will approve; and  
that also of Anglo-Saxon. As the histories and  
laws left us, in that type and dialect, must be  
the text-books of the reading of the learners,  
they will imbibe with the language their fret­  
principles of government. The volumes you  
have been so kind as to send, shall be placed in  
the library of the University. Having at this  
time in England, a person sent for the purpose  
of selecting some professors, a Mr. Gilmer o!  
my neighborhood, I cannot hut recommend  
him to your patronage, counsel, and guardian­  
ship, against imposition, misinformation, aruj  
the deceptions of partial and false recommen­  
dations, in the selection oT characters; he is a  
getulcman of great worth and correctnesss, my  
particular friend, well educated in various  
branches of science, and worthy of entire confi­  
dence.  
“Your age of eighty-four, and mine of eighty­  
one years, ensure us a speedy meeting. We  
may then commence at leisure, and more fully,  
on the good and evil, which in the course of  
our long lives, we have both witnessed; and in

AIonriCEi.i.o, in VtnotNiA, June 6, 1821.  
“ Durr uriil l”entrable Sir«—i am much in­  
debted for your kind letter p! Feb. 21*, and for your  
valuable volume on the English constilutioi&#x27;. I  
read this with pleasure anil much approbation;  
and T think it has deduced the constitution inhe­  
rited by the English nation, horn its rightful root,  
ttie Anglo S.ixon. It is really wonderful that so  
many able men should have failed in their attempt*  
to define it with correctness; no wonder then that  
I’aine, win thought more than he read, should have  
ci edited the great authorities who have declared,  
that the Will ol Parliament is &#x27;.lie Constitution ol  
England. 8o Marbois, before the French devo­  
lution, observed to me, that the Almanac lioyal  
was the constitution of France. Your derivation ol  
i*t from the Anglo Saxon*, seems to he made onle­  
g timate principle*. Having driven out the former  
i:diabitants of that part of ihe island called England,  
they became, as to you, Aborigines, and your lineal  
ancestors; they doubtless had a constitution, and  
although they have not left it in a written formula,  
S&gt; the precise test of which you may always appeal,  
yet they have left fragments of their history and  
laws, front which it may be in&#x27;eiretl, with consi­  
derable certainty. Whatever tln-ir history and laws  
shew to have been practised with approbation, w e  
otay presume was peruiiitcd by their constitution;  
whatever ws* not so practised, was not perm it ad,  
and although this constitution wae violated, and set  
nt nought by Norman fence, yet force cannot change  
right; a perpetual claim was kept up by ihe Nation  
in their peipetual demand of the lestorution of their  
Sixon laws, which shews they never were relin­  
quished by the will of the nation. In the pullings  
and hauling* for these aulieiit right*, between 111*,  
nation, and its kings of tiie races of PJantageurts,  
Tudors, and Stunts, there was sometimes gain and  
sometime* lo*s, until the final recouquesl of thvir  
rights from the Stuarts, broke the thread of pre -  
tended inheritance, extinguished all regal usurpa­  
tion*, and the nation re-entered in&#x27;o all its rights;  
and altlioughjn their bill of rights they specifically  
reclaim some only, yet ihe oints-ion of others was  
no renunciation of tlic right to assume their ex&lt; r­  
i.-Ue also, whenever occa-ion* should occur. The  
new king received no right* or powers but iho*e  
&#x27; xpressly granted to linn. It has ever appeared to  
me, that ihe ditfeience between the whig and the  
tory of England is, that the w hig deduce* his rights  
from ihe Anglo Saxon_ source, the tory from the  
Norman; and Hume, the great npo.*tlc of lorji-m  
says, in so many words, (note aa toch»p. 12.) that  
u the rsigns of the 8 uaris, it was the people who  
encroached upon the sovereign, riot the sovereign  
who attempted, as is pretended, to usurp upon ihe  
people,’ this supposes the Norman usurpations to  
lie rights in hm *ucce**ors; and again, (c. !&gt;!).’)  
** the common* established a principle, which is  
noble m itself, and seems specious but is believed  
by *11 history and experience, that the people arc  
t’a origin of all JUSTp ,wer! and whei e else  
will this degenerate son of science, this traitor to  
in* fellow-men, find the origin of jrs r pow er, if  
not in the majority of the .Society ? Will it be in  
tire minority, or in an individual of that minority f  
Our revolution commenced on more favoura­  
ble ground. It presented us an Album, on which  
we were free to write wiiat we pleased; we had no  
occasion to search into musty record*, to hunt up  
royal parchments, or to investigate the laws and  
institutions of a semi-barbarous ancestry. We ap­  
pealed to those ol nature, and found them engraved  
tn our hearts, yet we did not avail ourselves of all  
the advantages of our position. We hud never  
been pcrrnitteJ to exercise self-government; when  
forced to assume it, we were novice* in it* science;  
its principles anil forms had entered little into our  
former education; we established however some, al­  
though not all it* important principles. The con­  
s:ihition* of most ol our states as.ert, that all power  
is inherent in the people; that they may exercise  
it by themselves, in all cases to which they think  
themselves competent; (as in electing iheir lunc­  
tronarie*, executive and legislative, aud deciding by  
a jury of themselves both fact and law, in all judi­  
ciary cases in which any fact is involved;) or they  
may act by representatives, freely and equally  
chosen; thai it is their right and duty to be at all  
time* armed; that they are entitled to freedom ol  
person, freedom of religion, fieedom ol property,  
and freedom of the pie**. In (he structure of out  
Icgidatur**, we think experience lias provtd (tie  
  
benefit ol subjecting questions to two nopsiate bo­  
dies of deliberates; but in constituting these, natural  
right has been mistaken; some making one of these  
bodies, and ome both, the representatives ol pro­  
perty instead of persons, whereas the double delibe­  
ration might be as well obtained wi&#x27;liout any  
violation of true principle, erher by requiring «  
greater age in one of the bodies, or by electing a  
proper number of representatives of persons, divid­  
ing them by lot into two chamber*, and renewing  
the dfcision at frequent intervals, in outer to break  
&lt;ip cabal*. \
&quot; Virginia, of which I*gm, myself a native and  
resident, was not only the first ol the s.ate*, but I  
believe I may say, the first of the nations of die  
earth, which a*-ernt&gt;le I its wise men peaceably to­  
gether, to form a fundamental constitution, to coin  
rnit it to writing, and place it among their archives,  
where eveiy one should he free to appeal to its  
taxt. Hot this act was very tmyerfect; the other  
•late*, as they proceeded, successively to the same  
-work, made successive improvements, and saveral  
of them, still f irther corrected by experience, have  
by conventions,still further amended their first forms.  
My own state has gone on so far with its premiert  
tbauehr, but it is now proposing to cail a conven­  
tion lor amendment. Among other improvements,  
l hope they will adopt the *ub*divi*ions of our  
counties into ward*; the former may be estimated  
at an average of twenty-four miles square, the latter  
;bo‘j’(ibc:i.t rr*^« c»ch,»rd would ansrrt;  
  
o the hundreds of your Saxen Alfred. Iu each of  
hese might be, 1. An elementary school; 2. A  
company of militia, with its officers; 3. A justice  
the peace and a constable; 4. Each ward should  
:»ke care of their own poor; fi. Of their own roads;  
5. Their own police; 7. Elect, within themselves,  
one or more jurors to attend the courts.of justice;  
3. And here give in at their folk-house their votes  
for all functionaries reserved to their election.—  
Each ward would thus be a small republic within  
itsell, and every man in the state would thus become  
an acting member in the common government,  
transacting in person, a great portion of its tights  
and duties, subordinate indeed, but important, and  
entirely within his competence: the wit of man  
cannot devise a more solid basis for a free, iXtrable  
and well administered republic.  
“ With respect to our state and federal govern­  
ments, I do not think their relations correctly un­  
derstood by loreigners. They generally suppose  
the former subordinate to the latter; but this is  
not the case, they are co-ordinate departments of  
one simple integral whole. To tlie state govern­  
ments are reserved all legislation and administra- :  
tion in affairs which concern their own citizens on- i  
!y; and to the federal government is given what- i  
ever concerns foreigners, or the citizens ol other i  
slates. These functions alone being federal, the  
one is the domestic, the other the foreign branch, of  
the same government; neither having control over  
(lie other, but within its own department. There  
are one or two exceptions only to this partition of  
power. But, you may ask if the two departments  
should claim eachthe same subject of power,where  
is the common umpiie to decide ultimately between  
them. In cases ol little importance or urgency the  
prudence of both parties will keep them aloof from  
the questio able ground; but if it can neither be  
avoided nor compromised, a convention of the  
states must be called, to ascribe the doubtful pow­  
er to that departmeut which they may think best.  
—\ oil will perceive by these details, that we have  
not so far perfected our constitutions a- to venture  
to make them unchangeable—but still, m their  
present state, we consider them not otherwise  
changeable, than by the immediate authoiityof the  
people, or a spcci &gt;1 election of representatives for  
that purpose, expressly. They arc till lien the  
lex legum.  
  
“ Hut cnn they be made unchangeable? Can  
one generation bind another, and all others in suc­  
cession for ever? I think not. The Creator hath  
made the earth lor the living, not the dead. Rights  
and powers ran only belong to persons, not to  
things; not to mere matter unendowed with will —  
tlie dead are not even things. The particles of  
matter which comp sc their bodies make pari now  
ol the bodies of oilier animals, vegetables, or min­  
erals of a tliou-aud forms. To what then arc at­  
tached the rights and powers they held while in the  
form of man? A generation may bind itself as  
long as its majority continues in life. When that  
has di-appea ed, another majority is in place, holds  
nil the fights and powers their predecessors once  
held, and may change their laws and institutions  
to suit themselves; nothing then is unchangea­  
ble but the inherent at d unalienable rights of man.  
“ 1 w is glad to find, in your book, a formal con­  
j tradii t on, at length, of t he judiciary usurpation of  
I legislative powers; for such tlm judges have u-urp­  
td, in their repeated decisions that Christianity is a  
part of the common law. The proof of thecontrary  
which you have adduced is incontrovertible, to wit,  
that tiie common law existed while the Anglo-Sax­  
ons were yet Pagans; at a time when they had ne­  
| ver jet heard the names of Christ pronounced, or  
knew that such a character had existed. Cut it  
| may amuse you to shew when and by what means  
| they stole this law in upon us. In a case ol quare  
irnpedit, in the year-book, 3 HI. (?, fo. S3, (1439,)  
a question was made, how far the ecclesiastical law  
was to be re-jicc ed in a common law court? And  
Prisot, c. 5, gives his opinion in these wools_* A  
tiel lies que its de seiut eglise ont en ancien scrip­  
ture, convient a notlse a donner credence; car ceo  
common ley sur quels touts manners leis *ont fon­  
des;et auxy, sir, nous suinus obliges de conustie  
ictir ley de saint eglist; et scmblablcment i!s sont  
! obliges tie conustre nostre ley;et, sir, si poit apper­  
er a nous quo l’evesqiie ad fait come un ordinary  
tera en tiel cas, adouq nousdevons ceo adjuger boa,  
ou auterment nemy,’ &amp;c. See S. C. Kiizh. Abr.  
qu. imp. 89, Hro. Abr. qn. imp. 12. Finch in his  
first bi ok, r. 3, is the first afterwards who quotes  
•his case, and misstates it thus—‘ To such laws of  
the Church us have warrant in holy scripture, our  
iaw giveth credence,’ and cites Priscot, mistransla­  
ting &#x27; at.l ien scripture’ into ‘ holy scripture’,where­  
as Piiscot palpably says &#x27; to such laws as those  
of holy church have in undent writing, it is proper  
for us to give credence;’ to wit, to their ancient  
written laws. This was in 1(513, a century and a  
half after the dictum of Prisot. Wingate, in 1653,  
erects this false translation into a maxim of the  
common law, copying the words of Finch, but cit­  
ing Prisot. Wingate max. 3, and Sheppard tit.  
* Religion,’ in 1675, copies the same mistransla­  
tion, quoting ihe Y. B. Finch and Wingate, lisle  
expresses it in these words, • Christianity is parcel  
of the laws of England,’ 1 Ventr. 293, 3 lveb. 607,  
but quotes no authority. By these echoutgs and  
re echr.ings from one to another, it had become so  
established in 1723, that irt the ea-t* of the King  
v.s. Woolston, 2 Stra. 831, the court would not  
suffer it to be debated, whether to write against  
Christianity was punishable in the temporal courts  
at common law ? Wood therefore, 41)9, ventures  
still to vary the phrase, and says, » that all blas­  
phemy and profaneness are offences by the common  
law,’ and cites 2 Stra.; then Hlackstone, in 1763,  
IV- 59, repeats the tvor.ls of.IIale, that » Christi­  
anity is part of the common law of England,’ cit­  
i ing Ventris and Strange; and finally Lord Mans­  
i field, with a little qualification, in Evans’s rase in  
j 1767, says, • that the essential principles of reveal­  
: ed religion are parts of the common law,’ thus  
engulphing Bible, Testament and all, into the com­  
mon law, without citing any authority. And thus  
lar we find this chain of authorities hanging link  
by link one upon another, and ail ultimately upon  
one and the same hook, and that a mistranslation  
of tfie words ‘ ancisn scripture’ used by Prisot_  
l* inch quotes Prisot; Wingate does the same; Shep­  
pard quotes Prisot, Finch and Wingate; Hale cites  
nobody; the court, in Wooiston’s case, cites Hale;  
Wood cites Wooiston’s case; Hlackstone quotes  
Wool-urn’s case, and Hale; and Lord Man-field,  
like Ilaie, ventures it on his own authority. Here  
1 might defy the best read lawyer to pro luce ano­  
ther scrip ol authority for this judiciary forger)/;  
and 1 might go on further to shew now some of  
the Anglo-S.xon prints interpolated int9 the text  
of Alfred’s laws, the 2*th, 21st, 22d, and 23d  
chapters of Exodus, and the 15th of the Acts of  
Apostles, from the 23J to the 29th verses. Hut  
thi would lead my pen and jour patience too far.

Dear and Venerable Sir—1 am much indebt

valnable volume on the English constitution.  
I have read this with pleasure and much ap-

“ It has ever appeared to me, that the differ-  
ence between the whig and the tory of England  
is, that the whig deduces his rights from the An-  
glo-Saxon source, the tory, from the Norman ;  
and Hume, the great apostle of toryism, says, in  
so many words, (note aa to chap. 42) that in the  
reigns of the Stuarts, it was the people who en-  
croached upon the sovereign who attempted as  
is pretended to usurp upon the people; this  
supposes the Norman usurpations to be rights  
in his successors ; and again, (c. 59) “the com-  
mons established a principle which is noble in  
  
itself, and scems specious, but is belied by all  
  
history and experience, that the people are the  
origin of all JUST power! And where else  
will this degenerate son of science, this traitor  
to his fellow men, find the origin of sust power,  
if not in the majority of the Society? Will it  
be inthe minority, or in an individual of that

“ You will perceive by these details, that we  
have not so far perfected our constitutions as  
to venture to make them unchangeable—but  
still, in their present state we consider them not  
otherwise changeable, than by the immediate  
authority of the people, or a special election  
of representatives for that purpose expressly.  
They are till then the lexlegum.  
  
“But can they be made unchangeable? Can  
one generation bind another, and all others in  
succession.forever? I think not. The Creator  
hath made the earth for the living, not the  
dead, Rights and powers can only belong to  
persons, not to things ; not to mere matter up-  
endowed with will—the dead are not even things.  
The particles of matter which composed their  
bodies make part now of the bodies of animals,  
vegetables, or minerals of a thousand forms.  
To what then are attached the rights and pow-  
ers they hold while in the form of man? A  
generation may bind itself as long as its major-  
ity continues in life. When that has disappear-  
ed, another majority is in place, holds all the  
rights and powers their predecessors once held,  
may change their laws, and institutions te  
suit themselves ; nothing then is unchangeable  
but the inherent and unalienable rights of man.

“T was glad to find in your book a formal  
contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpa-  
tion of legislative powers ; for such the judges  
have usurped, in their repeated decisions that  
Christianity is a part of the common law.—  
The proof of the contrary which is adduced is  
incontrovertible, to wit, that the common law  
existed while the Anglo Saxons were yet Pa-  
gans ; at atime when they had never yet heard  
the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that  
such a. character had existed. But it may a-  
muse you to shew when and by what means  
they stole this law in upon us, In a case  
quare impedit, in the yearbook, 34 H. 6, fo,  
38, (1455,) a question was made, how far the  
ecclesiastical Jaw was to be respected in a com-  
mon law court? And Prisot, c. 5, gives his o-  
pinion in these words— A tiel lies que ils de  
seint eglise ont en ancien scripture, coveinta  
nous a donner credence; car ceo common  
ley sur quels touts manners leis sout fondes ;  
et auxy, sir, nous sumus obliges de conustre  
leur ley de saint eglise ; et semblablement ils  
sont obliges de conustre nostre-ley ; et, sir, si  
poit apperer a nous que l’evesque ad fait come  
un ordinary fera en tiel cas, adong, nous de  
vons ceo adjuger bon, ou autermeat nemy,  
&amp;c. See 8, C. Fitzh. Abr. qu. imp. 89, Bro.  
Abr. qu. imp. 12. Finch in his first book, c.  
3, is the first afterwards who quotes this case,  
and misstates it thus—‘ To such laws of the  
Church as have warrant in holy scripture, our  
law gives credence,’ and cites Prisot, mistrans-  
  
  
  
lating ‘ ancient scripture,’ into ‘ holy scripture,’  
where as Prisot palpably says ‘ to such laws as  
those of holy church have an antient writing,  
  
itis proper for us to give credence 3 to wit, to  
their ancient written laws. ‘This was in 1613,  
a century and a half after the dictum of Prisot.  
Wingate, in 1658 erects this false translatioo  
into a maxim of the common law, copying the  
words of Finch, but citing Prisot. Wingtan  
max, 3, and Sheppard tit.—’ Religion,’ in  
1675, copies the same mistranslation, quot-  
ing the N. B. Finch and Wingate. Hale  
expresses it in these words, ‘ Christianity is  
parcel of the laws of England, 1 Ventr.  
293, 3 Keb. 607, but quotes no authority, By  
these echoings and re-echoings from one toan-  
other, it had become so established in 1728,  
that in the case of the King vs. Woolston, 2  
Stra. 834, the court would not suffer it to be  
debated whether to write against Christianity  
was punishable in the temporal courts at com-  
inon law! Wood therefore, 400, ventures still  
to vary the phrase and says, ‘ that all blasphe-  
my and profaneness are offences by the com-  
mon law,’ and cites 2 Stra.; then Blackstone,  
in 1763. iv. 59, repeats the words of Hale, that  
‘ Christianity is part of the common law of  
England,’ citing Ventis and Strange; and fi-  
nally Lord Marsfield, with a little qualification,  
in Evan’s case in 1767, says, ‘ that the essen-  
tial principles of revealed religion are parts of  
the common law,’ thus engulphing Bible, Tes-  
tament and all, into the common law, with.  
  
  
  
GOSPEL ADVOCATE.  
  
out citing any authority. And thas far we find  
this chain of authorities hanging link by link  
one upon another, and all ultimately upon one  
and the same hook, and that a mistranslation  
of the words ¢ ancient scripture’ used by Prisot,  
Finch quotes, Prisot, Wingate does the same;  
Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch and Winsgate ;  
Hale cites nobody ; the court, in Woolsion’s  
case, cites Hale; Wood cites Woolston’  
case ; Blackstone quotes Woolston’s case and  
Hale; and Lord Mansfield, like Hale, ventures  
it on his own authority. Here I might defy,  
the best read lawyer to produce another script  
of authority for this judiciary forgery ; and |  
might go on farther to shew how some of the ©  
Anglo Saxon priests interloped into the text of ©  
Alfred’s laws, the 20th, 21st, 22d, and 23d chap.  
ters of Fxodus, and the 15th of the Acts Of the  
Apostles, from the 23d to the 29th verses,—  
But this would lead my pen and your pa-  
tience too far. What aconspiracy this be-  
tween Church and State!!!

King received no riglits or powers, but those

to me, that the diTTerence betwevn te whip and

together, to firm a fundamental constitution, . to  
Commit it to writing, and plaee it among rfieir  
archives, where every one should be&#x27;frre to ap­  
peal to its text. But this act was very imperfect  
the other States, as the) proceeded success­

corrected by experience, have by convent:ons,

v 1 vraa irtad to find ii vour book, a formal con  
tradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation  
of legislative f ovrers by which the Judges have  
usurped in tlysif&#x27; repeated decisions, that Christi­  
anity is a part of the common law. The proof of  
the contrary, which you hve udduc d, is ineon­  
troveTrible to wit, that the&#x27;commoii law. existed  
while the Anglo-Saxons were vet Pagan v, at a  
time whep they, bad never beard Ows name, of  
Christ pronounQedV.cr knew that such a charac­  
ter had existed.&#x27;, Cut it may amuse you to shew­  
when and by .what Tneans&#x27; they stole this law in  
upon us. &#x27; In a case of quare impeditj in the year­  
book, 34 II. 6, fo. 38, (1458) a: question was  
made, how far the ecclesiastical law was twbe  
respecteil in a common law court.&quot; And I&#x27;risot,  
c. 5, gives Iiia opinion in these Words : A tiel  
lies que lis te&#x27;seint &#x27;eglise ont en ancient scrip-  
fwrift&#x27;covient&#x27;a nnus a do. ncr credi nee cut ceo

S. C. Fitzh. Abr. qu imp. 12.&#x27;.. Finrh, in h&#x27;s  
first book, c. 3. is h first afterwards who quotes  
this rase, nd misstates it, ti(di : ; To .surh laWs  
of the Church as f.ave warrant in holy serrptnre,&#x27;  
onr law giveth credence, and ci&#x27;es Prisot, mis­  
translating ancitnt scripture into&#x27; &#x27;holy scrip­  
ture;&#x27; whereas Prisot palpably says, &#x27; to such  
laws as those of hotv church have in ancient wi-  
ling, it is proper for us to give credence, to wit,-  
to their ancient written laws. This was 161J, a  
ce:t.try and a half sifter the dictum of Prisot.  
Wing-.&#x27;te, in 1658, erects this false translation in­  
to h maxim of the common law,- copying the  
words of Finch, hut citing Prisot.&#x27; Wingate max.  
2, and Sheppard, tit. lUHg-on,&#x27; in 1675, copies  
the s ime mistranslation, quoting the Y.B. Finch  
and Wirjrate. If ale expresses it intheie words,  
&#x27; CHristianity is parcrl of the laws of England,&#x27;  
1 Vertr 293, 3 Keb. 607, bin quotes no authori­  
ty. Hy these echoing and r-echoings from one  
to another, it had become so established in &#x27;1728,  
that, in the case of the King vs. Woolston, 2 Stra.  
834, the court wonld not sufler it to be d.-bated,  
whether to write against Christianity was&#x27;pnnish­  
abfe in the temporal courts at common law ?  
Wood, tlierefon,, 409, ventures still to vary the

recommend him to your patronage, counsel and

“Dear anil Venerable Sir : — I am much indebted |  
for your kind le&#x27;lcr of Feb. 29. and for yonr valnn - 1  
ble volume on the F.nglish Constitution. 1 bare  
Tead ibis with pleasure at:d much approbation; and j  
1 think it lias deduced the constitution inherited hyF  
the English nation, from its rightful root, the Anglo  
Saxon. It is really wonderful that so many able]  
men should have failed in their attempts to define,  
it with correctness; no wonder then that Paine,  
who thought more than he read, should have credit-  
ed the great authorities who have declared that  
the Will of Parliament is the Constitution of long-  
land. So Marbois, before the French Revolution,  
observed to me, that the Almanac Royal was the  
constitution of France. Your deviation of it front  
the Anglo Saxons, seents to be made on legitimate  
principles. Having driven out the former inhabi-  
tants of that part of the island called England, they  
became, as to you Aborigines, and your lineal an-  
cestors; they doubtless had a constitution, and al-  
though they have oot left it in a written formula, to  
the precise lext of which you may always appeal,  
yet they have left fragments of their history and  
laws, from which it may be inferred with considera-  
ble certainty. Whatever their history and law  
shew to have been practised with approbation we  
may presume was permitted by their constitution;  
whatever was not ho practised was not permitted,  
and although this constitution was violated and set  
at nought by Norman force, yet force cannot  
change l ight; a perpetual claim was kept up bv the  
nation in their perpetual demand of the restoration  
of their Saxon laws, which shews they never were  
relinquished by the will of the nation. In the pul-  
lings ami haulings for these anlient rights, between  
the nation and its kings of the races of Plantagencts.  
Tudors and Stuarts, there n as sometimes gain and  
sometimes loss, until the final reeomjuest of their  
rights from the Stuarti broke the thread of pretend-  
ed ‘nheritauce, extinguished all regal usurpations,  
and the nation re-entered into all its rights; and  
although in their bill of rights they specifically re-  
claim some only, yet the omission of others was no  
renunciation of the right to assume their exercise  
also, whenever occasions should occur. &#x27;The new  
king received no rights or powers but those ex-  
pressly granted to him. It ha? ever appeared to  
ine, that the difference between the whig and the  
tory of England is, that the whig deduces his rights  
from the Anglo-Saxon source, the torv from ti e  
If irman: and Hume, the great apostle of toryism  
says, in so many words, (note as to chap. 42) “that  
in the reigns of the Stuarts, it was the people who  
encroached upon Ihe sovereign, not the sovereign  
who attempted, as i« pretended, to usurp upon the  
people: this supposes the Norman usurpations to he  
rights in his success ors; and again, (c. 59,) “the  
commons established a principle, which is noble :r.  
Itself, and seems specious, but is aelied by all histo-  
ry and experience, that the people are the origin of  
all JUS J&#x27; power!&quot; a i l where else will this degen-  
erate son of science, this traitor to his fellow men,  
find the origin of jest power, if not in the majority  
of the Society! Will it he in the minority , or in  
an individual of that minor it y !  
  
‘•Our revolution commenced on more favourable  
ground. It presented us Ml Album, on which we  
were free to write wiiat we pleased; wo had no oc-  
casion ro search into musty records, to hunt up roy-  
al parchments, or to investigate the laws and in-  
stitutions of a semi-barbarous ancestry. We ap-  
pealed to those of nature, and found them engraved  
in our hearts, yet wc dot not avail ourselves of all  
the advantages of our position. VVe had never been  
pemitted to exorcise self government: when forc-  
ed to assume it. we wore novices in its science; its  
principles and forms had entered little into ourfor-  
mer education; we established however some, al-  
though not all. its important principles The con-  
stitutions of most of our states assert, that all pow-  
er is inherent in ihe people; that they inay exercise!  
it by themselves in all cases to which they think  
themselves competent; (as in electing their function- 1  
ari rs, executive, ,t legislative A; deriding by a jui v &quot;f  
themselves both fact and law, in a!) judiciary cas&lt; sj  
in which any fact is involved;) or they may act !&gt;y  
reqresjnl at ives, freely and equally chosen; that it i  
is their right and duty to lie at all limes aimed;  
•hat they arc eutitled to freedom of person, free-  
dom of religion, freedom of property and freedom  
of the press. In fhe structure of our legislature,  
we think experience I as proved the benefit of sub-  
jecting questions to two separate hudms of deliber  
an Is; hut in constituting these, natural right has  
been mistaken; some making one of these bodies,  
anil some both, the representatives of properly in-  
stead of persons, whereas the double deliberation  
might I t a&#x27; well obtained without any violation of  
true principle, either by requiring a greater age in  
one of the bodies, or by electing a proper number  
of representatives of persons, dividing them by lot  
into two chambers, and renewing the division al  
fr qiieiit intervals, in order to break op cabals.

to the hundreds of your Saxon Alfred. In each of  
these might be, I. An elementary school; ‘ 2 . A I  
company of militia, with its officers; 3. A justice of  
the peace and a constable; 4. Each ward should  
take care ot their own poor; 5. Of their own roads;  
  
C. Their own .police; 7. Elect, within themselves,  
one or more jurors to attend the courts of just ice; 3.  
  
And here give in at their folk-house their votes fur  
iiinclit.narifs reserved to their election. Each  
ward would thus be a small republic within itself,  
j and every man in Ihe state would thus become aD  
j acting member in the common government, trans-  
I acting in person, a great portion of its rights and  
duties, subordinate indeed, bwi important, and en-  
tirely within bis competence: the wit of man cannot  
devise a more solid basis for a free, durable and  
well administered republic.  
  
“With respect to our state and federal govern-  
ments, 1 do uot think their relations correctly un-  
derstood by foreigners. They generally suppose  
the former subordinate to the latter; but this is ndt  
the case, they are co-ordinate departments of one  
simple integral whole. To the state governments  
arc reserved all legislation anc^ administration in  
affairs which concern their own citizens only, and  
to the federal government is given whatever con-  
cerns foreigners, or the citizens of other states  
These functions alone being federal, the one is the  
domestic, the other the foreign branch of the same  
government; neither having control over the other,  
but within its own department. There are one or  
two exceptions only to this partition of power  
But, you may ask if the two departments should  
claim each the same subject of power, w here is the  
common umpire to decide ultimately between  
them. In cases of little importance or urgency the  
prudence of both parlies will keep them aloof from  
the questionable ground; but if it can neither he  
avoided nor compromised, a convention of the  
states must be called, to ascribe the doubtful pow-  
er to that department which they may this. k best.  
  
You will perceive by these details, that we have  
not so far perfected our constitutions as to venture  
to make them unchangeable — but still, in their  
present state, we consider them not otherwise  
changeable, than by the immediate authority of ihe  
people, or a special election of representatives for  
that purpose expeessly. They are till ♦hen the lex  
legum.  
  
“But can they be made unchangeable 1 Can one  
generation bind another, and all others in succes-  
sion for ever? 1 think not. The Creator bath  
made the earth for the living not the dead. Mights j  
and powers can only belong to persons, not to j  
things; not to mere matter endowed with will- — the !  
dead are not even things. The particles of matter i  
which composed their bodies make part now oi the!  
bodies of other animals, vegetables or minernis of a j  
thousand forms. To what then are attached the i  
rights and powers they held while in the form of [  
man] A generation may bind itself as lung as its !  
majority continues in life. When that has disap-  
peared, another majority is in place, holds all the j  
rights and powers their predecessors once held, and  
may change their laws and institutions to suit  
themselves; nothing then is unchangeable but the  
inherent and unalienable rights of man.  
  
“1 was glad to find, in your hook, a formal con-  
tradiction. at length, of the judiciary usurpation of  
of legislative powers; for such the judges have  
usurped, in their repeated decisions that Christian-  
ity is a part of the common law. The proof of the  
contrary which you have adduced is incontroverti-  
ble. to wit, that the common law existed while the !  
Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans; at a time when  
they had never yet heard the name of Christ pro-  
nounced, or knew that such a character existed.  
  
\ But it may amuse you to shew when and by what  
j means they stole tins law in upon us. In a ca-»e of  
j quare iinpedTr, in the year-book, 34 11. 6 ,fo. 38,  
j (1468,) a question was made, how far the ecclesias-  
tical law was to be respected in a common law  
court? And Prisot, c. 5, gives bis opinion in these  
words — * A liel lies qite iis de seiut eglise cut en  
(lucien scnj tnrc, convienta nouse a donner cre-  
dence; car ceo common ley stir quels touts manners  
leis so fit formes; etnu\y, sir, nous soutus obliges de

adjuger hon, on auterment nemy,’ 4o- Idee S. C  
fr it/.h. Abr. qu. imp. 80. Bro. Abr. qu. imp  
J inch in his first book, c. 3. is the first afterw  
who quotes this case, and misstates it thus — ‘To  
such laws of the Church as have warrants in holy  
scripture , our law givoth credence,’ and cites Pris-  
ot, mistranslating ‘abcien scripture’ &quot;into ‘holy  
scripture, whereas Prisot palpably says ‘to such  
laws as those of holy church have in autient writing,  
it is proper for us to give credence;* to wit, to their  
ancient w ritten laws. This was in IbO.i, a century  
and a halt after the dictum of Prisot. Wingate, in  
1 G58, erects this false translation into a maxim of .  
the common law, copying the words of Finch,!  
but citing Prisot. W ingate mix. 2 , and Sheppard !  
tit. ‘Religion,’ in 1676, copies the same mistruns- J  
lation, quoting the V. B. Finch and Wingate.  
  
Ilale expresses it in these words ‘Christianity R !  
parcel of the laws of England I Ventr. 293, 3 Keb. !  
  
607, but quotes no authority. By these echoings  
and re-echpings from one to another, it had be-  
come so established in 1728, that in the case of the  
King vs Woolston ,2 Stra. 834, the court would  
not 9 iitfer it to be debated, \\ helher to write against  
Christianity was punishab! • in the temporal courts  
at common law] Wood therefore, 409, ventures  
&#x27;•till to vary the phrase, and says, ‘that all blasphe-  
my and profaneness are offences hy the common  
i law,’ and cites 2 Stra.; then Blackstone, 17*33, IV.  
o9, repeats the words of Hale, that, ‘Christianity is  
part 4 f the common law of England,’ citing Ventris  
and Strange; and finally Lord Mansfield, with a  
little qualification, in Evan’s case in 1767, savs,  
  
‘that the essent ial principles of revealed religion  
arc parts of the common law,* thus enguiphing Bi-  
ble, Testament and all, into the common law with  
out citing any authority .—And thus far we find this  
chain of authorities hanging link by link one upon  
another, and all ultimately upon one and the same  
book, and that a mistranslation of the words  
‘ancient scripture* used by Pri 9 ot. Finch quotes  
Prisot; Wingate docs the same; Sheppard quotes

the common law existed while the Anglo Saxons were yet pagans ; at a  
time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or  
knew that such a character had ever existed. But it may amuse you to  
show when, and by what means, they stole this lawin upon us. Ina  
case of Quare Impedit, in the year [1458,] book 34, Henry VI. fo. 38, a  
question was made how far the ecclesiastical law was to be respected ina  
common law court? and Prisot, 1. C., gave his opinion in these words :  
‘a tiel les que ils de saint eglise ont en ancien scripture, covient a nous a  
donner credence ; car ceo Commen Ley sur quels touts manners leis sont  
fonddes. Et auxy, sir, nous sumus obliges do conustre nostre ley—Et,  
sir, Si poit apperer or a nous que l’evesque adfait come un ordinary fera  
en tiel cas, adorez nous devons ceo adjuger bon, ou auterment nemy ?’ &amp;c.  
See G. C. Fitz, abr. qu. imp.89. Bro. abr. qu. imp. 12. [&#x27;To such laws as  
they have of the ancient writings, it behooves us to give credence: for, it  
is that common law upon which all kinds of law are founded; and

cases, then we should adjudge it good, and not otherwise.] Finch, in his Ist  
book, c.3, is the first afterwards who quotes the case, and misstates it thus,  
‘tosuch laws of the church as have warrant in holy scripture, our law  
giveth credence,’ and cites Prisot; mistranslating ‘ ancient scripture’ into

holy scripture ;’ whereas Prisot palpably says, ‘to such laws as those of  
  
holy church have in ancient writing it is proper for us to give credence ;’  
to wit, to their ancient wfitten laws. This was in 1513, a century and a  
half after the dictum of Prisot. Wingate, in 1658, erects this false trans-  
lation into a maxim of the common law, copying the words of Finch, but  
citing Prisot. Wingate, max. 3, and Sheppard, tit. ‘ Religion,’ in 1675,  
copies the same mistranslation, quoting the Y. 13, Finch and Wingate.  
  
Ilale expresses it in these words : ‘ Christianity is parcel of the law of  
  
England’—I Vesetre, 293, 3 Keb. 607 ; but quotes no authority. By these  
echoings and reechoings from one to another, it had become so establish-  
ed in 1728, that in the case of the King v. Woolston, 2 Stra. 834, the  
court would not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against  
Christianity was punishable in the temporal courts at common law.  
Wood, therefore, 409, ventures still to vary the phrase, and says, ‘ that all  
blasphemy and profaneness are offences by the common law,’ and cites 2  
Stra.—then Blackstone, in 1963, iv. 59, repeats the words of Hale, that  
‘ Christianity is part of the law of England,’ citing Ventris and Strange ;  
and finally, Lord Mansfield, with a little qualification, in Evans’s case in  
  
1767, says, that ‘ the essential principles of revealed religion are parts of  
  
the common law ;’ thus ingulfing Bible, Testament, and alt into the com-  
  
mon law, without citing any authority; and thus we find this chain of  
  
authorities hanging, link by link, one upon another, and all ultimately on  
one and the same hook; and that, a mistranslation of the words ‘ ancien  
scripture,’ used by Prisot. Finch quotes Prisot ; Wingate does the same ;  
Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch, and Wingate; Hale cites nobody; the  
court, in Woolston’s case, cites Hale; Wood cites Woolston’s case :  
Blackstone quotes Woolston’s case and Hale; and Lord Mansfield, like  
Hale, ventures it on his own authority. Here I might defy the best read  
lawyer to produce another scrap of authority for this judiciary forgery ;  
and I might go on further to show how some of the Anglo Saxon priests  
interpolated into the text of Alfred’s laws, the 20th, Qist, 22d, and 23d  
chapters of Exodus, and the 15th of the Acts of the Apostles, from the  
23d to the 29th verses; but this would lead my pen, and your patience,  
too far. What a conspiracy this, between church and state!!!”

With respect to our State nnd  
Federal Governments, 1 do not  
think their relations correctly  
understood by foreigners. They  
generally suppose the former  
subordinate to the latter. But  
this is not the case. They are  
co-ordinate departments of one  
simple and integral whole. To  
the State Governments are re­  
served all legislation and admi­  
nistration, in-affairs which con­  
cern their OWn PltlTOno i-kttlir  
and to the Federal Government  
is given whatever concerns fo­  
reigners, or the citizens of other  
States; these functions alone  
being made federal. The one  
is domestic, the other the for­  
eign branch of the same gov­  
crnment; neither having control  
over the other, but within its  
own department. There are  
one or two exceptions only to  
this partition of power. But,  
you may ask, if the two depart­  
ments should claim each the  
Bame subject of power, where is  
the common umpire to decide  
ultimately between them? In  
cases of little importance or ur­  
gency, the nrinl  
parties will keep them aloof  
i,T-V: 4u8iionable ground:  
but if u can neither be avoided  
  
nor compromised, a convention  
of the States must be culled, to  
ascribe the doubtful power to  
lhat department which they  
may think best. You will per­  
ceive by these details, that we  
have not yet so far perfected  
our constitutions as to venture  
to make them unchangeable.  
But still, in their present state,  
we consider them not otherwise  
changeable than bv the authori­  
ty of the people, on a special  
election of representatives for  
that purpose expressly: they  
aro until then the lex legnm.  
But can they be made un­  
changeable? Can one genera­  
tion bind another, and all oth­  
ers, in succession for ever I  
think not. The Creator has  
made the earth for the living,  
not the dead. Rights and pow­  
ers can only belong to persons,  
not to things, not to mere mat­  
ter, unendowed with will. The  
dead are not even things. The  
particles of matter which com­  
posed their bodies, make part  
now of the bodies of other ani­  
mals, vegetables, or minerals,  
of a thousand forms. To what  
then are attached the rights and  
powers they held while in the  
form of men! A generation  
may bind itself as long as its  
majority continues in life; when  
that has disappeared, another  
majority is in place, holds all  
the rights and powers their pre­  
decessors once held, and may  
change their laws and constitu­  
tions to suit themselves. No­  
thing then is unchangeable but  
  
the inherent and unalienable  
rights of man

#### 1835-06-01 &middot; [Philadelphia](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philadelphia)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
“I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction at length of the judiciary  
usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated  
declarations that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the con-  
trary which you have adduced is incontrovertible, to wit, that the common law existed  
while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans ; at a time when they had never i heard  
the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had existed. But it  
may amuse you to show, when and by what means they stole this law upon us.  
  
“In a case ‘quare impedit,’ in the Year Book, 34. H. 6. fo. 38 (1453), a question  
was made, how far the ecclesiastical law was to be respected in a common law  
court? And Prisot, C. 5., gives his opinion in these words: ‘ A tielx Leis que ils  
de Saint Eglise ont en ancien scripture, covient a nous a doner credence; car ceo  
common Ley, surquel touts mans leis sont fondes. Et auxy Sir, nous sumus obliges  
de conustre nostre ley. Et, Sir, si poit apperer a nous que l’evesque ad fait comme  
un ordinary fera en tiel cas, a dong nous devons ces adjuger bon, ou autrement  
nemy,’ &amp;¢. See S.C, Fitzh. Abr. qu: im. 89. Bro: Abr. qu: imp. 12. Fivcn, in  
his first book, c. 3. is the first afterwards who quotes this case, and misstates it  
thus :—‘ To such laws of the church as have warrant in holy scripture, our law  
giveth credence,’ and cites Prisot, mistranslating ‘ancien scripture’ into ‘holy  
scripture ;’ whereas Prisor palpably says, ‘to such laws as those of holy church  
have in ancient writing, it is proper for us to give credence;’ to wit, to their ancient  
written laws. This was in 1613, a century and a half after the dictum of Prisor.  
Wineare, in 1658, erects this false translation into a maxim of the common law,  
copying the words of Fincu, but citing Prisor. (Wingatis max. 3.) And Srepparp,  
tit. religion in 1675, copies the same mistranslation, quoting the Y. B., Finch and  
Wingate. Hate expresses it in these words; ‘Christianity is parcel of the laws of  
England.’ 1. Ventr. 293: 3. Keb. 607; but quotes no authority.  
  
“ By these echoings and re-echoings, from one to another, it had become so  
established in 1728, that in the case of the King vs. Woolston, 2 Str. 834, the court  
would not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against Christianity was punish-  
able in the temporal courts at common law! Woop, therefore, 409, ventures still  
to vary the phrase, and says, ‘that all blasphemy and profaneness are offences by  
the common law,’ and cites 2. Str.  
  
“Then Brackstong, in 1763, N. 59, repeats the words of Hale, that Christianity  
is part of the common law of England, citing Ventris and Strange; and finally,  
Lorp MansFizExp, with a little qualification, in Evans’ case, in 1767, says, ‘ that the  
essential principles of revealed religion are parts of the common law,’ thus engulph-  
ing bible, testament, and all, into the common law, without citing any authority.  
  
“ And thus far we find this chain of authorities hanging, link by link, one upon  
another, and all ultimately upon one and the same hook, and that a mistranslation  
of the words ‘ ancien scripture,’ used by Prisor. Fincn quotes Prisor; WinGate  
does the same: Snerrarp quotes Prisot, Fincn, and Wincare: Hace cites nobody;  
the court in Woolston’s case cites Hate; Woop cites Woolston’s case; BLACKSTONE  
quotes Woolston’s case and Hate; and Lorp Mansrizxp, like Hae, ventures it on  
his own authority.  
  
“ Here I might defy the best read lawyer to produce another scrip of authority  
for this judicial forgery; and I might go on further to show how some of the  
Anglo-Saxon clergy interpolated into the text of Alfred’s laws, the 20th, 21st, 22d, and  
23d chapters of Hoodies, and the 15th of the Acts of the Apostles, from the 23d to  
the 29th verse But this would lead my pen and your patience too far. What a  
conspiracy this between church and state!!!”

“T was glad to find, in your book, a formal contradiction, at  
length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers ; for such  
the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions that Christi-  
anity is a part of the common law. ” ” ad 9 But  
it may amuse you to show when, and by what means, they stole  
this law in upon us. In a case of quare impedit, in the year-book,  
34 H 6, fo. 38, (1458,) a question was made, how far he ecclesias-  
tical law was to be respected in a common lawcourt ? And Justice  
Prisot, e. 5, gives his opinion in these words :—  
  
“A tiel leis que ils de seint eglise ont en ancien scripture, convient  
&amp; nous a donner credence ; car ceo common ley sur quels touts  
manners leis sont fondés—et anxy, Sir, nous sumus obligs de  
conustre leur ley de saint eglise ; et semblablement ils sont obliges  
de conustre nostre ley et, Sir, si poit apperer or &amp; nous que  
l’evesque ad fait come un ordinary fera en tiel cas, adonq nous  
devons ceo adjuger bon, on auterment nemy.’ See S. C. Fitzher-  
bert’s Abr. qu. imp. 39. Brown’s Abr. qu. imp. 12. Finch, in his  
first book, c. 3, is the first afterwards who quotes this case, and  
misstates it thus, ‘ To such laws of the Church as have warrant in  
Holy Scripture our law giveth credence,’ and cites Prisot, mistrans-  
lating ‘ ancien scripture’ into ‘ holy scripture ;’ whereas Prisot pal-  
pably says, ‘tosuch laws as those of Holy Church have in ancient  
writing it is proper for us to give credence ;’ to wit, to their ancient  
written laws. This was in 1613, a century and a half after the  
dictum of Prisot. Wingate, in 1658, erects this false translation  
into a maxim of common law, copying the words of Finch, but  
citing Prisot. Wingate’s Maxims, 3; and Sheppard, tit. ‘ Reli-  
gion,’ in 1675, copies the same mistranslation, quoting the Year-  
Book, Fiuch and Wingate. Hale expresses it in these words,  
‘ Christanity is parcel of the laws of England.’ 1 Ventr, 293. 3  
Keble, 607, but quotes no authority. By these echoings and re-  
echoings from one to another, it had become so established in 1723,  
that in the case of the King v. Woolston, 2 Strange, 834, the court  
would not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against Christi-  
anity was punishable in the temporal courts at common law. Wood,

therefore, 409, ventures still to vary the phrase, and says, ‘ that all  
blasphemy and profaneness are offences by the common law,’ and  
cites 2 Strange. Then Blackstone, in 1763, IV. 59, repeats the  
words of Hale, that ‘Christianity is part of the law of England,’  
citing Ventris and Strange; and finally, Lord Mansfield, with a  
little qualification, in Evans’s case in 1767, says, ‘ that the essential  
principles of revealed religion are parts of the common law,’ thus  
engulphing Bible, Testament, and all, into the common law, with-  
out citing any authority. And thus we find this chain of authori-  
ties hanging link by link one upon another, and all ultimately on  
one and the same hook; and that a mistranslation of the words  
‘ancien scripture,’ used by Prisot. Finch quotes Prisot ; Wingate  
does the same; Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch, and Wingate ;  
Hale cites nobody ; the Court, in Woolston’s case, cites Hale; Wood  
cites Woolston’s case; Blackstone quotes Woolston’s case and  
Hale; and Lord Mansfield, like Hale, ventures it on his own  
authority. Here I might defy the best read lawyer to produce  
another scrap of authority for this judiciary forgery.”

&quot; With respect to our State and Federal  
Governments, I do not think their rela­  
tions are correctly understood by foreign­

&quot;subordinate to the latter. But thi ia not  
the case. They are co-ordinate depart  
ments ot one simple and integral whole.  
To, the State Governments are reserved  
all legislation and administration, in af

only, and to the Federal Government is  
given whatever concerns foreigners, or

of little importance or urgency, tBe pru

can neither be avoided nor compromised,  
a convention of the States must be called  
to ascribe the doubtful power to that de­

You will pgrceiyg by these details, that  
we have not yet eo perfected our Constitu­
