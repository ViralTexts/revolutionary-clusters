On the first notice of the storm which happened on the 22d of Jany and its effects, I intimated to the French Genl the possibility and importance of improving the oppertunity in an attempt upon Arnold. When I received a more certn acct of the total loss of  
the Culloden and dismasting of the Bedford two 74 Gun Ships belonging to the British Fleet at Gardners bay, I immediately put in motion—under comd of the Marqs de la Fayette—(as large a part of my small force here, as I could with prudence detach) to proceed to the head of  
Elk—and made with all expedition a proposal to the Count de Rochambeau &amp; the Chevalir Destouches for a co-operation in Virginia, with the whole of the fleet of our Allies, and a part of their land force.

The failure of this Expedition, (which was most flattering in the commencement of it) is much to be regretted; because a successful blow in that quarter, would, in all probability, have given a decisive turn to our Affairs in all the Southern States—Because  
it has been attended with considerable expence on our part, &amp; much inconvenience to the State of Virginia, by assembling its Militia—And because the World are disappointed at not seeing Arnold in Gibbets. above all, because we stood in need of something to keep us a
