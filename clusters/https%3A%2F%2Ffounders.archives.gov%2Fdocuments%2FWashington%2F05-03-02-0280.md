all the kingdoms of men, &amp; giveth the government thereof to whom he pleaseth; and such who thus govern in his fear) “shall be as the light of the morning when the Sun riseth even a morning without clouds; as the tender Grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.” how beautiful is such a situation! how comfortable to themselves, as well as affording refreshment to others; and how happy would this Country be if all the Rulers thereof were of this description! which I trust it will be thy desire to promote as much as may be in thy power.

mmandments, for this is the whole duty of man.” and in his book of Wisdom he begins with advice to those of the highest class—“Love Righteousness ye that be Judges of the earth; think of the Lord with a good heart, and in simplicity of heart seek him”—This appears to have been the fruit of his attention to the advice which his Father gave him, when a little before his decease he thus addressd him. “And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father and serve him with a perfect heart &amp; with a willing mind, for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou  
  
seek him he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off forever.” And being thus instructed, he became qualified to direct others unto the Fountain from whence all good comes; which he illustrates under the character of Wisdom, and represents her as speaking thus of herself—“By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice, by me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth—I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment; that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and I will fill their treasures.” Oh! how desirable is it that all who are placed in those exalted stations would endeavour to live under the influence of this Divine Wisdom; then there would be no room for the complaint which was made against some formerly, and I fear may too justly be applied to many even in this enlightened age of the world—“The leaders of the People cause them to err.” For so powerful is custom &amp; example, that people in inferior stations are prone to imi

ere he says “It shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, &amp; shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it; and many people shall say, come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the House of the God of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways, &amp; we will walk in his paths. And they shall beat their Swords into plowshares &amp; their Spears into pruninghooks Nation shall not lift up Sword against nation, neither shall they learn War any more.”) Yet I believe some in those dignified stations will be made Instruments for bringing about this blessed work, which in the Lord’s time will undoubtedly come to pass, agreeable to what is spoken by the same Prophet concerning the Church of Christ, “Kings shall be thy nursing Fathers, and their Queens thy nursing Mothers”  
  
and, “The Gentiles shall come to thy Light and Kings to the brightness of thy rising.” The Kingly prophet David had also a view of this Day, when he uttered this exhortation—“Be wise now therefore O ye Kings; be instructed ye Judges of the earth: serve the Lord with fear, &amp; rejoice with trembling kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way.”

I feel my mind influenced at this time with a degree of Gospel Love toward my fellow Citizens, desiring to invite them to gather unto Shiloh the peaceable Saviour; who was promised “to be given for a Light to the Gentiles and to be God’s Salvation to the end of the earth.” That they may come to sit every man under his Vine &amp; under his Fig tree, and none shall make them afraid”—For those who truly love &amp; fear the Lord have no need to fear what Man can do unto them.  
May the rulers of this Land in an especial manner have their dependance for Wisdom &amp; direction fixed on him who is “wonderful in Counsel &amp; excellent in working”—whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the Sons of men, to give every one according to his ways.” And may all their Councils be guided by that Wisdom which is from above—May their Decrees be in righteousness; and have a

son was Jehovah, the living Father. He came by his Word or  
spirit, and taught the prophets, what they should say or write.  
Had it been written “Jehovah came to Jeremiah saying,” —

inspiration. Among his last words are the following. ‘ The  
spirit of God spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.  
The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He  
that ruleth over men must be just.” 2 Sam. xxiii. 2,3. Here,  
if I mistake not, we have four different forms of expressing  
nearly the same thing. What is said, spoken, or done, by  
‘the spirit of the Lord,”’ or “ the Word,” is spoken or done by  
‘the God of Israel,”’ and by “the Rock of Israel.”” What more  
does the whole amount to than this, that David spoke as he was  
taught by God, or by the spirit of God?) Those who are fond  
of having a plurality of persons in the one God, may perhaps  
find four as clearly spoken of by David, as three are spoken of

LAST WORDS OF DAVID.  
  
David the son of Jesse said,  
  
And the man who was raised up on high,  
  
The auointed of the God of Jacob, ;  
  
And the sweet psalmist of Israel], said,  
  
The Spirit of the Lorn spake by me,  
  
And his word was in my tongue.  
  
The God of Israel said,  
  
The Rock of Israel spake to me,  
  
He that ruleth over men must be just,  
  
Ruling in the fear of God.  
  
And Ae shall be as the light of the morning, when the  
sun riseth,  
  
Even a morning without clouds;

dawn of observation the child is a learner, and  
it isa saying worthy of note, that “if parents  
neglect to fill the mind, the devil will put some-  
thing into it.”  
  
Parents often exhibit a deep concern for the  
temporal condition of their children, making it  
apparently their chief aim to exalt them to such  
positions in society as shall place them beyond the  
possibility of dependence and want, while they  
entirely neglect their spiritual welfare. How  
different is this from the legacy the dying mon-  
arch of ancient Israel left to Ais son. Hear him :  
“And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God  
of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart  
and with a willing mind, for the Lord searcheth  
all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations

First, “like a clear heat upon herbs.” The margin  
again says, “Like a clear heat after rain;” and I wish,  
says the excellent translator of Isaiah, who has adopted  
it, that there was better evidence in support of it. The  
reason is, that he probably feared, as others in reading it  
may fear, that “a clear heat upon herbs” would be  
rather unfavorable, and cause them to droop, if not to  
die. And this would be the case in some instances; but  
not in all; and it is enough for a metaphor to have one  
just and strong resemblance. Read the dying words of  
David: * And he shall be as the light of the morning,  
when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as  
the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear  
shining after rain.” Now after rain “the clear shining,”  
or “clear heat upon herbs,” would produce immediately  
fresh vigor and shootings. Even in our own climate the  
effect upon the grass and plants is soon visible; but in  
the East the influence is much more sudden and surpris-  
ing, and the beholders can almost see the herbage thrive  
and flourish. Thus the Lord can quicken his people  
in his ways, and strengthen in them the things tha
