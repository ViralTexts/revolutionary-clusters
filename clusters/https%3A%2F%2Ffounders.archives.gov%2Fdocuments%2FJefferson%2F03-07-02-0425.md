			 again we learn from  
			 the

			 If  
			 it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then will I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.”On examining our nations  
			 history and meditating on these sacred and  
			 important truths—I was led to conclude, that God! in his infinite wisdom, goodness, and mercy! had done great things for us as a people in Emancipating us from the A yoke of Tyranny and foreign domination and giving us a name and rank among the other nations of the Earth; but instead of these things, and a

bearing decisively on this subject. “ Say not in thy heart, Who

for his doctrine or religion.  
  
Of the facility with which he likewise can draw unauthor-

in this very passage. He goes on to quote. “‘ But what

There are two other passages of the New Testament in which the  
same principle is incontestabh’ contained. Rom. x. G, 7: “ Say not  
in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven ? (that is, to bring Christ  
down from above : Or, Who shall descend into the deep ? (that is, to  
bring up Christ again from the dead).” Both the one and the other  
are already accomplished, and the word of salvation is nigh in our

abyss which was the abode of beings invisible to us. This is necessarily  
implied. Kph. iv, 9 : “ Now that He ascended, what is it but that He  
also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?” 1 find that

PORTFOLIO. Christianity bears all the  
marks of a divine original; it came from  
heaven, and its gracious purpose is to  
carry us up thither. Its Author is God ;  
it was foretold from the biginning, by  
prophecies, which grew clearer and  
brighter as they approached the period  
of their accomplishment. It was  
confirmed by miracles which continued  
till the religion they illustrated was  
established. It was ratified by the  
blood of its Author; its doctrines are  
pure, sublime, consistent ; its precepts  
just and holy ! its worship is spiritual  
; its service reasonable, and rendered  
practicable by the offers of divine aid  
to humans weakness. It is sanctioned by  
the promise of eternal happiness to the  
faithful, and the threat or everlasting  
misery to the disobedient. It had no  
collusion with power, for power sought  
to crush it; it could not be in any  
league with the world for it set out by  
declaring itself the enemy of the world  
: it reprobated its maxims, it showed  
the vanity of its glories, the danger of  
its riches, the emptiness of its
