more vulnerable.  
The additional securities to republican government, to liberty and to property, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under consideration, consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation of the union will impose on local factions and insurrections, and on the ambition of powerful individuals in single states, who might acquire credit and influence enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the despots of the people; in the diminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue, which the dissolution of the confederacy would invite and facilitate; in the prevention of extensive military establishments, which could not fail to grow out of wars between the states in a disunited situation; in the express guarantee of a republican form of government to each; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles of nobility; and in the precautions against the repetition of those practices on the part of the state governments, which have undermined the foundations of property and credit, have planted mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens, and have occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals.  
Thus have I, my fellow citizens, executed the task I had assigned to myself; with what success, your conduct must determine. I trust at least you will admit, that I have not failed in the assurance I gave you respecting the spirit with which my endeavours should be conducted. I have addressed myself purely to your judgments, and have studiously avoided those asperities which are too apt to disgrace political disputants of all parties, and which have been not a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents of the constitution. The charge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people, which has been indiscriminately brought against the advocates of the plan, has something in it too wanton and too malignant not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his own bosom a refutation of the calumny. The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy, the well-born and the great, have been such as to inspire the disgust of all sensible men. And the unwarrantable concealments and misrepresentations which have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand the reprobation of all honest men. It is not impossible that these circumstance may have occasionally betrayed me into intemperances of expression which I did not intend: It is certain that I have frequently felt a struggle between sensibility and moderation, and if the former has in some instances prevailed, it must be my excuse that it has been neither often nor much.  
Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it, and whether it has not been shewn to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity. Every man is bound to answer these questions to himself, according to the best of his conscience and understanding, and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober dictates of his judgment. This is a duty, from which nothing can give him a dispensation. ’Tis one that he is called upon, nay, constrained by all the obligations that form the bands of society, to discharge sincerely and honestly. No partial motive, no particular interest, no pride of opinion, no temporary passion or prejudice, will justify to himself, to his country or to his posterity, an improper election of the part he is to act. Let him beware of an obstinate adherence to party. Let him reflect that the object upon which he is to decide is not a particular interest of the community, but the very existence of the nation. And let him remember that a majority of America has already given its sanction to the plan, which he is to approve or reject.

uaded, that it is the best which our political situation, habits and opinions will admit, and superior to any the revolution has produced.  
Concessions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a claim to absolute perfection, have afforded matter of no small triumph to its enemies. Why, say they, should we adopt an imperfect thing? Why not amend it, and make it perfect before it is irrevocably established? This may be plausible enough, but it is only plausible. In the first place I remark, that the extent of these concessions has been greatly exaggerated. They have been stated as amounting to an admission, that the plan is radically defective; and that, without material alterations, the rights and the interests of the community cannot be safely confided to it. This, as far as I have understood the meaning of those who make the concessions, is an intire perversion of their sense. No advocate of the measure can be found who will not declare as his sentiment, that the system, though it may not be perfect in every part, is upon the whole a good one, is the best that the present views and circumstances of the country will permit, and is such an one as promises every species of security which a reasonable people can desire.  
I answer in the next place, that I should esteem it the extreme of imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national affairs, and to expose the union to the jeopardy of successive experiments, in the chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan. I never expect to see a perfect work from imperfect man. The result of the deliberations of all collective bodies must necessarily be a compound as well of the errors and prejudices, as of the good sense and wisdom of the individuals of whom they are composed. The compacts which are to embrace thirteen distinct states, in a common bond of amity and union, must as necessarily be a compromise of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations. How can perfection spring from such materials?

iend to his country. There is however one point of light in which the subject of amendments still remains to be considered; and in which it has not yet been exhibited to public view. I cannot resolve to conclude, without first taking a survey of it in this aspect.  
It appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration, that it will be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the constitution. The moment an alteration is made in the present plan, it becomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new one, and must undergo a new decision of each state. To its complete establishment throughout the union, it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen states. If, on the contrary, the constitution proposed should once be ratified by all the states as it stands, alterations in it may at any time be affected by nine states. Here then the chances are as thirteen to nine

in favour of subsequent amendments, rather than of the original adoption of an intire system.  
This is not all. Every constitution for the United States must inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars, in which thirteen independent states are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions of interest. We may of course expect to see, in any body of men charged with its original formation, very different combinations of the parts upon different points. Many of those who form the majority on one question may become the minority on a second, and an association dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third. Hence the necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact; and hence also an immense multiplication of difficulties and casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act. The degree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number of particulars and the number of parties.  
But every amendment to the constitution, if once established, would be a single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. There would then be no necessity for management or compromise, in relation to any other point, no giving nor taking. The will of the requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. And consequently whenever nine

or rather ten states, were united in the desire of a particular amendment, that amendment must infallibly take place. There can therefore be no comparison between the facility of effecting an amendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a complete constitution

p any portion of the authority of which they were once possessed. For my own part I acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon mature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the organization of the government, not to the mass of its powers; and on this account alone, I think there is no weight in the observation just stated.

tion. Those who see the matter in the same light with me, however zealous they may be for amendments, must agree in the propriety of a previous adoption, as the most direct road to their own object.  
The zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the establishment of the constitution, must abate in every man, who, is ready to accede to the truth of the following observations of a writer, equally solid and ingenious: “To balance a large state or society (says he) whether monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so great difficulty, that no human genius, however comprehensive, is able by the mere dint of reason and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of many must unite in the work: EXPERIENCE must guide their labour: Time must bring it to perfection: And the FEELING of inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall into, in their first trials and experiments.”  
  
Hume’s Essays, vol. I, page 128.—The rise of arts and sciences.  
  
These judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the union, and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the states from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue, in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from TIME and EXPERIENCE. It may be in me a defect of political fortitude, but I acknowledge, that I cannot entertain an equal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer continuance in our present situation as imaginary. A NATION without a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT is, in my view, an awful spectacle. The establishment of a constitution, in time of profound peace, by the voluntary consent of a whole people, is a PRODIGY, to the completion of which I look forward with trembling anxiety. I can reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have, in so arduous an enterprise, upon seven out of the thirteen states; and after having passed over so considerable a part of the ground to recommence the course. I dread the more the consequences of new attempts, because I KNOW that POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS, in this and in other states, are enemies to a general national government, in every possible shape.

‘© This is not all. Every con-

inevitably confilt of a great variety

it tho extreme of imprudence to prolong the pre-

The zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the  
establishment &lt; f the Onstitution, must abate in  
every man, who is ready to accede to the truth of  
the &quot;following observations of a writer equally  
solid ami ingenious: &quot;To balance a large state or  
society, whether monarchical or republican, on  
general laws, is a work of so great difficulty, that  
human genius, however comprehensive, is  
able, by the mere dint of reason and retlociion,  
to effect it. The judgments of many must unite  
in the work; K.xr-KKiKXi E must guide their labor:  
timk must tiring it to perfection: and the kkki.-  
nra of inconveniences must correct the mistakes  
which they imri&#x27;ahly fall into, in their first  
trials and experiments.&quot;* These judicious re-  
flections contain a lesson of moderation to all  
the sincere lovers of the l&#x27;nion, and ought to  
put them upm their guard against hazard-  
ing anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation  
of the States from each other, and perhapt  
the military despotism of a victorious demagogue,  
in the pursuit of what they ire not likely to ob-  
tain, but from timk and f.xi&#x27;Kkikm k. It may  
be in me a defect of political fortitude, but I  
acknowledge that I cannot entertain an equal  
-tranquilitv with those who affect to treat thedan-  
gers of a longer continuance In our prasent situa-

tion will, how-ever, be a matter  
more for the Conven-tion rather than the  
Legislatures to deal with. What will  
perhaps cause more discussion is the  
proposal to almost ignore the latter  
bodies of the different colonies in  
dealing with the work of federation. But  
this position has been forced upon the  
people by politicians themselves, and  
there is much to be said in its favour.  
Members of a convention are more free  
than members of Parliament. They are not  
tied by party lines, and are not com-  
pelled to study the idiosyncracies of  
their constituents. David Hume in one of  
his essays remarks that &quot; to balance a  
large state or society, whether

that no human genius, however  
comprehensive, is able by the mere dint

The judgments of many must uimite in the

takes which they inevitably fall into in

tion of the Constitution to admit that it  
may have been drawn from the accumu­  
lated wisdom of many generations. An  
instrument based upon natural rights must  
have drawn its inspiration from the past,  
because its principles have been coeval  
with man as an intelligent animal.  
  
The framers of the Constitution were  
very familiar with the fundamental laws  
of Great Britain and with the writings  
of contemporary critics. It was, in fact,  
an instrument of compromises, and this  
was perfectly well recognized by its  
anthors. Hamilton observed of it in the  
Federalist of 178: &quot;The result of the de­  
liberations of all collective bodies must  
necessarily be a compound as well of the  
errors and prejudices as of the good sense  
and wisdom of the individuals of whom  
they are composed. The compacts which  
are to embrace thirteen states in a cor­  
mon bond of amity and union must as  
necessarily be a compromise of as many  
dissimilar interests and inclinations. How  
can perfection spring from such ma­

paper, the Australian Federalist, which  
must be a powerful aid in the campaign.  
Mr Bruce Smith, writing in it, quotes  
Hamilton, the real author of the  
American constitution, as follows:-&quot;  
Concessions on the part of the friends  
of the plan, that it has not a claim to  
abEolute perfection, have afforded  
matter of no small triumph to enemies.  
Why, say they, should we adopt an im.  
perfect thing ? Why not amend it, and  
make it perfect before it is irrevocab&#x27;y  
astablished ? This may be plausible, but  
it is plausible only. In the first  
place, I remark that the extent of these  
concessions has been greatly  
exaggerated. They have been stated as  
amounting to an admission that the plan  
is radically defective, and that,  
without materisl alterations, the rights  
and interests of the community cannot  
safely be cpnfided to it. This, as far  
as I haSe understood the meaning of  
those who make the oonceesins, is an  
entire perversion of their sense. 1 o  
advocate of the measure can be found who  
will net declare as his sentiment that  
the syatem-though it may not be perfect  
in every part-is, upon the whole, a good

and circumstances of the copntry will  
permit, and is such a one as promisps
