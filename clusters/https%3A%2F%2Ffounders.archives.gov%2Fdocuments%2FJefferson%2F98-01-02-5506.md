An application from young gentlemen of the Univty for the appropriation of a room wherein they might recieve instruction in the use of the small sword having led me to the consideration of that subject previously to the reciept of your letter of yesterday, I inclose you my answer to them, which I pray you to recieve as equally an answer to yourself.The other part of your request, for the use of a room for instructing them in the art of dancing, stands on more favorable ground. it’s object, is the embellishment, and not the destruction, of the lives of our young citizens, and the Visitors seem to have provided for it in the statute which enacts that one of the  elliptical rooms on the middle floor of the Rotunda shall be used for ‘schools of instruction in drawing, music or any other of the innocent and ornamental accomplishments of life.’ dancing is generally, and justly I think, considered among innocent accomplishments; while we cannot so consider the art of stabbing and pistolling our friends, or dexterity in the practice of an instrument exclusively used for killing our fellow-citizens only and never against the public enemy. dancing therefore will be admissible in the way of private lessons in one of those rooms, so soon as finished; but not being so as yet, it would be premature now to decide on the order of preferences which should be established among their different uses, when claimed simultaneously for more than one, or to prescribe regulations for their preservation while in use. Be pleased to accept assurances of my great esteem and respect.Th: Jefferso

dancing are given in some old letters which have just  
been published in The St Louts Eepublican. He wrote  
them in 1825, in response to a request to have rooms set  
apart in the University of Virginia for instruction in the  
use of the small sword, and in dancing. He refused to  
grant the first part of the request, and added: &quot;The  
other part of your request, for the use of a room for in­  
structing them in the art of dancing stands on a more  
favorable ground. Its object is the embellishment and  
not the destruction of the lives of our young citizens, and  
the visitors seem to have provided for it in the st  
which enacts that one of the elliptical rooms on the mid  
dle floor of the rotunda shall be used for schools of  
struction in drawing, musle, or any otner of the inocent  
and ornamental accomplishments of life. Dancing is  
and justly, I think--considered among inno  
cent accomplishments; while we cannot so consider the  
art of stabbing and pistoling our friends, or dexterity in  
tice of an instrument exclusively used for killing  
our fellow-citizens only, and never against the public  
enemy. Dancing, therefore, will be admissible in the  
ay of private lessons in one of those rooms, so soon as  
finished; but not being so as yet, it would be pr  
now to decide on the order of preferences which sho  
lished among their different use when claimed  
han oue, or to preseribe regula  
for their preservation while in use.

MONTICELLO,  
September 1, 1825.  
MR. XAuPI-Sir: An application  
from two young gentlemen of the  
University for the appropriation of a  
room!, wherein they might receive in­  
struction in the use of the small  
sword, having led the to the consid­  
eration of that subject previously to  
the receipt of your letter of yester  
day, I inclose you my answer to them,  
which I pray you to receive as equal­  
ly an answer to yourself. The other  
part of your request for the use of a  
room for instructing them in the art  
of dancing stands on a more favora­  
ble ground. &#x27;Its&#x27;object &#x27;is the embel­  
lishment and not the destruction of  
the lives of our young citizens, and  
the visitors seem to have provided  
for it in the statute which enacts that  
one of the elliptical rooms on the  
middle floor of the rotunda shall be  
used for schools of instruction in  
drawing, music, or any other of the  
innocent and ornamental accomplish­  
ments of life. Dancing is generally  
-and justly, I think-considered  
among innocent accomplishments;  
while we cannot so consider the art  
of stabbing and pistoling our friends,  
or dexterity in the practice of an in­  
strument exclusively used for killing  
our fellow-citizens only, and never  
against the public enemy. Dancing,  
therefore, will be admissible in the  
way of private lessons in one of those  
rooms as soon as finished; but not  
being so as yet it would be premature  
now to decide on the order of prefer­  
ences which should be established  
among their different use when  
claimed simultaneously for more  
than one, or to prescribe regulations  
for their preservation while in use.  
Be pleased to accept assurances of  
-my great esteem and respect.  
Trios. JEFFERSON
