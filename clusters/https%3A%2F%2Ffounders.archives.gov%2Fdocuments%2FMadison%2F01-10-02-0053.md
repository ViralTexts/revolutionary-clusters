Federal Convention of 1787 (4 vols.; New Haven, 1911–37)., I, 554).  
  
  
Paterson’s version:  
  
  
“Madison.  
  
  
“1. The Upper Branch may put a Veto upon the Acts of the lower Branch.  
  
  
“2. may extort a Concurrence. The smaller States near the Centre; they may compose a Majority of the Quorum” (Ms [DLC: Paterson Papers]).  
  
  
  
  
  
[9 July 1787]  
  
Paterson objected to counting slaves in apportioning representation, noting that “if Negroes are not represented in the States to which they belong, why should they be represented in the Genl. Govt.” He defined representation as “an expedient by which an assembly of certain individls. chosen by the people is substituted in place of the inconvenient meeting of the people themselves” (Farrand, RecordsMax Farrand, ed., The Records of the  
Federal Convention of 1787 (4 vols.; New Haven, 1911–37)., I, 561).  
  
  
Mr. Madison reminded Mr. Patterson that his doctrine of Representation which was in its principle the genuine one, must for ever silence the pretensions of the small States to an equality of votes with the large ones. They ought to vote in the same proportion in which their citizens would do, if the people of all the States were collectively met. He suggested as a proper ground of compromise, that in the first branch the States should be represented according to their number of free inhabitants; and in the 2d. which had for one of its primary objects the guardianship of property, according to the whole number, including slaves.

Madison, indeed, reminded Mr. Paterson that his principle  
of representation ‘ must for ever silence the pretensions of -  
the small States.’* He was, in fact, bound to find out  
some other principle of representation, or else give up his  
advocacy of the equality of the States in the new Union,  
as well as his opposition to the representation of slaves.  
  
In regard to this contest in the Convention of 1787, a  
recent writer observes: ‘Should the South have as many  
representatives, in proportion to its population, as the  
North? It was just and right that she should. The slaves  
were a better population than the free negroes, and if th

 suggested  
a uniform rule, but it was one that would  
scarcely alter the political weight of the  
North, while it would vastly increase the  
weight of the South; and it would in-  
crease it most in just the quarter where  
slavery was most deeply rooted. The  
power of South Carolina, as a member  
of the Union, would be trebled by such  
a measure. Hence the Northern dele-  
gates maintained that slaves, as chattels,  
ought no more to be reckoned as part  
of the population than houses or ships.  
“Has a. man in Virginia,” exclaimed  
Paterson, “‘ a number of votes in propor-  
tion to the number of his slaves? And
