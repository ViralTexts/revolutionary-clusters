To the Senate &amp;  
House of Representatives of the US.  
Jan. 17. 1806.  
  
In my message to both houses of Congress at the opening of their present session, I submitted to their  
attention, among other subjects, the oppression of our commerce &amp; navigation by the irregular practices of armed vessels  
public &amp; private, &amp; by the introduction of new principles, derogatory of the rights of Neutrals, &amp; unacknoleged by  
the usage of nations.  
The memorials of several bodies of merchants of the US. are now communicated, &amp; will develope these  
principles &amp; practices, which are producing the most ruinous effects on our lawful commerce &amp; navigation.  
The right of a Neutral to carry on commercial intercourse with every part of the dominions of a belligerent,  
permitted by the municipal laws of the country (with the exception of blockaded ports &amp; Contraband of war) was believed  
to have been decided between Great Britain &amp; the US. by the sentence of their Commissioners mutually appointed to decide  
on that &amp; other questions of difference between the two nations; &amp; by the actual paiment of the damages awarded by  
them against Great Britain for the infractions of that right. when therefore it was percieved that the same principle was  
revived, with others more novel, &amp; extending the injury, instructions were given to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the  
US. at the court of London, &amp; remonstrances duly made by him on this subject, as will appear by documents transmitted  
herewith. these were followed by a partial &amp; temporary suspension only, without any disavowal of the principle. he has  
therefore been instructed to urge this subject anew, to bring it more fully to the bar of reason, &amp; to insist on rights  
too evident, &amp; too important to be surrendered. in the mean time the evil is proceeding under adjudications founded on  
the principle which is denied. under these circumstances the subject presents itself for the consideration of Congress.  
On the impressment of our Seamen, our remonstrances have never been intermitted. a hope existed, at one  
moment, of an arrangement which might have been submitted to. but it soon passed away, &amp; the practice, tho’ relaxed at  
times in the distant seas, has been constantly pursued in those in our neighborhood. the grounds on which the reclamations  
on this subject have been urged will appear in an extract from instructions to our Minister at London, now communicated.

In my message to both Houses of Con-

I submitted to their attention, among other  
subjects, the oppression of our commerce  
and navigation, by the regular practices of  
armed ‘vesSels, public and private, and by  
the introduction of new principles, deroga-  
tory of the rights of neutrals, and unacknow-  
ledged by the usage of nations—-The me-  
morials of several bodies of merchants of  
the United States are now commupicated,  
and will develope these principles and prac-  
tices, which are producing the most ruinous  
effects on our lawful commerce and naviga-  
tion. —The right of a neutral to carry on  
commercial. intercourse with every part of  
the dominions of a belligerent, permitted by  
the laws of the country. (with the exception  
of blockaded ports, and contraband of war)  
was believed to have been decided between  
Great Britain and the United States, by the  
sentence of their commissioners, mutually  
appointed to decide on that and other ques-  
  
_ tions of difference between the two nations ;  
  
and by the actual payment of the damages
