/fThe sales of the public lands in lim­  
ited quantities to actual settlers only,  
was proposed by the President of the  
United States in his annual message to  
Congress of December, 1832. In that  
message the President recommended  
that the public lands, at moderate pri­  
ces, &quot;should be sold to settlers in li­  
mited parcels. A sale for settlement  
only, and not for speculation, is eer­  
tainly most conformable to the great  
purposes for which these lands were  
ceded to the General Governments  
  
The great object for which Virginia  
ceded the northwestern territory is, as  
declared by her act of cession, that the  
territory so ceded &quot;should be laid out  
and formed into States, containing a  
suitable extent of territory, not less  
than 100 nor more than 150 mi les square,  
or as near theretoascircu instances would  
admit and the States so formed,  
should be distinct republican States,  
and admitted members of the Federal

On the 1st day of March, 1781. tho delega­  
tion in Congress from Virginia executed her  
deed of cession of her territory northwest of  
the river Ohio, in which she coded to the United  
States &#x27; ali of her right, title, and claim, as we&#x27;l  
of soil as of juris Jiclion;&quot; but stipulated &quot;that

The provision in relation to the protection  
of their property is inserted ar abundanti can­  
tiln. The result would be the same whether  
it was inserted in this article or not; but no  
matter for that--it was inserted. What was  
provided was, that they should become a part  
of the United States, and be admitted into  
Union at a proper time, according to the terms  
of the Constitution, and in the mean while  
should be protected in their persons, property  
and religion.  
Let us now l ook at the grant from Virgin­  
ia. It is a grant to the United States &quot;as  
well of soil as of jurisdiction, upon condi­  
tion that  
&quot;The territory so ceded shall be laid out in States of  
convenient size?  
describing them--not exceeding so many, &quot;or  
as near thereto as circumstances will admit&quot;  
And that the States so formaed shall be distinet io  
fttel e I  
publican States, and admitted members of the Federal  
Union, having the same rights of sovereignty, freedom,  
and independence as the other States.&quot;  
  
The grant was made in the year 1784; and  
all the inhabitants then in that Territory were  
there at the few French settlements which had  
been taken by the expedition under General  
  
Clarke, established there before the treaty ofing  
  
1963. It is further provided:  
&quot;The French and Canadian inhabitants and other set­  
tlers of Kaskaskia, and of St. Vincennes and the neigh­  
boring village, who have professed themselves citizens of  
Virginia, shall have their possessions and titles confirm­  
ed to them, and be protected in the enjoyment of their  
rights and liberties.  
Now we see the features of the two grants.  
The grant was of the territory, its soil, and  
the entire sovereignty, in both cases, on the

crowns the triumphant march of liberty and

Nor did our Southern brethren deem this  
anti-slavery restriction a disability, nor sub

of the future States.  
Virginia, in making a quit-claim to the

the States to be made out of it should be

One of these conditions was that all the re­

In considering and accepting this grand do­

reported as follows in regard to this require­

January, 1781, that the general assembly  
of Virginia resolved to yield to the United

that state had ‘to the lands northwest of  
the River Ohio, on condition (1) that she

by which the old Confederacy acquired dominion and estab-  
lished government in the great region between the Alleghanies  
and the Mississippi. In 1784 Virginia took the first formal step  
toward settling the disputes that had long raged about this ter-  
ritory. All her claim to lands northwest of the Ohio river

United States, and because Congress could not guarantee to that  
State the tract claimed by it in its act of cession; and that the  
petition of the companies be dismissed.  
  
On the 11th September, 1785, Congress, after discussion, voted  
to accept the cession without the condition proposed by Virginia  
that the United States should guarantee to that State all the terri-  
tory between the Atlantic Ocean, the southeast side of the river  
Ohio, and the Maryland, Pennsylvania and North Carolina boun-

Finally, on the Ist March, 1784, the deed of c2ssion was pre-
