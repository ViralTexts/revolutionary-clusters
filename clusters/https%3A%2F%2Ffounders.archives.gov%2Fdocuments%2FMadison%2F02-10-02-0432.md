Sir,  
New Orleans October 24th. 1805  
  
I am sorry to inform you of the embarrassments to which the Citizens of the United States are subjected who navigate the Mobile River. All american Vessels passing by the Town of Mobile, are brought to and a duty of   per cent exacted both on imports and Exports. These duties are even required on Articles passing to and from the Garrisons and Factories of the United States. I have addressed on this occasion, a Letter to Mr. Morales, by whom it is said this proceeding was Authorized, but in his answer, which was this morning received, he professes to be unacquainted with the particulars, and declines any interference until he should advise upon the subject with the Governor of West Florida.  
I have certain information of the arrival at Pensacola of four hundred troops from Havana and that a much larger number is daily expected. I also learn from a source entitled to credit that three hundred men are ordered from Pensacola to Baton Rouge and that eight hundred Spanish troops have lately been posted on the frontier of the Province of Taxus. It is a fact known to me that a Spanish Agent has contracted with a Merchant of this City for the delivery at the Town of Mobille of four thousand barrels of flour and that this same Agent not being able to effect a contract for the delivery of four thousand pair of shoes at Mobille, has purchased a quantity of leather. The Marquis of Casa Calvo being absent from this City it is my intention to enquire of Governor Folch an explanation of the object of these military movements. I flatter myself that Hostilities between the United States and Spain may be avoided and that an honorable adjustment of our differences may ensue. But I am inclined to think that the Spanish Agents calculate on a Speedy rupture and are making all the preparations which their means permit to commence the War in this quarter to advantage. New orleans would unquestionably be the first object of attack and with a view to its security I should be pleased to see Fort St. John repaired and put in a state of defence; that fort commands the mouth of the Bayou St. John and if strengthened would present a great impediment to the passage of troops from Pensacola and Mobille by the way of the lakes to this City at present the works are in ruins but might readily be repaired and made defensible without any considerable expenditure. I have communicated to Colonel Freeman the officer Commanding here my Ideas of the importance of Fort St. John but he does not agree with me in opinion and Says further that, he has not the means of strengthening any fort. If our differences with Spain sho

HISTORY OF THE PASSING TIMES.  
  
(Continued from Vol. 3—No. 1—p. 65.)  
  
ieee 3 part of the President’s message, which was _per-  
mitted to be revealed unto the people, related, chiefly,  
to documents, which stated the aggressions, that had been  
made upon our commerce by the French and Spaniards ; and  
also, the hostile and insolent conduct of the Spaniards on the  
borders of our newly acquired territory in Louisiana. A let-  
ter, from Gov. Claibourne to the Secretary of State, dated  
New-Orleans, October 24th, 1805 ; states, that all the citi-  
zens of the United States, who navigate the river Mobile,  
are grievously harrassed ; that all American vessels, which pass  
by the town of Mobile, are brought to, and compelled to pay a  
heavy duty, both onimports and exports, and that these du-  
ties are even exacted on all the articles, which pass to and  
from the factories and the garrisons of the United States.  
  
Governor Claibourne wrote to Mr. Morales, onthis subject,  
as the person who had been supposed to authorise these un-  
warrantable proceedings ; but Mr. Morales, in his answer,  
declares his utter ignorance of all these matters, and declines to  
interpose any interference on his part, until he should have  
communicated with the Governor of West Florida, upon the  
circumstances submitted to his consideration.  
  
Governor Claibourne proceeds to state the arrival of four  
hundred troops at Pensacola from Havanna, and the daily ex-  
pectation of the coming of a much larger number of soldiery.  
And that three hundred men are ordered from Pensacola to  
Baton Rouge, and that eight hundred Spanish troops had  
been lately posted on the frontier of the Province of Taxus ;  
that a Spanish agent had contracted witha merchant of New-  
Orleans for the delivery, at the town of Mobile, of four thou-  
sand barrels of flour, and in consequence of not being able to ef-

fect a contract for the delivery of four thousand pair of shoes,  
at Mobile, had purchased a quantity of leather ; that the Span-  
ish agents calculate ona speedy rupture between Spain and  
the United States, and are making all the preparations in their  
power, to commence the war in that quarter, to advantage ;  
that New-Orleans would be the first object of attack, and in  
order to be rendered secure, required Fort St. John to be put in-  
toa state of defence ; because that fort commands the mouth  
of the Bayon, and, if strengthened, would present a great  
impediment to the passage of troops from Pensacola and Mo-  
bile, by the way of the lakes, to that city ; the works are, now,  
zn ruins, but might be readily repaired, and put into a state  
of defence, without much expenditure of the public money.
