evidently an authoritative com-  
munication of spiritual powers, in  
a miraculous manner; and this  
too to a man, who had the spirit

account is in Lev. xvi. 21. ‘‘ And  
Aaron shall lay both his hands on

we read in Lev. VII:&quot;&quot;The life of

make an atonement for your souls;  
for it is the blood that maketh an

But before we dismiss this part of

teaches the same truth. While the

arged. The transmutation  
must be located somewhere between the time that the sin-offer-  
ing is brought to the altar, and its death at the hands of the sin-  
ner. If so, then the act of transmutation was the laying on of  
the hands of the sinner on the head of his offering. As to this  
there can be no question. What, then, is the meaning or signifi-  
cance of this imposition of hands?  
  
In the ceremony of the Annual Atonement the “scape goat”  
was one of its essential elements, and the part it played in that  
atonement threw no little light on the subject. Aaron was di-  
rected to lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and con-  
fess over him all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, and all  
their transgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of
