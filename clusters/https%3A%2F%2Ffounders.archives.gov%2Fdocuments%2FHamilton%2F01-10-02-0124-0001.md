[To the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
  
Pursuant to the order of the House of Representatives of the first of November 1791, directing the Secretary of the Treasury, “to report to the House the amount of the Subscriptions to the loans proposed by the act making provision for the Public Debt, as well in the debts of the respective States as in the domestic debt of the United States, and of the parts which remain unsubscribed, together with such measures as are, in his opinion, expedient to be taken on the subject”: the said Secretary respectfully submits the following Report:

concerning which some further arrangement is necessary.  
The greatest part of the registered Debt, hitherto unsubscribed, is owned by the Citizens of foreign countries, most, if not all of whom appear now disposed to embrace the terms held out by the act abovementioned; extensive orders having been received from those creditors, to subscribe to the Loan, after the time for receiving subscriptions had elapsed.  
A considerable part of the outstanding or floating debt, consists of Loan Office Certificates issued between the first of September 1777 and the first of March 1778, bearing interest on the nominal sum. Many of the holders of this species of debt have come in upon the terms of the act, but others have hitherto declined it; alledging, that the special nature of their contract gives a peculiarity to their case, and renders the commutation proposed not so fair an equivalent to them, as in other instances. They also complain, that the act has had, towards them, a compulsory aspect, by refusing the temporary payment of interest, unless they should exchange their old for new certificates, essentially varying the nature of their contract.  
A resolution of Congress of the tenth of September 1777 stipulates in favour of this class of creditors, interest upon the nominal, instead of the real principal of their debt, until that principal be discharged. This certainly renders their contract of a nature more beneficial than that of other creditors; but they are at the same time liable to be divested of the extra-benefit it gives them, by a payment of their Specie-dues; and it may be observed, that they have actually enjoyed, and by accepting the terms offered to them were enabled to realise, advantages superior to other creditors. They have been paid interest by bills on France, from the tenth of September 1777 to the first of March 1782, while other creditors received their interest in depreciated bills of the old emissions; and the terms of the loan proposed put it in their power to realise the benefit of interest on the nominal amount of their respective debts at rates from 6 20/100 nearly to 10 47/100 per cent on their real or specie capital down to the last of December 1790.  
It does not therefore appear to have been an unreasonable expectation, that they, as readily as any other description of public creditors, would have acquiesced in a measure, calculated for the accommodation of the Government, under circumstances, in respect to which, it has been demonstrated by subsequent events that the accommodation desired was consistent with the best interest of the public creditors. A large proportion of the parties interested have indeed viewed the matter in this light, and have embraced the proposition. It is probable, that the progress of things will satisfy the remainder, that it is equally their interest to concur; if a further opportunity be afforded. But it is, nevertheless, for themselves only to judge, how far the equivalent proposed is, in their case, a reasonable and fair one; how far any circumstances in their claim may suggest reasons for moderation on their part; or how far any other motives, public or private, ought to induce an acceptance. And the principles of good faith require, that their election should be free.  
On this ground, the complaint which regards the withholding of a temporary payment of interest, except on the condition of a surrender of the old certificates for new ones importing a contract substantially different, appears to the Secretary not destitute of foundation. He presumes, that the operation of that provision, in the particular case was not adverted to; or, that an exception would have been introduced as most consonant with the general spirit and design of the Act. Accordingly, the further measures which will be submitted, will contemplate a method of obviating the objection in question.  
From the consideration, that an extension of the time for receiving subscriptions, upon the terms of the Act making provision for the Debt of the United States, is desired by a large proportion of the non-subscribing creditors, and from the further consideration, that sufficient experience has not yet been had of the productiveness of a considerable branch of the Revenues which have been established, to afford the light necessary to a final arrangement—It is, in the judgment of the Secretary, adviseable, to renew the proposition for a loan in the Domestic Debt, on the same terms with the one which has been closed, and to allow time for receiving subscriptions to it until the last day of September next inclusively; making provision for the temporary payment of interest to such who may not think fit to subscribe, for the year 1792, of the like nature with that which was made in the same case for the year 1791—Except as to the holders of Loan Office Certificates, issued between the first of September 1777 and the first of March 1778; in respect to whom it is submitted as proper to dispense with the obligation of exchanging their old certificates for new, as the condition of their receiving interest in capacity of non-subscribers; and to allow them, without such exchange, to receive the same interest, both for the year 1791 &amp; 1792 as if they had subscribed to the first Loan. It will not be materially difficult, so to regulate the operation at the Treasury as to avoid in the particular case, that danger of imposition by counterfeits, which was the motive to the general provision for an exchange of certificates.  
II. The amount of the subscriptions in the debts of the respective States, within the limits of the sum assumed in each, appears by the statement marked D to be Dollars 17,072,334.39 Cents, subject to the observations accompanying that statement. Consequently the difference between the aggregate of the sums subscribed, and the aggregate of the sums assumed, is Dollars 4,427,665.61 Cents. This difference is to be attributed to several causes; the principal of which are the following. First; That the sums assumed in respect to certain States exceeded the actual amount of their existing debts. Second; That in various instances, a part of the existing debt was in a form which excluded it from being received, without contravening particular provisions of the Law; as in the case of certificates issued after the first day of January 1790 in lieu of certificates which had been issued prior to that period, which was reported upon by the Secretary on the twenty fifth day of february last. Third; Ignorance of, or inattention to the limitation of time for receiving subscriptions. It appears, that a number of persons lost the opportunity of subscribing from the one or the other of these causes.  
A strong desire that a further opportunity may be afforded for subscriptions in the debts of the States, has been manifested by the Individuals interested. And the States of Rhode Island and New Hampshire, have, by the public Acts referred to the Secretary, indicated a similar desire. The affording of such further opportunity, may either be restricted within the limit, as to amount, which is contemplated by the Act itself; or may receive an extension which will embrace the residuary debts of the States.  
The first may be considered as nothing more than giving full effect to a measure already adopted.  
  
The last appears to have in its favour all the leading inducements to what has been already done. The embarassments which might arise from conflicting systems of finance are not entirely obviated. The efficacious command of the National resources for National exigencies is not unequivocally secured. The equalizing of the condition of the citizens of every State, and exonerating those of the States most indebted, from partial burthens which would press upon them in consequence of exertions in a common cause, is not completely fulfilled, until the entire debt of every State, contracted in relation to the war is embraced in one general and comprehensive plan. The inconvenience to the United States of disburthening the States, which are still incumbered with considerable debts, would bear no proportion to the inconvenience which they would feel, if left to struggle with those debts, unaided.  
More general contentment, therefore, in the public mind, may be expected to attend such an exoneration, than the reverse; in proportion as the experience of actual inconvenience would be greater, though only applicable to parts, in the one, than in the other case.  
With regard to States, parts only of the debts of which have been assumed, and in proportions short of those, which have prevailed, in favour of other states, and short also of what would have resulted from a due apportionment of the entire sum assumed; the claim to a further assumption is founded on considerations of equal justice, as relative to the measure itself, considered in a separate and independent light.  
But there is a further reason of material weight for an immediate general assumption. Monied men, as well foreigners as citizens, through the expectation of an eventual assumption, or that in some shape or other a substantial provision will be made for the unassumed residue of the State Debts, will be induced to speculate in the purchase of them. In proportion as the event is unsettled, or uncertain, the price of the article will be low, and the present proprietors will be under disadvantage in the sale. The loss to them in favour of the purchasers is to be regarded as an evil; and as far as it is connected with a transfer to foreigners, at an undervalue, it will be a national evil. By whatsoever authority an ultimate provision may be made, there will be an absolute loss to the community equal to the total amount of such undervalue.  
It may appear an objection to the measure, that it will require an establishment of additional funds by the Government of the United States. But this does not seem to be a necessary consequence. The probability is, that without a supplementary assumption, an equal or very nearly equal augmentation of funds will be requisite to provide for greater balances in favour of certain States; which would be proportionably diminished by such assumption. The destination, not the quantum of the fund, will therefore be the chief distinction between the two cases.  
It may also appear an objection to a total assumption, that the magnitude of the object is not ascertained with precision. It is not certainly known, what is the sum due in each State; nor has it been possible to acquire the information, owing to different causes. But though precise data are deficient, there are materials which will serve as guides. From the returns received at the Treasury, assisted by information in other ways, it may be stated without danger of material error—That the remaining debts of the States over and above the sums already subscribed will not exceed the amounts specified in the statement D accompanying this report—And that, including the sums already subscribed, the total amount to be ultimately provided for, in the event of a general assumption, will not exceed 25,403,362 ⁷¹⁄₁₀₀ Dollars, which would constitute an addition of 3,903,362, ⁷¹⁄₁₀₀ Dollars to the sum of 21,500,000 Dollars already assumed.  
Should a total assumption be deemed eligible, it may still be adviseable to assign a determinate sum for each State, that the utmost limit of the operation may be preestablished; and it is necessary in order to the certainty of a due provision in proper time, that interest should not begin to be payable, on the additional ⟨sums⟩ assumed, till after the year 1792.  
  
⟨It will oc⟩cur, that provision has been made, for paying to eac⟨h St⟩ate, in trust for its non-subscribing creditors, an interest upon the difference, between the sum assumed for such State, and that actually subscribed, equal to what would have been payable, if it had been subscribed.  
In the event of a further assumption, either within the limits already established, or commensurate with the remaining debts of the States, it is conceived, that it will not be incompatible with the provision just mentioned, to retain, at the end of each quarter, during the progress of the further subscription, out of the money directed to be paid to each State, a sum corresponding with the interest upon so much of its debts as shall have been subscribed to that period, paying the overplus, if any, to the State. An absolute suspension of that payment does not appear consistent with the nature of the stipulation, included in that provision; for though the money to be paid to a State be expressly a trust for the nonsubscribing creditors; yet as it cannot be certain beforehand, that they will elect to change their condition, the possibility of it, will not justify a suspension of payment to the State, wh⟨ich⟩ might operate as a suspension of payment to ⟨the creditors⟩ themselves.  
A further ob⟨ject⟩ion to such a suspension results from the idea, that the provision in question appears to have a secondary object; namely, as a pledge for securing a provision for whatever balance may be found due to a State on the general settlement of accounts. The payment directed to be made to a State, is “to continue until there shall be a settlement of accounts between the United States and the Individual States, and in case a balance should then appear in favour of a State, until provision shall be made for the said balance.”  
This secondary operation as a pledge or security (consistently with the intent of the funding Act) can only be superseded in favour of the primary object, a provision for the creditors; and as far as may be necessary to admit them to an effectual participation of it. But as whatever money may be paid to a State, is to be paid over to its creditors, proportional deductions may, with propriety, be made from the debts of those Creditors who may hereafter subscribe; so as that the United States may not have to pay twice for the same purpose.  
If it shall be judged expedient, either to open ag⟨ain, or exte⟩nd the assumption, it will be necessary to vary the description of the debts, which may be subscribed, so as to comprehend all those, which have relation to services or supplies during the war, under such restrictions as are requisite to guard against abuse.  
In the original proposition for an assumption of the State Debts, and in the suggestions now made on the same subject, the Secretary has contemplated, and still contemplates, as a material part of the plan, an effectual provision, for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States. He has considered this resource, as an important mean of sinking a part of the debt, and facilitating ultimate arrangements concerning the residue. If supplementary funds shall be rendered necessary, by an additional assumption, the provision will most conveniently be made, at the next session of Congress, when the productiveness of the existing revenues, and the extent of the sum to be provided for, will be better ascertained.  
[III] There is a part of the public Debt of the United States, which is a cause of some perplexity to the Treasury. ⟨It is⟩ not comprehended within the existing p⟨rovis⟩ion for the foreign debt, which is confined to Loans made abroad; and it is questionable, whether it is to be regarded as a portion of the Domestic Debt. It is not only due to foreigners, but the interest upon it is payable, by express stipulation, in a foreign country, whence it becomes a matter of doubt, whether it be at all contemplated by the Act making provision for the debt of the United States. The part alluded to is that, which is due to certain foreign Officers, who served the United States during the late war. In consequence of a resolution of Congress, directing their interest to be paid to them in France, the certificates which were issued to them specify, that “in pursuance of and compliance with a certain resolution of Congress of the third day of February 1784, the said interest is to be paid, annually, at the House of Monsr. le Grand, Banker in Paris”. Interest has accordingly been paid to them at Paris, down to the 31st of December 1788 by virtue of a special resolution of Congress of the 20th. of August in that year; since which period, no payment has been made.  
It has been heretofore suggested, as the opinion of the Secretary, that it would be expedient to cause the whole of this description of debt to be paid off, among other ⟨re⟩asons, because it bears an interest at six per centum per annum, payable abroad, and can be discharged with a saving. The other reasons alluded to are of a nature both weighty and delicate, and too obvious, it is presumed, to need a specification. Some recent circumstances have served to strengthen the inducements to the measure. But if it should, finally, be deemed unadviseable, it is necessary, at least, that provision should be made for the interest, which is now suspended, under the doubt that has been stated, and from the want of authority to remit it pursuant to the contract.  
The amount of this debt, with the arrears of interest to the end of the year 1791 is Dollars 220,646 ⁸¹⁄₁₀₀  
IV. The Act making provision for the Debt of the United States has appropriated the proceeds of the Western Lands as a fund for the discharge of the public debt. And the Act making provision for the reduction of the public debt, has appropriated all the surplus of the duties on Imports and Tonnage, to the end of the year 1790, to the purpose of purchasing the debt at the market price; and has authorised the President to borrow the further sum of Two Millions of Dollars for the same object.  
These measures serve to indicate the intention of the Legislature, as early and as fast as possible, to provide for the extinguishment of the existing debt.  
In pursuance of that intention, it appears adviseable, that a systematic plan should be begun for the creation and establishment of a sinking fund.  
An obvious basis of this establishment, which may be immediately contemplated, is the amount of the interest on so much of the debt as has been or shall be, from time to time, purchased, or paid off, or received in discharge of any debt or demand of the United States, made payable in public securities—over and above the interest of any new debt, which may be created, in order to such purchase or payment.  
The purchases of the debt already made have left a sum of interest in the Treasury, which will be increased by future purchases—certain sums payable to the United States in their own securities, will, when received, have a similar effect. And there is ground to calculate on a saving upon the operations, which are in execution with regard to the foreign debt. The sale of the Western Lands, when provision shall be made for it, may be expected to produce a material addition to such a fund.  
It is therefore submitted, that it be adopted as a principle, that all interest which shall have ceased to be payable; by any of the means above specified, shall be set apart and appropriated in the most firm and inviolable manner, as a fund for sinking the public debt, by purchase or payment; and that the said fund be placed under the direction of the officers, named in the second section of the Act making provision for the Reduction of the public debt, to be by them applied towards the purchase of the said debt, until the annual produce of the said fund shall amount to two per Cent. of the intire portion of the debt which bears a present interest of six per Centum, and thenceforth to be applied, towards the redemption of that portion of the debt, according to the right which has been reserved to the Government.  
  
It will deserve the consideration of the Legislature, whether this fund ought not to be so vested, as to acquire the nature &amp; quality of a proprietary Trust, incapable of being diverted, without a violation of the principles and sanctions of property.  
A rapid accumulation of this fund would arise from its own operation; but it is not doubted, that the progressive developement of the resources of the country and a reduction of the rate of interest, by the progress of public credit, already exemplified in a considerable degree, will speedily enable the Government to make important additions to it, in various ways. With due attention to preserve order and cultivate peace, a strong expectation may be indulged, that a reduction of the debt of the Country will keep pace with the reasonable hopes of its citizens.  
All which is humbly submitted

The greateft part of the regittered debt, hitherto unfubferibed, is owned by the  
citizens of foreign countries, mot, if not all of whom appear now difpofed to embrace  
the terms held out by the act above mentioned ; extenfive orders having been receiv-  
ti from thofe creditors, to fubfcribe to the loan, after the time for receiving fub{crip-  
tons had clapfed.  
  
A confiderable part of the outfanding or floating debt, confilts of loan-office certi+  
fcates iffued between the firft of September, 1777, and the firft of March, 1778,  
bearing intereft on the nominal fum. Many of the holders of this fpecies of debe  
have come in upon the terms of the act, but others have hitherto declined it ; alledg-  
dog that the fpecial nature of their contrad gives a peculiarity to their cafe, and ren-  
ters the commutation propofed not fo fair an equivalent to them, as in other inftan-  
&amp;. They alfocomplain, that the act has had, towards them, a compulfory afpeé,

by refufing the temporary payment of intereft, unlefs they fhould exchange their old  
fornew certificates, eflentially varying the nature of their contrac  
  
‘A refolutiou of congrefsof the renth of September, 1777, ftipulates in favour of  
this clafs of creditors, intereft upon the sominal inftead of the real principal of their  
debt, until that principal be difcbarged. This certainly renders their contra&amp; of a na.  
ture more beneficial than that of other creditors; but they are at the fame time lia.  
ble to be divefted of the extra-benefit it gives them, by a payment of their {pecie-  
dues ; and it may be obferved, that they have a@tually enjoyed, and by accepting the  
terms offered tothem, were enabled to realife advantages fuperior to other creditors,  
They have been paid intereft by bills on France from the tenth of September, 1777, to  
the firft of March, 1782, while other creditors received their intereft in depreciated  
bills of the old emiflions ; and the terms of the loan propofcd put it into their power  
to realife the benefit of intereft on the nominal amount of their refpedtive debts, x  
rates from 6 and 20-100ths, nearly to 10 and 47-100ths per cent. on their real or fpe:  
cie capital dewn to the laft of December, 1790.  
  
it does not therefore appear to have been an unreafonable expetation, that they,  
  
as readily as any other defcription of public creditors, would have acquicfced in a mee  
fure, calculated for the accommodation of the government, under circumftances, in re-  
fpe&amp;t to w hich it has been demonftrated, by /whfequent events, that the accommedation de-  
fired wasconfiftent with the beft intereft of the public creditors. A large proportien  
of the partics interefted have indeed viewed the matter in this light, and have embrac.  
ed the propofition. Tt is probable, that the progre/s of things will fatisfy the remain.  
der, that it is equally their intcreft to concur; if a farther opportunity be afforded  
But it is, neverthelels, for themfelves only to judge, how far the equivalent propoled  
is, in their cafe, a reafonable and fair one; how far any circumftances in their claim  
may fuggeft reafons for moderation on their part; or how far any other motive,  
public or private, ought to induce an acceptance. And the principles of good faith  
require, that their eledion fhould be free.  
_ On this ground, the complaint which regards the withholding of a temporary  
payment of intereft, except on the condition of a furrender of the old certificaw  
for new ones importing a contradt fubftantially different, appears to the fecretary not  
deftituce of foundation. He prefumes that the operation of that provifion, in the  
particular cafe, was not adverted to; or, that an exception would have been intrody  
ced, as moft confonant with the general fpirit and defign of the act. Accordingly  
the farther meafures which will be fubmitted, will contemplate a method of obviat-  
ing the objection in queftion.  
  
From the confideration, that an extenfion of the time for receiving fubfcriptions,  
upon the terms of the a&amp; making provifion for the debt of the united ftates, is defi»  
  
by a large proportion of the non-fubfcribing creditors; and from the farther com  
fideration, that fufficient experience has not yet been had of the productivenefs of 4  
confiderable branch of the revenues which have been cftablifhed, to afford the light  
neceflary ro a final arrangement—it is, in the judgment of the fecretary, advileable  
to renew the propofition for aJoan in the domeflic debt, on the fame terms with the  
ove which has been clofed, and to allow time for receiving fubfcriptions to it until the  
laft day of September next, inclufively ; making provifion for the temporary paymett  
of intereft to fuch whe may not think fit to fubfcribe, for the year 1792, of the hi  
nature with that which was made in the fame cafe for the year 1791—except a8 (0  
the holders of loan office certificates, iflued between the fir of September 1777,  
the firft of March 1778; in refpeét to whom it is fubmitted as proper to difpeni¢  
with the obligation of exchanging their old certificates for new, as the condition @  
their receiving intereft in capacity of non-fubfcribers ; and to allow them withe  
fuch exchange, to receive the fame intereft, both for the years 1791 and 1792, #9 #  
they had fub{cribed to the fir loan. It willnot be materially difficult, fo to reg  
late the operation at the treafury as to avoid in the particular cafe, that danget  
impofition by counterfeits, which was the motive to the gencral provifion for an @  
change of certificates.  
  
Il. The amount of the fubfcriptions in the debts, of the refpedtive ftates, with  
the limits of the {um affumed in each, appears by the ftatement marked D. to be d  
lars 17,072,324. 39 cents, fubje&amp; to the obfervations accompanying that ftatemet  
Confequently the difference between the aggregate of the fums fubfcribed, and 0  
aggregate of the fums allumed, is dollars 4,427,665, 61. cents

This difference is to be attributed to feveral caufes, the principal of which are the  
following. Firlt, that the fums affumed in refpe&amp; to certain flates exceeded the adtu-  
  
of alamount of their exifting debts. Second, that in various inftances, a part of the ex-  
cir iting debt was in aform which excluded it from being received, without contraven-  
hae ing particular provifions of the law ; as in the cafe of certificates iffued after the firft  
ia day of January, 1790, in lieu of certificates which had been iffued prior to that peri-  
ie oi, which was reported upon by the fecretary on the 2sth day of February laf.  
the Third, ignorance of or inattention to the limitation of time for receiving fub{criptions.  
OTS, kt appears, that a nambcr of perfons loft the opportunity of fub{cribing, from the one  
, to or the other of thefe caufes.  
ted A ftrong defire that a farther opportunity may be afforded for fubfcriptions in thé  
wer debts of the itates, has been manifefted by the individuals interefted. And the fates  
» at ef Rhude-IMand and New-Hampthire have, by the public acts referred to the fecre-  
pe: tary, indicated a fimilar defire. The affording of fuch farther opportunity may ci-  
  
ther be reftricted within the &#x27;imit, as to amount, which is contemplated by the ad  
hey, itfelf or may receive an extenfion which will embrace the refiduary debts of the  
\ea- fates.  
Tee The firft may be eonfidered as nothing mere than giving full effec to a meafure al-  
i de- ready adopted.  
tien The laft appears to have in its favour all the leading inducements to what has  
race Me been already done. The embarraffments which might arile from conflidting fyttems  
naite of finance, are not entirely obviated. The efficacious command of the national re-  
ded. fources for national exigencies, is not unequivocally fecured, ‘The equalizing cf the  
poled condition of the citizens of every ftate, and exonerating thofe of the ftates moft in-  
claim debted, from partial burthens which would prefs upon them in confequence of exer-  
tives, tions in a common caufe, is not completely fulfilled, until the entire debt of every  
faith fate, cuntra&amp;ted in relation to the late war, is embraced im one general and compre-  
  
henfive plan. The inconvenience to the united fates of difburthening the ftates,  
orary which are ftill encumbered with confiderable debts, would bear no preportion ta  
te the inconvenience which they would feel, if left to ftruggle with thofe debts, un-  
y not auded.  
in the More general contentment, therefore, in the public mind, may be expeded to at-  
trodus tend fuch an exoneration, than the reverfe ; in proportion as the experience of actual  
ding!) inconvenience would be greater, though only applicable to parts, in the one, than in  
bviat- MMMM the other cafe  
  
With regard to ftates, parts only of the debts of which have been affumed, and in  
  
ptions, proportions fhort of thofe, which have prevailed, in favour of other Sates, and fhort  
) defits ufo of what would have refulted from a due apportionment of the entire fum aflumed;  
r col the claim to a further affumption is founded on confiderativns of equal jultice, as rela-  
fs of 1H tive to the meafure itfelf, confidered in a feparate and independent light.  
¢ light But there isa further reafun of material weight for an immediate genera! aflump-  
rifeable tion. Monied men, as well foreigners as citizens, through the expeGation of an‘e-  
ith the ventual affumption, or that in fome fhape or other a fubftantia! provifion will be made  
ptil the for the unaffumed refidue of the late debts, will be induced to fpeculate in the pur-  
pyment thale of them. In proportion as the event is unfettled or uncertain, the price of the  
he likeHMM article will be low, and the prefent proprietors will be under difadvantage in the fale.  
t a8 (ORE The lofs to them in favour of the purchafers is te be regarded as an evil; and as far as  
77, 200M it is connected with a transfer to fereigners at an undervalue, it will be a national  
difperle evil. By whatfoever authority an ultimate provifion may be made, there will  
  
oa abfolute lofs to the community, equal to the total amount ef fuch under-va-  
ue.  
  
It may appear an objection tothe meafure, that it will require an eftablifhment of  
additional funds by the government of the united ftates. But this does not feem to  
beaneceflary confequence. The probability ix, chat without a fupplementary affump-  
ton, an equal, or very nearly equal augmentation of funds will be requifite to provide  
lor preater balances in favour of certain ftates, which would be proportionably dimi-  
lied by fuch affumption. The deftination, not the quantum of the fund, will  
herefore be the chief diftin@ion between the two cafes.  
  
It may alfe appear an objection to a total affumption, that the magnitude of the  
tied is not afeertained with precifion. It isnot certainly known, what fum is due in  
mich tate ; nor has it been poffible to acquire the information, owing to different

caufes. But though precife data are deficient, there are materials which will ferve ay  
guides. From the returns received at the treafury, aflifted by information in other  
ways, it may be ftated without danger of material error, that the remaining debts  
of the ftates over and above the fums already fubferibed, will not exceed the amounts  
{pecified in the ftatement D. accompanying this report-—And that, including the fums  
already fub{cribed, the total amount to be ultimately provided for, in the event of a ge-  
neral affumption, will not exceed 25,403,362 dollars 71 cents, which would confi.  
tute an addition of 3,903,392 dollars 71 cents, to the fum of 21,500,000 dollars al.  
ready afiumed.  
  
Should a total affumption be deemed eligible, it may ftill be advifeable to affigns  
determinate fum for each itate, that the utmoft limit of the operation may be pre-ef-  
tablifhed; and it is neceflary in order to the certainty of a due provifion in proper  
time, that intereft tho uld not},begin to be payable, on the additional fums affumed,  
till after the year 1792.  
  
It will oe cur, that provifion has been made, for paying to each fate, in truft for its  
non-fubfcribing creditors, an intereft upon the difference between the fum aflumed  
for fuch ftate, and that actually fubicribed, equal to what would have been payable, if  
it had been fubferibed.  
  
In the event of a further alfumption, either within the limits already eftablithed, or  
com nenfurate with the remaining debts of the flates; it is conceived, that it will  
not be incompatible with the provifion juft mentioned, to retain, at the end of each  
quarter, during the progrefs of the farther fub{cription, out of the money direSed to  
be paid to cach ftate, afum correfponding with the intereft upon fo much of its debts  
as fhail have been fubfcribed to that period, paying the overplus, if any, to the flate,  
  
An abfolute fufpenfion of that payment does not appear confiftent with the nature of  
  
the ftipulation, included in that provifion ; for though the money to be paid toa  
itate, be exprefsly a truft for the non-fubferibing creditors; yet as it cannet be cer  
tain beforehand, that they will elect to change their condition, the poffibility of it  
will not juitify a fufpenfion of payment to the fate, which might operate as a {ulpen-  
fion of payment to the creditors themfeives.  
  
A farther obje@ion to fuch a fufpenfion refults from the idea, that the provifion is  
queftion appears to have a fecondary object ; namely ,as a pled ze for fecuring a prov-  
fion for whatever balance may be found duc toa ftate on the general fettlement of  
accounts. ‘The payment direRed to be made tu a Rate, is“ tocontinue waiil there  
fhall be a fettiement of accounts between the united flates and the individual fates;  
and in cafe a balance fhould then appear in favour of a flate, watid provifion fhall be  
made for the faid balance.”  
  
This fecondary operation, as a pledge or fecurity, (confifently with the intent  
the funding act) cau only be fuperfeded in favour of the primary obje@, a previa  
Sor the crediiors ; and as far as may be neceflary to admit them to an cffedual part  
cipation of it. But as whatever money may be paid toa ftate, isto be paid over to  
its creditors, proportional deductions may, with propricty, be made from the debts  
of thofe creditors wh 4 may hereafter fubicribe; fo as that the united flates may pot  
have to pay twice for the fame purpofe.  
  
If it thall be judged expedient, either to open again, or extend the affumption,*  
will be neceflary to vary the defcription of the debts, which may be fubferibed, fos  
to comprehend all thofe, which have relation to fervices or fupplies during the wal,  
under fuch reftri@tions as are requifite co guard again abufe.  
  
In the original propofition for an affumption of the ftate debts, and in the fugge-  
tions now made on the fame fubject, the fecretary bas contemplated, and, fill con  
templates, as a material part of the plan, an effectual provifion for the fale of the  
vacant lands of the united fkates. He has confidered this refource, as an importa  
mean of finking a part of the debt, and facilitating ultimate arrangements concerning  
the refidue. If fupplementary funds fhall be rendered neccflary, by an additional a  
fumption, the provifion will moft conveniently be made, at the next feflion of com  
grefs, when the produdtivenefs of the exifting revenues, and the extent of the fum  
be provided for, will be better afcertained.  
  
II. There isa part of the public debt of the, united fates, which isa caule of  
fome perplexity to the treafury. It is not comprehended within the exifting provifioa  
for the foreign debt, which is confined to Jeans made abroad ; and it is quettionabls  
whether it isto be regarded as a portion of the domeftic debt. It is not unly duc™

foreigners, but the intereft upon it is = able, by expreis f ip i ation, ina foreign coun-  
try, whence it becomes a matter of doukt, whether it be at all contemplated by thea&amp;  
making provifion for the debt of the united Rates. The part alluded to is that which  
js duc to certain foreign officers, who ferved the united fates during the late war  
In confequence ofa relolution of congrefs, directing their interett to be paid to them  
in France, the certificates which were iflued to com {p =cify that * In purfuance of  
and compliance with a certain refolution of congrefs of the third day of February  
1784, the faid intereft is to be paid, annually, at the houfe of Monf. le Grand, banker  
in Paris.’’ Intereft has accardingly beer. paid.ta them at Paris, down tothe 31ft of  
December 1785, by virtue of a fpecial refolution of congrets of the 2cth of Au zu i in  
that year ; fince which period, no payment has been made.  
  
It has been heretofore fuggetted as the opinion of the fecretary, that it would be  
expedient to eaufe the whole of this defcription of debt to be paid off ; among other  
reafons, becaufe it bears an intere(t at fix per centum per annum, payable abruad, and  
can be difcharged with a faving. The other reafons all ided to are of a nature both  
weighty and delicate, and too obvious, it is prefumed, to need a fpecification. Some  
recent circumftances have ferved to {trengthen the inducements to the meafure. But  
if it fhould, finally, be deemed unadviti able, it is neceflas y at leatt, that provifion  
fhoald be made for the intereit, which is now fulpended, under the doubt that has  
been ftated, and from the want of authority to remit it purfuant to the contra&amp;.  
  
The amount of this debt, withthe arrears of interelt co the end of the year 1791,  
js 220,646 Dollars. 81 Cents.  
  
IV. Theact making provifion for the debt of the united fates has appropriated  
  
he proceeds of the welbern lands as a fund for the diicharge of the publicdebt. And  
the act making provifion for the redudtion of the public debt, has ap; ropriated all  
the furplus of the duties on imports and tonnage, to the end of the year 1790, to the  
purpofe of purchafing the debt at the market price, and has authorifed the prefident  
to borrow the further fum of two millions of doilars oe the fame object.  
  
Thefe meafures ferve to indicate the intention of the legiflature, as carly and as fal  
as poflible, to provide for the extinguifhment of the exiiting debt.  
  
in purfuance of that intention, it appears advifeab&#x27;c, that a fyRematic. plan fhould  
be begun for the creatic m and eftablifhment of a finking fund.  
  
An obvious bafs of this eftablifhment, which may be imm« edi ately anne’ is  
the amount of the intereft on fo much of the debt as has r fhall | , from time  
to time, purchafed, or paid off, or received in difcharge of any debt or demand of the  
united tates, made payable in public fecurities—over and above the intereft of any new  
debt, which may be created, in order to fuch purchale or payment.  
  
lhe purchafes of the debt already mad um of intereft in the treafn-  
ry, which will be encreafed by future purchafes—certain fums payable to the united  
ftates in their own fecuritics, will, when received, have a fimilar effe&amp;. And there  
is ground to calculate on a faving upon the operations which are in execution with  
  
regard to the foreigu debt. The fale of the weltern lands, when provifion {hall be  
  
made for it, may be expected to produce a material addition to fuch a fund.  
  
It is therefore fubmitted, that it be adopted as a principle, that all intercft which  
thal! have ceafed to be payable, by any of the means above {pecified, thall be fet apart  
and appropriated, in the moft firm and inviolable manner, as a fund for finking the  
public debt, by purchafe or payment; and that the faidfund be placed under the di-  
rection of the oificers named in the fecond feAion of the a&amp; making previfion for the  
redudion of the public debt, to be by them applied towards the purchafe of the faid  
debe, until the annual produce of the faid fund fhall amount to two per cent. of the  
entire portion of the debt which bears a prefent interett of fix per centum, and thence-  
forth to be applied, towards the redemprion of that portion ef the debt, according to  
the right which has been referved to the government.  
  
it will deferve the conficeration of the legiflature, whether this fund ought not to  
be fo velted, as to acquire the nature and quality of a proprietary truft, incapable of  
being diverted, without a violation of the principles and fanclions of property.

Concerning which some farther arrangement is  
neceflary.  
The greatest part of the registered debt, hither­  
to unfubferibed, is owned by the citizens of fo­  
reign countries, most, if not all of whom appe2i  
now disposed to embrace the terms held out by the  
a6l above mentioned ; extensive orders having  
been received from thole creditors, to fubferibe tc  
the loan, after the time for receiving fubferiptions  
had elapsed.  
A confidera&#x27;ole part of the outstanding or float­  
ing debt, consists of loan-office certificates iflued  
between the firft of September, 1777, anc*   
of March, 1778, bearing interest on the nominal  
sum. Many of the holders of this foecies of debl  
have come in upon the terms of the a&amp;, but other*  
have hitherto declined it; alledging, that the spe­  
cial nature of their contract gives a peculiarity tc  
their cafe, and renders the commutation proposed  
not so fair an equivalent to them, as in other in­  
stances. They also complain, that the adl hai  
had, towards them, a compulsory afpeft, by refu­  
fing the temporary payment of interest, unless they  
should exchange their old for new certificates, ef­  
ientially varying the nature of their contra&amp;.  
A resolution of Congress of the tenth of Sep­  
tember, 1777, stipulates in favor of this class ol  
creditors, interest upon the nominaly instead of the  
real principal of their debt, until that principal bt  
discharged. This certainly renders their contrail  
ot a nature more beneficial than that of other cre­  
ditors ; but they are at the fame time liable to be  
diverted of the extra-benefit it gives them, by a  
payment of their specie-dues j and it may be ob­

served, that they have a&amp;ually enjoyed, and b}  
.ccepting the terms offered to them, were enablec  
o realise, advantages superior to other creditors.  
They have been paid interest by bills on France  
from the tenth September, 1777, to the firft of  
March, 1782, while other creditors received theii  
inter eft in depreciated bills of the old eminions 5  
and the terms of the loan proposed put it in theii  
power to realise the benefit of interest on the nomi­  
nal amount of their refpe&amp;ive debts, at rate}  
from 6. 20-Xoodths. nearly to 10. 47-ioodths,  
per cent, on their real or specie capital down t&lt;  
the last of December, 179 c.  
It docs not therefoie appear to have been an un  
reafonabie expe&amp;ation, that they, as readily a  
any other description of public cieditors, woul&lt;  
have acquiesced in a measure, calculated for tin  
accommodation of the government, under cir  
cumftances, in refpeft to which, it has been oe  
monftrated by fubjequent events that the acCom  
modation desired was conliftent with the best in  
tereft of the public creditors. A large proportiof  
of the parties interested have indeed viewed th&lt;  
matter in this light, and have embraced the propo­  
sition. It is probable, chat the progreft of  
will fatisfy the remainder, that it is equally theii  
interest to concur 5 if a farther opportunity be a;  
forded. But it is, nevertheless, for themfelvei  
only to judge, how far the equivalent proposed is.  
in their Cafe, a reafonabte and fair one ; how fai  
any circumstances in their claim may suggest rea­  
sons for moderation on their part} or how fa:  
any other motives, puiilic or private, ought to in­  
uce an acceptance. And the principles of gooc  
faith rtquire, that their ele&amp;ion fiiould be free.  
On tl»is ground, the complaint which regard)  
the withholding of a temporary payment of inter­  
est, except on the condition of a surrender of tht  
old certificates for new ones importing a   
substantially different, appears to the Secretary  
not destitute of foundation. He presumes, thai  
the operation of that provision, in the particula:  
cafe was not adverred to ; or, that an exceptior  
would have been introduced as most consonant wltl  
the general spirit and design of rhe act. Accor  
dinglv the farther measures which will be submit  
ted, will contemplate a method of obviating thi  
objection in question.  
From the confederation, that an extension 0  
the time for receiving fubferiptions the_term  
&lt;si &quot;provflion lor the debt or&quot; tn  
United States, is desired by a large proportion o  
the non-fubferibing creditors ; and from the far  
ther consideration, that fufficient experience ha  
not yet been had of the produ&amp;ivenefs of a consi­  
derable branch of the revenues which have beef  
established, to afford the light necelfary to a fina  
arrangement—-it is, in the judgment of the Secre  
tary, advifeable, to renew the proposition for ;  
loan in the domestic debt, on the fame terms witl  
the one which has been closed, and to allow timi  
for receiving fubferiptions to it until the last da;  
of September next, inclusively ; making provifior  
for the temporary payment of interest: to such wht  
may not think fit to fubferibe, for the year 1792  
of the like nature with that which was made ir  
the fame cafe for the year 1791—except as to th&lt;  
holders of Joan-ofTice certificates, ifiued betweer  
the firft of September, 1777, and the firft o  
March, 1778 } in ic(&#x27;pec\ co whom it is fubmittet  
as proper to difpenfc with the obligation of ex  
changing their old certificates for new, as the con  
dition of their receiving interest in capacity of non­  
fubfcr»Lerss and to allow them, without such ex­  
change, to recrive the fame interest, both for th&lt;  
years 1791 and 1792, as if they fubferibed tc  
the firft loan. It will not be materially dithcult  
so to regulate the operation at the treasury as t&lt;  
avoid in the particular cafe, that danger of imposi­  
tion by counterfeits, which was the motive to tin  
general provision foi an exchange of certificates.  
11. The amount of the fubferiptions in tht  
debts of the refpe&amp;ive states, within the limit:  
I of the sum assumed in each, appears by the   
ment marked D. to be dollars 17,072,334.  
39-loodths, lubje&amp; to the observations accompa­  
nying that statement. Conlequently the differ­  
ence between the aggregate of the sums fubfcribec  
and the aggregate ot- the sums assumed, is dollari  
4,427,665. 61-ioodths.  
This difference is to be attributed to fevera  
causes, the principal of which are the following,  
First. That the sums assumed in refpedt to cer­  
tain states exceeded the actual amount of theii  
existing debts. Second, That in various instan­  
ces, a pait of the existing debt was in a forir  
which excluded it from being received, without  
contravening particular provisions of the law 5 a:  
in the cafeot certificates issued after the firft daj  
of January, 1790, in lieu of certificates which  
had been issued prior to that period, which waj  
reported upon by the Secretary on the twenty­  
fifth day of February last. Third, Ignorance of,  
or inattention to the limitation of time for receiv­  
ing fubferiptions. It appears, that a number ol  
loft the opportunity of fubferibing from  
the one or the other of these causes.  
A ftrone desire that a farther opportunity may  
be afforded for fubferiptions in the debts of the  
states, has been manifefteu by the individuals in­  
cerefted. And the states of Rhode-Island and  
New-Hampshire, have by the public a&amp;s referred  
to the Secretary, indicated a similar desire. The  
affording of such farther opportunity, may either  
be reftri&amp;ed within the limit, as to amount,  
which is contemplated by the ast itfelf, or may  
receive an extension which will embrace the resi­  
duary debts of the states.  
  
Th e firft may be considered as nothing mon  
rl an giving luil efftft to a measure already £  
dcpted.  
The last appears to ha*e in its favour all th&lt;  
Gliding inducements to what has been already  
Itme. The em&#x27;barrafTments which might aiil*  
ram conflicting systems of finance are not entire  
y obviated. The efficacious command of th  
i-lional rt-fources for national exigencies, is no  
• nequivo cally, secured. The equalizing of th  
&gt; ndition of the citizens of every state, and exo  
i&gt;rrating those of the states mpft indebted, fron  
partial burthens which would press upon them ir  
Xnfequence of exertions in a common cause, i  
completely fulfilled, until the entire debt o  
:X?ry state, contracted in relation to the war, i  
to one general *nd comprehensive plan  
Tf e inconvenience to the United States, of dif  
thening the states, which are still encumber  
:d with considerable debts, would bear no pro  
ior tion to the inconvenience which they would  
re ,if left to Struggle with those debts, unaided  
i »lors general contentment, therefore, in thi  
lie mind, may be expected to attend such ar  
:x«&gt; noration, than the reverse $ in proportion a  
I of adtual inconvenience would b&lt;  
Liter, though only applicable to parts, in the on&lt;  
hXrirt the other cafe*  
Jr&#x27;ith regard to Rates, parts only of the debti  
; &#x27;&quot;&quot;y.hich have been aflumed, and in proportion;  
hertof those, which have prevailed, in favor o;  
&gt;tS&#x27;f r dates, and Short also of what would have  
efS&#x27;ted from a due apportionment of the entire  
urf aflumed j the claim to a further afTumptior  
s /Tended e»n confiderationa of equal justice, a;  
el itive to the measure itfelf, considered in a fe­  
paiyte and independent light.  
Hot there is a further reason of material weigh  
for Tin immediate general afTumption. Moniec  
!&gt;£ ,&#x27;j as well foreigners as citizens, through th&lt;  
• Xp| ttation of an eventual afTumption, or that ir  
fonlefhape or other a substantial provision will b&lt;  
mane for the unafTumed residue of the state debts  
will be induced to speculate in the purchase o  
neV/u In proportion as the event is unsettled  
&gt;r Incertain, the price of the article will be low  
;nci/the present proprietors will be under aifad  
Menage in the iale. The loss to them in favo  
if {jie purchasers is to be regarded as an evil  
/s i.t is ,&#x27;conne£ied vvith a transfer t&lt;  
Foreigners, at an under value, it will be a na  
lional evil. Bv whatever authority an ultimati  
fcrovifion may be made, there will be an abfoluti  
ofa to the community equal to the total amoun  
&gt;f fach under-value.  
It may appear an objection to the measure  
:hat it will require an establishment of additions  
&quot;unds by the government of the United States.—  
3ut this does not seem to be a necefiary confe  
juence. The probability is, that without a fup­  
jlementarv afTumption, an equal, or very nearlj  
;qual augmentation of funds will be requisite t&lt;  
provide for greater balances in favor of certair  
tates, which would be proportionably dfnrinifhet  
jy such afTumption. The destination, not tin  
quantum of the fund, will therefore be the chie  
iiftindtion between the two cases.  
It may also appear an objection to a total ?)&quot;.  
Tumption, that the magnitude of the objedl is  
lot ascertained with precision. It is not certainly  
tnowo, what sum is due in each state ; nor has it  
jecn poflible to acquire the information, owing  
:o different causes. But though precise &#x27;data arc  
ieficient, there are materials which wil) serve as  
;uides. From the returns received at Vhe treafu­  
•y, aSTifted by information in other ways, it ma\
&gt;e Stated without danger of materia/, error—That  
he remaining debts of the states over and above the  
unas already fubferibed will not cxceed the a­  
nounts fpecifted in the Statement D. accompanying  
his report—And that, including the sums alrea­  
ly fubferibed, the total amount to be ultimately  
)rovided for, in the event of a general aflump­  
ion, will not exceed dols. 25,403,362. 71 which  
vould constitute an addition ot dols. 3)903,362. 71  
othe sum of 21,500,000 dollars already afTumed.  
Should a total afTumption be deemed eligible,  
t may still be advifeable to afiign a determinate  
Turn for each state, that the utmost limit of the  
)peration may be pre-eftah]ifhed ; and it is ne­  
:efTa:y in order to the certainty of a due provi­  
sion in proper time, that interest Should not begin  
:o be payable, on the additional sums afTumed,  
:ill after the year 175 Z.  
it will occur, that provision has been made,  
for paying to each state, in trust for its non-sub­  
scribing creditors, an interest upon the difference  
between the sum aiTumed for such state, and that  
actually fubferibed, equal to what would have  
been payable, if it had been fubferibed.  
In the event of a farther afTumption, either  
within the limits already established, or commen-  
Turate with the remaining debts of the states ; it  
s conceived, that it will not be incompatible with  
he provision just mentioned, to retain, at the  
;nd of each quarter, during the progress of the  
farther subsCription, out of the money directed  
:o be paid to each state, the sum corresponding  
with the interest upon f© much of its debts as shall  
lave been fubferibed to that period, paying the  
averplus, if any, to the state. An absolute sus­  
pension of that payment does not appear confift­  
cnt with the nature of the Stipulation, included in  
that provision $ for though the money to be paid  
to a state be expressly a trust for the non-fubicri­  
bing creditors 5 yet as it cannot be certain be­  
forehand, that they will eledt to change their con­  
dition, the pofiibility of it will not juftify a fufa  
  
Numb. 31.  
  
penfioji of payment to the state, which might ope­  
rate as a lulpenfion of payment to the creditors  
ihemfdves.  
A farther ohje£ion to foch a suspension refult3  
from the idea, thac the provision in question ao­  
pears to have a secondary object j nameJj, a  
pledge for fepuring a provision for whatever ba­  
lance may be found due to a state on the general  
settlement of accounts. The payment dire&amp;ed  
to be made to a state, is il to continue until there  
(ha)! be a settlement of accounts between the  
United States and the individual states $ and in  
C*fe a balance ihould then appear in favor of a  
state, until provision fti2ll be made for the said  
balance.&quot;  
Th&#x27;s secondary operation as a pledge or security  
[confidently with the intent of the funding s£i)  
can only be superseded in favor of the primary  
object, a pro&#x27;vifiQr.for the creditors j and as far as  
may be necessary co admit them to an efte&amp;ual  
participation of it. But as wharcver money may  
be paid to a state, is so be paid over to its credit­  
3rs, proportional deductions may, with propriety,  
be made from the debts of those creditois who  
may hereafter fubferibe j so as that the United  
States may not have to pay twice for the time  
aurpofe.  
If it shall be judged expedient, either to open  
igain, or extend the afiumption, it will be ne­  
:eUarv to vary the description of the debts, which  
nay be fubferibed, so as to comprehend all those,  
phich have relation to services or supplies during  
he war, under such reltri&amp;ions as are requisite to  
;uard against abuse.  
In the original proposition for an afiumption of  
:he state debts, and in the suggestions now made  
)n the fame fubjedt, the Secretary has contem­  
dl a ted, and still contemplates, as a material pare  
)f the plan, an effectual provision, for the sale  
&gt;f the vacant lands of the United States. He  
las considered this resource, as an important  
nean of linking a part of the debt, and facilita­  
:ing ultimate arrangements concerning the reli&quot;  
3ue. If fuuplcmentary funds (hall be rendered  
lecefiary, by an additional afiumption, the pro­  
vision will moll conveniently be i/jade, at the  
lext feflion of Congress, when the produ&amp;ivenefs  
»f theexilting revenues, and the extent of the sum  
:o be provided for, will be better ascertained.  
t There y,, a .par: of the &lt;deH: sf-th-* V fcffi  
States, Wiitch is a caijfe of some perplexity to  
he tjreafury. It is nor comprehended within rh=r  
rxifting provifun fj/ the foreign debt which is  
•onfined to loans m/ide abroad} and it is quef­  
ionable, whether jc is to be regarded as a por­  
ion of the domcf uc debt. It is not only due to  
oreigners, but she interest upon it is payable,  
oy express ft ipulation, in a foreign country,  
whence it berjmes a matter of doubt, whether it  
be at all co ntemplated by the a£* making provi­  
sion for t&gt;.e debt of the United States. The part  
alluded &#x27;(0 is that, which is due to certain foreign  
who served the United States during the  
late » var. ln consequence of a resolution of Con­  
gr-&#x27;&quot;s, directing their interest to be paid to them  
i&#x27;n France, the certificates which were ilTued to  
them fpecify, that &quot; in pursuance of and com­  
pliance with a certain resolution of Congress of  
the third day of February, 1784, the said inteieft  
is to be paid, annually, at the house of Monf. le  
Grand, banker in Paris.&quot; Interest has according­  
ly been paid to them at Paris, down to the 31ft  
of December, 1788, by virtue of a special resolu­  
tion of Congress of the 20th of August in that  
year, since which period, no payment has been  
made.  
It has been heretofore suggested as the opinion  
of the Secretary, that it would be expedient to  
cause the whole of this description of debt to be  
paid oft j among other reasons, because it bears  
an interest at fix per centum per annum, payable  
abroad,&quot;and can be difchargcd with a saving. The  
other reafon9 alluded to are of a nature both  
weighty and delicate, and too obvious, it is presu­  
med, to need a fpecification. Some recent cir­  
cumstances have served to strengthen the induce­  
ments to the measure. But if it /hould, finally,  
be deemed unadvifeable, it is necefiary at least,  
that provision ftiould be made for the interest,  
which is now suspended, under the doubt that has  
been stated, and from the want of authority to  
remit it pursuant to the contrast.  
The amount of this debt, with the arrears of  
interest to the end of the year 1791, is dollars  
220,646. 81.  
IV. The a&amp; making provision for the debt of  
the United States has appropriated the proceeds  
of the western lands as a fund for the difchargeof  
the public debt. And the ad making provision  
for the reduction of the public debt, has appropri­  
ated all the surplus of the duties on imports and  
tonnage, to the end of the year 1790, to the pur­  
pose of purchasing the debt at the market price,  
and has authorised the President to borrow the  
further sum of two millions of dollars for the fame  
object.  
These measures serve to indicate the intention  
of the legislature, as early and as fact as poflible,  
to provide for the extinguishment of the existing  
debt.  
In pursuance of that intention, it appears ad­  
vifeable, that a systematic pl2n should be begun  
for the creation and establishment of a finking  
fund.  
An obvious basis of this eftablifliment, which  
may be immediately contemp ated, is the amount  
of the interest on so much of he debt as has bee

or iliall be, from time to time, pus chafed, or paid off, or received In dtfcharge of any debt cr demand  
of the United States, made payable in public securities—over and above the interest of any new  
debt, which may be created, in order to luch purchase or payment.  
Ihe purchsfes of the debt already made have left a sum of interest in the Treasury, which will  
he eilcreafed by future purchases—certain sums payable to the United States in their own securi­  
ties, will, when received, have a similar effedt. And these is ground to calculate on a saving upon  
the operations which are in execution with regard to the foreign debt. The sale of the West­  
ern Lands, when provision shall be made for it, may bt expelled to produce a material addition to  
such a fund.  
It is therefore submitted, that it be adopted as a principle, that all interest which shall have ceas­  
ed to be payable, by any of the means above fpecified, shall be set apart and appropriated in the  
most firm and inviolable manner, as a fund for finking the public debt, by purchase or payment j  
and that the said fund be placed under the direction of the officers named inthefecond fedlion of  
the adl making provision for the redu&amp;ion of the public debt, to be by them applied towards the  
purchase of the said debt, until the annual produce of the said fund shall amount to two per cent,  
of the entire portion of the debt which bears a present interest of fix per centum, and thenceforth  
to be applied, towards the redemption ot that portion of the debt) according to the right which has  
been relerved to the government.  
It will deserve the ccnfideration of the legislature, whether this fund ought not to be so vested,  
as to acquire the nature and quality of a proprietary trust, incapable of being diverted, without z  
violation of the principles and fanttions of property.  
A rapiJ accumulation of this fund would arise from its own operation ; but it is not doubted]  
that the progrefiive developement of the resources of the country, and a reduction of the rate of in­  
terest, by the progress of public credit, already exemplified in a confidcrable degree, will fpeedil)  
enable the government to make important additions to it, in various ways. With due attention tc  
preserve order and cultivate peace, a strong expectation may be indulged, that a reduction of the  
debt of the country w;ll keep pace with the reasonable hopes of its citizens.  
All which is humbly submitted.  
ALEXANDER HAMILTON, Secretary of the Treasury.

whom appear now disposed to embrace the terms held out by the  
atl above mentioned ; extensive orders having been received from  
those creditors, to fubferibe to the loan, after the lime for re­  
viving fubferiptions had elapsed.  
A confidence part of the outrtanding or floa-ing debt, con­  
*lU of loan-office certificates issued between the fir ft of Septem­  
er&#x27;.1777 i and thefirft of March, 1778, bearing interest on the  
nominal lum. Many of the holders of this species of debt have  
come in upon the terms of the ast, but others have hitherto de­  
c.inea it ;/Hedging, that the special nature of their contract gives  
a peculiarity to their cafe, and renders the commutation propo­  
not 10 fair an equivalent to them, as in other instances. They  
°l^e has had, towards them, a compulsory  
k ru ruling the temporary payment of interest, unless  
t ev Ihould change their old for now certificate, e(Tentially vary­  
ing the nature of their contrast.  
A resolution of Congress of the tenth of September, 1777, fti­  
pulati-s in favor of this class of creditors, interest upon the nominal,  
»nucad ot thereof principal of their debt, until that principal be dj­  
arg*d. This certainly renders their contra£l of a nature more  
eneficial than ihat of other creditors ; but they are at the fame  
time liable to be diverted of the extra-benefit it gives the n, by a  
payment of their specie-dues ; and it may beobferved, that they  
ave aanally enjoyed, and by accepting the terms offered to them,  
were enabled to reahfe, advantages superior to other creditors.  
cy have been paid interest by bills on France from the tenth  
September, 1777, to the firtt of March, 1782, while other credi­  
tors received their interest in. depreciated bills of the old cmiflions ;  
an tie terms of the loan proposed put it in th ir power to realise  
t. e eneht of interest on the nominal amount of their refpe&amp;ive  
ts, at rates from 6. 20-ioodths. nearly to 10. 47-ioodths.  
percent, on their real or Ipccie capital down to the last of De­  
cember, 1790.  
It does not therefore appear to have been an unreasonable ex­  
oe at ion, that they, as readily as any other defcripiion of pub­  
ic creditors, would have acquiesced in a measure, calculated for  
- f a&quot;omniof!alioV government, under circumstances, in  
-e pett to which, it has been demonstrated by subsequent events  
t at the accommodation deftred was confident with the best in­  
n j ptiblic creditors. A large proportion of the parties  
intere edl have indeed viewed the matter in this light, and have  
•em raced the proportion. It is probable, that the progreji of  
t lings will (atisfy the remainder, that it is equally their interest to  
rf &#x27;i 3 &#x27; r opportunity be afForded. But it is, never­  
-1 CfC^S&gt; l^mk^vcs only to judge, how far the equivalent pro­  
po e 1% in their cafe, a reasonable and fair one ; how far any  
crcumllances in tneir claim ma&gt; suggest reasons for moderation  
on t eir part ; or how far any other motiv-s, public or private,

surrender of the old certificates for new ones importing a eontraft  
lubftantially different, appears to the S-cretarv not destitute of  
foundation. He presumes, that the operation of that provision,  
in the particular cafe was not adverted to ; or, that an exception  
would have heen introduced as mod consonant with the general  
Ipirit and defignof the act. Accordingly the farther measures  
which will be submitted, will contemplate a method of obviating  
the objection in question.  
From the confutation, that an extension of the time for re­  
ceiving fubferiptions udoii the terms of the ast making provision  
or ihe debt of the United States, isdefired by a large proportion  
ot the non-fubferibnig creditors; and from the farther confider­  
at ion, that lufficient experience has not yet been had of the pro­  
dutfcivenefs ot a considerable branch of the revenues which have  
been eftabliQied, to afford the light necessary to the final arrange­  
ment—it is, in the judgment of the Secretary, advifeable, tore­  
new the piopofition for a loan in the domestic debt, on the fame  
terms with the one which has been closed, and to allow time for  
receiving fubferiptions to if unuJ&#x27;the last day of September next,  
inclulively ; making provision tor the temporary payment of in­  
terest to such who may not think fit to subscribe, tor the year  
1792&gt; of the like nature with that which was made in the fame  
cafe tor the year 1791—except as to the holders of loan-office cer­  
tificates, issued between the firft of September, 1777, and the firft  
of March, 1778 ; in refpeft to whom it is submitted as proper to  
drfpenfe with the obligation of exchanging their old certificates  
for new. as the condition of their receiving interest in capacity of  
non-fubferibers ; and to allow them, w&#x27;.thout such exchange, to  
receive the fame interest, both for the years 1791 and 1792, as if  
they had fubferibed to the firft loan. It will not be materially  
difficult, so to regulate the operation at the treasury as to avoid in  
the particular cafe, that danger of imposition by counterfeits,  
which was the motive to thegeneral provision for an exchange of  
certificates.  
  
11. The amount of the fubferiptions in the debts of the ref­  
pe&amp;ive States, within the limits of the sum aflumed in each, ap­  
pears by the ftatrment marked D. to be dollars 17,072,334.  
39-ioodths, fubjeft to the observations accompanying that llaie­  
ment. Consequently the difference between th aggregate of the  
sums fubferibed and the aggregate of the sums aflumed, in dollars  
45427,665. 61-ioodtbs.  
  
7.088,727. 79  
  
This difference is to be attributed to several causes, the princi­  
pal of which are the following : First, That the sums afTumed in  
l efpeel to certain States exceeded the a&amp;ual amount of their ex­  
iting debts. Second, That in various instances, a part of the ex­  
iting debt was in a form which excluded it from being received,  
without contravening paiticular provisions of the law ; as in the  
cafe of certificates iffucd alter the firft day of January, 1790, in  
lieu of certificates which had been iflued prior to that period,  
wnich was reported upon by the Secretary on the twenty-fifth day  
of February last. Third, Ignorance of, or inattention to the li­  
mitation of time for receiving fubferiptions. It appears, that a  
number of persons loft the opportunity of fubferibing from the  
one o» the other of these causes.  
  
1&gt;«3&#x27;&gt;364- 76  
  
A ftrongdefire that a farther opportunity maybe afforded for  
fubferiptions in the debts of the States, has been manifefted by  
the individuals interested. And the States of Rhode-Island and  
New-Hampshire, have by the public a6ls referred to the Secretary,  
indicated a fiinilar desire. The affording of such farther opportu­  
nity, may either be reftri&amp;ed within the limit, as to amount,  
which is contemplated by the ast itfelf, or may receive an exten­  
sion which will embrace the residuary debts of the States.  
1 he firft may be considered as nothing more than giving full  
effect to a measure already adopted.  
1 he last appears to have in its favor all the leading inducements  
to what has been already done. The embarrafTments which  
might arise from confli&amp;ing systems of finance, are not entirely  
obviated. The efficacious command of the national resources for  
national exigencies, is not unequivocally secured. Theequalizing  
of the condition of the citizens of every (late, and exonerating  
those of the states mod indebted, from partial burthens which  
would press upon them in consequence of exertions iu a common  
cause, is not completely fulfilled, until the entire debt of every  
state, contracted in relation to the w*r, is embraced on one gene­  
ral and comprehensive plan. The inconvenience to the United  
States, of difbui thening the states4 which arc still encumbered with  
considerable debts, would bear no proportion to the inconveni­  
ence which they would feel, if left to struggle with those debts,  
unaided.  
  
15 674. 62  
  
107,648. 63  
  
More general contentment, therefore, in the public mind, may  
be expected to attend such an exoneration, than the reveife; in  
proportion as the experience of actual inconvenience would be  
greatei, though only applicable to parts, in the one than in the  
other cafe.  
  
With regard to states, parts only of the debts of which have  
been aflTumed, and in proportions ftiort of those, which have pre­  
vailed, in favor of other states, and short also of what would have  
resulted from a due apportionment of the entire sum afTumed ; the  
claim to a further aflumption is founded on confederations of  
equal justice, as relative to the meafuie itfelf, considered in a se­  
parate and independent light.  
But there is a further reason of material weight for an immedi­  
ate general assumption. Mpnicd men, as well foreigners as citi­  
zens, through the expeftatibn of an eventual aflumption, or that in  
some shape or other a substantial provision will be made for the  
unaflutned residue of the state debts, will be induced to speculate  
in the purchase of them. In proportion as the event is unfeitled,  
or uncertain, the price of the article will be low, and the present  
proprietors will be under disadvantage in the sale. The joss to  
them in favor of the purchasers is to be regarded as an evil; and  
as far as it is conne&amp;cd with a transfer to foreigners, at an under  
value, it will be a national evil. By whatever authority an ulti­  
mate provision may be made, there will be an absolute loss to the  
community eqnal to the amount of such under-value.  
  
It may appear an obje&amp;ion to the measure, that it will require  
an establishment of additional funds by the government ot the  
United States. But this does not seem to be a necelfary confc­  
quence. The piobability is, that without a fupplementarv as­  
sumption, an equal, or very nearly equal augmentation of funds  
will be rcquifite to provide for greater balances in lavor of certain  
dates, which would be proportionally duninifhed by such af­  
umption. The destination, not the quantum of the fund, will  
therefore be the chief diftin&amp;ion between the two cases.  
  
It may also appear an objection to a total aflumption, that the  
magnitude of the object is net ascertained with precision. It is  
not certainly known, what sum is due in each state ; nor has it  
been poflible to acquire the information, owing to different causes.  
But though precise data are deficient, there arc materials which  
will serve as guides. From the, returns received at the trcafury,

I a (lifted by information in oilier ways, it miv he ftited without  
danger of mater,al error-Tbat the remaining debt, of the llaie.  
I over and above the funis already fubferibed, will not exceed the  
amount, fpecfied in the Bate,nent D. acro.npauyi.ig this report-  
And that, including the sums already fubferibed, thelotal amount  
°;i, H,*matcb&#x27;provided for, in the event of a general assumption.  
will not exceed dols. 25,403,362. 71 which would couftitute an  
addition of dols 3,903,36*. 71 to the Aim of 5i,500,000 dollar*,  
already aliumed.  
./{-Id » total assumption be deemed eligible, it may still be  
advifeable to alfign a determinate sum for each state, that the uc­  
molt limit of the operation may be pre-eftablilhed ; and it is nt­  
celiary ,n order to the certainty of a due provision in prop-r time  
ul&#x27;affre A°Ui&#x27;,d r rß&#x27;&quot; * on the .Jdfi  
lums ailumec}, till after the year 1792.  
It will occur, that provision has been made, for paying to each  
state, m trull for ,u non-fubicrib.ng creditors, an interest uPon the  
difference between the sum..(Filmed (or such fta.e, and that aftu­  
been fubfenbed &#x27; &#x27;° WhSt W°uM h&#x27;VC bcenTay,b&#x27;e&gt; if it had  
j&quot; &#x27;hn &#x27;wrll1 °f &#x27; fanhcr &quot;Gumption, either within the limits al­  
ready eltabhlhed, or commensurate with the remaining deb&#x27;s of  
the states; It IS conceived, that it will not be incompatible with  
the provilion just mentioned, to retain, at the end ot each quarter  
during the progress of the farther fubfer,pt.on, out of the money  
d.rested to be paid to each state, ihe sum corresponding with the  
interest upon so much ol its debts as {hall have been fubferibed to  
that period, paying the overplus it any, to the state. An abfo.  
lute (ufpenfion of that payment does not appear confident with  
the nature of the ftipulatior., included in that provision ; for though  
the money to be paid to a state be expr.fsly a trull for the non.  
uotcriblng creditors ; yet as it cannot be certain beforehand, that  
they will cleft to change their condition, the possibility of it will  
not juilify a lufpenfion of payment to the state, which might opc.  
rate as a suspension of payment to the creditors themselves.  
  
A farther objeaion to such a suspension results from the idea,  
&#x27;hat the provision in question appears to have a secondary obje6l;  
namely, as a p edge for fecurin; a provision for whatever balance  
may be found due to a state on the general fettlemenL of accounts.  
The payment direded to be made to a state, is, &quot; to continue until  
there Ihall be a fettlemcnt of accounts between the Uni:ed States  
and the individual ftdtcs ; and in cafe a balance Ihould then appear  
in favor of a state, until provision (hall be made for the said ba­  
lance.&quot;  
  
This secondary operation as a pledge or security (confidently  
with the intent of the funding ast) can only b.: superseded in fa­  
vor of the primary objedf, a provision for the creditors ; and as far as  
may be necessary to admit thorn to an etf;dual participation or  
it. But as whatever money may be paid to a state, is to be paid  
over to its creditors, proportional deductions may, with proprie­  
ty, be made from the debts of those creditors who may hweafier  
lubfcribe; so as that the United States may not have to pay twice  
for the fdine purpose.  
If it (hall be judged expedient, either to open again, or extend  
the aflumption, it will be necefTary to vary the dcfcriptinn of the  
debts, which may be lubfcribed, so as to comprehend all those,  
which have relation to services or supplies during the war, under  
such refttiftions as arc requtfite to guaid against abuse.  
  
In the original proposition for an assumption of the (late debts,  
and in the suggestions now made on ibc fame fubjeii, the Sccie­  
taty has contemplated, aod still contemplates, as a material part  
of the plan, an cffr&amp;ual proviflon for the ! ;of the vacant lands  
of the United States. He has considered tbn refourci-, as all im­  
portant mean of finking a part of the debt, and facilitating ulti,  
mate arrangements concerning the residue. If fupplementarjr  
funds (hall be rendered necessary, by an additional aflfiini|jtion#  
the provilion will most conveniently be made at the next feflW  
of Congress, when the produftivenefsof the exilling revenues, and  
the exicnt of the sum to be provided for, will be better ascer­  
tained.  
  
There is a part of the public debt of the United States, which  
is a cause of some perplexity to the treasury. It is not compre­  
hended within the existing provision for the foreign debt which  
is confined to loans made abroad ; and it is queftiouable, whether  
it is to be regarded as a portion of the domcftic debt. It is not  
only due lojoreignerj, but the interest upon it is payable, by ex­  
press stipulation, in a foreign country ; whence it becomes a mat­  
ter of doubt, whether it be at all contemplated by the ad making  
provision for the debt of the United States. The part alluded to, ,  
is that which is due to certain foreign officers who served the  
United States during the late war. In consequence of a resolution  
of Congress, directing their inter ft to be paid to them in France,  
the ceitificates which were issued to them fpecify, that &quot; in pur­  
suance of and compliance with a certain resolution of Congress of  
the third day of February, 1784, the laid inteieft is to be paid, an­  
nually, at the house of Monf. lc\Grand, banker in Paris.&quot; Interest  
has accoidinglv been paid to them at Pans, down to the 31 ft of  
December, 1788, by virtue of a special resolution of Congress of  
the 20th of August in that year, fmce which period, no payment  
has been made.  
  
It has been heretofore suggested as the op:nion of the Secretary,  
that it would be expedient to cause the whole of this dcfcriptioa  
of debt to be paid off; among other ieafons, because it bears an  
inteieft at fix per centum per annum, payable abroad, and can be  
discharged with a saving. The other reasons alluded to are of a  
nature both weighty and delicate, and too obvious, it is presumed,  
to need a fpecification. Some recent circumftanccs have served to  
strengthen the inducements to the m afure. But if it should,  
finally, be deemed unadvifeable, it is necessary, at least, that pro*  
vision (hould be made for the interest, wh ch is now suspended,  
under the doubt that has been stated, and from the want of autho­  
rity to remit it pursuant to the contra#.  
  
The amount of this debt, with the arrears of intcreft to the end  
of the year 1791, is dols. 220,646. 81.  
IV. The ad making provision for trie debt of tho United States,  
has ;«ppropria&#x27;ed the proceeds of the western lands as a fund for  
the discharge of the public debt. And the a£fc making provifioa  
ior ttie redu&amp;ion ot the public debt, has appropriated all the sur­  
plus of the duties on imports and tonnage, to the e»rd of the year  
1790, to the purpose of purchasing the debt at the market price,  
and has authorjfed the President to borrow the further sum ot  
two millions of dollars tor the fame objefct. &gt;  
These measures f:rve to indicate the intention of the legiflaturc,

REPORT of th: SECRET ARY of the TREASURY,  
  
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE  
  
PUB L I C  
  
[l&#x27;ONCHin£D,j  
  
A N obvious basis of tlrs eitabhfbnient, which may be iinrae-  
JT\. dujely contemplated, is uie a mount of the imerelt on so  
much ot the debt as has been, or thai! he, from tune to time, pur­  
chased, or pa&#x27;d otf, or received in discharge ot any debt or de­  
mand of the United States, made payable m public fecunties—  
over and above the interest of anv n w debt, whicn may be cre­  
ated, in order to Juch purchase or payment.  
  
The purchafesof the debt already made, have left a sum of in­  
tereit in the Treasury, which will be encrcnfed by future pur­  
chases—certain funis payable to the United Slates in their own se­  
curities, will, when received, have a fimilat rtfetfc. And there is  
ground to calculate on a saving upon the operations which are in  
execution with regard to the foreign debt. The sale of the Wes­  
tern Lands, when provision (hall be made for it, may be expelled  
to produce a material addition to such a fund.  
It is therefore submitted, that ir be adopted as a principle, that  
all interest which (hall have ceased to be payable, by any of the  
mc-ms above fpecified, ihall be set apart and appropriated in the  
mod firm and inviolable manner, as a fund tor linking the public  
debt, by purchnfeor payment; and that the said fund be placed  
under the diieCtion of the offtcers named in the lecood fe&amp;ion of  
the a£l making provision for the redu£lion of the public debt, to  
be by them applied towards the purchase of the laid debt, until  
the annual produce of the said fund Ihall amount to two per cent  
of the entire portion of the debt which bears a present interest of  
fx per centum, and thenceforth to be applied towaras the re­  
demotion of that porti«n of the debt, according to the right which  
has been reserved to the government.  
It will deserve the confederation of the legislature, whether this  
fund ought not to be so vested, as to acquire the nature and quality  
of a proprietary Uuft, incapable of being diverted, without a vio­  
lation of the principles and fan&amp;ions of property.  
  
A rapid accumulation of this fund would arise from its own  
operation; but it is not doubted, that the progreflive develope­  
ment of the rtfoutces of the country, and a redu&amp;ion of the rate  
of interest, by the progress of public CTedit, already exemolified  
in a conliderable degree, will speedily enable the government to  
make important additions to it, in various ways. With due at­  
tention to preserve order and cultivate peace, a strong expe&amp;ation  
may be indulged, that a redu&amp;ion of the debt of thepountry will  
keep pace with the reasonable hopes of its citizens.  
All which is humbly submitted.

The amount subscribed in the debts of the States reported by  
Hamilton in February, 1793, was $17,072,334.39. This was smaller  
than the amount assumed by $4,427,665.61. Several reasons existed  
for not subscribing the balance. The first was, the sum assumed  
in respect to certain States exceeded the actual amount of their  
debts. Secondly, in many instances a part of the existing debt was  
in such a form as to exclude it without violating the law. Lastly,  
ignorance or forgetfulness of the time limited for receiving subscrip-
