		Quincy, April 10, 1809.  
				  
				I was glad to see in your paper of the 7th of this month, the extract from the Baltimore Federal Republican, for many reasons, which may be explained in due time; one or two may be stated now.1. I was pleased with the candid acknowledgment,  
that  “Mr. Adams never was a favorite with the leading  
men of the federal party.&quot; The words leading men will require some explanation and some limitations and restrictions, which may hereafter appear. But in general, this  
is a truth which 1 have known for twenty years, though  
it has never been publicly avowed, to my knowledge,  
till now.2. I am happy to see what I consider as an acknowledgment, that my unpardonable sin against the federal  
party, or rather against those leading men, was the peace  
with France in 1800: an event which has given this  
country eight years of its most splendid prosperity. The  
writer mentions the mission to France in 1799, as a measure which brought odium and ridicule on my administration. If you will allow me a little room in your Patriot,  
I may hereafter produce proofs to the satisfaction of the public, that this measure was neither odious nor ridiculous. At this time I will only send you a communication from Gen. Washington, by which it will appear  
that the subject was not seen by that great ornament of  
his country in the same light in which this writer sees it.  
Mount Vernon, 1st Feb. 1799.  
Dear Sir,  
The letter herewith enclosed, from Mr. Joel Barlow,  
though of old date, came to my hands only yesterday. I  
have conceived it to be my duty to transmit it to you  
without delay and without a comment, except that it  
must have been written with a very good or a very bad  
design—which of the two, you can judge better than I.  
For, from the known abilities of that gentleman, such a  
letter could not be the result of ignorance, in him, nor  
from the implications which are to be found in it, has it  
been written without the privity of the French Directory—It is incumbent on me to add, that I have not been in  
the habit of corresponding with Mr. Barlow. The letter  
now forwarded is the first I ever received from him: and  
to him I have never written one. If then you should be  
of opinion that his, is calculated to bring on negociation  
upon open, fair and honorable ground, and merits a reply, and will instruct me as to the tenor of it, I shall with  
pleasure and alacrity obey your orders: more especially if  
there is reason to believe that it would become a mean,  
however small, of restoring peace and tranquility to the  
United States, upon just, honorable and dignified terms,  
which I am persuaded is the ardent desire of all the friends  
of this rising Empire. With great consideration and respect, I have the honor to be, dear sir, your most obedient  
and very humble servant.  
G. WASHINGTON.J. Adams, President of the United States. The letter from Mr. Barlow, enclosed in General  
Washington’s, is in these words:  
Paris, 2d Oct. 1798.Sir,On hearing of your late nomination as Commander in  
Chief of the American armies, I rejoice at it, not because  
I believe the war which that nomination contemplates is  
yet inevitable, and that it will furnish an occasion for a  
farther display of your military talents, but because it may  
enable you to exert your influence to a greater effect, in  
preventing the war, by becoming more the centre of information than you could be in your retirement, you will  
be better able to judge of the dispositions of both countries  
and to offer such counsels to your government as may  
tend to remove the obstacles that will oppose themselves  
to a reconciliation—Were you now President of the  
United States, I should not address you this letter, because, not knowing my inclination for the tranquility of a  
retired life, you might think that I was seeking a place, or  
had some farther object in view, than the simple one of  
promoting peace between the two republics. But I hope,  
under present circumstances, that you will believe my  
motive to be pure and unmixed, and that the object of  
my letter is to call your attention to the true state of  
facts.Perhaps few men, who cannot pretend to have been in  
the secrets of either government, are in a better situation  
than myself to judge of the motives of both; to assign  
the true causes, and trace out the progress of their unhappy misunderstanding, or to appreciate their present dispositions, pretensions and wishes. I am certain there is  
none who labors more sincerely for the restoration of harmony, upon terms honorable to the United States and  
advantageous to the cause of liberty.  
I will not in this place, go over the history of past  
transactions. It would be of little use.—The object is to  
seize the malady in its present state and try to arrest its  
progress. The dispute at this moment may be characterized simply and literally speaking, a misunderstanding.—I cannot persuade myself to give it a harsher name, as it applies to either government. It is clear that neither of  
them has an interest in going to war with the other, and  
I am equally convinced that neither of them had the inclination; that is, I believe the balance of inclination as  
well as of interest, on both sides, is in favor of peace. But  
each government, though sensible of this truth with respect to itself, is ignorant of it, with respect to the other.  
Each believes the other determined on war, and ascribes  
all its conduct to a deep-rooted hostility. The least they  
can do therefore under this impression, is to prepare for an  
ever which they both believe inevitable, while they both  
wish to avoid it. But by what fatality is it that a calamity so dreadful must be rendered inevitable because it is  
thought so? Both governments have tongues and both  
have ears. Why will they not speak? Why will they not listen? The causes that have hitherto prevented them  
are not difficult to assign. I could easily explain them,  
as I believe, to the satisfaction of both parties and without  
throwing so much blame on either government, as each  
of them at present ascribes to the other. But I will avoid speaking of any past provocation on either side. The  
point that I wish to establish in your mind is, that the French Directory is at present sincerely desirous of restoring harmony between this country and the United  
States, on terms honorable and advantageous to both parties. I wish to convince you of this, and thro’ you,  
the American government, because that government being desirous of the same thing, would not fail to take such  
steps as would lead immediately to the object.In offering you my proofs of the present disposition on  
this side, you will permit me to observe, that some of them  
are from their nature incapable of being detailed, and  
others improper to be trusted to the casualties of a letter.—But I will mention a few that are ostensible, and so far  
as they go undeniable. First, the Directory has declared  
that it will receive and treat with any Minister from  
America, who shall appear to be sent with a sincere intention of treating and terminating existing difficulties. I have no doubt but this was the intention when the last  
Envoys were sent; but from some unfortunate circumstances the Directory did not believe it. Second, as a  
preliminary, it has been declared that in the negociation  
there shall be no question of loans of money, or apologies  
for offensive speeches pronounced by the executive on  
either side. Third, all commissions given to privateers in  
the West-Indies are recalled, and when new commissions  
are issued, the owners and commanders are to be restricted  
under bonds, to the legal object of capture.—Fourth, an  
embargo that was laid on American ships within the republic, in consequence of a report that war had been begun on the part of the United States, was taken off as  
soon as it was ascertained that such war had not been begun. And a new declaration was at the same time sent  
to America of the wishes of France to treat. These facts  
will doubtless come to your knowledge through other  
channels, before you receive this letter. But there are  
other facts which in my mind are equally clear, though  
to you will be destitute of corroborating circumstances  
and must rest on my own information and opinion. 1st.  
That this government contemplates a just indemnity for  
spoliations on American commerce, to be ascertained by  
commissioners in a manner similar to the one prescribed  
in our treaty with England. 2d. That the legislation  
will soon be changed here with respect to neutrals, and  
that all flags will be put on the footing of the law of nations. 3d. That a public agent would have been named  
and sent to Philadelphia soon after Mr. Gerry’s departure,  
were it not for the apprehensions that he would not have  
been received. There was a doubt whether the American government would not have already taken such measures of hostility as to be unwilling to listen to terms of  
accommodation, and the Directory did not choose to  
risque the chance of seeing its offers refused. 4th. That  
the Directory considers these declarations and transactions as a sufficient overture on its part. That it has retreated to an open ground that is quite unsuspicious.  
That a refusal on the part  of the American government   
to meet on this ground, will be followed by immediate  
war, and that it will be a war of the most terrible and  
vindictive kind.This, sir, is my view of the present state of facts.  
Should it make that impression on your mind, which I desire for the sake of humanity that it may, you will judge  
whether it does not comport with the independence of  
the United States and the dignity of their government,  
to send another minister to form new treaties with the  
French republic. In a war there is clearly nothing to be  
gained by us, not even honor.—Honor indeed may be  
saved by war, and so it may be by negociation. But the  
calamities inseparable from a war of this kind, and under  
present circumstances, would be incalculable. I do not  
say that the United States or any portion of them would  
be conquered; but they would sacrifice great numbers of  
their best citizens, burthen themselves with four times  
their present debt, overturn the purest system of morals,  
and lose the fairest opportunity that ever a nation had of  
rising to greatness and happiness on the basis of liberty.Were I writing to a young General, whose name was  
still to be created, I might deem it useless to ask him to  
stifle in its birth a war on which he had founded his hopes  
of future honors. But you, sir, having already earned  
and acquired all those that can render a man great and  
happy, can surely have no object of ambition but to render your country so. To engage your influence in favor  
of a new attempt at negociation, I thought it only necessary to convince you that such an attempt would be well  
received here, and probably attended with success. I can  
do no more than assure you that this is my sincere opinion, and that my information is drawn from unsuspected  
sources.I am not accustomed to interpose my advice in the administration of any country, and should not have done it  
now, did I not believe it my duty as a citizen of my own,  
and a friend to all others. I see two great nations rushing on each others bayonets, without any other cause of  
contention but a misunderstanding. I shudder at the prospect and wish to throw myself between the vans, and  
suspend the onset, till a word of explanation can pass. I  
hope my letter will have thrown some light upon the  
subject; but if it shall not, I hope you will excuse the attempt, for you know my zeal is honest. I have the honor to be, sir, / With great respect, / Your most obedient and  
/ Most humble servant,  
	Joel Barlow.To Gen. Washington.Neither Mr. Barlow’s letter nor General Washington’s  
opinion would have influenced me to nominate a minister,  
if I had not received abundant assurances to the same effect  
from regular diplomatic sources. I, however, considered  
General Washington’s question whether Mr. Barlow’s  
was written with a very good or a very bad design; and  
as with all my jealousy I had not sagacity enough to discover the smallest room for suspicion of any ill design, I  
frankly concluded that it was written with a very good  
one. From General Washington’s letter it appears, 1st.  
That it was his opinion that the restoration of peace upon  
just, honorable and dignified terms, was the ardent desire of all the friends of this rising empire. 2d. That he  
thought negociation might be brought on, upon open, fair and honorable ground. 3d. That he was so desirous  
of peace, that he was willing to enter into correspondence with Mr. Barlow, a private gentleman, without any visible credentials or public character, or responsibility to  
either government, in order to bring on a public negociation. Gen. Washington, therefore, could not consider  
the negociation odious.

The letter from Mr. IJarlow, en­

these words :  
Paris, 2d Oct. 1798.  
Sir,  
On hearing of your late nomina­  
r.ation as commander in chief of the  
American armies, I rejoiced at it, not  
because I believe the war which that  
nomination contemplates is yet inevi­  
table, and Urit ir. udll furnish an occa­  
sion lor a ittrt her display of your mili­  
tary talents, but because it may enable;  
you to exert your influence to a grea­  
ter effect, in preventing the war •, by  
becoming more the centre of infof­  
matton ihau you could be in your re­  
tirement, you will be better able to  
judge ol tlie di.positions of both cottn­  
, and to offer such counsels to  
your government as may tend to re­  
move the obsfaclw that will oppose  
themselves to -\ rcci i. Were­  
you now President of the LT. Stall  
should not address you this letter, be­  
cause, not knowing my inclination for  
the tranquil il tired life, you  
I might think h.ul wasseekii  
or had some farther object in view,  
than the simple one of promoting pc ice  
between ihe two republics. But I  
&#x27; hope, under present circumstances,  
that you Will c-eiicve my motive to be  
nitre and unmixed, and that the object  
of my letter is to call your attenti  
1 the true slate of facts.  
Perhaps few men, who cannot pre­  
tend to have been in the secrets of ci­  
. th: r government, are in a better .ituja­  
. lion than myself to judge of the mo­  
x tives ol both; to assign the true c lusfcs,

rest in going to war with ihe other, Sc  
I am equally convinced that neither of

Siks,~— 1 was glad to sec in your paper of  
the 7th of this month, the extra&amp; from the  
Baltimore Federal Republican, for many rea­  
sons, which may be explained in due tims ;  
one or two may be stated now.  
1. I was pleased with the candid ac­  
knowledgmeant, that “ Mr, Adams never was  
a favorite with the /eadizg men of the federal  
party.” The words leading men will require  
some explanation and some limitations and  
reftiri¢tions, which may hereafter aﬁpeﬁ;‘-—_  
But in gencral, this is a truth which I have  
known for twenty years, though it has never  
been publicly avewed, to my knowledge,  
till mow. - B  
&#x27;~ 2 [am happy to sec what I confider as  
an acknowledgement, that my unpardona­  
ble fin against the federal party, orrather  
against those leading men, was the peace with  
France in 1800 ; an event which has given.  
this country cight years of its most splendid  
prosperity. The writer mentions the mil­  
iion to France in 1799, as a meafurec which  
brought odiem and ridicule on my adminif­  
gration. If you will allow me a little room  
in your PaTrioT, 1 may hereafter produce  
proofs to the fatisfaction of the public, that  
this measure was neither odious nor ridicu­  
lous. At this time I will only {end you a  
commuaidation from Gen: WasuINGTON,  
by which it will appear that the fubje&amp;  
was not seen by that great ornament of his  
country in the fame light in which this  
writer fces it. .  
Mount Vernon, 1 Feb. 1799.  
Dear Sz, - ‘  
The letter herewith enclosed, from  
Mr. Joel Barlow, though of old date,  
came-to my hands.only yelterday. . I  
have conceived ic to be my duty to  
transmit it to you without-delay and  
without a comment, except that&#x27; it  
must have been written with a very  
good or a very bad design—which of  
the two, you can judge better than L  
For, from the known abilities of that  
gentleman, such a letter could naqt be  
the result of ignorance, in 4imy nor  
fromshe implications which are to be  
foung in it, bas it been written with­  
out the privity of the French Direéto­  
ry. Itis incumbent on me to add,  
that I have not been in the habit of

F. Adams,\Prefident of the }&#x27; :

- The letter from Mr. Bartow, enclofedin  
General WasniNGgTON&#x27;s, is in these words—  
Paris, 2d Ot}. 1798,  
Slr,—On hearing of your late nom-:  
/ination as Commander in Chief of the  
- American armies, 1 rejoice at it, not  
because I believe the war which that  
nomination contemplates is yet inevit­  
. able, and that it will furnith an occa­  
sion for a further display of your mili­  
tary talents, but because it may enable  
you to exert your inflaence to a grea.  
ter effe&amp;, in preventing the war, by  
becoming “more the centre of infor­  
mation than you could be in your re­  
tirement, you will be better able to  
judge of the dispositions of both coun­  
tries, and to offer f{uch counsels to  
your government as may tend to re­  
move-the obstacles that will oppose  
themselves to a reconciliation—Were  
you now President of the United  
* ?tates, I thould not address you this  
“ letter, because, not knowing my in­  
clination for the tranquility of a re­  
tired life, you might think that I was  
seeking a place, or had.fome farther  
~obje&amp; in view, than the simple one of  
promoting peace between the two re­  
publics. - But I hope, under present  
- circumf@ances, that you will believe  
&#x27; my motive to be pure and unmixed,  
~and that the obje&amp; of my letter is to  
call your attention to the true fßtate  
of faéts.  
~ Perhaps few men, who cannot pre­  
tend to have been in the secrets of ei­  
ther government, are in a better situ­  
ation than myfelf to judge of the mo­  
~tives of both ; to assign the true cau­  
ses, and trace out the progress of their  
unhappy misunderstanding, or to ap­  
preciate their present dispositions,  
-pretensions and wifthes. lam certain  
there is none who labors more sincere­  
ly for the restoration of harmony, up­  
- on terms honorable to the United  
~ States and advantageous to the cause  
~of liberty.  
F I will not in this place go over the  
hiltory of past transactions. It would  
&#x27;~ be of little use.—The obje&amp; is to seize  
{ the malady in its present state and  
| try to arrelt its progress. The dis­  
pute at this moment may be charac­  
terized simply and literally speaking,  
} a mifunderflanding.—-1 cannot persuade  
myfelf to give it a barfher name, as  
it applies to either government. It  
is clear that neither of them has an  
interest in going to war with the oth­  
er, and I am equally convinced that  
neither of them had the inclination ;  
that is, I believe the baliance of in­  
clination as well as of interefl, on both  
sides, is in favor of peace. But each  
government, though sensible of this  
truth with refpe&amp; to itfelf, is ignorant  
of ity with refpe@ to the other. Each  
believes the other determined on war  
and ascribes all its condu&amp; to a deep­  
rooted hostility. The lealt they can  
do therefore under this impreflion, is  
to prepare for 3n event which they  
both believe inevitable, while they  
both with to avoid it. But by what  
fatality is it that a calamity so dread­  
ful must be rendered inevitable be­  
canfe it is thought so ? Both govern.  
meints have tongues and both have  
ears. Why will they not speak 2 Why  
will they not liten ? The causes that  
have hitherto prevented them are not  
difficult to aflign. - I‘could easily ex.  
plain them, as I believe, to the fatif­  
fa&amp;tion of both parties and without  
throwing so much blame on either  
| government, as each of them at pref­  
i ent ascribes to the other. - But I will  
avoid speaking of any past provoca-  
F tion on either fide. The point that I  
wish to eftablilb in your mind is, that  
} the French Dire&amp;ary is at present fin­  
gerely desirous of restoring harmony  
~ between this country and the United  
_States, on terms honorable and ad­  
- vantageous to both parties. I wish  
to convinee you of this, ‘and through  
you, the American government, be­  
cause that government being desirous  
of the fame thing, would not fail to  
take such steps as would lead imme­  
~ diately to the object. &lt;R  
- Inoffering you my proofs of the  
-present. disposition on this. fide, you  
will. permit me to observe, that some  
-of them are frog their nature incapa­  
ble of being dxiled, and othérs im­  
proper to be trusted to the casualties  
of a letter.—But I will men&#x27;tic;n a few  
that are-ostensible, and so far as they  
-go undeniable. First the Diretory  
- has declared that it will receive and  
~ treat with any Minister from Ameri­  
ca, who shall appear to be sent with a  
sincere intention of treating and ter­  
. minating exilting difficulties. L have  
-no doubt but this was the intention  
- when the last envoys were sent ; but  
+ from some unforfunate circum(tances  
the Dired@ory did not believe it. Sec­  
~ond, a 5 a preliminary, it has been de­  
clared that in ‘the. negociation there  
W“‘m@%gﬁmﬁwﬁﬁ  
*Mﬁ%k%w‘%w%w ﬁ  
20,y ot i g e S  
  
are issued, the owners and command.  
ers are to be reftried under bonds  
to the legal objeét of caprure.—Fou rthh  
an embargo that. was laid on Ameri­  
can {hips within -the republic, ig con-  
Tequence of a report- that war had  
been begun on the part of the United  
States, was taken off as soon as it was  
ascertained that fuch«war had not  
been begun. And a new declaration  
was at the {fame time sent to America  
of the wifthes of France to treat.—  
These fadts will doubtlels come to  
your knowledge through other chan-.  
nels, before you receive this letter.  
B~ut there are other faéts which in my  
mind are equally clear, thougli.to yon  
will be destitute of coroborating cir­  
cumstances and must rest on my own  
information and opinion. Ift. That  
this. government contemplates a just  
indemnity for spoliations on Ameri­  
can commerce, ta be ascertained by  
commissioners in a mannér similar to  
the one prescribed-in our treaty with  
England. 2d. That the legislation  
will soon be_c%dgbere with respect  
to neutrals, and “that all flags will be  
put on the footing of the law of na­  
tions. 3d. That a public agent would  
have been named and sent to Phila­  
delphia soon after Mr. Gerry’s depar­  
ture, were if not for the apprehensions  
that he would not have been received.  
There was a doubt whether the A­  
merican government would not have  
already taken such measures of hostili­  
ty as to be unwilling to liten to terms  
of accommodation, and the Dire&amp;ory  
did not choose to rifqae the chance of  
feeing its offers refufed. 4th. That  
the Diretory confiders these declara­  
tions and tranfaétions as a fufficient  
overtare on its part. ‘That it has re­  
treated to an open ground that is quite  
unfufpicious. That a refufal on the  
part of the American government to  
meet on this ground, will be followed  
by immediate war, and that it will be  
a war of the most terrible and vindic­  
tive kind.  
This, fir, is my view of the present  
slate of fa&amp;s. Should it make that  
impreflion on your mind, which I  
desire for the fake of humanity that  
it may, you will judge whether it does  
not comport with the independence of  
the United States and the dignity of  
theiz government, to fend another  
minister to form new treaties with the  
French republic. Ina war thereis  
clearly =mothing to -be gained by us,  
not even honor.-Honor indeed may  
be saved by war apd so it may be by  
negociation. But the. calamities in­  
feperable from a war of this kind, and  
under preflent eircumftances, would  
be incalculable.—l do not fay that  
the United Statesor &#x27;ary portion of  
them would be conquered ; but they  
would facrifice great numbers of their  
belt citizens, burthen themfeles with  
four times their present debt, overturn  
the purest system of morals, &amp; lose the  
faireft opporwunity that ever a nation  
had of rising to greatness and happi­  
ness on the basis of liberty.  
Were I&#x27;writing to 2 young Gener­  
al, whose name was still to be created,  
I might deem it useless to atk him to  
ftifle in its birth a war on which he  
had founded his hopes of future hon­  
ors. But you, fir, having already  
earned and acquired all those that  
can render 2 man great and happy,  
can surely haveno objet of ambition  
but to render your countryfo. To  
.engage your influence in favor of a  
new attempt at negociation, I tho’t  
it otly neceflary to convince you  
that such an attempt would be well  
reccived here, and probably attended  
with success. I can do no more than  
assure you that this is my sincere opin­  
ion,‘gnd that my information is drawn  
from unfulpeéted sources.  
I am not accustomed to interpose

The letter from Mr. Harlow, enclosed in  
General Washinton’s, is in these words:  
1‘akis, 2d Oct. 1708.  
I Sir.  
| ^ On hearing of your late nomination as  
Commander in Chief of the American ar­  
mies, I rejoice at it, not because I believe  
tlie war which that nomination contemplates  
is yet inevitable, and that it will furnish an  
| occasion for a further display of your milita­  
ry talents, but because it inuy enable von to  
| exert your influence to greater effect, in pre­  
venting the war, by becoming more the cen­  
| tre of information than you could be in your  
j retirement, you will be better able to judge  
j cf the dispositions of both countries, and to  
offer such counsels to your government as may  
tend to remove the bstacles that will oppose  
  
tnqjn selves to a reconciliation_Were you  
now President of the U. States, I should not  
address you this letter, because, not knowing  
my inclination for the tranquility of a .retired  
life, you might think that I was seeking a  
place, or had some farther object in view,  
than the simple one of promoting peace be­  
tween the two republics. But I hope, under  
present circumstances, Inal you will believe  
iny motive to be pure and unmixed, and that  
the object of nr letter is to call your atten­  
tion to the true state of facts.  
Perhaps few men, who cannot pretend to  
have been in the secrets of cither government,  
are in a better situation than my self to judge  
ot the motives ot both ; to assign the true  
causes, and trace out the progress of their !  
unhappy misunderstanding, or to appreciate  
their present dispositions, pretensions and  
wishes. lam certain there is none who la­  
bors more sincerely for the restoration of har­  
mony, upon terms honorable to the United  
States and advantageous to the cause of li­  
berty.  
I will not in this place go over the history  
of past transactions. It would be of littiw  
use.— The object ;s to seize the malady in  
its present state and try to arrest its pro­  
IT c:ss. The dispute at this moment maybe  
I characterized simply and literally speaking,  
a misandcrstandini&#x27;*—1 cannot persuade  
myself to give it a harsher name, as it ap­  
plies to either government. It is clear that  
neither of them lias .an interest in going to  
war with the other, and 1 am equally con­  
vinced that neither of them had the inclina­  
tion ; that is, I believe the balance of inclina­  
tion as well as of interest, on both sides, is  
in favor of peace. But each government,  
though sensible of this truth with respect  
to itself, is ignorant of it, with respect to the  
other. Each believes the other determined  
on war, and ascribes all its conduct to a deep­  
rooted hostility. The least they can do,  
therefore under this impression, is to pre­  
pare for an event which they both believe in­  
evitable, while they both wish to avoid it.— :  
But by what fatality is it, that a calamity so  
dreadful must be rendered inevitable because  
it is thought so? Both governments have  
tongues and both have ears. Why will they  
not speak i

I deuce of the United States end the dignity  
of iltc i&#x27;- government, to send another minis­

public. In a war, there is clearly nothing to  
be gained by us, not even honor. Honor in­  
deed may be saved by war, and so it may be  
by negociation. But the calamities insepa­  
rable from a war of this kind, and under  
present circumstances, would be incalcula­  
ble. I do not say that the United States or  
any portion of them would be conquered;  
but they would sacrifice great numbers of  
their best citizens, burthen themselves with  
four times their present debt, overturn the  
purest system of morals, and lose the fair­

rising to greatness and happiness 0*1 the ba­

I Were I writing to a young General, whose  
name wasstiiito be created, I might deem it  
useless to ask him to stifle in its birth, a war  
•n which he had founded his hopes of future  
honors. But you, sir, having already earned  
and acquired all those that can render a man  
great and happy, can surely have no object  
of ambition but to render your country so  
To engage your influence in flavor of anew  
attempt at negoeiation, I thought it only ne­  
cessary to convince you, that such an attempt  
would be well received here, and probably  
attended with success. I can do no more than  
assure you that this is my sincere opinion,  
and that my information is drawn from un­  
  
bus[jecieu sources.  
I am not accustomed to interpose my ad­  
[viceinthe administration of any country,  
and should not have done it now, did I not  
ibelieve it my duty as a citizen of my own,  
and a friend to all ethers. I see two great  
{nations rushing on each other’s bayonets,  
without any other cause of contention but  
a misunderstanding. I shudder at the pros -  
pect, and wish to throw myself between the  
vans, and suspend the onset, till a word of  
explanation can pass. I hope my letter wii:

but if it shall not, 1 hope you will excuse

Neither Mr. Barlow’s letter nor General  
Washington’s opinion would have influ­  
enced me to nominate a minister, if I had not  
received abundant assurances to the same ef­  
fect from ^regular diplomatic sources. I,  
however, considered Gen. Washington’s  
question whether Mr. Barlow’s was writ­

and as with all my jealousy I had not saga­  
city enough to discover the smallest room for  
suspicion of any ill design, I frankly conclud -

I tv &gt;s glad to see in ycnr paper of the

timore Federal Republican, for many re«T„  
sons, whicli may l»w explained in due time ;  
one or tw » nmv he *i*r«-d now.  
1. I was pleased with the candid ncknow­  
h figment, that &quot; Mr. Adams never was a  
f.ivoriTe with the trading mrn of the federal  
party.” The words hading wh will re­  
quire gome explanation and some limitations  
and restrictions, \vluch may hereafter ap­  
pear. But in general, this:s a truth which  
I have known for twenty years, though it  
has never been publicly avowed, to my  
knowledge, till now.  
2. I ani happy to see what I consider as  
nn acknowledgment, that my unpardona­  
ble sin against the iederal party, or rather  
against tlio^e tending men, was the pe-&lt;ce  
wiih France in 18C0: an event which has  
given this counliy eudit years ol its most  
splendid prosperity. The wiitcr mentions  
die mission to France in 1799, ns a meas­  
ure which brought odium and ridicule on  
my administration. If you will allow me  
a little room in your Patriot, 1 may here­  
after produce proofs to the satisfaction o{

a very bad design-—which of the two, you can  
judge better than I. T&#x27;or, from the known  
abifities of that gentleman, such a letter could  
not be the resuit of ignorance, in Aim, nor  
from the implications which are to be found  
in it, has it been written without the privity  
of the French Directory —lt is incumbent on  
me to add, that I have not been in the habit  
of corresponding with Mr. Barlow.” The ‘ct­

however small, of restoring peice and &#x27; tran­  
quiity to the United- States, Wipon just, hon­  
ourable and dignified terms, which lam fier­  
wugded ia the ardent desire of ail the friends  
of this rising Empire. With great consider­

THE RHODE-ISLAND ‘REPUBLICAN.  
  
sclves o &amp; reconciliation—\Were you now.  
President of the United States, I slouid not’  
address you this letter, hecause, not kuo:vlﬁ&#x27;  
my inclination for the tranquility of u re :  
life, you mignt think that 1 was séeking a’  
place, or had some farther object in \ft&#x27;,s:  
than the simple ene of promoting peace be­  
tween the two republicks. But 1 hope, under  
present circumstances, that you will believe  
my mod{e to be rure and unmixed, und that  
the object of my letter is to call your stten­  
tion to the true state of facts.  
  
Perhaps few men, who caunot pretend to  
have been in the sccrets of cither govern­  
ment, mdin t&#x27;:ger !it;xaticn tlu:an“l myself  
to judge potives of both ;to &#x27;n the  
M trace out the bmh‘u\‘éf“  
their pnhnpﬂy misunderstending, or to 31  
preciate their present dispositions, pretens  
sions and wishies. 1 am certain thers is none  
who tabours more sineerely fo re i  
of hurmory, upon terras hunoy ¢ tothe U,  
States and advantageons to the canse of liber  
¥ will not in this pis Kéow :  
of past transs &lt;Tt would ‘bedof 3  
use—The object if 10 seizy the malady in its  
present state’ and ‘try to ffrest itS progress.  
The dispute ut his Temient may be. gha  
m hina &quot;“M fe R j&quot;‘\’t &quot;t  
v rshr wmth 1 i 1 e  
government. Itiselear that icither of them  
fgunn interest in golbg to war with the other  
and lam equaily convihced that riw; of  
them had the inclimation ; that believe  
the balance of&#x27;inclination as wéll as of inter­  
¢st, on both sides,is in favour of peace. But  
each govermment, though sensible of this toath  
‘with rospectto itself, ‘is ‘%:oram of it, with  
rrespect to the other. Fach believes the other  
determined on m.r, and ascribes all its  
‘condnet, to g deep-rooted *hostility, The.  
least they can do thercfore under this impres­  
sion, is to prepare for an event which thyy  
both believe incviteble, while they both wish  
to avoud it. But by what fatality is it that a  
calamity so dreadful must be rendered inevits  
able because it js thought so ? Both govern­  
ments have tongucs and both have ears. Wh{  
will they not speak ? Why will they not listend.  
The causes that have hitherto prevented them  
are not difficult to assign. I could easily ex.  
plain them, as I belicve, to the satisfaction of  
Eoth parties and without throwing so much  
lame on elther government, as each of them  
:; .sne‘scnt ascribcfs to the other. But I will  
&#x27; speakifg of any past, provocation on  
either side. &#x27;%’he po{ntl:.hnt IpWilh to estabs,  
lish in your mind is, that the French Direg  
tory, is at present sincerely desirous of restor­  
ing harmony between this country m“t!); ,  
United States, on terms hopourable ad­  
vantageouns to both parties, 1 wish to con­  
vince you of this,and” thrcugh yousthe Amer­  
ican government, because that government  
being desirous of the same thing, would. not  
fuil to take such steps as would lcad immedi­  
ately to the object.  
In offering you my proofs of the present  
disposition on this side, you will permit me  
‘3 observe, that some of them are from their  
nature incapable of being detailedy and others .  
improper to bz trusted to the casuvalties of a  
letter ~But I will mention a few that are  
ostensible, and so far as they (go undeniable.  
First, the Directory has declared that it will  
receive and treat with any Minister from A­  
merica, who shall appear to be sent wiih a  
sincere intention of treating and terminating  
existing difficulties. I have no doubt but this  
was the intentibn when the last Envoys were  
sent ; but from some unfortunete circums  
stances the Directory did not believe it. Se­  
cond, as a preitminary, it has been declared  
that in the negocidtion there shall be no ques­  
tion of leans of money, or apologies for offen­  
sive speeches pronounced by the executive  
on &amp;ither side. &#x27;Third, all commigsions given.  
to privateers in the West-Indies are recalled  
and when new commissions are issuedy the  
‘owners and commandeérs are to be restricted  
under bonds, to the legal object of capturc.—-  
Pourth, dn embargo that was laid on Ameri­  
cen ships within the republick,in consequence  
of a report that war had been begun on the  
part of the United States, was taken off as  
soon as it was ¢scertained that such war hed  
not been begun. And a new declanation was  
at the same time sent 10 Ameriea of %  
wishes of Frunge to treat. These facts  
“doubtless con¥ to your knowledge tbﬂ’uth  
other channefs, before you receive this letter,  
But there are other facts which j»my mind  
are equally clear, though to yox will be des­  
titute of cor aﬁ&amp; cirpamstances and  
must reston my own infermation and opinion

: Sirs -I was glad to ac? irv your pa­  
per of the. f th of this momh, the ex­  
tract frqm he Baltimore -Federal Re­  
publican, for many reasons, &quot;wliicli; may  
be explained in due time ; one or twoJ  
may be seated now. )  
1. I was pleased with&#x27; the candid ac  
knowkdgement, that&quot; Mr. Adams ne-  
vtr was a faroriteiwiih the leading men  
of the federal party.&quot; The yvoids read­  
ing men will require some&#x27; explanation  
and some limitations arjd restrictions)  
which may hereafter appear.- But in  
general ,x this is a ! truth which I have  
known for twenty jye;ars, though ip has  
never been publicijr avowed, to my  
knowledge till now &#x27; r h  
2. I am happyi to see what I consi  
der as an acknowledgement that my  
unpardona jlt sin against the federal p :i -  
ty, or rather against those leading ven,  
was the peace with France in. 1800 ; at:  
event which has given this counvry eight  
years of its- most plencfid prosperity.  
The writer, mentions the mission, to  
France in 1799,-; as a measure; which  
broucht odiuin &amp; ridicule onmy admi-  
nistration . It yoii will allow me a little  
room in yOur Patriot, I may hereaf  
ter produce proof to the satisfaction of  
the public, that this measure was nei  
ther odious nor ridiculous. At this.time  
will only send you a communication  
from Gcri. Washington, by which it  
will appear that, the subject was not  
seen by that great ornament of this coun.  
try in the same light in which this wri­  
ter sees it. &#x27;

duty to transmit it to you without delay.

maM have been written with a very good  
or a very bad designs which of the two  
you can judge better than 1. For from  
the known abiliues of that gentkman,

Sirt I was elad to see in vour naner of the 7th  
  
of this month, the extract from tke &quot; Baltimore Fe­  
deral Republican,&quot; for many reasons, which may be  
explained ia due time ; one or two may be stated  
now.  
1. I was pleased with the candid acknowledge­  
ment, that &quot; Mr. Adams never was a favourite with  
the leading men of the federal party.&quot; The words  
leading men&#x27; will require some explanation, and  
some limitations and restrictions, which may hereaf­  
ter appear. But in eeneral, this is a truth which I  
  
have known for tweuty years, though it has never  
been publicly avowed, to my knowledge, till now.  
2. I am happy to see what I consider as an ac­  
knowledgment, that my unpardonable sin against  
the federal party, or rather against those leading  
men,&#x27; was the peace with France in lt00 : an event  
which has given this country eight years of its most  
splendid prosperity. The writer mentions the mis­  
sion to France in 1799, as a measure whjch brought  
odium and ridicule on my admipistration. If you  
will allow me a little room in your Patriot, I may  
hereafter produce proofs to the satisfaction of the  
public, that this measure was neither odious nor ri­  
diculous. At thisf time I will only send you acom­  
munication from Gen. Washington, by which it pifl  
uppear, that the subject was not eeen bjrthit great

Moumt Vernon, Feb. , 1799.  
Dear Sir The letter herewith enclosed, from  
Mr. Joel Barlow, though of old date, came to my  
  
hands only yesterday. I have conceived It to be my  
  
duty to transmit it to you without delay and without  
a comment, except that it must have been written  
with a very good or a very bad design which of  
the twos you can judge better than I. &#x27; For, from the  
known abilities of that gentleman, such a letter could  
not be the result of ignorance, in him, nor from the  
implications which are to t found in it, has it been  
written without the privity of the French directory.  
It is incumbent on me to add, that I have not been  
in the habit of corresponding with Mr, Barlow.  
The letter now forwarded is the first I ever receiv­  
ed from him t and to him I have never written one.  
If then you should be of opinion, that his ia calcula­  
ted to bring on negociation upon open, Cor and ho­  
nourable ground, and merits a reply, and will in­  
struct me as to the tenor of it, I shall with pleasure  
  
and alacrity obey your orders more essecially if  
  
there is reason to believe that it would become a  
mean, however small, of restoring peace and tran­  
quility to the United States, upon just, honourable  
and dignified terms, which I am persuaded it the ar­  
dent desire of all thefriends of this rising emtires  
With great consideration and respect, I have the  
honour to be, 8tc.  
  
G. WASHINGTON.  
J. Adams, President of the U. S.  
The letter from Mr. Barlow, enclosed in General Wash  
inirtoii&#x27;s, is in these words :  
  
Paris, 2nd October, 1798. &#x27;  
Sir On hearing of your late nomination as com  
mander in chief of the American armies, I rejoiced  
at it, not because I believe the war which that nomi  
  
nation contemplates is yet inevitable, and that it will  
  
tunush an occasion for a further display ot your mi­  
litary talents, but because it may enable you to exert  
your influence to a greater effect, in preventing the  
war ; by becoming more the centre of information  
than you could be in your retirement, you will be  
better able to judge of Ute dispositions of both coun  
  
tries, and to offer such counsels to your government  
  
as may tend to remove the obstacles that wul op  
  
pose themselves to a reconciliation. Were you now  
  
President of the United States I should not address  
you this letter, because, not knowing my inclination  
for the tranquility of a retired life, you might think  
  
that 1 was seeking a place, or had some Luther ob  
  
ject in view, than the simple one of promoting  
  
peace between the two republics. But I hope, un  
  
der present circumstances, that you will believe my  
  
motive to be pure and unmixed, and tbuL the ob  
  
ject of rrty letter is to call your attention to the true  
  
state of tacts.  
  
Perhaps few men, who cannot pretend to have  
  
been in the secrets of either government, are in  
  
letter situation than myself to judge of the motives  
  
of both ; to assign the true causes, and trace out the  
  
progress of their unhappy misunderstanding, or to  
  
appreciate their present dispositions, pretensions  
  
and wishes. I am certain the,re is none who la  
  
bours more sincerely for the restoration of harmony,  
  
upon terms honourable to the Un ted States and ad  
  
vantageous to the cause of liberty.  
  
1 will not m this place go over the history of past  
  
transactions. It would be of little use. i he object  
  
is to seize the malady in its present state and try to  
  
arrest its progress. 1 he dispute at this moment  
  
may be characterized, simply and literally speaking  
  
a misunderstanding. I cannot penuade myself to  
give H a harsher name, as it applies to either go  
  
vernment. It is clear that neither of them has a

doubt but tlds was the intention when the last envoys  
  
were sent ; but from some unfortunate circumstan  
  
ces the directory did not believe it. Second, as a  
  
preliminary, it has peen declared that in the ncgo  
  
nation there shall be no quest  
  
or apologies for offensive speeches  
  
the Lxecutivojon either side.  
  
ions given to privateers in the West-Indies are re,  
called, and when new com mi salons are issued, th  
owners and commander are to be restricted under .  
bonds, to the legal object of &#x27;Capture. Fourth, art  
embargo that was laid od American ship within  
the republic in consequence of a report that war had  
been begun on the part of the U. States, was taken  
off as sood as it was ascertained that auch war had  
not been begun ; and ft new declaration wa at the  
same time sent to America of the wishes of France  
to treat. These facts, will doubtless come to your  
knowledge through other channels, before you re­  
ceive this letter. But there are other facts which io  
my mi.d are equally, clear, though they will be des  
titute of corroborating circumstances, and must res  
on my own information and opinion. 1st That this  
government contemplates a just indemnity tor spo­  
liations on American commerce, to be ascertained,  
by commissioners in a manner similar to the ona  
prescribed in our treaty with England. 2d That  
the legislation will soon be changed here with re  
spect to neutrals, and that all fLgs will be put on the  
footing of the law of nations. 3 That public a-  
  
gent would nave been named and sent toPhil-wel-phia  
soon after Mr. Gerry&#x27;s departure, were it not  
  
lor tne apprehensions that he would not nave been  
  
received. TheT Wi.s a doubt whether the Ameri- i  
  
can government would not Lave already taken such&#x27;  
measures of hostility as to be unwilling to listen to ,  
  
terms of Accommodation, and the directory did not &#x27;&#x27;&quot;&#x27; .  
  
choose to,-risque the chance ot seeing its offers re,  
fused, i-ita That the directory considers these dW  
clarationtr and transactions as a sufficient overture an  
  
its part. That it has retreated to an open ground  
that is quite unsuspicious. That refusal on the  
part of the American government to meet on this  
ground, will be followed by immediate war, and thaV  
it will be a war of the raost, terrible and vindictive  
  
kind. &#x27;- &#x27; &quot; &#x27; --&#x27;v-nV&quot; n--  
  
This, sir, is my view of the Dresent&#x27;state of facta. . &#x27; .  
  
Should itmake that impression on your mind, which &quot;  
I desire for the sake of humanity that it may, you  
will judge whether it does not comport with the in­  
dependence of the. U, States and the dignity of their  
government, to send another minister to form new  
treaties with the French republic, Ina war there is ,  
  
clearly nothing to oe gained oy us, not even nonour,  
Honour indeed may be saved by war, and so it may  
be by negociation. But the calamities inseparable  
from a war of this kind,&#x27;and under present ciTUitw  
stances, would be incalculable. I do not say&#x27; that  
  
the United States or any portion of them would be  
  
connuered ; but they would sacrifice great numbers r  
  
of their best citizens, burthen themselves with four .  
  
times their present debt, overturn the purest system  
of morals and lose the fairest opportunity that ever 1  
  
a nation had of rising tp greatness and happiness on  
the basis of liberty. &quot; &#x27; &#x27;&#x27; &#x27; 7 &quot;&#x27; :i  
  
Were I writing to a young general, whose name) 1  
  
was still to be created, I might deem it useless to  
ask him to stifle in its birth a war on which he had  
  
founded his hopes of future honours. But you, sir,

can render a man great and happy, can surely have

no more than assure you tjiat this is my jncere  
opinion, and that my information ig draVn from un  
  
suspected sources. .  
I arn not accustomed to interpose my advice in  
the administration of any country, and should not  
have done it now did I believe it my duty as ,  
citizen of my own, and a friend to all others. I see  
two great nations rushing on each pthert bayonets,  
without any other cause of contention but a mismin  
derstanding. I shudder at the prospect and wish to  
throw myself between the vans, and suspend the ony  
set, till a word of explanation can pass. - I hope my  
letter will have thrown some light upon the subject;  
but if it shall not, I hope you will excuse the at?&#x27;

To General Washington. ,- tf &quot; &#x27; f .  
Neither Mr. Barlow&#x27;s letter nor general Washt &#x27;  
ington&#x27;s opinion would have influenced me to nqnn­  
nate a minister, if I had not received abundan as­  
surances to the same effect from regular diplomatic  
sources.. I, however, considered general Washing­  
ton&#x27;s question, whether Mr. Barlow&#x27;s was written  
with a very good or a very bad design ;, and as with  
all my jealousy I had not sagacity enough to disco-?,  
ycr the smallest room for suspicion of any ill design,  
I frankly concluded that it Was written ith a very  
good one. i .&#x27;; &#x27;  
From general Washington&#x27;s letter it appears

peace upon just, honourable and dignified term  
  
was the aident desire ot all the mends ot th rising
