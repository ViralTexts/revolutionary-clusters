To the Senate and   
House of Representatives of the US  
March 19. 1806.  
  
It was reasonably expected that while the limits between the territories of the US. and of Spain were  
unsettled, neither party would have innovated on the existing state of their respective positions. some time since  
however, we learnt that the Spanish authorities were advancing into the disputed country, to occupy new posts &amp; make new  
settlements. unwilling to take any measure which might preclude a peaceable accomodation of differences, the officers of  
the US. were ordered to confine themselves within the country on this side of the Sabine river, which, by delivery of it’s  
principal post Natchitoches was understood to have been itself delivered up by Spain; and, at the same time, to permit no  
adverse post to be taken, nor armed men to remain within it. in consequence of these orders, the commanding officer at  
Natchitoches, learning that a party of Spanish troops had crossed the Sabine river, &amp; were posting themselves on  
this side the Adaïs, sent a detachment of his force to require them to withdraw to the other side of the Sabine, which  
they accordingly did.  
I have thought it proper to communicate to Congress the letters detailing this incident, that they may fully  
understand the state of things in that quarter, &amp; be enabled to make such provision for it’s security as, in their  
wisdom, they shall deem sufficient

From the Prosident of the United States to  
both Houses of Congress, relative to Span­  
ish innovations on the Sabine river, March  
19th, 1800.  
It was reasonably expectod that while the  
limits between the territorics of the United  
States and of Spain were unsettled, leither  
party would have innovated on the existing  
State of their respective positions; some time  
since, however, we learnt that the Spanish  
authorities were advancing into the diaputed  
country to becupy now posts and make new  
sottiements--unwilling to take any measures  
which might preclude a peaceable accomme­  
dation of differences, the officers of the Uni-  
ted States wore orderod to confine themselves  
within the country on this side the Sabins  
river, which, by the delivery of its principal  
post, Natchitoches, was understood to have  
been itself delivored up by Spain; and, at the  
same time, to permit no adverse port to be  
taken, nor armed men to temain within it.  
In consequence of these orders, the com-  
manding officer at Natchitoches learning that  
a party of Spanish troops had crossed the  
Sabino river, and were posting themselves  
on this side the Adais, sent a detachment of  
his forces to require them to withdraw to the  
other side of the Sabine, which they accord.  
ingly did.  
I have thought it proper to communicate to  
Congress the letters detailing this incident,  
that they may fully understand the state of  
things in that quarter, and be onabled to make  
such provisions for its security as in their  
wisdom they shall deem sufficient.
