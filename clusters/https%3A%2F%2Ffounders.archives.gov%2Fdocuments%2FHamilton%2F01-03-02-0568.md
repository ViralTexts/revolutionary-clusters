pedient. The extension of the authority of the delegates to the final establishment of the alterations to be agreed upon is in our opinion indispensable. The prospect of an unanimous concurrence of all the particular Societies in any plan, which might be referred to their ultimate deliberations, would be remote; And the objects of the Society are too simple and limited to require such a referrence.  
Before we dismiss the Subject of the proposed alterations, we shall submit an observation on that part of them, which relates to the exclusion of the clause, by which it is made a fundamental principle of the Society: “To promote and cherish between the respective States that Union and national honor so essentially necessary, to their happiness and the future dignity of the American empire.”  
We flatter ourselves, we speak the sense of the Society of which we are members, as well as our own, in declaring, that we reverence the sentiment contained in that clause, too much to be willing to see it expunged. Nor can we believe that its continuance will on reflection, give umbrage to any whose views are not unfriendly to those principles which form the Basis of the Union and the only sure foundation of the tranqu

cinles laid down tor the basis of the association  
were an &#x27; incessant attention to preserve inviolate
