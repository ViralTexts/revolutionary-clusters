The VI Article of the Constitution of the U States declares that “that Constitution and the laws of the U States made in pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the U States, shall be the Supreme law of the land, any thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.” A law of the land till revoked or annulled by the competent authority is binding not less on each branch or department of the Government than on each Individual of the Society. Each house of Congress collectively as well as the members of it separately are under a constitutional obligation to observe the injunctions of a preexisting law and to give it effect. If they act otherwise they infringe the constitution; the theory of which knows in such case no discretion on their part. To resort to first principles for their justification in assuming such a discretion is to go out of the constitution for an authority which they cannot find in it—it is to usurp the original character of the people themselves—it is in principle to prostrate the Government.

 the objection to it in point of constitutionality cannot be supported, let me ask who is the man hardy enough to maintain that the instrument is of such a nature as to justify a revolution in Government?  
If this can be answered in the affirmative, adieu to all the securities which nations expect to deri⟨ve⟩ from Constitutions of Government. They become mere bubbles subject to be blown away by every breath of party. The precedent would be a fatal one. Our Government from being fixed and limited would become revolutionary and arbitrary. All the provisions, which our Constitution with so much solemnity ordains “for forming a more perfect union, establishing justice, insuring domestic tranquillity, providing for the common defence, promoting the general welfare and securing the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our Posterity”, evaporate and disappear.  
Equally will this be the case if the rage of party spirit can meditate, if the momentary ascendancy of party in a particular branch of the Govt. can effect and if the people can be so deceived as to tolerate, that the pretence of a violation of the constitution shall be made the instrument of its actual v

The 1st article declares that “all legislative powers granted by the Constitution shall be vested in a Congress of the U States which shall consist of a senate &amp; House of Representatives.”  
The 2d article, which organises and regulates the Executive Department, declares that “the Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the U States of America” and, proceeding to detail particular authorities of the Executive, it declares that “The President shall have power, by and with the advice and cons

ion, that Congress shall “have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.” This is equivalent to affirming that all the objects upon which the legislative power may act in relation to our own Country are excepted out of the power to make Treaties.  
Two obvious considerations refute this doctrine. One that the power to make Treaties and the power to make laws are different things, operating by different means, upon different subjects, the other, that the construction resulting from such a doctrine would defeat the power to make Treaties; while its opposite reconciles this power with the power of making laws.  
  
The power to make laws is “the power of pronouncing authoritatively the will of the Nation as to all persons and things over which it has jurisdiction”; or it may be defined to be “the power of prescribing rules binding upon all persons and things over which the nation has jurisdiction.” It acts compulsively upon all persons,
