phia for Pittsburg &amp; the western country may be sent by various routes with little difference in point of distance, &amp; that mail carriers are employed on each.   
The words of the act go merely to designate various post roads, they no where require the postmaster general to include specific parts in one contract or require the mail for any portion to be carried by the same hand. Neither does it require that the particular mails from Philadelphia for Pittsburg shall be sent by any specific route.  
The 1st sect. of the act to establish the post office, among other things designates the duties of the postmaster general—“He shall provide for the carriage of the mail on all postroads that are or may be established by law &amp; as often as he having regard to the productiveness thereof and other circumstances shall think proper.” These are the only clauses or acts that relate to the subject. We consider that from Philadelphia by Lancaster Elizabethtown, Middletown &amp; Harrisburg to Carlisle is as much a post road as from Philadelphia by Lancaster, &amp; Yorktown to Carlisle &amp; it has always been a practice to include such portions of post road in a particular contract without r

2nd. That the carriage of the mail on the part of a post road, from York to Carlisle was discontinued?  
In the 1st. section of the act to establish the post office, the postmaster general is authorised to “direct the route or road where there are more than one between places designated by law for a post road, which route shall be considered the post road.” From York to Carlisle there are several routes or roads, the mail has usually been carried on the nearest route through Dover, but this was never designated as the postroad by the postmaster general but it was left to the carriers to take which route they pleased, on this road there is no post office &amp; I have not heard that there is any place where one would be useful. But by another road from
