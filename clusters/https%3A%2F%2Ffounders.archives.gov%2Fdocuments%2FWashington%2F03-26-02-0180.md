Certain I am that unless Congress speaks in a more decisive tone—unless they are vested with powers by the several States competent to the great purposes of War—or assume them as matter of right; and they, and the states respectively, act with more energy than they hitherto have done, that our Cause is lost. We can no longer drudge on in the old way. By ill-timing the adoption of measures—by delays in the execution of them—or by unwarrantable jealousies, we incur enormous expences, and derive no benefit from them—One state will comply with a requisition of Congress—another neglects to do it—a third executes it by halves—and all differ in the manner—the matter—or so much in point  
  
of time, that we are always working up hill, &amp; ever shall be (while such a system as the present one—or rather want of one prevails) unable to apply our strength or resources to any advantage.  
This my dear Sir is plain language to a member of Congress—but it is the language of truth &amp; friendship—It is the result of long thinking—close application—&amp; strict observation—I see one head gradually changing into thirteen—I see one Army branching into thrteen—&amp; instead of looking up to Congress as the supreme controuling power of the united States—are considering themselves as dependent on their respective States—In a word, I see the powers of Congress declining too fast for the consequence &amp; respect which is due to them as the grand representative body of America, and am fearful of the consequences of it.

&quot;This, my dear Sir, is plain language to a

long thinking, close application, and strict ob­

thirteen, and instead of looking up to Congress  
as the Supreme controlling power of the Coun­

their respective States. In a word, I see the  
power of Congress declining too fast the con­  
sequence and respect which are due to them  
as the great representative body of America,  
and am fearful of the consequences.
