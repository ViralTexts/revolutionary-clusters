Brest May 27th 1778  
  
I have now to fulfil the promise made in my last by giving you an Account of my late Expedition. I sailed from Brest the 10th of April. My Plan was extensive: I therefore did not at the beginning wish to incumber myself with Prisoners. On the 14th I took a Brigantine between Scilly and Cape Clear bound from Ostend with a Cargo of Flax-seed for Ireland; sunk her and proceeded into St. Georges Channell. On the 16th I took the Ship Lord Chatham bound from London for Dublin, with a Cargo consist­ing of Porter and a variety of Merchandize; and almost within sight of her Port: this Ship I manned and Ordered for Brest.  
Towards the Evening of the day following the Weather had a promising appearance and the Wind being favorable I stood over from the Isle of Man with an intention to make a descent at Whitehaven: at Ten I was off the Harbour with a party of Volunteers, and had every thing in readiness to land, but before Eleven the Wind greatly increased, and shifted so as to blow directly upon the shore; the Sea encreased of course and it became impossible to effect a landing: this Obliged me to carry all possible sail so as to clear the Land and to await a more favorable Opportunity.  
On the 18th in Glenluce Bay on the South Coast of Scotland I met with a Revenue Wherry; it being the common practice of these Vessels to board Merchant Ships, the Ranger then having no external appearance of War, it was expected that this rover would have come alongside: I was however mistaken, for tho the Men were at their Quarters yet this Vessel outsailed the Ranger and got clear in spite of a severe Cannonade.  
The next Morning off the Mull of Galloway I found myself so near a Scotch coasting Schooner loaded with Barley that I could not avoid sinking her. Understanding that there was Ten or Twelve sail of Merchant Ships, besides a Tender Brigantine with a number of Impressed Men on board, at Anchor in Loughryan in Scotland I thought this an Enterprize worth my attention but the Wind, which at the first would have served equally well to sail in or out of the Lough, shifted in a hard Squall so as to blow almost directly in with an appearance of bad Weather; I was therefore obliged to abandon my Project.  
Seeing a Cutter off the Lee Bow steering for the Clyde I gave chace in hopes of cutting her off; but finding my endeavours ineffectual I pursued no further than the Rock of Elza. In the Morning I fell in with a Sloop from Dublin which I sunk to prevent Intelligence.  
The next day the 21st being near Carrickfergus a Fishing boat came off which I detained: I saw a Ship at Anchor in the Road which I was informed by the Fishermen was the British Ship of War Drake of 20 Guns. I determined to Attack her in the Night: my Plan was to overlay her Cable and to fall upon her Bow so as to have all her decks open and exposed to our Musquetry &amp;ca. at the same time it was my intention to have secured the Enemy by Graplings so that had they cut their Cables they would not thereby have attained an Advantage. The Wind was high, and unfortunately the Anchor was not let go so soon as the Order was given; so that the Ranger was brought up on the Enemies quarter at the distance of half a Cables length. We had made no Warlike appearance, of course had given no Alarm; this determined me to cut immediately, which might appear as if the Cable had parted; and at the same time enable me, after making a Tack out of the Lough, to return with the same Prospect of advantage which I had at the first: I was however prevented from returning; as I with difficulty weathered the Light house on the Lee side of the Lough, and as the Gale increased. The Weather now became so very Stormy and severe and the Sea ran so high that I was obliged to take Shelter under the South Shore of Scotland.  
The 22d introduced fair Weather; tho the Three Kingdoms as far as the Eye could reach were covered with Snow. I now resolved once more to attempt Whitehaven: but the Wind became very light so that the Ship could not, in proper time, approach so near as I had intended. At Midnight I left the Ship with two Boats and 31 Volunteers: When we reached the outer Peir the day began to dawn; I would not however abandon my Enterprize, but dispatched One boat under the direction of Mr. Hill and Lieutenant Wallingsford with the necessary combustables to set fire to the Shipping on the North side of the Harbour; while I went with the other party to attempt the South side. I was successful in scaling the Walls and Spiking up all the Cannon on the first Fort; finding the Sentinals shut up in the Guard house they were secured without being hurted; having fixed Sentinals, I now took with me one Man only (Mr. Green) and spiked up all the Cannon on the Southern Fort, distant from the other a Quarter of a Mile.  
On my return from this Business I naturally expected to see the Fire of the Ships on the North side as well as to find my own party with every thing in readiness to set Fire to the Shipping on the South. Instead of this I found the Boat under the direction of Mr. Hill and Lt. Wallingsford returned, and the party in some confusion, their Light having burnt out at the instant when it became necessary. By the strangest Fatallity my own Party were in the same situation, the Candles being all burnt out: The day too came on apace yet I would by no means retreat while any hopes of Success remained. Having again placed Sentinals a light was obtained at a House disjoined from the Town; and Fire was kindled in the Steerage of a large Ship which was surrounded by at least an Hundred and Fifty others, chiefly from Two to Four hundred Tons burthen, and laying side by side aground, unsurrounded by the Water.  
There was besides from Seventy to an Hundred large Ships in the North Arm of the Harbour aground clear of the Water and divided from the rest only by a stone peir of a Ships height. I should have kindled Fires in other places if the time had permitted. As it did not, our care was to prevent the one kindled from being easily extinguished: after some search a Barrell of Tar was found and powered into the Flames, which now asscended from all the Hatch ways. The Inhabitants began to appear in Thousands and Individuals ran hastily towards us. I stood between them and the Ship on Fire with a pistol in my hand and ordered them to retire which they did with precipitation. The Flames had already caught the Rigging and began to ascend the Main Mast. The Sun was a full Hours march above the Horizon; and as Sleep no longer ruled the World, it was time to retire: we embarked without Opposition; having released a number of Prisoners as our Boats could not carry them. After all my People had embarked I stood upon the Peir for a considerable space yet no person advanced. I saw all the Emeninces round the Town covered with the amazed Inhabitants.  
When we had rowed to a considerable distance from the shore the English began to run in vast numbers to their Forts. Their disappointment may easily be imagined when they found I suppose at least Thirty heavy Cannon (the Instruments of their Vengeance) rendered useless. At length however they began to Fire. Having as I apprehend either brought down Ships Guns or used One or two Cannon which lay on the Beach at the foot of the Walls dismounted and which had not been spiked. They Fired with no direction and the Shot falling short of the Boats, instead of doing us any dammage afforded some diversion; which my People could not help shewing by discharging their Pistols &amp;ca: in return of the Salute.  
Had it been possible to have landed a few hours sooner my Success would have been complete: not a single Ship out of more than Two hundred could possibly have escaped; and all the World would not have been able to save the Town. What was done however is sufficient to shew, that not all their boasted Navy can protect their own Coasts—and that the Scenes of distress which they have occasioned in America may soon be brought home to their own doors. One of my People was missing and must, I fear, have fallen into the Enemies hands after our departure. I was pleased that in this Business we neither Killed nor Wounded. I brought off Three Prisoners as a sample.  
We now stood over for the Scotch shore and I Landed at noon on St. Marys Isle with one Boat only and a very small party. The Motives which induced me to land there are explained in the within Copy of a Letter which I have written to the Countess of Selkirk.  
On the Morning of the 24th I was again off Carrickfergus; and would have gone in had I not seen the Drake preparing to come out. It was very moderate and the Drakes boat was sent out to reconnoitre the Ranger—as the Boat advanced I kep’t the Ships stern directly towards her and tho’ they had a Spy Glass in the Boat, they came on within Hail, and alongside. When the Officer came on the Quarter deck he was greatly surprised to find himself a Prisoner! altho’ an Express had arrived from Whitehaven theNight before. I now understood, what I had before imagined, that the Drake came out in consequence of this Information, with Volunteers against the Ranger. The Officer told me also that they had taken up the Rangers Anchor. The Drake was attended by Five small Vessels full of People; who were led by motives of curiosity to see an Engagement. But when they discovered the Drakes boat at the Ranger’s stern they wisely put back. Alarm smokes now appeared in great abundance extending along both sides of the Channel. The Tide was unfavorable so that the Drake worked out but slowly; this obliged me to run down several times and to lay with Courses up and Main Top-Sail to the Mast. At length the Drake weathered the Point; and having led her out to about mid-channell, I Suffered her to come within hail: the Drake hoisted English Colours and at the same instant the American Stars were displayed on board the Ranger. I expected that Preface had been now at an end; but the Enemy soon after hailed, demanding what Ship it was? I directed the Master to answer the American Continental Ship Ranger—that we waited for them and desired they would come on. The Sun was now little more than an Hour from setting, it was therefore time to begin. The Drake being astern of the Ranger I ordered the Helm up and gave her the first broadside, the Action was warm, close, and obstinate; it lasted an Hour and five minutes when the Enemy called for Quarters—her Fore and Main Topsail yards being both cut away and down on the Cap. The Fore top Gallant yard and Mizen Gaff both hanging up and down along the Mast. The 2d Ensign which they had hoisted shot away and hanging over the Quarter Gallery in the Water. The Jib shot away and hanging into the Water—her Sails and Rigging entirely cut to peices. Her Masts and Yards all wounded and her Hull also very much Galled.  
I lost only Lieutenant Wallingsford and one Seaman (John Dougal) killed, and Six Wounded; among whom are the Gunner (Mr. Falls) and Mr. Powers a Midshipman, who lost his Arm. One of the wounded (Nathaniel Wills) is since dead—the rest will recover.  
The loss of the Enemy in killed and Wounded was far greater. All the Prisoners allow that they came out with a number not less than an Hundred and Sixty Men; and many of them Affirm that they amounted to an Hundred and Ninety. The Medium may perhaps be the most exact Account, and by that it will appear that they lost in Killed and Wounded 42 Men.  
The Captain and Lieutenant were among the Wounded—the former, having received a Musquet Ball in the Head the Minute before they called for Quarters, lived and was sensible for some time after my People boarded the Prize. The Lieutenant survived two days. They were Buryed with the Honors due to their Rank and with the Respect due to their Memory.  
The Night and almost the whole day after the Action being moderate greatly faciliated the refitting of both Ships. A large Brigantine ran so near the Drake in the Afternoon that I was Obliged to bring her too, she belonged to Whitehaven and was bound for Norway. I had thoughts of returning by the South Channel but the Wind shifting I determined to pass by the North and round the West Coast of Ireland. This brought me once more off Belfast Lough on the Evening of the day after the Engagement.  
It was now time to release the honest Fishermen whom I took up here on the 21st. And as the poor fellows had lost their Boat, she having sunk in the late stormy Weather, I was happy in having it in my Power to give them the necessary Sum to purchase every thing new which they had lost. I gave them also a good Boat to transport themselves ashore and sent with them Two infirm Men on whom I bestowed the last Guinea in my Possession to defray their travelling Expences to their proper home at Dublin. They took with them One of the Drakes Sails which would sufficiently explain what had happened to the Volunteers. The grateful Fishermen were in Raptures and expressed their Joy in three Huzzas as they passed the Rangers Quarter.  
I again met with contrary Winds in the Mouth of the North Channel but nothing remarkable happened till on the Morning of the 5th Current. Ushant then bearing SEBE distance 15 Leagues, when seeing a Sail to leeward steering for the Channel, the Wind being favorable for Brest and the distance triffling I resolved to give chace. Having the Drake in Tow, I informed them of my intention and Ordered them to cast off. They cut the Hawser. The Ranger in the Chace went lasking between the NNE and NNW.—it lasted an Hour and Ten minutes, when the chace was hailed and proved a Swede. I immediately hauled by the Wind to the Southward. After cutting the Hawser the Drake went from the Wind for some time, then hawled close by the Wind steering from SSE to SSW as the Wind permitted; so that when the Ranger spoke the Chace the Drake was scarce perceptable. In the course of the day many large Ships appeared steering into the Channel, but the extraordinary Evolutions of the Drake made it impossible for me to avail myself of these favorable circumstances. Towards Noon it became very Squally and the Wind backed from the SW to the West. The Ranger had come up with the Drake and was nearly abrest of her, tho’ considerably, to leeward when the Wind shifted. The Drake was however kept by the Wind; tho’ as I afterward understood, they knew the Ranger and saw the Signal which she had hoisted. After various Evolutions and Signals in the Night, I gave chase to a sail which appeared bearing SSW the next Morning at a great distance. The chase discovered no intention to speak with the Ranger; she was however at length brought too and proved to be the Drake. I immediately put Lieutenant Simpson under Suspension and Arrest for disobedience of my Orders dated the 26th Ultimo Copy whereof is here inclosed. On the 8th both Ships Anchored safe in this Road, the Ranger having been Absent only 28 days. Could I suppose that my letters of 9th and 16th Current (the first advising you of my Arrival and giving reference to the Events of my Expidition—the last advising you of my Draft in favor of Monsr. Bersole for Twenty four thousand Livers and as­signing reasons for that demand) had not made due appearance I would hereafter as I do now inclose Copies. Three posts have already arrived here from Paris since Comte D’Orvilliers shewed me the Answer which he received from the Minister to the letter which inclosed mine to you—yet you remain Silent. Monsr. Bersole has this moment informed me of the Fate of my Bill the more extraordinary as I have not yet made use of your Letter of 10th Jany. last whereby I then seemd entitled to call for half the Amount of my late draft, and I did not expect to be thought extravagant when on the 16th I doubled that demand. Could this indignity be kept secret I should disregard it. But tho’ it is already public in Brest and in the Fleet as it affects only my private Credit I will not complain. I cannot however be silent when I find the Public Credit under the same disgrace. I conceive that this might have been prevented. To make me completely wretched Mr. Bersole has told me that he now stops his hand not only of the necessary Articles to refit the Ship but also of the daily Provision. I know not where to find tomorrows dinner for the great number of Mouths which depend on me for Food. Are then the Continental Ships of War to depend on the Sale of their Prizes for a daily Dinner for their Men? “Publish it not in Gath.” My Officers as well as Men want Cloathes to cover their Nakedness and the Prizes are precluded from being sold before further Orders arrive from the Minister. I will ask you Gentlemen if I have deserved all this? Whoever calls himself an American Agent ought to be present here.  
I am unwilling to think that you have intentionally involved me in this sad delema at a time when I ought to expect some enjoyment, therefore I have as formerly the honor to be with due Esteem and Respect Gentlemen Your

Ranger, Bri {t, My 27th. 1778.  
GEenTLeMeN,  
  
I HAVE now to fulfill the promife made in  
my laft by giving you an account of my late expedition  
  
I failed from Breft the toth April, my plan was  
extenfive ; 1 therefore did not at the beginning with to  
encumber myfelf with prifoners. On thé 14th 1 took  
a Brigantine between Scilly and Cape Clear, bound  
from Oftend with a cargo of Flaxfe:d for ireland, funk  
her and proceeded into St. George’schannel. On the  
17th, | took the fhip lord Chatham bound from Lon-  
don for Dublin with a cargo confilting of porter and a  
variety of merchandize, and almoft within fight of her  
port. This fhp I manned and ordered for Brett.  
Towards the evening of the day following the weather  
had a proniifing appearance, and the wind being favorable  
] ftood over from the Ifle of Man with an intention to  
make adefcent at Whitehaven. At ten o’clock I was off  
the harbour with a party ef volunteers, and ha! every  
th&#x27;pe in readinefs to land ; but b fore «leven the wind  
greatly increafed and fhifted fo as toblow direétly upon the  
ihore ; the fea incteafed of courfe and it became impofhible.  
to effect a landing; this obliged me to carry all poflible  
fail fo as to clear the land and to await a more favorable  
opportenity. On the 18th in Glinluce bay on the fouth  
coaft of Scotland I met with a revenue wherry; 4  
being the common pt étice of thefe veffels, to board  
merchants fhips; the Ranger having then no external  
appearance of war, it was expected that this Rover  
would have come along fide. | was however miftaken  
for though the men were at their quarters, yet this vef-  
fell out fail’d the Ranger and got clear in {pite of a fe-  
vere cannonade. Z  
The next morning, off the mall of Galloway, I  
found myfelf fo near a Scotch coafting fchooner,  
joaded with barley, that | could not avoid finking  
her. Underftanding that there were ‘en or twelve  
fril of merchant fhips, befides a tender brigantine  
with a number of impreffed men on board, at an  
cnor in Loughryan, in Scotland, I thought this an  
enterprize worth my attention—but the wind, which  
at firft would have ferved equally well to fail in or  
out of the Lough, thifted in a hard {quall, fo as to blow  
almoft dire&amp;tly in, with an appearance of bad wea-  
ther; [ was, therefore, obliged to abandon my pro-  
ject  
  
Seeing a cutter off the lee bow fteering for the  
Civde, I gave chace in hopes of cutting her off;  
but finding my endeavours ineffectual, I purfued no  
turcher than the Rock of Elza. In the evening I fel!  
in witha floop from Dablin, which T funk, to pre-  
vent intelligence.  
  
The next day, the 21ft, being near Carrickfergus a  
fithing boat came off which I detained. I fawa fthip  
at anchor in the road which | was informed by the  
Fifhermen was the Britifh thip of war Drake, of 20  
Guns. |  
  
I determined to attack her in the night ; my plan was  
to overlay her cable and fall upon her bow, fo as to  
have all her decks open and expofed to our mufquetry,  
&amp;c. at the fame time it was my intention to ave fecur-  
ed the enemy by graplings. fo that had they cut their  
cables they would not thereby have att:ined an advan-  
tage. The wind was high and unfortunately the an-  
chor was not let go fo foon asthe order was given ; fo  
that the Ranger was brought up on the enemy’s quar-  
ter at the diftance of haifa cable’s length. We made no  
warlike appearance, of courfe had given no alarm 5. this  
determined me to cat immediately, which might app-ar  
as ifthe cable had parted ; and at the fame time enable  
me after making a tack out of the length, to return  
with the fame profpe&amp; of advantage which I h‘d at  
the firft. I was however prevented from returning ;  
as I with difficulty weather d the light houfe on the fea  
fide of the Lough, and as the pile increafed .  
  
&quot;The weather now became fo very ftormy and fevere  
and the fea fo high, that | was obliged to take thelter  
under the fouth fhore of Scotland.  
  
The 22d introduced fair weather, tho:gh the three  
kingdoms as far as the eye could reach were covered.  
with fnow. I now refolved once more to attempt  
Whitehaven, but the wind became vid fo that  
the fhip could not in pr time, approach fo near ‘as  
‘Thad Fiennes. At P idoight I left the fhip with two  
  
acid ee eS rar rs SP Er ee eee? Pre a  
  
beats and 31 volu teers, when we reached the outer} Eaglificolours.an! at the fume infant the American  
  
pier. the day began to dawn. { would not however aban-  
don my enterprize. but difpatched one boat under the  
direétion of Mec. Hill and Lieatenant Wallingsford  
with the neceflary combuftibles to fet fre to the fhipping  
on the north fide of the harbour while I went with the  
other party to attempt the fouth fide. I was fuceefsful  
in fealing the walls and {pikiog up all the cannon on the  
the firlt fort, inding the centinels fhut up in the euard  
houfe. they were fecured without being huet; baving  
fixed centinels, I now took with me one man only  
(Mr.Green) and fyiked up al! the cannon on the fouth-  
ern fort, diftant fromthe dther a quarter of a mile.  
  
On my retarn from this befiaefs, ! naturally expect  
ed to fee the fre of the fhips on the north fide, as well  
as to find my o-vn party with every thing ‘n readieefs to  
fet Sre to the thipping on the fouth; inftead of this, I  
found the boat under the direction of Mr. Hill and Mr.  
Wallingsford returned, and the party in fome confution,  
their ight having burnt out at the initant when it became  
neceffary  
  
By the ftrangeft fatality my own party were in: the  
fame fituation, the candles being all burnt out. ‘The:  
day too came on apace ; yet I would by no means te-  
treat while any hopes of fuccels remained. Having again  
placed centinels a hight was obtained at a houfe disjoined  
from the town ; and fire was kindled in the Reerage of  
a large fhip, which was furrounded by at leaft an hun-  
dred and fifty others, chiefly from two to four hundred  
tons burthen, and laying fide by fide, and being un-  
furrounded by the water.  
  
‘There was befides from feventy to an hundred large  
{hips in the north arm of the harbour, aground clear  
of the water divided from the reft only by a {tone, pier  
ofa fhips height. 1 fhould have kindled fires in other  
places ifthe time had permitted, as it did not, our care  
was to prevent tl:2 one kindled from being eafily extin-  
guithed ; after fome feaich a barrel of tar was found  
and popred into the flames. which now appeared trom |  
allthe hatchways. ‘Ihe inhabitants began to appear in  
thonfands and individuals ran haftly towards as. |  
ftood between th mand the thip on fire witha pittol in  
my hand, and ordered them to retreat, which they did  
with precipitation. ‘The flames had already caught  
the rigging and began around the mainmatt,—-: he’  
fun was a full hour’s march above the horizop and as  
fleep no longer ruled the world, it was time to retire ;  
we :e-embarked without oppofition ; having releafed a  
number of prifoners, as our boats could not carry them.  
After all my people had embarkcd, | ftood upon the  
pier a confiderable {pace, yet no petfon advanced ; I faw  
all the eminences aronnd the town covered with the  
amazed inhabitants.  
  
When we had rowed to a confiderable diftance from  
the fhore the Englifh began to run in vait numbers ‘to  
their forts, their difappointment may eafily be imagined,  
when they found i fuppofe at leaft thirty heavy cannon  
(the inttruments of their vengeance) rendered ufelefs.—  
Atlength, however, they began to fire, having, as | ap-  
prehend, either brought down fhips guns, or ufed one or  
two cannon which lay on the beach at the foot of the  
wails difmounted, and which had not been fpiked, They  
fred with no direétion, and the fhot falling thort of the  
boats, inltead of doing us any damage, afforded fome  
diverfion, which my people could not help fhewing, by  
difcharging their piftols, &amp;c. in return of the falute.—  
Had it been pofhible to have landed a few hours fooner,  
my fuccefs would have been complete ; not a fingle thip  
out of more than two hundred could poflibly nave efcap-  
ed, and all the world would not have been able to fave  
the town. What was done, however, is fufficient to  
thew, that not all their boafted navy can proteét their  
own coaits ; and that the fcenes of diftrefs which they  
have occafioned in America, may foon be brought home  
to their own doors. One of my people was mifling, and  
i fear, has fallen into the enemies hands after our de-  
parture. i was pleafed that in this bufinefs we neither  
vad any killed or wounded. Jf brought oif three pri-  
foners as a fample.  
  
We now tloud over fir the Scorch fhore, and |  
landed at noon on St. Mary’s Ifle, with one boat on-  
ly and a very fmall party. . ‘Tae motives which in-  
duced me to land there are explained in. the within  
copy of a letter, which IL have written to the coun:  
tefs of Selkirk. [See our lat ] .  
  
On the morning of the 24th i was again off Car-  
‘rickfergus, and would have gone in bad I not feep  
the Drake preparing to come out: it was very mo-  
derate, and the Drake’s boat was fent out to recon-  
noitre the Ringer. As the boat advanced, | kept  
sthe fhip’s ftern direétly towerds her; and though  
they had a fpy glafs imthe boat, they came on with-  
in hail, and along fide. When the officer came on  
the quarter deck, he was’ greatly furprized to find  
himfelf a prifoner—although an expre/s had arrived  
from Whitehaven the night before. 1 now underttood  
what I hac before imagined, that the Drake came  
outin confeqauence of this infar;mation with yolun-  
teers.ag init the Ranger. The officer told me, aifo,  
that they bad taken up the Ranger’s anchog.  
  
‘he Dr.ke was attended by five fmall veffels Full  
of people, who were ded by motives of curiofity to  
fe an engagement; but when they difcdvered the  
Drike’s boat at the Ranger’s flern, they wifely put  
back. Alarny fmokes now appeared in great abun-  
dance, extending along both fiJes of the channel.  
The tide was unfavourable, {9 that the Drake work  
ec? out but flowly; this ob iged me to ran down te.  
Veval times, ard to lay with courfés ap and main top  
fail tothe maft. Atlength the Drake weathered the  
po nt; and having led her out to about mid channel I  
  
  
  
Stars had veen difplayed ea board rhe Ranger, [  
expected that preface had beenmow at an end ; but the  
enemy foon after hailed, demanding, what {his it was?  
I directed the matter to anfwer, the American conti.  
neatal fhip Ranger, that we waited for them, and de-  
fired they would come on. ‘Phe fun was now little more  
than an hour from fetting, it was therefore time to begin.  
The Drake being. aftern of the Ranger | ordered the  
helm up, and gave them the firft broad fide; the a@ion  
was warm, clofe and ob:tinate; it lafted an hour and five  
minutes when the enenry called for qhart rs; her fore  
and main top fail yards being both cut way and down  
onthe cap, Ihe top gallant yard and mizen gaff both  
hanging up and down along the mait, the 2d enfign  
which they had hoiiled thot away and hanging over  
the quarter gallery in the water, the Jibb thot away  
  
and hanging into the water, her fails and rigging entire-  
ly cut to pieces, her matts and yards all wounded and &#x27;

The lofs of the enemy in killed and wounded was

Brest, May 27th, 1778.  
  
Gentlemen—I have now to fulfil the promise made in my  
last, by giving you an account of my late expedition.  
  
I sailed from Brest the 10th of April. My plan was exten-  
sive. I therefore did not, at the beginning, wish to encum-  
ber myself with prisoners. On the 14th I took a brigantine, 3  
between Scylly and Cape Clear, bound from Ostend with a f  
cargo of flaxseed for Ireland, sunk her, and proceeded into St.  
George’ sChannel. On the 17th | took the ship Lord Chatham,  
bound from London for Dublin, with a cargo consisting of  
porter and a variety of merchandize, and almost within sight  
of her port: the ship I manned and ordered for Brest. To-  
wards the evening of the day following, the weather had a pro- a  
mising appearance, and the winds being favourable, | stood  
over from the Isle of Man, with an intention to make a de

scent at Whitehaven. At 10 o’clock, I was off the harbour  
with a party of volunteers, and had every thing in readiness to  
laud ; but, before eleven, the wind greatiy increased and shift-  
ed so as to blow directly upon the shore :—the sea increased  
of course, and it became impossible to effect a landing. This  
obliged me to carry all possible sail, so as to clear the land and  
to await a more favourable opportunity. On the 18th, in  
Glenbue bay, on the south coast of Scotland, | met with a re-  
venue wherry ;—it being the common practice of these ves-  
sels to board merchant ships, and the Ranger then having no  
external appearance of war, it was expected that this rover  
would have come alongside. I was, however, mistaken, for,  
though the men were at their quarters yet, this vessel outsail-  
ed the Ranger, and got clear, in spite of a severe cannonade.  
  
The next morning, off the Mull of Galloway, I found my-  
self so near a Scotch coasting schooner, loaded with barley,  
that | could not avoid sinking her. Understanding that there  
were ten or twelve sail of merchant ships besides a tender bri-  
gantine, with a number of impressed men on board, at anchor  
in Loughryan in Scotland, | thought this an enterprise worth  
my attention; but the wind, which at the first would have  
served equally well to sail in or out of the lough, shifted in a  
hard squall so as to blow almost directly in, with an appear-  
ance of bad weather; | was, therefore, obliged to abandon my  
project.  
  
Seeing a cutter off the lee-bow steering for the Clyde, I  
gave chase in hopes of cutting her off; but, finding my endea-  
vours inetiectual, | pursued no farther than the rock of Elza.  
In the evening fell in with a sloop from Dublin, which |  
sunk to prev ent intelligence.  
  
The next day, the 21st, being near Carrickfergus, a fishing  
boat came off, which | detained. I sawa ship at anchor in  
the road which, | was informed by the fishermen, was the Bri-  
tish ship of war Drake of 20 guns.  
  
I determined to attack her in the mght. My plan was to  
overlay her cable, and to fall upon her bow, so as to have all  
her decks open and exposed to our musketry, &amp;c. ; at the same  
time it was my intention to have secured the enemy by grap-  
plings, so that, had they cut their cables, they would not there-  
by have attained an advantage. ‘The wind was high, and, un-  
fortunately, the anchor was not let go so soon as the order was  
given; so that the Ranger was brought up on the enemy’s  
quarter at the distance of half a cable’s length. We had made  
no warlike appearance ;—of course had given no alarm: this  
  
determined me to cut immediately, which might appear as if

the cable had parted, and, at the same time, enable me, after  
making a tack out of the length, to return with the same pros-  
pect of advintade. which I had at the first. I was, however, pre-  
vented from returning ; as I with difficulty weathered the light-  
house on the lee side of the lough, and as the gale increased.  
  
The weather now became so very stormy and severe, and  
the sea so high, that I was obliged to take shelter under the  
south shore of Scotland. The 22d introduced fair weather ;  
though the three kingdoms, as far as the eye could reach, were  
covered with snow. | now resolved, once more to attempt  
Whitehaven ; but the wind became very light, so that the ship  
could net, in proper time, approach so near as | had intended.  
At midnight I left the ship, with two boats and thirty-one vo-  
lunteers. When we reached the outer pier, the day began to  
dawn. | would not, however, abandon my enterprise ; but des-  
patched one boat, under the direction of Mr. Hill and lieute-  
nant Wallingsford, with the necessary combustibles, to set fire  
to the shipping on the north side of the harbour; while I went  
with the other party, to attempt the south side. 1 was success-  
fal in scaling the walls, and spiking up all the cannon on the  
first fort. Finding the sentinels shut up in the guard house,  
they were secured without being hurt. Having fixed sentinels,  
1 now took with me one man only, (Mr. Green) and spiked up  
all the cannon on the southern fort, distant from the other a  
quarter of a mile.  
  
On my return from this business, I naturally expected to see  
the fire of the ships on the north side,—as well as to find my  
own party with every thing in readiness to set fire to the ship-  
ping in the south. Instead of this, | found the boat under the  
direction of Mr. Hill and Mr. Wallingsford returned, and the  
party in some confusion ; their light having burnt out at the in-  
stant when it became necessary.  
  
By the strangest fatality, my own party were in the same  
situation, the candles being all burnt out. The day too came  
on apace; yet 1 would by no means retreat, while any hopes  
of success remained. Having again placed sentinels, a light was  
obtained at a house disjoined from the town ; and fire was kin-  
died in the steerage of a large ship, which was surrounded by  
at least an hundred and fifty others, chiefly from two to four  
hundred tons burthen, and laying side‘by side, aground, unsur-  
rounded by the water.  
  
There were, besides, from seventy to an hundred large ships,  
in the north arm of the harbour, aground, clear of the water,  
and divided from the rest only by a stone pier of a ship’s height.

mitted. As it did not, our care was to prevent the one kindled  
from being easily extinguished. After some search, a barrel  
of tar was found, and poured into the flames, which now as-  
cended from all the hatchways. ‘The inhabitants began to ap-  
pear in thousands ; and individuals ran hastily towards us. I  
stood between them and the ship on fire, with a pistel in my  
hand, and ordered them to retire, which they did with precipi-  
tation. The flames had already caught the rigging, and began  
to ascend the mainmast ; the sun was a full hour’s march above  
the horizon; and as sleep no longer ruled the world, it was  
time to retire. We re-embarked without opposition ; having  
released a number of prisoners, as our boats could not carry  
them. After all my people had embarked, I stood upon the  
pier fora considerable time; yet no persons advanced. I saw all  
the eminences around the town covered with the amazed in-  
habitants.  
  
When we had rowed toa considerable distance from the  
shore, the English began to run, in vast numbers, to their  
- forts. &quot;Pheif disappointment may easily be imagined, when  
_ they found at least thirty heavy cannon, (the instruments of  
their vengeance,) rendered useless. At length, however, the  
began to fire; having, as I apprehend, either brought down ship  
guns, or used one or two cannon, which lay on the beach, at  
the foot of the walls, dismounted; and which had not been  
gta They fired with no direction; and the shot falling  
short of the boats, instead of doing us any damage, afforded  
some diversion ; which my people could not help showing, by  
discharging their pistols, &amp;c. in return of the salute. Had it  
been possible to have landed a few hours sooner, my success  
would have been complete. Not a single ship, out of more  
than two hundred, could possibly have escaped, and all the  
world would not have been able to save the town. What was  
done, however, is suflicient to show, that not all their boasted  
navy can protect their own coasts ; and that the scenes of dis-  
tress, which they have occasioned in America, may soon be  
brought home to their own door. One of my people was  
missing; and must, | fear, have fallen into the enemy’s hands  
after our departure. Iwas pleased that in this business we  
neither killed nor wounded. 1 brought off three prisoners as  
a sample. .  
  
We now stood over for the Scotch shore; and I landed at  
noon on the St. Mary’s isle, with one boat only, and a very  
small party. The motives which induced me to land there,

are explained in the written copy of a letter, which I have ad-  
dressed to the Countess of Selkirk.*  
  
On the morning of the 24th | was again off Carrickfergus,  
and would have gone in, had I not seen the Drake preparing  
to come out. It was very moderate ; and the Drake’s boat  
was sent out to reconnoitre the Ranger. As the boat advan-  
ced, I kept the ship’s stern directly towards her; and though  
they had a spy glass in the boat, they came on within hail, and  
alongside. When the oflicer came on the quarter deck, he  
was greatly surprised to find himself a prisoner; although an  
express had arrived from Whitehaven the night before. I now  
understood, what | had before imagined, that the Drake came  
out in consequence of this information, with volunteers, against  
the Ranger. The officer told me also, that they had taken up  
the Ranger’s anchor.  
  
The Drake was attended by five small vessels full of peo-  
ple, who were led by curiosity to see an engagement. But  
when they discovered the Drake’s boat at the Ranger’s stern  
they wisely put back.  
  
Alarm smokes now appeared in great abundance extending  
along both sides of the channel. ‘The tide was unfavourable,  
so that the Drake worked out but slowly. This obliged me to  
run down several times, and to lay with courses up, and main  
top-sail to the mast. At length the Drake weathered the  
point ; and having led her out to about mid-channel, I suffered  
her to come within hail. ‘The Drake hoisted English colours,  
and at the same instant the American stars were displayed on  
board the Ranger. I expected that preface had been now at  
an end; but the enemy soon after hailed, demanding what ship  
it was! ? I directed the master to answer, “ The American Con-  
tinental ship Ranger ;”’ that we waited for them, and desired  
that they would come on. The sun was now little more than  
an hour from setting. It was therefore time to begin. The  
Drake being astern of the Ranger, I ordered the heim up, and  
gave her the first broadside. ‘The action was warm, close and  
obstinate. It lasted an hour and five minutes ; when the ene-  
my called for quarters; her fore and main top- -sail yards be-  
ing both cut away, and down on the cap; the top-gallant yard  
and mizen-gaffe, both hanging up and down, along the mast ;—  
the second ensign which they had hoisted, shot away, and  
hanging on the quarter gallery in the water ;—the jib shot  
away, and hanging into the water; her sails and rigging en

tirely cut to pieces; her masts and yards all wounded, and  
her hull also very much galled. |  
  
I lost only lieutenant Wallingsford, and one seaman (John  
Dougall) killed, and six wounded ; among whom are the gun-  
ner, (Mr. Falls,) and Mr. Powers, a midshipman, who lost his  
arm. One of the wounded, (Nathaniel Wills,) is since dead.  
The rest will recover.  
  
The loss of the enemy, in killed and wounded, was far great-  
er. All the prisoners allow, that they came out with a num-  
ber not less than an hundred and sixty men : and many of them  
affirm that they amounted to an hundred and ninety. The me-  
dium may, perhaps, be the most exact account; and by that it  
will appear that they lost, in killed and wounded, forty-two  
men. ‘The captain and lieutenant were among the wounded.  
The former, having received a musket ball in the head, the  
minute before they called for quarters, lived and was sensible  
some time after my people boarded the prize. The lieutenant  
survived two days. ‘They were buried with the honours due  
to their rank, and with the respect due to their memory.  
  
The night and almost the whole day after the action being  
moderate, greatly facilitated the refitting of both ships. A large  
brigantine was so near the Drake in the afternoon, that I was  
obliged to bring her to. She belonged to Whitehaven, and  
was bound for Norway.  
  
I had thought of returning by the south channel; but the  
wind shifting, I determined to pass by the north, and round the  
west coast of Ireland. ‘This brought me once more off Belfast  
Lough, on the evening after the engagement. It was now time  
to release the honest fishermen, whom | took up here on the  
2ist. And as the poor fellows had lost their boat, she having  
sunk in the late stormy weather, I was happy in having it in

for the channel, the wind being favourable for Brest, and the  
distance trifling, I resolved to give chase, having the Drake in  
tow. I informed them of my intentions; and ordered them to  
cast off. They cut the hawser. The Ranger in the chase went  
lasking between the N. N. E. and N. N. W. It lasted an hour  
and ten minutes ; when the chase was hailed, and proved a  
Swede. I immediately hauled by the wind to the southward.  
After cutting the hawser, the Drake went from the wind for  
some time ; then hauled close by the wind, steering from S. S.  
E. to S. S. W. as the wind permitted: so that when the Ran-  
ger spoke the chase, the Drake was scarcely perceptible. In  
the course of the day, many large ships appeared, steering into  
the channel; but the extraordinary evolutions of the Drake  
made it impossible for me to avail myself of these favourable  
circumstances. ‘Towards noon it became very squally, the  
wind backed from the S. W. tothe W. The Ranger had come  
up with the Drake, and was nearly abreast of her, though con-  
siderably to the leeward, when the wind shifted. ‘The Drake  
was however kept by the wind; though, as | afterwards under-  
stood, they knewthe Ranger, and saw the signal which she had  
hoisted. After various evolutions and signals in the night, I  
gave chase toa sail, which appeared bearing S. S. W. the next  
morning, at a great distance. The chase discovered no inten-  
tion to speak with the Ranger ; she was, however, at length  
brought to, and proved to be the Drake. I immediately put  
lieutenant Simpson under suspension and arrest, for disobedi-  
ence of my orders, dated the 26th ult., copy whereof is here  
inclosed. On the 8th both ships anchored safe in this road,  
the Ranger having been absent only twenty-eight days.  
  
Could | suppose that my letters of the 9th and 16th cur-  
rent, (the first advising you of my arrival, and giving reference  
to the events of my expedition,—the last advising you of my

livres, and assigning reasons for that demand,) had not made  
due appearance, | would hereafter, asI do now, enclose copies.  
Three posts have already arrived here from Paris, since Comte  
@Orvilliers showed me the answer which he received from  
the minister, to the letter which inclosed mine to you. Yet  
you remain silent. Mr. Bersolle has this moment informed  
me of the fate of my bills; the more extraordinary, as | have  
not yet made use of your letter of credit of the tenth of Janu-

fects only my private credit, I will not complain. I cannot,  
however, be silent when I find the public creditinvolved in the  
same disgrace. I conceive this might have been preveated.  
To make me completely wretched, Mons. Bersolle has told  
me that he now stops his hand ; not only of the necessary ar-  
ticles to refit the ship; but also of the daily provisions. I  
know not where to find tomorrow’s dinner for the great num-

continental ships of war to depend on the sale of their prizes,  
for a daily dinner for their men? “ Publish it not in Gath.”  
  
My officers as well as men want clothes ; and the prizes are  
precluded from being sold, before farther orders arrive from  
the minister. I will ask you, gentlemen, if I have deserved

ture of the Drake sloop of war of twenty guns by the Ranger,  
off Carrickfergus, on the 24th of May, 1778.  
  
Alarm smokes now appeared in great abundance, extending along on  
both sides of the channel. The tide was unfavourable, so that the Drake  
worked out but slowly. This obliged me to run down several times,  
and to lay with courses up, and main-topsail to the mast. At length

the Drake weathered the point, and having led her out to about mid-  
channel, I suffered her to come within hail. The Drake hoisted English  
colours, and at the same instant, the American stars were displayed on  
board the Ranger. I expected that preface had been now at an end,  
but the enemy soon after hailed, demanding what shipit was? I direct-  
ed the master to answer, “ the American Continental ship Ranger; that  
we waited for them, and desired that they would come on; the sun was  
now little more than an hour from setting, it was therefore time to be-  
gin.’ The Drake being astern of the Ranger, I ordered the helm up,  
and gave her the first broadside. The action was warm, close, and ob-  
stinate. It lasted an hour and four minutes, when the enemy called for  
quarters; her fore and main-topsail yards being both cut away, and  
down on the cap; the top-gallant yard and mizen-gatff both hanging up  
and down along the mast; the second ensign which they had hoisted  
shot away, and hanging on the quarter gallery in the water; the jib  
shot away, and hanging in the water; her sails and rigging entirely  
cut to pieces; her masts and yards all wounded, and her hull also very  
much galled. I lost only Lieut. Wallingsford and one seaman, John  
Dougall, killed, and six wounded; among whom are the gunner, Mr  
Falls, and Mr Powers, a midshipman, who lost his arm. One of the  
wounded, Nathaniel Wills, is since dead; the rest will recover. The loss  
of the enemy in killed and wounded, was far greater. All the prisoners  
allow, that they came out with a number not less than a hundred and  
sixty men; and many of them affirm that they amounted to a hundred  
and ninety. The medium may, perhaps, be the most exact account; and  
by that it will appear that they lost in killed and wounded, forty-two  
men. The captain and lieutenant were among the wounded. The for-  
mer, having received a musket ball in the head the minute before they  
called for quarters, lived, and was sensible sometime after my pcople  
boarded the prize. The lieutenant survived two days. They were  
  
buried with the honours due to their rank, and with the respect due  
to their memory.

proaching the shore as nearly as Jones could wish, he left the  
ship with two boats and thirty-one men, who volunteered to  
accompany him ; and, without disturbing a single sentinel, he  
succeeded in spiking up all the cannon on the first and the  
southern forts, which were a quarter of a mile distant from  
each other. In the mean time, he had dispatched his lieute-  
nant, Wallingford, with a party to set fire to the shipping on  
the north side of the harbour ; and on his return to the Ranger,  
he looked out anxiously for the expected blaze: it did not  
appear: Jones hastened to the spot; and he found the party  
in confusion, their light having burnt out at the moment  
when they were about to apply it. His own division, which  
he intended should burn the vessels on the southern side of  
the harbour, were in a similar predicament, — their candles  
had also been extinct.  
  
‘ The day was breaking apace, and the failure of the expedition  
seemed complete. Any other commander but Jones would, in  
this predicament, have thought himself fortunate in making his  
retreat good; but Jones would not retreat. He had the boldness  
to send a man to a house detached from the town to ask fora light ;  
the request was successful, and fire was kindled in the steerage of  
a large ship, which was surrounded by at least one hundred and  
fifty others, chiefly from two to four hundred tons burthen. There  
was not time to fire any more than one place, and Jones’s care

says Jones in his letter to the American commissioners, “ began  
to appear in thousands, and individuals ran hastily towards us; I  
stood between them and the ship on fire, with a pistol in my hand,  
and ordered them to retire, which they did with precipitation.  
The flames had already caught the rigging, and began to ascend  
the mainmast; the sun was a full hour’s march above the horizon,  
and as sleep no longer ruled the world, it was time to retire; we  
reimbarked without opposition. After all my people had embarked,  
I stood upon the pier for a considerable time, yet no persons  
advanced ; I saw all the eminences around the town covered with  
the enraged inhabitants.  
  
‘« When we had rowed to a considerable distance from the  
shore, the English began to run in vast numbers to their forts.  
Their disappointment may be easily imagined, when they found  
at least thirty cannon, the instruments of their vengeance, ren-  
dered useless. At length, however, they began to fire; having,  
as I apprehend, either brought down ship-guns, or used one or  
two cannon which lay on the beach at the foot of the walls,  
dismantled, and which had not been spiked. They fired with no  
direction ; and the shot falling short of the boats, instead of doing  
any damage, afforded us seme diversion, which my people could  
not help shewing by firing their pistols, &amp;c. in return of the salute.  
Had it been possible to have landed a few hours sooner, my suc-  
cess would have been complete ; not a single ship out of more than  
  
200 could possibly have escaped, and all the world would not have  
been able to have saved the town.”

not to abandon the enterprise, but, despatching  
one boat with Lieutenant Wallingford with the  
necessary combustibles to the north side of the  
harbour, he proceeded with the other party to  
the southern side. There was a dead silence  
when Jones, at the head of his party, scaled the  
walls. He succeeded in spiking all the cannon  
of the first fort ; and the sentinels, being shut up  
in the guard-house, were fairly surprised. Having  
succeeded thus far, Jones, with only one man,  
spiked up all the cannon on the southern fort,  
distant from the other a quarter of a mile.  
“These daring exploits being all performed  
without disturbing asingle being, Jones anxiously  
looked for the expected blaze on the north side  
of the harbour, His anxiety was further in-  
creased, as all the combustibles had been entrusted  
to the northern party, they, after performing their  
task, having to join him to fire the shipping on the  
south side. ‘The anxiously expected blaze did  
not, however, appear ; Jones hastened to Lieute-  
nant Wallingford, and found the whole party in  
confusion, their light having burnt out at the in-  
stant when it became necessary. By a sad fatality  
his own division were in the same plight, for, in  
hurrying to the southern party, their candles had  
also burnt out. The day was breaking apace, aa

abandon the enterprise, but, despatching one boat with Lieutenant  
Wallingford with the necessary combustibles to the north side of  
the harbour, he proceeded with the other party to the southern’  
side. There was a dead silence when Jones, at the head of his  
party, scaled the walls. He succeeded in spiking all the cannon  
of the first fort; and the sentinels, being shut up in the guard-  
house, were fairly surprised. Having succeeded thus far, Sones,  
with only one man, spiked up all the cannon on the southern fort,  
distant from the other a quarter of a mile.  
  
‘* These daring exploits being all performed without disturbing  
a single being, Jones anxiously looked for the expected blaze on  
the north side of the harbour. His anxiety further increased, as  
all the combustibles had been entrusted to the northern party,  
they, after performing their task, having to join him to fire the  
shipping on the south side. The anxiously expected blaze did not,  
however, appear; Joues hastened to Lieutenant Wallingford, and  
found the whole party in confusion, their light having burned out  
at the instant when it became necessary. By a sad fatality his  
own division were in the same plight, for, in hurrying to the  
southern party, their candles had also burnt out. The day was  
breaking apace, and the failure of the expedition seemed. complete.  
Any other commander but Jones would, in this predicament, have  
thought himself fortunate in making his retreat good ; but Jones  
would not retreat. He had the boldness to send:a man to a house  
detached from the town to ask for a light ; the request was suc-  
cessful, and fire was kindled in the steerage of a large ship, which  
was surrounded by at least 150 others, chiefly from 200 to 400  
tons burden. There was not time to fire any more than one  
place, and Jones’s care was to prevent that one from being easily  
extinguished. After some search, a barrel of tar was found,  
and. poured into the flames, which now burnt up from all the  
hatchways. ‘The inhabitants,’ says Jones, in his letter to th

American commissioners, ‘began to appear in thousands, and  
individuals ran hastily towards us; I stood between them and the  
ship on fire, with a pistol in my hand, and ordered them to retire,  
which they did with precipitation. The flames had already caught  
the rigging, and began to ascend the mainmast; the sun was full  
an hour’s march above the horizon, and as sleep no longer ruled  
the world, it was time to retire; we re-embarked without opposi-  
tion. After all my people had embarked, I stood upon the pier  
for a considerable time, yet no persons advanced; I saw all the  
eminences around the town covered with the enraged inhabitants.  
  
‘¢ «When we had rowed to a considerable distance from the  
shore, the English began to run in vast numbers to their forts.  
Their disappointment may be easily imagined, when they found at  
least thirty cannon, the instruments of their vengeance, rendered  
useless. At length, however, they began to fire; having, as I  
apprehend, either brought down ship-guns, or used one or two  
cannon which lay on the beach at the foot of the walls, dismantled,  
and which had not been spiked. They fired with no direction, and  
the shot falling short of the boats, instead of doing any damage,  
afforded us some diversion, which my people could not help  
showing, by firing their pistols, &amp;c., in return of the salute. Had  
it been possible to have landed a few hours sooner, my success  
would have been complete; not a single ship out of more: than  
200 could possibly have escaped, and all the world would not have  
been able to have saved the town. What was done, however, is  
sufficient to show, that not all their boasted navy can protect their  
own coasts, and that the scenes of distress, which they have  
occasioned in America, may be soon brought home to their own  
door!’ ’”

was brought up on the enemy&#x27;s quarter, at the dis­

“ do likewise” on the south side. A sca-  
ling of walls, and Jones’s party have  
spiked up all the cannon in the first fort.  
Good. “ Finding the sentinels shut up in  
the guard-house, they were secured with-  
out being hurt.” This Jones is a worthy  
leader: where danger is, he is. “ With  
one man only (Mr. Green) he proceeds to  
the second fort, a quarter of a mile dis-  
tant, and spiked up all the cannon  
there.”’  
  
But the course of true love never did  
run smooth; and on his return, he found  
that the lights which were to have fired  
the shipping of both parties had burnt out.  
The day, too, is looking more earnestly  
on the work. What says Jones in this  
dilemma ?—That he “‘ would by no means  
retreat while any hopes of re-  
mained.” Old Joseph Glanvil said right,  
“ Who knoweth of the will with its vig-  
or?” A light is obtained near the town.

&#x27; Jones says with regard to these affairs: ‘On the 18th, in Glentine bay, on the south  
coast of Scotland, I met with a revenue wherry; it being the common practice of these  
vessels to board merchant ships, the Ranger then having no external appearance of war,  
it was expected that this rover would come alongside. I was, however, mistaken; for  
though the men were at their quarters, yet this vessel outsailed the Ranger, and got clear  
in spite of a severe cannonade.  
  
“ The next morning arp off the Mull of Galloway, I found myself so near a Scotch  
Coasting Schooner, loaded with barley, that I could not avoid sinking her. Understanding  
that there were ten or twelve sail of merchant ships, besides a Tender brigantine with a  
number of impressed men on board, at anchor in Lochran in Scotland, I thought this en-  
terprise worthy my attention; but the wind, which at the first would have served equally  
well to sail in or out of the Loch, shifted in a hard squall, so as to blow almost directly  
in, with’an appearance of bad weather. I was therefore obliged to abandon my project.  
  
‘Seeing a cutter off the lee bow steering for the Clyde, I guve chase, in hopes of cutting  
her off; but finding my endeavors ineffectual, I pursued no further than the Rock of Ailson.  
In the evening I fell in with a sloop from Dublin, which I sunk.”  
  
2 Jones in his report says: ‘‘The 2lst, being near Carrickfergus, a fishing boat came  
off which I detained. I saw a ship at anchor in the road, which I was informed by the  
fishermen was the British ship of war Drake, of twenty guns. I determined to attack her  
in the night; my plan was to overlay her cable, and to fall upon her bow, so as to have all  
her decks open and exposed to our musquetry, &amp;c.; at the same time, it was my intention  
to have secured the enemy by grapplings, so that, had they cut their cables, they would not  
have attained any advantage. The wind was high, and unfortunately the anchor was  
not let go as soon as the order was given, so that the Ranger was brought to upon the ene-  
my’s quarters at the distance of half a cable’s length. We had made no warlike appearance,  
of course had given no alarm; this determined me to cut immediately, which might ap-  
pear as if the cable had parted, and at the same time enable me, after making a tack out  
of the Loch, to return with the same prospect of advantage which I had at first. I was  
however prevented from returning, as I with difficulty weathered the light-house on the  
lee-side of the Loch, and as the gale increased. The weather now became so very stormy  
and severe, and the sea ran so high, that I was obliged to take shelter under the south shore  
of Scotiand.”

“ The 22d introduced fair weather, though the three kingdoms were, as far as the eye  
could reach, covered with snow. I now resolved once more to attempt Whitehaven ; but  
the wind became very light, so that the ship would not in proper time approach so near as  
I had intended. At midnight I left the ship with two boats and thirty-one volunteers;  
when we reached the outer pier the day began to dawn; I would not, however, abandon

The same Day crossed over to the other side of the Bay to the  
Mull of Galway Capt. Jones with Lt. Wallingsford and about 12  
Men went on shore [at St. Mary’s Isle] with design to take  
L‘. Selkirk, Prisoner. As he was not at Home and no man  
in the House, for the sake of his Lady &amp; her Company they  
came off without doing any further Damage than plundering Him  
  
scaling the walls and spiking up all the cannon in the first fort ; finding the sentinels shut up  
in the guard house, they were secured without being hurt. Having fixed sentinels, I now  
took with me one man only (Mr. Green), and spiked up all the cannon in the southern  
fort, distant from the others a quarter of a mile.  
  
“On my return from this business, I naturally expected to see the fire of the shipson the  
north side, as well as to find my own party with every thing in readiness to set fire to the  
shipping on the south; instead of this, I found the boat under the direction of Mr. Hill  
and Mr. Wallingford returned, and the party in some confusion, their light having burnt  
out at the instant when it became necessary. By the strangest fatality, my own party were  
in the same situation, the candles being all burnt out. The day too came on apace, yet I  
would by no means retract while any hopes of success remained. Having again placed sen-  
tinels, a light was obtained at a house disjoined from the town, and a fire was kindled in the  
steerage of a large ship, which was surrounded by at least one hundred and fifty others,  
chiefly from two to four hundred tons burden, and lying side by side, aground unsurround-  
ed by the water. There were, besides, from seventy to a hundred large ships onthe north  
arm of the harbor, aground clear of the water, and divided from the rest only by a stone  
  
ier of a ship’s height. I should (would) have kindled fires in other places if the time  
  
d yy ; as it did not, our care was to prevent the one kindled from beingeasily extin-  
guished. After some search, a barrel of tar was found, and poured into the flames, which  
now ascended from all the hatchways. The inhabitants began to appear in thousands, and  
individuals ran hastily towards us. I stood between them and the ship on fire, with a pis-  
tol in my hand, and ordered them to retire, which they did with precipitation. The flames  
had already caught in the rigging, and began to ascend the mainmast; the sun was a fall  
hour’s march above the horizon, and as sleep no longer ruled the world, it was time to re-  
tire. We re-embarked without opposition, having released a number of prisoners, as our  
boats could not carry them. After all my people had embarked, I stood upon the pier for  
a considerable space, yet no person advanced; I saw all the eminences around the town  
covered with the amazed inhabitants.  
  
“When we had rowed to a considerable distance from the shore, the English began to  
run in vast numbers to their forts; their disappointments may easily be imagined when  
they found, I suppose, at least thirty heavy cannon rendered useless. At length, however,  
they began to fire, having, as I apprehend, either brought: down ship’s guns, or used one  
or two cannon which lay on the beach at the foot of the walls, dismounted, and which had  
not been spiked. They fired with no direction, and the shot falling short of the boats,  
instead of doing us any damage afforded some diversion; which my people could not help  
showing, by discharging their pistols. &amp;c. in return of the salute. Had it been possible to  
have landed a few hours sooner, my success would have been complete. Not a single ship,  
out of more than two hundred, could possibly have escaped, and all the world would not have  
been able to save the town. What was done, however, is sufficient to show, that not all  
their boasted navy can protect their own coasts; and that the scenes of distress, which they  
have occasioned in America, may soon be brought home to their own door. One of my  
people was missing; and must, I fear, have fallen into the enemy’s hands after our depar-  
ture. I was pleased that in this business we neither killed or wounded any person. I  
brought off three prisoners as a sample.”
