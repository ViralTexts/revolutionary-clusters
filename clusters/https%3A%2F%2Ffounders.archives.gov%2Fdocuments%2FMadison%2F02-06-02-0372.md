ing of liberty will be extended to them as fast as they shall be prepared and disposed to receive it. In the mean time the mild spirit in which the powers derived from the Government of the United States will under its superintendance be administered, the parental interest which it takes in the happiness of those adopted into the general family, and a scrupulous regard to the spirit and tenor of the Treaty of Cession, promise a continuance of that satisfaction among the people of Louisiana, which has thus far, shewn itself. These observations are made, that you may be the better enabled to give to the French Government the explanations and assurances due to its solicitude in behalf of a people whose destiny it has committed to the justice, the honor and the policy of the United States.  
It does not appear that in the delivery of the province by the Spanish authorities to M Laussat anything passed denoting its limits either to the east the west or the north. Nor was any step taken by M Laussat either whilst the province was in his hands or at the time of his transfering it to ours calculated to dispossess Spain of any part of the territory east of the Mississippi. On the contrary in a private conference he stated positively that no part of the Floridas was included by the eastern boundary France having strenu[ously] insisted to have it extended to the Mobile which was peremptorily refused by Spain.

inasmuch as the reciprocal stipulations of the Convention of 1800 in this particular were carried into immediate and full effect on the part of the U States; and as a contrary construction would imply the relinquishment, without equivalent, of vested rights, never formally contested by France.  
Should France however be unlikely to admit her responsibility for the pretermitted claims, and there be danger that by urging her responsibility at this time, an equitable modification of any sort may be rendered more difficult, it will be best to pass over the question for the present, taking care that no waver be made which may either still further weaken the claims against France, or give colour for turning them over against the UStates.  
Neither of the succeeding alternatives will increase the balance payable by France, nor is it contemplated that in these or any other modifications whatever the Treasury of the United States is to be made chargeable with more than 3,750,000 dollars; or rather with more than so much of that sum as would satisfy the debts to which it is subjected by the last Convention.  
The object of each of the proposed modifications is to distribute whatever is to be paid by the U States and by France, among all the claimants, as well those omitted as those included in the last Convention, and in such a manner, that every claimant of both descriptions shall receive a fair proportion from the Treasury of the UStates, as well the balance to be paid by France.

The territory of Louisiana was no part of the nation at the adop-

governed as any other territory which belonged to us. That the  
inhabitants became citizens of the United States by virtue of the

were ‘sufficiently numerous to protect themselves and to form a State
