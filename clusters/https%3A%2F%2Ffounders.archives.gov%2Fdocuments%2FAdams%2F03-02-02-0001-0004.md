The Course of Philosophical Lectures was closed, with one, giving an explanation of the Orrery, and as an Introduction, to the astronomical Course, which we shall have next Quarter. I went also, and heard a Lecture from Dr. Waterhouse, upon digestion. I have nearly Lost this day; strol’d about with White in the afternoon. Cranch went to Boston. After Tea, we walk’d, half, an hour and then return’d and spent the rest of the Evening at Bridge’s Chamber.  
Mr. Williams closed his Lectures, with these Verses from Pope  
  
  
All are but parts of one stupendous whole,  
Whose Body, Nature is, and God, the Soul;  
That, chang’d through all, and yet in all the same;  
Great in the Earth, as in th’aethereal frame;  
Warms in the Sun, refreshes in the breeze,  
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,  
Lives through all Life, extends through all extent,  
Spreads undivided, operates unspent;  
To him no high, no low, no great, no small;  
He fills, he bounds, connects and equals all.

Mr. Howard a Minister from Boston, preach’d in the forenoon from, Proverbs I. 20. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth, her voice, in the Streets. 21. She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the City she uttereth her words saying. 22. How long ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? And in the afternoon from Luke XII. 48. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required. I like the last much the best. There was a liberality of Sentiment, in his System, which is very seldom, found among preachers in this Country. Those of Boston, however are distinguished, in general for this Quality.

This reciting in Locke, is the most ridiculous of all. When the Tutor enquires what is contained in such a section; many of the Scholars repeat the two first Lines in it, which very frequently say? nothing to the Purpose, and leave the rest for the Tutor to explain, which he commonly does, by saying over again the words of the author.

The Freshmen, by their high Spirit of Liberty, have again involved themselves in difficulties. The Sophimores, consider themselves as insulted, by them, and in a Class meeting, last evening determined, to oblige all the Freshmen, to take off their hats in the yard, and to send them on errands?. There has been a great deal of business between them to day; Mr. Hale, has had several of them before him. Isaac Adams among the rest, a daring, insolent fellow, who has too much Influence in that Class, and who will not, perhaps, take his degree with them.  
  
  
  
15th.  
  
  
We did not recite this morning. The struggle between the Freshmen and Sophimores still continues. They have been mutually hoisting one another all day.

The Battle of Bunker Hill, which JQA viewed from Braintree, and the death of Dr. Joseph Warren left a vivid impression on JQA which remained throughout his life. As late as 1846, he wrote of the events of that day: “I saw with my own eyes those fires, and heard Britannia’s thunders in the Battle of Bunker’s hill and witnessed the tears of my mother and mingled with them my own, at the fall of Warren a dear friend of my father, and a beloved Physician to me. He had been our family physician and surgeon, and had saved my fore finger from amputation under a very bad fracture”

This day the Seniors leave, College; there is no recitation in the morning, and prayers are deferred till 10 o’clock. The Class then went down in procession two by two, with the Poet at their head, and escorted the President to the Chapel. The President made a very long prayer, in which in addition to what he commonly says he pray’d a great deal for the Seniors: but I think he ought to get his occasional prayers by heart before he delivers them. He bungled always when he endeavoured to go out of the beaten track, and he has no talent at extempore Composition.

Mr. Mellen, preach’d here: he was a Tutor two or three years since. His forenoon discourse was from Psalm, c. 3.Know ye that the Lord, he is God: it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves; we are his People, and the sheep of his Pasture. The afternoon, from Acts X. 2. A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.  
Mr. Mellen’s manner is more affected, than that of any preacher I ever saw. His Sentiments were more liberal than is common, and his composition good; but all is entirely spoilt by his manner of speaking.

“ June 21, 1786. Class Day. This day the seniors leave college.  
There is no recitation in the morning, and prayers are deferred till 10  
o&#x27;clock. The class then went down in procession two by two with the  
Poet at their head, and escorted the President to the chapel. The  
President made a very long prayer, in which, in addition to what he  
commonly says, he prayed a great deal for the seniors ; but I think he  
ought to get his occasional prayers by heart before he delivers them.  
He bungled always when he endeavored to go out of the beaten track,  
and he has no talent at extempore composition.

These reflections seem to throw out wonderful indications of  
the infinite greatness of the Creator, and to prove how all  
creation must be before Him almost as though it were not. He  
is above all relations, such as they exist in creatures, Himself  
alone the Absolute and the Infinite. All else is nothing. All  
things dwindle into insignificance when compared with Him ;  
or rather no such comparison is so much as possible.  
  
To Him, no high, no low, no great, no small ;  
He fills, He bounds, connects, and equals all.”
