ed in Maryland, in which it is asserted the number of Fœderalists greatly predominates; and that being the case, we may look for favorable appointments, in spite of the rancour &amp; activity of a few discontented, and I may say apparently unprincipled men.  
I would willingly pass over in silence that part of your letter, in which you mention the persons who are Candidates for the two first offices in the Executive, if I did not fear the omission might seem to betray a want of confidence. Motives of delicasy have prevented me hitherto from conversing or writing on this Subject, when ever I could avoid it with decency. I may, however, with great sincerity &amp; I believe without offending against modesty or propriety, say to you that I most heartily wish the choice to which you allude might not fall upon me: and that, if it should, I must reserve to my self the right of making up my final decision, at the last moment when it can be no longer postponed; when all the circumstances can be brought into one view, &amp; when the expediency &amp; inexpediency of a refusal can be more judiciously determined than at present. But be assured, my dear Sir, if from any inducement I shall be persuaded ultimately to accept, it will not be (so far as I know my own heart) from any of a private or personal nature. Every personal consideration conspires to rivet me (if I may use the expression) to retirement. At my time of life and under my circumstances, nothing in this world can ever draw me from it, unless it be a conviction that the partiality of my Countrymen had made my services absolutely necessary, joined to a fear that my refusal might induce a belief that I prefered the conservation of my own reputation &amp; private ease to the good of my Country. After all, if I should conceive my self in a manner constrained to accept,  
  
I call Heaven to witness, that this very act would be the greatest sacrafice of my personal feelings &amp; wishes that ever I have been called upon to make. It would be to fore go repose and domestic enjoyment; for trouble, perhaps; for public obloquy: for I should consider myself as entering upon an unexplored field, enveloped on every side with clouds &amp; darkness.  
From this embarrassing situation, I had naturally supposed that my declarations at the close of the War would have saved me; and that my sincere intentions, then publicly made known, would have effectually precluded me for ever afterwards from being looked upon as a candidate for any Office. This hope, as a last anchor of worldly happiness in old age, I had still carefully preserved; untill the public papers &amp; private letters from my Corrispondents in almost every quarter, taught me to apprehend that I might soon be obliged to answer the question, whether I would go again into public, or no

the Presidency. ‘To Benjamin Lincoln he  
wrote: “I most heartily wish the choice to  
which you allude may not fall upon me. . . .  
If I should conceive myself in a manner con-  
strained to accept, I call Heaven to witness  
that this very act would be the greatest sacri-  
fice of my personal feelings and wishes that  
ever I have been called upon to make.”*® T

I may, however, with great sincerity, and [ be-  
lieve without offending against modesty or pro-  
priety, say to you, that I most heartily wish the  
choice to which you allude may not fall upon  
me; and thatif it should I must reserve to my-  
self the right of making up my final decision at  
the last moment. when it can be brought into one  
view, and when the expediency or inexpediency  
of a refusal can be more judiciously determined  
than at present. But be assured, my dear sir, if:  
from any inducement I shail be persuaded ulti-  
mately to accept, it will not be (so far as I know  
my own heart) from any of a private or personal  
nature. Every personal consideration conspires  
to rivet me (if I may use the expression) to re-  
tirement? At my time of life and under my cir-  
cumstances nothing in this world can ever draw  
mo from it unl esa it be a conviction that the par  
tiality of my countrymen had made my services  
absolutely necessary. joined toa fear that my re-  
fusal might induce a belief that I preferred the  
conservation of my own reputation and ee  
ease to the good of my country.
