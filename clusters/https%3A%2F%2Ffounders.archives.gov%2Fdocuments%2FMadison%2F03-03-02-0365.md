Washington May 24th. 1811.  
I have received, fellow Citizens, the petition which you have addressed to me, representing the inconveniences experienced from the existing non-importation law, and soliciting that the National Legislature may be speedily convened.  
It is known to all, that the Commerce of the United States has, for a considerable period, been greatly abridged and annoyed, by Edicts of the belligerent powers; each professing retaliation only on the other; but both violating the clearest rights of the United States as a neutral nation. In this extraordinary state of things, the Legislature, willing to avoid a resort to war, more especially during the concurrent aggressions of two great powers, themselves at war, the one with the other, and determined on the other hand against an unqualified acquiescence, have endeavored by successive and varied regulations affecting the commerce of the parties, to make it their interest to be just.  
In the Act of Congress out of which the existing non-importation has grown, the state of commerce was no otherwise qualified than by a provision, that in case either of the belligerents should revoke its unlawful Edicts, and the other should fail to do the same, our ports should be shut to the vessels and merchandize of the latter. This provision which, like our previous offers, repelled the very pretext set up by each, that its Edicts against our trade with the other, was required by an acquiescence in like Edicts of the other, was equally presented to the attention of both. In consequence of the communication, the French Government declared that its Decrees were revoked. As the British Government had expressed reluctance in issuing its orders, and repeatedly signified a wish to find in the example of its adversary, an occasion for putting an end to them, the expectation was the more confident, that the occasion would be promptly embraced. This was not done; and the period allowed for the purpose having elapsed, our ports became shut to British ships and merchandize. Whether the conduct of the French Government has been, and will be such as to satisfy the authorized expectations of the United States; or whether the British Government may have opened, or will open the way, for the Executive removal of the restrictions on British commerce with the United States, which it continues in its power to do, by revoking its own unlawful restrictions on our commerce, is to be ascertained by further information; which will be received and employed by the Executive, with that strict impartiality, which has been invariably maintained towards the two belligerents.  
Whatever may be the inconveniences resulting in the mean time, from the non-importation Act, it was not to have been supposed, that whilst it falls within the necessary power and practice of regulating our commercial intercourse with foreign Countries, according to circumstances, the Act would be regarded as not warranted by the Constitution; or that whilst it was a partial restriction only, and had for its object, an entire freedom of our commerce, by a liberation of it from foreign restrictions unlawfully imposed, it could be viewed as destroying commerce; and least of all, that a likeness could be seen between a law enacted by the representatives of the Country, with a view to the interest of the Country; and Acts of a Government in which the Country was not represented, framed with a view to the interest of another Country, at the expence of this.  
If appeals to the justice of the Belligerents, thro’ their interests, involve privations on our part also; it ought to be recollected, that this is an effect inseparable from every resort, by which one nation can right itself against the injustice of others.  
If sacrifices made for the sake of the whole, result more to some than to other districts or descriptions of Citizens, this also is an effect, which tho’ always to be regretted, can never be entirely avoided. Whether the appeal be to the sword, or to interruptions or modifications of customary intercourse, an equal operation on every part of the community can never happen. Nor would an unqualified acquiescence in belligerent restrictions on our commerce, if that could be reconciled with what the nation owes to itself, be less unequal in its effect on different local situations and interests.  
In estimating the particular measure which has been adopted by the National Councils, it may be reasonably expected therefore, from the candor of enlightened Citizens, that with the peculiarity of the public situation, they will be impressed also, with the difficulty of selecting the course most satisfactory, and best suited to diminish its evils or shorten their duration; that they will keep in mind, that a resort to war must involve necessary restrictions on commerce; and that were no measure whatever opposed to the belligerent acts against our commerce, it would not only remain under the severe restrictions now imposed by foreign hands, but new motives would be given, for prolonging and invigorating them.  
These observations are not meant to anticipate the policy which the Legislature may henceforward find best adapted, to support the honor or promote the interest of the nation; or to prejudge questions relative to particular changes, which may be pointed out by experience, or be called for by the state of our foreign relations. Neither do they imply any predetermination as to the measure of convening the Legislature, which it will be a duty to adopt or decline, as our national affairs may appear to require. The view of our situation presented to your patriotic reflections, has been suggested by that contained in your address; and it will have its desired effect, if it recalls your attention to the peculiar embarrassments with which the National Councils have had to contend; and enforces the importance of manifesting that union of all, in supporting the measures of the constituted authorities whilst actually in force, which is as necessary to their effect at home and abroad, as it is consistent with the right, and with the legitimate modes, of seeking a revisal of them. In the mode which the Town of New Haven has employed, I witness with satisfaction, that in exercising the right of freemen, the obligation of Citizens has not been forgotten; and that it affords a pledge and an example, which I am far from undervaluing. I tender you my respects and my friendly wishes.  
James Madison

she other ; but hath violstiog the clearest  
rights of the United States as a neutral  
nation. In this extraordinary state of  
things, the legislaturc, Willing to avoid  
a resort, to war, more eSpeaially during.  
the eonenrrent aggmssions of the two  
great powers, themselves at War, the one  
with the other, and determined on the

and varied regulat-ious afi&#x27;cet&#x27;mg the eom­  
meree ot&#x27;the parties, to make it their in­  
terest to be just. _  
in the act of Cougress, out of which the  
existing non-importation Las grown, the  
state of chumeree was no otherwise qual­  
isied than by :: provisiun, that in ease ei­  
ther of the belligereuts should revoke its  
unlawful etiirts, and the other should (all  
to do the same, our poets should be shut  
to the veschs and merchandize of the lat—  
ter. This provision, which, like all our  
previous oti&#x27;drs. repelled the very pretext  
set up by each, that its edicts against nui­  
trade with &quot;tho other, was required by an  
acqucscem-c in like ediets of the other,  
was equally presented to the attention of  
both. in consequence of the communica­  
tion, the French government declared that  
its Deerees were revoked. As the British  
government had expressed reiuetuuee iu  
issuing its orders, and repeatedly signified  
awish to find in the example 01&quot; its adver­  
sary, an occasion for putting an end to  
them, the expectation was the more confi­  
dent,that the occasion would be promptly  
embraced. This was not done; and the  
period allowed for the purpose having e­  
]:tpsed, our ports became shut to British  
  
ships and merchandi-size. Whether the  
conduct of the French government has  
been, and will be such as to satisfy the an­  
thorized expeetationsoftlw United States ;  
or whether the British government may  
have opened, orsswiZi open the way, for the  
Et—zcentive removal of the restrictions on  
British commeree with the United States,  
which it continues in its power to do, by  
revuking its own unl&#x27;awful l&#x27;esti-ietions on  
our commence, is to be ascei-tained by  
further information ; . which will be re­  
ceived and employed by the executive,  
with that strict impartiality, which has  
been invariahly maintained towards the two  
belligerents. &quot;  
Whatever may be the inconveniences  
resulting in the mean time, from the non­  
importation act, it was not to have been  
pnpposed, that whilst it falls within the  
necessary power and practice of regulat­  
&#x27; our commercial intercourse with so­  
reign countries, aceording to circum­  
stances, the act would be regarded as not  
warranted by the constitntion ; or that  
whilst it was a partial restl&#x27;iction only,  
and had for its object; an entire freedom  
ot&#x27;onr commeree, by asiliberation of it from  
foreign restrictions unlawfniiy imposed, it  
could be viewed as destroyiug colnmerce;  
and least of us., that a likeness could be  
seen between a law enacted by the repre­  
sentatives of the country, with a view to  
the interest of the country ; and acts of  
a government in which the country was  
not represented, framed with a view to  
the interest ot&#x27;another country, at the ex­  
pence of this.  
  
If appeals to the justice of the beliige­

If sacrifices made for the sake of the  
whole, result more to some than to other  
distriets or descriptions ol&#x27;citizens. this al­  
so is an eﬂ&#x27;ect, which, tho&#x27; always to be  
regre&#x27;tted, can never be entirely avoided.  
Whether the appeal be to the sword, or  
to intemptions or modifications of cus­  
tomary&#x27; intercourse, an equal operation on  
every part of the community can never  
happen. Nor would an unqualisied ac­  
quiescenee in belligcrent restrictions on  
our eommeree, if&#x27; that could be reconciled  
with what the nation owes to itself, beh-ss  
unequal in its eﬀect on diﬀm-entloca] situ­

la estimacing the particular measure  
which has been adopted by the National  
Couneils, it may be resonably expected  
therefore, from the candor of enlightened  
citizens, that with the peculiarity of the  
public Situation, they will be impt&#x27;essed  
also, with the difficulty of seleeting the  
course mere satisfactory, and best suited

PRESIDENT’^ ANSWER. •  
To the Inhabitants of the Town o/\A ev&gt; ila  
ire n  
I have received, Fellow Citizens, the pe­  
ition which you have addressed to me, ie  
presenting the inconveniences experienced  
trom the existing nonimportation lav/, and  
soliciting vtuu .the Nadoual Legislature may  
be speedily coti veiled.  
I: i, known toitll, that the Commerce of  
the United States has, lor a considerable  
i period, be:n greatly abridged and annoyed,  
Uy Edicts ot the belligeient powers ; each  
professing retaliation only on the other, but  
both violating the clearest rights ot the Uni  
ted States as a neutral nation. Iu this ex­  
traordinary state of tthings, the Legislature,  
willing .0 avoid a reso; t to war, more espe­  
cially during the concurrent aggressions of  
two gi\ at powets themselves at war, the  
one with the other, and determined on the  
other hand agaiust au u..qualified acquics  
cence, have endeavomed by successive and  
varied regulation, affecting the commerce  
lot the parties, to make it their interest to  
be jus..  
In toe iic of c ng.es, out - f which the ex­  
isting non import a ion has gro»v;,t the state  
ot Commerce was no otherwise qua..tied  
ban by a provision, that m case either ot  
tne belligerents should revoke lisunlawlul  
j edicts, and the other should tail to do the  
[ same, out* poris should be shut to the ves  
, sels and H.ercliandise ot the latter. This  
| provision, winch like ail our previousoners J  
| repelled the very pretext set up by each,&#x27;  
i that its edicts against our rade with the  
otner, was r&lt; qu red by an acquiescence in  
like edicts ot\..e othe., was equal.y pre­  
sented to the attention ot both. In co&#x27;„e  
quence of the communication, tne French  
government declared that its decrees were  
revoked. As the British government had  
expressed reluctance in issuing its orders,  
and repeatedly signified a wish to find in  
the example of its adversary, an occasion  
for pu ting an end to them, the expectation  
was the mure confident, that the occasion  
would be promptly embraced. This was  
not done ; and the period allowed tot the  
purpose having elapsed, our pofiis became  
shut to British ships and merchandise. Whe»  
tiler the conduct of the French government  
nas been, and will be such as to satisfy the  
authorised expectaiions of the U. S.atts j  
or wlu.Iter the British government may  
have o, ened, or will open the way mr the  
executive removal of the re,trie ions o/i  
British commerce with the Uniied States  
which it continues in its pow . r to do, by  
revoking its own unlawful restrictions’ on  
our commerce, is to be ascertained&#x27;by fur­  
ther information t which will be received  
and employ ed by the executive, with that  
strict impartiality, which has beeh invaria­  
bly maintained towards the two belliger­  
ents.  
  
Whatever may be the inconvenience&#x27;s e  
suiting m the mean time fiom the non nn  
poriaiiott act, it was not to hate hewn sup^  
posed, that whilst it tails within the tieces.  
sary power and practice ol legu.utmg i of  
commercial urercour.se with fotetgn coun­  
tries,, according to circumstances, the *o  
would be regarded as not watranted by ti c  
constitution; 01 that whilst it was a partial  
rc.trico .n only, a d had tor its o j ct, an  
entile tr.edomot our -o me ce, y a b-r­  
tion ol it from foreign restricti .ns unlaw­  
ful.y impo ed, it could be view d as destroy­  
ing commerce : and least o. ail, th.it .. like­  
ness eoflld . e si^n betw en a law enacted Jv  
the representatives of th countiy, with *  
vie, w to the interest of ilie country ;ami  
acts of a government in which the country  
was not represented, framed with a vu.-w i«,  
the interest of another Country, at i&#x27;.,e et&gt;  
pensc* of tltts.  
114appeals to the justice*of the Uclliger­  
ents, through their interest, involve priva  
lions on our part also ; it ought to be recol­  
lected, that this is an effect inseparable tr-&#x27;i#  
every resort, by which one nation can right  
itself aga nst the injustice of others.  
If sacrifices made for the ,-akc . f the  
whole, result more to some rhan to other  
districts or descripticns of citizens, this also  
is an effect which tho’ always to be regret­  
ted, can never be entirely avoided _VVlie  
ther the appeal be to the sword, or to inter­  
ruptions or modifications of customary in.  
tcrcour»e, an equ.&#x27;.l operation on every  
pait of the community can never happen  
Nor would an unqualified acquiescence in  
belligerent restrictions on our commerce if  
that could be reconciled with what the na­  
tion owes to itself, be les unrqua in its  
effect on different local situationo and inter­  
est*.  
In estimating the particular measure which  
has been.adopted by the national councils,  
it may lie reasonably expected, therefore,  
from the candour of enligtened citizens, that  
with the peculiarity Of the public situation,  
they will be impressed, ajso, with the ddfi  
culty of selecting the course most satislac­  
tory, and best suited .to diminish .its eviii  
or iliorjen tUctf duration i tbn\ tiia/ will  
  
keep in w.ir.fl, that ares* rt to war must in­

and tliSt fcfit lib nfeanore whatever oppo.  
sed to the belligerent acis against our com. .  
merce.it would nut only remain under the  
sev* re r strict tuns now imposed by foreign  
hands, but new motives would be gifen, lor  
prolonging and invignralingMhctn  
*1 hese observations are not nieunt to an­  
ticipate the policy which the Lrgislatute  
may henceforward find best adapted to sop.  
port the honor or promote the Interest of the  
nation ; or to prejudge questions rcladve to  
particular change*, which may be pointed  
out by experience, or be culled for by the  
state of our foreign relations. Neifhtr do  
they imply any predetermination as to the  
measure ofcnuveuiiig the legislature whicli  
it will be a duty to^klnpt or decline, as our  
national affairs may appear to require.  
I he view of our situation presented to  
your patriotic reflections, has hern suggest­  
ed by that contained in your addiess ; and  
it will have its desired effect, if it recalls  
your attention to the ptcu inr embarrass­

ven.  
I have received, Fellow Citizens, the peti- »  
turn Which voti have addressed to me, repre­  
senting the inconveniences experienced troin  
the existing non-importation law, and solicit­  
ing that the National Legislature may be  
speedily convened.  
It is known to all, that the Commerce of  
the United States has, fora considerable  
period, been greatly abridged and annoyed, by  
edicts of the belligerent powers; each pro­  
fessing retaliation only ou the other; but both  
violating the clearest rights of the U. States  
as a neutral nation, lu this extraordinary *  
state of things, the Legislature, willing to »­  
void a resort to war, more especially during  
the concurrent aggressions of two great pow­  
ers, themselves at war, the one with the o­  
ther, and determined on the other hand a­  
gainst an unqualified acquiescence, have en­  
deavored by successive and varied regulations  
affecting the commerce of the parties, to .  
make it their interest to he just.  
In the act of Congress out.of which the ex- T  
isting non-importation has grown, the state  
of commerce was no otherwise qualified than  
by a provision, that in case cither of the bel­  
ligerents should revoke its unlawful edicts,  
and the other should fait to da the same, our  
ports should be shut to the vessels and mer- •  
chandize ot the latter. This provision, which  
like all our previous offers, rdp^nkid the very  
pretext set up by each, that its edicts against  
our t^prtC^viHtjnie other, was required by an  
•u &#x27;)J#r-Q^e n\like edicts of the otner, was  
eqiMlly^pente^t0 the attention cf both. In  
coi«equtiT^ f thScommunication, the French  
gov^-imiTf&#x27;.tdecl i«d that its decrees were re­  
voke^ As the British Crovermncnt had ex­  
  
I&#x27;*-~ . V.uuumvc m it© gi&#x27;UCl h, 0.11(1  
repeatedly signified a wish to find in thd ex­  
ample ol its adversary, an occasion for put­  
ting an end to them, the expectation was the  
more confident, that the occasion would be  
promptly embraced. This was net dune_  
and the period allowed for the purpose hav­  
ing elapsed, our ports became shut to British  
ships and merchandize. Whether the con­  
duct of the French government has been, and  
will be such as to satisfy the authorised ex­  
pectations of the United States ; or whether  
the British government may have opened, or  
will open the way, for the Executive remov­  
al of the restrictions on British commerce  
with the United States, which it continues in  
its power to do, by revoking its own unlawful  
restrictions on our commerce, is to be ascer­  
tained by further information ; which will be  
received and employed by the executive, with  
that strict impartiality, which has been in­  
variably maintained towards the two bellige­  
rents.  
Whatever may be the inconveniences ra-&#x27;  
sultinafin the mean time, from the non-impor­  
tatioaactrtj^was not to have been supposed  
that wlunwt fans within the necessary pow­  
er ann^practicg^f regulating our commerci­  
al intercourse v- ith foreign countries, accord­  
ing to circumstances, the act u’ould be re­  
garded as not warranted by the constitution  
—or that whilst it was a partial restriction  
cnly, and had for its object, an entire free­  
dom of our commerce, by a liberation of it  
from foreign restrictions unlawfully imposed,  
it could be viewed as destroying commerce ;  
and least of all, that a likeness could be seen  
between a law enacted by the representatives  
of the country, with a view to the intt^.t of  
the country; and acts of a government in  
which the country was not represented, fra­  
med with a view to the iutcrest of another  
country, at the expence of this,  
’f appeals to the justice ol the belligerents,  
througltfthfeir Interests, involve privations on  
our pag al^.; it\ught to be recollected, that  
this is fc Jjfcc-t Acparabie from every re­  
sort, bj^TWh oJI nation can right itself a­  
gainst th^u^woce of others.  
If sacrifices made for the sake of the whole,  
result more to some than toother districts or  
descriptions of citizens, tins also is an tiioct,  
which though always to be regretted, can  
never be entirely avoided. Whether the ap­  
Hft.il hft In th r» KU/Al*l1 /IV f rt Snf&lt;v, __  
  
modulations of customary intercourse, au  
eg u a tope ration on every part of the commu­  
nity &lt;%n|W|fcr «{irtppen. Nor would an un­  
qualifmuapquieiceiice in belligerent restric­  
tions omcur conAnerce, if that could be re­  
conciled wyith jrfu.1 the nation ewes to itself,  
be less unequivocal in i*s ertecl ou different  
local situations and interests.  
In estimating the particular men sure which  
bas been adopted by the National Councils, it  
may be reasonably expected therefore, from  
the candor of enlightened citizens, that with  
the peculiarity of the public situation, they  
will be iim^essed also, with difficulty of se­  
lecting me course most satisfactory, and best  
suited t$ tfTftish its evils or shorten their  
duration: &lt;im^theyAvill keep in mind, that a  
resort toVa&#x27;f&#x27;mnsjMivolve necessary rcslric­  
tions on comsnecee, and that were no mea­  
sure whatever opposed to the belligerent acts  
against our commerce, it would not only re­  
main under the severe restrictions now im­  
posed hr foreign hands, biit new motive*,  
would be given for prolonging and invigorat^  
ing them.  
l hese observations are not meant to anti-/  
cipate the policy which the Legislature may  
henceforward find best adopted, to support!  
the haficr or promote thq .nterest of the nati­  
on orloAyemdge que-“*^)&lt;&gt; relative to parti­

any predetermination au to the measure of  
convening the legislature, which it will be a  
duty to adopt or decline, as our national af­  
fairs may appear to require.  
The view of onr situation presented to yourf  
patriotic ^flections, has been suggested \if  
thatcontelsed in your address; and it will  
have its t Aired effect, if it recalls your at­  
tention&#x27;uAtffe peculiar embarrassments with

~ Inthe act of Congress out of which the  
existing non-importation has grown, the state  
of commerce wasno otherwise qualified than  
by a provision, that in case either of the bel­  
ligerents should revoke its unlawful Edicts,  
l and the other should fuil to do the same, our  
ports showld be shut to the vessels and mer­  
chandize of the latter. ‘T&#x27;his provision which  
like all our previous offers, repelled the very  
pretext set up by each, that its Edicts against  
our own trade with the other, was required  
by an acquiescence in like Edicts of the oth­  
er, was equully presented to the attention of  
both. In conscquence of the communication,  
the I&#x27;rench Government declared that its de­  
crees were revoked. As the British Goy­  
ernment had expressed reluctance in issuing  
its orders, and repeatedly signified a wish to  
find in the example of its adversary, an oc­  
casion for puiting an end te them, the ex­  
pectation was the more confident, that the  
occasion would be promptly embraced. This  
was not done ; and the period allowed for the  
purpose having elapsed, our ports became  
shut to British ships and merchandize. Whe­  
ther the conduct of the French government  
has been, and will be such as to satisly the  
authorized expectations éf the U. Stutes ; or  
whether the British government may have  
opencd, or will open the way, for the execu­  
tive removal of the restrictions on British  
commerce with the United States, which it  
continuc~ in its power to do, by revoking its  
own unlawful restrictions on our cominerce,is  
to be ascertained by further information ;  
which wiil be received and employed by the  
Executive, with that strict impartiality,  
which has been invariably maintined toward  
the two belligercents. :  
Whatever muy be the inconvenicnces re­  
sulting in the mean time, from the noo-im.  
portation acty it was not to have been suppos­  
ed, that whilst it falls within the necessary  
power and practice of regulating our com­  
meveial intercourse with foreign cousiries,  
according to circninstances, the act would be  
regarded as not warranted by the constitu.  
tion ; or that whilst it was a partial restric­  
tion only, and had for its object, an eniire  
freedom ol our comnerce, by a liberation of  
it from forcign restrictions unlawfully impos­  
ed, it could be viewed as destroying com­  
merce ; and least of all, that a likeness could  
be sccn between a law enacted by the repre- ‘  
sentatives of the country with a view to the  
interest of the country ; and acts of a govern­  
ment in which the country was not represent­  
ed, framed with a view to the interest of ano­  
ther country, at the expense of this.  
If appeals to the justice of the belligerents,  
through their interests, involve privations on  
our part also ; it ought to be recollected, that  
this is an effect inseparable from every lesort  
by which the nation can right itsclt aguinst  
the injustice of others..  
  
LEOILIN.  
  
If sacrilices made for the sake of the whole  
result more to some thun to other districts or  
descriptions of citizens, this also is an cflect,  
which tho&#x27; alwuys to be reg.eited, can never  
be entirely avoider. Whether the appeal be  
to the sword, or to interruptions or modifica­  
tions of customary intercourse, an equal ope­  
ration on every part of the community can  
never bappen. Nor would an unqualified ac­  
(uiescence in belligerent restrictions on our  
commerce, if that could be reconciled with  
what the nation owes to itself, be less une­  
qual &#x27;n its effeets on different local situations  
and interests.  
  
In estimating the particular measure which  
has been adopted by the National Councils, it  
may be reasonably expected thereflore, from  
the candour of enlightened citizens, that with  
the peculiarity of the publick situation, they  
will be impressed also, with the difficulty of  
selecting the course most satisfactory, and  
best suited to diminish its evils or shorten  
their duration ; that they will keep in mind,  
that a resort to war must involve nccessary  
restrictions on commerce and that were no  
measure whatever opposed to the belliperent  
acts against our commerce, it would not only  
remain under the severe restrictions now im­  
posed by foreign hands, but new motives  
would be given, for prolonging and invigorat­  
ing them. ;  
  
The view of our situation presented to  
your patriotick reflections, has been suggest­  
ed by that contained in your address : and it  
will have its desived effect, if it recalls your  
attention to the peculiar embarrassments  
with which the National Councils have had  
to contend ; and enforces the importance of  
manifesting that union of all, in supporting  
the measures of the constituted authorities  
whilst actually in force, which is as necessa­  
ry to their effect at home and abroad, as it is  
consistent with the right, and with the legiti­  
mate modes, of seeking a revisal of them. In

PKESIDENT&#x27;s ANSWER  
2V the Inhabitants of llie Towrt of JVew Haven.  
I have received, Fellow-Citizens,, the peti  
tiop which you have addressed to ;me, repre­  
senting the inconveniences experienced from  
I the existing non-importation law, and solicit  
ing that the National Legislature may be  
speedily convened. &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;  
It 19 known to all, that the Commerce of  
the U. States has, for a considerable period,  
?been crreatlv abridced and annoved bv edicts  
of the belligerent powers each prolessing  
retaliation only on the.other ; but bothviolat-  
ing the clearest rights of tire U. Statesas a:  
neutral nation. In this extraordinary state  
of things, the Legislature, willing; to avoid &amp;  
resort to war, more especially during the  
concurrent aggressions of two great powerf  
themselves at -war, the one with the other  
and determined on the other hand against an  
unqualified acquiescence?: have endeavored  
by successive and varied regulations affect­  
ing the commerce of the parties, I to make it  
their interest to be just. I &#x27; - J-  
ln the act of,&#x27; Congress out of1 which the  
existing non-importatidn has rroxvii, the state  
oi commerce was no tberwiie qiialified than  
by a prdvision, that in case either of the bel­  
ligerents should revoke Mts-tmlawful Edicts.  
and the other thould fail to do the same, bur  
ports should be shut to the vessels and mer­  
chandize of the latter. This provision, which  
like all our hrevious offers, repelled the very  
pretext set up byach, that its edicts against  
our trade with the other, was requhed bv  
an acquiescence m like edicts of the oilier.  
was equally presented to tht attention of  
both. In consequence of the communication,  
the French governmcnt&#x27;declared that its de­  
crees were Tevoked f As the British govern­  
ment had expressed reluctance in issuing its  
orders, and repeatedly signified a wish to  
find in the. example t;itaadversari&#x27;, an oc­  
casion for putting an end to them, the expec­  
tation walhe, more confident, that tbeoc­  
casibh would be promptly; emhracedThis

In estimating the particular measure whicij  
has been adopted by the national CouTiciU,it  
may be reasonably expected, therefore, 1  
the candor of enlightened citizens, that, vift  
the peculiarity of the public situation, the  
will be impressed also with the ditiiculu of  
selecting the course most satisfactory  
best, suited to diminish&#x27; its evils 6r shorten

that a resort to war must involve nccessatj  
restrictions on commerce, and that weao  
measures whatever opposed .to the lllige.  
rent &quot;acts against, our commerce, it vo;i)i  
not only remain under tle severe restrictions  
now imposed by foreign hands,- hut new kg.  
tives would be given, for p longing and in.  
vigorating them. v  
These observations are not meant to anti..  
cipate lhe policy: which the Legislatuit may  
henceforward ind best adapted to - support  
the lionor or promote the interest of thenj,  
tion; or to prejudge questions relative to  
particular. changes, -..which, may be pointed

they imply any predetermination as to tie

it will be a duty to adopt or decline, ; as our  
national affairs may appear to require.  
The view of our situation presented toyour  
patriotic reflections, has been suggested by  
that contained incuir address ; and it will  
have its desired effect if it recalls your at­  
teniion&#x27; to the peculiar embarrassments vith

I have received, fellow citizens, the pc  
which yon hare addressed to me, representing  
the inconveniencies experienced from the ex­  
isting Non-importation Law, and soliciting  
that the national legislature may be speedily  
convened.  
It is&#x27;know to all, that the commerce of  
the united States has, for a considerable pe­  
riod, been greatly abridged and annoyed by

*1 nation. In this extraordinary t!  
state of things, the legislature, willing to n

aggressions si two great Pow- b  
tie-, themselves at war, the one with the o  
i _etermined on the: other hand a- ii  
gainst an unqualified acquiescen.ee, have endear- o  
oared, by successive and ... regulations o  
affecting the Commerce of the parties, to make a  
it their interest to be just.  
In the act of Congress out of which the ex- t  
jskfig non-importation has grown, the state of t  
merce was no otherwise qualified&#x27;than by 1  
eat in case either of the Belli- t  
ats should revoke its unlawful edicts, and i  
the other should fail to do the same, our ports &lt;  
shall be shut to. the vessels and merchandize of j  
the latter. This provision, which, like all i  
our previous oilers, repelled the very pretext  
set up by each, that its edicts against cur  
trade with the other, WW cd by&#x27;an ac­  
quiescence in like edicts of the other, was  
equally presented to the attention of both. In  
consequence of the communication, the -French  
Government declared that its decrees were re­  
voked. As the British Gove had ex. .  
pressed reluctance in issuing its orders, and  
i\ peatedly signified a wish to find in the exam,  
pie of its adversary, an occasion for putting  
an end to them, the expectation was the more  
confident, that the occasion would be prompt.  
ly embraced. This was not done; and the  
period allowed for the purpose having elapsed,  
our ports became shut to the British ships and  
merchandize. Whether the conduct of the  
French Government had been, and will be  
snch as to satisfy the authorised expectations  
of the United States; or whether the British  
Government may have opened, or will open  
the way, for the executive removal of the. re.  
Strictions on our, commerce with the United  
States, which it continues in its power to do,  
by revoking its own unlawful restrictions on  
our commerce, is to be ascertained by-further  
information, which&#x27;will be received and em.  
ployed by the executive, with that&#x27;&#x27;strict im.  
partiality,&#x27;which has been, invariably main­  
tained towards the two Belligerents.  
Whatever may be the inconvenience result.  
fa .&#x27; in the mean time from the non-importa­  
&gt; act, it was not to have been supposed,  
■ Ist it falls within the necessary power  
and practice of regulating our commercial in­  
ter&lt; h foreign countries, according to  
ca&gt; c, the act would be regarded as  
I warranted by the constitution ; or that,  
■whilst it was partial restriction only, and had  
fori .:.e freedom of our com.  
rce, by a liberation of it from foreign re­  
is unlawfully imposed, it could be  
viewed as destroying commerce; and, least of  
all, that a likeness could be seen between a  
law enacted by the representatives of the  
country and acts of a Government &#x27;in which  
the country was not represented, framed with  
a view to the interest of another country, at  
t ie expense of this.  
if appeals to the justice of the Belligerents,  
through their interests, involve&#x27; privations on  
our parts also, it ought tó be recollected, that  
this is an effect inseparable from every resort,  
by which one nation can right itself against  
the injustice of other?.  
If sacrifices ire he sake of the whole,  
result more to some than to other districts or  
description of citizens, this also is an effect,  
which, though always to be regretted, can  
never be entirely avoided. Whether the ap­  
peal be to the sword, or to interruptions or  
modifications of customary intercourse, an  
equal operation on every part of the com.  
m unity can never happen. -Vor would an  
unqualified acquiescence in belligerent restic­  
tions on oar commerce, if that could be re­  
conciled with what the nation owes to itself,  
be less unequal in its effect on tlifferent. local  
situations and interests.  
In estimating the particular measure which  
has been adopted by the National Councils,  
it may be reasonably expected, therefore,  
from the candour of enlightened citizens, that  
with the peculiarity of the public situation,  
they will ba impressed also with the difficulty  
of selecting tiie course most satisfactory, and  
best suited to diminish its evils or shorten  
iaeir duration; that they will keep in mind,  
that a resort to war must involve necessary  
restrictions on commerce, and that were no  
measure whatever opposed to the belligerent  
acts against, our commerce, it would not only  
remain under the severe, restrictions now im­  
posed by foreign hands, but new motives  
would be given for prolonging and invigorat.  
ing them.  
These observations are not meant io anti­  
cipate the policy whish the Legislature may  
henceforward find best adapted to support  
the honor or promote ihe interests of the  
nation ; or to prejudge questions relative to  
particular changes, which may be pointed out  
by experience, or be &quot;called for by the state  
of our foreign relations. Neither do they  
imply any predetermination as to the measure  
of convening the Legislature, which it will be  
our duty to adopt or decline, as our national  
affairs may appear to require.  
The view óf our situation presented to your  
patriotic reflections,&quot; has been suggested by  
that contained in your address ; and it will  
have its desired effect, if it recals your at­  
tention to the peculiar embarrassments with

manifesting that union of all, in supporting  
the measures of the constituted authorities  
whilst actually inforce, which and &#x27;with the  
legitimate modes, of seeking a rèvisal of them.  
I-n the mode which the Town of New-Haven  
has employed, I witness with satisfaction,  
that in exercising the right of freeman, the  
obligation of citizens has not been forgotten;
