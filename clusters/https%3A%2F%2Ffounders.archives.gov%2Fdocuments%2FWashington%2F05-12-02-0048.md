Flattering as it may be to the human mind, &amp; truly honorable as it is to receive from our fellow Citizens testimonies of approbation for exertions to promote the public welfare; it is not less pleasing to know, that the milder virtues of the heart are highly respected by a Society whose liberal principles must be founded in the immutable Laws of truth and justice.
