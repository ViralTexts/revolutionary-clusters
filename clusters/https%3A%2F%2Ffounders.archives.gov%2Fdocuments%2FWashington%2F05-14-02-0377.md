Philadelphia [23d] Decr 1793  
  
The letter which I wrote to you on the 18th and the papers therein enclosed with the  
Plans of the several farms (which Mr Lewis was directed to leave with you) were designed  
to give you a general view of the business entrusted to your care. I shall now, as  
intimated in that letter, give you my sentiments on many other matters of a more  
particular nature.  
Among the first things to be done after you are well fixed yourself, will be, I  
presume, that of taking an exact account of the Stock of every species—Tools—and  
implements on each of the farms: charging them therewith; that a regular account thereof  
may be rendered whenever called for. Buy in Alexandria a proper (bound) book for this  
purpose, and another to enter the weekly reports in. The latter is required not only for  
my present satisfaction, but that it may also, at any time hereafter shew in what manner  
the hands have been employed; and the state of the Stock and other things at any past  
period; and it is my wish, as this is intended as a register of the proceedings on the  
farms, that they may be made with correctness; always comparing the last with the  
preceeding weeks report and all differences satisfactorily accounted for. The Overseers  
are allowed paper for these Reports. Suffer no excuse therefore for their not coming  
into you every Saturday night, that you may be enabled  
to forward a copy of them to me by the wednesday’s Post following. And as it is not only  
satisfactory, but may be of real utility, to know the state of the weather as to heat  
&amp; cold, but drought or moisture; prefix, as usual, at the head of every weeks report  
a meteorological account of these; The Thermometer which is at Mount  
Vernon will enable you to do the first.  
The work essentially necessary to be done by my Carpenters, &amp; which presses  
most—is—compleating the New Barn at Dogue Run, &amp; the sheds there for horses  
&amp;ca—building the house for Crow—Repairing my house in Alexandria for Mrs Fanny  
Washington—which must be done before the first of  
May—Inclosing the lot on which it stands for a Garden or Yard. Repairing the Millers  
house. Removing the larger kind of the Negro quarters (the smaller ones or cabbins, I  
presume the people with a little assistance of Carts can do themselves) to the ground  
marked out for them opposite to Crows New house. Repairing at a proper time those he  
will remove from. Lending aid in drawing the houses at River farm into some uniform  
shape, in a convenient place. Repairing the Barn &amp; Stables at Muddy hole.  
Compleating the Dormant Windows in the back of the Stables at Mansion house and putting  
two in the front of it agreeably to directions already given to Thomas Green—after  
which, and perhaps doing some other things which do not occur to me at this moment, my  
intention is to build a large Barn, and sheds for Stables upon the plan of that at Dogue  
run (if, on trial it should be found to answer the expectation wch is formed of it) at  
River Farm.  
I give you this detail of Carpenters work, that by having the subject before you in a  
collected view, you may be the better able to direct the execution; and to prevent Green  
from flying from one thing to another without order or system; and thereby judging  
whether he carries it on with that dispatch &amp; judgment which is necessary.  
As you know my anxiety with respect to the Substitution of live fences in place of dead  
ones (as soon, &amp; as fast as the nature of things will admit) I should not again  
mention it, were it not that this is the Season for saving the Haws of the thorn—Berries  
from the Cedar trees—and such things as are fit for the purpose of hedging; and to  
prevent trimming the Lombardy Poplar and Willows, that the cuttings may be applied to  
this use—for as these two last are of very quick growth, I am of opinion fences might soon be raised by means of them, that will be  
competent against every thing but Hogs, whilst those of slower growth may be coming on  
to supply their places; and whether it is not better to raise Porke in Styes, is a  
matter worthy of serious consideration—for I believe by the common  
mode I never get the half of what is raised by the Sows; especially if they are kept in  
good order; to do which is attended with no small expence, &amp; to have them stolen afterwds is vexatious.  
When I left home, Davy at Muddy hole had finished getting out his wheat, and had  
nothing but the security of his Corn &amp; some fencing, to employ his people about,  
during the fall and Winter—I was induced from this consideration, and the anxious desire  
I have to reclaim, and lay to grass my Mill Swamp, to order him to give all the aid he  
could to McKoy in the accomplishment of this work but it really appears to me that the  
fall, fine as it has proved, has actually been spent About I know not what. What can be  
done with those swamps, must now be left to you—&amp; the state the weather will put  
them in. My hope, &amp; expectation once, was, that the second lot might have been laid  
to grass next spring if not this Fall, and that the one above it, would have been  
ditched—grubbed—&amp; planted in Corn—but as the matter now stands, you must be governed  
by circumstances and your own view of the case; with this caution, not to undertake in  
this, or any thing else, more than you can accomplish well: recollecting always, that a  
thing but half done is never done; and well done, is, in a manner done for ever.  
At McKoys, I staked out two Clover lots adjoining the Barn yard, and gave him &amp; Tom  
Davis (who was present) my ideas respecting them. The sooner these can be  
inclosed—especially that on the West side, next the Wood—the better; as it is my wish to  
plough it this fall, &amp; plant Potatoes therein in the Spring. Serving that on the  
East side of the Barn in like manner next year—and the Spot which was in oats, adjoining  
thereto the year following. It is my intention also to run a lane from the first Gate  
you enter going into this Farm up to the Barn yard—and another lane from the Wood to No.  
4 across the Meadow, and between fields No. 3 &amp;  
5. I do not expect that all these things can be accomplished in a moment—but having them  
in your view at the sametime you will know better how to proceed—As the Wood in No. 5  
will be to be cleared when that field comes into Corn, it will be proper that all the  
Timber, Rails and wood that is wanted on the farm, should be taken from hence as far as  
it will go—and cut with an eye to this event.  
One of the Grass lots at Muddy hole, the South western one (pointed  
out to Davy) ought to be plowed up this fall, &amp; planted with Potatoes in the Spring.  
And at Union farm it is intended to take of four five acre lots from field No. 2  
directly in front of the Barn as will appear more clearly by the Sketch herewith  
enclosed—The lots marked No. 1 &amp; 2 in which, should be sowed in Feby or beginning of  
March with clover seed on the Wheat. At the Rive[r] farm I propose three lots for Grass,  
South of the lane in front of the Barn, as you will perceive by another Sketch also  
enclosed. What will be done with the ground between  
the Barn at that place &amp; No. 6 when the fence comes to be run there, is left to  
yourself to decide, after taking a full view of things &amp; seeing what the force is  
competent to in fencing (of which much is wanting) &amp;ca—Stuart wished much for  
another fellow at this place, and as that boy Cyrus, at Mansion house, is now nearly a  
Man, and very unfit I believe to be entrusted with  
horses, whose feed there is strong suspicions he steals, I have no objection to your sending there. nor indeed have I any to your disposing of  
any of the others, differently from what they are, after you have taken time to consider  
what arrangements can be made for the best, &amp; most advantageous purposes. Thomas  
Davis &amp; Muclus must however be considered as among the tradesmen; &amp; when not  
employed in making &amp; laying of Bricks &amp; other jobs in that way, may be aiding  
the Carpenters. and the fellow called Muddy hole Will, as he has for many years been a  
kind of Overseer, had better remain in his present Station; with respect to the rest, I  
have no choice about them.  
There is nothing which stands in greater need of regulation than the Waggons &amp;  
Carts at the Mansion House which always whilst I was at home appeared to me to be most  
wretchedly employed—first in never carrying half a load; 2dly in flying from one thing  
to another; and thirdly in no person seeming to know what they really did; and  
oftentimes under pretence of doing this, that, and the other thing, did nothing at all;  
or what was tantamount to it. that is—instead of bringing in, or carrying to any place,  
full loads, and so many of them in a day; the Waggon, or a Cart, under pretence of  
drawing wood, or carrying Staves to the Mill wd go the places from whence they were to  
be taken, and go to sleep perhaps; and return with not more than half a load. Frequently  
have I seen a Cart go from the Mansion house, or from the river side to the new Barn  
with little or no more lime or sand in it, than a man would carry on  
his back—the consequence of this was that the Brick layers were half their time idle;  
for it required no more time to make the trip with a full load than it did with half a  
load—of course, double the qty would be transported under good regulation.  
You will perceive by my agreemt with Ehler, the Gardener, that he &amp; his wife were  
to eat of the Victuals that went from my Table (in the Cellar) instead of having it  
Cooked by his wife as had been the custom with them.  
At the time that agreement was made I kept a Table for Mrs Fanny Washington, but as she  
has resolved to live in Alexandria, this will no longer be kept up; and therefore it  
would be best I should conceive, to let them return to their old mode, &amp; for the  
young Gardener to eat with them—but as the agreement  
is otherwise I would not force this upon them, unless it was their own choice—especially  
if Butler remains there, for in that case as Lucy (the Cook) must get Victuals for him,  
it will make but little difference whether she gets for one or more; you will therefore  
do what seems best, &amp; most agreeable in this matter taking care that they have a  
sufficiency without waste, or misapplication—I am very willing to allow them enough, and  
of such provisions, day by day, as is wholesome &amp; good, but no more—they have, each  
of them been allowed a bottle of Beer a day—and this must be continued to them—that is a  
quart each, for when I am from home the Beer will not be bottled though it may be brewed  
as the occasion requires—The Gardener has too great a propensity to drink, and behaves  
improperly when in liquor; admonish him against it as much as you can, as he behaves  
well when sober—understands his business—and I believe is not naturally idle—but only so  
when occasioned by drink—His wife has been put in charge of the spinners—that is, to  
deliver out the Wool &amp; flax, &amp; receive the thread yarn &amp;ca; she seems well  
disposed, but how far she is worthy of trust, or is capable of having the work done  
properly, you will be better able to judge after a while, than I am now. Method, in all  
these things, is desirable, and after it is once adopted, and got into a proper train  
things will work easy.  
Do not suffer the Quarter Negro Children to be in the Kitchen, or in the yards unless  
brought there on business—As besides the bad habit—they too frequently are breaking  
limbs, or twigs from, or doing other injury to my shrubs—some of which at a considerable  
expence, have been propagated.  
  
From some complaints made by my Negroes, that they had not a sufficent allowance of  
meal, and from a willingness that they should have enough, the quantity was increased by  
Mr Whiting so as to amount (by what I have learnt from Mr Stuart) to profusion. This is  
an error again on the other side—My wish &amp; desire is that they should have as much  
as they can eat without waste and no more. Under these Ideas I request you would examine  
into this matter &amp; regulate their allowance upon just principles. I always used to  
lay in a great quantity of Fish for them—and when we were at home Meat, fat, &amp; other  
things were now and then given to them besides; But it would seem (from their accts at  
least) that the Fish which were laid in for them last Spring have disappeared without  
their deriving much benefit from them.  
By this time I expect the Hogs that were put up for Porke, either are killed—or are fit  
to kill. I request, after every person has had their allowance given to them, that the  
residue may be made into Bacon, and due attention given to it; for allmost every year,  
since we left home, half of it or more, has been spoilt—either for want of salt, or want  
of proper attention in smoking it; if not spoiled in the pickle. Davy at Muddy hole, has  
always had two or three hundd weight of Porke given to him at killing time, &amp; I  
believe the Insides of the Hogs—that is—the Hastlets, Guts (after the fat is stripped  
of) &amp;ca is given among the other Negroes at the different places.  
After the drilled Wheat at Union farm is taken off, let particular care be used to  
prevent its being mixed with any other; as, if it answers the character given of it, it  
will be a great acquision. that, &amp; the drilled Wheat at Stuarts are of the same  
kind, and were sown in drills that the ground might be worked whilst it was growing, and  
the most made of it that can be. Whether to sow the ground which is at Union farm (in  
this Wheat) with Buck Wheat and grass Seeds immediately after harvest or with Buck Wheat  
alone to be plowed in for manure &amp; grass seeds afterwards I shall leave to you to  
decide. I shall want all the ground within that Inclosure laid down with grass &amp;  
leave the manner of doing it to you. And as the other parts within the same Inclosure—as  
also in that of McKoys, was sown very late in the fall with grass-seeds pray examine  
them attentively, from time to time, and if you shall be of opinion that the Seed is not  
come well, or is too thin, sprinkle as much more over it as you shall deem necessary, as  
I am very anxious to have them well taken, &amp; without delay with  
grass. The Wheat fields at Dogue run are to be sown in the Month of February or March  
with grass Seeds—No. 3 with Clover alone—The other with Clover &amp; Timothy or Clover  
&amp; Orchard grass mixed, as it is intended to be laid to Grass.  
It is indispensably necessary that the alteration marked out in the Mill Race should be  
accomplished as soon as possible—1st because the waste of Water in the old part (which  
it avoids) is more than can be afforded except at times of the greatest plenty—and 2dly because I am at more expence and trouble in  
repairing (after every heavy rain) the breaches, in the part that will be thrown out,  
than in digging the new. There is another job that is  
essential; and that is, to make the Post &amp; Rail fence from the Millers house up to  
the trunnel fence which runs across the meadow, or to the next cross fence, if that lot  
is cultivated next year of such stout &amp; strong materials and of such a height as to  
bid defiance to trespassers of every kind, among wch the worthless people who live near  
it are the worst as I am satisfied they give every aid in their power which can be done  
without discovery to let in their Hogs—The whole of this outer fence, will be, I am  
sure, to be done anew; but it can only be accomplished by degrees—but let that which is  
done, be compleated effectually as well by a good and sufficient ditch as by a stout Post &amp; rail fence—along which if a hedge of Honey  
locust could be got to grow entirely round it would form a sufficient barrier against  
bad neighbours as they would hardly attempt to cut them down to let their stock in upon  
me which, I am sure is the case at present as without the aids some of them derive from  
my Inclosures and their connexion with my Negroes they would be unable to live upon the  
miserable land they occupy.  
Whenever the field No. 3 at Union farm is prepared for a Crop, which was intended to be  
the case next year—if the piece of Wood within, is touched at all, let there be a  
handsome clup of trees left at the further end of it—or more than one—according to the  
shape &amp; growth of the Wood.  
I have, for years past, been urging the Superintendant of my business at Mount Vernon  
to break a number of Steers to the yoke, that no set of Oxen may be worked low—but do not believe it is yet done to the extent I wish.  
My reasons for this measure are, that the Oxen may never be worked after they are eight  
years of age, but then fatted for marked; that by having a number of  
them, they may, by frequent shifting, always be in good order; and because, when they  
are only fed, when they do work—and at other times only partake of the fare which is  
allowed to the other Cattle, twenty yoke is not more expensive than five yoke.  
The Potatoes which were made last year, except such as you may require for your own  
eating, which you are welcome to, must all be preserved for Seed; &amp; will be short  
enough, I fear, for the purposes they are intended. It has been intimated that several  
of the large stone Jugs which were sent to the different farms with spirits in them at  
Harvest has never yet been returned. Call upon the several Overseers to give them in  
immediately, or they will have to pay for them. Enclosed is an Inventory of the several  
articles which are in the Store house at Mansion house which I send for your  
information—Take an account of what is delivered from thence—to whom—and for what  
purpose—that it may be known how things go.  
There is one thing I wish to impress you pretty strongly with, that you may use every  
precaution in your power to guard against—and that is—suffering my horses to be rode at  
unseasonable hours in the night without your knowledge or that of the Overseers—No doubt  
rests upon my mind that this is too much practiced and is one, if not the primary cause  
of my loosing a number of horses—the poverty of others—and the slinking of foals which  
happens so frequently that I make a miserable hand of breeding Mules. It must be  
remembered in time, that the Jacks and Stud horse are advertised for covering the  
ensuing Season—February or beginning of March; however, will be in time.  
I am told that the Well by the Quarter is rendered useless for want of a proper rope.  
It is sometime since I wrote to Mr Lewis to get a hair one (for none other answers well)  
from the rope maker in Alexandria—but what he has done in it I know not. He will be able to inform you; and he, and the Gardeners wife,  
will let you know what Negroes have been cloathed &amp; who are yet to Cloath, with the  
means of doing it.  
My Superfine, &amp; fine flour always waits for directions from me, to be sold; but the  
midlings &amp; Ship stuff you will dispose of whenever you can get a suitable price, and  
your want of money may require. And this also may be done with Beeves, Mutton &amp;ca;  
after supplying the several demands upon the former, where it has not  
already been done. The Miller and Thomas Green, I understand, have each had a Beef the  
weights of which will, I presum⟨e⟩ be given to you by Mr Lewis; and as it will exceed  
their allowance of this article they must account for it by lessening the quantity of  
Porke, or be charged the (Alexandria) market price for it. And as Thomas Green has drawn  
in the course of last year more Meal from my Mill than his allowance let him be charged  
with the Overplus and It is necessary you should know that he is always craving money  
and other things but let him no more than his dues—for he is in debt I believe to every  
body and what ever is advanced beyond would probably be lost.  
I have directed Mr Lewis to leave with you an Acct of all the money he has paid, &amp;  
what (if any) may remain in his hands. And it is my request that you will pay no Accts  
(not of your own contracting) without learning from him that they are due, or first  
sending them on to me; for Mr Whiting always paid as he went, &amp; what was left unpaid  
either by him, or contracted after his death, was paid to the utmost farthing whilst I  
was at home. So that I know of nothing remaining unpaid except the Overseers wages, and  
to the Weaver, but what has fallen under Mr Lewis’s management since I left home &amp;  
of course can be explained by him.  
Send me an exact account of the quantity of Corn made at each farm and the yield of  
each field. I directed Mr Lewis to have a certain quantity, at each farm put into  
seperate Corn houses for the use thereof; and the residue in other houses for the  
Mansion house, and other purposes—&amp; I hope it has  
been done, but wish to be informed. The keys of the last mentioned houses I did not  
intend should be left in the care of the Overseers, but the doors well secured and, the  
keys remain in your own custody.  
As your family may be the better accomodated by it, I wrote Mr Lewis sometime ago that  
you might lodge, yourself, in the room which he now occupies; and I repeat it to you, as I am willing to make your situation  
as comfortable as may be.  
It would be well to have the Seins overhauled immediately, that if new ones are  
wanting, or the old ones requiring much repair, they may be set about without loss of  
time; for if this work is delayed until the Spring the Sein Netters will be so much  
employed, as to disappoint you altogether &amp; of course my people of Fish. If twine is not to be had in Alexandria let me know it, and I will, by the first  
vessel afterwards send it from hence.  
If I recollect rightly, Thomas Green is allowed a certain quantity of Wood, by the  
agreement which has been entered into between us (by the old one I know it was so) it  
would be well therefore to have the quantity carried to his house and corded up at once,  
otherwise he will be always complaining, and denying that the quantity (Six cord I think  
it is) has been recd by him.  
I shall write to you if nothing extraordinary prevents it, by every Mondays Post, and  
shall expect a copy of the weekly reports by the Mail which leaves Alexandria on  
Thursday if no change has taken place—by which means I shall write to you, &amp; receive  
a letter from you every week when the occurrences (not contained in the reports) may be  
mentioned. And now, having given you my sentiments upon all those points with which my  
recollection has furnished me I have only to add that the enclosed letters (which are  
sent open for you to peruse &amp; then to put wafers in) will shew the person to whom  
they are directed what it is they have to expect, &amp; the ground they stand upon. Wishing you well I remain Your friend &amp;ca  
  
Go: Washingto

You will perceive by my agreement  
with Ehler, the Gardener, that he &amp; his  
wife were to eat of the Victuals that went  
from my Table (in the Cellar) instead of  
having it cooked by his wife as had been  
the custom with them. At the time that

Mrs. Fanny Washington, but as she has  
resolved to live in Alexandria, this will no

There is one thing I wish to impress  
you pretty strongly with, that you may use  
every precaution in your power to guard  
against, and that is—suffering my horses  
to be rode at unseasonable hours in the  
night without your knowledge or that of  
the Overseers. No doubt rests upon my  
mind that this is too much practiced and  
is one, if not the primary cause of my  
lousing a number of horses, the poverty  
of others, and the slinking of foals, which  
happens so frequently that I make a mis-  
erable hand of breeding mules....  
  
My superfine and fine flour always  
waits for directions from me to be sold ;  
but the midlings and ship stuff you will  
dispose of whenever you can get a suit-  
abie price, and your want of money may  
require—and this also may be done with  
Beeves, Mutton &amp;c, after supplying the  
several demands upon the former where  
it has not already been done....

Send me an exact account of the quan-  
tity of corn made at each farm and the  
yield of each field. I directed Mr. Lewis  
to have a certain quantity at each farm  
put into separate corn houses for the use  
thereof, and the residue at other houses  
for the Mansion house and other pur-  
poses, &amp; I hope it has been done, but  
wish to be informed. The keys of the  
last mentioned houses I did not intend  
should be left in the care of the Over-  
seers, but the doors well secured and the  
keys remain in your possession....  
  
It would be well to have the Seins  
overhauled immediately, that if the new  
ones are wanting or the old ones requir-  
ing much repair, they may be set about  
without loss of time ; for if this work is

dinary prevents it, by every Monday’s

Alexandria on Thursday if no change has  
taken place—by which means I shall  
write to you, &amp; receive a letter from you  
every week when the occurrences (not  
contained in the reports) may be men-  
tioned.—And now, having given you my  
sentiments upon all those points® with

Mr. Lewis was directed to leave with you) were designed to  
give you a general view of the business entrusted to your  
care.—I shall now, as intimated in that letter, give you my  
sentiments on many other matters of a more particular nat-  
ure.—  
  
Among the first things to be done after you are well fixed  
yourself, will be, I presume, that of taking an exact account  
of the Stock of every species—Tools—and implements on  
each of the farms :—charging them therewith ; that a regular  
account thereof may be rendered whenever called for.—Buy  
in Alexandria a proper (bound) book for this purpose, and  
another to enter the weekly reports in.—The latter is re-  
quired not only for my present satisfaction, but that it may  
also, at any time hereafter shew in what manner the hands  
have been employed; and the state of the Stock and other  
things at any past period; and it is my wish, as this is in-  
tended as a register of the proceedings on the farms, that they  
may be made with correctness ;—always comparing the last,  
with the preceeding weeks report and all differences satis-  
factorily accounted for.—The Overseers are allowed paper  
for these Reports. Suffer no excuse therefore for their not  
coming in to you every Saturday night, that you may be en-  
abled to forward a copy of them to me by the Wednesday’s  
Post following.—And as it is not only satisfactory, but may  
be of real utility, to know the state of the weather as to heat  
and cold, but drought or moisture; prefix, as usual, at the  
head of every Weeks report a Meteorological account of  
these ;—The Thermometer which is at Mount Vernon will °  
enable you to do the first.—  
  
The work essentially necessary to be done by my Carpen-  
ters, and which presses most—is—compleating the New Barn  
at Dogue Run, and the sheds there for horses &amp;c&#x27;—building  
the house for Crow—Repairing my house in Alexandria for  
Mrs. Fanny Washington—which must be done before the first

AND MOUNT VERNON. 19  
  
Yard.— Repairing the Millers house.—Removing the larger  
kind of the Negro quarters (the smaller ones or cabbins, I pre-  
sume the people with a little assistance of Carts can do them-  
selves) to the ground marked out for them opposite to Crow’s  
New house.—Repairing at a proper time those he will remove  
from.—Lending aid in drawing the houses at River farm into  
some uniform shape, in a convenient place.—Repairing the  
Barn and Stables at Muddy-hole.-—Compleating the Dormant  
Windows in the back of the Stable at Mansion house and  
putting two in the front of it agreeably to directions already  
given to Thomas Green—after which, and perhaps doing  
some other things which do not occur to me at this moment,  
my intention is to build a large Barn, and sheds for Stables  
upon the plan of that at Dogue Run (if, on trial it should be  
found to answer the expectation w™ is formed of it) at River  
Farm.—  
  
I give you this detail of Carpenters work, that by having  
the subject before you in a collected view, you may be the  
better able to direct the execution; and to prevent Green  
from flying from one thing to another without order or sys-  
tem ;—and Then by judging whether he carries it on with  
that dispatch and judgment which is necessary.  
  
As you know my anxiety with respect to the substitution  
of live fences in place of dead ones (as soon, and as fast as  
the nature of things will admit) I should not again mention  
it, were it not that this is the season for saving the Haws of  
the thorn—Berries from the Cedar trees—and such things  
as are fit for the purpose of hedging ;—and to prevent trim-  
ming the Lombardy Poplar and Willows, that the cuttings  
may be applied to this use—for as these two last are of very  
quick growth, I am of opinion fences might soon be raised  
by means of them, that will be competent against every thing  
but Hogs, whilst those of slower growth may be coming on  
to supply their places ;—and whether it is not better to raise  
Porke in styes, is a matter worthy of serious consideration—

for I believe by the common mode I never get the half of  
what is raised by the Sows; especially if they are kept in  
good order ;—to do which is attended with no small expence,  
and to have them stolen afterw“ is vexatious.  
  
When I left home, Davy at Muddy hole had finished get-

Corn and some fencing, to employ his people about, during  
the fall and Winter—I was induced from this consideration,  
and the anxious desire I have to reclaim, and lay to grass—  
my mill swamp, to order him to give all the aid he could to  
McKoy in the accomplishment of this work but it really ap-  
pears to me that the fall, fine as it has proved, has actually  
been spent About I know not what.—What can be done with  
those swamps, must now be left to you—and the state the  
weather will put them in.—My hope, and expectation once,  
was, that the second lot might have been laid to grass next  
spring if not this Fall, and that the one above it, would have  
been ditched—grubbed—and planted in Corn—but as the  
matter now stands, you must be governed by circumstances  
and your own view of the case; with this caution, not to  
undertake in this, or in any thing else, more than you can  
accomplish well ;—recollecting always, that a thing but half  
done is never done ;—and well done, is, in a manner done for  
ever.—  
  
At McKoys, I staked out two Clover lots adjoining the  
Barn yard, and gave him and Tom Davis (who was present)  
my ideas respecting them.—The sooner these can be in-  
closed—especially that on the West side, next the Wood—  
the better; as it is my wish to plough it this fall, and plant  
Potatoes therein in the Spring.—Serving that on the East  
side of the Barn in like manner next year—and the spot  
which was in oats, adjoining thereto the year following.—It  
is my intention also, to run a lane from the first Gate you  
enter going into this Farm up to the Barn yard—and another  
lane from the Wood to N° 4 across the Meadow, and between  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
AND MOUNT VERNON. 91  
  
fields N° 3 and 5.—I do not expect that all these things can  
be accomplished in a moment—but having them in your  
view at the same time you will know better how to pro-  
ceed.—As the Wood in N° 5 will be to be cleared when that \
field comes into Corn, it will be proper that all the Timber, :  
Rails and Wood that is wanted on the farm, should be taken  
from hence as far as it will go—and cut with an eye to this  
event.  
One of the Grass lots at Muddy hole, the South western  
one (pointed out to Davy) ought to be plowed up this fall,  
and planted with Potatoes in the Spring—And at Union  
farm it is intended to take of four five acre lots from field  
N° 2, directly in front of the Barn as will appear more clearly  
by the sketch herewith enclosed—The lots marked N° 1 and 2  
in which, should be sowed in Feb. 7, or beginning of March  
with clover seed on the Wheat.—At the River farm’ I pro-  
pose three lots for Grass, South of the lane in front of the  
Barn, as you will perceive by another sketch also enclosed.—  
What will be done with the ground between the Barn at that  
place and N° 6 when the fence comes to be run there, is  
left to yourself to decide, after taking a full view of things  
and seeing what the force is competent to in fencing (of  
which much is wanting) &amp;c&#x27;—Stuart wished much for an-  
other fellow at this place, and as that boy Cyrus, at Man-  
sion house, is now nearly a Man, and very unfit I believe  
to be entrusted with horses, whose feed, there is strong sus-  
picions he steals, I have no objection to your sending there—  
nor indeed have I any to your disposing of any of the others,  
differently from what they are, after you have taken time to  
consider what arrangements can be made for the best, and  
most advantageous purposes.—Thomas Davis and Muclus  
must however be considered as among the tradesmen; and  
when not employed in making and laying of Bricks and other

jobs in that way, may be aiding the Carpenters.—And the  
fellow called Muddy hole Will, as he has for many years  
been a kind of Overseer, had better remain in his present  
station ;—with respect to the rest, I have no choice about  
them.—  
  
There is nothing which stands in greater need of regula-  
tion than the Waggons and Carts at the Mansion House, which  
always whilst I was at home appeared to me to be most  
wretchedly employed—first in never carrying half a load ;—  
2*” in flying from one thing to another ;—and thirdly in no  
person seeming to know what they really did; and often times  
under pretence of doing this, that, and the other thing, did  
nothing at all ;—or what was tantamount to it.—that is—in-  
stead of bringing in, or carrying to any place, full loads, and  
so many of them in a day; the Waggon, or a Cart, under  
pretence of drawing Wood, or carrying Staves to the Mill’  
w&quot; go to the places from whence they were to be taken, and  
go to sleep perhaps; and return with not more than half a  
load.—Frequently have I seen a Cart go from the Mansion  
house, or from the river side to the new Barn with little or  
no more lime or sand in it, than a man would carry on his  
back—the consequence of this was that the Brick layers were  
half their time idle; for it required no more time to make  
the trip with a full load than it did with half a load—of  
course, double the q® would be transported under good reg-  
ulation.  
  
You will perceive by my agreem&#x27; with Ehler, the Gardener,  
that he and his wife were to eat of the Victuals that went  
from my Table (in the Cellar) instead of having it Cooked by  
his wife as had been the custom with them.—At the time  
that agreement was made I kept a Table for Mrs. Fanny  
Washington, but as she has resolved to live in Alexandria,  
this will no longer be kept up; and therefore it would be best

[ should conceive, to let them return to their old mode, and  
for the young Gardener to eat with them—but as the agree-  
ment is otherwise I would not force this upon them, unless  
it was their own choice—especially if Butler remains there,  
for in that case as Lucy (the Cook) must get Victuals for him,  
it will make but little difference whether she gets for one  
or more; you will therefore do what seems best, and most  
agreeable in this matter taking care that they have a suffi-  
ciency without waste, or misapplication—I am very willing  
to allow them enough, and of such provisions, day by day, as  
is wholesome and good, but no more—they have, each of  
them been allowed a bottle of Beer a day  
continued to them—that is a quart each, for when I am from  
home the Beer will not be bottled though it may be brewed  
as the occasion requires—The Gardener has too great a pro-  
pensity to drink, and behaves improperly when in liquor ;—  
  
and this must be  
  
  
  
admonish him against it as much as you can, as he behaves  
well when sober—understands his business—and I believe is  
not naturally idle—but only so when occasioned by drink—  
His wife has been put in charge of the spinners—that is, to  
deliver out the Wool and flax, and receive the thread, yarn  
&amp;c&#x27; ,—she seems well disposed, but how far she is worthy of  
trust, or is capable of having the work done properly, you  
will be better able to judge after a while, than I am now.—  
Method, in all these things, is desirable, and after it is once  
adopted, and got into a proper train things will work easy.—  
Do not suffer the Quarter Negro children to be in the  
Kitchen, or in the yards unless brought there on business—as  
besides the bad habit—they too frequently are breaking limbs,  
or twigs from, or doing other injury to my Shrubs—some of  
which at a considerable expence, have been propagated.&#x27;’—

From some complaints made by my Negroes, that they  
had not a sufficient allowance of meal, and from a willingness  
that they should have enough, the quantity was increased by  
Mr. Whiting so as to amount (by what I have learnt from  
Mr. Stuart) to profusion.—This is an error again on the other  
side—My wish and desire is that they should have as much  
as they can eat without waste and no more.—Under these  
Ideas I request you would examine into this matter and regu-  
late their allowance upon just principles.—I always used to  
lay in a great quantity of Fish for them—and when we were  
at home Meat, fat, and other things were now and then given  
to them besides:—But it would seem (from their acc at  
least) that the Fish which were laid in for them last spring  
have disappeared without their deriving much benefit from  
them.—  
  
By this time I expect the Hogs that were put up for Porke,  
either are killed—or are fit to kill.—I request, after every  
person has had their allowance given to them, that the residue  
may be made into Bacon, and due attention given to it; for  
all most every year, since we left home, half of it or more,  
has been spoilt—either for want of salt, or want of proper  
attention in smoking it; if not spoiled in the pickle-—Davy  
at Muddy hole, has always had two or three hund‘ weight of  
Porke given to him at killing time, and I believe the Insides  
of the Hogs—that is—the Hastlets, Guts (after the fat is  
stripped off) &amp;c&#x27; is given among the other Negroes at the  
different places.—  
  
After the drilled Wheat at Union farm? is taken off, let  
particular care be used to prevent its being mixed with any  
other ; as, if it answers the character given of it, it will be a  
great acquisition.—That, and the drilled wheat at Stuarts are  
of the same kind, and were sown in drills that the ground  
might be worked whilst it was growing, and the most made

of it that can be-—Whether to sow the ground which is at  
Union farm (in this Wheat) with Buck Wheat and grass  
Seeds immediately after harvest or with Buck Wheat alone  
to be plowed in for Manure and grass seeds afterwards ]  
shall leave to you to decide—I shall want all the ground  
within that Inclosure laid down with grass and leave the  
manner of doing it to you—-And as the other parts within  
the same Inclosure—as also in that of McKoys, was sown very  
late in the fall with grass seeds pray examine them atten-  
tively, from time to time, and if you shall be of opinion that  
the Seed is not come well, or is too thin, sprinkle as much  
more over it as you shall deem necessary, as I am very  
anxious to have them well taken, and without delay with  
grass.—The Wheat fields at Dogue-run are to be sown in the  
Month of February or March with grass Seeds—No. 3 with  
Clover alone—The other with Clover and Timothy or Clover  
and Orchard grass mixed, as it is intended to be laid to  
Grass.—  
  
It is indispensably necessary that the alteration marked  
out in the Mill Race should be accomplished as soon as pos-  
sible—1* because the waste of Water in the old part (which  
it avoids) is more than can be afforded except at times of the  
greatest plenty—and 2°% because I am at more expence and  
trouble in repairing (after every heavy rain) the breaches, in  
the part that will be thrown out, than in digging the new.—  
There is another job that is essential ; and that is, to make  
the Post and Rail fence from the Millers house up to the  
trunnel fence which runs across the meadow,—or to the next  
cross fence, if that lot is cultivated next year of such stout  
and strong materials and of such a height as to bid defiance  
to trespassers of every kind, among w® the worthless people  
who live near it are the worst as I am satisfied they give  
every aid in their power which can be done without discov-  
ery to let in their Hogs—The whole of this outer fence, will  
be, I am sure, to be done anew; but it can only be accom-

plished by degrees—but let that which is done, be com-  
pleated effectually as well by a good and sufficient ditch as by  
a stout Post and rail fence—along which if a hedge of Honey  
locust could be got to grow entirely round it would form a  
sufficient barrier against bad neighbours as they would hardly  
attempt to cut them down to let their Stock in upon me  
which, I am sure is the case at present as without the aids  
some of them derive from my Inclosures and their connexion  
with my Negroes they would be unable to live upon the  
iniserable land they oceupy.—  
  
Whenever the field N° 3 at Union farm is prepared for a  
Crop, which was intended to be the case next year—if the  
piece of Wood within, is touched at all, let there be a hand-  
some clump of trees left at the further end of it—or more  
than one—according to the shape and growth of the Wood.—  
  
I have, for years past, been urging the Superintendant of  
my business at Mount Vernon to break a number of Steers to  
the yoke, that no set of oxen may be worked low—but do  
not believe it is yet done to the extent I wish.—My reasons  
for this measure are, that the oxen may never be worked  
after they are eight years of age, but then fatted for market ;  
—that by having a number of them, they may, by frequent  
shifting, always be in good order ;—and because, when they  
are only fed, when they do work—and at other times only  
partake of the fare which is allowed to the other cattle,—  
twenty yoke is not more expensive than five yoke.—  
  
The Potatoes which were made last year, except such as  
you may require for your own eating, which you are weleome  
to, must all be preserved for Seed ; and will be short enough,  
I fear, for the purposes they are intended.—It has been in-  
timated that several of the large stone Jugs which were sent  
to the different farms with spirits in them at Harvest has  
never yet been returned.—Call upon the several Overseers to  
give them in immediately, or they will have to pay for them.

information.—Take an account of what is delivered from  
thence—to whom—and for what purpose—that it may be  
known how things go.—  
  
There is one thing I wish to impress you pretty strongly  
with, that you may use every precaution in your power to  
guard against—and that is—suffering my horses to be rode  
at unseasonable hours of the night without your knowledge  
or that of the Overseers.—No doubt rests upon my mind that  
this is too much practiced and is one, if not the primary cause  
of my loosing a number of horses—the poverty of others—and  
the slinking of foals which happens so frequently that I make  
a miserable hand of breeding Mules.—It must be remembered  
in time, that the Jack and Stud horse are advertised for cov-  
ering the ensuing Season—February or beginning of March,  
however, will be in time.—  
  
I am told that the Well by the Quarter is rendered useless  
for want of a proper rope.—It is sometime since I wrote to Mr.  
Lewis to get a hair one (for none other answers well) from  
the Rope Maker in Alexandria—but what he has done in it I  
know not.—He will be able to inform you; and he, and the  
Gardeners wife, will let you know what Negroes have been  
cloathed and who are yet to Cloath, with the means of doing  
it.—  
  
My Superfine, and fine flour always waits for directions  
from me, to be sold ;—but the midlings and Ship stuff you  
will dispose of whenever you can get a suitable price, and  
your want of money may require.—And this also may be  
done with Beeves, Mutton &amp;c’; after supplying the several  
demands upon the former, where it has not already been  
done.—The Miller and Thomas Green, I understand, have  
each had a Beef, the weights of which will, I presume be  
given to you by Mr. Lewis; and as it will exceed their allow-  
ance of this article, they must account for it by lessening the  
quantity of Porke, or be charged the (Alexandria) market

price for it—And as Thomas Green has drawn in the course  
of last year more Meal from my Mill than his allowance let  
him be charged with the Overplus and It is necessary you  
should know that he is always craving money and other  
things but let him no more than his dues—for he is in debt  
I believe to every body and whatever is advanced beyond  
would probably be lost.—  
  
I have directed Mr. Lewis to leave with you an acc’ of all  
the money he has paid, and what (if any) may remain in his  
hands.—And it is my request that you will pay no acc‘ (not  
of your own contracting) without learning from him that  
they are due, or first sending them on to me; for Mr.  
Whiting always paid as he went, and what was left unpaid  
either by him, or contracted after his death, was paid to the  
utmost farthing whilst I was at home.—So that I know of  
nothing remaining unpaid except the Overseers wages, and  
to the Weaver, but what has fallen under Mr. Lewis’s man-  
agement since I left home and of course can be explained by  
him.—  
  
Send me an exact account of the quantity of Corn made at  
each farm and the yield of each field.—I directed Mr. Lewis  
to have a certain quantity, at each farm put into seperate  
Corn houses for the use thereof; and the residue in other  
houses for the Mansion house, and other purposes—and |  
hope it has been done, but wish to be informed.—The Keys  
of the last mentioned houses I did not intend should be left in  
the care of the Overseers, but the doors well secured and, the  
keys remain in your own custody.—  
  
As your family may be the better accomodated by it, I  
wrote Mr. Lewis sometime ago that you might lodge, your-  
self, in the room which he now occupies; and I repeat it to  
you, as I am willing to make your situation as comfortable as  
  
may be.—  
It would be well to have the Seins overhauled immediately,  
that if new ones are wanting, or the old ones requiring much

this work is delayed until the spring the Sein Netters will be  
so much employed, as to disappoint you altogether and of  
course my people of Fish.—If twine is not to be had in Alex-

send it from hence.—  
  
If I recollect rightly, Thomas Green is allowed a certain  
quantity of Wood, by the agreement which has been entered  
into between us (by the old one I know it was so) it would be  
well therefore to have the quantity carried to his house and  
corded up at once, otherwise he will be always complaining,

I shall write to you if nothing extraordinary prevents it,  
by every Mondays Post, and shall expect a copy of the Weekly  
  
teports by the Mail which leaves Alexandria on Thursday if  
no change has taken place—by which means I shall write to  
you, and receive a letter from you every Week when the oc-  
currences (not contained in the reports) may be mentioned.—  
And now, having given you my sentiments upon all those  
points with which my recollection has furnished me I have  
only to add that the enclosed letters (which are sent open for  
you to peruse and then to put wafers in) will shew the person  
to whom they are directed what it is they have to expect, and  
the ground they stand upon.— Wishing you well I remain

‘**Do not suffer the Quarter Negro children to be  
in the Kitchen, or in the yards unless brought there  
on business—as besides the bad habit—they too fre-  
quently are breaking limbs or twigs from, or doing  
other injury to my shrubs, some of which, at a con-  
siderable expense, have been propagated.  
  
‘*From some complaints made by my Negroes,

amount (by what I have learned from Mr. Stuart)  
to profusion. This is an error again on the other  
side. My wish and desire is that they should have  
as much as they can eat without waste and no  
more. I always used to lay in a great  
quantity of Fish for them and when we were at home,  
meat, fat &amp; other things were now and then given  
to them besides; But it would seem (from their  
accounts at least) that the Fish which were laid in  
for them last Spring have disappeared without their  
deriving much benefit from them.  
  
‘* By this time I expect that the Hogs that were put  
up for porke either are killed, or are fit to kill. I  
request, after every person has had their allowance  
given to them, that the residue may be made into  
Bacon. . After the drilled wheat at Union farm  
is taken off let particular care be used to prevent its  
being mixed with any other. . . . [have for many  
years been urging the superintendent of my business  
at Mount Vernon to break a number of Steers to  
the Yoke that no set of Oxen may be worked low—  
but do not believe it is yet done to the extent I  
wish.
