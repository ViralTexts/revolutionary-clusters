ebeians and Hamilton was as much a Demagogue as Burr. An independent Executive to mediate between the two Parties, was wanting, and this defect was the ruin of the Republic, and will be of ours if Mr Hillhouses motion prevails. When Mr Hillhouse, declares, that “When a Citizen claims to be an Exclusive Patriot, and is very officious in proclaiming his own Merit, it is time for the People to be allarmed.” I agree with him. But I must Add When a Senator declaims against Executive Influence, under our Constitution, it is time for the People to be upon their guard against an Aristocratical Spirit and Preponderance.

.  
The Sixth Article of Mr Hillhouse’s Amendments reduces the Presidents office to a mere Doge of Venice, a mere head of Wood, a mere tool of the Aristocracy of the Country. He is to be appointed by Chance, from the most Aristocratical Branch, the Senate. Although the Senators in general have been respectable Men and Some of them illustrious for Virtues Talents, Experience and Services, Yet it  must be confessed that there have been very weak Men in that Body. These will have as good a Chance as the best, a Blount or a Burr as good a Chance as an Elsworth or a Strong or a Richard Henry Lee: But this is of less importance, than the Proposal to Submit all Nominations and Removals to the Senate and House of Representatives.

whether Mr Hillhouses Amendments of the Constitution will remedy or qualify the Evil? I think not. On the contrary it will aggravate the distemper and make it mutual. If the Government vibrates at present between Parties about once in twelve years, if you make the Elections annual, there will be a Chance of it vibrating every year, and you will have no Stability in Government at all. If that “Prince of the Power of the air” that “Fiend Party Spirit” can now “invade every Sphere,” if that Dæmon can pass the bounds of every State” and by will he be cast down to hurled headlong, flaming from the flaming etherial Sky to bottomless Perdition, there to dwell in adamantine Chains, when Elections become annual?

In a neat preface the son of the author* has very modestly  
exhibited the claims of the work to public regard. His father,  
having been six years in Persia for the sake of natural re-  
searches, was sent to America by Louis XVI, who was not  
only an amiable man and a mild monarch, but also a munif-  
icent patron of science. They, who persecuted and murder-  
ed him, were vandals as well, as regicides. ‘ Cursed be

“The sixth article (and seventh) of Mr. Hillhouse’s

mere Doge of Venice, a mere head of wood, a mere tool of  
the aristocracy of the country. He is to be appointed by  
chance from the most aristocratic branch —the Senate.  
Although the Senators in general have been respectable  
men, and some of them illustrious for virtues, talents, ex-  
perience and services, yet it must be confessed that there  
have been very weak men in that body. These will have  
as good a chance as the best. A Blount or a Burr as good

against adopting it, said that &quot;the years would be  
toe short for both Houses to go through with all  
these appointments and removals.&quot; He also said:  
The power of removal was never abused in the  
first twelve years, except perhaps in two instances  
and those removals were made at the earnest andre­  
peated solicitations of all the members of the House  
and one of the members of the Senate from New  
Hampshire, much against the inclination of the  
President. Representations of misconduct in office  
were made to the President, and probably credited  
by those members of Congress; but there is now  
reason to suspect that they were dictated by too  
much of a party spirit.  
Adams also wrote;  
An independent Executive to mediate between the  
two parties was wanting, and this defect was the  
ruin of the Roman republic, and will be of ours if  
Mr. Hillhouse&#x27;s motion prevails.  
&quot;When a Senator,&quot; wrote Adams in the same re­  
view, &quot;declaims against Executive influence under  
our Constitution it is time for the peeple to be on  
their guard against an aristocratical spirit and pre­  
ponderance.&quot; He added that he thought the Senat
