Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
Washington November 27 1800  
  
  
Compelled, by the habits of a long Life, and as well as by all the Principles of Society and Government which I could ever understand and believe, to consider the great Body of the People, as the Source of all legitimate Authority no less than of all efficient Power: it is impossible for me to receive this Address, from the immediate Representatives of the American People, at this time and in this place, without Emotions which it would be indecent improper to express, if any Language could convey them.  
May the Spirit, which animated the great Founder of this City, descend to future Generations, And may the Wisdom Magnanimity and Steadiness, which marked the Events of his public Life, be imitated in all Succeeding Ages.  
I thank you, Gentlemen for your Assurance that the judiciary System Shall receive your deliberate Attention.  
With you, Gentlemen, I Sincerely hope that the final result of the Negotiations, now pending with France, may prove as fortunate to our country, as they have been commenced with Sincerity and prosecuted with deliberation and caution.   
With you I cordially agree, that So long as a predatory War is carried on against our Commerce, We Should Sacrifice the Interest and disappoint the Expectations of our Constituents, Should We for a moment relax, that System of maritime defence, which has resulted in Such beneficial effect.—With you, I confidently believe that few Persons can be found within the United States, who do not Admit that a Navy, well organized, must constitute the natural and efficient defence of this Country against all foreign Hostility.  
Those who recollect the distress and danger to this country, in former periods, from the Want of Arms, must exult in the Assurance, from their Representatives, that We Shall Soon rival foreign Countries, not only in the number but in the quality of Arms, compleated from our own Manufactories.  
With you, Gentlemen I fully Agree, that the great increase of Revenue, is a proof, that the measures of maritime defence, were founded in Wisdom.—This Policy has raised Us, in the esteem of foreign Nations. That national Spirit, and those latent Ennergies, which had not been, and are not yet, fully known to any, were not entirely forgotten by those who had lived long enough to see, in former times their operations, and Some of their Effects. Our Fellow Citizens were undoubtedly prepared to meet every event, which national honor or national Security could render necessary. These it is to be hoped are secured at the cheapest and easiest rate. If not, they will be secured at more expence.  
I thank you Gentlemen for your Assurance that the various Subjects, recommended to your Consideration shall receive your deliberate Attention. No further Evidence is wanting to convince me, of the Zeal and Sincerity, with which the House of Representatives regard the public good.  
I pray You Gentlemen to Accept of my best Wishes for your health and Happiness.

- Wiuth you, Gentlemen, I sincerely hope  
that the final refalt of the negociations now  
“pending with France, may prove as fortu.  
nate to our country, as they have been com.  
menced with sincerity, and piofecuted with  
dcliberation and caution.  
With you I cordially agree, that so long  
as a predatory war s casiied on agaioft our  
(..omgnctcc, we shall facrifice the interest,  
and disappoint the expetations of our Con­  
fituents, thould we for a moment, relax  
that SYSTEM OF MARITIME DE.  
I&quot;I::.NCI‘;, which has resulted in luch bene­  
ficial cffe@ls. With you, 1 counfidently be-  
Incvc, that few peifons,. can be found with­  
-10 the United States, who donot admit, that  
- a NAVY, well or anzed, must conflituse  
the matural and e]fdeat&#x27;defeice of thus coun­  
try aganf all foreign Hostility, :  
. Thole who recolleét the distress-and dan­  
ger to this country, in former periods, from  
the want of arms, must exult in the assurance,  
from their Representatives, that. we shall  
soon rival foreign countries, not only in the  
Damber, but in the quality of arms, com­  
pleted from our own manufa@eries, ~  
W ith you, Gentlemen, I fully agree, that  
thegreat increale of Revenue, isa proofthat  
the measures of Maritime Defence, were  
founded in wildam. . This policy has raised  
s, in the eftecm of foreign nations. That  
national [pirit, and thole latent energies,  
which had not been, and are not yet sally  
known to any, were not eatirely forgotten  
by: thofc who had lived long enough 1o fee,  
io former times their eperation, 2nd some  
of iheir cffefls. - Our Fellow-Citizens were  
uandoubtedly prepared to meet every event,  
which national honor, or dational fecunty  
could render necessary. These, itis to be  
hoped, are secured at the cheapest and eaficft  
rate. ls not, they will be secured at more  
expence. PR O  
I thark you, Gentlemen, for your afluranée  
that the various fubjefls, recommended to  
your&#x27;confideration, shall receive your delib.  
erate aptention. No further evidence is  
wanting to convince me of the zeal and sin­  
cerity with which the House of Representa­  
tives regard the public good. - - _  
&#x27; I&#x27;pray&#x27;you, Gentlemen, to accept of my  
best withes for your healthand happiness,

Presidents Reply to tbe Answer of the  
House of Representatives.  
  
Mr Speaker, and  
  
Gentlemen of tiie Houfe of Representatives  
  
Compelled by the habits of a long lifei  
a well as by all the principle* of focie-  
Dy and government, which I could ever  
underfund and believe, to confider the  
M eat body of the people as the fource of  
all legitimate authority, nolefsthan of all  
efficient powers, it is impoffible for me to  
receive this addrefs from the immediate  
reprefentatives of the American people,  
at this time, and in this place, without  
emotions which it would be improper to  
exprefs, if any language could convey  
  
Vlay the fpirit which animated the  
great founder of this city, defcend to fu-  
ture generations, and may the wifdom,  
magnanimity and fteadinefs, which mark-  
ed the events of his public life, be imita-  
ted in all fucceeding ages.  
  
I thank you gentlemen, for your affu-  
rance, that the judiciary fyllem lhall re-  
ceive your deliberate attention.  
  
With vou, gentlemen, I lincercly hope,  
that tfie final refult of the negotiations  
now pending with France, may prove as  
&#x27; fortunate for our country, as they have  
been commenced with fincerity, and pro-  
fecuted with deliberation and caution.  
With you, I cordially agree*, that fo long  
as a predatory war is carried on • a-  
gainll our commerce, we ihould facrifice  
the interefts, and difappoint the expecla  
lions of our continue nts, (hould we for  
  
moment, relax that fyilem of maritime  
defence, which has refulted in fuch beni-  
ficial cHeds. With you, I confidently  
believe, that few perfons arc to be found  
within the United States, who do not ad-  
mit, that a navy well organized, mull  
conftitute the natural and efficient de-  
fence of this country, againfl all foreign  
hollility. .  
  
[I Thole who recoiled the diflrefs and  
p danger to this country, in former periods,  
M from the want of ai ms, mult exult in the  
|j affurance, from their reprefentatives,  
j| that we fliall dxm rival foreign countries,  
not only in the number, but in the quali-  
ty of the arms completed from our own  
manufactories.  
  
With you, gentlemen, I fully agree,  
that the great incrcafe of revenue, is a  
proof that the meafures of maritime de-  
fence were founded in wiklom. This po-  
1&#x27;tv has railed us in the elteem of foreign  
nations. That national fpirit, and thofe  
latent energies, which had not been, and  
are not yet fully known to any, were not  
entirely forgotten by thofe, who had liv-  
ed long enough to fee in former times,  
their operation, and fome of their effecls ;  
our fellow citizens were undoubtedly  
prepared to meet every event, which na-  
tional honor, or national fecurity could  
render neceffary. Thele it is to be ho-  
ped, arc fecured at the cheapen 1 and eafi-  
eft rate. If not, they will be Iecured at  
more expence.  
  
I thank you gentlemen, for your affu-  
rance, that the various fubjects recom-  
mended to your cor.fideration, fliall re-  
ceive your deliberate attention. No far-  
ther evidence is wanting to convince me  
of &#x27;he zeal and fincerity with which the  
houfe of reprefentatives regard the pub-  
lic good.  
  
I prav you, gentlemen, to accept of my  
belt willies for your health and happinefs.
