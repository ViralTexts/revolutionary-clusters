Dear Sir  
Paris Aug. 4. 1787.  
  
Since mine of the 16th. January I have been honoured by your favors of Apr. 24. and June 9. I am happy to find that the states have come so generally into the scheme of the Federal Convention, from which I am sure we shall see wise propositions. I confess I do not go as far in the reforms thought necessary as some of my correspondents in America; but if the Convention should adopt such propositions I shall suppose them necessary. My general plan would be to make the states one as to every thing connected with foreign nations, and several as to every thing purely domestic. But with all the imperfections of our present government, it is without comparison the best existing or that ever did exist. It’s greatest defect is the imperfect manner in which matters of commerce have been provided for. It has been so often said, as to be generally believed, that Congress have no power by the confederation to enforce any thing, e.g. contributions of money. It was not necessary to give them that power expressly; they have it by the law of nature. When two nations make a compact, there results to each a power of compelling the other to execute it. Compulsion was never so easy as in our case, where a single frigate would soon levy on the commerce of any state the deficiency of it’s contributions; nor more safe than in the hands of Congress which has always shewn that  it would wait, as it ought to do, to the last extremities before it would execute any of it’s powers which are disagreeable.—I think it very material to separate in the hands of Congress the Executive and Legislative powers, as the Judiciary already are in some degree. This I hope will be done. The want of it has been the source of more evil than we have ever experienced from any other cause. Nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous in a great assembly as the details of execution. The smallest trifle of th

Again, in his Jetter of 4th Aug. 1787, to E. Carrington, (2d vol.  
works, p. 103), It has been so often said as to be generally be-  
lieved that congress have no power, by the confederation, to  
enforce any thing, for example, contributions of money. It was  
not necessary to give them that power expressly, they have it  
by the law of nature. When two parties make a compact, there  
results to each a power of compelling the other to execute it.  
Compulsion was hever so easy as in our case, where a single  
frigate would soon levy on the commerce of our state, the defi-  
ciency of its contributions; nor more safe than in the hands of  
eongress, Which has always shown that it would wait, as it  
ought to do, to the last extremities, before it would exercise any  
of its powers, Which are disagreeable.’’—Thus, Mr. Jefferson  
himself acknowledges the power even of the confederation to  
employ the navy, to enforce its requisitions. How then could  
he, and how can you doubt the right of the present government  
to do the same?  
  
The act of 28th Feb. 1795, authorises the employment of the  
militia to execute the laws of the union—and the act of 3d  
March, 1807, the employment of the navy and army in alike  
case. I annex the last, and so much of the first as relates to  
the subject.  
  
“Sec. 2. And he it further enacted, That whenever the laws  
of the United States shall be opposed, or the execution t
