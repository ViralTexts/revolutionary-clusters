change of circumstances become impossible, or, if enforced, would produce a disproportion between the subject of the contract and it’s price which the parties did not contemplate at the time of the contract.  
The 2d question whether the judges are invested with exclusive authority to decide on the constitutionality of a law, has been heretofore a subject of consideration with me in the exercise of official duties. certainly there is not a word in the constitution which has given that power to them more than to the Executive or Legislative branches. questions of property, of character and of crime being ascribed to the judges, through a definite course of legal proceeding, laws involving such questions belong of course to them; and as they decide on them ultimately &amp; without appeal, they of course decide, for themselves, the constitutional validity of the law. on laws again prescribing executive action, &amp; to be administered by that branch ultimately and without appeal, the Executive must decide for themselves also, whether, under the constitution, they are valid or not. so also as to laws governing the proceedings of the legislature, that body must judge for itself the constitutionality of the law, &amp; equally without appeal or controul from it’s coordinate branches. and, in general, that branch which is to act ultimately, and without appeal, on any law, is the rightful expositor of the validity of the law, uncontrouled by the opinions of the other coordinate authorities. it may be said that contradictory decisions may arise in such case, and produce inconvenience. this is possible, and is a necessary failing in all human proceedings. yet the prudence of the public functionaries, and authority of public opinion will generally produce accomodation. such an instance of difference  occurred between the judges of England (in the time of Ld Holt) and the House of Commons. but the prudence of those bodies prevented inconvenience from it. so in the cases of Duane and of William Smith of S. Carolina, whose characters of citizenship stood precisely on the same ground, the judges in a question of meum and tuum which came before them, decided that Duane was not a citizen; and in a question of membership the House of Representatives under the same words of the same provision adjudged William Smith to be a citizen. yet no inconvenience has ensued these contradictory decisions. this is what I believe myself to be sound. but there is another opinion entertained by some men of such judgment &amp;  information as to lessen my confidence in my own. that is, that the legislature alone is the exclusive expounder of the sense of the constitution in every part of it whatever. and they alledge in it’s support that this branch has authority, to impeach and punish a member of either of the others acting contrary to it’s declaration of the sense of the constitution. it may indeed be answered that an act may still be valid altho’ the party is punished for it, right or wrong. however this opinion which ascribes exclusive exposition to the legislature merits respect for it’s safety, there being in the body of the nation a controul over them, which, if expressed by rejection on the subsequent exercise of their elective franchise, enlists public opinion against their exposition, and encourages  a future judge or Executive on a future occasion to adhere to their former opinion. between these two doctrines, every one has a right to chuse; and I know of no third meriting any respect.

interpretation we put on it be true, the  
Supreme Court has merely uttered a  
speculative opinion, no more binding  
in law than it is in reason and in the  
great principles of humanity.  
  
“The second question, whether the judges  
are invested with exclusive authority to decide  
on the constitutionality of a law, has been here-  
tofore a subject of consideration with me in  
the exercise of official duties. Certainly, there  
is not a word in the constitution which has  
given that power to them, more than to the  
executive or legislative branches. Questions  
of property, of character, and crime, being  
ascribed to the judges, through a definite  
course of legal proceeding, laws involving  
such questions belong, of course, to them;  
and, as they decide on them ultimately and  
without appeal, they, of course, decide for  
themselves. The constitutional validity of  
the law or laws, again, prescribing executive  
action, and to be administered by that branch  
ultimately and without appeal, the executive  
must decide for themselves, also, whether,  
under the constitution, they are valid or not.  
So, also, as to laws governing the proceedings  
of the legislature, that body must judge tor  
itself the constitutionality of the law, and  
equally without appeal or control for its codr-  
dinate branches; and, in general, that branch,  
which is to act ultimately and without appeal  
on any law, is the rightful expositor of the  
validity of the law, uncontrolled by the opini-  
ons of the other codrdinate authorities. It  
may be said that contradictory decisions may  
arise in such case, and produce inconvenience.  
This is possible, and is a necessary failing in  
all human proceedings. Yet, the prudence  
of the public functionaries, and the authority  
of public opinion, will generally produce ac-  
commodation. Such an instance of indiffer-  
ence occurred between the judges of England  
(in the time of Lord Holt) and the House of

Commons; but the prudence of those bodies  
prevented inconvenience from it. So in the  
cases of Duane, and of William Smith, of  
South Carolina, whose characters of citizen-  
ship stood precisely on the same ground, the  
judges, in @ uestion of meum and tuum  
which came before them, decided that Duane  
was not a citizen; and, in a question of mem-  
bership, the House of Representatives, under  
the same words of the same provision, adjudged  
William Smith to be a citizen. Yet no incon-  
venience has ensued from these contradictory  
decisions. ‘This is what I believe, myself, to  
be sound. But there is another opinion enter-  
tained by some men of such judgment and  
information as to lessen my confidence in my  
own. That is, that the legislature alone is the  
exclusive expounder of the sense of the consti-  
tution, in every part of it whatever. And they  
allege, in its support, that this branch has  
authority to impeach and punish a member  
of either of the others, acting contrary to its  
declaration of the sense of the constitution.  
It may, indeed, be answered, that an act may  
still be valid, although the party is punished  
for it, right or wrong. However, this opinion,  
which ascribes exclusive exposition to the  
legislature, merits respect for its safety, there  
being in the body of the nation a control over  
them, which, if expressed by rejection, on the  
subsequent exercise of their elective franchise,  
enlists public opinion against their exposition,  
and encourages a judge or executive on a  
future occasion, to adhere to their former  
opinion. Between these two doctrines, every  
one has a right to choose, and I know of no  
third meriting any respect.  
  
“Thave thus, sir, frankly, without the honor  
of your acquaintance, confided to you my  
opinion.”  
  
That the federal judiciary was not at  
all consonant with the views of Mr. Jef-  
ferson will be evident from the followin

Jefferson, the founder of the States Righta  
Democracy, tho present l&gt;isun&#x27;on party, wii.  
tins to Mr. W. H.Torrance, June II, 1815,  
aays:  
  
The second question, whether the judges are in-  
  
vceiea v. ith exclusive authority to Uccicle on i tie  
constitutionality of a law, has been heretofore i  
Mibject of consideration with me in the exercise  
of official duties. Certainly there is not a word im  
the Constitution which h&#x27;u yieen that poitrr t„ th&gt; &gt;,&lt;  
more than to the Krecutipe or fspislatirt brutn-lot.  
Questions of property, of character, and of crime,  
being ascribed to the judges through a definite  
course of legal proceeding, laws involving such  
questions, belong, of eourw, to them; and as they  
decide on them ultimately, and without appeal,  
they, of course, decide for themselvts. The con-  
stitutional validity of the law or laws npiin pre-  
scribing executive action, and tn be adininistcnd  
by that branch ultimately, and wi: hout appeal,  
the Kxecutive mu«t decide for thmselt&#x27;es, also,  
whether, under the Constitution, they are valid  
or not. So ulso, at to laws governing the vroce*t ! -  
ings of the Legislature, that body must judge for  
itself the constitutionality of the law, attd rtfu&#x27;alf//  
tcithout append or control from iu co-ordinu&#x27;r  
branches. And, in ok.nkral, the BBAHCll  
  
WHICH O) TO ACT Cl.TIM ITKLY, AVDWRfKM I M
