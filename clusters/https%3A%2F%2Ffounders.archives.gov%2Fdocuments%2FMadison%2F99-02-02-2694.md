1787) a Supreme National Government, with a Supreme Executive, a Supreme Legislature, and a Supreme Judiciary, and a power

suited they were to the needs of the country,  
and urged all present to join in setting up a  
strong national government. As a plan of such  
a government, he read fifteen resolutions which  
the Virginia delegate had framed while waiting  
for the convention to assemble.  
  
This, which came in time to be known as  
the Virginia plan, provided that there should  
be a national executive, a national legislature,  
a national judiciary and council of revision ;  
that the executive should be chosen by the  
legislature and be ineligible a second time ;  
that the legislature should consist of two  
branches, with power to coerce refractory States  
and veto all State laws contrary to the Articles  
of Union; that the people should choose the  
members of the first branch; that the first  
branch should choose the members of the  
second from men nominated by the legisla-

ment the power to negative State laws. Indeed,  
some months before the Convention met, Madison,  
who was one of the strongest supporters of this  
power, wrote to two of his correspondents in ad  
vocacy of such a provision. Charles Pinckney was  
also strongly in favor of it, and his speeches show  
that his draft of a constitution gave to Congress  
a negative upon all such legislation of each State  
as to the Federal Legislature should seem im  
proper. The sixth resolution of the Virginia Plan  
also proposed to confer power upon the National  
Legislature &quot;to negative all laws passed by the  
several States contravening, in the opinion of the  
National Legislature, the articles of Union, or any  
treaty subsisting under the authority of the  
Union.&quot; This proposal was actually approved  
by the Convention on May 31. On June 8 Charles  
Pinckney and Madison moved to insert &quot;to noga­

improper&quot; instead of the language which  
had been adopted. There was some memor­
