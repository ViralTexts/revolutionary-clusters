There is a deep vein of humor in all  
this. Jefferson certainly never ad­  
vocated fiat paper money, the demon­  
etization of silver, free trade or the  
single tax. Of all these vagaries he  
was innocent. Jefferson was a bril­  
liant man, but at the same time a  
practical, sane man. One extract  
from his writings will suffice to show  
how his name is taken in vain. When  
the Jeffersonian George pronounces  
for absolute free trade, he should read  
these words of the master:  
  
“Experience has taught me that  
manufactures are as necessary to our  
independence as to our comfort. The  
duties we lay on all articles of foreign  
manufacture which prudence requires  
us to establish at home, with the pa­  
triotic determination of every good  
citizen to use no foreign article which  
can be made at home, secures us

ency.’’—Tacoma News (dem.)  
  
A Populist Opinion.  
  
It is to say the least remarkable how  
many of Rogers’ appointees have re­
