					I have receiv’d your letter of the 14. containing a very interesting view of the late treaty with Spain, and of the proceedings respecting it here. If the occurrence involvd in it nothing more, than a question between the U States &amp; Spain, or between them &amp; the Colonies, I should entirely concur in your view of the subject. I am satisfied, that we might, regulate it, in every circumstance, as we thought just, &amp; without war. that we might take Florida as an indemnity, and Texas for some trifle as an equivalent. Spain must soon be expelled from this continent, and with any new govt which may be form’d in Mexico, it would be easy to arrange the boundary in the wilderness, so as to include as much territory on our side as we might desire. No European power could prevent this, if so disposed. But the difficulty does not proceed from these sources. It is altogether internal, and of the most distressing nature and dangerous tendency. You were apprized by me, on your return from Europe, of the true character, of the negotiation, which took place in 1785.6. with the minister of Spain, for shutting up the mouth of the Mississippi, a knowledge of which might have been deriv’d in part from the secret journal of Congress, which then came into your hands. That, was not a question, with Spain, in reality, but one among ourselves, in which, her pretentions were brought forward, in aid of the policy, of the party at the head of that project. It was an effort to give such a shape to our union, as would secure the dominion over it, to its eastern section. It was expected that dismemberment by the Alleghenes Allegheney mountains, would follow the occlusion of the river, if it was not desird, tho’ the latter was then &amp; still is my opinion. The union then consisted of eight navigating &amp; commercial States, with five productive, holding slaves; and had the river been shut up, and dismemberment ensued, the division would always have been the same. At that time Boston ruled the four New England States, and a popular orator in Faneuil hall, ruled Boston, Jays object was to make N. York a New England State, which he avowed on his return from Europe, to the dissatisfaction of many in that State, whose prejudices had been excited, in the revolutionary war by the contest between N York &amp; those States respecting interfering grants in Vermont. It was forseen by these persons, that if the Mississippi should be opend, and new States be establishd on its waters, the population would be drawn thither, the number of productive States be proportionably encreased, &amp; their hope of dominion, on that contracted sectional scale, be destroyed. It was to prevent this that that project was formed. Happily it failed, &amp; since then, our career, in an opposite direction, has been rapid &amp; wonderful. The river has been opend, &amp; all the territory dependant on it acquir’d; eight States have already been admitted into the Union, in that quarter; a 9th is on the point of entering, &amp; a 10th provided for, exclusive of Florida. This march to greatness, has been Seen with profound regret, by those, in the policy suggested, but it has been impelled by causes over which they have had no controul. Several attempts have been made to impede it, among which, the Hartford convention in the late war, and the proposition for restricting Missouri, are the most distinguished. The latter measure contemplated, an arrangment on the distinction solely, between slave holding and non:slave holding states, presuming that on that basis only, such a division might be formd, as would destroy, by perpetual excitment, the usual effects proceeding from difference in climate, the produce of the soil, the pursuits &amp; circumstances of the people, &amp; marshall the States differing in that circumstance, in unceasing opposition, &amp; hostility with each other.  
					To what account, this project, had it succeeded, to the extent contemplated, might have been turn’d, I cannot say. Certain however it is, that since 1786., I have not seen, so violent &amp; persevering a struggle, and on the part of some of the leaders in the project, for a purpose so unmasked &amp; dangerous. They did not hesitate to avow that it was a contest for power, only, disclaiming the pretext of liberty humanity &amp;c. It was also manifest, that they were willing to risk the union, on the measure, if indeed, as in that, relating to the Mississippi, dismemberment, was not the principal object. You know how this affair terminated, as I presume you likewise do, that complete success, was prevented, by the patriotic devotion, of several members in the non slave holding states, who preferr’d the sacrifice of themselves at home, to a violation of the obvious principles of the constitution, &amp; the risk of the union. I am satisfied that the arrangment made, was most auspicious for the union, since had the conflict been pursued, there is reason to believe that the worst consequences would have followed. The excitment would have been kept up, during which it seemd probable, that the slave holding states would have lost ground daily. By putting a stop to the proceeding, time has been given for the passions to subside, &amp; for calm discussion &amp; reflection, which have never failed to produce their proper effect in our country. Such too was the nature of the controversy, that it seem’d to be hasardous, for either party to gain a complete triumph. I never doubted the right of Congress, to make such a regulation in territories, tho’ I did not expect that it would ever have been exercised.  
					From this view, it is evident, that the further acquisition, of territory, to the west &amp; South, involves difficulties, of an internal nature, which menace the union itself. we ought therefore to be cautious in making the attempt. Having securd the Mississippi, and all all its waters, with a slight exception only, and erected states there, ought we not to be satisfied, so far at least, as to take no step in that direction, which is not approved, by all the members, or at least a majority of those who accomplished our revolution? I could go into further details had I time. I have thought that these might afford you some satisfaction. when we meet in albemarle we will communicate further on the subject.

&quot;Dear Sir: I have received your letter of the  
11th, containing a very interesting view of the  
late treaty with Spain, and of the proceedings re­  
specting it here. If the occurrence involved in  
it nothing more than a question between the Uni­  
ted States and Spain, or between them and the  
colonies, I should entirely concur in your view ol  
the subject; 1 am satisfied, that we might regulate  
it, in every circumstance, as wc thought just, and  
without war; that we might take Florida as an  
indemnity, and Texas for some trifle as an equi­  
valent. Spain must soon be expelled from this  
continent; and with any new Government that  
may be formed in Mexico, it would be easy to  
arrange the boundary in the wilderness, so as to  
include as much lerr-.fory on our side as we might  
desire. No European.power could prevent this,  
if so disposed. But the difficulty does not pro­  
ceed from these sourcts. it is altogether internal,  
and of the most distressing nature and danger­  
ous tendency. You were appjised by me, on your  
return from Europe, ot the true character of the  
negotiation, which took place in ITtfo-&#x27;ii with the  
Minister of Spain, for stunting up the month of  
the Mississippi, a knowledge of which might  
have been derived in part from the secret journal  
ol Congress, which then canjc into your hands.  
That was not a question with Spain in reality,  
but one among ourselves, in which her preten­  
sions were brought forward in aid of the policy  
of the party at the head of that project. It was  
an effort to give such a shape to our Union as  
would secure the dominion over it to its Eastern  
section. It was expected that dismemberment by  
the Allegheny mountains would follow the ex­  
clusion of the river, if it was not desired, though  
the latter was then, and still is, my opinion. The  
Union then consisted of eight navigating and  
commercial States, with tire productive, holding  
slaves; and had the river been shut up, and dis­  
memberment ensued, the division would always  
have been the same.  
&quot;At that time, Boston ruled the four New En­  
gland States; and a popular orator in Faneuil  
Hall ruled Boston. Jay&#x27;sobject was to make New  
York a New England State, which he avowed  
on his return from Europe, to the dissatisfaction  
of many in that State, whose prejudices had been  
excited in the revolutionary war by the contest  
between New York and those Stales respecting  
interfering grants in Vermont. It was foreseen  
by those persons that if the Mississippi should be  
opened, and new .Slates lie established on its  
waters, the population would be drawn thither,  
the number ol productive Stales be proporliona­  
bly increased, and their hope of dominion on that  
contracted sectional scale lie destroyed. It was to  
prevent this that that project was formed. Hap­  
pily it failed; and since then our career, in  
an opposite direction, has been rapid and won­  
derful.  
  
I he river has been opened, and all the territo­  
ry dependent on it acquired; eight States have  
already been admitted into the Union in that  
quarter; a ninth is on the point ol* entering, and a  
tenth provided for, exclusive of Florida. This  
inarch to greatness has been seen with profound  
regret by those in the policy suggested; but it has  
!&gt;een impelled by causes over which they have j  
had no control. Several attempts have been made  
to impede it; among which, the Hartford Con­  
vention in the late war, and the proposition for  
restricting Missouri, are the most distinguished. !  
The latter measure contemplate*! an arrange­  
ment, on the distinction solely between slave- i  
holding and non-slaveholding States, presuming !  
that, on that basis only, such a division might lie |  
lotinded as would destroy, by perjielual excite-1  
inent, the usual effects proceeding from differ- &gt;  
ence in climate, the produce of the soil, the pur- !  
suits and circumstances of the people, and inar- j  
shal the States, differing in that circumstance, in &#x27;  
unceasing opposition and hostility to each other, j  
To what account this project, hail it succeeded to i  
the extent contemplated, might have been turned, i  
I cannot say. Certain, however, it is, that, since  
178(5, 1 have not seen so violent and persevering :  
a snuggle, and, on the pail of some of the ;  
leaders in the project, for a purpose so nn- |  
masked and dangerous. They did not hesi- :  
tate to avow that it was a contest for pow­  
er only, disclaiming the pretext of libeity,  
humanity, &amp;c. It was also manifest, that  
they were willing to risk the Union on the  
measure?if, indeed, as in lhat relating to the  
Mississippi, dismemberment was not the princi­  
pal objcct. You know how the affair terminated  
?as I presume you likewise do, that complete I  
success was prevented by the patriotic devotion of  
several members in the non-slaveholding States,  
who preferred the sacrifice of themselves at home  
to a violation of the obvious principles of the Con­  
stitution, and the risk of the Union. 1 am satis­  
fied that the arrangement made was most auspi­  
cious lor the Union; since, had the contlict been  
pursued, there is reason to believe that the worst  
consequences would have followed. The excite­  
ment would have been kept up, during which it  
seemed probabte that the slavelvolding Stales  
would have lost ground daily. By putting a stop  
to the proceeding, time has been given for the  
passions to subside, andlorcalin discussion and  
reflection, which have never failed to produce  
their proper ellect in our country. Such, loo,  
was the nature of the controversy, that it seemed  
to be hazardous for either party to gain a com­  
plete triumph. 1 never doubled the right of Con­  
gress to make such a regulation in territories,  
though I did not expcct that it would CVci&#x27; nave  
been exercised.  
&quot;From this view, it is evident, that the further  
acquisition of territory to the West and South, in­  
volves difficulties of an internal nature, which  
menace the Union itself. We ought, therefore, to  
be cautious in making the aiiempt. Having se­

ready been admitted into the Union in that quar-  
ler; a ninth is on the point of entering, aud a  
tenth provided for, exciusive of Florida. Thi  
marcel to greatness has been seen with profound  
regret by those in the policy suggested ; out it has  
been impelled by causes over which they have  
had nocontrol. Several attempts have been made  
|to impede it; among which the Hartford Con-  
vention in the Jate war, and the proposition for  
restricting Missouri, are the most distinguished.  
| The latter measure contemplated an arrange-  
|} ment on the distinction solely between slave-  
holding and non-slaveholding States, presuming  
that, on that basis unly, such a division m@ht be  
founded as would destroy, by perpetual excite-  
ment, the usual effects proceeding from differ-  
ence in climate, the produce of the soil, the pur-  
Suits and circumstances of the people; and mar-  
shal the States, ditfering to that circumstance, in  
unceasing opposition and hostility to each other.  
To what account this project, had it succeeded  
to the extent contemplated, might have been  
turned, I cannot say. Certain, however, it is,  
that since 1786 I have not seen so violent and  
persevering a struggle, and, on the part of some  
of the leaders in the project, for a purpose so  
unmasked and dangerous. ‘They did not hesitate  
to avow that it was a contest for power only,  
disclaiming the pretext of liberty, humanity, &amp;c.  
It was always manifest that they were willing to  
risk the Union on the measure, if, indeed, as in  
that relating to the Mississippi, dismemberment  
was not the principal object. * ty
