I hope you will see these intrusions on your time to be, what they really are, proofs of my great respect for you. I tolerate with the utmost latitude the right of others to differ from me in opinion without imputing to them criminality. I know too well the weakness &amp; uncertainty of human reason to wonder at it’s different results. both of our political parties, at least the honest portion of them, agree conscientiously in the same object, the public good: but they differ essentially in what they deem the means of promoting that good. one side believes it best done by one composition of the governing powers. the other by a different one. one fears most the ignorance of the people: the other the selfishness of rulers independant of them. which is right, time &amp; experience will prove. we think that one side of this experiment has been long enough tried, and proved not to promote the good of the many: &amp; that the other has not been fairly and sufficiently tried. our opponents think the reverse. with whichever opinion the body of the nation concurs, that must prevail. my anxieties on the subject will never carry me beyond the use of fair &amp; honorable means, of truth and reason: nor have they ever lessened my esteem for moral worth, nor alienated my affections from a single friend, who did not first withdraw himself. wherever this has happened I confess I have not been insensible to it: yet have ever kept myself open to a return of their justice.    I conclude with sincere prayers for your health &amp; happiness that yourself &amp; mr Adams may long enjoy the tranquility you desire and merit, and see, in the prosperity of your family, what is the consummation of the last and warmest of human wishes.

at least the honest part of them, agree conscientiously in the same object—  
the public good ; but they differ essentially in what they deem the means  
of promoting that good. One side believesit best done by one composition

that one side of this experiment bas been long enough tried, and proved  
not to promote the good of the many; and that the other has not been

** Our opponents think the reverse. With whichever opinion the body

self. Whenever this has happened, I confess I have not been insensible to it :

## Senator HILL is testifying his respect for the memory of JEFFERSON, by publishing garbled quotations from his writings, and twisting from them sentiments which, as he asserts, correspond precisely with those entertained by Gen. Jackson; whereupon he comes to the conclusion, that the "greatest and best" can be nothing more nor less than a second Jefferson, and that "the similitude between their administrations, seems to be almost perfect throughout"
