But if this was the Object of the Restraint, it may be asked why it was not confined to such enumerated articles as were of the Growth or Production of her own Islands; instead of being so extended, as to comprehend, all molasses, Sugar, Coffee, Cocoa, &amp; Cotton, including even the Cotton of the growth of our own Country. It is very possible that the Circumstance of our native Cotton’s becoming an article of Export to foreign Markets might not have occured to our negotiator. This would be the less extraordinary, as heretofore it has not been cultivated except in a [very] limited degree, and as an article of export rather, in the manner of Experiment than otherwise, and as moreover, from the Expence and Difficulty of separating the Seeds from the Cotton, we have been [hardly] able hitherto, to class Cotton among our Exports. It’s cultivation is said latterly to have become an object of attention in Georgia, &amp; South Carolina—still however it cannot yet be considered as a staple commodity. But from the recent Invention of an ingenious, &amp; simple, Machine, for ginning Cotton, It is hoped that the cultivation may be extended, so that not only our own Domestic manufactures may be relieved from a Dependence on foreign Supply, but the catalogue of our valuable Exports inriched by the addition of this inestimable production.

y in such manner as would afford an adequate guard against material evasions.]  
But though the conduct of the Senate in with-holding their assent to this article, is conceived to have been upon the whole well judged and wise, yet there were not wanting reasons of real weight to induce our negotiator to agree to it as it stands.  
The inviolability of the principles of the navigation act had become a kind of axiom incorporated in the habits of thinking of the British government and nation. Precedent, it is known, has great influence as well upon the councils as upon the popular opinions of nations!—and there is perhaps no country in which it has greater force than that of Great Britain. The precedent of a serious and unequivocal innovation upon the system of the navigation act dissolved as it were the spell, by which the Public prejudices had been chained to it. It took away a mighty argument derived from the past inflexibility of the system, and laid the foundation for greater inroads upon opinion for further and greater innovations in practice. It served to strip the question of every thing that was artificial and to bring it to the simple test of real national interest, to be decided by that best of all arbiters, experience.  
It may upon this ground be strongly argued that the precedent of the privilege gained was of more importance than its immediate extent—an argument certainly of real weight and which is sufficient to incline candid men to view the motives that governed our negotiator in this particular, with favor, and the opinion to which he yielded with respect. It is perhaps not unimportant, by way of precedent that the article, tho’ not established, is found in the treaty.  
Though the XII. article so far as respects the Terms and conditions of the Trade to the British Islands forms no part of the Treaty, having been excepted, and made the Subject of further negotiation, it may nevertheless be useful to take notice of some of the many ill founded Objections that have been made against it. Of this character is that which asserts that the Catalogue of articles permitted to be carried by us to the British Islands, may be abridged, at the pleasure of Great Britain, and so the trade may be annihilated.  
The article stipulates that we may carry to any of his majesty’s Islands and Ports in the west Indies from the United States in american vessels not exceeding Seventy Tons, any Goods or merchandizes, “being of the Growth manufacture or Production of the said States, which it is, Or may be, lawful to carry to the said Islands from the said States in british Vessels”—not all such articles as it is, &amp; May be, lawful to carry; but in the disjunctive, all such as it is, or may be lawful to carry; in other words, all such articles as it is now lawful to carry, together with such others, as hereafter it may be lawful to carry: the Catalogue may be enlarged, but cannot be diminished. [It may also be remarked incidentally that this objection sounds ill in the mouths of those who maintain the essentiality of the supplies of this Country under all possible circumstances to the British West Indies; for if this position be true there never can be reasonable groun

The article has been further criticised, on account of the adjustment of the impost and tonnage Duties payable in this Trade, and it has been attempted to be shewn that the Footing, on which we were to share in the same, would on this account be disadvantageous and the competition unequal. What is this adjustment? The Article proposed that British vessels employed in this Trade shall pay on entering our Ports the alien Tonnage Duty payable by all foreign Vessels, which is now Fifty Cents per Ton; further, the Cargoes imported in british Bottoms from the british west Indies shall pay in our Ports the same impost, or Duties, that shall be payable on the like articles imported in american Bottoms; and on the other Side, that Cargoes imported into the British Islands in american Bottoms shall pay the same impost or Duties that shall be payable on the like articles imported in British Bottoms—that is to say the Cargoes of Each, shall pay in the Ports of the other, only native Duties, it being understood that those imposed in the british west Indies on our Productions are small and unimportant, while those imposed in our Ports on the productions of the west Indies are high, and important to our Revenue. The vessels of each shall pay in the ports of the other, an equal alien Tonnage Duty and our Standard is adopted as the common Rule.  
Is not this equal? Can we expect, or ask, that british vessels should pay an alien Tonnage Duty in our ports, and that american vessels should enter their ports freely, or on payment only of native Tonnage Duties? can we in equity require them to pay on the importation of their Cargoes in British Vessels, an addition of ten per Cent on the Duties payable on the importation of the like articles in american Vessels, and at the same Time, demand to pay no higher or other Duties on the Cargoes carried in our Vessels to the British Islands, than those payable by them on the like articles imported in British Vessels? The very stating of the Question suggests to a candid mind, an answer that demonstrates the injustice of the Objection. [To expect more were to expect that in a Trade in which the opinions and practices of Europe contemplate every privilege granted to a foreign nation as a favour—we were by Treaty to secure a greater advantage to ourselves, than would be enjoyed by the Nation which granted the privilege.] But it is added that our Laws impose a Tonnage Duty of six Cents per Ton on the entry of american vessels engaged in foreign Trade, and it is not known that british Vessels pay any Tonnage Duty on their Entry in their Ports in the West-Indies, and so uniting the two entries, that is the entry in the west Indies and the entry on a return to our Ports, an american vessel will pay Fifty Six Cents per Ton, when the British vessel will pay only Fifty Cents per Ton. If the British Government impose no tonnage Duty on their own Vessels, and we do impose a Tonnage Duty on ours, this certainly cannot form an Objection against them. They are as free to abstain from the imposition of a Tonnage Duty on their own Ships, as we are to impose one on ours. If their policy is wiser than ours in this respect, we are at liberty to adopt it by repealing the Tonnage Duty levied on american navigation [which if we please may be confined to the particular case;] the effect of such a measure [as far as it should extend] tho the Duty is small, would be to add a proportional advantage to our Shipping in foreign competition. But the object of the Article in this particular, is to equalize not the Duties that each may choose to impose on their own Vessels, but those that they shall impose on the Vessels of each other; and in this Respect the Article is perfectly equal. [It is perhaps the first time that the question of inequality was founded on a circumstance depending on the laws of the party affected by it and removeable at his own option.]  
This view of the Subject authorises a Belief that in the revision of the article, a modification of it may be agreed [to], that will prove satisfactory. Indeed from the short duration of the article taken in connexion with the Expressions made use of towards the close of it, relative to the renewal of the Negotiation for the purpose of such further Arrangements as shall conduce to the mutual advantage, and Extension, of this Branch of commerce, we may infer that Great Britain contemplates a more enlarged, and equal adjustment on this Point.  
The Relaxations which now exist in the colonial Systems, in consequence of the necessities of the War, and which will change to our Disadvantage, with the return of Peace, have been considered by some as the permanent State of things. And this Error has had its influence in misleading the public in respect to the Terms &amp; Conditions in which we may reasonably expect to participate in the Trade to the British west Indies. But let it be remembered that the Restoration of Peace will bring with it a Restoration of the Laws of limitation, &amp; Exclusion, which constitute the colonial System. Our Efforts therefore should be directed to such an adjustment with Great Britain on this Point, as will secure to us, a Right, after the return of Peace, to the greatest attainable Portion of the Trade to her Islands in the west Indies.  
It has been alledged should the expected modification of this article retain its present stipulation on the subject of Impost &amp; Tonnage Duty, that as France by Treaty may claim to enjoy the Rights &amp; privileges of the most favoured nation, she would demand an exemption from the ten per Cent on the Duties [upon] the productions of the west Indies imported in foreign Bottoms, and would moreover be free to impose an alien Tonnage on our Vessels entering their Ports in the West Indies, equal to that imposed on her Vessels in our Ports. This is true, but in order to make this Demand, France must agree by Treaty to open all her Ports in the west Indies, to give us a Right to import into them Flour, Bread, Tobacco, and such other articles as Great Britain shall permit, and which France prohibits; she must also concede to us a Right to purchase in her Islands, and bring away Sugar, Coffee, &amp; Pimento, which by her permanent System she prohibits. [She must do all this because by our Treaty with her she can only intitle herself to a special privilege granted to another Nation by granting on her part to us, the equivalent of what was the consideration of our Grant.] Should France be inclined, so to arrange the Trade between us and her Islands, we certainly shall not object; because, [besides the right,] such an arrangement would be more advantageous to us, than that, which now regulates our intercourse with her west Indies.  
So much of the twelfth article as respects its duration, and the renewal of the negotiation, previous to the expiration of two years after the conclusion of the war, in order to agree in a new arrangement on the subject of the west Indies Trade, as well as for the Purpose of endeavouring to agree whether in any, and in what Cases, neutral Vessels shall protect Enemy Property, and in what cases Provisions and other articles not generally contraband may become such, form a part of the Treaty as ratified by the President. These Clauses sufficiently explain themselves, and require no comment in this Place. They however prove one point, which is, that after every Effort on the Part of our Negotiator the Parties were not able to agree in the Doctrine that free Bottoms should make free Goods, nor in the Cases in which alone Provisions and other Articles not generally contraband should be deemed such—leaving therefore both these Points, precisely as they found them (except in respect to provisions, the payment for which, when by the law of Nations liable to capture &amp; used as contraband is secured) to be regulated by the existing Law of Nations, it is stipulated to renew the Negotiation on these Points, at the Epoch assigned for the future adjustment of the west India Trade, in order then to endeavour to agree in a conventional Rule, which, instead of the Law of Nations, should thereafter regulate the conduct of the Parties in these Respects.  
[The 11th Article has been passed over in silence as being merely introductory &amp; formal.

The inviolability of the principles of the navi- tb  
gationa&amp;had become a kind of axiom incorpora­  
ted in the habits of thinking of the Britith govern­  
ment and nation—Precedent, it is known, has   
great influence as well upon the councils as upon ;rj  
die popular opinions of nations !—and there is per- ,h  
haps no country in which it has greater force than an  
that of Great Britain—The precedent of a feri- 0f  
ons and unequivocal innovation Hpon the fyftemof jj  
the navigation adt difiolved as it were the spell, by ef  
which the public prejudices had been chained to :t. ju  
It took away a mighty argument derived from the fa  
pall inflexibility of the system and laid the faunda- 0f  
Hon for greater inroads upon opinion forfurther ar.d  
greater innovations in pradticc. It served to llrip u  
I the question of every thing that was artificial and  
to btiag it to the simple test of real national inter- J,.  
| eft, to be decided by that best of all arbiters, ex­  
perience. fn  
It may upon this ground be strongly argued that j,(  
the precedent of the privilege gained was of more al  
importance than its immediate extent—an argument D|  
, certainly of real weight and w.hich is fuffieient to 01  
incline candid men .to view the motives that govern- t}  
s ed our negociator in this particular, with favor, and  
- the opinion to which he yielded with refpedt. It a]  
. is perhaps not unimportant, by way of precedent  
g that the article tho&#x27; not established, is fo«nd ia the 0  
. treaty. ei  
Though the 13th article so far as refpedts the j  
terms and conditions of the trade to the British If- f,  
lands forms no part of the treaty, having been excep- 0  
ted, and made the fubjedt of further negotiation, 0  
it may nevertheless be ufeful to take notice of some e

The *rticle has been further criucifedon account mcnt  
of the adjullment of the import and tonnage du- whic

to be (hewn that the tooting on which we were to S,

the cargoes ofeach ihall pay in the ports of the o- that  
! thcr only native duties, it being undeyttood that the  
- thofei.nported in the British Weft Indies on our cles  
productions are small and unimportant, while thole fut.j  
&#x27; imposed in our ports on theproduftions of the Welt a, t  
E Indies are high, and important to our revenue onß  
5 The vilTels of each (hall pay in the perts of the o- natj

adopted as the common rule. &#x27;&#x27;* (lip  
1 la not this equal: can we expect or allc of liritiln at ,  
&#x27;&#x27; vetfels to pay an alien tonnage duty in our Ports, l()e  
_ and that American veflfcls fhuuld enter then ports tn a  
freely, or on payment only of native tornage da- t|)e  
ties? Can we in equity require them to pay on the con  
iz impoitation of their cargoes in Bntifli vcffcls an  
addition of ten per cent on the duties payable en ap j  
the importation of the like articles in American vel-  
J&quot; fels, and at the fame- time demand to pay no higher _  
:,t- i ortrther duties on the cargoes earned in our vei­  
&#x27; ! fels to the British Iflauds, than thof&gt; payable by  
ill them on the like articles imported m /Br&#x27;lllh vc(rel*;  
e- The very fating of iS^  
- Te expect more, were.to expedl, 1  
~ that in a trade in which the opinions and pra&amp;ice of  
CCI Europe contemplate every privilege granted to a i  
foreign nation as a favor—we weie hy treaty to fe- i  
cure a greater advantage to ourfclves than would  
be enjoyed by the nation which granted the privi*  
lege.  
But it is added, that our laws impose a tonnage  
ve duty of fix cents per ton on the entry of Americau  
vessels engaged in foreign trade, and it is not t[,j  
known that British vessels pay any tonnage duty on tat  
their entry in ports in the Weft Indies!—and  
so uniting the two entries, that is, the entry in the  
Well Indies and the entry on a return to our ports,  
an American vefTel will pay fifty fix cents per al.&quot;  
ton, when the Britifc vessels will pay only fifty ,s  
t# cents per ton—lf the British government impose &quot;  
no tonnage duty on their own reffels, and we do cr  
. impose a tonnag® duty on ours, this certainly can­  
in- not form an obje&amp;ion against them. They areas at  
irig free to abstain frona the irapafition of a tonnage du- tIJ  
ty on their own ftiips, as we are to impose one en  
ours—lf their policy is wiser than ours in this rc *  
| &quot; fpeft, we are at liberty to adopt it, by repealing ,u  
- the tonnage duty levied on American navigation, °u  
which it jve please may be confined to the particular  
*&#x27;1&quot; .cafe, the effedt of such a measure as far as it flisuld 1  
extend, tbo&#x27; the duty is small, would be to add a j; 1  
ien proportionable advantage to our (hipping in foreign »P  
competition. But the obje£l of the articles in this | .  
iriJ&quot; particular is to equalize, not the duties that each j  
may choose to impose on their own vessels but those !li  
_&quot; that they shall impose on the vessels of each ether ; n!  
and in this refpeift the article is perfe&amp;ly equal—lt &#x27;*  
is perhaps the firft time that the objection of ine-  
Id, quality was founded on a circumstance depending P1  
hat on the laws of the party affected by it and remove- ™  
able at his own option. 1  
;et&#x27; This view of the fubjeft authorizes a belief that c&#x27;  
in therevifion of the article a modifiaation of it may ,J|  
i. be agreed to that will prove fatisfa&amp;ory. Indeed  
- from the short duration of the article, taken in Jt;  
g connexion Vith the exprtffions made ufet&gt;f towards j  
the close r,f it relative t» the renewsl&#x27;tif iht nego- s&#x27;

is of ; extension of this branch of in- &quot;  
tree ! fcr that Great Britain contemplates a more e-»larg- &#x27;J  
fur&quot; :ed and equal adjullment on this point. r  
&gt;unt The relaxations, which now exill in the color in 1  
fyflems, in eonfequence of the neceflities of war, &quot;  
and which will change to our disadvantage with the 1  
return of peace, have been considered by some as  
the permanent state of things. And this error n  
1 for- has had its influence in miflcading the public in re- e  
&#x27; fpe£t to the terms and conditions on whifh we may a  
re&#x27;Jn : rtafonably expect to participate in the trade of the 1

- a,,a j the refloration of peace will bring with it a reltora- 1  
table tion of the laws of limitation and,exclufion, which 1

and other articles not generally contraband may fre  
become such, form a .part of the treaty as ratihed can  
by the Pielidcut. These clauses fufficiently ex- tie  
plain themfelvcs, and require no comment in this pre  
place They however prove one point, which is, to I  
that after every effort .n the part of our Negocia- tair  
&#x27; tor, the parties are not able to agree in the doctrine the  
&#x27; that free bottoms (hould make free goods, nor in per  
the cases in which alone pravifions and other artt- tori  
ties not generally contraband (hould be deemed joir  
&#x27; such. Leaving therefor, both these points precisely in j

stipulated to renew the negociation on these points pet

der date of 1795, says that the circumstance of  
cotton becoming an article of export, might not  
have occurred to our negotiator, which he res  
marks, &quot;would be the less extraordinary, as here­  
tofore it has not been cultivated, except in a very  
limited degree, and as an article of export rather  
in the manner of experiment than otherwise; and  
as, moreover, from the expense an difficulty of  
separating the seeds from the cottor we have been  
hardly able hitherto to class cotte among our ex  
ports.&quot;
