⟩ by the indefatigable Industry of the Lt Colo. and the Officers who seconded his measures the Regiment was in great forwardness at Alexandria (the place of general rendezvous) early in the spring of 1754 and without waiting till the whole should be compleated—or for a detachment from the Independant Companies of regulars in the Southern Provences (which had been ⟨reqsd⟩ by the Executive of Virginia for this Service) or for troops which were raising in North Carolina and destined in conjunction to oppose the Incroachment of the French on our Western frontiers—He began his March in the Month of May in order to open the Road, and this he had to do almost the whole distance from Winchester (in the County of Frederick not more than 80 miles from Alexandria to the Ohio)—⟨For⟩ deposits—&amp;ca—and for the especiall purpose of siezing, if possible, before the French shd arrive at it, the important Post at the conflux of the Alligany and Monongahela; with the advantages of which he was forcibly struck the preceeding year; and earnestly advised the securing of with Militia, or some other temporary force—But notwithstanding all his exertions, the New, and uncommon difficulties he had to encounter (made more intolerable by incessant Rains and swelled waters of which he had many to cross) he had but just ascended the Lawrel Hill 50 M: short of his object: after a March of 230 Miles from Alexa. when he received information from his Scouts that the French had in force, siezed the Post he was pushing to obtain; having descended from Presque Isle by the Rivers Le beouf and Alligany to this Place by water with artillery &amp;ca &amp;ca—The object of his precipitate advance being thus defeated—The detachmt of regulars, wch had arrived at Alexa. (by water) and under his orders being far in his rear—and no Acct of the Troops from No. Carolina—it was thought advisable to fall back a few miles, to a place—known by the name of the great meadows—abounding in Forage more convenient for the purpose of forming a Magazine &amp; bringing up the rear—and to advance from (if we should ever be in ⟨force⟩ to do it) to the attack of the Post which the enemy now occupied; and had called Du Quesne—At this place, some days  
  
after, we were joined by the above detachment of regulars; consisting (before they were reduced on the March by desertion, Sickness &amp;ca) of a Captn (McKay a brave &amp; worthy Officer)—three Subalterns—and 100 Rank &amp; file. But previous to this junction the French sent a detachment to reconnoitre our Camp to obtain intelligence of our strength &amp; position; notice of which being given by the Scouts G. W. marched at the head of a party, attacked, killed 9 or 10; &amp; captured 20 odd. This, as soon as the enemy had assembled their Indian allies, brought their whole force upon him; consisting, according to their own compared with the ⟨best accts⟩ that could be obtained from others of about 1500 Men. His force consisted of the detachment above mentioned, and between two and 300 Virginians; for the few Indians which till now had attended ⟨him,⟩ and who by reconnoitering the enemy in their March had got terrified at their numbers and resolved to retreat as they advised us to do also but which was impracticable without abandoning our Stores—Baggage—&amp;ca as the horses which had brought them to this place had returned for Provision &amp; had left us previous to the Attack. About 9 Oclock on the 3d of July the Enemy advanced with Shouts, and dismal Indian yells to our Intrenchments, but was opposed by so warm, spirited, &amp; constant a fire, that to force the works in that way was abandoned by them—they then, from every little rising—tree—Stump—Stone—and bush kept up a constant galding fire upon us; which was returned in the best manner we could till late in the afternn

ed—Captn McKay with his detachment remd at Winchester; &amp; the Virginia Regiment proceedd to Alexandria in order to recruit, &amp; get supplied with cloathing &amp; necessarys of which they stood much in need. In this manner the Winter was employed, when advice was recd of the force destined for this Service under the ordrs of G. B. and the arrival of Sir Jno. St Clair the Q: Mastr Genl with some new arrangement of Rank by which no officer who did not immediately derive his Comn from the King could command one who did—This was too degrading for G. W. to submit to; accordingly, he resigned his Military employment; determining to serve the next campaign as a Volunteer; but upon the arrival of Genl Braddock he was very particularly noticed by that General—taken into his family as an extra-Aid—offered a Captns Comn by brevet (which was the highest Grade he had it in his power to bestow⟨)⟩ and had the compliment of several blank Ensigncies given him to dispose of to the Young Gentlemen of his acqe to supply the vacancies in the 44 and 48 Regts which had arrived from Ireland.  
In this capacity he commenced his second Campaign and used every proper occasion till he was taken Sick &amp; left behind in the vicinity of Fort Cumberland to impress the Genl, &amp; the principal Officers around him, with the necessity of opposing the nature of his defence, to the mode of attack which, more  
  
than probably, he would experience from the Canadian French, and their Indians on his March through the Mountains &amp; covered Country but so prepossed were they in favr of regularity &amp; discipline and in such absolute contemp⟨t⟩ were these people held, that the admonition was suggested in vain.  
About the middle of June, this Armament consisting of the two Regiments from Ireland—some Independant Companies and the Provincial troops of Virga Maryld &amp; North Carolina, began to move from Fort Cumberland whither they had assembled—after several days March; and difficulties to which they had never been accustomed in regular Service, in Champaign Countries; and of whh they seemed to have had very little idea—the Genl resolved to divide his force, and at the head of the first division which was composed of the flower of his Army, to advance; and leave Colo. Dunbar with the second division &amp; the heavy Baggage &amp; Stores, to follow after. By so doing, the first division approached the Monongahela 10 miles short of Fort Duquesne the 8th of July; at which time and place having so far recovered from a severe fever and delerium from which he had been rescued by James’s powder, administed by the positive order of the Genl as to travel in a covered Waggon, he joined him and the next day tho’ much reduced and very weak mounted his horse on cushions, &amp; attended as one of his aids.  
About 10 Oclock on the 9th, after the Van had crossed the Monongahela the second time, to avoid an ugly defile (the season being very dry &amp; waters low) and the rear yet in the River the front was attacked; and by the unusual Hallooing and whooping of the enemy, whom they could not see, were so disconcerted and confused as soon to fall into irretrievable disorder. The rear was forced forward to support them, but seeing no enemy, and themselves falling every moment from the fire, a general panic took place among the Troops from which no exertions of the Officers could recover them—In the early part of the Action some of the Irregulars (as they were called) without direc⟨t⟩ns advanced to the right, in loose order, to attack; but this unhappily from the unusual appearance of the movement being mistaken for cowardice and a running away was discountenanced—and before it was too late, &amp; the confusion became general an offer was made by G. W. to head the Provincials, &amp; engage the enemy in their own way; but the propriety of it was not seen into until  
  
it was too late for execution[.] after this, many attempts were made to dislod⟨ge⟩ the enemy from an eminence on the Right but they all proved eneffectual; and fatal to the Officers who by great exertions and good examples endeavourd to accomplish it. In one of these the Genl recd the Wd of which he died; but previous to it, had several horses killed &amp; disabled under him. Captns Orme &amp; Morris his two Aids de Camp having received wounds which rendered them unable to attd G. W. remained the sole aid through the day, to the Genl; he also had one horse killed, and two wounded under him—A ball through his hat—and several through his clothes, but escaped unhurt—Sir Peter Halket (secd in Command) being early killed—Lieutt Colo. Burton &amp; Sir Jno. St Clair (who had the Rank of Lt Colo. in the Army) being badly wounded—Lieutt Colo. Gage (afterwards Genl Gage) having recd a contusion—No person knowing in the disordered State things were who the Surviving Senr Officer was &amp; the Troops by degrees going off in confusion; without a ray of hope left of further opposition from those that remained G. W. placed the Genl in a small covered Cart, which carried some of his most essential equipage, and in the best order he could, with the ⟨last⟩ Troops (who only contind to be fired at) brought him over the first ford of the Monongahela; where they were formed in the best order circumstances would admit on a piece of rising ground; after wch, by the Genls order, he rode forward to halt those which had been earlier in the retreat: Accordingly, after crossing the Monongahela the second time and ascending the heights, he found Lieutt Colo. Gage engaged in this business to whom he delivered the Genls order and then returned to report the situation he found them in—When he was again requested by the Genl whom he met coming on, in his litter with the first halted troops, to proceed (it then being after sundown) to the second division under the command of Colo. Dunbar, to make arrangements for covering the retreat, and forwarding on provisions &amp; refreshments to the retreating &amp; wounded Soldiery—To accomplish this, for the 2d division was 40 odd miles in the rear it took up the whole night &amp; part of the next morning—which from the weak state in which he was, and the fatigues and anxiety of the last 24 hours, rendered him in a manner wholly unfit for the execution of the duty he was sent upon when he arrived at Dunbars Camp—To  
  
the best of his power however, he discharged it, and remained with the secd division till the other joined it. The shocking Scenes which presented themselves in this Nights March are not to be described—The dead—the dying—the groans—lamentation—and crys along the Road of the wounded for help (for those under the latter descriptions endeavoured from the first commencement of the action—or rather confusion to escape to the 2d divn) were enough to pierce a heart of adamant. the gloom &amp; horror of which was not a little encreased by the impervious darkness occasioned by the close shade of thick woods which in places rendered it impossible for the two guides which attended to know when they were in, or out of the track but by groping on the ground with their hands.  
Happy was it for him, and the remains of the first division that they left such a quantity of valuable and enticing baggage on the field as to occasion a scramble and contention in the seizure &amp; distribution of it among the enemy for had a pursuit taken place—by passing the defile which we had avoided; and they had got into our rear, the whole, except a few woodsmen, would have fallen victims to the merciless Savages—Of about 12 or 13 hundred which were in this action eight or 9 hundd were either killed or wounded; among whom a large proportion of brave &amp; valuable Officers were included—The folly &amp; consequence of opposing compact bodies to the sparse manner of Indian fighting, in woods, which had in a manner been predicted, was now so clearly verified that from hence forward another mode obtained in all future operations.  
As soon as the two divisions united, the whole retreated towards Fort Cumberland; and at an Incampment near the Great Meadows the brave, but unfortunate Genl Braddock breathed his last. He was interred with the honors of war, and as it was left to G. W. to see this performed, &amp; to mark out the spot for the reception of his remains—to guard against a savage triumph, if the place should be discovered—they were deposited in the Road over which the Army, Waggons &amp;ca passed to hide every trace by which the entombment could be discovered. thus died a man, whose good &amp; bad qualities were intimately blended. He was brave even to a fault and in regular Service would have done honor to his profession—His attachments were warm—his enmities were strong—and having no disguise about him, both appeared  
  
in full force. He was generous &amp; disinterested—but plain and blunt in his manner even to rudeness—After this event, the Troops continued their March for, and soon arrived at Fort Cumberland without molestation: and all except the P[rovincia]ls immediately resolved to proceed to Philadelphia; by which means the Frontiers of that State but more especially those of Virginia and Maryland were laid entirely open by the very avenue which had been prepared. Of the direful consequences of this measure G. W., in a visit wch he immediately made to Williamsburgh for the purpose brought the Govr &amp; Council of Virga acquainted—But In vain did they remonstrate against the March of the B. Troops to that place to the Officer comdg them. They proceeded to augment their own: the command of which under a very enlarged &amp; dignified Commission, to Command all the Troops now raised, or to be raised in the Colony, was given to him with very extensive powers, and blank Commissions to appoint all New Officers. About this time also or soon after it the discontents and clamours of the Provincial Officers, and the remonstrance of G. W. in person, to Genl Shirley, the then Comr in chief of the British Forces in America and through the Govr &amp; Council to the Kings Minister with respect to the degrading Situation in which they were placed[,] a new arrangement took place by the Kings order, by which every Provincial Officer was to rank according to the Comn he bore, but to be junr to those of the same grade in the established Corps.  
As G. W. foresaw, so it happened, the frontiers were continually harrassed—but not having force enough to carry the war to the gates of Du Quesne, he could do no more than distribute the Troops along the Frontiers in Stockaded Forts; more with a view to quiet the fears of the Inhabitants than from any expectation of giving security on so extensive a line to the settlements. During this interval in one of his tours along the frontier posts—he narrowly escaped, according to the acc. afterwards given by some of our People who were Prisoners with them, and eyewitness at the time ⟨illegible falling⟩ by an Indian party who had waylaid (for another purpose) the communication along which  
  
with a small party of horse only he was passing—the road in this place formed a curve—and the prey they were in weight for being expected at the reverse part, the Captn of the party had gone across to observe the number [and] manner of their movemt &amp;ca in order that he might make his disposition accordingly leaving orders for the party not to take notice of any passengers the other ⟨way⟩ till he returned to them—in the mean time in the opposite direction I passed &amp; escaped almt certain destruction for the weather was raining and the few Carbines unfit for use if we had escaped the first fire—This happened near Fort Vass. Never ceasing in the mean time in his attempts, to demonstrate to the Legislature of Virga—to Lord Loudoun—&amp;ca that the only means of preventing the devastations to which the middle states were exposed, was to remove the cause. But the war by this time raging in another quarter of the Continent all applications were unheeded till the year 1758 when an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne was concerted, and undertaken under the conduct of Genl Forbes; who tho a brave &amp; good Officer, was so much debilitated by bad health, and so illy supplied with the means to carry on the expedition, that it was November before the Troops got to Loyal hanning: 50 or 60 miles short of Duquesne &amp; even then was on the very point of abandoning the Exhibition when some seasonable supplies arriving the Army was formed into three Brigades took up its March—and moved forward; the Brigade Commanded by G. W. being the leading one.  
Previus to this, and during the time the Army lay at Loyal haning a circumstance occurred wch involved the life of G. W. in as much jeopardy as it had ever been before or since[.] the enemy sent out a large detachment to reconnoitre our Camp, and to ascertain our strength; in consequence of Intelligence that they were within 2 Miles of the Camp a party commanded by Lt Colo. Mercer of the Virga line (a gallant &amp; good Officer)  
  
was sent to dislodge them between whom a Severe conflict &amp; hot firing ensued which lasting some time &amp; appearing to approach the Camp it was conceived that our party was yielding the ground upon which G. W. with permission of the Genl called (for dispatch) for Volunteers and immediately marched at their head to sustain, as was conjectured the retiring troops. led on by the firing till he came within less than half a mile, &amp; it ceasing, he detached Scouts to investigate the cause &amp; to communicate his approach to his friend Colo. Mercer advancing slowly in the meantime—But it being near dusk and the intelligence not having been fully dissiminated among Colo. Mercers Corps, and they taking us, for the enemy who had retreated approaching in another direction commenced a heavy fire upon the releiving party which drew fire in return in spite of all the exertions of the Officers one of whom &amp; several privates were killed and many wounded before a stop could be put to it. to accomplish which G. W. never was in more imminent danger by being between two fires, knocking up with his sword the presented pieces.  
When the Army had got within about 12 or 15 miles of the Fort the enemy dispairing of its defence, blew it up—having first embarked their Artillery Stores &amp; Troops—and retreated by water down the Ohio to their Settlements below—thus ended that Campaign, a little before Christmas in very inclement weather; and the last one made during that War by G. W. whose health by this time (as it had been declining for many months before occasioned by an inveterate disorder in his Bowels) became so precarious as to induce him (having seen quiet restored by this event to the Frontiers of his own Country which was the principal inducement to his taking arms) to resign his Military appointments—The sollicitation of the Troops which he commanded to Continue—their Affecte farewell address to him, when they found the Situation of his health and other circumstances would not allow it affected him exceedingly and in grateful sensibility he expressed the warmth of his attachmt to them on that, and his inclination to serve them on every other future occasion.

By the indefatigable industry of the  
Lieutenant Colonel and the officers who  
seconded his measures, the Regiment  
was in great forwardness at Alexandria  
(the place of general rendezvous) early  
in the spring of 1754, and without  
waiting till the whole should be com-  
pleted, or for a detachment from the  
independent companies of regulars in  
the southern provinces (which had  
been required by the Executive of Vir-  
ginia for this service), or for troops  
which were raising in North Carolina  
and destined in conjunction to oppose  
the incroachment of the French at our  
Western frontiers—He began his march  
in the month of May in order to open  
the road, and this he had to do almost  
the whole distance from Winchester  
(in the County of Frederick not more  
than eighty miles from Alexandria to  
the Ohio)—deposits &amp;c.—and for the  
especiall purpose of siezing, if possible,  
before the French should arrive at it,  
the important post at the conflux of  
the Alligany and Monongahela; with  
the advantages of which he was struck  
the preceding year; and earnestly ad-  
vised the securing of with militia, or  
some other temporary force. But not-  
withstanding all his exertions, the new  
and uncommon difficulties he had to  
encounter (made more intolerable by  
incessant rains and waters of which  
he had many to cross), he had but  
just ascended the Laurel Hill 50 m.  
short of his object after a march of  
230 miles from Alex. when he received  
information from his scouts that the  
French had in force siezed the post he  
was pushing to obtain; having de-  
scended from Presque Isle by the  
rivers Lebeouf and Alligany to this  
place by water with artillery &amp;ec. Xe.  
The object of his precipitate advance  
being thus defeated, the detachment of  
regulars which had arrived at Alexan-  
dria by water, and under his orders be-  
ing far in his rear and no account of  
the troops from North Carolina, it was  
thought advisable to fall back a few  
  
miles, to a place known by the name of  
the Great Meadows, abounding in for-  
age, more convenient for the purpose  
of forming a magazine and bringing up  
the rear, and to advance from (if we  
should ever be in force to do it) to the  
attack of the post which the enemy  
now occupied, and had called Du-  
Quesne. At this place, some days after,  
we were joined by the above detach-  
ment of regulars, consisting (before  
they were reduced on the march by de-  
sertion, sickness, Kc.) of a Captain Mc-  
Kay, a brave and worthy officer, three  
subalterns and 100 rank and file. But  
previous to this junction the French  
sent a detachment to reconnoitre our  
lines and to obtain intelligence of our  
strength and position ; notice of which  
being given by the scouts, G. W.  
marched at the head of a party, at-  
tacked, killed 9 or 10, and captured 20  
odd. This, as soon as the enemy had  
assembled their Indian allies, brought  
their whole force upon him, consisting,  
according to their own, compared with  
the best acct. that could be obtained  
from others, of about 1500 men. His  
force consisted of the detachment above  
mentioned, also between two &amp; 300  
Virginians ; for the few Indians which  
till now had attended him, and who by  
reconnoitering the enemy in their  
march had got terrified at their num-  
bers and resolved to retreat as they ad-  
vised us to do also, but which was im-  
practicable without abandoning our  
stores, baggage Kec. as the horses which  
had brought them to this place, and re-  
turned for provision, had left us previ-  
ous to the attack. About 9 o’clock on  
the 3rd of July the enemy advanced  
with shouts and dismal Indian yells to  
our entrenchments, but was opposed  
by so warm, spirited, and constant a  
fire, that to force the works in that way  
was abandoned by them. They then,  
from every little rising, tree, stump,  
stone, and bush kept up a constant  
galding fire upon us; which was re-  
turned in the best manner we could

proceeded to Alexandria in order  
to recruit, and get supplied with cloath-  
ing and necessarys of which they stood  
much in need. In this manner the  
winter was employed, when advice was  
received of the force destined for this  
service under the orders of G. W.  
and the arrival of Sir John St. Clair  
  
THE BRADDOCK CAMPAIGN.  
  
the Q. Master Genl. with some new ar-  
rangement of rank by which no officer  
who did not immediately derive his  
comn. from the King could command  
one who did. This was too degrading  
for G. W. to submit to; accordingly,  
he resigned his military employment ;  
determining to serve the next cam-  
paign as a volunteer; but upon the ar-  
rival of Genl. Braddock he was very  
particularly noticed by that General,  
taken into his family as an extra Aid,  
offered a Captain’s commission by  
brevet (which was the highest grade he  
had it in his power to bestow) and had  
the compliment of several blank En-  
signcies given him to dispose of to the  
Young Gentlemen of his acqe. to sup-  
ply the vacancies in the 44 and 48  
Regts. which had arrived from Ireland.  
In this capacity he commenced his  
second campaign, and used every prop-  
er occasion till he was taken sick and  
left behind in the vicinity of Fort Cum-  
berland, to impress the Genl. and the  
principal officers around him, with the  
necessity of opposing the nature of his  
defense to the mode of attack which  
more than probably he would experi-  
ence from the Canadian French and  
their Indians on his march through  
the mountains and covered country,  
but so prepossessed were they in favor  
of regularity &amp; discipline and in such  
absolute contempt were those people  
held, that the admonition was suggested  
in vain. About the middle of June this  
armament, consisting of the two Regi-  
ments from Ireland some independent  
companies and the provincial troops of  
Virginia, Maryland and North Caro-  
lina, began to move from Fort Cumber-  
land, whither they had assembled.  
After several days’ march, and difficul-  
ties to which they had never been ac-  
customed in regular service in Cham-  
paign Countries, and of which they  
seemed to have had very little idea, the  
Genl. resolved to divide his force, and  
at the head of the first division which  
was composed of the flower of his  
army, to advance, and leave Col. Dun-  
bar with the second division and the  
heavy baggage and stores, to follow  
after. By so doing, the first division  
approached the Monongahela 10 miles

July, at which time and place having  
so far recovered from a severe fever  
and delerium from which he had been  
rescued by James’ powder, adminis-  
tered by the positive order of the Genl.  
as to travel in a covered Waggon, he  
joined him and the next day tho’ much  
reduced and very weak mounted his  
horse on cushions, and attended as one  
of his Aids. About 10 o&#x27;clock on the  
9th, after the van had crossed the Mon-  
ongahela the second time, to avoid an  
ugly defile (the season being very dry  
and waters low) and the rear yet in the  
river the front was attacked; and by  
the unusual hallooing and whooping of  
the enemy, whom they could not see,  
were so disconcerted and confused as  
soon to fall into irretrievable disorder.  
The rear was forced forward to support  
them, but seeing no enemy, and them-  
selves falling every moment from the  
fire, a general panic took place among  
the troops, from which no exertions of  
the officers could recover them. In  
the early part of the action some of the  
Irregulars (as they were called) without  
directions advanced to the right in  
loose order, to attack ; but this, wnhap-  
pily from the unusual appearance of  
the movement being mistaken for cow-  
ardace and a running away, was dis-  
countenanced—and before it was too  
late, and the confusion became general,  
an offer was made by G. W. to head the  
Provincials and engage the enemy in  
their own way ; but the propriety of it  
was not seen into until it was too late  
for execution. After this, many at-  
tempts were made to dislodge the  
enemy from an eminence on the right,  
but they all proved ineffectual, and  
fatal to the officers, who by great exer-  
tions and good examples endeavored  
to accomplish it. In one of these the  
Genl. received the wound of which he  
died ; but previous to it, had several  
horses killed and disabled under him.  
Captus. Orme and Morris (his two Aids  
de camp having received wounds which  
rendered them unable to attend, G. W.  
remained the sole Aid through the day,  
to the Genl.; he also had one horse  
killed and two wounded under him, a  
ball through his hat, and _ several  
through his clothes, but escaped un-  
hurt. Sir Peter Halkel (secd. in com-  
  
THE BRADDOCK CAMPAIGN.  
  
mand) being early killed, Lieut. Colo.  
Burton and Sir John St. Clair (who had  
the rank of Lt. Colo. in the army) being  
badly wounded, Lieut. Colo. Gage  
(afterwards Gen. Gage) having received  
a contussion. No person knowing in  
the disordered state things were who  
the surviving senior officer was, and  
the troops by degrees going off in con-  
fusion ; without a ray of hope left of  
further opposition from those that re-  
mained, G. W. placed the Genl. in a  
small covered Cart, which carried some  
of his most essential equipage, and in  
the best order he could, with the last  
troops (who only continued to be fired  
at) brought him over the jirst ford of  
the Monongahela; where they were  
formed in the best order circumstances  
would admit on a piece of rising  
ground ; After wch., by the Genl.’s ov-  
der, he rode forward to halt those which  
had been earlier in the retreat. Ac-  
cordingly, after crossing the Mononga-  
hela the second time and ascending the  
heights, he found Lieut. Colo. Gage  
engaged in this business, to whom he  
delivered the Genl.’s order and then  
returned to report the situation he  
found them in. When he was again  
requested by the Genl. whom he met  
coming on in his litter with the first  
halted troops, to proceed (it then be-  
ing after sundown) to the second di-  
vision under the command of Colo.  
Dunbar, to make arrangements for cov-  
ering the retreat, and forwarding on  
provisions and refreshments to the re-  
treating and wounded soldiers. To ac-  
complish this, for the second division  
was 40 odd miles in the rear, it took up  
the whole night and part of the next  
morning—which from the weak state  
in which he was, and the fatigues, and  
anxiety of the last 24 hours, rendered  
him in a manner wholly unfit for the  
execution of the duty he was sent upon  
when he arrived at Dunbar’s camp. To  
the best of his power however, he dis-  
charged it, and remained with the sec-  
ond division till the other joined it.  
The shocking scenes which presented  
themselves in this night’s march are  
not to be described —the dead—the  
dying—the groans—lamentations and  
erys along the road of the wounded for  
help (for those under the latter de-  
  
  
  
THE BRADDOCK CAMPAIGN.  
  
scriptions endeavored from the first  
commencement of the action or rather  
confusion to escape to ye second divi-  
sion) were enough to pierce a heart of  
adamant. The gloom and horror of  
which was not a little encreased by the  
impervious darkness occasioned by the  
close shade of thick woods which in  
places rendered it impossible for the  
two guides which attended to know  
when they were in or out of the track,  
but by groping on the ground with  
their hands. Happy was it for him  
and the remains of the first division  
that they left such a quantity of valua-  
ble and enticing baggage on the field  
as to occasion a scramble and conten-  
tion in the seizure and distribution of  
it among the enemy ; for had a pursuit  
taken place, by passing the defile which  
we had avoided, and they had got into  
our rear, the whole, except a few woods-  
men would have fallen victims to the  
merciless savages. Of about 12 or 13  
hundred which were in this action,  
  
eight or 9 hundred were either killed  
or wounded, among whom a large pro-  
portion of brave and valuable officers  
  
were included. The folly and conse-  
quence of opposing compact bodies to  
the sparse manner of Indian fighting  
in woods, which had in a manner been  
predicted, was now so clearly verified  
that from henceforward another mode  
obtained in all future operations. As  
soon as the two divisions united, the  
whole retreated towards Fort Cumber-  
land; and at an incampment near the  
Great Meadows the brave but unfortu-  
nate Genl. Braddock breathed his last.  
He was interred with the honors of  
war, and as it was left to G. W. to see  
this performed, and to mark out the  
spot for the reception of his remains—  
to guard against a savage triumph, if  
the place should be discovered—they  
were deposited in the Road over which  
the army wagons Xc. passed to hide  
every trace by which the entombment  
could be discovered.  
  
Thus died a man whose good and  
bad qualities were intimately blended.  
He was brave even to a fault and in  
regular service would have done honor  
to his profession. His attachments  
were warm—his enmities were strong  
—and having no disguise about him,  
  
535  
  
both appeared in full force. He was  
generous and disinterested—but plain  
and blunt in his manner even to rude-  
ness. After this event the troops con-  
tinued their march forward and soon  
arrived at Fort Cumberland without  
molestation, all except the pvls. im-  
mediately resolved to proceed to Phil-  
adelphia ; by which means the frontiers  
of that state but more especially those  
of Virginia and Maryland, were laid  
entirely open by the very avenue which  
had been prepared. Of the direful  
consequences of this measure, G. W.,  
in a visit which he immediately made  
to Williamsburgh, a visit that brought  
the Governor and Council of Virginia  
acquainted. But in vain did they re-  
monstrate against the march of the B.  
troops to that place to the officer com-  
manding them. They thus proceeded  
to augment their own, the command  
of which under a very enlarged and  
dignified commission, to command ail  
the troops now raised, or to be raised  
in the Colony, was given to him with  
very extensive powers, and blank com-  
missions to appoint all new officers.  
About this time also or soon after it,  
the discontents and clamours of the  
Provincial Officers and the remon-  
strance of G. W. in person to Genl.  
Shirley, the then Commander in Chief  
of the British forces in America, and  
through the Governor and Council to  
the King’s Minister, with respect to  
the degrading situation in which they  
were placed, a new arrangement took  
place by the King’s order, by which  
every Provincial officer was to rank ac-  
cording to the commission he bore,  
but to be Junior to those of the same  
grade in the established course. As  
G. W. foresaw, so it happened, the  
frontiers were continually harassed—  
but not having force enough to carry  
the war to the gates of Duquesne, he  
could do no more than distribute the  
troops along the frontiers in stockaded

were prisoners with them,  
and eye witnesses at the  
time of the [undeciphera-  
ble] falling by an Indian  
party who had waylaid (for  
another purpose) the com-  
munication along which  
with a small party of horse  
only, he was passing — the  
road in this place formed  
a curve, and the prey they  
were in weight for being  
expected at the reverse part,  
the Captn. of the party had  
gone across to observe the  
number and manner of  
their movement ec. in or-  
der that he might make his  
disposition accordingly,  
leaving orders for the party  
not to take notice of any  
passengers the other way  
till he returned to them  
  
in the meantime, in the op-  
posite direction I passed  
and escaped almost certain  
destruction, for the weather  
was raining and the few  
carbines unfit for use if we  
had escaped the first fire.  
This happened near Fort  
Vass. Never ceasing, in the  
meantime, in his attempts  
to demonstrate to the Leg-  
islature of Virginia— to  
Lord Louden &amp;c.—that the  
only means of preventing  
the devastations to which  
the middle states were ex-  
posed, was to remove the  
cause. But the war by this  
time raging in another  
quarter of the continent,  
all applications were un-  
heeded till the year 1758,  
when an expedition against  
Fort Duquesne was con-  
certed and undertaken un-  
der the conduct of Genl.  
Forbes; who though a  
brave and good officer, was  
so much debilitated by bad  
health, and so illy supplied  
with the means to carry on  
the expedition, that it was  
November before the troops  
got to Loyalhanning fifty or  
  
  
  
THE BRADDOCK CAMPAIGN.  
  
sixty miles short of DuQuesne, and  
even then was on the very point of  
abandoning the exhibition when some  
seasonable supplies arriving, the army  
was formed into three brigades—took  
up its march—and moved forward ;  
the brigade commanded by G. W. being  
the leading one. Previous to this, and  
during the time the army lay at Loyal-  
hanning, a circumstance occurred which  
involved the life of G. W. in as much  
jeopardy as it had ever been before or  
since.  
  
The enemy sent out a large detach-  
ment to reconnoitre our camp, and to  
ascertain our strength ; in consequence  
of intelligence that they were within  
two miles of the camp a party com-  
manded by Lieut. Colo. Mercer, of  
the Virginia Line (a gallant and good  
officer) was sent to dislodge them, be-  
tween whom a severe conflict and hot  
firing ensued, which lasting some time  
and appearing to approach the camp, it  
was conceived that our party was yield-  
ing the ground, upon which G. W. with  
permission of the Genl. called (per  
dispatch) for volunteers and immedi-  
  
ately marched at their head, to sus-  
tain, as was conjectured, the retireing  
  
troops. Led on by the firing till he  
came within less than half a mile, and  
it ceasing, he detached scouts to inves-  
tigate the cause, and to communicate  
his approach to his friend Colo. Mer-  
cer, advancing slowly in the meantime.  
But it being near dusk, and the intelli-  
gence not having been fully dissimi-  
nated among Colo. Mercer’s corps,  
and they taking us for the enemy who  
had retreated approaching in another  
direction, commenced a heavy fire upon  
the relieving party which drew fire in  
return in spite of all the exertions of  
the officers, one of whom, and several  
privates were killed and many wound-  
ed before a stop could be put to it, to  
accomplish which G. W. never was in  
more imminent danger, by being be-  
  
537  
  
tween two fires, knocking up with his  
sword the presented pieces.  
  
When the army had got within about  
twelve or fifteen miles of the Fort the  
enemy dispairing of its defense, blew  
it up, having first embarked their artil-  
ery, stores and Troops, and retreated  
by water down the Ohio, to their set-  
tlements below. Thus ended that  
Campaign, a little before Christmas, in  
very inclement weather; and the last  
one made during that War by G. W.  
whose health by this time (as it had  
been declining for many months before,  
occasioned by an inveterate disorder in  
his bowels) became so precarious as to  
induce him (having seen quiet restored  
by this event to the frontiers of his  
own country, which was the principal  
inducement to his taking arms) to re-  
sign his military appointments. The  
sollicitation of the troops which he com-  
manded to continue—their affectionate  
farewell address to him when they  
found the situation of his health and  
other circumstances would not allow it,  
affected him exceedingly, and in grate-  
ful sensibility he expressed the warmth  
of his attachment to them on that, and  
his inclination to serve them on every  
other future occasion.

news was received that a  
party previously sent to build a fort  
at the confluence of the Monongahela  
with the Ohio, had been driven back  
by a considerable French force, which  
had completed the fort and named it  
after the Marquis Duquesne, governor  
of Canada. This was the beginning  
of the French and Indian war which  
was destined to continue for seven  
years. Washington, who had been  
commissioned a_ lieutenant-colonel,  
was sent forward with 150 men to re-  
trieve the loss of the fort, but being  
unsupported by the promised rein-  
forcements, he was unable to attack.  
In his narrative Washington says:  
  
The object of his precipitate advance being  
thus defeated, the detachment of regulars  
which had arrived at Alexandria by water,  
  
  
  
HISTORY IN BRIEF.  
  
and under his orders being far in the rear  
and no account of the troops from North Car-  
olina, it was thought advisable tofall back a  
few miles, to a place known by the name of  
the Great Meadows, abounding in forage,  
more convenient for the purpose of forming  
a magazine and bringing up the rear, and to  
advance from (if we should ever be in force  
to do it) to the attack at the post which the  
enemy now occupied, and had called Du  
Quesne. At this place, some days after, we  
were joined by the above detachment of reg-  
ulars, consisting (before they were reduced  
on the march by desertion, sickness, &amp;c.) of  
a Captain McKay, a braveand worthy officer,  
three subalterns and roo rank and file. But  
previous to this junction the French sent a  
detachment to reconnoitre our lines and to  
obtain intelligence of our strength and _posi-  
tion; notice of which being given by the  
scouts, G. W. marched at the head of a party,  
attacked, killed 9 or 10, and captured 200dd.  
This, as soon as the enemy had assembled  
their Indian allies, brought their whole force  
upon him, consisting, according to their own,  
compared with the best acct. that could be ob-  
tained from others, of about 1500 men. His  
force consisted of the detachment above men-  
tioned, also between two &amp; 300 Virginians ;  
for the few Indians which till now had attend-  
ed him, and who by reconnoitering the enemy  
in their march had got terrified at their num-  
bers and resolved to retreat, as they advised  
us to do also, but which was impracticable  
without abandoning our stores, baggage, &amp;c.,  
as the horses which had brought them tothis  
place, and returned for provisions, had left  
us previous to the,attack. About g o’clock  
on the 3rd of July the enemy advanced with  
shouts and dismal Indian yells to our en-  
trenchments, but was opposed by so warm,  
spirited, and constant a fire, that to force the  
works in that way was abandoned by them.  
They then, from every little rising, tree,  
stump, stone, and bush kept up a constant  
galding fire upon us ; which was returned in  
the best manner we could till late in the after-  
noon

Washington passed the winter in  
Virginia preparing for a spring cam-  
paign. Then Sir John St. Clair,  
quartermaster general, arrived “ with  
some new arrangement of rank by  
which no officer who did not zmmedi-  
ately derive his comn, from the King  
could command one who did.” Wash-  
ington continues :  
  
This was too degrading for G. W. to sub-  
mit to; accordingly, he resigned his military  
employment; determining to serve the next  
campaign as a volunteer; but upon the ar-  
rival of Genl. Braddock he was very parti-  
cularly noticed by that General, taken into  
his family as an extra Aid, offered a Captain’s  
commission by drevet (which was the highest  
grade he had it in his power to bestow) and  
had the compliment of several blank Ensign-

Gentlemen of his acqe. to supply the vacan-

compelled to retreat. The following  
is an extract from Washington’s ac-  
count of this movement :  
  
The shocking scenes which presented them-  
selves in this night’s march are not to be de-  
scribed—the dead—the dying—the groans—  
lamentations and cries along the road of the  
wounded for help (for those under the latter  
descriptions endeavored from the first com-  
mencement of the action or rather confusion  
to escape to yesecond division) were enough  
to pierce a heart of adamant. The gloom  
and horror of which was not alittle increased  
by the impervious darkness occasioned by  
the close shade of thick woods which in  
places rendered it impossible for the two  
guides which attended to know when they  
were in or out of the track, but by groping  
on the ground with their hands. Happy was  
it for htm and the remains of the first divi-  
sion that they left such a quantity of valuable  
and enticing baggage on the field as to occa-  
sion a scramble and contention in the seizure  
and distribution of it among the enemy ; for  
had a pursuit taken place, by passing the de-  
file which we had avoided, and they had got  
into our rear, the whole, except a few woods-  
men would have fallen victims to the merci-  
less savages

most essential equipage. He  
was interred with the honors of war,

The enemy sent out a large detachment to  
reconnoitre our camp, and to ascertain our  
strength; in consequence of intelligence that  
they were within two miles of the camp a  
party Commanded by Lieut. Colo. Mercer of  
the Virginia Line (a gallant and good officer)  
was sent to dislodge them, between whom a  
severe conflict and hot firing ensued, which  
lasting some time and appearing to approach  
the camp, it was conceived that our party  
was yielding the ground, upon which G. W,  
with permission of the Genl. called (per dis-  
patch) for volunteers and immediately march-  
ed attheir head, to sustain, as was conjec-  
tured, the retireing troops. Led on by the  
firing till he came within less than half amile,  
and it ceasing, he detached scouts to investi-  
gate the cause, and to communicate his ap-  
proach to his friend Colo. Mercer, advancing  
slowly in the meantime. But it being near

had retreated approaching in another direc-  
tion, commenced a heavy fire upon the reliev-  
ing party which drew fire in return in spite  
of allthe exertions of the officers, one of  
whom, and several privates were killed and  
many wounded before a stop could be put to  
it, to accomplish which G. W. never was in  
more imminent danger, by being between  
two fires, knocking up with his sword the  
presented pieces,  
  
When the army under General  
Forbes got within twelve or fifteen  
miles of Fort Duquesne, the enemy  
despairing of its defense, blew it up,  
having first embarked their artillery,  
stores, and troops, and retreated down  
the Ohio, to their settlements below.  
Washington says: “Thus ended that  
campaign, a little before Christmas,  
in very inclement weather; and the  
last one made during that war by G.  
W. whose health by this time (as it  
had been declining for many months  
before, occasioned by an inveterate  
disorder in his bowels) became so pre-  
carious as to induce him (having seen  
quiet restored by this event to the  
frontiers of his own country, which  
was the principal inducement to his  
taking arms) to resign his military  
appointments. The solicitation of the  
troops which he commanded to con-  
tinue—their affectionate farewell ad-  
dress to him when he found the situa-  
tion of his health and other circum-  
stances would not allow it, affected  
him exceedingly, and in grateful  
sensibility he expressed the warmtl.  
of his attachment to them on that, and  
his inclination to serve them on every  
other future occasion.”

Washington&#x27;s Narrow Escape.  
From an &quot;Unpublished Autograph  
Niiarative by Washington,&quot; in Scrib­  
ner&#x27;s Magazine, we quote as follows !  
It was conceived that our party was  
yielding the ground, upon which G.  
W. with permission of the General,  
called (per dispatch) for volunteers and  
immediately marched at their head, to  
sustain, as was conjectured, the retir­  
ing troops. Led on by the firing till  
he came within less than half a mile,  
and it ceasing, he detached scouts to  
investigate the cause, and to commu­  
nicate his apprach to his friend Col­  
onel Mercer, advancing slowly in the  
meantime. But it being near dusk,  
and the intelligence not having been  
fully dissiminated among Colonel Mer­  
cer&#x27;s corps, and they taking us for the  
enemy who had retreated approaching  
in another direction, commenced a  
heavy fire upon the relieving party  
which drew fire in return in spite of  
all the exertions of the officers, one of  
whom, and several privates were killed  
and many wounded before a stop could  
be put to it, to accomplish which G.  
W. never was in more imminent danger,  
by being between two fires, knocking  
up with-his sword the presented pieces.
