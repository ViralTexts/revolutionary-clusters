If your plan arrives, I will consult with Mr. Jones, and according to the result of our consultation make preparations in the winter for the next year’s work.  
Congress have risen. You will have seen by their proceedings the truth of what I always observed to you, that one man outweighs them all in influence over the people who have supported his judgment against their own and that of their representatives.

of Doll. and that in the whole union to 100. millions. I think the last too high. All the imported commodities are raised about 50. per cent, by the depreciation of the money. Tobacco shares the rise because it has no competition abroad. Wheat has been extravagantly high from other causes. When these cease, it must fall to it’s antient nominal price notwithstanding the depreciation of that, because it must contend at market with foreign wheats. Lands have risen within the vortex of the paper, and as far out as that can influence. They are not risen at all here. On the contrary they are lower than they were 20. years ago. Those I had mentioned to you, to wit, Carter’s and Colle were sold before your letter came. Colle @ two dollars the acre. Carter’s had been offered me for two French crowns (13/2). Mechanics here get from a dollar to a dollar and a half a day, yet are much worse off than at old prices
