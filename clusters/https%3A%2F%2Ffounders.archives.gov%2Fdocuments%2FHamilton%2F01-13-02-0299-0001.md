sman in the House. The famous “Giles resolutions” read as follows:  
“Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested to cause to be laid before this House copies of the authorities under which loans have been negotiated, pursuant to the acts of the fourth and twelfth of August, one thousand seven hundred and ninety, together with copies of the authorities directing the application of the moneys borrowed.  
“Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested to cause this House to be furnished with the names of the persons by whom, and to whom, the respective payments of the French debt have been made in France, pursuant to the act for that purpose; specifying the dates of the respective drafts upon the Commissioners in Holland, and the dates of the respective payments of the debt. A similar statement is requested respecting the debts to Spain and Holland.  
“Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed to lay before this House an account exhibiting, half-monthly, the balances between the United States and the Bank of the United States, including the several Branch Banks, from the commencement of those Institutions, to the end of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two.  
“Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed to lay before this House an account of all moneys which may have come into the Sinking Fund, from the commencement of that Institution to the present time; specifying the particular fund from which they have accrued, and exhibiting, half-yearly, the sums uninvested, and where deposited.  
“Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be directed to report to this House the balance of all unapplied revenues at the end of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two, specifying whether in money or bonds, and noting where the money is deposited; that he also make report of all unapplied moneys which may have been obtained by the several loans authorized by law, and where such moneys are now deposited.”  
  
Giles’s speech to the House of Representatives in support of these resolutions reads as follows:  
“The resolutions … have grown out of the embarrassments I have met with in attempting to comprehend the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, made in pursuance of an order of this House of the 27th of December, 1792, exhibiting sundry statements respecting foreign loans. These embarrassments have increased in proportion to the attention which I have bestowed on the subject; and a number of official papers to which I have had reference for information, instead of elucidating, seem rather to obscure the inquiry. To obtain necessary information, therefore, is the object of these resolutions, and no one can doubt the immediate applicability of this information to a bill now lying upon your table, for the purpose of reimbursing the loan of $2,000,000 made of the Bank of the United States, by opening a new loan for that sum abroad, and by changing the application of the like sum already borrowed and appropriated to the discharge of the debt to France from its original destination to the immediate discharge of the debt to the Bank.  
“The first resolution has arisen from that part of the printed Report of the Secretary of the Treasury which exhibits the terms upon which various loans have been made abroad, but neither presents the precise authorities under which those negotiations have been made, nor the precise amount of the sums borrowed for the separate and distinct objects of the two acts mentioned in the resolution.  
“Another reason has more strongly suggested the propriety of calling for the information requested by this resolution. The bill now upon your table, which has been before alluded to, contemplates the whole of the moneys borrowed from abroad, and now on hand, as being originally appropriated to the discharge of the French debt, and proposes to change the original destination of these identical moneys; and the reason assigned for this measure has been the unsettled state of affairs in France.  
“In the printed Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, he remarks that the same moneys are applicable to the Sinking Fund. It appears strange, that after express and distinct appropriations by law, that any misunderstanding relative to this object should exist, and the information called for may possibly explain this seeming contradiction.  
“The second resolution has arisen from that part of the printed Report marked B, and which exhibits the payments made to France, but does not furnish the names of the persons engaged in those negotiations, nor does it present to view the length of time those persons have been possessed of the public moneys, by stating the dates of the respective drafts in Holland, and the dates of the actual application of the moneys to the discharge of the debt; and it is evident that from the time the loans are respectively created, to the times of the actual application of the moneys borrowed, the United States are paying the usual interest upon the debt intended to be redeemed, and the stipulated interest upon the moneys borrowed for the redemption. This remark is equally applicable to the payments of other foreign debts with the payments of the debt to France.  
“The third resolution has arisen from calculations drawn partly from the last page of the printed report, and from the original Bank book of the United States, from which it appears that the balances in Bank in favor of the United States were as follows:  
  
  
In Bank, Philadelphia, 30th May, 1792, and 16th June, same year, in branch banks  
$676,952 55  
  
  
1792, June 30th, in all banks in the United States  
555,271 22  
  
  
July 28th and 31st, in all banks in the United States  
511,423 91  
  
  
August 25th, 30th, and 31st, in all banks in the United States  
740,903 87  
  
  
“On the 1st of June, a loan was negotiated with the Bank of the United States on the part of the United States, for $100,000, at 5 per cent. per annum. On the 1st of July, another loan was made upon the same terms for the like sum. On the 1st of August, another loan was made upon the same terms for the like sum. On the 1st of September, another loan was made upon the same terms for the like sum. It appears from the last page of the printed Report, that there had been drawn into America, from the 15th of December, 1790, to the 27th of January, 1792, of the moneys borrowed abroad, the sum of 2,663,621 florins, 2 stivers, and 6 deniers. If this sum were unexpended, and lodged in the bank at the times of making these loans, (and Congress have never yet been informed of any deficiency of revenue,) the United States will, of consequence, have paid upon the moneys borrowed from the Bank of the United States, from 15 to 17 per cent. per annum, to wit: they will have paid 5 per cent. upon the original debt to France, 5 per cent. upon the moneys borrowed for its redemption, exclusive of douceurs and other charges, and 5 per cent. upon the sum borrowed of the bank, which may be deemed part of this deposite made in the Bank by the United States. But, discarding these inferences, it must at least be admitted that the United States are paying 5 per cent. for the loan of moneys from the Bank, when a sum larger than the loan itself, is actually deposited in Bank. It is here to be remarked, that a balance of cash is admitted, by the Treasurer’s return, to have been in his hands on the 31st of December, 1790, amounting to $973,342 43, and in July 30, 1791, the sum of $582,189 54.  
“I am informed that bills are often drawn in favor of the Bank for moneys in the hands of the revenue officers in distant parts of the United States, and that credit is entered in the Bank book upon the receipt of such bills, although the moneys may not actually be in Bank for some time after the credit is entered, and hence it is inferred that the Bankbook does not conclusively show the real sum in Bank, not to mention that such bills answer all the purposes of cash, and ought therefore to be credited upon the receipt of them. It is to be remarked that there is a regular and continual influx of moneys into the Bank by the operation of these bills. It is not very material whether a bill lodged in Bank to-day, should be paid to-day, provided something like the same sum should be paid in consequence of a bill lodged in Bank one or two months ago, and the bill of to-day should be paid one or two months hence. The following statement will, in some measure, explain this idea, by exhibiting half-monthly the balances of public money in all the banks, about the middle and end of each month, beginning with May, 1792, and ending with December of the same year:

“The fourth resolution has arisen from that part of the printed Report which remarks that the residue of the sum drawn from Holland, amounting to $1,668,188 27 is applicable to the purchase of the public debt. It is known that the sum of $1,374,656 40, being the surplus of the revenue up to the end of December, 1790, was originally appropriated to the Sinking Fund; that the surplus of other appropriations have been applied to this fund, and that the interest of the debt purchased has also been wholly appropriated to its increase. It is also known that between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, and no more, of the original appropriation, have been really invested in the purchase of the debt; it is, therefore, somewhat unaccountable that so large a sum as $1,668,188 should be drawn from the loans abroad, when the Sinking Fund has always overflowed from domestic resources, and when the probability of purchasing is extremely lessened by the rise in the price of paper and the limitations of the last act of Congress upon that subject. It would not be deemed an economical arrangement to make a loan of so large a sum of money upon terms by no means honorable or advantageous, and appropriate it to the purchase of the debt under limitations which would forbid its investiture. The information called for in this resolution may possibly explain these difficulties.  
“The fifth and last resolution has arisen from that part of the printed Report … which states the whole sums drawn from Holland to amount to $2,304,769 13; but neither immediately presents to view the balance on hand, nor informs where that balance is deposited. It appears by the Bank-book, that the whole deposite of the United States in Bank at this time, from all resources, amounts to $790,642 11. Hence, it will appear from a statement partly conjectural, and partly founded upon the statements in the printed Report, and some official documents, that $1,554,-851 43 remain unaccounted for, as will appear from the following account:  
“Sums which ought to be in the Treasury.  
  
  
  
  
Whole moneys drawn from Holland, as stated in the printed Report,  
$2,304,769  
  
  
Deduct paid for St. Domingo, as stated in printed Report,  
 455,263  
  
  
  Leaves a balance of  
1,859,506

1,668.190

400,000  
  
  
Add surplus of revenue of 1792, reported at  
 277,385  
  
  
  Whole amount  
2,345,495  
  
  “Sums not taken into this estimate: First. Any moneys not paid of the $191,316, due to foreign officers. Second. So much moneys in Bank as arose from the revenues. Third. The receipts of the current year.  
  
From this aggregate sum of  
$2,345,495  
  
  
Deduct in Bank  
 790,642  
  
  
  Balance not accounted for  
1,554,853  
  
  
“In this last estimate, cents have not been taken into calculation, which makes an inconsiderable variation in some of the sums.  
“Another circumstance appears somewhat singular: in the printed Report, 2,986,000 florins are stated to have been drawn from Holland in the year 1792. In the Bank-book, it appears from the list of bills drawn, that 8,695,237 florins were drawn for in the same time. This difference, I presume, may admit of explanation probably from the manner of negotiating this matter, or from some casual mistake. It deserves, however, to be explained.  
“It appears from another statement, made up to the 1st of April, 1793, that there ought to be at that time a sufficient sum of money in the Treasury to reimburse the loan of 2,000,000 dollars to the Bank, and to answer all the other purposes of Government.

“The papers from which I have collected these statements may be deceptive in themselves, or may be subject to explanations from others. Candor, however, induces me to acknowledge that impressions resulting from my inquiries into this subject, have been made upon my mind, by no means favorable to the arrangements made by the gentleman at the head of the Treasury Department. But I shall keep myself open to conviction, in case of any sufficient explanation which may be hereafter given, and I now avow that my acknowledgment of mistake shall be at least commensurate to any conviction produced.  
“I cannot help remarking, before I sit down, that we have been legislating for some years without competent official knowledge of the state of the Treasury, or revenues; in the course of which time, we have been engaged in the most important fiscal arrangements; that we have authorized a loan of the Bank of the United States for more than $500,000, when probably a greater sum of public money was deposited in the Bank; that we have passed a vote this session, authorizing a further loan for $800,000, and that we were upon the point of authorizing a loan abroad for $2,000,000, without knowing the extent of the authorities at present existing for borrowing, the amount of moneys on hand in consequence of loans already made, or the application of the moneys which may have been used; and I conceive it is now time that this information be officially laid before this House.”

n Jefferson’s handwriting. Giles modified these resolutions somewhat and submitted them to the House of Representatives on February 27, 1793. The resolutions read as follows:  
“1. Resolved, That it is essential to the due administration of the Government of the United States, that laws making specific appropriations of money should be strictly observed by the administrator of the finances thereof.  
“2. Resolved, That a violation of a law making appropriations of money, is a violation of that section of the Constitution of the United States which requires that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.  
“3. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury has violated the law passed the 4th of August, 1790, making appropriations of certain moneys authorized to be borrowed by the same law, in the following particulars, viz: First, By applying a certain portion of the principal borrowed to the payment of interest falling due upon that principal, which was not authorized by that or any other law. Secondly, By drawing part of the same moneys into the United States, without the instructions of the President of the United States.  
“4. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury has deviated from the instructions given by the President of the United States, in exceeding the authorities for making loans under the acts of the 4th and 12th of August, 1790.  
“5. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury has omitted to discharge an essential duty of his office, in failing to give Congress official information in due time, of the moneys drawn by him from Europe into the United States; which drawing commenced December, 1790, and continued till January, 1793; and of the causes of making such drafts.  
“6. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury has, without the instructions of the President of the United States, drawn more moneys borrowed in Holland into the United States than the President of the United States was authorized to draw, under the act of the 12th of August, 1790; which act appropriated two millions of dollars only, when borrowed, to the purchase of the Public Debt: And that he has omitted to discharge an essential duty of his office, in failing to give official information to the Commissioners for purchasing the Public Debt, of the various sums drawn from time to time, suggested by him to have been intended for the purchase of the Public Debt.  
“7. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury did not consult the public interest in negotiating a Loan with the Bank of the United States, and drawing therefrom four hundred thousand dollars, at five per cent. per annum, when a greater sum of public money was deposited in various banks at the respective periods of making the respective drafts.  
“8. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury has been guilty of an indecorum to this House, in undertaking to judge of its motives in calling for information which was demandable of him, from the constitution of his office; and in failing to give all the necessary information within his knowledge, relatively to the subjects of the reference made to him of the 19th January, 1792, and of the 22d November, 1792, during the present session.  
“9. Resolved, That a copy of the foregoing resolutions be transmitted to the President of the United States.”  
Of the nine resolutions presented by Giles, seven were incorporated from Jefferson’s draft without substantive change. The sections of the Jefferson draft which were either modified or omitted by Giles read as follows:  
“3. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury, in drawing to this country and lodging in the bank the funds raised in Europe, which ought to have been applied to the paiments of our debts there in order to stop interest, has violated the instructions of the President of the United States for the benefit of speculators and to increase the profits of that institution.  
  
“9. Resolved; That at the next meeting of Congress, the act of Sep 2d, 1789, establishing a Department of Treasury should be so amended as to constitute the office of the Treasurer of the United States a separate department, independent of the Secretary of the Treasury.  
“10. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury has been guilty of maladministration in the duties of his office, and should, in the opinion of Congress, be removed from his office by the President of the United States

THESE Refolulions have grown out of  
the embarraffinents I have met with,  
in attempting to comprehend the report  
of the secretary of the treasury made in  
pursuance of an order of this house of the  
27th of December 1-92, exhibiting sun­  
dry statements refpefting foreign loans.  
These embarraiTnents nave increased in  
proportion to the attention which I have  
bellowed an the fubjecl ; and a number  
of offici i! papers to which I have had re­  
ference for information, instead of elu­  
cidating fee n rather to obfcnre the inqui­  
ry. To obtain necefi&#x27;iry information  
therefore is the objcft of these resolutions,  
and no one can doubt the immediate ap­  
plicability of this information to a bill now  
lying upon your table, for the purpose ot  
reimbur ing the loan of : 000.000 of Dol­  
lars made of the bank of the United States,  
by opening a new loan for that Ann abroad  
and by changing the application of the  
like film already borrowed and appropria­  
ted to the discharge of the debt to France  
from its original destination, to the imme­  
diate difchar-je of the debt to the bank.  
The fir t resolution has arisen from that  
part of the pri ntcd report of the secretary  
of the treasury which exhibits the termsup­  
which various loans have been made a­  
broad, but neither presents the precise au­  
thorities under which those negotiations  
have been made, nor the precise amount  
of the sums borrowed for the separate and  
diftinft obje&amp;s of the two a£ts mentioned  
in the resolution.  
/.TOthJTi&quot;&quot;his Tr»g­  
gefted the p &#x27; &gt;pri ty of calling for the in­  
formation requeued by this resolution.—  
The bill now upon your table which has  
been before alluded to, contemplates the  
whole of the monies borrowed abroad and  
now on hand, as being originally appro­  
priated to the discharge of the French  
deb:, and proposes to change the original  
destination of these identical monies ; and  
the reason assigned for this measure has  
been the unsettled state of affairs in  
France.  
In the printed report, the secretary of  
the treasury remarks that the fame monies  
are applicable to the finking fund.—lt ap­  
pears Itrange that after express and dif­  
tinft appropriations by law, that any mif­  
underrtanding relative to this object,  
should cxiit, and the information called  
for may poflibly explain this seeming  
contradiction-  
The second resolution has arisen from  
that part of the printed report marked B.  
and which exhibits the payments made to  
France, but does not furnifh the names of  
theperfons engaged in those negociations,  
nor does it present to view the length of  
time these persons have been poffelled of  
the public monies by dating the dates of  
the refpeftive draughts in Holland and ihe  
dates of the attual application of the mo­  
nies to the discharge of the debt, and it  
is evident that from the times the loans  
are refpettively created, to the times of  
the attual application of the monies bor­  
rowed, the United States are paying the  
usual interest upon the debt intended to  
be redeemed, and the stipulated interest  
upon the iponies borrowed for the re­  
demption.—This remark is equally appli­  
cable to the payments of other foreign  
debts with the payments of the debt to  
France.  
The third resolution has arisen from  
calculations drawn partly from the last  
page of the printed report, and from the  
original Bank book of the U. States,from  
which it appears that the balances,in bank,  
in favour of the United States were as  
. follow :

By P. FRENEAU: Publijhtd Wednesdays an,l Saturdays, at Three Dollars per annum  
  
On the lftofjune, a loan was negoci­  
ated with the bank of the United States  
oil the part of the United States for  
100,000 dollars at five per cent, per ann  
On the rirfl of July another loan was made  
upon the fame terms for the like sum.—  
Oil the firft of August another loan was  
made upon the fame terms for the like  
film. It appears- from the lad page of  
the printed report that there had been  
drawn into America from the r sth of De­  
cember 1-90 to the 27 th of January 1 ;&gt;O2 ol  
the monies oorrowed abroad, the sum ol  
2.663,63 1 florins,s3 stiver?, and 6 deniers.  
If this sum were unexpended and lodged  
in the bank at the times of making these  
loan?, (and Congrefi ha.- e never yet beec  
i lformed of any deficiency of revenue) the  
United States will of consequence have  
paid upon the monies borrow ed from the  
bank of the United States from ij to 1;  
per cent, per ann, to wit, they will have  
paid 5 per rent upon the original debt tc  
France, j per cent upon tiie monies bor­  
rowed for its redemption, excluiive oi  
douceurs and other charges, and 5 pc;  
cent, upon the fain borrowed of the bank,  
which inay be deemed part of thisdepo­  
lit made in the bar:k by the United State  
but even discarding these inferences, i  
mull be admitted, that the U. States ar&lt;  
paving 5 per cent upon a loan made o:  
the bank, when a depolit of a greater fun  
than the amount of the loan, has always  
been in bank on the part of the U. States.  
It is here tobe remarked, that a b ilancc  
as cafli is admitted, by the tre.ifurer&#x27;s re­  
turn, to have been in his hands jilt De­  
cember 1-00, amounting to 973.343 dolls.  
$3 cents, and in July 30th 1791, the sum oi  
582,189 dollars, 54 cents.  
I am informed that bills are often dr iwi:  
in favour of the bank for monies in the  
iands of the revenue officers in difianl  
sarts of the United States and that credi:  
s entered in the bank book upon the re­  
:eipt of fnch bills, although the nionie:  
may not aflwally be in bank for some tin*  
iffer tTre credit is entered, arfd hencfi it i:  
nferred, that the bankbook does not con­  
ilulivcly Ihew the real sum in bank,—not  
:o mention thai such bills answer all the  
jurpoles of calh and ought therefore to be  
:redited upon the receipt of them. It is  
:o be remarked that there is a regular  
md continual influx of monies into the  
sank by. tbe operation of these bills.—lt i:  
not very material whether a bill lodged  
nbank to day, (hould be paid t» day, pro­  
vided fomethi &quot;3 like the fame sum should  
i&gt;e paid in consequence of a bill lodged in  
sank one or t.v ) months ago, and the bill  
aftoday tliould be paid one or two months  
ience. The following statement will, in  
&quot;ome measure, explain this idea by exhi­  
biting half monthly the balances of public  
monies 111 all the banks, about the middle  
ind end of each month: beginning witi

The fourth resolution has arisen from  
hat part of the printed report which re­  
narks that the residue of the sum drawh  
rom Holland amounting to 1,668,188 dol­  
ars 27 cents is applicable to the pur chest  
■f the public debt. It is know n that the  
um of 1,3-4, 656 dollars 40 cents, beina  
:he surplus of the revenue up to the end  
ni December 1-90, was originally appro­  
priated to the finking fund, that tile sur­  
plus of other appropriations have been ap­  
plied to this fund, and that the interell ol  
the debt purchased has also been wholl)  
appropriated to its incrcafe : It is alfc  
known, that between 11 and 12 hundred  
thousand dollars, and no more, of the o­  
rijjinal appropriation, have been really in­  
verted in the purchase of the debt; it is  
therefore somewhat unaccountable that so  
largeafuin as i,66B,ißßdollars should be  
drawn from the loans abroad When  
the linking fund has always overflowed  
  
from domestic resources, and when the  
pre liability of purchasing is extremely lef­  
fcricd by the rile in the price of papei* am!  
Chd limitations of the lalt ast of Congref:  
lipid that subject. It would not be decm­  
d mi o?conomical arrangement to make a  
lor,hi of so large a sum of money Upon  
fins by no means honourable or advan­  
and appropriate it to the pur­  
.fe ot the debt under limitations which  
S&#x27;.&#x27;-ukl forbki Its invefiituie The inior­  
lu tion called for in this resolution mav  
rtfibly exp in tliefe difficulties.  
The fifth&#x27;ar.&lt;i last resolution has arisen  
roin that par: of the printed report (page  
sth.) which ftaiesthe whole sums drawn  
roin Holland to amount to 2.304,760 doi­  
u&#x27;. 13 cents; but neither immediately

We official documents, that 1,554,851

In this lalt ellimate cents have not been  
:aken into calculut on, which makes an in-  
Lonliderable variation infome of the sums.  
Another circumlTance appears fome­  
ivhat lingular; 111 the printed report  
!,956,000 florins are stated to have been  
•Irawn from Holland in the year 1792.—  
In the bank book it appears from the lift  
as bill&#x27; drawn, that 8,695,137 florins were  
:lrawn for in tile fame time. This differ­  
ence I presume may admit of explanati­  
on, probably from the manner of negotia­  
ting this buiinefs, or from fpme casual mis­  
take. It deserves however to be ex­  
plained.  
It appears from another fotement made  
up to the Ift of ,4pril 1793, that there  
ought to beat that time a fufficient sum of  
money in the treasury to reimburse the  
loanof 2,000,000 to the bank, and to an­  
swer all the other purposes of govern­  
ment.

means favourable to the arrangements  
made by the gentleman at the head of the  
treasury department. But I fliall keep

10 mention the&#x27; rcafons, which have influenced me  
in moving them ; the resolutions are as follow :  
  
Resolved, that&#x27;the President of the United  
States be requested to cause to be laid before this  
House, copies of the authorities under which  
loans have been negociated, pursuant to the a&amp;s  
of the 4th and 12th of August 1790, together  
with copies of the authorities dire&lt;Sting the ap­  
plication of the monies borrowed.  
Resolved, That the President of the United  
States be requested to cause this House to be fur­  
niflied with the names of the persons by whom,  
and to whom, the refpe&amp;ive payments of the  
Frcnch debt have been made in France, pursu­  
ant to the a6b for that purpose, fpecifpng tne  
dates of the refpeftive draughts upon the com­  
miftioners in Holland, and the dates of thfc re­  
fpe&amp;ive payments of the debts : A similar state­  
ment is requested, refpedling the debts to Spain  
and Holland.  
  
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury  
be dire&amp;ed to lay before the this house, an ac­  
count, exhibiting half-monthly, the balances be­  
tween the United States and the bank of the  
United States, including the several branch  
banks, from the commencement of those insti­  
tutions to the end of the year 179 a.  
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury  
be dire&amp;cd to lay before this House an account  
of all monies, which may have come into the  
finking fund, from the commencement ©f that  
inilitution, to the present time, fpecifying the  
particular fund from which they have accrued,  
and exhibiting, half yearly, the sums uninvest­  
ed, and where deposited.  
  
Resolved, that the Secretary of the treasury  
be dire&amp;ed to report to this House the balance  
of the unapplied revenues, at the end of the year  
179*» fpecifying whether in money or bonds,  
and noting where the money is   
he also make report of all unapplied revenues,  
which may have been obtained by the several  
loans authorifedby law, and where such monies  
are now deposited. r-b  
  
Thcfe resolutions have grown out of thfc em­  
barraflVnents I have met with, in attempting to  
comprehend the report 0$ tnefecretaiy of the  
irealuiy, made ;n pursuance;&quot;of an order of this  
ho&#x27;lie, of the 27th of December 1792, exjjibitr  
ing fuudry ilatements refpc&amp;ing foieign loans.  
Thtle embarri»ffine»»ls have increased in pro­  
portion to the attention which I have bestowed  
on the fubj&lt; ft ; and a number of official papers  
to which I have had refeience tot information;  
instead of elucidating ft em rathefuo oblcurethe  
ei.qu.iy. To obtain neceflary information there­  
l6&gt;e is the objet* ol tl&gt;cfc resolutions, and no one  
con doubt the immediate applicability this  
in tor (nation to a bill now lying upon your ta­  
ble, tor the purpose of reirnbuifjng the loan of  
2,000,000 of Uollais made ol the Bank of the  
Lniied States, by opening a new loan for that  
sum abroad, and by changing the application of  
the like ium already borrowed and appropri­  
atcd to the difcliarge of the debt to France from  
its original defoliation, to the iiif»  
charge of the&lt;ieht to the B&lt;\nk.  
  
The hti\ resolution has anfen from that pait  
of the printed report of thcfccrctary of liic trea­  
sury, which exhibits the terms upon which va­  
rious loans have been made abroad, but neither  
pre&#x27;ents the pt cafe authorities under which thofc  
negocia&#x27;.&#x27;.ons have been made, nor the precise  
amount ol the sums borrowed lor the fparate  
and diUm£t objects ol the two a£ls mentioned in  
l.he resolution.  
  
Aupihcr reason has more strongly suggested  
the propriety of calling !or the information re­  
quelled by this resolution. The b&gt;ll now upcu  
your table which has been before alluded to,  
contemplates the whole of the monies borrow­  
ed abroad and now on hund, as being originally  
  
278  
  
appropriated to thedifshargeof the Trench deht,  
and proposes to change the orig.nal dell,nation  
of these identical monies and the reason ani&lt;*n­  
ed for this mea-fure has been the unfctilcd Hate  
of affairs in trance.  
In the printed report, the Secretary or the  
T.eafury,remarks that the fame monies arc ap.  
plicalilc to tire finking fund. It appears Hrange  
after express and dift&#x27;n£l appropriations by  
taw, that anv mifunderftunding relative to this  
ohirft, rfionl&#x27;d cxift, and the information called  
lor may poflTMy explain this teeming contradic-  
  
&#x27;I&#x27;he fccond resolution has anfen from that  
pa*t of thr printed report marked B. and which  
exhibits the payments made to France, but does  
not furnifh the names of the persons engaged in  
those negociations; nor docs it present to view  
the length of timt those peifous have bicn p»f­  
fciTed ot the public monies bv stating the dates  
of the refpeflive draiijjhis in Holland and the  
dates of the afiual application of the monies to  
the discharge of the debt, and it is evident that  
from the timrsthc loans are refpeflively created,  
to the times of the actual application of the mo­  
nies borrowed, the United States are paying the  
usual interest upon the debt intended to be le­  
deemcd, and the stipulated interest. upon .he mo.  
nies borrowed for the redemption.—This re-  
  
mark is equally applicable to the payments of  
other foreran debts with the payments of the  
debt to Fiance.  
  
The third resolution has arisen from calcula­  
tions drawn partly from the iali page of lhe  
printed report, and from the original Bank  
book of the United States, from which it appears  
that the balances in Bank in favor of the United  
States, were as follows  
  
n Bank Philadelphia, 30th May?)  
1792, and 16th June fame year V 676,959 55  
in Branch Banks, )  
79?, June 30th, in all Banks in  
  
the United States, 555«27l 22  
July 28th and 31 ft in do. 511*423 91  
August 25th, 30th and 31ft,  
1 &#x27; in do,  
  
— . . • I &#x27;Z7~O. ~ &#x27;  
On the Hrfl of June, a loan was negocwited  
yith the Bank of the United Slates on the pait  
of the United States tor 100,000 dolls, at 5 per  
cent, per ann. On the firft of July another lo«m  
was made upon the fame terms for the like sum.  
On the lft of August another loan was made  
upon the fame terms for the like sum. On the  
lft of September another loan was made upon  
the fame terms for i!ie like sum. It appears  
from the last page of the printed report, that  
there had been drawn intoAmcrica from theisth  
of December, 1790, to the 27th of January, 1792,  
of the monies borrowed abroad, the sum of  
2,663,621 florins, 2 stivers, and 6 deniers. If  
this sum were unexpended and lodged in the  
bank at the times of making tbefe loans (and  
Congress have never yet been informed oT any  
deficiency of revenue) the United States will of  
confluence have paid upon the monies bor­  
rowed from the Bank of the United States, from  
15 to 17 per cent, per nun. to wit, they will have  
paid 5 per cent upon the original debt to France,  
5 per cent, upon the monies borrowed for its  
redemption, exclusive of douceurs and other  
charges, and 5 per cent, upon the sum borrowed  
of the bank, which may be deemed pact of this  
dcpofit made in the bank by the United States.  
But even dticarding these inferences, it mult be  
admitted that the United States have been pay­  
ing 5 per cent, upon a loan made of the bank,  
when a greater sum than the loan made, has  
been at all times depofiled in bank on the pait  
of the United States.  
  
It is here to be remaikcd, that a balance of caih  
is admitted, by the Treasurer&#x27;s return, to have  
been in his hands 3111 December, 1790, amount­  
ing to 973 342 dolls. 43 cents, and in July 30th,  
1791, the fuin of 582,189 dollars, 54 cents.  
I am informed that bills are often drawn in  
favour of the bank lor monies in the hands of  
the revenue officers in distant parts of the United  
Statfs, and that credit is entered in the bank  
book upon the receipt of such bills, although the  
monies may not a&amp;ually be in bank for some  
time after the credit i* entered, and hence jt is  
inferred, that the bank book does not conclu­  
sively (how the real sum in bank—not to men­  
tion that such bills answer all the purposes of  
cafb, and ought theiefore to be credited upon  
the receipt of them. It is to be remarked that  
theie is a regular and continual influx of monies  
into the bank by the operation of chefe bills.—  
»It ismotvery material Whether a biH lodged in  
bank to-day, should be paid to-day, provided  
fornethiug like the fame sum (hould be paid in  
consequence of a bill lodged in bank one or two  
  
months ago, and the bill of to-dav, should be  
  
paid one or two months hence. The following  
flatement will, in some incafure explain this  
idea, by exhibiting half-monthly the balances of  
public monies in all the banks, about the mid­  
dle and end of each month; beginning with  
May 1792, and ending with December of the  
lame year.

phcabtc ta the pur chafe of the public debt. It is  
known that the sum ol 1,374.656 dollars 40  
cents, being the furpius of the revenue up to the  
endlo; December 1790, was originally appropri­  
ated to the finking fund ; t|l-t t|,c fur pi us of  
other appiopriations have been applied to this  
fund, and that the intereil of the debt purchased  
has alio been wholly appropriated to its in­  
crcafc : Xt is also known, that between 11 and  
  
12 hundred thousand dollars, and no mi  
the original appropriation, have bem  
verted in the purchase of the debt, it i, lh &#x27; \
somewhat unaccountable that f.» U,.r &#x27; ,

appears from the lift of bills- drawn, tl  
8,695,137 fiorins were drawn for in the si

of explanation, probably from the manner

mistake. It deserves however to beexplain
