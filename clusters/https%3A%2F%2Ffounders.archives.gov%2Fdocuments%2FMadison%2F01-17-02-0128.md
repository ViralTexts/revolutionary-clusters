In the House of Delegates  
  
Friday Decr. 21st. 1798.  
Resolved, that the General Assembly of Virginia doth unequivocally express a firm resolution to maintain and defend the constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of this state, against every aggression, either foreign or domestic, and that they will support the government of the United States in all measures, warranted by the former.  
That this Assembly most solemnly declares a warm attachment to the Union of the States, to maintain which, it pledges all its powers; and that for this end, it is their duty, to watch over and oppose every infraction of those principles, which constitute the only basis of that union, because a faithful observance of them, can alone secure its existence, and the public happiness.  
That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government, as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties; as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact; as no farther valid than they are authorised by the grants enumerated in that compact, and that in case of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties there-to have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the pro⟨gress⟩ of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.  
That the General Assembly doth also express its deep regret that a spirit has in sundry instances, been manifested by the federal government, to enlarge its powers by forced constructions of the constitutional charter which defines them; and that indications have appeared of a design to expound certain general phrases (which having been copied from the very limited grant of powers in the former articles of confederation were the less liable to be misconstrued) so as to destroy the meaning and effect of the particular enumeration, which necessarily explains and limits the general phrases; and so as to consolidate the states by degrees into one sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevitable consequence of which would be, to transform the present republican system of the United States, into an absolute, or at best a mixed monarchy.  
That the General Assembly doth particularly protest against the palpable and alarming infractions of the constitution, in the two late cases of the “alien and sedition acts,” passed at the last session of Congress; the first of which exercises a power no where delegated to the federal government; and which by uniting legislative and judicial powers, to those of executive, subverts the general principles of free government, as well as the particular organization and positive provisions of the federal constitution: and the other of which acts, exercises in like manner a power not delegated by the constitution, but on the contrary expressly and positively forbidden by one of the amendments thereto; a power which more than any other ought to produce universal alarm, because it is levelled against that right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free communication among the people thereon, which has ever been justly deemed, the only effectual guardian of every other right.  
That this State having by its convention which ratified the federal constitution, expressly declared, “that among other essential rights, the liberty of conscience and of the press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by any authority of the United States” and from its extreme anxiety to guard these rights from every possible attack of sophistry or ambition, having with other states recommended an amendment for that purpose, which amendment was in due time annexed to the Constitution, it would mark a reproachful inconsistency and criminal degeneracy, if an indifference were now shewn to the most palpable violation of one of the rights thus declared and secured, and to the establishment of a precedent which may be fatal to the other.  
That the good people of this Commonwealth having ever felt and continuing to feel the most sincere affection for their bretheren of the other states, the truest anxiety for establishing and perpetuating the union of all, and the most scrupulous fidelity to that Constitution which is the pledge of mutual friendship, and the instrument of mutual happiness, the General Assembly doth solemnly appeal to the like dispositions of the other States, in confidence that they will concur with this Commonwealth in declaring, as it does hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid are unconstitutional, and that the necessary and proper measures will be taken by each, for cooperating with this State in maintaining unimpaired the authorities, rights, and liberties, reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.  
That the Governor be desired to transmit a copy of the foregoing resolutions to the Executive authority of each of the other States, with a request, that the same may be communicated to the Legislature thereof.  
And that a copy be furnished to each of the Senators and Representatives, representing this State in the Congress of the United States.

VIRCtNIA, to wit.  
In the House of Delegates,  
Friday, December 21st, 1798.  
Resolved, that the General Assembly of  
Virginia doth unequivocally express a firm  
resolution to maintain and defend the consti­  
tution of the United States, and the consti­  
tution of this ltate, against every aggreffionj  
either foreign or domestic, and that they will  
support the government of the United States  
■ in all measures, warranted by the former.  
That this Assembly most solemnly declares  
a warm attachment to the union of the  
dates, to maintain which, it pledges all its  
powers ; and that for this end, it is their du­  
; ty, to watch over and oppose every infrac­  
tion ofthofe principles, whichconfiitute tbe  
only basis of that union, bccaufe a faithful  
observance of them, can alone secure its ex­  
iHence, and the public happiness.  
That this Affeiftbly doth explicitly and  
peremptorily declare, that it views the pow­  
ers of the Federal- as resulting  
from the ccmpadt, tp which the states are  
parties ; as limited by the plain sense and  
j. intention of the infirument Constituting that  
compact; aj no farther valid hbc.n they art  
authorised by the grants enumerated in that  
compact, and that in cafe of a deliberated,  
palpable and dangerous exercile of other pow­  
ers not granted by the said compad, the  
states who are parties thereto hare the right,  
and are in duty bound, to interpose for ar­  
resting tbe.progress of tie evil, and for Main­  
taining within their refpeftive &#x27;limits, the  
authorities, rights and liberties appertaining  
to them.  
That the General Assembly doth also ex­  
press its deep regret that a spirit has in sun­  
dry instances, been manifested by tbe Federal  
■ Government, to enlarge its powers by forced  
j constructions of the constitutional charter  
! which defines them; and that indications  
! have appeared of a design to expound cer­  
! tain general phrases (which having been  
| copied from the very limited grant of pow­  
ers in the former articles of confederation  
were the less liable tb be misconstrued) so as  
to destroy the meaning and effeft of the par­  
ticular enumeration, which necessarily ex­  
: plains and limits the general phrases ; and so  
as to consolodatt tbe states by degrees into  
one soweignty, the obvious tendency and  
inevitable confluence of which would be,  
to transform tbe present republican system  
of tbe United States, into an absolute, or at  
best a mixed monarchy.  
I hat the General Assembly doth particu­  
larly protest against tbe palpable and alarm­  
ing infract ions of tbe constitution, in the  
two late cases of the &quot; Alien and Sedition  
acts,&quot; passed at the last feflion of Congress ;  
the firft of which exe(cifes a power no where  
delegated to tbe Federal Government; and  
which, by uniting legislative and judicial  
powers to those of executive, fubyerts the  
general principles of free government, as  
well as the particular organization and posi­  
tive proviiions of the federal constitution :  
and the other of which afts, exercises in like  
manner a power not delegated by tbe consti­  
tution, but on the contrary expressly and  
positively forbidden by one of the amend­  
ments thereto; a power which more than  
any other ought to produce universal alarm,  
because it is levelled against that right of  
freely examining public characters and mea­  
sures, and of free communication among tbe  
people thereon, which has ever been justly  
deemed, the only effectual guardian of every  
other right.  
That this state having by its convention  
which ratified the federal constitution, ex­  
pressly declared,&quot; that among other essential  
rights, the liberty of conscience and of the  
press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrain­  
ed or modified by any authority of the Uni­  
ted States,&quot; and from its extreme anxiety  
to guard these rights from every poflible at­  
tack of sophistry or ambition, having with  
other states recommended an amendment for  
that purpofe,-which amendment was in-due  
time annexed to the constitution, it would  
mark a reproachful inconsistency and criminal  
degeneracy, if an indifference were now shewn  
tp the most palpable violation of one of The  
rights thus declared and fecured,and to thfe  
eftablilhment of a precedent which may be  
fatal to tbe other.  
That the good people of this Common­  
wealth having ever- felt and continuing so  
feel the most iincere affection to their bre­  
thren of the other states, the truest anxiety  
for feftablifhing and perpetuating the union  
of all, and the most scrupulous fidelity to  
that constitution which i; the pledge of mu­  
tual friendship, and the instrument of mutu­  
al happiness : The General Assembly doth  
solemnly appeal to the like dispositions of  
other states, in confidence that they will con­  
cur with this commonwealth in declaring, as  
it does bertby declare, that the acts aforesaid  
are unconstitutional, k that tbe necessary and  
proper measures will be taken by each, for  
co-operating with this state, in maintaining  
unimpaired the authorities, rights and liber­  
ties, reserved to the states refpeclively, or to  
the people.  
1 hat the Governor be de fired to transmit  
a copy of the foregoirt* resolutions to the  
Executive Authority of each of the other  
states, with a re que ft, that the fame, ntay be  
communicated to the Legillature thereof.  
And. that a copy be furnifhed to each .of  
the Senators and Representatives, reprefent-&#x27;  
ing this state in the Congress of-the United  
States. ,Attest,

more than any other, ought to produce  
universal alarm &gt; becaufe it is levelled

IN THE  
  
VIRGINIA HOUSE OF  
  
DELEGATES,  
  
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1798.  
  
RESOLVED, that the general  
aflembly of Virginia, doth une-  
quivocally exprefs a firm refolution  
to maintain and defend the confti-  
tution of the United States, and  
the conftitution of this ftate, a-  
gainft every aggreffion either fo-  
reign or domeftic, and that they  
will fupport the government of  
the United States in all meafures  
warranted by the former.  
  
Tuar this aflembly moft fo-  
lemnly declares a warm attach-  
ment to the union of the ftates,  
to maintain which it pledges its  
powers ; and that for this end, it  
is their duty to watch over afid  
oppofe every infraction of thofe

pofe, fer arrefting the progrefs of

2. Resolved, ‘That the General Assembly most solemnly declares a  
  
warin attachment to the Unton of the States. to maintaim which it pledges  
  
all its powers ; and that, for this end, it is their duty to watch over aud:  
  
oppose every infraction of those principles which constitute the oaly  
basis of that Union, because a faithful observance of them can alone secure  
us existence and the public happiness.  
  
3. Resolved, That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily de-  
clare, that it views the powers of the Federal Government as resulting  
from the compact, to which the States are parties, as limited by the  
plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact, as  
no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in  
that compact ; and that, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and danger-  
ous, exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, THE  
Starrs who are purties thereto have the right, and are in duty bound,  
to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maititaining,  
within their respective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties, apper-  
taining to them.  
  
4. Resolced, That the General Assembly doth also express its deep  
regret that a spirit has, ip sundry instances, been manifested, by the Fe-  
deral Government, to enlarge its powers, by forced constructiens of the  
Constitutional Charter which defines them ; and that indications have ap-  
peared of a design to expound certain general phrases (which, having  
been copied from the very limited grant of powers in the former Arti-  
cles of Confederation, were the less liable to be miscoustrued,) So as to  
destroy the meaning and effect of the particular enumeration whieh  
necessarily explains and limits the general phrases, and se as to Conso-  
lidate the States, by degrees, into one Sovereignty—the obvious ten-  
dency and inevitable result of which would be to transform the present  
Republican System of the United States inte an absolute, ur, at best, a  
mixed Monarchy.  
  
d. Resolved, That the General Assembly doth particularly protest  
against the palpable and alarming infractions of the Constitution in the  
two late cases of the “Alien aud Sedition Acts,” passed at the last ses-  
sion of Congress ; the first of which exercises a power no where dele-  
gated to the Federal Government, and which. by uniting Legislative  
and Judicial powers to those of Executive, subverts the general princi-  
ples of a free Government, as well as the particular organization and  
sitive provisions of the Federal Constitution; and the other of which acts  
exercises, in like manner, a power not delegated by the Constitution,  
but, on the contrary, expressly and positively forbidden by oue of the  
amendments thereto: a power which, more than any other, ought to be  
duce universal alarm, because it is levelled against that right of freely  
examining public characters and measures, aud of free counmunication  
among the people thereon, which has ever been justly deemed the only  
effectual guardian of every other right.  
  
6. Resolred, That this State, having, by itsConvention which ratified  
the Federal Constitution, expressly deck.red, that, among other essential  
rights, “the liberty of conscience and of the press cannot be cancelled,  
abridged, restrained, or modified, by any authority of the United States;”  
and, from its extreme anxiety to guard these rights from every possible  
attack of sophistry and ambition, having, with other States, recommend-  
ed an amendment for that purpose, which amendment was in due time  
annexed to the Constitution ; jt would mark a reproachfal inconsistency,  
and criminal degeneracy, if an indifference were now shown to the most  
palpable violation of one of the rights thus declared and secured, and te  
the establishment of a precedent which may be fital to the other.  
  
7. Resolved, ‘That the good people of this Commonwealth, having  
ever felt, and continuing to feel, the most sincere affection for their bre-  
tren of the other States—the truest anxiety for establishing and perpe-  
  
,t gating the Union of all—and the most scrupulous fidelity to that

December 21, 1798.  
Resolved, That the General Assembly ol  
Virginia do&#x27;ll unequivocally express a firm  
resoluti »n to maintain and defend the const itu­  
tion of the United State*&#x27;, and the constitution  
of this state against every aggression either for­  
eign or domestic; and that they will support  
the government of tne United States in all  
measures warranted by the former.  
That ihis Assembly most solemnly declares  
a warm attachment to the Union of the states,  
to maintain which it pledges its powers; and,  
that for this end, it is their duty to watch over  
and oppose every infraction of those principles  
which constitute the basis of that Union, be*  
cause a faithful observance of them can alone  
secure its existence and the public happiness.  
That this assembly doth explicitly and per  
emptorily declare, that it views the powers of  
the federal government, as resulting from the  
compact to which the states are parties; as  
limited by the plain sense and intention ot the  
instrument constituting that compact; as no  
farther valid than they are authorized by the  
grams enumerated in that compact; and that  
m case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangei*  
ous exercise of other pvwers, not granted b\
the said compact, the states, who are parties  
thereto, have the right, and arc in duty bound,  
to interpose, for arresting the progress ol the  
evil,and f«»r maintaining within their .respec­  
tive limits the authorities, rights, and liberties  
appertainin&#x27;! to them.  
  
j That the general assembly doth also express  
its deep regret, that a spirit has in sundry in­  
stances, been manifested by the federal govern­  
ment, to enlarge its powers by forced construc­  
tions of ihe constitutional churter which de­  
fines them; and, that indications have appear­  
1 &#x27;/ i to expound certain general H»*a­  
ses (whirJi, hiving (hu very  
limited grant of p.».. in the former arnc.es  
of confederation, were the less liable to be mis­  
construed,) so as to destroy the meaning and  
effect of the particular enumeration which ne­  
cessarily explains and limits the general phra­  
ses, and so as to consolidate the states by de­  
crees, into one sovereignty, the obvious tenden­  
iene v und inevitable result of which would be, &lt;  
o transform the present republican system of I j  
  
he United States, into ati absolute, Or at best,  
i mixed monarchy.  
That ihe general assembly doth particularly  
pr ilest against the palpable and alarming in­  
fractions of the constitution, in the two laic  
cases of the “alien and sedition acts” passed  
at the last session of Congress; the first nl  
which exercises a pcjwt r no where delegated t  
the federal g •vurnnieut, and which by uniting  
legislative and jutfeial powers to those of ex­  
ecutive, subverts the principles of free govern­  
ment, as well as the p or icnlar organization  
and positive provisiens f the federal constitu­  
tion; and the other, of which acts, exercises in  
like manner a power not delegated by the con­  
stituti .*n, but on the contrary, expressly anil  
positively firbidden by one of the amendments  
!tb/:,a potver, wl&#x27;.i ;h mo e thou any other,  
n ight to produce universal alarm; because it Is  
j; -veiled against ihe right of freely examining

having ever felt, and continuing to feel the most  
sincere affection for their brethren of the other  
States; the truest anxiety for establishing and per­  
petuating the union of all; and the most scrupu­  
lous fidelity to that Constitution, which is the  
pledge of mutual friendship, and the instrument of  
mutual happiness; the General Assembly doth  
solemnly appeal to the like dispositions in the oth­  
er States, in confidence that they will concur with  
this Commonwealth, in declaring, as it does here­  
by declare, that the acts aforesaid, are uanconstitne  
; and, that the necessary and proper meas­  
ures will be taken by each for co-operating with  
this State, in maintaining unimpaired the authori­  
ties, rights, and liberties, reserved to the States  
respectively, or to the People.  
That the Governor be desired to transmit a copy  
of the foregoing resolutions to the Executive author­  
ity of each of the other States, with a request that  
the same may be communicated to the Legislature  
thereof; and that a copy be furnished to each of  
the Senators and Representatives, representing this  
State in the Congress of the United States.  
Attest, JOHN StEWArT.  
1798, Dec. 24th. Agreed to by the Senate.

of Virginia, 1798.  
Resolved, That the General Assembly  
of Virginia, doth unequivocally express a  
firm resolution to maintain and defend  
the Constitution of the United States, and  
the Constitution of this State, against  
every aggression either foreign or do­  
mestic ; and that they will support the  
Government of the United States in all  
measures warranted by the former.  
That this Assembly most solemnly de­  
clares a warm atiachuitnl to the Union  
of the States, to maintain which, it pled­  
ges its powers; and, that for this end, it  
is their duty to watch over and oppose  
every infraction of thos principles which  
constitute the only basts f the- Union,  
because a faithful observance of them,  
e.un alone secure its existence and the  
public happiness.  
That this Assembly doth explicitly  
and peremptorily declare, That it views  
the powers of the Federal Government,  
as resulting from the Compact, to which  
the States are parties, as limited by the  
plain sense and intention of the instru­  
ment constituting that compact, as no  
farther valid than they are authorized by  
the grants enumerated in that compact;  
and that in case of a deliberate, palpable  
and dangerous exercise of other powers,  
not granted by the said compact, the  
States who are parties thereto, hae the  
right, and are in doty bound, to interpose,  
for arresting the progress of the evil, ami  
for maintaing within tlioir respective  
limits, the authorities, rights and libeities  
Appertaining to them.  
That the General Assembly doth also  
express its deep regret, that a spirit bus,  
in aunlav instances, been manifested by  
the Federal Government to enlarge its  
powers by forced constructions of the  
constitutional character which defines  
them; agd, that indications have appear  
ed of a design to expound certain gener  
al phrases (whtch, having been copied  
from the very limited grant of powers in  
the former nrticles of confederation were  
the less liable to be misconstrued,) o as  
to destroy tho meaning and effect, of the  
particular enumeration which necessarily  
explains, and limits the general phrases,  
and so ns to consolidate the States by de  
grees, into one sovereignty, the obvious  
tendency and inevitable result of which  
would be, to transform the present Re  
publican system of the United States&#x27; into  
an absolute, or at besi, a mi ted monarchy  
That the General Assembly doth par  
ticularly protest against the palpable and  
alarming infractions oi tho Constitution,  
in the two late cases of the &#x27;&#x27;Alien and  
Sedition Acts,&quot; passed at the last session  
of Congress ; the first of which exercises  
a power no where delegated to the Fed  
eral Government; and which bytiniting  
  
legislative and judicial powers to those  
of executive, subverts the general prin­  
ciples of free Government, as well as the  
&#x27; particular organization and positive pro­  
visions of the Federal Constitution ; and  
the other of which acts, exercises in like  
manner, a power not delegated, by the  
Constitution, but on the contrary, ex­  
pressly and positively forbidden by one  
of the amendments thereto; a power,  
which, more than any other, ought to pro-  
, duce universal alarm, because it is lev­  
elled against the rights of freely exam­  
ining public characters and measures,  
and of free communication among the  
people thereon, which has eer been  
justly. deemed the only effectual .guardian  
of every other right.  
That ,this Stale having by its Conven­  
tion, which ratified the Federal Consti­  
tution, expressly declared, that among  
other essential rights, &quot;the liberty of  
conscience and the press cannot be can­  
celled, abridged, restrained, or modified  
by any authority of the United States,&quot;  
and from its extreme anxiety to guard  
these rights from every possible attack  
of sophistry and ambition, having w it&#x27;ll  
other States, recommended an amend­  
ment for that purpose, which amend­  
ment was, in due time, annexed to the  
Constitution, it would mark a reproach­  
ful inconsistency, and criminal degene­  
racy, if an indifference were now shown,,  
to the most palpable violation of one of  
the rights, thus declared and secured;  
and to the establishment of a precedent  
which may be fatal to the other.  
That the good people of this common  
  
wealth, having ever felt, and continuing  
to feel the most sincere affection for their  
brethren of the other51 States; the truest  
anxiety for establishing arid perpetuat­  
ing the union of all; and the most scru­

December ill, 1798.  
Hi solved, That the General Assembly of  
\ irginia doth tincquivocallv express a iirm  
resolution to maintain atul defcinl the (&#x27; in­  
stitution of the Fnited States, and the Con­  
stitution ot this state, atrainst every auir re.-• -  
ion either foreign or domestic ; ami that thev  
will support the G.overnment of the United  
States in all measures warranted by the for­  
mer.  
That the Assembly most solemlv declares  
a warm attachment to the Union of the States,  
to maintain which, it pledges its powers ; and  
that, for this end, it is their dutv to watch  
over an oppose ever;/ infraction o f Ikose prin­  
ciples icltich constitute the only basis of that  
l iiion—because a faithful observance id&#x27;  
them eat) alone secure its existence and the  
public happiness.  
That tliis Assembly doth explicitly and  
peremptorily declare, that it views the pow­  
ers ol the Federal Government as resulting  
front the compact to which the States are  
parlies, a- limited by the plain sense and in­  
tention of the instrument constituting that  
compact, as no farther valid than they are  
authorized by the grants enumerated in that  
compact; and that in ease of a deliberate,  
palpable, autl dangerous exercise of oilier  
powers, not granted by the said compact,  
the States who are parties thereto have the  
right, and are in duty bound, to interpose,  
for arresting the progress of the evil, and for !  
  
^JCKaCasSCTHaiEH  
maintaining, within their respective limits,,  
the authorities, rights, and liberties, apper  
laining to them.  
That the General Assembly doth also ex­  
press its deep regret that a spirit has, in sun­  
dry instances, been manifested, by the Feder­  
al Government, to enlarge its powers, by  
forced constructions of the constitutional  
diameter which defines them; and that in­  
dications have appeared of a design to ex.­  
pound certain general phrases, (which, hav­  
ing been copied front the very limited grant  
of powers in the former Articles ol Confed­  
eration, were the less liable to be miscon­  
strued,) so as to destroy the meaning and  
effect of the particular enumeration which  
necessarily explains and limits the general  
phrases, and no as to consolidate the States,  
by degree:.;, into one sovereignty—the obvi­  
ous tendency and inevitable result of which  
would bn to transform the prcscnTnefiubli­  
cuR Sys tem of the United Slates into an ab­  
sulute&#x27;,orTtSoKst,a mixed .Monarchy.  
That the General A . cuddy doth particu­  
larly protest against the palpable and alar­  
ming infractions of the Constitution, in the  
two lata case ; of the ‘Alien and Sedition Act;;,5  
passed at the last session of Congress; the  
first of which exercises a power no where  
del&lt; .gated to the Federal Government, and  
which, by uniting Legislative and Judicial  
powers to those of Executive, subverts the  
general principles of free government, as well  
as the particular organization and positive  
provisions of the Federal Constitution; and  
the other of which Acts exercises, in like  
manner, a power not delegated by the.Con­  
stitution, but, on (lie contrary, expressly and  
positively forbidden by one of the amend­  
ments thereto—a power which, move than  
any other, ought to produce universal alarm,  
because it is level!:.! against the right of Frot­  
ly examining public characters and un &#x27; s,.-.-,  
and of free communication amor::,&#x27; the pc; -  
pie, thereon, which has ever been justly deem­  
ed the only effectual guardian of every other  
right.  
  
i nai mis mate Having, by its convention  
which ratified the Federal Convention, ex­  
pressly declared, that among oilier essential  
rights, “tho liberty of conscience and of the  
press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrain­  
ed, or modified, by any authority of the Unit­  
ed Slates ;w and. from its extreme anxiety to  
guard there rights from every possible attack  
of sophistry ami ambition, having, with oth­  
j cr States, recommended an amendment for  
that purpose—which amendment was, in tine  
tithe annexed to the Constitution—it would  
mark a reproachful inconsistency, and crim­  
inal degeneracy, if an indifference were now  
: hotvn the most palpable violation of one of  
the rights thus declared and to cured ; and to

Rcsolulions cf Mr. 5Ia li;on in 1758.  
Resolved, That the General Assembly of Vir­  
ginia doth unequivocally express a firm resolution  
to maintain and defend the Constitution of the  
United States, and the Constitution of this State,  
against everv aggression, either foreign or domes­  
tic, and that they will support the government of  
the United States in all measures warranted by the  
former.  
The General Assembly most solemnly declares  
a warm attachment to the union of the States, to  
maintain which it pledges all its powers; and that,  
for this end, it is their duty to watch over and op­  
pose every infraction of those principles, which  
militate the only basis of th.t union, because a faith­  
ful observance of these can alone secure its exist­  
ence and the public happiness.  
That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremp­  
torily declare, that it views the powers of the fede­  
ral government as resulting from the compact tu  
which the States are parties, as limitedby the plain  
sense and intention of the instrument constituting  
that compact, as no farther valid than they are au­  
thorized by the grants enumerated in compact;  
and that in case it a deliberate palpable and dan­  
gerous exercise of power, not granted by the  
said compact, the States who are parties thereto, have  
the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose tor ar­  
resting the progress of the evil, and maintaining in  
their respective limits, the authorities, rights and lib­  
erties appertaining to them.  
That the General Assembly doth also express its  
deep regret, that a spirit has in sundry instances been  
manifested by the federal government, to enlarge its  
powers by forced constructions of the constitutional  
character which defines them; and that indications  
have appeared of a design to expound certain general  
phrases, (which, having been copied from the very  
limited &quot;rant of powers in the former articles of con­  
federation, were the less liable to be construed.) so  
ss to destroy the meaning and effect of the particular  
enumeration which necessarily explains, and limits  
the general phrases; and so as to consolidate the States  
by degrees, into one sovereignty, the obvious tendency  
and inevitable result of which would be, to transform  
the present republican system of the United States in­  
to an absolute, or&#x27;at best, a mixed monarchy.  
That the General Assembly doth particularly pro  
test against the palpable and alarming infractions of  
the constitution, in the two late cases ot the &quot;Alien  
and Sedition acts,&quot; passed at the last session of Con­  
gress; the first of which exercises a power nowhere  
delegated to the federal government; and which, by  
uniting legislative and judicial power to those of the  
executive, subverts the general principles of a free  
government, as well as the particular organization and  
- positive provisions of the federal constitution; and the  
ether of which acts exercises in like manner, a power  
which, more than any other, ought to produce um&#x27;ver-  
sal alarm; because it is levelled against the right of  
free!&quot; examining nublic characters n k Jxrfleagu-(ryiajnrf

the Virginia House of Delegates  
In  
Friday, December 21, 1798.  
Resolved, That the General Assembly of  
Virginia doth unequivocally express a firm  
resolution to maintain and defend the Con­  
stitution of the United States, and the Con­  
stitution of this State, against every aggres­  
sion, either foreign or domestic, and that  
they will support the Government of the  
Umted States in all measures warranted by  
the former.  
. That this Assembly most solemnly de­  
clares a warm attachment to the Union of  
the States, to maintain which, it pledges  
its powers; and that for this end, it is their  
duty to watch over and oppose every in­  
fraction of those principles which consti­  
tute the only basis of that Union because a  
faithful observance of them can alone se­  
cure its existence and the public happiness.  
That this Assembly doth, explicitly and  
peremptorily declare tha it views the pow­  
ers of the Federal Government as resulting  
from the compact to which the States are  
parties, as limited by the plain sense and  
intention of the instrument constituting that  
compact, as no further valid than they are  
authorized by the grants enumerated in  
that compact; and that in case of a deliber  
ate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of  
. .. .1 !  
other powers, not granted oy ine saia com­  
pact, the States, who are parties thereto,  
have the right, and are in dutt bound, to  
interpose, for arresting the progress of the  
evil, and for maintaining within their res­  
pective limits, the authorities, rights, and  
liberties, appertaining to them.  
That the General Assembly doth also ex­  
press its deep regret that a spirit has, in  
sundry instances, been manifested, by the  
Federal Government, to enlarge its powers  
by forced constructions of the constitution­  
al charter which defines them; and that in­  
dications have appeared of a design to ex­  
pound certain general phrases, (which,  
having been copied from the very limited  
grant of powers in the former Articles of  
Confederation, were the less liable to be  
misconstrued,) so as to destroy the mean­  
ing and effect of the particular enumeration  
which necessarily explains and limits the  
general phrases, and so as to consolidate  
me states, oy aegrees, into one sovereign

result of which would be to transform the  
present republican system of the U. States  
into an absolute, or at best, a mixed mon  
archy. iX . &#x27; -  
That the General Assembly doth partic  
ularly protest against the palpable and al  
arming infractions of the Constitution, in  
the two late cases of the &quot;Alien and Sedi  
tion Acts,&quot; passed at the last session of  
Congress; the first of which exercises a  
power no where delegated to the Federal  
Government, and which by uniting Legisla  
tive and Judicial powers to those of Exec  
utive, subverts the general principles of  
free government, as well as the particular  
organization and positive provisions of the  
r J 1 n .-i .f 1.1 . 1 r ,.,

Acts exercises, in like manner, a power not  
delegated by the Constitution, but on the  
contrary expressly and positively fobidden  
by one of the amendments thereto; a power  
which, more than any other, ought to pro  
duce universal alarm, because it is levelled  
against the right of freely examining pub  
lic characters and measures, and of free  
communication among the people thereon,  
which has ever been justly deemed the  
only, effectual guardian of every other  
right - .  
That this State having, by its Conven  
tion which ratified the Federal Constitution,  
expressly declared that, among other es­  
sential rights, &quot;the liberty of conscience  
and the press cannot be cancelled, abndg  
ed, restrained, or modified, by any author  
ity of the United States,&quot; and from its  
extreme anxiety to guard these rights from  
every possible attack of sophistry and am-  
Diuon, navtng, wim ouier ouuea, recom­  
mended an amendment for that purpose,  
which amendment was, in due time, annex­  
ed to the Constitution, it would mark a re-  
proachful inconsistency, and criminal de  
  
generacy, if an indifference were now shown  
to the most palpable violation of one of the  
rights thus declared and secured; and to  
the establishment of a precedent which  
may be fatal to the other.

fflihat the General assembly doth also express Hi  
deep regret that a spirit hais, in sundry instances,  
been manifested by the Federal Government, to  
enlarge its powers, by forced constructions of the  
constitutional charter, which defines them; and that  
indications have appeared of a design to expound  
certain general phrases,(which have been copied  
from a veiy limited grant of power« in the former  
Articles ofconfederatum, were the le« liable to be  
misconstrued,) so as to destroy the meaning sad ef­  
fort of the particular enumeration which necesoari­  
ly explains and limits the general phrases, and ao as  
to conaolidate the state«, by degree«, into one sove­  
reigpty—the obvious tendency and inevitable nr  
suit of which would be to transform the present re­  
publican system of the United States into an abao­  
lute, or, at best, a mixed monarchy,  
That the Genera) amembly doth particularly p  
test against the palpable and alarming iafnwtMos  
of the constitution, in the two late sessions, of the  
&#x27;Alien and Sedition Act.&#x27; passed at the last aeoaion  
of congres«; the first ot which exercises a power  
no where delegated to the federal government, and  
which, by uniting legislative and judicial powers  
to thore of the executive, subvert« the general  
principles of free government, aa well aa the  
licular organization and poaitive wovisioua of the  
Federal constiotion; and the other of which acts  
exercises in like manner, a power, not delegated by  
the constitution, but, on the contrary, expressly and  
positively forbidden by one of the amendments  
thereto—a power which, more than any other,  
ought to produce universal alarm, because it is lev­  
elled against the right of freely examining public  
character» and measure*, and of free communication  
among the people thereon, which has ever been

were the less liable to tie misconstrued,)

sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevitable  
result of which would be In transform the present  
republican system of the United Stales into an  
absolute, or at best, a mixed monarchy.  
That the general assembly doth particularly  
protest against tho palpable and alarming infractinna  
nf that f^nnutilntian in tlin twn litis*  
  
of the &quot; Alien and Sedition acta,&quot; paused at the  
last session of Congress; the first of which exercises  
a power nowhere delegated to the federal  
government, md which, by unit&#x27; ig legislative  
and judicial powers to those of Executre, subverts  
the general principles of free government,  
as well as the particular organization and positive  
provisions of the federal Cons &quot;tu on; and  
the other of which acta exercises, in like manner,  
a power not delegated by the Constitution,  
but on the contrary, expressly and positively  
f rbidden by one o&#x27; the amendments thereto; a  
power which, more than any other, ought to produce  
universal alarm, because it is leveled against  
the right of freely examining public characters  
and measures, and of free communication among  
the people thereon, which has ever been justly  
deemed the only effectual guardian of every  
other right.  
That this State having, by its Convention  
which rntified the federal Constitution, expressly  
declared that- among other essential  
rights, &quot;the liberty of conscience nnd the press  
cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained, or  
modified, by any authority of the United States,&quot;  
and from its extreme anxiety to guard these  
rights from every possible attack of sophistry  
and ambition, having, with other States, recommended  
an amendment for thut purpose, which  
amendment was, in due time, annexed to the  
Cnnstitation.it would murk n reproachful incon  
sistency, and criminal degeneracy, if an jndif-1  
ference were now shown to the most palpable 1  
violation of one of the rights thus declared and j  
secured ; and to lite establishment of a precedent j  
which may be fatal to the other.

IN THE VIRGINIA HOUSE OF DELEGATES. *  
Friday, December *21, 1798. *  
Retained, That the general assembly of Vir- 8  
ginia dotb unequivocally express a firm reaolu. t  
tion to maintain and defend tho Constitution of t!  
the United States, and the conatitution of this ?  
State, against every aggression, either foreign or w  
domestic; and that they will support the gov- 0  
eminent of the United States in all measures y  
warranted by the former. b  
That this assembly most solemnly declares a |t  
warm attachment to the Union of the (States, to  
maintan which, it pledgia its powers; and that ir  
for this end, it is their duty to watch over and w  
oppose every mixtion of those principles which  
constitute the only basis of that Union, because w  
a faithful observance of them can alone secure a|  
its existence and the public happiness. b  
That this assembly doth expticitely and pe- -J  
reuiptorily declare that it views the powers of w  
the federal government as resulting from the ^  
compact to which the States are parties, as lim- ni  
ited by the plain .sense and intention of the in- 0|  
strument constituting that compnct, as no far- w  
titer valid than they aa&gt; authorized by the grants e,  
enumerated in that compact; and that in case g,  
of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exer- a|  
cise of other posers, not granted by the said yt  
compact, the States, who are parties thereto, p,  
have the rig .t,anJ are in duty bound, to inter i(,  
pose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and  
for maintaining within their respective limits, the e;  
authorities, rights, and liberties, appertaining to bn  
them. w  
That ttiA ornnArnl nssemh&#x27;v doth also eXDreSS  
  
its deep regret that a spirit has. in sundry in- fe  
stances, been manifested by the federal govern- |j|  
rnent, to enlarge its powers by forced construe- t|,  
tions of the Constitutional charter which defines  
them ; and that indications have appeared of a (](  
design to expound certain general phrases,  
(which, having been copied from the very limited ot  
grant of powers in the former articles of con- cj  
federation, were the less liable to be miscon- j?  
slrued,) so as to destroy the meaning and effect  
of the particular enumeration which necessarily ^  
explains and limits the general phrases, and so jj,  
as to consolidate the States, l&gt;y degrees, into one  
sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevitable p(  
result of which would be to transform the present j?  
republican system of the United Stales into an nt  
absolute, or at best, a mixed monarchy. w  
That the general assembly doth particularly gj  
protest against the palpable and alarming infrac- 0j  
tions of the Constitution, in the two late cases 8j  
of the &quot; Alien an1 Sedition nets,&quot; passed at the Hr  
last session of Congress; the first of which exercises  
a power.nowhere delegated to the federal aj  
government, and which, by uniting legislative tr  
and judicial powers to thoso^f Executive, sub- cverts  
the general principles of free government, Pr  
as wdl as the particular organization und posi- U|  
tive provisions of the federal Constitution ; and Hr  
the other of which acts exercises, in like man- Hj  
ner, a power not delegated by the Constitution, w  
but on the contrary, expressly and positively ^  
f rbidden by one of the amendments thereto; n  
  
power which, more than any other, ou?ni to produce  
universal alarm, because it ia leveled against a|  
the right of freely examining public characters Tt  
and measures, and of free communication among p,  
the people thereon, which has ever been justly m  
deemed the only effectual guardian of every  
other right. .  
That this Slate having, by its Convention  
which ratified the federal Constitution, ex- jn  
pressly declared that, among other esaential j,  
rigi.ts,&#x27; (.hp liberty of conscience and the press ca  
cannot be en&lt;wel?ed, ab/idged, restrained, or js  
modified, by any authority q( the United States,&quot;  
and from its extreme anxiety to g*wl these  
rights from every possible attack of soj^nstry  
and ambition, having, with other States, recotri- t|,  
mended an amendment for that purpose, which  
amendment ww*, in due time, annexed to the  
Constitutional wyuld ui&quot;rka repro chful incon f,)

that indications have appeared of a design

That the General Assembly doth partic  
ularly protest against the palpable and  
alarming infractions of the Constitution, in  
the two late sessions, of the &quot;Alien and Se­  
dition Acts,&quot; passed at the last session of  
Congress; the first of which exercises a  
power no where delegated to the Federal  
Government, and which, by uniting Leg  
islative and judicial powers to those of the  
Executive, subverts the general principles  
of free Government, as well as the particu­  
lar organization and positive provisions of  
the Federal Constitution; and the other of  
which Acts exercises, in like manner a  
power not delegated by the Constitution,  
but, on the contrary, expressly and posi­  
tively forbidden by one of the amendments  
thereto--a power which, more than any  
other, ought to produce universal alarm,  
because it is levelled against the right of  
freely examining public charters and mea­  
sures, and of free communication among  
the people, thereon, which has ever been  
justly deemed the only effectual guardian  
of every other right.  
That this State having, by its Conven­  
tion, which ratified the Federal Constitu­  
tion, expressly declared, that among other  
essential rights, &quot;the liberty of conscience,  
and of the press cannot be cancelled, a  
bridged, restrained, or modified, by any  
authority of the United States;&quot; and, from  
its extreme anxiety, to guard these rights  
from every possible attack of soph­  
istry and ambition, having with other  
States, recommended an amendment for  
that purpose, which amendment was, in  
  
due time, annexed to the Constitution,  
it would mark a reproachful inconsistency,  
and criminal degeneracy, if anindifference  
were now shown to the most palpable vio­  
lation of one of the rights thus declared  
and secured; and to the establishment of a  
precedent which may be fatal to the other.  
That the good people of this Common­  
wealth having ever felt, and continuing to  
feel, the most sincere affection for their  
brethren of the other States, the truest  
anxisty for ostablishing and perpetuating  
the Union of all, and the most scrupulous  
fidelity to that Constitution, which is the  
pledge of mutual frendship, and the instru­  
ment of mutual happiness--the General  
Assembly doth solemnly appeal to the  
like disposition in the other States, in con­  
fidence that they will concur with this Com­  
monwealth in declaring, as it does hereby  
declare, that the Acts aforesaid are ex­  
constitutional, and that the necessary  
and proper measores will be taken by  
cach for co-operating with this State in  
maintaining unimpaired the authorities,  
rights, and liberties reserved to the States  
respectfully, or to the People.  
That the Governor be desired to trans

the same may be communicated to the

Resolved, That the General Assembly f,f v-

to maintain and defend the Constitution 0f ti v

That this Assembly most solemnly dtc!ar  
irm attachment to the Union of the Stai,..&quot;  
maintain which it pledges its powers ; and that C  
this end, it is their duty to watch over and rm, &#x27;  
every infraction of those principles which const?  
tute the only basis of that Union, because a faith  
ful observance of them can alone secure its exk  
ence and the public happiness.  
That this Assembly doth explicitly and perem. :  
torily declare that it views the powers of the vS  
eral Government as resulting from the compact to  
which the States are parties, as limited by  
plain sense and intention of the instrument con!  
stituting that compact, as no further valid than  
they are authorized by the grants enumerated ia  
that compact; and that in case of a deliberate  
palpable and dangerous exercise of other powers&#x27;  
not granted by the said compact, the States ufo  
are parties thereto have the right, and art in dutv I  
bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of  
the evil and for maintaining within their resrctiv.  
limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties apptr.  
taining to them.  
That the General Assembly, doth also expresi  
its deep regret that a spirit has, in sundry instan-  
ces, been manilestea oy me uenerai Government  
to enlarge its powers by forced constructions of  
the constitutional compact which defires thtm­  
and that indications have appeared of a&#x27; design to  
expound certain general phrases, (which lavic-.  
been copied from the very limited grant of powe  
in the former Articles of Confederation, were the  
less liable to be misconstrued,) so as to dVtroj  
the meaning and effect of the particular enumer­  
ation which necessarily explains and limits tie  
general phrases, and so as to consolidate the&#x27; ikate,  
by degrees, into one Sovereignty, the obvious ten­  
ency and inevitable result of which would be to  
transform the present republican system of the U.  
S. into an absolute, or at best, a mixed monardiT.  
That the General Assembly doth parlieuWW  
protest against the palpable and alarming infrac­  
tions of the Constitution, in the two late cases of  
&quot;Alien and Sedition Acts,&quot; passed at the last ses­  
sion of Congress; the first of which exercises a  
power no where delegated to the Federal Govern­  
ment, and which by uniting Legislative and judi­  
cial powers to those of Executive, subverts ite  
general principles of free government, as well as  
the particular organization and positive prori-Kiis  
of the Federal Constitution ; and the other of  
w hich Acts exercises, in like manne r, a power not  
delegated by the Constitution, but on the contrary  
expressly and positively forbidden by one of the  
amendments thereto ; a power, which more than  
any other ought to produce universal alarm, be­  
cause it is leveled against the riht of freelv exr.m­  
ining public characters and measures, and of free  
communication among the people thereon, which  
has ever been justly deemed the only effectod  
guardian of every other right  
That this State having, by its Convention which  
ratified the Federal Constitution, expressly declar­  
ed that, amtng other essential rights, &quot; the liber­  
ty of conscience and the press caimtt be cancelled,  
abridged, restrained or modified, by any authori­  
ty of the U. S.;&quot; and from its extreme anxiety to  
guard these rights from every possible attack of  
sophistry and ambition, having with other States,  
recommended an amendment for that purpose,  
which amendment was in due time, annexed to te  
Constitution, it would make a reproachful incon­  
sistency, and criminal degeneracy, if an indiffer­  
ence were now shown to the most palpable viola­  
tion of one of the rights thus declared and secu­  
red, and to the establishment of a precedent which  
may be fatal to the othe r,  
That the good people of this Commonwealth,  
having ever felt, and continuing to feel the most  
sincere affection for their brethren of the other  
States, the truest anxiety for establishing and per­  
petuating the Union of all, and the most scrupu­  
lous fide lity to that Constitution which is the pledge  
of mutual friendship, and the instrume nt of mutu­  
al happiness, the General Assembly doth solemn­  
ly appeal to the like dispositieMis in the other states,  
in confidence that they w ill concur with this Com­  
monwealth in declaring as it does hereby declare,  
that the acts aforesaid are unconstitutional ; and  
that the necessary and proper measures will be ta­  
ken by each, for cooperating with this State in  
maintaining unimpaired the authorities, rights and  
libesties, reserved to the States respectively or to  
the people.  
French Affairs.  
The complexion of affairs in France is by no  
means as definite and satisfactory as the first re­  
port represented. So powerful a combination as  
that of the Legitimists, Orleanists, and Modem,  
is not to be annihilated at a sin blow. Hence  
cr  
We find that whilst the late coup d&#x27;etat achieved a  
most decided victory for Louis Napoleon, it was  
not a complete one. Changarnier has friends hi

In the Virginia House of Delegates, Friday,  
December 21, 1798.  
Resolved, That the General Assembly of Vir­  
ginia doth unequivocally express a lirm resolu­  
tion to maintain and defend the constitution of  
the United States, and the constitution of this  
State, against every aggression, either foreign  
or domestic; and that they will support the go­  
vernment of the United States in all measures  
warranted by the former.  
That this assembly most solemnly declares  
a warm attachment to the Union of the States,  
to maintain which it pledges its powers; and  
that for this end it is their duty to watch over  
and oppose every infraction of those principles  
which constitute the only basis of that Union, be­  
cause a faithful observance of them can alone  
secure its existence and the public happi­  
ness.  
That this assembly doth explicitly and per­  
emptorily declare that, it views the powers of  
the federal government as resulting from the  
compact to which the States are parties, as li­  
mited by the plain seuse and intention of the  
instrument constituting that compact, as no  
farther valid than they are authorized by the  
grants enumerated in that compact; and that  
in case of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous  
exercise of other powers, not granted by the  
said compact, the States, who are parties, there­  
to, have the right, and are in duty bound, to in­  
terpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and  
for maintaining, within their respective limits, the  
authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to  
them. «  
  
1 hat the General Assembly doth also express  
its deep regret that a spirit has, in sundry in­  
stances, been manifested by the federal govern­  
ment, to enlarge its powers by forced construc­  
tions of the constitutional charter which de­  
fines them; and that indications have appear­  
ed of a design to expound certain general  
phrases, (which, having been copied from the  
very limited grant of powers in the former ar­  
ticles of confederation, were the less liable to  
be misconstrued,) so as to destroy the meaning  
and elfect of the particular enumeration which  
necessarily explains and limits the general  
! phrases, and so as to consolidate the States, by  
degrees, into one sovereignty, the obvious ten­  
dency and inevitable result of which would be  
to transform the present republican system of  
the United States into an absolute, or at best, a  
mixed monarchy.  
That the General Assembly doth particularly  
protest against the palpable and alarming in­  
fractions of the constitution, in the two late  
cases*&gt;f ‘he “alien and sedition acts,&quot; passed  
at the last session of Congress; the first of  
which exercises a power no where delegated to  
the federal government, and which, by uniting  
legislative and judicial powers to those of ex­  
ecutive, subverts the general principles of free  
government, as well as the particular organiza­  
tion and positive provisions of the federal con­  
stitution; and the other of which acts exer­  
cises, in like manner, a power not delegated hv  
the constitution, but on the contrary, expressly  
anil positively forbidden by one of the amend­  
ments thereto; a power which, more than anv  
other, ought to produce universal alarm, be­  
cause it is leveled against the right, of freely  
examining public characters and measures, and  
of free communication among the people there­  
on, which has ever been justly deemed the  
only effectual guardian of every other right.  
That this State having, by its convention  
which ratified the federal constitution, express­  
ly declared that, among other essential rights,  
“the liberty of conscience and the press cannot  
be canceled, abridged, restrained or modified,  
by any authority of the United States,” and  
from its extreme anxiety to guard these rights  
from every possible attack of sophistry arid  
ambition, having, with other States, recom­  
mended an amendment for that purposP, which  
amendment was, in due time, annexed to the  
constitution, it would mark a reproachful incon­  
[ sisteuev and criminal degeneracy, if an indiffe  
rence were now shown to the most palpable vi­  
olation of one of the rights thus declared and  
secured; and to the establishment of a prece­  
dent which may he fatal to the other.  
That the good people of this commonwealth,  
having ever leit, and continuing to feel, the  
most sincere affection for the brethren of the  
other States; the truest anxiety for establishing  
and perpetuating the union of all; and the  
most scrupulous fidelity to that constitution  
which is the pledge of mutual friendship, and  
the instrument of mutual happiness, the Gene­  
ral Assembly doth solemnly appeal to the like  
dispositions in the other States, in confidence  
that they will concur with this common wealth  
in declaring, as it does hereby declare, that the  
acts aforesaid are unconstitutional; and that  
tlie necessary and proper measures will be ta­  
ken by each for co-operating with this State in  
maintaining unimpaired the authorities, rights  
and liberties reserved to the States respectively,  
or to the people.  
That the. Governor be desired to transmit a  
copy of the foregoing resolutions to the execu­  
tive authority of each of the other States, with  
a request that the same may be communicated  
to the Legislature thereof; and that a copy be  
furnished to each of the senators and represen­  
tatives representing this State in the Congress  
of the United States.

IX thk VlltGIXIa Horse of Delegates,  
Friday, l)ee. 21, 17!*H. (  
Jtesolred, That the General Assembly of \ ir- (  
ginia doth unequivocally express a firm resolu- x  
tion to maintain and defend the Constitution of *  
the United States, and the Constitution of this ; \
States against everv aggression, either foreign &gt;g  
or domestic; and that thov will support the ,  
Government of the United States in all mens- .  
urcs warranted by the former.  
That this Assembly most solemnly declares t  
a warm attachment to the Union of the States, ,  
to maintain which it pledges its powers; and, ; t  
that for this end, it is their duty to w atch over (  
and oppose ev ey infraction of those princijdes ,  
trhir/i constiln/i the only basis of that Union, ,  
because a faithful observance of them can alone | t  
secure its existence and the public happiness, j  
That this Assembly doth expli( itly and per- ,  
emptorilv declare, that it views the powers of t  
the Federal Government, as resulting from the x  
compact to which the States are parties, as (  
limited by thcplain sen-e and intention of the j  
instrument constituting that compact, as no r  
farther valid than they are authorized by the ,  
grants enumerated in that compact: and that (  
in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous j  
exercise of other powers, not granted by tbe ,  
said compact, the States, who are parties there- ?  
to, have the right, ami are in duty bound, to  
interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil. (  
and for maintaining within their respective |  
limits the authorities, rights, and liberties, ap- ,  
pertaining to them. .  
That the General Assembly doth also express ,  
its deep regret, that a spirit has, in sundry in- .  
stances, been manifested by the Federal Gov- I  
eminent, to enlarge its powers b\ forced eon- j  
stractions of the constitutional charter which j  
defines them; and. that indication- have ap- g  
peured of a design to expound certain general j  
phrases (which, having been copied from the j  
very limited grant of powers in the former arti- f  
cles of confederal ion, were the less liable no be ,  
misconstrued) so as to destroy tbe meaning j  
and effect of the particular enumeration which t  
necessarily explains and limits the general ]  
phrases, and so as to consolidate the Statds by j.  
degrees iuto one Sovereignty, the obvious $end- (  
ency and inevitable result of which would be. 1  
to transform the present republican svstein of .  
  
the I nitcd States into aa absolute, or, at j.est, j  
a mixed monarchy. I  
That the General Assembly doth particularly j  
protest a^-ainst the palpable and alarming in- |  
tractions of the Constituti&gt;u, in the two late &lt;  
cases of the &quot;Alien and Sedition Acta,&quot; passed (  
at the last session of Congress : the first of |  
which, exercises a power nowhere delegated ,  
jto the Federal Government, and which, bv . J  
uniting Legislative and Judicial powers to those t  
of Executive, subverts the general principles of 4  
free government, as well as the iwitionlar organ- i  
izatiou and jiosiuve provisions of the Federal ,  
Constitution : and the other of which acts exer- ,  
rises, in like manner, a power not delegated bv ]  
the Constitution, but. on the contrary, expressly j  
and positively forbidden bv one of the amend- |  
incuts thereto; a power which, more than any ,  
other, ought to produce universal alarm, be- .  
cause it is levelled against the right of freely ,  
examining public characters and measures, and ]  
of free comuiunieatiou among the people there- ,  
on, which has ever been justly deemed the only ,  
effectual guardian of every other right.  
That this State having by its Convention, j  
which ratified the Federal Constitution, ex- |  
presaly declared, that among other essential |  
right.-. &quot; the liberty of conscience and the press &lt;  
cannot he cancelled, abridged, restrained, or ]  
modified, by any authority of the Foiled States,&quot;  
and from its extreme anxiety to guard these ;  
rights from every possible attack of sophistry \
and ambition, having with other States recorn- |  
mended an-amend rneut for that purpose, which  
j amendment was. in due time, annexed to the ,  
Constitution, it would mark a reproachful in- j  
consistency, and criminal degeneracy, if an indifference  
were now shown to the most palpable j  
violation of one of the rights thus declared and i  
secured, and to the establishment of a pre- j  
cedent which may be fatal to the other. ,  
That the good people

large its powers by forced constructions of theconsti  
thtional charter wich delines them; and that indi  
cations have appeared of a design to expound cer-

sovereignty, the ebvious tondency, and inevitable  
result of which would be to transform the present  
Republican system of the United States into an al  
so ute or at best a mixed monarchy.  
5 That the General Assembly doth particularly  
protest against the palpable and alarming infrac­  
to of the Constitution, in the two late cases of the  
&quot;Alien and Sedition acts,&quot; passed at the last session  
of Congress; the first of which exercises a power  
no where delegated to the federal government; and  
which by uniting legislative judicial powers to those  
of the executitve, subverts the general principles  
of free government, as well as the particular orga­  
nization and positive provisions of the federal consti­  
tution, and the other of which acts exercises, in like  
manner, a power not delegated by the Constitution,  
e e o e eeeeoe  e e ee oi  
but, on the contrary, expressly and pesitively forbid  
den by one of the amendments thereto: a power.  
one of the amendments thereto  
more than any other, ought to produce universal  
alarm; because it is levelled against the right of free-  
eee o e oee ea oe o e  
y examining public characters and measures, and of  
 free communication among the people thereon which  
has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guar-  
dian of every other right.  
6. That this State having by its convention, which  
ratified the federal constitution, expressly declared,  
that among other essential rights, &quot;the liberty of  
conscience and of the press cannot be canceled,  
abridged, restrained, or modified by any authority  
of the United States,&quot; and from its extreme anxiety  
to guard these rights from every possible attack of  
sophistry and ambition, having, with other States,  
recommended an amendment for that purpose,  
which amendment was in due time annexed to the  
constitution, it would mark a reproachful inconsis­  
tency, and criminal degeneracy if an indifference  
were not shown, to the most palpable violation of  
one of the rights thus declared and secured; and to  
the establishment of a precedent, which may be fa­  
tal to the otl er.  
7. That the good people of this commonwealth,  
having ever felt, and continuing to feel, the most  
sincere affection for their brethren of the other  
States, the truest anxiety for establishing and per­  
petuating the union of all; and the most scrupulous  
fidelity to that constitution, which is the pledge of  
mutual friendship, and the instrument of mutual  
happiness, the general assembly doth solemnly ap­  
peal to the like dispositions in other State, in confi­  
dence that they will concur with this common­  
wealth in declaring, as it does hereby declare, that  
the acts aforesaid are unconstitutional; and that the  
necessary and proper measures will be taken by  
each, for co-operating with this State, in maintain­  
ing unimpaired, the authorities, rights and liberties  
reserved to the State respectively, or to the peo­  
ple. That the governor be desired to transmit a cony  
of the foregoing resolutions to the executive author­  
ity of the other States, with a reques, that the same  
be communicated to the legislature thereof; and  
that a copy be turnished to each of the senators and

stitute the only basis of that Union, because a faith­  
ful observance of them alone can secure its exist

3. That this assembly doth explicitly and peremp­

Federal Government, as resulting from the compact,  
to which the States are parties, as limited by the

the very limited grant of power in the former arti  
cles of confederation, were the less liable to be mis­  
construed,) so as to destroy the meaning and effect  
of the particular enumeration which necessarily  
explains, and limits the general phrases, and so as  
to consolidate the States by degrees, into one sover

of which would be to transform the present Repub  
lican system of the United States into an absolute,  
or at best a mixed monarchy.

protest against the palpable and alarming infrac­  
tion of the Constitution, in the two late cases of the  
&quot;Alien and Sedition acts,&quot; passed at the last session  
of Congress; the first of which exercises a power  
no where delegated to the federal government; and  
which by uniting legislative judicial powers to those  
of the executive, subverts the general principles of  
free government, as well as the particular organi­  
zation and positive provisions of the federal consti­  
tution, and the other of which acts exercises, in like  
manner, a power not delegated by the Constitution,  
but, on the contrary, expressly and positively for­  
bidden by one of the amendments thereto; a power,  
more than any other, ought to produce universal  
alarm; because it is levelled against the right of

Rrsotred, That the General Assembly of Vir­  
ginia doth unequivocally express a firm resolu­  
tions to maintain nod defend the Constitution of  
iv Tnit&quot;&#x27;! PHtm nrd &#x27;he enur‘ltuiha of five  
  
state, against every aggression either foreign or  
domestic; and that they will support the govern­  
ment of the United States in all measures war  
ranted by the former.  
That this Assembly most soletnnlv declares a  
warm attachment to the Union of the states, to  
maintain which it pledges its powers; and, that  
for this end, it is their duty lo watch over and op­  
pose every infraction of those principles which  
constitute the only basis of that Union, because  
a faithful observance of them can alone secure  
its existence and the public happiness.  
That Ibis Assembly doth explicitly and peremp­  
torily declare, that it views the powers of the  
federal government, as resulting from the com­  
pact lo which the stales are parties, as limitel  
by the plain sense and intention of the instru­  
ment constituting that compact, as no farther  
valid than they were authorized by the grams  
enumerated in that compact; and that in case ol  
a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of  
other powers, not granted by the said compact,  
the stales, who are parties thereto, have the right,  
and are in duty bound, to interpose, lor arresting  
the progress of the evil, and for maintaining  
within their respective limits the authorities,  
rights, and liberties appertaining to them.  
That the General Assembly doth also express  
iis deep regret, that a spirit has, in sundry in­  
stances, been manifested by the federal govern­  
ment, to enlarge its powers by forced construc­  
tions of the constitutional charter which defines  
them; and. that indications have appeared ol a  
design to expound cert tin general phrases (which,  
having been copied fiom the very limited grant  
of powers in the former Articles of Confedera­  
tion, were the less liable to be misconstrued) so  
as lo destroy the meaning nud etlect of the par­  
ticular enumeration which necessarily explains,  
and limits the general phrases, and so as to con­  
solidate the slates by degrees into one sovereign­  
ty. the obvious tendency and inevitable result of  
which would be, lo transform the present repub­  
lican system of the United Slates iuto an absolute  
or at best, a mixed monarchy.  
That the General Assembly doth particularly  
protest against the palpable and alarming in­  
fractions ot the Constitution, in the two late cases  
of the &quot;Alien and Sedition Acts.” passed at the  
last session of Congress; the first of which ex­  
orcises a power nowhere delegated lo the federal  
government, and which, by uniting legislative  
and judicial powers to those ol executive, sub­  
verts the general principles of free governments,  
as well as the particular organization and posi­  
tive provisions of the Federal Constitution; and  
the other of which acts exercises, in like manner,  
a power not clelegaleil by the Constitution, but  
on thecontrary. expressly and positively forbid­  
den by one of the amendments thereto; a power  
which, more than any other, ought to produce  
universal alarm, because it is levelledjagaiust the  
right of freely examining public characters and  
measures, and of free communication among the  
people thereon, which lias ever been justly deem­  
ed the only efleetual guardian of every other  
right.  
Thai this state haling by its Convention, which  
ratified the Federal Constitution, expressly de­  
clared, that among other essential rights, “the  
liberty ol conscience and the press cannot tie  
cancelled, abridged, restrained, or modified by  
any authority of the United Stales,” and from its  
extreme anxiety lo guard these rights from every  
possible attack of sophistry and ambition, having  
with other st ites recommended an amendment  
tor ihut purpose, which um-uidmcnt was, in  
due time, annexed to the Constitution, it would  
mark a reproachful inconsistency, and criminal  
degeneracy, it au indifference were now shown  
to the most palpable violation of one of the  
rights thus declared and secured; and to the es­  
tablishment of a precedent which may be fatal to  
the ot -cr.  
  
That the pood people of this commonwealth,  
having ever felt, .mil continuing to feel the most  
sincere affection for their hrulhern of the other  
slates; the truest anxiety for establishing ami  
perpetuating the Union of all; and the most  
scrupulous liiielily to that Constitution, which is  
the pledge of mutual friendship, and the instru­  
ment of mutual happiness: the General Assem­  
bly doth solemnly appeal to the like dispositions  
in the other status, in confidence that they will  
concur with this commonwealth, in declaring, as  
it does hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid are  
unconstitutional; and. that the necessary and  
proper measures w ill bo taken by each for co­  
operating with this state, in ma ntaining unim­  
paired the authorities, rights, and liberties, reserv­  
ed to the states, respectively, or to the people.  
That the governor be desired to Iran mitji  
copy of the foregoing resolutions to the execu­  
tive authority of each of the other states, with,  
a request that the same may be communicated to  
the legislature thereof; and that a copy be fur­  
nished to each of the Senators and Representa­  
tives representing this stale in the Congress of  
the United States.

In THe VIrGINIA HouSe oF DeLeGAttes,  
Friday, Dec. 21, 1798.&quot;  
Resolved, That the General Assembly  
  
of Virginia doth unequivocally express a  
firm resolution to maintain and defend the  
Constitution of the United States, and the  
Constitution of this State, against every  
aggression either foreign or domestic; and  
they will support the Government of the  
United States in all measures, warranted  
by the former.  
That this Assembly most solemnly de­  
clares a warm attachment to the Union of  
the States to maintain which it pledges its  
powers; and, that for this end, it is their  
duty to watch over and oppose every in­  
fraction of those principles which consti­  
tute the only basis of that Union, because  
a faithful observance of them can alone  
secure its existence and the public happi  
ness.  
That this Assembly doth explicitly and  
peremptorily declare, that it views the  
powers of the federal Government, as result­  
ing from the compact to which the States  
are parties, as limited by the plain sense  
and intention of the instrument constitu­  
ting that compact, as no farther valid than  
they are authorized by the grants enumer­  
ated in that compact; and that in case of  
deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exer­  
cise of other powers, not granted by the  
said compact, the States, who are parties  
thereto, have the right, and are in duty  
bound, to interpose, for arresting the  
progress of the evil, and for maintaining  
within there respective limits the authori­  
ties, rights, and liberties appertaining to  
them.  
That the General Assembly doth also  
express its deep regret, that a spirit has, in  
sundry instances, been manifested by the  
federal government, to enlarge its powers  
  
by forced constitutona carter i e ea e i e e ene a­  
fines them, and that indication ae a a e o o a o a a e o

ral phases (which, having been copied n the ecen engagement near in­  
from the very limited grant of powers inester en rok had the leadership of  
  
the former Articles of Confederation, were  
the less liable to be misconstrued) so as to  
destroy the meaning and effect of the par­  
ticular enumeration which necessarily ex­  
plains, and limits the general phrases, and  
o as to consolidate the states by degrecs  
into one sovereignty, the obvious tendency  
and inevitable result of which would be,  
to transform the present republican system  
of the United States into an absolute, or  
at best, a mixed monarchy.  
That the General Assembly doth partic­  
ularly protest against the palpable and  
alarming infractions of the Constitution, in  
the two late cases of the &quot;Alien and Sedi­  
tion Acts,&quot; passed at the last session of  
Congress; the first of which exercises a  
power nowhere delegated to the federal  
government, and which, by uniting legisla-  
tive and judicial powers to those of execu-  
judicial pow  
tive, subverts the general principles of free  
government, well as the particular organi­  
zation and positive provisions of the Fede­  
ral Constitution; and the other of which  
acts exercises, in like manner, a power not  
delegated by the Constitution, but on the  
contrary, expressly and positively forbid­  
den by one of the amendments thereto; a  
power which more than any other, ought  
to produce universal alarm, because it is  
levelled against the right of freely examing  
public characters and measures, and of  
freely communication among the people  
thereon, which has ever! n justly deem­  
ed the only effectual guardian of every  
other right.  
That this state having by its Convention,  
which ratified the Federal Constitution,  
expressly declared, that among other  
essential rights, &quot;the liberty of conscience  
and the press cannot be cancelled, abridg­  
ed, restrained or modified by any authority  
of the United States,&quot; and from every  
possible attack of sophistry and ambition,  
having with other states recommended an  
amendment for that purpose, which amend­  
ment was, in due time, annexed to the  
Constitution, it would mark a reproachful  
inconsistency, and criminal degeneracy, if  
an indifference were now shown to the

bly of Virginia doth unequivocally  
which it pledges its powers; and,  
and the public happiness.  
&quot;That this Assembly doth explic  
itly and peremptorily declare, that it  
views the powers of the Federal Gov­  
ernment, as resulting from the com­  
pact to which the States are parties,  
as limited by the plain sense and in­  
tention of the instrument constitu­  
ting that compact, as no farther valid  
than they are authorized by the  
grants enumerated in that compact;  
and that in ease of a deliberate, pal­  
pable, and dangerous exercise of oth­  
er powers, not granted by the said  
compact, the States who are parties  
thereto, have the righe, and are  
duty bound, to interpose, for arrestsyor  
ling the progress of the evil, and for  
  
maintaining within their respective  
limits, the authorities, rights and lib­  
erties appertaining to them.  
&quot;That the General Assembly doth  
also express its deep regret, that a  
spirit has, in sundry instances, been  
manifested by the Federal Govern­  
ment, to enlarge its powers by forced  
constructions of the Constitutional  
charter which defines them; and, that  
indications have appeared of a design  
to expound certain general phrases,  
(which, having been copied from the  
very limited grant of powers in the  
former Articles of Confederation,  
were the less liable to be miscon­  
strued) so as to destroy the meaning  
and effoct of the particular enumera­  
tion which necessarily explains, and  
limits the general phrases, and so as  
to consolidate the States by degrees  
into one sovereignty, the obvious  
tendency and inevitable result of  
which would be, to transform the  
present republican system of the  
United States into an absolute, or at  
best, a mixed monarchy.  
&quot;That the General Assembly doth  
particularly protest against the pal  
pable and alarming infrations of the  
Constitution, in the two late cases of  
the &quot;Alien and Sedition Acts,&#x27; passed  
at the last session of Congress; the  
first of which exercises a power no­  
where delegated to the Federal Gov­  
ernment, and which, by uniting leg­  
islative and judicial power to those  
of executive, subverts the general  
principles of free government, as well  
as the particular organization and  
positive provisions of the Federal  
Constituton; and the other of which  
actsexercises, in like manner, a  
power not delegated by the Consti­  
tution, but on the contrary, expressly  
and positively forbidden by one of  
the amendments thereto; a power  
which, more than any other, ought  
to produce universal alarm, because  
it is levelled against the right of  
freely examining public characters  
andas meures, and of free communi­  
cation among the people thereon,  
which has ever been justly deemed  
the only effectual guardian of every  
other right.  
&quot;That thi State having by its Con­  
vention, which ratifled the Federal  
Constitution, expressly declared, that  
among other essential rights, &quot;the  
liberty of conscience and the press  
cannot be cancelled, abridged, re­  
strained, or modified by any author­  
ity of the United States,&#x27; and from  
its extreme anxiety to guard these  
rights from every possible attack of  
sophistry and ambition, having with  
other States recommended an amend­  
ment for that purpose, which amend  
ment was, in due time, annexed to  
the Constitution, it would mark  
reproachful inconsistency, and crim­  
inal degeneracy, if an indifference  
were now shown to the most palpa­  
ble violation of one of the rights,  
thus declared and secured; and to  
the establishment of a precedent  
which may be fatal to the other.  
&quot;That the good people of this com­  
monwealth, having ever felt, and  
continuing to feel the most sincere  
affection for their brethern of the  
other States; the truest anxiety for  
establishing and pepetuating the  
Union of all, and the most scrupulous  
fidelity to that Constitution, which  
is the pledge of mutual friendship,  
and the instrument of mutual hap  
the General Assembly doth  
solemnly appeal to the like disposi  
tions in the other States, in confi­  
dence that they will concur with this  
commonwealth, in declaring, as  
does hereby declare, that the acts  
aforesaid are unconstitutional; and,  
that the necessary and proper meas  
ures will be taken by each for co­  
operating with this State, in main­  
taining unimpaired the authorities,  
rights, and liberties, reserved to the  
States, respectively, or to the peo­

transmit a copy of the foregoing res­  
olutions to the executive authority  
of each of the other States, with  
request that the same may be com­

representing this State in the Con

sembly of Virginia doth uiiequlvocably  
express n Arm resolution to maintain  
nnd defend the Constitution of the  
United States, and the Constitution of  
this State, agaimt every aggression,  
either foreign or domestic; and that  
they will support the G ivernmi nl of the  
United States In all measures war?  
ranted by the former.  
&quot;That this Assembly most solemnly  
declares a warm nttnehment to the  
Union of the States, to maintain which  
It pledgee its powers; and. that for |hia  
end. It Is their duty to watch over and  
oppose every Infraction of those princi?  
ples which constitute the only basis of  
that Union, because n faithful observ?  
ance of them can alone secure its exis?  
tence and the public happiness.  
&quot;That this Assembly doth explicitly

the powers of the Federal Government,  
ns resulting from the compact lo which  
the states are parties, as limited by  
the plain sense and Inti ntion of the in?  
strument constituting that compact, nr.  
no further valid than they ore author?  
ized by the grants enumerated In that

bound, to interpose, for arresting the  
progress of the evil, and for maintain?  
ing within their respective limits the  
authorities, rights and liberties apper?  
taining to them.  
&quot;That the tb noral Assembly doth also  
express its deep regret, that a spirit  
has. in sundry instances, been manifest?  
ed by the Federal Government, to en?  
large its power:: by forced constructions  
of the Constitutional Charter which de?  
fine:! them; and that indications have  
appeared of a design to expound cer?  
tain general phrases (which, having  
been copied from the very limited grant  
cf powers in the former Articles of Con?  
federation were the less liable to ho  
misconstrued) so as to destroy the  
wearing and effect of the particular  
enumeration which necessarily explains  
find limits the general phrases, so ns  
to consolidate the Slates by degrees  
into one sovereignty, the obvious ten?  
dency and inevitable result of which  
vould be to transform the present Re?  
publican system of the United Slates  
Into an absolute, or at best, a mixed,  
monarchy.  
&quot;That the General Assembly doth  
particularly protest against the palpable  
nnd alarming Infractions of the Consti?  
tution, In the two into cases of the  
Alien and Sedition Acts? passed at (he  
last session of Congress, the first of  
?which exercises a power nowhere d&lt; le?  
gated to the Federal Government, und  
which by uniting legislative and judi?  
cial powers to those of the executive,  
subverts the general principles of free  
Government, ns well as the particular  
organization nnd positive- provisions of  
the Federal Constitution: and the other  
of which acts exercises, ,n like manner,  
r power not delegated by the Consti?  
tution, but on the contrary expressiv  
nnd positively forbidden by one of the  
amendments thereto; a power which,  
more than any other, ought to produce  
universal alarm, because It Is levelled  
ngalnst the right of freely examining  
public characters and measures, and of  
free communication among tin- people  
thereon, &lt;wh!ch has ever been Juatly  
  
doomed tlie only effectual guardian of  
every other right.  
&quot;That thin State having by tho con?  
vention, vlikh ratified tho Federal Con?  
stitution, expressly declared, that

ed, or MODIFIED UY any AIT- |  
thority of T11E3 united  
STATES.&#x27; and from its extreme anx?  
iety to guard these i-&#x27;ghts from every  
possible attack of sophistry and ambi?  
tion, having with other .States recom?  
mended an amendment for that pur?  
pose, vhich amendment was in due  
time, annexed i&quot; the Constitution, it  
would mark a n pronchful inconsistency  
and criminal degeneracy, if an indiffer?  
ence were now shown to the most pal?  
pable violation of one of the rights thus  
declared and secured: anil to the estab?  
lishment of a precedent which may be  
fatal to the oiin r.  
&quot;That the g ?od people of (bis Com?  
monwealth, having ever fell, and con?  
tinuing to feel, the most sincere affec?  
tion for their brethren of the other  
States; the truest anxiety for.establish?  
ing and perpetuating the Union of all;  
and the most scrupulous fidelity to that  
Constitution, which Is the pledge of  
mutual frl&lt; ndnhip and the Instrument  
of mutual happiness; the General As?  
sembly doth s ili mnly appeal to the like  
disposition in the other States, in con?
