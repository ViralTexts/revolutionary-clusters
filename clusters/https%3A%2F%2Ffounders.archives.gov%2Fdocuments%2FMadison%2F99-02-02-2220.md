Montpr.Novr. 27. 1830  
  
I have recd. your very friendly favor of the 20th instant, referring to a conversation when I had lately  
the pleasure of a visit from you, in which you mentioned your belief that the terms &quot;Common defence &amp; General  
welfare&quot; in the 8th. Section of &quot;the first article of the Constitution of the U. S.&quot; were still regarded by some as  
conveying to Congress a substantive &amp; indefinite power: and in which I communicated my views of the  
introduction and occasion of the terms, as precluding that comment on them; and you express a wish that I would repeat  
those views in the answer to your letter.However disinclined to the discussion of such topics at a time when it is so difficult to separate in the  
minds of many, questions purely Constitutional from the party polemics of the day, I yield to the precedents which you  
think I have imposed on myself, &amp; to the consideration that without relying on my personal recollections,  
which your partiality overvalues, I shall derive my construction of the passage in question, from sources of  
information &amp; evidence known or accessible to all who feel the importance of the subject, and are disposed to give  
it a patient examination.In tracing the history &amp; determining the import of the terms &quot;Common defence &amp; general  
welfare&quot;, as found in the text of the Constitution the following lights are furnished by the printed Journal of the  
Convention which formed it. The terms appear in the general propositions offered May 29 as, for the incipient deliberations, the first of which  
&quot;Resolved that the Articles of the Confederation ought to be corrected &amp; enlarged as to accomplish the objects  
proposed by their institution, namely, Common defence, security of liberty, and general welfare&quot;. On the day  
following, the proposition was exchanged for Resolved &quot;that an Union of the States, merely federal will not accomplish the objects proposed by the  
Articles of Confederation; namely, Common defence, security of liberty and general welfare&quot;.The inference from the use here made of the terms, &amp; from the proceedings, on the subsequent  
propositions is, that altho Common defence &amp; general Welfare were objects of the Confederation, they were  
limited objects, which ought to be enlarged by an enlargement of the particular powers to which they were limited, and  
to be accomplished by a Change in the structure of the Union from a form merely federal to one partly national. And as these  
general terms are prefixed in the like relation to the several Legislative powers in the new Charter, as they were in  
the Old, they must be understood to be under like limitations in the new as in the Old.In the course of the proceedings between the 30th. of May &amp; 6th of Augst. the terms Common defence &amp; Welfare as well as other equivalent terms must have  
been dropped: for they do not appear in the Draft of a  Constitution, reported on that day by a Committee appointed to prepare one in actual: the Clause in which those terms were afterwards inserted, being in the Draft, simply &quot;the Legislature of the U.  
S. shall have power to lay &amp; collect taxes duties, imposts &amp; excises&quot;. [ ] taxes [ ]The manner in which the terms, became transplanted from the Old into the new System of Government, is  
explained by the course somewhat adventitious given to the proceedings of the Convention.On the 18th. of Augst. among other propositions referred to the Committee which had reported the draft was  
one &quot;to secure the payment of the Public debt.,&quot; and, on the same day, was appointed a Committee, of Eleven members,  
(one from each State) &quot;to consider the necessity &amp; expediency of the debts of the  
several States, being assumed by the U. States&quot;On the 21st. of Augst. this last Committee reported a clause in the words following &quot;The Legislature of  
the U. States shall have power to fulfil the engagements, which have  
been entered into by Congress, and to discharge as well the debts of the U States, as the debts incurred by  
the several States, during the late war, for the common defence  
and General welfare&quot;; conforming herein to the 8th. of the Articles of Confederation, the  
language of which is, that &quot;all charges of war and all other expences that shall be incurred for the common defence  
and general welfare, and allowed by the U. S in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a Common treasury  
&quot;&amp;c.On the 22d. of Augst. the Committee of five reported among other additions to the clause giving power &quot;to lay and collect taxes imposts &amp; excises,&quot; a clause in the words  
following &quot;for payment of the debts and necessary expences&quot;, with a proviso qualifying the duration of Revenue  
laws.This Report being taken up, it was moved, as an amendment, that the clause should read &quot;the Legislature  
shall fulfil the engagements and discharge the debts of the U. States&quot;It was then moved to strike out &quot;discharge the debts&quot;, and insert &quot;liquidate the claims&quot;; which being  
rejected, the amendment was agreed to as proposed viz &quot;the Legislature shall fulfil the  
engagements &amp; discharge the debts of the U. States&quot;On the 23d of Augst. the clause was made to read &quot;the Legislature shall fulfil the engagements and  
discharge the debts of the U. States, and shall have the power to lay &amp; collect taxes duties imposts, &amp;  
excises&quot; the two powers relating to taxes &amp; debts being merely transposedOn the 25th. of August, the clause was again altered so as to read &quot;all debts contracted and engagements  
entered into by or under the authority of Congress (the Revolutionary Congress) shall be as valid under this  
Constitution as under the Confederation&quot;This amendment was followed by a proposition (referring to the powers to lay &amp; collect taxes  
&amp;c. and to discharge the debts (old, debts) to add &quot;for payment of said debts, and for defraying the expences that shall be  
incurred for the Common defence &amp; general welfare&quot;. The  
proposition was disagreed to, one State only voting for it.Sepr. 4. The Committee of eleven reported the following modification, &quot;The Legislature shall have power to  
lay &amp; collect taxes duties imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the Common defence &amp;  
general welfare&quot;; thus retaining the terms of the Articles of Confederation, &amp; covering by the general term  
&quot;debts&quot;, those of the Old Congress.A special provision in this mode could not have been necessary for the debts of the New Congress: For a  
power to provide money and a power to perform certain acts of which money is the ordinary &amp; appropriate means,  
must of course carry with them a power to pay that expence of performing the acts. Nor was any special provision for debts  
proposed, till the case of the Revolutionary debts was brought into view, and it is a fair presumption from the course  
of the varied propositions which have been noticed, that But for the old debts, and their association with the terms  
&quot;Common defence &amp; general welfare&quot;, the clause would have remained as reported in the first Draft of a  
Constitution, expressing generally &quot;a power in Congress to lay and collect taxes duties imposts &amp; excises&quot;;  
without any addition of the phrase &quot;to provide for the Common defence &amp; general welfare&quot; With this addition  
indeed, the language of the clause being in conformity with that of the clause in the Articles of Confederation, it would  
be qualified, as in those Articles, by the specification of powers subjoined to it. But there is sufficient reason to  
suppose that the terms in question would not have been introduced but for the introduction of the old debts with which  
they happened to stand in a familiar tho’ inoperative relation. Thus introduced however, they passed undisturbed thro’  
the subsequent Stages of the Constitution.If it be asked why the terms &quot;Common defence &amp; general welfare&quot;, if not meant to convey the  
comprehensive power, which taken literally they express, were not qualified &amp; explained by some reference to  
the particular powers subjoined, the answer is at hand, that altho’ it might easily have been done, and experience  
shews it might be well if it had been done, yet the omission is accounted for by an inattention to the phraseology,  
occasioned, doubtless, by its identity with the harmless character attached to it in the Instrument from which it was  
borrowed. But may it not be asked with infinitely more propriety, and without the possibility of a satisfactory  
answer, why, if the terms were meant to embrace not only all the powers particularly expressed, but the indefinite  
power which has been claimed under them, the intention was not so declared; why on that supposition, so much critical  
labor was employed in enumerating the particular powers, and in defining and limiting their extent?The variations &amp; vicissitudes in the modification of the clause in which the terms &quot;common  
defence &amp; general welfare&quot; appear, are remarkable, and to be no otherwise explained than by differences of  
opinion concerning the necessity or the form of a Constitutional provision for the debts of the Revolution; some of  
the members, apprehending improper claims for losses, by depreciated emissions of bills of credit; others an evasion  
of proper claims if not positively brought within the authorized functions of the new Govt; and others again  
considering the past debts of the U. States as sufficiently secured by the principle that no change in the Govt. could  
change the obligations of the nation. Besides the indications in the Journal, the history of the period sanctions this  
explanation.But it is to be emphatically remarked, that in the multitude of motions, propositions, and amendments,  
there is not a single one having reference to the terms &quot;Common defence &amp; general welfare&quot;, unless we were so to  
understand the proposition containing them, made on Aug. 25, which was disagreed to by all the States except one.The obvious conclusion to which we are brought is, that these terms copied from the Articles of  
Confederation, were regarded in the new as in the Old Instrument merely as general terms, explained &amp; limited by  
the subjoined specifications; and therefore requiring no critical attention or studied precautionIf the practice of the Revolutionary Congress be pleaded in opposition to this  
view of the case, the plea is met by the notoriety that on several accounts the practice of that Body is not the  
expositor of the &quot;Articles of Confederation&quot;. These Articles were not in force till they were finally ratified by  
Maryland in 1781. Prior to that event the power of Congress was measured by the exigencies of the war, and derived its  
sanction from the acquiescence of the States. After that event, habit and a continued expediency, amounting often to a  
real or apparent necessity, prolonged the exercise of an undefined Authority, which was the more readily overlooked;  
as the members of the Body held their seats during pleasure, as its Acts, particularly after the failure of the Bills  
of Credit, depended for their efficacy on the will of the States; and as its general impotency became manifest. The  
Examples of departure from the prescribed rule, are too well known to require proof. The case of the Old Bank of N.  
America might be cited as a memorable one. The incorporating ordinance grew out of the inferred necessity of such an  
Institution to carry on the war, by aiding the finances which were starving under the neglect or inability of the  
States to furnish their assessed quotas. Congress was at the time so much aware of the deficient Authority, that they  
recommended it to the State Legislatures to pass laws giving due effect to the Ordinance which was done by  
Pennsylvania and several other States.(In a little time, however, so much dissatisfaction arose in Pennsylvania where the Bank was located,  
that it was proposed to repeal the law of the State in support of it. This brought on attempts to vindicate the  
adequacy of the power of Congress, to incorporate such an Institution.) Mr. Wilson, justly distinguished for his  
intellectual powers, being deeply impressed with the importance of a Bank at such a Crisis, published a small pamphlet,  
entitled &quot;Considerations on the Bank of N. America,&quot; in which he endeavored to derive the power from the nature of the Union, in which the Colonies were declared  
&amp; became Independent States; and also from the tenor of the &quot;Articles of Confederation&quot; themselves. But what  
is particularly worthy of notice is, that with all his anxious search in those Articles for such a power, he never  
glanced at the terms &quot;Common Defence &amp; general welfare&quot; as a source of it. He rather chose to rest the claim  
on a recital in the [ ] text, &quot;that for the more convenient management of the general  
interests of the United States, Delegates shall be annually appointed to meet in Congress,  
which he said implied that the United States had general rights,  
general powers, and general obligations, not derived from  
any particular State, nor from all the particular States,  
taken separately; but &quot;resulting from the Union of the whole&quot; these general powers, not  
being controuled by the Article declaring that each State retained all powers not granted  
by the Articles, because &quot;the individual States never possessed &amp; could not retain a general power over the others&quot;The Authority &amp; agreement here resorted to, if proving the ingenuity &amp; patriotic anxiety  
of the author, on one hand, shew sufficiently on the other, that the terms &quot;common defence &amp; general welfare  
cd. not according to the known acceptation of them avail his object.)That the terms in question were not suspected, in the Convention which formed the Constitution of any  
such meaning as has been constructively applied to them may be pronounced with entire confidence. For it exceeds the  
possibility of belief, that the known advocates in the Convention for a jealous grant &amp; cautious definition of  
federal powers, should have silently permitted the introduction of words or phrases in a sense rendering fruitless the  
restrictions &amp; definitions elaborated by them.Consider for a moment the immeasurable difference between the Constitution limited in its powers to  
the enumerated objects; and expanded as it would be by the import claimed for the phraseology in question. The  
difference is equivalent to two Constitutions, of characters essentially contrasted with each other; the one  
possessing powers confined to certain specified cases; the other extended to all cases whatsoever: For what is the  
case that would not be embraced by a general power to raise money, a power to provide for the general welfare, and a  
power to pass all laws necessary &amp; proper to carry the powers into execution; all such provisions and laws  
superseding, at the same time, all local laws &amp; Constitutions at variance with them. Can less be said with the  
evidence before us furnished by the Journal of the Convention itself than that it is impossible that such a  
Constitution as the latter would have been recommended to the States by all the members of that Body whose names were  
subscribed to the Instrument.Passing from this view of the sense in which the terms Common defence &amp; general welfare were used  
by the Framers of the Constitution, let us look for that in which they must have been understood by the  
Conventions, or rather by the people who thro’ their Conventions, accepted &amp; ratified it. And here the evidence  
is if possible still more irresistible, that the terms could not have been regarded as giving a scope to federal  
Legislation, infinitely more objectionable, than any of the specified powers which produced such strenous opposition,  
and calls for amendments which might be safeguards against the dangers apprehended from them.Without recurring to the published debates of the Conventions, which as far as they can be relied on for  
accuracy, would it is believed not impair the evidence furnished by their recorded proceedings, it will suffice to  
consult the lists of amendments proposed by such of the Conventions as considered the powers granted to the new  
Government too extensive or not safely defined.Besides the restrictive &amp; explanatory amendments to the text of the Constitution it may be  
observed, that a long list was premised under the name &amp; in the nature of &quot;Declarations of Rights&quot;; all of them  
indicating a jealousy of the federal powers, and an anxiety to multiply securities against a constructive enlargement  
of them. But the appeal is more particularly made to the number &amp; nature of the amendments proposed to be  
made specific and integral parts of the Constitutional text.No less than seven States, it appears, concurred in adding to their ratifications a series of  
amendments, wch. they deemed requisite. Of these amendments nine were proposed by the Convention  
of Massachusetts, five by that of S. Carolina; twelve by that of  
N. Hampshire; twenty by that of Virginia; thirty three by that  
of N. York; twenty six by that of N. Carolina; twenty one by that  
of R. Island.Here are a majority of the States, proposing amendments, in one instance thirty three by a single State;  
all of them intended to circumscribe the powers granted to the General Government by explanations restrictions or  
prohibitions, without including a single proposition from a single State, referring to the terms, Common defence  
&amp; general welfare; which if understood to convey the asserted power, could not have failed to be the power  
most strenuously aimed at because evidently more alarming in its range, than all the powers objected to put together.  
And that the terms should have passed altogether, unoticed by the many eyes wch. saw danger in terms &amp; phrases  
employed in some of the most minute &amp; limited of the enumerated powers, must be regarded as a demonstration,  
that it was taken for granted that the terms were harmless, because explained &amp; limited, as in the &quot;Articles  
of Confederation&quot;, by the enumerated powers which followed them.A like demonstration, that these terms were not understood in any sense that could invest Congress with  
powers not otherwise bestowed by the Constitutional Charter may be found in what passed in the first Session of the  
first Congress, when the subject of amendments was taken up, with the conciliatory view of freeing the Constitution  
from objections which had been made to the extent of its powers, or to the unguarded terms employed in describing  
them. Not only were the terms &quot;Common defence and General welfare&quot;, unnoticed in the long list of amendments brought  
forward in the outset; but the Journals of Congs. shew that in the progress of the discussions, not a single  
proposition was made in either branch of the Legislature which referred to the phrase as admitting a constructive  
enlargement of the granted powers, and requiring an amendment guarding against it. Such a forbearance &amp;  
silence on such an occasion, and among so many members who belonged to the part of the nation, which called for  
explanatory &amp; restrictive amendments, and who had been elected as known advocates for them, can not be  
accounted for without supposing that the terms &quot;Common defence &amp; General welfare&quot;, were not at that time  
deemed susceptible of any such construction as has since been applied to them.It may be thought perhaps, due to the subject, to advert to a letter of Octr. 5. 1787 to Samuel Adams and  
another of Ocr. 16 of the same year to the Governor of Virginia, from R. H. Lee, in both which, it is seen that the  
terms had attracted his notice, and were apprehended by him &quot;to submit to Congress every object of human Legislation&quot;.  
But it is particularly worthy of Remark, that altho’ a member of the Senate of the U. States, when Amendments to the  
Constitution, were before that House, and sundry additions &amp; alterations were there made to the list sent from  
the other, no notice was taken of those terms as pregnant with danger. It must be inferred that the opinion formed by  
the distinguished member at the first view of the Constitution, &amp; before it had been fully discussed,  
&amp; elucidated, had been changed into a conviction that the terms did not fairly admit the construction he had  
originally put on them; and therefore needed no explanatory precaution agst. it.A final paragraph for the lette

Montpellier, November 21th, 1S30.  
I)kar Sir: I have received your friendly favor of the  
20lh instant, in which you refer to a conversation when I  
had lately the pleasure ol a visit from you, in which you  
mentioned your belief that the terms “common defence  
and general welfare,” in thcSili section of the lirst article

ilefioitc power; and in which I communicated my views ol  
the introduction and occasion of (he terms, as precluding  
that comment on them; nnd you expressed a wish that I  
would repeat those views in tlie answer to your letter.  
However di.siucliiuitl to the discussion of such topics,  
at a time when it is so difficult to separate in the minds of  
many, questions purely constitutional from the party po­  
emica of the day, I yield to the precedents which you  
think I have imposed on myself, and to tho consideration  
that without relying on my personal recollections, which  
your partiality overvalues, I shall derive my construction of  
the passage in question, from sources of information and  
evidence known or accessible to all, who feel the import­  
ance of tlie subject, and arc disposed to give it a patient  
examination.  
In tracing the history and determining the import of the  
erms “common defence and general welfare,” as found in  
(lie text of the Constitution, the following lighl* are furnish­  
ed by tho printed Journal of the Convention which form- I  
ed it.  
I he terms appear in tho gcnor.il propositions offered  
May 2f&gt;lh as a basis for the incipient deliberations; the first  
of which “Resolved that tile articles of the Confederation  
ought to be so corrected ami enlarged as to accomplish  
the objects proposed by their institution, namely: common  
defence, security ol liberty nnd general wellarc.” On the  
1 a&gt; following, the proposition was exchanged for “Resolv­  
ed that an union ol thu States merely federal will not ac­  
complish the objects proposed by the articles of confedera­  
tion, namely: common defence, security of liberty and ge­  
neral welfare.” *  
I he inference from the use here made of tho terms, and  
nem the proceedings on the subsequent propositions is, «l­  
tno common defence and general welfare were objects of  
the Confederation, they were limited objects, which ought  
to be enlarged by an enlargement of the particular powers  
to winch they were limited, and accomplished by a change  
in t io Structure of the Union, from a form merely federal  
Ik &#x27;&quot;nn*tional; and as these terms are prefixed in  
o like re ait Ion to the several legislative powers In the  
now charter, as they wore in tho old, they must be under*  
e o.H to be under li&lt;c limitations in the new as in the old.  
n the cour-io of the proceedings between tho 30th of  
ay am t ie fltli of August, the terms “common defence  
am goncia welfare” as well ns other equivalent terms,  
IVbe*V,r0p^d; for th*&gt;&#x27; An no&lt; appear in tho  
draft of a ( on st l tut ion reported on the day, by a Commit*  
  
toe appointed to prepare owe in detail; the slauxu In which  
tlioee taint were afterwards inserted, being in the Draft  
simply “ I he Legislature) of tho United State* slinll have  
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excis­  
I he manner in which the terms became transplanted  
liorn the old, into the new system ot (&gt;ovenmifiit, is ex­  
plained by a course somewhat adventitiously given to the  
proceedings of the Convention.  
On the 18th of August, among other propositions referred  
to tile ( ommittee which had reported tlie draft, was one  
‘to secure the payment ol the public debt;”and,  
On the same day, was appointed a Committee of eleven  
members, (one (rom each State! “to consider the necessity  
and expediency ot the debts of the several States, being  
assumed by the United States.”  
On the 2lst ol August this last Committee reported a  
clause in the words following: “The Legislature of the  
tinned States shull have power to fulfil the engagements,  
Which have been entered into by Congress, and to dis­  
charge us well the debts of the United States, as the debts  
incurred by the several States, dur ing the late rear, for  
the common defence and general welfare;&quot; conforming  
herein to the 8th ol the articles of the Confederation, the  
language ol which is, that “all charges ot war and all other |  
expences that shall be incurred for the common defence 1  
and general welfare, and allowed by tho United States in &#x27;  
Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common  
treasury,” &amp;c.  
On the 2&#x27;2d of August tho Committee of five reported!  
among other additions to the clause giving power &quot;to lay  
and collect taxes, imposts and exei cs,” a clause in the  
woids lid lowing: “lor payments of the debts and necessary  
expences,” with a proviso qualifying the duration of the  
Revenue luws.  
I his Report being taken up, it was moved, as an!  
mV1: d,a* ‘*,e cfouse should read “the Legislature  
shatt lulhl the engagements and discharge the debtsof the  
United Slates.”  
It w as then moved to strike out “discharge the debts,”  
am! insert “liquidate the claims,” which being rejected, the  
amendment was agreed to as proposed, \iz: “the Legisla­  
tiiui shall !ultil (ho engagements and discharge the debts  
ol the United Slates.”  
On the 23d ol August (lie clause was made to read “(lie  
legislature shall lulhl the engagements and discharge tho i  
debts ol the United States, and shall have the power to lay  
and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises;” the two  
pow erai relating to taxes and debts being merely transposed.  
On tbe 25th ol August, the clause was again altered so  
as to read “all debts contracted and engagements entered j  
Into by or under tho authority ol Congress [the Revolution- |  
ary ( ongress] shall be as valid under this Constitution as  
under the Confederation.”  
I his amendment was followed by a proposition, referring ■  
o the powers (o lay and collect taxes, &amp;c., and to discharge  
the debts [old debts,] to add “lor payment of said debts,  
ami lor defraying tho expences that shall be incurred for ;  
ie common defence and general u-rljare.&quot; The pro­  
position was disagreed to, one State only voting (or it.  
September 4.—The committee ol eleven reported the  
following modification—“The Legislature shall have pow­  
er to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises,  
° P*y, “to debts and provide for the common defence and  
general welfare;” thus retaining the terms of Iho articles  
® , Lonrederation, and covering by (he general term  
“debts those ol the old Congress.  
A special provision in this mode could not have been ne­  
cessary for tho debts of the new Congress: For a power

as nought into view; and it is a fair presumption, from  
the course ol the varied propositions which have been  
noticed that but for the old debts, and their association  
f&gt;&gt; A? ,e,;ms “co,n,1,on defence and general wel­  
•ire, the clauso would have remained as rcpoitcd in  
me nrst draft ol a constitution, expressing generally “a  
powei in Congress to lay and collect taxes,duties, imposts  
anil excises; w ithout any addition of the phrase “to pro­  
... , e c&lt;?&quot;mion defence and general welfare.” With  
us adil|t|°n, indeed, the language of the clause being in  
conformity with that ol the clause in the articles of Con­  
fdcration, 11 .&#x27;vou,d he qualified, as in those articles, by  
t te spedfication ol powers subjoined to it. Rut there is  
suinciont reason to suppose that the terms in question  
would not have been introduced hut for (he introduction of  
the old debts, with which they happened to stand in a fa­  
miliar tho inoperative relation. Thus introduced, how­  
°f Vl’ c l&gt;assc&lt;l &#x27;&quot;*&lt;lis“ubcd thro* tho subsequent stages  
  
i ,.wny ,ne terms “common defence and  
^ leral welfare, if not meant to convey the comprehcn­  
sive power which, taken literally, they express, were not  
qualified and explained by some reference to the particu­  
lar power subjoined, (lie answer is at hand, that altho’ it  
might easily have been done, and experience shews it  
might be well if it had been done, yet the omission is ac­  
counted for by an inattention to the phraseology, occasion­  
Z..,J»°UVt #?-by i&lt;len,i,y &#x27;vi,l‘ ,h« harmless character  
rowed in*,rU,&quot;&#x27;,&quot;t fro,u w,,ich it was bor­  
But may it not be asked with infinitely more propriety  
and without the possibility of a satisfactory answer, wi.ji  
it the terms were meant to embrace not only all the powers  
particularly expressed, but (lie indefinite pow er which lias  
been claimed under (hem, the intention was not so declar­  
ed; why on that supposition so much critical labor was  
employed in enumerating the particular powers and in de­  
fining and limiting their extent?  
The variations and vicissitudes in the modification of the  
clause In Which the terms ••common defence and general  
wel ire appear, are remarkable; and to be no otherwise  
explained than by differences of opinion concerning the ne­  
cessity or tiie form ot a constitutional provision for the  
debts ol the Revolution; some of thejnembero apprehend­  
ing improper claims for losses by depreciated bills of credit;  
others an evasion of proper claims if not positively brought  
within the authorised functions of the new government:  
and other* again considering the past debts of the United  
• ales as sufficiently secured by the principle that no  
change in the Government could change the obligations of  
lie nation. Resides (he indications in the Journal, (lie  
history ol the period sanctions (his explanation.  
Rut, it is to he emphatically remarked, that in the mul­  
titude ol motions, propositions and amendments, there is  
not a single one having reference lo the terms “common  
defence and general welfare,” unless we were so to un­  
derstand the proposition containing them, made on August  
-oth which was disagreed to by all the States except one. I  
I lie obvious conclusion to which we are brought, is,  
that these terms copied from the articles of Confederation,  
wcie regarded in the new, as in the old instrument,  
merely as general terms, explained and limited by the  
subjoined specifications, and therefore requiring no critical  
attention or .studied precaution.  
It the practice ol the Revolutionary Congress he plead­  
ed in opposition to this view ol the case, the plea is met by  
me notoriety that on several accounts the practice of that  
body is not the expositor of the &quot;articles of Confederation.”  
I hose articles were not in force till they were finally rati­  
lied, by Maryland in 1781. Prior to (hat event, the power  
ot Congress was measured by the exigenciesof the war, and  
denved ils sanction from the acquiescence of the States.  
Alter that event, habit, and a continued expediency,  
amounting often to a real or apparent necessity, prolonged  
the exercise of an undefined authoiity, which was the  
more readily overlooked, as tho members of the body  
held their seats during pleasure, as its acts, particularly ai­  
ter the failure of the Rills ot credit, depended for their :  
j efficacy on the will of the .States; and as its general impo­  
| tency became manifest. Kx&#x27;imples of departure from the  
prescribed rule, are too well known lo require proof. The  
j case ol the old Rank of North America might he cited as a  
j memorable one. I he incorporating ordinance grew out of  
the inferred necessity of such an institution to carry on the  
j war, by aiding the finances which were starving under the  
; neglect or inability of the States to furnish their assessed  
quotas. Congress was at the time so much aware of the  
j deficient authority, that they recommended it to the State  
i Ucgi-latures to pass laws giving due effeet lo the ordinance,  
j which was done by lYiuisyivania and several other Stales.  
Mr. \\ ilson, justly distinguished for his intellectual pow­  
ers, being deeply impressed with tho importance of a  
Rank at such a crisis, published a small pamphlet, entitled  
“Considerations on the Rank ot North America,” in which  
lie endeavored to derive the power from the nature, of the  
Union, in which the colonics were declared and became  
I Independent States; and also from the tenor of the “aril*  
I °f Confederation* themselves. Rut what is particu­  
| larly worthy or notire, is, that with all his anxious search  
I in those articles for such a power, he ncvcV glanced at the  
| terms “common defence and general welfare,” a* a source  
j of it. He rather chpse to rest the claim on a recital in the  
: lext, “lint for the more convenient management ol the  
j general interests of the United States, Delegates shall  
be annually appointed to meet in Congress, which he said  
j implied that the I■ nited Staten had general right*, general  
i powers and general obligations, not derived from any par­  
ticular State, nor from all the particular States, taken sepa­  
j rately, hilt “mulling from the Union of the whole;”  
! general powers, not being eontrolod by the article  
j declaring that each Slate retained all powers not granted  
I by the articles, because “the individual Stn tes never pos­  
sessed and could not retain a general power over the  
others.  
  
\ M &quot;Uinwuy nnn argument licro rowforl fo, if proving  
i the ingenuity and patriotic anxiety of the author, on one  
hand, shew suflicirntly on the other, that the terms “com­  
i mon defence and general welfare,” could not, according  
to the known acceptation of them, avail his object.  
f hat the terms in question were not suspected in the  
| Convention which formed the Constitution, of any such  
! meaning as has been constructively applied to them, may  
&#x27; pronounced with entire confidence. For it exceeds the  
j possibility of belief, thnt the known advocates in tho Con­  
vention (or a jealous grant ami cautious definition of fede­  
: ral powers, should have silently permitted the introduction  
ol words or phrase*, in a *cn«e rendering fruitless the re­  
strictions amt definitions clahoiafcd by them.  
(. (insider for a moment tho immeasurable difference be­  
tween the Constitution, limited in its powers to the enti­  
i rnoiated objects; and expanded as it would be by the im  
‘ port claimed for the. phraseology In question. The differ­  
  
«nca m equivalent to two Constitutions, of characters es  
sentlally contrasted with each other; the one possessing  
powers conhmnl to certain specified cases; the other ex  
tended to all cases whatsoever: For what is the case tha  
would not be embraced by a general power to raise mo  
ney, a power to provide for the general welfare, and a pow  
J er to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry these  
I f,0&#x27;ver* Into execution; all such provisions and laws super­  
&quot;eding at the same time, all local laws and Constitutions ai  
variance w ith them? Can ie«s be said with the evidence  
before us, hiruished by the Journal of the Convention it­  
■* than that it is impossible that such a Constitution i»h  
the latter, would have been recommended to the Slates by  
•ill (lie members ol that body w hose names were subscrib­  
ed to the instrument?  
Passing from this view of the sense in which the terms,  
common defence and general welfare, were used by the  
framers of the Constitution, let us look for that in which  
they must have been understood by the Conventions, or  
lather by the people who, thro’ their Conventions, accept­  
ed and ratified it And here the evidence is, if possible, still  
more irresistible, that the terms could not have been re­  
garded as giving a scope to Federal legislation, infinitely  
more objectionable, than any of the specified powers which  
produced nidi strenuous opposition, and eall^ for amend­  
ments which might be safeguards against the dangers an­  
prelielidcd Irom them.  
Without recurring to the published debates of those  
Com entions, which, as far as they can be relied on for ac­  
curacy, would.it is believed, not impair the evidence fur­  
n,i . t,,e&#x27;.r recorded proceedings, it will suffice to con­  
sult the lists ol amendments proposed by such of the Con­  
ventions as considered the powers granted to the Govern­  
ment, too extensive, or not safely defined.  
Hoiiles the reductive and explanatory amendments to  
the text ol the Constitution,U may be observed, that a long  
,t w“* promised under the name and in the nature ol  
“Declaration* of Rights;” allot&#x27; them indicating a jealou­  
sy ol the Federal powers, and an anxiety to multiply se­  
curities against a constructive enlargement of them. ‘ lint  
the appeal is more particularly made to the number and  
nature ol the amendments, proposed to be %ado specific  
and integral parts ol the Constitutional text.  
No less than seven States, it appears, concurred in ad­  
ding to their ratifications, a series or amendments, which  
they deemed requisite. Of these amendments, nine were  
proposed by the Convention of Massachusetts; Vice by that  
ol South Carolina; twelve by that of New Hampshire;  
twenty by that of Virginia; thirty-three by that of New  
i oik, tioent y-tix by that ol North Carolina; ttcentu-one  
by that of Rhode Island.  
Here are a majority of the .Status, proposing amend­  
ments, in one instance thirty-three by a single State; all of  
them intended to circumscribe the power granted to the  
(•rncral Government, by explanations, restrictions,or pro­  
hibitions, without including a single proposition from a sin­  
gle Mate referring to the terms, common defence and ge­  
nei.il welfare; which il understood to convey the asserted  
pow ci, could not have iailed lobe the power most strenous­  
ly aimed at, because evidently more alarming in its range,  
than all the powers objected to put together. And (hat  
the terms should have passed, altogether unnoticed bv the  
many eyes which saw danger in terms and phrases em­  
ployed III some ol the most minute aud-Jimitcd of the enu­  
incrated powers, must be regarded as a demonstration, that  
■t^was taken lor granted, that the terms were harmless, be­  
cause explained and limited, as in the “articles of Con­  
federation,” by the enumerated powers which followed  
(hem.  
A like demonstration, that these terms wore not under­  
stood in any sense that could invest Congress with powers  
not otherw ise bestowed by the Constitutional Charter, may  
tie round In what ptwod in tho lii-at ae.aUn of the first Con­  
gress, when the subject of amendments was taken up with  
the conciliatory view of freeing the Constitution Irom ob­  
jections, which had been made to the extent of its powers  
or to the unguarded terms employed in describing them.&#x27;  
Not only^ were the terms “common defence and general  
welfare,” unnoticed in the long list of amendments brought  
forward in the outset; but the Journals ol Congress shew  
that in the progress of the discussions, not a single propo­  
Miion was made in cither branch of the Legislature, which  
referred to the phrase as admitting a constructive enlarge­  
ment ol the granted powers, and requiring an amendment  
guarding against it. Such a forbearance and silence on  
such an occasion, and among so many members who be­  
longed to the part of the nation which called for explana­  
tory and restrictive amendments, and who had been elect­  
ed as known advocates for them, cannot be accounted lor  
without supposing that the terms “common defence and  
general welfare,” were not at that time deemed suscepti­  
ble ol any such construction as has since been applied to  
them.  
  
ii m.iy oe inougin perhaps, Hue to the subject, to advert  
to a letter of October 5th, 1787, to Samuel Adams,and ano  
ther of October 16th of the same year, to the Governor of  
Virginia, Irom R. H. I.ce, in both which, it is seen that  
(he terms had attracted his notice, and were apprehended  
by him “to submit to Congress every object of human le­  
gislation.” But It is particularly worthy of remark, that  
allho a member of the Senate of the United States, when  
amendments to the Constitution were before lliat House,  
and sundry additions and alterations were there made to  
(he list sent from the other, no notice was taken of those  
terms, as pregnant with danger. It must tie inferred that  
« fnrnmit hv the distintriiished member at tin.  
first view ot the Constitution, and belore ii 7,.A,  
discussed and elucidated, had been changed into a eonvic^  
lion that the terms did not fairly admit the construction he  
had originally put on them; and therefore needed no ex­  
planatory precaution against it.  
I close these remarks, which I fear may be found tedious  
with assurances ol my great esteem and best regards.

Jefence and general welfare” first appear in the  
,.„al propositions ofiVred in the Convention  
•at formed the Constitution as a basis for the iu.  
pleat deliberations; the first of which “ Re­  
j,ed that the articles of the Confederation  
ajM to be so corrected and enlarged as to ac­  
joplUh the objects proposed by their institution,  
. common defence, security of liberty and  
welfare.” On the day following, the  
  
proportion was exchanged for “ Resolved that  
in union of the States merely federal will not  
icconplnh the objects proposed by the articles  
vt conf delation, namely: common defence, se­  
curity ol liberty and general welfare.”  
lie then goes on to state, that the proper infe­  
rence from the use here made of the terms, and  
from the proceedings on the subsequent proposi­  
lioii. is, although common defence and general  
vlfare were objects ot the Confederation, they  
were limited objects, which ought to be enlarged  
!&gt;» an enlargement of the particular powers to  
•Inch they were limited, and accomplished by a  
cmnje in the structure of the Union, from a  
iirm merely federal to one partly national; and  
mthese terms, are prefixed in the like relation to  
•je several legislative powers in the new charter, !  
uthey «en* in the old, they must be understood  
to he under like limitations in the new as in the  
old  
He thinks there is sufficient reason to suppose,  
lit the terms in question would not have been  
ntrmluced into the Constitution but for the in- j  
&#x27; wl&#x27;ictum of the old debts, with which they hap­  
to stand in a familiar though inoperative  
■•ilium. Thus introduced, however, they pass­  
si uxlistmlied through the subsequent stages of  
lie Constitution.  
If it be a-keif, he adds, why the terms “ com­  
r &#x27; defence ami general welfare,” i! not meant  
■ c&#x27;l.vev the comprehensive power which, taken  
ferally, tliev express, were not qualified and  
Jip.aiu«l by some reference to tbe particular

-ihit might easily have been done, and expe­  
«ce shews it might be well if it had been done,  
e ‘he omission is accounted for by an inatten­  
&quot;i&gt; to lie phraseology, occasioned, doubtless, by

Mowtrerier, November 27th, 1530.  
  
Dear Sir: I have received yonr friendly favor of the WOth instant, in  
which you refer to a conversation when I had lately the pleasure of a  
visit from you, in. which you mentioned your belief that the terms  
“common defence and general welfare,”’ in the 8th section of the first  
aracle of the Constitution of the U. States, were still regarded by some  
as couveying to Congress a substantive and indefinite power; and in  
which | communicated my views of the introduction and occasion of the |  
terms, as — that comment on them: and you expressed a |  
wish that | would repeat those views in the answer to your letter. |  
  
However disinclined to the discussion of sach topies, at a time when  
it is so difheull to separate, in the minds of many, questions purely con- &#x27;  
stitutioual from the party polemics of the day. ] yield to the precedents |  
which you think I have imposed on myself, and to the consideration  
that, without relying on my personal recollectious, which your partiality  
overvalues, | shall derive my construction of the passage i question  
from sources of information and evidence known or accessible to all  
who feel the importance of the subject, and are disposed to give ita  
pauent examination.  
  
In tracing the history and determining the import of the terms  
‘common defence aud general welfare,’ as foumd in the teat of the |  
Constitution, the following lights are furnished by the printed Journal |  
{the Convention which formed it.  
  
The terms appear in the general propositions, offered May 29th, as a  
basis for the incipient deliberations ; the first of which “ Resolved that  
the Articles of the Confederation ought to be so corrected and enlarged |  
  
;  
&#x27;  
|  
  
  
  
’8 to accomplish the objects proposed by their institution, womer!  
common detence, security of liberty,and general welfare.” On the  
day following, the proposition was exchanged for “ Resolved that an  
union of the States merely federal will not accomplish the objects pro- |  
posed by the Articles of Confederation, namely: common deleure, |  
security of liberty, and general welfare.”  
  
The inference fiom the use here made of the terms, and from the |  
proceedings on the subsequent propositions, is, although common de- |  
lence and general welfare were objects of the Confederation, they |  
were limited objects, which ought to be enlarged by an enlargement of |  
the particular powers to which they were limited, and accomplished by |  
a change in the stracture of the Union, from a form merely federal to |  
  
ne partly national; aud, as these terms are prefixed in the likerelation  
io the several legislative powers in the new charter, as they were in the |  
old, they nast be understood to be under like limitations im the new as |  
in the old.  
  
In the course of the proceedings between the 30th of May, and the |  
‘th of August, the terms “common defence and geueral welfare,”  
is well as other equivalent terms, must have been dropped; forthey do  
not appear in the Draft of a Constitution reported on the latter day, bya  
Committee appointed to prepare one in detail; the clanse tm which |  
those terms were afterwards inserted, being, in the Draft, simply, “ The  
Legislature of the United States shall have power to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.”  
  
The manuer in which the terms became transplanted from the old, into

On the 25th of August, the clause was again altered so as to read ‘all hat “resulting from the Union of the whole ;” these general powers,  
  
This amendment was followed by a proposition, referring to the pow- |  
  
The  
proposition was disagreed to, one State only voting for it.  
September 4.—The Committee of Eleven reported the following  
moditication—“* The Legislature shall nave power to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the  
  
common defence and general welfare ;”’ thus retaining the terms of the  
|Articles of Confederation, and covering by the general, term “ debts,  
those of the old Congress.  
  
A special provision in this mode could not have been necessary for  
  
the debts of the new Cougress: For a power to provide money, and a  
  
power to perform certain acts, of which money is the ordinary and ap-  
propriate means, must, of course, carry with them a power to pay the  
Nor was any speaaf provision ior  
debts proposed till the case of the Revolutionary Debts was brought  
into view; and itis a fair presumption, from the course of the varied  
propositions which have been noticed, that, but for the old debts. and  
common defence and genera! welfare,”  
  
stitution, expressing generally ** a power in Congressto lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises ;” without any addition of the phrase  
‘‘to provide for the common defence and general welfare.’ With this  
addition, indeed, the language of the clause being in conformity with  
that of the clause in the Articles of Coafederation, it would be qualiti-  
ed, as in those Articles, by the specification of powers subjoined to tt.  
Dut there is sufficient reason to suppose that the terms in questien  
would not have been introduced but for the introduction ef the old  
debts, with which they happened to stand in a familiar thouga inopera-  
tive relation. Thus introdaced, however, they passed undisturbed  
through the subsequeut stages of the Constitation.  
  
If it be asked why the terms *‘ common defence and general welfare,  
if not meant to convey the comprehensive power which, taken literally,  
they express, were not qualiiied and explamed by some reference to the  
particular power subjoined, the answer is at hand, that, although « might  
eastly have been done, and experience shows it nught be well if it bad  
been done, yet the omissivn is accounted for by an inattention ‘to the  
phraseology, occasioned, doubtless, by its identity with the harmless  
character attached to it in the instrument from which it was bor-  
rowed. a |  
  
But may it not be asked, with infinitely more propriety, and without  
the possibility of a satisfactory answer, why, if the terms were meant  
te embrace not only ali the powers particularly expressed, but the in- |  
definite power which has been claimed under them, the intention was  
  
‘hot so declared; why, on that supposition, so much critical labor was |  
  
limiting their extent?  
The variations and vicissitudes in the modification of the clause in|  
which the terms “ common defence and general welfare” appear, are  
remarkable; and to be not otherwise explained than by differences of  
opinion concerning the necessity or the form of a constitutional provi-  
sion for the debts of the Revolution; some of the members apprehending  
improper claims for losses by depreciated bills of cred.t; others an eva-  
sion of proper claims if not positively brought within the authorized  
functions of the new Government; and others, again, considering the  
past debta of the United States as sufficiently secured by the priaciple  
that no change in the Government could change the obligations of the |  
nation. Besides the indicatious in the Journal, the history of the period |  
sanctions this explanation.  
But, it is to be emphatically remarked, that, iu the multitude of mo- |  
tions, propositions, and amendments, there is not a single one having |  
reference to the terms *‘common defence and general welfare,” unless |  
we were 30 to understand the proposition containing them, made on  
Augast 25th. which was disagreed to by all the States except one.  
  
;  
  
The obvious conclusion to which we are brought, is, that these terms, |  
  
copied from the Articles of Confederation, were regarded in the new,  
as in the old instrament, merely as general terms, explained and limited  
  
by the subjoined specifications, and therefore requiring no critical at-| gether.

the new system of Government, is explained by a course somewhat ad- tion to this view of the case. the plea is met by the notoriety that, on  
  
ventitiously given to the proccedings of the Convention.  
  
Un the Icth of August, among other propositions referred to the  
Committee which had reported the Draft, was one ‘‘ to secure the pay-  
ment of the Public Debt ;” and,  
  
On the same day, was appointed a Committee of eleven Members,  
(one from each State) ‘to consider the necessity and expediency of the

On the 21st of August this last Committee re  
words following: “The Legislature of the United States shall have  
power to fulfilthe engagements which hare been entered into by Con-

debts incurred by the several States during the late war, for the

“ Articles of Confederation.” ‘These Articles were not in force till they  
were or ratified by Maryland in 1731. Prior to that event, the  
power of Congress was measured by the exigencies of the war, and  
derived its sanction from the acquiescence of the States. After that  
évent, habit, and a continued expediency, amounting often to a  
real or apparent necessity, prolonged the exercise of an undefined au-  
  
d aclanae in the | thority, which was the more readily overlooked, as the members of the  
  
body held their seats during pleasure, as its acts, particularly after the  
failure of the Bills of credit, depended for their efficacy on the will of the  
States; and as its general impotency became manifest. Examples of de-  
  
ure from the ibed rule,are too well known to require proof. The  
of North America might be cited as a memorabie  
  
quest ti.  
  
| Constitution. it may be observed, that a long  
  
not being controlled by the article declaring that each State retained al/  
powers not granted by the articles, because “the individual States nere,  
possessed and could not retain a general power over the others.”  
  
‘The authority and argument here resorted to, if proving the ingenui-  
  
ty and patriotic anxiety of the author, on one hand, shows sufficiently,  
on the other, that the terms “‘common defence and general welfare,”  
could not, according to the known acceptation of them, avail his  
object.  
  
That the terms in qrestion were not suspected, in the Convention  
  
which formed the Constitution, of any such meaning as has been eon-  
  
structively applied to them, may be pronounced with entire confidence.  
For it exceeds the possibility of belief, that the known advocates in the  
Convention fer a jealous grant and cautious defimtion of federal pow-  
ers, should have sileutly-permitted the introduction of wortis er  
phrases, in a sense rendering fruitless the restrictions and definitions  
  
elaborated by them.  
  
Consider for a moment the immeasurable difference between the  
Constitut yn, lim ted in its pov.ers to the enumerated objects, and ex-  
panded as it would be by the import claimed for the phraseology in  
The diterence ts equivalent to two Constitutions, of char-  
acters esseutia!ly contrasted with each other; tha one possessing powers  
confined to certain specified cases; the other extended to all cases  
whatsoever: For what isthe case that would not be embraced by a  
general power to raise inoney, a power to provide for the general wel-  
fare, and a power to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry these  
powers into execution ; all such provisions and laws superséding, at the  
time, all focal Laws and Constitutions at variance with them ?  
Can less be said with the evidence before us, furnished by the Journal!  
of the Convention itself, than that it is impossible that sach a Con-  
stitution as the latter, would have been recommended to the States  
by all the members of. that body, whose names were subscribed to the  
instrument ?  
  
Passing from this view of the sense In which the terms common de-  
fence and general weliure were used b; framers of the Constitu-  
tion, let us look for that in which they must have been understood by  
the Conventions, or rathe: by the people who, through their Conven-  
tions, accepted and ratified it. And here the evidence is, if possible,  
still more irresistible, that the terms cculd not have been regarded as  
giving a scope to Federal legislation, infinitely more objectionable  
than any of the speciCed powers which preduced such strenuous oppo-  
sition and calls for amendments Which might be safeguards against the  
dangers apprebended from them.

Without recurring to the published debates of those Conventions,  
which, as far as they ean be relied on for accuracy, would, it is believed,  
not unpair the evidence furnished by their recorded proceedings, it  
will suihce to consu!t the lists of amendments proposed by such of U  
Conventions as considered the powers granted to the Government, too  
extensive, or not safely cefined.

_appeal is more particularly made to the number and nature of the  
  
amendments. proposed to be made specific and integral parts of the  
constitutional text.  
No less than seven States, it appears, concurred m adding to then  
  
| ratifications a series of amendments, which they deemed requisite.  
  
Of these amendments mine were proposed by the Convention of Mas-  
sachusetts ; fire by that of South Carolina: teelre by that of New  
Hampshire, tarenty by that of Virguna; thirty-three by that of New  
York ; twenty-six by that of North Carolina; ticenty-one by that of  
Rhode Island.

instance thirty-three by a single State; all of them intended to cireum-

a single State reterring to the terms common defence and genera!

have failed to be the power inost strenuously aimed at, because evident-  
ly more alarming im its range than all the powers objected to put to-  
And that the terms should have passed altogether unnoticed  
by the many eyes which saw danger im terms and phrases employed in

be regarded as a demonstration, that it was taken for grauted, that the  
terms were harmless, because explained and Jumited, as in the “ Ar-  
ticles of Confederation,’ by the enumerated powers which followed  
them.  
  
A like demonstration, that these terms were not understood in any  
sense that could invest Congress with powers not otherwise bestowed  
by the Constitational Charter, may be found in what passed in the first  
session of the first Congress, when the subject of amendments was  
taken up. with the conciliatory view of freeing the Constitatien from  
objections which had been made to the extent of its powers, or to the  
unguarded terms employed in describing them. Not only were the  
terms “‘common defence and genera! welfare,” unnoticed in the  
list of amendments brought forward in the outset; but the Journals”

to the phrase as admitting a constructive enlargement of the granted |  
powers, and requiring an awendment guarding against it. Such a)  
forbearance and silence on such an occasion, and among so many mem- |  
bers who belonged to the part of the nation which called for explanato- |

advocates for them, cannot be accounted for, without supposing that |  
the terms “common defence and general welfare,” were not at that,

it is seen that the terms had attracted his notice, and were apprehended |  
by him “to submit to Congress every object of human legislation.

Moktpelier, Nov&#x27;r. 27th, 1830.  
Dear Sir : I have received your friendly favor of  
the 20th inst. in which you refer to a conversation  
when i had ktely the pleasure of a visit from you, jn  
which you mentioned your belief that the terms &quot;com­  
mon defence and general welfare,&quot; in the 8th section  
of the first article of tiie Constitution of the United  
States, were still regarded by some as conveying to  
Congress a substantive and indefinite power; and in  
which 1 communicated my views o!&quot; the introduction  
and occasion of the terms, as precluding that comment  
on them ; and you expressed a wish that I would re­  
peat those views in the answer to your letter.  
However disinclined to the discussion of such topics,  
at a time when it is so dilHcult to separate in the  
minds of many, questions purely constitutional from  
the party polemics of the day, 1 yield to the prece­  
dents which you think 1 have imposed on myself, and  
to the consideration that without relying on my per­  
sonal recollections, -which your partiality overvalues,  
I shall derive my construction ol the passage in ques­  
tion, from sources of information and evidence known  
or accessible to all, who feel the importance of the  
subject, and are disposed to give it a patient examina­  
tion.In tracing the history and determining the import  
of the terms u common defence and general welfare,&quot;  
as found in the text of the Constitution, the following  
lights are furnished by the printed Journal of the  
Convention which formed it.  
The terms appear in the general propositions ofler­  
ed May 29th as a basis for the incipient deliberations;  
the first, of which &#x27;&#x27;Resolved that the articles of Con­  
federation ought to be so corrected and enlarged as  
to accomplish the objects proposed by their institution,  
namely: common defence, security of liberty and  
general weliare.&quot; On the day following, tiie propo  
sition -was exchanged for u Resolved that an union of

posts and excises,&quot; the two powers relating to taxes  
and debts being merely transposed. ;  
On the 25th of August, the clause was again al­  
tered so as to read &quot;all debts contracted and engage  
ments entered into bv or under the authority of Con-  
I gress the Revolutionary Congress shall be as valid  
under this Constitution as under the Confederation.  
This amendment was followed bv a proposition  
referring to the nowera to lav and collect taxes, &amp;C,

uiuu ueieuce ana general welfare ; thus retaining  
the terms oi the articles of Confederation, and cover­  
ing by the general term debts&quot; those of the old Con  
gress.  
A special provision in this mode could nnt h,  
M w a V.V V  
been necessary for the debts of the new Congress:  
For a power to provide money, and a power to per­  
form certain acts of which money is the ordinary and  
appropriate means, must, of course, carry with them,  
a power to pay the expense of performing the acts.  
Nor was any special prevision for debts proposed till  
the case of the Revolutionary debts was brought into  
view; and it is a fair presumption, from the course of  
the varied propositions which liave been noticed that  
but for the old debts, and their association &quot; with the  
terms u common defence and general welfare,&quot; the  
clause would have remained as reported in the first  
draft of a constitution, expressing generally power  
in Congress to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts  
and excises j&quot; without any addition of the phrase &quot;to  
provide lor thecommon defence and general welfare.  
With this addition, indeed, the language of the clause  
being in conformity with that of the clause in the ar­  
tides of Confederation, it would be qualified, as in  
those articles, by the specification of powers subjoined  
to it. But tliere is sufficient reason to suppose that&#x27;  
the terms in question would not. have ben introduced  
but lor the introduction of the old debts, with which  
they happened to stand in a familiar tho inoperative  
relation. Thus introduced, however, they passed  
undisturbed through the subsequent stages of the  
Constitution.  
If it be asked why the terms &quot;common defence and  
general welfare,&quot; if not meant to convey the compre­  
hensive power which, taken literally, they express,  
were not qualified and explained by some reference  
to particular power subjoined, the answer is at hand,  
that although it might easily have been done, and  
experience shews it might be well if it had been done,  
yet the omission is accounted for by an inattention to  
the phraseology, occasioned, doubtless, by its identity  
with the harmless character attached to it m the in­  
strument from which it was borrowed.  
But may it not be asked with infinitely more pro­  
priety, and without the possibility ; of a satisfactory  
answer, why if the terms were meant to embrace not  
only all the powers particularly expressed, but the in­  
definite power which has been claimed under them,  
the intention was not so declared; why on that sup­  
position so much critical labor was employed in enu­  
merating the particular , owiers and in defining and  
limiting their extent?  
The variations and vicissitudes in the modification  
of the clause in which the terms &quot;common defence  
and general welfare&quot; appear, are remarkable ; and to  
: be no otherwise explained than by differences of opin  
ion concerning the necessity or the form of a constitu­  
tional provision for the debts of the Revolution; some  
of the members apprehending improper claims for  
losses by depreciated bill of credit; others an evasion  
! plea is met by the notoriety that on several accounts

S tL111:11 -i1 .a.cn&#x27;.ing to the known acceptation  
ot them, avail hia object!  
That the terms in question were not suspected in  
the Convention which formed the OonsUmtion, of  
any such meaning as has been constructively applied  
to them, may be pronounced with entire confidence,  
F or lt.exceeds the possibility of belief, that the known  
advocates m the Convention for a jealous grant and  
cautious definition of federal powers, should have  
silently permitted the introduction of words or phrases,  
in a sense rendering fruitless the restrictions and de­  
finitions elaborated by them.  
Consider for a moment the immeasurable differ­  
ence between the Constitution, limited in its powers  
to the enumerated objects ; and expanded as it would  
be by the import chimed for the phraseology in ques-1  
tion. The difierence ia eauivalent to two Constitu  
tions, of characters essentially contrasted with each  
other ; the one possessing powers confined to certain  
specineo cases ; the other extended to all cases what­  
soever : For what is the case that would not be em­  
braced by a general power to raise money, a power  
to provide for the general welfare, and a power to  
pass all laws necessary and proper to carry these  
powers into execution ; all such provisions and laws  
superseding at the same time, all local laws and Con­  
BUtutioua at variance with them? Can less be paid  
with the evidence before us, furnished by the Journal  
of the Convention itself, than that it is impossible  
that such a Constitution as the latter, would have  
been recommended to the States by all the member  
of that body whose names were subscribed to tle  
instrument.  
Passing from this view of the sense in which the  
terms common defence and general welfare, were  
used by the Framers of the Constitution, let us look  
for that in which they must have been understood by  
the Conventions, or rather by the people who, tlntV  
their Conventions, accepted and ratified it. And  
here the evidence is, if possible, still more irresistible,  
that the terms could not have been regarded as giv­  
ing a scope to Federal legislation, infinitely more  
objectionable, than any of the specified powers which  
produced such strenuous opposition, and calls for  
amendments which might be safeguards against the,  
dangers apprehended from them.  
V ithout recurring to the published debates of the  
Conventions, which, as far as they can be relied on  
for accuracy,-would, it is belived, not impair the evi­  
dence, furnished by their recorded proceedings, if  
will suffice to consult the lists of amendments propo­  
sed by such of the Conventions as considered the  
powers granted to the Government, too extensive, or  
not safely defined.  
Besides the restrictive and explanatory amendments  
to the text of the Constitution, it may be observed,  
that a long list was premised under the name and in  
the nature of &quot; Declarations of Rights all of them  
indicating a jealousy of the Federal powers, and an  
anxiety to multiply securities against a constructive  
enlargement of them. But the appeal is more par­  
ticularly made to the number and nature of the  
amendments, proposed to be made specific and inte­  
gral parts of the Constitutional text.  
No less than seven States, it appears, concurred, ijft  
adding to their ratifications, a series of amendments,  
which they deemed requisite. Of these amendment p.  
nine were proposed by the Convention of Massa­  
chusetts; Ji ve by that of South Carolina ; twelve  
by that ol &#x27;New Hampshire; twenty by that ofVir­  
gmia ; thirty-three by that of New York ; twenty-sir  
by that of North Carolina; twenty-one by that ot  
Rhode Island.  
Here are a majority ofthe States, proposingamenri  
ments, in one instance thirty-three by a single Stated;  
all of them intended to circumscribe the power grant­  
ed to the General Government, by explanations, res­  
trictions, or prohibitions, without including a single  
proposition from asingle State; referring to the term?,  
common defence and general welfare; which if under­  
stood to convey the asserted power, could not have  
failed to be the power most strenuously aimed at, be­  
cause evidently more alarming in its range, than all ther  
powers objected to put together. And that the terms  
should have passed, altogether unnoticed by the many  
eyes which saw danger in terms and phrasesemployed  
in some of the most minute and limited of the enume­  
rated powers, must be regarded as a demonstratioi  
that it was taken for granted, that the terms wer  
harmless, because explained and limited, as in the  
&quot; article of Confederation,&quot; by the enumerated jiow  
ers which followed them.  
A like demonstration, that these terms were nd.  
understood in any sense that could invest Congrcrv  
with powers not otherwise bestowed by the Constitu­  
tional Charter, may be found in what passed in the  
first session of the first Congress, when the sub ject of  
amendments waa taken up, with the conciliatory  
view of freeing the Constitution from objections-,  
which had been made to the extent of its&quot; powers, ok  
the unguarded terms employed in describing them.  
Not only were the terms &quot;common defence and gene­  
ral welfare,&quot; unnoticed in the long list of amendment  
brought forward in the outset; but the Journals of  
Congress shew that in the progress ofthc discussions,  
not a single proposition was made in riti er branch ct  
the Legislature, which referred to the phraso as admitting  
a constructive enlargement ci the grah ted  
powers, and requiring an amendment guarding  
against it. Such a forbearance and silence on such  
an occasion and among so many members who be­  
longed to the part of the nation which called for ex­  
planatory and restrictive amendments, and who had  
been elected as known advocates for them, cannot be  
accounted for, without supposing that the terms &quot;com­  
mon defence and general welfare,&quot; were not at that  
time deemed susceptible of any such construction ua  
has since been applied to them.  
It may be thought perhaps, due to tho subject, to  
advert to a letter of October 5th,. 1787, to Samuel  
Adams, and another of October 16th of the same year,  
to the Governor of Virginia, from R. H. Lee, in botU  
which, it is seen that the terms had attracted his no­  
tice, and were apprehended by him &#x27;to submit to Con  
gress every object of human legislation.&quot; But it i &#x27;  
particularly wortny oi remark, that altho, a member  
of the Senate ofthc United States, when amendmsnU  
to the Constitution were before thatHouse. and sundry  
additions and alterations were there made to the li  
sent from the other, no notice was taken of thoso  
terms, as pregnant with danger. It muet be inferred  
that the opinion formed by the distinguished member,  
at the first view of the ConsUtution, and before it had  
been fully discussed and elucidated, had been changed  
into a conviction that the terms did not fairly admit  
the construction he had originally put oh them andT  
therefore needed no explanatory precaution againstif.  
I close these remarks, which I fearmay be found  
tedious, with assurances of great esteem and best re  
gards. . &quot;

If the predict of the Uefolutirmary  
Congress be pleaded in opposition to  
this view of the case, the plea is met by  
tke notoriety that en several acceaots  
the practice of that body if not the et­  
petiturof the &#x27;&#x27;aticUa of Conledera­  
tion&#x27; These articles, were &#x27; not in  
force till they were .finally ratified by  
Maryland in lT8t. Prior o that  
event, the power of Congrea was meas­  
ured by the exigencies of the war, Ind ;  
derived its sanction from the acquies­  
cence of the 9afeal After that event  
habit, aod a continued expediency,&#x27; a  
mounting often to a real or apparent  
necessity, prolonged the exercise of an  
undefined authority, which wi the  
more readily overlooked , as tha., mem­  
bers of the body held their seat during  
pi&#x27;- , as its acts, particularly after  
C faitore of he Bill of credit, depeu­  
d for their eflicacy on the will t the  
e; and&#x27; as its general impotencj  
b ime manifest&#x27;.&#x27; Eiamptes of depar­  
tu from theprescribed rule, are too  
wei. known to require proof. The  
case of the old Bank of North America  
might be cited ac a memorable one.  
The incorporating ordinance grew out  
of the Inferred necessity of such an in­  
stitution to carry on the war by aiding  
the finances wmcn ,&quot;  
rrer rne neglect or inability of the  
Statei to furnish their assessed quota!.  
Congress was at the time o much  
aware of the deficient ;u;&#x27;uority, that  
they recommended it to the State Le­  
gislatures to pass laws giving due eftoct  
to the ordinance, which was done by  
Pennsylvania abd several other &quot;States.  
Mr. Wilson, justly distinguised for  
hit intellectual powers, being deeply  
impressed with the importance of a  
Hank at such a crisis, published a small  
pamphlet, entitled &quot;Considerations on  
thj Rank of North Armerica,&quot; in  
which he endeavored to derive the pow­  
er from the tutur of the Union, in  
which the colonies were declared and  
became Independent States; and also  
from the tenor of the &quot; articles of Con­  
federation&quot; themselves. But what is  
particularly worthy of notice, is, that  
with all his anxious search in those ar­  
ticles for such a power, he never glanc­  
ed at the terms &quot; common defence and  
general weuare, as a source of it.&#x27;  
He rather those to rest the claim on a  
recital in the text, &quot;that for the more  
convenient management ot the general  
interests of the United States, Delegates  
shall be annually appointed to meet in  
Congress, which he said implied that  
the (jiiuea statea had general rights,  
i general powers and general obligations,  
not derived from any particular State,  
nor trom all the particular states, tak  
en separately, but -rtndlinz from the  
union at the whole; these general  
powers, not being controleu by tha ar­  
ticle declaring: that each State retained  
all powers&#x27; not granted by &quot;tha articles!  
because &quot; the individual States neter  
possessed and could not retain a general  
power over tne outers.&quot;  
, The authority and argument here re  
sorted to, if provide the insrncitr and  
patriotic anxietv of the author, on one  
hand, shew sufficiently on tha other,  
that the terms &quot;common ueience and  
general welfare,&quot; could not, according  
t I. . . . r .1 -i  
in mo anwwn accepiaiion oi uiuu, avail

Tint the terms in qoestion were hot  
snspected in the Conyent&#x27;rbn which  
formed .the Constitution, of any &#x27; such  
meaning as has been constructively ap­  
plied to them, may be pronounced with  
entire confidence! For it exceeds U.e  
possibility of belief, that the known ad­  
vocates in the-Convention for a jealous  
grant and cautious definition of federal  
powers should have&#x27; silently permitted  
tha introduction of.srordlor phrases, in

is more particularly made to the  
number and nature of tho amend­  
ments, proposed to bo mado specific  
and integral parts of tha Constitu­

No less than 8cv;i States, it ap­

Here are a majority of the States,  
proposing amendments, in ono in­  
stance thirty-three by a single State;  
all of them intended ta circumscribe  
the power granted to the General  
Government, by explanations, re  
strictions, or prohibitions, without  
including a single proposition from  
a single State referring to the  
terms, common defence and general  
welfare; which if understood tOcon­  
vey tho asserted power, could riot  
Have failed to be power most strenu­  
ously aimed at, because evidently  
more alarming in its range, than all  
the powers objected to put together.  
And that the terms should have pas­  
sed, altogether unnoticed by tho ma­  
ny eyes which saw danger in terms  
and phrases employed in some of tire  
most mi nu to and limited of the enu­  
merated powers, must be regarded  
as a demoostraion, that it waa tcten  
for granted, that the terms were  
harmless, because explained and  
limited, as in the articles of Con­

In the cour» nfthe proceedings between tbcJJOth and

any addttton of the phrase &quot;to provide fur the com­  
mon defence and general welfare.&quot; With this ad­  
dition, indeed the fitnguago of tho clause being in by  
conformity with that of the clause tn the articles of

with which they luppcncd to stand in a familiar  
&#x27;ho imperative relation. Thus introduced, bow»­  
ver.thcy passed undisturbed thro&#x27; the subsequent  
stages ot the Constitution.  
Ifnbc asked why the term* &quot;common defence  
mid general wolfiiru, it not meant to convey the  
comprehensive |&gt;owrr which, taken literally, they  
express, were not qualified and explained hy sonic  
mmrencc to tho particular power subjoined, the  
«nsAer.snl hand, that althn&#x27; it might easily have  
been done, nnd experieneo shews it might ho well  
*• 11 had been done, yet the omission is accounted  
by an inattention to the phrtweology, occasioned,  
doubtless, hy its identity with tlie harmless charnr­  
ter attached to it in tl.o instrument from which it  
wn* borrowed.  
R&#x27; 1 « m,| y «&#x27; not he asked with infinitely more  
propriety, and without tho possibility of a satisfuc­  
«»fy answer, why, if the terms were meant to em­  
•&gt;&#x27;&lt;&quot;*&gt; •&quot;&#x27;&gt; only all the powers particularly express­  
C( J» &#x27;! |e indefinite power which bus been claimed  
under them, the intention was not so declared ; why  
on that supposition so much critical labor was tm­  
ployed in enumerating the particular powers and  
&gt;n defining and limiting their extent?  
Tho variations and vicissitudes in tho modifie»­  
lion of the diese in which the terms &quot;common de­  
lenco and general welfare appear, are remarkable;  
and to be no otherwise explained than by differen­  
cos of opinion concerning the necessity or the form  
ofa constitutional provision for the debts of tho  
Revolution; some ot the members apprehending  
improper claims for losses by depreciated bills of  
credit; others an evasion of proper claims if not  
positively brought within the authorised functions  
of the new government; and others again consul­  
cring tlie past debts of the United Stuteaas ptiflici­  
ontly secured by the principle that no change in the  
-overninent could change the obligations of the  
nation. Besides the indications in the Journal, the  
history of (lie period sanctions this explanation,  
But, it is to he emphatically remarked, that in  
the multitude of motions, pro|N&gt;*iti&lt;ins and amend­  
ments, there is not s single one having reference  
to the terms &quot;common defence and general wel- i*  
lare,&quot;&#x27; unless we were so to understand th* propu­  
sition containing them, made on August 25lli,  
which was disagreed to by all the H rales except one.  
The obvious conclusion to which we are brought  
is, that these terms copied Irom the articles of  
Confederation, were regarded in the new, as in the  
old instrument, merely u* general term*, explained  
and limited by too subjoined specification*, and  
therefore requiring no ciiucal attention or studied  
precaution.  
If the practice of the I&#x27;cvuluuonury Congress b&lt;

self, than that it is impossible that auch a constitti­  
lion ns the latter, would have been recommended  
10 the States hy all the mambera of that body who»  
names were subscribed to th« inatramcnlT  
Passing from this vmw of the «en» in which tho  
terms, common defence nnd genoral&#x27;welfsre, were  
used by the Framers of tho Cooslitution, let us look  
for that in which they must havo been understood  
by tho Conventions, or rather by the people who  
through their convention!*, accepted and ratifie J it.  
And litre the evidence is, if possible, still more  
irresistible, that the terms could not have been  
garded as giving a scope to Federal legislation in­  
gmtely more objectionable, than any of tho sp&#x27;eci­  
find powers which produced such strenuous oppo  
sitmn, and calls for amendments which might bo  
safeguards agninst tbe dingers apprehended from  
them.  
Without recurring to the published debates of  
those conventions, which, as far as they can he 10 -  
lied on for accuracy, would, it is believed, not im­  
pair the evidence furnished by their recorded pro­  
coedings, it willsuffice loconsult the lists of amend­  
ments proposed hy such of the conventions as con­  
sidcred the powers granted tn the (iovcrnmenl, too  
extensive, or not easily defined.  
Resides the restrictive and explanatory amend

served,that along list was premised under the name

constructive enlargement of them. Hut the appeal

““ A special provision, says Mr. Madison, conld  
not have been necessary, for the debfs of the new  
Congress; for a power to provide money, and a  
power to perform certain acts ol which monevy is the  
ordinary and appropriate means, must of course, car­  
ry with them a power to pay the expenses of perfor­  
ming the acts. Nor was any special provisions for  
debts proposed, till the case of the revolutionary  
debis _was brought into vir:w; and it is a fair Pl‘e-!  
wination from the course of the varied propositions.  
and their associations with the terms, ‘common (ieli-1  
ance and general weltare,” the clause wosld have re­  
mained as reported in the first dranght of a consti- |  
tution, expressing generally ¢a power in Congress to ‘  
lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,’ 1  
without any addition of the phrase € to provide for ‘  
the common defence and general welfare.” With  
this addition, indeed, the language of the clause be­  
ing in conformity with that of the clause in the ar­  
ticles of confederation. it would be qualified, as in  
those articles, as the specification of powers sabjoin­  
ed to it. But there is suiiicieni reason to suppose,  
that the terms in question would not have been in- ]  
troduced, but for the introduction of the old debts,  
with which they happened to stand in a familiar,  
though inoperative relation. Thus introduced, how­  
ever, they pass undisturbed through the subsequent  
stages of the cousutution.  
“If it be asked, why the terms * common defence  
and general welfare,” is not meant to convey the  
comprehensive power, which, taken literally, they  
express, were not qualified and explained by some  
refeence to the particular power subjoined, the an­  
swer is at hand, that although it might easily have  
been done, and experienee shows it might be well if  
it had been done, yet the omission is accounted for  
by an inatiention to the phraseology, occasioned,  
doubtless, by the identity with the harmless charac- |  
ter attached to it in the instrumenss, from which it  
was borrowed.  
“But may it not be asked with infinitely more  
propriety, and without the possibility of a satisfac­  
tory answer, why, if the terms were meant to em­  
brace, not only all the powers particularly express­

Madison and Mr. Charles Pinkney proposed sundry additional  
items of legislative power, in the same form as those already  
adopted, and among them this, ‘‘ To secure the payment of the

engagements which have been entered into by Congress, and  
to discharge, as well the debts of the United States, as the  
debts incurred by the several States during the late war, for

payment of the debts and necessary expenses of the United  
States ; provided that no law for raising any branch of revenue  
except what may be appropriated for the payment of interest  
on debts or loans, shall continue in force for more than ——
