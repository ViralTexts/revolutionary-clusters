. Smith (South Carolina) contended that impeachment was the only constitutional means of removal.  
  
  
Mr. Madison Did not concur with the gentleman in his interpretation of the constitution. What said he would be the consequence of such construction? It would in effect establish every officer of the government on the firm tenure of good behaviour, not the heads of departments only, but all the inferior officers of those departments would hold their offices during good behaviour, and that to be judged of by one branch of the legislature only on the impeachment of the other. If the constitution means this by its declarations to be the case we must submit, but I should lament it as a fatal error interwove in the system and one that would ultimately prove its destruction. I think the inference would not arise from a fair construction of the words of that instrument.

for the good behaviour of the public officers. It is possible the case I have stated may happen; indeed it may perhaps on some occasion be found necessary to impeach the president himself; surely therefore it may happen to a subordinate officer, whose bad actions may be connived at or overlooked by the president; hence the people have an additional security in this constitutional provision.  
I think it absolutely necessary that the president should have the power of removing from office; it will make him, in a peculiar manner, responsible for their conduct, and subject him to impeachment himself, if he suffers them to perpetrate with impunity high crimes or misdemeanours against the United States, or neglects to superintend their conduct, so as to check their excesses. On the constitutionality of the declaration I have no manner of doubt.

Bland thought the Senate should have the same role in removing as it did in appointing. Jackson favored impeachment, giving the president only a suspending power.  
  
  
Mr. Madison Did not conceive it was a proper construction of the constitution to say, that there was no other mode of removing from office than that by impeachment; he believed this, as applied to the judges, might be the case, but he could never imagine it extended in the manner which gentlemen contended for. He believed they would not assert, that any part of the constitution declared, that the only way to remove should be by impeachment. The contrary might be inferred, because congress may establish offices by law; therefore, most certainly, it is in the discretion of the legislature to say upon what terms the office shall be held, either during good behaviour, or during pleasure. Under this construction the principles of the constitution would be reconcileable in every part; but under that of the gen

e if his construction of the constitution is right, the president can have no more power to suspend than he has to remove.  
What fell from one of my colleagues (Mr. Bland) appears to have more weight, than any thing hitherto suggested. The constitution at the first view, may seem to favor his opinion; but that must be the case only at the first view, for if we examine it, we shall find his construction incompatible with the spirit and principles, contained in that instrument.  
It is said, that it comports with the nature of things, that those who appoint, should have the power of removal, but I cannot conceive that this sentiment is warranted by the constitution; I believe it would be found very inconvenient in practice. It is one of the most prominent features of the constitution, a principle that pervades the whole system, that there should be the highest possible degree of responsibility in all the executive officers thereof; any thing therefore which tends to lessen this responsibility is contrary to its spirit and intention, and unless it is saddled upon us expressly by the letter of that work, I shall oppose the admission of it into any act of the legislature. Now, if the heads of the executive departments are subjected to removal by the president alone, we have in him security for the good behaviour of the officer: If he does not conform to the judgment of the president, in doing the executive duties of his office, he can be displaced; this makes him responsible to the great executive power, and makes the president responsible to the public for the conduct of the person he has nominated and appointed to aid him in the administration of his department; but if the president shall join in a collusion with this officer, and continue a bad man in office, the case of impeachment will reach the culprit, and drag him forth to punishment. But if you take the other construction, and say, he shall not be displaced, but by and with the advice and consent of the senate, the president is no longer answerable for the conduct of the officer; all will depend upon the senate. You here destroy a real responsibility without obtaining even the shadow; for no gentleman will pretend to say, the responsibility of the senate can be of such a nature as to afford substantial security. But why, it may be asked, was the senate joined with the president in appointing to office, if they have no responsibility? I answer, merely for the sake of advising, being supposed, from their nature, better acquainted with the characters of the candidates than an individual; yet even here the president is held to the responsibility he nominates, and with their consent appoints; no person can be forced upon him as an assistant by any other branch of the government.  
  
There is another objection to this construction

Perhaps there was no argument urged with more success, or more plausibly grounded, against the constitution, under which we are now deliberating, than that founded on the mingling of the executive and legislative branches of the government in one body. It has been objected, that the senate have too much of the executive power even, by having a controul over the president in the appointment to office. Now, shall we extend this connection between the legislative and executive departments, which will strengthen the objection, and diminish the responsibility we have in the head of the executive?

ti having lieen contended, in the debate iu 1799 on the |  
power ol removal, that no officer could, under the Con­  
slitution, be removed but by iinpeachinent, Mr. Madison  
aaid (I quote fioin Lloyd’s Debater)_  
“ Such a construction ol the Constitution would in ef­  
fect, eatalish every officer on the firm tenure of good be­  
haviour—not the heads of departments only, but all the  
interior officers of those departments, would hold their  
olfices during good behaviour.”  
Alter staling that the power of impeachment was given  
to reaeh cases in which an officer might deserve im­  
peachment, whom the President would not remove, and  
(hat it might be necessary to impeach the President, lie  
proceeds—

duct, and subject him to impeachment himself if he suf­  
fers them to perpetrate with impunity high crimes and

 of opinion, that the same power that  
j appointed had, or ought to have, the power of re  
moval.  
Mr. Jackson agreed with Mr. JPand in the  
j general principle, that ihc body who appointed  
ought to have the power of removal, as the body  
which enacts laws can repeal them; and if the  
power is deposited in any particular department  
by the (onstitution, it is out of the power of the  
11 * &gt;U&quot;C In alter it. Rut the words in the. Consti­  
tution declare, that all civil officers shall be re­  
  
net ion of, high crime* and misdemeanor*; and &#x27;  
however longj it may take to decide, in this way i  
t must be done.  
Mr. Madison did not conceive it wa* a proper i &lt;  
:ondruction of the Constitution to say that there  
was no other mode of removing from office than 1  
that by impeachment. This, a* applied to the judg­  
es, might be the case; but he could never ima­  
gine it extended in the manner oontetwled for. ,l  
i&#x27;he contrary might be inferred* because Con- &lt;  
iress may establish ofhee* by law; therefore, i  
most certainly, it is m the discretion of the Leg- i  
islature to say upon what terms the office shall be  
held, cither during good behavior or during plea­  
sure.  
Mr. Boudinot said, if ho thought this motion  
would lead the eo nmittec beyond the power* as­

Mr. Madison did not concur with the gentle­  
man ia this iaterpretation of the Constitution.  
What «aid he, would be the consequences of  
such construction ! It would in effect estab­

tution, said such a construction . of  
the constitution &quot;would in effect es­  
tablish every officer of the Gov­  
ernment on a firm tenure of good  
behavior. Not head of departments  
  
only, but all the interior officers  
  
during good behavior, and hat to  
be judged of by one branch of i he  
Legislature only on the impeach-1  
m en t of the other. If the consti­  
tution meansVttiis bv its deelara­  
tions to be the case, we must submit  
but I should lament it as a fatal er­  
ror interwoven in the system, and  
one that would ultimately prove its  
destruction. I think the inference  
would not arise from a fair construc­  
tion of the words of that instru­  
ment. I think it absolutely neces­  
sary that the president should have  
the power of removing from office;  
it will make him, in a peculiar man­  
ner, responsible for their conduct  
and subject him to impeachment  
himself if he suffers them to per­  
petrate with impunity high crimes  
or misdemeanors against the United  
States, or neglects to superintend  
their conduct so as to check their  
excesses. Of the constitutionality  
of the power of removal I have no  
maimer of doubt.
