Sir,  
Treasury Department August 5th, 1794.  
  
The disagreeable crisis at which matters have lately arrived in some of the Western Counties of Pennsylvania, with regard to the laws laying duties on spirits distilled within the United States and on Stills, seems to render proper a review of the circumstances which have attended those Laws in that scene, from their commencement to the present time—and of the conduct which has hitherto been observed on the part of the Government, its motives and effect; in order to a better Judgement of the measures necessary to be pursued in the existing emergency.  
The opposition to those Laws in the four most Western Counties of Pennsylvania (Alleghany, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland) commenced as early as they were known to have been passed. It has continued, with different degrees of Violence, in the different Counties, and at different periods. But Washington has uniformly distinguished its resistance, by a more excessive spirit, than has appeared in the other Counties, and Seems to have been cheifly instrumental in kindling, and keeping alive the flame.  
The opposition first manifested itself in the milder Shape of the circulation of opinions unfavourable to the Law—and calculated by the influence of public disesteem to discourage the accepting or holding of Offices under it, or the complying with it by those who might be so disposed; to which was added the show of a discontinuance of the business of distilling.  
These expedients were shortly after succeeded by private associations to forbear compliances with the Law. But it was not long before these more negative modes of opposition were perceived to be likely to prove ineffectual. And in proportion as this was the case, and as the means of introducing the Laws into operation were put into execution, the disposition to resistance

became more turbulent and more inclined to adopt and practice violent expedients. The Officers now began to experience marks of contempt and insult. Threats against them became frequent and loud; and after Some time, these threats were ripened into Acts of ill treatment and outrage.  
These acts of violence were preceded by certain Meetings of Malcontent persons, who entered into resolutions calculated at once to confirm, inflame and Systematize the Spirit of opposition.  
The first of these meetings was holden at a place called Red Stone Old Fort on the 27th of July 1791, where it was concerted, that County Committees should be convened in the four Counties at the respective seats of Justice therein.  On the 23d of August following, one of these Committees assembled in the County of Washington consisting (as appears by their proceedings published in the Pittsburgh Gazette) among others of James Marshall Register &amp; Recorder of the County, David Bradford Deputy Attorny General for the State, Henry Taylor &amp; James Edgar now associate Judges Thomas Crooks and William Parker, then or shortly before Magistrates &amp; Militia Officers, Thomas Sedgwick and Alexander Wright Magistrates, and Peter Kidd an officer of the Militia.  
This meeting passed some intemperate resolutions, which were afterwards printed in the Pittsburgh Gazette, containing a Strong censure on the Law, declaring that any person who had accepted or might accept an Office under Congress in order to carry it into effect, should be considered as inimical to the interests of the Country; and recommending to the Citizens of Washington County to treat every person who had accepted or might thereafter accept any such office with contempt, and absolutely to refuse all kind of communication or intercourse with the Officers, and to withhold from them all aid, support or Comfort.  
Not content with this vindictive proscription of those, who might esteem it their duty, in the capacity of Officers, to aid in the execution of the constitutional Laws of the Land—The meeting proceeded to pass another resolution on a matter essentially foreign to the object which had brought them together, namely the salaries and comp&lt;en&gt;sat&lt;ions&gt; allowed by Congress to the Officers of Government generally, which they represent as enormous, manifesting by their zeal to accumulate topics of  
  
censure, that they were actuated, not merely by the dislike of a particular Law, but by a disposition to render the Government itself unpopular and odious.  
This Meeting, in further prosecution of their plan, deputed Three of their Members to meet Delegates from the Counties of Westmoreland Fayette and Alleghany on the first Tuesday of September following for the purpose of expressing the sense of the people of those Counties, in an address to the Legislature of the United States, upon the subject of the Excise Law and other grievancies—naming for that purpose James Marshall David Bradford, &amp; David Philips.  
Another Meeting accordingly took place on the 7th of September 1791 at Pittsburgh, in the County of Alleghany, at which there appeared persons in character of Delegates from the four Western Counties; from Westmoreland, Nehemiah Stokely &amp; John Young, from Fayette, Edward Cook Nathaniel Breaden &amp; John Oliphant, from Alleghany Thomas Moreton John Woods &amp; William Plume, from Washington the three persons above named.  
This Meeting entered into resolutions more comprehensive in their objects &amp; not less inflammatory in their tendency, than those which had before passed the Meeting in Washington. Their resolutions contained severe censures not only on the Law which was the immeadiate subject of objection; but upon what they termed the exorbitant salaries of Officers; the unreasonable interest of the publick Debt, the want of discrimination between original holders &amp; transferrees &amp; the institution of a National Bank, The same unfriendly temper towards the Government of the United States which had led out of their way the meeting at Washington produced a similar wandering in that at Pittsburgh.  
A representation to Congress and a remonstrance to the Legislature of Pensylvania against the Law more particularly complained of were prepared by this meeting—published together with their other proceedings in the Pittsburgh Gazette &amp; afterwards presented to the respective bodies to whom they were addressed.  
These Meetings composed of very influencial Individuals and conducted without moderation or prudence are justly chargeable with the excesses, which have been from time to time  
  
committed; serving to give consistency to an opposition which has at length matured to a point, that threatens the foundations of the Government and of the Union, unless speedily &amp; effectually subdued.  
On the 6th of the same Month of September, the Opposition broke out in an Act of violence upon the person and property of Robert Johnson Collector of the Revenue for the Counties of Alleghany and Washington.  
A party of men armed and disguised way-laid him at a place on Pidgeon Creek in Washington County, seized, tarred and feathered him, cut off his hair, and deprived him of his horse, obliging him to travel on foot a considerable distance in that mortifying and painfull situation.  
The case was brought before the district Court of Pensylvania, out of which processes issued against John Robertson, John Hamilton &amp; Thomas McComb—three of the persons concerned in the outrage.  
The serving of These Processes was confided by the then Marshall Clement Biddle to his deputy Joseph Fox, who in the month of October went into Alleghany County for the purpose of serving them.  
The appearances and circumstances which Mr Fox observed himself in the course of his journey, and learnt afterwards upon his arrival at Pittsburgh, had the effect of deterring him from the service of the processes—and unfortunately led to adopt the injudicious and fruitless expedient of sending them to the parties by a private Messenger under cover.  
The deputys Report to the Marshall States a number of particulars evincing a considerable fermentation in the part of the Country to which he was sent, and inducing a belief on his part, that he could not with safety have executed the processes—The Marshall transmitting this report to the District Attorney makes the following observations upon it &quot;I am sorry to add that he (the deputy) found the people in general in the Western part of the state and particularly beyond the Alleghany Mountain in such a ferment on Account of the Act of Congress for laying a duty on distilled Spirits &amp; so much opposed to the execution of the said Act, and from a variety of threats to himself personally although he took the utmost precaution to conceal his errand, that he was not only convinced of the impossibility of serving the  
  
process, but that any attempt to effect it would have occasioned the most violent opposition from the greater part of the Inhabitants, and he declares that if he had attempted it he believes he should not have returned alive. I spared no expence nor pains to have the process of the Court executed and have not the least doubt that my Deputy would have accomplished it, if it could have been done.&quot;  
The reality of the danger to the Deputy was countenanced by the Opinion of General Neville, the Inspector of the Revenue, a man who before had given and since has given numerous proofs of a steady and firm temper. And what followed, as announced in a letter of that Officer of the 27th of October 1791, is a further Confirmation of it. The person who had been sent with the processes was seized whipped tarred and feathered and after having his Money and horse taken from him was blindfolded and tied in the Woods, in which condition he remained for five hours.  
Very serious reflections naturally occurred upon this occasion. It seemed highly probable, from the issue of the experiment, which had been made that the ordinary course of civil process would be ineffectual for enforcing the execution of the law in the Scene in question—and that a perseverance in this course might lead to a serious concussion. The law itself was still in the infancy of its operation and far from established in other important portions of the Union.  Prejudices against it had been industriously dissemminated—Misrepresentations diffused, misconceptions fostered. The Legislature of the United States had not yet organised the means, by which the Executive could come in aid of the Judiciary, when found incompetent to the execution of the laws. If neither of these impediments to a decisive exertion had existed, it was desireable, especially in a republican Government, to avoid what is in such cases the Ultimate resort, ’till all the Milder means had been tried without success.  
Under the United influence of these considerations, it appeared adviseable to forbear urging coercive measures, till the laws had gone into more extensive operation, till further time for reflection and experience of its operation had served to correct false impressions and inspire greater modera&lt;tion&gt; and till the Legislature had had an Opportunity by a revision of the law to remove as far as possible objections and to reinforce the provisions for securing its execution.  
  
Other incidents occurred from time to time, which are further proofs of the very improper temper, that prevailed among the inhabitants of the refractory countries.  
Mr Johnson was not the only Officer who about the same period experienced outrage. Mr Wells Collector of the Revenue for Westmoreland &amp; Fayette was also ill treated at Greensburgh and Union Town Nor were the outrages perpetrated confined to the Officers. They extended to private Citizens, who only dared to shew their respect for the laws of their Country.  
Some time in October 1791, an Unhappy man of the Name of Wilson, a Stranger in the County, and Manifestly disordered in his intellects, imagining himself to be a Collector of the Revenue or invested with some trust in relation to it, was so Unlucky as to make enquiries concerning the Distillers who had entered their Stills; giving out that he was to travel through the United States to ascertain and report to Congress the number of Stills &amp;c. This man was pursued by a party in disguise, taken out of his bed, carried about five Miles back to a Smith’s Shop, Stripped of his Cloaths, which were afterwards burnt, and after having been himself inhumanly burnt in several places with a heated Iron was tarred and feathered—and about daylight dismissed—naked wounded and otherwise in a very suffering condition—These particulars are communicated in a letter from the Inspector of the Revenue of the 17th of November, who declares that he had then himself seen the unfortunate maniac, the abuse of whom, as he expresses it, exceeded description and was sufficient to make human nature shudder.  The affair is the more extraordinary, as persons of Weight and consideration in that Country are understood to have been actors in it, and as the symptoms of Insanity were during the whole time of inflicting the punishment apparent—the unhappy sufferer displaying the heroic fortitude of a man, who conceived himself to be a martyr to the discharge of some duty.  
Not long after a person of the name of Roseberry underwent the humilating punishment of tarring and feathering with some aggravations; for having in conversation hazarded the very natural and just, but unpalatable remark, that the Inhabitants of that Country could not reasonably expect protection from a Government, whose laws they so strenuously opposed.  
The audacity of the perpetrators of these excesses was so  
  
great, that an armed banditti ventured to seize and carry off two persons, who were witnesses against the rioters in the case of Wilson, in order to prevent their giving testimony of the riot to a Court then sitting or about to sit.  
Designs of personal violence against the Inspector of the Revenue himself, to force him to a resignation, were repeatedly attempted to be put in execution by armed parties, but by different circumstances were frustrated.  
In the session of Congress, which commenced in October 1791, the Law laying a duty on distilled spirits and stills came under the revision of Congress as had been anticipated. By an Act passed May 8th 1792, during that session, material alterations were made in it—Among these the duty was reduced to a rate so moderate, as to have silenced complaint on that head—and a new and very favourable alternative was given to the distiller, that of paying a Monthly, instead [of] a yearly rate, according to the capacity of his Still, with liberty to take a license for the precise term, which he should intend to work it, &amp; to renew that license for a further term or terms.  
This amending act, in its progress through the Legislature, engaged the particular attention of Members who themselves were interested in distilleries, and of others who represented parts of the Country in which the business of distilling was extensively carried on.  
Objections were well considered and great pains taken to obviate all such as had the semblance of reasonableness.  
The effect has in a great measure corresponded with the views of the Legislature—Opposition has subsided in several districts where it before prevailed—and it was natural to entertain and not easy to abandon a hope that the same thing would by degrees have taken place in the four Western Counties of this State.  
But notwithstanding some flattering appearances at particular junctures, and infinite pains by various expedients to produce the desirable issue, the hope entertained has never been realized, and is now at an end as far as the ordinary means of executing Laws are concerned.  
The first Law had left the number and positions of the Officers of Inspection, which were to be established in each district for receiving entries of Stills, to the discretion of the Supervisor.  
  
The second to secure a due accomodation to distillers, provides peremtorily, that there shall be one in each County.  
The idea was immeadiately embraced, that it was a very important point in the scheme of opposition to the Law to prevent the establishment of Offices in the respective Counties.  
For this purpose, the intimidation of well disposed inhabitants was added to the plan of molesting and obstructing the Officers by force or otherwise, as might be necessary—So effectually was the first point carried (the certain destruction of property and the peril of life being involved) that it became almost impracticable to obtain suitable places for Offices in some of the Counties—and when obtained it was found a matter of necessity in almost every instance to abandon them.  
After much effort, The Inspector of the Revenue succeeded in procuring the house of William Faulkner, a Captain in the Army, for an Office of Inspection in the County of Washington—This took place in August 1792—The Office was attended by the Inspector of the Revenue in person, till prevented by the following incidents.  
Capt. Faulkner, being in pursuit of some deserters from the troops, was encountered by a number of people in the same neighbourhood where Mr Johnson had been ill treated the preceeding year, who reproached him with letting his house for an Office of Inspection—drew a knife upon him, threatened to scalp him, tar and feather him, and reduce his house and property to ashes, if he did not solemnly promise to prevent the further use of his House for an Office.  
Capt. Faulkner was induced to make the promise exacted—and in consequence of the circumstance wrote a letter to the Inspector dated the 20th of August, countermanding the permission for using his house—and the day following gave a public notice in the pittsburgh Gazette, that the Office of Inspection should be no longer kept there.  
At the same time, another engine of opposition was in operation—Agreeable to a previous notification, there met at Pittsburgh on the 21st of August a number of persons stiling themselves &quot;A meeting of sundry Inhabitants of the Western Counties of Pennsylvania&quot; who appointed John Canon Chairman and Albert Gallatin Clerk.  
This Meeting entered into resolutions not less exceptionable  
  
than those of its predecessors—The preamble suggests that a tax on spiritous Liquors is unjust in itself and oppressive upon the poor, that internal taxes upon consumption must in the end destroy the liberties of every Country in which they are introduced—that the Law in question, from certain local circumstances which are Specified, would bring immediate distress and ruin upon the Western Country, and concludes with the sentiment, that they think it their duty to persist in remonstrances to Congress, and in every other legal measure, that may obstruct the operation of the Law.  
The resolutions then proceed, first, to appoint a Committee to prepare and cause to be presented to Congress an address stating objections to the Law, and praying for its repeal—Secondly to appoint Committees of correspondence for Washington, Fayette and Alleghany, charged to correspond together and with such Committee as should be appointed for the same purpose in the County of Westmoreland, or with any Committees of a similar nature, that might be appointed in other parts of the United States; and also if found necessary to call together either general Meetings of the people, in their respective Counties, or conferences of the several Committees; And lastly to declare, that they will in future consider those who hold Offices for the Collection of the duty as unworthy of their friendship, that they will have no intercourse nor dealings with them, will withdraw from them every assistance, withhold all the comforts of life which depend upon those duties, that as men and fellow Citizens we owe to each other, and will upon all Occasions treat them with contempt; earnestly recommending it to the people at large to follow the same line of Conduct towards them.  
The idea of pursuing legal measures to obstruct the operation of a Law needs little comment legal measures may be pursued to procure the repeal of a Law, but to obstruct its operation presents a contradiction in terms. The operation or what is the same thing, the execution of a Law cannot be obstructed, after it has been constitutionally enacted, without illegality and crime. The expression quoted is one of those phrases which can only be used to conceal a disorderly &amp; culpable intention under forms that may escape the hold of the Law.  
Neither was it difficult to perceive, that the Anathema pronounced against the Officers of the Revenue placed them in a  
  
State of Virtual OutLawry, and operated as a signal to all those who were bold enough to encounter the guilt and the danger to violate both their lives and their properties.  
The foregoing proceedings as soon as known were reported by the Secretary of the Treasury to the President.  The President on the  issued a proclamation—[  ]  and likewise directed that prosecutions might be instituted against the Offenders, in the cases in which the Laws would support and the requisite evidence could be obtained.  
Pursuant to these instructions, the Attorney General in cooperation with the Attorney of the District attended a Circuit Court which was holden at York Town in October 1792—for the purpose of bringing forward prosecutions in the proper Cases.  
Collateral measures were taken to procure for this purpose the necessary evidence.  
The Surpervisor of the Revenue was sent into the opposing Survey—to ascertain the real state of that Survey—to obtain evidence of the persons who were concerned in the Riot, in Faulkeners case, and of those whose composed the meeting at Pittsburgh—to uphold the confidence and encourage the perseverance of the Officers acting under the Law—and to induce, if possible the Inhabitants of that part of the survey, which appeared least disinclined, to come voluntarily into the law, by Arguments addressed to their sense of duty and exhibiting the eventual dangers and mischiefs of resistance.  
The mission of the Supervisor had no other fruit than that of obtaining evidence of the persons who composed the Meeting at Pittsburgh and of two who were understood to be concerned in the riot—and a confirmation of the enmity, which certain active and designing leaders had industriously infused into a large proportion of the inhabitants, not against the particular laws, in question only, but, of a more antient date, against the Government of the United States itself.  
The then Attorney General being of Oppinion, that it was at best a doubtful point, whether the proceedings of the Meeting at Pittsburgh contained indictable matter, no prosecution was attempted against those who composed it; though if the ground for proceeding against them had appeared to be firm it is presumed, that the truest policy would have dictated that course.  
Indictments were preferred to the Circuit Court and found  
  
against the two persons understood to have been concerned in the Riot, and the usual Measures were taken for carrying them into effect.  
But it appearing afterward&lt;s,&gt; from various representations supported by satisfactory testimo&lt;n&gt;y that there had been some mistake as to the persons accused—Justice and policy demanded that the prosecutions should be discontinued, which was accordingly done.  
This issue of the business unavoidably defeated the attempt to establish examples of the punishment of persons who engaged in a Violent resistance to the laws—and left the Officers to Struggle against the Stream of resistance, without the advantage of such examples.  
The following plan, afterwards successively put in execution, was about this time digested, for carrying if possible the laws into effect without the necessity of recurring to force.  
To prosecute delinquents in the cases in which it could be clearly done for non compliance with the laws 2 to intercept the Markets for the surplus produce of the distilleries of the non complying counties by seizing the Spirits in their way to those Markets in places where it could be effected without Opposition 3 by purchases, through Agents, for the use of the Army (instead of deriving the Supply through contractors as formerly) confining them to spirits, in respect to which there had been a compliance with the laws.  
The motives to this plan speak for t

aimed, besides the influence of penalties on delinquents, at making it the general interest of the distillers to comply with the laws by interrupting the Market for a very considerable surplus, and by, at the same time, confining the benefit of the large demand for public service to those who did their duty to the public, and furnishing through the means of payments in Cash that medium for paying the duties, the want of which was alleged to be a great difficulity in the Way of Compliance.  
But two circumstances conspired to counteract the success of the plan—one the necessity, towards incurring the penalty of non Compliance, of there being an Office of Inspection in each County, which was prevented in some of the countries by the means of intimidation practised for that purpose—another, the non extension of the law to the territory Nwest of the Ohio,  
  
into which a large proportion of the surplus before mentioned was sent.  
A Cure for these defects could only come from the legislature—Accordingly, in the Session which began in November 1792 measures were taken for procuring a further revision of the laws. A bill containing Amendments of these and other defects was brought in; but it so happened that this object, by reason of more urgent business, was deferred till towards the Close of the Session, and finally went off, through the usual hurry of that period.  
The continuance of the embarrassment incident to this state of things naturally tended to diminish much the efficacy of the plan which had been devised—Yet it was resolved as far as legal provisions would bear out the Officers to pursue it with perseverance—There was ground to entertain hopes of its good effect; and it was certainly the most likely course which could have been adopted towards attaining the object of the laws, by means short of force; evincing unequivocally the sincere disposition to avoid this painfull resort and the steady moderation, which have characterised the measures of the Government.  
In pursuance of this plan, prosecutions were occasionally instituted in the mildest forms, seizures were made as opportunities occurred—and purchases on public account were carried on.  
It may be incidently remarked, that these purchases were extended to other places; where, though the same disorders did not exist, it appeared, adviseable to facilitate the payment of the duties by this species of accomodation.  
Nor was this plan, notwithstanding the deficiency of legal provision, which impeded its full execution, without corresponding effects.  
Symptoms from time to time appeared which authorised expectation, that with the aid, at another Session, of the desired supplementary provisions, it was capable of accomplishing its end, if no extraordinary events occurred.  
The opponents of the laws, not insensible of the tendency of that plan, nor of the defects in the laws which interfered with it, did not fail from time to time to pursue analogous modes of counteraction—The effort to frustrate the establishment of Offices of Inspection, in particular, was persisted in and even  
  
increased, Means of intimidating officers and others continued to be exerted.  
In April 1793, a party of armed men in disguise made an attack in the night upon the House of a Collector of Revenue, who resided in Fayette County; but he happening to be from home they contented themselves with breaking open his house, threatning terrifying and abusing his family.  
Warrants were issued for apprehending some of the rioters upon this occasion by Isaac Mason and James Findlay assistant Judges of Fayette County, which were delivered to the Sheriff of that County, who it seems refused to execute them; for which he has been since indicted.  
This is at once an example of a disposition to support the laws of the Union, and of an opposite one, in the local officers of Pensylvania, within the non complying scene—But it is a truth too important not to be noticed and too injurious not to be lamented, that the prevailing spirit of those Officers has been either hostile or lukewarm to the execution of those Laws—and that the weight of an unfriendly official influence has been one of the most serious obstacles, with which they have had to struggle.  
In June following the Inspector of the Revenue was burnt in Effegy in Allyghany County at a place and on a day of some public Election, with much display, in the presence of and without interuption from Magistrates and other public Officers.  
on the night of the 22d of November, another party of men, some of them armed and all in disguise; went to the house of the same Collector of Fayette, which had been visited in April, broke and entered it, and demanded a surrender of the officer’s commission and official books. Upon his refusing to deliver them up, they presented pistols at him, and swore that if he did not comply they would instantly put him to death. At length, a surrender of the Commission and books were enforced—But not content with this, the rioters before they departed required of the Officer, that he should within two weeks publish his resignation on pain of another visit &amp; the destruction of his house.  
Notwithstanding these excesses, the Laws appeared during the latter periods of this Year, to be rather gaining ground. Several principal distillers, who had formerly held out, complied,  
  
and others discovered a disposition to comply, which was only restrained by the fear of violence.  
But these favourable circumstances served to beget alarm, among those who were determined at all events to prevent the quiet establishment of the Laws. It soon appeared, that they meditated by fresh and greater excesses to aim a still more effectual blow at them—to subdue the growing spirit of compliance, and to destroy intirely the organs of the Laws, within that part of the Country, by compelling all the Officers to renounce their Offices.  
The last proceeding in the case of the Collector of Fayette was in this spirit.  
In January of the present year further violences appear to have been perpetrated. William Richmond who had given information against some of the rioters in the affair of Wilson had his barn burnt with all the Grain and Hay which it contained—and the same thing happened to Robert Shawhan a distiller, who had been among the first to comply with the law and who had always spoken favourably of it. But in neither of these instances (which happened in the County of Alleghany) though the presumptions were violent was any positive proof obtained.  
The Inspector of the revenue in a letter of the 27th of February writes that he had received information that persons living near the dividing line of Alleghany and Washington had thrown out threats of tarring and feathering one William Cochran, a complying Distiller, &amp; of burning his distillery—and that it had also been given out, that in three weeks, there would not be a House Standing in Alleghany County of any person who had complyed with the Laws; in consequence of which he had been induced to pay a visit to several leading individuals in that quarter, as well to ascertain the truth of the information as to endeavour to avert the attempt to execute such threats.  
It appeared afterwards, that on his return home, he had been pursued by a collection of disorderly persons threatening, as they went along, vengeance against him. In their way, these men called at the House of Jame Kiddoe who had recently complied with the Laws, broke into his Still-House, fired several balls under his still and scattered fire over and about the house.  
Letters from the Inspector in March announce an increased activity in promoting opposition to the laws—frequent meetings  
  
to cement and extend the combinations against it—and among other means for this purpose a plan of collecting a force to seize him, compel him to resign his commission and detain him prisoner—probably as a hostage.  
In May and June new violences were committed—James Kiddoe the person above-mentioned and Wm Cochran another complying distiller met with repeated injury to their property. Kiddoe had parts of his Grist mill at different times carried away, and Cochran suffered more material injuries—his still was destroyed, his saw mill was rendered useless by the taking away of the Saw, and his Grist mill so injured as to require to be repaired at considerable expense.  
At the last visit, a Note in Writing was left, requiring him to publish what he had suffered in the Pittsburgh Gazette, on pain of another visit, in which he is threatened, in figureative, but intelligible terms, with the destruction of his property by fire; thus adding to the profligacy of doing wanton injuries to a fellow Citizen the tyranny of compelling him to be the publisher of his wrongs.  
June being the month for receiving annual entries of Stills, endeavours were used to open Offices in Westmoreland &amp; Washington, where it had been hitherto found impracticable. With much pains and difficulty places were procured for the purpose. That in Westmoreland was repeatedly attacked in the night by armed men, who frequently fired upon it, but according to a report which has been made to this department, it was defended with so much courage and perseverance by John Wells an auxiliary Officer &amp; Philip Ragan the owner of the House—as to have been maintained during the remainder of the Month.  
That, in Washington, after repeated attempts was suppressed; the first attempt was confined to pulling down the sign of the Office &amp; threats of future destruction, the second effected the object in the following mode—about twelve persons armed &amp; painted black, in the night of the 6th of June, broke into the House of John Lynn, where the Office was kept, and after having treacherously seduced him to come down Stairs and put himself in their power by a promise of safety to himself and his house—they seized &amp; tied him, threatened to hang him—took him to a retired Spot in the neighbouring wood and there after cutting off his hair, tarring and feathering him, Swore him never again  
  
to allow the use of his House for an Office, never to disclose their names, and never again to have any sort of agency in aid of the excise—having done which, they bound him naked to a tree and left him in that situation, till morning, when he succeeded in extricating himself. Not content with this, the Malcontents some days after made him another Visit, pulled down part of his house—and put him in a situation to be obliged to become an exile from his own home and to find an asylum elswhere.  
During this time, several of the Distillers who had made entries &amp; benefitted by them, refused the payment of the duties; actuated no doubt by various motives.  
Indications of a plan to proceed against the Inspector of the Revenue in the manner which has been before mentioned continued. In a letter from him of the 10th of July, he observed that the threatened visit had not yet been made, tho he had still reason to expect it.  
In the Session of Congress which began in December 1793—a bill for making the amendments in the Laws, which had been for some time desired, was brought in, and on the 5th of June last became a Law.  
It is not to be doubted, that the different Stages of this business were regularly notified to the Malcontents, and that a conviction of the tendency of the amendments contemplated to effectuate the execution of the Law, had matured the resolution to bring matters to a violent Crisis.  
The increasing energy of the opposition rendered it indispensable to meet the evil with proportionable decision—The idea of giving time for the Law to extend itself in Scenes where the disatisfaction with it was the effect not of an improper spirit, but of causes which were of a nature to yield to reason, reflection, &amp; experience (which had constantly weighed in the estimate of the measures proper to be pursued) had had its effect, in an extensive degree. The experiment too had been long enough tried to ascertain, that where resistance continued the root of the evil lay deep; and required measures of greater efficacy than had been pursued. The laws had undergone repeated revisions of the Legislative representatives of the Union, and had virtually received their repeated Sanction with none or very feeble attempts to effect their repeal; affording an evidence of the general sense of the Community in their favour. Complaint began to be loud  
  
from complying quarters, against the impropriety &amp; injustice of suffering the Laws to remain unexecuted in others.  
Under the united influence of these considerations, there was no choice but to try the efficiency of the Laws in prosecuting with vigour delinquents and Offenders.  
Processes issued against a number of non complying distillers in the Counties of Fayette &amp; Alleghany; and indictments having been found at a Circuit Court holden at Philadelphia in July last against Robert Smilie &amp; John McCulloch, two of the Rioters in the attack, which in November preceding had been made upon the House of a Collector of the Revenue in Fayette County, processes issued against them, also, to bring them to trial and if guilty to punishment.  
The Marshall of the District went in person to serve these processes. He executed his trust without interruption, though under many discouraging circumstances, in Fayette County; but while he was in the execution of it in Alleghany County, being then accompanied by the Inspector of the Revenue (to wit) on the 15th of July last, he was beset on the Road by a party of from Thirty to forty armed men, who after much previous irregularity of conduct finally fired upon him, but as it happened without injury either to him or the Inspector.  
This attempt on the Marshall was but the prelude of greater excesses.  
About break of day, the 16th of July, in conformity with a plan which seems to have been for some time entertained, and which probably was only accelerated by the coming of the Marshall into the Survey, an attack by about One hundred persons armed with Guns and other weapons was made upon the House of the Inspector in the Vicinity of Pittsburgh. The Inspector, though alone, vigorously defended himself against the assailants, and obliged them to retreat without accomplishing their purpose.  
Apprehending that the business would not terminate here, he made application by letter to the Judges, Generals of Militia &amp; Sheriff of the County for protection. A reply to his application from John Wilkins Junr and John Gibson Magistrates &amp; Militia Officers informed him, that the Laws could not be executed, so as to afford him the protection to which he was intitled, owing to the too general combination of the people in that part of Pennsylvania to oppose the Revenue Law, adding that they  
  
would take every step in their power to bring the Rioters to Justice, and would be glad to receive information of the Individuals concerned in the Attack upon his house, that prosecutions might be commenced against them, and expressing their sorrow, that should the posse comitatus of the County be ordered out in support of the civil authority, very few could be gotten that were not of the party of the Rioters.  
The day following the Insurgents reassembled with a considerable augmentation of numbers, amounting as has been computed to at least five hundred; and on the 17th of July renewed their attack upon the house of the Inspector; who in the interval had taken the precaution of calling to his aid a small detachment from the Garrison of Fort Pit, which at the time of the attack consisted of Eleven Men who had been joined by Major Abraham Kirkpatrick a friend and Connection of the Inspector.  
There being scarcely a prospect of effectual defence against so large a body, as then appeared, and as the Inspector had every thing to apprehend for his person, if taken, it was Judged adviseable, that he should withdraw from the House to a place of concealment—Major Kirkpatrick generously agreeing to remain with the &lt;Eleven Men, in the intention, if practicable to make a capitulation in favour of the property, if not to defend it as long as possible.  
A parley took place under cover of a flag, which was sent by the Insurgents to the house to demand, that the Inspector should come forth, renounce his Office, and stipulate never again to accept an Office under the same Laws. To this it was replied, that the Inspector had left the House, upon their first approach, and that the place to which he had retired was unknown. They then declared that they must have whatever related to his Office. They were answered that they might send persons, not exceeding six, to search the House, and take away whatever papers they could find appertaining to the Office. But not satisfied with this they insisted unconditionally, that the armed Men, who were in the House, for its defence, should march out and ground their arms, which Major Kirkpatrick peremptorily refused; considering it, and representing it to them, as a proof of a design to destroy the property. This refusal put an end to the parley.  
A brisk firing then ensued between the Insurgents and those in the House, which it is said lasted for near an Hour, till the  
  
assailants having set fire to the neighbouring and adjacent buildings eight in number, the intenseness of the Heat, and the danger of an immediate communication of the fire to the House, obliged Major Kirkpatrick and his small party to come out and surrender themselves. In the course of the firing, one of the Insurgents was killed and several wounded, and three of the persons in the house, were also wounded. The person killed is understood to have been the leader of the party, of the name of James McFarlane, then a Major in the Militia formerly a Lieutenant in the Pennsylvania line. The dwelling House, after the surrender, shared the fate of the other buildings; the whole of which, were consumed to The ground. The loss of property to the Inspector upon this occasion, is estimated, and, as it is believed with great moderation, at not less than Three Thousand pounds.  
The Marshall, Colonel Presley Neville, and several others were taken by the Insurgents going to the Inspectors House. All, except the Marshall and Colonel Neville, soon made their escape; but these were carried off some distance from the place where the affray had happened, and detained till one or two O’clock the next morning. In the course of their detention, the Marshall in particular suffered very severe and humiliating treatment; and was frequently in imminent danger of his life. several of the party repeatedly presented their pieces at him, with every appearance of a design to assassinate, from which they were with difficulty restrained by the efforts of a few more humane, and more prudent.  
Nor could he obtain safety or liberty, but upon the condition of a promise guaranteed by Colonel Neville, that he would serve no other process on the west Side of the Alleghany Mountain. The alternative being immediate death extorted from the Marshall a compliance with this condition; notwithstanding the Just sense of Official dignity, and the firmness of character, which were witnessed by his conduct throughout the trying scenes he had experienced.  
The Insurgents, on the 18th sent a deputation of two of their number (one a Justice of the peace) to Pittsburgh, to require of the Marshall, a surrender of the processes in his possession, intimating that his compliance would satisfy the people, and add to his safety; and also to demand of General Neville, in peremptory terms, the resignation of his Office, threatening, in case of  
  
refusal, to attack the place and take him by force: demands which both these Officers did not hesitate to reject, as alike incompatible with their honor and their duty.  
As it was well ascertained, that no protection was to be expected from the Magistrates or Inhabitants of Pittsburgh, it became necessary to the safety, both of the Inspector and the Marshall to quit that place; and as it was known that all the usual routes to Philadelphia were beset by the Insurgents, they concluded to descend the Ohio, and proceed, by a circuitous route, to the seat of Government; which they began to put in execution on the night of the 19th of July.  
Information has also been received of a meeting of a considerable number of persons at a place called Mingo Creek Meeting House, in the County of Washington, to consult about the further measures which it might be adviseable to pursue: that at this meeting, a motion was made to approve and agree to support the proceedings which had taken place, until the excise Law was repealed, and an Act of oblivion passed. But that, instead of this, it had been agreed, that the four Western Counties of Pennsylvania and the neighbouring Counties of Virginia, should be invited to meet in a convention of Delegates, on the 14th of the present Month at Parkinson’s on Mingo Creek, in the County of Washington, to take into consideration the situation of the Western Country, and concert such measures as should appear suited to the occasion.  
It appears, moreover, that on the 25th of July last the Mail of the United States, on the road from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, was stopped by two armed Men, who cut it open, and took out all the letters, except those contained in one packet: these armed men, from all the circumstances which occurred, were manifestly acting on the part of the Insurgents.  
The declared object of the foregoing proceedings, is to obstruct the execution and compel a repeal of the laws, laying duties on spirits distilled within the United States and upon Stills; There is just cause to believe, that this is connected with an indisposition, too general in that quarter, to share in the common burthens of the community; and with a wish, among some persons of influence, to embarrass the Goverment. It is affirmed by well informed persons to be a fact of notoriety, that the Revenue laws of the State itself have always been either resisted or very  
  
Defectively complied with in the same quarter.  With the most perfect Respect, I have the honor to be Sir, Your most Obedient

Tttdfu&#x27;ry Tjcpar i&#x27;ntn!. AuguH ztb, 1794.  
SIR,  
rr-&#x27;Hb difagrecable crisis at which ma&#x27;ters have  
1 .lately arrived in Softie of the western counties  
of Pennsylvania, with regard to the laws laying du­  
ties on Spirits dllVilted wfthin tile United States, and  
on (Villi; Seems to render proper a review 6?the cir­  
eurtiftancej which hSve attended those lawn in that  
ftene, from their commencement to the present time,  
and of the condudt which haahitherro been observed  
on the part of the government, its motives and ef­  
fect— in order to a bett&#x27;7 judgment of the measures&#x27;  
rieeffary to lie pursued in the exiflng eniergeticy.  
The opposition to those laws lii the four mod  
western coulitlesofP&lt;flinfylva.nia, (A.Utghany/J&#x27;afh­  
ington, Fayette, and Weftmoreland) commenced as  
«?rly as they were known to have been palled. It  
has continued, with different degrees of Violence; ib  
tlie different counties, and at different periods.—  
J&#x27;jt Wafhingron h.rs Uniformly diftingnifnffd its re­  
finance, by a mote exaafiive ipiri&#x27;t, than hti. appear­  
ed in the other counties, and seems to h&#x27; vc been  
chic Av iiilliumental in kindling and keeping aliVe  
the flame.  
The opposition firfl manifeffed itfelfin the milder  
ffiape or tne circulation of opinions unfavorable to  
the law, and calculated; by the influence ol public  
difeftcem; to difcsiutige the accepting or hgtkLtng of  
®fEces under It, or the complying with It by thoie&quot;  
wHo might He so disposed 1 to which was added, the  
Jliew of a difcontirmancc ofth. bufir.efs ol difliiliiig.  
These expedients ware Ihortly after Succeeded by  
private affociatioiis to forbear compliances with the  
law. ifut it wa- not long before these more nega­  
tive modes of opposition were perceived to be likely  
to prove ineffectual. And in proportion as this was  
the cafe, and as the means of introducing the laws  
fats&#x27;operation were put into execution, tlie dtlpofl­  
tion to resistance became more turbtilciit and nlore  
hi&#x27;lmed toadept aftid&#x27;prttftieevhleht expedients. The  
officers now began to experience marksof contempt &amp;  
ir.lult. Threats again ft them became frequent and  
laud; and after Some time, these threats were ri­  
pened into a&lt;Sh of ill-treatment and «uttage.  
These aits of violence were preceded by certain  
iheetirigs of malcontent persons, who entered into&#x27;  
tefilmisns* calculated at once to sonfirm, infiathe  
Whd lyftematize the Spirit&#x27;of opposition  
The fir a of these meetings was hidden at a place  
called Red Stone Old Fort, on the 17th of July,  
&lt;79&#x27;, where it was concerted that county commit­  
t«et. Should he- convened in the four counties, at  
the rel&#x27;petfive feats Of justice therein. On the 13d  
of *uguft following, one f these committees assem­  
bled in the countyof Washington.  
This meeting pnffrd fonie intemperate resolutions,  
which were afierward* printed in the Pitifbnrg Ga­  
iretre, corrtilnirtg a ftrtuig censure on the law, de­  
tlaring that aity perlon -ivto hdttacctpted o&gt; mitt! dc­

utely to refufe all kind of communication or intercourf  
viitt tie officeri, and to -withholdfrom them all aid!, fop.  
pertj or ctmfoi t&#x27;.  
Not content with this vindi&amp;ive profcriptibn of  
those who might esteem it their chitv, in tile capa­  
city of officers, to aid in the execution of the con­  
stitutional laws of the land, the&#x27; meeting pi nceeded  
to accumulate topics of crimination of the govern­  
ment, though foreign to each other; authoriflng,  
hy this leal for cenftire, a fufpieiott that w re  
actuated, not merely hy the diilike of a particular  
law, but by a disposition to render the government  
ltfcif unpopular and odious.  
meeting, m further pi ofecutioti of their  
plan, deprtfed three of their members to meet de­  
legates from the counties of Weftmoreland, Fayette  
and Allegheny on the lft Tuesday ofSept: folic wing,  
for the purpofc of exprefling the fenfn of the people  
of those counties in an address to the legislature of  
the United States, upon the fuhjeit of the Exciie  
Law and&#x27;cfjftfr grievances.  
Another marting accordingly took place oH the&#x27;  
7th of September, 1791, at Pittlbur.h, in the  
county of Alleghany, at which there appeared per­  
sons in character of delegates from the four Wes­  
tern conntie».  
&#x27; his meeting entered into resolutions more c«m­  
pi&lt;hcnfive iii theirobjecftsand not lefsinflammatory  
in their tendency , than those which had before pair­  
ed the meeting in Waihington. Their resolutions  
contained severe censures not only on the law hich  
as the immediate Subject of objedtion, but upon  
• at t*iey termed the exorbitant Salaries of oficers:  
•he unreafonahle interest of the public deist; the

led out of their way the Cieeting it WafSiington ap­

Which h&#x27;aVe heen from time to time committed;  
: Serving M give c&#x27;onfiftericy to an opposition w .ich  
has at length matured to a point, that threatens t. Ie  
foundations of tlie government and of the Union —  
unless ffeedily and effectually Subdued.  
On the 6th of the fame month of September, the  
ftppofitinn bVelce otiT ih all ail of violence upon the  
person and pn.perty of Robert Jefhnlon, ccllcdtor  
of the revenue for the counties of Alleghany and  
Washington.  
A party of men Krthed ind difguil&#x27;ed, Way-laid him  
it a place on Pidgeon Creek in Walhir.gton county,  
feiied, tarred an.&#x27; feathered hiWv, ctit off his hair,  
and deprived him of his horse, obliging hirrt to tra­  
vel on foot a confideralde distance in that Mortify­  
ing and pair.tul lltuation.  
The cafe was brought before the diftriii coiirt of i  
lvanla, oat of which proceftes issued againd  
John Robettfort, Johtt Hamiltotf, and Thomas  
M&#x27;Comb three of the perfsns concerned in the  
outrage. . ,  
The Serving of these processes v/as conßded by  
the then marshal Clement Biddle&#x27;, to his deputy  
JofephFoX, who in the month of Oaioht;r went in­  
to Alleghany county for the purftofe of fsrVing them.  
The appearances and circcmftartceS Which Mr.  
Fox observed himielf, lti the courle of his journey,  
and learnt afterwards upon his arfivai at Pittsburgh,  
had the effeift of dcterrii&#x27;.j; him from the Service of  
the ptoceffes, and unfortunately fed to ?dopt the in­  
judicious and frbiclefs expedient 0? fencing them to  
the parties by a private messenger under crtver.  
The deputy&#x27;s report to the marshal, Slat&#x27;es a  
number of particulars evincing a considerable fer­  
mentation in the part of the country to wliicb fe  
was tent, and inducing a belie! oi. his part, that he  
■ ould nor with Safety hai/&#x27;e Executed the proct Ses.  
The matfbal transmitting this report to the diilri6t  
attorney, maltesthe following observation, it.  
&quot; I am sorry to add, tbflt be (the dtpiity) found tnc  
people in gi neral in the wellefn p, ht of the ft at  
and particularly b. yond the Alleghany mountaine  
Kch a ferment on .VcOuht nf the act of Coiigrcii  
fyi-lading a duty on distilled spirits, and so mum  
oppnir&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;n the ecec&#x27;j-t-nT of tfrc Taf-i aH, and fro &#x27;  
a variety of ..thrents to nimfelt pcrfonlilly, althtugh  
he took tile iitihoft precaution to conceal his prrand;  
that he wis convinced oS the hllpntlibiUty  
of Serving the proeefa, but.that any attempt to cf­  
ftft&#x27;it would H*vte dccafioned the hioJV Violent bppo­  
fltion fi&#x27;om the. greater part of the inhabitants, and  
he declares that if 4tr 1(«&lt;J, attempted it, he believe!  
he (hould not have teturnsd alive.  
&quot; I lpared no expense ncir pains to have the proceis  
of the court executed, and have not the least doubt  
that my deputy would have acccrtaplifbad it, if it  
ctiuld have btfeli done.&quot;  
The reality of the dinger to the deputy wis  
countenanced by the opirion of gin.. Neville, the  
infpq6tor of the revenue ; a naan who before had  
given, and fint eh.as given nuiherous proofs of a stea­  
dy arid firm temper; and Wfe&#x27;it follbwed is a&#x27; further  
; Confirmation of it.  
Tile per fun who had beeti sent with the processes,  
; was seized, whipped, tarred, arid feathered; and  
after, having his money and horse taken from him,  
was blindfolded and tied in the woods, in which  
condition he remained sot five hoars&#x27;.  
Very f.rloiis reflections naturally occurredUptin  
this occasion. It seemed highly phibafele, from the  
issue of the experiment which had, been made, that  
the ordinary course of eivil prtcefi would be inef­  
fedtual for enforcing the execu&#x27;lon of the law, in the  
scene in qneftion —and that a perseverance in this  
course might lead ta a ftriotis concuflion. The law  
iiftlf was flill in the infancy of its operation, and  
fat frottt eflabliflletl in other ilnpoi lanr portions  
of the Union. Prejudices against it had been in­  
. duftnoufly disseminated, mifrepreferitations diffu­  
fed, misconceptions foftered. The legislature of  
thi&#x27;United State&#x27;s had art yet organized th&#x27;e means  
by Which the executive could cCirfir in aid of the  
jtidleiary, when found incompetent to the executi­  
on of the laws. 11 neither of these impediments to  
a decisive exertion had existed, it was desirable, sf­

is in such cases the ultimate retort, till all the milder

Other incidents occurred from time to time,  
which are further proofs of the very improper tem­

the fame period , experienced outrage&#x27;. Mr Wells,  
collector of the reven e fur Weffn . eland aiitf&#x27;Fiy­

underwent the humiliating puniftiinent of tarring  
and feathering with fdrvu aggravations, for having  
in eonve;fatic|(&gt; hazarded the Very natural and just,  
but unpalatable remark that the inhabitants of that  
country could hot. rtafoniibly expert frofn  
a government, whose laws they so strenuously oppo­

fruflrated.  
In the feflton of which comrtienced in

May Btfi, 1791* during that material alte­  
rations were made in it—among these- the duty was  
reduced to a rate so. moderate, as to have silenced  
complaint on that head—and a new bnd very favo­  
rable alternative was given to the dilliller, that of  
paying a mcnthly, lhfte&amp;d yearly rate, according  
to the capacity of his jjkjH, wi&#x27;tH liberty to take a  
licence for the precise term, which he ihould intend  
to w«rk it, and to renew tnat licence fbr a farther  
term or terms. &#x27;  
This amending actj in its progress through the  
legifiatursengaged the pa: ticular attentionol hieni­  
feKcfs Who themieHrts y+crc  
and of others who represented parts «f the country

The eife&amp; has in a great measure correfpondVd  
with the views of the legislature. Opposition hai  
fubfidcd in several difitridb where it bef re prevai­  
led,and it was natural to entertain and not easy to a­  
bfcndon a hope :hat the fame thing would by degrees  
havd tf ken place in the four western counties of  
thi? state.  
But notwithstanding some flattering appearances  
&amp; particular junctures, akd infinite jpainc by vari­  
ous expedients to produce the desirable iflue, the  
nope entertained has n ver been realized, and is now  
at an end as far as the ordinary means of executing  
laws ate concerned.  
she firft law had left the number ahd positions  
of the officers of Infpe&amp;ion, which were to be tfta­  
bliflied in each diftriit for receiving entries of stills,  
to the discretion of the supervisor. The second, to  
ftCure a due accommodation to distillers, provides  
peremptorily, that there fhidl be one in each county.  
The idea was immediately embraced, that it was  
a&#x27; very important point in thefrhemc of opposition  
tp the law to prevent the establishment of offices iri  
the refpe6iive counties.  
for this pUrpofc, the ihtimidation of well-difpofcd  
1 ihhabitants was added to th« plan of molesting and  
«bftrtr6ling the officers by forceor otherWise, as  
migjHt be necessary. So efTc&amp;uajly was the firft  
point carried (the certain deftrudion of property,  
and the peril of life being involved) that it became  
aimoft impra&#x27;iSicablfc to obtain suitable places fat of­  
fices of the counties; and when ottainfed,  
it was found a matter of neceflity, iri almofl every  
idftance, to abandon them.  
After much effort the Infpe«Sor of the Revenue  
r Kiccceded in procuring the house of William Faulk­  
ner j a GapVaTn in the army, for an office of infpfec­  
ticjh in the county of Wafliington. This tookplace  
ih Ailgufl, 179 a. The #!fice #as attended bv the  
Ihfpe&lt;ftf«r of the Revenue in person, till prevented  
by the following incidents.  
Captain Faulkner being in purfr.it of some dfcfet­  
ters from the troops, was encountered by a number  
of1* people; irt the fame neighborhood where Mr.  
had been ill-treated the preceding year, who  
repreached him with letting his house for an office  
; of infpe&amp;ion, drew a knife upon him, threatened t,o  
scalp him, tar and feather him, and reduce his house  
, 4nd property to ashes,&#x27; if he did »&gt;ot solemnly promire  
to prevent the further iife of his house for an office.  
v Captain Faulkner wai. induced to i&#x27;riakc the   
e*ad;ed; and; in conlequence of the circumstance,  
Wrote a letter to the l».fpc&lt;stor, dated the i6th of  
4ugU&amp;, countermanding the permiflion fer using  
his house ; the day following gavp a public no­  
tice in The Pittfbu&#x27;g Gazette, that the office of in­  
fpc&amp;ion fhfiuld be n. longfer kept tfcere.

»imed, besides the influeltc* of penihies an delin­  
quents, at making it the teiiertfl iutereft of the diftil­  
leri, to comply w;ththelaws, by interrupting the raar-  
Vet for a very confiderabte forplus, and by, at the  
.fame t me, confining the beriiSt&#x27;cif *the large defmand  
•for public Venice those Vhc did their duty to the  
public, Imd furnifhing, through: he of pay­  
ments inxafh, that medium fcr paying the duties, the  
want ps which was alleged to be a great difficulty iti  
the *»»y of compliance.  
Hut twociirtemtiancesconfpired&#x27;to counteract the fuc-  
Cess of the pj*n—one. the neccflity, towards incurring  
the penalties of non-&lt; ompliance, of there being an of­  
fice of irifpedtian in each county, which was prevented  
in some of the counties, by the means of intimidation  
praftifed&#x27;for that purpose—another, the non-extentiou  
of the law to the territory north-weft of the Ohio, into  
which a large proportion of the surplus before men­  
tioned was font.  
A cure for these defefls could only come from the  
tegißature.—Accordingly in the feifion which began  
in November measures were taken for procur­  
ing a further revision of the laws. A bill containing  
amendments of those -and other defects was brought  
in ;—but it Co happened that this objeCt, by reatbil of  
more urgent bulinefs, was&#x27;deferred till towards the  
close of the feflion, and finally went off, through  
the usual hurry of that period.  
Ths cftntinuance of the embarrassment incident to  
Miis state Of things, naturally tended to diminish much  
ihe efficacy of the plan which had been deviled. Yet  
it was resolved, as far as legal pravitions would bear  
»ut the otficers, to pursue it witH perseverance: there  
was ground to entertain hopes of its good cited, and  
it was certainly the null likely course which could  
have been adopted towards attaining the object of the  
laws, by means fitort of force;—evincing, unequivo­  
. cally, the finoere difpoution to avoid this painful re­  
lon, and thcTteady moderation, which ha/e charac­  
terised the measures of the government.  
In pursuance of this plan, prosecutions were occa-  
Jionally iuftituted in the mildeft-forms, feisures were  
made as opportunities occurred—and purehafes on  
public account were carried on.  
It may be incidentally remarked, that these pur­  
bhafes were extended to other places ; where, though  
trie fame disorders did not exist, it appeared* ad­  
vil&#x27;eable to facilitate the payment of the duties by this  
Species of accommodation.  
Nor was this plan, notwithstanding the deficiency  
Of legal provision, which impeded its full exetution,  
without conefponding effects.  
Symptdms from time to time appeared which au­  
thorised expectation, that with the aid, at another  
ftffion, of the deiired Arpplementary provisions, it  
was capable of accomplishing its end, if no extraordi­  
nary events occurred.  
The opponents of the laws, not insensible of the  
tendency of that plan, not of the defects in the laws  
Which interfered with it, did not fail from time to  
time to pursue analogous modes of counteraction.  
The effort to fruftrate the eftablilhment of of­  
fices of infpecV.on, in particular, was pethiied in  
and even inercsted; means of intimidating officers  
ind others continued to be exartetj.  
In April 179J, a party of arttoeti Irien, in disguise,  
made an attack in the night upon the house of a col­  
letter of re\cone, who relided in Fayette county;  
but he happening to be from home, they contented  
themselves with breaking open his house, threaten­  
ing, terrifying, and abuling his family.  
Wan ants were ifiued for apprehending some of the  
rioters upon tins occaiion, by Isaac Mason and times  
Findiev. adiitint judges of Kavette county, which wttre  
delivered to the iheriff of that county, who it feefas  
reiufed to execute them ;—for which he has iince been  
indicted.  
This is 41 once an example of a disposition tqfup­  
port the laws of the Union, and of an opposite one,  
in the local ofiicers of Pennsylvania, within the non­  
vomplyinf fctre.*—&quot;But it i» a truth, too important  
not to be noticed, and too injurious not to be lamented  
that the prevailing lpirit of those officers has been ei­  
ther hoflile or lukewartn to the exebution of those  
laws—and that the weight of an unfriendly official  
iriduenee has been one of the moil lerious obftaples,  
Vtithwhiqh they have had toiiruggle.  
In June following, the infpeftor of the revenue  
was burnt is effigy bi AJlegtitny county, at 1 place  
And on a day cf some public election, With mUch dif­  
piay, in the pretence of and v,ithouLinterruption from  
xnagittiates, and other public odiceis.  
On the night Of t:ie a2d of November, another  
party of men, forae of them a med, Jnd all in disguise,  
went to the house of the fame cdlletlor-ofi Fayette,  
wh.ch had been visited in Ajjtil, broke and entered iu  
ahd demanded a&#x27;furrender of the officer s commit Con  
and official books. Upon hjs refitting to deliver them  
up; they prelented piitojs at him, and fwbre, that if  
he&#x27; did&#x27; not comply, they would inlteutly put him to  
dfeath, At length, a fu.rendar of the cornmiffion and  
books Was enforced. But not content with this, the  
i.oters, before they departed, required of the officer,  
that h£ thould, within two weeks, publish his religna­  
tjon origin of another visit, and, the deifruction of his  
house.  
Notwithstanding these excesses, the laws appeared  
during the latter periods of th.s year, (1793), to be  
rather gaining ground. Several principal distillers,  
who had formerly held out, complied, and others  
d fcovered a difpoution to comply, whiih was only re­  
trained by the fear of violence.  
But these favourable circumstances served to  
beget alarm among those who were determined,  
at all events, to prevent the quiet eftablilhment  
of the laws. It loon appeared, that they medi­  
tated, by frefh and greater exceiles, to aim a ftiil  
more effectual blow at them;—to subdue the  
growing spirit of compliance, and to destroy en­  
tirely the organs of the laws, within that part of  
the country, by compelling all the officers to re­  
nounce their offices.  
The last proceeding, in the cafe of the collec­  
tor of Fayette, was in this spirit. In January of  
the prel&#x27;ent year, further violences appear to have  
been perpetrated. William Richmond, who had  
given information against some of the rioters, in  
the affair of. Wilson, had his barn burnt with  
all the grain and hay, which it contained; and  
the fame thing happened to Robert Shawhan, a  
difkiller, who had been among the firft to comply  
with the law, and who had always spoken favour*  
ably of it. But, in neither of these inflances,  
(which happened in the county of Alleghany)  
though the preemptions were violent, was any  
positive proof obtained.  
The infpe&amp;or of&#x27;the revenue, in a letter of the  
17th of February, writes, that he had received  
information, that persons living near the dividing  
line of Allaghany and Washington, had thrown  
out threats of tarring aud feathering one William  
Cochran, a complying diftiller,and of burning his  
difliltery; and that it had also been given out,  
that in three weeks, there would not be a house  
Handing in Alleghany county, of any person, who  
had complied with the laws. In Consequence of  
Which, he had been induced to pay a visit to fe­  
deral leading individuals in that quarter, as well  
to ascertain the truth of the information as to en­  
deavour to avert the attempt to executc such  
threats.  
It appeared afterwards, that on his return home,  
he had been pursued by a coUeAion of disorderly  
persons, threatening, as they went along, ven­  
geance againlt him. Ofi their way, these men  
called at the house of James Kiddoe, who had re­  
cently complied with the taws, broke into his  
  
ftill4i6ufe, fired ftv«ral l&gt;iH» under iis (18, and  
frittered lire over and about the hoife.  
Letters from the infpeclor iq Marci, anW»ne«  
an encreafed aitivity in promoting oapoliipn to  
the laws—frequent meetings trt cement snd ex­  
tend the combinations against it; and among  
other means for this purpoiiva plan «f coieitiflg  
? force to seize him, compel him to reign bis com­  
millioD, and detain him prifoner—.piobably a« a  
hostage.  
In May and June new violences were commit­  
ted. James Kiddoe, the person above mentioned,  
and William Cochran, another complying diftil­  
lcr, met with repeated injury to their property.  
Kiddoe had parts of hi 6 grift-mill, at different  
times, carried away ; and Cochran fuifered more  
material injuries. His still was destroyed, his  
saw-mill wi* rendered useless by the taking away  
of the saw, and his grift-niill so injured, as to re­  
quire to be repaired at confideraWe expsnfe.  
At the lad vilit, * note in writing was left, re­  
quiring him to publish what he had fuffered, in  
the Pittlburgh Gazette, on pain of another visit;  
in which he is threatened, iq figurative, but in­  
telligible terms, with the definition of his pro­  
perty by fire : Thus adding to the profligacy of  
doing wanton injuries to a fellow-citizen, the tv&#x27;  
ranny of compelling him to be the publisher of  
his wrongs.  
June being the mbntli for receiving annual en­  
tries of stills, endeavours were used to open offices  
in Weftmoreland and Washington, where it had  
been hitherto found impracticable. With much  
pains a;»d difficulty, glares were procured fortlie  
purpose. That in Weftmoreland was repeatedly  
attacked in the night by armed men, who fre­  
quently fired upon it ; but according to a report  
which has been made to this department, it was  
defended with fomuch courage and pcrfeverance,  
by John Wells, an auxiliary officer, and Philip  
Ragan, the owner of the ijoufe, as to have been  
maintained during the remainder of the month.  
That, in Washington, after repeated attempts,  
was fupprefled. The fjrtl attempt was confiifed  
to pulling down the lign of the office, and threats  
of future deftrqition. The second effected the  
objedt in the following mode. About twelve per­  
sons, armed and painte3 black, in the night of the  
6th of June, broke into the house of John Lynn  
whefe the office was kept; and after having trea-  
Chcroufly feditfced him to coqie dovn flairs, and  
put himfelf in their power by a promise of fafety  
to himfelf and his houfe,they seized and tied him,  
threatened to hang him, took him to a retired  
spot in the neighbouring wood ; and there, after  
cutting off his hair, tarring and feathering hnn,  
swore him never again to alloW the use of his  
house for an office, never to difclbfe their names,  
and never again to have any fort of agency in  
aid of the excise: Having done which,they boftnd  
hiin naked to a tree, and left him in that Situa­  
tion till morning ; when he focceeded wi extri­  
cating himfelf. Not content with this, the rr.al*-  
contents, l&#x27;oroe days after, made him another vi­  
lit ; pulled down part of his house, and put him  
in a fituiition to be obligeel to become an exile  
from his own home, and to find an afylura elfr­  
where.  
During this time, several of the di(filters, who  
had made entries and benefitted by flieul, refufed  
the payment of the duties ; Aituated, no.doubt, by  
Various motives.  
Indications of a plan&#x27;to proceed against thein­  
fpector of the revenue, in the maimer which has  
been before mentioned, continued. In a letter  
from hnn of the loth of July, he ohferveel, that  
the threatened vifithad not yet been made, though  
he had still reason to expedtit.  
In the l&#x27;effion of Conjjrefs which began in De­  
cember 1793, a bill for making the- amendments  
in the laws, which had been for some time de­  
sired, was brought in, ard on the jth of June last  
became a law.  
It is ni&gt;t to be doubted, tliat the different stages  
6f this bufmefs was regularly notified to the mal­  
tontents, and that a conviction of the tendency of  
the amendments Cbntemplated to efteihiate the  
execution of the law&quot;-, had itiatuied the rel&#x27;olution  
ttf bring matters to a violent crisis.  
The encreafing energy of the opposition, ren­  
dered it indifpenlablc to meet the evil with pro­  
portionable de-cifion. The idea of giving time for  
the la\V to extend itfclf, in scenes where the dif­  
fatisfailion with it was the effeit, not of an impro­  
per spirit, but of causes which were of a nature  
toyieid to reafon,reflci)ion,and experience (which  
had Canftantly weighed in the estimate of the  
measures proper to be pursued) had had its effect,  
in auextenfive degree. The experiment, too,had  
been long enough tried; to ascertain, that where  
refinance continued, the root of the evil lay deep,  
ihd required measures of greater efficacy than  
hid been pursued. TR&#x27;e laws had undergone re­  
peated fevifions of the lcgiflative reprefentatjves  
of the union; and had virtually received their re­  
peated fanition, without eVen afi attempt, as far  
as is now recollected, or can be traced, to effeil  
their repeal;—affprding an evidence of the gene­  
ral feofc&#x27;of the community ip their favour. Com­  
plaints began to be loud, from complying quar­  
ters, against the impropriety and injustice of fuf­  
fering the laws to remain unexecuted in others.  
Under the united influence of these considera­  
tions, there was no choice but to try the efficiency,  
of tiie laws, in profecutirig, with vigour, delin­  
quents and offenders.  
Procel&#x27;s issued against a number us non-comply­  
ing distillers in the counties of&#x27;Fayette and Allegha­  
ny; and indictments having been foundatacircuit  
court, holden at Philadelphia in July last, against:  
Robert Sinil&#x27;e and John M&#x27;Culloch, two of the  
rioters in the attack, which, in November prece­  
ding, Had been made upon the house of a collec­  
tor of the revenue in Fayette county, processes is­  
sued against them also, to bring them to trial j and  
if guilty, to puniflijnent.  
The marfliail of the diftrid went in person to  
serve these processes. He executed his trust with­  
out interruption, though under many discourag­  
ing circumltances, in Fayette county ; but while  
he was 111 the execution of it iq Alleghany county,  
being then accompanied by the infpeilor of the  
revenue (to,wit) on the 15th of July last, he was  
beset on the road by a party of from thirty to for­  
ty armed men, who, after much previous irregu­  
larity of conduit, finally fired upon him ; but as  
it happened, without injury either to him or to  
thtf infpeilor.  
This attempt on the marfliail was but the pre­  
lude of greater excesses,  
About break-os-day, the 16th of July, in con­  
formity with a plan, which seems to have been  
for some-time entertained, and which probably  
was only accelerated by the coming of thfc mar­  
fliall into the survey, an attack, by about one  
hundred persons, armed with guns and other wea­  
pons, was made upon the house of the infpeilor  
m the vicinity of Pittsburgh. The infpeilor, tho*  
alone, vigorously defended himfelf against the as­  
sailants, and obliged them to retreat, without ac­  
complifliing their purpose.  
Apprehending that the bufmefs would- not ter­  
minate here, he made application bv letter to the  
judges, generals of militia, and flieriff of the coun­  
  
ty for protcftion. A reply to his application,  
-from John Wilkins, jun. and John Gib!on, magi­  
ftrate3 and militia officers, informed him, that the  
laws could not be executed, so as to afford him  
the protection to which he was entitled, owing _  
to the too-general combinatiem of the people in  
that part ef Pennsylvania,to oppose the revenue­  
law ; adding, that they would take every flop in  
their power to bring the rioters to juflace, and  
would be glad to receive information of the indi­  
viduals concerned in the attack upon his honfe,  
.that proleeutiOns might be commenced against  
them; and exprelling their forrow,that thould the  
posse comitate of the county be ordered out ,  
in&#x27;fupport of the civil authority, very few could  
be gotten that wtrenot of the paj-ty of the rioters.  
The day following, the insurgents re-aliembled,  
with a conliderabli augmentation of numbers,  
amounting, as has been computed, to at least live  
huni&#x27;.-ed ; and on the 17th of July, renewed their  
attack upon the house of the infpeiftor; who, ia  
the interval, had taken the precaution of calling to  
his aid a small detachment from the garrison of  
Fort-Pitt, which, at the time of the attack, con­  
fided of eleven men, who -had been joined by  
Major Abraham Kirkpatrick, a friend and con­  
nexion ef the intpector.  
There being fcarecly a profpeCl of effectual  
defence against so large a body is then appeared,  
and as the infpecftor had every thing to appre­  
hend for his person, if taken, it was judged ad­  
visable, that he should withdraw from the house  
to a place of concealment; Major Kirkpatrick  
geaeroufly agreeing to remain with the eleven  
men, in the intention, if practicable, to make a  
capitulation in favour of the property, if not to  
defend it as long as possible.  
A parley took place urtder cover of a flag,  
was sent by the insurgents Jo the house to  
demand, that the infpeftor mould come forth, re­  
nounce his office, and ftipulatt never again to ac­  
cept an office under the fame laws. To this it was  
replied, that the infpeitor had left the ho Life,  
upon their firft approach, and that the place to  
which he had retired was unknown. Tftey then  
declared that they mull have whatever rfciatedl to  
his office. They were answered, that they ttiight  
fend persons, not exceeding fix, to search the hottfe,  
and take away whatever papers they could find  
appertaining to the office. But not fatisfied with  
this, they insisted unconditionally, that the armed  
men, who iverein the house for its defence, fliould  
march out and ground their arnts, wtaicj) Major&#x27;  
Kirkpatrick peremptorily refufed; considering it  
and representing it to them as a proof of a design  
to destroy the property. This refufal put an end  
to the parley. *  
A brisk firing then ensued between the insur­  
gents and those in the house, which it it said laft­  
£d for near an hour, till the aflailants havingfetfire  
to the neighbouring and adjacent buildings, eight  
in number, the intenfenefs of the heat, and the  
dangers of an immediate communication of the  
fire to the house, obliged Majbr Kirkpatrick and  
his small party to come out and surrender them­  
felvcs. In the ceairfe of the firing, one of the insur­  
gents was killed and several wounded, and three  
of the persons in the house were also wounded.  
The person killed is urtdefftood to hare been the  
leader of the party, of the name of James M&#x27;Tar­  
lar.r, then a major in the militia, formerly a lieute­  
nant in the Pennsylvania line. The dwelling­  
hsufe, after the surrender, shared the fate 6/ the  
other buildings; the whole of which were con­  
sumed to the ground. Thelal&#x27;s of property to the  
inipector, upon this occ&amp;liou, is estimated, and, as  
it is l&gt;L*lieVed, with great moderation, at not less  
_ than three tfioufand pounds.  
The marfhali, Colonel Prcfley Neville, and se­  
veral others, were taken by the insurgents going  
to the iufpccforV house. All, except the niarfliall  
and Colonel Neville, fopn made their escape ;but  
these were carried off some difianoe from the  
place where the atlray had happened, and detain­  
ed till one or two o&#x27;clook the next ihOming. In  
the course of their detention, the mar fliail in par­  
ticular l&#x27;uffered very feyere and humiliating treat­  
ment ; and was frequently in imminent danger  
of his life. Several of the j-arty repeatedly pre­  
sented their pieces at liim, with every appearance  
of a design to atfaffmat#, from which they were,  
with dirhculty, restrained hy the efforts of a few  
more humane aud more prndrrlt.  
Nor could he obtain fatety or liberty, but upoo  
the condition of a promise guaranteed by Colonel  
Neville, that he would serve no other process on  
! the weft fide of the AHeghany mountain. The  
alternative being, immediate death, extorted from  
• the marfliail a compliauce with this condition;  
notwithstanding the just fenfo of official dignity,  
aud the firmnefs of character, which were wit­  
nessed by his conduit throughout the trying  
scenes he had experienced-.  
The insurgents, on the 18th, sent a deputation  
of two of their number (one a iuftlce of&#x27; the  
peace) to Pittsburgh, to require of the marfhali  
a surrender of the processes in his poffeffiouj in­  
&#x27; timatmgi that his compliance would fatisfy the  
- people and u&#x27;Lr to bh Jfiiftiy; and also to demand of  
general Neville, it! peremptory terms, the resigna­  
tion of his office, threatening, iu calc of refufal,  
to attack the place and take him by. force: de­  
mands which both these officers did not\befitate  
tb rcjeit, as alike incompatible with their ho­  
nour, and their dtify.  
As it was well ascertained, that no protection  
was to be exptited from the magistrates or inha­  
bitants of Pittsburgh, it became necefl&#x27;ary to the  
fafety, both of the infpeitor and the marfliail, to  
, quit that plac£; arid,as it was kntlwn that all the  
usual routes to Philadelphia were beset by the in­  
surgents, they concluded to descend the Ohio,and  
proceed, by a circuitous route, to the feat of go­  
c vernment; which they begin to put in execution  
on the night of the iyt-h of Jitly.  
Infomation l»as also been received Of a meeting  
of a couhderable number of perfbDs at a place?  
called Mingo-Creek Meeting-House, in the coun­  
ty of Waflrington, to consult about the further  
measures which it might be adviiablt to purine :  
that at this meeting a motion was made to approve  
and agreeto l&#x27;upportthe proceedings whiehhadta­  
ken place, until the excifc law ttaS repealed, and  
* an ait of obliv.on passed. But tha!,iiiftead of this,  
it had been agreed, that the four weftem coun­  
ties of Pennsylvania, and the neighbouring coun­  
ties of Virginia, fliould be invited to meet in  
a convention of delegates, on the 14th of the  
present month, at Parkinfon&#x27;s, on Mingo-Creek,  
in the county of Wafhingtott, to take into conli­  
derat ion the situation of the western country, and  
, Concert such measures as fliould appear fttited to  
the ocafion.  
It appears, moreover, that on the 15th as July  
last, the mail of the united states, on the road  
from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, was flopped by  
two armed men, who cut it open, and took out  
all the except those contained in one pack­  
et ? these armed men, from all the circumstances  
which occurred, were inanifetlly ailing on. the  
part of the infurgeuts.  
The declared object of the foregoing proceed­  
ings, is to obftruit the execution and compel a  
repeal of the laws laying duties «u spirits distil-  
  
Ird within the united flat&#x27;s, and unon r, i

. Treasury Department, Jug. 5th. tTS4.  
u B:ii—The disagreeable erivis at winch mat­

counties of Pennsylvania, .with regard to the  
law* laying duties on spirits distilled within the  
United States, and on stills, seems to render

have attended those laws in that scene, from  
thSir commencement to the present time, and of  
the conduct which lias liiiheitoUeen observed on  
til? part uf the-government, iw motive and ef­  
fect—-in&#x27;order let form a bet.vr judgment of the  
measures necessary to be pu rafted in the exist­

*• The opposition Cist manifested tUeJi iotiii  
Thilder shape of the&#x27; eireulutiuii of ofRuiniis un­  
favorable to the laws, aiid eulenhtted, by the  
influence of piddle diseStecm, to discourage the  
tecertianc? or holding of olfieeti under it, or the  
complying with it by these who&#x27;might f! so de­  
posed—to which was added ’the shon&#x27;of a firs­  
coin hi a are of ihc business of distilling:  
*• 1 lieie expedients were shortly aftei supbeed­  
ed by private association* to forbear compliance  
with the law, Uu it was not Ihng beiore these  
mere negative inode* of opposition were per­  
eeitfed to be likely to prove itibiJeeliiuJ. Ana in  
proportion as ihiar was the case, and as (fife  
means of iritrirJneing- this laws into operation  
wars put iidir e:;iicidioii, the disposition to re­  
sistance hecame more turbulent and more incli­  
ncsl to adopt and practise violent expedient*.—  
The nlliccrs now began to experience/marks of

“ 1 lie inspector of the revenue, in a letter of  
lue 27In ot February, writes,&#x27;that persona liv­  
*ng near tiie dividing line of Alleghany and  
Washington, had thrown out Ihreuu of tarring  
and iealiieriug one William Cochran, a comply*  
tug distiller, and of burning his&#x27; distillery — and  
that it imd also been given out that in three  
weeks there would not be a house standing in  
Alleghany county, of any person who had coin­  
pliad With the laws—in consequence of which  
he had been,* induced to pay a Visit to several  
leading individuals in that quarter, as well  
to ascertain the truth of the information as to  
endeavor to avert the attempt to evecuto such  
threats.  
“ it appeared afterwards, that on his return  
home he had been pursued by &amp; collection of dis­  
orderly pursuits, threatening, as they went a­  
long, vengeance against him. On their way  
these risen called at the house of James KidJoe,  
who had recently complied with the laws, broke  
into his still house, fired several balls under his  
still, and scattered hre over and about the  
house.  
  
loiters From the inspector in March, an*  
nounrcd uti increased activity in promoting op­  
position to the laws—frequent meetings to eemeat  
ami extend the combinations against it—and a­  
tnnng other means fur this purpose, a plan of  
collecting a force to seize him, compel him to  
resign his commission, atjd detain him pruoaer,  
probably as a hostage. |  
“ lu May and June new violences were com*,  
milled. James Ki Idoe, the person above men­  
tioned, and William Cochran, another comply­  
ing distiller, met with repeated injury to their  
property. Itiddoe had parts of his grist-mill  
at different limes carried away—and Csehran  
smnerrd more material injuries —his still was  
destroyed, his saw-mill was rendered useless by  
the taking away of the saw, and his grist-mill  
so injured as to require to be repaired at a consi­  
derable expense.  
*&#x27; *hc Just visit a note in writing was left,  
requiring him to publish what he had suffered  
in the Pittsburg Gazette, on pain of another vi­  
sit, in which be is threatened in figurative, but  
intelligible terms, with the destruction of his  
property byfire—thus addingto the profligacy of  
doing wanton injuries to a fellow citizen, the ty­  
ranny’ of compelling him lo be the publisher of  
his ow n wrongs.  
‘‘.June^being the month for receiving annual  
entries of stills, endeavors were used to- open  
offices in Westmoreland and Washington, where  
it had bee* hitherto found impracticable. With  
much pants and difficulty places were procured  
for the purpose—that in Westmoreland was re­  
peatedly attacked in the night by armed men?  
wj*® f&quot;*«l»&gt;&#x27;=“•{*Ij fired upou it—but according to  
a report which has beon made to this depart­  
ment it was defended with so much courage nod  
perseVerance, by John Wells, an auxiliary offi­

of the month.  
“ That in Washington, after repeated attempts,  
was suppressed. The first attempt was confined  
Id pulling down the sign of the office, and threats  
of future .destruction. Tha second effected tho  
ohjeet in the following manner : About 12 per­  
sons armed, and painted black, in the night of  
the 6th June,broke into the house of John Lvnu,  
where the office was kept, and after having tree­  
eiaerously seduced Lite to come downstairs, and  
put himself in their power by a promise of safe­  
ty to himself and his house, they seized and ti­  
ed him, threatened to hnughim, took him to a  
retired spot in a neighboring wood, and there,  
after cutting off his hair, tarring add feather­  
ing him, swore him never again to allow the use  
of lus house for an office, never to disclose their  
names, and never again to have any sort of a­  
gency in aid of the eieise —having done which,  
they bound hiiu naked to a tree, and leftfliint in  
that situation till morning, when he su^&amp;ecded  
iu extricating himself. S’*t content with this,  
the malcontents soma days after, made him ano­  
ther visit, pulled down part of his house, and put  
him i:rasituation to be obliged to became,an ex­  
ile from his own home, ana to find anv asylum  
elsewhere. * &#x27;  
“During this time several of the distillers,  
who had made entries and benefited by them,  
refused line payment of the duties, actuated, no  
doubt, by various motives. .  
&#x27; “ Indications of a plan to proceed against tho  
Inspector of the revenue, in the manner which  
has bry* before mentioned, continued. In a  
ter frft&#x27;tt Him of (lie toth of July, he obsenSh^  
that the threatened visit had not been made,  
though he bad still reason to expect it,  
. “ In the sessio* of congress which began in  
December, 1793, abill fur making the amend­  
ments in the laws, which had been for some  
time desired, was brought in, •«£&#x27; on The Oth  
June last became u law; ^ -  
«^lt is not to be doubled that the different stages  
W this business were regularly notified to the  
maicontenls, and that a conviction of tho -&#x27;tiid­  
deney of the amendments contemplated to effee­  
tnate the execution of the law, had matured the  
resolution to bring matters to a Violent i-risis.  
“ T he increasing energy of -the opposition re*-:  
dared it indispensable ty meet the evil frith »rma  
  
portionable decision. The idea of giving time  
for the JatV to extend itself, in scene* where the  
dissatisfaction with it was the effect, not of im­  
proper spirit, but of causes which were of a na­  
ture to jteid to reason, reflection and experience,  
(’.vhirh eaustanlly &quot;veignetr in llie estimate of  
liie measures proper (a he pursued.) had had its  
effect in an extrusive, degree. The experiment,  
too, had been long enough tried to ascertain,  
t^at, where resistance continued, the root of the  
evil lay deep, aad required measures of grea­  
ter efficacy than had been pursued. The laws  
had undergone repeated revisions of the legis­  
lative representatives of the Union, antL had  
virtually received their repeated sanction,^ iifl­  
oat even un attempt, as far as is now recollec­  
ted, or ean he tr&amp;eed, to effect their repeal, af­  
fording u:j evidence of the general sense of the  
rr.n.znunity in their favor. Complaints ..began  
to be load, from complying quarters, against  
the impropriety and injustice of suffering the  
laws to remain unexecuted in others.  
“ Under the united influence of these consider­  
ations, there was no choice but to try the effi­  
ciency of the laws in nruscetiting, with vigor,  
delinquents and offenders. J »  
“ Processes issued against a number of non­  
complying distillers in the county of Fayette and  
Alleghany 5 indictments having been foimd at a  
circuit court, i.olden at Philadelphia in July  
lost, against Robert Smilie and John M‘C’ul*

ter much previous irregularity of conduct, final­  
ly fired upon him, but, us it happened, without  
injury either to him or ta the inspector.  
“ This attempt on the marshal was but the  
prelude of greater excesses.  
“ About break of day, the l#th of Suly, in  
conformity with a plan which seems to have  
been for some time, entertained, and which pro­  
bably wasoaly accellerated by the coming of the  
marshal into the survey, an attack by about otic  
hundred persons was made upon the house of  
the inspector in the vicinity of Pittsburgh. The  
inspector, though alone, vigorously defended  
himself against the ussailnuts, aun obliged them  
to retreat without accomplishing their purpose.  
“ Apprehending that the business would not  
terminate here, he made application by letter to  
the judges, generals of militia and sheriff of the  
eouuty for protection. A reply to his application,  
from John AVillmms, jon. auil John Gibson, ma­  
gistrates and militia otlieers, informing hita that  
the laws could not be executed so as to afford hiiu  
the protection to which he w as entitled, ow in2  
  
to tiie too general combination of the people iu  
tiiat part or Penusyfihmi.5 to ».ppr.»e the revenue  
law } adding, that they would take every step  
iu their power to bring the rioters to justice. And  
would be glad to receive information of the in­  
dividuals concerned in the attack upon his houses  
that prosecutions might be commenced against  
them, aud expressing their sorrow, that, should  
the fossa comitatus of the county be ordered  
out iu support of the civil authority, very few&#x27;  
could be gotten that were sot of the party of  
the rioters, k . . -  
“ The day following the insurgents re-assem­  
bled, with a considerable augmentation of num­  
bers, amounting, as has been computed, to at  
least five hundred, and on the 17th of July re­  
newed their attack upon‘Ike house of t he inspec­  
tor, who, in the interval, had taken the pre­  
caution of calling to his aid a small detachment  
from the garrison «£ Torf Pitt which at the time  
of the rttack consisted of,eleven men. who had  
b*?® j°ijted by major Abraham Kiiitpatriek, a  
frwin aud connection of the inspector.  
“ There being scarcely any prospect of effec­  
tual defence against so large a body as then ap­  
peared, arid as the inspector had every thing (»  
apprehend for hi­  
ed advisable that  
j^on, if tuken, it was judg­  
^should withdraw from the  
bouse to a plaeo-uf^eourtdiuenf, major Kirk­  
patrick generously agreeing to remain with the  
eleven men, in the intention if practicable, to  
toake a capitulation in favor of the property, if  
not to defeud it as long as possible^ &#x27; -i-&#x27;.  
** A parley took puce under cover of a flag  
which was sent by the insurgents to the house,  
to demand that the inspector should come forth,  
rendpnee his oOiee, and stipulate never to  
aeccpt an office under the same Ians. ■ Tothis  
it waaOuplied, that the inspector had loft the  
bouse Upon their first approach, and that the  
plaee to which he had retired was unknown. They  
then declared that they must have whatever re­  
lated to his office, ^They were answered, thit  
they might send person#,’hot exceeding 6, to  
search the hoose, and take away whatever pa.  
I**r* they eoald fiad appertaining** the office i  
but not satisfied with thin, they insisted, usnut­  
ditionally, that the armed men, who vfere in

* The preamble to the resolutions adopted at this meeting, suggest that a Tax  
on spirituous liquors is unjust in itself and oppressive upon the poor—that internal  
taxes upon consumption must, in the end, destroy the liberties of every country in  
which they are introduced—that the law in question, from certain local circum-  
stances which are specified, would bring immediate distress and ruin upon the  
Western country ; and concludes with the sentiment, that they think it their duty  
to persist in remonstrances to Congress, and in every other egal measure that  
may obstruct the operation of the law. The resolutions then proceed, first, to ap-  
point a committee to prepare and cause to be presented to Congress, an address,  
stating objections to the law, and praying for its repeal; secondly, to appoint com-  
mittees of correspondence for Washington, Fayette and Alleghany, charged to  
correspond together, and with such committee as should be appointed for the same  
purpose in the county of Westmoreland, or with any committees of a similar na-  
ture, that might be appointed in other parts of the United States ; and also, if found  
necessary, to call together either general meetings of the people in their respective  
counties, or conferences of the several committees ; and lastly, to declare that they  
will in future consider those who hold offices for the collection of the duty, as un-  
worthy of their friendship, that they will have no intercourse nor dealings with  
them, will withdraw from them every assistance, withold all the comforts of life  
which depend on those duties that as men and fellow citizens we owe to each  
other, and will upon all occasions treat them with contempt ; earnestly recom-  
mending it to the people at large to follow the same line of conduct towards them.

time, and of the conduct which has hitherto been observed on the part of  
the Government, its motives and effect, in order to a better judgment of  
the measures necessary to be pursued in the existing emergency.  
  
The opposition to those laws in the four most western counties of Penn-  
sylvania, (Allegheny, Washington, Fayette and Westmoreland,) com-  
menced as early as they were known to have been passed. It was con-  
tinued, with different degrees of violence, in the different counties, and at  
different periods ; but Washington has uniformly distinguished its resist-  
ance by a more excessive spirit than has appeared in the other counties,  
and seems to have been chiefly instrumental in kindling and keeping  
alive the flame.  
  
The opposition first manifested itself in the milder shape of the circu-  
lation of opinions unfavorable to the law, and calculated, by the influence  
of public disesteem, to discourage the accepting or holding’of offices under  
it, or the comp lying with it by those who might be dispx osed ; to which  
was added a show of the discontinuance of the business of distilling.  
  
These expedients were shortly after succeeded by private associations  
to forbear compliance with the law. But it was not long before these  
mere negative modes of opposition were perceived to be likely to prove  
ineffectual, And in proportion as this was the case, and as the means of  
introducing the laws into operation were put into execution, the disposi-  
tion to resistance became more turbulent, and more inclined to adopt and  
practise violent expedients ; the officers now began to experience marks  
of contempt and insult ; threats against them became more frequent and  
loud; and, after some time, these threats were ripened into acts of ill-  
treatment and outrage.  
  
These acts of violence were preceded by certain meetings of malcon-  
tent persons, who entered into resolutions calculated at once to confirm,  
inflame, and systematize the spirit of opposition.  
  
The first of these meetings was held at a place called Redstone (Old  
Fort) on the 27th of July, 1791, where it was concerted that county com-  
mittees should be convened in the four counties, at the respective seats of  
justice therein. On the 23d of August following one of these committees  
assembled in the county of Washington.  
  
This meeting passed some intemperate resolutions, which were after-  
wards printed in the Pittsburgh Gazette, containing a strong censure on  
the law, declaring that any person who had accepted or might aécept an  
office under Congress, in order to carry it into effect, should be consid-  
ered as inimical to the interests of the country ; and recommending to the  
citizens of Washington county to treat every person who had accepted,  
or might thereafter accept any such office, with contempt, and absolutely  
to refuse all kind of communication or intercourse with the officers, and  
withhold from them all aid, support, or comfort.  
  
Not content with this vindictive proscription of those who might esteem  
it their duty, in the capacity of officers, to aid in the execution of the

constitutional laws of the land, the meeting proceeded to accumulate to- |  
pics of crimination of the Government, though foreign to each other;  
authorizing by this zeal for censure a suspicion that they were actuated |  
not merely by the dislike of a particular law, but by a disposition to ren- |  
der the Government itself unpopular and odious.  
  
This meeting, in further prosecution of their plan, deputed three of i  
their members to meet delegates from the counties of Westmoreland, ||  
Fayette, and Allegheny, on the first Tuesday of September following, for |  
the purpose of expressing the sense of the people of those counties in an ||  
address to the Legislature of the United States upon the subject of the |  
excise law and other grievances.  
  
Another meeting accordingly took place on the 7th of September, 1791, |  
at Pittsburgh, in the county of Allegheny, at which there appeared three |  
persons in character of delegates from the four western counties.  
  
This meeting entered into resolutions more comprehensive in their ob-  
jects, and not less inflammatory in their tendency than those which had  
before passed the meeting in Washington. Their resolutions contained  
severe censures, not only on the law which was the immediate subject of  
objection, but upon what they termed the exorbitant salaries of officers ;  
the unreasonable interest of the public debt; the want of discrimination  
between origial holders and transferees, and the institution of a national  
bank. The same unfriendly temper towards the Government of the U.  
States, which seems to have led out of their way the meeting at Wash-  
ington, appears to have produced a similar wandering in that at Pitts- |  
burgh. |  
  
A representation to Congress, and a remonstrance to the Legislature of |  
Pennsylvania, against the law more particularly complained of, were pre- |  
pared by this meeting, published, together with their other proceedings, |  
in the Pittsburgh Gazette, and afterwards presented to the respective bo- |  
dies to whom they were addressed.  
  
These meetings, composed of very influential persons, and conducted |  
without moderation or prudence, are justly chargeable with the excesses  
which have been from time to time committed; serving to give consistency to |  
an opposition which has at length matured to a point that threatens the ||  
foundations of the Government and of the Union, unless speedily and ef- |  
fectually subdued.  
  
On the 6th of the same morth of September, the opposition broke out 1  
in an act of violence upon the person and property of Robert Johnson, |  
collector of the revenue for the counties of Allegheny and Washington. |  
A party of men, armed and disguised, waylaid him at a place on |  
| Pigeon Creek, in Washington county, seized, tarred and feathered him,  
cut off his hair, and deprived him of his horse, obliging him to travel on  
foot a considerable distance in that mortifying aud painful situation. |  
  
The case was brought before the District Court of Pennsylvania, out of |  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
which processes issued against John Robertson, John Hamilton, and  
Thamas McComb, three of the persons concerned in the outrage.  
  
The serving of these processes was confided by the then marshal, Cle-  
ment Biddle, to his deputy, Joseph Fox, who, in the month of October,  
went into Allegheny county for the purpose of serving them.  
  
The appearances and circumstances which Mr. Fox observed himself |  
in the course of his journey, and learned afterwards upon his arrival at  
Pittsburgh, had the effect of deterring him from the service of the pro-  
cess, and unfortunately led to adopt the injudicious and fruitless expe-  
dient of sending them to the parties by a private messenger, under cover.  
  
The deputy’s report to the marshal states a number of particulars,  
evincing a considerable fermentation in the part of the country to which  
he was sent, and inducing a belief, on his part, that he could not with  
safety have executed the processes. The marshal, transmitting this re-  
port to the district attorney, makes the following observations upon it:  
“I am sorry to add that he (the deputy) found the people, in general, in  
the western part of State, and particularly beyond the Allegheny moun-  
tains, in such a ferment on account of the act of Congress for laying a  
duty on distilled spirits, anc so much opposed to the execution of said ||  
act, from a variety of threats to himself personally, (although he took the  
utmost precaution to conceal his errand,) that he was not only convinced  
of the impossibility of serving the process, but that any attempt to effect  
it would have occasioned the most violent oppositien from the greater part |  
of the inhabitants ; and declares that, if he had attempted it, he believes ||  
he should not have returned alive.  
  
“I spared no expense nor pains to have the process of the court execu-  
ted, and have not the least doubt that-my deputy would have accom- |  
plished it, if it could have. been done.”  
  
The reality of the danger to the deputy was countenanced by the ||  
opinion of General Neville, the inspector of the revenue, a man who be- 1  
fore had given, and since has given, numerous proots of a steady and firm ||  
temper, and what followed is a further confirmation of it. ]  
  
|  
  
The person who had been sent with the processes was seized, whip- |  
ped, tarred and feathered; and, after having his money and horse taken |  
from him, was blindfolded and tied in the woods, in which condition he  
remained for five hours. i  
  
Very serious reflections naturally occurred upon this occasion. It |  
seemed highly probable, from the issue of the experiment which had  
been made, that the ordinary course of civil process would be ineffectual  
for enforcing the execution of the law in the scene in question, and that  
a perseverance in this course might lead to a serious concussion. The  
law itself was siill in the infancy of its operation, and far from established |  
in other important portions of the Union. Prejudices against it had been |  
industriously disseminated, misrepresentations diffused, misconceptions |  
fostered. The Legislature of the United States had not yet organized

|| the means by which the Executive could come in aid of the Judiciary,  
when found incompetent tothe execution of the laws. If neither of these  
|| impediments to a decisive exertion had existed, it was desirable, espe-  
|| cially in a republican government, to avoid what is in such cases the ul-  
timate resort, till all the milder means had been tried without success.  
  
Under the united influence of these considerations, it appeared advisd-  
|| ble to forbear urging coercive measures until the law had gone. into more  
|| extensive operation ; till further time for reflection and experience of its  
] operation had served to correct false impressions, and inspire greater  
|| moderation ; and till the Legislature had had an opportunity, by a revis-  
| ion of the law, to remove, as far as possible, objections, and to reinforce  
the provisions for securing its execution.  
| Other incidents occurred, from time to time, which are further proofs  
of the very improper temper that prevailed among the inhabitants of the  
refractory counties.  
|| Mr. Johnson was not the only officer wh», about the same period, ex-  
perienced outrage. Mr. Wells, collector of the revenue for Westmore-  
|| land and Fayette, was also ill-treated at Greensburg and Uniontown.  
|| Nor were the outrages perpetrated confined to the officers ; they extend-  
ed to private citizens, who only dared to show their respect for the laws  
| of their country.  
  
Some time in October, 1791, an unhappy man of the name of Wilson,  
a stranger in the county, and manifestly disordered in his intellect, ima-  
gining himself‘to be a collector of the revenue, or invested with some  
trust in relation to it, was so unlucky as to make inquiries concerning dis-  
tillers who kad entered their stills, giving out that he was to travel thro’  
  
the United States, to ascertain and report to Congress the number of |  
  
| stills, &amp;c. This man was pursued by a party in disguise; taken out of  
) his bed, carried about five miles back, to a smith-shop, stripped of his  
|| clothes, which were afterwards burnt, and having been himself inhu-  
(| manly burnt in several places with a heated iron, was tarred and feath-  
| ered, and about daylight dismissed, naked, wounded and otherwise in a  
|| very suffering condition. ‘These particulars are communicated in a letter  
| from the inspector of the revenue, of the 17th of November, who de-  
| clares that he had then himself seen the unfortunate maniac, the abuse of  
whom, as he expresses it, exceeded description, and was sufficient to  
| make human nature shudder. The affair is the more extraordinary, as  
|| persons of weight and consideration in that county are understood to have  
been actors in it, and as the symptoms of insanity were, during the  
whole time of inflicting the punishment, apparent; the unhappy sufferer  
| displayed the heroic fortitude of a man who conceived. himself to be a  
| martyr to the discharge of some important duty.  
  
Not long after, a person of the name of Roseberry underwent the hu-  
miliating punishment of tarring and feathering, with some aggravations,

for having in conversation hazarded the very natural and just, but unpal-  
atable remark, that the inhabitants of that county could not reasonably ex-  
pect protection from a Government they so strenuously opposed.  
  
The audacity of the perpetrators of these excesses was so great, that  
an armed banditti ventured to seize and carry off two persons who were  
witnesses against the rioters in the case of Wilson, in order to prevent  
their giving testimony of the riot to a court then sitting or about to sit.  
  
Designs of personal violence against the inspector of the revenue him- |  
self, to force him to a resignation, were repeatedly attempted to be putin |  
execution by armed parties, but, by different circumstances were frus-  
trated.  
  
In the session of Congress which commenced in October, 1791, the  
  
law laying a duty on distilled spirits and stills, came under the revision ||  
  
of Congress, as had been anticipated. By an act passed May 8th, 1792,  
during that session, material alterations were made in it; among these,  
the duty was reduced to a rate so moderate, as to have silenced complaint  
on that head ; and a new and very favorable alternative was given to the  
distiller—-that of paying a monthly instead of a yearly rate, according to  
the capacity of his still, with liberty to take a license for the precise  
term which he should intend to work it, and to renew that license for a  
further term or terms.  
  
This amending act, in its progress through the Legislature, engaged  
the particular attention of members, who themselves were interested in  
distilleries, and of others who represeated parts of the coynty in which |  
the business of distilling was extensively carried on.  
  
Objections were well considered, and great pains taken to obviate all  
such as had the semblance of reasonableness.  
  
The effect has, in a great measure, corresponded with the views of the  
Legislature. Opposition has subsided in several districts where it. be-  
fore prevailed, and it was natural to entertain, and not easy to abandon a  
hope, that the same thing would by degrees have taken place in the four  
western counties of this State.  
  
But notwithstanding some flattering appearances at particular junc-  
tures, and infinite pains, by various expedients, to produce the desirable  
issue, the hope entertained has never been realized, and is now at an end,  
as far as the ordinary means of executing laws are concerned.  
  
The first law had left the number and positions of the officers of in-  
spection, which were to be established in each district for receiving en-  
tries of stills, to the discretion of the supervisor. ‘The second, to secure  
a due accommodation to distillers, provides, peremptovily, that there shall  
be one in each county.  
  
The idea was immediately embraced that it was a very important point  
in the scheme of opposition to the law, to prevent the establishment of  
offices in the respective counties.

For this purpose, the intimidation of well-disposed inhabitants was  
added to the plan of molesting and obstructing the officers, by force or  
otherwise, as might be necessary. So effectually was the first point car-  
ried, (the certain destruction of property and the peril of life being invol-  
ved,) that it became almost impracticable to obtain suitable places for  
offices in some of the counties ; and, when obtained, it was found a mat-  
ter of necessity, in almost every instance, to abandon thei,  
  
After much effort, the inspector of revenue succeeded in procuring the  
house of William Faulkner, a captain in the army, for an office of in-  
spection in the county of Washington. This took place in August, 1792.  
The office was attended by the inspector of the revenue in person, till  
prevented by the following incidents:  
  
Captain Faulkner, being in pursuit of some deserters from the troops,  
was encountered by a number of persons in the same neighborhood  
where Mr. Johnson had been ill-treated the preceding year, who re-  
proached him with letting his house for an office of inspection, drew a  
knife upon him, threatened to scalp him, tar and feather him, and reduce  
his house and property to ashes, if he did not solemnly promise to prevent  
the further use of his house for an office. Capt. Faulkner was indueed  
to make the promise exacted ; and, in consequence of the circumstance,  
wrote a letter to the inspector, dated the 20th of August, countermanding  
the permission for using his house; and the day following gave a public  
notice in the Pittsburgh Gazette that the office of inspector should no  
longer be kept there.  
  
At the same time another engine of opposition was in operation.—  
Agreeable to a previous notification, there met at Pittsburgh, on the 21st  
of August, a number of persons, styling themselves “A meeting of sun-  
dry inhabitants of the western counties of Pennsylvania.”  
  
This meeting entered into resolutions not less exceptionable than those  
of its predecessors. The preamble suggests that a a tax on spiritous  
liquors is unjust in itself, and oppressive upon the poor; that internal  
taxes upon consumption must, in the end, destroy the liberties of every  
country in which they are introduced; that the Jaw in question, from  
certain local circumstances, which are specified, would bring immediate  
distress and ruin upon the western country ; and concludes with the sen-  
timent that they think it their duty to persist if remonstrances to Con-  
gress, and in every other /egal measure that may obstruct the operation  
of the law.  
  
The resolutions then proceeded, first, to appoint a committee to pre-  
pare and cause to be presented to Congress an address, stating objections  
to the law, and praying for its repeal ; second, to appoint a committee of  
correspondence for Washington, Fayette, and Allegheny, charged to cor-  
respond together, and with such committees as should be appointed for  
the same purpose in the county of Westmoreland, or with any committee  
of a similar nature that might be appointed in other parts of the United

States ; and also, if found necessary, to call together either general meet-  
ings of the people in their respective counties, or conferences of the sev-  
eral committees; and, lastly, to declare that they will in future consider  
those who hold offices for the collection of the duty as unworthy of their  
friendship; that they will have no intercourse nor dealing with them,  
will withdraw from them every assistance, withhold all the comforts of  
life which depend upon those duties that as men and fellow citizens we  
owe to each other, and will upon all occasions treat thein with contempt ;  
earnestly recommending it to the, people at large to follow the same line  
of conduct towards them.  
  
The idea of pursuing legal measures to obstruct the operation of a law  
needs little comment. Legal measures may be pursued to procure the  
repeal of a law, but to obstruct its operation preseuts a contradiction in  
terms. The operation, (or, what is the same thing, the execution) of a  
law cannot be obstructed after it has been constitutionally enacted, with-  
out illegality and crime. The expression quoted is one of those phrases  
which can only be used to conceal a disorderly and culpable intention  
under forms that may escape the hold of the law.  
  
Neither was it difficult to perceive that the anathema pronounced  
against the officers of the revenue placed them in a state of virtual out-  
lawry, and operated as a signal to all those who were bold enough to en-  
counter the guilt, and the danger to violate both their lives and their  
property.  
  
The foregoing proceedings, as soon as known, were reported by the  
Secretary of the Treasury to the President. ‘The President, on the 15th  
of September, 1792, issued a proclamation “earnestly exhorting and ad

‘Pursuant to these instructions, the Attorney General, in co-operation  
with the Attorney of the district, attended a circuit court, which was

peared least disinclined to come voluntarily into the law, by arguments  
addressed to their sense of duty, and exhibiting the eventual dangers and  
mischiefs of resistance.  
  
The mission of the supervisor had no other fruit than that of obtaining  
evidence of the persons who composed the meeting at Pittsburgh, and of  
two who were understood to be concerned in the riot; and the confirma-  
tion of the enmity which certain active and designing leaders had indus-  
triously infused into a large proportion of the inhabitants, not against the  
particular laws in question only, but of a more ancient date, against the  
Government of the United States itself.  
  
The then Attorney General being of opinion that it was at best a doubt-  
ful point, whether the proceedings of the meeting at Pittsburgh contained  
indictable matter, no prosecution was attempted against those who com-  
posed it; though, if the ground for proceeding against them had appear-  
ed to be firm, it is presumed that the truest policy would have dictated  
| that course.  
  
Indictments were preferred to the circuit court, and found against the  
two persons understood to have been concerned in the riot, and the usual  
measures were taken for having them carried into effect.  
  
But it appeared afterwards, from various representations, supported by  
satisfactory testimony, that there had been some mistake as to the persons  
accused, justice and policy demanded that the prosecution

the influence of penalties on delinquents, at making it the general interest  
of the distillers to comply with the laws, by interrupting the market for a  
very considerable surplus, and by at the same time confining the benefit  
of the large demand for publit service to those who did their duty to the  
public ; and furnishing, through the means of payment in cash, that me-  
dium for paying the duties, the want of which was alleged to be a great  
difficulty in the way of compliance.  
  
But two circumstances conspired to counteract the success of the plan ;  
one, the necessity, towards incurring the penalties of non-compliance, of  
there being an office of inspection in each county, which was prevented  
in some of the counties by means of the intimidation practised for that  
purpose ; another, the non-extension of that law to the territory north-  
west of the Ohio, into which a large proportion of the surplus before  
mentioned was sent. *  
  
A cure for these defects could only come from the Legislature ; accor-  
dingly, in the session which began in November, 1792, measures were  
taken for procuring a further revision of the laws. A bill containing  
amendments of those and other defects was brought in; but it so happen-  
ed that this object, by reason of more urgent business, was deferred till  
the close of the session, and finally went off, through the usual hurry of  
that period. ,  
  
The continuance of the embarrassment incident to this state of things  
naturally tended to diminish much of the efficacy of the plan which had  
been devised ; yet it was resolved, as far as legal provisions would bear  
out the officers, to pursue it with perseverance. There was ground to  
entertain hopes of its good effect, and it was certainly the most likely  
course which could have been adopted towards attaining the object of the  
laws by means short of force ; evincing, unequivocally, the sincere dis-  
position to avoid this painful resort, and the steady moderation, which  
has characterized the measures of the Government.  
  
In pursuance of this plan, prosecutions were occasionally instituted in  
the mildest forms; seizures were made, as opportunities occurred, and  
purchases on public account were carried on.  
  
It may be incidentally remarked, that these purchases were extended  
to other places, where, though the same disorders did not exist, it ap-  
peared advisable to facilitate the payment of the duties by this species of  
accommodation. Nor was, this plan, notwithstanding the deficiency of  
legal provision, which impeded its full execution, without corresponding  
effects.  
  
Symptoms from time to time appeared, which authorized expectation  
that, with the aid, at another session, of the desired supplementary pro-  
visions, it was capable of accomplishing its end, if no extraordinary  
events occurred. 2  
  
The opponents of the laws, not insensible of the tendency of that  
plan, nor of the defects of the laws which interfered with it, did not fail,

from time t&gt; time, to pursue analogous modes of counteraction. The  
effort to frustrate the establishment of officers of inspection in particular,  
was persisted in, and even increased ; means of intimidating officers and  
others continued to be exerted.  
  
In April, 1793, a party of armed men in disguise, made an attack in  
the night upon the house of a collector of the revenue, who resided in  
Fayette county, but he happening to be from home, they contented them-  
selves with breaking open his house, threatening, terrifying, and abusing  
his family.  
  
Warrants were issued for apprehending some of the rioters upon  
this oecasion by Isaac Mason and John Findley, assistant Judges of Fay-  
ette county, which were delivered to the Sheriff of that county, who, it  
seems, refused to execute them; for which he has been since indicted.  
  
This is at once an example of a disposition to support the laws of the  
Union, and of an opposite one in the local officers of Pennsylvania within  
the non-complying scene.  
  
But it is a truth too important not to be noticed, and too injurious not  
to be lamented, that the prevailing spirit of those officers has been either  
hostile or lukewarm to the execution of those laws; and that the weight  
of an unfriendly official influence has been one of the most serious obsta-  
cles with which they have had to struggle.  
  
In June following, the inspector of the revenue was burnt in effigy in  
Allegheny county, at a place and ona day of some public election, with  
much display, in the presence of, and without interruption from, magis-  
trates and other public officers.  
  
On the night of the 22d of November, another party of men, some of  
them armed, and all iz disguise, went to the house of the same collector  
of Fayette, which had been visited in April, broke and entered it, and de-  
manded a surrender of the officer’s commission and official books ; upon  
his refusal to deliver them up, they presented pistols at him, and swore  
that if he did not comply they would instantly put him to death. At  
length a surrender of the commission and books was enforced ; but, not  
content with this, the rioters, before they departed, required of the officer  
that he should, within two weeks, publish his resignation, on pain of an-  
other visit, and the destruction of his house.  
  
Notwithstanding these excesses, the laws appeared, during the latter  
period of this year, (1793) to be rather gaining ground. Several princi-  
pal distillers, who had formerly held out, complied ; and others discov-  
ered a disposition to comply, which was only restrained by the fear of  
violence.  
  
But these favorable circumstances served to beget alarm among those  
who were determined, at all events to prevent the quiet establishment of  
the laws. It soon appeared that they meditated, by fresh and greater ex-  
cesses, to aim a still more effectual blow at them, to subdue the growing  
spirit of compliance, and to destroy entirely the organsof the laws within

that part of the country, by compelling all the officers to renounce their  
offices.  
  
The last proceeding, in the case of the collector of Fayette, was in this  
spirit. In January of the present year, further violences appear to have  
been perpetrated. William Richmond, who had given information  
against some of the rioters, in the affair of Wilson, had his barn burnt,  
with all the grain and hay which it contained ; and the same thing hap-  
  
pened to Robert Shawhan, a distiller, who had been among the first to |  
  
comply with the law, and who had always spoken favorably of it; but in  
neither of these instances, (which happened in the county of Allegheny)  
though the presumptions were violent, was any positive proof obtained.  
The inspector of the revenue, ina letter of the 27th of Feb., writes that  
he had received information that persons living near the dividing line of  
Allegheny and Washington, had thrown out threats of tarring and feath-  
ering one William Cochran, a complying distiller, and of burning his  
distillery ; and that it had also been given out that in three weeks there  
would not be a house left standing in Allegheny county of any person  
who had complied with the laws ; in consequence of which, he had been  
induced to pay a visit to several leading individuals in that quarter, as  
well to ascertain the truth of the information as to endeavor to avert the  
attempt to execute such threats.  
  
It appeared afterwards, that, on his return home, he had been pursued  
by a collection of disorderly persons, threatening, as they went along,  
vengeance against him. On their way, these men called at the house of  
James Kiddoe, who had recently complied with the laws, broke into his  
still-house, fired several balls under his still, and scattered fire over and  
about the house.  
  
Letters from the inspector’ in-March, announce an increased activity in  
promoting opposition to the laws ; frequent meetings to cement and .ex-  
tend the combinations against them; and, among other means for this  
purpose, a plan of collecting a force to seize him, compel him to resign  
his commission, and detain him prisoner, probably as a hostage.  
  
In May and June, new violences were committed. James Kiddoe, the  
person above mentioned, and William Cochran, another complying distil-  
ler, met with repeated injury to their property. Kiddoe had parts of his  
grist mill at different times carried away, and Cochran suffered more ma-  
terial injuries. His still was destroyed ; his saw mill was rendered use-  
less, by the taking away of the saw; and his grist mill so injured as to  
require to be repaited at considerable expense.  
  
At the last visit a note in writing was left, requiring him to publish  
what he had suffered in the Pittsburgh Gazette, on pain of another visit,  
in which he is threatened, in figurative but intelligible terms, with the  
destruction of his property by fire. Thus adding to the profligacy of  
doing ‘wanton injuries to a fellow citizen the tyranny of compelling him  
to be &#x27;the publisher of his wrongs.

June being the month for receiving annual entries of stills, endeavors  
were used to open offices in Westmoreland and Washington, where it  
had been hitherto found impractical: with much pains and difficulty,  
places were procured for the purpose. That in Westmoreland was re-  
peatedly attacked in the night by armed men, who frequently fired upon  
it; but, according to a report which has been made to this Department, it  
was defended with so much courage and perseverance by John Wells, an  
auxiliary officer, and Philip Ragan, the owner of the house, as to have  
been maintained during the remainder of the month.  
  
That in Washington, after repeated attempts, was suppressed. The  
first attempt was confined to pulling down the sign of the office, and  
threats of future destruction; the second effected the object in the follow-  
ing mode: About twelve persons, armed and painted black, in the night  
of the 6th of June, broke into the hguse of John Lynn, where the office was  
kept, and, after having treacherously seduced him to come down stairs,  
and put himself in their power, by a promise of safety to himself and  
house, they seized and tied him, threatened to hang him, took him to a  
retired spot in the neighboring wood, and there, after cutting off his hair,  
tarring and feathering him, swore him never again to allow the use of his  
house for an office, never to disclose their names, and never again to have  
any sort of agency in aid of excise ; having done which, théy bound him  
naked to a tree, and left him in that situation till morning, when he suc-  
ceeded in extricating himself. Not content with this, the malcontents,  
some days after, made him another visit, pulled down part of his house,  
and put him in a situation to be obliged to become an exile from his own  
home, and to find an asylum elsewhere.  
  
During this time several of the distillers, who had made entries and  
benefitted by them, refused the payment of the duties; actuated, no  
doubt, by various motives.  
  
Indications of a plan to proceed against the inspector of the revenue,  
in the manner which has been before mentioned, continued. In a letter  
fiom him of the 10th of July, he observed that the threatened visit had  
not yet been made, though he had still reason to expect it.  
  
In the session of Congress which began in December, 1793, a bill\ for  
making the amendments in the laws, which had been for some time de-  
sired, was brought in, and on the 5th of June last became a law.  
  
It is not to be doubted that the different stages of this business were  
regularly notified to the malcontents, and that a conviction of the tenden-  
cy of the amendments contemplated to effectuate the execution of the  
law had matured the resolution to bring matters to a violent crisis.  
  
The increasing energy of the opposition rendered it indispensable to  
meet the evil with proportional decision. The idea of giving time for  
the law to extend itself, in scenes where the dissatisfaction with it was  
the effect, not of an improper spirit, but of causes which were of a nature  
to yield to reason, reflection and experience, (which had constantly

weighed in the estimate of the measures proper to be pursued,) had had  
its effect, in an extensive degree. The experiment too had been long  
enough tried to ascertain that, where resistance continued, the root of the  
evil lay deep, and required measures of greater efficacy than had been  
pursued. The laws had undergone repeated revisions of the legislative  
representatives of the Union, and had virtually received their repeated  
sanction, without even an attempt, as far as now recollected or can be  
traced, to effect their repeal, affording an evidence of the general sense  
of the community in their favor. Complaints began to be loud from com-  
plying quarters, against the impropriety and injustice of suffering the  
laws to remain unexecuted in others.  
  
Under the united influence of these considerations, there was no choice  
but to try the efficiency of the laws in prosecuting with vigor delinquents  
and offenders. .  
  
Process issued against a number of non-complying distillers in the  
counties of Fayette and Allegheny ; and indictments having been found  
at a circuit court holden in Philadelphia, in July last, against Robert  
Smilie and John McCullough, two of the rioters in the attack which, in  
November preceding, had been made upon the house of a collector of the  
revenue in Fayette county, processes issued against them also, to bring  
them to trial,‘and, if guilty, to punishment.  
  
The marshal of the district went in person to serve these processes.  
He executed his trust without interruption, though under many discour-  
aging circumstances, in Fayette county ; but while he was in the execu-  
tion of it in Allegheny county, being then accompanied by the inspector  
of the revenue, to wit, on the 15th of July last, he was beset on the road  
by a party of from thirty to forty armed men, who, after much previous  
irregularity of conduct, finally fired upon him, but, as it happened, with-  
out injury either to him or to the inspector.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
About break of day, the 16th of July, in conformity witha plan which  
seems to have been for some time entertained, and which probably was  
only accellerated by the coming of the marshal into the survey, an attack  
; by about one hundred persons, armed with guns and other weapons, was  
made upon the house of the inspector, in the vicinity of Pittsburgh.—  
The inspector, though alone, vigorously defended himself against the as-  
sailants, and obliged them to retreat without accomplishing their purpose.  
  
Apprehending that the business would not terminate here, he made  
application by letter to the judges, general of militia, and sheriff of the  
county for protection. A reply to this application, from John Wilkins, Jr.,  
and John Gibson, magistrate and militid officer, mformed him that the  
laws could not be executed, so as to afford him the protection to which  
he was entitled, owing to the too general combination of the people in that  
y part of Pennsylvania to oppose the revenue law ; adding that they would  
take every step in their power to bring the rioters to justice, and would

be glad.to receive information of the individuals concerned in the attack  
|| upon his house, that prosecutions might be commenced against them ;  
&#x27;|_and expressing their sorrow that should the posse comitatus of the county }}  
be ordered out in support of the civil authority, very few could be gotten  
  
  
  
that were not of the party of the rioters. |  
  
The day following the insurgents reassembled, with a considerable ||  
augmentation of numbers, amounting,,as has been computed, to at least  
|. five hundred; and on the 17th of July, renewed their attack upon the  
  
house of the inspector, who in the interval, had taken the precaution of  
calling to his aid a small detachment from the garrison of Fort Fayette,  
which, at the time of the attack, consisted of 11 men, who had been joined  
by Major Abraham Kirkpatrick, a friend and connexion of the inspector.  
  
There being scarcely a prospect of effectual defence against so large a  
body as then appeared, and as the inspector had every thing tg. appre-  
hend for his person, if taken, it was judged advisable that he should  
withdraw from the house to a place of concealment; Major Kirkpatrick  
generously agreeing to remain with the eleven men, in the intention, if  
practicable, to make a capitulation in favor of the property ; if not, to de-  
fend it as long as possible.  
  
A parley took place under cover of a flag, which was sent by the in-  
surgents to the house to demand that the inspector should come foith,  
renounce his office, and stipulate never again to accept an office under |  
the same laws. ‘To this it was replied that the inspector had left the  
house upon their first approach, and that the place to which he had re- |  
tired was unknown. They then declared that they must have whatever |  
related to his office. They were answered that they might send persons, |  
not exceeding six, to search the house, and take away whatever papers |  
they could find appertaining to the office. But, not satisfied with this, |

they insisted, unconditionally, thdt the armed men who were in the house  
for its defence should march out and ground their arms, which Major  
Kirkpatrick peremptorily refused; considering it and representing it to  
them asa proof of a design to destroy the property. This refusal put an  
end to the parley.  
  
A brisk firing then ensued between the insurgents and those in the  
house, which, is is said, lasted for near an hour, till the assailants, hav-  
ing set fire to the neighboring and adjacent buildings, eight in number,  
the intenseness of the heat, and the danger of an immediate ecommunica- ||  
tion of the fire to the house, obliged Major Kirkpatrlgk and his small ||  
party to come out and surrender themselves. In the course of the firing ||  
one of the insurgents was killed and several wounded, and three of the |  
persons in the house were also wounded. ‘The person killed is unde  
stood to have been the leader of the party, of the name gf James Ma  
| farlane, then a major in the militia, formerly a lieutenant in the Penn  
sylvania line. The dwelling house, after the surrender, shared the, fate  
  
of the other buildings, the whole of whicn were consumed to the ground. |

562 ‘THE OLDEN TIME.  
The loss of property to the inspector, upon the oceasion, is estimated,  
and as it is believed, with great moderation, at not less than three thous-  
and pounds.  
  
The marshal, Col. Pressley Neville, and several others, were taken  
by the insurgents going to the inspector’s house. All, except the mar-  
shal and Colonel Neville, soon made their escape ; but these were carried  
off some distance from the place where the affray had happened, ‘and de-  
  
|| tained till one or two o’clock the next morning. In the course of their  
  
| detention, the marshal in particular suffered very severe and humiliating  
treatment, and was frequently in imminent danger of his life. Several  
of the party repeatedly presented their pieces at him with every appear-  
| ance of a design to assassinate, from which they were with difficulty re-  
strained by the efforts of a few more humane and prudent.  
  
Nor-could he obtain safety or liberty, but upon the condition of a pro-  
mise, guarantied by Colonel Neville, that he would serve no other pro-  
cess on the west side of the Allegheny mountain. The alternative being  
immediate death, extorted from the marshal a compliance with this con-  
dition, notwithstanding the just sense of official dignity, and the firmness |  
of character which was witnessed by his conduct throughout the trying  
scenes he had experienced.  
  
The insurgents, on the 18th, sent a deputation of two of their number  
(one a justice of the peace) to Pittsburgh, to require of the marshal a  
surrender of the processes in his possession, intimating that his compli-  
ance would satisfy the people, and add to his safety; and also, to demand  
of General Neville, in peremptory terms, the resignation of his office ;  
threatening, in case of refusal; to attack the place and take him by force:  
demands which both these officeys did not hesitate to reject, as alike in-  
compatible with their honor and their duty.  
  
As it was well ascertained that no protection was to be expected from  
the magistrates or inhabitants of Pittsburgh, it became necessary to the  
safety, both of the inspector and the marshal, to quit that place; and as  
it was known that all the usual routes to Philadelphia were beset by the  
insurgenfs, they concluded to descend the Ohio, and proceed by a circui-  
| tous route to the seat of government, which they began to put in execu-  
tion on the night of the 19th of July.  
|| Information has also been received of a meeting of a considerable  
  
number of persons at a place called Mingo Creek Meeting House, in the  
|| county of Washington, to consult upon the further measures which it  
|| might be advisable to pursue; that, at this meeting, a motion was made  
|| to approve and agree to support the proceedings which had taken place,  
until the excise law was repealed, and an act of oblivion passed. But  
that, instead of this, it had been agreed that the four western counties of  
Pennsylvania, and the neighboring counties of Virginia, should be invited  
‘to meet in a convention of delegates, on the 14th of the present month, at  
’ Parkinson’s, on Mingo Creek, in the county of Washington, to take into  
  
  
  
A  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
consideration the situation of the western country, and concert such mea-  
sures as should appear suited to the occasion.  
  
It appears, moreover, that on the 25th of July last, the mail of the U.  
States, on the road from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, was stopped by two  
armed men, who cut it open, and tock out all the letters, except those  
contained in one packet ; these armed men, from all the circumstances  
which occurred, were manifestly acting on the part of the insurgents.  
  
The declared object of the foregoing proceedings is to obstruct the ex-  
ecution and compel a repeal of the law Jaying duties on spirits distilled  
within the United States, and upon stills. There is just cause to believe  
that this is connected with an indisposition, too general in that quarter, to  
share in the common burdens of the community, and with a wish, among  
some persons of influence, to embarrass the Government. It is affirmed  
by well informed persons to be a fact of notoriety, that the revenue laws  
ot the State itself have always been either resisted or very defectively  
complied with in the same quarter.
