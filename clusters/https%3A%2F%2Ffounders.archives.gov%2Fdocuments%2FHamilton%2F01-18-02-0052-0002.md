 to the Senate on January 21, 1795]  
[To the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate]  
The Secretary of the Treasury respectfully makes the following report to the House of Representatives  
  
The President of the United States, with that provident concern for the public welfare which characterises all his conduct, was pleased in his speech to the two Houses of Congress, at the opening of the present session, to invite their attention to the adoption of a definitive plan for the Redemption of the public debt, and to the Consummation of whatsoever may remain unfinished of our System of Public Credit, in order to place that credit as far as may be practicable on grounds which cannot be disturbed, and to prevent that progressive accumulation of Debt which must ultimately endanger all Government.  
It was at the same time very justly intimated, that the period which has elapsed since the commencement of our Fiscal Measures (now more than four years) has so far developed our resources as to open the way to the important work: And it is matter of solid Consolation that the result, presenting a State of our finances prosperous beyond expectation, solicits the public councils to enter with zeal and decision upon measures commensurate with the greatness of the Interests to be promoted.  
Under the influence of this conviction, in conformity with the suggestions of the President, and pursuant to the duty which the Constitution of the Department, as by Law established, enjoins upon the Secretary of the Treasury; He has employed himself in digesting and preparing the materials of a Plan for the attainment of the invaluable ends which are recommended; And he now respectfully submits them to the consideration of Congress.  
Towards a clear and distinct conception of the means necessary to the accomplishment of those ends, it will be useful in the first place to review what has been heretofore done.  
This will be presented under three heads—  
1st.   The revenues which have been established:  
2ndly   The Provisions for funding the Debt and for the payment of interest upon it:  
3rdly   The provisions for reimbursing and extinguishing the Debt.  
The Revenues which have been established appear in the following Acts.  
1rst   “An Act for laying a duty on goods, wares and Merchandizes imported into the United States,” passed June the first 1789. This Act, as its title imports, lays various specific and advalorem rates on all articles (with exception of a few, useful to Agriculture and Manufactures) imported from foreign Countries. The lowest advalorem rate is five ⅌ Cent, with a discount of 10 ⅌ Cent in favor of our own bottoms. The duration assigned these duties was the end of the session of Congress next succeeding the first day of June 1796.  
2nd   “An Act imposing duties on Tonnage” passed the 20th. July 1789.  
This Act lays various rates of duty on the Tonnage of Ships and Vessels entered in the United States from foreign Countries, and in certain cases in one part of the United States from another.  
Its duration was indefinite, no limit having been assigned.  
3rd   “An Act imposing duties on the Tonnage of Ships and Vessels” passed July 20th 1790.  
This Act is a substitute for the one last mentioned, preserving the same rates of duty, but applying them in some instances differently.  
It is like the former of indefinite duration.  
4th   “An Act making further provision for the payment of the Debts of the United States” passed August 10th 1790.  
This Act repeals after the last of december 1790 the duties on imported Articles laid by the Act above cited, and substitutes new and generally increased rates—Specific and Advalorem.  
The lowest advalorem rate in this as in the former Act is five ⅌ Ct.; but the number of Articles to which it applies is much narrowed, and instead of a discount in favor of our own bottoms an Addition of 10 ⅌ Ct. is made to the disadvantage of foreign bottoms.  
The number of free Articles is somewhat extended, in further encouragement of Agriculture &amp; manufactures.  
It is declared that the duties laid by this Act shall continue till the debts and purposes for which they are appropriated shall be satisfied; reserving however a right to Congress to substitute other duties or taxes of equal Value.  
  
5th.   “An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States” passed the 25th of February 1791.  
The 2d Section of this act authorises the President to cause a Subscription to be made to the Stock of the Bank on account of the United States to the amount of 2,000,000 of dollars, and with a view to the accomplishment of that object to borrow of the Bank 2,000,000 of dollars, to be reimbursed in ten equal yearly instalments.  
The difference between the interest payable on the loan &amp; the dividends on the Stock constitutes an item of an[n]ual income to the United States. It is unappropriated.  
6th.   “An Act repealing after the last day of June next the duties heretofore laid upon Distilled Spirits imported from abroad &amp; laying others in their stead, and also upon Spirits distilled within the United States &amp; for appropriating the same” passed the 3d of March 1791.  
This Act, in conformity with its title, repeals after June 1791, the duties on imported Spirits laid by the Act of the 10th of Augt. 1790, and establishes in lieu of them higher rates, namely from twenty to 40 Cents ⅌ Gallon according to Proof. It also lays duties to commence at the same time upon Spirits distilled within the United States, namely, on those from foreign materials from 11 to 30 Cents according to Proof, on those from domestic materials, if distilled in Cities, Towns or Vil[l]ages, from nine to 25 Cents ⅌ Gallon according to proof; if distilled in other places it imposes a yearly rate of 60 Cents ⅌ Gallon of the capacity of each Still, with an option to the distiller to keep and render an account of the produce of his Still, and to pay nine Cents ⅌ Gallon of the Quantity of the Spirits distilled therein.  
These duties are appropriated primarily in the same manner and to the Same purposes as those laid on imported Articles by the Act of the 10th of August 1790, and are to continue for the same time; with the like reservation of right to substitute other duties or Taxes of equal value.  
There is a further appropriation which will be noticed hereafter. 7th “An Act for raising a further sum of Money for the protection of the Frontiers &amp; for other purposes therein mentioned” passed May 2nd 1792.  
  
This Act repeals after June 1792, the former duties on a number of imported articles, and established higher duties in their stead.  
It extends, among other things, the duties on foreign distilled Spirits; laying on those made from Grain 28 to 50 Cents ⅌ Gallon, on others 25 to 46 Cents ⅌ Gallon.  
The appropriation and duration of these new duties are conformable and coextensive with those repealed.  
There is likewise an addition of 2½ ⅌ Cent on that class of duties advalorem, which before was rated at 5 ⅌ Ct., but this additional duty is limited to the term of two Years.  
Out of the surplus of these duties after satisfying the permanent appropriations, certain gross sums are appropriated for the Service of the War department.  
8th   “An Act concerning the duties on Spirits distilled within the United States” passed May 8th 1792.  
This Act repeals after the last day of June 1792 the former duties on Spirits distilled within the United States and on Stills, and instead of them establishes lower duties; namely, on those made of Foreign materials from 10 to 25 Cents ⅌ Gallon according to proof, on those made of domestic materials, if in Cities, Towns, or Villages or at distilleries where the Stills singly or together are of the capacity of 400 Galls. or upwards, from 7 to 18 Cents ⅌ Gallon of the Spirits distilled according to proof, if made in other places, or at distilleries where the Stills are of inferior Capacity, the yearly rate of 54 Cents ⅌ Gallon of the Cappacity of each Still. A new option is given to the distiller, which is instead of paying the yearly rate to take out licenses for the monthly employment of his Stills, paying each time 10 Cents ⅌ Gallon of the capacity of each Still.  
These new duties are appropriated in the same manner and to the same purposes, and are to continue for the Same time as those for which they are substitutes; and to make good any deficiency which may accrue from lowering the rates, the surplus of the duties imposed by the act of the Second of the same Month is appropriated. 9th “An Act to promote the progress of useful arts, and to repeal the Act heretofore made for that purpose” passed February 21st 1793.  
  
This Act ordains certain fees to be paid by persons to whom patents are granted for inventions, discoverys, or improvements, and appropriates them to the purpose of defraying Clerk hire in the Department of State. Its duration is indefinite.  
9th “An Act to establish the Post Office and Post Roads within the United States” passed May 8th 1794.  
This Act establishes, to commence on the first of June following, various rates of postage on letters, and directs that the post Master shall render to the Treasury Department a quarterly Account of Receipts and Expenditures, and shall pay quarterly into the Treasury the balance in his hands.  
The duration of this act is also indefinite. It contains no appropriation of the sums paid into the Treasury.  
10th   “An Act laying Duties upon Carriages for the conveyance of persons” passed the 5th of June 1794.  
This act lays different rates of duty from ten dollars to one dollar upon Carriages for the conveyance of persons kept by or for any person for his or her own use, or to be let to hire, or for the conveying of passengers; and to guard against misapprehension declares, that the duties shall not be construed to extend to any carriage usually and chiefly employed in husbandry, or for the transporting or carrying of goods, wares, merchandize, produce or commodities. The duration of the duties is limitted to the end of the session of Congress which shall be next after the term of two years from the time of passing the Act. It contains no appropriation.  
11th   “An Act laying duties on licences for selling wines and foreign distilled spirituous Liquors by Retail” passed June 5th 1794.  
This Act requires that every retail dealer in wines shall take out a yearly Licence and shall pay for it a duty of five dollars; and that every retail Dealer in foreign distilled Spirituous liquors shall also take out a yearly licence and pay for it a Duty of 5 Dollars. It defines a Retail dealer in wines to be a person, who deals in the selling of wines to be carried or sent out of the House, building or place of his or her dwelling, in less quantities at one time than 30 Gallons, except in the original Cask, case, box, or package, in which it is imported—a Retail dealer of Spirituous Liquors to be a person who shall deal in the selling of foreign distilled Spirituous Liquors, to be carried or sent out of the House, building or place of his or her dwelling in less quantities, than twenty gallons at one time. No difference is made between the dealer of several kinds of wines; or several kinds of foreign distilled Liquors, and the dealer in one Kind.  
The same duration is assigned to this Act as to the one last cited. It is equally without an appropriation.  
12th.   “An Act laying certain Duties upon Snuff and refined Sugar” passed June 5th 1794.  
This Act lays a duty of 8 Cents ⅌ pound on all Snuff, which after the 30th of September 1794 should be Manufactured within the United States, and of two Cents per pound on all Sugar, which after that day should be refined, within the United States. (The remark made upon the two last recited Acts is applicable to this as to the duration of the duties and the appropriation of their proceeds.)  
13th   “An Act laying additional duties on Goods Wares and Merchandize imported into the United States” passed June 7th 1794.  
This Act lays upon sundry enumerated articles, on their importation from foreign Countries, certain Specific and advalorem rates of duty in addition to those before charged upon them, and adds generally a duty of 2½ ⅌ Centum on all that class of articles which were before chargeable with 7½ ⅌ Centum advalorem. It also prolongs the temporary 2½ ⅌ Ct. laid by the Act of May 2nd 1792, ’till the first of January 1794; to which period the other duties laid by it are to continue. It contains no appropriation.  
14th.   “An Act laying duties on property sold at Auction” passed June 9th 1794.  
This Act lays a duty on Sales at Auction by persons licensed according to the Laws of a State or this Act (prohibiting others from selling at auction) of ¼ ⅌ Cent of the purchase money arising from the sale of any right, interest, or estate, in Lands tenements or heredetaments, utensils of husbandry, farming Stock or Ships and Vessels, of ½ ⅌ Cent of the purchase Money arising from the sales of any other goods, chattells rights or Credits.  
The term of these duties is limitted to the end of the session next after the expiration of two years from the time of passing the act—which also is without an appropriation.  
But by an Act entitled “An Act making appropriations for certain purposes therein expressed” passed the same 9th. of June 1794 certain specific sums, amounting together to 1.292.137 dollars &amp; 38 Cents, are charged upon the proceeds of the Revenues which are created by the five last mentioned Acts, and there is a reservation made out of them of a sum sufficient to pay the interest of whatever Moneys may be borrowed pursuant to the act entitled “an act making further provision for the expenses attending the intercourse of the United States with foreign Nations &amp;c,” passed the 20th. of March 1794, which sum is pledged for the payment of that Interest.  
These Acts comprehend all the current revenues of the United States: their product will appear hereafter.  
In addition to them a fund will be derived from the sale of the Public Lands in the Western Territory. And there likewise occur from time to time payments into the Treasury on account of Old debts, but these are too casual and of too little magnitude to be more than cursorily mentioned.  
The lands in the Western Territory, of which the Government of the United States has acquired the right of soil, are estimated in a report of the late Secretary of State to Amount to 21.000 000 of Acres. This quantity at twenty cents per acre, the price upon former occasions contemplated, would yield a sum of 4.200.000 dols. But it is believed that it would be unsafe to count upon so large a sum.  
Besides the uncertainty, as to the proportion which may be of a saleable quality, and as to the price which may be obtained for it; the boundary line between the United States &amp; the Indians is understood to be unsettled, with regard to a considerable part of the Tract on which the computation is understood to be made. If it ultimately yields three Millions of dollars, it will probably equal every reasonable expectation.  
The Provisions for funding the Debt and for payment of Interest upon it are comprized in the following Acts.  
1st.   “An Act making provision for the Debt of the United States” passed August 4th. 1790.  
This Act commonly called the Funding Act contains these several provisions—vizt.  
1rst. It reserves out of the proceeds of the duties on Imports and Tonnage, for the support of the Government of the United States and their common defence, the yearly sum of 600000 Dollars.  
2nd. It appropriates so much of the same proceeds as should be necessary to the payment of Interest on foreign Loans, before that time contracted, or which should afterwards be contracted for discharging the arrears of interest and the principal of antecedent foreign loans, to continue so appropriated till the debt constituted by those loans should be fully discharged.  
3rd. It authorizes the president to borrow any sum or sums not exceeding 12.000.000 of dollars to discharge the arrears of Interest upon, and the installments of the principal of the foreign debt, due and to grow due; and if to be effected on advantageous terms to pay off the whole of that debt; and further authorises him to make such other contracts respecting it as should be found for the interest of the United States, so that no engagement or contract should preclude from reimbursing the sums borrowed within fifteen years, after they should be borrowed.  
4   In order to adapt the form of the domestic debt to the then circumstances of the United States, as far as should be found practicable “consistently with good faith and the rights of the Creditors,” which it truly declares “could only be done by a voluntary loan on their part”—It proposes a loan to the United States, (directing for that purpose Books for Subscriptions to be opened at the Treasury and by Commissioners of Loans in the several States on the 1rst of October 1790 and to continue for a year) the sums subscribed to the Loan to be paid in certain enumerated evidences of the debt of the United States upon these terms, vizt  
1st. That the Interest unpaid on the principal of these evidences should be computed up to the last of december 1790.  
2nd. That for any sum subscribed and paid in principal of the debt, the Subscriber should be entitled to one Certificate for a sum equal to ⅔ of the sum subscribed, bearing an Interest of 6 ⅌ Centum ⅌ Annum, commencing the first day of January 1791, payable quarter yearly, and subject to redemption by payments not exceeding in one year, on Account both of principal and Interest, eight dollars upon a hundred of the Original sum so subscribed and paid—and to another Certificate for a sum equal to the remaining third of that sum, which after the year 1800 should bear a like Interest, payable in like manner, and subject to a like rate of redemption. But that the United States though having a right to redeem in the abovementioned proportion should not be obliged to do it.  
3rd. That for any sum subscribed and paid in the Interest of the debt, the Subscriber should be entitled to a Certificate for a sum equal to the sum subscribed, bearing an Interest of 3 ⅌ Centum ⅌ Annum from the said last day of december 1790, payable quarter yearly, and redeemable at pleasure by payment of the principal.  
4th. That the new Stock created by the said loan, should be transferable on the Books upon which the credit for it should stand by the proprietor or his Attorney; these Books to be either those kept for the purpose at the Treasury or by Commissioners of Loans in the respective States; a mode being provided for the Transfer from the books at one place to those at another.  
5th. That the interest should be payable wheresoever the credit for the Stock should exist when the payment of Interest should become due—except that the dividend of Interest for any quarter of a year [which] should not be demanded before the expiration of a third quarter should afterwards be demandable only at the Treasury.  
6th. That for the regular payment of the Interest on the several kinds of Stock to arise from the loan as it should accrue, including that which is deferred, the proceeds of the public Revenues, which before that time had been or during the then Session should be provided, after reserving yearly 600,000 Dollars for the support of the Government of the United States and their common defence, and such sum as should be necessary for payment of Interest on the foreign loans before mentioned, should be and thereby were pledged, and appropriated ’till the final redemption of the Capital Stock.  
V. Premising that some of the Creditors of the United States might not think fit to become subscribers to the Loan, This Act declares that “nothing contained in it should be construed in any wise to alter, abrige, or impair the rights of those Creditors of the United States who should not subscribe to the loan, or the Contracts upon which their respective Claims are founded; but that the said Contracts and rights should remain in full force and Virtue”: And to obviate all idea of compulsion on the Creditors to subscribe, it allows to nonsubscribers, during the pendency of the loan and until the end of the year 1791, a rate ⅌ Centum on their respective demands equal to that which is paid to subscribing Creditors; on the sole condition that the evidences of debt holden by them, except those which had been issued by the Register of the Treasury for the registered debt, should be exchanged for other Certificates specifying the specie amount of those in exchange for which they were given and otherwise of the like tenor with those which had theretofore been issued by the Register of the Treasury for the Registered debt; stating as the grounds of this condition that some of the Certificates then in circulation had not been liquidated to specie value, that most of them were greatly subject to Counterfeit, that counterfeits had actually taken place in numerous instances, and that embarrassment and imposition might attend the payment of Interest on these certificates in their then form.  
VIth. This Act likewise proposes another Loan to the Amount of 21,500,000 Dollars, payable in the principal and interest indiscriminately of the evidences of debt of the respective states, according to certain quotas; to be conducted in the same manner and to be open for the same time as that in the Domestic Debt of the United States.  
The terms of this loan to be—  
1st. That for any sum subscribed, the subscriber should be intitled to one certificate for a sum equal to ⁴⁄₉ths of the Subscribed Sum, bearing an interest of 6 ⅌ Centum per annum, commencing the 1st day of January 1791—to another Certificate for a sum equal to ²⁄₉ths of the said subscribed sum, bearing an interest after the year 1800 of 6 ⅌ Centum per annum, and to a third certificate for a sum equal to ³⁄₉ths of the said subscribed sum, bearing an Interest of three ⅌ Centum per Annum, commencing on the same 1st day of January 1791. The interest in each case to be payable in like manner, and to be subject to the like redemption as that on the correspondent kinds of Stock, to be created by the said first mentioned Loan. And the Stock to be created by the second Loan to be transferable on the same principles, and in the same Modes as that produced by the former.  
2nd. That for the regular payment of interest on the several kinds of stock to arise from this loan as it should accrue, including that which is deferred, the proceeds of the public Revenues which before that time had been, or during the then Session should be provided, after reserving the aforesaid yearly sum of 600,000 dollars, the sum necessary for payment of Interest on the foreign loans made and to be made, and the sum necessary for payment of Interest on the Loan in the Domestic Debt, should be, and thereby were pledged and appropriated, to continue so pledged and appropriated, until the final redemption of the Capital Stock.  
VII. To secure the due application of these revenues according to the appropriations, an account of them is directed to be kept, distinct from that of the proceeds of any other revenues, except such as should be raised to make good a deficiency in those: and the faith of the United States is pledged to appropriate additional and permanent funds for satisfying such deficiency.  
VIII. The proceeds of the sales of Lands in the Western Territory, then belonging, or which thereafter should belong to the United States, are pledged and appropriated for the discharge of the debts which the United States then owed, or by virtue of that Act, should owe.  
There are several collateral and supplementary provisions, which are omitted as immaterial to the intended view of the Subject.  
IInd. “An Act repealing after the last day of June next the duties heretofore laid upon distilled Spirits &amp;c.” passed the 3rd. of March 1791.  
The proceeds of the duties laid by this Act are made subject to the same appropriations and in the same order of priority as those contained in the funding Act; and to secure their due application an Account is directed to be kept of them, distinct from that of any other Revenues except those appropriated by the funding Act.  
IIIrd. “An Act for raising a further sum of Money for the protection of the Frontiers &amp;c” passed May 2nd. 1792.  
This Act, which as has been before noticed increased permanently the duties on certain imported Articles, and laid a temporary additional duty on some others, appropriates primarily the proceeds of the permanent augmentations in the same manner and to the same purposes as the antecedent duties were appropriated, that is, in conformity with the funding Act.  
IV. “An act concerning the duties on Spirits distilled within the United States” passed May 8th 1792.  
This Act, which lowers the duties on Spirits distilled within the United States and on Stills, appropriates the proceeds of the reduced duties in the same manner as were the former duties; and to make good whatever deficiency might be occasion’d by the reduction of the rates, pledges as a substitute the Surplus of the augmented duties laid by the last cited act.  
  
V. “An act providing for the payment of the Second installment due on a loan made of the Bank of the United States,” passed June 4th. 1794.  
This act in addition to a provision for paying that second installment, appropriates as much of the dividends on the Stock which the United States hold in the Bank, as should be necessary to the payment of Interest on the Capital, of a loan of 2,000,000 of dollars had of the Bank, pursuant to the 11th. Section of the act by which it is incorporated.  
It also fixes the last day of december in each year as the An[n]ual period for the payment of the Successive installments of that loan.  
VI. “An Act making Provision for the payment of the Interest on the Balances due to certain States upon a final settlement of Accounts between the United States and the Individual States” passed May 30th. 1794.  
This Act directs, that interest shall be allowed and computed on the ballances to creditor States from the last of december 1789 to the last of december 1794, which being placed to their Credit respectively shall bear an Interest of three ⅌ Centum ⅌ Annum from the period last mentioned.  
It further directs, that the Interest on the principal balances to be funded agreeably to the terms of the Act for the settlement of Accounts, together with the interest upon the arrears of interest computed on those Balances and forming a new Capital, Shall be payable at the offices of the Commissioners of Loans within the States to which the balances are respectively due, and Shall be paid quarter yearly after the last day of December 1794, at the same epochs in each year at which interest is payable on the other parts of the Funded debt: to which end so much of the proceeds of the duties on Imports and Tonnage as may be necessary, and as were not otherwise previously appropriated, are appropriated; and the faith of the United States is pledged to provide for any deficiency which may happen by additional &amp; permenant funds.  
There are several Acts which prolong from time to time the subscriptions in the Domestic and State Debts, on the same terms as by the funding Act; those in the domestic Debt being continued down to the last day of December 1794: which acts together with the acts particularly Cited comprise all those that relate to the funding of the public debt &amp; the payment of Interest thereupon. The result of these Acts is exhibited in the Tables A B C &amp; D. which shew the amount of the foreign debt, that of the funded Debt, the probable amount of that which remains unfunded, of what Composed and the an[n]ual amount of Interest upon the different portions of debt according to contract, &amp; according to the plan of this report.  
The provisions for reimbursing &amp; redeeming the public Debt are contained in the following Acts and are as follow Vizt  
Ist   “An Act making provision for the Debt of the United States” passed the 4th of August 1790.  
This Act, which is the one that regulates the funding of the Debt, by the last Section appropriates the proceeds of the Sales of Lands in the western Territory, then belonging, or thereafter to belong to the United States, to the sinking or discharging of the debts for which the United States then were, or by virtue of that act should be holden; to be applied solely to that use untill they should be fully satisfyed.  
IInd   “An Act making provision for the reduction of the Public debt”—passed August 12th 1790.  
This act premising that it is desirable by all just and proper means to effect a reduction of the Public debt, and that the application of the surplus revenue to that object will not only contribute to this desirable end, but will be beneficial to the Creditors of the United States by raising the price of their Stock, and be productive of Considerable saving to the United States enacts  
1st   That the surplus of the duties on imports and Tonnage to the end of the year 1790 shall be applied to the purchase of the Debt of the United States at its market price; if not exceeding the par or true Value thereof.  
2nd   That the purchases to be made shall be conducted under the direction of the President of the Senate, The Chief Justice, the Secretary of State, The Secretary of the Treasury, and the Attorney General; who or any three of whom with the approbation of the President are Authorised to cause them to be made, in such a manner and under such regulations as shall appear to them best calculated to fulfil the intent of this Act; provided that the same should be made openly and with due regard to the equal benefit of the several States.  
3rd. That the Accounts of the application of the fund should be settled as other public Accounts, accompanied with returns of the amount of debt purchased, at the end of each quarter of the year; and that a full &amp; exact report of the proceedings of the Commissioners should be laid before congress within the first fourteen days of each session, including a statement of the disbursements &amp; purchases, specifying the times when, prices at which, and persons of whom the purchases were made.  
4th. That in addition to this fund, The President should be authorised to borrow any sum or sums, not exceeding 2.000.000 of dollars, at an interest not exceeding five per centum, to be applied to purchases of Public Debt in like manner and under the same direction and regulations as the first mentioned fund. Provided that out of the interest of the Debt to be purchased there should be appropriated annually a sum not exceeding eight per centum of the sums borrowed, towards paying the interest and reimbursing the principal of these sums.  
But to guard against the possibility of a deficiency of means to pay the interest on the Debt, which was to accrue in the year 1791, authority is given to reserve and apply to that purpose out of the first mentioned fund as much as might be necessary to supply the defect of receipts during the year, on Account of the duties which should accrue after the year 1790.  
  
III   “An Act repealing after the last day of June next the duties heretofore laid upon Distilled Spirits &amp;c” passed the 3rd of March 1791.  
This Act appropriates whatever surplus may remain from year to year of the proceeds of the duties which it imposes, after satisfying prior appropriations, to the Reduction of the Public Debt; unless such surplus shall be required for the current public exigencies and by special acts of Congress shall be appropriated thereto.  
IVth. An Act supplementary to the Act making provision for the Reduction of the Public Debt—passed the 3rd. day of March 1791.  
This Act declares that the terms of a loan of three Millions of Florins obtained in Holland, being 5 per Cent interest and 4½ ⅌ Cent for charges, and future Loans on the same terms, should be deemed to be within the meaning of the Act of the 12th. of August 1790.  
V. An Act supplementary to the Act making provision for the debt of the United States—passed May 8th. 1792.  
This Act makes provision for the payment of a debt due to certain foreign Officers who had served the United States (the interest of which was by stipulation payable at Paris)—out of the Moneys authorised to be borrowed by the funding Act.  
It also establishes a permanent Sinking Fund to be composed.  
1st. of the Interest of the Public debt purchased, redeemed, or paid into the Treasury in satisfaction of any debt or demand.  
2nd. of the surplus, if any, which should remain of moneys appropriated for paying the interest of the Public Debt after paying that Interest.  
This fund is to be applied under the direction of the Commissioners nominated in the Act of the 12th. of August, with the like approbation of the President  
1st. to the purchase of the several species of stock constituting the debt of the United States at their respective market prices, not exceeding the par or true value thereof, and as nearly as may be in equal proportions, until the annual amount of the Fund shall be equal to two per Centum of the Whole Amount of the outstanding funded Stock bearing a present interest of 6 ⅌ Centum: thenceforth  
2nd. to the redemption of that Stock, according to the right reserved to the United States, until the Whole should be redeemed; and lastly, after such redemption, to the purchase at its market price of any unredeemed Debt of the United States; which purchases are directed to be made at the lowest prices at which they can be effected by open purchase, or by receiving sealed proposals to be opened in the presence of the Commissioners, or persons authorised by them to make purchases, and of the persons making the proposals; and are to be accounted for at the Treasury, and reported to Congress in the same manner as the purchases before authorised to be made.  
VI. An Act making appropriations for the support of Government for the Year 1793.  
This act provides that the President of the United States shall cause so much of the loan made of the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the 11th Section of the Act of incorporation, to be paid off in sums not less than 50,000 dollars, as in his opinion the State of the Treasury may from time to time admit, out of any Monies which may be in the Treasury; having due regard to the exigencies of the Government, and the appropriations made and to be made by Law.  
VII. “An Act making provision for the payment of the first installment due on a Loan made of the Bank of the United States,” passed March 2nd. 1793.  
This act authorises the payment of the first installment of a loan of 2,000,000 of dollars had of the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the 11th Section of the Act by which it is incorporated, out of the Moneys borrowed upon the authority of the Act making provision for the Reduction of the Public debt.  
VIII. “An Act providing for the payment of the second installment, due on a loan made of the Bank of the United States” passed June 4th 1794.  
This act authorises the payment of that Second installment out of the proceeds of any foreign loans before that time transferred to the United States. It makes other provisions, which have been noticed under a preceding head.  
These acts comprise all the provisions which have been made for reimbursing and redeeming the debt of the United States—the result to the last of December 1794 is presented in the Statement E.  
There are two other acts, which tho’ not falling properly under either of the foregoing heads require from their relation to the Subject to be brought into view.  
Ist. An act relative to Claims against the United States not barred by any act of Limitation and which have not been already adjusted,” passed February 12th. 1793.  
This Act directs that all claims of the description given in the Title shall be presented at the Treasury for adjustment by the 1st. of May 1794, or shall be forever after barred, except those for Loan office certificates, Final Settlements, Indents of Interest, Registers Certificates, Balances on the books of the Treasury, Loans of Money in foreign Count[r]ies, Certificates issued under the Act intitled “An Act making provision for the debt of the United States.” Such of the Claims presented as cannot be admitted in the course of the Treasury, are to be reported to Congress by the accounting officers.  
Among the Claims inadmissable in the ordinary course of the Treasury is a sum of 90574 Dollars of the bills of Credit commonly called new Emisson Money.  
II. “An Act making further provision for the expences attending the intercourse of the United States with Foreign Nations &amp;c.” passed March 20th. 1794.  
This Act appropriates, in Addition to former provisions, one Million of Dollars for the purposes mentioned in the title, to be paid out of any moneys which may be in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and to be applied under the direction of the President of the United States, who is also authorised if necessary to borrow the whole or any part of the sum; but there is no special appropriation either for paying the interest, or reimbursing the Principal of the loan.  
The Act already quoted of the ninth of June 1794 intitled “An Act making appropriations for certain purposes therein expressed” with a view to remedy this defect appropriates out of the proceeds of the Taxes laid during the last Session such sum as shall be sufficient to pay the Interest on whatever moneys may be borrowed pursuant to the Act of March 20th. 1794.  
The foregoing review of the Laws, which constitute the fiscal system of the United States, displays these prominent points as the leading features of that system.  
1   That all the current revenues of the United States are derived from these sources (Vizt.) Imported articles, The Tonnage of Ships and Vessels, Spirits distilled within the United States &amp; Stills, The Postage of Letters, fees on Patents, Dividends of Bank Stock, Snuff manufactured within the United States, Sugar refined within the United States, Sales at Auction, Licences to retail Wines &amp; distilled Spirits, Carriages for the conveyance of persons.  
2nd   That of these Revenues, the principal part of the duties on imported Articles, those on the Tonnage of Ships or Vessels, those on distilled Spirits &amp; Stills, those on the postage of Letters, Patent fees, the dividends of Bank Stock, are permanent (the three first being commensurate with the existence of the Debt, for the payment of the Interest of which they are pledged, the 4th. and 5th. having no limit assigned in the laws, and the last being commensurate with the duration of the property in the Stock)—all the others temporary, being limited to continue no longer than ’till the end of the session of Congress next after the expiration of two years from the respective times of passing the laws which establish them.  
3rd   That the permanent duties on imported articles, the Tonnage duties, the duties on Spirits distilled within the United States and on Stills, are subject to these permanent dispositions.  
1rst   To an Annual reservation of 600,000 Dollars for the support of the Government of the United States and their common defence.  
2nd   To an appropriation of so much as may be necessary to pay the Interest on the foreign loans provided for by the funding Act.  
3rd   To an appropriation of so much as may be necessary to pay the interest on the Stock created by the Loan in domestic debt, or more properly in the original debt of the United States.  
4th   To an appropriation of so much as may be necessary to discharge the interest on the Stock created by the loan in the Debts of the respective States.  
5. To an appropriation of so much as may be necessary to pay the interest on the Balances due to creditor States.  
which dispositions establish Priorities according to the order in which they are here enumerated.  
4th   That the surplus if any of the duties on Spirits distilled within the United States and on Stills has an ultimate appropriation, that is, to the reduction of the public Debt; but that the surplusses of the other duties have no such ultimate appropriation.  
5th   That the duties on the postage of Letters and the nett dividends on Bank Stock have no permanent or particular appropriation.  
6th   That the temporary duties are charged with a specific Sum of 1,292,137 Dollars &amp; 38 Cents and with the payment of Interest on a sum of 1,000,000 of dollars authorised to be borrowed for the expences of foreign intercourse.  
7th   That the whole of the Foreign debt, and all that part of the D

n than at the rate of 8 ⅌ Centum per annum of the original sum on Account both of principal &amp; interest; but the three per cent Stock is redeemable at pleasure.  
10th   That the provision for subscribing to the Loan in Domestic Debt expired on the last of december 1794, &amp; that no further provision has been made for the unsubscribed residue.  
11th   That the funding Act expressly confirms the contracts and rights of the Creditors of the United States, who shall not think fit to subscribe to the loan, and gives an expectation to them of further and other arrangements upon the event of the propositions made to them.  
12th   That the proceeds of all the Lands of the United States in the western Territory are appropriated to the redemption of all that part of the public debt, for which prior to the funding Act, or by virtue thereof, the United States were or are liable.  
13th   That, in addition to this, a regular Sinking Fund has been successively constituted, to be applied under the direction of five principal Officers of the United States with the approbation of the president, hitherto composed of three parts 1st the Surplus of the duties on imports &amp; Tonnage to the end of 1790; 2ndly. the proceeds of loans not exceeding 2.000.000 of Dollars authorised to be borrowed for the purpose (these two funds to be invested in purchases) and 3rdly (in which the two former resolve themselves) the Interest on the public debt purchased redeemed or paid into the Treasury, together with the surpluses, if any, of monies appropriated for Interest; to be applied 1st to purchases of the debt till the fund is equal to two per centum of the outstanding Stock bearing a present interest of 6 per Cent 2nd to the redemption of that Stock, &amp; lastly to purchases of any unredeemed residue of the public debt. But there is reserved out of this fund a sum not exceeding 8 ⅌ Centum ⅌ annum, towards the payment of Interest &amp; reimbursing of principal of the loans made for purchases of the Debt.

This sum is liable to be increased by the interest which will begin to accrue on the deferred Stock the first of January 1801, being on the present amount of that Stock 871,401 Dollars &amp; 92 Cents.  
The Annual force of the sinking fund as depending on ascertained funds may be stated as follows.

}  
24.699.56  
  
  
  
Dollars  
106.364.60  
  
  
It is further liable to be increased by an investment in purchases of 865098 Dolls and 11 Cents, which together with the sums from that source already invested in purchases and payments will amount to 2.000.000 of Dollars, the sum authorised to be borrowed by purchases of the Debt.  
But as this auxiliary depends on an operation, not only future but in some degree casual, it cannot be taken into an estimate of the actual strength of the fund.  
The proceeds of the sales of Western Lands must also be considered as an eventual resource.  
There are other contingent sources of augmentation not computed, because they are contingent: But on the other hand the fund is liable to be reduced by a sum reserved out of it for the payment of principal and interest of the two Millions authorised to be borrowed for purchases not exceeding 8 ⅌ Centum per annum.  
The Sum applicable in the first instance to the redemption of that portion of the funded Debt which bears a present interest of 6 ⅌ Centum, excluding that standing to the Credit of the Commissioners of the Sinking fund, is as follows  
  
  
of Transferrable Stock  
516.410.24  
  
  
of Untransferrable Stock arising from Balances to Creditor States  
 46.901.12  
  
  
Dollars  
563.311.36  
  
  
The Sum applicable in the first instance, that is on the 1st day of January 1802, to the redemption of that portion of the funded debt now called deferred Stock; excluding that Standing to the Credit of the Commissioners of the Sinking fund, will be as follows  
  
  
Of transferrable Stock  
249.576.75  
  
  
Of Untransferrable Stock arising from Balances to Creditor States  
 23.450.56  
  
  
Dolls  
273.027.31  
  
  
These sums would complete the redemption of the whole amount of the Stock, to which they are applicable within Twenty three Years after the redemption in each case was begun; within which terms, they would discharge the whole of the public Debt except the foreign debt, the unsubscribed Debt, and the three ⅌ Cent Stock.  
If the redemption of the present 6 ⅌ Cent Stock, commence the first of January 1796 and the redeeming fund be commensurate with the whole of the unredeemed Stock bearing a present Interest of six per Cent and transferrable, the Revenue set free in the Year 1818, for operations upon the residue of the Debt will be 2039394 Dolls. &amp; 36 Cents.  
If the Redemption of the deferred debt commence the first of January 1802, when it may rightfully commence, and the redeeming fund be commensurate with the whole of that Stock, unredeemed and transferrable, the Revenue set free in the year 1824 for operations upon the residue of the Public Debt, if any remain, will be 998307 Dols &amp; 02 Cents.  
The Revenue set free by these successive redemptions, would be sufficient to redeem the whole of the present foreign Debt in six years, that is within a term of 28 Years from the proposed time; for commencing the Redemption, or the 1st of January 1796, and after extinguishing the foreign debt would more than discharge the whole of the balances to Creditor States and the whole of the unfunded Debt in two years more.  
If the proceeds of the Lands in the Western Territory should be equal to three Millions of Dollars, and the three ⅌ Cent Stock can be purchased at an average of twelve shillings in the pound, that fund would suffice to pay off the principal of the three ⅌ Cent Stock in something more than twenty five years.  
It follows that if the force of the sinking fund be rendered equal, exclusive of the proceeds of the Sales of Western Lands, to the Redemption of the present unredeemed Transferrable Stock, commencing the first of January 1796, as to that bearing a present Interest of 6 ⅌ Centum, and the first of January 1802, as to that bearing a future Interest of 6 ⅌ Centum, and if the proceeds of the Sales of Western Lands, should prove equal to 3,000,000 of dollars, and can be brought into action for purchases of the 3 ⅌ Ct. Stock at the rate abovementioned at any time before the year 1801, the whole of the present Debt of the United States foreign and Domestic (the funds appropriated being during the whole period adequate in productiveness and inviolably applied) would be extinguished in 30 Years. And there would then revert to the United States an Annual income of 4435320 Dollars &amp; 89 Cents.  
Some Auxiliary provisions which will be proposed may greatly accelerate that result.  
  
Note. These results are not stated with fractional correctness, because it is not necessary to a satisfactory conclusion, &amp; the minuteness of the Calculation would have demanded more time than can conveniently be spared.  
  
  
On the basis of the foregoing data, the Secretary of the Treasury proceeds to submit to the consideration of Congress certain propositions, which appear to him necessary to be adopted to complete our system of Public Credit. These will be followed by some explanatory remarks.  
  
Ist. Proposition  
That further provision be made with regard to the yet unsubscribed debt of the United States as follows:  
1rst   Further time to be given until the end of the year 1795 to subscribe the same to the Loan proposed by the funding Act; with liberty to the holders to subscribe the arrears of interest up to that period separately from the principal reserving that principal on its original footing.  
2nd   An appropriation to be made for payment of Interest on so much of the principal (excepting Loan Office Certificates bearing Interest on the nominal value) as at the end of the year 1795 shall remain unsubscribed, for the term of one year, according to the rate or rates stipulated by the original Contracts, and for the payment of ten ⅌ Centum of the Arrears of interest thereupon to the same end of the year 1795. This payment to be made on the first of January 1796; at the Treasury, where no particular place of payment is stipulated, and at such place, where there is one stipulated.  
3rd   The specie principal of the Loan Office Certific⟨ates⟩ which bear interest on the nominal value together with the arrears of interest to be immediately paid off.  
II Proposition  
That provision be made for taking upon loan to the United States, by subscription at the Treasury, the outstanding and unbarred new emission Bills of Credit; the sums subscribed to be paid in the principal only of those Bills, and the Stock of the New Loan to bear an Interest of 5 ⅌ Cent ⅌ Annum, payable quarter yearly at the Treasury, and redeemable at the pleasure of the United States by payment of the principal, with a stipulation to pay the same at the expiration of thirty years. The Loan to be deemed to commence on the first of January 1796 and to rest on funds permanently pledged, namely the permanent Revenues.  
III Proposition  
That provision be made for converting by a new Loan the whole of our present foreign into Domestic Debt upon these terms (to wit) that for any sum subscribed to the new Loan and paid in the principal of the present foreign debt of the United states, there be allowed, in addition to the interest now payable upon such principal, the further yearly interest of ½ ⅌ Centum, or in lieu thereof, at the option of each subscriber, an equivalent sum in Capital stock bearing an Interest of 5 ⅌ Centum ⅌ Annum; that the whole interest upon the new loan, including that upon the Capital Stock to be given as an equivalent for the additional ½ ⅌ Cent, shall remain fixed until the first day of January 1818, at which time and not sooner the principal of the said new loan, including the said Capital Stock given as an equivalent, may and shall be reimbursed except as to such Subscribers as may prefer a Shorter term of reimbursement, who may elect any term not less than fifteen years: That the permanent revenues shall be and remain firmly pledged for the payment of the said Interest until the reimbursement of the said principal, to be paid quarter yearly as that of the present Funded Domestic debt:  
And lastly, that the commissioners of the sinking fund be empowered with the approbation of the President to provide by new loans for the reimbursement of any instalment or part of Principal of the present foreign debt, or of the loan to be made thereupon as aforesaid, either by direct borrowing, or by sale in the Market of Certificates of Stock, so as the said loan, or the said Certificates of Stock, shall bear an interest not exceeding 6 ⅌ Centum ⅌ Annum, and shall be liable to reimbursement within a term not exceeding twenty four Years. The interest upon the Capital reimbursed, and in aid thereof the permanent Revenues, to be pledged for the interest upon the loans or Stock to be made or created by virtue of the said power.

g fund, pursuant to the powers vested in them; and Provided that no second application of any such excess shall derogate from the fund once reserved for the redemption [by payment] or purchases of the said residue of the Debt, within the said term of thirty years.  
10th   To provide that all reimbursements of the Capital of the Public Debt foreign and domestic, and of the remaining installments of the aforesaid Loan of the Bank of the United States, be made under the Superintendance of the Commissioners of the sinking fund, empowering them with the approbation of the president of the United States, as the installments of principal become due, to borrow if necessary the sums requisite to pay these installments; provided that the ultimate term for the reimbursement of any loan they may make shall not exceed twenty four years—the Interest thereof to be charged 1st. upon the Interest of the Installments which shall be reimbursed by means thereof, ☞except the installments of funded 6 ⅌ Cent Stock.  
2ndly. upon the Revenue from Imports and Tonnage to make good any deficiency.  
VI. Proposition  
That Power be given to the Commissioners of the sinking fund, with the approbation of the President to borrow from time to time, such sums as may be necessary in anticipation of the Revenues appropriated for the purpose, not exceeding in one year one Million of dollars, to be reimbursed within a year from the time of each Loan; for the payment of the interest which shall annually accrue on the Public Debt.  
The Interest upon each loan to be defrayed out of the permanent Revenues.  
VII. Proposition  
That the internal revenues from snuff, and refined sugar, Sales at Auction, Licences to sell by retail foreign Distilled Spirits and Wines, and from Carriages for the conveyance of Persons, be continued to the first day of January 1800; [and thence until the end of the session of Congress next thereafter;] and that the reimbursement of the principal of the Loan of 1,000,000 of Dollars authorised to be borrowed for defraying the expences of foreign intercourse, be charged upon this fund.  
VIII Proposition  
That in regard to any Sum, which shall have remained unexpended upon any appropriations, other than for the payment of the interest of the funded Debt and for the purposes of the Sinking fund, for more than two years after the end of the Calender year in which the act of appropriation shall have been passed, such appropriation shall be deemed to cease and determine, and the sum unexpended upon it shall be carried to an account to be denominated “The Surplus Fund”; But no appropriation shall be so deemed to have ceased or determined till after the year 1795, unless it shall appear to the Secretary of the Treasury that the object of such appropriation has been fully satisfied, in which case it shall be Lawful for him to cause to be carried the unexpended residue thereof, to the Account aforesaid.  
IX Proposition  
That Provision be made that all priorities heretofore established in the appropriations for the funded debt, as between the different parts of the said debt shall after the year 1796 cease, with respect to all Creditors of the United States, who do not before the expiration of the said period signify their dissent therefrom; and that thenceforth with the exception only of the debts of those Creditors who shall so signify their dissent, the revenues charged with these appropriations shall constitute a common or consolidated Fund chargeable indiscriminately and without priority.  
X. Proposition  
That Provision be made for calling in all outstanding Loan office Certificates, Certificates called final Settlements, and Indents of Interest, and for issuing in Lieu of them other Certificates of equivalent tenor; establishing that all which shall not be presented for exchange within the term of two years, shall be barred.  
Remarks upon the First proposition.  
The experiment has now been fully tried, and with nearly complete success, of the disposition of the Public Creditors to accept the terms offered by the funding Act. Those who still decline have probably made a final election to abide by their original Contracts.  
It remains to fulfill them as to the future. This the Moral obligation of the Contracts, the new and peremptory sanction given to them by the present Government, and the essential maxims of Public Credit, unite to demand: and while these cogent motives, affecting intimately the permanent Character and general interest of the United States recommend the measure, there is now no longer any inducement from situation to procrastinate.  
The present advanced State of the National finances, and the inconsiderable Magnitude of the still unsubscribed debt, render it of little if of any consequence to obtain upon it the temporary accommodation of deferring the payment of a part of the interest accruing according to Contract. This motive apart, and considering the approximation of the period when the payment of interest on the deferred debt is to commence, the chance of benefiting by a fall of the market rate of interest incident to a provision for the debt on the terms of the contract, which makes it redeemable at pleasure, may be found more advantageous to the Government, than the partial postponement of interest incumbered with an abridgement of the right of redemption.  
To those, who should not rightly appreciate this circumstance, it might seem an objection, that the provision proposed would place those creditors who had not consented to accommodate the Government upon a better footing than those who had so consented.  
But a scruple of this kind is over-ruled by several considerations.  
1rst It is not improbable that a considerable proportion of those who may not have accepted the terms offered by the Funding Act are Executors and other Trustees who may have doubted their power to accept.  
2nd. Giving the fullest force to the fact which is the ground of the objection, it is one of those cases in which the general principles that constitute the permanent happiness of Society give the less meritorious advantages over the more meritorious. All the Creditors had a right to conform or not. Those who have not done it have only used their right, and it cannot be matter of objection or prejudice to them. To delay indefinitely a provision for their claims according to contract, is to annihilate the Contract.  
The complying Creditors cannot with propriety complain: They were informed unequivocally that the proposal of a new Loan was referred to their free choice, that the rights of those who did not assent would remain unimpaired, and compensations were offered in the new contracts for the surrender of the old. A plea that an ultimate provision was not relied upon could not be admitted; because it would be to convert a distrust of the faith of the Government into an argument against its being observed towards those who had depended upon it.  
But the complying Creditors actually received valuable considerations for the modification of their claims: Instead of Annual provision for their interest, which alone their contracts as they stood previous to the Funding Act required, they have had it secured by adequate funds permanently mortgaged for its payment.  
Instead of the stipulated annuity being redeemable at pleasure whenever a fall in the market rate of Interest should render it advantageous to pay off the Principal, it has acquired a more fixed character by the relinquishment of the Government to redeem, except in certain proportions, and a capacity to increase in capital value, by a declension of the market rate of Interest. Instead of receiving their Interest in one payment at the end of a year, they receive it in quarter yearly portions, which makes it in fact 6.15 ⅌ Cent in lieu of the stipulated rate of six ⅌ Centum.  
On the first point, it has been argued that supposing a steady preservation of its faith by the Government, it is indifferent to the Creditor whether his demand stands upon the basis of an annual provision or upon that of mortgaged funds.  
This is to substitute theory to fact. As well with regard to a Government as to an individual, there is in the nature of things an intrinsic difference between the value of a debt bottomed on mortgaged funds and that of a debt resting on what is called in the one case, and may be called in the other, personal security. The degree of this difference, and some of the circumstances on which it depends, may be different in the two cases, but the reality of its existence can be denied in neither.  
Government being administered by Men is naturally like individuals, subject to particular impulses, passions, prejudices, vices; of course to inconstancy of views and mutability of conduct. A kind of property of which the essence is Contract, must necessarily therefore be more or less valuable, because more or less secure, in proportion as it is little or much within the influence of that inconstancy or that mutability.  
If a Provision is to be made by a new resolution every year, that resolution being always liable to be affected by momentary circumstances is always casual. If made once for all, it continues of course, unless revoked by some positive Act, and has for that reason a moral certainty of Stability. But why, it may be asked, if a disposition unfaithful to the Public engagements, or unfriendly to public Credit shou’d exist, would it not operate to produce a violation of a provision made as well as to prevent the making of one?  
The two things are widely different. To undo: which is to act, and in such a case to act with violence, requires more enterpise and vigour, and presupposes greater energy, or a Stronger impulse, than not to do, or to forbear to act. This is particularly true where a number of wills is to concur. Many men who will not rouse to the effort or encounter the responsibility of doing mischief by positive acts, will readily enough slide into it by a negative conduct, that is by omitting to act. Many men, merely from easiness of temper or want of active fortitude, will suffer evil to take place, which they neither desire, nor would themselves commit. In Collective bodies votes are necessary to action, absences may produce inaction. It often happens, that a majority of voices could not be had to a resolution to undo or reverse a thing once done, which there would not be a majority of voices to do.  
This reasoning acquires tenfold force when applied to a complex government like ours, that is to a Government distributed into departments, acting through different organs, which must concur to give it motion; as in our Constitution the House of Representatives, The Senate, and the President.  
In delicate and difficult cases whether to issue in good or ill, a suspension of action is far more natural to such a Government than action. It can hardly happen, that all the branches or parts of it can be infected at one time with a common passion, a disposition, manifestly inimical to justice and the Public good; as to prostrate the public Credit by revoking a pledge given to the Creditors. It is far more probable that such a disposition should at one time possess one part, at another time another part. Possessing either part it might be sufficient to obstruct a provision which was to be made. Without possessing all the parts, it could not subvert one, which had been made. The last can scarcely be supposed, except in one of those extraordinary Crises of Nations which confound all ordinary calculation.  
Hence the value of Property in Public Debt, which rests on specified and competent funds firmly pledged for the satisfaction of the Creditor, is intrinsically greater, and to a considerable extent, than that of property in Public Debt which depends on annual provision. Hence too, a Creditor to whom such a pledge was not stipulated, may be justly said to have received a compensation for the relinquishment of a portion of his Interest.  
On the Second point, it has been observed with less plausibility, that in this country where it would be to the advantage of the Creditor to receive his principal rather than a rate of 6 ⅌ Cent Interest, the abridgment of the right of redemption is of no value.  
1st   The proposition is not universally true.  
  
It depends on the particular situation of a creditor whether it be his interest to be reimbursed his principal or not. It is believed owing to the impunctuality of Collections, that in no part of the United States does fair lending at private interest upon real security Nett 6 ⅌ Cent.  
2nd   As far as it is true, it does not authorise the inference which is drawn: Because the creditor cannot demand his principal when it suits him; but must wait till it is convenient to the Government to pay. This conveniance might not exist till there was a fall in the market rate of Interest, and then it would not be the interest of the Creditor to receive. Unable to exact the principal when he pleases, it is a material point gained to be able to arrest the hand of the Government from paying him, when it is his interest not to receive.  
It is evident that whenever the rate of interest to which he is intitled shall exceed the market rate, if he cannot be obliged to receive back his principal or take the market rate, his Stock must rise in value in proportion to the difference, and the degree of its duration.  
Nor is an idea which has been entertained just, that this advantage is remote and contingent; to accrue only to those who may be holders at the time of the fall of Interest, at the expence of those who were holders when the funding Act passed; many of whom, as it is alledged, having been obliged to alienate, then or shortly after, suffered loss in the sale, from the postponement of a part of their interest, without benefitting by the supposed equivalents.  
The fairness of an equivalent ought never to be tested by the necessities of particular Individuals. It ought to be estimated by the general principles of Value; by the natural and real operation of things. Admitting therefore the suggestion as to such individuals to be true, it would decide nothing.  
But it is not true. The permanancy of a high rate of interest and possibility of a future rise of the Capital above par, by a fall of the market rate below the stipulated rate, were to the first holders of the Stock circumstances of present Value.  
Foreigners, especially, whose purchases would necessary influence the Market, would give higher prices for it on these accounts.  
And when to this are added the Funding of the new Stock and the payment of the Interest quarter Yearly—there is solid ground for entertaining an opinion, that the Stock has from the earliest period borne a better price in the Market than [it would have done,] upon the principle of an annual payment of 6 ⅌ Cent on the whole Capital by an Annual provision.  
This opinion would be confirmed, if we should take as a guide what actually happened in one or more of the States which made annual provision for the payment of interest upon their Debits at the stipulated rate of 6 ⅌ Cent: With this provision the market price of their Stock rarely exceeded 33⅓ ⅌ Centum.  
It is probable that greater confidence in the ability and constancy of views of the Government of the United States might have given greater value to their Stock in a like Situation. But it is not to be doubted that it would have felt in a great degree a similar effect of that situation.  
This may not appear with respect to the small amount of unsubscribed debt now to be provided for, and with the advantage of a confirmation of confidence by experience—But it could not have failed to have been very apparent, if the whole debt had been provided for on this plan.  
These observations serve to render it probable that the Creditors who have accepted the terms offered by the Government have not been injured by the Acceptance, that if they had now an option to change their ground for that which is proposed for non Subscribers, it would be an ill judged choice in them to do it, and that upon these as well as other accounts they will have no cause to be dissatisfied with the proposals under consideration.  
Let it be added, that whether the nonsubscribers shall fare better or not by that proposal than the subscribers, it is the interest of all the public creditors upon principle and precedent, that the public faith should be preserved towards them.  
But at the same time, every consideration connected with the question urges that nothing more should be done for non subscribers than is positively due to good faith. Accordingly the proposition contemplates that their debt shall not be funded but that provision shall be annually made.  
With regard to arrears of Interest a tenth part only is proposed to be paid on the first of January 1796. At this rate they would be paid off in Ten years.  
In strictness, they ought to be immediately discharged, but to have done this on the whole debt would have been impracticable—to do it on what now remains unsubscribed would not only be unequal but would at the present moment obstruct arrangements which are conducive to the general interests of the Creditors. The case of a large arrear of interest arising from the inability of the Government [which contracted the principal Debt,] which is the present case, is liable to some peculiar considerations.  
The State of the Treasury in succeeding years will enable Congress to decide how far the payment can be accelerated. In the mean time the Creditors have an option to separate those arrears from the principal and to fund them at three ⅌ Cent, as has been done generally with regard to interest.  
A difference is made in the Special case of the Loan Office Certificates which by contract are intitled to an interest of 6 ⅌ Cent on the Nominal principal, redeemable only by payment of the Specie principal.  
This is too disadvantageous a footing for the Government.  
The alternative most convenient at present is to pay off the Debt, which is proposed. To elude this contract would be to sacrifice a very great principle to a very little interest. The amount will be Seen in the Statement A.  
Remarks on the II. Proposition.  
The Certificates or bills of Credit called New emission Money were emitted pursuant to a resolution of Congress of the 18th. March 1780, which directs them to be emitted upon the funds of individual States, to bear an interest of five ⅌ Centum per annum, payable in Specie at the Redemption of the Bills, or at the election of the Holder, annually at the continental Loan Offices, in Sterling bills drawn by the United States upon their Commissioners in Europe, and pledges the faith of the United States for the payment of the said Bills, in case any State on whose funds they should be emitted should by the events of War be rendered incapable to redeem them; directing also an indorsement to be made on each bill in these words “The United States insure the payment of the within Bill and will draw Bills of exchange for the interest annually if demanded, according to a resolution of Congress of the 18th. of March 1780.”  
These resolutions and the indorsement upon the Bills engage the absolute promise of the United States for the payment of the interest indefinitely, and their eventual guarantee of the principal, in case any State on whose funds the Bills should be emitted should by the events of War be rendered incapable to redeem them; which is in effect, tho not in form, an absolute guarantee of the principal; for the United States are bound to pay the interest perpetually ’till that is discharged.  
Good faith demands that the United States should supply the omissions of the States which issued the Bills, by providing themselves, at least for the interest upon them.  
But it is not as easy to pronounce on what terms they ought to be provided for.  
On their face, and according to the unrevoked resolutions of Congress, they are of Specie value equal to their nominal amount and bearing 5 ⅌ Cent interest.  
But it is known that they were issued by different States at different inferior values fixed by previous laws.  
The true nature of the contract therefore, in fact, and the true equity of the case, are from these circumstances involved in some question.  
A compromise by a new agreement seems the best road out of the difficulty.  
This is the aim of the proposition, which it is hoped will in the main reasonably consult all interests.  
There have been special references of this subject to the secretary, but he purposely declined a report ’till the expiration of the term limited by the Act entitled “An Act relative to Claims against the United States not barred by any Act of Limitation and which have not been already adjusted” passed the 12th of February 1793 had obviated a danger to which the business was exposed. It is now ascertained that the amount for which the United States shall be in future liable is Ninety thousand five hundred and seventy four Dollars. The sums subscribed to the loan will of course be a charge against the States which respectively issued the bills.  
Remarks on the IIIrd. Proposition  
The payment of Interest and instalments of principal of our foreign debt in the Countries where it was contracted is found by experience to be attended with difficulty, embarrassment, some loss, and a degree of casualty which occasionally puts in jeopardy the National Credit. Loans for reimbursement of principal must be made beforehand as the market suits and necessarily involve double interest for a greater or less time.  
The procuring of Bills to be remitted for payment of Interest cannot be depended upon in coincidence with the periods of payment, which co-operating with distance renders inconvenient anticipations necessary.  
The remitting in commodities would be liable to other casualties and to some peculiar objections; and whatever mode be adopted, it may be frequently not practicable to deposit in season the necessary funds on the spot without great sacrifices.  
If therefore the place of these payments could with consent of the Creditors, upon an equitable indemnification to them for the transfer, be changed to the United States, the operation would be in various lights beneficial. It has occurred that the present posture of the affairs of Europe might favor a plan of this kind and perhaps produce some collateral advantages. Under this idea an experiment is recommended. The proposed augmentation of Interest is intended as an indemnification for the expence and hazard of agencies in this Country, delays in remittance, inconveniencies of distant negociation, renunciation of the facilities which attend the receipt of Interest at home, risks of loss by exchange &amp;c. and is calculated on a liberal scale in order to induce an acceptance of the proposition.  
If instead of an increase of Interest, the option of an equivalent be given by way of premium in Stock bearing an Interest of 5 ⅌ Cent, it would have attractions for certain Creditors and would facilitate the success of the measure. On strict calculation the equivalent would be 6 Dollars and 58 Cents ⅌ 100 Dollars of the principal subscribed.  
It is not perceived that the interests of the United States could suffer by allowing the alternative. The fixing of the rate of Interest by postponing the reimbursement to the year 1818 would also be a powerful inducement: And ’till the period of reimbursement arrives, any surplus of the sinking fund which may exist can be invested in purchases, so as to prevent the progress of the Fund being arrested.  
It could not be necessary to observe, except for the sake of dispelling jealousy or apprehension on the part of the Creditors, that while the plan is in experiment, and afterwards with regard to all who do not embrace it, every thing is to proceed as heretofore and as the contracts respecting the debt require.  
The auxiliary proposition of giving power to the Commissioners of the sinking fund to remit Certificates for sale is founded upon a Belief, that this operation will sometimes be practicable where direct loans cannot be effected, and will be occasionally a more beneficial mode of remittance than by Bills of Exchange.  
Remark on the IVth. Proposition.  
The object of this proposition is to give moral certainty to the adequateness of the fund for paying the interest upon the Debt and for its ultimate Redemption—making a reasonable allowance for the casualties to which it is exposed.  
Remarks on the Vth. proposition  
There is no sentiment which can better deserve the serious attention of the Legislators of a Country than the one expressed in the Speech of the President; which indicates the danger to every Government from the progressive accumulation of Debt.  
A tendency to it is perhaps the natural disease of all Governments; and it is not easy to conceive any thing more likely than this to lead to great &amp; convulsive revolutions of Empire.  
On the one hand, the exigencies of a Nation creating new causes of expenditure, as well from its own, as from the ambition, rapacity, injustice, intemperance and folly of other Nations, proceed in unceasing and rapid Succession. On the other, there is a general propensity in those who administer the affairs of a government, founded in the Constitution of man, to shift off the burden from the present to a future day; a propensity which may be expected to be strong in proportion as the form of the State is popular.  
To extinguish a Debt which exists and to avoid contracting more are ideas almost always favored by public feeling and opinion; but to pay Taxes for the one or the other purpose, which are the only means of avoiding the evil, is always more or less unpopular. These contradictions are in human nature. And the lot of a Country would be enviable indeed, in which there were not always men ready to turn them to the account of their own popularity or to some other sinister account.  
Hence it is no uncommon spectacle to see the same men Clamouring for Occasions of expense, when they happen to be in unison with the present humor of the community, whether well or ill directed, declaiming against a Public Debt, and for the reduction of it as an abstract thesis; yet vehement against every plan of taxation which is proposed to discharge old debts, or to avoid new by defraying the expences of exigencies as they emerge.  
These unhandsome arts throw artificial embarrassment in the way of the administrators of Government; and Co-operating with the desire, which they themselves are too apt to feel to conciliate public favor by declining to lay even necessary burthens, or with the fear of loosing it by imposing them with firmness serve to promote the accumulation of debt; by leaving that which at any time exists without adequate provision for its reimbursement, and by preventing the laying with energy new Taxes when new Occasions of expense Occur. The consequence is, that the public Debt swells ’till its magnitude becomes enormous, and the Burthens of the people gradually increase ’till their weight becomes intolerable. Of such a state of things great disorders in the whole political œconomy, convulsions &amp; revolutions of Government are a Natural offspring.  
There can be no more sacred obligation, then, on the public Agents of a Nation than to guard with a provident foresight and inflexible perseverance against so mischievous a result. True patriotism and genuine policy cannot, it is respectfully observed, be better demonstrated by those of the United States at the present juncture, than by improveing efficaciously the very favourable situation in which they stand, for extinguishing with reasonable celerity the actual debt of the Country, and for laying the foundations of a system which may shield posterity from the consequences of the usual improvidence and selfishness of its ancestors: And which if possible may give Immortality to Public Credit.  
Fortunately for the first object, the circumstances, in our foreign affairs, which during the last session impelled to an extension of the national revenues, have left little more to do than to apply the existing means with decision and efficacy.  
The second object will depend on the establishment of wise principles in that application; fitted to become a permanent precedent in the fiscal system of the Country.  
The first report of the Secretary on the subject of the Public Debt, of the 9th. of January 1790, suggests the Idea of “incorporating as a fundamental maxim in the system of Public credit of the United States, that the creation of Debt should always be accompanied with the means of extinguishment—that this is the true secret for rendering public credit immortal, and that it is difficult to conceive a situation in which there may not be an adherence to the Maxim” and it expresses an unfeigned solicitude that this may be attempted by the United States and that they may commence their measures for the establishment of credit with the observance of it.  
  
Note   It is understood that the Parliament of Great Britain has within the last four Years formally adopted as a Standing rule the principle of incorporating with the creation of Debt the means of extinguishment. How much easier must the execution of this important principle be to the United States than to a Nation, which before it began, had so deeply mortgaged its resources! May the United States never have to regret hereafter that they postponed too long so provident a precaution.  
  
  
No opportunity has been lost by the secretary, as far as he could contribute to the event, to reduce this principle to practice; and important steps towards it have been from time to time taken by the legislature.  
But much remains to be done to give it full effect. The present state of things encourages and invites to the consummation of the plan. And the Secretary about to leave the office he holds feels it a peculiar duty to make a final effort to promote that invaluable end.  
This is the object of the 5th. Proposition aided by the preliminary provisions of the 4th. This proposition aims at two principal points—1   To constitute a fund sufficient in every supposeable event for extinguishing the whole of the present debt of the United States foreign and domestic in a period not exceeding thirty years.  
2   To fix its destination unchangeably by not only appropriating it, permanently under the direction of Commissioners and vesting it in them as property in trust, but by making its faithful application, a part of the contract with the Creditors.  
As to the first point—if the temporary duties on imports be rendered permanent the annual reservation of 600.000 Dollars postponed and if the additional appropriations which are proposed be made to the sinking fund, its intended force will not only be equal to the effect meant to be produced but it may be hoped, that there is scarcely a casualty which can reasonably be taken into calculation, foreign war not excepted, which will occasion a deficiency in the fund.  
  
The whole amount of the duties on imports and Tonnage and upon domestic Distilled Spirits &amp; Stills estimated now to amount to 6079418 Dollars &amp; 58 Cents, besides the dividends on Bank Stock and the items which now compose the sinking Fund will then be appropriated primarily to the Interest upon the public Debt and to the Sinking Fund, which together including the deferred Stock, will demand permanently from that Revenue 4373836 Dollars &amp; three cents little more than two thirds of the Fund from which they arise. An expectation may be indulged, that even foreign war, making due allowance for what will always be practicable through Neutral powers, would not occasion a defalcation in the revenues greater than the difference.  
This competency of the Fund is an essential idea.  
The fulfillment of the object as far as the uncertainty of human affairs will permit ought to be superior to casualty.  
The necessity of a reliance on auxiliary provisions, always precarious in those situations which affect the productiveness of the Public revenues, ought to be as far as practicable superseded by the ample nature of the original provision.  
As to the second point—the Intent is to secure by all the sanctions of which the subject is susceptible an inviolable application of the fund according to its destination. No expedients more powerful can be devised for this purpose, than to cloath it with the character of private property, and to engage absolutely the faith of the Government, by making the application of it to the object a part of the Contract with the Creditors. But is this necessary?  
Its necessity rests upon these cogent reasons.  
The inviolable application of an adequate sinking fund is the only practicable security against an excessive accumulation of debt, and the essential Basis of a permanent national Credit.  
Experience has shewn in Countries the most attentive to the principles of Credit, that a simple appropriation of the sinking fund is not a complete barrier against its being diverted when immediate exigencies press. The causes which have been stated with another view tempt the administrators of Government to lay hold of this resource, rather than resort to new taxes.  
  
This indicates the utility of endeavouring to give by additional sanctions, inviolability to the fund.  
But will those proposed answer the end? They are the most efficacious that can be imagined, and they are likely to be intirely efficacious.  
They cannot be disregarded without, by breach of faith and contract, destroying Credit, and that at a juncture, when it is most indispensable. The Emergences which induce a diversion of the fund, are those in which loans, and consequently Credit, are most needed.  
But will it be safe to put the fund so intirely out of the command of the Government? May there not be situations in which the command of it may be requisite to the safety of the state?  
This is not conceivable. The Amount of the sinking fund will, in the situations which create extraordinary demands for Money be always inconsiderable compared even with a single years expenditure. The current revenues of a nation do not in such cases suffice.  
Plunder or Credit must supply the deficiency. The first presupposes a subversion of all social order. The second will find its best support and greatest efficacy in adhering steadily to the principles of such a Fund. An Annuity of 7 Dollars will pay the Interest upon and discharge a Capital of 100 Dollars bearing 6 ⅌ Ct Interest in 33⅓ years nearly. The situation of a Country must be not a little exhausted, if it cannot create yearly by new Revenues during the continuance of a Foreign War an annuity on the above scale sufficient to fund the Loans of which it may stand in need. Ten Millions of Dollars will with order and œconomy maintain in this Country an Army of 50.000 Men for a year. Viewing our geographical position, is there a prospect of any war expensive beyond this ratio? If not, an annuity of 700.000 Dollars created each year of the War would suffice. But it would be wise in such an event to carry Taxation in the first instance to the full extent of the ability of the State, which would proportionably contract the necessity for borrowing, and consequently the extent of the annuities necessary for loans.  
If a nation can find embarrassment in creating the revenues requisite on this scale, it must arise from her having reached a stage when from the neglect of the principle now inculcated, the mass of her Debt has become so enormous as to strain her faculties in order to a provision for it.  
The United States are in a Situation altogether different. An inspection of the list of their Revenues, discovers that they have a large field of resource unexplored. Their Youth, and large tracts of unsettled Land &amp; land in the infancy of improvement, assure them a great and rapid increase of means. Even their actual revenues without additions, must with the progress of the country considerably increase. And though war may interupt—the temporary interuption being removed by the restoration of peace, their increasing productiveness suspended for a time must resume its vigour and growth. In a given number of years a considerable augmentation is certain.  
The Government of this Country may therefore adopt, fearless of future embarrassment, a principle which being adopted will ultimately furnish resources for future exigencies, without an increase of burthen to the Community.  
To explain this last idea—It will readily be perceived that the funds pledged for paying the Interest and Sinking the principal of a portion of the Debt existing or Created at a particular time will within a certain period extinguish that portion of Debt.  
They will then be liberated and will be ready for any future use, either to defray current expenditures or be the Basis of new Loans, as circumstances may dictate. And after a course of time it is a reasonable presumption that the fund so successively liberated will be adequate to new exigencies as they occur.  
Moreover, the last clause of the proposition authorises the deriving aid from the sinking fund for new Loans, whenever the state of the fund admits of it consistently with the accomplishment of the purposes; that is when it is sufficient 1st. to make good the stipulated payments on account of the principal of the Debt as they accrue. 2nd to purchase in the market all that part of the Public Debt of which there is no stipulation of payment by installment (as the three ⅌ Cent Stock) within a period of 30 Years.  
This, while it secures the extinction of the existing debt within a reasonable term, by preventing too great a proportion of the public revenue from being tied up by the sinking fund, gives due weight to the consideration of providing for future emergencies.  
The same consideration has governed in proposing (instead of the appropriation of a definate Sum out of the revenue from Imports &amp; Tonnage which in certain years would be greater than will be permanently necessary) that the Sum to be applied out of that Revenue shall be so much from year to year as with the other items of the sinking fund will suffice for the object. It has likewise influenced, in postponing the redemption of that Stock which stands to the Credit of certain States in consequence of the report of the Commissioners for the Settlement of accounts.  
Every system of Public Credit must assume it as a fundamental principle, that the resources of the Country are equal to its probable exigencies, and that it will possess ability to pay the debts which it contracts.  
If this be so, there is no cause to hesitate about the inviolable appropriation of funds to the extinction of an existing debt within no less term than 30 Years.  
Indeed as before intimated, it cannot be doubted that the resources of a credit, built upon a foundation so solid as that which is recommended, will more than replace even in the earliest stages of our affairs the use of the additional funds withdrawn from the Command of the Government to effect it, and in the eventual operation will give a more abundant command of funds than it can otherwise have. The successive liberation of the revenues successively pledged, after accomplishing their object, will afford resources that may almost be said to be inexhaustible.  
It should be recollected too, that the public arrangements may, under a great pressure, anticipate the approaching period of such a liberation, by intermediate temporary Loans, to be replaced by those funds when they are free.  
This proposition exemplifies, as to the past, the nature of the maxim which has been supposed capable of giving immortality to credit, namely, that with the creation of debt should be incorporated the means of extinguishment; which means are two fold, the establishing at the time of contracting a debt funds for the reimbursement of the Principle, as well as for the payment of Interest within a Determinate Period—The making it a Part of the Contract that the Funds so Established shall be Inviolably applied to the object.  
It is believed that it would be happy for the United States, if Congress would adopt this principle as a rule in all future Loans, never to be departed from: And a good evidence of this determination will be to apply it [as far as may be,] to the past.  
This would be at the same time an antidote against what may be pronounced the most plausible objections to the system of funding public Debts; which are, that by facilitating the means of supporting expence, they encourage to enterprizes which produce it, and by furnishing in credit a substitute for revenue, likely to be too freely used to avoid the odium of laying new Taxes, they occasion a tendency to run in debt.  
Though these objections to funding Systems, which giving the greatest possible energy to public Credit are a great source of National strength security and prosperity, are very similar to those which speculative men urge against national and individual opulence, drawn from its abuses, and though perhaps upon a careful analysis of facts they would be found to have much less support in them than is imagined, inasmuch as they attribute to those systems effects which are to be ascribed more truly to the passions of men and perhaps to the genius of particular governments; yet as they are not wholly unfounded it is desireable to guard as far as possible against the dangers which they suppose, without renouncing the advantages which those systems undoubtedly afford.  
It will readily be seen that the maxim for making concurrent provision for the principal as well as interest in the act of contracting debt, if by precedent and habit it can be rendered a Rule of Administration, by implicating a greater portion of the revenue in every such operation than would be requisite for a mere provision for interest, will controul proportionably the disposition to defer the burthen to futurity and create a greater necessity for circumspection in incurring expence.  
This is probably the true expedient for uniting a due regard to the present accommodation of the community with a due care not to overburthen posterity—the full energy of public Credit with a salutary restraint upon the abuses of it. To this explanation of the General principles of the Vth. Proposition, it may be proper to add some brief notes on particular parts of it.  
It is proposed that the Redemption of the present 6 ⅌ Ct Stock shall commence the first of January 1796. This time of commencement is recommended by several reasons.  1   It ought to be such as to admit of sufficient notice to distant Creditors.  2   It will conduce to order to date the commencement of every new pecuniary operation where there is an option &amp; no particular reason to the contrary with the commencement of the natural year.  3   The moment of payment presupposes that the fund for the annuity to be paid has actually accrued which will only be at the end of the present year.  4. The small delay by not forcing the means will facilitate the future execution.  
It is a part of the plan to make provision for reimbursing the remaining installments of the two Million loan had of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the act of Incorporation.  
The preceding installments have been reimbursed out of the proceeds of foreign Loans. This resource cannot in future be relied upon; and for such a purpose it is not as eligible as a domestic one, though circumstances have hitherto dictated a recurrance to it.  
By making the dividends on the Stock auxiliary for this purpose to the Revenue from taxes, the object is effected with little more than half the sum from that Revenue, and in the end a fund is formed from the dividends, which with a small addition suffices for the redemption of the deferred Stock.  
As these installments are yearly falling due, and must be paid as they accrue, it is essential that a provision for them be contemplated in the general arrangement requisite to the completion of our system of Credit. There is perhaps no easy alternative to what is proposed, except the sale of the Stock. But waving other weighty considerations against such a measure, it is in the view of a true œconomy, liable to the most solid objections.  
It is morally certain that the dividends on the stock will increase and the value of the capital from this and collateral causes, more than proportionably. There is no momentary urgency to induce the relinquishment of this future advantage.  
To sell at present would be to abandon the difference without necessity. It cannot be expedient in a Government to part with a Capital, which at the time produces as great or a greater revenue than can be realised from the proceeds of a Sale however invested, and which has an inherent tendency to future augmentation.  
The measure too would be to renounce or lessen a most convenient resource for forming the redeeming fund of the deferred Stock.  
It is proposed to carry the proceeds of the Sales of the Western Lands to the sinking fund.  
This is to execute the intention of the funding Act, which has not organised the mode of application and it has the advantage of combining in one system all the provisions for extinguishing the Debt.  
It is proposed that all surplus of Revenue shall at a certain time be carried to the use of the sinking Fund. This is to extend and give effect to a principle which has already received the Legislative sanction. It was necessary to fix a time when the appropriation of the surplus should become absolute, and that this should be consistent with a due opportunity to provide for the exigencies of the Public service.  
Both these considerations have been consulted. The measure has besides reference to a more speedy redemption of the debt than it apears prudent to attempt by an absolute appropriation of more extensive funds. And the Legislators of the present Day wou’d be intitled to the lasting gratitude of their Country, if they would extend this auxiliary resourse, by all the means which are consistant with a due regard to the cotemporary accommodation of their Constituents. It is proposed to authorise the Commissioners of the sinking

r the product of the revenue is more than adequate to an appropriation, yet the receipts upon it come too slowly into the Treasury to answer the end without anticipation by temporary Loans. Its propriety depends on the principle suggested under the last head of having all the means of complete execution organized in the system of Public Credit.  
Remarks on the VIIth. Proposition  
It is a good rule of caution that no more of the public revenues should be rendered permanent, than is necessary to give moral certainty to the provisions which may be regarded as the pillars of public Credit.  
This idea will, it is believed be satisfied by giving permanency to the now temporary duties on Imports.  
Accordingly it is only proposed to extend the duties mentioned in this proposition to the year 1800 and thence to the end of the next ensuing session of Congress, which is on the ground that they ought to be commensurate in duration with the object which they are to accomplish and no more.  
It has been already noticed that they are at present chargeable together with the temporary duties on imports laid in the last session with an appropriation of 1,292,137 Dollars and 38 Cents, and with the interest of one million of Dollars authorized to be borrowed with a view to foreign intercourse, having a special eye to an object very interesting to the Commerce and feelings of the United States.  
This business wants a further arrangement standing at present upon a vague and inefficient footing. The reimbursement of the Loan is not adequately provided for, neither is the interest; this being predicated on funds which in their present form would probably expire after a product of two years. According to the IVth proposition the temporary duties on imports after the above mentioned appropriation of 1,292,137 Dollars and 38 Cents shall have been satisfied will become [permanent and] permanently charged with the Interest on the public Debt, the sinking fund and the annual reservation of 600.000 dollars for the support of Government.  
If the Duties mentioned in this 6th. proposition are continued till the first of January 1800 and the reimbursement of the principal of the loan, as well as the Interest is referred to them, two good purposes will be answered, the obtaining the Loan will be facilitated, and its complete reimbursement will be effected within the term allotted, without an augmentation of the permanent Debt of the Country. This makes allowance for fulfilling the appropriation for the Current service already charged upon this fund.  
It is presumed to be a conclusive reason in favor of the proposition, that it aims at preventing an increase of permanent debt.  
If services of this Kind when the United States are at peace (at least with Civalized powers) are made causes of permanent loans, the progress of new debt will easily exceed the extinction of old.  
It appears desirable that there should be a steady effort, as a rule of administration, not to encrease the permanent Debt of the Country by permanent loans, except when it is inevitable by the existence of a war with some European power.  
The Comparitive view of Revenue and Expenditure (statement F) establishes satisfactorily, that these duties cannot be dispensed with unless there be a Substitute, if the redemption of the Public Debt is to proceed in earnest. And it is believed that there cannot be devised objects of Revenue more proper in themselves, nor more generally acceptable to the people. Whatver interested parties may alledge, it seems self-evident that there can hardly be a reasonable question except as to the best mode of collection. The objection that part of them falls on Manufactures has no weight, The Manufactures on which they fall are complete Luxurys, and completely established; Consequently fit objects of Revenue. The encreased duties on the rival foreign Articles [and the credit allowed for the duties upon the domestic articles] are a full protection

d new appropriations made.  
The designating an Account with a denomination known in the Laws, to which the surplusses are to be carried, will facilitate future Legislative dispositions of the resulting fund.  
It is however essential to the System of public Credit that this should be with the exceptions contained in the proposition.  
Remarks on the IXth. Proposition  
This proposition is calculated to give simplicity to the public Accounts of Stock and Revenue which will conduce to correctness dispatch and œconomy. As the Revenues are manifestly more than adequate to the Claims of all the Creditors, they none of them have any interest in the distinctions that exist, and which grew out of the course of the business; and the rights of none of them will be affected, because all who choose may continue on their former ground by signifying their dissent to the present plan. It is however presumed that there will be no such dissent.  
Remarks on the Xth Proposition  
It is important to the fiscal calculations to ascertain positively the extent of every portion of the public debt. At present the amount of these several items of it is deduced from accounts of the late war of various Officers &amp; Offices—in some instances conducted with little order. There is not therefore sufficient certainty. Indeed it is probable from the length of time which has elapsed without their appearing that the computed amount exceeds the real.  
Besides, they are from their nature subject to forgeries and counterfeits, which implies a danger of loss to the public ’till their circulation is finally terminated. The proposition accordingly, besides the obtaining of better information, aims at obviating this danger.  
Allowing sufficient time for bringing them in to be exchanged for Certificates of equivalent tenor, while it is a measure tending to Public information and security, it can be liable to no reasonable objection on the part of the Creditors.  
  
The Secretary of the Treasury has reserved for the conclusion of this Report a proposition which appears to him of great importance to the Public Credit and which after some preliminary observations will be offered to consideration.  
It relates to the right of taxing the public funds and to that of sequestering them in time of war.  
A proposition on either of these points would have been deemed superfluous, had there never been discussions asserting a right to do the one and the other, and even the expediency of exercising that right. The negative of both the pretensions, from the habit of regarding it as incapable of being disputed, had acquired in the mind of the Secretary so much the force of an Axiom as to have precluded even the mention of the subject in the plan which he originally submitted for funding the public Debt. He should otherwise have thought it an indispensable duty to suggest as a matter of primary consequence to the System of Credit contemplated in the plan, the express renunciation of those pretensions: For they are (as he believes) not only unwarranted by principle or usage, but intirely subversive of the sound maxims of public Credit.  
A pursuasion that this would always be a truth granted in the councils of the United States is his apology for the omission.  
Even now he should think it useless to depart from his silence on the point, had not the discussions alluded to created some alarm in places where all the circumstances are not well understood, which it is the interest of the Country to dispel.  
The confidence justly to be reposed in the collective wisdom of this government forbids the supposition by one acquainted with its constitution, that the security of the Creditor can need in this particular a further sanction. It is presumed to be impossible that any final act can ever give so deep a wound to the national interest and character, as to derogate from a principle which may be placed among the most sacred in the administration of a Government.  
Is there a right in the Government to tax its own funds?  
The pretence of this right is deduced from the general right of the legislative power to make all the property of the State contributory to its exigencies.  
But this right is obviously liable to be restricted by the engagements of the Government; it cannot be justly exercised in contravention of them. They must form an exception.  
It will not be denied, that the general right in question could and would be abridged by an express promise not to tax the funds. This promise indeed has not been given in terms.  
But it has been given in substance. When an individual lends money to the state—the State stipulates to repay him the principal lent, with a certain interest, or to pay a certain Interest indefinitely till the principal is reimbursed, or it stipulates something equivalent in another form. In our case, the Stipulation is in the second form.  
To Tax the funds is manifestly either to take or to keep back a portion of the principal or interest stipulated to be paid. To do this on whatever pretext is not to do what is expressly promised; It is not to pay that precise principal or that precise Interest which has been engaged to be paid.  
It is therefore to violate the promise given to the lender.  
But is not the stipulation to the lender, with a tacit reservation of the general right of the Legislature to raise contributions on the property of the State?  
This cannot be supposed, because it involves two contradictory things; an obligation to do and a right not to do; an obligation to pay a certain sum and a right to retain it in the shape of a Tax. It is against the rules both of Law &amp; reason to admit by implication; in the construction of a contract, a principle which goes in destruction of it.  
The Government by such a construction would be made to say to the lender “I want a sum of money for a national purpose, which all the citizens ought to contribute proportionably, but it will be more convenient to them and to me to borrow the money of you. If you will lend it, I promise you faithfully to allow you a certain rate of interest, while I keep the money, and to reimburse the principal within a determinate period, except so much of the one and the other, as I may think fit to withhold in the shape of a tax.”  
Is such a construction either natural or rational? does it not in fact nullify the promise, by the reservation of a right not to perform it?  
Is it to be presumed without being expressed, that such can be the understanding of a lender, when he parts with his Money to a Government?  
The contrary is so much the more presumable, that nothing short of an express reservation can support the pretention to tax the fund.  
It may be replied, that the Creditor might be willing to rely upon the equity of Government not to abuse its right by exacting from him excessive contributions.  
This, if true, does not obviate the difficulty of supposing the coexistance of an obligation and a right destructive the one of the other; in interpreting the sense of a Contract, when nothing of the Kind is said.  
It is possible that a creditor might be willing so to contract; yet it is still necessary in order to determine that he has done it, to find some provisions or expressions in the Contract indicating the intention; to render what is stipulated Compatible with what is reserved.  
But it is not probable that an individual would be willing to lend upon such terms. He would justly apprehend, that in great emergencies a right having no limit, but the opinion of the party possessed of the power, would be abused, and that the convenience of laying hold of a fund already prepared and at hand supported by a claim of right would be a temptation to abuse, not easy to be resisted. However well disposed to contribute in common with his fellow Citizens on all the ordinary objects of property or income, he would be unwilling to subject himself to a special burthen in the peculiar character of creditor of the State. He would prefer to employ his Money in other ways; even to lend it to private persons, where it might be more likely to escape the hand of the Fiscal Power.  
Let the question be tried by another analysis.  
Public Debt can scarcely in legal phrase be defined either property in possession or in action. It is evidently not the first, till it is reduced to possession by payment. To be the second, would suppose a legal power to compell payment by suit—does such a power exist? The true definition of public debt is a property subsisting in the faith of the Government. Its essence is promise. Its definite value depends upon the reliance that the promise will be definitely fulfilled. Can the Government rightfully tax its promises? Can it put its own faith under contribution? where or what is the value of the debt if such a right exist?  
Suppose the Government to contract with an individual to convey to him a hundred acres of Land upon the condition of paying a hundred Dollars. When he came to pay the 100 Dollars &amp; demand his title, could the Government require of him to pay fifty more as a Tax upon the land, before it would consent to give him the Title? Who would not pronounce this to be a breach of contract, a fraud, which nothing could disguise?  
This case is paralel with that under examination, with circumstances that fortify the right of the lending Creditors. The Government agrees with him, that for 100 Dollars which he delivers to the Government, it will deliver to him at the end of each year six Dollars.  
Here the six dollars to be delivered answer to the land to be conveyed, with this stronger ground of right, that the consideration for them has actually been given and received. Yet when the Creditor comes to demand his Six dollars, he is told that he cannot have them, except with the reservation of one dollar, as a tax upon the six, or that he cannot have them except upon the condition of returning one dollar as that tax? What is this but to say, that his Title to the money in this case, as to the land in the other, must depend upon his paying or allowing a further consideration for it not contemplated in the contract? Can there be a doubt that this also would be a breach of Contract—a fraud?  
The true rule of every case of property founded on contract with the Government is this—  
It must first be reduced into possession, and then it will become subject in common with other similar property to the right of the Government to raise contributions upon it. It may be said that the Government may fulfil this principle by paying the interest with one hand, and taking back the amount of the tax with the other.  
But to this the answer is, that to comply truly with the rule the tax must be upon all the money of the community not upon the particular portion of it which is paid to the public Creditors and it ought besides to be so regulated as not to include a lien of the tax upon the fund. The creditor should be no otherwise acted upon than as every other possessor of money; and consequently the money he receives from the public can then only be a fit subject of taxation, when it is intirely seperated and thrown undistinguished into the common mass. A different practice would amount to an evasion of the principle contended for and to oppression. A Rent or Annuity liable before it passes, or in the act of passing, or at the moment of passing from one proprietor to another, to a deduction or drawback at the pleasure of the party from whom it is to pass is an imaginary thing, destitute both of shape and substance.  
When a Government enters into contract with an individual, it deposes as to the matter of the contract its constitutional authority, and exchanges the Character of Legislator for that of a moral Agent, with the same rights and obligations as an individual. Its promises may be Justly considered as excepted out of its power to legislate, unless in aid of them. It is in Theory impossible to reconcile the two ideas of a promise which obliges with a power to make a Law which can vary the effect of it. This is the great principle, that governs the question, and abridges the general right of the Government to lay taxes, by excepting out of it a species of property which subsists only in its promise.  
There are persons who admitting the general rule conceive a distinction to exist between a tax upon the funds, which must be paid at all events, and a tax upon alienations of them, which will only be to be paid when they are transferred from one to another. The latter they think justifiable, because it is in the option of the Creditor to avoid the Tax by avoiding the alienation. But the difference between the two cases is only a difference in the degree of violation.  
The Stock in its creation is made transferrable. This quality constitutes a material part of its value, and the existance of it is a part of the contract with the Government, which has undertaken itself to conduct the operation of transferring by its own officers and consequently at its own expence. It is as completely a breach of contract to derogate from this quality in diminution of the value of Stock, by incumbering the transfer with a charge or tax, as it is to take back in the same shape a portion of the principal or interest. It is obvious too that this may be carried so far as essentially to destroy the transferrable capacity. But what is a tax upon transfers other than the faculty of taking away from the actual proprietor of Stock a portion of his principal, whenever his interests or his necessities demand a transfer in derogation from the full enjoyment of the right to transfer and from the express promise of the Government to pay him or his alienee? For it is upon the seller, not upon the buyer that such a tax will fall. And where is the substantial difference on the ground of contract between this and a direct tax upon the fund itself. The value of it is as certainly impaired by the one as by the other.  
But shall the proprietor of money in the funds then be exempt from his proportion of the burthens which other Citizens bear?  
This will not be the consequence of the principle. As a consumer of which his income is the instrument, he will pay his proportion of the Taxes on consumption. As a holder of any other species of property procured by that income or otherwise, which is liable to a tax, he must also contribute his proportion.  
But without undue refinement, the lender of money to the Public may be affirmed to have paid his tax when he lends his money. Relying upon the engagement of the government express or implied that he will receive what is promised him, without defalcation, he is content with a less interest than he would take if subject to any such defalcation, and especially if it was to be arbitrary as to its extent. In this lower rate of Interest he may be truly said to pay his Tax or to purchase an exemption from it. Here also we find what is decisive on the point of expediency.  
If the Government had a right to tax its funds, the exercise of that right would cost much more than it was worth. The money lender would exact exorbitant premiums, not only as an indemnification for the use which the Government might probably make of its right, and which in practice would be likely to be qualified by some regard to equality of contribution, but as an equivalent for insurance against the risk or possibility of a more extensive use.  
Hence the Government would be likely to pay much more in premiums upon its loans than it would draw back in Taxes, and the former being supposed but equal to the latter, there would be no advantage in exercising the right.  
But it will be perhaps more safe to affirm that there would be no borrowing at all upon such terms. The first precedent of a tax upon the funds might be expected to compel the Government to an express renunciation of the right in every future loan. Solid capitalists would not be much inclined to adventure their money upon so precarious a footing as is implied in a power of taxing their credits.  
These reflections lead readily to an estimate of the impressions which would be produced by the example of an imposition on the funds. Regarded either as a positive breach of contract, or as a deviation from the maxims of credit, the effect upon it would be nearly equally fatal. Whatever might be excused to a time of revolution, to a defect of means, or to some extraordinary peculiarity of situation—no excuse would be admitted for a deliberate departure from principles; at a time too of National prosperity, in a flourishing State of our finances, after the foundations of a regular system had been laid. The departure would argue an incorrectness, an instability, or a depravity of Views, calculated to give a lasting shock to Credit. The United States must henceforth tread with the most cautious Step.  
A renunciation of the right in future might not speedily heal the wound which an example of its exercise had given. Durable suspicions might fasten on the Wisdom or the integrity of the Government; which might occasion to it no inconsiderable loss and embarrassment before a course of contrary experience could obliterate them.  
The right of a Government to sequester or confiscate property in its funds in time of war involves considerations analogous to these which regard the right of taxing them.  
Whether the foreigner be himself the original lender, or the proprietor of Stock in its constitution transferrable without discrimination, he stands upon equal ground with the Citizen. He has equal claim upon the faith of the Government. In the second case—As the Substitute of the original lender, the promise made attaches immediately upon him. Indeed the certificates which issue upon every transfer, and which may be called the public Bonds, designate him as the Creditor and expressly invest him with the correspondent rights.  
To sequester or confiscate the Stock is as effectually a breach of the contract to pay as to absorb it by a Tax. It is to annihilate the promise under the sanction of which the foreigner became a proprietor.  
But does not the general right of War to seize &amp; confiscate enemy-property extend the property of the Citizens of one nation in the funds of another; the two Nations being at war with each other?  
Resorting to principle as the guide, This question may on solid grounds be answered in the negative.  
The right to seize &amp; confiscate individual property in National Wars excludes all those cases where the individual derives his title from the enemy sovereign or nation: For the right to property always implies the right to be protected &amp; secured in the enjoyment of that property. And a nation by the very act of permitting the Citizen of a foreign country to acquire property within its territory, whether to Lands, funds or to any other thing, tacitly engages to give protection and security to that property and to allow him as full enjoyment of it as any other proprietor; an engagement which no state of things between the two nations can justly or reasonably affect.  
Though politically right, that in wars between nations, the property of private persons which depend on Laws of their own Country, or on circumstances foreign to the Nation with which their own is at war, should be subject to seizure &amp; confiscation by the enemy Nation: Yet it is both politically and morally wrong, that this should extend to property acquired under the faith of the Government and the Laws of that enemy Nation.  
When the Government enters into a contract with the Citizen of a foreign country it considers him as an individual in a state of Nature, and Contracts with him as such. It does not contract with him as the member of another society.  
The contracts therefore with him cannot be affected by his political relations to that society. War, whatever right it may give over his other property, can give none over that which he derives from those contracts. The character, in which they are made with him, the faith pledged to him personally, virtually exempt it.  
This principle which seems critically correct would exempt as well the income as the capital of the property. It protects the use as effectually as the thing. What in fact is property but a fiction, without the beneficial use of it? In many cases indeed the income or annuity is the property itself: And though general usage may controul the principle, it can only be as far as the usage clearly goes. It must not be extended by analogy.  
Some of the most approved Publicists, admitting the principle, qualify it with regard to the income of Lands, which they say may be sequestered “to hinder the remittance of it to the Enemy’s country.”  
But the same authority affirms that a State at War “does not so much as touch the sums which it owes to the Enemy. Every where in case of a war funds credited to the Public are exempt from confiscation and seizure” These expressions clearly exclude sequestration as well as confiscation.  
The former no less than the latter would be inconsistent with the declaration that a State at war does not so much as touch the sums which it owes to the enemy, and that funds Credited to the Public are exempt from seizure. And on full enquiry it is believed, that the suggestion, thus understood, is founded in fact.  
Usage then, however it may deviate in other particulars, in respect to Public funds, concurs with principle

e maxims little more than points of obsolete doctrine. They still retain their rank in Theory; but usage has introduced so many qualifications as nearly to destroy their operation.  
This appears from the acknowledgements of writers, from the barreniss of modern history in examples of the application of those doctrines—from the opinions known to be generally current in Europe—and from a variety of articles which are constant firmulas in the Treaties of the present Century.  
The United States are every way interested in the mitigation of the rigor of the antient maxims of war. They cannot better demonstrate their wisdom than by their moderation in this respect. Particularly interested in maintaining in their greatest purity &amp; energy the principles of Credit, they cannot too strictly adhere to all the relaxations of those maxims which favour the rights of Creditors.  
No temporary advantage can compensate for the evils of a different course of Conduct.  
Credit public and private is of the greatest consequence to every Country. Of this, it might be emphatically called the invigorating principle. No well informed man, can cast a retrospective eye over the progress of the United States, from their infancy to the present period, without being convinced that they owe in a great degree, to the fostering influence of Credit their present mature growth.  
This Credit has been of a mixed nature, Mercantile and public, foreign and Domestic. Credit abroad was the trunk of our Mercantile credit, from which issued ramifications that nourished all the parts of Domestic Labour and industry. The bills of Credit emitted from time to time by the different local Governments which passed current as money co-operated with that resource. Their united force quickening the energies and bringing into action the capacities for improvement of a new Country was highly instrumental in accelerating its growth.  
Credit too, animated and supported by the general zeal, had a great share in accomplishing, without such violent expedients as generating universal distress, would have endangered the issue, that Revolution of which we are so justly proud, and to which we are so greatly indebted.  
Credit, likewise, may no doubt claim a principal agency in that increase of national and individual welfare, since the establishment of the present Government, which is so generally felt and acknowledged, though the causes of it are not as generally understood.  
It is the constant auxiliary of almost every public operation—has been an indispensable one in those measures by which our frontiers have been defended; and it would not be difficult to demonstrate that in a recent and delicate instance, it has materially contributed to the safety of the State.  
There can be no time, no state of things, in which Credit is not essential to a Nation, especially as long as nations in general continue to use it, as a resource in war. It is impossible for a Country to contend on equal terms, or to be secure against the enterprises of other nations without being able equally with them to avail itself of this important resource. And to a young Country with moderate pecuniary Capital and not a very various industry, it is still more necessary than to Countries, more advanced in both; a truth not the less weighty for being obvious and frequently noticed.  
Public Credit has been well defined to be, “a faculty to borrow at pleasure considerable sums on moderate terms, the art of distributing over a sucession of years the extraordinary efforts found indispensable in one, a mean of accelerating the prompt employment of all the abilities of a nation and even of disposing of a part of the overplus of others.”  
  
This just and ingenious definition condenses to a point the principal arguments in favor of public Credit, and displays its immense importance.  
Let any man consult the actual course of our pecuniary operations, and let him then say whether Credit be not eminently useful. Let him imagine the expence of a single campaign in a war with a great European power, and let him then pronounce whether Credit would not be indispensable. Let him decide whether it would be practicable at all to raise the necessary sum by taxes within the year, and let him Judge what would be the degree of distress and oppression which the attempt would occasion to the community. He cannot but conclude that war without Credit would be more than a great calamity—would be ruin.  
But Credit is not only one of the main pillars of the public safety—it is among the principal engines of useful interprise and internal improvement. As a substitute for Capital it is little less useful than Gold or silver, in Agriculture, in Commerce, in the Manufacturing and mechanic arts.  
The proof of this needs no laboured deduction. It is matter of daily experience in the most familiar pursuits. One man wishes to take up and Cultivate a piece of land—he purchases upon Credit, and in time pays the purchase money out of the produce of the soil improved by his labour. Another sets up in trade; in the Credit founded upon a fair character, he seeks and often finds the means of becoming at length a wealthy Merchant. A third commences business as a manufacturer or Mechanic, with skill, but without Money. Tis by Credit that he is enabled to procure the tools the materials and even the subsistence of which he stands in need, ’till his industry has supplied him with Capital; and even then he derives from an established and increased credit the means of extending his undertakings.  
Among the Circumstances, which recommend Credit, and indicate its importance in the whole System of internal exertion and amelioration, it is impossible to pass unnoticed its unquestionable tendency to moderate the rate of interest—a Circumstance of infinite value in all the operations of labour and Industry.  
If the individual Capital of this Country has become more adequate to its exigencies than formerly, ’tis because individuals have found new resources in the public Credit, in the funds to which that has given value and activity. Let Public Credit be prostrated, and the deficiency will be greater than before. Public and private Credit are closely allied, if not inseparable. There is perhaps no example of the one being in a flourishing, where the other was in a bad, state. A shock to public Credit would therefore not only take away the additional means which it has furnished, but by the derangements, disorders distrusts and false principles, which it would engender and disseminate, would diminish the antecedent resources of private Credit.  
The United States possess an immense mass of improveable matter. The developements of it continually going on, may be said to enlarge the field of Improvement, as it progresses: And though the active Capital of the Country has no doubt considerably encreased, it is probable that it does not bear at present a much greater proportion to the objects of employment, than it has done at any former period. Credit, upon this hypothesis, of every kind is nearly as necessary to us now as it ever was. But at least, it may be affirmed with absolute certainty that to a Country so situated, Credit is peculiarly useful and important.  
If the United States observe with delicate caution the maxims of Credit, as well towards foreigners as their own Citizens, in connexion with the general principles of an upright Stable, and Systematic administration, the strong attractions which they present to foreign Capital will be likely to ensure them the command of as much as they may want in addition to their own for every species of internal amelioration. Can it be doubted that they would derive from this, in a course of time advantages incomparably greater than any however tempting, that could partially result from a disregard of those maxims, or from the exercise of a questionable right, which should even appear to derogate from them?  
Credit is an intire thing. Every part of it has the nicest sympathy with every other part. Wound one limb, and the whole Tree shrinks and decays. The security of each Creditor is inseperable from the security of all Creditors. The boundary between foreigner and Citizen, would not be deemed a sufficient barrier against extending the precedent of an invasion of the rights of the former to the latter. The most judicious and cautious would be most apt to reason thus, and would only look for stronger shades of apparent necessity or expediency to govern the extension. And in affairs of Credit, the opinion of the Judicious and cautious, may be expected to prevail. Hence the Government, by sequestering the property of foreign Citizens in the public funds at the commencement of a war, would impair at least if not destroy that Credit, which is the best resource in war.  
’Tis in vain to attempt to disparage Credit, by objecting to it its abuses. What is there not liable to abuse or misuse?  
The precious metals, those great springs of labour and industry, are also the ministers of extravagance, luxury and corruption. Commerce, the nurse of Agriculture and manufactures if over-driven, leads to bankruptcy and distress. A fertile soil, the principal source of human comfort, not unfrequently begets indolence and effeminacy. Even Liberty itself degenerating into licentiousness, produces a frightful complication of ills, and works its own destruction.  
’Tis Wisdom in every case to cherish what is useful and guard against its abuse. ’Twill be the truest policy in the United States to give all possible energy to Public Credit, by a firm adherence to its strictest maxims, and yet to avoid the ills of an excessive employment of it, by true œconomy and system, in, the public expenditures, by steadily cultivating peace, and by using sincere, efficient and persevering endeavors to diminish present debts, prevent the accumulation of new, and secure the discharge within a reasonable period of such as it may be matter of necessity to contract. ’T will be wise to cultivate and foster private Credit by an exemplary observance of the principles of public Credit, and to guard against the misuse of the former by a speedy and vigorous administration of Justice, and by taking away every temptation to run in debt founded on the hope of evading the Just claims of Creditors.  
As an honorable evidence of this disposition, and with a view to quiet the alarms which have been excited, and to silence for ever a question which can never be agitated without serious inconvenience—  
  
The Secretary of the Treasury in the last place respectfully submits—  
That there be an express renunciation by Law of all pretension of right, to tax the public funds, or to sequester at any time, or on any pretext, the property which foreign Citizens may hold therein. This renunciation is the more essential with regard to the object of the third proposition as the Amsterdam and Antwerp loans already include an equivalent stipulation, which they would be unwilling to relinquish without a similar stipulation in the New Loan.  
In the commencement of this Report it was the intention to submit some propositions for the improvement of the several branches of the public Revenue, but it is deemed adviseable to reserve this part of the subject, for a future communication. All which is respectfully submitted.

The SECRETARY of the Thzaevay reſpectfully ale the follrwing  
REPORT, 20 the HouSE of RePprRESENTA TIVES.  
  
HE Preſident of the United States, with that provident concern for  
the public welfare, which characterizes all his conduct, was pleaſed,  
in his ſpeech to the two Houſes of Congreſs, at the opening of the preſent  
ſeſſion, to invite their attention to the adoption of a d:/initive plan for the  
redemption of the public debt, and to the conſummation of whatſoever mayre-  
main unfiniſhed of our Syſtem of Public Credit, in order to place that credit, as far  
as may be practicable, on grounds which cannot be diſturbed, and to prevent that  
5 progreli ve accumulation of debt, which muſt ultimately endanger all government.  
It was at the ſame time very juſtly intimated, that the period which has  
5 clapſed, ſince the commencement of our fiſcal meaſures (now more than  
four years), has ſo far developed our reſources, as to open the way to the im-  
portant work: And it is matter of ſolid conſolation, that the reſult, preſent-  
ing a ſtate of our finances, proſperous beyond expectation, ſolicits the public  
_ councils to enter with zeal and deciſion upon meaſures commenſurate with =  
the greatneſs of the intereſts to be promoted. .  
nder the influence of this conviction, in conformity with the ſuggeſtions  
of the Preſident, and purſuant to the duty which the conſtitution of the de-  
partment, as by law eſtabliſhed, enjoins upon the Secretary of the Treaſury,  
he has employed himſelf in digeſting and preparing the materials of a plan,  
  
  
he now reſpectfully ſubmits them to the conſideration of Congreſs.  
Towards a clear and diſtinct conception of the means neceſſary to the ac-  
  
compliſhment of thoſe ends, it will be uſeful in the firſt Place tc to review * What  
has been heretofore done.  
  
1  
  
„  
  
This will be preſented under three heads. —  
  
1ſt, The revenues which have been eſtabliſhed.  
2d, The proviſions for funding. the debt, and for the payment of i in-  
  
tereſt upon it:  
  
za. The proviſions For reimburſing and extinguiſhing the debt.  
  
The revenues which have been eſtabli ſhed, appear in the following acts.  
  
iſt. © Ana for laying a og; on goods, wares, and merchandizes i im-  
  
ported into the United States.“ Paſſed June the firſt, 1789. &#x27;This Act, as---  
  
its title imports, lays various ſpecific and ad valorem rates on all articles  
  
(with exception of a few, uſeful to agriculture and manufactures), imported  
from foreign countries.—The loweſt ad valorem rate 1s five per cent, with  
  
a diſcount of ten per cent. in favour of our own bottoms. The duration  
aff gned to theſe duties, Was the end of the ſeſſion of Congreſs 1 next  ſucceed-  
ing the firſt day of June, 1796.  
  
2d, „An act impoſing duties on tonnage,* * paſſed the 4000 Joly,” 1789.  
  
This act lays various rates of duty on the tonnage of ſhips and veſſels en-  
  
tered in the United States from foreign countries, and in certain caſes | in one  
  
: part of the United States from another.  
  
Its duration was indefinite, no limit having been aſſigned.  
  
3d. An act impoſing duties on the ene of ib and veſſels, , paſſed  
July 20th 1790.  
This act is a ſubſtitute for the one laſt 3 preſerving the ſame  
rates of duty, but applying them in ſome inſtances une.  
It is, like the former, of indefinite duration. . .  
Ath. An act making further proviſion for the payment of che debts of  
the United States.” Paſſed Auguſt roth, 1790.  
This act repeals, after the laſt day of December, 1790, the iet on im-  
£ ported articles, laid by the act above cited, and ſubſtitutes new and generally  
increaſed rates, ſpecific and ad valorem, ꝛFH„ &amp; ae 5 5  
The loweſt ad valorem rate in this, as in the former act, Is &quot;Gus per cent.  
but the number of articles to which it applies is much narrowed, and inſtead  
of a diſcount in favour of our own bottoms, an addition of ten per cent.  
1s made to the diſadvantage of foreign bottoms.  
  
The number of free articles is ſomewhat extended, in a further encourage-  
ment of agriculture and manufactures. —  
  
  
ry I  
It is declared that the duties laid by this act ſhall continue i the debts and  
purpoſes to which they are appropriated, ſhall bz ſatisfied, reſerving however  
a right to Congreſs to ſubſtitute other duties or taxes of equal value.  
. An act to incorporate the ſubſcribers to the bank of the United  
States,” &#x27; paſſed the 25th of February, 179:.  
The ſecond ſection of this at authoriſes the Prelldent to aul a ſubferip-  
  
  
the amount of 2,000,000 of dollars, and, with a view to the accompliſhment  
of that object, to borrow of the bank 2, 000 ,000 of dollars, to be reimburſed  
in ten equal yearly inſtalments. 1  
  
The difference between the intereſt payable on the loan ind the divideads  
on the ſtock conſtitutes an item of annual 1 income to the United States—lt is

tofore laid upon diſtilled ſpirits imported from abroad, and laying others in

ment. |

payments into the treaſury on account of old debts, but theſe arc too cafual,  
and of too little magnitude to be more than curſorily mentioned.

equal every reaſonable expectation.  
The proviſions for funding the debt and for paz ment of intereſt upon i it  
are comprized in the following acts.  
  
1ſt, An act making proviſion for che debt of the United States,” _  
Paſſed Auguſt 14th, 1790,  
  
This act commonly called the FUNDING ACT contains theſe . pro-  
viſions, VIZ... |  
  
  
common defence, the yearly ſum of 600,000 dollars, |  
  
  
4 3  
which ſhovld afterwards be contracted for diſcharging the arrears of in-  
tereſt, and the principal of antecedent foreign loans, to continue ſo appro-  
priated till the debt conſtituted by thoſe loans ſhould be fully diſcharged.  
zd. It authorizes the Preſident to borrow any ſum or ſums not exceed-  
ing 12,000,009 of dollars, to diſcharge the arrears of intereſt upon, and the  
inſtallments of the principal of the foreign debt, due and to grow due ;—  
and if t be effefted on advantageous terms to pay off the whole of that debt; ;  
and further authorizes him to make ſuch other contracts reſpecting it as  
ſhould be found for the intereſt of the United States, ſo that no engage-  
ment or contract ſhould preclude from reimburſing the ſums borrowed  
within fifteen years, after they ſhould be borrowed.  
1V. In order to adapt the form of the domeſtic debt to the circum-  
ſtances of the United States, as far as ſhould be found practicable &#x27; 66 conſiſt- |  
_ ently with good faith and the rights of the creditors,” which it wy de-  
clares, „could only be done by a voluntary loan on their part,” it pro-  
poles a loan to the United States (directing for that purpoſe books for ſub-  
icriptions to be opened at the treaſury, and by commiſſioners of loans i in the  
ſeveral ſtates, on the iſt of October, I 790, and to continue for one year),  
the ſums ſubſcribed to the loan, to be paid in certain enumerated evidences |  
5 of the debt of the United States, upon theſe terms, viz.  
iſt. That the intereſt unpaid on the principal of theſe evidences ſhould ;  
he computed up to the laſt of December, 1790. T  
2d. That for any ſum ſubſcribed and paid in principal of the debe, 55  
fubferiber ſhould be entitled to one certificate for a ſum equal to two-thirds  
of the ſum ſubſcribed, bearing an intereſt of ſix per centum per annum,  
commencing the firſt day of January 1791, payable quarter yearly, and  
  
  
both of principal and intereſt, eight dollars upon a hundred of the original  
ſum ſo ſubſcribed and paid; and to another certificate for a ſum equal to  
the remaining third of that ſum, which after the year 1800 ſhould bear a  
like intereſt, payable in like manner, and ſubject to a like rate of redemp-  
tion; but that the United States though having a right to Ld in the  
above mentioned proportion, ſhould not be obliged to do it.  
  
3d. That for any ſum ſubſcribed and paid in the ot of the debt,  
  
the ſ ubſcriber mould be entitled to a certificate for a ſum equal to the ſum  
  
69  
  
© ſubſcribed, bearing an intereſt of three per centum per annum from the  
ſaid laſt day of December, 1790, payable quarter oy. and redeemable  
  
at pleaſure by payment of the principal.  
  
4th. That the new ſtock created by the ſaid own mould be trans ferable  
on the books upon which the credit for it ſhould ſtand by the proprietor, or  
his attorney, theſe books to be either thoſe kept for the purpoſe by the  
treaſury, or by commiſſioners of loans in the reſpective ſtates, a mode being  
  
  
55 That the intereſt ſhould be payable whereſoever the credit for the  
Rock ſhould exiſt when the payment of intereſt ſhould become due, except  
that the dividend of intereſt for any quarter of a year, which ſhould not be  
demanded before the expiration of a third quarter thould after! wards be de-  
mandable only at the treaſury.  
9th. That for the regular payment of the intereſt | on the ſeveral kinds  
of ſtock to ariſe from the loan as it ſhould accrue, including that which is |  
deferred, the proceeds of the public revenues, which before that time had  
been, or during the then ſeſſion ſhould be provided, after reſerving yearly  
600, ooo dollars for the ſupport of the government of the United States, and  
their common defence, and fuch ſum as ſhall be neceſſary for payment of in; rereft  
on the foreign loans before mentioned, ſhould be and thereby were pledged and  
appropriated till the final redemption of the capital flock.  
. Premiſing that ſome of the creditors of the United States might not  
think fit to become ſubſcribers to the loan, this act declares that“ nothing  
contained in it ſhould be conſtrued 2 any Wi iſe to alter, abridge, or mpair  
the rights of thoſe creditors of the United States who ſhould not ſubſcribe  
to the loan, or the contratts upon which their claims are founded, but that  
the ſaid contracts and rights ſhould remain in full force and virtue?“ and to  
obviate all idea of compulſion on the creditors to ſubſcribe, it allows. to  
nonſubſcribers, during the pendency of the loan, and until the end of the  
year 1791, a rate per centum on their reſpective demands, equal to that .  
which is paid to ſubſcribing creditors ; ; on the ſole condition that the evi-  
dences of debt holden by them, except thoſe which had been iſſued by the  
regiſter of the treaſury for the regiſtered debt, ſhould be exchanged for  
other certificates, ſpecifying the ſpecie amount of thoſe in exchange for  
  
which they were How: and otherwiſe of the like tenor with thoſe which  
  
C19  
had theretofore been iſſued by the regiſter of the treaſury for the regiſtered  
debt ; ſtating as the grounds of this condition that ſome of the certificates  
then in circulation had not been liquidated to ſpecie value, that moit of  
them were greatly ſubject to counterfeit, that counterfeits had actually taken  
place in numerous inſtances, and that embarraſſment and impoſition might  
  
attend the payment of intereſt on theſe certificates i in their then form.  
VI. This act likewiſe propoſes another loan to the amount of 21,500,000  
dollars, payable in the principal and intereſt indifcriminately of the eviden-  
ces of debt of the reſpective ſtates according to certain quotas; ; to be con-  
ducted in the ſame manner, and to be open for the ſame time, as that | in the :  
domeſtic debt of the United States. 5  
The terms of this loan to be

uary, 1791—To another certificate for a ſum equal to two ninths of the  
laid ſubſcribed ſum, bearing an intereſt after the year 1800 of lix per cen-  
tum per annum, and to a third certificate for a ſum equal to three ninths of  
the ſaid ſubſcribed ſum, bearing an intereſt of three per centum per annum,  
commencing on the ſame 1ſt day of January, 42901. The intereſt in each  
caſe to be payable in like manner, aad to be ſubject to the like redemption  
as that on the correſpondent kinds of ſtock, to be created by the ſaid firſt  
mentioned loan, and the ſtock to be created by che ſecond loan to be trans  
Ferable on the ſame principles, and | in the { ſame modes as that produced by ”  
the former.  
2d. That for the regular payment of intereſt on hs foal Mo of Fa  
Kock to ariſe from this loan as It ſhould accrue, including that which i 75 ”  
ferred, the proceeds of the public revenues which before that time had  
been, or during the then ſeſſion ſhould be provided, after reſerving the  
aforeſaid yearly fum of 600,000 dollars, the fun neceſſary for payment of i in-  
tereſt on the foreign loans made and to be made, and the fum neceſſary for Pay-  
ment of intereſi on the loan in the domeſtic debt; ſhould be, and thereby were  
pledged and appropriated, to continue ſo pledged: and aer. until _  
the jinal redemption of the capital flock.  
VII. To ſecure the due e application of f theſe x revenues s according | to FR |  
  
( It |  
appropriations, an account of them is directed to be kept diſtinct from that  
of the proceeds of any other revenues, except ſuch as ſhould be raiſed to make  
good a deficiency in thoſe: and the faith of the United States is pledged to  
appropriate additional and permanent funds for ſatisfying ſuch deficiency,  
VIII. The proceeds of the ſales of lands in the weſtern territory, then be-  
longing, or which thereafter ſhould belong to the United States, are pledg-  
ed and appropriated for the diſcharge of the debts which the United States  
then owed, or by virtue of that act ſhould owe.  
  
There are ſeveral collateral and ſupplementary proviſions, which are  
omitted as immaterial to the intended view of the ſubject. Sn

This act which, as has been before noticed, increaſed permanently the du-  
ties on certain imported articles, and laid a temporary additional duty on  
ſome others, appropriates primarily the proceeds of the permanent augmen-  
tation in the ſame manner, and to the ſame purpoſes as the antecedent duties  
were appropriated, that is, in conformity with the funding act.  
IV. * An act concerning the duties on ſpirits diſtilled within the United  
| States. „ paſſed May 8th, 1792 „

cember, 1794, which being placed to their credit reſpectively, ſhall bear an  
: intereſt of three per centum per annum from the period laſt mentioned. | _  
  
It further directs, that the intereſt on the principal balances to be funded |  
agreeably: to the terms of the act for the ſettlement of accounts, together with

quarterly yearly after the laſt day of L December, 1794, at the ſame epochs in  
each year at which intereſt is payable on the other parts of the funded debt :  
to which end ſo much of the proceeds of the duties on imports and tonnage  
as may be neceſſary, and as were not ot herab. iſe previouſly appropriated, are ap-  
propriated; and the faith of the United States is pledged to provide for any  
- deficiency which may happen by additional and x permanent funds.  
There are ſeveral acts which prolong from time to time the ſubſeriptions ;  
in the domeſtic and ſtate debts, on the ſame terms as by the funding act;  
| thoſe in the domeſtic debt b being continued down to the laſt day of December,  
1794 which acts, together with the acts particularly cited, compriſe all  
thoſe that relate to the funding of the public debt, and the payment of intereſt  
thereupon. The reſult of theſe acts is exhibited in the tables ABC and D,  
which ſhew the amount of the foreign debt, that of the funded debt, the pro-  
bable amount of that which remains unfunded, of what compoſed, and the  
annual amount of intereſt upon the different portions ot debt according t to .

plication of the ſurplus revenue to that object will not only contribute to

Theſe ſums would complete the redemption of the whole; amount t of the.

| demption in each caſe was begun; within which terms, they would diſ-  
charge the whole of the public debt, encept the emen dt debt, the nnlubſcribed  
debt, and the three per cent. ſtock. — :  
If the redemption of the preſent fix per cent. ſock commence hy firſt of

et free in the year 1824, for operations upon the reſidue of the public debt,  
if any remain, will be 998,307 dollars and ꝗ cents. 8 5  
The revenue, ſet free by theſe ſucceſſive redemptions, would be ſuffftient  
to redeem the whole of the preſent foreign debt in ſix years, that is, within  
a term of 28 years from the propoſed time for commencing the redemption,  
or the 1ſt of January, 1796 ; and, after extinguiſhing the foreign debt, would  
more than diſcharge the whole of the balances to creditor fates, and the  
whole of the unfunded debt in two years more.  
If the proceeds of the lands in the weſtern territory ſhould be equal to  
three millions of dollars, and the three per cent. ſtock can be purchaſed at an  
average of twelve ſhillings in the pound, that fund would ſuffice to pay off

unredeemed transferable ſtock, commencing the firſt of January, 1796, as to  
that bearing a preſent intereſt of ſix per centum; and the firſt of January,  
1802, as to that bearing a future intereſt of fix per centum; and, if the pro-  
= ceeds of the ſales of weſtern lands, ſhould prove equal to 3,000,000 of dol-  
lars, and can be brought into action, for purchaſes of the three per cent.  
ſtock at the rate above-mentioned, at any time before the year 1801, the whole  
of the preſent debt of the United States, foreign and domeſtic (the funds ap-  
= Propriated, being during the whole period adequate in Productiveneſs, and  
irnviolably applied), would be extinguiſhed in thirty years; and there would  
  
then revert to the United States an annual income of + 53 &amp;; 228 dollars and |

| REMARKS upon the iſt Propoſition.  
  
The experiment has now been fully tried, and with nearly complete ſuc-  
ceſs, of the diſpoſition of the Public Creditors to accept the terms offered by  
the funding at. Thoſe who ſtil] decline have probably made a final election  
to abide by their original contracts.  
It remains to fulfil them as to the future, This the moral obligation of  
the contracts, the new and peremptory ſanction given to them by the preſent  
Government, and the eſſential maxims of Public Credit unite to demand:  
And while theſe cogent motives, affecting intimately the permanent cha-  
  
  
| there 1 is now no longer any inducement from ſituation to procraſtinate.  
  
5 The preſent advanced ſtate of the National Finances, and the inconſider-  
able magnitude of the ſtill un ſubſcribed debt, render it of little, if of any,  
  
| conſequence to obtain upon it the temporary accommodation of deferring the  
Payment.” of a part of the intereſt accruing according to contract. This  
  
motive apart, and conſidering the approximation of the period when. the  
  
payment of intereſt on the deferred debt is to commence, the chance of be-  
  
nefiting by a fall of the market rate of intereſt incident to a proviſion for the  
  
  
may be found more advantageous to the Government, than the partial poſt-  
ponement of intereſt incumbered with an | abridgement of the right of re-  
demption. : | 5  
10 thoſe who ſhould not rightly appreciate this circumſtance, it might  
  
1 an objection, that the proviſion propoſed would place thoſe conditors  
who had not conſented to accommodate the government upon : a better toot-  
  
  
But a ſcruple of this kind i is over-ruled by ſeveral confide erations—1ſt, It is  
not improbable that a conſiderable proportion of thoſe ho may not have  
accepted the terms offered by the funding act, are executors and other trul-  
tees who may have doubted their power to accept. |  
2d. Giving the fulleſt force to the fact which is the doit of the objec-  
| tion, it is one of thoſe caſes in which the general principles that conſtitute  
— the permanent happineſs of ocicty, give the leſs meritorious advantages over  
  
1  
the more meritorious All the Creditors had a right to conform or not  
Thoſe who have not done it have only uſed their right, and it cannot be  
matter of objection or prejudice to them To delay indefinitely a proviſion  
for their claims according to the contract, is to annihilate the contract.  
  
The complying Creditors cannot with propriety complain: — They were  
informed unequivocally that the propoſal of a new loan was referred to their  
free choice, that the rights of thoſe who did not aſſent would remain unim-  
  
paired, and compenſations were offered in the new contracts for the ſurren- |  
der of the 01d.—A plea that an ultimate proviſion was not relied upon could  
not be admitted, —becauſe it would be to convert a diſtruſt of the faith of  
the Government into an OR. againſt its being obſerved towards thoſe  
who had depended upon it.  
But the complying Crediors. actually received valuable conſiderations for  
the modification of their elaims: Inſtead of annual proviſion for their intereſt,  
which alone their contracts as they ſtood previous to the funding act re-  
quired, they have had it ſecured by adequate funds * mortgaged  
5 for its payment.  
Inſtead of the ſtipulated annuity being redecmable at pleaſure whenever a  
fall i in the market rate of intereſt ſhould render it advantageous to pay off the  
principal, it has acquired a more fixed character by the relinquiſhment of the  
  
  
pacity to increaſe in capital value, by a declenſion of the market rate of  
  
intereſt—Inſtead of receiving their intereſt in one payment at the end of a  
year, they receive it in N yearly portions, which makes i itin fact 6. I 15  
  
per centum.  
  
  
of i its faith by the Government, it is indifferent to the Creditor whether his  
demand ſtands upon the baſis of an annual a provifieu, or upon that of mort-  
gaged funds, 3  
This is to ſubſtitute * to fact. -As well: with regard to a ; Govern=  
ment as to an individual, there is in the nature of things an mtrinfic differ- _  
ence between the value of a debt bottomed on mortgaged funds, and that of a  
debt reſting on what is called in the one caſe, and may be called in the other,  
  
  
„  
  
ſtances on which it depends, may be different in two caſes, but the reality  
  
of its exiſtence can be denied in neither.  
  
Government being adminiſtered by men is naturally like individuals,  
| ſubject to particular inputs; paſſions, prejudices, vices; of courſe to in-  
conſtancy of views and mutability of conduct. 1 1  
  
A kind of property, of which the eſſence is contract, muſt neceſſarily  
therefore be more or leſs valuable, becauſe more or leſs ſecure, in propor-  
tion as it is little or much within the influence of that inconſtancy or that  
mutabilſty.  
  
If a proviſion is to be made by a a new v reſolution every year, that reſolution  
being always liable to be effected by momentary circumſtances is always ca-  
ſual. If made once for all, it continues, of courſe, unleſs revoked by ſome  
  
poſitive act, and has for that reaſon a moral certainty of ſtability. But why,  
it may be aſked, if a diſpoſition unfaithful to the public engagements, or  
  
_ unfriendly to public credit ſhould exiſt; would it not operate to produce a  
violation of a proviſion made as well as to prevent the making of ne?”  
  
The two things are widely different. To undo, which is to ac, and in  
  
ſuch a caſe to act with violence, requires more enterprize and vigour, and  
  
pre- -ſuppoſes greater energy, or a ſtronger impulſe than n0f to do, or to  
forbear to act. This is particularly true where a number of wills is to  
  
  
reſponſibility of doing miſchief by poſitive acts, will readily enough ſlide  
into it by a negative conduct, that is, by omitting to act. Many men,  
us merely from eaſineſs of temper, or want of active fortitude, will ſuffer evil to  
take place, which they neither deſire, nor would themſelves commit. In  
. collective bodies votes are neceſſary to ACTION, abſences may e -  
  
  
toa reſolution to undo or reverſe a thing once done, which there would not  
be a majority of voices 70 (o. | £7  
This reaſoning acquires tenfold force whe applied to a complex. govern- |  
  
  
through different organs, which muſt concur to give it motion; as in our  
_ Conſtitution the Houſe of Repreſentatives, the Senate, and the Preſident.  
In delicate and difficult caſes, whether to iſſue in good or ill, a ſuſpenſion

happen, that all the branches or parts of it can be infected at one time with  
a common paſſion or diſpuſition, manifeſtly inimical to juſtice, and the  
public good; as to proſtrate the public credit by revoking a pledge given to  
the Creditors. It is far more probable that ſuch a diſpoſition ſhould at one  
time poſſeſs one part, at another time another part. Poſſeſſing either part it  
might be ſufficient to obſtruct a proviſion which was to be made. Without  
poſſeſſing all the parts, it could not ſubvert one which had been made. The  
laſt can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed, except in one of thoſe. extraordinary criſis of  
nations which confound all ordinary calculations.  
Hence the value of property in public debt, which caſts on ſpecified and 8  
competent funds, firmly pledged tor the ſatisfaction of the Creditor, is in-  
trinſically greater, and to a conſiderable extent, than rhat of property in  
public debt which depends on annual proviſion.  
Hence too, a Creditor to whom ſuch a pledge was not ſtipulated, may  
be juſtly ſaid to have received a compenſation for the relinquiſhment ot.” *  
portion of his intereſt. erg 1  
On the ſecond colnet. it has been. obſerved with leſs plauſibility, that i =  
  
this country where it would be to the advantage of the Creditor to receive  
-- ties principal rather than a rate of ſix per cent. intereſt, the abridgement of  
the right of redemption i is of no value.  
1ſt The propoſition is not univerſally true.  
It depends on the particular ſituation of a Creditor, whether it be TY -  
intereſt to be reimburſed his principal or not. It is believed, owing to the  
LE impunctuality of collections, that in no part of the United States does fair 5  
lending at private 1 intereſt upon real ſecurity nett ſix per cent. .  
24. As far as it is true, it does not authoriſe the inference which is.  
drawn: | Becauſe the Creditor cannot demand his principal when Ut: ſuits  
  
  
convenience might not exiſt till there was a fall in the market rate of intereſt, |  
and then it would not be the intereſt of the Creditor to receive. Unable to  
exact the principal when he pleaſes, it is a material point gained to be able  
to arreſt the hand of the Government from paying him, when it is his in-  
tereſt not to receive. . EE  
  
It is evident that whenever the rate of el to which he is inet ſhall 2

or take the market rate, his ſtock ul a in value in proportion to the dif-  
ference, and the degree of its duration.  
Nor is an idea which has been entertained just, that this advantage 18  
remote and contingent ; to accrue only to thoſe who may be holders at the  
time of the fall of intereſt, at the expence of thoſe who were holders when  
the funding act paſſed ; many of whom, as is alledged, having been obliged  
to alienate, then or ſhortly after, ſuffered Joſs in the ſale, from the poſtpone-  
ment of a part of rheir intereſt, 8 benefiting by the ſuppoſed equi-  
valents. | |  
The fairneſs of an equivalent ought never to be teſted by the neceſſities of _  
| ical individuals Alt ought to be eſtimated by the general principles of  
value; by the natural and real operation of things. Admitting therefore the  
ſuggeſtion as to ſuch individuals to be true, it would decide nothing.  
Blut it is not true. The permanency of a high rate of intereſt and poſſibi-  
lity of a future riſe of the capital above par, by a fall of the market rate  
below the ſtipulated rate, were to the firſt holders of the ſtock circumſlances  
of preſent value.  
Foreigners, eſpecially, whoſe purchaſes would neceſſarily influence the  
market, would give higher prices for it on theſe accounts.  
And when. to this are added the funding of the new ſtock, and the payment  
of the intereſt quarter yearly—there is ſolid ground for entertaining an  
  
  
This opinion would be confirmed, if we ſhould take as a guide What  
actually happened in one or more of the States, which made annual proviſion  
for the payment of intereſt upon their debts at the ſtipulated rate of ſix per  
cent. With this proviſion the market price of the: r ſock rarely exceeded 5  
  
  
It is probable that greater confidence in the ability and conſtancy 4 views  
of: the Government of the United States might have given greater value to  
  
  
  
| would bave felt, in a great degree, a ſimilar effect of that ſitua-  
  
(46 3  
  
This may not appear with reſpe&amp; to the /ma/l amount of unſubſcribed  
debt now to he provided for, and at. the advantage of a confirmation of  
confidence by experience. But it could not have failed to have been very ap-  
parent, if the whole debt had been provided for on this plan.  
  
&quot;Theſe obſervations ſerve to render it probable that the Creditors who  
have accepted the terms offered by the Government have not been injured 1  
  
  
will have no cauſe to be diſſatisfied with the propoſals under conſideration.  
  
  
by that propoſal than the ſubſcribers, it is the intereſt of all the public  
creditors upon principle and 5 that the public faith ſhould be ot  
  
  
But at the ſame time, every conſideration connected with the queſtion  
urges that nothing more ſhould be done for non-ſubſcribers than is poſi-  
tively due to good faith—Accordingly the propoſition contemplates that :  
their debt ſhall not be funded, but that proviſion ſhall be annually made.  
With regard to arrears of intereſt a tenth part only 1 is propoſed to be paid  
  
  
y ears. |  
&quot;I rictncls.: they ought to hs e diſcharged, tie to bus PERS

ſent moment, obſtruct arrangements which are conducive to the general i In.  
  
  
which is the preſent caſe, is liable to ſome peculiar conſiderations. =  
The ſtate of the Treaſury in ſucceeding years will enable Congreſs to de-  
  
  
fund them at three per cent. as has been done generally with regard to in-  
Eo or eo To bh  
A difference is made in the ſpecial caſe of the Loan Office Certificates _  
  
„  
  
which by contract are intitled to an intereſt of fix per cent, on the nominal  
Paper redeemable only by payment of the ſpecie principal.  
  
I This is too diſadvantageous a footing for the Government. -  
  
The alternative moſt convenient at preſent is to pay off the Debt which  
  
is propoſed. To elude this contract would be to ſacrifice a very great prin-  
  
ciple to a very little intereſt. The amount will be ſeen in the ſtatement A.  
REMARKS on the IId Propoſition.  
  
i The Certificates, or bills of Credit, called New emiſſion Money, were  
emitted purſuant to a reſolution of Congreſs of the 18th March 1780,  
  
  
bear an intereſt of five per centum per annum, payable in ſpecie at the  
redemption of the bills, or at the election of the Holder, annually at the  
  
Continental Loan Offices, in Rterling bills drawn by the United States upon their  
  
  
payment of the ſaid Bills, 22 caſe any State on whoſe funds they ſhould be  
emitted ſhould by the events of war be rendered incapable to redeem them; di-  
  
  
United States inſure the payment of the within Bill, and will draw Bills of  
Exchange for the intereſt annually if demanded, according to a reſolution  
| of Congreſs of the 18th of March 1780. — m —  
  
| Theſe reſolutions, and the indorſement upon the Wille&quot; 6 engage the abſolute  
  
promiſe of the United States for the payment of the intereſt indefinitely,  
and their eventual gurantee of the principal, in caſe any State on whoſe.

REMARKS. on the 1 1d Propoſition. NT  
  
T he payment of intereſt and inſtalments of principal of our foreign debt  
in the countries where it was contracted is found by experience to be at-  
tended with difficulty, embarraſſment, ſome loſs, and a degree of caſualty  
which occaſionally puts in jeopardy the National Credit. Loans for reim-  
  
  
neceſſarily involve double intereſt for a greater or leſs time. :  
The procuring. of Bills to be remitted for payment of intereſt cannot be |  
| depended upon in coincidence with the periods of payment, which, co  
: operating with diſtance, renders inconvenient anticipations neceſſary.  
  
  
ſome peculiar objections; and whatever mode ,be adopted, it may be fre-  
  
quently not practicable to depoſit in ſeaſon the neceſſary funds on the Tot  
without great ſacrifices, |  
If therefore the place of theſe payments could with AERO of the Op  
ditors, upon an equitable. indemnification to them for the transfer, be  
  
  
419  
  
neficial.—It has occurred that the preſent poſture of the affairs of Europe  
might favor a plan of this kind, and perhaps produce ſome collateral ad-  
vantages. Under this idea an experiment is recommended. -The propoſed  
augmentation of Intereſt is intended as an indemnification for the expence  
and hazard of agencies in this Country, delays in remittance, inconvenien-  
cies of diſtant negociation, renunciation of the facilities which attend the  
receipt of Intereſt at home, riſks of loſs by exchange, &amp;c.—and is calcu-  
| lated on a liberal ſcale in order to induce an acceptance of the propoſition.  
If inſtead of an increaſe of Intereſt, the option of an equivalent be given  
by way of premium in ſtock. bearing an Intereſt of five per cent. it would  
have attractions for certain Creditors, and would facilitate the ſucceſs of the  
meaſure. On ſtrict calculation the equivalent would be 6 dollars and 58  
cents. per 100 dollars of the principal ſubſcribed. -  
It is not perceived that the intereſts of the United States could mut by  
allowing the alternative. The xing of the rate of intereſt by poſtponing  
the reimburſement to the year 1818 would alſo be a powerful inducement:  
And *till the period of reimburſement arrives, any ſurplus of the ſinking  
fund which may exiſt can be inveſted in purchaſes, o as to . the  
| progrets.: of the Fund being arreſted. f  
It could not be neceſſary to obſerve, except for the fake of Apel  
5 jealouſy or apprehenſion on the part of the Creditors, that while the plan  
is in experiment, and afterwards with regard to all who do not embrace it,  
every thing is to proceed as heretofore, and as the contracts reſpecting the  
debt require. 7  
The auxiliary propoſition of giving power to the Comemitliontns of the  
finking fund to remit Certificates for ſale, is founded upon a belief, that that

REMARKS on the Vth. Propoſition.  
  
: Phone 1 is no ſentiment which can better deſerve the ſerious attention of the  
Legiſlature of a Country than the one expreſſed in the Speech of the Preſi-  
dent; which indicates the danger to every government from the progreſſive  
accumulation of Debt. Ls  
A tendency to it is perhaps the NATURAL DISEASE of all Goveraments ; 25  
and it is not eaſy to conceive any thing more likely chan this to lead to 8  
great and convulſive revolutions of Empire. ;  
On the one hand, the exigencies of a Nation creating n new cauſes WA ex- Ny  
penditure, as well from its own, as from the ambition, rapacity, injuſtice,  
intemperance, and folly of other Nations, proceed in unceafing and rapid  
ſucceſſion.— On the other, there is a general propenſity i in thoſe who admi-  
niſter the affairs of Government, founded i in the Conſtitution of man, to  
  
ſhift off the burden from the preſent to a future day; a propenſity which  
may be * to be ſtrong i in Proportion as the form of the Rate | is &quot;= 5  
pular. | 5 .  
To extinguiſh a Debt which exiſts, and to auld contracting more, are  
  
  
| Taxes for the one or the other purpoſe, which are the only means of  
  
  
their own popularity, or to ſome other ſiniſter account.  
Hence it is no uncommon ſpectacle to ſee the ſame men  clamouring for  
occaſions of expence, when they happen to be in uniſon with the preſent  
humour of the community, well or ill directed. declaiming againſt ; a Pub-  
  
  
againſt every plan of taxation which is propoſed to diſcharge old debts, or  
5 to avoid new by defraying che expences of cxigencies as they emerge.  
| Theſe unhand ſome arts throw artificial embarraſſment in the way of the  
Adminiſtrators of Government; and co-operating with the deſire, which  
they themſelves are too apt to feel, to conciliate public favor by declining Ro  
to lay unneceſſary burthens, or with the fear of loſing it by impoſing them  
  
  
1  
which at any time exiſts without adequate proviſion for its reimburſement,  
and by preventing the lay ing with energy new Taxes where new occaſions  
of expence occur. The conſequence is, that the Public Debt ſwells till its  
magnitude becomes enormous, and the Burthens of the people gradually in-  
crease till their weight becomes intolerable. Of ſuch a ſtate of things great  
diſorders in the whole political Oy, convulſions and revolutions of  
| Government are a natural offspring. |  
There can be no more ſacred obligation, then, on the public Agents of a  
Nation, than to guard with provident foreſight and inflexible perſeverance a-  
5 gainſt ſo miſchievous a reſult. True patriotiſm and genuine policy cannot,  
it is reſpectfully obſerved, be better demonſtrated by thoſe of the United  
States at the preſent juncture, than by improving efficaciouſſy the very favor-  
able ſituation in which they ſtand, for extinguiſhing with reaſonable celerity  
the actual debt of the Country, and for laying the foundations of a ſyſtem  
which may ſhield poſterity from the conſequences of the uſual improvidence :  
and ſelfiſhneſs of its anceſtors :—And which, if poſſible, may give IMMOR-  
TALITY to PuBL1c CRRDIr. FD 1 8  
Fortunately for the firſt object, the circumſtances, in our foreign. affairs, 5  
which, during the laſt ſeſſion, impelled to an extenſion of the national reve-  
nues, have left little more to do than to opply the exiſting means with deci-  
ſion and efficacy.  
The ſecond object will ad. on the eſtabliſhment of wiſe e in  
that application; fitted to become a a permanent Procetlent 3 in the Alen l-  
tem of the Country.  
The firſt report of the ly on the ſubject of the Public Debt, of the  
gth of January 1790, ſuggeſts the Idea of incorporating as a fundamental  
maxim in the SVS TEM of PusLic CREDIT of the United States, that the  
creation of” Debt ſhould always be accompanied with the means of extinguiſhment 5  
E that this is the true ſecret for rendering public credit immortal, and that  
it is difficult to conceive a ſituation in which there may not be an adherence  
to the Maxim—and it expreſſes an unfeigned folicitude that this may  
  
be attempted by the United States, and that they may commence their mea-  
ſures for the eſtabliſhment of credit with the obſervance of it.“  
  
  
  
( 42 )  
  
No opportunity has been loſt by the Secretary, as far as he could contri-  
bute to the event, to reduce this principle to practice ; and important Reps |  
towards it have been from time to time taken by the Legiſlature.  
But much remains to be done to give it full efet—The preſent ſtate of  
things encourages and invites to the conſummation of the plan. And the  
Secretary, about to leave the office he holds, feels it No as oy to make a  
final effort to promote that invaluable end.  
  
This is the object of the «th Propoſition, aided by the preliminary p provi-  
  
  
conſtitute a fund ſufficient, in every ſuppoſable event, for extinguiſhing the.  
whole of the preſent debt of the United States, foreign and domeſtic, in a pe-  
riod not exceeding thirty years.---2. To fix its diſtination unchangeably  
by not only appropriating it permanently, under the direction of Commiſ—  
ſioners, and veſting i it in them as property in truſt, but by making i its faithful  
application, @ part of the contract with the Creditors.  
As to the firſt point—if the temporary duties on imports be rendered per- =  
manent, the annual reſervation of 600,000 Dollars poſtponed—and if the  
additional appropriations | which are propoſed be made to the ſinking fund,  
its intended force will not only be equal to the effect meant to be produced ;  
  
  
be taken into calculation, fore gn \ war not excepted, which will occaſion a de-  
ficiency in the fund.  
  
The whole amount of the duties on imports and tonnage, and upon 5. |  
mettic Diſtilled Spirits and Stills, eſtimated. now to amount to 6 079, 418  
  
  
which now compoſe the ſinking Fund, wall then be appropriated primarily  
  
  
gether, including the deferred Stock, will demand permanently from that  
Revenue 4,373,839 Dollars and three cents; little more than two thirds of  
the fund from which they are to ariſe. An expectation may be indulged,

ticable throu gh Neutral powers, would not occaſion a defalcation i in the reve-  
nues greater than the difference.  
  
This competency of the fund is an eſſential idea,  
The fulfilment of the object, as far as the uncertainty of human affairs will  
permit, ought to be ſuperior ro caſualty.  
The neceſſity of a reliance on auxiliary proviſions, always precarious in  
thoſe ſituations which affect the productiveneſs of the public 1 revenues, ought  
to be, as faras practicable, e * the ample nature of the original  
  
  
As to the ſecond point—the i intent is to ſecure, by all the ſanRions af which  
the ſubject 1 is ſuſceptible, an inviolable application of the fund according to its  
deſtination. No expedients more powerful can be deviſed for this purpoſe,  
  
than to cloath it with the character of phrivate property, and to engage abſo-  
  
lutely the faith of the Government, by making the application of it to the  
  
object a part of the contract with the Creditors. But is this e  
  
Its neceſſity reſts upon theſe cogent reaſons 580  
  
The inviolable application of an adequate linking fund, is the only Prace  
ticable ſecurity againſt an exceſſive accumulation of debt, and the eſſential  
baſis of a permanent national credit,  
  
Experience has ſhewn, i in countries moſt attentive to the principles of cre-  
dit, that a ſimple appropriation of the ſinking fund is not a complete barrier  
againſt its being diverted when immediate exigencies preſs, The cauſes  
which have been ſtated with another view, tempt the adminiſtrators of go  
vernment to lay hold of this reſource, rather than to impoſe new taxes.  
  
This indicates the utility of endearouring to give, by additional ſanQions,  
  
inviolability to the fund. .  
  
But will thoſe propoſed anſwer the end ? They are the moſt efficacious  
that can be imagined ; ; and they are likely to be entirely efficacious.  
They cannot be diſregarded without, by breach of faith and contract,  
flirt credit, and that at a juncture, when it is moſt indiſpenſable; the  
emergencies which induce a diverſion of the tund, are hole! in which loans,  
and conſequently credit, are moſt needed.  
But will it be ſafe to put the fund ſo entirely out of the command of the  
government? May there not be ſituations, in which the command of it may  
be requiſite to the ſafety of the ſtate? 5  
G2  
  
( 44 )  
  
This is not conceivable, The amount of the ſinking fund will, in the  
fituations which create extraordinary demands for money, be always incon-  
ſiderable, compared even with a ſingle year&#x27;s expenditure, The current re-  
venues of a nation do not in ſuch caſes ſuffice. TE”  
  
Plunder or credit muſt ſupply the deficiency. Fg eg ny  
  
The firſt pre-ſuppoſes a ſubverſion of all ſocial amber. The ſecond will  
  
4 its beſt ſupport and greateſt efficacy, in adhering ſteadily to the principles  
  
of ſuch a fund. An annuity of ſeven dollars will pay the intereſt upon, and  
  
diſcharge a capital of one hundred dollars, bearing ſix per cent. intereſt in  
thirty-three and one-third years nearly. The ſituation of a country muſt be  
not a little exhauſted, if it cannot create yearly, by new revenues, during the  
continuance of a foreign war, an annuity on the above ſcale, ſufficient to  
fund the loans of which it may ſtand in need. Ten millions of dollars will,  
with order and ceconomy, maintain in this country an army of 50, ooo men  
for a year. Viewing our geographical poſition, i is there a proſpect of any  
  
  
created each year of the war, would ſuffice. But it would be wiſe in ſuch  
an event, to carry taxation, in the firſt inflance, to the full extent of the ability  
of the ſtate, which would proportionably contract the neceſſity for borrow-  
ing, and conſequently, the extent of the annuities neceſſary for loans.  
If a nation can find embarraſſment in creating the revenues requiſite on  
this ſcale, it muſt ariſe from her having reached a ſtage when, from the ne-  
glect of the principle now inculcated, the maſs of her debt has become ſo  
enormous as to ſtrain her faculties, i in order to a proviſion for it.  
The United States are in a ſituation altogether different. An inſpection of =  
the liſt of their revenues diſcovers that they have a large field of revenue un-  
explored. Their youth and large tracts of unſettled land, and land in the  
infancy of improvement, aſſure them a great and rapid increaſe of means.—  
Even their actual revenues without additions, muſt with the progreſs of the  
country, conſiderably increaſe. And though war may interrupt—the tem-  
porary interruption being removed by the reſtoration of peace, their increaſive  
productiveneſs ſuſpended for a time muſt reſume its vigour and growth.  
In a given number of years a conſiderable augmentation is certain. .  
Ihe government of this country may therefore adopt, fearleſs of future  
embarraſſment, a principle which being adapted will ultimately furniſh  
  
( 45 )  
reſources for future exigenoies, without an increaſe of burthen to the com-  
| munity.  
  
To explain this laſt 0 will readily be parecived that the funds  
pledged for paying the intereſt, and ſinking the principal of a portion of the  
debt exiſting or created at a particular time, will, within a certain period, ex-  
  
tinguiſh that portion of debt.  
  
They will then be liberated, and will be ready for any tue ute; either to  
  
defray current expenditures, or be the baſis of new loans, as circumſtances  
may dictate; and after a courſe of time it is a reaſonable preſumption that  
the funds ſo ſucceſlively liberated will be adequate to new exigencies as  
  
they occur.  
  
Moreover the laſt clauſe of the propoſition authoriſes the deriving aid from  
the ſinking fund for new loans, whenever the ſtate of the funds admits of it  
conſiſtently with the accompliſhment of the purpoſes; that 1s, when it is  
ſufficient. 1ſt. To make good the ſtipulated payments on account of the  
principal of the debt as they accrue. 2d. To purchaſe in the market  
  
all that part of the public debt of which there is no ſtipulation ot --  
  
payment by inſtalment (as the three per cent. ſtock) within 4 period of  
30 years.  
This, while it ſecures the extintiog of the exiſting debt Within a reaſon- :  
  
  
being tied up by the ſinking fund, gives due weight to the conſideration of  
providing for future emergencies,  
: The ſame conſideration has governed in propoſing (inflead of the appro-  
priation of a definite ſum out of the revenue from i imports and tonnage which,  
in certain years, would be greater than will be permanently neceſſary), that  
  
the ſum to be applied out of that revenue ſhall be ſo much from year to year,  
as with the other items of the ſinking fund will ſuffice for the objects. It  
has likewiſe influenced, in poſtponing the redemption of that ſtock which  
ſtands to the credit of certain ſtates i in conſequence of the report of the com-  
  
miſſioners for the ſettlement of accounts.  
  
ork Every ſyſtem of public credit muſt aſſume it as a Münddfietitär principle,  
that the reſources of the country are equal to its probable exigencies, and  
  
= that it will poſſeſs ability to pay the debts which It contracts. *  
  
1 6 )  
If this be ſo, there is no cauſe to heſitate about the inviolable appropria-  
tion of funds to the extinction of an 1 exiſting debt within! no leſs term than  
  
thirty years.  
Indeed, as before intimated, it cannot be doubted that the 8 of 4  
  
  
more than replace, even in the earlieſt ſtages of our affairs, the uſe of the ad-  
ditional funds withdrawn from the command of the government to effect it,  
and in the eventual operation will give a more abundant command of fund  
that it can otherwiſe have. The ſucceſſive liberation of the revenue ſuc-  
ceſſively pledged, after accompliſhing their N Will afford reſources that  
” may almoſt be ſaid to be inexhauſtable.  
It ſhould be recollected too, that the public arrangements may, under 2 |  
great preſſure, anticipate the approaching period of ſuch a liberation, by in-  
  
_ termediate temporary loans to be I en by thoſe funds when they | are  
eee,  
  
which has been ſuppoſed capable of giving immortality to credit, namely,  
that with the creation of debt ſhould be incorporated the means of extinguiſh-  
ment; which means are two fold, the eſtabliſhing at the time of contratting a  
debt, funds for the reimburſement of the PRINCIPAL, AS well for the payment  
of INTEREST within a DETERMINATE PERIOD, The making Kt APART  
of THE CONTRACT, that FUNDS 80 ESTABLISHED ſhall be INVIOLABLY  
applied to the object. |  
Re (tf believed that it would be hw for the United States, if 8  
would adopt this principle as a rule in all future loans, never to be departed  
from; and a good evidence of this determination will be to N it, as far as  
may be, to the paſt.  
  
This would be at the fame time an antidote 3 what may be pronounced 5  
  
  
  
enterpriſes which e e it, and by furniſhing in credit a ſubſtitute for re-  
venue, likely to be too freely uſed to avoid the odium of Ig new taxes,  
they occaſion a tendency to run in debt. :  
  
Though theſe objections to funding ſyſtems, which giving *the 9 f  
poſſible energy to public credit, are a great ſource of national ſtrength, ſecuri-  
  
C47 3 5  
ty, and proſperity, are very ſimilar to thoſe which ſpeculative men urge  
againſt national and individual opulence, drawn from its abuſes; and though  
  
perhaps upon a careful analyſis of facts they would be found to have much  
leſs ſupport i in them than is imagined, inaſmuch, as they attribute to thoſe  
  
  
and perhaps to the genius of particular governments; yet, as they are not  
wholly unfounded, it is deſirable to guard as far as poſſible againſt the dan-  
gers which they ſuppoſe, without renouncing the advantages which thoſe _  
ſyſtems undoubtedly afford, It will readily be ſeen that the maxim for  
  
making current proviſions for the principal, as well as intereſt, in the act of  
  
  
ADMINISTRATION, by implicating a greater portion of the revenue in every  
ſuch operation than would be requiſite for a mere proviſion for intereſt, will  
  
  
create a greater neceſſity for circumſpection in incurring expence.  
This is probably the true expedient for uniting a due regard to the preſent  
  
  
terity, the full energy of public credit, with a falutary reftraint upon the  
abuſes of it. - 1 5 5 |  
To this explanation of the general principles of the Vth. propoſition, i it  
may be proper to add ſome brief notes on particular parts of i I -  
It is- propoſed that the redemption of the preſent fix per cent. ſtock ſhall  
: commence the firſt of January 1796. This time of commencement is  
  
  
Aft. It ought to be ſuch as to admit of ſufficient notice to the diſtant

contrary, with the commencement of the natural year.

2 nl theſe inſtalments are yearly falling due, and muſt be paid as they  
accrue, it is eſſential that a proviſion for chem be contemplated in the general  
arrangement requiſite to the completion of our ſyſtem of credit. There is,  
perhaps, no eaſy alternative to what 1s propoſed, except the ſale of the

It is propoſed that all ſurplus of revenue ſhall, at a certain time, be carried to  
the uſe of the ſinking 1 fund. This is to extend and give effect to a principle  
which has already received the legiſlative lanction; ; it was neceſſary to fix a

This idea will, it is believed, be ſatisfied ON giving permanency to the  
now temporary duties on Imports.  
Accordingly it is only propoſed to extend the duties mentioned in Wine pro-  
poſition to the year 1 800, and thence to the end of the next enſuing ſeſſion of _  
| Congrels which is on the ground that they ought to be commenfurate 1 in  
duration with the objects which they are to accompliſh, and no more. :  
It has been already noticed that they are at preſent chargeable, together  
with the temporary duties on imports laid in the laſt ſeſſion with an appro-  
priation of 1,292, 137 dollars and 38 cents. and with the intereſt of one  
million of dollars authorized to be borrowed with a view to foreign inter-  
courle, having a ſpecial eye to an object very intereſting. to the commerce  
and feelings of the United States. 8 5  
This buſineſs wants a further arrangement, ſtanding at preſent upon a  
vague and inefficient footing. The reimburſement of the loan is not ade-  
quately provided for, neither i is the intereſt ; this being predicated on funds,  
which, in their preſent form, would probably expire after a product of two  
  
  
after the above · mentioned appropriation of 1,291,137 dollars and 38 cents.  
ſhall have been ſatisfied, will become permanent, and permanently charged  
  
with the intereſt on the public debt, the ſinking fund, and the annual reſer-  
vation of 600,000 dollars for the ſupport of government.  
  
If the duties mentioned i in the 6th propoſition are continued till the firſt of  
January 1800, and the reimburſement of the principal of the loan, as well  
as the intereſt, is referred to them, two good purpoſes will be anſwered, the  
; obtaining the loan will be facilitated, and its complete reimburſement will a  
be effected within the term allotted, without an augmentation of the perma-  
nent debt of the country. This makes allowance for ruling: the Wppropri-  
ation for the current ſervice already charged upon this fund.  
  
1t is preſumed to be a concluſive W in favour of the propoſition that  
it aims at preventing an increaſe of permanent debt. 1 7 &lt;ls  
If ſervices of this kind when the United States are at peace (at leaſt with  
civilized powers) are made cauſes of permanent loans, the progreſs of new  
debt will eaſily exceed the extinction of old.  
It appears deſirable that there ſhould be a ſteady effort. 40 4 rule 97 dk

loans, except when it is inevitable by the exiſtence of a war with ſome

The comparative view of revenue and expenditure (ſtatement F) eſtabliſhes  
ſatisfactorily, that theſe duties cannot be diſpenſed with, unleſs there be a  
ſubſtitute, if the redemption of the public debt is to proceed in earneſt; and

This oropotien.&#x27; is calculated to give ſimplicity to the public accounts of  
  
  
nomy. As the revenues are manifeſtly more than adequate to the claims of  
  
all the creditors, they none of them have any intereſt in the diſtinctions that  
exiſt, and which grew out of the courſe of the buſineſs; and the rights of  
  
none of them will be affected, becauſe all who chooſe may continue on their

It i is important to the fiſcal calculations to aſcertain poſitively the extent bf  
every portion of the public debt. At preſent the amount of zhe/e ſeveral  
items of it is deduced from accounts of the late war of various officers and  
offices; in ſome inſtances conducted with little order; there is not, there-  
fore, ſufficient certainty. Indeed, it is probable from the length of time  
which has elapſed without their appearing, that the computed amount |  
exceeds the real. | TT  
| Beſides, they a are, from their nature, ſubject | to forgeries and counterfeits,  
which implies a danger of loſs to the public till their circulation is finally  
terminated. The propoſition. accordingly, beſides the obtaining of better  
information, aims at obviating this danger. .  
Allowing ſufficient time for bringing them in to be exchanged for certifi- -  
cates of equivalent tenor, while it is a meaſure tending to public information :

The Secretary of the Treaſury has reſerved for the concluſion of this

be abridged by an expreſs promiſe not to tax the funds. This promiſe,  
indeed, has not been given in terms but it has been given in ſubſtance.  
When an individual lends money to the ſtate, the ſtate ſtipulates to repay 8  
him the principal lent, with a certain intereſt, or to pay a certain intereſt  
indefinitely, till the principal i is reimburſed ; or it ſtipulates ſomething equi-  
valent in another form. In our caſe, the ſtipulation is in the ſecond  
form. ST :  
To tax the funds is irn either to tale or to keep back a 892105 of the  
principal or intereſt /tipulated to be paid. To do this, on whatever pretext,  
is not to do what is expreſsly promiſed. It is not to pay that preciſe principal,  
--0 that preciſe intereſt, which has been engaged to be paid.  
It is therefore to violate the promiſe given to the lender.  
But is not the ſtipulation to the lender, with a tacit reſervation of the ge-  
ol right of the legiſlature to raiſe contributions on the N of the  
| ſtate ?-  
1 cannot be ſuppoſed, becauſe it involves two Sede 65  
an obligation to do, and a right not to do; an obligation to pay a certain ſum,  
and a right to retain it in the ſhape of a tax. It is againſt the rules both of  
law and reaſon to admit by implication, in the conſtruction of Aa contract, a  
principle which goes in deſtruction of it. |  
The government, by ſuch a conſtruction, would be made to ſay to the  
lender: — . I want a ſum of money for a national purpoſe, which all the  
citizens ought to contribute proportionably, but it will be more convenient  
to them and to me, to borrow the money of you ; if you will lend it, I pro-  
miſe you faithfully to allow you a certain rate of intereſt, while 1 keep the  
money, and to reimburſe the principal, within a determinate period; 3 except  
  
  
4 44x.  
Is ſuch a conſtruction either natural or rational? Does it not in fa nullify |  
he promiſe, by the reſervation of a right not to perform . 1  
  
Is it to be preſumed without being expreſſed, that ſuch can be the under- :  
| Nanding of a lender, when he parts with his money to a government?  
  
The contrary is ſo much the more preſumable, that nothing ſhort of an  
expreſs reſervation can ſupport the pretenſion to tax the fund. =  
  
It may be 1 that the creditor might be willing to rely upon the  
  
E  
  
equity of government not to abuſe its right by exacting from him exceſlive  
contributions.  
  
This, if true, does not obviate the difficulty of ſuppoſing the co-exiſtence  
  
  
: the ſenſe of a contract, when nothing of the kind 1 is ſaid.  
It is poſi ble that a creditor might be willing ſo to contract, yet it is ſtill

TPhis cafe is parallel with that under examination; with circumſtances that

| this ſtronger ground of right, that the conſideration for them has actually  
been given and received, yet when the creditor comes to demand his ſix  
dollars, he is told that he cannot have them, except with the reſervation of ”  
one dollar, as a tax upon the fix, or that he cannot have them except upon  
the condition of returning one dollar as that tax? What is this but to ay, -  
that his title to the money in this caſe, as to the land i in the other, muſt de-  
pend upon his paying or allowing a further conſideration for it, not contem

that to comply truly with the rule, the tax muſt be upon all the money of the  
community, not upon the particular portion of it which is paid to the public  
creditors; and it ought, beſides, to be ſo regulated, as not to include a lie  
of the tax upon the fund. The creditor ſhould be no otherwiſe acted upon =  
than as every other poſſeſſor of noney; and conſequently the money he receives  
from the public, can then only be a fit ſubject of taxation, when it is entirely

But it will be perhaps more fafs to affiem that ths would be no atom. 1  
  
  
(3067)  
  
&#x27; Theſe refletions lead readily to an eſtimate of the impreſſions which  
would be produced by the example of an impoſition on the funds—Re-  
garded either as a poſitive breach of contract, or as a deviation from the  
maxims of credit, the effect upon it would be nearly equally fatal—What-  
ever might be excuſed to a time of revolution, to a defe&amp; of means, or to  
ſome extraordinary peculiarity of ſituation no excuſe would be admitted  
for a deliberate departure from principles; at a time too of National proſ-  
perity, in a flouriſhing ſtate of our finances, after the foundations of a re-  
gular ſyſtem had been laid. The departure would argue an incorrectneſs,  
an inſtability, or a depravity of views, calculated to give a laſting ſhock to  
credit; the United States muſt, henceforth, tread with the moſt cautious  
ſep.  
  
A renunciation of the right, in future, might not ſpeedily heal the wound,  
which an example of its exerciſe had given. Durable ſuſpicions might  
faſten on the wiſdom or the. integrity of the government ; which might oc-  
  
caſion to it no inconſiderable loſs and embarraſſment, before a courſe of  
contrary experience could obliterate them.  
The right of a government to ſequeſter, or confiſcate property in its  
funds, in time of war, involves conſiderations analogous to thoſe which re-  
gard the right eee,  
Whether the foreigner be, himſelf, the original lender: or the proprietor  
of ſtock, in its conſtitution transferable without diſcrimination, he ſtands  
upon equal ground with the Citizen—he has an equal claim on the faith of  
the government. In the ſecond caſe, as the ſubſtitute of the original lender,  
the promiſe made attaches immediately upon him. Indeed, the certificates  
which iſſue upon every transfer, and which may be called the public bonds,  
. deſignate him as the creditor, and expreſely inveſt him with the correſpon-  
dent rights. 5  
1 ſequeſtrate, or cc date the ſtock, is as effeclually a breach of the  
contract to pay, as to abſorb it by a tax: It i is to annihilate the promiſe, un-  
der the ſanction of which. the foreigner became a proprietor.  
But does not the general right of war, to ſeize and confiſcate. enemy  
property, extend to property of the citizens of one nation in the funds of  
another—the two nations being at war with cach other?  
  
12  
  
  
Reſorting to belnelp as the guide, this queſtion may, on a ſolid grounds,  
be anſwere l in the negative. |  
  
The right to ſeize, and confiſcate, individual property in national wars,  
excludes all thoſe caſes where the individual derives his title from the ene-  
my, ſovereign, or nation: For the right to property alway Simplies the right  
  
to be protected and ſecured in the enjoyment of that property: And a  
  
nation, by the very act of permitting the citizen of a foreign country to  
  
acquire property within its territory, whether to lands, funds, or to any  
other thing, tacitly engages to give protection and ſecurity ro that property,  
and to allow him as full enjoyment of it as any other proprietor ; an en-  
gagement which no ſtate of things between the two nations can juſtify.  
Though politically right, that in wars between nations, the property of  
private perſons which depend on Jaws of their GWN country, or on circum-  
fances foreign to the nation with which their own 1s at war, ſhould be ſubject  
to ſeizure, and confiſcation, by the enemy nation: Vet it is both politically  
and morally wrong, that this ſhould extend to property acguired under the  
faith of the government, and the laws of that enemy nation.  
When the government enters into a contract with the citizen of a foreign g  
country, it conſiders him as an individual, in a flate of nature, and contracts  
with him as ſuch. It does not contract with him as the member of another  
| feciety—the contracts, therefore, with him, cannot be affected by his politi-  
cal relations to that ſociety. War, whatever right it may give over his  
other property, can give none over that which he derives from thoſe con-  
tracts —the character in which they are made with bim, the faith pledged  
to him perſonally, virtually exempt it.  
  
This principle, which ſeems critically correct, would exempt as well  
the INCOME, as the CAPITAL of the property. It protects the uſe, as  
effectually as the thing. What, in fact, is property, but a fiction, with-  
out the beneficial uſe of it? In many caſes, indeed, the income or annuity  
is the property itſelf; and, though general uſage may controul the princi-  
ple, it can only be as far as the uſage clearly goes — It muſt not be extended  
by analogy. =  
Some of the moft — publicitts, admitting the principle, qualify it =  
with regard to the income of lands, which they ſay muy be E «to  
hinder the remittance of it to the enemy&#x27;s country. .

touch the ſums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in caſe of a  
war, TOs credited to the public, are exempt from confiſcation and sEI-  
ZURE.” | Theſe expreſhons clearly exclude ſequeſtration, as well as confiſ-  
cation.  
  
The former, no folk than the latter; would be inconfiftent with the de-  
  
  
owes to the enemy; ; and that funds credited to the public, are exempt from

portance in the whole ſyſtem of internal exertion and amelioration, it is im-  
poſſible to paſs, unnoticed, its unqueſtionable tendency to moderate the rate  
of intereſt—a circumſtance of infinite value in all the operations of labour  
and induſtry.  
If the individual capital of this country has become more adequate to its  
exigencies than formerly, &#x27;tis becauſe individuals have found new reſources  
in the public credit, in the funds to which hat has given value and activity.  
Let public credit be proſtrated, and the deficiency will be greater than before.  
Public and private credit are cloſely allied, if not inſeperable there is, per-  
haps, no example of the one being in a flouriſhing, where the other was in  
a bad, ſtate, A ſhock to public credit would, therefore, not only take away  
the additional means which it has furniſhed, but, by the derangements, dif-  
orders, diſtruſts, and falſe principles which it would engender and diſſemi-  
8 would diminiſh the antecedent reſources of private credit.  
The United States poſſeſs an immenſe maſs of improveable matter — tlie  
developements of it, continually going on, may be ſaid to enlarge the field  
of improvement as it progreſſes: And, though the active capital of the coun-  
try has, no doubt, conſiderably increaſed, it is probable that it does not bear,  
at preſent, a much greater proportion to the objects of employment, than it  
has done at any former period. Credit, upon this hypotheſis, of every kind,  
is nearly as neceſſary to us now, as it ever was — But, at leaſt, it may be  
affirmed, with abfolute certainty, that to a country 10 ſituated, credit i 18 =  
5 N uſeful and important.  
If the United States obſerve. with delicate caution the maxims of credit, as  
well towards foreigners as their own citizens, in connexion with the general  
principles of an upright, ſtable, and ſyſtematic adminiſtration, the ſtrong at-  
  
  
the command of as much as they may want in addition to their own for every  
ſpecies of internal amelioration—Can it be doubted that they would derive  
from this, in a courſe of time, advantages incomparably greater than any  
however tempting, that could partially reſult from a diſregard of thoſe max-  
ims, or from the exerciſe of a queſtionable right, which thould even 1 appear  
  
to derogate from them ?  
  
Credit is an entire thing. Every part of it has the niceſt ſympathy with  
ce xery other part. Wound one limb, and the whole Tree ſhrinks and decays.  
  
„ .  
The ſecurity of each creditor is inſeparable from the ſecurity of all Creditors—  
The boundary between foreigner and citizen would not be deemed a ſufficient  
  
  
former to the latter—The moſt judicious and cautious would be moſt apt

following report of the Secretary ot the Trea­  
sury upon the fubjeift—which has never been  
adled upon.  
&quot; The certiScates or bills of credit called new  
emission money were emitted pursuant to a refe-*  
lution of congress of the 18th March 1780,  
which dircfts ihem to be emitted upon the funds  
of individuals states, to bear an interest of five  
per «entum per annum, payable in the  
redemption of thebills, or at the e&#x27;eflion of the  
holder, annually at the continental lean offices, in  
Jierl.ng bills drawn by the United Stares upon  
their commissioners in Europe, and pledges the  
faith of the United States lor the payment of  
the said bills, in ease any Jtate tn whafe funds  
theyjkould be emitted Jhould by the events of rjsar  
be rendered incapable to redeem them ; directing  
also aa endorsement to be made on each till in  
tbefe words &quot; The United States insure the pay  
ment of she within bill and will draw bills of  
exchange for the interest annually if demanded,  
according to a resolution of congress of the 18th  
of March 1 fto.&quot;  
These resolutions and the endorsement upon  
the bills engage the promife of the U­  
nitrd States for the payment of the interest in­  
definitely, and their eventual guarantee of the  
principal, in cafe any fla&#x27;es on whnfe  
funds the bills should be emitted (hould by the&#x27;  
•verts of war be rendered incapable to redeem  
them&lt;;—which is in tftd, though not in form&gt;  
an abfolnte guarantee of the principal ; for the  
United Statts are bound t&#x27;.- ppy the intertft ptr­  
r pet Haltj nil that is discharged.  
Good faith demasda that the United States  
, fliould supply the omiiTions of the Rates which  
I iflued the bills, by providing themfelves,atleaft  
for th* interest upon them. _  
But it is not as eaiy to pronounce on whtt  
terms they outfit to be provided for.  
On their face, and according to the unrevoke  
ed resolutions of congress, they are of specie  
[ value equal to their nominal amount and bear­  
ing five-per cent interest.  
But it is kcown, thaj they were ifued by dif­  
ferent states at different inferior values fixed by  
previous laws&#x27;  
1 The true nature of the contrail therefore, in  
■ faS, and the true equity of the cafe, are from  
1 these circumstances involved iti fonne question,  
A compromise by a new agreement seems the  
best road out of the difficulty.  
This i» the aim «f the propofition.-f&#x27; which it  
r is hoped will in the main reasonably consult all  
&#x27; intereils  
) There have been fpeeial references of this  
1 fubjedl to the Secretary ; but he purposely de­  
clined a report till the expiration of the tern  
£ limited by the ail entitled&#x27; &quot;An a&amp; relative to  
claims against ihe United States not barred by\
any a&amp;aflimitation &amp; which hav® not been alrea­  
dy adjufled&quot; gaffed the 11th of February 1793,  
bad obviated a danger to which the business was  
s txpeled :—lt is now ascertained that the amount  
, for which the United States shall be in future  
liable is ninety thousand five hundred andfeven­  
ty-four dollars. The sums fubferibed to the  
loan, will of course be a charge against the  
states which refpeAivelyifiucd the biils.

Credit, public and private, is of the greatest consequence to every coun-  
try. Of this it might be emphatically called the invigorating principle. No  
well-informed man can cast a retrospective eye over the progress of the  
United States, from their infancy to the present period, without being con-  
vinced that they owe, in a great degree, to the fostering influence of credit,  
their present mature growth. This credit has been of a mixed nature, mer-  
eantile and public, foreign and domestic. Credit abroad was the trunk of our  
mercantile credit, from which issued ramifications that nourished all the parts  
of domestic labor and indusiry. The bills of credit emitted, from time to  
time, by the different local governments, which passed current as money,  
co-operated with that resource. Their united force, quickening the ener-  
gies and bringing into action the capacities for improvement of a new coun-  
try, was highly instrumental in accelerating its growth.  
  
Credit, too, animated and supported by the general zeal, had a great  
share in accomplishing, without such violent expedients as, generating uni-  
versal distress, would have endangered the issue, that revolution, of which  
we are so justly proud, and to which we are so greatly indebted.  
  
Credit, likewise, may, no doubt, claim a principal agency in that increase  
of national and individual welfare since the establishment of the present  
government, which is so generally felt and acknewledged, though the true  
causes of it are not as generally understood. It is the constant auxiliary  
of almost every public operation; has been an indispensable one in those  
measures by which our frontiers have been defended; and it would not be

difficult to demonstrate that, in a recent and delicate instance, it has mate-  
rially contributed to the safety of the state.  
  
There can be no time, no state of things, in which credit is not essential  
to a nation, especially as long as nations in general continue to use it as a  
resource in war. It is impossible for a country to contend, on equal terms,  
or to be secure, against the enterprise of other nations, without being able  
equally with them to avail itself of this important resource ; and to a young  
country, with moderate pecuniary capital, and not a very various industry,  
it is still more necessary than to countries more advanced in both. A truth  
not less weighty for being obvious and frequently noticed.  
  
Public credit has been well defined to be, ‘‘a faculty to borrow, at plea-  
sure, considerable sums on moderate terms; the art of distributing, over a  
succession of years, the extraordinary efforts found indispensable in one; a  
means of accelerating the prompt employment of all the abilities of a nation,  
and even of disposing of a part of the overplus of others.”  
  
This just and ingenious definition condenses to a point the principal ar-  
guments in favor of public credit, and displays its immense importance.  
  
Let any man consult the actual course of our pecuniary operations, and  
let him then say whether credit be not eminently useful. Let him ima-  
gine the expense of asingle campaign in a war with a great European  
power; and let him then pronounce whether credit would not be indispen-  
sable. Let him decide whether it would be practicable, at ail, to raise the  
necessary sum by taxes within the year; and let him judge what would be  
the degree of distress and oppression which the attempt would occasion to  
the community. He cannot but conclude that war, without credit, would  
be more than a great calamity—would be ruin.  
  
But credit is not only one of the main pillars of the public safety; it is  
among the principal engines of useful enterprise and internal improvement.  
As a substitute for capital, it is little less useful than gold or silver in agri-  
culture, in commerce, in the manufacturing and mechanic arts.  
  
The proof of this needs no labored deduction. It is matter of daily ex-  
perience in the most familiar pursuits. One man wishes to take up and  
cultivate a piece of land; he purchases upon credit, and, in time, pays the  
purchase money out of the produce of the soil improved by his labor.  
Another sets up in trade; in the credit founded upon a fair character, he  
seeks, and often finds, the means of becoming, at length, a wealthy mer-  
chant. A third commences business as manufacturer or mechanic, with  
skill, but without money. It is by credit that he is enabled to procure the  
tools, the materials, and even the subsistence of which he stands in need,  
until his industry has supplied him with capital ; and even then he derives,  
from an established and increased credit, the means of extending his under-  
takings.  
  
Among the circumstances which recommend credit, and indicate its im-  
portance in the whole system of internal exertion and amelioration, it is im-  
possible to pass unnoticed its unquestionable tendency to moderate the rate  
of interest—a circumstance of infinite value in all the operations of labor  
and industry.  
  
If the individual capital of this country has become more adequate to its  
exigencies than formerly, it is because individuals have found new resour-  
ces in the public credit—in the funds to which that has given value and  
activity. Let public credit be prostrated, and the deficiency will be greater  
than before. Public and private credit are closely allied, if not inseparable.  
There is, perhaps, no example of the one being in a flourishing, where the  
other was in a bad state. A shock to public credit would, therefore, not only

take away the additional means which it has furnished, but, by the derange-  
ments, disorders, distrusts, and false principles, which it would engender  
and disseminate, would diminish the antecedent resources of private credit.  
  
The United States possess an immense mass of improvable matter; the  
development of it, continually making, may be said to enlarge the field of  
improvement as it progresses; and though the active capital of the country  
has, no doubt, considerably increased, it is probable that it does not bear, at  
present, a much greater proportion to the objects of employment thar it has  
done at any former period. Credit, upon this hypothesis, of every kind, is  
nearly as necessary tu us now as it ever was. But, at least, it may be af-  
firmed, with absolute certainty, that, to a country so situated, credit is pecu-  
liarly useful and important.  
  
If the United States observe, with delicate caution, the maxims of credit,  
as well towards foreigners as their own citizens, in connexion with the gen-  
eral principles of an upright, stable, and systematic administration, the  
strong attractions which they present to foreign capital will be likely to en-  
sure them the command of as much as they may want, in addition to their  
own, for every species of internal amelioration.  
  
Credit is an entire thing. Every part of it has the nicest sympathy with  
every other part; wound one limb, and the whole tree shrinks and decays.  
  
It is in vain to attempt to disparage credit by objecting to its abuses,  
What is there not liable to abuse or misuse? The precious metals, those  
great springs of labor and industry, are also the ministers of extravagance,  
luxury, and corruption. Commerce, the nurse of agriculture and manfuac-  
turers, if overdriven, leads to bankruptcy and distress. A fertile soil, the  
principal source of human comfort, not unfrequently begets indolence and  
effeminacy. Even liberty itself, degenerating into licentiousness, produces  
a frightful complication of ills, and works its own destruction.  
  
It is wisdom, in every case, to cherish whatever is useful, and guard  
against its abuse. It will be the truest policy of the United States to give  
all possible energy to public credit, by a firm adherence to its strictest max-  
ims; and yet to avoid the ills of an excessive employment of it by true  
economy and system in the public expenditures; by steadily cultivating  
peace ; and by using sincere, efficient, and persevering endeavors to dimin-  
ish present debts, prevent the accumulation of new, and secure the discharge,  
within a reasonable period, of such as it may be, at any time, matter of ne-  
cessity to contract. It will be wise to cultivate and foster private credit, by  
an exemplary observance of the principles of public credit, and to guard  
against the misuse of the former by a speedy and vigorous administration of  
justice, and by taking away every temptation to run in debt, founded in the  
hope of evading the just claims of creditors.

to the same charge as unfunded property.”” This charge was 3 per  
cent. In the United States this matter was put at rest, in 1795, in the  
luminous report of Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury,  
on “public credit,” as follows :—  
  
“Ts there a right in the government to tax its own funds ?  
  
“The pretence of this right is deduced from the general right of the legisla-  
tive power to make all the property of the State contributory to its exigencies.  
  
“ But this right is obviously liable to be restricted by the engagements of the gov-  
ernment ; it cannot be justly exercised in contravention of them; they must form  
an exception. It will not be denied that the general right in question could and  
would be abridged by an express promise not to tax the funds: but this promise,  
indeed, has not been given in words, but it has in substance. When an individual  
lends money to the State, the State stipulates to pay him the principal lent, with  
a certain interest, or to pay a certain interest indefinitely, until the principal is  
reimbursed.  
  
“ To tax the funds, is manifestly either to take, or keep back, a portion of the prin-  
cipal or interest stipulated to be paid.  
  
“ To do this, on whatever pretext, is not to do what is expressly promised ; it is not  
to pay that precise principal, or that precise interest, which has been engaged to  
be paid : it 1s, therefore, to violate the promise given to the lender.  
  
* But is not the stipulation to the Lebiler with the tacit reservation of the genera!  
right of the legislature to raise contributions on the property of the State ?  
  
“This cannot be supposed, because it involves two contradictory things ; an  
obligation to do, and a right not to do ; an obligation to pay a certain sum, and a  
right to retain it in the shape of a tax. It is against the rules both of law and  
reason, to admit by implication, in the construction of a contract,a principle which  
goes in destruction of it.

“Public debt can scarcely, in legal phrase, be defined either property in posses-  
sion orin action. It is evidently not the first till it be reduced to possession by  
payment. To be the second would suppose a legal power to cause payment by  
suit. Does such a power exist? The true definition of public debt is a property  
existing in the faith of the government. Its essence is promise. Its definite value  
depends upon reliance that that promise will be definitely fulfilled. Can the gov-  
ernment rightfully tax its promises? Can it put its faith under contribution ?  
Where or what is the value of debt if such a right exists ?”  
  
Through several pages, every possible argument in favor of this species  
of repudiation was successfully put down by the American statesman, and  
his views applied to domestic creditors, citizens of the indebted State.

reserved to tbe Uuited States, until tbe whole amount  
thereof shall have beeu redeemed; and, lastly, after sucb

report on the public debt and finances. In this report he said:  
  
Let any man consult the actual course of our pecuniary operations, and let him  
then say whether credit be not eminently useful. Let him imagine the expense of  
a single campaign in a war with a great European power; and let him then pro-  
nounce whether credit would not be indispensable, Let him decide whether it  
would be practicable, at all, to raise the necessary sum by taxes within the year;  
and let him judge what would be the degree of distress and oppression which the  
attempt would occasion to the community. He cannot but conclude that war,  
without credit, would be more than a great calamity—would be ruin.  
  
But credit is not only one of the main pillars of the public safety ; it is among  
the principal engines of useful enterprise and internal improvement. As a substitute  
for capital, it is a little less useful than gold or silver, in agriculture, in commerce,  
in the manufacturing and mechanic arts.

Public debt could scarcely, in legal phrase, be  
defined either property in possession, on in ac­  
tion. It is not the first until reduced into pos­  
session by payment. To be the second would  
suppose a legal power to compel payment by

&quot;Is there a right in the government to  
tax its own funds?  
&quot;Tho pretence of the right is deduced  
from the general right of the legislative  
power to make all the property of the  
State contributory to its exigencies  
m &quot;Hut tbis right is obviously liable to.  
be restricted by tbe engagements of the  
government; it cannot justly be exer­  
  
cised in contravention of them; tbey  
must form an exception. It will not  
bo denied tbat the general right in  
question could and would bo abridged  
by an express promise not to tax tho  
funds. This promise, indeed, has not  
been given in name, but it 1ms been  
given iu substauce. When an individual  
lends money to the State the State  
stipulates to repay him the principal  
lent, with a certain interest, or to pay  
a certain interest, indefinitely, till the  
principal is reimbursed; or it stipulates  
something equivalent in another form.  
In our case, the stipulation Is in the  
second foru^  
&quot;To tax tho funds is manifestly either  
to take or to keep back, a portion of  
tho principal or Interest stipulated to  
bo paid.  
&quot;To do this, on whatever pretext, is  
not to do whatever is expressly ptomised,  
it i* not to pay that precise principal,  
that precise interest which has  
boon engaged to be paid; it is therefore  
to violate the promise given to the  
lender.  
&quot;Hut is not the stipulation to the  
lender, with a tacit reservation ot the  
general right of the. legislature to raise  
contributions on the property of the  
  
Slate?  
&quot;This cannot be supposed, because it  
involves two contradictory things: an  
obligation to do, and a right not to do.  
An obligation to pay a certain suiu,  
and a right to retaiu it in the shape of  
n tax. It is against the rules both of  
law and reasoii to aJmit, by application,  
in the construction of a contract,  
a principle which goes in destruction of  
it.  
&quot;The government by such a construction  
could bo made to say to the lender?:  
&quot;I want a sum of money, for a national  
purpose, which all the citizens  
ought to contribute proportionality, but  
it will be more convenient to them and  
to me to borrow the money of you. If  
you will lend it, 1 promise you faithfully  
to allow you a certain rate of interest  
while I keep the money, and to  
reimburse the principle within a determinate  
period,?except so much of the  
one and the other as 1 may think lit to  
withhold in the shape of a tax.  
&quot;I* snch a construction either natural  
or rational? Does it not in fact, nulify  
the promise, by the reservutiou of a  
right not to perform it?  
&quot;It is to be presumed, without being  
  
expressed, tbut such can be tbo understanding  
of a lender when ho parts  
with hit* money to n government? Tbo  
contrary in so much the more presumable,  
that nothing short ol an express  
reservation can support the pretensions  
to tax the lund

&quot;l^et the question bo tried by another  
analysis.  
&quot;Public debt can scarcely, in a legal  
phrase, bo defined as either property in  
possession or In action. It Is evidently  
not the first till it is reduced to possession  
by payment. To bo the-second  
would Bupposo a legal power to compel  
payment by suit. Such a power does  
not exist. The true definition of a  
public debt is, u property subsisting in  
the faith of tbo government. Its essence  
is promise. Its definite value  
depends upon the reliance that tho  
promise will be definitely fulfilled.?  
Can it put its faith under contribution?  
Where or what is the value of tho debt,  
if such a right exist?  
44 Suppose the government to contract  
with an individual to convey to him a  
hundred acres of land, upon the condition  
of navini; one hundred dollar*.  
  
When he came to pay the hundred dollars,  
aud demand his title, could the  
government require of him to pay fifty  
more, as u tax upon the land, before it  
would conseut to give him the title??  
Would not this be a breach of contract  
?a fraud?which nothing could disguise?  
&#x27;This case is parallel with that under  
uxaminatlou, with circumstances that  
fortify the right of the lending creditor.  
&quot;The Government agrees with him  
that for ono hundred dollars, which ho  
delivers to the Government, It will deliver  
to him at the end of each year six  
dollars. Hore tho six dollars to be delivered  
answer to the land to be conveyed,  
with this stronger ground of  
right, that the consideration for them  
lias uctually been given and received.  
Yet when the creditor comes to demand  
his six dollars, he Is told that he cannot  
havo them, except upon tho condition  
of returning one dollar as that tax.  
What is this but to say that his title to  
the mouey In this case, as to the land In  
the other, must depend upou his paying,  
or allowing further consideration  
tor it, uot contemplated in the contract?  
Can thero be a doubt that this also  
would be a breach of contract?a fraud?  
*A reut or annuity, liable before it  
passes, or in the act of passing, or at  
the moment ot passing from ono proSrletor  
to another, to a deduction or  
rawbnek, at the pleasure of the party  
from whom it is to Da&amp;s. 1m an JmaoU  
  
nary thing, destitute both of shape and  
substance.  
&quot;When a government enters into a  
contract with an individual it deposes  
as to the matter of the contract its constitutional  
authority, and exchanges  
the character of legislator for that of  
a moral agent, with the same rights  
and obligations as an individual. Its  
promises may be justly considered as  
excepted out of its power to legislate,  
unless in aid of them. It is. In theory,  
impossible to reconcile tbe two ideas of  
a promise which obliges, with a power  
to make a law which can vary the e(i  
feet or it. This la the great principle  
that governs the quesUou, and abridges  
the general right of the government to  
, lay taxes?excepting out of It a specie*  
ot property which subsists only in its  
promises.  
  
&quot;Bat shall the proprietor of money  
in the fands, then, be exempt from his  
proportion of the burden which other  
citizens bear? This will not be the consequence  
of .the principle. As a consumer,  
of which his income is the instrument,  
he will pay his proportion of  
the taxes on consumption. As a holder  
of any other species of property, procured  
by that income or otherwise,  
which is liable to a tax. he must also  
contribute his proportion.  
&quot;But without undue refinement the  
lender of money to the public may be  
affirmed to have paid his tax when be  
lends his money. Relying upon the  
engagement of the government, express  
or implied, that he will receive  
what ia nromised him without Idefalca­  
  
tion, he is content with a less interest  
than be would take if subject to any  
such defalcation, and especially if it  
was to be arbitrary as to its extent. In  
this lesser rate of interest he may be  
said to pay his tax, or to purchase an  
exemption from it.  
&quot;Here also we find what is decisive  
on the point of expediency.  
&quot;If the government had a right to tax  
the funds, the exercise of that right  
would cost much more than it is worth.  
The money lender would exact exorbitant  
premiums, not only as an indemnification  
lor the use which the government  
might probably make of its right  
and which in practice would be  
likely to be qualified by some  
regard to equality of contribution, but  
8B an equivalent of insurance against  
the risk or possibility of a more extensive  
risk. Hence the Government  
would be likely to pay more in premiums  
to possible loans than it would  
  
draw lmck jn (axes; ana mo lormer .being  
Hupposed bat equal to the latter,  
there would be no advantage in exercising  
tbe right. ?  
&quot;But it will be, perhaps, more safe to  
affirm that there would be no borrowing  
at all upon such terms. Tbe first  
precedent of a tax upon tbe funds  
might be expected to compel the Government  
to an express renunciation of  
the right in every futuro loan. But no  
such renunciation would heal the  
wound which an example of its exercise  
would give. Double suspicions  
might fasten on the wisdom or integrity  
of the Government, producing loss  
and embarrassment, before a course of  
contrary experience could obliterate  
them.  
&quot;The United States must henceforth  
tread with the most cautious steps.&quot;

arguments from the pen of one of the  
choice and master spirits,&#x27; of the golden  
age of the republic.  
&#x27; Is there a right iu the government to  
tax its men funds ?  
The pretense of this right of the legisla­  
tive power is to make all the property of the  
State contributory to its exigencies.  
But this right is obviously liable to be  
restricted by the engagements of the gov­  
ernment ; it -cannot justly be exercised in  
contravention of them ; they must form an  
exception. It will not be denied that the  
general right in question could and would  
be abridged by au expressed promise not  
to tax the funds. This promise, indeed,  
has not been given in name, but it has  
been given in substance. When an indi­  
vidual lends money to the State, the State  
stipulates to repay him the principal lent,  
with a certain interest, or to pay a certain  
interest, indefinitely, till the principal is  
reimbursed ; or it stipulates something  
equivalent, in another form. In our case,  
the stipulation is in the second form.  
To tax the funds is manifestly either to  
take or to keep back, a portion of the prin­  
cipal or interest stipulated to be paid. To  
do this, on whatever pretext, is not to do  
what is expressly promised, it is not to  
pay that precise principal, that precise in­  
terest, which has been engaged to be paid ;  
it is therefore to violate the promise given  
to the lender -  
But is not . c,:pulation to the lender,  
with tacit reservation of the general rights  
of the legislature, to raise contributions on  
the property of the State?  
This cannot be supposed, becaase it in­  
volves two contradictory things; au obli­  
gation to do, and a right not to do. An  
obligation to pay a certain sum, and a right  
to retain it in the shape of a tax. It is  
against the rules both of law and reason to  
admit, by implication, iu the construction  
of a contract, a principle which goes in de­  
struction of it.  
The government by such a construction  
could be made to say to the lenders : 4 1  
want a sum of money, for a national pur  
pose, which all the citizens ought to con­  
tribute proportionally, but it will be more  
convenient to them and to me to borrow  
the money of you. If you will lend it, I  
promise you faithfully to allow you a cerr  
tain rate ot interest while 1 keep tne  
money, and to reimburse the principal  
within a determinate period, except so  
much of the one and the other as I may  
think fit to withhold in the shape of a tax.  
Is such a construction either natural or  
rational? Does it not, in fact, nullify the  
promise, by the reservation of a right not  
to perform it ?  
Let the question be tnea Dy anotner  
analysis.  
I ublic debt can scarcely, in legal phrase  
  
be defined as either property in possession  
or in action. It is evidently not the first  
till it is reduced to possession by payment.  
To be the second would suppose a legal  
power to compel payment by suit. Such  
a power does not exist. The true defini­  
tion of a public debt is, a property subsist­  
ing in the faith of the government. Its  
essence is promise. Its definite value de­  
pends upon the reliance that the promise  
will be definitively fulfilled. Can it put  
its faith under contribution? Where or  
what is the value of the debt, if such a  
right exist ?  
4 Suppose the government to contract  
with an individual to convey to him a hun  
  
dred acres of land, upon the condition of  
paying one hundred dollars. V hen he  
came to pay the hundred dollars, and de-  
Luiand his title, could the government re  
quire 01 mm to pay ntty more, as a tax  
upon the land, before it would consent to  
give him the title ? Would not this be a  
breach of contract a fraud which noth­  
ing could disguise ?  
&#x27;This case is parallel with that under  
examination, with circumstances that fort­  
ify the right of the lending creditor.  
4 The government agrees with him that  
for one hundred dollars, which he delivers  
to the government, it will deliver to him  
at the end of each year six dollars. Here  
the six dollars to be delivered answer to  
the land to be conveyed, with this stronger  
ground of right, that the consideration for  
them has actually been given and received.  
Yet when the creditor comes to demand his  
six dollars, he is told that he cannot have  
them, except upon the condition of return­  
ing one dollar as that of tax. What is  
this but to say that his title to the money  
in this case, as to the land in the other,  
must depend upon his paying, or allowing  
further consideration for it, not contempla­  
ted in the contract ? (Jan there be a doubt  
that this also would be a breach of con­  
tract a fraud ?  
&#x27; A rent or annuity, liable before it  
passes, or iu the act of passing, or at the  
moment of passing from one proprietor to  
another, to a deduction or drawback, at  
the pleasure of the party from whom it is  
to pass, is an imaginary thing, destitute  
both of shape and substance.  
4 When a government enters into a con­  
tract with an individual it deposes as to  
the matter of the contract its constitutional  
authority, and exchanges the character of  
legislator for that of a moral agent, with  
the same rights and obligations as an indi­  
vidual. Its promises may be justly con­  
sidered as excepted out of its power to  
legi&amp;late, unless in aid of them. It is, iu  
theory, impossible to reconcile the two  
ideas of a promise which obliges, with a  
power to make a law which can vary the  
effect of it. This is the great principle  
that governs the question, and abridges  
the general right of the government to lay  
taxes excepting out of it a species of  
property which subsists only in its prom­  
ises.&#x27; But shall the proprietor of money in  
the funds then, be exempt from his pro­  
portion of the burden which other citizens  
bear ? This will not be the consequence of  
th.  
i principi  
As a consumer, of which  
his income is the instrument, he will pay  
his proportion of the taxes on consumption.  
As a holder of any other species of prop­  
erty, procured by that income or other­  
wise, which is liable to a tax, he must also  
contribute his proportion.  
4 But without undue refinement the lend­  
er of money to the public may be affirmed  
to have paid his tax when he lends his  
money. Belying upon the engagement of  
the government, express or implied, that  
he will receive what is promised him with­  
out defalcation, he is content with a less  
interest than he would take if subject to  
any such defalcation, and especially if it  
was to be arbitrary as to its extent. In  
this lesser rate of interest he may be said  
to pay his tax, or to purchase an exemption  
from it.  
4 Here also we find what is decisive on  
the point of expediency.  
&#x27; If the Government had a right to tax  
the funds, the exercise of that right would  
cost much more than it is worth. The  
money lender would exact exorbitant pre­  
miums, not only as an indemnification for  
the use which the government might prob­  
ably make of its right, and which in prac­  
tice would be likely to be qualified by  
some regard to equality of contribution,  
but as an equivalent for insurance against  
the risk or possibility of a more extensive  
use. Hence the Government would be  
likely to pay more in premiums to possible  
loans than it would draw back in taxes ;  
and the former being supposed but equal  
to the latter, there would be no advantage  
in exercising the right.  
44 But it will be perhaps, more safe to  
affirm that there would be no borrowing at  
all ution such terms. The first precedent  
of a tax upon the funds might be expected  
to compel the urovernnient to an express  
renunciation of the right in every future  
loan. But no such renunciation would  
heal the wound which an example of it

tes the 16th and 21st of Janu-  
It has been argued,&quot; he observes, &quot;that,  
asteady preservation of its faith by the  
s indifferent to the creditor whether  
his demand stands upon the basis of an annnal pro  
raged funds.&quot; This is to  
substitute theory for fact. As well with regard to a  
government as to an individual, there is, in the  
nature of things, an intrinsic difference between the  
value of a debt bottomed on mortgaged funds and  
that of a debt resting on what is called in the one  
and can be called in the other, personal seen­  
rity. The degree of this difference, and some of the  
circumstances on which it depends, may be different  
in the two cases; but the reality of its existence may  
be denied in neither.  
Government, being administered by men is natn-­  
rally, like individuals, subject to particular impulses  
is, prejudices, vices; of course to inconstancy  
of views and mutability of conduct.  
A kind of property, of which the essence is con  
tract, must necessarily, therefore, be more or less  
valuable, because more or less secure, in proportion  
little or much exposed to the influence of that  
inconstancy or that mutability.  
If a provision is to be made by a new resolution  
every year, that resolution, being always liable to  
momentary circumstances, is always casual.  
If made once for all, it continues, of course, unless  
revoked by some positive act, and has for that reason  
Icertainty of stability.  
But why, it might be asked, if a disposition un  
faithful to the public engagements, or unfriendly to  
redit should exist, would it not operate to  
aviolation of a provision made, as well as to  
prevent the making of one?  
The two things are widely different. To undo, which  
is to act, and in such a case to act with riolence, re  
quires more enterprise and vigor, and presupposes  
greater energy or stronger impulse, than not to do or  
to forbear to act. This is particularly true where a  
number of wills are to concur. Many men who will  
not rouse to the effort, or encounter the responsibility,  
hief by positive acts, will readily enough  
into it by a negative conduct; that is, by omit  
Many men, merely from easiness of tem­  
per or want of active fortitude, will suffer evil to  
take place which they neither desironor would theme­  
selves commit. In collective bodies, rotes are neces-  
sary to action; absences may produce inaction. It  
often happens that a majority of voices could not be  
a resolution to undo or reverse anything once  
ald not be a majority of voices  
This reasoning acquires tenfold force when applied  
to a complete government like ours; that is to a  
rnment distributed into departments, acting  
through different organs, which must concur to give  
it motion; as in our Constitution, the House of lepre  
sentatires, the Senate, and the President.  
In delicate and difficult cases, whether to issue in  
good or ill, a suspension of action is far more natn  
ral to such a government than action.  
It can hardly happen that all the branches or parts  
of it can be infected at one time with a common pas-  
sion or disposition manifestly inimical to justice and  
the public good, as to prostrate the public credit by  
given to the creditors. It is far  
more probable that such a disposition should at one  
possess one part, at another time another part.  
Possessing either part, it might be suffcient to obe­  
 struct a provision which was to be made. Without  
sing all the parts, it could not subvert one  
which had been made. The last can scarcely be sup-­  
posed, except in one of those extraordinary crises of  
ich confound all ordinary calculations.  
Hence, the value of property in public debt, which  
rests on specified and competent funds firmly pledged  
e satisfaction of the creditor, is intrinsically  
greater, and to a considerable extent, than that of  
property in public debt which depends on annual  
provision. Hence, too, a creditor to whom such a  
pledge was not stipulated may be justly said to have  
d a compensation for the relinquishment of a  
n of his interest.  
From the year 1806, the fiscal condition of this coun  
try was such that no provision for the reimburse-  
tof the small public debt was deemed necessary:  
but the attempt to overthrow the Government of the  
United States in the interest of Slavery assumed  
proportions which required the utmost exertion of  
all its herculean powers.

There is no sentiment which can better deserve the serious

the speech of the President, which indicates the danger to every  
government from the progressive accumulation of debt. &lt;A ten-

and it is not easy to conceive anything more likely than this, to  
lead to great and convulsive revolutions of empire.

the present to a future day—a propensity which may be expected  
to be strong in proportion as the form of a State is popular.  
  
To extinguish a debt which exists, and to avoid the contracting  
more, are ideas. always favored by public feeling and opinion; but  
to pay taxes for the one or the other purpose, which are the only  
means of avoiding the evil, is always more or less unpopular.  
These contradictions are in human nature; and happy, indeed,  
would be the lot of a country that should ever want men ready  
to turn them to the account of their own popularity, or to some  
other sinister account.— Yanuary 16, 1795.

Let him imagine the expense of a single campaign in a war with

credit would not be indispensable. Let him decide whether it  
would be practicable, at all, to raise the necessary sum by taxes

There is a general propensity in those who administer  
the asairs of a government, founded in the constitution  
of man, to shift off the burden from the present to a lue  
ure day--a propensity which may be expected to be  
strong in proportion as the form of a State is vopular.  
To extinguish a debt which exists, and to avoid the con  
tracting more, are ideas al ways lavored by public leel  
ing and opinion; but to pay taxes for the one or the other  
purpuse, which are the only means of avoiding the evil,  
is always more or less unpopular. These contradictions  
are in human nature; and happy, indeed, would be the  
lot of a country that should ever want men ready to turn  
them to the account of their own popularity or to some  
other sinister account?  
There is the whole existing trouble in a nutshell.  
Nor was slamilton&#x27;s diagnosis in other particulars  
less acute. He declared, for instance, that &quot;evary

What, then, is meant by the doctrine that contracts are

lends money to a State, or to a municipal division of the State

reservation of a right in the debtor to raise contributions out  
of the money promised to be paid before payment? That can-  
not be, because if it could, the contract (in the language of |  
Alexander Hamilton) would “involve two contradictory things: |  
an obligation to do, and a right not to do; an obligation to pay }  
a certain sum, and a right to retain it in the shape of a tax. It &#x27;

any of its creditors within its jurisdiction for the debt due to  
him, and regulate the amount of the tax by the rate of interest  
the debt bears, if its promise be left unchanged. A tax thus  
laid impairs no obligation assumed. It leaves the contract

creditor; namely, payment to him, without a violation of the  
Constitution. ‘The true rule of every case of property founded  
on contract with the government is this: It must first be re-  
duced into possession, and then it will become subject, in com-  
mon with other similar property, to the right of the government  
to raise contributions upon it. It may be said that the govern-  
ment may fulfil this principle by paying the interest with one  
hand, and taking back the amount of the tax with the other.  
But to this the answer is, that, to comply truly with the rule,  
the tax must be upon all the money of the community, not  
upon the particular portion of it which is paid to the public  
creditors, and it ought besides to be so regulated as not to in-  
clude a lien of the tax upon the fund. The creditor should be  
no otherwise acted upon than as every other possessor of money ;  
and, consequently, the money he receives from the public can  
then only be a fit subject of taxation when it is entirely sep-  
arated” (from the contract), “and thrown undistinguished into  
the common mass.” 8 Hamilton, Works, 514 et seg. Thus only  
can contracts with the State be allowed to have the same mean-  
ing as all other similar contracts have.  
  
Such limitations of the power of State taxation we have  
heretofore recognized. We have held property in one stage of

to the Senate of Jan. 20, 1795, “ when a government enters  
into a contract with an individual, it deposes, as to the matter  
of the contract, its constitutional authority, and exchanges the  
character of legislator for that of a moral agent, with the same  
rights and obligations as an individual. Its promises may be  
justly considered as excepted out of its power to legislate,

THE TrUE RULE.  
The true rule of property founded on contract with the  
government is this: &quot;It must be first reduced into posses-­  
sion and then it will become subject in common with other  
similar property to the right of the Government to  
raise contributions upon it It may be said that  
the Government may fulfil this principle by paying  
the interest with one hand and taking back the  
amount of the tax with the other. But to this  
the answer is, that to comply with the rule  
the tax must be upon all the money of the community,  
not upon the particular portion of it which is paid to the  
public creditors, and it onghy to be so regalate as not to  
include a lien unon the fund. The creditor should be no  
other wise acted upon than as any other possessor of mon-­  
eys; and consequently the money he receives from the  
publie can thus only be a fit subject of taxation when it is  
entirely separaten&#x27; (from the contract) &quot;and thrown un-­  
distinguished into the common mass.&quot; O Hamilton&#x27;s  
Works, 514 et se.) Thus only can contracts with the  
State be allowed to have the same meaning as all other  
similar contracts have.  
PRRVIOUS DECISIONS.  
Such limitations of the power of State taxation we have  
horetofore recognized. We have held property in one stage  
of its ownership not to be saxable. Those decisions are not

are ideas almost always favoured by  
public feeling and opinion ; but to pay

which is the t means to avoid the evil,

to the sinking fund. He remarked in relation to the foreign debt :  
  
‘‘The payment of interest and installments of our foreign debt in the  
-countries where it was contracted is found by experience to be attended with  
difficulty, embarrassment, some loss, and a degree of casualty which occas-  
sionally puts in jeopardy the national credit. Loans for reimbursement  
must be made beforehand as the market suits, and necessarily involve double  
interest for a greater or less time. The procuring of bills to be remitted for  
payment of interest cannot be depended on in coincidence with the periods of  
  
payment, which, co-operating with distance, renders inconvenient anticipa-  
tions necessary.  
  
The remitting in commodities would be liable to other casualties and to  
some peculiar objections ; and whatever mode be adopted, it may be fre-.  
quently not practicable to deposit the necessary funds on the spot without  
great sacrifices. If, therefore, the place of these payments could with consent  
of the creditors, upon an equitable indemnification to them for the transfer,  
be changed to the United States, the operation would, in various lights, be  
beneficial. It has occurred that the present posture of affairs in Europe  
might favor a plan of this kind and perhaps produce some collateral advan-  
tages. Under this idea an experiment is proposed. The proposed augmenta-  
tion of interest is intended as an indemnification for the expense and hazard  
of agencies in this country, delays in remittance, inconvenience of distant  
negotiations, renunciation of the facilities which attend the receipt of interest  
at home, risks of loss by exchange, etc., and is calculated on a liberal scale  
in order to induce the acceptance of the propenitiés.  
  
If instead of an increase of interest the option of an equivalent be given  
by way of premium, in stock bearing an interest of five per cent., it would  
have attractions for certain creditors, and would facilitate the success of the  
measure. On strict calculation, the equivalent would be six dollars and fifty-  
eight cents per one hundred dollars of the principal subscribed. It is not  
perceived that the interests of the United States could suffer by allowing the  
alternative. The fixing of the rate of interest by postponing the reimburse-  
ment until the year 1818, would also be a powerful inducement, and till the  
period of reimbursement arrives any surplus of the sinking fund which may  
exist can be invested in purchases so as to prevent the progress of the fund  
being arrested.  
  
It could not be necessary to observe, except for the sake of dispelling jeal-  
ousy or apprehension on the part of the creditors, that while the plan is in  
experiment, and afterward, with regard to all who do not embrace it, every-  
thing is to proceed as heretofore and as the contracts respecting the debt  
require.  
  
The auxiliary proposition of giving power to the commissioners of the sink-  
ing fund to remit certificates for sale, is founded upon a belief that this opera-  
tion will sometimes be practicable, where direct loans cannot be effected, and  
will occasionally be a more beneficial mode of remittance than by bills of  
exchange.”  
  
The Secretary therefore made the following proposition :  
  
‘*That provision be made for converting, by a new loan, the whole of our  
present foreign into domestic debt, upon these terms to wit: That for any  
sum subscribed to the new loan, and paid in the principal of the present
