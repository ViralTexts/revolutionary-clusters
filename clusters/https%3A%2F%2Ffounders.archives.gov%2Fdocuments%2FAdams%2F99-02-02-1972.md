&amp; Representatives of the United States, it would have afforded me the most sincere satisfaction to have been able to congratulate you on the restoration of peace to the nations of Europe whose contentions have endangered our tranquillity &amp; to have invited your attention only to such measures as ordinarily occur, in managing the concerns of an extensive and flourishing nation.  
But though the time and manner of your being convened and the situation of our Country in relation to a foreign power, indicate the necessity of extraordinary councils, yet we have still abundant cause for gratitude to the Supreme Dispenser of National Blessings.  
To the excercise of this gratitude we are invited by the contemplation of peace and plenty, civil &amp; religious liberty, social and domestic happiness &amp; the rapid progress and acquisitions of peaceable industry through extensive regions.—While other States are afflicted by foreign war, or convulsed by domestic agitations, the United states present the pleasing and consoling spectacle of a numerous people, governed by mild laws, satisfied with the possession of their undoubted rights, neither envying the advantages or fearing the power of other nations, and solicitous only for the maintenance of order &amp; justice &amp; the preservation of liberty—To prolong this happy condition

r interest of the United States forbid the repetition of advances for securing these desireable objects, I shall immediately institute measures of negociation, to be improved whenever the consent of the government of France can be obtained; and I shall not fail to hasten &amp; promote an accomodation on terms compatible with the rights, engagements &amp; honour of our Country.  
But though it is my earnest desire, that the negociations proposed to be instituted, may produce a favourable issue, yet as the progress of the war in Europe &amp; the general complexion of events, render it proper to be prepared for a less fortunate result, I judge it to be my indispensible duty to recommend defensive measures to your consideration.  
The Commerce of the United States has become a most interesting object of attention whether it be considered in respect to the wealth &amp; finances or strength and resources of the Nation,—any serious or permanent injury to this branch of industry would not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorders; to preserve our commerce from being gradually undermined and destroyed, it is essential that it receive adequate protection.  
The arguments by which the establishment of a Naval force has on former occasions been recommended to the attention of Congress becomes more and more exemplified and confirmed by experience.—Indeed as the sufferings of our Mercantile Citizens cannot be attributed to the omission of duties demandable by the neutral situation of our Country, they are all to be resolved into the hope of impunity arising from a supposed inability on our part to afford protection. To resist the consequences of such impressions in the minds of foreign nations, &amp; guard against the degradation and servility which they must finally impress on the American character, is an important duty of government.

.  
But though the establishment of a permanent system of Naval defence appears to be requisite, I am sensible that it cannot be so speedily organised as to supercede the necessity of other measures which are demanded by the exigency of the present Crisis.—Though I have thought proper to prevent the sailing of armed Vessells except on voyages to the East Indies, where general usage and the danger from Pirates appeared to render the permission proper;—yet the restriction has originated solely from a wish not to anticipate the decision of Congress on a question of National importance &amp; not from any doubt entertained by me, of the policy &amp; propriety of permitting our Vessells to employ means of defence while engaged in a lawful Commerce.—It remains for Congress to prescribe such regulations as well enable our seafaring Citizens to defend themselves against aggressions of the Law of Nations;—and at the same time restrain them from committing acts of hostility against the powers at War,—(or to enforce by suitable provisions, the existing instructions which forbid the sailing of armed Vessells.)  
It appears that many, if not a principal part of the small Cruizers, whose depradations have been most injurious, have been built &amp; partially equipped in the United States;—though a remedy appears to be attended with great difficulty, yet I have thought it my duty to present the subject generally to your consideration;—if a mode can be devised by the wisdom of Congress, to prevent the resources of the United States from being converted into the means of annoying our trade, a great evil will be prevented.  
The distance of the United States from Europe and the spirit &amp; fortitude of the people happily diminish in a great degree, if they do not render intirely improbable, invasions in time of War.—Nevertheless, the unprotected situation of some of our principal Sea Ports, renders it proper to guard against the danger of sudden &amp; predatory incursions.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
It is particularly your province to consider the state of the public finances &amp; to adopt such measures in relation thereto, as exigencies shall be found to require.—The preservation of public credit, the regular extinguishment of the public debt, and a provision of funds to defray any extraordinary expences, will of course call for your serious attention.  
Although the imposition of new burthens on your constituents, cannot be in itself agreable, yet there is no ground to doubt, that the American people will expect from you, such measures as their actual engagements, their present security, and future Interests demand.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
It will I presume be admitted, that the present situation of our Country imposes an obligation upon all the Departments of Government, to adopt an explicit &amp; decided conduct, in my situation, an exposition of the principles by which my administration will be governed, is a more than ordinary duty.  
It is impossible to conceal from ourselves or from the world, that endeavours have been made to foster and establish a division between the American Government &amp; people. To investigate the causes, which have encouraged this attempt would be unprofitable; but to repel by firm &amp; united Councils, an aggression so derogatory from the honour &amp; so dangerous to the Independence of the Nation, is an indispensible duty.  
It was foreseen that the retirement of a Majistrate whose preeminent services, virtue and wisdom had united all hearts in his favour, would form an interesting era in our government;—the event has verified the prediction, and it must soon be decided, whether the American people will support the Government established by their voluntary consent, or whether by surrendering themselves to the direction of foreign &amp; domestic factions, they will forfeit that honourable distinction which they have hitherto maintained:—Having never been indifferent to what concerned the interests of my Country, having devoted the best part of my life in support of its independence, having constantly witnessed the perseverance, fidelity &amp; patriotism of my fellow Citizens on the most trying occasions, it is not for me to express a doubt:—or to abandon a cause in which my heart has long been engaged.  
Convinced as my mind is, that the conduct of the government has been just &amp; impartial to foreign Nations;—that those internal regulations which have been established by Law for the preservation of peace, are in their nature proper and that they have been fairly executed; nothing will ever be done by me, to impair the National engagements, to innovate upon principles which have been deliberately established, or to surrender in any manner the rights of the Government.—To enable me to maintain this declaration I count with entire confidence on recieving the firm and enlightened support of the National Legislature and upon the virtue &amp; patriotism of my fellow Citizens.

££  
  
It is particularly your province to confider the ftate of the  
ublic finances; and to adopt fuch meafures refpecting them, as  
exigences fhall be found to require ; the prefervation of public  
credit, the regular extinguifhment of the public debt, and a pro-  
vilion of funds to defray any extraordinary expenfes, will of courfe  
call for your ferions attention ; although the impofitions of new-  
burthens, cannot be in itfelf, agreeable, yet there is no ground  
to doubt that the American people will expe¢t from you, fuch  
meatures, as their a@ual engagements, their prefent fecurity, and  
future interefts demand.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
The prefent fituation of our country impofes an obligation,  
on all the departments of government, to adopt an explicit and  
decided conduct. In my fituation an expofition of the principles  
by which my adminiftration will be governed, ought not to be  
omitted.  
  
It is impoffible to conceal from ourfelves or the world, what  
has been before obferved, that endeavours have been employed to  
fofter, and eftablifh a divifion between the government and people  
of the United States. To inveltigate the caufes which have en-  
couraged this attempt is not neceflary ; but to repel by decided  
and United councils, infinuations fo derogatory, to the honour,  
and aggrefions fo dangerous to the conftitution, union and even  
independence of the nation, is an indifpenfible duty ;—  
  
It muft not be permited to be doubted, whether the people  
of the United States will fupport the government, eftablifhed by  
their voluntary confent, and appointed by their free choice, or  
whether by furrendering themfelves, to the dire€tion of foreign  
and domeitic factions, in oppofition to their own government  
they will forfeit the honourable {tation they have hitherto main-  
tained.  
  
For myfelf, having never been indifferent to what concerned  
the interefts of my country ; devoted the beft part of my life to  
obtain and fupport its independence, and conitantly witneffed,  
the patriotifm, fidelity, and perfeverance, of my fellow citizens  
on the moit trying occofions, it 1s not for me to hefitate or aban-  
don a ceufe in which my heart has been fo long engaged.  
  
Convinced that the conduct of the government has been juit  
and impartial to foreign nations ; that thofe internal regulations  
which have been eftablilhed by law for the prefervation of peace,  
are in their nature proper, and that they have been fairly execue  
ted ; nothing will ever be done by me to impair the national en-

 the progress of the war in Europe, the depreda-  
tions on our commerce, the fersonal injuries to our citizens, and the general  
comle vion of affairs, render it my indispensible duty to recommend to your  
consideration effefual measures of defence.  
  
The commerce of the United States has become an interesting obje&amp; of  
attention, whether we consider it in relation to the wealth and finances, or  
the strength and resources of the nation. With a sea-coast of near twa thou-  
sand miles in extent, opening a wide field for fisheries, navigation, and com-  
merce, a great portion of our citizens naturally affly their industry and en-  
terprize to these objects ; any serious and permanent injury ta commerce would  
not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorders ; to frevent it from being  
undermined and destroyed, it is essential that it receive an adequate fre-  
tection,  
  
The naval establishment must occur to every man, who considers the inju-  
ries committed on our commerce, the insults offered to our citizens, and the  
description of the vessels by which these abuses have been pradised; as the  
sufferings of our mercantile and seafaring citizens cannot be ascribed to the  
omission of duties demandable, considering the neutral situation of our coun-  
  
try, they are to be attributed to the hope of impunity arising from a suft-  
  
posed inability on our part to afford protefion—to resist the consequences of  
such impressions on the minds of foreign nations, and te guard against the  
degradation and servility which they must finally stamp on the American  
charager, is an important duty of government.

Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
  
{Tis particularly your province 10 consider the state of the [ublic fina  
ces; and to adopt such measures respecting them, as exigencies shall be found  
torcquire; the preservation of public credit, the regular extinguishment of  
the fublic debi, and a provision of funds te defray any extraordinary ex-  
fences, will, of course, call for your serious attention; although the imposition  
of new burthens cannot be, in itself, agreeable, yet there ts no ground to  
doubi, that the American people will expect from you such measures, as their  
adiual engagements, their present security, and future interests demand.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
  
THE present situation of our country imposes an obligation om all the dem  
frartincnts of government, to adopt an explicit and decided conduct. In my  
situation, an exposition of the principles, by which my administration will  
be poverned, ought mot to Le omiited.  
  
Lt is impossible to conceal from ourselves or the world, what has been be-  
Sore observed, that endeavors have been employed to foster and establish a  
division between the governntent and heapile of the United States. Toa inn,  
vestigate the causes which have encouraged this attempt is mot necessary ; but  
to. repel, by decided and united councils, insinuations so derogatory to the he-  
ner, and aggressions sv dangerous to the constitution, union, and even indes  
fendence of the nation, is an ne geaty duty.  
  
It must not be permitied to be doubted, whether the people of the United,  
  
States will support the government established by their voluntary consent, and,  
appointed by their free choice ; er whether, by surrendering themselves to the  
direétion of foreign and domestic factions, in opposition to their own go-  
vernmeént, they will forfeit the honorable station they have hitherto. matin-  
tained,  
Fai” myself, having never been indiffercnt to what concerned the intevasta  
of my country, devoted the best part of my life to obtain and support th it-  
dependence, and constantly witnessed the patriotism, fidelity and perseve-  
rance of my fellow citizens on the most trying occasions, it isnot for me to hen  
sitate or abandon a cause in which my heart has been solong engaged.  
  
Convinced that the conduct of the government has been just and, impartial  
to foreign nations ; that those internal regulations, whick have been tstablish-  
ed by law for the preservation of peace, are in their nature fropers and  
  
that they have bren fairly executed ; nothing will ever be done by me to im- :  
pair the national engagements, ta innovate upan principles, which have been  
so deliberately and uprightly established, or ta surrender im any manner the  
rights | arg government. To enable me to maintain this declaration, I rely,  
under God, with entire confidence, on the firm and enlightened support of the  
national legislature, and upon the virtue and patriotism of my fellow a-  
  
rexems.

thefe abufes have been prattifed ; as the fufferings of our mer-  
cantile, and feafaring citizens, cannot be afcribed to the omif-  
fion of duties demandable, confidering the neutral fituation of  
our country, they are to be attributed to.the hope of impunity,  
acifing froma fuppofed inability on our part to afford proteéti-  
on. To refit the confequences of fuch impreflions on the  
miads of foreign nations, and to guard againlt the degradation  
and fervility, which they muit finaily ttamp on the American  
character, is an important duty of government.

But, although the eftablifhment of a permanent fyftem of na-  
val defence, appears to be requilite, I am fenfible it cannot be  
formed fo ipeedily and extenfively, as the prefent crifis de-  
mands. Ehitherto, I have thought proper to prevent the failing  
of armed veffels, except to the Eaft-Iudies, where general ufage  
and the danger from pirates appeared to render the permiflion  
proper: Yet the reftriGion has originated folely from a with  
to prevent collufions with the powers at war, contravening the  
act of congrefs of June, ove thoufand feven hundred and ninet y-  
four, and not from any doubt entertained by me of the policy  
and propriety of permitting our veffels to employ means of  
aefence, while engaged in a lawful foreign commerce. It  
remains for Congrefs to prefcribe fuch regulations as will enable  
our feafaring citizens todefend themfelves againft violations of  
the law of nations and at the fame time refirain them, from  
committing a&amp;s of hoftility againft&#x27;the powers at war. In ad-  
dittion. to this voluntary provifion for defence by individual  
citizens, it appears tome neceliary to equip the frigates, and  
provide other veffels of inferior force, to take under convoy  
fuch merchant veifels as thall remain unarmed.  
  
The greater part of the cruifers, whofe depredations have  
been moft injurious, have been built, and fome of them partial-  
ly equipped, in the United States. Although an effectual re-  
medy may be attended with difficulty, yet, I have thought jt  
my duty to prefent the fubjeét generally to your confideration.  
if a mode can be devifed, by the wifdom of congrefs, to pre-  
vent the refources of the United States from being converted  
into the means of annoying our trade, a great evil will be pre-  
vented. With the fame view I think it proper to mention,  
that fome of our citizens refident abroad, have fitted out priva-  
teers, and others have voluntarily taken the command, or enter

The prefent fituation of our country  
impufes an obligation on ail the dcpiit-  
mcnls of government, to adopt an ex¬  
plicit and decided condu6t. In my  
fituation an expofition of the principles  
by which my adminifiratiun will be  
governed, ought not to be omitted.  
  
It is impollible to conceal from our¬  
fclves or the world what has been be¬  
fore obferved, that endeavours have  
been employed to fofter and efiablilh  
a tiivifion between the Government and  
People of the United States. To&#x27;in-  
veftigate the caufes which have en¬  
couraged this attempt is not nectffary ;  
but to repel by decided and united  
councils and infinuations fo derogatory  
to the honour, and aggrclfions lo dan¬  
gerous to the conftitutioii, union, and  
even independence of the nation, is an  
indifpcnfibic duty.  
  
It mull not be permitted to be doubted  
whether the People of the United States  
will fupportth« Government eftablilhed  
by their voluntary content and ap¬  
pointed by their free choice ; or whether  
by furrendering themfelves to the di¬  
rection of foreign and dom»*fiic faClions,  
in oppofition to their own Government,  
they will forfeit the honourable llation  
they have hitherto maintained.  
  
For myfclf, having never been in¬  
different to what concerned the interefis  
of my country; devoted the *beft part  
of my life to obtain and fupport its  
independence, and conftantly witnefled

as exigencies fhail be found to require ;  
the preiervation of public credit, the regu-

a provifion of funds to defray any extra-  
ordinary expences, will, of courfe, call  
your fenious attention, although the im-  
pofition of new burdens cannot be in itfelf,  
agreeable, yet there is no ground to doubt  
that the American people will expeét from  
you, fuch meafures as their aétual en-  
Ragements, their prefent fecurity, and fu-  
ture intereft demand,  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentle-  
  
men of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
The prefent fituation of our country  
impofes an obligation, on all the depart-  
ments of government, to adopt an explicit  
and decided conduct. In my fituation an  
expofition of the principles, by which my  
adininiftration will be governed, ought nog  
to be omitted.  
  
It is impoffible to conceal from our-  
felves or the world, what has been before  
oblerved, that endeavours have been em~  
ployed to fofter, and eftablifh a divifion  
between the government and people of the  
United States. To inveltigate the caufes  
which have encouraged this attempt is not  
necefflary ; but to repel by decided and  
united councils, infinuations fo derogatory  
to the honour, and aggreffions fo dangerous  
to the conftitution, union, and even in«  
dependence of the nation, is an indifpenfa«  
ble duty.  
  
It muft not be permitted to be doubted,  
whether the people of the United States  
will fupport the government, eftablithed  
by their voluntary confent, aad appointed  
by their free choice ; or whether by fur-  
rendering themfelves to the direétion o}  
foreign and domeftic jfa&amp;tions, in oppofie  
tion to their own government, they will  
forfeit the honourable ftation they have  
hitherto maintained.  
  
For myfelf, having never been indiffer=  
ent to what concerned the interefts of my  
country, having devoted the beft part of  
my life to obtain and fupport its inde  
pendence, and conftantly witneffed the pa  
triotifm, fidelity, and perfeverance of my  
fellow-citizens on the moft trying occae  
fions, it is not for me to hefitate, or a~  
bandon a caufé in which my heart has  
been fo long engaged. ;  
  
Convinced that the conduét of the go~  
vernment has been ju(t and impartial to  
foreign nations ; that thofe internal regu  
lations, which have been eftablifhed by  
law for the prefervation of peace, are in  
their nature proper, and that they have  
been fairly executed ; nothing will ever be  
done by me to impair the national engages  
ments, to innovate upon principles which  
have been fo deliberately and uprightly  
eftablifhed ; or to furrender in any mane  
ner the rights of the government ; to ena-

 the progress of the war  
in Europe, the depredations on our commerce, the personal in-

render it my indispensable duty, to recommend to your con-

«The commerce of the United States has become an inte-  
resting object of attention, whether we consider it in relation  
to the wealth and finances, or the strength and resources of  
the nation. With a sea-coast of near two thousand miles in  
extent, opening a wide field for fisheries, navigation, and com-  
merce, a great portion of our citizens naturally apply their in-  
dustry and enterprize to these objects. Any serious and per-  
manent injury tocommerce, would not fail to produce the most  
embarrassing disorders; to prevent it from being undermined  
and destroyed, it is essential that it receive an adequate pro-  
tection.
