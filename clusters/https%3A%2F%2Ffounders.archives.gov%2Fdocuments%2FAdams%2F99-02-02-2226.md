Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
22 Nov. 1797  
  
I was, for sometime apprehensive, that it would be necessary, on account of the contagious Sickness which afflicted the City of Philadelphia, to convene the national Legislature, at Some other place. This measure, it was desireable to avoid,; because it would occasion much public Inconvenience, and a considerable public expence, and add to the calamities of the Inhabitants of this City, whose Sufferings must have excited the Sympathy of all their fellow Citizens. Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the State and decline of the Sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes, now happily realized, that, without hazard to the Lives or health of the Members, Congress might assemble at this place, where it was next by Law, to meet. I Submit, however, to your Consideration, whether a Power to postpone the Meeting of Congress without passing the time fixed by the Constitution, upon Such occasions, would not be a Usefull Amendment to the Law of one thousand Seven hundred and ninety four,  
Although I cannot yet congratulate you on the re-establishment of Peace in Europe, and the restoration of Security to the Persons and Properties of our Citizens from Injustice and violence at Sea: We have, nevertheless abundant Cause of Gratitude to the Source of Benevolence and Influence for interiour tranquility and personal Security, for propitious Seasons, prosperous Agriculture, productive Fisheries and general Improvements: And above all, for a rational Spirit of civil and religious Liberty, and a calm, but Steady determination to Support our Sovereignty, as well as our moral and religious Principles, against all open and Secret Attacks. our Envoys extraordinary to the French Republick, embarked one in July, the other early in August to join their Colleague in Holland.… I have received Intelligence, which I am inclined to believe authentic, of the Arrival of one both of them at Amsterdam in Holland, from whence they and his Colleague were proceeding to Paris all proceeded on their Journeys to Paris within a few days of the nineteenth of September. … Whatever may be the result of this Mission, I trust that nothing will have been omitted on my part, to conduct the Negotiation to a successfull conclusion, on such equitable terms, as may be compatible with the Safety, honour and Interests of the United States. Nothing in the meantime, will contribute so much to the preservation of Peace, and the Attainment of Justice, as a manifestation of that Energy and Unanimity, of which on many former Occasions, the People of the United States, have given Such memorable proofs, and the Exertion of those Resources, for national defence, which a beneficent Providence, has kindly placed within their Power.  
It may be confidently asserted, that nothing has occurred Since the Adjournment of Congress, which renders inexpedient those precautionary measures, recommended by me, to the consideration of the two Houses, at the opening of your late extraordinary Session. If that System was then prudent it is more so now, as increasing depredations Strengthen the reasons for its Adoption.  
Indeed whatever may be the issue of the Negotiation with France, and whether the War in Europe is, or is not to continue, I hold it most certain, that permanent Tranquility, and order, will not soon be obtained. The State of Society has so long been disturbed, the Sense of moral and religious Obligation so much weakened, public Faith and national honour have been so impaired, respect to Treaties has been so impaired diminished, and the Law of nations has lost so much of its force: while Pride, Ambition, Avarice and Violence, have been so long unrestrained, there remains no reasonable ground on which to raise an expectation, that a Commerce without protection or defence, will not be plundered. The Commerce of the United States, is essential, if not to their Existence, at least to their Comfort, their growth, prosperity and Happiness. The Genius, Character, and Habits of the People are highly commercial. Their Cities have been formed and exist upon Commerce. Our Agriculture, Fisheries, Arts and Manufactures are connected with and depend upon it. In Short, Commerce has made this Country what it is; and it cannot be destroyed or neglected, without involving the People in Poverty and distress. Great Numbers are directly and Solely Supported by Navigation. The Faith of Society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of commercial and Seafaring no less than of the other Citizens. Under this View of our Affairs, I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of Duty, if I forebore to recommend that we Should make every exertion to protect our Commerce, and to place our Country in a Suitable posture of defence, as the only Sure means of preserving both.  
I have entertained an Expectation that it would have been in my Power, at the opening of this session, to have communicated to you the agreable Information, of the due execution of our Treaty with his Catholic Majesty, respecting the withdrawing of his Troops from our territory, and the demarcation of the Line of Limits. But by the latest Authentic Intelligence, Spanish Garrisons were Still continued within our Country, and the running of the boundary Line had not been commenced. These Circumstances are the more to be regretted, as they cannot fail to effect the Indians in a manner injurious to the United States. Still, however, indulging the hope, that the Answers which have been given, will remove the objections offered by the Spanish officers, to the immediate execution of the Treaty, I have judged it proper, that we should continue in readiness to receive the Posts, and to run the Line of Limits. Further Information on this Subject will be communicated in the Course of the session.  
In Connection with this unpleasant State of Things on our Western frontier, it is proper for me to mention, the Attempts of foreign Agents, to alienate the affections of the Indian nations, and to excite them to actual hostilities against the United States. Great Activity has been exerted, by these Persons, who have insinuated themselves among the Indian Tribes, residing within the Territory of the United States, to influence them to  
The Commissioners appointed under the fifth Article of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and navigation, between the United States and Great Britain, to ascertain the River which was truly intended under the name of the River St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty of Peace, met at Passamaquoddy Bay in October, One Thousand seven hundred and ninety Six, And viewed the Mouths of the Rivers in question and the Adjacent Shores and Islands; and being of Opinion that actual Surveys of both Rivers to their Sources were necessary, gave to the Agents of the two Nations Instructions for that purpose; And adjourned to meet at Boston in August. They met; but the Surveys requiring more time than had been Supposed, And not being then compleated, the Commissioners again Adjourned to meet at Providence, in the State of Rhode Island in June next, when we may expect a final Examination and decision.  
The Commissioners appointed in pursuance of the Sixth Article of the Treaty, met at Philadelphia in may last, to examine the Claims of British Subjects for Debts contracted before the Peace, and Still remaining due to them from Citizens or Inhabitants of the United States. Various causes have hitherto prevented any determinations: but the Business is now resumed and doubtless will be prosecuted without interruption.  
Several decisions, on the Claims of Citizens of the United States, for Losses and damages Sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or condemnations of their Vessells or other Property, have been made by the Commissioners in London, conformably to the Seventh Article of the Treaty. The Sums awarded by the Commissioners have been paid by the British Government. A considerable number of other Claims, where Costs and Damages and not captured Property were the only Objects in question have been decided by Arbitration, and the Sums awarded to the Citizens of the United States have also been paid.  
The Commissioners appointed agreably to the twenty first Article of our Treaty with Spain, met at Philadelphia in the Summer past, to examine and decide on the Claims of our Citizens for Losses they have Sustained in Consequence of their Vessells and Cargoes having been taken by the Subjects of his Catholic Majesty during the late war between Spain and France. Their sittings have been interrupted but are now resumed.  
The United States being obligated to make Compensation for the Losses and damages Sustained by British Subjects, upon the Award of the Commissioners acting under the Sixth Article of the Treaty with Great Britain; and for the Losses and damages Sustained by British Subjects, by reason of the Capture of their Vessells and Merchandize taken within the Limits and Jurisdiction of the United States, and brought into their Ports, or taken by Vessells originally armed in Ports of the United States, upon the awards of the Commissioners acting under the Seventh Article of the Same Treaty: it is necessary that provision be made for fullfilling these Obligations.  
The numerous captures of American Vessells by the Cruisers of the French Republick, and of Some by those of Spain, have occasioned considerable Expences, in making and Supporting the Claims of our Citizens before their Tribunals. The Sums required for this purpose, have in diverse instances been disbursed by the Consuls of the United States. By means of the Same captures, great numbers of our Seamen have been thrown ashore in foreign Countries, destitute of all means of Subsistance; and the Sick in particular have been exposed to grievous Sufferings. The Consuls have in these cases also advanced monies for their relief. For these Advances, they reasonably expect, reimbursements from the United States.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
It is my Duty to recommend to your Serious consideration those Objects which, by the Constitution are placed particularly within your Sphere, the national Debts and Taxes.  
Since the decay of the feudal System by which the public defence was provided for, chiefly at the expence of Individuals, the System of Loans has been introduced. And as no Nation can raise within the Year, by Taxes, Sufficient Sums for its defence, and military operations in time of war, the Sums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subject of what have been called funding Systems. The Consequences arising from the continual Accumulation of public Debts in other Countries, ought to admonish Us to be careful to prevent their growth in our own. The national defence must be provided for, as well as the Support of Government: but both Should be accomplished as much as possible, by immediate Taxes, and as little as possible by Loans. The Estimates for the Service of the ensuing year will, by my Direction be laid before you.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
We are met together at a most interesting Period. The Situations of the principal Powers of Europe are Singular and portentous. connected by with Some with by Treaties, and with all by commerce, no important Event there, can be indifferent to Us. Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity, not less, for a disposition to Unite in all those measures, on which the honour Safety and prosperity of our Country depend than for all the Exertions of Wisdom and firmness.  
In all Such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.  
  
John Adams

Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
I WAS for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary, on account  
of the contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia, to  
convene the Nattonal Legislature at some other place: this measure it was  
desirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public inconvenience, and  
a consi derable public expence, and add to the calamities of the inhabitants  
of this city, whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their fel-  
low citizens :— Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the state and .  
decline of the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes, now hap-  
pily realized, that, without hazard to the health of the members, Congress  
might assemble at this place, where it was next Ly law to meet. I submit,  
hrwever, to your consideration, whether a power to postpone the meeting of  
Congress, without passing the time fixed by the constitution upon such occa-  
sions, would not be a@ useful amendment to the law of one thousand seven -  
hundred and ninety-four. :  
  
Although I cannot yet congratulate you on the ve-estaklishment of peace i  
Europe, and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our  
citizens, from injustice and violence at sea; we have, nevertheless, abundant  
cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and. influence, for interior  
tranquility, and personal security, for propitious seasons, prosperous agri-  
culture, productive fisheries, and general improvements; and, above all, for  
a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty, and a calm, but steady de-  
termination to support our sovereignty, as well as our moral and religious  
principles, against all ofen aud secret attacks,  
  
Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked, one in Fuly,  
the other early in August, to join their coHeague in Rolland. I have re-  
ceived intelligence of the arrival of both of p a in Holland, from whence  
they all proceeded on their journey to Paris, within a few days of the 19th  
of Seatember. Whatever may be the result of this mission, I trust that no-  
thing will have been omitted on my part, to conduct the negociation to a suc-  
cessful conclusion, on such equitable terms, as may be compatible with the*  
safety, honor, and interest of the United States. Nothing, in the mean-  
time, will contribute so mich to the arma of peace, and the attainment  
of justice, as a manifestation of that energy, and unanimity, of which, om  
many former occasions, the es ge of the United States have given such me-  
  
morable proof, the exertion of those resourees, forsnational defence, which -  
  
« benificent Providence has kindly placed within their power.

It may be confidently asserted, that nothing has occurred simte’  
journment of Congress, which renders inexpedient those precautionary meaw  
recommended by me, to the consideration of the two houses, at the ohening:  
your late extraordinary session. If that system was then prudent, it is more  
so now, as increasing depredatiens strengthen the reasons for its adoption,  
  
Indeed, whatever may be the issue of the negociation with France, and  
  
  
  
‘whether the war in Europe is, or is not to continue, 1 held it most certain,  
  
that permanent tranquility and order will not soon be obtained: The state  
of society has so long been disturbed; the sense of moral and religious obliga-  
tion so much weakened ; public faith and national honor have been so im-  
  
aired ; respec? to treaties has been so diminished ; and the law of mations  
has lost so much of its force; while pride, ambition, avarice, and violence,  
have been so long unrestrained, there remains no reasonable ground on which to  
raise an expectation, that a commerce, without protection or defence, will not  
be plundered.  
  
The commerce of the United States is essential, if not to their existence,  
at least to their comfort, their growth, prosperity, and hajrpiness. The gee  
nius, charaGier, and habits of the people, are highly commercial: their cities  
have been formed, and exist upon commerce; oxr agriculture, fisheries, arts,  
and manufadtures, are connected with, and depend upon it: In short, com-  
  
merce has made this country what it is, and it cannot be destroyed or negle@e  
  
ed, without involving the people in poverty aud distress; great numbers are  
  
divetly and solely rhe by navigation. The faith of society is pledged  
  
Sor the preservation of the rights of commercial and sea-faring, no less than  
the other citizens. Under this-view of our affairs, I should hold myself guilty’  
  
of a negled of duty, if I forbore torecommend, that we should make every  
  
exertion to fproted? our commerce, and yee our country in a suitable pose  
  
ture of defence, as the only sure means of preserving both.  
Ihave entertained an expeétation, that it would have been in my power,  
  
at the opening of the session, to have communicated to you the agreeable  
  
information of the due execution of our treaty with his Catholic Majesty, re-  
seeing the withdrawing of his troops from our territory, and the demarka-  
tion of the line of limits ; but by the latest authentic intelligence, Spanish gar-  
risons were still continued within our country, and the running of the boundary  
  
line had not been commenced. These circumstances are the more to be regret=  
ted, as they cannot fail to affect the Indians, in a manner injurious to the  
  
United States :—Still, however indulging the hope, that the answers which  
have been given, will remove the objeAions offered by the Spanish officers, tothe  
  
immediate execution of the treaty, I have judged it proper, that we should  
  
continue in readiness to receive the | sycea and to run the line of limits: further  
information, on this subje, will be communicated in the course of the session.  
  
In conneion with the unpleasant state of things on our western, frontier,  
it is proper for me to mention th attempts of forcign agents, to alienate the  
@ffections of the Indian nations, and to excite them to atual hostilities against  
  
the United States; great activity has heen exerted by these persons, who

The Commtssioners appointed under the fifth article of the treaty of amity,  
commerce, and navigation, between the United States and Great-Britain,  
to ascertain the river, which was truly intended, under the name of the river  
St, Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at Passamaqueddy-bay,  
tg Offober, 1796, and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question, the adja-  
cent shores aad islands; and being of opinion, that adtual surveys of both  
river&#x27;s to their sources were neces savy, gave to the agents of the two Nations,  
instructions for that purpose; and adjourned to met ai Boston in August :  
they mei; but the surveys requiring more time than had been sufifosed, and  
not being then completed, the Commissioners again adjourned to meet at Pro-  
vidence, in the state of Rhode-Island, in Fune next, when we may expect a  
finah examination and decision. .  
The Camimissioners afprointed in pursuance of the sixth article of the treaty,  
met at Philadelphia, m May last, to examine the claims of British subieéts,  
  
Sar debts contrated before the peace, and still remaining due to them, from  
  
the citizens or inhabitants of the United States. Various causes have hi-  
therto /revented any determinations; but the business is now resumed, and  
doubtless will be prosecuted without interruption,  
  
Several decisions on the claims of the citizens of the United States, for  
Josses and damages, sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures,  
or condemuations, of their vessels, or other property, have been made by the  
Commissioners in London, conforrzably to the seventh article of the treaty.—  
The sums awarded by the Commissioners had been oat hy the British go-  
wernment ; a considerable number of other claims, where costs and damages,  
and not captured property, were the only abjeGs in question, have been decided  
by arbitration, and ile sums awarded to the citizens of the United States  
have also been paid.  
  
The Commissioners, appointed agreeably to the twenty-first article of our  
treaty with Spain, met at Philadelphia in the summer aa to examine and  
decide on the claims of our citizens, for losses they have sustained in con-  
sequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjeds of his  
Catholic Majesty, during ihe late war between Spain and France. Their  
sittings have been interrupted, but arc now resuined.  
  
The United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses and,  
damages sustained by British subjedts, upon the award of the Commission-  
ers, acting under the sixth article of the treaty with Great-Britain, and  
for the losses and damages sustained by British subje4s, by reason of the  
capture of their vessels, and merchandize, taken within the limits and juris  
aittion of the United States, and brought into their ports, or taken by ves-  
sels originally armed in ports of the United States, upon the awards of the  
Commissioners acting under the seventh article of the same treaty ; it is necting  
  
sary, that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations.  
  
The numerous captures of American vessels, by cruisers of the French Re-  
public, and of some by those of Spain, have occastoned considerable exper  
ces immaxing and supporting the claims of oar citizens before their tribunals,  
The sums required for this purpose have, in divers instances, been disbursed

Gentlemen of the House of Represeutatives,  
  
Lt is my dui ty i commend to your sertous con idevation, those objet,  
which, by the const. thag are placed particularly within 3  
pers de hts and faxes.  
  
Since on decay of the feudal syste  
vided for, hiefy, at the e xpence of ine  Lividuals, a system of loans has been  
introduced. Ard as no nation can raise teithin ‘the year, by faxes, sufficient  
sums for its defence and military oferatious in time of: war, the sums loaned,  
and debts ronda ua have necessarily becenie the subject: of what heave fc  
called funding system The consequences arising from the continual accu-  
mulation of publ slic debts i in other countries, ovght to admonish us, to be care-  
ful ta prevent their growth in our own. The national d fence must be fre-  
  
vided for, as well as the sujiport of goverament ; but both should be accom-  
plished, as much as possible, b by immediate taxes, and as little as possible by  
loans. The estimates for the service of the ensuing year will, by my direc-  
tion, be laid hefor&#x27;e you.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
  
We are met together at a@ most interesting period ; the situations of the  
frincifal powers in Europe ave singular and fortentous. Connedted with  
some by treaties, and with all by commerce, no important event there can be  
indifferent tous. Sweheircumstances call, with peculiar impor tunity, nat  
less for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor, safe-  
ty, and prosperity of our country depend, than for all the exertions of « visdom  
and frimness.  
  
Tn all such measures you may rely on my xealous and hearty concurrence.

Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
I was for some time apprehensive, that  
it would be necessary, on account of the  
contagious fickncft, which afflifted the city  
of Philadelphia, to convene the National Le  
gillature at some other place ; this measure  
it was desirable to avoid, because it would  
occasion much public inconvenience, and a  
eonfiderable public expence, and add to the  
calamities of the inhabitants of this city,  
whose fufferings must have excited the fyni­  
pathy of all their fellow citizens ; therefore,  
after taking meafurs to ascertain the state  
and decline of the sickness, Ifoftponedmy  
determination, having hopes, now happily  
realized, that without hazard to the lives  
or health of the members, Congress might  
affemWe at this place, where it was next  
by law to meet. I submit however to your  
confederation, whether a power to pofipone  
the meeting of Congress, without palling  
the time fixed by the Coxftitution, upon  
such occasions, would not be a ufciul amend­  
ment to the law of one thousand seven hun­  
dred and ninety four.  
Although I cann»t congratulate you on  
the re-eftabUfhment of peace in Europe, and  
the restoration of security to the persons,  
and properties of our citizens from injufticc  
and violence at sea ; we have neverthclefs  
abundant cause of gratitude to the source  
of benevolence and influence, for interior  
tranquility and personal security, for propi­  
tious seasons, prosperous agriculture, pro­  
ductive fifheries, and general improvements ;  
and above all, for a rational spirit of civil  
and religious liberty, and a calm but steady  
determimtiv&lt;n to support our sovereignty, as  
well as our moral and religious principles  
against all open and secret attacks.  
Onr envoys extraordinary to the French  
republic embarked one in July, the other  
early in August, td join their colleague in  
• Holland. I have received intelligence of  
the arrival of both of them in Holland, from  
1 whence&#x27;they all proceeded on their journeys  
to Paris, about the 19th of September.  
F Whatever may be the result of this mission,  
- I trull that nothing will have been omitted  
- on my part, to cont&#x27;.ift the ntgoeiation to a  
fuccefsfulconcluGon, onfuchequitableterms,

former oceafions, the people of the United  
I States have given such memorable proofs,  
t and the exertion of those resources for na­

s has kindly placed within their power,

the rights of tommercial, and sea faring ; ce  
no less than of the other citizens ; under this ce  
view of our affairs, I (hould hold myfelf fr

manner injurious to the United States, still v  
however, indulging the hope, that the an- c

merce and-Navigation, between the United

river, which was truly intended under the  
name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the

in October, one thonfancl feveu hundred and  
ninety fix, and viewed the mouths of the  
rivers in question, and the adjacent shores  
aRd Islands, and being of opinion, that ac- 1  
tual surveys of both rivers to their sources  
were necessary, gave to the agents of the j  
two nations inftruftions for that purpose,  
and adjourned to meet at Boston in August :  
they met, but the surveys requiring pore  
time than had been fuppofefl, and not being  
then compleated, the commissioners again

&#x27; Gentlemen of the Monfe of Reprefntativer,  
&gt; It is my duty to recommend to your fe­  
r rious confideratioi, those objefts, which by  
t the constitution, are placed particularly  
- within your sphere, the national debts and  
&gt; taxes.  
i Since the decay of the feudal system, by  
1 which the public defence was provided for,  
• chiefly at the expence of individuals, the  
t Tyllfm of loans has been introduced ; and as  
s no nation can raise, withia the year, by tax­  
, cs, fufficient sums for its defence and milita­  
ry operations in time of war, the sums loan­  
-1 ed, and debts contraftcd have necefTarily be­  
- come the fubjedts of what have been called  
1 funding systems ; the consequences arising  
from the constant accumulation of public  
5 debts, in other countries, ought to admonish  
s ■ us, to be careful to prevent their growth in  
f our own—the national defence must be pro­  
f vided for as well as the support of govern­  
e men:, but both (hould be accomplished as  
; much as pofliblc by immediate taxes, and as  
e little as pofliblc by loans.  
The estimates for the fervi«e of the ensu­  
e ing year will by my direftion be laid before  
t you. !  
3 Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
- Geutlemen of the House of Reprefentgtives,  
t Wt are met together at a rnoft interesting  
s period ! Tlie fmntions&quot; of the principal  
&gt; powers of Europe, are lingular and porten-  
I- tous : connected with Tome by treaties, and  
i- with all by commerce, no important event  
o there, can be indifßrjiit to us : Such cir­  
c cumftances call with peculiar imoorlunity,,  
■a not less for a disposition to unite, in all those  
&gt;- measures, on which the hosour, fafety, and

Genslemen of the Senate, and  
Genilemen of the Houje of Reprejen-atives,  
  
I WAS for fome time apprehenfive that it wou&#x27;d  
be neceflary, on account of tie contagious ficknefs  
which afflicted the city of Pailadelphia, to convene  
the National Legiflature at fome other place; this  
meafure it was deiirable to avoid, be¢aufe it would  
occafion much public inconvenience, and a confidera-  
ble public expence. and add to the calamities of the  
inhabitants ot this city, whofe fufferings muft have  
excited the fympathy of all their fellow citizens :—  
Therefore, after taking meafures to afcertain the  
ftate and decline of the ficknefs, I pottponed my de-  
termination, having hopes, now happily realized,  
that, wichout hazard to the health of the members,  
Congrefs might aflemble at this place, where it was  
next by lay to meet. I fubmit, however, to your  
confideration, whethera power to poftpone the meet-  
ing of Congrefs, witheut pafling the time fixed by  
the conftitution upon fuch occalions, would not be a  
ufeful amendment to the law of one thoufand feven  
hundred and ninety four. :  
  
Although I cannot yet congratulate you on the re-e-  
ftablifhment of peace :n Europe, and the reftoration of  
fecurity to the perfons and properties of our citizens,  
from injuftice and violence at fea; we have, neverthe-

from whence they all proceeded cn their journey to  
Paris, within a few days of the tgth of September.  
Whatever may be the refute of this miffion, [ tru% that  
nothing will have been omited on my patt, to condué  
the negociation to a fuceefeful conclufion, on fuch  
equitable terms, as may be compatible with the fatety,  
honour, and intereft of the United States.—Nothing  
in the mean time will contribute fo much to the pre-  
fervation of peace, and the attainment of juftice, as a  
manifeftation of that energy, and unanimity of which  
on many former occafions, the people of the United  
States, have given fuch memorable proc, and the ex-  
ertion thofe refources, tor national defence, which a  
beaificent Providence has kindly placed within their  
power.  
  
It may be confidently afferted, that nothing has oc-  
curred fince the adjourtment of Congrefs, which renders  
inexpedient thofe precautionary neafures, recommend-  
ed by me, to the confideration of the two Houfes. at  
the opening of your late extraordinary feflion. Ff that  
fyftem was then prudent, it is more fo now, as encreaf-  
ing depredations ftrengthen the reafons for its adop-  
tion.  
  
Indeed whatever may be the ifue of the negociation  
| with F-ance, and whether the war in Eurépe is, or is  
‘not to continue, 1 hold it mo’ certain that permanent  
| tranquility and order, will not foon be obtained : ‘The  
{tate of fociety has fo long been difturbed, the fenfe of  
moral and religious obligation f much weakened ; pub-  
lic faith and national honour hnve been fo impaired, re-  
pect to treaties has been fo dminifhed, and the law of  
nations has loft fo much of its force ; while pride, am-  
bition, avarice, and violence, have been fo Jong unre-  
ftrained, there remains no reafnable ground, on which  
to raife an expectation thata commerce without protec.  
tion or defence, will not be pladered.  
  
‘) he commerce of the United States ts effential, if not  
to their exiftence, at leaft to their comfort, their growth,  
profperity and happinefs. ‘ihe genius, character, and  
hibits of the people are highl; commercial ; their cities  
have been formed, and exilt ion commerce 3 our agri-  
culture, fitheries, arts, aod nnaufactures, are conneéted  
with, and depend upon it; Infhort, cemmerce has made  
this country what it is, and itcannot be deftroyed ot ne-  
olected, without involving the people in poverty and  
dittrefs ; great numbers are dreétly and folely fupported  
by navigation. ‘Ihe faith o7 fociety is pledged for the  
prefervation of the rights of commercial and fea-faring,  
no lefs than of other citizens. Under this view of our  
affairs, I fhould hold myfelf guilty of a neglect of duty,  
if I forbore to reeommend, that we fhould make every  
exertion to protect our commerce, and to place our  
country ina fuitable pofture of defence, as the only  
fare means of preferving both.  
  
I have entertained an expectation, that it would  
have been in my power, at the opening of the feffion,  
to have communiceted to you the agrecable information  
of the due execution of our treaty with his catholic  
majefty, refpecting the withdrawing of his troops, from  
our territory, and the demarkation of the line of limits ;  
but by the late authentic intelligence, Spanifh garrifons  
were {till continued within our country, and the running  
of the boundary line had not been commenced.—Thefe  
circumftances are the more to be regret:ed, as they  
cannot fail to affeét the Indians, in any manner injuri-  
ous to the United States ;—Still, however, indulging  
the hope, that the anfwers which have been given, will  
remove the objections offered by the Spanith officers.  
to the immediate execution of the treaty, I have judged  
it proper, that we fhould continue in readinefs to receive  
the pofts, and to run the line of limits— further infor-  
mation on this fubjeé&amp;t, will be communicated iu the  
courfe of the feflion. |  
  
In conne&amp;tion with the unpleafant ftate of things  
on our weilern frontier, it is proper for me to mention,  
the attempts of foreign agents. to alienate the affection  
of the Indian nations, and to excite them to actual hof-  
tilities againft the United States ; great activity has been  
exerted by thefe perfons, who have infinuated themfelves.

I: is my duty to recommend to your ferious confi.  
deration, thofe objects, which by the conftitution are  
placed particuaiasly within your fphere, the nationa}  
debts, and taxes.  
  
Since the decay of the feudal fyftem, by which the  
public defence was provided tor, chiefly at the ex-  
pence of individuals,a fyftem of !oans has been intro-  
duced. Andas no nationcan raife within the year,  
by taxes, fafficient fums for its defence and military  
Operations intime of war, the {ums loaned and debts  
contra¢ted have neceffarily become the fubjedts of  
what have been called funding fyftems. The confe-  
quences arifing, from the continual accumulation of  
public debts in other countries, ought to admonith us,  
  
to be careful to prevent their growth in our own.  
‘Whe national defence mutt be provided tor, as well  
as the fup ort of goverement; but both fhould he  
accomplithed, as muca as poilible by loans. ‘The ef-  
timates for the fervice of the eafuing vear will by my  
dire&amp;tion be laid before you.  
  
Gentiemen -f the Senate, and  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefenratives.  
  
We are met together at a moft interefting period ;  
the fituations of the principal powers of Europe are  
fingular and portentous. Conneéted with fome by trea-  
ties,and with all by commerce, no important event there  
can beindifferent tous. Such circumftances call with  
peculiar importunity, not lefs, for adifpofition to unite  
in all thofe meafures,on which the honcur, fafety and  
profperity of our country depend, than for all the ex-  
értions of wifdom and firmnels.  
  
In all fuch meafures you may rely on my zealous and

Gentlemen of ihe Senate, and  
~ Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
. . I WAS for some time apprehensive, that -  
1t would be neccflary, on account,ef the con­  
tagious sickness which affliéted the city of  
Philadelphia, toconvene the national Legila­  
ture, at {ome other place. This mealure, it  
was desirable to avoid ; because it would oc­  
casion much public inconvenience, and acon­  
fiderable public expence, and add to the ca-  
Jamities of the inhabitants of this city, whole  
fulferings must have excited the {ympathy of  
all thair tellow-citizens. Therefore, after  
taking meaflures to alcertain the slate and de­  
cline of the fickne(s, I postponed my deter­  
mination, baving hopes,now happily realized,  
that, without hazard to&#x27;the lives or health of  
the members, Congress mighr aflemble at this  
place where it was next by law to meet. |  
submit, bowever, to your consideration, whe­  
ther a power to pofipone the meeting of  
Congress without passing the time fixed by  
the Constitution, upon {uch occasions, would  
not be a afeful amendment to the 3w of one  
thousand Tevea hundred and ninety-four,  
Altheugh I canaot yet congratulate you  
on the re-cftablithment of peace in Eutope,  
and the restoration of {ecunty to the persons  
and properties of our citzens, from injustice  
and violence at sea ; we have nevertheless a­  
bundant cause of gratitude to the Source of  
Benevolence and Influence forinterior Tran­  
guili(y and perlonal security : For propitious  
Seasons, prosperous Agriculture, produlive  
Fisheries, and General :mprovements : And  
above all, for a rational spirit of civil and  
religious Liberty, and a calm, but steady de­  
termination to support our Sovereignty, as  
well as our moral and religious principles,  
against all open and secret attacks.  
Our Eavoys Extraordinary to the French  
Republic, embarked, one in July, the other  
early in August, to join their Colleague in  
Holland.—] have received intelligence of the  
arrival of both of them in Holland, from  
whence they all proceeded on their journey  
to Paris, within a few days of the nineteenth  
of September. &#x27;Whatever may be the result  
of this Mission, 1 trust that nothing will have  
been omitted on my part to conduét the Ne­  
gotation to 2 {uccefsful conclusion, on such  
equitable terms, as may be compatable with  
the Safety, Honor and Interests of the United  
Stztes. Nothing in the mean time, will con­  
tiibute {o much to the preservation of Peace,  
and the attainment of Justice, as 2 mamfefta­  
tion of that energy and unanmimity, of which,  
on many former occasions, the People of the  
Uoited States, have given such memorable  
proofs ; and the exertion of thole resources,  
for national defence, which a benevolent  
Providence has kindly placed within Iheir  
power.  
It may be confidently asserted, that nothing  
~ has occured since the adjournment of Con­  
gress, which renders inegpedient those Pre­  
cautionary Measures recommended by me to  
the consideration of the two Houses, at the  
opening of your late extraordinary feflion.  
1£ that {yflem was then prudent, it ils more  
so now, as increasing depredations strengthen  
the reasons for its adoption.  
Indeced, whatever may be the iflue of the  
negociation with France, and whether the  
War in Europe is or is not to continue, I  
hold it most certain, that permanent tran­  
quility and order will not {oon be obtained.  
The state of society has {o long been disturb­  
ed, the sense of moral and religious -obliga­  
tions so much weakened, public faith and  
national honor have been so impaired, re{pe&amp;t  
to treatics has been so diminished, and the  
law of nations has loft so much of its force :  
while pride, ambition, avarice and violence  
have beeo so much unrestrained, there re­  
mains no reasonable ground on which to raise  
an expeélation; that a commer® without pro­  
teftion or defence will not be plundered.  
The tommerce of the United States, 1s el­  
fential, if not to their exiflence, at Icaﬁ to  
their ccmtort, their growth, profpernity and  
happinels. The genius, charalter and habits  
of the people are highly commertial. Their  
cities have been foimed and exist upon com­  
merce. Our agricalture, filheries, arts and  
manufaflures are conne@ed with and depend  
upon #. * In short commerce has made this  
country ‘what it is ;&#x27; and it cannot be destroy­  
ed or neglefled, without involving the people  
in poverty and distress. Great numbers are  
dire&amp;ly ahd f{olely supported by navigation.-  
The faith of society is pledged for the pre­  
servation of the rightsof commercial and fea­  
faring, no less than of the other citizens.—  
Urder this view of our affairs, 1 fhofuh: bfol_d  
myielt guilty of a 2 negleft of duty, i ore  
boyrfc rogr:co’;nmcnd tghal we should make eve-  
Ty exertion to protc&amp; our commerce, and to  
place our country in a {aitable poflure of de­  
fence, as the only ﬁ‘c means of preserving  
both. : &#x27; o T  
1 have entertained an expelation that 1t  
would have been in my power, at the opeming  
of this session, o have communicated to you  
the agrecable information of the due execu­  
tion of our treaty &#x27;v;ixh his C:g:;ohc Majff_‘y.

ativity has been exerted, by these persons,  
who have insinuated thenifelves among the

The commissioners appointed under the  
fifth article of the treaty of Amity, Com­  
mesce, and Navigation, between the United  
States and Great Britain, to ascertain the river,  
which was truly intended urder the name of  
the River St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty  
of Peace, met at Paffamaquoddv Bay, in Oc­  
tober, one thousand seven hundred and nine­  
ty-fix, and viewed the mouths of the Rivers  
in question, and the adjacent. shores and ll­  
flands, and being of opinion that aufual sur­  
veys of both rivers 1o their sources were ne­  
ceflary, gave to the Agents of the two Na­  
tions inftruttions for that purpose, and ad­  
journed to meet at Boston in August. They  
met, but the Surveys requiring more time  
than had been {uppofed, and not being then  
completed,the commiflioners again adjourned  
to meet at Providence in the Siate of Rhode-  
Hland, in June next, when we may expeét a  
final examination and decision.  
The commissioners appointed in pursuance  
of the sixth article of the treaty, met at Phi­  
ladelphia, in May lalt, to examine the ¢laims  
of Britith {ubjeéts for debts contraéted before  
the peace, and {hll remaining due to them  
from citizens or Inhabitants of the United  
States.,—Various causes have hitherto pre­  
vented any determinations, but the bufinefsis  
now resumed, and doubtless will be prosecu­  
ted without interruption,  
Several decisions, on the claims of citizens  
of the United States, for losses and damages  
{uftained by reason of irregular and illegal  
captures or condemnations of their veflels or  
other property, have been made by the com­  
miflioners in London, conformably to the  
seventh article of, the treaty. The sums  
awarded by the commissioners have been paid  
by the Britith government. A considerable  
number of other claims, where cofls and da­  
magerﬁd not captured property were the  
only bbjett in queition, have been decided by  
arbitration and the sums awarded to the citi­  
zens of the United States have also been paid.  
The commiflioners appointed agreeably to  
the twenty-firft article of our treaty with  
Spain, met at_Philadelphia in the summer  
past, to examine and decide on the claims of  
our citizens for losses they have fuflained in  
consequence of their veflels and cargoes hav­  
ing been taken by the fubjels of his cathohic.  
Majefly, during the late war between Spain  
and France., The fittings have been interrup­  
ted but are now resumed.  
The United States being obligated to make  
compensation for the losses and damages sus­  
tained by British fubjeéls upon the award of  
the commissioners aéting under the {fixth ar­  
ticle of the treaty with Great Britain ; and  
for the losses and damages fullained by Brit­  
ith fubje@s by reason of the capture of their  
veflels and merchandize taken within the  
limits &amp; jurifdiétion of the U. S. and brought  
into their ports, or taken by veflels originally  
armed in ports of the U. S. upon the awards  
of the commifhoners afting under the seventh  
article of the {ame treaty ; itis neceflary that  
provision be made for fulfilling these obliga­  
tions. bn  
The numerous captures of American vel­  
fels by the cruizers of the French Republic,  
and of {ome by those of Spain, have occa­  
sioned considerable expences in making and  
{upporting the claims of our citizens before  
their tribupals. The sums gequired for the  
purpose have, in divers inflances, been dis­  
bursed by the Consuls of the United States.  
By means of the {ame captures, great num­  
bers of our seamen have been thrown athore  
in foreign countries destitute of all means of  
subsistence ; and the sick, in particular, bave  
been exposed to grievous fufferings. The  
Conf{uls have, in these cases, also advanced  
monies for their relief. For these advances  
they reasonably expe&amp; reimbursements from  
the United States.

infpeétion of the regifier and sea letters,  
&quot; Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
It is my duty to recommend to your seri­  
ous consideration those objefts which, by the  
Conflitution, are placed particularly within  
your {phere, the national debt and taxes.  
Since the decay of the Feudal System, by  
which the public defence was provided for,  
chiefly at the expense of individuals, the  
fyfltem of Loans has been introduced. And  
as no nation can raise within the year, by  
taxes, fufficient sums for its defence and mili.  
tary operations in time of war, the sums loan­  
ed and debts contrafled, have neceflarily be­  
come the fubje&amp;t of what have been called  
funding systems. e e 2  
The consequences arising from the continual  
-accumulation of public debts in other coun­  
tries, ought to admonish us to be carefal 1o  
prevent their growth in our own. The na­  
tional defence mufl be provided for, as well  
as- the support of &amp;ycmmcnt ; but both  
should be accomplished as much as possible  
by immediate taxes,and as little as poflible by  
loans. ° : : 8  
The cflimates for the service of the ensuing  
year will by my direflion, be laid before you.  
- “Gentlemen of the Senate, and oty  
Gentlemen of the House of chr;{c’ntatigles,  
. We are met together at a molt interesting  
~period. The situation of the principal pow­  
“ers of Europe, are singular and &#x27;portentous.  
Conne@ed with some by treaties, and with  
all by commerce, no important event there  
can be indifferent to us.—Such circumitances  
-call, with peculiar itopdrtunity, not less for  
  
a disposition ta unite in all thole mealares on

peace, met at Paramaquedy Bay ia Oftober 1796, and  
viewed the moaths of the rivers in queftion,; and the  
adjacent fhores and iflands, ahd, being of opinion that  
the actual furveys of both rivers to their fources were  
neceflary, gave to the agents of the two nations inftruc-

in Auguft. They met, but the furveys requiring more  
time than had been {uppofed, and not being then com-  
pleted, the Commifiioners again adjourned, to meet at  
Providence, in the State of Rhode Ifand, in June  
next, when we may expect a final examination and de-  
cifion. .  
“ The Commiffioners appointed in purfuance of the  
6th article of the treaty, met at Philadelphia in May

contracted before the peace, and {till remaining due to  
them from citizens or inhabitants of the United States.  
Various caufes have hitherto prevented any determina-

will be profecuted without interruption. Several deci-  
fions, on the claims of citizens of the United States,  
for lofles and :damages fuftained by reafon of irregular  
and illegal captures, or condemnations of their veffels  
or other property, have been made by the Commiffion-  
ers in London, conformably to the feventh article of  
the treaty. The fums awarded by the Commiffioners  
have been paid by the Britith Government. A confi-  
derable number of other ¢laims, where cofts and da-  
mages, aod not Captured property, were the only ob-  
jeéts in queftion, have been decided by arbitration, and  
the fums awatded to the citizens of the United States  
have alfo been paid.  
“ The Commiffioners appointed agreeably to the 21{t  
article uf our treaty with Spain, met at Philadelphia, in  
the fummer paft, to examine and decide on the claims  
of our citizens for loffes they have fultained, in confe-

5 Since the decay of .the feudal fyftem, by which  
the public defence was previded for, chiefly at the ex-  
pence of individuals, the fyftem of loans has been intro-  
duced ; and as no nation can raife within the year, by  
taxes, fufficient fums for its defence and military opera-  
tion in time of war, the fum loaned and debts conttact-  
ed have neceflarily become the fubje&amp; of what have  
been called the funding fyftems. ;  
« The confequences arifing from the continual accu-  
mulation of public debts in other countries ought to ad-  
monifh us to be careful to prevent their growth in our  
own. The national defence muft be provided for, as  
well as the fupport of Government ; but both fhould be  
accomplifhed as much as poflible by immediate taxes,  
andas little as poffible by loans.

It is my duty to recommend to your ferious

Since the decay of the feudal fyltcm, by which  
the public defence was jffovMed for, chiefly at  
theex/nce of individuals, the fyflem of loans  
has been introduced; and as no nation can raife,  
within the year, i&gt;y taxes, fmhtieut iuiiis for  
its defence and military operations in time of  
war, the fums loaned, and debts contracted have  
incceirarily become the fubjects of what have  
been -called funding fyitemsj the cnnfequcnccs  
ariling from th~ conllant accumulation of pub-  
lic debts, in other countries ought to admonilh  
lis, to be careful to prevent their growth in our  
own— the national defence mult be providedfor  
as well as the fupport of government, but both  
fliould be accompliflied as much as pollible by i.r.-  
jnediate taxes, and as little as poilibL- by loans.  
  
The eftimater. for tlie lcrvice of tlie enfuing  
year s»il! by my direction lie laid before you.

The death of general Wayne, which happened in  
^he end of 1796, and the expiration of the presiden­  
cy of general Washington alone prevented the trial  
of Wilkinson on charges of treason. No sooner was  
Mr. Adams elected, than general Wilkinson hurri­

“Since the decay of the feudal system, by which the public

the system of loans has been introduced ; and as no nation can  
raise within the year, by taxes, sufficient sums for defence and  
military operations in time of war, the sums loaned out and  
debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects of what  
have been called ‘funding systems.’ The consequences arising

“T was for some time apprehensive that it would be nec-  
essary, on account of the contagious sickness which afflicted  
the city of Philadelphia, to convene the national legislature  
at some other place. This measure it was desirable to avoid,  
because it would occasion much public inconvenience and  
considerable public expense, and add to the calamities of  
the inhabitants of this city, whose sufferings must have ex-  
cited the sympathy of all their fellow-citizens; therefore,  
after taking measures to ascertain the state and decline of  
the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes,  
now happily realized, that, without hazard to the lives or  
health of the members, Congress might assemble at this  
place, where it was next by law to meet. I submit, however,  
to, your consideration whether a power to postpone the meet-  
ing of Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Con-
