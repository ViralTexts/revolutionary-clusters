State of North Carolina  
In General Assembly December 11th 1807.  
Resolved that, the General Assembly Do enter into a resolution of addressing the President of the United States to the following effect; and that His Excellency the Governor be requested to forward the same to him.  
  
To Thomas Jefferson—President of the United States.  
Sir,  
The General Assembly of the State of North Carolina, convened at a moment when the independence of their Country in whose welfare they feel and are on all occasions ready to manifest the liveliest solicitude, is attacked; When their rights are invaded, their Citizens seized, their property plundered and their remonstrances disregarded by a nation uniformly and notoriously  hostile, and who appeals only to power to justify her conduct: When the union of these States, which they sincerely desire may be perpetual, is endangered by the machinations of a disappointed Man and his adherents who have sought to subvert, because they could not direct the measures of Government, feel it their duty to assure you, Sir, of their entire approbation of those measures which have been pursued for the defence and interests of their common Country.  
We will not, Sir, recount the many benefits which You have borne to your Country from foreign Courts whilst engaged in the cause of freedom: We will not review the emenent advantages derived from your talents and virtues, whilst employed in high and responsible offices at home: Nor will the limits of an address permit us to enumerate the blessings which have flowed from the administration of our public affairs since the memorable period of 1801: We will only say that, in whatever point of view we regard you, whether in private or public life, we perceive such uniformity of conduct, such firmness of character, such entire resignation on the one hand, and so great ability to act on the other that, we have abundant reason to rejoice, that in a person called to preside in the Councils of his Country the Statesman, Philosopher and Patriot are so happily and conspicuously united.  
Although we are sensible that, to you Sir, whose time and talents have been entirely devoted to your Countrys good, the pleasures of domestic ease, and retirement from the busy scenes of life, would now be particularly inviting; yet when we reflect that the period is, probably, near at hand when the exercise of your patriotic virtues will be peculiarly important to your Country, perhaps essential to its preservation, we cannot forbear, most earnestly, to solicit that, at the next Presidential Election, you will not deny your Country men the pleasure of again selecting you for the discharge of those important duties, for the performance of which You appear so eminently qualified.  
And may that Being, who regulates the affairs of men below, when the period of our final seperation shall arrive, receive you into those mansions of bliss, reserved for those who have deserved well.

whilst engaged in the cause uf Freedom : We will  
not review the eminent advantages derived from  
your talents and virtues, whilst employed in high  
and responsible offices at home; nor will the limits  
of an address permit us to enumerate the blessings  
which have flowed from the administration of our  
publick affairs since the memorable period of 1801.  
We will only say, that in whatever point of view  
we tegard you, whether in private nr&#x27;publick hie,  
we perceive such uniformity of conduct, such firm­  
ness of character, such an entire resignation on the  
one hand, and so great ability to act on the other,  
that we have abundant reason to rejoice, that in a  
person called to preside in the counrils of his coun­  
try, the Statesman, Philosopher and Patriot are so  
happily and conspicuously united.  
Although we are sensible that you, Sir, whose  
time and talents have been entirely devoted to your  
country’s good, the pleasures of dnmestirk ease anti  
retirement from the busy.scenes.of life, would now be  
particularly inviting ; yet when we reflect that the  
peiiod is probably near at hand, when the exercise  
of your patriotick virtues will be particularly im­  
portant to your country, perhaps essential to its pre­  
servation, we cannot forbear most earnestly to so­  
licit, that at the next presidential election, you will  
not deny your countrymen the pleasure of again se­  
lecting you for the discharge of those important  
duties, lor the performance of which you appear so  
eminently qualified.—And may that Being who re­  
gulates the affairs of men below, when the period  
of our final separation shall arrive, receive you into  
those&#x27; mansions of bliss, reserved for those who  
have deserved well
