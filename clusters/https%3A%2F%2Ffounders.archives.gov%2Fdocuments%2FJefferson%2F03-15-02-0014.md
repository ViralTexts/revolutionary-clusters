Dear Sir  
						  
							Poplar Forest  
							Sep. 6. 19.  
						  
					  
					I had read in the Enquirer, and with great approbation the pieces signed Hampden, and have read them again with redoubled approbation in the copies you have been so kind as to send me. I subscribe to every tittle of them. they contain the true principles of the revolution of 1800. for that was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 76. was in it’s form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. the nation declared it’s will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election. over the judiciary department, the constitution had deprived them of their controul. that therefore has continued the reprobated system: and altho’ new matter has been occasionally incorporated into the oldmass, yet the leaven of the old mass seems to assimilate to itself the new; and after 20. years confirmation of the federated system by the voice of the nation, declared thro’ the medium of elections, we find the judiciary on every occasion, still driving us into consolidation. in denying the right they usurp of exclusively explaining the constitution, I go further than you do, if I understand rightly your quotation from the Federalist of an opinion that ‘the judiciary is the last resort in relation to the other departments of the government, but not in relation to the rights of the parties to the compact under which the judiciary is derived.’ if this opinion be sound, then indeed is our constitution a compleat felo de se. for intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independant, that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for the government of the others; and for to that one too which is unelected by, and independent of, the nation. for experience has already shewn that the impeachment it has provided is not even a scare-crow; that such opinions as the one you combat, sent cautiously out, as you observe also by detachment, not belonging to the case often, but sought for out of it, as if to rally the public opinion beforehand to their views, and to indicate the line they are to walk in, have been so quietly passed over as never to have excited animadversion, even in a speech of any one of the body entrusted with impeachment. the constitution, on this hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please. it should be remembered as an axiom of eternal truth in politics that whatever power in any government is independant, is absolute also; in theory only, at first, while the spirit of the people is up, but in practice as fast as that relaxes. independance can be trusted nowhere but with the people in mass. they are inherently independant of all but moral law. my construction of the constitution is very different from that you quote. it is that each department is truly independant of the others, and has an equal right to decide for itself what is the meaning of the constitution in the cases submitted to it’s action; and especially where it is to act ultimately and without appeal. I will explain myself by examples which, having occurred while I was in office, are better known to me and the principles which governed them.  
					A legislature had past the Sedition law. the federal courts had subjected to certain individuals to it’s penalties, of fine and imprisonment. on coming into office I released these individuals by the power of pardon committed to Executive discretion, which could never be more properly exercised than where citizens were suffering without the authority of law, or, which was equivalent, under a law unauthorised by the constitution, &amp; therefore null. In the case of Marbury and Madison, the federal judges declared that commissions, signed and sealed by the President, were valid, altho’ not delivered. I deemed delivery essential to compleat a deed, which, as long as it remains in the hands of the party, is as yet no deed, it is in posse only, but not in esse, and I withheld delivery of the Commissions. they cannot issue a Mandamus to the President or to any Executive legislature, or to any of their  officers.  
*the constitution controuling the Common law in this particular.  
when the British treaty of 180_ arrived, without any provision against the impressment of our seamen, I determined not to ratify it. the Senate thought I should ask their advice. I thought that would be a mockery of them when I was predetermined against following it should they advise it’s ratification. the constitution had made their advice necessary to confirm a treaty, but not to reject it. this has been blamed by some; but I have never doubted it’s soundness.   In the cases of two persons, antenati, under exactly similar circumstances, the federal court had determined that one of them (Duane), was not a citizen; the House of Representatives nevertheless determined that the other (Smith of S.C.) was a citizen, and admitted him to his seat in their body. Duane was a republican, &amp; Smith a federalist, and these decisions were during the federal ascendancy.  
					These are examples of my position that each of the three departments has equally the right to decide for itself what is it’s duty under the constitution, without any regard to what the others may have decided for themselves under a similar question.   But you intimate a wish that my opinion s

“In denying the right they [the Judiciary]  
usurp, of exelusively explaining the constitn­  
tion, I go further than you do, if I understand  
rightly your quotation from the Federalist, of&#x27;  
an opinion that ‘the judiciary is the last re­  
sort in relation to the other departments of  
the government, but not in relation to the  
rights of the parties to the compact under  
&#x27;which the judiciary is derived.” If this opin­  
ion be sound, then indeed is our constitution a  
complete felo de se. For intending to estab­  
lish three departments, co-ordinate and inde­  
pendent, that they might check and balance  
one andher, it has given, aceording to this  
“opinion, 1o one of them alone, the right to  
preseribe rules for the government of the oth­  
os, and to that one 100, which is unelected  
by, and independent as the nation. For ex­  
perience has already shown that the impeach­  
ment it has provided is not even a scare-crow;  
that such opinione as the one you combat,  
sent cautiously out, as you observe also, by  
detachment, not belonging to the case ofteny­  
‘but sought for out of it, as if to rally the pub­  
  
lic opinion beforehand to their views, and to  
indicate the line they are to walk in, have  
been 30 quietly passed over as never to have  
excited animadversion, even in a speech cf  
any one of the body entrusted with Impeach­  
ment. The eonstitution, on this hypothesis,  
is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the  
judiciary, which they may twist and shape in­  
to any form they please. It should be remem­  
bered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics,  
that whatever power in any government is  
independent, is absolute also ; in theory only,  
at first, while the spirit of the people is up,  
hut in practice, as fast as that relaxes. IN­  
DEPENDENCE CAN BE TRUSTED  
NO WHERE BUT WITH THE PEO­  
PLE IN MASS. They are inherently in­  
dependent of all jut moral law, My con­  
struction of the eonstitution is very different  
from that you quote. Itis that EicH DpE­  
&#x27;PARTMENT IS TRULY INDEPENDENT OF THE  
&#x27;OTHERS, AND HAS AN EQUAL RIGHT TO DECIDE  
FOR ITSELF WHAT 1S THE MEANING OF THE  
CONSTITUTION IN THE CASES SUBMITTED TO  
ITS ACTION ; AND ESPECIALLY, WHERE IT IS  
TO ACT ULTIMATELY AND WITHOUT APPEAL.  
I will explain myself by examples, which,  
hieving occurred while I was in office, are bet­  
ter known to me, and the principles which  
governea them.  
  
A legislature had passed the sedition-law.  
The federal courts had subjected certain in­  
dividuals to its penalities, of fine and impiis­  
onment. On coming into office, I reieased  
these individuals by the power of pardon com­  
mitted to executive diseretion, which eculd ne­  
ver be more proﬁg:r!y exercised than where  
citizens were sutfering without the authority  
of law, or, which was equivalent, under a law  
unauthorized by the censtitution, aud there­  
fore nulk. In the case of Marbury and Mad­  
ison, the federal judges declared that com­  
missions, gigned and sealed by the President,  
were valid, although not delivered. 1 deem­  
ed delivery essential to complete a deed,  
which, as long as it remains in the hands of  
the party, is as vet no deed, it is in posse on­  
ly, but not in esse, and I witheld delivery of  
the ecommissions. They cannot issue a manda­  
mus to the President or legislature, or to any  
of their officers.* When the British treaty of  
180- arrived, without any provision against  
the impressment of our seamen, 1 determined  
not to ratify it. The Senate thought I sheuld  
ask their advice. 1 thought that would be a  
mockery of them, when I was predetermined  
against following it, should they advise its  
ratification. The constitution had made their  
advice necessary to confirm a treaty, but not  
to reject it. This has been blamed by some;  
but I have never doubted its soundness.

known to me, and the principles which governed them.  
A legislature had passed the sedition law. The federal  
courts hud subjected certain individuals to its penalties, of  
fine nml imprisonment. On coming into office, I released  
(lie individuals by llie power of pardon committed to Exe­  
cutive discretion, which could never 1 o more proper­  
ly cxerci-ed than where citizens were suffering with­  
out the authority ol law, or which was equivalent,  
under a law unauthorised by the Constitution, and  
therefore null. In the case of Mai bury end Madi­  
son, the federal judges declared that commission* sign­  
ed ami scaled by the President, were valid although  
not delivered. I deemed delivery essential to com­  
plete a deed, which, as long as it remains in the  
hand* of the party, is as yet no deed, it is in posse only,

withheld the commissions. “ They cannot issue a man­  
damus to the President or legislature or to any ot their  
olficers—(the Constitution controlling the common law in  
this particularly.) When the Ihitish treaty nl 1.807 aniv­

mockery ol them w hen I was pie-dctcrmincd against  
following it, should they advise its ratification. The  
Constitu&#x27;ion had mule their advice necessary to con­  
firm a treaty, but not to reject it. This has been blamed  
by some; but I have never doubted its soundness. In the  
cases of two persons, antenati, under exactly similar cir­  
cumstances the federal court had determined that one of  
them (Duane) was not a ritizen ; the House of Represen­

South Carolina,) was a citizen, and admitted him lo n seat  
in their body. Duane was a republican, and Smith a fe­  
derVist, ami these decisions were during the federal as­  
cendancy. These are examples of iny position, that each  
of the three departments has equally the right to decide  
lor itself what is its duty under the Constitution, without  
any regard to what the others may have decided for them­

laving the question as he puts it:  
&quot;la denying the nglil they usurp of exclusively explainig  
the constitution, 1 go further than yen do, if I underand  
rightly your quotation I rum the Federalist, ot an opinio  
thai &#x27;the judiciary is ihe last resort in relation to the  
Jirr depart menu o( the government, but not ill relation to  
le rights of the parties to .lie compact under which the  
idunary is derived.&#x27; II this opinion he sound, then, ineea,  
is our constitution a complete felo ele $e. For Inieiidig  
lo establish three departments, co-ordinate and indeendent,  
that they might check and balance one another,  
Jius given, according to this opinion, to one of them alone  
le right to prescribe rules for the government of the others,  
ud lo ihat one, too, which is uuelectod by und independnl  
of ihe nation. For experience has already shown that  
to impeachment it lias provided is not even a acare-ciow ;  
idt such opinions us the one yon combat, sent cautiously  
at, as you observe also, by detachment, not&quot; belonging to  
te case oiten, hut sought lor out of it, as it to rally the pubc  
opinion beforehand to their views, and to indicate the  
no they aie to walk in, have been so quietly passed over  
i never to have excited animadversion, even in a speech  
I anyone of the body intrusted with impeachment. The  
institution, on this hypothesis, is a mere thing oi wax in  
le hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape  
  
in. i?njr i ji in uiL-y jiipano. tisiiouid i&gt;e remembered, us an  
tiotit of eternal truth in politics, that whatever power in  
&gt;y government is independent, is absolute also; in theory  
ily^at tlrst, while the spirit of the people is up, but in  
ractice as last as that relaxes. Independence can be  
usied nowhere but with the people in mass. They are  
iherently independent oi all but mora! law. My con  
ruction of the constitution is very ditferent Irotn that you  
note. It is that each department is truly independent of  
ie others, and has an equal right to decide lax itself what  
the meaning of the constitution in tho cases submitted to  
s action; ami especially where It is to act ultimately and  
ithout appeal. I will explain myself by examples,  
hich, having occurred wtula.1 was in office, are better  
lown to me, and the principles which governed them.  
&quot;A legislature had passed the sedition law. The federal  
&gt;urls had subjected certain individuals to its penalties of  
:ie and imprisonment. On coining into ollice, I released  
e?e individuals by the power of pardon committed to  
tectitive discretion, which could never bo more properly  
terctsed than where cituens were sintering without the  
ithority of law, or, which was equivalent, under a law  
lauthorixcd by the constitution, and therefore null, lit  
e case ot Marhury and Madison, the lederal judges deared  
that commissions, signed and sealed by the Presitnt,  
were vulid, although not delivered. I deemed delivy  
essential to complete a deed, which, as long as it renins  
in the hands of the party, is as yet no deed ; it is in  
tie only, but not in tut, and 1 withheld delivery of the  
iminisstons. They cannot issue a mandamus to the Presi)itt  
or legislature, or to any of their officers * When the  
ritish troaty of ISO- arrived, without any provision against  
e impressment of our seamen, I determined not to ratify  
Tito Senate thought 1 should ask their advice. 1  
ought that would lie a mockery of them, when 1 was  
cduiermtried against following it, should litey advise its  
lidcation. The constitution hn&lt;l iK^ir nilvi^w  
  
ssary to confirm a treaty, but not to reject it, Thi? ban  
en blamed by soino ; but I have never doubted its soundss.  
In the cases ol&quot; two persons, aiittnnli, under exuetly  
nilar circumstances, the federal court had determined  
at one of them (Lhiaue) was not a citizen ; the House of  
spreseuutivvs, nevertheless, determined that the other  
midi, of Mouth Carolina) was a citizen, and admitted  
it to bis seat in their body. D iane was a republican,  
d Mmtih n federalist, and these decisions were during  
i federal ascendency.  
&quot;These are examples of mv position, that each or the  
ree departments has equally the right to decide lor itsell  
lal is it-&gt; duty under the constitution, without any regard  
what the others may have decided for themselves under  
iinilar question.

Dear Sir: I read in the Eaguirer, and with  
great approbation, the pieces signed Hampden,  
and have read them again with redoubled ap,­  
probation, in the copies you have been so kind  
as to send me. I subscribe to every title of  
them. They contain the true principles of the  
revolution of 1800, for that was as real a revo-­  
lutlon in the principles of our government as  
that of 177 was in its form, not effected indeed  
by the sword, as that, but by the rational and  
principal instrument of reform, the suffrage of  
utien dols d wo y ianssir  
functionaries of one principle and, electing those  
of another in the two branches, executive and  
legislative, submitted to their election. Over  
the judiciary department, the constitution had  
deprived them of their control. That, there  
fore, has continued the reprobated system, and  
althoughmew matter has been occasionally in­  
corporated into the old, wet the leaven of the  
old mass scems to assimilate to itself the new.  
and after twenty years&#x27; confirmation of the fed­  
erated system by the voice of the nation, declar­  
ed through the medium of elections, we find the  
indiciary on every occasion still driving us on  
to consolidation  
In denying the right they usurp of exclusive-­  
ly explaining the constitution, I go further than  
yon do if I understand rightly your quatation  
from the Eesderalist, of an opinion that &quot;the ju-­  
diciary is the last resort in relation to the other  
depariments of the Government, but not in re  
lation to the rights of the parties to the compact  
under which the judiciary is derived.&quot; If this  
opinion be sound, then indeed is our constitu  
tion a complete elo de se. For intending to es­  
tablish three departments, cosordinate and ine­  
dependent, that they might check and balance  
one another, it has given, according to this opin­  
ion, to one of them alone, the right to prescribe  
rules for the Government of the others, and to  
that one, too, which is unelected by, and inde­  
pendent of the nation.  
For experience has already shown that the  
impeachment it has provided is not even a scare-­  
crow; that such opinions as the one you combat,  
sent cautiously out, as you observe also, by de  
tachment, nor belonging to the case often, but  
sought for out of it, as if to rally the public  
opition beforchand to their views, and to indi­  
cate the line they are to walk in, have been so  
quietdy passed over as never to have excited  
animadversion, even in a speech of any one of  
the body entrusted with impeachment. The  
constitution, on this hypothesi, is a mere thing  
of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which  
they may twist and shape into any form they  
please.  
It should be remembered, as an axiom of  
eternal truth in politics, that whatever power  
in any government is independent, is absolute  
also, in theory only, at first, while the spirit of  
the people is up, but in practice, as fast as that  
relaxes. Independence can be triisted nowhere  
but with the people in mass. They are inhe  
rently independent of all but moral law.My  
construction of the constitation is very different  
from that you quote. It is that cach depart,­  
ment is truly independent of the othersy and  
has an equal right to decide for itself what is  
the meaning of the constitution in the cases  
submitted to its action; and especially, where it  
is to act ultimately and without appeal. I will  
explain myself by examples, which, having oc  
curred while I was in office, are better known  
to me, and the principles which governed them  
A legislature had passed the sedition law.  
The federal courts had subjected certain indivie  
duals to its penalties of fine and imprisonment.  
On coming into office, I released these jodlvidu  
als by the power of pardon committed to exe  
cutive discretion, which could never be more proe­  
perly exercised than where citizens were suffering  
without the authority of law, or, which was  
equivalent, under a law unauthorized by the  
constitution, and therefore null. in the case of  
Aarbury and Madison, the federal judges de­  
elared that commissions, signed and sealed by  
the President, were valid, although not deliver  
ed. I deemed delivery essential to complete a  
deed, which, as long as it remains in the hands  
of the party, is as yet no deed, it is in posse  
only, but not in esse, and I withheld delivery of  
the commissions.  
They cannot issue a mandamus to the presi­  
dent or legislature, or to any of their officerg  
When the British treaty of-arrived, with  
out any provision against the imprisonmont of  
our scamen, I determined not to ratify it. The  
Senate thought I should ask their advice. I  
thought that would be a mockery of them when  
I was predetermined against following it, should  
they advise its ratification. The constitution  
had made their advice necessary to confirm a  
treaty, but not to reject it. This has been  
blamed by some, but I have never doubted its  
soundness.  
In the cases of two persons, antenats, under  
exactly similar circumstances, the federal court  
had determined that one of them (Duane) was  
not a citizen; the House of Representatives, nev  
ertheless, determined that the other GSmith of  
South Carolina) was a citizen and admitted him  
to his seat in this body. Duane was a republie­  
can, and Smith a federalist, and these decisions  
were made during the federal ascendaney.  
These are examples of my position, that each  
of the three departments has equally the right  
to decise for itself what is its duty under the  
cunstitution; withont any ragard to what the  
others may have decided for themselves under a  
similar question

electing those of another iu the two branches, execu­

power, in any Government, is independent, is  
absolute also; in theory only at first, while the  
spirit of the people is up, but in practice as fast  
as that relaxes. Independence can be trusted no  
where but with the people in mass. They are  
inherently independent of all but moral law.

&quot;iMv construction ot the Constitution is very  
(filler cut from what you quote. It is that each  
department is truly independent ot the others.  
aud lias an equal right to deei Ie lor itself what  
is the meaning or the Constitution in the cases  
submitted lo its action; and cspeciullv when it  
is 10 act ultimately and w ithout appeal. 1 will  
explain myself by examples, which, having  
occurred while I was m ollice, aro better Known  
to me, and tho principles which governed them  
&quot;A legislature had passed the Sedition law.  
The Federal courts had subjected certain indi  
viduals to its penaltie?of flue aud imprisonment.  
On coming into office, 1 released these indi  
viduals by the power of pardon committed to  
Executive discretion, which could never bp more  
appiopriHttIv exercised than when citizens wero  
Buttering without the authority of law, or. which  
waseouivalent. under a law unauthorized bv the  
Con&#x27; titution, and therefore &#x27;null. In the case of  
Mnibury nud Madison, the Federal judges de  
clared that commissions signed anl sealed by tho  
Prtsident were valid, although not delivered. I  
deemed delivery es&#x27;-entiul to eouiplete a deed,  
which as long as it remains iu the hands of tho  
party is, as yet, no deed, and I withheld  
the delivery ot the commissions. They  
cannot issue a mandamus to the President  
or the Legislature, or to any of their officers.  
When the British treaty ol . arrived, without  
any provision agaiust the Impressment of our  
seamen, I determined not to ratify it. The  
Senate thought I should ask their advice,  
thought thut would be a mockery of them, when  
1 was predetermined agaiut following it, should  
they advise its ratification. The Constitution  
bad made their advice necpssary to confirm  
treaty, but not to reject it. This has been blamed  
by some, but I have never doubted its sound­  
uiss. In the caies ol two persons ante-nati,  
under exactly similar circumstances, the Federal  
Court determined that one of them (Duane) was  
not a citizen; the House ot Representatives  
nevertheless determined that tho othor (Smith  
oi boutu Carolina) was a cuueu; aud uduiiue  
  
lilm to a sent in fbeir body. Duano was a Ro  
pi.bllcHn and Smith a Federalist, and these de­  
cisions were made during the Federal ascen­  
dancy.&quot;&#x27;lhce are examples of my position, that each  
of ihe three departments has equally the riaht  
to decide tor itself what is It duty under tho  
Constitution, without icgsrd to whnt the others  
n 8V have decided for themselves underasimilar

anch. Had these states  
been allowed the rights to which they are so  
;n.i. .nt;lnd th vote of the senate on hi-  
day last would have stood, ayes 33, noes 37.  
Before entering upon the execution of his of-  
fioe. President Johnson took the following  
oath:  
J do solemnly &#x27;swear that I will -faithfully  
il nMat of President of the United  
States, and will, to the best of my ability, PRE  
SERVE, rROTICT AND DEFEXD tflC WBimw  
of the United States.  
He will keep this oath, in its letter and its  
spirit, like his illustrious predecessors, Jeff.  
nnn n4 .Taeknon. Mr. Jefferson said in a  
letter to Spencer Roane :  
Each department is truly independent of  
nthara and naa an eauai rizat to ubuiud  
for itself what is the meaning of the const!  
tntinn in the cases sabmitted to its action  
and especially when it is to act ultimately  
and without appeal.  
This was precisely the doctrine of General  
.T&amp;iknnn- and he acted tinon it! Mr. Jefler-  
illustrates his meaning by several examples  
whioh hi occurred daring his presidency,  
whnn attempts were made to trample under  
foot state laws and state rights :  
A legislature had passed the sedition law  
Tha federal courts bad .ubieoted certain in  
dividuals to its penalties of fine and impris  
onment. On oominz into office, I released  
these individuals by the power of pardon  
committed to executive discretion, wuioh  
could never be more appropriately exercised  
than when citizens were suffering without  
the authority of law, or, which was equiva  
lent, under a law unauthorized by the oooeti  
totion, and therefore null. In the case of  
Marbury and Madison, the federal judges de­  
clared that commissions signed and sealed by  
the president were valid, although not dehv  
ered. I deemed delivery essential to com  
plete a deed, which as long as it remains in  
the hands of the party is, as yet, no deed.  
and I withheld the delivery ot tne commis  
sions. Thev cannot issue a mandamus to  
the president or the legislature, or to any ot  
their officers. When the British treaty of  
arrived, without any provision against  
the impressment of our seamen, 1 datermin  
ed not to ratify it. The senate thought I  
should ask their advice. I thought that

predetermined against following it, should  
they advise its ratification. The constitution  
had made their advice necessary to confirm a  
treaty, but not to reject it. This has been  
blamed by some ; but I have never doubted  
its soundness. In the cases of two persons  
ante nati, under exactly similar circumsuno  
es, the federal court determined that one of  
them (Duaae) was not a citizen ; the houe  
of representatives nevertheless determine!  
that the other (Smith, of North Carolina,)  
was a citizen, and admitted him to a seat in  
their body. Daane was a republican and  
Smith a federalist, and their decisions were  
made during the federal ascendency.  
These are the examples of my position,  
that each of the three departments has equal  
ly the right to deoide for itself what is its da  
ty under the constitution, without regard to  
what the others may have decided for them­  
selves under a similar question.
