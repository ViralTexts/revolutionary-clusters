 attention.The character of the “impression emblematic of Liberty” on our coins, does not appear, from any records I have seen, to have been determined by specific instructions from the Government: nor has it been settled by any uniform practice here. The Journals of the Senate, and other notices of the proceedings of Congress, show that the head of the President was at first intended as the device for one side of the coins, and that the House of Representatives substituted the words now in the Law; but neither the Journals, nor the brief notice which the papers contain of the debates of that period, give any indication of the percise emblem intended.The first coins struck were cents, in 1793, on which the emblem adopted was a female head, with hair wildly flying behind. In 1795 the Cap of Liberty was introduced supported on a wand projecting behind the  head. In 1796 or 97 the Cap was discarded and has not since been restored.In 1794 the first silver coins were struck. The head of Liberty was here also adopted, with flowing hair, without the accompanyment of a Cap. This stile was retained on the silver coins, with slight modification,  until about the year 1808, when Mr Patterson procured a more pleasing head of Liberty, and ornamented it with a dress, not intended as I learn from the officers of the Mint to represent the Cap of Liberty, nor approaching it in form, but taken from life and considered as a model in good taste of the fashion of the time. The “inscription of the word Liberty” was at the same period transferred from the margin of the coin, to the band of the Cap. This head dress continues to the present day on the silver coins since issued, but has never been adopted on the dollar, none having been struck, nor any new die of that denomination  made since 1805.The first gold coins were struck in 1795. The head on them was from the first ornamented with a cap head dress; not the Liberty cap in f
