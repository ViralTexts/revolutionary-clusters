You have torn thousands of these unfortunate people from their homes, &amp; from every object of their affections, &amp; drag’d them together into these southern states to the horrors of a mutual servitude, that ends only with their lives! You are daily driving them in droves like cattle &amp; horse; linked together in chains from one state in the union to another, where they &amp; their children are brought up in ignorance &amp; hardships, &amp; expos’d to every vice &amp; folly, which is disgraceful to man &amp; abhorant to God!

1st. “With what execration should that statesman be loaded, who permiting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other; transforms those into despots &amp; these into enemies; destroys the morrels of the one part, &amp; the amor patria of the other. And can the liberties of a nation be tho’t secure, when we have remov’d their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people, that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated, but with his wrath. Indeed I tremble for my country, when I reflect that God is just, &amp; that his justice cannot sleep forever: that considering numbers, nature &amp; natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune; and exchange of situations is among possable events; That it may become provable by super-natural interferance.” See Notes on Virg. By Tho. Jefferson Esq.  
2d. “With regard to the Slave-Trade, Root &amp; Branch, First &amp; Last, in all its motives, measures, concomitints and consequences, if ever any human undertaking merited the deepest abhorance of man, &amp; the heavi[e]st curse of Almighty God, it is surely that.” See a Compend. of history, By Saml. Whelply.  
3d.  
  
“O! execrable son, so to aspire,  
Above his brother, to himself assigning,  
Authority userpt, from God not given;  
He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl  
Dominion absolute, but man over man  
He made not Lord, such title to himself  
Reserving, human left from human free.”  
See the great Milton.  
  
4th. “They, who go out as Piraters, &amp; take away poor Africans, or people of any other land, who never forfeted life or liberty, &amp; carry them into slavery, are the wo[r]st of Robbers, and ought to be consider’d the common enemies of mankind, &amp; that all they who buy them of those inhuman Robbers &amp; use them as mere beasts of burthen for their own convenience; regardless of their spiritual welfair, are fitter to be called Demons than Christians.” See Richd.

… My ear is pain’d, (says Mr. Cowper)

Of rong &amp; outrage with which this earth is fill’d,

And more than all, &amp; most to be deplor’d  
  
As human natures broadest, foulest blot,  
Chains him, tasks him, &amp; exacts his sweat,  
With stripes, that mercy with a bleeding heart  
Weeps, when she sees inflicted on a beast.  
Then, what is man? &amp; what man seeing this  
And having human feelings, does not blush  
And hang his head to think himself a man.”  
  
Its verry surpriseing Sir, that the agents of the people in these southern states, who talk in a very high strain of freedom &amp; political liberty, should make no scruple of reducing one half or more of their whole population into circumstanc

How can that be rong (says the slave-holder) which has been the sanction of the fathers &amp; polititions so many years, &amp; which is the source of our wealth, ease &amp; happines?  
In cases like the present, multitudes, antiquity, wealth, eas[e] &amp; happiness, prove nothing. The fact is, here are millions of men, women &amp; children, deprived of the rights of their nature, and suffering all the consequences of that deprivation. They have in despite of all the rights of humanity, been forced across the ocean; &amp; they &amp; their posterity bound to the severest labour. The consequences, alass are obvious &amp; too painful to relate.  
Immortal soles in slavery! Subjects of the grace of God, &amp; the purchase of the precious blood of Jesus Christ in slavery! Beings capable of all the blessings of civil society, deprived of them all, to administer to the vices &amp; pleasures of others!

It is not imposable that you &amp; your children may have the same measure meated back to you again. It is no uncommon thing with God to reward men according to their works, even in this world.  
Slavery omits the waiter [sic] matters of the law, therefore its unlawful &amp; unscriptural. A Christian must do unto others, what he would that others should do unto him; but no slave-holder would have others to enslave himse[l]f: therefore, slavery is contrary to christ[i]anity.
