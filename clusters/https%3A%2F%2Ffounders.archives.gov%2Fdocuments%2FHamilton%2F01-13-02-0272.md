resent state of the establishments in Massachusetts for the direction and safety of navigation made to this office by the Superintendent thereof, in pursuance of a late circular instruction, I perceive a proviso in the copy of the Act of cession, which appears to render the same of no effect, under the Act of Congress of the 7th. of August 1789, “for the establishment, and support of light houses, Beacons, Buoys and public piers” and which also appears to be inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States.  
The proviso of the Act of the legislature of Massachusetts is in the words following—  
“Provided also that all civil and criminal process issued under the authority of this commonwealth or any officers thereof may be executed on any of said Lands or in any of said buildings, in the same way and manner as if the Jurisdiction had not been ceded as aforesaid.”  
I have the honor to make you this communication for the purpose of obtaining the Attorney generals opinions—  
1st   Whether the cession contemplated in the Act of the legislature of Massachusetts is made in such manner as to be availing and of effect under the Constitution of the United States, And  
2dly   Whether the said Cession is made in such manner as to be availing and of effect under the Act of

a State, under any qualification of that consent  
which would deprive them of exclusive legislation  
over the place. But the Supreme Oourt held that  
exclusive jurisdiction means exclusive legislation,  
and vice versa, and that the retention by a State of  
the right to serve process within its ceded lands,  
was not a reservation of sovereignty or jurisdiction  
over them. All haveit. See what is said by Kent  
(vol. 1, p. 429): ‘‘The question which has arisen on  
the subject was as to the effect of the proviso or reser-  
vation usually annexed to the consent of the State,  
that all civil and criminal process, issued under the  
authority of the State, might be executed on the  
lands so ceded, in like manner as if the cession had  
not been made. This point was much discussed in  
the Circuit Court of the United States, in the case  
of U.S. vs. Cornell. (2 Mason 70-91, U.S. v.  
Davis, 5 ib., 356.) ‘It was held that a purchase of  
lands within the jurisdiction of a State, with the  
consent of the State, for the national purposes con-  
templated by the Constitution, did, ipso facto, by  
the very terms of the Constitution, fall within the
