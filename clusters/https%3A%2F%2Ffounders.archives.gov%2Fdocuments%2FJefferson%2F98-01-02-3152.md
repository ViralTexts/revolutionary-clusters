I have to acknolege  your favor of the 4th instant, which gives me the first information I had ever recieved that the laurels which Colo Campbell so honorably won in the battle of King’s mountain had ever been brought into question by any one. to him has been ever ascribed so much of the success of that brilliant action as the valour and conduct of an able commander might justly claim. this lessens nothing the merits of his companions in arms, officers and souldiers, who all, and every one, acted well their parts in their respective stations. I have no papers on this subject in my possession, all such recieved at that day having belonged to the records of the council: but I remember well the deep and grateful impression made on the mind of every one by that memorable victory—it was the joyful annunciation of that turn of the tide of success which terminated the revolutionary war, with the seal of our independance. the slighting expression complained of as hazarded by the venerable Shelby, might seem inexcusable in a younger man; but he was then old, and I can assure you, dear Sir, from mortifying experience, that the lapses of memory of an old man, are innocent subjects of compassion, more than of blame. the descendants of Colo Campbell may rest their heads quietly on the pillow of his renown. history has consecrated, and will for-ever preserve it in the faithful annals of a grateful country. with the expressions of the high sense I entertain of his character, accept the assurance to yourself of my great esteem &amp; respect.

on this subject in my possession, all such re­  
ceived at that day having belonged tu the  
records of the Council ; but I remember well  
I he deep aud grateful impression made on the  
mind of every one hy that memorable victory.  
It was the joyful annunciation of that turn in  
the tide of success which terminated the revo­

seem inexcusable in a younger man: but lie  
was then old ; and I can assure, dear sir, from  
mortifying experience, that the lapse* of me­

compassion more than of blame. The des­  
cendants of Col. Campbell may rest their  
beads quietly on the pillow of his renown.  
History has consecrated and will forever pre­
