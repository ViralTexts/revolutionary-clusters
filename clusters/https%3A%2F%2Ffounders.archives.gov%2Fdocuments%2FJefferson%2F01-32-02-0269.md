Whereas on an election of President or V. President of the US. questions may arise  
whether an elector has been appointed in such manner as the  legislature of his state may have directed?  
whether the time at which he was chosen, &amp; the day on which he gave his vote, were those determined by Congress?  
whether he were not at the time, a Senator or Representative of the US. or held an office of trust or profit under the US.?  
whether one at least of the persons he has voted for is an inhabitant of a state other than his own?  
whether the electors voted by ballot, &amp; have signed certified &amp; transmitted  to the President of the Senate a list of all of the persons voted for, &amp; of the number of votes for each?  
whether the persons voted for are natural born citizens, or were citizens of the US. at the time of the adoption of the constitution, were 35 years old, &amp; had been 14. years resident within the US.?  
And the constitution of the US. having directed that ‘the President of the Senate shall in the presence of the Senate &amp; H. of Representatives, open all the certificates &amp; that the votes shall then be counted.’ from which is most reasonably inferred that they are to be counted by the members composing the said houses &amp; brought there for that office, no other being assigned them; &amp; inferred the more reasonably, as thereby the constitutional weight of each state in the election of those high officers is exactly preserved in the tribunal which is to judge of it’s validity, the number of Senators &amp; Representatives from each state composing the said tribunal being exactly that of the electors of the same state:  
Be it therefore enacted &amp;c [here insert the former clause.]  
Provided that the certificate of the Executive of any state shall be conclusive evidence that the requisite number of votes has been given for each elector named by him as such. [here add all other limitations on the preceding questions which may be thought proper; stating what the two houses shall not decide.]  
And be it further enacted that whensoever the vote of one or more of the electors of any state shall for any cause whatever be adjudged invalid, it shall be lawful for the Senators &amp; Representatives of the said state, either in the presence of the two houses, or separately &amp; withdrawn from them to decide by their own votes to which of the persons voted for by any of the electors of their state [or to what person]  the invalid vote or votes shall be given; for which purpose they shall be allowed the term of [one hour] and no longer, during which no other certificate shall be opened or proceeded on.

a mode authorized by the Legislature of his State or not:

as, one of her grandfathers, who was a U.S.  
Senator from Virginia in 1800, and who was an intimate  
friend of Jefferson&#x27;s. In the year 1800 there was some  
discussion in Congress concerning the method of count­  
ing the electoral votes, and this memorandum was prob­  
ably written at that time by Jefferson, who was a ca  
or the Presidency, and sent to Mr. Nicholas for his  
use in the debates on the subject. Miss Randolph had  
the document photographed, and sent one of the photo­  
graphs to The world of this city, which yesterday printed  
an engraving of it. The following are the words of the  
memorandum:  
Whereas, on an election of President or Vice President  
of the United States questions may arise whether an  
such manner as th  
lature of his State may have directed? Whether the  
time at which he was chosen, and the day on which he  
are those determined by,  
Whether he were not at the time a Senator or Repre  
or held an office of trust or profit  
under the United States! Whether one at least  
persons he has voted for is an inhabitant of a State­  
other than his own? Whether the electors  
by ballot and have signed, cortified and tral  
the President of the Senate a list of all the persons voted  
for and of the number of voters for each? Whether the  
persons voted for are natural born citizens or were citi  
zens of the United States at the time of the adoption of  
the Constitution, were thirty-five years old and had  
fourteen years resident within the United States. And  
States having directed  
President of the Senate shalf in the  
presence of the Senate and Houss of Representatives

w York World publishes a fae simile of it  
a memorandum, said to be in the hand­  
writing of Thomas Jefferson, which is sup­  
pose to have an important bearing on the  
question, and to give his views thereon.  
The paper or memorandum was discovered  
by Miss Sarah Nichols Randolph--daugh­  
ter of Thomas Jefferson Randolph, the  
grandson and executor of Jefferson  
among the papers of her grandfather,  
Wilson Cary Nicholas, an intimate friend of  
Jefferson, who was United States senator  
from Virginia from 1790 to 1804, aud sub­  
sequently a member of the house. The  
document is without date and is as follows:  
Whereas, On an election of president  
or vice president of the United States ques­  
tions may arise whether an elector has  
been appointed in such manner as the legis­  
lature of his state may have directed?  
Whether the time at the time at which he  
was chosen, and the day on which he gave  
his vote were those determined by con­  
gress? Whether he were not at the time a  
senator or representative of the United  
States, or held an office of trust or profit  
under the United States? Whether one at  
least of the persons he has voted for is an  
inhabitant of a state other than his own?  
Whether the electors voted by ballot and  
have signed, certified and transmitted to the  
president of the senate a list of all the per­  
sons voted for and of the number of voters  
for each? Whether the persons voted for  
are natural born citizens or were citizens of  
the United States at the time of the adoption  
of the Constitution, were thirty-five years  
old and had been tourteen years res­  
ident within the United States. And  
the Constitution of the United States hav­  
ing directed that &quot;the president of the  
senate shall in the presence of the senate  
and house of representative open all the  
certificates, and that the votes shall then  
be counted,&quot; from which is most reason­  
ably inferred that they are to be counted  
by the members composing the said houses  
and brought there for that office, no other  
being assigned them, and inferred the more  
reasonably as thereby the Constitutional  
weight of each state in the election of those  
high officers is exactly preserved in the tri-  
bunal which is to judge of its validity, the  
number of senators and representatives  
from each state composing the said tribu­  
nal being exactly that of the electors of the  
same state.  
Be it therefore enacted, etc. THere insert  
the former clause.! Provided, That the  
certificate of the executive of the State  
shall be conclusive evidence that the re­  
quisite number of votes has been given for  
each elector named by him as such. (Here  
add all other limitations or the preceding  
questions, which may be thought proper;

state, either in the presence of the two  
houses or separately, and withdrawn from  
them to decide by their own votes to which  
of the persons voted for by any of the elec-  
tors of their state (or to what person) the

olas, one of her grandfathers, who was  
a U. S. Senator from Virginia in 1800, and  
who was an intimate friend of Jefferson’s—  
In the year 1800 there was some discussion  
in Congress concerning the method of count­  
ing the electoral votes, and this memoran­  
dum was probably written at that time by  
Jefferson, who was a candidate for the  
Presidency, and sent to Mr. Nicholas for  
his use in the debates on the subject. Miss  
Raudolph had the document photographed,  
and sent one of the photographs to The  
World of New York, which printed an en­  
graving of it. The following are the words  
of the memorandum:  
Whereas, on an election of President or  
Vice-President of the United States ques­  
tions may arise whether an elector has been  
appointed in such manner as the legislature  
of his State may have directed ? Whether  
the time at which he was chosen, and the  
day on which he gave his vote those deter­  
mined by Congress ? Whether he were not  
at the time a Senator or Representative of  
the United States, or held an office of trust  
or pi&#x27;ofit under the United States? Whether  
one at least of the persons he has voted for  
is an inhabitant of a State other than his  
own ? Whether the electors voted by ballot  
and have signed, certified and transmitted  
to the President of the Senate a list of all  
the persons voted for and of the number of  
voters for each ? Whether the persons voted  
for are natural born citizens or were citizens  
  
of the U mted States at tne time ot tne adop­  
tion of the Constitution, were thirty-five  
years old and had been fourteen years resi­  
dent within the United States. And the  
Constitution of the United States having  
directed that “the President of the Senate  
shall in the presence of the Senate and  
House of Representatives open all the cer­  
tificates, and that the votes shall then be  
counted,” from which is most reasonably  
inferred that they are to be counted by the  
members composing the said houses and  
brought there for that office, no other being  
assigned them, and inferred the more rea­  
sonably as thereby the constitutional weight  
of each State in the election of those high  
officers is exactly preserved in the tribunal  
which is to judge of its validity, the num­  
ber of Senators and Representatives from  
each State composing the said tribunal be­  
ing exactly that of the electors of the same  
State;  
Be it therefore enacted, etc., [here insert

certificate of the Executive of any Sta£»  
shall be conclusive evidence that the re­  
quisite number of votes has been given for

erson in looking  
over some old papers written by that illus-  
trious man, has found a document which  
bears directly upon the question of count-  
ing the electoral vote. The document in  
question is the outline of a bill for the set-  
tlement of disputes growing out of Presi-  
dential elections, and was prepared by Jef-  
ferson in 1800, at the time his election was  
so closely contested. The bill failed, but  
the memoradum is an interesting historical  
document, since it embodies the views of  
Mr. Jefferson upon a subject which has  
deeply agitated the country.  
  
The essential point of Jefferson’s draft is  
that ‘‘the certificate of the Executive of any  
State shall be conclusive evidence that the  
requisite number of votes has been given  
for each elector named by him as such.”  
  
The memorandum further provides that  
when the vote of any elector was judged  
invalid, that the Senators and Representa-  
tives of the State -in whose electoral vote  
the invalidity was found should determine  
how it should be cast. It also embraced

r of Thomas Jefferson, for a  
memorandum, prepared by her illus­  
trious ancestor, of practical suggestions  
toward a bill to regulate the decision of  
disputes over the result of a presidential  
election. Miss Randolph is a grand­  
daughter, also, of Wilson Cary Nicholas,  
who was a Senator from Virginia in  
1800, and this document, which is ap­  
pended, was found among the latter&#x27;s  
papers about two months ago, too late  
for use in the heated congressional de­  
bates on the late presidential election.  
The following is the memorandum,  
which is published by the world in fac­  
simile.  
JEFFERSONS MEMORANDUM.  
Whereas, on an election of President  
or Vice President of the United States,  
questions may arise whether an elector  
has been appointed in such manner as  
the Legislature of his State may have  
directed?  
Whether the time at which he was  
chosen and the day on which he gave  
his vote, were those determined by Con­  
gress?  
Whether he were not at the time a  
Senator or Representative of the United  
States, or held an office of trust or profit  
under the United States?  
Whether one at least of the persons  
he has voted for is an inhabitant of a  
State other than his own?  
Whether the electors voted by ballot  
and have signed, certified and trans­  
mitted to the President of the Senate a  
list of all the persons voted for and the  
number of votes for each?  
Whether the persons voted for are  
natural-born citizens or were citizens of  
the United States at the time of the  
adoption of the Constitution, were  
thirty-five years old and had been four­  
teen years resident within the United  
States?  
And the Constitution of the United  
States having directed that the presi­  
dent of the Senate shall, in the pres­  
ence of the Senate and House of Repre­  
sentatives, open all the certificates, and  
that the votes shall then be counted  
from which is most reasonably inferred  
that they are to be counted by the mem­  
bers composing the said houses and  
brought there for that office, no other  
being assigned them, and inferred the  
more reasonably, as thereby the consti­  
tutional weight of each State in the  
election of these high officers is exactly  
preserved in the tribunal which is to  
judge of its validity, the number of Sen­  
ators and Representatives from each  
State composing the said tribunal being  
exactly that of the electors of the same  
State.  
Be it therefore enacted, etc. HHere in­  
sert the former clause.  
Provides that the certificates of the  
executive of any State shall be conclu­  
sive evidence that the requisite number  
of votes has been given for each elector  
named by him as such. Here add all  
other limitations on the preceding ques­  
tions which may be thought proper,  
stating what the two Houses shall not  
decide.  
And be it further enacted, That when­  
soever the vote of one or more of the  
electors of any State shall, for any cause  
whatever, be adjudged invalid, it shall  
be lawful for the Senators and Repre­  
sentatives of the said State, either in the  
resence of the two Houses, or separate­

by their own votes to which of the per­

“ Whereas, on an election of President or V. President of the U.S. questions  
may arise whether an elector has been appointed in such manner as the legislature  
of his State may have directed ? whether the time at which he was chosen, and the  
day on which he gave his vote were those determined by Congress? whether he  
were not at the time, a Senator or Representative of the U. S., or held an office of  
trust or profit under the U. S.? whether one at least of the persons he has voted  
for is an inhabitant of a State other than his own? whether the electors voted by  
ballot, and have. signed, certified and transmitted to the President of the Senate a  
list of all the parties voted for, and of the number of votes for each ?  
  
“Whether the persons voted for are natural born citizens, or were citizens of the  
U.S. at the time of the adoption of the constitution, were 35 years old and had  
been 14 years resident of the U. S. ?  
  
“ And the Constitution of the U.S. having directed that ‘the President of the  
Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and H. of Representatives, open all  
the certificates, and that the votes shall then be counted,’ from which is most reason-  
ably inferred that they are to be counted by the members composing the said  
Houses and brought there for that office, no other being assigned them, and inferred  
the more reasonably, as thereby the constitutional right of each*State in the elec-  
tion of these high officers is exactly preserved in the tribunal which is to judge of  
its validity, the number of Senators and Representatives from each State composing  
the said tribunal being exactly that of the electors of the same State; be it there-  
fore enacted, etc.”  
  
“ Here,” the draft says, “insert the former clause.” What that  
clause was we do not know, as it is not known to what bill this  
suggested amendment was intended to apply.  
  
In this draft Mr. Jefferson added an additional section, declaring,  
  
  
  
  
  
112 THE COUNT OF THE ELECTORAL VOTE  
  
“ That whenever the vote of one or more of the electors of any State shall for  
any cause whatever be adjudged invalid, it shall be lawful for the Senators and  
Representatives of the said State either in the presence of the two Houses or sepa-  
rately and withdrawn from them, to decide by their own votes to which of the per-  
sons voted for by any of the electors of their State [or to what person], the invalid  
vote or votes shall be given, for which purpose they shall be allowed a term of [one  
hour] and no longer, during which no other certificate shall be opened or pro-  
ceeded on.
