l communications in your letter, and congratulate you on the event which restores you to the Public Councils;  
where your services will be valuable on several accounts, particularly in defending the Constitution &amp; Union agst.  
the false doctrines which assail them. That of Nullification seems to be generally abandoned in Virginia by those who had  
most leaning towards it. But it still flourishes in the hotbed where it sprang up; and will probably not die away whilst  
mistaken causes of exaggerated sufferings continue to nourish it; whilst the tariff which produced it, is exclusively  
charged with the inevitable effects of a market equally glutted with the products of the land &amp; with the land  
itself.  
I know not whence the idea could proceed that I concurred in the doctrine, that altho’ a State could not  
nullify a law of the Union, it had a right to secede from the Union. Both spring from the same poisonous root; unless the  
right to secede be limited to cases of intolerable oppression absolving the party from its constitutional obligations.  
I hope that all who now see the absurdity of nullification, will see also the necessity of rejecting the  
claim to effect it, thro’ the Stat
