Friends &amp; Fellow Citizens,  
  
Called upon to undertake the duties of the first Executive office of our country, I avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased to look towards me, to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents, and that I approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge, and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire. A rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye; when I contemplate these transcendent objects, and see the honour, the happiness, and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink from the contemplation &amp; humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking. Utterly indeed should I despair, did not the presence of many, whom I here see, remind me, that, in the other high authorities provided by our constitution, I shall find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties. To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation, and to those associated with you, I look with encouragement for that guidance  and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked, amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world.  
During the contest of opinion through which we have past, the animation of discusions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely, and to speak and to write what they think; but this being now decided by the voice of the nation, announced according to the rules of the constitution all will of course arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in common efforts for the common good.All too will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and to violate would be oppression. Let us then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind, let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty, and even life itself, are but dreary things. And let us reflect that having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance, as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions. During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world, during the agonising spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and slaughter his long lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others; and should divide opinions as to measures of safety; but every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all republicans: we are all federalists. If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union, or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is left free to combat it. I know indeed that some honest men fear that a republican government cannot be strong; that this government is not strong enough. But would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and visionary fear, that this government, the world’s best hope, may, by possibility, want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest government on earth. I believe it the only one, where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet  invasions of the public order as his own personal concern.—Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels, in the form of kings, to govern him? Let history answer this question.  
Let us then, with courage and confidence, pursue our own federal and republican principles; our attachment to union and representative government. Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe; too high minded to endure the degradations of the others, possessing a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation, entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties, to the acquisitions of our own industry, to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens, resulting not from birth, but from our actions and their sense of them, enlightened by a benign religion, professed indeed and practised in various forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude and the love of man, acknowledging and adoring an overruling providence, which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here, and his greater happiness hereafter; with all these blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing more, fellow citizens, a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities.  
About to enter, fellow citizens, on the exercise of duties which comprehend every thing dear and valuable to you, it is proper you should understand what I deem the essential principles of our government, and consequently those which ought to shape its administration. I will compress them within the narrowest compass they will bear, stating the general principle, but not all its limitations.—Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political:—peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none:—the support of the state governments in all their rights, as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns, and the surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies:—the preservation of the General government in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home, and safety abroad: a jealous care of the right of election by the people, a  mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided:—absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority, the vital principle of republics, from which is no appeal but to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of the despotism:—a well disciplined militia, our best reliance in peace, and for the first moments of war, till regulars may relieve them:—the supremacy of the civil over the military authority:—economy in the public expence, that labor may be lightly burthened:—the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith:—encouragement of agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid:—the diffusion of information, and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason:—freedom of religion; freedom of the press; and freedom of person, under the protection of the Habeas Corpus:—and trial by juries impartially selected. These principles form the bright constellation, which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages, and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment:—they should be the creed of our political faith; the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps, and to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty and safety.  
I repair then, fellow citizens, to the post you have assigned me. With experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this the greatest of all, I have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation, and the favor, which bring him into it. Without pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary character, whose pre-eminent services had entitled him to the first place in his country’s love, and destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history, I ask so much confidence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs. I shall often go wrong through defect of judgment. When right, I shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the whole ground. I ask your indulgence for my own errors, which will never be intentional; and your support against the errors of others, who may condemn what they would not if seen in all its parts. The approbation implied by your suffrage, is a great consolation to me for the past; and my future solicitude will be, to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance, to conciliate that of others by doing them all  the good in my power, and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all.  
Relying then on the patronage of your good will, I advance with obedience to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choices it is in your power to make. And may that infinite power, which rules the destinies of the universe, lead our councils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity.

and bloody persecutions... During. the throes and convul-  
sions of the ancient world,. during the agonizing spasms of  
infariated man, seeking through blood and slaughter his long  
lost liberty, it was not wonderful that. the agitation of the  
billows should reach even this distant.and peaceable shore;  
that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by  
athers; and should divide opinions as to measures of safety ;  
but every difference of opinion is not a difference of prin.  
ciple. We have called by different names brethren of the  
same principle. We are all REPUBLICANS: We are  
all FEDERALISTS., It there be any who.would wish to  
dissolve this union or to change its republican form, let  
them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with  
which error of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is  
left freeto combat it. I know indeed that some honest  
men fear that a republican government cannot be strong  
enough, But would the honest patriot, in the full tide of  
successful experiment, abandon a government which has so  
far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and visionary  
fear, that this government, the world’s best hape, may, by  
possibility. want energy to preserve itself? Itrust not. I  
  
elieve this, on the contrary, the strongest government on  
earth. I believe it the only one, where every man at the  
call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and  
would meet invasions of the public order as his own per-  
sonal concern—Sometimes if is said that man cannot be  
trusted with the government of himself. Can he then be

under the protection of the Habeas  
Corpus ;—and trial by juries i ially selected. These  
  
rinciples form the bright constellation, which has gone be-  
  
are us, and guided our steps through an age of revolution and  
reformation, The -wisdom of our sages, and blood of our  
heroes, have been devoted to their attainment. They should  
be the creed of our political faith; the text of civic in-  
struction: the touch-stone by which te try the services of  
those we trust; and should we wander from them in moments  
of error or of alarm let us hasten to retrace our steps, and to  
regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty and safety.  
  
I repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the post you have as.  
signed me. With experience enough in subordinate offices  
to have scen the difficulties of this the greatest of all, I  
have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of ina-  
perfect man to retire from this station with the reputation,  
aad the favour, which bring him into it. Without preten-  
sions to that confidence which you reposed in our bu and  
  
reatest revolutionary character, whose pre-eminent services  
had entitled him to the first place im his country’s love, and  
  
destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful  
  
history. 1 ask so much confidence only, as may give firm.  
ness and effect jo the legal administration of your affairs.  
I shal] often go wrong through defect of judgment. When  
right, I shall often be thought wrong by those whose posi-  
tions will not command a view of the whole ground. I  
ask your indulgence for my own errors, which will never  
be intentional; and your support against the errars of otbers,  
whe may condemn what they would notif seen in all its  
parts. The approbation implied by your suffrage, is a great  
censolation to me for the past; and my future solicitude  
will be, to retain the good opinion of those who have be-  
stowed it in advance, to conejliate thatef others, by doing  
them all the good in my puwer, and to be instrumental to the  
happiness and freedom of all. .  
  
Relying then on the patronage of your good will, I ad-  
vance with obedience to the work, ready to retire from it  
whenever you become sensible how much better choices it  
is in your power to make. And may that infinite power,  
which rules the destinies of the universe, lead our councils  
to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your  
peace and prosperity

{&#x27;elf before the magnitude of the undertak­  
ing Utterly indeed Ihould 1 detpjur, did  
not he pre fence of many, whom 1 here  
lee, remind me,&#x27; that, in the other high  
auth irities provided by our coilflitution, 1  
fliall find refources of wifdom, of virtue,  
and of zeal, on which to rely* under all  
ti- acuities. I&#x27;oyoUj then, gentlemen, who  
art «harged with the lovereign tundhons of  
legislation, and to thofe ahociatcd with  
you, I look with encouragement for that  
gu dance and fuppoVt which may enable us  
to fleer with fafctv the vt fT l in wliich we  
arc all embarked, amidll the conflicting  
inents of a~ troubled world.  
During the conceit of opinion through  
A-hich we have pull, the animation of dif­  
cuilionsamlof exertions has tome times worn  
an afpeel which might impofe on Grangers  
unufed to think freely, and to fpea! and to  
write what they think ; but this being now  
decidedbythe voice ft.be nation, -nounced  
according to the rules of the conftitution,  
•all will of courfe arrange themfelves undei  
the will of the law, and unite in common  
efforts for the common good. All too  
will bear in mind din facred principle, that  
though the w 11 of the majority is in all  
Cafes to prevail, that will, to be rightful,  
-uiftbe reafonable ; that the minority pof  
their equal rights, which equal laws  
protect, and to violate would be op­  
it iiion. I-et us then, fellow citizens, u­  
&#x27;tte with one heart and one mind, let us  
reflore to focial intercom fe that harmony  
and affe&amp;ion without which&#x27; liberty, and  
even life itfelf, are but dreary things.  
And let us reflect that having banilhed from  
our land that religions intolerance under  
which mankind to long bled and luftered,  
we have yet gained little, it we counte­  
nance a political intolerance, as defpo­  
tic, as wicked, and capable ol as bitter  
and bloody perfecutions. During the throes  
and convictions of the ancient world, du­  
ring the agoniling fpafms of infuriated man,  
feeking through blood and flaughter his  
long loft liberty, it was not wonderful  
that the agitation of the billows Ihould  
reach even thisdiftant and peaceful fhore;  
that this fhould be more felt and feared  
by fome and let&#x27;s by others ; and fliould  
divide opinions as to mealures of fafe­  
ty ; but every difference of opinion is not  
nee of principle. We have called  
by different names brethren of the fame  
principle. We are all republicans: we  
are all federalifts. If there be any among  
Us who would wilh to dittolve this Union,  
i&gt;r &quot;,o change its republican form, let them  
ftantl nndifturbed as monuments of the fafe­  
ty -until which error of opinion may be to­  
fcr;i J,fcd, where rtafou is lett tree to combat  
  
- it. I know indeed that fome honeii men fear  
that a republican government cannot be  
llrong ; that this government is not ftrong 1  
enough. lint would the hone ft patriot,  
in the f.ill tide of faccefsful experiment,  
abandon a government which has fo far  
kept Lis free and firm, on the theoretic and  
yilionary fear, that this government, the  
world&#x27;s heft hope, may, by poffibility, want  
energy to prefers itfelf? 1 trull not. 1 i  
believe this, or the contrary, the ftrongeft i  
I&#x27;overnmeut en earth. I believe it the 1  
only one, where every man, at the call of i  
the law, would ity to the ftanda&#x27;rd of the  
law, and would meet invafio a of the pub-1  
lie order as his own perfonal concern.—  
Sometimes it is faid that man cannot be i  
trulled with the government of himfelf.  
&#x27; (van he then be trulled with the govern-:i  
ment of others ? Or have we found angels,!  
in the form of kings, to govern him ? Letji  
&quot; hiflory anfwer this queftion. |i

fhal! find refsurces of wildom, of virtue, and of  
  
meal, on which to rely under all difficulties. To  
you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the  
fovereign functions of legiflation, and to thofe af-  
focisted with you, | look with encouragement for  
that guidance and fupport which may enable us  
to fleer with fafety the vel! in which we are all  
embarked, amidit the conflicting elements of a  
troubled world.  
  
Daring the conteft of opinion through which  
we have paft, the animation of difcuffions and of  
exertions has fometimes worn an afpeét which  
might impofe on ftrangers unufed to think freely,  
and to foeak and write what they think ; but this  
being now decided” by the voice of the nation,  
announced according to the rules of the conflitu-  
tion, all will of courfe arrange themfelves under  
the will of the law, and unite in common efforts  
for the common good. All too will bear in mind  
this facred principle, that though the will of the  
majority is in all cafes to prevail, that will, to be  
rightful, muft be reafonable; that the minority  
poflefs their equal rights, which equal laws mutt  
prote&amp;t, and to violate would be oppreffion. Let  
us, then, fellow citizens, unice with one heart and  
  
one mind, lec us reftore to focial intercourfe that |  
  
harmony and affection, without which, liberty  
and even life itfelf, are but dreary things. And  
  
Tet us reflect, that having banifhed from our land |  
  
that religious intolerance, under which. mankind  
fo long bled and fuffered, we have yet gained  
little, if we countenance a political intolerance,  
as defpotic, as wicked, and capable of as wicked  
and bloody perfecutions. During the throes and  
convuliions of the ancient world, during the ago-  
nizing {pafins of infuriated man, feeking through  
  
  
  
not wonderful that the agitation of ahe billows  
fhould reach even this diftant and peaceful fhore ;  
that this fhould be more felt and feared by fome,  
and lefs by others; and fhould divide opinions as  
to meafures of fafety; but every difference of  
opinion is not a difference of principle. We have  
calied by different names brethren of the fame  
principle. WE ARE ALL REPUBLICANS;  
WE ARE ALL FEDERALISTS. If there be  
any among us who would with to diffolve  
this union, or to change ,its republican form,  
iet them ftand undifturbed as monuments of  
the fafety with which error of opinion may be  
tolerated, where reafon is left free to com-  
bat it. Iknow, indeed, that fome honeft men  
fear that a republican government cannot be  
flrong; that this government is not frong  
enough. But would the honeit patriot, in the full  
tide of fuccelsful experiment, abandon a govera-  
ment which has fo far Rept us free and firm, on  
the theoretic and vifion*ry fear, that this govern-  
ment, thégworld’s be! hope, may, by pollibility,  
want energy Wopreferve iciclf? Itruttmot. | be-  
lieve this, on the cc: xrary, the ftrongeft govern  
  
ment on ¢arth. I believe it the only one, where  
every man, at the cj} of the law, would fly to  
the fandard of the law, and would meet invafions  
of the public order as his own perfonal concern.  
Sometimes it is faid that man cannot be trufed  
with the government of himfelf. Can he then be  
truftled with the goverament of others? Or have  
we found angels in the form of kings, to govern  
him? Lec hiftory anfwer tis quettion,  
  
Let us,then, with courage ond confidence purfue  
our own federal and republican principles ; our at-  
tachment to union and reprefentative government.  
Kindly fer :rated by nature and a wide ocean from  
the exterminating havoe of one qu.rter of the

of the others, poflefing achofen country, with room  
enough tor our defcendants to the thoulandth and

what more is neceflsry to make us a happy and a

fhall reftrain men from injuring one another, fhall!  
leave them otherwile free to regulate their own

Friends and Fellow-Citizens,  
  
ALLED upon to undertake the duties  
  
of the first Executive office of our  
country, I avail myself of the presence of  
that portion of my fellow citizens which  
isthere assembled, to express my grateful  
thanks for the faveur with which they have  
been pleased to look towards me; to de-  
clare a sencere consciousness that the task  
is above my talents, and that I approach it  
with those anxious and awful presentiments  
which the greatness of the charge, and the  
weakness of my powers so justly inspire.  
Arising nation, spread over a wide and  
fruitfa! Jand, -traversing all the seas with  
the miclaproducticns of their industry, en-  
gaged oe with nations who feel  
power am@topget right, advancing rapidly  
to destinies beyend the reach of mortal eye;  
when J contestpate fhese transcendent ob-  
jects, and see the honor, the happiness, and  
the hopes of our beloved country committed  
to the issue and the auspices of this day, I  
shrink from the contemplation, and humble  
myself before the magnitude of the under-  
taking. Utterly indeed should I despair,  
did not the presence of many, whom I here  
see, remind me, that in the other high athor-  
ities provided by our constitution, I shall  
find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of  
zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties.  
To you, then, gentlemen who are charged  
with the sovereign functions of legislation,  
and to those associated with you, | look  
  
¥  
  
  
  
with encouragement for that guidance and  
support,which may enable us to steer with  
safety the vessel in which we are ali embark-  
ed, amidst the conflicting elements of a  
troubled world.  
  
During the contest of opjnion through  
which we have past, the animation of dis-  
cussions and of exertions has sometimes  
worn an aspect which might impose on  
strangers, unused to think freely, and to  
speak and to write what they think; but  
this being now decidedly the voice of the  
nation, announced according to the rules  
of the constitution, all will of course ar-  
range themselves under the will of the law,  
and unite in common efforts for the com-  
mon good. All too will bear in mind this  
sacred principle, that though the will of  
majority is in all cases to prevail, that will,  
to be rightful, must be reasonable ; that the  
minority possess their equal rights, which e-  
qual laws must protect, and to violate would  
be oppression. Let us then, fellow citi-  
zens, unite with one heart and one mind,  
let us restore to social intercourse that har-  
mony and affection without which liberty,  
and even life itself, are but dreary things.  
And let us reflect, that having banished  
from our land that religious intolerance un-  
  
| der which mankind so long bled and suffer-  
  
ed, we have yet gained little, if we coun-  
tenance a political intolerance, as despotic,  
as wicked, and&#x27;capable of as bitter and  
bloody persecutions. During the throes  
and convulsions of the ancient world, dur-  
ing the agonizing spasms of infuriated man,  
seeking through blood and slaughter his  
long lost liberty, it was not wonderful that  
the agitation of the billows should reach  
even this distant and peaceful shore: that  
this should be more felt and feared by  
some, and less by others ; and should divide  
opinions as to measures of safety; but ev-  
ery difference of opinion is not a difference  
of principle. We hage called by different  
names brethen of the same principle. We  
are all rebublicans: we are all federalists.  
If there be any among us who would wish  
to dissolve this union, or to change its re-  
bublican form, let them stand undisturbed  
as monuments of the safety with which er-  
ror of opinion may be tolerated, where rea-  
son is left free to combat it. I know indeed  
that some honest men fear that arepublican  
government cannot be strong; that this  
government is not strong enough. But  
would the honest patriot, in the full tide  
of successful experiment, abandon a gov-  
ernment which has so far kept us free and  
firm, on the theoretic and visionary fear,  
that this government, the world’s — best  
hope, may, by possibility, want energy to

preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this  
on the contrary, the strongest governmen:  
on earth. 1 believe it is the only one,  
where every man, at the call of the law,  
would fly to the standard of the law, and  
would meet invasions of the public order as  
his own personal concern. Sometimes it js  
said that man cannot be trusted with the  
government of himself. Can he then be  
trusted with the government of others? Or  
have we found angels in the form of kings,  
to govern him? Let history answer this  
question.  
  
Let us then, with courage and confidence  
pursue our own federal and republican and  
principles ; our attachment to union and re.  
presentative government. Kindly separa.  
ted by nature and a wide ocean, from tho  
exterminating havoc of one quarter of the  
globe; too high minded to endure the de.  
gradations of the others ; possessing a cho-  
sen country, with room enough for ourde.  
scendants to the thousandth and thousandth  
generation, entertaining a due sense of our  
equal right to the use of our own faculties,  
to the acquisitions of our own industry, to  
honour and confidence from our fellow-  
citizens, resulting not from birth, but ffom  
our actions and their sense of them, en-  
lightened by a benign religion, professed  
indeed and practised in various forms, yet  
all of them inculcating honesty, truth, tem-  
perance, gratitude and the love of man, ac-  
knowledging and adoring an over-ruling  
Providence, which by all its dispensations  
proves that it delights in the happiness of  
man here, and his greater haginess here-  
after; with all these blessings, what more  
is necessary to make usa happy and pros  
  
perous people? Still one thing more, fel- 2  
  
low-citizens—a wise and frugal govern-  
ment, which shall restrain men from injur-  
ing one another, shall leave them otherwise  
free to regulate their own pursuits of indus-  
try and improvement, and shall not take  
from the mouth éPiabour the bread it has  
earned.&quot; «his is the sum of good govemn-  
fhent; and this is necessary to close the  
circle of our felicities.  
  
About to enter, fellow citizens, on the  
exercise ofuties which comprehend eve  
ry thing deaftgnd valuable to you, it is pro-  
per you shou erstand what I deem  
the essential principles of our government,  
and consequently those which ought ‘to  
shape its administration. I will compress  
them within the narrowest compass they  
wilf bear, stating the general principle,  
but not all its limitations. Equal and ex-  
  
  
  
  
  
-act justice to all men, of whatever state of  
  
persuasion, religious or political: peace,  
commerce, and honest friendship with al  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
nations, entangling alliances with none:—  
  
the support of the state governments in all  
their rights, ax the most competent admini-  
trations for our domestic concerns, and the  
&lt;urest bulwarks against anti-republican ten-  
dencies; the preservation of the general go-  
yvernment, in its whole constitutional vigor,  
as the sheet-anchor of our peace at home,  
and safety abroad: a jealous care of the  
right of election by the people, a mild and  
cafe corrective of abuses which are lopped  
by the sword of revolution, where peacea-  
bie remedies are unprovided: absolute ac-  
quiescence in the decisions of the majority,  
the vital principle of republics, from which  
is no appeal bat to force, the vital princi-  
  
le and immediate parent of despotism: a  
well disciplined militia, our best reliance  
in peace, and for the first moments of war,  
till regulars may relieve them: the supre-  
macy of the civil over the military authori-  
ty: economy in the public expence, that  
  
| Jabor may be lightly burthened : the honest  
  
payment of our debts, and sacred preserva-  
tion of the public faith : encouragement of  
agriculture, and of commerce as its hand-  
maid: the diffusion of information, and  
arraignment of all abuses at the bar of  
the public reason: freedom of religion ;  
freedom of the press ; and freedom of per-  
son, under the protection of the Habeas  
Corpus : and trial by juries impartially se-  
lected. These principles form the bright  
constellation, which has gone before us,  
and guided our steps through an age of re-  
volution and reformation. The wisdom of  
our sages, and blood of our heroes, bave  
been dev  
should be the creed of our political faith ;  
the text of civic instruction, the touch-  
stone by which to try the services of those  
we trust; and should we wander from  
them in moments of error or alarm, let  
us hasten to retrace our steps, and to re-  
gain the road which alone leads to peace,  
liberty and safety.  
  
I repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the  
post you have assigned me. With expe-  
rience enough in subordinate offices, to have  
seen the difficulties of this the greatest of  
all: I have learnt to expect, that it will  
rarely fall to the lot of imperfegt man to re-  
tire from this station with the reputation  
and the favour which ding him into it.  
Without pretensions to that high confidence  
you reposed in our first and greatest revolu-  
tionary character, whose pre-eminent ser-  
vices had entitled him to the first place in  
his country’s love, and destined for him the  
fairest page in the volume of faithful histo-  
ty, Task so much confidence only as may  
give firmness and effect to the legal admi-  
  
d to their attainment: they |  
  
  
  
nistration of your affairs. I shall often go  
wrong through defect of judgment. When  
right, I shall often be thought wrong by  
those whose positions will not command a  
view of the whole ground. I ask your in-  
dulgence for my own errors, which will  
never be intentional ; and your support a-  
gainst the errors of others, who may con-  
demn what they would not if seen in all  
its parts. The approbation implied by  
your suffrage, is a great consolation to me  
for the past ; and my future solicitude will  
be, to retain the good opinion of those who  
have bestowed it in advance; to concili-  
ate that of others, by doing them all the  
good in my power; and to be instrument-  
al to the happiness and freedom of all.  
  
Relying then on the patronage of your  
good-will, Iadvance with obedience fo the  
work, ready to retire from it whenever  
you become sensible how much better choi-  
ces it is in your power to make.—And may  
that Infinite Power, which rules the desti-  
nies of the universe, lead our councils to  
what is best, and give them a favourable  
issue for your peace and prosperity

Iriends and Fellow Citizens,  
CALLED upon to undertake the  
duties of the firlt Executive office of  
our country, I avail myfelf of the pre­  
sence of that portion of my fellow-citi­  
zens which is here assembled to express  
my grateful thanks for the favor with  
which they have been pleased to look  
towards me, 0 declare a sincere con­  
sciousness that the task is above my  
talents, and that I approach it with  
those anxious and awful presentiments  
which the greatness of the charge, and  
the weaknels of my powers so jultly  
inspire. A rising nation, {pread over  
a wide and fruitful land, traversing all  
the seas: with the rich produ&amp;ions of  
their indultry, engaged in commerce  
with nations who feel power and for­  
get right, advancing rapidly to desti­  
nies beyond the reach of mortal eye ;  
when I contemplate these transcendent  
objedts, and fee the honor, the happi­  
ness, and the hopes of this beloved  
country committed to the issue and  
the aulpices of this day, I thrink¥from  
the contemplation and humble mylfelf  
before the magnitude of the underta­  
king. Utterly .indeed should I dei­  
pair, did not the presence of many,  
whom I here fee, remind me, that, in  
the other high authorities provided by  
our constitution, I shall find resources  
of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal, on  
which to rely under all difficulties. To  
you, then, gentlemen, who are charg­  
ed with the sovereign fun&amp;ions of le­  
gislation, and to those associated with  
you, I look with encouragement for  
that guidance and support which may  
enable us to steer with fafety the vessel  
in which we are all embarked, amidst  
the confliting elements of a troubled  
world. « - -  
Durivg the contest of opinion thro’  
which we have past, the animation of  
difcuflions and of exertions has some­  
times won an afpe&amp;® which -might .im­  
pose on strangers unused to think free­  
ly and to speak and to write what they  
think’; but this being now decided by  
thevoiceofthenation,announcedaccor­  
ding to the rules of the constitution, all  
will of course arrange themfelvesunder  
the will of the law, and unite in com­  
mon efforts for the common good. All  
too will bear in my mind this sacred  
  
principle, that though the will of&#x27;the  
majority is inall cases to prevail, that  
will, to berightful, must bereafonable;  
that the minority possess their equal  
right whichegual lawsmuft prote&amp;, and  
to violate would be oppreflion. Let  
us, then, fellow-citizens, unite with  
one heart and one mind, let us  
restore to social intercourse that har­  
mony and affe®ion without which lib­  
erty, and even life itfelf, are but dreary  
things. Andlet us refle&amp; that having  
banished from our land that religious  
intolerance under which mankind so  
long bled and fuffered ; we have yet  
gained little, if we countenance a po­  
litical intolerance, as despotic, as wick­  
ed, and capable of as bitter and bloody’  
persecutions. During the throes and  
convulsions of the ancient world, dur­  
ing the agonizing spasms of infuria­  
ted man, fecking through blood and  
slaughter his long loft liberty, it was  
not wonderful that the agitation of the  
billows should reach even this distant  
and peaceful shore ; that this should  
be more felt and feared by some amrd  
less by others ; and should divide  
v opinions as to measures of fafety ; but  
every difference of opinion is not a  
difference of principle. &#x27;We have call­  
ed by different names brethren of  
the fame principle. = We are all  
republicans ; we all federalifts. If  
theré be dny among us who would  
with to dissolve this Union, or to  
change its republican = form,—let  
them stand undisturbed as monuments  
of the fafety with which error of opin­  
ion may be-tolerated, where reason is  
left free to combat it. I know indeed  
that some honest men fear that a re­  
publican government cannot be strong  
—that this government is not strong  
enough. But would the honest pa­  
triot,in the full tide of fuccefsful exper­  
iment, abandon a government which  
has so far kept us free and firm, on  
the theoretic and vilionary fear, that  
‘this government, the world’s belt hope,  
may, by poflibility, want energy to  
preserve itfelf 2 I trust not. I believe  
this, on” the contrary, the ftrongelt  
overnmnet on earth. -1 believe it  
g., only one, where every man, at the  
call of the law, would fly to the stan­  
dard of the law,and would mect in­  
vasions of the public order as his own  
w &#x27;;ggngian.e-Sum:titzEsd it tg  
«id that man cannot be trusted wit  
e tg:;rm&#x27;: B DUGNAAE LR fee  
then be trusted with the goverament  
of others 2Or have we found angels  
i T R Y L HasTy WL  
  
in the form of kings, to govern him ?  
Let history answer this question.  
LEer us then, with courage and  
confidence, pursue our own federal  
and republican principles ; our at­  
tachment to union and representative  
government. Kindly separated by  
nature and a wide ocean from the ex­  
terminating havoc of one quarter of  
the globe ; too high minded to en­  
dure the degradations of the others,  
poflefling a chosen country, with room  
enough for our descendants to the  
hundredth and thousandth generation,  
entertaining a due sense of our equal  
right to the use of our own faculties,  
to the acquisitions of our own induf&quot;  
try, to honor and confidence from our  
fellow citizens, resulting not from  
birth, but from our a&amp;ions and their  
sense of them, inculcating honelty,  
truth, temperance, gatitude and the  
love of man, acknowledging and a­  
doring an overruling providence ;  
which by all its dispensations proves  
that it delights in the happiness of man  
here, and his greater happiness hereaf­  
ter ; with all these bleflings what  
more is neceflary to make us a happy  
and a prosperous people ? Still one  
thing more, fellow citizens, a wife and  
prudent Government, which thall re­  
strain men from injuring one another,  
{hall leave them otherwise free to re­  
gulate their own pursuits of industry  
and improvement, and shall not take  
from the mouth of labor the bread it  
has earned. This is the sum of good  
Government ; and this is neceflary to  
close the circle of sur felicities.  
  
ABouT to enter, fellow citizens, on  
the exercise of duties which compre­  
hend every thing ‘dear and valuable  
to you, it is proper you should under­  
stand what I deem the essential princi­  
pPles of our government, and conse­  
quently those which ought to shape its  
administration.—l will compress them  
within the narrowest compass they will  
bear, stating the general principle, but  
not all its limitations.—Equal and ex­  
alt justice to all men, of whatever  
state or persuasion, religious or poli­  
tical :—peace, commerce, and honelt  
friendthip with all nations, entangling  
alliances with none :—the support of  
the state governments in all their  
rights, as the most competent adminis­  
trations for our domeltic concerns, and  
the surest bulwarks, against anti-repub­  
lican tendencies :—the preservation of  
the general government in its whole  
~contftitutional vigor, as the sheet an­  
chor of our peace at home, and fafety  
abroad,:—a jealous care of the right  
of elect on by the people, a mild and  
fafe corretive of abuses which are lop­  
ped by the {word&#x27; of revolution where -  
peaceable remedies are unprovided :  
—absolute aequiefcence in the decif  
ions of the majority, the vital principal  
of republics, from which is no appeal  
but to force, the vital principle and im­  
mediate parent of despotism :—a well  
disciplined militia, our best reliance in  
peace, and for the firt moments of  
war, until regulars may relieve them :  
—the supremacy of the civil over the  
military authority :—economy in the’  
public expence, that labor may be  
lightly burthened :—~the honest pay­  
ment of our debts and sacred preserva­  
tion of the public faith :—encourage­  
mient of agriculture, and of commerce |  
as its handmaid :—the diffufion of in­  
formation, and arraignment of all abu­  
ses at the bar of the public reason :—  
freedom of religion ; freedom of the  
press; and freedom of person, under  
the proteétion of the Habeas Corpus:-  
—and trial by juries impartially fe­  
leted. These principles from the  
bright constellation, which has gone  
before us, and guidedour steps through  
an age of revolution and reformation.  
The wisdom of our sages, and blood  
of -our heroes, have been devoted to  
their attainment :—they thould be the  
¢reed of our political faith :—the text  
of civic ‘inftruion, the touchstone by |  
which to try the services of those we  
trust ; and should we wander from  
them in ‘moments of error or of alarm,  
~ let ushaften to retrace our fteps,and to -  
- regain the road which alone leads to  
peace, liberty and fafety. &#x27;  
I reram then, fellow-citizens, to  
the polt you have afligned me. With.  
experience enongh in subordinate of­  
fices to have seen the difficulties of this  
the greatest of all, I ‘have learnt to.  
- expect that it will rarely fall to the lot  
‘of imperfe® man to retire from this  
station with the reputation and the  
favof, which bring him ipto dt.—  
Without pretensions to &#x27;tha&amp;igh con­  
fidence you reposed in our firft and  
greatefl revolutionary charader,whofe  
- pre-eminent services had&quot;entitled him -  
to the firft place in his country’s love,  
[&quot;and destined for him the faireft page  
&#x27; in the volume of faithful history, I ask  
so much confidence only as will give  
firmnefs and effe® to the lepal admi­  
nistration of your affairs. % shall of­  
- ten go wrong through defe&amp; of judg­  
ment. When right, I shall often be  
thought wrong by thpfcmhof;}mﬁ- \‘  
tions will not command a view of the  
- whole ground. I ask your indulgence .  
for my own errors, which will neverbe -  
intentional ; and your support against  
the errors of cthers; who may con­  
demn what they would not if seen in_  
all its parts. * The approbation im--  
rAe e gy : gißs 5 ;-.;;3 e,«&quot;&quot;v T  
  
plied by your {uffrage, is a great con­  
solation to me for the past; and my  
future solicitude will be, to retain the  
good opinion of those who have bes­  
towed it in advance, to conciliate that  
of others by doing them all the good  
In my power, and to be instrumental  
to the happiness and freedom of all.  
RELYING then on the patronage of  
your good will, I advance with o­  
bedience to the work, ready to retire  
from it whenever you become sensible  
how mruch better choices it isin your  
power to make. And may that infi­  
nite Power, which rules the destinies  
of the univerfe,lead our councils to  
what is best, and give them a favora­  
ble issue for your peace and prosperity

Friends and Fcllow-Cit zens,  
CALLED upon to undeitake the duties of  
the fir ft Executive offi e of our country, I avail  
myfelf of tlic prefence of that portion of my  
fellow-citizens which is here affembled to exp efs  
my grateful thanks for the favor with whkh  
they have been pleafed to look towards me, to  
declare a f&#x27;meere confeioufnefs that the talk is  
a’ove mv talents, and that 1 approach it with  
thofe anxious and awful prefentimems which  
the grea&#x27;nefs of the charge, and the weakness of  
my powers fo juftly infpire. A fifing nation,  
fpread over a wide and fruitful land, traveifing  
all the feas with the rich productions of their  
induftry, engaged in commerce with nations  
who (eel power and forget right, advancing  
raoidly to deltinies beyond (he reach of mortal  
eye ; when I contemplate thefe tranfeendent  
obje&lt;fts, and fee the honor, the happinefs, and  
the hopes of this beloved country committed to  
the iffue and the aufpices of this day, I fh’ink  
from the contemplation and humble myfeit be­  
fore the magnitude of the undertaking. U tter­  
ly indeed (hould 1 defpair, did not the prefence  
of many, whom I here fee, remind me, that, in  
the other high ouihoritics provided by our con  
llitution, l lhall find ref’urces of wifdom, of  
virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely under all  
difficulties. To yon, then, gentlemen, who are  
charged with the fovereign functions of lega­  
tion, and to thole affiliated with you, I look  
with encouragement for that guidance and fnp  
port which may enable us to fleer with fatety  
the veffiel in which we are all embarked, amidlt  
the ccnfliding elements of a troubled woil 1.  
During the contell of opinion through which  
we have pail, the animation of difcuflnn and  
of exertions has fometimes worn an nfpect w hich  
might impole on Grangers, unufed to think  
freely, and to fpeak and to wr«te what they  
think ; but this being now decided hy the  
voice of the nation, announced according to the  
rules of the conflitulion, all will of courfe ar­  
range themfrlves under the will of the law,and  
unite in common effints for the common g^od.  
AM too w ill bear in mind this frered pi maple,  
that though the will of ihe maj nity is in ab  
cafes to prev .il, th.at will, to be rightful, mud  
  
be reafbnable; that the minority poiTefs their  
equal rights, which equal laws emirt piote&lt;ft»and  
to violate would be cppteflion. I.ct u&gt;. then,  
fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one  
mind, let us reftorc to facial intercomfi that  
hatmony and affeffion without which liberty,  
and even life itfelf. are but dreary tilings. And  
let us reflesfl that having banifhed fiom our land  
that religious intolerance under which man.  
kind fo long Lied and fullered : we have yet  
gained little, if we countenance a political in­  
tolerance, as defpotic, as wicked and capable  
of as bitter and blcody petfecutions. During  
the throes and convulfions of the ancient world,  
during the agonizing fpafms of infuriated men,  
fecking through blood and (laughter his long  
loft liberty, it was hot wonderful that tLie agita­  
tion of the billows (hould reach even this diltant  
and peaceful (Lore ; that this fhould be more  
felt and feared by fome and lefs by otheis ; and  
fhould divide opinions as to meafures of fafety ;  
but every difference of opinion is not a differ­  
ence of principle. We have called by different  
names brechienof the fame principle. We are  
all republicans; we ate all federalifts. It there  
be any among us vcho would wilh to diflblve  
this Union, or to change its republican form,  
let them Itand undilturbcd as monuments of the  
fafety with which error of opinion may be tol.  
crated, where reafon is left free to combat it.  
I know indeed that fome honeft men fear that  
  
a republican government cannot be ftrong ;  
that this government is not ftrong enough. But  
would the honeft patriot, in the full tide of fiic­  
cefsful experiment,abandon a government which  
has fo far kept us free and firm, on the theoret­  
ic and vifionary fear, that the government, the  
world’s beft hope, may, by po&#x27;Tibility want en­  
ergy to preferve itfelf ? I truft not. I believe  
this on the contrary,is the ftrongeft government  
on earth. I believe it the only one, where ev­  
ery man, at the call of the law, would fly to the  
&gt;ftandard of the law, anti would meet invafions  
of the public order as his own perfonal concern.  
—Sometimes it is faid that man cannot be  
trufted with the government of himfelf. Can  
he then be trufted with ihe government of oth­  
ers ? Or have we found angols in the form of  
kings, «o govern him ? Let hiftory anfwer this  
queftion.  
Let us then, with courage and confidence,  
purfue cur own federal and republican princi­  
pies ; our attachment to union and reprefenta -  
tive government. Kindly fepaTated by nature  
and a wide ocean fiom the exterminating hav­  
oc of one quarter of the globe ; too high mind­  
ed to endure the degradations of the others,  
pofteHing a chofen country, with room enough  
for our defendants to the hundredth and thou  
fandth generation, entertaining a due fenie of  
our equal right to the ufe of our own faculties,  
to the acqu&#x27;fitions of our own induftry, to hon­  
or and confidence from our fellow citizens, re­  
fulting not from birth, but from our aftions  
and their fenfe of’them, enlightened by a be­  
nign rei gion, profefted indeed and pratftifed in  
various forms, yet all them inculcating hon­  
efty,truth, temperance, gratitude and the love of  
man, acknowledging and adoring an overrulmg  
providence, which by all its difpenfations proves  
that it delights in the happinefs of man here,  
and his greater happinefs hereafter ; with all  
thefe blelTings what more is neceftary to make  
us a happy and a profperous people ? Still one

Friends V Fellow Citizens,  
  
Called upon to undertake the duties of  
the Firft Executive office of our country,  
I avail myfelf of theprefence of that por-  
tion of my fellow citizens which it here !  
allemblcd, to exprefs my grateful thanks i  
for the favor with which thev hare been j  
pleaied to look towards mc, to declare a &#x27;  
fincere confeioufnefs that the talk is j  
above my talents, and that I approach it j  
with thofe anxious and awful prefenti- I  
ments which the grcatnefs of the charge, I  
and the weaknefs of my powers fo juftly j  
mlpire. A riling nation, fpread over a  
wide anj, fruitful land, traverfing all the !  
feas witi the rich productions of their I  
induftry, engaged in commerce with na-  
tions wio feel power and forget right, I  
advancing rapidly to deftinies beyond the !  
reach of mortal eye j when I contem- 1  
plate thefe tranfeendant objects, and fee ]  
the honor, the happinefs, and the hopes!  
of this beloved country committed to the :  
iliue and the aufpiccs of this day, I flirink 1  
from the contemplation and humble my I  
felf before the magnitude of the under-  
taking. Utterly indeed fliould I defpair, I  
did not the p-efence of many, wtiu,» 1  
here fee, ren ind me, that, in the other j  
high authorities provided by our confli- &#x27;  
tution, I fliall find refources of wifdom;!  
of virture, snd of zeal, on which to rely  
under all cifficulties. To you, then,  
gentlemen, who are charged with the fo-  
vereign functions of legiflation, and to  
thofe affociated with you, I look with en-  
couragement for that guidance and fup-  
port whicl may enable us to fleer with  
fafety the veffel in which we are all em-  
barked, anidlt the conflicting elements  
of a troubled world.  
  
During the conteft of opinion through  
which we have paffed, the animation of  
difcufliors and of exertions, has fome-  
times worn an afpect which might impofe  
on ftrangers unuled to think freely, and  
to fpeak and write what they think ; but  
this leiig now decided by the voice of  
the nation, announced according to the  
rules of the conftitution, all will ofcourfe  
arrange themfelves under the will of the  
law, and unite in common efforts for the  
common good. All too will bear in mind  
this facred principle, that though the will  
of the majority is in all cafes to prevail,  
that will, to be rightful, mull be reafona- j  
able; that the minority poffefs their i  
equal rights, which equal laws muft pro- ;  
tect, and to violate would be opprelfion.  
Let us then fellow citizens, unite with  
one heart and one mind, let us reftore to  
focial intercourfe, that harmony and af-  
fection without which, liberty, and even  
life itfelf, are but dreary things. And  
let us reflect, that having baniflied from  
our land that religious intolerance under  
which mankind fo long bled and fuffered,  
we have yet gained little, if we counte-  
nance a political intolerance, as defpotic,  
as wicked, and capable of as bitter and  
bloody perfections. During the throes  
and convulfions of the ancient world, du-  
ring the agonizing fpafms of infuriated  
man, feeking through blood and (laughter  
his long loft libertv, it was not wonderful  
that the agitation of the billows lhould  
reach even this diftant and peaceful  
Chore : that this fliould be more felt and  
feared by fome and lefs by others j and  
mould divide opinions as to meafures of  
fafety ; but every difference of opinion is  
not a difference of principle. We have  
called by different names, men of the  
fame principle. We are all republicans —  
we are all federalills. If there be any  
among us who would villi to diffoire  
  
the union, or to change its republican  
form, let them ftand undifturbed, as mo-  
numents of the fafety with which er.  
ror of opinion may be tolerated, where  
reafou is left free to combat it. I know  
indeed that fome honeft men fear that a  
republican government is not ftrong en.&quot;  
ough. But would the honeft patriot, ifi  
the full tide of fuccefsful experiment,  
abandon a government which has fo far  
kept u» free and firm, on the theoretic,  
and vifionary fear that this government,  
the world&#x27;s beft hope, may poffibly want  
energy to preferve itfelf? I truft not. I  
believe this, on the contrary, the ftrongeft  
government on earth. I believe it the on-  
ly oneAvhere every man, at the call of the  
law, would fly to the ftandard of the law,  
and would meet invafions of the public  
order as his own perfonal concern —  
Sometimes it is faid that man cannot be  
truited with the government of himfelf.  
Can he then be trufted with the govern-  
ment of others ? Or have we found an.  
gels in the form of kings, to govern hira?  
Let hiftory anfwer this queftion.  
  
Let us then, with courage and confi-  
dence, purfueour own federal and repub.&quot;  
liean principles ; our attachment to uni-&#x27;  
on and reprefentative government. Kind-  
ly feparated by nature and a wide ocean  
from the exterminating havoc of one  
quarter of the globe ; too high minded to  
endure the degradations of the others,  
poffefling a cholcn country, with room e-  
nough for our dcfcen-Jants to the thou-  
fandth and thoufandth generation, enter*  
taining a due fenfe of our equal right ta  
the ufe of our own faculties, to the ac-  
quifitions of our own induftry, to honor  
and confidence from our fellow citizens,  
refulting not from birth, but from our  
actions and their fenfe o r them, enlight-  
ened by a benign religion, profeffed indeed  
and practifed in various forms, yet all of  
them inculcating honefty, truth, tempe-  
rance, gratitude and the love of man, ac-  
knowledging and adoring an overruling  
providence which by all its difpenfationi*  
proves that it delights in the happinefs of*  
man here, and his greater happinefs here-  
»ftcr : with all thefe bleflings what tnoro  
is tieccflary to make us a ...J , r . vi-  
  
perous people ? Still one thing more, fel-  
low citizens, a wife and frugal gevcrni  
ment which fliall reftrain men from injur-  
ing one another, fliall leave them other-  
wife free to regulate their own purfuits,  
of induftry and improvement, and fliall  
not take %&gt;m the mouth of labonrthe  
bread it has earned. This is the fum of  
good government ; and this is neceffary  
to clofe the circle of our felicities.  
  
About to enter fellow citizens, on the  
exercife of duties which comprehend eve-  
rything dear and valuable to you, it i*  
proper you fliould underftand what I  
deem the effential principles of our gov-

the magnitude of the undertaking. Ut-  
terly, indeed, fhould I defpair, did not  
the prefence of many whom I here fee, re-  
mind me, that, in the other high authori-  
ties provided by our conititution, I hall  
find refources of wifdom, of virtue, and  
of zeal, on which to rely under all diffi-  
culties. To you, then, gentlemen, who

* During the conteft of opinion through

diffolve this union, or to change its re-  
publican form, let them ttand undifturbed  
as monuments of the fafety with which  
error of opinion may be tolerated where  
reafon is left free to combat it. I know,  
indeed, that fome honefl men fear that a  
republican government cannot be ftrong ;  
that this government is not ftrong enough,  
But would the honeft, in the full tide of  
fuccefsful experiment, abandon a govern-  
ment which has fo far kept us free and  
firm, in the theoretic and vifionary fear  
that this government, the world’s bet  
hope, may, by poffibility, want energy  
to preferve itfelf? I truft not; I believe  
this, on the contrary, the ttrongett go-  
vernment on earth. I believe it the only  
one where every man, at the call of the  
Jaw, would fly to the ttandard of the law,  
and would meet invafions of the public or.  
der, as his own perfonal concern. Some-  
times it is faid that man cannot be trufted  
with the government of himfelf—Can he  
then be trufted with the government of  
others? Or have we found angels in the  
form of kings to govern him ? Let hiftory

federal and republican principles ; our at-  
tachment to union and reprefentative go-

Friends €9 Fellow-Citizens,  
  
&gt; ALLED uponto undertake the duties of  
the firft executive office of our country, I avail my-  
felf of the prefence of that portion of my fellow-  
citizens which is here afflembled, to exprefs my grate-  
ful thanks for the favour with which they have been  
pleafed to look towards me, to declarea fincere con-  
fcioufnefs that the tafk is above. my talents, and that  
I approach it with thofe anxious and awful prefenti-  
ments, which the greatnefs of the charge, and the  
weaknefs of my powers fo juftly infpire.. A rifing  
nation, fpread over a wide and fruitful land, travers-  
ing all the feas with the rich productions of their‘in-  
duftry, engaged in commerce with nations who feel  
power and forget right; advancing rapidly to defti-  
nies beyond the reach of mortal eye; when I con-  
template thefe tranfcendant objects, and fee the  
honor, the happinefs and the hopes of this beloved  
country, committed to the iffue and the aufpices of  
this day, I fhrink from the contemplation, and hum-  
ble myfelf before the magnitude of the undertaking.  
Utterly, indeed, fhould I defpair, did not the pre-  
fence of many, whom I here fee, remind me, that  
in the other high authorities, provided by our Con-  
ftitution, I fhall find refources of wifdom, of virtue,  
and of zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties.  
To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the  
fovereign funétions of legiflation, and to thofe affoci-  
ated with you, I look with encouragemen* for that  
guidance and fupport which may enable us to fteer  
with: fafety the veffel in which we are all embarked,  
amidft the conflicting elements of a troubled world.  
  
During the conteft of opinion through which we | by  
  
have pafled, the animation. of difcuflions:and of ex*  
ertions has fometimes worm an afpe&amp; which might  
  
  
  
impofe on ftrangers unufed to think freely, and to  
fpeak and to write what they think ; but this being  
now decided by the voice of the nation, anneunced  
according to-the rules of the Conftitution, all will,  
of courfe, arrange themfelves under the will of the  
law, and unite in common efforts for the common  
good. ‘All too will bear in mind this facred princi-  
ple, that though the will of the majority is in all  
cafes to prevail, that willto be rightful muft be rea-  
fonable ; that the minority poffefs their equal rights,  
which equal laws muft proteét, and to violate would  
be oppreflion. Let us then, fellow-citizens, unite  
with one leart and one mind, let us-reftore to focial  
intercourfe that harmony and affection, without  
which liberty, and even life itfelf, are but dreary  
things. And let&#x27;us refleét that having banifhed from  
our land that religious intolerance, under which  
mankind fo long bled and fuffered, we have yet  
gained: little, if we ‘countenance a political intole-  
rafice, as defpotic, as wicked, and capable of as  
bitter and bloody perfecutions. During the throes  
and convulfions of the ancient world, during the  
agonizing {pafins of infuriated man, feeking through  
blood and flaughter ‘his long loft liberty, it was not  
wonderful that the agitation of the billows fhould  
each even this diftant and peaceful fhore ; that this  
fhould be more felt and feared by fome, and lefs by  
others; and fhould divide opinions as to meafures of  
fafety ; but every difference of opinion is not.a dif-  
ference of principle. We have called by different  
names brethren of the fame principle.—We are au  
Republicans—We are au, Federalists. 1f there be any  
among us who would diffolve this union, or change  
its republican form, let them ftand undifturbed as  
monuments of the fafety with which error of opinion  
may be tolerated, where reafon is left free to combat  
it. _1know indeed that fome honeft men fear that  
a republican government cannot be ftrong; that this  
government is not ftrong enough. But would the  
honeft patriot, in the full tide of fuccefsful experi-  
ment, abandon a government which has fo far kept  
us free and firm, on the theoretic and vifionary fear,  
that this government, the world’s beft hope, may,  
flibility, want energy to preferve itfelf ? I truft  
not. 1 believethis,; on the contrary, the ftrongeft

—  
see the honour, the happiness, and the hopes of this  
beloved country, committed to the issue and the  
auspices of this day, I shrink from the contempla-  
tion, and humble myself before the magnitude of  
the undertaking. Utterly, indeed, should I despair,  
did not the presence of many, whom I here see, re-  
mind me, that in the other high authorities, pro-  
vided by our constitution, I shall find resources of  
wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely  
under all difficulties. ‘To you, then, gentlemen,  
who are charged with the sovereign functions of  
legislation, and to those associated with you, I look  
with encouragement for that guidance and support,  
which may enable us to steer, with safety, the vess  
sel in which we are all embarked, amidst the con-  
flicting elements of a troubled world.  
  
‘¢ During the contest of opinion, through which  
we have past, the animation of discussion and of  
exertions, has sometimes worn an aspect which  
might impose on strangers, unused to think freely,  
and to speak and to write what they think: but  
this being now decided by the voice of the nation,  
announced according to the rules of the constitution,  
all will, of course, arrange themselves under the  
will of the law, and unite in common efforts, for  
the common good. All, too, will bear in mind this  
sacred principle—that though the will of the majo-  
rity is, in all cases, to prevail, that will, to be right-  
ek must be reasonable—that the minority possess  
their equal rights, which equal laws must protect,  
and to violate would be oppression. Let us, then,  
fellow-citizens, unite with one heart, and one mind.  
Let us restore to social intercourse, that harmony  
and affection, without which, liberty, and even life  
itself, are but dreary things. And let us reflect,  
that, having banished from our land, that religious

suffered, we have yet gained little, if we counte-  
nance a political intolerance, as despotic, as wicked,  
and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.  
** During the throes and convulsions of the an-  
cient world—during the agonizing spasms of infu-  
riated man, seeking, through blood and slaughter,  
his long-lost liberty—it was not wondertul that the  
agitation of the billows should reach even this distant  
and peaceful shore—that this should be more felt  
and feared by some, and less by others—and should  
divide opinions, as to measures of safety. But  
every difference of opinion is not a difference of  
principle. We have called by different names, bre-  
thren of the same principle. WE ARE ALL  
REPUBLICANS; WE ARE ALL FEDERA-  
LISTS. If there be any among us, who would  
wish to dissolve this union, or to change its repub-  
lican form, let them stand undisturbed, as monu-  
ments of the safety with which error of opinion may  
be tolerated, where reason is left free to combat it.  
I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a  
republican government cannot be strong==that this  
yovernment is not strong enough. But would the  
honest patriot, in the full tide of the successful  
experiment, abandon a government which has so  
far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and vi-  
sionary fear, that this government the world’s best  
hope, may, by possibility, want energy to preserve  
itself ?—I trust not—I believe this, on the contrary,  
the strongest government on earth—I believe it the  
only one, where every man at the call of the law,  
would fly to the standard of the law, and would  
meet invasions of the public order as his own per-  
sonal concern. Sometimes it is said, that man can-  
not be trusted with the government of himself. Can  
he then be trusted with the government of others?

Or have we found angels, in the form of kings, to  
govern him? Let history answer this question.

sue our own federal and republican principles—our  
attachment to union and representative government.

the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe

thousandth generation—entertaining a due sense of  
our equal right to the use of our own faculties—to  
the acquisitions of our own industry—to honour  
and confidence from our fellow-citizens ; resulting  
not from birth, but from our actions, and their  
sense of them—enlightened by a benign religion,  
professed, indeed, and practised in various forms,  
yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth, tempe-  
rance, gratitude, and the love of man—acknow-  
ledging and adoring an over-ruling Providence,

of our heroes, have been devoted to their attain-  
ment. They should be the creed of our political  
faith—the text of civic instruction—the touchstone  
by which to try the services of those we trust: and  
should we wander from them, in moments of error  
or alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps, and to  
regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty,  
and safety.  
  
“¢ T repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the post you  
have assigned me. With experience enough in su-  
bordinate offices, to have seen the difficulties. of  
this, the greatest of all, I have learned to expect,  
that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man,  
to retire from this station, with the reputation, and  
the favour, which bring him into it. Without  
pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in  
our first and greatest revolutionary character, whose  
  
re-eminent services had entitled him to the first  
place in his country’s love, and destined for him  
the fairest page in the volume of faithful hiftory,  
I ask so much confidence only, as may give firm-  
ness and effect to the legal administration of your  
affairs. I shall often go wrong, through defect of  
judgment. When right, I shall often be thought  
wrong, by those whose positions will not command  
a view of the whole ground. I ask your indulgence  
for my own errors, which will never be intentionally;  
and your support against the errors of others, who  
may condemn what they would not, if seen in all  
its parts. The approbation implied by your suf-  
rage, is a great consolation to me for the past: and  
my future solicitude will be, to retain the good  
opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance,  
to conciliate that of others by doing them all the  
good in my power, and to be inftrumental to the  
happiness and freedom of all.

committed to the issue and tho auspices of this  
  
day, I shrink from the contemplation, and hum  
  
nio myscll belore tf magnitude ol the under  
  
taking. UtterlyTV&#x27;od should 1 despair, did  
not tho presence many, whom I here see,  
  
remind me, thaS.i the other high authorities  
  
provided by oi, constitution, I shall find re  
  
sources of wom, of virtue, and of zeal, on  
which to rel)T under all difficulties. To you,  
  
then, gentlemen, who arc charged with the  
  
sovereiMunctions of legislation, and to those  
afsoey d with you, I look with encourago­  
mer r that guidance and support which may  
  
en- a) us to steer with salcty the vessel in  
  
h we uro all embarked, amidst the conflic-  
  
ig elements of a troubled world.  
During tho contest of opinion through which  
  
we have past, the animation of discussions and  
  
of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect  
  
whic h might impose on strangers unused to  
  
think freely, and to sieak and to write what  
  
they think; but this being now decided by the  
voice of tho nation, announced according to  
  
the rules of tho constitution, all will of course  
arrange themselves under tho will of the law,  
  
and unite in common efforts for tho common  
  
good. All too will bear in mind &#x27;his sacred  
  
principle, that though the will of the majority  
  
is in all cases to prevail, that will, to bo rmht  
  
ful, must be reasonable; that the minority pos  
  
sess their cijual rights, which ciual laws must  
  
irolect, and to violate would bo oppression.  
  
Let us then, fellow citizens, unite with one  
  
heart and one mind, let us restore to social in  
  
tercourse that harmony and affection without  
which liberty, and even life itself, are but drea­  
ry things. And let us reflect that having ban­  
ished from oui land that religions intolerance  
  
under which mankind fo Ion&quot; bled and suffered.  
  
ve nave yet gamed httle, if we countenance  
  
apolitical intolerance, as denniie, as w irked.  
  
and callable of as bitter and bloody persecu  
  
tions. During the throes and convulsions of  
  
the nncient world, during the nconizinc spasms  
  
of infuriated man, seeking throush blood and  
  
slaughter bis lone lost liberty, it was not won  
  
derful that the agitation of the billows should  
  
reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that  
this should be more felt and feared bv some.  
  
and less by others; and should divide opinions  
  
as to measures of safety; but every d.fference  
  
of opinion is not a difference of principle.  
  
We have called by different names brethren of  
  
the some principle. We are all republicans:  
we are all federalists. If there be any among  
us who would wish to dissolve this Union, oi  
to change its republican form, let them stand  
undisturbed as monuments of the safety with  
which errour of opinion may be tolerated,  
where reason is left free to combat it. I know  
indeed that some honest men fear that a re  
  
publican government cannot be strong; that  
  
mis government is not strong enough. Hut  
  
would the honest patriot, in the full tide of sue  
  
r..i . . . .  
  
tcssiui experiment, abandon a frovernmem  
  
, , O  
  
winch has so tar kept us free and firm, on the  
  
uieoreiic ana visionary tear, that this irovern  
  
ment, the world&#x27;s best hope, may, by possibiji  
  
iy, wani energy to preserve itselU 1 trust  
  
not. 1 believe this, on the contrary, the stron  
  
gest government on earth. I believe it the only  
  
one, wnere every man, at the call of the law  
  
would tly to the standard of the law, and would  
  
meet invasions ot the public order as his own  
  
personal concern. Sometimes it is said that  
  
man cannot be trusted with the government of  
u : ii1 r i . . .  
  
iimiscii. tun no men he trusted with the  
  
government of others? Or have we found nn  
  
gels, in the form of kings, to govern him?  
  
juei History answer this question.  
Let us then, with courage and confidence  
pursue our own federal and republican princi  
pies; our attachment to union and representa  
  
tive government. Kindly separated by nature  
and a wide ocean from the exterminating hav­  
oc of one quarter of the globe; too high niinded  
  
to enaurctne degradations of tho others, dos.

honesty, truth, temperance, cralitudo and the  
  
lovo of man, acknowledging and adoring an  
  
overruling I&#x27;rovidcnce, which by all its dispen  
  
sations proves that it delights in tho happiness  
  
oi man ncro, ana nis greater happiness hereaf

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Friend* and fellow-citizen*:  
i-.ii. i m undertake the duties of the first EjX­  
etuil*c ulUtc ur ? ?? *7&quot;, ilin ino­  
sence of that portion of my fellow-cinzens wKi&lt;-#r  
here assembled, to express my grateful thanks tor the  
favor with which they have been pleased to loot to­  
wards me, to declare a sincere consciousness that the  
task is above my talents and that I approach it with  
those anxious and awful presentiments which the  
greatness of the charge, and the weakness of my  
powers so justly inspire. A rising nstion, spread over  
a wide and fruitful land, traversing all the seas with  
the rich productions of their industry, engaged in  
commerce with nations who feel power and forget  
right, advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the  
reach of mortal eye ; when I contemplate these tran­  
scendent objects, and see the honor, the happiness and  
the holies of this beloved country committed to the is­  
sue and the auspices of this day, I shrink from the  
contemplation and humble myself before the magni­  
tude of the undertaking. Utterly indeed should 1  
despair, did not the presence of many whom 1 here  
see remind me, that, in the other high authorities pro­  
vided by our constitution, I shall find resources of wis­  
dom of virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely under all  
difficulties. To you, then, gentlemen, who arc charg­  
ed with the sovereign functions of legislation, and to  
those associated with you, I look with encouragement  
for that guidance and support which may enable us to  
steer with safety the vessel in which we are all em­  
barked, amid the conflicting elements of a troubled  
During the contest of opinion through which we  
have parsed, the animation of discussions and of ex­  
ertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might  
impose on strangers unlised to think freely, and to  
speak and to write what they think; but this being  
now decided by the voice of the nation, announced  
accoiding to the rules of the constitution, all will of  
course arrange themselves under the will ot the law,  
and unite in common efforts for the common good.  
All too will liear in mind this sacred principle, that  
though the will of the majority is in all cases to pre­  
vail that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that  
the minority jk&gt;*sess their equal right*, which equal  
law must protect, anil to violate would be oppression.  
Let us then, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and  
one mind, let us restore to social intercourse that har­  
mony and affection without which, liberty, and even  
life itself, are but dreary things. And let us reflect,  
that having banished from our land that religious in­  
tolerance under which mankind so long bled and suf­  
fered we have yet gained little, if we countenance a  
political intolerance, as despotic, as wicked, and ca­  
pable of as bitter and bloody jiersecutions. During  
the throes and convulsions of the ancient world, dur­  
ing the agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking  
through blnod and slaughter his long lost liberty, it  
was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows  
should reach even this distant and peaceful shore:  
that this should be more felt and feared by some and  
less by others , and should divide opinions as to mea­  
sures of safely ; but every difference of opinion is not  
a difference of principle. We have called by different  
names brethren of the same principle. We are all re­  
publicans: we are all federalists. It there be any  
among us who would wish to dissolve this Union, or  
to change its republican form, let them stand undis­  
turbed as monuments of the safety with which eiror  
of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is left free  
to combat it. I know indeed that some honest men  
fear that a republican government cannot l&gt;e strong :  
that this government is not strongenough. But would  
the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experi­  
ment, abandon a government which has so far kept us  
free and firm on the theoretic, and visionary fear that  
this government, the world&#x27;s best hope, may, by pos­  
sibility, want energy to preserve ilsell 1 I tiust not.  
1 believe this, on the contrary, the strongest govern­  
ment on earth. 1 believe it the only one where every  
man, at the call of the laws, would fly to the standard  
of the law, and would meet invasions of the public  
order as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is  
said that man cannot be trusted with the govrrnmenl  
of himself! Can he then be trusted with the govern­  
ment of others&#x27;? Or have we found angels in the  
form of kings to govern him 1 Let history answer  
this question.  
Lei us then, with courage and confidence, pursue  
our own &#x27;federal and republican principles , our attach  
ment to union and representative government. Kin.i­  
Iv separated by nature ami a wide ocean from the el­  
iminating havoc of one quarter of the globe; too  
Inch m nded to en.lure&#x27;the degradations of ihc others;

by all Us dispensation* provea that it delighu in the  
happineaa of man here, and his greater happiness here­

ry to make us a Lappy and prosperous people 1 Still  
one thing more, feflow-citiiens?a wise and frugal  
government, which ahall restrain men from injuring  
one another, ahall leave them otherwiae free to regulate  
their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and

has earned. Thia is the aum of good government,

jualice to all men of whatever atale or perauaaion, re­

none: the support of the state governments in all their  
rights, as the most competent administrationa for our  
domeatic concerns, and the surest bulwarka against  
anti-republican tendenciea: the preservation of the  
general government in its whole constitutional vigor,  
as the aheet anchor of our peace at home, and safety  
abtoad ; a jealoua care of the right of election bv the  
people; a mild and aafe corrective of abuaea which are  
lopped by the aword of (evolution, whete peaceable  
teiiiedies are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the  
decisions of the majority, the vital principle of repub­  
lics, from which is no appeal but to force, the vital  
principle and immediate parent of despotism : a well  
disciplined militia, our beat reliance in peace, and for  
the first moments of war, till regulars may relieve them;  
the supremacy of the civil over the military authority  
?econo&#x27;uy in the public expense, that labor may be  
lightly burthened ; the honest payment of our debts,  
and sac rod preservation of the puMic faith; encour­  
agement of agriculture, and of commerce as its hand­  
maid : the diffuaion of information, and arrangement  
of all abuaes at the bar of the public reason: freedom  
of religion; freedom of the press ; and freedom of per­  
son, under the protection of the habeas corpus; and  
trial bv juriea impartially selected. These principles  
form the bright constellation which has gone before us.  
and guided our steps through an age of revolution and  
reformation. The wiadom of our sages, and blood of  
our heroes, have been devoted to tneii attainment;  
they should be the creed of our political faith; the text  
of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try  
the services of those we trust; and should we wander  
from them in moments of error or alarm, let us hasten  
to retrace our steps, and to regain the load which alone  
leads to peace, liberty, and safety.  
I repair then, fellow-citicens, to the post you have  
assigned me. With experience enough in subordi­  
nate offices to have seen the difficulties of this, the  
greatest of all, I have learnt to expect that it will rare­  
ly fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from thia

ness and effect to the legal administration of your af­

those whose position will not command a view of the  
whole ground. 1 ask your indulgeance for my own  
errors, which will never be intentional; and your sup­  
port against the errors of others, who may condemn  
what they would not, if seen in all its parts. The ap­  
probation implied by your suffrage is a great consola­  
tion to me for the past; and my future solicitude will  
be, to retain the good opinion of those who have ber  
stowed it in advance, to conciliate that of others by  
doing them all the good in my power, and to be instru­  
mental to the happiness and freedom of all.  
Relying then on the patronage of your good will, I  
advance with obedience to the work, ready to retire  
from it whenever you become sensible how much bet­  
ter choices it is in your |&gt;ower to make. And may  
that infinite Power which rules the destinies of the

them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Friends andfellow-citizens:  
Called upon to undertake the duties of the first Ex  
ecutive ofiice of our country, I avail myself of the pre  
sence of that portion of my fellow-citizens which i  
here assembled, to express my grateful thanks for th  
favor with which they have been pleased to look tc  
wards me, to declare a sincere consciousness thut th  
tntilr ia nlinvo mv tnlanta nnil tViAt T annrnafth it witl  
  
those anxious and awful presentiments which th  
greatness of the charge, and the weakness of m;  
powers so justly inspire. A rising nation, spread ove  
a wide And fruitful land, traversing all the seas witl  
the rich productions of their industry, engaged ii  
commerce with nations who feel power and forge  
right, advancing rapidly to destinies beyond th  
reach of mortal eye; when I contemplate these tran  
scendant objects, and see the honor, the happiness, am  
the hopes of this beloved country committed to the is  
sue and the auspices of this day, I shrink from th  
contemplation a,nd humble myself before the magni  
tude of the undertaking. Utterly indeed should  
despair, did not the presence of many whom I hen  
see remind me, that, in the other high authorities pro  
vided by our constitution, 1 shall find resources of wis  
dom, of virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely under al  
difficulties. To you, then, gentlemen, who are charg  
ed with the sovereign functions of legislation, and u  
those associated with you, I look with encouragement  
for thit guidance and support which may enable us to  
steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked,  
amid the conllicting elements of a troubled  
world.  
During the contest of opinion through which wc  
have pissed, the animation of discussions and of exertions  
has sometimes worn an aspect which might  
impose on strangers unused to think freely, and t&lt;  
speak and to write what they think ; but this bein$  
now decided by the voice of the nation, announce!  
accoiding to the rules t&gt;f the constitution, all will o  
  
course arrange themselves under the will of the law  
and unite in common efforts for the common good.?  
All too will bear in mind this sacred principle, tha  
though the will of the majority is in all cases to pre  
vail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; tha  
the minority poeeees their equal rights, which equa  
law must protect, and to violate would tm uj-pjeesicr  
Let mi then, fellow -citizens, unite with one heart am  
one mind, let us restore to social intercourse that bar  
mony and affection without which, liberty, and evei  
life itself, are but dreary things. And let us reflect  
that, having banished from our land that religious in  
tolerance under which mankind so long bled and suf  
fercd, we have yet gained little, if we countenance i  
political intolerance, as despotic, us wicked, and ca  
pable of as bitter and bloody persecutions. During  
the throes and convulsions of the ancient world, dur  
ing the agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking  
through blood and slaughter his long lo:?t liberty, it  
was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows  
should reach even this distant and peaceful shore;  
that this should be more felt and feared by some and  
less by others; and should divide opinions as to measures  
of safety ; but every difference of opinion is not  
a difference of principle. We have called by different  
names brethren of the same principle. We are all republicans:  
we are all federalists. If there be any  
among us who would wish to dissolve this Union, or  
to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed  
as monuments of the safety with which error  
of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is left free  
to combat it. 1 know indeed that some honest men  
fear that a republican government cannot be strong;  
that this government is notstrongenough. But would  
the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment,  
abandon a government which has so far kept us  
free and firm on the theoretic, and visionary fear that  
this government, the world&#x27;s lest hope, may, by possibility,  
want energy to preserve itself? I tiust not.  
I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest government  
on earth. I believe it the only one where every  
man, at the call of the laws, would fly to the standard  
if the law, and would meet invasions of the public  
rrder as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is  
said that man cannot be trusted with the government  
jf himself! Can he then be trusted with the government  
of others 7 Or have we found angels in the  
form of kings to govern him 7 Let history answer  
his question.  
Let us, then, with courage and confidence, pursue  
&gt;ur own federal and republican principles ; our attachment  
to union and representative government. Kindy  
separated by nature and a wide ocean from the excrminating  
havoc of one quarter of the globe; too  
high minded to endure&#x27;the degradations of vTie others;  
possessing a chosen country, with room enough for  
)ur descendants to the thousandth and thousandth  
generation; entertaining a due sense of our equal  
right to the use of our own faculties, to the acquisilions  
of our industry, to honor and confidence from  
jur fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from  
iur actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a  
benign religion, professed indeed and practised in various  
forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth,  
temperance, gratitude, and the love of man. acknow­  
  
edging and adoring an overruling Providence, which,  
l?y all its dispensations, proves that it delights in the  
happiness of man here, and his greater happiness hereafter  
; with all these blessings, what more is necessa  
ry to make us a happy and prosperous people 1 Stil  
one thing more, fellow-citizens?a wise and fruga  
government, which shall restrain men from injuring  
one another, shall leave them otherwise free toregulati  
their own pursuits of industry and improvement, am  
shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread i

and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities  
About to enter, fellow-citizens, on the exercise c

ter. Frien is and Fdloic-Cilizens,  
Called unon to undertake the duties of the first  
executive office of our country. I avail myself of  
the presence of that portion of my fellow-citizens,  
which is here assembled, to express my grateful  
tiianks, for the favor with which they have been  
pleased to look towards me; to declare a sincere  
consciousness, that the task is above my talents,  
and that I approach it with those anxious and aw­  
f j! presentiments which the greatness of the charge,  
and the weakness of my powers, so justly inspire.  
A rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful  
land traversiug all the seas with the rich pro­  
ductions of their industry engaged in commerce  
with nations who feel power and forget right  
advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach  
of mortal eye when I contemplate these trans­  
cendent objects, and see the honor, the happiness,  
and the hopes of this beloved country, committed  
to the issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink  
from the contemplation, and humble myself before  
the magnitude of the undertaking. Utterly, in­  
deed, should I despair, did not the presence of ma­  
ny, whom I here see, remind me, that in the oth­  
er high authorities provided by our constitution,  
I shall find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and  
of zeal, on which to Tely under all difficulties, j  
To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with j  
the sovereign functions of legislation, and those j  
associated with you, I look with encouragement  
for that guidance and support, which may enable  
us to steer, with safety, the vessel in which we are  
all embarked, amidst the conflicting elements of a  
troubled world.  
Daring the contest of opinion, through which  
we have past, the animation of discussions and of  
exertions, has sometimes worn an aspect which  
might impose on strangers, unused to think free­  
ly, and to speak and to vtrite what they think ;  
but this being now decided by the voice of the na­  
tion, announced according to the rules of the con­  
stitution, all will, of course, arrange themselves  
under the will of the law, and unite in common  
efforts, for the common good. All, too, will bear  
in mind this sacred principle; that though the  
will of the majority is, in all cases, to prevail,  
that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable that  
the minority possess their equal rights, which  
equal laws must protect, and to violate would be  
oppression. Let us then, fellow-citizens, unite  
with one heart, and one mind. Let us restore to  
social intercourse, that harmony and affection,  
without which, liberty, and even life itself, are but  
dreary things, and let us reflect, that, harms: ban  
ished from our land, that religious intolerance,  
under which mankind so long bled and suffered,  
we have vet gained little, u we countenance a do  
litical intolerance, as despotic, as wicked, and cap-  
II S 1- 111 &#x27;  
aoie or as outer and Diooay persecutions.  
During the throes and convulsions of the an  
cient world durinsr the ap-onizins; spasms of in  
furiated man, seeking, through blood and slaugh  
ter, his long lost liberty it was not wonderful  
that the agitation of the billows should reach even  
this distant and peaceful shore that this should be  
more felt and feared by some, and less by others:  
and should divide opinions, as to measures of safe­  
ty. But every difference of opinion is not a differ  
ence of principle. We have called by different  
names, brethren of the same principle. vvL  
ARE ALL REPUBLICANS; WE ARE  
all j? Luii.KAL.is rs. it there be any a-  
mong us, who would wish to dissolve this union,  
or to change its republican form, let them stand  
undisturbed, as monuments of the safety with  
which error of opinion may be tolerated, where  
reason is left free to combat it. I know indeed  
that some honest men fear that a republican gov-  
iernment cannot be strong that this government  
ii not strong enough. Bui would the honest pat  
  
riot, in the full tide of successful experiment, a­  
bandon a government which has so far keot Us  
  
; free and firm, on the theoretic and visionary fear,  
mat mis government, the world s best hope, may,  
by possibility, want energy to preserve itself; I  
trust not I believe this, on the contrary, the  
strongest government on earth I believe it the  
only one, where every man, at the call of the law,  
would fly to the standard of, the law, and would  
meet invasions of the public order as his ownper­  
sonal concern. - Sometimes it is said, that man  
cannot be trusted with the government of himself.  
Can he then be trusted with the government of  
others? or have we iound angels, in the form of  
kings, to govern him ? Let history answer this  
question.  
Let us, then, with courage and confidence, pur­  
sue our own federal and republican principles  
our attachment to union and representative gov­  
ernment Kindly separated, by nature and a wide  
ocean, from the exterminating havoc of one quar­  
ter of the globe too highminded to endure the  
degradations of the others possessing a chosen  
country, with room enough for our descendants to  
the thousandth and thousandth generation enter­  
taining a due sense of our equal right to the use  
of our own faculties to the acquisitions of our  
own industr to honor and confidence from our  
fellow-citizens; resulting not from birth, but from  
our actions, and their sense of them enlightened  
by a benign religion, professed,&#x27; indeed, and prac­  
tised in various forms, yet all of them inculcating  
honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love  
of man acknowledging and adoring an overrul­  
ing Providence, which, by all its dispensations,  
proves that it delights in the happiness of man  
here, and his greater happiness hereafter with  
all these blessings, what more is necessary to make&#x27;  
us a happy and prosperous people? Still one  
thing more, fellow-citizens, a wise and frugal gov­  
ernment, which shall restrain men from injuring  
one another ; shall leave them otherwise free to  
regulate their own pursuits of industry and im  
provement: and shall n&quot;t take from the mouth of  
labour the bread it has earned. This is the sum  
of good government ; and this is necessary to close  
the circle of our felicities.  
About to enter, fellow-citizens, on the exercise  
of duties, which comprehend every thing dear  
and valuable to vou, it is proper you should un  
derstand what 1 deem the essential principles of  
our government, and consequently those which  
ought to shape its administration. I will com­  
press them within the narrowest compass they  
will bear, staling the general principle, but not all  
its limitations. Equal and exact justice to all  
men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or  
political peace, commerce, and honest friend­  
ship with all nations entangling alliances with  
none the support of the State governments in all  
their rights, as the most competent administrations  
for our domestic concerns, and the surest bulwarks  
against anti-republican tendencies the preserva­  
tion of the general government in its whole con­  
stitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace

ch has gone before us.  
and guided our steps through an age of revolution  
and reformation. The wisdom of our sages, and  
blood of our heroes, have been devoted to their at­  
tainment They should be the creed of our po­  
litical faith the text of civic instruction the  
touchstone by which to try the services of those  
we trust; and should we wanaer irom mem, in  
moments of error or alarm, let us hasten to re  
trace our steps, and to regain the road which a-  
lone leads to peace, liberty, and salety.  
I repair, trrn, fellou&#x27; citizens, tome post you nave  
assigned me. wun experience eiiougu iu auuur­  
dinate offices, to have seen the difficulties of this,  
the greatest of all, I have learned to expect, that  
it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man, to  
retire from this station, with the reputation and  
the fivor, which bring him into it. Without pre­  
tensions to that high confidence you reposed in our ,  
first and greatest revolutionary character, whose  
n?e-eminent services had entitled him to the first  
nlace in his country s love, and destined ior nun  
the fairest page in the volume of faithful history,  
I ask so much confidence only, as may give nrm-  
ness and effect to the legal administration of your  
affairs. I shall often go wrong, through defect of  
judgment When right I shall often be thought  
wrong, by those whose positions wiu not com  
mand a view ot the whole ground. 1 asK your  
indulgence for my own errors, which will never  
be intentional : and your support against the errors  
of others, who may condemn what they would  
not, if seen in all its parts. The approbation im  
plied by your suffrage, is a great consolation to  
me for the past : and my future solicitude will be,  
to retain the good opinion of those who have be­  
stowed it in advance, to conciliate that of others  
by doing them all ,the good in my power, and  
to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom  
of all. &#x27;  
Reiving then, on the patronage of your good  
will, I advance with obedience to the work, ready  
to retire from it whenever you become sensible  
how much better choices it is in your power to  
make. And may that infinite Power, which  
rules the destinies of the universe, lead oat-coun  
cils to what is best, and give them a .favorable is  
sue, for our peace and prosperity.

Friends and Fellow Citizens :   
  
Called upon to undertake the duties of the   
first executive office of our country, I avail   
myself of the presence of that portion of my   
fellow citizens which is here assembled, to   
express grateful thanks for the favor with   
which they have been pleased to look to­  
wards me, to declare a sincere consciousness   
that the task is above my talents, and that I   
approach it with those anxious and awful   
presentments which the greatness of the   
charge and the weakness of my powers so   
justly inspire. A rising nation, spread over   
a wide and fruitful land, traversing all the   
seas with the rich production of their in­  
dustry, engaged in commerce with nations   
who feel power and forget right, advancing   
rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mor­  
-tal eye—when-I contemplate these trans­  
cendent objects, and see the honor, the hap­  
piness, and the hopes of this beloveiffeountty   
committed to the issue and the aueirces of this   
day, I shrink from the contemplation, and   
humble myself before the magnitude of the   
undertaking. Utterly, indeed, should I de­  
spair, did not the presence of many whom I   
here see remind me, that in other high au­  
thorities provided by our constitution I shall   
find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of   
zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties.   
To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged   
with the sovereign functions of legislation,   
and to those associated with you, I look with   
encouragement for that guidance and sup­  
port which may enable us to steer with safe­  
ty the vessel in which we are all embarked   
amid the conflicting elements of a troubled   
world. * * * All too, will bear in mind this   
sacred prinCiple, that though the will of the   
majority is in all cases to prevail, that will,   
to be rightful, must be reasonable ; that the   
minority possess their equal rights, which   
equal laws must protect, and to violate which   
would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow   
citizens, unite with one heart and one mind.   
Let us restore to social intercourse that har­  
mony and affection without which liberty and   
even life itself are but dreary things. And   
let us reflect that having banished from our   
land that religious intolerance under which   
mankind so long bled and suffered, we have   
yet gained little if we countenance a political   
intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and cap­  
able of as bitter and bloody persecutions.—  
During the throbs and convulsions of the an­  
cient world, during the agonizing spasms of   
infuriated man, seeking through blood and   
slaughter his long lost liberty, it was not   
wonderful that the agitation of the billows   
should reach even this distant and peaceful   
shore; that this should be more felt and fear­  
ed by some and less by others; that this&#x27;   
should divine opinions as to measures of safe­  
ty. But every difference of opinion is not   
a difference of principle. We have called   
by different names brethren of the same   
principle. We are all republicans—we are   
all federalists. * * * Let us, then, with cou­  
rage and confidence pursue our own federal   
and republican principles, our attachment to   
our Union and representative government.   
Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean   
from the exterminating havoc of one quarter   
of the globe, too high-minded to endure the   
degradations of the others ; possessing echo­  
sen country, with room enough for our des­  
cendants to the hundreth and thousandth   
generation; entertaing a due sense of our   
equal right to the use of our own faculties,   
to the acquisitions of our industry, to honor   
and confidence from our fellow citizens, re­  
sulting not from birth but from our actions   
and their sense of them; enlightened by a   
benign influence, professed , ndeed, and prac­  
tised in various fortes, yet all of them in­  
cluding honesty, truth, temperance, grat­  
itude, and the love of man; acknowledging   
and adoring an overuling Providence,   
Which by all its dispensations proves that it   
&#x27;delights in the happiness of man here and   
his greater happiness hereafter, with all these   
blessings, what more is upeessary to make   
us a happy andprosperous people*? * * *   
About to enter, fellow citizens, on the exer­  
cise of duties which comprehendevery thing   
dear and valuable to you, it is proper that   
you should understand what I deep, the es­  
sential principles of our government, and con­  
sequently those which ought to shape its   
administration. I will compress them within   
the narrowest compass they will bear, stat­  
ing the general principle; but not all its lim­  
itations. Equal and exact justice to all men   
of whatever state or persuasion, religious or   
political; peace, commerce and honest friend­  
ship with all nations—entangling alliances   
with none; the support of the state govern­  
ments in all their rights, as the moat com­  
petent administration for our domestic con­  
cargo and the surest bulwarks against anti­  
republican tendencies ; ;he preservation of.   
the general government in its whole con­  
stitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our   
peace at home and safety abroad; a jealous

| “Let us reflect, that, having banished from

I which mankind so long bled and suffered, we  
. have yet gained little, if we countenance a  
political intolerance as despotic, as wicked,  
and capapb/e of as bitter and bloody perse­  
cutions. During the throes and convulsions  
of the ancient world: during the agonizing  
spasms of infuriated man, seeking, through  
blood and slaughter, his long lost liberty, it  
was not wonderful that the agitation of the  
billows should reach even this distant and  
peaceful shore; that this should be more felt  
and feared by some, and less by others, and  
should divide opinions as to measures of safe­  
ty: but every difference of opinion is not a  
difference of principle. We have called by  
different names brethren of tin* sam*‘ princi­  
ple. We are all republicans: we are all  
federalists. If there be any among us who  
would wish to dissolve this Union, or to  
change its republicen form, let them stand,  
undisturbed, as monuments of the safety with  
which error of opinion may be tolerated,  
where reason is left free to combat it.  
“Possessing a chosen country, with room  
enough for our descendants to the thousandth  
and thousandth generation; entertaining a  
due sense of our equal right to the use of our  
faculties, to the acquisitions of our own in­  
dustry. to honor and confidence from our fel­  
low-citizens. resulting not from birth, but  
from our actions, and their sense ot them:  
enlightened by a benign religion, professed,  
indeed, and practised, in various forms, yet  
all of them inculcating honesty, truth, tem­  
perance. gratitude, and the love of man; ac­  
knowledging and adoring an overruling Pro­  
vidence which by all its dispensations, proves  
that it delights in the happiness of man here,  
and his greater happiness hereafter.—with all  
these blessings, what more is necessary to  
make us a happy and prosperous people?—  
Still one thing more, fellow-citizens a wise  
and frugal Government, which shall restrain  
men from injuring one another, shall leave  
them, otherwise free to regulate their own  
pursuits of industry and improvement, and  
shall not take from the mouth of labor the  
bread it has earned. This is the sum of good  
government, and this is necessary to close the  
circle of our felicities.

When Democrats talk of secession in the

to tho country in his Inaugural speech, on

erable to the  
present. condition of things. .  
It. must he confessed that the present times  
are cnvironed with peril. Never was there  
need of a morcfratcmcl spirit, such as submits  
to sacriﬁces of personal feelings for the public  
good. Sever was there a. louder demand that  
the Federal Constitution should be faithfully  
observed by States and individuals; and that  
every nullificai-ion law now defacing the statute  
books of dﬂferent members of the Confederacy,  
should be immediately repealed.  
Let men North and South give earnest heed  
to the words of J cﬂ’erson, in his Inaugural  
Address, as follows :  
During the contestof opinion through which we have  
passed. the animation of discussion and of exertion:  
has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on  
strangers unused to think freely and to speak. and to  
write what they think, but this being now decided by  
the voice of the notion, announced according to- the  
rules of the Constitution, all will, of course, arrange  
themselves under the will of the law, and unite in com­  
mon efforts for the common good All, too. will bear  
in mind this scored principle, that though the will of  
the majoritv is in all cases to prevail, that will, to be  
rightful, must he remonnblu; that the minority possess  
their equal nights, which equal laws must, protect, and  
to violate which would he oppression. Let us, then,  
fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and one mind.—  
Let us restore to socia. intercourse that harmony and  
affection without which liberty and even life itself are  
but dreary things. And let us reﬂect that having hun­  
ished from our land that religious intolerance under  
which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet  
gained little if we conuteunnce a political intolerance as  
despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody  
persecutions. During the throes and convulsions .of  
the an ient world. during the scanning spasms of in­  
furinted men, seeking through I) cod and slaughter his  
long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agita­  
tion of the billovr&#x27;s should reach even this distant and  
peaceful shore; that this should be more felt and feared  
by some and less by others; that this should divide  
opinions us to monomer; of safety. But every diﬁerence  
of opinion i: not a. diﬂ‘erence of principle. We have  
called by different names brethren of the same principle.  
We are all republicans—we are all federalists. If there  
be any among us who would wish to dissolve this  
Union or to change its rep vblicun form, let them stand  
undisturbed us monuments of the satiety with which  
error of opinion may be toleratud where reason is left  
free to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest  
men fear that -a. republican government cannot be  
strong; that this government is not strong enough.—  
But would the honest patriot, in the full tide of mo­  
éessfnl experiment, abandon a. government which has  
no for kept us free and ﬁrm, on the theoretic and vision­  
any fast that this government, the world’s best hope,  
may by possibility want energy to preserve itself ’! -I  
trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, tue strong­  
est government on earth. I believe it the only one  
where every man, st the call of the laws, would ﬂy to  
the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of  
the public order as his own personal concern. Some­  
times it is said that mm cannot be trusted with the  
government of himself. lion he. then, be trusted with  
the government of others? 01- have we found angels  
in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history on­

Fuiends and Fellow Citizens:—Called  
upon to undertake the duties of the first  
Executive office of our country, I avail my­  
self of the presence of that portion of my  
fellow citizens which is here assembled, to  
express my grateful thanks for ♦ lie favor  
with which they have been pleased to look  
towards me; to declare a sincere concious  
ness that tlie task is above my talents; and  
that I approach it with (hose anxious and  
awful presentments which the greatness of  
the charge, and the weakness of my power,  
so justly inspire. A rising nation, spread  
over a wide and fruitful land; traversing all  
seas with rich productions of their industry;  
engaged in commerce with nations who feel  
power and forget right; advancing rapidly to  
destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye;  
when I contemplate these transcendent ob­  
jects, and see the honor, the happiness, and  
the hopes of this beloved country, commit  
led to the issue and theauspicies of this day,  
I shrink from the contemplation, and hum­  
ble mvself before the magnitude of the un­  
dertaking. Utterly should I despair, did not  
tiie presence of the many whom I here see,  
remind me, that, in the other high authori­  
ties provided by our Constitution, 1 shall  
find resources of wisdom, of virtue and of  
zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties.  
To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged  
with the sovereign functions of legislation,  
and to those associated with you, I look with  
encouragement for that guidance and supi  
port which may enable us to steer with safe  
ty the vessel in which we are all embarked  
amidst the conflicting elements of n troubled  
world.  
During the contest of opinion through  
which wo have passed, the animalian of dis&#x27;  
missions and of exertions has sometimes  
worn an aspect which might impose on  
strangers unused to think freely, and to  
speak and write what they think; hut this  
being now decided by the voice of the nation,  
announced according to the rules of the  
Constitution, all will arrange themselves, uni  
der the will of the law, and unite in common  
efforts for common good. All too, will hear  
in mind this sacred principle, that, through  
the will of the majority is in all cases to  
prevail, that will, to ha rightful, must he  
reasonable; that the minority possess their  
equal rights, which equal law must protect,  
and to violate it would he oppression. Let  
us then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart  
and one mind-—let ns restore to social inter­  
course that harmony and affection, without  
which, liberty, and even life itself are hut  
dreary things. And let us reflect, that, hav  
ing banished from our land that religious  
intolerance under which mankind so long  
bled and suffered, we have yet gained little,  
if we countenance political in&#x27;oleianee, as  
despotic, as wicked, and capable of wicked  
and bloody persecutions. During the throes  
and convulsions of the ancient world; during  
the agonizing spasms of infuriated man,  
seeking, through blood anil slaughter, bis  
long lost liberty; it was not wonderful that  
the agitation of the billows should reach  
even tills distant and peaceful shore; that  
this should ho more fell and feared by some,  
and less by others; and should divide opin  
ion as measures of safety; hut every differ­  
ence of opinion is not difference of principle.  
We have called by different names bretbern  
of the same principle. We are all Republb  
cans; we are all Federalists. If there be any  
among us who would wish to dissolve ibis  
Union, or to change its republican form, let  
them stand undisturbed as monuments of the  
safety with which error of opinion may he  
tolerated, where reason is left free to combat  
it. I know, indeed, that some honest men  
fear that a republican form of government  
cannot bo strong enough. But would the  
honest patriot, in the full tide of successful  
experiment, abandon a Government which  
has so far kept us free and firm, on the them  
relic and visionary fear, that this Govern­  
ment, the world’s best hope, may, by possi­  
bility, want energy to preserve itself? I  
trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the  
strongest government on earth. I believe it.  
the only one, where every man, nt the call  
of the law, would tiy to the standard of the  
law, and would meet invasion of the public  
order as his own personal concern. Some­  
times it is said that man cannot be trusted  
with the government of himself. Can he  
then he trusted with the government of oth­  
ers! Or have we found angels, in Ihe form  
of kings, to govern him? Let history am  
swer this question.  
Let us then with courage and confidence  
pursue our own federal and republican prin­  
ciples: onr attachment to union and repre­  
sentative government. Kindly separated by  
nature and a wide ocean from the extermina  
ling havoc of one quarter of the globe; 100  
high minded to endure the degradations of  
the others; possessing a chosen country  
with room enough for our descendants of the  
lhausandth and thousandth generation; en­  
tertaining a due sense of our equal right to the  
use of our own faculties, to the acquisitions  
of our own industry, to honor and confidence  
from our fellow citizens, resulting not from  
birth, hut from our actions and their sense  
of them; enligthened by a benign religion,  
professed in deeds and practiced in various  
forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty,  
truth, temperance, gratitude, and love of

form the bl ight constellation, which has gone

I repair then, fellow citizens, to the post

as min&#x27; give firmness and effect to the legal  
administration of your affairs. I shall often  
go wrong, through defect of judgement.  
When right, I shall often he thought wrong

dulgence for my own errors, which will nev­

the errors of others, who may condemn  
what they would not, if seen in all its parts.  
The approbation implied by your suffrage is  
a great consolation to me for the past; and  
my future solicitude will be, to retain the  
good opinion of those who have bestowed it.  
in advance, to conciliate that of others by  
doing them all the good in my power, and  
to be instrumental in the happiness and freei

Relying, then, on the patronage of your  
good will, I advance with obedience to the  
work, ready to retire from it whenever you  
become sensible bow much better choices it  
is in vonr power to make. And may that

Friends and Felloto Citisens?  
  
Called upon to undertake the duties of  
the first executive office of our country, I  
avail myself of the presence of that por­  
tion of my fellow citizens which is here as­  
sembled, to express my grateful thanks for  
the favor with which they have been pleas­  
ed to look toward me, to declare a sincere  
consciousness that the task is above my tal  
ents, and that I approach it with those anx  
ious and awful presentiments which the  
greatness of the charge and the weakness  
of my powers so justly inspire. A rising  
nation, spread over a wide and fruitful  
land; traversing all the seas with the rich  
productions of their industry; engaged in  
commerce with nations who feel power and  
forget right; advancing rapidly to destinies  
beyond the reach of mortal eye--when I  
contemplate these transcendant objects, and  
see the honor, the happiness, and the hopes  
of this beloved country committed to the  
issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink  
from the contemplation, and humble my­  
self before the magnitude of the undertak­  
ing. Utterly, indeed, should I despair, did  
not the presence of many whom I here see  
remind me that in the other high authori­  
ties provided by our Constitution I shall  
find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of  
zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties.  
To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged  
with the sovereign functions of legislation,  
and to those associated with you, I look  
with encouragement for that guidance and  
support which may enable us to steer with  
safety the vessel in which we are all em­  
barked, amidst the conflicting elements of  
a troubled world.  
During the contest of opinion through  
which we have passed, the animation of dis  
cussions and of exertions has sometimes  
worn an aspect which might impose ion  
strangers, unused to think freely, and to  
speak and to write what they think; but,  
this being now decided by the voice of the  
nation, announced, according to the rules  
of the Constitution, all will, of course, ar  
range themselves under the will of the law,  
and unite in common efforts for the com­  
mon good. All, too, will bear in mind this  
sacred principle, that, though the will of  
the majority is in all cases to prevail, that  
will, to be rightful, must be reasonable;  
that the minority possess their equal rights,  
which equal laws must protect, and to vio  
late would be oppression. Let us, then, fel­  
low citizens, unite with one heart and one  
mind; let us restore to social intercourse  
that harmony and affection without which  
liberty and even life itself are but dreary  
things. And let us reflect, that, having  
banished from our land that religious in  
tolerance under which mankind so long  
bled and suffered, we have yet gained little,  
if we countenance a political intolerance as  
despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bit  
ter and bloody persecutions. During the  
throes and convulsions of the ancient world  
during the agonizing spasms of infuriated  
man, seeking, through blood and slaughter,  
his long-lost liberty, it w as not wonderful  
that the agitation of the billows should  
reach even this distant annd peaceful shore;  
that this should be more felt and feared by  
some, and less hy others, and should divide  
opinions as to measures of safety; butevery  
difference of opinion is not a difference of  
principle. We have called by different  
names brethren of the same principle. We  
are all Republicans;we are all Federalists.  
If there be any among us who would wish  
to dissolve this Union, or to changeits ke­  
publican form, let them stand, undisturbed,  
as monuments of the safety with which er  
ror of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is  
teft free to combatit. I know, indeed, that  
some honest men fear that a Republican  
Government cannot be strong--that thi  
Government is not strong enough. But  
would the honest patriot, in the full tide of  
suceessful experiment, abandon a Govern­  
ment which has so far kept us freeand firm  
on the theoretic and visionary fear that this  
Governmant, the world&#x27;s best hope, may,  
by possibility, want energy tolpreserve it  
self? I trust not. I believe this, on the  
contrary, the strongest Governmenton  
earth, I believe it the only one where  
every man, at the call of the law, would fly  
to the standard of the law, and would meet  
invasions of the public order as his own  
personal concern. Sometimes it is said that  
man cannot be trusted with the govern  
ment of himself. Can he then be trusted  
with the Government of others? Or have  
we found angels, in the form of kings, to  
govern him? Let history answer this ques  
tion.  
Let us, then, with courage and confidence,  
pursue our own federal and republican  
principles--our attachment to union and  
representative Government. Kindly sepa  
rated by nature and a wide ocean from the  
exterminating havoc of one quarter of the  
globe; too high-minded to endure the deg  
radations of others; possessing a chosen  
country, with room enough for our de  
scendants to the thousandth and thous  
andth generation; entertaining a due sense  
of our equal right to the use of our own fac  
ultles, to the acquisitions of our own indus  
try, to honor and confidence from our fels  
low citizens, resulting, not from birth, but  
from our actions, and their sense of them;  
enlightened by a benign religion, professed,  
indeed, and practiced, in various forms, yet  
all of them inculcating honesty, truth,  
temperance, gratitude, and the love of man;  
acknowledging and adoring an overruling  
Providence, which, by all its dispensations,  
proves that it delights in the happiness of  
man here, and his greater happiness here­  
after--with all these blessings, what more  
is necessary to make us a happy and prose  
perous people? Still one thing more, fel­  
low citizens: a wise and frugal Government,  
which shall restrain men from injuring one  
another, shall leave them otherwise free to  
regulate their own pursuits of industry and  
improvement, and shall not take from the  
mouthe of labor the bread it has earned.  
This is the sum of good government, and  
this is necessary to close the circle of our  
felicities. at on shyonq 41 utmag  
bout to enter fellow citizens, on theex

under the protection of the ha-  
beas corpus, and trial by juries impartially  
selected. These principles form the bright  
constellation which has gone before us, and  
guided our steps through an age of revolu  
tion and reformation. The wisdom of our  
sages and blood of our heroes have been  
devoted to their attainment. They should  
be the creed of our political faith, the text  
of civic instruction, the touch-stone by  
which to try the services of those we trust;  
and should we wander from them in mo  
ments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to  
retrace our steps, and to regain the road  
which alone leads to peace, liberty and  
safety.  
I repair, then, fellow citizens, to the post  
you have assigned me. With experience  
enough in subordinate offices to have seen  
the difficulties of this, the greatest of all,  
I have learnt to expect that it will rarely  
fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire  
from this station with the reputation and  
the favor which brought him into it. With­  
out pretentions to that high confidence you  
reposed in our first and greatest revolu­  
tionary character, whose pre-eminent ser­  
vices had entitled him to the first place in  
lis country&#x27;slove, and destined for him the  
lairest page in the volume of faithful his  
tory, I ask so much confidence only as may  
give frmness and effect to the legal admin  
istration of your affairs. I shall often go  
wrong, through defect of judgment. When  
right, I shall often be thought wrong by  
those whose positions will not command a  
view of the whole ground. I ask your in-  
dulgence for my own errors, which will  
never be intentional, and your support  
against the errors of others, who may con­  
demn what they would not if seen in all its  
parts. The approbation implied by your  
suffrage is a great consolation to me for the  
past; and my future solicitude will be, to  
retain the good opinion of those who have  
bestowed it in advance, to conciliate that of  
others by doing them all the good in my  
power, and to be instrumental to the hap­  
piness and freedom of all.  
Relying, then, on the patronage of your  
good will, I advance, with obedience to the  
work, ready to retire from it whenever you  
become sensible how much better choice it  
is in your power to make. And may that  
Infinite power which rules the destinies of  
the universe, lead our councils to what is  
best, and give them a favorable issue for  
your peace and prosperity

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

t, frequently allude to Mr. Jef­  
ferson as the great advocate of State  
rights and opponent of the exercise of su­  
preme power by the general government  
This question can be settled best by re­  
ferring to the printed works of this great  
and good man. He was first elected Pres­  
ident in 1800 and on the fourth of March,  
1801, took the oath of office and was in­  
augurated President of the United States.  
In the December following he transmitted  
his first message to the national Congress,  
and from that remarkable document we  
make the following extract for the benefit  
of Democrats of the present day:  
During the contest of opinion through  
which we have passed, the animation of  
discussions and of exertions has sometimes  
woru an aspect which might impose on  
strangers, unused to flunk freely, and to  
speak and to write what they ihink: but  
this being now decided by the voice of the  
nation, announced according to the rules of  
the constitution, all will, of course, arrange  
themselves under the will of the law, and  
uuito in common efforts for the common  
ood. All, too, will hear in mind this sacred  
principle, that though the will of toe major­  
ity is, in all cases, to prevail, that will, to be  
rightful, must he reasonable—that the min­  
ority possess their equal rights, which equal  
laws must protect, and to violate would he  
oppression. Let us, then, fellow citizens,  
unite with one heart aud one mind. Let  
us restore to social intercourse that har­  
mony and affection without which liberty,  
and even life itself, are but dreary things;  
and let us reflect, that, having banished  
from our land that religious intolerance un  
der which mankind so Ioug hied aud suf­  
fered, we have yet gained little, if we coun­  
tenance a political intolerance, as despotic,  
as wicked, and capable of as bitter and  
bloody persecutions.  
During the throes and convulsions of the  
ancient world; during the agonizing spasms  
of infuriated man, soekiug through blood  
and slaughter his long lost liberty, it was  
not wonderful that the agitation of the bil­  
lows should reach even this distant and  
peaceful shore; that this should be quore  
felt and feared by some and less by others,  
and ahoula divide opinions as to measures  
of safety. But every difference of opinion  
is not difference of principle. We Lave  
called by different names brethren of the  
same principle. We are all Republicans,  
we are all Federalists. If there he any  
among us who would wish to dissolve this  
Union, or to change its republican form, let  
them stand undisturbed as monuments ot  
the safety wirh which error of opinion may  
be tolerated, where reason is left free to  
combat it. I know, indeed, that some hon­  
est men fear that a Republican government  
can not bo strong—that this government  
is not strong enough. But would the honest  
patriot, in the full tide of successful experi­  
ment, abandon a government which has so  
far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic  
and visionary fear that this government,  
the world&#x27;s Itest hope, may, by possibility,  
want energy to preserve itself! I trust not.  
I believe this, ou the contrary, the strongest  
government on the earth. I believe it the  
only one where every man. at the call of the  
law, would fly to the standard of the law,  
and would meet invasions of the public  
order as his own personal concern. Some­  
times it is said that man can not be truste i  
with the government of himself. Can he  
then be trusted with the government of  
others, or have we found angels in the form  
of kings to govern him? Let history answer  
this question.

lights in the liappmess^if man here, and  
his greater happiness hereafter—with  
all these blessings, what more is  
necessary to make us a happy  
and prosperous people? Still one thing  
more. A wise and frugal government,  
which shall restrain men from injuring  
one another, shall leave them otherwise  
free to regulate their own pursuits of in­  
dustry and improvement, and shall not  
take from the mouth of labor the bread he  
has earned. This is the sum of good gov­  
ernment, and this is nocessary to close the  
circle of our felicities.

“Every difference of opinion is not  
a difference of principle. We have  
called by different names brethren  
of the same principle. We are all  
Republicans, — we are all Federalists.  
If there be any among us who would  
wish to dissolve this Union, or to  
change its republican form, let them  
stand undisturbed as monuments of  
the safety with which error of opinion  
may be tolerated where reason is left  
free to combat it. I know, indeed, that  
some honest men fear that a Republi-  
can government cannot be strong ;  
that this government is not strong  
enough. But would the honest patriot,  
in the full tide of successful experiment,  
abandon a government which has so  
far kept us free and firm, on the theo-  
retic and visionary fear that this gov-  
ernment, the world’s best hope, may  
by possibility want energy to preserve  
itself? I trust not. I believe this, on  
the contrary, the strongest on earth. I  
believe it the only one where every man,  
at the call of the laws, would fly to the  
standard of the law, and would meet  
invasions of the public order as his  
own personal concern.”  
  
In 1801, this was “theory.” In  
1861, it was fact.  
  
Happy, indeed, was the change  
which that day came over the aspect  
of American polittcs. No longer was  
the spectacle exhibited of the govern-  
ment pulling one way and the people  
another. The people of the United  
States ruled the United States, and

merce with nations who feel power and forget  
right, advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the  
reach of mortal eye; when 1 contemplate these  
transcendent obj tots, and see the honor, the hap­  
piness, and the hopes of this beloved country  
committed to the Issue and the auspices of this  
day, I shrink from tbe contemplation, and bum­  
ble myself before the magnitude of the uudertak.  
lug. Utterly Indeed should I despair, did not the  
presence of many whom I bete see remind me  
that, in the other high authorities provid.d by  
our constitution, I staal find resources or wisdom,  
of virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely under all  
difficulties. To you then, gentlemen, who are  
charged wit b the sovereign functions of legisla­  
tion, and to those ata clatod with you, I look with  
encouragement for that guidance and support  
which may enable us to steer with safety tbe ves  
eel in wh eh we are all embark c amid the con­  
flicting elements of a troubled orld.  
During the contest of opinl in through whlcb  
we have just passed, the ani iatlon of discussion  
and exertion has sometimes worn an aspect  
which might impose on strangers unused to  
tbluk freely, and to speak and to write what they  
think; but this being now decided by the voice o&#x27;  
the nation, announced according to the rules of  
the constitution, all will of cours; arrange them­  
selves under the will of the law, and unite In  
common efforts for the common good. All loo  
will b ar in mind this sacred principle, that  
though the will of the majority is In all cases to  
prevail, tint will, to bo rightful, mint be reason  
able; that the minority possesses their equal rights  
whlcb equal law must protect, and to fvlolate  
would be oppression. Let us then, fellow cltlz . us  
unite with one heart aud one mlud; I t us restore  
to social intercourse th it harmony aul affection  
without which liberty, aud even life Itself, are  
but dresry things. And let us rtfl ct, that, hav  
lng banished from our mintfs that religious lnt 1­  
crance under which mankind so long bled and  
Buffered, we have yet gain.&#x27;d little, If we counte­  
nancea political intolerance as despotic, as wick,  
ed, and capable of as bittsr and bloody persecu  
tlons, During the throes and convulsions of tbe  
ancient world, during the agonizing spasms of  
infuriated man, seeking through blood and slaugh  
ter bis long lost liberty, it was not wonderful that  
the agitation of the billows should reach even  
this distant and peaceful shore: that this should  
be moro felt and feared by some, and less by oth  
ers; thai this should divide opinions as to measures  
of safety: but every difference of opinion Is not a  
difference of principle. We have called by differ  
ent names brethren of the same principle. We  
are all republicans; we are all federallits. If  
there b; any among us who would wish tod is-  
solve this Union, or to change its republlcan;form  
let them st .nd undisturbed, as monuments of the  
safety with which error of opinion may be tolerat  
ed, where reason Is left free to combat it. I know  
Indeed that tome honest meu fear that a republl  
can governmant cannot bo trong; that this Gov  
eminent is not strong enough. Bit would Jthe  
honest patriot, In the full tide of successful ex  
perimeut, abandon a government which so far  
bas kept us free aud firm, on tbe theoretin and  
visionary fear that this Govern ent, the world&#x27;s  
best hope, may, by possibility, want energy to  
preserve Itself? I tru-t not. I believe this, on  
tbe contrary, the strongest government on earth.  
I believe It the only one where every man, at the  
call of the laws, would fly to the standard of the  
law, and would meet Invasions of the public or­  
der as his own personal concern. Bometimes it  
Is said that man caunot he trusted with the g v  
ernment of himself. Can he then be trusted with  
the governmoii&#x27; of others; or have we found  
ang Is In the forms of klngt to govern him ? Let  
history answer this qne-t&#x27;on.  
Let us then, with courage and confidence, pur­  
sue our federal and republican prlnclol s. our  
attachment to our Union and representative  
Government. Kindly separated by nature and an  
ocean from the exterminating havoc of one  
quarter nf the globe; too high minded toendtiie  
the degradations of the others; possessing a  
chosen country, with room euo igh for our de  
acendants to the thousandth andthousindth g it­

happiness of man here, and his greater happiness  
hereafl&#x27;r; with all these bus lugs, what morels  
necessary to make us a happy and prosperous

men from Injuring one another, shall leave them  
otherwise fn-e to regulate their own pursuit of  
industry and improvement and shall not take

Tols Is the sum of good government, and this is  
necessary to close the circle of our facilities.

Called upon to undertake the duties of the  
first executive office of our country, I avail  
myself of the presence of that portion of my  
fellow citizens which is here assembled to ex­  
press my grateful thanks for the favor with  
which they have beon pleased to look toward  
me, to declare a sincere consciousness that the  
task is above my talents, and that I approach  
it with those anxious and awful presentiments  
which the greatness of the change and the  
weakness of my powers so justly inspire. A ris  
ing nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land  
traversing all the seas with the rich produc  
tions of their industre, engaged in commerce  
with nations who feel power and forget right  
advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach  
of mortal eye--when I contemplate these  
transcendent objects, and see the honor, the  
happiness, and the hopes of this beloved coun­  
try committed to the issue and the auspices of  
this day, I shrink from the contemplation, and  
humble myself before the magnitude of the un  
dertaking. Utterly, indeed, should I despair  
did not the presence of many whom I here see  
remind me that in the other high authorities  
provided by our Constitution I shall find re  
sources of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal, on  
which to raly under all difficulties. To you  
then, gentiemen, who are charged with the  
sovereign functions of legislation, and to those  
associated with you, I look with encouragement  
for that guldance and support which may en  
able us to steer with safety the vessel in which  
we are all embarked amid the conflicting ele  
ments of a troubled world. &quot; I repair  
then, fellow citizens, to the post you have as  
signed me. With experience enough in subor  
dinate offices to have seen the difficulties of  
this, the greatest of all. I have learned to expect  
that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect  
man to retire from this station with the reputa  
tion and the favor which bring him into it. With  
out pretensions to that high confidence reposed  
in our first and great Revolutionary character  
whose preciminent services had entitled him  
to the firs; place th his country&#x27;s love, and des  
tined for him the fairest page in the volume of  
faithful history, I ask so much confidence only  
as may give firmness and effoct to the legal ad  
  
ministration of your affairs. I shall often go  
wrong through defect of judgment. When  
right, I shall often be thought wrong by those  
whose positions will not command a view of  
the whole ground. I ask your indulgence for  
my errors, which will never be intentionat; and  
your support against the errors of others, who  
may condemn what they woulf not if sean in all  
Its parts. The apnrobation implied by your  
suffrage is a consolation to me for the past  
and my future solicitude will be to retain the  
good opinion of those who have bestowed it in  
advance, to conciliate that of others by doing  
them all the good in my power, and to be instru  
mental to the happiness and freedom of all  
Relying, then, on the patronage of your good  
will, I advance with obedience to the work  
ready to retire from it whenever you become  
sensible how much better choice it is in your  
power to make

d even boldly proclaimed during the  
last canvass that the Republicans would  
not permit the transfer of the Govern­  
ment to the Democratic party, and that  
they would use their intrenched power  
to prevent Cleveland&#x27;s inauguration. But  
the people were not frightened from  
their duty and the exercise of the right  
of freemen. Cleveland was elected and  
inaugurated, and many of those who were  
conspicuous in opposing his election were  
most conspicuious in the ceremonies of  
transferring the Government by constitu­  
tional methods. Jefferson, in his first in­  
augural address, delivered March 4, 1801,  
aid:  
Let us then, fellow-citizens, unite with one  
heart and one mind Let us restore to social in  
that harmony and affection without  
which liberty and even life itself are but dreary  
things. And let us reflect that, having hanished  
rom our land that religious intoferance under  
which mankind so long bled and suffered, we  
have set gained little if we countenance a politi  
intolerance as despotic, as wicked and capa­  
ble of as bitter and bloody persecutions. During  
the throes and convulsions of the ancient world,  
iuring the agonizing spasms of infuriated man,  
seeking through blood and slaughter his long-lost  
liberty, if was not wonderful that the agitation  
of the billows should reach even this distant and  
peaceful shore; that this should be more felt than  
feared by some and less by others; that this  
should divide opinions as to measures of safety.  
But every difference of opinion is not a  
difference of principle. We have called by  
different names brethren of the same prin  
ciple. We are all Rtepublicans, we are all Fed­  
eralists. If there be any among us who would  
wish to dissolve this Union, or to change its re-  
publican form, let them stand undisturbed as  
monuments of the safety with which error of  
opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free  
to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest  
men fear that a republican Government cannot be  
strong; that this Government is not strong  
enough. But would the honest patriot, in the  
full tide of successful experiment, abandon a  
government which has so far kept us free and  
irm, on the theoretic and visionary fear that this  
government, the world&#x27;s best hope, may by possi  
bility want energy to preserve itself? I trust not  
I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest goy  
eernment on earth.  
In constructing these sentences Jeffer.  
son builded better than he knew, for if  
he thought eighty-four years ago when  
the experiment of the republic was un  
tried, we had &quot;the strongest government  
on earth,&quot; how much stronger would  
be his faith if he could have seen and  
known its triumph over the perils which  
would have wrecked any other nation on  
the face of the globe. The patriotism  
manifested by the American people in  
transferring three weeks ago the govern  
ment from one party to another, shows  
that as the broken bone when properly  
set is stronger than before, so h

mild and sufe corrective of abuses, whioh  
are lopped by the sword of revolution,  
where peaceable remedies are unprovided,  
absolute acquiescence in the decisions of  
the majority, the vital principle of repub­

the vital principle and immediate parent of  
despotism; a well disciplined militia, our  
best reliance in peace, aud for the first mo­

Presidential election. It runsas follows: &quot;Dur­  
ing the contest of opinion through which  
we have passed, the animation of discussion and  
of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect  
which might impose on strangers unused to  
think freely and to speak and to write what  
they think; but this contest being now decided  
by the voice of the nation, and announced ac­  
cording to the rules of the Constitution, all will,  
of course, arrange themselves under the will of  
the law, and unite in common efforts for the  
common good. All, too, will bear in mind  
this sacred principle, that though the will  
of the majority is in all cases to prevail,  
that will to be rightful must be reasonable;  
that the minority possess their equal rights,  
which equal law must protect, and to vio­  
late which would be oppression. Let us then;  
fellow citizens, unite with one heart and  
one mind. Let us restore to social inter­  
course that harmony and affection with­  
out which liberty and even life itself are  
but dreary things. And let us reflect that, hav­  
ing bamished from our land that religious in­  
tolerance under which mankind so long bled  
and suffered, we have yet gained little if we  
countenance a political intolerance as despotic,  
as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody  
persecutions. During the throes and convul­  
sions of the ancient world, during the agon­  
izing spasms of infuriated man, seeking  
through blood and slaughter his long-lost  
liberty, it was not wonderful that the  
agitation of the billows should reach even  
this distant and peaceful shore; that this should  
be more felt and feared by some and less by  
others, and should divide opinions as to meas­  
ures of safety. But every difference of opinion  
is not a difference of principle. We have called  
by different names brethren of the same prin­  
ciple. We are all Republicans, we are all Federal­  
ists. If there be any among us who would wish  
to dissolve this Union or to change its repub­  
lican form, let them stand undisturbed as monu­  
ments of the safety with which error of opinion  
may be tolerated where reason is left free to  
combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest  
men fear that a republican Government cannot  
be strong, that this Government is not strong  
enough; but would the honest patriot, in  
the full tide of successful experiment,  
abandon a Government which has so far  
kept us free and firm on the theoretio  
and visionary fear that this Government, the  
world&#x27;s beat hope, may by possibility want en­  
ergy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe  
this, on the contrary, the strongest Government  
on earth. I believe it the only one where every  
man, at the call of the law, would fly to the  
standard of the law, and would meet invasions  
of the public order as his own personal concern.  
Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted  
with the Government of himself. Can he, then,  
be trusted with the Government of others? Or  
have we found angels in the form of kings to  
govern him? Let history answer this question.&quot;

people? Still one thing more, fellow

ment, which shall restrain men from  
Injuring one another, shall leave them  
otherwise free to regulate their own  
pursuits of industry and improvement,

comprehend everything dear and val­  
uable to you, it is proper you should

consequently those which ought to  
shape its administration. I will com­  
press them within the narrowest com­  
pass they will bear, stating the general  
principle, but not all Its limitations.  
&quot;Equal and exact justice to all men,  
of whatever station or persausion, re­  
ligious or political; peace, commerce  
and honest friendship with all nations,  
entangling alliances with none; the  
support of the state governments in  
all their rights, as the most compe­  
tent administrations for our domestic  
concerns and the surest bulwarks  
against anti-republican tendencies;  
the preservation of the general gov­  
ernment ln its whole constitutional  
vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace  
Bit home and safety abroad; a jealous  
care of the right of election by the  
people—a mild and safe corrective of  
abuses which are lopped off by thc­

the vital principle and Immediate par­

of the civil over military authority;  
economy in public expense that labor  
may be lightly burthened; the honest  
payment of our debts and sacred pres­

but he thought that their permanent supremacy might be rendered  
certain if he could attract to his standard Federalists of the milder
