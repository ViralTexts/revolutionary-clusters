about within it.” Amber was worn as an  
amulet by children; it was a specific against  
insanity, and generally was supposed a great  
help to the physician. Worn round the neck  
it cured the ague ; ground up with honey and  
rose oil it was a specific for deafness, and  
with Attic honey for dimness of sight. The  
allusions to the colour of amber have been  
numerous, from the hue of Poppza’s hair to  
the tint of Bass’s pale ale. Amber was highly  
popular as an ornament in England during  
the last century, particularly that which en-  
tombed some foreign body, as Pope writes :

became a Government, it would be diffi¬  
cult to tell. Like flies in amber, one  
wondered how the devil they got  
there.” Pope, the originator of the  
phrase, had not mentioned flies :  
  
Pretty ! in amber to observe the forms  
Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grabs, or worms I  
The things we know are neither rich nor rare,  
But wonder how the devil they got there.
