Braintree October 20. 1783  
  
To you my young Friend upon whom the parential ties are strong and unbroken; who never yet knew the agonies which attend the loss of a fond Mother; or the pangs which rend the filial Heart Bereaved of a dear and venerable Father, to You I say, may Heaven long continue those blessings, nor teach you, experimentally to Sympathize with your afflicted Friend.  
My dear parent is no more! His illness was Short and accute, his patience resignation and Submission, exemplary.  
  
“His conduct was a legacy for all  
Richer than Mammons for his single heir  
His comforters, he comforts; great in ruin  
With unreluctant Grandeur, gives, not yealds  
His soul sublime.”  
  
Few persons enjoyed so rigorous an old age, few persons of his age are so universally regreted.  
  
“Virtuous and wise he was, but not Severe  
He still rememberd, that he once was young  
His easy presence checked no decent joy  
Him even the dissolute admired; for he  
A Gracefull loosness, when he pleasd put on  
And laughing would instruct.”  
  
Even in his last hours, he retaind that Cheerfullness which had distinguishd him through his Life. I never before past through so painfull and yet so instructive a Scene, I reflect upon the last fortnight of his Life with a melancholy satisfaction and pleasure.  
  
  
“Sweet peace and Heavenly hope, and humble joy  
Divinely beamd on his exalted Soul.”  
  
I will not ask an excuse for thus dwelling upon the memory

“ ¢Though old, he still retained  
His manly sense, and energy of mind.  
Virtuous and wise he was, but not severe;  
He still remembered that he once was young;  
His easy presence checked no decent joy;  
Him even the desolate admired; for he

s anticipation is the zest of  
life, it is this knowledge which nerves  
his arm and upholds and gladdens his  
heart. When a( length the Saturday does  
come, what, I ask, can be lovelier than  
the spectacle of the toiler reaching his  
home, whence, until the Monday arrive,  
he need not (save for worship) issue?  
Surrounded by his dependent little  
brood, as he places his hard-earned  
weekly wage in the hand of the happy  
mother, sweet is her approving smile—  
sweeter still the grateful impulse of  
those leal and loving lips! At that  
moment, toiler though he be, it is not  
too much to apply to him the lines —  
Sweet peace and heavenly hope and humble  
joy Divinely beam on his exalted soul
