y regiment gives the Guards and the Jersey battalion the fatigues tomorrow.  
The Commander in Chief orders the Cessation of Hostilities between the United States of America and the King of Great Britain to be publickly proclaimed tomorrow at 12 o’clock at the New building, and that the Proclamation which will be communicated  
herewith, be read tomorrow evening at the head of every regiment &amp; corps of the army—After which the Chaplains with the several Brigades will render thanks to almighty God for all his mercies, particularly for his over ruling the wrath of man to his own glory, and causing  
the rage of war to cease amongst the nations.  
Altho the Proclamation before alluded to, intends only to the prohibition of hostilities and not to the annunciation of a general peace, yet it must afford the most rational and sincere satisfaction to every benevolent mind—as it puts a period to a long and  
doubtful contest, stops the effusion of human blood, opens the prospect to a more splended scene, and like another morning star, promises the approach of a brighter day than hath hitherto illuminated the Western Hemisphere—on such a happy day, a day which is the harbinger of  
Peace, a day which compleats the eighth year of the war, it would be ingratitude not to rejoice—it would be insensibility not to participate in the general felicity.  
The Commander in Chief far from endeavouring to stifle the feelings of Joy in his own bosom, offers his most cordial Congratulations on the occasion to all the Officers of every denomination, to all the Troops of the United States in General, and in  
particular to those gallant and persevering men who had resolved to defend the rights of their invaded country so long as the war should continue—For these are the men who ought to be considered as the pride and boast of the American Army; And, who crowned with well earned  
laurels, may soon withdraw from the field of Glory, to the more tranquil walks of civil life.  
While the General recollects the almost infinite variety of Scenes thro which we have passed, with a mixture of pleasure, astonishment, and gratitude; while he contemplates the prospects before us with rapture; he can not help wishing that all the brave men  
(of whatever condition they may be) who have shared in the toils and dangers of effecting this glorious revolution, of rescuing Millions from the hand of oppression, and of laying the foundation of a great Empire, might be impressed with a proper idea of the dignifyed part  
they have been called to act (under the Smiles of providence) on the stage of human affairs: for, happy, thrice happy shall they be pronounced hereafter, who have contributed any thing, who have performed the meanest office in creating this steubendous fabrick of Freedom and Empire on the broad basis of Indipendency; who have assisted in protesting the rights of humane nature and establishing an Asylum for the poor and oppressed of all nations of religions. The  
glorius task for which we first flew to Arms being thus accomplished the liberties of our Country being fully acknowledged, and firmly secured by the smiles of heaven, on the purity of our cause, and the honest exertions of a feeble people (determined to be free) against a  
powerfull Nation (disposed to oppress them) and the Character of those who have persevered, through every extremity of hardship; suffering and danger being immortalized by the illustrious appellation of the patriot Army—Nothing more remains but  
for the actors of this mighty Scene to preserve a perfect unvarying consistency of character through the very last act; to close the Drama with applause; and to retire from the Military Theatre with the same approbation of Angells and men which have crowned all their former  
virtuous Actions. For this purpose no disorder or licentiousness must be tolerated—every considerate and well disposed soldier must remember it will be absolutely necessary to wait with patience untill peace shall be declared or Congress shall be enabled to take proper  
measures for the security of the public stores &amp;ca—as soon as these Arrangements shall be made the General is confident there will be no delay in discharging with every mark of distinction &amp; honor all the men enlisted for the war who will then have faithfully  
performed their engagements with the public. The General has already interested himself in their behalf; and he thinks he need not repeat the assurances of his disposition to be useful to them on the present, and every other proper occasion. In the mean time he is determined  
that no Military neglects or excesses shall go unpunished while he retains the command of the Army.  
The Adjutant General will have such working parties detailed to assist in making the preparations for a general rejoycing as the Chief Engineer with the Army shall call for—and the Quarter Master Genl will without delay procure such a number of Discharges  
to be printed as will be sufficient for all the men enlisted for the War; he will please to apply to the Head Quarters for the form.  
An extra ration of liquor to be issued to every man tomorrow, to drink Perpetual Peace, Independence &amp; Happiness to the United States of America.

THE Commander in Chicef orders the  
_ceffation of bofiilities between the Uni­  
ted States of America, and the King of Great  
Britain, to be publicly proclaimed to- mot=&lt;  
sow at 12 o&#x27;clock, at the New-Building,and  
that rhe proclamationwhich will be commus«  
ficated herewith, be read to-morrow everi­

©of the army ; after which the chaplains  
with the several brigades will render thagks  
to Almighiy God tor all his mercies, parti­  
cularly tor his over-ruling the wrath of man  
to his own glory, and causing the rage of  
war to cease among the nations.  
Although the prociamation before alluded  
to, extends to the prohibition ot hoftiliees,  
and not to the annunciation oof a general  
peace ; yet it must afford the most rarional  
latisfaétion to every bensvolent mind—as  
it puis 2 period to &amp; long and doubtiul con­  
tell ; stops the effufion of human blood,opens  
the profpeét ot a more splendid scene, and  
like another morning fiar, promises the ap­  
proach of a brighter day than hath hitherto  
illuminated the western kemifphere ; on such  
a happy day, a day which is the barbinger  
of peace, a day which compleats the eighth  
year of the war 5 it would be ingratitude not  
to rejoice,it would be insensibility not to par­  
ticipate in the generzl felicity.~The Com­  
mander in Chief, far from endeavowing to  
flifle the feelings of joy in his own bosom,  
offers his most cordial congratulations on the  
cccafion, to all officers of every denomina­  
tion, toall the troops of the United States  
in general ; and in particular to thoie gal­  
lant and persevering mea who had resolved  
to defend the rightsof their invaded country,  
{c long asthe war shall continues=for these  
are the men who ought to be confidered,as  
the pride and bozft to the American army,  
and wio crowned with well earned laurels,  
may {ocon withdraw from the field of glory  
to the more tranquil waiks of civil life.  
Whiie the General recollets the almost  
nfinite variety of scenes through which we  
kave passed, with a 2 mixture of pleasure, af­  
tonithment and gratitude ; while be contem -  
plates the prospect before us with rapture,he  
cannot help withing that all the brave men  
(of whatever condition they may be) who  
have shared in the toiis, and dangers of af­  
fefting this gloricus revolution ; of rescuing  
millions from the hand of oppression, and of  
laying the fcundation of a great empire,  
night be imprefled with 2 proper idea of  
the dignificd part they have been called to  
26t (under the smiles of Providence) oi: the  
flage of human affairs ; for happy, thrice  
happy shall they be proncunced hereafter,  
wiio have cantributed any thing, who have  
perfotmed the meanest office in erelting the  
fiupendous fabrickot freedom and empire,on  
the broad basis of independency—whe have  
assisted in protelting the rights of human na­  
ture, and eftablithing an afylom fer the poor  
and opprefled of all nations and religions.  
The glorious task for which we firt flew  
to arms being thus accomplithed, the liber­  
ties of our country being fully acknowledged  
andfirmly secured by the smiles of Meaven on  
the purity of our cause, and the honest exer­  
tions of a fecbie people (determined to.be

epbrefs them) and the charwfier of those  
who Bave persevered through every extre­

close the drama with 2pplaufe, and to retire  
from the military theatre with the fame  
zppmb’zt&#x27;ﬁea of angels and men, which have  
crowned z!l their former virtuous aétions,  
For this purpofe,no dWorder or licention{-

CHATHAM, April 23.  
Head-Quarters, April 18, 1783.  
  
She E Commander in Chief orders the  
ceflation of hoftilities between the  
United States of America and the King  
of Great Britain to be publicly pro-  
claimed to-morrow at twelve o&#x27;clock, at  
the new building; and that the procla-  
mation which will be communicated here-  
with be read to-morrow evening at the  
head of every regiment and corps of the  
army ; after which the Chaplains, with  
the feveral brigades, wil] render thanks to  
Almighty God for all his mercies, parti-  
cularly for over-ruling the wrath ef man  
  
to his. own glory, and caufing the rage of  
war to.ceafe among the nations.  
  
Although the Proclamation before al--  
luded to extends only to the prohibition  
of hoftilities, and not to the annunciation  
of a general peace, yet it mutt afford the  
moft rational and fincere fatisfattion to  
every benevolent mind, as it puts a pe-  
riod to a long and doubtful conteft, ftops  
the effufion of human blood, opens the  
profpect to a more fplendid fcene, and,  
like another morning ftar, promifes the  
approach of a brighter day than hath  
hitherto illuminated the Weitern hemif-  
phere. On fuch a happy day, which is  
the harbinger of peace, a day which com-  
pletes the eighth year of .the war, it  
would be ingratitude not to rejoice; it  
would be infenfibility not to participate  
in the general felicity.

his own bolom, offers his moft ccrdial

The Commander-in-Chief orders the cessation  
of hostilities between the United States of America  
and the King of Great Britain to be publicly  
proclaimed to-morrow at 12 o’clock at the new  
building, and that the proclamation which will  
be communicated herewith be read to-morrow  
evening at the head of every regiment and corps  
ofthe army. After which the Chaplains with the  
several brigades will render thanks to Almighty  
God for all his mercies, particularly for his over-  
ruling the wrath of man to his own glory, and  
causing the rage of war to cease amongst the  
nations.  
  
Although the proclamation before alluded to  
extends only to the prohibition of hostilities, and  
not to the annunciation of a general peace, yet it  
must afford the most rational and sincere satisfac-  
tion to every benevolent mind, as it puts a period  
to a long and doubtful contest ; stops the effusion  
of human blood; opens the prospect to a more  
splendid scene, and, like another morning star,  
promises the appruach of a brighter day than hath  
hitherto illuminated the Western hemisphere. On  
such a happy day—a day which is the harbinger  
of peace—a day which completes the eighth year  
of the war,’ it would be ingratitude not to rejoice!  
it would be insensibility not to participate in the  
general felicity !  
  
The Commander-in-Chief, far from endeavoring  
to stifle the feelings of joy in his own bosom,  
offers his most cordial congratulations on the  
occasion to all the officers of every denomination,  
to all the troops of the United States in general,  
and, in particular, to those gallant and persevering  
men who had resolved to defend the rights of  
their invaded country so long as the war should  
continue.’ For these are the men who ought to  
be considered as the pride and boast of the  
American Army; and who, crowned with well-  
earned laurels, may soon withdraw from the field  
of glory to the more tranquil walks of civil life.

While the General recollects the almost infinite  
variety of scenes through which we have passed,  
with a mixture of pleasure, astonishment and  
gratitude; while he contemplates the prospect  
before us with rapture; he cannot. help wishing  
that all the brave men (of whatever condition  
they may be) who have shared in the toils and  
dangers of effecting this glorious revolution, of  
rescuing millions from the hand of oppression,  
and of laying the foundation of a great Empire,  
might be impressed with a proper idea of the  
dignified part they have been called to act (under  
the smiles of Providence) on the stage of human  
affairs; for happy, thrice happy, shall they be  
pronounced hereafter who have contributed any-  
thing, who have performed the meanest office in  
erecting this stupendous fabric of Freedom and  
Empire on the broad basis of independency ;  
who have assisted in protecting the rights of  
human nature and establishing an asylum for the  
poor and oppressed of all nations and religions.  
  
The glorious task for which we first flew to  
arms being thus accomplished, the liberties of our  
country being fully acknowledged and firmly  
secured by the smiles of heaven on the purity of  
our cause and the honest exertions of a feeble  
people (determined to be free) against a powerful  
nation (disposed to oppress them), and the charac-  
ter of those who have persevered through every ex-  
tremity of hardship, suffering and danger, being  
immortalized by the illustrious appellation of the  
Patriot Army—nothing more remains but for the  
actors of this mighty scene to preserve a perfect,  
unvarying constancy of character through the very  
last act; to close the drama with applause; and  
to retire from the military theatre with the same  
approbation of angels and men which have crowned  
all their former virtuous actions.  
  
For this purpose no disorder or licentiousness  
must be tolerated—every considerate and well-  
disposed soldier must remember it will be ab-  
solutely necessary to wait with patience until peace  
shail be declared, or Congress shall be enabled  
to take proper measures for the security of the  
public stores, &amp;c. As soon as these arrangements  
shall be made, the General is confident there will  
be no delay in discharging with every mark of  
distinction and honor all the men enlisted for  
the war, who will have then faithfully performed  
their engagements with the public. The General  
has already interested himself in their behalf; and

he thinks he need not repeat the assurances of his  
disposition to be useful to them on the present  
and every other proper occasion. In the mean-  
  
time he is determined that no military neglects o?  
excesses shall go unpunished while he retains the  
command of the army.’  
  
1 Washington now had a task to perform which required  
great wisdom, judgment and discretion, He had lately sup-  
pressed a rising mutiny in the army at Newburgh, excited by  
the injudicious addresses of an aide-de-camp of General  
Gates, and had in a measure restored contentment in the  
army by promises of justice. Now rumofs of peace had  
excited expectations in the army of a spcedy discharge from  
the service, an act that would be especiaily acceptable to  
those who had enlisted “for the war.” So deeply had tha
