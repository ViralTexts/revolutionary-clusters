letters always do, a treat on matters public, individual and oeconomical. I am impatient to learn your sentiments on the late troubles in the Eastern states. So far as I have yet seen, they do not appear to threaten serious consequences. Those states have suffered by the stoppage of the channels of their commerce, which have not yet found other issues. This must render money scarce, and make the people uneasy. This uneasiness has produced acts absolutely unjustifiable: but I hope they will provoke no severities from their governments. A consciousness of those in power that their administration of the public affairs has been honest, may perhaps produce too great a degree of indignation: and those characters wherein fear predominates over hope may apprehend too much from these instances of irregularity. They may conclude too hastily that nature has formed man insusceptible of any other government but that of force, a conclusion not founded in truth, nor experience. Societies exist under three forms sufficiently distinguishable. 1. Without government, as among our Indians. 2. Under governments wherein the will of every one has a just influence, as is the case in England in a slight degree, and in our states in a great one. 3. Under governments of force: as is the case in all other monarchies and in  most of the other republics. To have an idea of the curse of existence under these last, they must be seen. It is a government of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not clear in my mind, that the 1st. condition is not the best. But I believe it to be inconsistent with any great degree of population. The second state has a great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has it’s evils too: the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject. But weigh this against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing. Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem. Even this evil is productive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and nourishes a general attention to the public affairs. I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical. Unsuccesful rebellions indeed generally establish the incroachments on the rights of the people which have produced them. An observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as not to discourage them too much. It is a medecine necessary for the sound health of government. If these transactions give me no un

 inhabit that country. And I will venture to say that the act which abandons the navigation of the Missisipi is an act of separation between the Eastern and Western country. It is a relinquishment of five parts out of eight of the territory of the United States, an abandonment of the fairest subject for the paiment of our public debts, and the chaining those debts on our own necks in perpetuum. I have the utmost confidence in the honest intentions of those who concur in this measure; but I lament their want of acquaintance with the character and physical advantages of the people who, right or wrong, will suppose their interests sacrificed on this occasion to the contrary inter

 in America.—As you are now returned into Congress it will become of importance that you should form a just estimate of certain public characters; on which therefore I will give you such notes as my knowlege of them has furnished me with. You will compare them with the materials you are otherwise possessed of, and decide on a view of the whole. You know the opinion I formerly entertained of my friend Mr. Adams. Yourself and the governor were the first who shook that opinion. I afterwards saw proofs which convicted him of a degree of vanity, and of a blindness to it, of which no germ had appeared in Congress. A 7-months’ intimacy with him here and as many weeks in London have given me opportunities of studying him closely. He is vain, irritable and a bad calculator of the force and probable effect of the motives which govern men. This is all the ill which can possibly be said of him. He is as disinterested as the being which made him: he is profound in his views: and accurate in his judgment except where knowledge of the world is necessary to form a  judgment. He is so amiable, that I pronounce you will love him if ever you become acquainted with him. He would be, as he was, a great man in Congress. Mr. Carmichael is I think very little known in America. I never saw him and while I was in Congress I formed rather a disadvantageous idea of him. His letters, received then, shewed him vain and more attentive to ceremony and etiquette than we suppose men of sense should be. I have now a constant correspondence with him, and find him a little hypocondriac and discontented. He possesses very good understanding tho’ not of the first order. I have had great opportunities of searching into his character and have availed myself of it. Many persons of different nations coming from Madrid to Paris all speak of him as in high esteem and I think it certain that he has more of the Count de Florid. B’s friendship than any diplomatic character at that court. As long as this minister is in office Carmichael can do more than any other person who could be sent there. You will see Franks and doubtless he will be asking some appointment. I wish there may be any one for which he is fit. He is light, indiscreet, [act]ive, honest, affectionate. Tho’ Bingham is not in diplomatic office yet as he wishes to be so I will mention such circumstances of him as you might otherwise be deceived in. He will make you believe he was on the most intimate footing with the first characters in Europe and versed in the secrets of every cabinet. Not a word of this is true. He had a rage for being presented to great men and had no modesty in the methods by which he could effect it. If he obtained access afterwards, it was with such as who were susceptible of impression from the beauty of his wife. I must except the Marquis de Bouilli who had been an old acquaintance. The Marquis de Lafayette is a most valuable auxiliary to me. His zeal is unbounded, and his we[ight] with those in power great. His education having been merely military, commerce was an unknown feild to him. But his good sense enabling him to comprehend perfectly whatever is explained to him, his agency has been very efficacious. He has a great deal of sound genius, is well remarked by the king and rising in popularity. He has nothing against him but the suspicion of republican principles. I think he will one day be of the ministry. His foible is a canine appetite for popularity and fame. But he will get above this. The Count de Vergennes is ill. The possibility of his recovery renders it dangerous for us to express a doubt but he is in danger. He is a great Minister in European affairs but has very imperfect ideas of ours [and] no confidence in them. His devotion to the principles of pure despotism render him unaffectionate to  our governments but his fear of England makes him value us as a make weight. He is cool, reserved in political conversation, free and familiar on other subjects, and a very attentive, aggreeable person to do business with. It is impossible to have a clearer, better organised head but age has chilled his heart. Nothing should be spared on our part to attach this country to us. It is the only one on which we can rely for support under every event. It’s inhabitants love us more I think than they do any other nation on earth. This is very much the effect of the good dispositions with which the French officers returned. In a former letter I mentioned to you the d

“Mr. Carmichael is, I think, very lit  
tie known in America I never saw bim;  
and while 1 was in congress I formed  
rather a disadvantageous idea of him.—  
Mis letters received therei shewed him

cessor in the Presidentship, dated 30th  
Jan., IT.^7, he says, “ Societies exist un­  
der three forms, sufficiently distinguisha­  
ble— 1. &quot;Without Governments, as among  
our Indians. 2. Under Governments  
w herein the will of every one has a just  
influence ; as is the case in England, in a  
slight degree, and in our Stales in a great  
one. 3. Under Governments of force : as  
is the case in all other Monarchies, and in  
most of the other Republics. To have an  
idea of the course of existence under these  
last, they must be seen. It is a Govern­  
ment of wolves over sheep. It is a pro­  
blem not clear in my mind that their first  
condition is not the best. But I believe it  
to he inconsistent with any great degree  
of population. The second state has a  
great deal of good in it. The mass of  
mankind under that, enjoys a precious  
degree oflihcrty and happiness. It has  
its evils too ; the principal oi which is the  
turbulence to which it is subject. But  
weigh this against the oppressions of Mon­  
archy, and it becomes nothing Malta pr.•  
rirulosaiii Ubcrtuttm quom nuiclam serri- \
  
fufcm. Even this evil is productive ofl  
good. It prevents the degeneracy of go­  
vernment, and nourishes a general at­  
tention to the public afl’airs. I hold it,  
that a little rebellion now and then  
is a very good thing, and as necessary in  
the political world as storms in the physi­  
cal. Unsuccessful rebellions, indeed,  
generally establish the encroachments on  
the rights ol the people w! ich have pro­  
duced them. An observation of this  
truth should render honest Republican I  
Governors so mild in their punishment of  
rebellions, as not to discourage them too  
much. It is a medicine necessary for the  
sound health of government.”

James Madison, dated Paris, January

combustible population were given to  
riots then as well as now,) Mr. Jef­  
ferson said :  
Those States have sutl&#x27;ered by the stop­  
page of the channels of their commerce,  
which have not yet found other issues.  
This must render&#x27;money scarce, and make  
the people uneasy. This uneasiness has  
produced acts absolutely u: justifiable; but  
1 hope they will provoke no severities from  
their government-. A concsi.ni-oiess ot  
those in power that their administr n ion of  
the public all&#x27;iirs his been honest, may.  
perhaps, produce too great, a degiae of in-  
  
dh&#x27;natioii : and tho-e charrte&#x27;ers wherein  
  
tear predominates over hope, may appre­  
hend too much from the-e instances o! ir  
regularity. They may conclude too hasnly  
that nature has tormed man insti-ceptible oi  
  
anv other iroveruiijetit than that ot lore, a  
  
conclusion not founded in truth, norexp--rience.  
Societies exist under three form-,  
sufficiently distinguishable. 1. Without  
  
s-ovemment as among Indians. 2. Under  
  
governments wherein the wid of even one  
  
has h just iiolm nce, as ;s the case in Eng­

and Paris, writes to Madison: “ He is vain,  
irritable, and a bad calculator of the force and  
probable effect of the motives which govern  
men. ‘This is all the ill which can possibly be  
said of him.”  
  
And in the same letter he dwells on the  
merits of one about eight years his senior:

judgment, except where knowledge of the  
world is necessary to form a judgment, and so  
amiable that you will love him, if ever you be-  
come acquainted with him.”
