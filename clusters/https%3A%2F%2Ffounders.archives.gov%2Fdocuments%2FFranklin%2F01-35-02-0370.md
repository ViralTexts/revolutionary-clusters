stion at present is, Whether Mariners, Persons who have freely chosen a Sea-fareing life, Persons whose Education and Employment have fitted them for the Service, and inured them to it, Whether such Persons may not be legally Pressed into the Service of the Crown, whenever the Publick Safety requireth it, Ne quid detrimenti Respublica capiat.  
“For my part I think they May. I think the Crown hath a Right to Command the Service of these People, whenever the public Safety calleth for it. The same Right that it hath to require the* personal Service of every ManA able to bear Arms in case of a sudden Invasion or formidable Insurrection. The Right in both cases is founded on one and the same Principle, the Necessity of the Case in Order to the Preservation of the Whole.—”  
A The Conclusion here from the Whole to a Part does not seem to be good Logic. Where the Personal Service of every Man is call’d for, there the Burthen is equal. Not so where the Service of a Part is call’d for, and others excus’d. If the Alphabet should say, Let us all fight for the Defence of the whole, that is equal and may therefore be just. But if they should say, Let A.B.C. and D. go out and fight for us, while we stay at home and sleep in whole Skins; that is not equal and therefore cannot be just.  
“It would be time very ill spent to go about to prove that this Nation can never be long in a state of Safety, our Coast defended and our Trade protected, without a Naval Force equal to all the Emergencies that may happen. And how can We be secure of such a Force? The keeping up the Same Naval Force in time of Peace, which will be absolutely necessary for our Security in time of War, would be an absurd, a fruitless, and a ruinous Expence.  
“The only Course then left, is for the Crown to employB upon Emergent Occasions the Mariners bred up in the Merchants Service.—”  
  
B. Employ, if you please. The Word signifies, engaging a Man to work for me by offering him such Wages as are sufficient to induce him to prefer my Service. This is very different from compelling him to work for me on such Terms as I think proper.  
“And as for the Mariner himself, He when taken into the Service of the Crown only changeth Masters for a time: His Service and employmentC continue the very same, with this Advantage, that the Dangers of the Sea and Enemy are not so great in the Service of the Crown, as in that of the Merchant.”  
C His Service and Employment continue the very same, &amp;c. These are false Facts. His Service and Employment are not the same. Under the Merchant he goes in an un-arm’d Vessel not obliged to fight, but only to transport Merchandize. In the King’s Service he is oblig’d to fight, and to Hazard all the Dangers of Battle. Sickness on board King’s Ships, is also more common and more Mortal. The Merchant’s Service too he can quit at the End of a Voyage, not the King’s. Also the Merchant’s wages are much higher.  
“I am very sensibleD of the Hardship the Sailor suffereth from an Impress in some particular Cases, especially if Pressed Homeward-bound after a long Voyage. But the Merchants who hear Me know, that an Impress on Outward-bound Vessels would be attended with much greater Inconveniencies to the Trade of the Kingdom; and yet That too is sometimes Necessary. But where two Evils present, a wise Administration, if there be room for an Option, will choose the Least.”D2  
D I am very sensible &amp;c. Here are two things put in Comparison that are not comparable, viz. Injury to Seamen, and Inconvenience to Trade. Inconvenience to the whole Trade of a Nation will not justify Injustice to a single Seaman. If the Trade would suffer without his Service, it is able and ought to be willing to offer him such Wages as may induce him to afford his Service voluntarily.  
D2 The least. The least Evil in case seamen are wanted, is to give them such wages as will induce them to inlist voluntarily. Let this Evil be divided among the whole Nation, by an Equal Tax to pay such Wages.  
  
Page 159.  
“War itself is a great Evil, but it is chosen to avoid a greater. The Practice of Pressing is one of the Mischiefs War bringeth with it. But it is a Maxim in Law, and good Policy too, that all private Mischiefs must be borne with Patience for preventing a National Calamity.E And as no greater Calamity can befall Us than to be weak and defenceless at Sea in a time of War, so I do not know that the Wisdom of the Nation hath hitherto found out any Method of Manning our Navy, less InconvenientE2 than Pressing; and at the same time, equally Sure and Effectual.”  
E Where is this Maxim in Law and good Policy to be found? And how came that to be a Maxim which is not consistent with Common Sense. If the Maxim had been that private Mischiefs which prevent a National Calamity ought to be generously compensated by that Nation, one might have understood it. But that such private Mischiefs are only to be borne with Patience is absurd.  
E2 Less inconvenient. Less inconvenient to whom? To the Rich indeed, who ought to be taxed. No Mischief more inconvenient to poor Seamen could possibly be contrived.  
“The Expedient of a Voluntary Register which was attempted in King William’s time, had no Effect.  
“And some late Schemes I have seen appear to Me more inconvenient to the Mariner and more inconsistent with the Principles of Liberty, than the Practice of Pressing: and, what is still worse, they are in my Opinion totally Impracticable.”F  
F Twenty ineffectual or inconvenient Schemes will not justify one [torn: that is?] unjust.

I When the Author speaks of Impressing Page 158. he diminishes the Horror of the Practice, as much as possible, by presenting to the Mind one Sailor only suffering a Hardship, as he tenderly calls it, in some Particular Cases only; and he places against this private Mischief the Inconvenience to the Trade of the Kingdom.— But if, as I suppose is often the Case, the Sailor who is press’d and oblig’d to serve for the Defence of this Trade at the Rate of 25 s. a Month, could have had £3.15. s. in the Merchant’s Service, you take from him 50 s. a Month: and if you have 100,000 in your Service, you rob that honest industrious part of Society, and their poor Families, of £250,000 per Month or £3,000,000 a Year, and at the same time oblige them to hazard their Lives in fighting for the Defence of your Trade; to the Defence of which all ought indeed to contribute, (and Sailors among the rest) in proportion to their Profits by it; but this £3,000,000 is more than their Share if they did not pay with their Persons; and when you force that, methinks you should excuse the other.  
But it may be said, to give the King’s Seamen Merchant’s Wages would cost the Nation too much, and call for more Taxes. The Question then will amount to this; Whether it be just in a Community, that the Richer Part should compell the Poorer, to fight for them and their Properties, for such Wages as they think fit to allow, and punish them if they refuse? Our Author tells us it is legal. I have not Law enough to dispute his Authorities, but I cannot persuade myself that it is equitable. I will however own for the present that Pressing may be Lawful when necessary; but then I contend that it may be us’d so as to produce the same good Effect, the publick Security, without doing so much horrible Injustice as attends the Impressing common Seamen. In order to be better understood I would premise two things 1st: That Voluntary Seamen might be had for the Service, if they were sufficiently paid. The Proof of this is, that to serve in the same Ships, and incurr the same Dangers, you have no Occasion to Impress Captains, Lieutenants, Second Lieutenants, Midshipmen, Pursers, nor any other Officers. Why but that the Profits of their Places, or the Emoluments expected, are sufficient Inducements. The Business then is to find Money by Impressing, sufficient to make the Sailors all Volunteers as well as their Officers: and this without any fresh Burthen upon Trade: The second of my Premises is, that 25 s. a Month with his Share of the Salt Beef, Pork and Peaspudding, being found sufficient for the Subsistence of a hard working Seamen, it will certainly be so for a sedentary Scholar or Gentleman. I would then propose to form a Treasury, out of which Encouragements to Seamen should be paid. To fill this Treasury, I would Impress a Number of Civil Officers, who at present have great Salaries, oblige them to serve in their respective Offices for 25 s. per Month, with their Share of the Mess Provisions, and throw the rest of their Salaries into the Seaman’s Treasury. If such a Press Warrant was give me to execute, the first thing I would press should be a Recorder of Bristol or a Mr. Justice Forster, because I might have need of his edifying Example to show how such Impressing ought to be borne with; for he would certainly find that tho’ to be reduced to 25 s. per Month might be a private Mischief, yet that agreable to his Maxim of Law and good Policy, it ought to be borne with Patience, for preventing a National Calamity. Then I would press the rest of the Judges; and opening the Red Book, I would press every civil Officer of Government from £50. a year up to £50,000 which would throw an immense Sum into our Treasury; and these Gentlemen could not well complain, since they would receive their 25 s. a Month and their Rations, and that too without being oblig’d to fight. Lastly I think I would Impress the

not quite satisfied of the Necessity or Utility of that Office in Great Britain, as I see many flourishing States in the World governed well and happily without it.  
  
Page 174.  
“It cannot be complained of otherwise than as a private Mischief, which must be submitted to for avoiding a public Inconvenience.”  
I do not see the Propriety of this must. The private Mischief is the Loss of Liberty and Hazard of Life with only half Wages, to a great Number of honest Men. The public Inconvenience is merely a higher Rate of Seamen’s Wages. He who thinks such private Injustice must be done to avoid public Inconvenience may understand Law, but seems imperfect in his Knowledge of Equity.— Let us apply this Author’s Doctrine to his own Case. It is for the public Service that Courts should be held and Judges appointed to administer the Laws. The Judges should be bred to the Law, and skilful in it, but their great Salaries are a public Inconvenience. To remove the Inconvenience, Let Press Warrants issue to arrest and apprehend the best Lawyers, and compel them to serve as Judges for half the Money they would have made at the Bar. Then tell them, that tho’ this is to them a private Mischief, it must be submitted to for avoiding a public Inconvenience. Would the learned Judge approve such Use of his Doctrine?  
Text, page 177.  
“For I freely declare, that ancient Precedents alone, unless supported by modern Practice, weigh very little with me in Questions of this Nature.”  
The modern Practice supported by antient Precedents weighs as little with me. Both the one and the other only show that the Constitution is yet Imperfect, since in so gener

‘ Jb, * Employ.” —If you pleafe. The word fignifies engaging  
a man to work for me, by offering him fuch wages as are fufficient  
to induce him to prefer my fervice. This is very different from  
compelling him to work on fuch terms as I think proper.  
  
‘ Jb, “ This fervice and employment, &amp;c.”—Thefe are falfe  
faéts. His employments and fervice are not the fame.—Under the  
merchant he goes in an unarmed veffel, not obliged to fight, but to  
tranfport merchandize. In the king&#x27;s fervice he is obliged to fight,  
and to hazard all the dangers of battle. Sicknefs on board of king’s  
fips is alfo more common and more mortal. The merchant&#x27;s fervice  
too he can quit at the end of the voyage; not the king’s. Allfo, the  
merchant&#x27;s wages are much higher.  
  
‘ Jb. * I am very fenfible, &amp;c.’”—Here are two things put in  
comparifon that are not comparable: viz. injury to feamen, and  
inconvenience to trade. Inconvenience to the whole trade of a na-  
tion will not juftify injuftice to a fingle feaman, If the trade would  
fiifer without his fervice, it is able and ought to be willing to offer  
him fuch wages as may induce him to afford his fervice voluns -  
tarily.

author {peaks of imprefling, page 158, he dim&#x27;nifhes the horror of. &#x27;  
  
the practice as much as poffible, by prefenting to the mind orie failor  
only fuffering a “* hardfip” (as he tenderly calls it) j in fome “ par-  
ticular tafes” only ; and he places againft this private mifchi¢f the  
inconvenience to the trade of the kingdom. —B8ut if, as he fuppofes  
is often the cafe, the failor who is preffed, and obliged to ferve fot  
the defence of trade, at the rate of twenty-five fhillings a month;  
- could get three pounds fifteen fhillings in the merchant’s fervice,  
you take from him fifty fhillings amonth; and if you have a 100,000  
in your fervice, you rob this honeft induftrious part of fociety and  
their poor fatnilies of 2§0,000l. per month, or three millions a year,  
and at the fame time oblige them to hazard their lives in fighting for  
the defence of your trade; to the defence of whichvall ought, indeed,  
to contribute (and failors among the reft) in proportion to theif  
profits by it: but this three millions is more than their fhare, if  
they did not pay with their perfons; but when you foree that, me-  
thinks you fhould excufe the other.  
¢ But it may be faid, to give the king’s feamen merchants’ wages,  
would coft the nation. too much, and call for moré taxes. The  
queftion then will amount to this: whether it be juft in a commu-  
nity, that the richer part fhould compel the poorer to fight in defence  
of them and their properties, for fuch wages as they think fit to allow,  
and punifh them if they refufe ? Our author tells us that it is * Jegal.”  
I have not law enough to difpute his authorities, but I eannot per-  
{uade myfelf that it is equitable. I will, however; own for the pres  
fent, that it may be lawful when neceffary ; but then I contend that  
it may be ufed fo as to produce the fame good éftetts—the pudlic  
Security, without doing fo much intolerable injuiftice as attends the  
imprefling common feamen.—In order to be better underftood, I  
would premife two things: Firft, that voluntary feamen may as  
had for the fervice, if they were fufficiently paid. The proof is,  
that to ferve in the fame fhip, and ineur the fame dangers, you  
have no occafion to imprefs captains, lieutenants, fecond lieutenants,  
midfhipmen, purfers, nor many other officers, Why, but that the  
profits of their: places, or the emoluments expected, are fufficient  
inducements ? The bnfinefs then is, to find money, by ‘mpreffing,  
fufficient to make the failors all voluntcers, as well as. their officers ;

 premifes is, that twenty-five fhillings a month, with his fhare of the  
falt beef, pork, and peas-pudding, being found fufficient for the  
fubfiftence of a hard working feaman, it will certainly be fo fora  
fedentary fcholar or gentleman. I would then propofe to forma —

To fill this treafury, 1 would imprefs a number of civil officers,  
who at prefent have great falaries, oblige them to ferve in their re-  
fpective offices for twenty-five fhillings a month, with their fhares of  
mefs provifions, and throw the reft of their falaries into the feamen’s  
treafury. If fuch a prefs-warrant were given. me to execute, the  
firft I would prefs fhould be a recorder of Briftol, or a Mr. juftice  
Fofter, becaufe I might have need of his edifying example, to fhow  
how much imprefling ought to. be borne with; for he would certain-  
ly find, that though to be reduced to twenty-five fhillings a month  
might be a “ private mi/chief,” yet that, agreeably to his maxim of  
law and good policy, it “ ought to be borne. with patience,” for pre-  
venting a national calamity. Then I would prefs the reft of the  
judges ; and, opening the red book, I would prefs every civil officer  
of government, from sol. a year falary, up to 50,0001. which would  
throw an immenfe fum into our treafury : and thefe gentlemen

When this author speaks of impressing, page  
158, he diminishes the horror of the practice as  
much as possible, by representing to the mind  
one sailor only suffering hardship (as he tenderly  
Calls it) in non\eparticular cates only 5 and he  
places against this private mischief the inconve­  
nience to the trade of the kingdom.—But if, as  
he supposes is often the case, tlie sailor who is  
pressed, and obliged to serve for the defence of  
trade, at the rate of twenty-five shillings a month,  
could get three pounds fifteen shillings in the  
merchant&#x27;s service, you take from him fifty shil­  
lings a month $ andifyou have an 100,000 in your  
service, you rob this honest industrious part of  
society, and their poor families of 150,0001. per  
month, or three millions a year, and at the same  
time oblige them to hazard their lives.in fighting  
for the defence of your trade 5 to the defence of  
which all ought indeed to contribute (and sailors  
among the rest) in proportion to their profits by  
it ; but this three millions is more than their  
share if they did not pay with their persons) but  
when you force that, nicthinks you should ex­  
cuse the other.  
But it may be said, to give the king’s seamen  
merchant’s wages would cost the nation too  
much, and call for more taxes. The question  
then will amount to this : whether it be just in  
a community, that the richer part should compel  
the poorer to fight in defence of them and their  
properties, for such wages as they think fit to  
allow, and punish them if they refuse ? Our au­  
thor tell us that it is “ legal** 1 have not law e­  
nougli to dispute his authorities, but 1 cannot  
persuade myself that it is equitable. I will how  
ever, own for the present that it may be lawful  
when necessary ; but then -I contend that it may  
be used so as to produce the same good effects—  
the public security, without doing so much intol­  
erable injustice as attends the impressing com­  
mon seamen.—In order to be better understood,  
I would premise two tilings ; First, that volun­  
tary seamen may be had for the service if they  
were sufficiently paid. The proof is, that to  
serve in the same ship, and incur the same dan­  
gers you have no occasion to impress captains,  
lieutenants, second lieutenants, midshipmen,  
pursers, nor many other officers. Wiiy, but that  
the profits of their places or the emoluments ex­  
pected, are sufficient inducements ? The busi­  
ness then is, to find money, by impressing, suffi­  
cient to make the sailors all volunteers, as well  
as their officers ; and this without any fresh bur­  
then upon trade.—•The second of my premises  
is, that twenty-five shillings a month, with his  
share of salt beef, pork, and pease-pudding, be­  
ing found sufficient for the subsistence of a hard  
working seaman, it will certainly be so for a  
sedentary scholar or gentleman I would then  
propose to form a treasury, out of which encou­  
ragements to seamen should be paid. To fill  
this treasury I would impress a number of civil  
officers, who at present have great salaries, ob­  
lige them to serve in their respective offices for  
twenty-five shillings a month with their shares  
of mess provisions, and throw the rest of their  
salaries into the seamen&#x27;s treasury. If such a  
press-warrant were given me to execute, the  
first I would press should be a Recorder of Bris­  
tol, ora Mr. Justice Foster, because I might  
have need of l.is edifying example, to show how  
much impressing ought to be borne with ; for  
he would certainly find, that though to be reduc­  
ed to 25 shillings a month might be a private  
mischief, yet that, agreeably to his maxim of  
law and good policy it ought to be borne with pa~  
tiencej for preventing a national calamity. Then  
I would press the rest ofthe Judges ; and open­  
ing the red book, I would press every civil offi­  
cer of government from 5«l.a year salary, up to  
50,0001. which would throw ail immense sum in­  
to our treasury : and these gentlemen could not  
complain, since they would receive twenty five  
shillings a month, and their rations • and this  
without being obliged to fight. Lastly, I think I  
would impress.**

of Judge Foster’s celebrated argument in favor of the {mpress-  
ing of Seamen (published in the folio edition of his works).  
Jupee Foster, p. 158. ‘Every man.’—The conclusion  
  
here from the whole to a part, does not seem to be good logic.  
  
If the alphabet should say, Let us all fight for the defence of  
  
the whole ; that is equal, and may, therefore, be just. But  
  
if they should say, Let A BC and D go out and fight for us,  
while we stay at home and sleep in whole skins ; that is not  
equal, and therefore cannot be just.  
  
Ib, ‘Employ.—If you please. The word signifies en-  
gaging a man to work for me, by offering him such wages as  
are sufficient to induce him to prefer my service. This is  
very different from compelling him to work on such terms as  
I think proper.  
  
Ib. This service and employment,’ &amp;c.—These are false  
facts. His employment oa service are not the same.—Un-  
der the merchant he goes in an unarmed vessel, not obliged  
to fight, but to transport merchandize. In the king’s service  
he is obliged to fight, and to hazard all the dangers of battle.  
Sickness on board of king’s ships is also more common and  
more mortal, The merchant’s service, too, he can quit at  
the end of the voyage; not the king’s, Also, the merchant’s  
waves are much higher.  
  
Th. ‘Lam very sensible,’ &amp;c.—Here are two things put in  
comparison that are not comparable: viz. injury to seamen,  
and inconvenience to trade. Inconvenience to the whole trade  
of a nation will not justify injustice toa single seaman. If  
the trade would suffer without his service, it is able and ought  
to be willing to offer him such wages as may induce him to  
afford his service voluntarily.  
  
Page 159. ‘Private mischief must be borne with patience,  
for preventing a national calamity.’ Where is this maxim in  
law and good policy to be found? And how can that be a  
maxim which is not consistent with common sense? If the  
maxim had been, that private mischiefs, which prevent a na-  
tional calamity, ought to be generously compensated by the  
nation, one might understand it: but that such private mis-  
chiefs are only to be borne with patience, is absurd!  
  
Ib. ‘The expedient,’ &amp;c. ‘And,’ &amp;c, (Paragraphs 2  
and 3).—T wenty ineffectual or inconvenient schemes will not  
justify one that is unjust.

this author speaks of impressing, page 158, he diminishes the  
horror of the practice as much as possible, by presenting to  
the mind one sailor only suffering a ‘ hardship’ (as he tender-  
ly calls it) in some ‘ particular cases’ only; and he places  
against this private mischief the inconvenience to the trade  
of the kingdom.—But if, as he supposes is often the case, the  
sailor who is pressed and obliged to serve for the defence of  
trade, at the rate of twenty-five shillings a month, could get  
three pounds fifteen shillings in the merchants’ service, you  
take from him fifty shillings a month ; and if you have 100,000  
in your service, you rob this honest industrious part of socie-  
ty and their poor families of 250,000/. per month, or three  
millions a year, and at the same time oblige them to hazard  
their lives in fighting for the defence of your trade ; to the de=  
fence of which all ought indeed to contribute (and sailors  
among the rest) in proportion to their profits by it: but this  
three millions is more than their share, if they do not pay  
with their persons; but when you force that, methinks you  
should excuse the other.  
  
But, it may be said, to give the king’s seamen merchants’  
wages would cost the nation too much, and call for more taxes,  
The question then will amount to this: whether it be just in  
a community, that the richer part should compel the poorer  
to fight in defence of them and their properties, for such wa-  
ges as they think fit to allow, and punish them if they refuse ?  
Our author tells us that it is ‘legal.’ I have not law enough  
to dispute his authorities, but I cannot persuade myself that  
it is equitable. I will, however, own for the present, that it  
may be lawful when necessary; but then I contend that it  
may be used so as to produce the same good effects—the  
public security, without doing so much intolerable injustice as  
aitends the impressing common seamen.—In order to be bet-  
ter under-iood, I would premise two things :—First, That  
voluntary seamen may be had for the service, if they were  
sufficiently paid. The proof is, that to serve in the same  
ship, and incur the same dangers, you have no occasion to  
impress captains, lieutenants, second lieutenants, midshi  
men, pursers, nor many other officers. Why, but that the  
  
profits of their places, or the emoluments expected, are suf  
  
  
  
ficient ind ts? Theb then is, to find money,  
by impressing, sufficient to make the sailors all volunteers, as  
well as their officers ; and this without any fresh burden upon  
trade.—The second of my premises is, that twenty-five shil-  
lings a month, with his share of the salt beef, pork, and peas-  
pudding, being found sufficient for the subsistence of a hard-  
working seaman, it will certainly be so for a sedentary scho-  
lar or gentleman, I would then propose to form a treasury,  
out of which encouragements to seamen should be paid. To  
fill this treasury, I would impress a number of civil officers,  
who at present have great salaries, oblige them to serve in  
their respective offices for twenty-five shillings a month with  
their share of mess provisions, and throw the rest of their  
salaries into the seamen’s treasury. If such a press-war-  
rant were given me to execute, the first I would press should  
be a Recorder of Bristol, or a Mr. Justice Foster, because  
I might have need of his edifying example, to show how much  
impressing ought to be borne with; for he would wee  
find, that though to be reduced to twenty-five shillings a mont  
might be a ‘private mischief,’ yet that, agreeably to bis max-  
im of law and good policy, it ‘ ought to be borne with patience,  
for preventing a national calamity. Then I would press the  
rest of the judges; and, opening the red book, I would press  
every civil officer of government, from 501. a year salary up  
to 50,000/. which would throw an immense sum into our  
treasury ; and these gentlemen could not complain, since they  
would receive twenty-five shillings a month, and their rations ;  
and this without being obliged to fight. Lastly, I think I  
would impress * *

inst this private mischief the inconvenience to the trade of the kingdom. But  
if as is often the case, the sailor who is pressed, and obliged to serve for the  
defence of his trade, at the rate of 25s. a month, could have 75s. in the  
Merchant’s service, you take from him 50s. a month, and if you have 100,000  
men in your service, you rob that honest part of society and their poor families of  
250,000/. per month, or three millions a year, and at the same time oblige them  
to hazard their lives in fighting for the defence of your trade; to the defence of  
which all ought indeed to contribute (and sailors among the rest) in proportion  
to their profits by it; but this three millions is more than their share, if they did  
not pay with their persons; and when you force that, surely you should ex-  
cusethe other. But it may be said, to give the King’s seamen Merchant’s wages  
would cost the nation too much, and call for more taxes. The question, then,  
would amount to this: whether it be just in a community that the richer part  
should compel the poorer to fight for them and their property, for such wages as  
they think Rt to allow, and punish them if they refuse. The Judge tells us it is  
légal. I have not law enough to dispute his authority, but I cannot persuade  
myself it is equitable. I will, however, own for the present, that pressing may  
lawful when necessary ; but then I contend that it may be used so as to pro-  
duce the same good effect, the pulic security, without doing so much horrible  
injustice as attends the pressing common seamen. In order to be by them un-  
derstood, I should premise two things: First, that voluntary seamen might be  
had for the service if they were sufficiently paid. The proof of this is, that to  
serve in the same ships, and incur the same dangers, you have no occasion to im-  
Press captains, lieutenants, second lieutenants, midshipmen, pursers, nor any  
other officers. Why—but that the profit of their places, or the emoluments ex-  
pected, are sufficient inducement? ‘The business is then, by impressing, to find  
money sufficient to make the sailors all volunteers, as well as their officers, and  
this without any fresh burden upon trade. The second of my premises is, that  
25s. a month, with his share of the salt beef, pork, and pease pudding, being  
found sufficient for the subsistence of hard working seamen, it will certainly be so  
asedentary scholar or gentleman. I would then propose to form a treasury,  
out of which bounties to seamen should be paid. To fill this treasury, I  
Would impress a number of civil officers, who/at present have great salaries,  
oblige them to serve in their respective offices for 25s. per month, with their share  
of the mess of provisions, and throw the rest of their salary into the seamen’s  
Weasury. If sucha press-warrant was given me to execute, the first person I would  
press should be a Recorder of Bristol, or a First Lord of the Admiralty, because I  
might have need of his edifying example, to show how such impressing ought to  
borne with ; for he would certainly find that though to be reduced to 25s. per  
month might be a private mischief, yet that agreeable to his maxim of law and  
pobey, it ought to be borne with patience for preventing a national calamity.  
would press the rest of the judges, and opening the Red Book, I would
