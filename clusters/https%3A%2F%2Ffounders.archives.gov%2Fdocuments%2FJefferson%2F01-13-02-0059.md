It will infallibly turn thro the Patowmack all the commerce of Lake Erie and the country West of that, except what may pass down the Missisipi. And it is important that it be soon done, lest that commerce should in the mean time get established in another channel. Having in the spring of the last year taken a journey through the Southern parts of France, and particularly examined the canal of Languedoc through it’s whole course, I take the liberty of sending you the notes I made on the spot, as you may find in them something perhaps which may be turned to account some time or other in the prosecution of the Patowmac canal.

s gave me insight into the state of national credit there which I had never before been able satisfactorily to get. The English credit is the first, because they never open a loan without laying and appropriating taxes for the paiment of the interest, and there has never been an instance of their failing one day in that paiment. The Emperor and Empress have good credit, because they use it little, and have hitherto been very punctual. This country is among the lowest in point of credit. Ours stands in hope only. They consider us as the surest nation on earth for the repaiment of the capital. But as the punctual paiment of interest is of absolute necessity in their arrangements, we cannot borrow but with difficulty and disadvantage. The monied men however look towards our new government with a great degree of partiality and even anxiety. If they see that set out on the English plan, the first degree of credit will be transferred to us. A favourable occasion will arise to our new government of asserting this ground to themselves. The transfer of the French debt, public and private, to Amsterdam is certainly desireable. An act of the new government therefore for opening a loan in Holland for this purpose, laying tax

tention.—I had intended to have written a word to your Excellency on the subject of the new constitution, but I have already spun out my letter to an immoderate length. I will just observe therefore that according to my ideas there is a great deal of good in it. There are two things however which I dislike strongly. 1. The want of a declaration of rights. I am in hopes the opposition of Virginia will remedy this, and produce such a declaration. 2. The perpetual re-eligibility of the President. This I fear will make that an office for life first, and then hereditary. I was much an enemy to monarchy before I came to Europe. I am ten thousand times more so since I have seen what they are. There is scarcely an evil known in these countries which may not be traced to their king as it’s source, nor a good which is not derived from the small fibres of republicanism existing among them. I can further say with safety there is not a crowned head in Europe whose talents or merit would entitle him to be elected a vestryman by the people of any parish in America. However I shall hope that before there is danger of this change taking place in the office of President, the good sense and free spirit of our countrymen will make the changes necessary to prevent it. Under this hope I look forward to the general adoption of the new constitution with anxiety, as necessary for us under our present
