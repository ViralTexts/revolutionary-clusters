					Dear Sir  
						London. Septr. 21st. 1808.  
					  
					My late private Letters were of the Dates of the 7th. 10th. and 12th. of September, to which last was a P. S. of the 13th.  
					The Hope arrived at Cowes from France on the 13th.; but brought me nothing from Genl. Armstrong.  
					Not having heard from Mr. Canning, although he returned to London on the 16th., I called again, Yesterday, at Downing Street, and was assured that the Answer to my Note would be sent tonight or early Tomorrow Morning. Mr. Atwater will of Course be able to  
						leave Town on Friday, and embark on Saturday, with a Copy of it.  
					I have been told since the Arrival of the last B. Packet (but do not believe it) that there is more Probability than I had anticipated, that the late Events in Spain &amp; Portugal (which ought not to be considered as deciding any thing) will have an Effect on Public opinion in America, against the Continuance of the Embargo, and favorable to all the Purposes of Great Britain. If this were true I should think that it was deeply to be lamented. I may  
						misunderstand the subject; but I cannot persuade myself that any thing that has happened on this Side the Atlantic ought to induce us to retreat in any Degree from our present System.  
					If we should resolve to trade with Spain &amp; Portugal (G. B. &amp; France persisting in their orders &amp; Decrees) in any Way to which G. B. wd. not object, we must suspend the Embargo as to those Countries only, or as to those Countries and Great  
						Britain; or we must repeal it altogether.  
					The Temptation to the first of these Courses is, even in a Commercial Sense, inconsiderable, the Objections to it endless. The Object to be gained (if no more was gained than ought to be gained) would be trifling. There could, indeed, be no Gain. An  
						inadequate Market redundantly supplied, wd. be more injurious than no Market at all. It wd. be a Lure to Destruction, and nothing more.  
					A Suspension of the Embargo so limited in its Nature as this wd. be (supposing it to be in Fact what it wd. be in Form) wd. have a most unequal &amp; invidious Operation in the different Quarters of the Union, of which the various Commodities wd. not, in  
						the Ports of Portugal &amp; Spain be in equal Demand.  
					A War with France wd. be inevitable; and such a War (so Produced) from which we could not hope to derive either Honour or advantage, wd. place us at the Mercy of G. B. and on that account would in the End do more to cripple &amp; humble us than any Disaster  
						that could otherwise befal us.  
					The actual State of Spain &amp; Portugal is, moreover, not to be relied upon. My first Opinion on that Subject remains; but even the most sanguine will admit that there is great Room for Doubt. The Emperor of France is evidently collecting a mighty Force  
						for the Reduction of Spain; &amp; Portugal must share its Fate. And even if that Force shd. be destined (as some suppose) first to contend with Austria, the speedy Subjugation of Spain is not the less certain. If France should succeed, Spain &amp; Portugal wd. again fall  
						under the B. orders of November, as well as under the Operation of the French Decrees. Our Cargoes wd. scarcely have found their Way to the Ocean, in Search of this boasted Market before they wd. be once more in a State of Prohibition.  
						And we should, in the meantime, have incurred the Scandal of suffering an improvident Thirst of Gain to seduce us from our Principles, into a Dilemma Presenting no alternative but Loss in all the Senses of that Word.  
					But it is not even certain what G. B. wd. herself finally say to such a Partial Suspension of the Embargo. She would doubtless, at first, approve of it, but her ultimate Course (especially if War between France &amp; the U. S. were not the immediate  
						Consequence, or if the measure were eventually less beneficial to herself than might be supposed at the outset) ought not to be trusted. That she wd. approve at first is hardly to be questioned; and the Considerations upon which she wd. do so are precisely those which shd.  
						dissuade us from it.  
					Some of these are, the Aid it wd. afford to her allies, as well as to her own Troops Cooperating with them, and its consequent Tendency to destroy every thing like System in our Conduct; its Tendency to embroil us with France; its Tendency to induce us, by  
						overstocking a limited Market, to make our Commodities of no Value, to dissipate our Capital, to ruin our Merchants without benefiting our agriculture, to destroy our infant Manufactures without benefiting our Commerce; its Tendency to habituate us to a trammeled Trade, and  
						to fit us for Acquiescence in a maritime Despotism.  
					But there are other Reasons. Our Trade with Spain &amp; Portugal, while it lasted, would be a circuitous Trade with G. B. &amp; her Colonies for their Benefit. Our productions wd. be carried in the first Instance to Spain  
						&amp; Portugal, wd. be bought there for B. Account, and wd. find their Way to the W. Indies, or center here, as B. Convenience might require; and thus in Effect the Embargo wd. be removed as to G. B., while it continued as to France, and we professed to continue it as to  
						both. And, if any Profits shd. arise from this sordid Traffic, they wd. become a Fund to enable us to import into the U. S., directly or indirectly, the Manufactures of G. B. &amp; thus relieve her in another Way, while her orders wd. prevent us from receiving the Commodities  
						of her Enemy. It would be far better openly to take off the Embargo as to G. B., than, while affecting to continue it as to that Power, to do what must rescue her completely (and that too without Advantage to ourselves) from the Pressure of it, at the same Time that it would  
						promote her Views against France in Portugal &amp; Spain.  
					As to withdrawing the Embargo from G. B. as well as Spain &amp; Portugal while the B. orders are unrepealed, the Objections to that Course are just as strong now, as they were four Months ago. The Change in Spain &amp; Portugal (if it were even likely to  
						last) cannot touch the Principle of the Embargo as regards G. B.; who re-asserts her orders of November in the very Explanations of the 4th. of July under which we must trade with those Countries if we trade with them at all. If we include G. B. in the Suspension &amp;  
						exclude France, we do now what we have declined to do before, for the Sake of a delusive Commerce, which may perish before it can be enjoyed, &amp; cannot in any Event be enjoyed with Credit, with Advantage, or even with Safety. We take Part at once with G. B. agt. France, at  
						a Time the least suited that could be imagined to such a Determination, at a Time when it might be said that we were  by French Reverses to do what before we could not resolve upon, or were tempted by the Prospect of a scanty Profit, exaggerated  
						by our Cupidity &amp; Impatience, to forget what was due to Consistency, to Character, to Permanent Prosperity. We sanction, too, the maritime Pretensions which insult &amp; injure us. We throw ourselves bound Hand &amp; Foot upon the Generosity of a  
						Government that has hitherto refused us Justice; and all this when the Affair of the Chesapeake &amp; a Host of other Wrongs are unredressed, and when G. B. has just rejected an overture, which she must have accepted with Eagerness, if her Views were not such as it became us  
						to suspect and guard against.  
					To repeal the Embargo altogether would be preferable to either of the other Courses; but wd. notwithstanding be so fatal to us in all Respects that we should long feel the Wound it wd. inflict; unless indeed some other Expedient, as strong at least &amp; as  
						efficacious in all its Bearings, can (as I fear it cannot) be substituted in its Place.  
					War wd. seem to be the unavoidable Result of such a Step. If our Commerce shd. not flourish in Consequence of this Measure, nothing wd. be gained by it but Dishonour, and how it could be carried on to any valuable Purpose, it wd. be difficult to shew. If  
						our Commerce should flourish, in Spite of French &amp; B. Edicts &amp; the miserable State of the World, in Spite of War with France, if that shd. happen, it would, I doubt not, be assailed in some other Form. The Spirit of Monopoly has seized  
						the People &amp; Govt. of this Country. We shall not, under any Circumstances, be tolerated as Rivals in Navigation &amp; Trade. It is in vain to hope that G. B. will voluntarily foster the naval means of the United States. All her Prejudices, all her Calculations are against  
						it. Even as allies we should be Subjects of Jealousy.  
					It wd. be endless to enumerate in Detail the Evils which wd. cling to us in this new Career of Vassalage and Meanness, and tedious to pursue our backward Course to the Extinction of the very Trade to which we had sacrificed every Thing else.  
					On the other Hand if we persevere we must gain our Purpose at last. By complying with the little Policy of the Moment we shall be lost. By a great &amp; systematic Adherence to Principle, we shall find the End of our Difficulties.  
					The Embargo &amp; the Loss of our Trade are deeply felt here, and will be felt with more Severity every Day. The Wheat Harvest is likely to be alarmingly short, and the State of the Continent will augment the Evil. The Discontents among their Manufacturers  
						are only quieted for the Moment by temporary Causes. Cotton is rising, &amp; will soon be scarce. Unfavourable Events on the Continent will subdue the Temper, unfriendly to Wisdom &amp; Justice, which now prevails here. But above all, the World will I trust be convinced that  
						our Firmness is not to be shaken. Our Measures have not been without Effect. They have not been decisive, because we have not been thought capable of persevering in Self Denial; if that can be called Self-Denial  
						which is no more than prudent Abstinence from Destruction &amp; Dishonour.  
					I ought to mention that I have been told by a most respectable American Merchant here, that large Quantities of such Woollen Cloths as are Prohibited by our non Importation Act have been &amp; continue to be sent to Canada with the View of being smuggled  
						into the U. S.  
					I Beg you to excuse the Length &amp; Frequency of my private Letters and still more their Contents. I need not tell you that I am not induced to trouble you with my hasty Reflections because I think you stand in need of them. I give them merely because I  
						believe that you are entitled to know the Impressions which a public Servant on this Side of the Water receives from a View of our Situation.

t subject remains. Bui even the most  
- sanguine will admit that there is great  
, room to doubt. Tne emperor of  
, France is evidently collecting a migh­  
i ty force for the reduction of Spain,  
r and Portugal must share its fate,  
i And even if that force should be des­  
tined (at some suppose) first to con­  
- tend with Austria-—the speedy subju­  
-1 gation of Spain is not the less certain,  
t If France should succeed Spain &amp; Por­  
- tugalwonld again fall under the British  
. orders ol November, as well us un­  
l der the operation of the- French de­

- have found their way to the ocean in  
1 search of the boasted market, before  
i they would be once more in a state of

mean time have incurred the scan­  
i dal oF suffering an improvident  
. thirst of gr.in to seduce us from our  
. principles into a dilemma presenting  
&gt; no alternative but loss in all the senses  
j of the word.  
&quot; Bul it is i.o&#x27;, even Certain, what G. Bri­  
tain would herself finally say to such a partial  
1 suspension of (he eiiibareo. She would  
&#x27; doubtless at first approve of it. But her  
r ; ultimate course (especially if war between  
! : France and the U. Ot the  
immediate consequence, or if the measure  
were eventually less beneficial to herself,  
• than might be supposed at the outset)  
, ought not to be trusted. That she should  
. &#x27; approve at Brat is hardly to be questioned,  
j and the conside rations upon which she  
; would do so, arc precis; I which

r. i well as to her own troops co-operating with

“ The Hope arrived at Cowes from France, the  
13th.  
“ Not having heard from Mr. Canning, although he  
returned to London the 16th, 1 called again yester­  
day at Downing-strtet, and was assured that the an­  
swer to my note would be sent to night or early to­  
morrow morning. Mr. Atwater will of course he  
able to leave town on Friday, and embark on Sa­  
turday with a copy of it.  
“ I have been told since the arrival of the last Bri­  
tish packet, (but do not believe it) that there is more  
probability than 1 had anticipated, that the late e­  
vents in Spain and Portugal, (which ought not to he  
considered as deciding any thing,) will h ive an ef­  
fect on publick opinion in America against the con­  
tinuance of the embargo, and favourable to all the  
purposes of Grcat-Britain. If this were true, I  
should think it was deeply to he lamented. I may  
m.understand the subject, but 1 cannot persuade my­  
self that any thing that has happened on this side the  
Atlantick, ought to induce us in any degree to re­  
treat from our present system. If we should resolve  
to trade with Spain and Portugal, (Gieat-Britain  
and France persisting in their orders and decrees)  
m any way to which Great-Britain would not object,  
we must suspend the embargo as to those countries  
only, or as to those countries and Great Britain, or  
we must repeal It altogether. The temptation to  
the first of these courses is, even m a commercial  
sense inconsiderable—the objections to it endless.—  
1 lie object to be gained (it no more was gained than  
ought to be gained) would be trifling. There could  
indeed be no gain. An inadequate market redund­  
antly supplied, would be more mjuri. us than no  
market at all—it would be a lure to destruction and  
nothing more. A suspension of the embargo so li­  
mited in its nature as this would be, (supposing it  
could lie in fact what it could be i:i form) would have  
a most unequaland invidious operation in the differ­  
ent quarters ot the union, of which the various com­  
modities, would not in the ports of Portugal and  
Spain, be in equal demand. A war with France  
would be inevitable—and such a war (so produced) .  
from which we could not hope to derive either ho­  
nour or advantage, would place us at the mercy of  
Great Britain, and on that account would in the end  
do more to cripple and humble us, than any di1 is­  
ter that could otherwise befal us. The actual state  
of Spain and Portugal is moreover not to be relied  
upon. My first opinion on that subject remains.—  
But even the most sanguine will admit that there is  
great room to doubt. The emperour of France is  
evidently collecting a mighty force for the reduction  
of Spain, and Portugal must share its fate. And e­  
ven if that force should be destined (as some sup­  
pose) first to contend with Austria—the speedy sub­  
jugation of Spain is not the less certain. If France  
should succeed—Spain and Portugal would again fall  
under the British orders of November, as well as  
under the operation of the French decrees. Our  
cat goes wou:d scarcely have found their way to the  
ocean in search of the boasted market, before they  
would be once more in * state of prohibition, and  
w&#x27;c should in the mean time have incurred the scan­  
dal ot suffering an improvident thirst of gain to se­  
duce us from our principles into a dilemma present­  
ing no alternate e but loss in all the senses of the  
word.  
  
Hut it is not even certain, what Great-Britain  
would herself finally say to such a partial suspension  
oi the embargo. She would doubtless at first ap­  
prove of it. But her ultimate course (especially if  
war between Franee and the United States were not  
the immediate consequence, or if the measure were  
eventually less beneficial to herself, than might be  
supposed at the outset) ought not to be trusted_  
I hat she should approve at first, is hardly to be  
questioned, ,*nd the considerations upon which she  
would do to, are precisely those which should dis­  
suade us from it. Some of these are—the aid it  
would afford to her allies, as well as to her own troops  
co-operating with them, and its consequent tenden­  
cy to destroy every thing like svstem in our conduct  
—it* tendency to embroil us with France, its tenden­  
cy to induce us by overstocking a limned market, to  
make our commodities of no value—to dissipate our  
capital—to ruin our merchants without benefiting  
our agriculture; to destroy our infant manufactures  
without benefitting our commerce ; its tendency to  
habituate us tp a tramelled trade, and to fit us7 for  
acquiescence to a maritime despotism. But there  
Hit r.ei!*lns.: nur trade wilh sPa&#x27;n and Portu­  
gal while it lusted, would be a circuitous one with  
Great-Britain and her colonies, for their benefit —  
Our productions would be carried hi the first instance  
k&quot; *urtu«al» would •&gt;« bought there for  
f f,nd the,r way to the  
VVest-Imlies of enter here, as British convenience

. m££  
as* ■ . &#x27; tgp ■ ■ &quot;*■  
rctr.oveJ as to Great Britain, Mhile it continued .is -  
to France, and we profesed to continue it as to both.  
A nd if any profits should arise jrrfit this sordid traf- i  
fick, they would become a f und, to enable us to ini- i  
port into the United States directly or indirectly the  
manufactures of Great Britain, and thus relieve her  
in another way, while her cfders would prevent us  
trim receiving the commodities of her enemy. Jt  
would &#x27;Hi far better openly to take off the embargo  
as to Great Britain, than while affecting to continue  
it as to that power, to do what must rescue her com­  
pletely (and that too, without advantage to ourselves)  
fr&lt; m the pressure of it, at the same time that it  
would promote her views against France, in Portu­  
gal and Spain.  
As to withdrawing the embargo as to Great Bri­  
tain, as well as Spain and Portugal, while the  
British orders were unrepealed, tire objections  
to that course are just as strong now as they  
were four monlits ago. The change in Spain anil  
Portugal (if it were even likely to last) cannot touch  
the principle of the embargo as regards Great Bri­  
tain, who reasserts her orders of November, in the  
very explanation of the 4th July, tinder which we  
must trade with those countries, if we trade with  
them at all. If we include Great Britain in the sus­  
pension, and exclude France, we do now what we  
have declined to do before, for the sake of a delusive  
commerce, which may perish before it can be enjoyed,  
and cannot in any event be enjoyed with credit, with  
advantage, or ev eu with safety. We take part at  
once with Grea^Britain against France, at a time  
the least suited Tnat could be imagined to such a de­  
termination, at a time when it might be said we  
were emboldened by French rev erses, to do what  
before we could not resolve upon, or even tempted  
by a prospect cf a scanty exaggerated by cur cupidi­  
ty and impatience to forget what was clue to consis­  
tency , to character and permanent prosperity. We  
sanction too the maritime pretensions which insult  
and injure us ; we throw ourselves bound hand and  
foot upon the generosity of a government that has  
hitherto refused us justice, and all this when the af­  
fair of the Chesapeake, ami a host of other wrongs  
are turn-dressed, and when Gt eat Britain has just  
rejected an overture which she must have accepted  
with eagerness, if her views were not such as it be­

j the embargo altogether would be preferable to either  
of the other courses, but would notwithstanding he so  
fatal to us in all respects, that we should long fee!the  
wound it would ir.fiict, unless indeed some other ex­  
pedient,* as strong at least and as efficacious in all  
its bearings, (as 1 fear it c mot) be substituted in its  
place. War would seem to be the unavoidable re­  
sult ol such a step. If our commerce should not flou­  
rish in consequence of this measure, nothing would  
be gained by it but dishonour. And how it conM he  
curried on to any valuable purpose it would be diffi­  
cult to shew—If our commerce should flourish in ;  
spite of trench and British edicts, and the misera&gt; |  
ble state of the world, in spite of war with France,  
that should happen, it would I douht not, be as­  
sailed in some other form. The spirit of monopoly  
lias seized the people and government of this coun­  
try. We shall not under any circumstances he to­  
lerated as rivals in nat igation and trade—it is in vain  
to hope that Great Britain will voluntarily fester the  
naval means of the United States. All her preju­  
dices—all her calculations are against it. F.ven as  
allies wc should be subjects of jealousy. It would be  
endless to enumerate in detail the evils which would  
cling to us in this new career of vassalage and mean­  
ness, and tedious to pursue our backward course to  
the extinction of that very trade to which we had  
sacrificed every tiling else.  
“ the other hand if wc persevere we must gain  
our purpose at last. By complying with the little  
policy of the moment, we shall be lost—By a great  
and systematick adherence to principle, we shall  
find the end to our difficulties. The embargo and  
the loss of our trade are deeply felt here, and will be  
felt with more severity every day—The wheat har­  
vest is likely to be alarmingly short, and the state  
of the continent will augment the evil. The discon­  
tents among their manufacturers are only quieted  
for the moment by temporary causes. Cotton is ri­  
sing and soon will be scarce. Unfavourable events  
in the continent will subdue the temper unfriendly to  
wisdom and justice which now prevails here. But  
above all, the world will I trust be convinced that  
our firmness is not to be shaken. Our measures have  
not been without effect. They have not been deci­  
sive, because we have a t been taught capable of  
persevering in self-denial, which is no more than  
prudent abstinence from destruction and dishonour,  
“ 1 ought to mention that I have been told by a  
most respectable American merchant here, that  
large quantities of such woolen cloths as are prohi­  
bited by our non-import.ition act, have been and con­  
tinut to be sent to Canada , with the view of being  
smuggled into the United States. °  
“ * need not tell you that 1 am induced to trouble  
you with my h sty reflections, because I think you  
stand in need of them. 1 give them merely because  
I believe that you are entitled to know the impressi­  
ons which a publick servant on this side of the wa­
