.  
In the Preface to my last Almanack, I foretold the Death of my dear old Friend and Fellow-Student, the learned and ingenious Mr. Titan Leeds, which was to be on the 17th of October, 1733, 3 h. 29 m. P.M. at the very Instant of the ☌ of ☉ and ☿. By his own Calculation he was to survive till the 26th of the same Month, and expire in the Time of the Eclipse, near 11 a clock, A.M. At which of these Times he died, or whether he be really yet dead, I cannot at this present Writing positively assure my Readers; forasmuch as a Disorder in my own Family demanded my Presence, and would not permit me as I had intended, to be with him in his last Moments, to receive his last Embrace, to close his Eyes, and do the Duty of a Friend in performing the last Offices to the Departed. Therefore it is that I cannot positively affirm whether he be dead or not; for the Stars only show to the Skilful, what will happen in the natural and universal Chain of Causes and Effects; but ’tis well known, that the Events which would otherwise certainly happen at certain Times in the Course of Nature, are sometimes set aside or postpon’d for wise and good Reasons, by the immediate particular Dispositions of Providence; which particular Dispositions the Stars can by no Means discover or foreshow. There is however, (and I cannot speak it without Sorrow) there is the strongest Probability that my dear Friend is no more; for there appears in his Name, as I am assured, an Almanack for the Year 1734, in which I am treated in a very gross and unhandsome Manner; in which I am called a false Predicter, an Ignorant, a conceited Scribler, a Fool, and a Lyar. Mr. Leeds was too well bred to use any Man so indecently and so scurrilously, and moreover his Esteem and Affection for me was extraordinary: So that it is to be feared that Pamphlet may be only a Contrivance of somebody or other, who hopes perhaps to sell two or three Year’s Almanacks still, by the sole Force and Virtue of Mr. Leeds’s Name; but certainly, to put Words into the Mouth of a Gentleman and a Man of Letters, against his Friend, which the meanest and most scandalous of the People might be asham’d to utter even in a drunken Quarrel, is an unpardonable Injury to his Memory, and an Imposition upon the Publick.  
  
Mr. Leeds was not only profoundly skilful in the useful Science he profess’d, but he was a Man of exemplary Sobriety, a most sincere Friend, and an exact Performer of his Word. These valuable Qualifications, with many others so much endear’d him to me, that although it should be so, that, contrary to all Probability, contrary to my Prediction and his own, he might possibly be yet alive, yet my Loss of Honour as a Prognosticator, cannot afford me so much Mortification, as his Life, Health and Safety would give me Joy and Satisfaction. I am, Courteous and kind Reader, Your poor Friend and Servant,

From a dull Razor, and an aking Head,  
From a bad Conscience and a buggy Bed;  
A Blow upon the Elbow and the Knee,

, cold things  
All rot the teeth, and make them look like old things.  
Blame-all and Praise-all are two blockheads.  
Be temperate in wine, in eating, girls, and sloth;  
Or the Gout will seize you and plague you both.  
I Mon. March hath xxxi days.  
Some of our Sparks to London town do go  
Fashions to see, and learn the World to know;  
Who at Return have nought but these to show,  
New Wig above, and new Disease below.  
  
Thus the Jack Ass a Traveller once would be,  
And roam’d abroad new Fashions for to see;  
But home returnxed, Fashions he had none,  
Only his Main and Tail were larger grown.  
No man e’er was glorious, who was not laborious.  
What pains our Justice takes his faults to hide,  
With half that pains sure he might cure ’em quite.  
In success be moderate.  
Take this remark from Richard poor and lame,  
Whate’er’s begun in anger ends in shame.  
What one relishes, nourishes.  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
When Fortune fell asleep, and Hate did blind her,  
Art, Fortune lost; and Ignorance did find her.  
Since when, dull Ignorance with Fortune’s Store  
Hath been inrich’d, and Art hath still been poor.  
Poets say Fortune’s blind, and cannot see,  
But certainly they must deceived be;  
Else could it not most commonly fall out  
That Fools should have and wise Men go without.  
Fools multiply folly.  
Beauty and folly are old companions.  
Hope of gain  
Lessens pain.  
All things are easy to Industry,  
All things difficult to Sloth.  
If you ride a Horse, sit close and tight,  
If you ride a Man, sit easy and light.  
A new truth is a truth, an old error is an error,  
Tho’ Clodpate wont allow either.  
Don’t think to hunt two hares with one dog.

i days.  
Wedlock, as old Men note, hath likened been,  
Unto a publick Crowd or common Rout;  
Where those that are without would fain get in,  
And those that are within would fain get out.  
Grief often treads upon the Heels of Pleasure,  
Marry’d in Haste, we oft repent at Leisure;  
Some by Experience find these Words misplac’d,  
Marry’d at Leisure, they repent in Haste.  
Astrologers say,  
This is a good Day,  
To make Love in May.  
Who pleasure gives,  
Shall joy receive.  
Be not sick too late nor well too soon.  
Where there’s Marriage without Love, there will be Love without Marriage.  
Lawyers, Preachers, and Tomtits Eggs, there are more of them hatch’d than come to perfection.  
Be neither silly, nor cunning, but wise.  
Neither a Fortress nor a Maidenhead will hold out long after they begin to parly.  
IV Mon. June hath xxx days.  
When Robin now three Days had married been,  
And all his Friends and Neighbours gave him Joy;  
This Question of his Wife he asked then,  
Why till her Marriage Day she prov’d so coy?  
Indeed (said he) ’twas well thou didst not yield,  
For doubtless then my Purpose was to leave thee:  
O Sir, I once before was so beguil’d,  
And was resolv’d the next should not deceive me.  
Jack Little sow’d little, and little he’ll reap.  
  
All things are cheap to the saving, dear to the wasteful.  
Would you persuade, speak of Interest, not of Reason.  
Some men grow mad by studying much to know,  
But who grows mad by studying good to grow.  
Happy’s the Wooing, that’s not long a doing.  
V Mon. July hath xxxi days.  
A Lawyer being sick and extream ill  
Was moved by his Friends to make his Will,  
Which soon he did, gave all the Wealth he had  
To frantic Persons, lunatick and mad;  
And to his Friends this Reason did reveal  
(That they might see with Equity he’d deal).  
From Madmen’s Hands I did my Wealth receive,  
Therefore that Wealth to Madmen’s Hands I’ll leave.  
Don’t value a man for the Quality he is of, but for the Qualities he possesses.  
Bucephalus the Horse of Alexander hath as lasting fame as his Master.  
Rain or Snow,  
To Chili go,  
You’ll find it so,  
For ought we know.  
Time will show.  
There have been as great Souls unknown to fame as any of the most famous.  
Do good to thy Friend to keep him, to thy enemy to gain him.  
A good Man is seldom uneasy, an ill one never easie.  
Teach your child to hold his tongue, he’l learn fast enough to speak.  
VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.  
Some envious (speaking in their own Renown)  
Say that my Book was not exactly done:  
  
They wrong me; Yet like Feasts I’d have my Books  
Rather be pleasing to the Guests than Cooks.  
Ill thrives that hapless Family that shows  
A Cock that’s silent, and a Hen that crows:  
I know not which lives more unnatural Lives,  
Obeying Husbands, or commanding Wives.  
He that cannot obey, cannot command.  
An innocent Plowman is more worthy than a vicious Prince

Nor less meant J----h when that Vow he made,

Who, check’d for short and frothy Measure, swore  
He never would from thenceforth fill Pot more.  
An Egg today is better than a Hen to-morrow.  
Drink Water, Put the Money in your Pocket, and leave the Dry-bellyach in the Punchbowl.  
He that is rich need not live sparingly, and he that can live sparingly need not be rich.

My old Friend Berryman, oft, when alive,  
Taught others Thrift; himself could never thrive:  
Thus like the Whetstone, many Men are wont  
To sharpen others while themselves are blunt.  
Strange, that he who lives by Shifts, can seldom shift himself.  
As sore places meet most rubs, proud folks meet most affronts.  
The magistrate should obey the Laws, the People should obey the magistrate.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
*“*In the preface to my last Almanack,”  
Franklin returned, ‘‘ I foretold the death of my  
dear old friend and fellow-student, the learned  
and ingenious Mr. Titan Leeds, which was to be  
the 17th of October, 1733, 3h., 29 m., P.M., at the  
  
very instant of the ¢ of © and $. By his own  
calculation, he was to survive till the 26th of the  
same month, and expire in the time of the eclipse,  
near 11 o&#x27;clock A.M. At which of these times he  
died, or whether he be really yet dead, I cannot  
at this present writing positively assure my read-  
ers ; forasmuch as a disorder in my own family  
demanded my presence, and would not permit  
me, as I had intended, to be with him in his last  
moments, to receive his last embrace, to close his  
eyes, and do the duty of a friend in performing  
the last offices to the departed. Therefore it is  
that I cannot positively affirm whether he be  
dead or not; for the stars only show to the _skil-  
ful what will happen in the natural and universal  
chain of causes and effects ; but ‘tis well known,  
that the events which would otherwise certainly  
happen, at certain times, in the course of nature,  
are sometimes set aside or postpon’d, for wise  
and good reasons, by the immediate farticular  
disposition of Providence ; which particular dis-  
positions the stars can by no means discover or  
foreshow. There is, however (and I can not  
speak it without sorrow), there is the strongest  
probability that my dear friend is no more; for  
there appears in his name, as I am assured, an  
Almanack for the year 1734, in which I am treat-  
ed in a very gross and unhandsome manner, in  
which I am called a false predicter, an ignorant,  
a conceited scribbler, a fool and a lyar. Mr.  
Leeds was too well bred to use any man so inde-  
cently and so scurrilously, and moreover his es-  
teem and affection for me was extraordinary ; so  
that it is to be feared that pamphlet may be only  
a contrivance of somebody or other, who hopes,  
perhaps, to sell two or three years’ Almanacks still,  
by the sole force and virtue of Mr. Leeds’ name.  
But, certainly, to put words into the mouth of a  
gentleman and a man of letters against his friend,  
which the meanest and most scandalous of the  
people might be ashamed to utter even in a  
drunken quarrel, is an unpardonable injury to his  
memory, and-an imposition upon the publick.  
  
‘* Mr. Leeds was not only profoundly skilful in  
the useful science he profess’d, but he was a man  
of exemplary sobriety, a most sincere friend, and  
an exact performer of his word. These valuable  
qualifications, with many others, so much en-  
deared him to me, that although it should be so,  
that, contrary to all probability, contrary to my  
prediction and his own, he might possibly be yet  
alive, yet my loss of honour, as a prognosticator,  
cannot afford me so much mortification as his life,  
health, and safety would give me joy and satis-  
faction. . . .”
