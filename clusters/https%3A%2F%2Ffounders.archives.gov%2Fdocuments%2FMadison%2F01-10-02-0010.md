“Mr. Maddison said he had brought with him a strong prepossession for the defining of the limits and powers of the federal Legislature, but he brought with him some doubts about the practicability of doing it:—at present he was convinced it could not be done” (Farrand, RecordsMax Farrand, ed., The Records of the  
Federal Convention of 1787 (4 vols.; New Haven, 1911–37)., I, 60).  
  
  
According to Pierce, during this debate JM had also commented prior to this speech: “it was necessary to adopt some general principles on which we should act,—that we were wandering from one thing to another without seeming to be settled in any one principle” (ibid., I, 60).  
  
  
  
  
  
[31 May 1787]  
The coercive-power clause of the sixth resolution, authorizing the use of force against a state “failing to fulfill its duty” to the Union, was under debate.  
Mr. Madison, observed that the more he reflected on the use of force, the more he doubted, the practicability, the justice and the efficacy of it when applied to people collectively and not individually. A Union of the States containing such an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction. The use of force agst. a State, would look more like a declaration of war, than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound. He hoped that such a system would be framed as might render this recourse unnecessary, and moved that the clause be postponed.

After “postponed,” JM deleted “till the contrary should be found on trial to be the case,” a change he made before Eppes copied the Debates. Many years later JM explained that the coercive-power clause was “suggested by the inefficiency of the Confederate system, from the want of such a sanction; none such b
