e 3d was delivered me at court: but we were much disappointed at not seeing you here, mr Madison &amp; the Govr. being here at the time. I inclose you a letter from Monroe on the subject of the late treaty. you will observe a hint in it to do without delay what we are bound to do. there is reason, in the opinion of our ministers, to believe that if the thing were to do over again, it could not be obtained; &amp; that if we give the least opening they will declare the treaty void. a warning amounting to that has been given to them, &amp; an unusual kind of letter written by their minister to our Secretary of state direct. whatever Congress shall think it necessary to do, should be done with as little debate as possible; &amp; particularly so far as respects the constitutional difficulty. I am aware of the force of the observations you make on the power given by the Constn to Congress to admit new states into the Union, without restraining the subject to the territory then constituting the US. but when I consider that the limits of the US. are precisely fixed by the treaty of 1783. that the constitution expressly declares itself to be made for the US. I cannot help believing the intention was to permit Congress to admit into the union new states which should be formed out of the territory for which &amp; under whose authority alone they were then acting. I do not believe it was meant that they might recieve England, Ireland, Holland &amp;c into it, which would be the case on your construction. when an instrument admits two constructions the one safe, the other dangerous, the one precise the other indefinite, I prefer that which is safe &amp; precise. I had rather ask an enlargement of power from the nation where it is found necessary, than to assume it by a construction which would make our powers boundless. our peculiar security is in the possession of a written constitution. let us not make it a blank paper by construction. I say the same as to the opinion of those who consider the grant of the treaty making power as boundless. if it is, then we have no constitution. if it has bounds, they can be no others than the definitions of the powers which that instrument gives. it specifies &amp; delineates the operations permitted to the federal government, and gives all the powers necessary to carry these into execution. whatever of these enumerated objects is proper for a law, Congress may make the law. whatever is proper to be executed by way of a treaty, the President &amp; Senate may enter into the treaty; whatever is to be done by a judicial sentence, the judges may pass the sentence. nothing is more likely than that their enumeration of powers is defective. this is the ordinary case of all human works. let us go on then perfecting it, by adding by way of amendment to the constitution, those powers which time &amp; trial shew are still wanting. but it has been taken too much for granted that by this rigorous construction the treaty power would be reduced to nothing. I had occasion once to examine it’s effect on the French treaty made by the old Congress, &amp; found that out of thirty odd articles which that contained there were one, two, or three only which could not now be stipulated under our present constitution. I confess then I think it important in the present case to set an example against broad construction by appealing for new power to the people. if however our friends shall think differently, certainly I shall acquiesce with satisfaction, confiding that the good sense of our country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill effects.—no apologies for writing or speaking to me freely are necessary. on the contrary nothing my friends can do, is so dear to me, &amp; proves to me their friendship so clearly, as the information they give me of their sentiments &amp; those of others on interesting points where I am to act, and where information &amp; warning are so essential to excite in m

Mr. Jefferson, when urging the acquisition of the  
Louiaiana territory —a measure, which, though sim-  
ilar, is less ebjectionable than the annexation of  
Texas, in a constitntional point of view,—writes  
thus to a friend—‘ When I consider that the limits  
of the United States are precisely fixed by the  
treaty of 1783, that the Constitution expressly de-  
cleres itself made for the United States, I cannot  
help believing that the intention was not to perinit  
Congress to admitiuto the Union new states, which  
should be formed out of the territory, for which, and  
onder whese authority alone, they were then acting.

‘Whatever Congress should think it necessary  
to do; should be done with as little debate as pos-  
sible, and particularly so far as respects the con-  
stitutional difficuly. I am aware of the force of  
the observations you make on the power given  
by the Constitution to Congress to admit new  
States into the Union, without restraining the sub-  
ject to the territory then constiwting the United  
States. But whea I consider that the limits of  
the United States are precisely fixed by the treaty  
of 1783, that the Constituuon expressly declares  
itself to be made for the United States, I cannot help  
believing the intention was not to permit Con-  
gress to admit into the Union new States, which  
should be formed out of the territory for which, and  
under whose authority alone, they were then acting.  
I do not believe it was meant that they might receive  
England, Ireland, Holland, &amp;c. into it, which  
would be the case on your construction. When  
an instrument admit 2 constructions, the one safe,  
the other indefinite, I prefer that which is safe and  
precise. I had rather ask an enlargement of pow-  
er from the nation, where it is found necessary,  
than to assume it by a construction which would  
make our powers boundless. Our peculiar secu-  
rity is in the possession of a written Constitution.  
Let us not make it a blank paper by construction.  
Isay the same as to the opinion of those who con-  
sider the grant of the treaty-making power as  
boundless. Ifit is, then we have no Constitution.  
If it has bounds, they can be no others than the  
definitions of the powers which that instrument  
gives. It specifies and delineates the operations  
permitted in the Federal Government, and gives  
all the powers necessary to carry these into execu-  
tion. Whatever of these enumerated objects is  
proper fur a law, Congress may make the law;  
whatever is proper to be executed by way of a  
treaty, the President and Senate may enter into  
the treaty; whatever is to be done by a judicial  
sentence, the judges may pass the sentence.—  
Nothing is more Tikely than that their enumera-  
tion of powers is defective. ‘This is the ordinary  
ease of all human works. Let us go on then  
perfecting it, by adding by way of amendment  
to the Gonstitation, those powers which time  
and trial show are still wanting, But it has been-  
taken too much for granted that by this rigor-  
ous construction the treaty-power would be re-  
duced to nothing. I had occasion once to exam-  
ine its effect on the French treaty, made by the  
old Congress, and found that out of thirty odd arti-  
cles which that contained, there were one, two or  
three only, which could now be stipulated under our  
present Constitution. I confess, then, I think it  
important, in the present case, to set an example  
against broad construction, by appealing for new  
power tothe People. If, however, our friends  
shall think differently, certainly I shall acquiesce  
with satisfaction; confiding that the good sense of  
our country will correct the evil of construction,  
when it shall produce ill effects.”’—Jefferson’s  
Writings, vol. IV. p. 2.  
  
That was in September, 1803. There are oth-  
ers. One was written to Dr. Sibley, in all which  
he expressed, in terms quite as strong as those I

I enclose you a letter from Munroe on the subject of the  
late treaty: You will observe a hint in it, to do without delay  
what we are bound to do. There is reason, in the opinion of  
our Ministers, to believe, that if the thing ware to do over  
again, it could not be obtained, and that if we give the least  
opening they will decree the treaty void. A warning amount­  
ing to this has been given to them, and an unusual kind of  
e e pe  
  
ent  
letter written by their Minister to our Secretary of State, di­  
rect. Whatever Congress shall think it necesrary to do,  
should be done with af little debate as possible, and particue  
larly so far as resrects the constitutional difficulty. I am  
awate of the ferce of the observations you make on the power  
given by the Constitution to Congress, to admit new states  
fato the Usior, without rest aining the subject to the territ  
a en constituting the United States. But when I consider that  
the limits of the United States are precisely fixed by the treaty  
of 1787, that the Consitution expressly declares itself to be  
made för the U. States, I cannot pelo believing the intention  
was norto permit Cor gress to admit into the Union new Staes,  
whichshould be formed out of the territory for which, and une  
der whose authority alone they were then acting. I do not be  
lieve if was meant that they might receive England, Ireland,  
Holland. &amp;c into it, which would be the case on our construc  
tion. When an instrument admits two constructions, the one  
sfe th other dangerous, the one precise, the otherind finite,I  
prefer that which is safe and precise. I had rather ask an en  
largement of power from the nation, where it is found necese  
sary, than to assume it by const uction, which would make  
our powers boundless. Our peculiar security is in the pos-  
session of a wiitten Constitution. Let us not make it a blank  
paper by construction. I say the same as to the opinion of  
these who consider the grant of the treaty-making pawer as  
boundiss. If it is then we have no Constitution. If it has  
bounds, they can be no others than the defi itions of the pow-  
ers which that instrument gives. It specifies and Celineates  
the operations permitted to the Federal Government, andgives  
all the powers necessary to carry these into execution. What­  
ever of these enumerated objects is proper for a law, Congress  
may make the lwy whatever is propeer to be executed by way  
of ateaty, the President and Senate may enter into the trear

Mr. Monroe had written from Paris that there was reason to  
believe that, if the thing were to be done over again, it could  
not be obtained, and that if the least opening was given, the

no residuary powers, only such as were distinctly created by  
that instrument. At the same time he knew that nothing  
must be said that would give France a pretext for retracting.

necessary, than to assume it by a construction that would  
make our powers boundless. Our peculiar security is in the  
possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a  
blank paper by construction. I say the same as to the opin-  
ion of those who consider the grant of the treaty-making  
power as boundless. If it is, then we have no Constitution.  
If it has bounds they can be no others than the definitions  
of powers which that instrument gives. * * * What-  
ever is proper to be executed by way of a treaty, the Presi-  
dent and Senate may enter into the treaty. Nothing is more  
likely than that this enumeration of powers is defective.  
Let us go on then perfecting it by way of amendment to the  
Constitution.”*
