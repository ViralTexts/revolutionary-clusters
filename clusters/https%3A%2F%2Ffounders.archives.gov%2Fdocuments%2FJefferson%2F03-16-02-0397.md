At home things are not well. the flood of paper money, as you well know, had produced an exaggeration of nominal prices and at the same time a facility of obtaining money, which not only encouraged speculations on fictitious capital, but seduced those of real capital, even in private life, to contract debts too freely. had things continued in the same course, these might have been manageable. but the operations of the U.S. bank for the demolition of the state banks, obliged these suddenly to call in more than half their paper, crushed all fictitious and doubtful capital, and reduced the prices of property and produce suddenly to ⅓ of what they had been. wheat, for example, at the distance of two or three days from market, fell to, and continues at from one third to half a dollar. should it be stationary at this for a while, a very general revolution of property must take place. something of the same character has taken place in our fiscal system. a little while back Congress seemed at a loss for objects whereon to squander the supposed fathomless funds of our treasury. this short frenzy has been arrested by a deficit of 5 millions the last year, and of 7. millions this year. a loan was adopted for the former and is proposed for the latter, which threatens to saddle us with a perpetual debt. I hope a tax will be preferred, because it will awaken the attention of the people, and make reformation &amp; economy the principles of the next election. the frequent recurrence of this chastening operation can alone restrain the propensity of governments to enlarge expence beyond income. the steady tenor of the courts of the US. to break down the constitutional barriers between the coordinate barriers powers of the States, and of the Union, and a formal opinion lately given  by 5. lawyers of too much eminence to be neglected, give uneasiness. but nothing has ever presented so threatening an aspect as what is called the Missouri question. the Federalists compleatly put down, and despairing of ever rising again under the old division of whig and tory, devised a new one, of slave-holding, &amp; non-slave-holding states, which, while it had a semblance of being Moral, was at the same time Geographical, and calculated to give them ascendancy by debauching their old opponents to a coalition with them. Moral the question certainly is not, because the removal of slaves from one state to another, no more than their removal from one county to another, would never make a slave of one human being who would not be so without it. indeed if there were any reality morality in the question, it is on the other side; because by spreading them over a larger surface, their happiness would be increased, &amp; the burthen of their future liberation lightened by bringing a greater number of shoulders under it. however it served to throw dust into the eyes of the people and to fanaticise them, while to the knowing ones it gave a geographical and preponderant line of the Patomac and Ohio, throwing 14. states to the North and East, &amp; 10. to the South &amp; West. with these therefore it is merely a question of power: but with this geographical minority it is a question of existence. for if Congress once goes out of the Constitution to  arrogate a right of regulating the condition of the inhabitants of the states, it’s majority may, and probably will next declare that the condition of all men within the US. shall be that of freedom. in which case all the whites South of the Patomak and Ohio must evacuate their states; and most fortunate those who can do it first. and so far this crisis seems to be advancing. the Missouri question constitution is recently rejected by the House of Representatives. what will be their next step is yet to be seen. if if accepted on the condition that Missouri shall expunge from it the prohibition of free people of colour from emigration to their state, it will be expunged, and all will be quieted until the advance of some new state shall pres

“Nothing has ever presented so threatening  
an aspect as what is called the Missouri ques­  
tion. The Federalists,completely put down and  
despairing of ever rising again under Whig and  
Tory names, devised a new one, of slavehold­  
ing and non-slaveholding States, which, while  
it had a semblance of being moral, was at the  
same time geographical, and calculated to give  
them ascendency by debauching their old op­  
ponents to a coalition with them. Moral the  
question certainly is not, because the removal  
cf slaves from one State to another no more  
than their removal from one country to anoth­  
er would never make a slave of one human be­  
ing who would not be so without it. Indeed,  
if there is any morality in the question, it is on  
the other side • because by spreading them  
over a large surface, their happiness would be  
increased, and the burden of their future libe­  
ration lightened by bringing a greater number  
of shoulders under it. However, it seemed  
to throw dust into the eyes of the people, and  
to lanaticise them, while to the knowing ones,  
it gave a geographical and preponderating line  
to the Potomac and the Ohio, throwing four­  
teen States to the north and east and ten to  
the south and west. With these, therefore, it  
is a question of power. But with the geo­  
graphical minority, it is a question of exist­  
ence. For if Congress once goes out of the  
Constitution to arrogate the right of regulating  
the condition of the inhabitants of the States,  
its majority may, and probably will, declare  
that the condition of all within the United  
States shall be that of freemen, in which case  
ail the whites south of the Potomac and the  
Ohio must evacuate their States, and most for­  
tunate, those who can do it first.”  
  
Having proved that this Republican  
movement is an innovation, and that it
