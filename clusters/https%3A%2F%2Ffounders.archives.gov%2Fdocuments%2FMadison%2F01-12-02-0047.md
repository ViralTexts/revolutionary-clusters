an application to the resources mentioned in the list of articles just proposed by the gentleman from Pennsylvania.  
I presume, that however much we may be disposed to promote domestic manufactures, we ought to pay some regard to the present policy of obtaining revenue. It may be remarked also, that by fixing on a temporary expedient for this purpose, we may gain more than we shall lose by suspending the consideration of the other subject, until we obtain fuller information of the state of our manufactures. We have at this time the strongest motives for turning our attention to the point I have mentioned; every gentleman sees that the prospect of our harvest from the spring importations is daily vanishing; and if the committee delay levying and collecting an impost, until a system of protecting duties shall be perfected, there will be no importations of any consequence, on which the law is to ope

 the one hand, to weigh and regard the sentiments of the gentlemen from the different parts of the United States; but on the other hand, we must limit our consideration on this head, and notwithstanding all the deference and respect we pay to those sentiments, we must consider the general interest of the union, for this is as much every gentleman’s duty to consider as is the local or state interest—and any system of impost that this committee will adopt, must be founded on the principles of mutual concession.  
Gentlemen will be pleased to recollect that those parts of the union which contribute more under one system than the other, are also those parts more thinly planted, and consequently stand most in need of national protection—therefore they will have less reason to complain of unequal burthens.  
There is another consideration. The states that are most advanced in population and ripe for manufactures, ought to have their particular interest attended to in some degree. While these states retained the power of making regulations of trade, they had the power to protect and cherish such institutions; by adopting the present constitution they have thrown the exercise of this power into other hands—they must have done this with an expectation, that those interests would not be neglected here.  
I am afraid, Sir, on the one hand, that if we go fully into a discussion of the subject, we shall consume more time than prudence would dictate to spare; on the other hand, if we do not develop it and see the principles on which we mutually act, we shall subject ourselves to great difficulties. I beg leave therefore to state the grounds on which my opinion with respect to the matter under consideration is founded, namely, whether our present system should be a temporary or permanent one? In the first place, I own myself the friend to a very free system of commerce, and hold it as a truth, that commercial shackles are generally unjust, oppressive and impolitic—it is also a truth, that if industry and labour are left to take their own course, they will generally be directed to those objects which are the most productive, and this in a more certain and direct manner than the wisdom of the most enlightened legislature could point out. Nor do I think that the national interest is more promoted by such restrictions, than that the interest of individuals would be promoted by legislative interference directing the particular application of its industry. For example, we should find no advantage in saying, that every man should be obliged to furnish himself by his own labor with those accommodations which depend upon the mechanic arts, instead of employing his neighbour, who could do it for him on better terms. It would be of no advantage to the shoemaker to make his own clothes to save the expence of the taylor’s bill, nor of the taylor to make his own shoes to save the expence of procuring them from the shoemaker. It would be better policy to suffer each to employ his talent in his own way; the case is the same between the exercise of the arts and agriculture—between the city and the country, and between city and town, each capable of making particular articles in sufficient abundance to supply the other—thus all are benefitted by exchange, and the less this exchange is cramped by government, the greater are the proportions of benefit to each. The same argument holds good between nation and nation, and between parts of the same nation.  
In my opinion, it would be proper also, for gentlemen to consider the means of encouraging the great staple of America, I mean agriculture, which I think may justly be stiled the staple of the United States; from the spontaneous productions which nature furnishes, and the manifest preference it has over every other object of emolument in this country. If we compare the cheapness of our land with that of other nations, we see so decided an advantage in that cheapness, as to have full confidence of being unrivaled; with respect to the object of manufacture, other countries may and do rival us; but we may be said to have a monopoly in agriculture. The possession of the soil and the lowness of its price, give us as much a monopoly in this case, as any nation or other parts of the world have in the monopoly of any article whatever; but, with this advantage to us, that it cannot be shared nor injured by rivalship.  
If my general principle is a good one, that commerce ought to be free, and labour and industry left at large to find its proper object, the only thing which remains, will be to discover the exceptions that do not come within the rule I have laid down. I agree with the gentleman from Pennsylvania, that there are exceptions, important in themselves and claim the particular attention of the committee: Altho the freedom of commerce would be advantageous to all the world, yet, in some particulars, one nation might suffer, to benefit others, and this ought to be for the general good of society.  
If America was to leave her ports perfectly free, and make no discrimination between vessels owned by her citizens and those owned by foreigners, while other nations make this discrimination, it is obvious that such policy would go to exclude American shipping altogether from foreign ports, and she would be materially affected in one of her most important interests; to this we may add another consideration, that by encouraging the means of transporting our productions with facility, we encourage the raising them: and this object, I apprehend, is likely to be kept in view by the general government.  
Duties laid on imported articles may have an effect which comes within the idea of national prudence; It may happen that materials for manufactures may grow up without any encouragement for this purpose; it has been the case in some of the states, but in others, regulations have been provided and have succeeded in producing some establishment, which ought not to be allowed to perish, from the alteration which has taken place: It would be cruel to neglect them and divert their industry to other channels, for it is not possible for the hand of man to shift from one employment to another, without being injured by the change. There may be some manufactures, which being once formed, can advance toward perfection without any adventitious aid, while others for want of the fostering hand of government will be unable to go on at all. Legislative attention will therefore be necessary to collect the proper objects for this purpose, and this will form an other exception to my general principle.  
I observe that a sumptuary prohibition is within the view of some of the proposed articles and forms another exception; I acknowledge that I do not in general think any great national advantage arises from restrictions passed on this head, because as long as a distinction in point of value subsists, sumptuary duties in some form or other will prevail and take effect.  
Another exception is embargoes in time of war; these may necessarily occur and shackle the freedom of commerce; but the reasons for this are so obvious, that it renders any remark unnecessary.  
The next exception that occurs, is one on which great stress is laid by some well informed men, and this with great plausibility. That each nation should have within itself, the means of defence independent of foreign supplies: That in whatever relates to the operation of war, no state ought to depend upon a precarious supply from any part of the world: There may be some truth in this remark, and therefore it is proper for legislative attention. I am though, well persuaded that the reasoning on this subject has been carried too far. The difficulties

ed. I have no objection to the committees accepting the propositions offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, because so far as we can enumerate the proper objects and apply specific duties to them, we conform to the practice prevalent in many of the states, and adopt the most laudable method of collecting revenue, at least preferable to laying a general tax. Whether therefore we consult ease and convenience in collection, or pursuing habits already adopted and approved, specific duties as far as the articles can properly be enumerated is the more eligible mode of obtaining the end in contemplation—upon the whole, as I think some of the propositions may be productive of revenue, and some may protect our domestic manufacture, tho’ the latter subject ought not to be too confusedly blended with the former,

Mr. Madison. “Regulations hare been pro­  
vided, (in some of the States,) and have suc­  
ceeded in producing some establishments,  
which ought not to be allowed to perish from the  
alteration which has taken place It would be  
cruel to neglect them, and direct their industry  
to other channels; for it is not possible for the  
hand of man »o shift from one employment to  
another, without being injured by the change.  
There may be some manufactures, which, be­  
ing once formed,can advance toward perfection  
without any adventitious aid: while others, for  
want of the fostering hand of Government, will be  
unable logo on al all. Legislative attention will,  
therefore, be necessary, to collect the proper objects  
for this purpose.&quot;—Lloyd’s Debates, Vol. I p. 26.  
The same.—“The States that are most ad­  
vanced in population, and ripe for manufactures,  
ought to have their particular interests attended to  
m some degree.. \V hile these States retained the  
power ol making regulations of trade, they had  
the power to protect and cherish such institu­  
tions; by adopting the present Constitution, they  
have thrown the exercise of this power into  
other hands: they must have done this with an  
expectation that those interests would not be neg­  
lected here.&quot;—Idem, p. 24.  
General Washington’s sentiments on the sub­  
ject, are certainly entitled to great attention.  
In his Message to Congress, 1790, he states—

ty of a protective policy at the present time.—  
The unjust discriminations of foreign govern­  
ments against our trade, and the condition of the  
manufactures, which have been brought into ex­  
istence by the action of the government, contri­  
bute most potent arguments in favor of the Tariff  
of 1«S42. l&gt;ut read Mr. Madison&#x27;s own words :  
&quot;if my general principle is a good one, that  
1 commerce ought to be tree, and labor and indus­  
I try left at large to find its proper object, the on- :  
ly thin;r which remains will be to discover the ;  
exceptions that do not come within theiulc 1  
have laid down. 1 agree with the gentleman  
from Pennsylvania, that there areexceptions, im- j  
portant in themselves, and which claim the par- j  
ticuli»r attention of the committee. Although  
the freedom of commerce would be advantage- j  
ous to the world, yet, in some particulars, one  
nation might suffer to benefit others, and this j  
ought to be for the general good of socety.  
&quot;If America were to leave lier ports perfectly  
free, and make no discrimination between ves­  
sels owned by her citizens and those owned by ,  
foreigners, while other nations make this discrim­  
ination, it is obvious that such policy would go to ;  
exclude American shipping altogether from for- j  
eign ports and she would be materially affected &#x27;  
in one of her most important interests. To this j  
we may add another consideration, that by en­  
couraging the means of transporting our produc- j  
tior.s with facility, we encourage the raising them: !  
and this object, 1 apprehend, is likely to be kept &#x27;  
in view by the (Jeneral Government.  
&quot;Duties laid on imported articles may have an j

prudence. It may happen that materials fur man­  
ufactures may grow up without any encourage­  
ment fur this purpose. It has been the ea&gt;e in j  
some of the States; but in others, regulations !  
have been provided, and have succeeded in pro- j  
ducing some establishments, which ought not to he j  
allowed to perish, from the alteration which has ta- j  
ken place. It would bz cruel to neglect them, and  
divert their industry to other channels: for it is not  
possible for the hand of man to shift from one !  
employment to another, without being injured 1  
by the change. There may be some manufactu­  
res, which, being once formed, can advance to· j  
wards perfection, without any adventitious aid, ;  
while others, for want of the fostering hand of i  
Government will be unable to go on at all. Leg­  
islative attention will therefore ho necessary to  
collect the proper objects for this purpose, and  
this will form another exception to vvj general prin­  
ciple.  
In continuation, Mr. Madison expressed his  
willingness to accept the duties proposed by Mr.

discussion, if a permanent tariff system were then  
proposed, and which he had desired to avoid; and  
amongst others, that it might be considered it  
those States which were more ripe for manufac­  
tures than other?, in surrendering this power lo  
protect and cherish them, must not have expect­  
ed thai iheir interests would noi be neglected by  
Congress?he ptoceedsas follows,fp. 116]:  
&quot;I am airaid, sir, on the one hand, that il we eo  
lully into ihe discussion ot the sulject, we shall  
cons-ume more time ihan prudence would dictate  
lo spare; on the other hand, if we do not devel­  
opc it, and see the principles on which we mutu­  
ally act, we shall subject ourselves to great diffi­  
culties. 1 beg leave, therefore, &#x27;o siate the grounds  
on which my opinion wiih respect to the matter  
under consideraiion is founded, namely: whether  
our system should be a temporary or permanent  
one. In ihe first place, I own myself the friend lo  
a very free system ot commerce, and hold it as a  
truth, that commercial shackles are generally un­  
just, oppressive and impolitic. It is also a truih,  
thai if iudustry and labor are left to take their  
own course, they will generally be directed to  
ihose objects which are the most productive ; and  
this in a more certain and direct manner than the  
wisdom of the most enlightened legislaune could  
point out. iN&#x27;or do I think that the national inte­  
rest is more promoted by such restriction* than  
ihat the interest ot individuals would be promo­  
ted by legislative interference directing the parti­  
cular application ot its industry. For example,  
we should find no advan.age in say ma that every  
man should be obliged to iurnish himself by his  
own labor, with those accommodations which de­  
peo i on ihe mechanic arts, instead of employing  
his neighbour, who couid do it for him on better  
&#x27;errns. It would be of no advantage to the shoe­  
maker to make his own clothes, to save me ex­  
pense of the tailor&#x27;s bill; nor of the tailor to make  
his own shoes, to save the expense of procuriusr  
hem from ihe shoemaker. It would be belter  
policy to suffer each of them toemploy his talents  
in his own way. The ease is the same between  
the exercise ot ihe aris and agriculture?between  
ihe city and ihe country?and between city and  
town?each capable ot making particular arti­  
cles in abundance to supply ihe other: thus a.l  
aie benefited by exchange; and the less this ex­  
change is cramped by government, the greater  
are tne proportions of benefit to each. I he same  
argument holds gooJ between rations, and be*  
tween parts of ihe same nation.&quot;

porter in this extract. The word &quot;namely, lor

&quot;Although the freedom of commerce  
would be advantageous to the world, yet  
in some particulars one nation might suf­  
fer to benefit others. If Amer­  
ica was to leave her ports perfectly free,  
and make no difcrimination between  
vessels owned by her citisens and those  
owned by foreigners, while other na­  
tions make this discrimination, it is ob­  
vious that such a policy would exclude  
American Shipping altogether from for­  
eign ports and she would lie materially af­  
fectodin one of her mostimportiint inter­  
ests. To this we may add another consid­  
eration, that by encouraging the means of  
  
transportation lor- our productions we  
encourage the raising of them, and this  
object, 1 apprehend, is likely to be kept

another without being injured by the

tures which being once formed can ad­  
vance toward perfection without any  
advantitions aid, while others from want  
of the fostering hand of the Government  
will be unable to go on at all. Legisla­

would be advantageous to the world,  
yet in some particulars one nation  
might suffer to benefit others. * *  
if America was to leave her ports  
perfectly free, and make no discrim­  
ination between vessels owned by  
Iter citizens and those owned by for­  
eigners, while other nations make  
this discrimination,it is obvious that  
such a policy would exclude Amort  
can shipping altogether from foreign  
ports and she would be materially  
uHected in one of her most important  
interests. To this we may add an­  
other consideration, that by encour­  
aging the means of transportation  
for our productions we encourage  
the raising of them, and this object,  
I apprehend, is likely to be kept in  
view by the General Government.—  
Duties laid on imported articles may  
have an tfifc.ct which comes within  
the idea of national prudence. It  
may happen that materials tor man­  
ulaclures may grow up without any  
encouragement for this purpose. If  
it has been the case iu some of the  
States,but in others regulations have  
been provided and have succeeded  
in producing some establishments  
which ought not to be allowed to  
perish from the alteration which ha?  
taken place.it would be efuel to neg­  
lect them and divert their industriei  
to other channels. It is not possible  
for the hand of men to shift from ont  
employment to another without be  
ing injured by tfie change. There  
may be some manufactures which be  
ing once formed can advance toward  
perfection without aDy adventitious  
aid, while others from want of th&lt;  
fostering hand of the Govermneii  
will bo unable to go on at ulh Le  
gislative attention will therefore hi

the city and the country and between

in their own hands the power of regulating trade,  
they had the power to cherish and protect their  
own manufactures; but as they had now thrown  
this power into other hands they must have done  
so in the confidence that their interests would not  
be neglected or overlooked by the new Congress.  
He then proceeded to state the principles which he  
thought should govern the legislation. He avowed  
himself to be a friend to a very free system of  
commerce, regarding it as a truth that commercial  
shackles are generally unjust, oppressive and ime­

own course, will generally be most productive, and  
in a more direct and certain way, than the wis

whatever, and with this advantage that it would  
not be shared or injured by rivalship. The interest  
of navigation was the next exception; for if Amers

no discrimination between vessels owned by her  
citizens and those owned by foreigners, while other
