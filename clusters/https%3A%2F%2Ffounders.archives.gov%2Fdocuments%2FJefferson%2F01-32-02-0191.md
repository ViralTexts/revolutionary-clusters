?It is proper that every Parliamentary body should have certain forms of question, so adapted, as to enable them fitly to dispose of every proposition which can be made to them. such are 1. the Previous question. 2. to Postpone indefinitely. 3. to adjourn a question to a definite day. 4. to lie on the table. 5. to commit. 6. to amend. the proper occasion for each of these questions should be understood.1. When a proposition is moved, which it is useless or inexpedient now to express or discuss, the Previous Question has been introduced for suppressing for that time the motion &amp; it’s discussion.2. But as the Previous question gets rid of it only for that day, it may be postponed indefinitely, after which it cannot be moved again during that session.3. When a motion is made which it will be proper to act on, but information is wanted, or something more pressing claims the present time, it is adjourned to such day within the session as will answer the views of the house. sometimes however

By arule of the House it was provided that  
amotion to strike out the enacting clause of a  
bill should take precedence of a pending amend-  
  
ment. This motion to strike out the enacting  
clause was a motion to destroy the bill, which

posed to the whole paper or bill, and think itcannot be made |  
good by amendment, the committee cannot reject it, but  
must report it back to the House without amendment, and |

Whole struck out the first and only section of a bill, and |  
so reported to the House. Mr. Speaker Cheves refused to |
