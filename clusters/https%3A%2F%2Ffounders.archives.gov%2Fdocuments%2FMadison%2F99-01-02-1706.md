		Department of State May 20th. 1807  
					  
					My letter of March 18th. acknowledged the receipt of your dispatches and of the Treaty signed on the 31st. of December, of which Mr Purviance was the bearer, and signified that the sentiments and views of the President formed on the actual posture of our  
						affairs with Great Britain, would without any needless delay, be communicated. The subject is accordingly resumed, in this dispatch, with which Mr Purviance will be charged. To render his passage the more sure and convenient, he takes it in the sloop of war, the Wasp, which  
						will convey him to a British port, on her way to the Mediterranean. She will touch also at a French port, probably L’Orient, with dispatches for Genl. Armstrong and Mr Bowdoin, and will afford a good opportunity for any communications you may have occasion to make to those  
						gentlemen.  
					The President has seen in your exertions to accomplish the great objects of your instructions, ample proofs of that zeal and patriotism in which he confided; and feels deep regret that your success has not corresponded with the reasonableness of your  
						propositions, and the ability with which they were supported. He laments, more especially, that the British Government has not yielded to the just and cogent considerations which forbid the practice of its cruizers in visiting and impressing the crews of our vessels, covered  
						by an independant flag, and guarded by the laws of the high seas, which ought to be sacred with all nations.  
					The President continues to regard this subject in the light in which it has been pressed on the justice and friendship of Great Britain. He cannot reconcile it with his duty to our sea faring Citizens, or with the sensibility or sovereignty of the nation,  
						to recognize, even constructively, a principle that would expose on the high seas, their liberty, their lives, every thing in a word that is dearest to the human heart, to the capricious or interested sentences which may be pronounced against their allegiance, by officers of  
						a foreign Government, whom neither the law of nations, nor even the laws of that Government, will allow to decide on the ownership or character of the minutest article of property found in a like situation.  
					It has a great and necessary weight also with the President, that the views of Congress, as manifested during the Session which passed the Non-importation Act, as well as the primary rank held by the object of securing American Crews against British  
						impressment, among the objects which suggested the solemnity of an Extraordinary mission, are opposed to any Conventional arrangement, which, without effectually providing for that object, would disarm the United States of the means deemed most eligible as an eventual  
						remedy.  
					It is considered, moreover, by the President the more reasonable that the necessary concession in this case should be made by Great Britain, rather than by the United States, on the double consideration; first, that a concession on our part would violate  
						both a moral and political duty of the Government, to our Citizens; which would not be the case, on the other side; secondly that a greater number of American Citizens, than of British subjects are, in fact, impressed from our vessels; and that, consequently, more of wrong is  
						done to the United States, than of right to Great Britain; taking even her own claim, for the legal criterion.  
					On these grounds, the President is constrained to decline any arrangement, formal or informal, which does not comprize a provision against impressments from American vessels on the High seas, and which would, notwithstanding, be a bar to Legislative  
						measures, such as Congress have thought, or may think proper, to adopt for controuling that species of aggression.  
					Persevering at the same time in his earnest desire to establish the harmony of the two Nations on a proper foundation, and calculating on the motives which must be equally felt by Great Britain to secure that important object, it is his intention that your  
						efforts should be renewed, with a view to such alterations of the instrument signed on the 31 Decr., as may render it acceptable to the United States.  
					That you may the more fully understand his impressions and purposes, I will explain the alterations which are to be regarded as essential; and proceed then to such observations on the several articles, as will shew the other alterations which are to be  
						attempted, and the degree of importance respectively attached to them.  
					lst. Without a provision against impressments, substantially such as is contemplated in your original instructions, no Treaty is to be concluded.  
					2d. The eleventh Article on the subject of Colonial trade cannot be admitted, unless freed from the conditions which restrict to the market of Europe, the re exportation of Colonial produce, and to European Articles, the supplies to the Colonial market.  
					3 The change made by the 3d. article in the provisions of the Treaty of 1794, relative to the Trade with the British possessions in India, by limiting the privilege to a direct trade from the United States, as well as to them, is deemed an insuperable objection.  
					4th. Either an express provision is to be insisted on indemnifying sufferers from wrongful captures, or at least a saving, in some form or other, of their rights against any implied abandonment.  
					5. Articles 18 &amp; 19 To be so altered as to leave the United States free as a neutral nation to keep and place other belligerent nations on an equality with Great Britain.  
					6 Such an alternative as is presented by the declaratory note on the subject of the French decree of Novr. 21 1806, will be inadmissible.  
					1 The considerations which render a provision on the subject of impressments, indispensable, have been already sufficiently explained.  
					2 The essential importance of the amendment required in the llth. article, results from the extensive effect which the article, if unamended, would have on the system of our commerce as hitherto carried on, with the sanction or acquiescence of Great Britain  
						herself.  
					It was hoped that the British Government, in regulating the subject of this article, would at least have yielded to the example of its Treaty with Russia. It could not have been supposed, that a modification would be insisted on, which shuts to our neutral  
						commerce important channels, left open by the adjudications of British Courts, and particularly by the principle officially communicated by that Government to this, thro’ Mr King in the year 1801.  
					According to that principle and those adjudications, the indirect trade thro’ our neutral ports was as free, from enemy Colonies to every other part of the world, as to Europe; and as free, to such Colonies, in the articles of all other Countries, as in  
						European articles.  
					According to the tenor of the article, and the general prohibitory principle assumed by Great Britain, to which it has an implied reference: the productions both of the Continental and of the insular Colonies in America, can no longer be re exported as  
						heretofore to any part of Asia or Africa, or even of America; and consequently can no longer enter into the trades carried on, from the United States, to the Asiatic or African shores of the Mediterranean; nor to any of the places beyond the Cape of Good Hope offering a  
						market for them; nor finally to any other enemy or neutral Colonies in this quarter, to which in reason, as well as according to practice, they ought to be as re exportable, as to the Countries in Europe to which such Colonies belong.  
					In like manner the importations from beyond the Cape of Good Hope, more especially the cotton fabrics of China and India, can no longer be sent, as heretofore, to the West Indies, or the Spanish Main, where they not only now yield a great profit to our  
						merchants, but being mixed in cargoes with the produce of this Country, facilitate and encourage the trade in the latter. Besides the effect of the Article in abridging so materially our valuable commerce, the distinction which it introduces between the manufactures of Europe  
						and those of China, and India, is charged with evils of another sort. In many cases, it might not be easy to pronounce on the real origin of the articles. It is not improbable, that supposititious attempts also might be occasionally made, by the least scrupulous traders. With  
						such pretexts as these, arguing from the abuse made of less plausible ones, the interruptions and vexations of our trade, by the greedy cruizers which swarm on the ocean, could not fail to be augmented in a degree, not a little enforcing the objection to the article in its  
						present form.  
					As the prohibitory principle of Great Britain does not extend to the case of a Colonial Trade usually open, and no judicial decision has professedly applied the principle to such a trade; it is a reasonable inference, that the Article will not be so  
						construed as to interfere with the trade of that description, between enemy Colonies beyond the Cape of Good Hope, and other Countries and ports in that quarter. But, on the other hand, it may not be amiss to guard against a construction of the article that would abolish the  
						rule observed in the prize Courts of Great Britain; which, in the case of the Eastern Colonies, presumes that these ports were always open, and thereby throws on the captors, instead of the claimants, the  
						disadvantage of proving the fact in question.  
					It is observable that the duration of this article is limited to the period of the present hostilities, whilst the others are to be in force for ten years; so that if there should be a peace and a renewal of the war, as is very possible, within the latter  
						period, the onerous parts of the bargain would survive a part, in consideration of which, they were assumed. Justice and reciprocity evidently require that the more important articles of the Treaty should be regarded as conditions of each other, and therefore that they should  
						be co-durable. In this point of view, you will bring the subject under reconsideration; and without making this particular amendment an ultimatum, press it with all the force which it merits. This amendment ought to be the less resisted on the British side, as it would still  
						leave to that side, an advantage resulting from the nature of the two great objects to be attained by the United States, namely, the immunity of our crews, and of our neutral commerce; which are connected with a state of war only; whereas the stipulations, valued by Great  
						Britain, will operate constantly throughout the period of the Treaty, as well in a state of peace, as in a state of war.  
					Whatever term may finally be settled for the continuance of this regulation, it will be proper to retain the clause which saves the right involved in the article, from any constructive abandonment or abridgment. Even the temporary modification of the right,  
						as it will stand without the inadmissible restrictions now in the article, is considered as an important sacrifice on the part of the United States, to their desire of friendly adjustment with Great Britain. To an admission of the article with those restrictions, the  
						President prefers the footing promised to the Colonial trade, by the deference of Great Britain for the maritime powers, and by an unfettered right of the United States to adapt their regulations to the course which her policy may take.  
					That the operation of the article, in its present form, might be more fully understood, it was thought proper to avail the public of the ideas of a citizen of great intelligence and experience with respect to our commerce. His remarks, contained in a paper  
						herewith inclosed, afford a valuable elucidation of the subject. They will suggest, at the same time, some explanatory precautions worthy of attention; particularly in the case of articles, which paying no duty on importation into the United States, do not fall under the  
						regulation of drawbacks; and in the case of securing by bond, instead of actually paying, the duties allowed to be drawn back. It appears by the observations in your letter of Jany 3 that the bond was understood, as it surely ought to be, equivalent to actual payment. But  
						this is a point so material, that it cannot be too explicitly guarded against the misinterpretation of interested cruizers, and the ignorance or perverseness of inferior Courts.  
					3 The necessity of the change required in the 3d. article, in order to secure an indirect, as well as a direct trade, to the British East Indies, will be fully explained by the observations which have been obtained from several of our best informed Citizens  
						on that subject, and which are herewith inclosed.  
					As this latitude of intercourse was stipulated by the 13th. art of the Treaty of 1794, as judicially expounded by British Superior Courts; as it was enjoyed by the United States prior to that epoch, and has been always enjoyed, both before and since, by  
						other friendly nations; and as there is reason to believe that the British Government has been at all times ready, since the article expired, to renew it in its original form; it may justly be expected that the inserted innovation will not be insisted on. Should the  
						expectation fail, the course preferred is to drop the article altogether, leaving the trade on the general footing of the most favored nation, or even trusting to the interest of Great Britain for such regulations as may correspond with that of the United States.  
					Should the negotiation take up the East India article of the Treaty of 1794, you will find several amendments suggested in the extracts above referred to; some of which may be attempted with the greater chance of success, as they are harmless, if not  
						favorable, to the British system. To these suggestions may be added, a privilege to American vessels, of touching at the Cape of Good Hope. The objection to such a stipulation, under the present defeasable title of Great Britain to the Cape, may be obviated  
						by a descriptive provision, not necessarily applicable to it, in the event of its restoration by a Treaty of peace; but embracing it, in case the British title should be established by that event: It may be agreed &quot;that vessels of United States may touch for refreshment at  
						all the ports and places in the possession of Great Britain on or in the African or Assiatic Seas.&quot;  
					4th. Without a provision, or a reservation as to the claims of indemnity, an abandonment of them may be inferred from a Treaty as being a final settlement of existing controversies. It cannot be presumed that a precaution against such an inference, in any  
						mode that may be most effectual, can be opposed or complained of. On the contrary, it excites just surprize that so much resistance should be made to indemnifications supported by the clearest rules of right, and by a precedent in a former Treaty between the two Countries,  
						from which so many other articles have been copied. The only colorable plea for refusing the desired provision, flows from a presumption not only that the British Courts are disposed, but that they are competent, to the purpose of complete redress. Not to repeat observations  
						heretofore made on this subject, an unanswerable one is suggested by the clause in the  article of the Treaty annulling the principle or rather the pretence, that vessels without contraband of war on board, returning from a port to which  
						they had carried articles of that sort, were subject to capture and condemnation. Previous even to this recognition, it had been settled as the law of Nations by the British High Court of Admiralty, that vessels so circumstanced, were exempt from interruption. Yet a British  
						order of August  1803 expressly declares them to be lawful prize; and it is well known that a number of American vessels have been seized and condemned under that order. Here then is a class of wrongs, undeniably entitled to redress, and  
						which neither can nor ever could possibly be redressed, in the ordinary course of justice; it being an avowed rule with the prize Courts to follow such orders of the Government, as either expounding or superseding the law of nations. Even cases not finally decided, would  
						probably be considered as falling under the rule existing at the time of the capture, and consequently be added to this catalogue of acknowledged, but unredressed injuries.  
					5--Articles 18 &amp; 19  
					An effect of these articles is to secure to British Cruizers and their prizes, a treatment in American ports more favorable, than will be permitted to those of an enemy; with a saving of contrary stipulations already made, and a prohibition of any such in  
						future. As none of our Treaties with the belligerent nations, (France excepted) stipulate to the cruizers an equality in this respect, and as there are parties to the War with whom we have no treaties, it follows that a discrimination is made in the midst of war between the  
						belligerent nations, which it will not be in the power of the United States to redress.  
					Weighty considerations would dissuade from such a deviation from a strict equality towards belligerent nations, if stipulated at a time least liable to objection. But it would be impossible to justify a stipulation in the midst of war, substituting, for an  
						existing equality, an advantage to one of the belligerent parties over its adversaries; and that too, without any compensation to the neutral, shielding its motive from the appearance of mere partiality. Hitherto the U States have avoided as much as possible such  
						embarrassments; and with this view have gratuitously extended to all belligerents the privileges stipulated to any of them. Great Britain has had the benefit of this scrupulous policy. She can therefore, with the less reason, expect it to be relinquished for her benefit.  
					The last paragraph of the l9th. art establishes a just principle as to the responsibility of a neutral nation whose territory has been violated by captures within its limits; but by extending the principle to the two Miles added to our jurisdiction by the  
						12th. art, qualified as that addition is, it is made peculiarly important, that an amendment should take place.  
					Passing by the failure of a reciprocity, either in the terms or the probable operation of the responsibility, the United States seem to be bound to claim from the enemies of Great Britain, redress for a hostile act, which such enemies may not have renounced  
						their right to commit within the given space; making thus the United States liable to the one party, without a correspondent liability to them in the other party; and at the same time entitling Great Britain to redress, for acts committed by her enemies, which she has  
						reserved to herself, a right to commit against them.  
					Should all the other belligerent nations, contrary to probability, concur in the addition of two miles to our jurisdiction, this construction would still be applicable to their armed ships; those unarmed alone being within the additional immunity against  
						British Cruizers; and the Armed, as well as the unarmed ships of Great Britain, being expressly within the additional responsibility of the United States.  
					6 No Treaty can be sanctioned by the United States, under the alternative presented by the declaratory note on the subject of the French decree of Novr. 21. It is hoped that the occasion which produced it, will have vanished, and that it will not be renewed  
						in connection with a future signature on the part of Great Britain. The utmost allowable in such a case by a due respect to the United States would be a candid declaration that, in signing or ratifying the Treaty, it was understood on the part of Great Britain, that nothing  
						therein contained would be a bar to any measures, which, if no such Treaty existed, would be lawful as a retaliation against the measures of an enemy. And with such a declaration, it would be proper, on the part of the United States, to combine an equivalent protest against  
						its being understood, that either the Treaty or the British declaration would derogate from any rights or immunities, against the effect of such retaliating measures, which would lawfully appertain to them, as a neutral nation, in case no such Treaty or declaration  
						existed.  
					Having given this view of the alterations which are to be held essential, I proceed to notice such others as, tho’ not included in the ultimatum, are to be regarded as more or less deserving your best exertions. This will be most conveniently done by a  
						review of the several articles in their numerical order.  
					The 2d. 4th. &amp; 5th. all relate to the trade and navigation between the two Countries. The two first, make no change in the stipulations of the Treaty of 1794. The last has changed, and much for the better, the provisions of that Treaty, on the subject  
						of tonnage and navigation.  
					Two important questions however, enter into an estimate of these articles.  
					The first is whether they are to be understood as a bar to any regulations, such as navigation Acts, which would merely establish a reciprocity with British regulations. From the construction which seems to have been always put on the same stipulations in  
						the Treaty of 1794, it is concluded that no such bar would be created, and consequently that the articles are in that respect unexceptionable. It may be well, nevertheless, to ascertain that the subject is viewed in this light, by the British Government.  
					The second question is, whether the parties be, or be not, mutually restrained from laying duties, as well as prohibitions, unfavorably discriminating between Articles exported to them, and  
						like articles exported, to other nations.  
					According to the construction put by the United States on the same clauses in the Treaty of 1794, the mutual restraint was applicable to discriminations of both kinds. The British discriminating duties on exports, introduced under the name of Convoy duties  
						and since continued and augmented under other names, were accordingly combated, during the existence of the treaty, as infractions of its text. The British Government, however, never yielded to our construction either in discussion or in practice. And it appears from what  
						passed in your negotiations on this subject, that the construction which is to prevail, admits discriminating duties on exports.  
					In this point of view, the stipulation merits very serious attention. It cannot be regarded as either reciprocal or fair in principle, or, as just and friendly in practice.  
					In the case of prohibitions where both governments are on an equal footing, because it is understood that both have the authority to impose them, neither is left at liberty to exercise the authority.  
					In the case of duties, where the British Government possesses the authority to impose them, but where it is well known that the authority is withheld from the Government of the United States, by the Constitution, the articles are silent; and of course, the  
						British Government is left free to impose discriminating duties on their exports, whilst no such duties can be imposed by that of the United States. How will it be in practice? Stating the exports from Great Britain to the United States at 6 Millions sterling only, the  
						present duty of 4 PCent levies a tax on the United States amounting to 240 thousand pounds or one million Sixty five thousand Six hundred dollars, and there is nothing, whilst the war in Europe checks competition there, and whilst obvious causes must for a long time enfeeble  
						it here, that can secure us against further augmentations of the tribute.  
					Even under a regulation placing the United States on the footing of the most favored nation, it appears that the British Government would draw into its Treasury from our consumption 3/ 8 of the revenue now levied by her on the United States. Such a footing  
						however, would be material, as giving the United States the benefit of the check accruing from the more manufacturing state of the European nations. But to be deprived of that check by the want of an Article, putting us on the footing of the nations most favored by Great  
						Britain, and at the same time deprived of our own checks, by clauses putting Great Britain on the Commercial footing of the nations most favored by the United States, would, in effect, confirm a foreign authority to tax the people of the United States, without the chance of  
						reciprocity or redress.  
					The British duty on exports to the United States has another effect, not entirely to be disregarded. It proportionally augments the price of British manufactures, re- exported from the United States to other markets, and so far promotes a direct supply from  
						Great Britain, by her merchants and ships. Should this not be the effect of her regulations as now framed, there is nothing that would forbid a change of them having that for its object.  
					On these considerations it is enjoined upon you by the President to press in the strongest terms, such an explanation or amendment of this part of the Treaty, as will, if possible restrain Great Britain altogether from taxing exports to the United States,  
						or at least place them on the footing of the most favored nation; or if neither be attainable, such a change in the instrument in other respects, as will reserve to the United States the right to discriminate between Great Britain and other Nations, in their prohibition of exports, the only discrimination in the case of exports, permitted by the Constitution. The unwillingness of the President to risk an entire failure of the projected accommodation with Great Britain, restrains him from making an  
						amendment of this part of the Treaty, a sine qua non; but he considers it so reasonable, and so much called for by the  opinions and feelings  of this Country, that he is equally anxious and confident  
						with respect to a compliance on the part of the British Government.  
					Art: 6  
					This article as taking the case of the West India trade out of any general stipulation of privileges granted to other nations, may prove convenient, by disincumbering measures which may be taken against the British monopoly, from questions of which that  
						stipulation might otherwise be susceptible.  
					Art: 7 tho’ to remain if desired, would be more reasonable without the last paragraph, or with a right only to except ports and periods, at which the trade of the other party may not be permitted.  
					Art 8  
					This art: is framed with more accuracy than the l7th. on the same subject in the Treaty of 1794, and is improved by the additional paragraph at the close of it. But as such general stipulations have not been found of much avail in practice, and as it  
						continues to be the wish of the President to avoid, especially at the present juncture, unnecessary confirmations of the principle that a neutral flag does not protect enemy’s property; an omission of the article is much preferred, unless it be so varied as to be free from  
						this objection. This may easily be done, by substituting a general stipulation, &quot;that in all cases where vessels shall be captured or detained for any lawful cause, they shall be brought to the nearest or most convenient port; and such part only of the articles on board as  
						are confiscable by the law of nations, shall be made prize, and the vessel, unless by law subject also to condemnation, shall be at liberty to proceed &amp;c&quot;  
					There ought to be the less hesitation on the British side in making this change, as the article in its present form, departs from that of 1794; and there is the more reason on our side for requiring the change, as the addition of &quot;for other lawful cause&quot; after specifying the two cases of enemy’s property and contraband of war, is probably valued by Great Britain as supporting her doctrine, and impairing ours, with respect to Colonial trade. The only case other than those  
						specified, to which the right of capture is applicable, is that of blockades, which might have been as easily specified as provided for by such a residuary phraze; and the pretext for appropriating this phraze to the case of the Colonial trade, would be strengthened by the  
						specific provision, in a subsequent article, for the case of blockades.  
					It cannot be alleged that the specification of the two cases of enemy’s property, and contraband of war, is necessary to prevent uncertainty and controversy; the United States having sufficiently manifested their acquiescence in these causes of capture. If  
						there be a source of uncertainty and controversy, it is in the expressions &quot;other lawful cause,&quot; and &quot;otherwise confiscable&quot;; and this source could not be increased by the change here proposed.  
					Art 9.  
					This art: is an improvement of that on the same subject in the Treaty of 1794, inasmuch as it excepts from the list of contraband, tar and pitch, when not bound to a port of naval equipment, and when so bound, substitutes preemption for forfeiture. It has  
						an advantage also in the clause, renouncing the principle of the British order of Augt. 1803 against vessels returning from places, to which they had carried contraband of War.  
					On the other hand, it would not have been unreasonable to expect that the British Government would, in a Treaty with the United States, have insisted on no stipulation less favorable, than her stipulation on the same subject, with Russia; especially as the  
						naval stores exported from the United States, are equally the growth and produce of the Country.  
					Consistency again, as well as reason, evidently required, that the exception in favor of tar and pitch should have been extended to every species of naval stores, equally applicable to other uses than those of War, and destined to places, other than those  
						of naval equipment.  
					Lastly, it is observable, that even turpentine and rosin are not included with Tar and pitch, in the favorable exception; tho’ of a character so kindred as to leave no pretext for the distinction.  
					Neither has the British Government the slightest ground for regarding as a concession, the stipulated immunity of a vessel, which, on her outward voyage, had carried contraband to a hostile port. The principle asserted by her order on that subject, is an  
						innovation against the clearest right of neutrals as recognized and enforced even by British Courts. The very language of the article implies that there is no pretence for the innovation.  
					These considerations urge a remodification of the article, and they are strengthened by the great dislike of the President to formal recognitions, at this particular moment, of principles combated by some, and unfavorable to all neutral nations. So  
						ineligible indeed, in his view, is any step tending in the least to retard the progress of those principles, that naval stores are to be left on a stipulated list of contraband, in the event only, of an inflexible refusal of the British Government to omit them; nor are they  
						to be retained in any event, without an addition or explanation that will except turpentine and Rosin, as well as tar and pitch, there being no plausible motive for the distinction; and the quantity and value of the two former exported from the United States, being found, on  
						inquiry, to make them of equal importance with the two latter. It can scarcely be supposed that the British Government will insist on this unwarrantable distinction. It is not indeed improbable, that it has been a mere inadvertence. Such an inference is favored by the  
						circumstance of your speaking, in your comment on this article, of Tar and Turpentine, as being the two exceptions. Whatever the true state of the case may be, it is thought better to omit a list of contraband altogether, than not to include in  
						the exception from it Turpentine and Rosin, as well as tar and pitch.  
					Art. 10  
					The abuse of blockades has been so extravagant and has produced so much vexation and injury to the fair commerce of the United States, that, as on one hand it is of great importance to find a remedy; so, on the other, it is the more necessary, that the  
						remedy should be such as not itself to admit of abuse. The considerations which reconciled you to the tenor of the article, as at least a constructive approach to a solid provision for the case, are allowed the weight which they justly merit; whilst the course which your  
						discussions took, are a proof of the exertions which were used to give the article a more satisfactory form.  
					The failure however of the British Commissioners to substantiate a favorable construction of the Article, by a proper explanatory letter addressed to you; with their reasons for refusing to insert in the Treaty, a definition of blockade, justify  
						apprehensions that the vague terms, which alone were permitted to compose the article, would be more likely to be turned against our object, by Courts and Cruizers, and perhaps by a less liberal Cabinet, than to receive, in practice, the more favorable construction which  
						candor anticipated.  
					The British doctrine of blockades, exemplified by practice, is different from that of all other nations, as well as from the reason and nature of that operation of war. The mode of notifying a blockade by proclamations and diplomatic communications, of what  
						too is to be done, rather than of what, in fact, had been done, is more particularly the evil which is to be corrected. Against these nominal blockades, the article does not sufficiently close the door. The preamble itself which refers to distance of situation, as a frequent cause of not knowing that a blockade exists, though, in one view giving the United States, the advantage of a favorable presumption, in another view carries an admission unfavorable to our principle, which rests not on the distance of  
						situation, but on the nature of the case; and which consequently rejects, in all cases, the legal sufficiency of notifications in the British mode. The preamble is liable to the remark also, that it separates our cause from the common one of  
						neutral nations in a less distant situation, and that the principle of it may even be pleaded against us in the case of blockades in the West Indies. These considerations would have been outweighed by the advantage of establishing a satisfactory rule on this subject, in favor  
						of our trade; but without such a provision in the Article, it is thought less advisable to retain it, than to trust to the law of blockades as laid down by all writers of authority; as supported by all treaties which define it, and more especially, as recognized and  
						communicated to the United States by the British Government, thro’ its Minister here in -- last; not to mention the influence which the course of events, and the sentiments of the Maritime nations in friendship with Great Britain, may have in producing a reform on this  
						subject.  
					The last paragraph, tho’ subjecting persons in civil as well as Military service of an enemy, to capture in our vessels, may prove a valuable safeguard to ordinary passengers and mariners against the wrongs which they now frequently experience, and which  
						affect the vessel as well as themselves.  
					Art 12  
					It is much regretted that a provision could not be obtained against the practice of British Cruizers, in hovering, and taking stations, for the purpose of surprizing the trade going in and out of our harbours; a practice which the British Government felt to  
						be so injurious to the dignity and rights of that nation, at periods when it was neutral. An addition of two miles nevertheless to our maritime jurisdiction, so far as to protect neutral and other unarmed vessels, notwithstanding its want of any thing like a due reciprocity,  
						is not without its value. This value will, at the same time, be very materially impaired, if the stipulation cannot be liberated from the clause requiring the consent of the other belligerent nations, as necessary to exempt their vessels from search and seizure. None of the  
						other belligerent nations have, in fact, unarmed vessels engaged in our trade, nor are they likely to have any during the war; and these alone could derive advantage from their consent, their armed vessels being expressly excepted. There can be no motive with them, therefore,  
						to agree to the regulation. They would rather be tempted to embarrass it, with a view to continue as much as possible, vexations which lessen the mutual good will of the parties. And as by their not agreeing to the regulation, the right is reserved to British Cruizers to  
						examine all vessels for the purpose of ascertaining whether they may not belong to a belligerent, the disturbance of our trade may be little diminished within the additional two miles. Besides the mere interruption of a search concerning the vessel, it is hardly to expected  
						from the general spirit of Cruizers, that the search will not be extended to the cargo; and if the latter should be thus, or otherwise, found or suspected to be of a confiscable sort, that the temptation to capture would be resisted; the less so perhaps, as the increased  
						distance from the shore, and the increased difficulty of proof, would favor the chance of condemnation, or at least countenance Courts in their propensity to refuse damages and costs to the claimants.  
					To secure the advantage promised by this article, the right of search ought to be suppressed altogether, the additional space enjoying in this respect the same immunity as is allowed to the marine league. To this object the President wishes your endeavours  
						to be directed.  
					I reserve for the 19th. article another view of the subject which will claim your attention.  
					Art 13  
					The general provision here copied from the Treaty of 1794, tho’ not hitherto found of much effect, in controuling the licenciousness of Cruizers, and very different from the special rules in favor of neutrals contained in most treaties which touch the  
						subject of search, enters very properly into a comprehensive arrangement between two friendly nations. The introductory sentence alone, which consists of new matter, invites particular notice. The expressions &quot;as the course of the war may  
						possibly permit&quot; and &quot;observing as much as possible the acknowledged principles and rules of the law of nations&quot;, however favorably intended by the British negotiators, will not improbably be construed into a relaxation of the neutral right in  
						favor of belligerent pleas drawn from circumstances of which belligerent Agents will be the Judges. The expressions may easily be so varied as to refer simply to the law of nations for the rule, and to the friendship of the parties, for the spirit, according to which the  
						search is to be conducted. If such an amendment should be deliberately rejected by the British Government, it will be a proof of lurking danger, that will recommend an Omission of what relates to the subject of search, in preference to retaining it.  
					Arts. 14. 15. &amp; 16 call for no particular observation.  
					Art: 17  
					So much of this article as relates to the admission of ships of War, would be advantageously exchanged for a general stipulation, allowing on this subject the privilege granted to the most favored nation. It would then be in the power of the United States,  
						to limit the number admissible at one time; whereas such an indefinite admission of British ships imposes on our neutrality, a like indulgence to the fleets of other nations. Such an alteration of the article is the more reasonable and important, as there will be little  
						reciprocity in its character; the United States having but few ships; and the inconveniences from British ships in our ports, being much greater than those from our ships in British ports.  
					The engagement to treat officers of the navy with respect, is not only too indefinite to be enforced by penal regulations, but implies a reproachful defect of hospitality and civility. In this light it was viewed during the discussion of the Treaty of 1794.  
						The clause probably grew then out of recent complaints well or ill founded, of disrespectful conduct on some occasion, towards British officers. If latter occurrences were to be consulted, it would be a more apt provision now, to stipulate for the punishment of venal  
						Commanders making insulting and ungrateful returns for the kindness and respect shewn them in our ports and towns. The President makes almost a point of excluding this part of the article.  
					Art: 20  
					Considering the great number of British Merchants residing in the United States, with the great means of influence possessed by them, and the very few American merchants who reside in Great Britain, the inconvenience which may be incident to such a  
						protracted right to remain, during a state of war, is evidently much greater on our side than on the other. In this view the stipulation is very unequal. The liberal spirit of it is, at the same time, highly commendable. It were only to be wished that the readiness on one  
						side to make sacrifices of this sort, to a spirit which ought to pervade every part of a Treaty between the parties, had been less met by an apparent disposition on the other side, rather to extort from, than to emulate it.  
					Art 21 Tho’ not agreeable, not to be an insuperable obstacle.  
					Art 22 is altogether proper.  
					Art 23  
					This article, granting the privileges of the most favored nation, seems to require explanation, if not attention. The terms &quot;shall continue to be on the footing of the most favored nation&quot;, implies that the parties are now on  
						that footing. To look no further, the discrimination between exports from Great Britain to Europe and to the United States, is a proof that the fact is otherwise.  
					But may not the expression be construed into a barrier against laws on the part of the United States, establishing a reciprocity with the British navigation act and West India regulations. It might be impolitic to extend such laws to all other nations, as  
						it would be unjust to extend them to such as had not adopted the restrictive system of Great Britain: And yet a discrimination might be arraigned as not continuing Great Britain on the same footing with other nations.  
					The object of this article, so far as it is a legitimate one, would be sufficiently provided for by a mutual stipulation of the privileges in trade and navigation enjoyed by the most favored nation; and such stipulations, moreover, ought in justice to  
						import or imply that, where privileges are granted to a third nation, in consideration of privileges received, the privileges cannot be claimed under the stipulation, without a return of the same or of equivalent privileges. The condition is certainly not without difficulties  
						in the execution; but it avoids a greater evil. Should Spain or France open her Colonies to our ships and productions, on our granting certain privileges to her trade, these could not be claimed or expected by the most friendly nation who would not pay the price of them.  
					Arts. 24 &amp; 25 are entirely proper.  
					Art: 26.  
					It is particularly desirable that the duration of the Treaty should be abridged, to the term limited in the instructions of the 5th. day of Jany. 1804.  
					Having taken this view of the subject, with reference to a formal treaty under new modifications, it is necessary to recollect that you were authorized by my letter of Feby 3d. to enter into informal arrangements, and that before the receipt of my letter of  
						March 18, a plan of that sort may have been definitively settled. In such a state of things, it is impossible to do better than to leave your own judgments, aided by a knowledge of circumstances unknown here, and by the sentiments of the President now communicated, to decide  
						how far it may be eligible, or otherwise, to attempt to supersede that informal arrangement, by opening the negotiation herein contemplated.  
					Should, on another hand, the negotiation be found in the state authorized by my letter of March 18, that is to say, matured provisionally only, and consequently leaving the door open for the experiment now provided for, it must equally remain with your own  
						judgments, guided by a comparison of the terms of the provisional arrangement, with the present instructions, to decide how far it may be best to close the former, or to pursue the object of the latter; or to pursue the object of the latter, with a view, in case of failure,  
						to return to and close the former.  
					Whatever may be the course recommended by the actual state of things, you will feel the propriety of smoothing the way for it, by the explanations which will best satisfy the British Government, that the several steps taken on the part of the United States,  
						have proceeded from their solicitude to find some ground on which the difficulties and differences existing between the two Countries, might be amicably and permanently terminated. You will be equally aware of the importance of transmitting hither as early and as  
						circumstantial information of your proceedings and prospects, as opportunities will permit; and will particularly keep in mind the earnest desire of the President to possess, in due time, every material preparatory to the communications relating to our affairs with Great  
						Britain, which will be so anxiously expected on the meeting of Congress the first Monday in December.

 is not the party, which has the least interest in taking counsel from them.  
					Such are the instructions and explanations under which the task is consigned to you, of renewing the discussions with the British government. The President is well assured that it will be executed with all the advantage which talents and patriotism can  
						contribute; and he is unwilling to believe that that government will finally prefer to the reasonable terms proposed, the serious state of things which will be left, by a miscarriage of this ulterior appeal to the motives which ought to govern a just and friendly nation. As  
						it is possible, however, that this favorable calculation may not be verified, and it will necessarily remain to be decided whether such a state of things can be obviated by any additional proposition not beyond the justifiable limits of concession, the President has taken the  
						case into his serious deliberation; and has concluded to authorize you, in the event of a rejection of every arrangement already authorized, but in that event only, to admit an article to the following effect:  
					&quot;It is agreed that after the term of  months computed from the exchange of ratifications, and during a war in which either of the parties may be engaged, neither of them will permit any seaman not being its own citizen  
						or subject, and being a citizen or subject of the other party, who shall not have been for two years at least prior to that date, constantly and voluntarily in the service or within the jurisdiction of the U. States, to enter or be employed on board any of its vessels  
						navigating the high seas: and proper regulations enforced by adequate penalties shall be mutually established, for distinguishing the seamen of the parties respectively, and for giving full effect to this stipulation.&quot;  
					You will observe that the proposition is so framed as not to comprehend among British seamen, those who have been made citizens of the U. States; and who must necessarily be so regarded within their jurisdiction and under their flag. This modification of  
						the article cannot produce any real objection on the part of G. Britain, 1. because the legal pre-requisites to naturalization in the U. States imply what is sufficiently known, that the number of seamen actually naturalized or likely to be so, is too small to claim attention  
						in any arrangement on this subject. 2. because the right of British subjects to naturalize themselves in a foreign trade and navigation, as laid down by the judicial authority of G. Britain, ought to restrain its government from making a difficulty on this point. (See Dunford  
						and Easts--Wilson vs. Marriatt--and the same case in Bosanquet and Puller’s Reports.)

		If an attempt should be made to bind the U. States to deliver up the seamen to G. Britain, instead of excluding them merely from their own service, you are to say at once, that it would be inconsistent with our principles, and cannot be acceded to.  
					It will occur to you that the period of two years has been chosen in allusion to the period established by G. Britain, as sufficiently incorporating alien with British seamen. Her own example at least must have weight with her; and the implied appeal to it,  
						may be of use in shielding the measure against public prejudices to which the government may not wish to expose itself.  
					If the British government be not predetermined against a friendly adjustment, it is confidently presumed that the concession proposed will not only overcome all obstacles to your success on the essential points, but may be turned to account in promoting the  
						amendment of the other articles.  
					Should the concession, however, contrary to all expectation, not succeed, even as to the essential objects, the course prescribed by prudence will be, to signify your purpose of transmitting the result to your government; avoiding carefully any language or  
						appearance of hostile anticipations; and receiving &amp; transmitting at the same time, any overtures which may be made on the other side, with a view to bring about accomodation. As long as negociation can be honorably protracted, it is a resource to be preferred, under  
						existing Circumstances, to the peremptory alternative of improper concessions, or inevitable collisions.  
					The last suggestion I have to make to you is that in case of great difficulties in re-adjusting the multiplied provisions, embraced by the treaty of December, particularly those relating to commerce, it may be adviseable to simplify the transaction, by  
						confining it to the few essential objects; or by not adding more than a few others of least difficulty and most importance. A general article may be sufficient for the rest, giving reciprocally, in regard to trade and navigation, armed ships and prizes, the priviledges of the  
						most favored nation; and leaving for more leisurely and detailed provision, whatever further may conduce to the mutual interests, and correspond with the friendly disposition of the parties. A general stipulation of this sort applied to the subject of Commerce, would have the  
						advantage to the U. States of abolishing and preventing British discriminations on exports, and to G. Britain the like advantage with respect to American discriminations on imports.

•epartmrnt of state,  
May 20, 1S07-.  
gevtt.kmeh,  
My letter of March 18, acknowled­  
ged the receipt of yoar dispatches, and of  
the treaty signed on the 3lst December, of  
which Mr. Purviancc was the bearer, and  
signified that the sentiments end views of  
tiie president, formed 0:1 the actual posture  
of our aff.drs with Great Britain, would,  
without any useless delav, be communica­  
ted. 1 he subject is accordingly resumed  
in this dispatch, with which Mr. Purviancc  
will be charged. To render his passage  
the more sure and convenient, he rakes it  
in the sloop of war Wasp, which will con­  
vey him to a British port, on her way to the  
Mediterranean. She will touch also at a  
| French port, probably FOricnt, with dis­  
patches for General Armstrong and Mr.  
j Bowdoin, and will afford a good opportuni­  
ty tor any communications you may have  
occasion to make to those gentlemen.  
1 lie president has seen in vour exertions  
to accomplish the great objects of your in­  
structions, ample proofs of that zeal and  
[patriotism in which lie confided : and feels  
deep regret that your success lias not cor­  
responded with the reason ableness of your  
propositions, and the ability with v/hicli  
they were supported. He laments more  
especially that the British government has  
not yielded to the just and cogent conside  
rations which forbid the practice ofitscrui­  
zers in Visiting and impressing the crews  
o. our vessels, covered bv an independent  
fl ig. and guarded by the&#x27;laws of the high  
sons, which ought to lie sacred with all na­  
tions.  
The president continues to regard this  
subject in the light in which it lias been  
pressed on the justice and friendship of G  
Britain. He cannot reconcile it with his du­  
v to our sea-faring citizens, or with the  
sensibility or sovereignty of the nation, to  
recogn ze even constructively, a principle  
rnat would expos? on the lii 1*^11 seas, their j  
liberty, their lives, every thing, in a word, |  
iiat is dearest to the human heart, to the  
C Lnr:cio:iK np inf ... ■  
  
nay be pronounced against their allegiance,  
iy officers of a foreign government, whom  
neither t te law of nations, nor even the  
iyrs of -hat government, will allow to de­  
cide on the ownership or oharnettr of the  
* mutest article of property found in a like  
si uation.  
It has a great and necessary weight also  
with the president, that the views of con_  
ess, as manifested during the session  
vaich passed the non-importatio t act, as  
veil as the primary rank held by the object  
I securing Amarican crews against f&#x27;ri­  
is!i impressment, ntnong the objects which  
•uggested the solemnity of an extraordinary  
u&#x27;.ssion, are opposed to any conventional  
arrangement, which, without effectually  
irovidlng for that object, Would disarm the  
’J. S. of the means deemed most eligible as  
an eventual remedy.  
K is considered, moreover, by the presi­  
dent, the more reasonable, that the neces­  
sary concession in this case should be made  
by Great Britain, rather than by the U. S  
on the double consideration, first, that a  
concession on our part, would violate both  
* moral and political duty of the govern­  
ment. to our citizens, which wnuld ’not be  
the case on the other side ; secondly, that  
&#x27;*■ ^rPJf.er. number of American citizens,  
British subjects arc, in fact, imprest­  
“*&#x27;.*d from our vesseis ; and that, conscquent­  
y, more of wrong is done to the U. States,  
h in of right to Great Britain ; taking even  
uer own claim for the legal criterion.  
On these grounds, the president is con­  
^tt-lined to decline any arrangement, for  
nal or informal, which does not comprise  
i pro\ ision against impressments from A­  
inericr.n vessels on the high seas, and which  
would, notwithstanding, be a liar to legisla­  
tive measures, such as congress have tho’t  
or may think proper to adopt, for control­  
  
urn species oi arrgresstsn.  
Persevering at the same lime in his ear­  
nest desire to establish the harmory of the  
two nations on a proper foundation, and cal­  
culating on the motives which must he e­  
Tually felt by Great Britain to secure that  
important object, it is Ins intention that your  
efforts shoulu be renewed, with a view to  
such alterations of the instrument signed on  
the 31st December, as may render it ac­  
ceptable to the U S.  
That you may the more fully understand  
his impressions and purposes, I will explain  
the alterations which arc to he regarded as  
essential j and proceed then to such obser­  
vations on the several articles, as will shew  
the other alterations which ere to lie at­  
tempted, and ilie degree of importance res­  
pectively a&#x27;tnehed to them.  
1st. Withour a provision agiinsl impress­  
ments, substantially such as is contemplated  
in your original instructions, no treaty is to  
he concluded.  
2d The eleventh article on the subject of  
colonial trade, cannot lie admitted, unless  
freed from the conditions which restrict to  
the market of Europe, the re-exportation  
of colonial produce, and to European arti­  
cles, the supplies to the colonial market.  
3d. &#x27;Die change made by the third arti­  
cle in the provisions of the tre aty of I7y*,  
relative to the trade with the British pos­  
sessions in India, by limiting the privilege  
to a direct trade from the U. S as yell as  
to them, 19 deemed an insuperable objecti­  
on.  
4th. Either an express provision is to he  
insisted on, for indemnifying sufferers from  
wrongful captures, or at least a saving in  
some form or other, of their rights against  
any implied abandonment.  
5th. Articles 18 nnd 19 to he so altered  
ns to leave; the U. S. free, as a neutral na­  
  
tion, to I;cep and place other belligerent  
nations on an equality with Great Britain.  
6th. No such alternative as is presented  
by the declaratory note cn the subject of  
the French decree of Nov. 21st, 1306, will  
be admissible.  
I irst. The considerations which render  
a prevision on the subject of impressments  
indispensable, hare been already sufficient­  
ly explained.  
Second. The essential importance ofthe  
amendment required in the 11th article, re­  
sults from the extensive effect which the  
article, if unamended, would have on the  
| system of our commerce as hitherto carri­  
ed on, with the sanction or acquiescence of  
Great Britain herself.  
It was hoped that the British government,  
in regulating the subject of this article  
would at least have yielded to the example  
of its treaty with Russia. It could not have  
been supposed that a modification \vou;d be  
insisted on, which shuts to our neu nil com­  
merce important channels, left open by the  
adjudications of British courts, and particu­  
larly by the principle officially communion,  
fed by that government to this, through Mr  
king, in the year 1801.  
According to that principle and tlione ad  
judications, the indirect trade through our  
neutral ports was as free from enemy colo­  
nies, to every other part of the world as to  
Europe; and as free to such colonies, in the  
articles of all other countries, as in Euro­  
pean articles.  
According to the tenor of the article, and  
tli&quot; general prohibitory principle assumed  
by Great Britain, to which it has an im­  
plied reference, the productions both ofthe  
continental and ofthe insular eoloniesan A­  
merica, can no longer be re-exporud aa  
heretofore to any part of Asia or Africa,or  
even of America, and consequently can no  
longer enter into the trades carried on From  
the U. S. to the Asiatic or African shores  
ofthe Mediterranean, nor toanv of he pl.t,  
ces beyond the CapcofGoo«l Hope, offering  
a market for them ; n~r finally to any other  
enemy or neutral colonies in this qu rter,  
to which in reason, as well as according to!  
.U__i. . .. .  
  
. J nn I UlUDIt  
as to the countries in Europe to which such  
colonies belong.  
In like manner the impprtations from be­  
yond the Cape of Good Hope, more espe­  
cially the cotton fabrics of Ch.na and India,  
can no longer he sent as heretofore to the  
West Ind:e3, or the Spanish Main, where  
they not only new ytclda great profit to our  
merchants, but being mixed in c.arg&lt;&gt;es with  
tlir produce of this country, facilitate and  
encourage the trade in the latter. Besides  
the effect of the article in abridging so ma­  
terially our valuable commerce, the dis­  
tinction which it introduces between the  
manufactures of Europe, and those of Chi  
na and India, is chargeable with evils of a  
nother sor . In many cases it might nc.t be  
easy to pronounce on the real origin of the  
articles. It is not improbable that suppo­  
sitious attrmprs also, might be occasional..  
Iv made, by the least scrupulous traders.  
With such pretexts as these, arguing f.-om  
the abuse made of less plausible ones, the  
interruptions and vexations of our trade, by  
the greedy cruizers which swarm on the  
!ocean, could nor fail to be augmented in a  
degree, not a little enforcing the objection  
[to the article in its present form.  
As the prohibitory principle of G. Britain  
docs not extend to the case of a colonial  
trade usually open, and no judicial decisi­  
on has professedly applied »he principle to  
such a trade, it is a reasonable inference,  
that the article will not be so construed as  
to interfere with the trade of that deser p­  
tion, between enemy colonies beyond the  
Cape of Good Hope, and other countries and  
ports in that quarter But on the other  
hand, it may not lie amiss to guard against  
a construction of the article that would a­  
ooHsli the rule observed in the prize courts  
of Great Britain, which, in the case of the  
eastern colonies, presumes that these pons  
were always open, and thereby throws on  
the captors, instead of the claimants, the  
disadvantage of proving the fact in questi­  
on.  
  
It is observable, that the duration of this  
arricic is limited to the period of the pre­  
sent hostilities, whilst the others are to he  
n force for ten years ; so that if there should  
he a peace and a renewal of the war, as is  
very possible, within the latter period, the  
onerous parts of the bargain would survive  
a part, ill consideration of which, they were  
assumed. Justice and reciprocity evidently  
require that die more important articles of  
the treaty should he regarded ns conditions  
ofeach other, and therefore that they should  
he lo-durahle. In this point of view, you  
will bringthe subject under consideration ; 8c  
without making this particular amendment  
an ultimatum, press it with all the force  
which it merits. This amendment ought  
to be the less res&#x27;sted on the British side,  
as it would still leave to that side, an ad­  
vantage resulting from the nature of the  
two great objects to be attained by the U.  
States, namely, the immunity of our crews,  
and of our neutral commerce, which are  
connected with a state of war only ; where­  
as the stipulations valued by Great Britain,  
will operate constantly throughout the pe­  
riod of the tre «ty, as well in a state of peace,  
a&quot;, in a state of war.  
Whatever term may finally be settled for  
the continuance oi this regulation, it will be  
proper to retain the clause which saves the  
nglo involve* in the article from any con­  
st ruttive abandonment or abridgment. Keen  
the temporary modification of the right, ns  
it will s and without the inadmissible res  
trictions now in the article, is considered  
as an important sacrifice on the part of the  
u. S to their desire of friendly adjustment  
with G. Britain. To an admission of the  
article with those restrictions, the president  
  
L * ~ *s&#x27;*&#x27;*.S “ • I  
prefers the footing promised to the colonial  
trade, by the deference of Great Britain for  
the maritime powers, and bv nn unfettered  
right of the U. 3. to adapt their regulation*  
to the course which her policy r ay’ take.  
That the operation of the article in it*  
present form, might he more fully under*  
stood, it was thought proper to avail th*  
public of the ideas of a citizen of great in­  
telligence and experience with respect Id  
our commerce. His remarks, contained irt  
a paper herewith inclcscd, afford a valuable  
elucidation of the subject. They will sug­  
gest at the same time, some explanatoiy  
precautions Worthy of attention, particular­  
ly in the case of articles, which paying no  
duty on importation into the U. S do not fall  
under the regulation«■f drawbacks; and in  
the i%3 J of securing by bond, instead of  
actually paying, the duties allowed to be  
drawnbacti. It eppiMro by the obaevv.iti*  
ons in your letter of January 3d. that the  
bond was understood, as it surely uu ht to  
be, equivalent to actual pay mmt. But this  
:s a point so material, that it cannot lie -co  
explicitly guarded against tua mhintespre -  
tation o* interested cruircrs, and the igno­  
rance or perverseness of inierior courts.  
Third, The necessity of tnc ci.ange re­  
quired in tiie third article, in order to -e­  
ourc an indirect, as well as a direct trade  
o the British East Inti es, will be fuily  
explained by the observations which have  
oecn obtained from several of &lt; ur be .t in.  
for at id citizens, on that subject, and which  
are herewith inclosed.  
As this latitude of intercourse wa; stipu­  
lated by the »3th arhcle of the treatv of  
1794, as judicially expounded by British 5U­  
j peri or courts; as it was enjovi d by the V  
;States prior to that epoch, and has been  
j aiways enjoyed, both before and since, by  
o;her friendly nations; and as there is  
I reason to believe that the British govern­  
iineni has been at all times reitdv, since  
the article expired, to renew it in’its ori­  
ginal form, it msy justly be expected that  
tne inserted innovation will nut be insis ect  
on. Saould the expectation fu.l, the cours®  
preferred is to drop the article altogether  
  
V ■ * genera loctmg of  
the most favored nation, or even trontr  
to the interest of Gre.it Brita.n lor &amp;uC*  
rfguiatnms as may correspond with that of  
4 he U. S­  
Should the negociation take up the East  
India article of the treaty- of 17S i, you will  
find several amendments suggested in the  
extracts above referred to, some of which  
may be attempted with the gieater chance  
o. success, as they are harmless, if not fa­  
vorable to the British system. To these  
suggestions may be added, a privilege u&gt;  
American vessels of touching at the cure  
of Good Hope. Hie objection to suclf*  
stipulation, under the present defeasible ti­  
tle ol Great Britain to the cape, may be  
obviated by a descriptive provision, not ne­  
cessarily applicable to it, in the event of  
.ts restitution by a treaty&#x27; of peace but em­  
bracing it, in case the British title should  
be established by that event. It mav b&lt;-a.  
greed “that vessels of the U. S. may touch  
tor refreshment at all the ports and pla­  
ces in the possession of Great Britain on  
or in the African or Asiatic seas.”  
Fourth. Without a provision, or a reser­  
vation, as to the cl urns of indemnity, an  
abandonment of ihem may be inferred fiom  
a treaty, as being a final settlement of ex­  
iting controversies It cannot be presum­  
ed, that a precaution against such an infel  
rence, in any mode that may be most e If. c­  
tual, can be opposed or complained of: on  
the contrary, it excites juat surprise that  
so much resistance should be made to in­  
demnifications supported bv t- e clearest  
rules of right, and by a precedent in a for­  
mer treaty between trie two countries, from  
which so many othei at ti« K-s have been  
copied. The only colorable pica for refus­  
ing the dcsin d provision, flows from a pro­  
sumption, not only that the British courts  
are disposed, hut thai they are competent,  
to the purpose of complete redress. Not to  
repeat observations heretofore made on this  
subject, an unanswerable one is suggested  
bv the clause in the &#x27;*  
  
tide of the treaty, annulling the principle,  
or riu ;er the pretence, that vessels with­  
out contraband of war on board, reiumine  
from a port to which they have carried at­  
ticles ol that sort, were subject to capture  
and condemnation. Previous, even t &gt; this  
recognition, it had been settled as the &#x27;aw  
of nations, by the British high r ,art of  
admiralty, that vessels so circumstanced,  
were exempt from in ervuptinn. Yet t  
British order ot August, luo?, e&gt;;oie&lt;siy  
declares them to be lawful prize:.;’ RTul ,t  
is well known, that n number of American  
vessels nave been seized and condemned  
under that order. Here then is a cia-s of  
•vrongs, undeniably entitled to redress, and  
which neither can, nor ever could possibly  
be redressed, in the ordinary course ; it  
being an »vowed rule, with the prize courts,  
to follow such orders of the government as  
either expounding or superseding the law  
of nations. Even cases not finally decided,  
would probably be considered as falling un­  
der the rule existing at the time ot the  
enpture, and consequently be added to this  
catalogue of acknowledged, but umedrened  
injuries.  
Fifth. Articles 18 and 19. An efTocf of  
these articles is to secure to British c, uj„  
zers und their prizes a treatment n Ame­  
rican ports, more favorable than will i,e  
permitted to those of an enemy ; with z  
saving of r^n vary it pu» strops already  
made, and a proh bitiot* ot any such in ft*,  
ture As none of tur treaties with h»  
belligerent nations (France excepted) sti­  
pul a to to the.r cruizers an equality i u t)llt  
respect, nnd as there are parties to the  
war, with wb nn we have no trea.ies it  
follows that i discrimination is mao-j, j*

the midst of war, between the belligerent  
nations, which it will not be in the power  
of the U. S. to redress.  
Weighty considerations would dissuade  
from such a deviation from a strict equali­  
tv towards belligerent nations, if stipulated  
at a time least liable to objection, hut it  
would be impossible r«» justify a stipulation,  
in the midst of war, substituting for an ex­  
isting equality, an advantage to one of the  
belligerent part.es over i&#x27;s adversaries ;  
and that too, without any compensation to  
the neutral, shielding its motive from the  
appearance of mere partiality. Hitherto  
the U S. have avoided, as much as possi­  
ble, such embarrassments : ami with this  
view have gratuitously extended to all bel­  
ligerents tlie privileges stipulated to any  
of them. Great Britain has had the hem lit  
of this scrupulous policy. She can,there­  
fore, with the less reason, expect it to be  
re inquished for her benefit.  
*1 he lust paragraph of the 19ch article,  
establishes a just principle as to the res­  
ponsibility of a neutral nation, whose ter­  
ritory has been violated by captures with,  
in i&#x27;s limits ; but by extending the princi­  
ple to the two miies added to our jurisdic­  
tion by tho i2ih article, qualified us that  
addition is, it is made peculiarly important  
that an amendment should take place.  
Passing by the failure of a reciprocity,  
either in the leinm, or the probable ope­  
ration of the responsibility,; he U b. seem  
to be bound to claim from the enemies ol  
Great Britain, redress for a hostile act,  
winch enemies may not have renounced  
their right to commit within tiie given  
space ; malting thus the U. S. liable to the  
one party, w ithout a correspondent iinbilL  
«y to them i.i the &lt; iher party ; and at tiie  
same time entitling Great Britain to redress  
for acts committed by Uer enemies, which  
sue lias reserved to herself a right to com­  
mit ag-.inst them.  
Should all the other belligerent nations,  
contravy to probability, concur in the ad­  
dition of two miles to our jurisdiction, this  
construction would still be applicable to  
their armed ships, those unarmed alone  
being within the additional immunity  
against British cruizeis. and the ar.r.id. iss  
  
well as the unarmed ships of Great Britain,  
being expressly within the additional res­  
p •nsibiiitv of the U. S.  
SixiU No treaty can be sanctioned by  
the IJ. S. under tUe alternative presented  
by tne declaratory note on the subject of  
the French decree of Nov. 21 It is hoped  
tliat the occasion which produced it will  
hare vanished, and that it will not he re­  
newed in connection with a tuture signa­  
ture on the part of Great Britain. The ut­  
most allowable in such a case would be a  
1 v ’did declaration that in signing or rati­  
fy inR &#x27;I‘L&#x27; treaty, it was understood on the  
part of Great Britain, that nothing therein  
contained would be a bar to any measure  
■wh’ch, if no such treaty existed&quot; would be  
lawful as a retaliation against the * ensures  
•*i&quot; an enemy. And with such a declara­  
tion, it would be proper, on the part of the  
United Stales, to combine an equivalent  
protest against its being understood that  
either tha party or the British declaration  
■would derogate from any rights or immu­  
* nines, aginst the effect of such retalia­  
ting measures, which would lawfully ap­  
pertain to them, as a neutral nation, .in  
case no such treaty or declaration existed.  
Having given this view of the alterati­  
ons which are to be held essential, I pro­  
ceed to no-ice such others as, though not  
included in the ultimatum, are tube regar­  
ded as more or less deserving your best  
exertions. This will be more convenient­  
ly done by a review of the several arti­  
cles in their numerical order.  
I he 2d, 4th, and 5th, all relate to the  
trade and navigation between the two coun­  
tries. The two first make no change in the  
•tipui.itious of the treaty of 1794. The last  
has change !, and much for the better, the  
provisions of that treaty on the auuject of  
tonnage niul navigation.  
Two important questions, however, en­  
ter into an estimate of these articles.  
I lie first is, whether they are id he un­  
derstood as a bar to any regulations, such  
as navigation nets, which would merely  
establish a reciprocity with British regula­  
tions. Froift the construction which seems  
to have been always put on the same stipu­  
lations in the treaty of 1751, it is cone u­  
detl hat no such bar could be cieated, and  
consequently that the articles are in that  
respect unexceptionable. It may be well,  
nevertheless, to ascertain that the subiect  
  
JS viewed in this light by the British gov­  
eminent.  
The second question is, whether the par  
tics be, ov be not, mutual!) restrained from  
laying duties, as well as prohibitions, un  
favorably discriminating Lit ween articles  
exported to them, and like articles exploi t­  
ed to other nations  
According to the construction put by the  
United Sta&#x27;is on the same clauses in the  
treaty of 171)4, the mutual restraint was  
applicable to discriminations of both kinds.  
The British discriminating duties on ex.,  
pur s, introduced under the mime of con_  
voy doth s. ami since continued and aug  
meitUd umler o.her names, were accord  
iiigiy ati&amp;incn’rd, during the existence of  
the treaty, as infractions to its text. The  
British government, however, never yield­  
ed to cur construction, either in d scussi m  
or in practice. And it appear.1* fiorn what  
p ssed in your ncgociations on this subject,  
that the construction which is to prevail,  
admits discriminating duties no exports.  
In this point of view, the s ipulation me­  
fits very serious attention. It cannot he  
regarded as either reciprocal or lair in  
principle, or ns just and friendly in prac­  
tice.  
In the case c.f prohibitions, where bo h  
gorerftiiK-iii* are rn an equal fooling, be (  
/•fuse it is understood that both have the J  
■. ’Jth« tity to impose tli* m, neither is left at  
Ikter.y to exercise the authority.  
tv the case of duties, where the British  
f refitment possesses the authority to im_ I  
p .se them, N;it where it is well known that i  
toe authority K withheld from the govern- I  
meat of the V SUt*s by their constitution. I  
the ; rticlcs are silent, and of course the &lt;  
Briti -h government is left free to impose I  
discriftiimiting duties ou tin ir exports, .  
viiii*. no such duties can be imposed b\ &lt;  
ti.Ht of the U. States. Ho y will It lie in  
practice t Stating the exports of (;. Britain i  
*. ,i’v U Su es, at six millions fteijingon- i  
  
ly, the present duty of 4 percent levies a  
tax on the U. S. amounting to two hundred  
and lorty thousand pound*;, or one million,  
sixty-five thousand, six hundred dollai.;  
;.nd there is nothing, whilst the war in Eu  
rope checks competition there, and whilst  
obvious causes must tor a long time enfee­  
ble it here, that can secure us against fur­  
ther augmentations of the tribute.  
Even under u regulation placing the U.  
States on the footing of the most favored  
nation, it appears that the British govern­  
ment wouid Un.w into its treasury from our  
consumption, three-eighths of the revenue  
now paid into it by the U. States. Such a  
footing, however, would he material, os gi­  
ting the U. B. the benefit of the check ac&lt;  
cruing from the more manufacturing state  
of the Em&lt;pean nations. But lobe depri­  
ved of that check by the want of an article,  
putting us on the tooting of the nations most  
favored by G. Britain, nnJ at the same  
• ime deprivtd of our own checks by clau­  
ses, putting G. Britain on the commercial  
looting of the nations most favored by the  
U. States, would in effect c&lt; nfirm a foreign  
authority to tax the jreople of the United  
States, without the cha ice of reciprocity or  
redress.  
The British duty on exports to the U.  
States has another elFt-ct, not entirely to  
be disregarded. It proportionally uug.  
ments the price of British manufactures,  
re-exported from tire U S ates to other  
markets, and far promotes a direct sup­  
ply trom G. Britain, by her own merchants  
and ships. Should this not be the effect  
of her regulations as now framed, there is  
nothing tnat would 1 ibid a change of them,  
having that for its object.  
On these considerations it is enjoined up­  
on you by the president, to press, in the  
strongest terms, such an explanation or a­  
tnendtneni of this putt of the treaty, as  
will, if possible, restrain G. Britain altoge­  
ther from taxing exports to the U. States,  
r at least pi ice them on the footing of the  
must favored nation ; or it neither be at_  
&#x27;finable, such a change in the instrument  
ii other respects, as will reserve to the U.  
St.&#x27;tes the right to discriminate between  
G Britain, and other nations, in th&lt; ir /ir&amp;­  
/i//«» / /#, &gt;* ivm.i&#x27;t* &lt;vnlo .ltu/. ii  
  
hi iii tlie case of exports, permitted by  
thfe constitution. The unwillingness of the  
president to risk un entire failure of the  
projected accommodation with G. Britain,  
restrains him from making an amendment  
of th » p rt of the treaty, a sine qua non ;  
but lie considers it so reasonable, and so  
much called tor by the opinions and fee -  
ing-s of this country, thst he is eqally urx­  
it&#x27;us and confident with respect to a corn,  
pliancc on the par: of the British govern­  
ment.  
Article 6 This article, as taking the  
I case ot the West India trade out of any  
/general stipulation of privileges granted to  
other nations, may prove convenient, hv  
disincurnbering measures, which may be  
takta against the British monopoly, from  
questions of which that stipul don might  
otherwise he susceptible.  
Article 7. Though to remain if desired,  
would be more reasonable, without the last  
paragraph, or with a right only to accept  
pfaces and periods, at which the trade of  
the other party may not be permitted.  
Article 8. This article is frahntd with  
more accuracy than the 17th, on the same  
subject,In the treaty of 1794, and is im­  
proved by the additional paragraph at the  
close ot it. But as such general stipulati­  
ons have not been found of much avail in  
practice, and as it continues to be the wish  
of the president to avoid, especially at the  
present juncture, unnecessary confirmnti  
ons of the principe, that a neutral fi.,g  
does not protect enemies property, an o..  
mission ot :lie article is much preferred,  
unless it be so varied as to be free from this  
objection. This may easily be done, by  
substituting a general stipulation, “that in  
all cases wucie vessels shall be captured  
or detained f&gt; &lt;r any lawful cause, thf v shall  
be brought to the nearest or must cotive_  
inent port ; and such part only of the ar..  
ticks tin iioard as are confiscable by the  
mw ot nat; »is, shall be made prize; and  
the vessel, unless by that law subject nl-j  
so to confiscation, shall be at liberty to pro-&#x27;  
cecd, See ”  
f hi re ought to be the Ipss hesitation, cr. |  
‘he British side, in mnk i gihis change, as  
the article in ns present form, departs  
from that ot 1791, and there is the mor  
tea on on our side, for requiring the change,  
as the addition of “for other lawful cause,”  
alter specifying the two cases, of enemy’s  
propci ty and c ntraband of war, is proba  
bly valued by Great Britain as suppott&#x27;ne

pect to colonial trade. 1 he only case o

of capture is applicable, i» that of block -  
ados, which might havt been as easily spe  
t ified, as provided for by such a residuary  
phrase; and the pretext for appropriairg  
tiiis phrase to the case of the colonial trade,  
wouid be strengthened by the specific pro.,  
vision, in a subsequent article, for the cast  
of blockades.  
It cannot be aMedged that the specifica­  
tion of the two cases of ene.my’s property  
and contraband of war, is necessary to  
prevent uncertainty anil controversy ; the  
LT. States h;.v:ng sufficiently manifested  
their acquiescence in these causes of c«p­  
tnve. If there be a source of uncertainty  
and controversy, it is in the expressions  
“other lawful cause,” and “otherwise  
jonfiscable,” and this sou ce cou’.d not be  
lie reused by the change here proposed.  
.Article 9. 1 his article is an improvement  
if that on tin san.v subject, in the treaty of  
1791; inasmuch as it exetpis from the list  
if contraband, tar and pitch, when not bound  
on port of naval equipment; and when  
io bound, substitutes prc-emj.tn u for for.,  
titure. It has an advantage also, in the  
d tu.te renouncing the pr ncqilc of the Ur..  
i»h order, of June, 1803, against vessels  
et urn ng from places to which they had  
tarried contraband of war.  
On the other hand, it would not have  
&gt;cen unreasonable to expect that the Bri­  
ish government would, m a treaty w. h the  
J. States, have ini 3ted on no stipulation  
ess favorable than her stipulation on the  
imc subject, with Russia ; especially as  
he naval stores «xported from the U. S.  
ire equally the growth and produce of the  
: wintry.  
. Consistency, again, as well ns reason, e  
idently icqo&#x27;.red that the exception in fa­  
&#x27;cv of tar and pitch should have been ex­  
  
tended to tv:ry species of naval stores, e­  
qually applicable ta other uses than those  
of war, amides’inert to places, other titan  
those of na. si equipment.  
Lastly, it is observable, that even tur­  
pentine mul rosin are not included with tar  
and pitch in the favorable exceptions, tho’  
of a character so kindred as to leave no  
pretext for the distinction.  
Neither has the British government the  
slightest ground for regarding as a conces­  
sion, the stipulated immunity of a vessel,  
which, on her outward voyage, had carried  
contraband to a hostile port. &#x27;1 he princi­  
ple asserted by her order on that subject,  
is an innovation against the clearest right  
of neutrals, ns recognized and enforced e­  
ven by British cour s. The very language  
of the article implies that this js a //re_  
fence for the innovation These conside­  
rations urge a re-modification of the ar­  
ticle ; and they are strengthened by the  
great dislike of the president to formal  
recognitions, at this particular moment, of  
principles combated by some, and unfav  
orable to all neutral nations. So ineligible  
indeed, in his view, is any step tending in  
the least to retard the progress of these  
principles, that naval stores are to be left  
on n s ipulated list of contraband, in thee­  
vent, only, of an indexible refusal uf the  
British government to omit them ; nor are  
they to be retained in any event, without  
an addition or explanation that will except  
turpentine and rosin, as well as tar and  
pitch ; there being no plausible motive for  
ihe distinction ; and the quantity and va­  
lue of the two former exported from the  
Umted States, being found, on inquiry, to  
make them of equal importance with the  
two latter. It can scaicely be supposed  
that the British government will insist on  
this unwarrantable distinction. It is not  
ndeed improbable, that it has been a mere  
inadvertence. Bucli an inference is favor­  
ed by the circumstance of your speaking,  
in your comment on this article, ot tar and  
lur/ientine, as being the two exceptions —  
Whatever the true state of the cr.se mav  
oc, it is thought better to omit a list of  
contraband altogether, than not to include  
in the exception from it, tuvpeiaine and  
rcftill. Mil&#x27;ll n« tut- nni) nileli  
  
«/Article 10. The abuse of blockades has  
been so extravagant, anti has produced so  
much vexation ur.d injury to the fair com­  
merce of the U S. that as on one hand it  
is of great importance to find a remedy ;  
so, cn the other, It is the more necessary,  
diat the remedy should be such us not itselt  
to admit of abuse. The considerations which  
reconciled you to the tenor of the article,  
as at least a consti uctive approach to a so  
iid provision for the case, are allowed the  
weight which they justiy merit; whilst the  
course which your discussions took, are  
a proof of the exertions which were used  
to give the article a more satisfactory form  
1 lie failure, however, of the British com­  
Oihsioners to substantiate a favorable con­  
struction of the article, by a proper expla­  
natory letter addressed io you, with their  
reasons for refusing to insert in the treaty ,  
a definition of blockade, justify apprehen­  
sions that the vague terms which alone]  
were permitted to compose the article,  
would he more likely to be turned against  
our object, by courts and cruizers, and per­  
: haps by a less liberal cabinet, than to re­  
ceive in practice the more favorable con­  
j struction which candor anticipated.  
I The British doctrine of blockades ex_  
err.phficd by practice, is different from that  
j of all other nations, as well as from the  
reason and natureof that operation of war.  
The mode of notifying a blockade by pro­  
clamations Sc diplomatic communications,  
of what too is to be done, rather of what,  
in fact, hid been done, is more p &#x27;rticular­  
ly the evil which is to be corrected. A­  
gainst these nominal blockades, the article  
does not sufficiently close the door. The  
p1 earn hie itself, wnicli refers to distance of  
situation, as a frequent causa of not know  
ing that a blockade exists, tho* in one view  
giving the U. States the advantage of a fa  
vorable presumption ; in another view, car­  
r os an admission unfavorable to our prin­  
ciple, which rests not on the distance of  
-.tuatun, but on the nature of the case,  
and which consequently rejects in all ca  
ses !he legal sufficiency of notifications in  
the British mode. The preamble is liable  
to the remark also, that it separates our  
cause from the common one of neutral na­  
tions in .1 less distant situation, and that  
the principle of it may even he pleaded a­  
&lt;atnst us in the case of blockades in the  
\\ &lt; st Indies. These considerations would  
have been ( u*weighed by the advantage of  
establishing a satisfactory rule on this sub_  
  
***»&#x27;;■ »&#x27;i mu iruue; nut wit limit  
such a provision in the article, it is tho’t  
less advisable to retain it, than to trust to  
the law of blockades as laiil down by all  
writers of authority, as supported by all  
treaties which di fine if, and more evpcci..  
Hy »• recognized and communicated to  
:be U States, by the British government,  
rirongh its minister here, in last;  
not ton emio tlie influence which the course  
of events and the sentiments of the mari­  
time nations in friendship with Great Bri­  
tain may have, in producing a reform on  
this subject.  
The last paragraph, tho’ subjecting per­  
soi.a in civil ns well as military service of  
.in enemy, to capture in our vessels, may  
prove a valuable safeguard to ordinal y pas­  
sengers and mariners, against the wrongs  
w Jch lb y now frequently experience, and  
which affect the vessel as well as them­  
selves.  
-drt&#x27;clc 12. It is much regretted that a  
ptovision could not be obtained against the  
practice of British cruizers, in hovering  
and takmg stntinns for the purpose of sur­  
prising the trade going in and out of cur  
harbors ; a practice which the British go.  
vernment felt to lie so injurious to the dig  
nlty and rights of that nation, at periods  
when it was neutral. An addiiion of two  
miles, nevertheless, to our maritime juris­  
diction, so far as to protect neutral and o­  
ihcr unarmed vessels, notwithstanding its  
want of any thing like a due reciprocity,  
is not without its value. This value will  
:t! the same time be very materially im­  
paired, if the stipulation cannot be libera­  
ted from the clause requiring the consent  
nf he tther belligerent nations, as necov  
»ary to exempt their vessels from search  
md seizure. None of the other belligerent  
nations have, in fact, unarmed vessels en  
jaged in our trade, nor arc they likely to  
lave any during the war $ aod these alone  
  
could derive advantage from their cons*nr;  
their armed vessels being expressly  
excepted. There cun be no motive  
with theta, therefore, to agree to the regu­  
lation. They would rather be* tempted to  
.embarrass it, with a v:cw to continue as  
much as possible vexations which lessen  
the mutual good will of the pn ies And  
as by their not agreeing to the regulation,  
the right is reserved to British cruij rs-.o  
examine all vessels for the purpose of as­  
certaining whether they inay not belong to  
a belligerent, the disturbance of our trade  
might be lit le diminished within the addi­  
tional two miles. Besides the mere inter­  
ruption of a search concerning the vessel,  
it is hardly to be expected from the gene­  
ral spirit of cruize rs, that the search will  
not be extended to the cargo; and if the  
latter should be thus cr otherwise found  
or suspected to be of a confiscable sort,  
that the temptation to capture would be  
resisted, the less so perhaps, as the increa­  
sed distance from the shore, and the in­  
creased difficulty of proof, would favor the  
chance of condemnation, or at least coun­  
tenance courts in their propensity to refuse  
damages and costs to the claimants.  
To secure the advantage promised by  
thi~ article, the right of search ought to  
|be suppressed altogether, the additional  
space enjoying in this respect the same im  
I inunitv as is allowed to the marine league.  
To this object the president wishes your  
endeavors to be dir- cteiL  
1 i eserve for the 19th article another view  
of the subject, which will claim vour at­  
tention.  
*1rticic 13. The general provision here  
copied from the treaty of 1794, though not  
hitherto found of much effect, in&#x27;control­  
ing the licentiousness of cnBzers, and ve­  
try different from the special rules in favor  
«:t neutrals contaim d in mrst treaties which  
&#x27;ouch the subject of search, enters very  
[properly into a comprehensive arrange­  
ment between two friendly nations. The  
introductory sentence alone, which consists  
of new matter, invites particular notice.  
1 lie expressions “ as the course of the war  
may possibly permit,” and “observing, as  
much as possible, the acknowledged prin­  
rinlpt ant! min. ,1... 1-... _r _»&gt;  
  
however favorably intended by the British  
r.egocivors, will not improbably be constru­  
ed into a rclaxati. 1 of the neutral right  
in favor of belligerent pleas, drawn from  
circumstances of which belligerent agents  
will be the judges. The expressions may  
easily he so varied ns to refer simply to the  
law of nations for the rule, and to the friend­  
ship of the parties for the spirit, accord*  
ing to which the search is to he conducted.  
If such an amendment should be deliberate­  
ly rejected by the British government, it  
will be a proof cf a lurking danger, that  
will recommend an omission of what re­  
lates to the subject of search, in preference  
to retaining i&#x27;.  
Articles 14, 15 and 16, call for no paiti­  
cular observation.  
Article 17. So much of this article as  
relates to the admission of ships of war,  
would be advantageously exchanged for a  
general stipulation, allowing cn this subject,  
he privilege granted to the most favored  
nation. It would then be in the power of  
the United States to limit the number ad­  
missible at one time, whereas such an in­  
definite admission of Bri&#x27;.isli ships imposes  
on our neutrality a like indulgence to the  
fleets of other nations. Suc.h an alteration  
of the article is the more reasonable and  
important, as there will bo little recipro..  
city in its operation ; the U. States having  
but few ships, and the inconveniences from  
British ships in our ports, being much grea­  
ter than those from our ships, in British  
ports.  
The engagement to treat officers of the  
navy with respect, is not only too indefinite  
to be enforced by penal regulations, hatim­  
plirsa reproachful defect of hospitality ami  
civility. In this light it was viewed du­  
ring the discussions of the treaty of 1794.  
1 he c luuse prob ibly grew then out of recent  
Complaints, well or ill founded, of disres­  
pectful conduct on some occasion towards  
British &lt; fficers If latter occurrences  
were to be consulted, it weald be a more  
apt provision now to stipu’ate for thr pun­  
ishment of naval commanders making in­  
sulting and ungrateful returns for the kind­  
m ss and respect shewn them in our ports  
and towns. The president makes almost a  
poim of evcliuling this pAft of the article.  
Arliclen IP and 19, already noticed.  
Article 20. Considering the great num­  
ber of British merchants residing in the U.  
Slates, with the great means of influence  
possessed bv them, and the very few Ame­  
rican merchants who reside in Great Bri­  
tain, the inconvenience which may he in­  
ridrnl fr. enrh o iMwi-d.i.u _•  
  
tim ing a state of war, is evidently much  
greater on cur side than cn the other. In  
this view the stipulation is very unequal.  
1 he liberal spiri&#x27; of it is, at the sa me time,  
highly commendable. It were only to be  
wished that the readiness on one side to  
make sacrifices of this sort, to a spirit  
which ought to pervade every part of a  
treaty between the parties, had been less  
met by an apparent disposition on the other  
stde, rather to extort from, than to emu­  
late it.  
Article 2t Not agreeable, but not to be  
an insuperable obstacle.  
Article 22, is altogether proper.  
Article 23 This article, granting the  
privileges of the most favored nation,  
seems to require explanation, if not alter­  
ation. The terms “ shall continue to be  
*he footing of the meat favored nation,”  
implies that the parties are now on that  
footing. To look no further, the discrimi­  
nation between exports from Great Britain  
to Europe and to the U. S. is a prouf that  
the fact is otherwise.  
But mny not the expression be construed  
into a barrier against laws on the pan of  
the U. States, establishing a reciprocity  
with the British navigation act, and West  
India regulation* ? It might be impolitic  
to extend such laws to all other nations, as  
it would he unjust to extend them to such  
as had not adopted the restrictive system  
of Great Britain. And j et a discriminati­  
on might be arraigned as not conttt/liing  
Great Britain on the same footing with o­  
Iher nations.  
1 he object of this article, so far ash is a  
legitimate one, would he sufficiently provi­  
ded for by a mutual stipulation of the pri­  
vileges in trade and navigation, enjoyed by  
the most favon d nation ; and such stipu­  
  
lations moreover, ctit»V »n justice to’mrtntt

ri-e you, in the event of a rejection of every ar­

only, (o admit an article to the following effect:  
•* It is agreed that after the term of  
months computed from the exchange of ratifi­  
cations and during a wnr in which cither of

vvill pc-rmit any seaman, not being its own ci­  
tizen or subject, and being a citizen or subject  
of the other party, who sit *11 not have been  
for two years at least prior to that date, con­  
stantly, anti voluntarily, in the service, or with­  
in the jurisdiction of the parties respectively,  
to enter, or be employed on board any of its  
vessels navigating thy. high sea? : and proper  
regulations, enforced by adequate penalties,  
shall be mutually established, for distinguish­  
» &quot;mfJ he seamen of the parties respectively, and  
for givipg full effect to this stipulation.”  
You wdl observe that the proposition is so  
framed *s not to comprehend among British  
seamen, those who have been made citizen*

If an attempt should be made to bind the  
United States to deliver up the seamen to G.  
Britain, instead of excluding them merely from  
their own service, you are to say at once, that  
it would be inconsistent with our principles,  
and cannot be acceded to  
It will occur to you that the period of two  
years 1 ■ i*» been chosen, in allusion to the ptriod  
established by Great Britain, as sufficiently in­  
corporating alien, with British stamen. Her  
own cxaniole at least inns* have weight with  
her, and the implied appeal to it, maybe of  
use in shielding ih« measure against public  
prejudices, to which the government may  
not wish to expose iise&#x27;f.  
It uc British government be not predeter,  
mined against a fi iindly adjustment, it is con­  
ndently presumed that the concession propo­  
i«‘i, will not only overuuiie all obstacles to  
your success on the essential points, but may  
he tun* d to account in promoting the aaiena­  
ment of the oilier article*.  
Should the concession, however, contrary to  
all e:.pectaiion, not suersed, even a* to the es­  
sential objects, the course prescribed hv pru­  
dence wifi be to signify your purpose af trans­

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  
M. - .0, 1U07.  
Gentlemen, ,  
My letter of Marcli 18 acknow­  
ledged the receipt of your dispatches, and of the  
treaty signed on tiie 31st December, of which  
Mr. Purviaiicc was the bearer, and signified that  
the sentiments and views of the president, form­  
ed on the actual p- sture of our affairs with G.  
Britain, would, without any useless delav, be  
oommr.riicaled. The subject is accordingly re­  
sumed in this dispatch, with which Mr. Purvi­  
ance will be charged Tp render bis passage the  
more sure and convenient, be takes it in the sloop  
ot war, Wasp, which will convey hi;n to a Bri  
tish port, oh her way to the Mediterranean, She  
will touch also at a French port, probably L&#x27;Ot  
l&#x27;iviit. with dispatches for Gen. Armstrong and  
Mr. Bnwdoin, and will afford u good opportunity  
for any cpmmunicaU .ns y ou may have o_c sion  
id make to those g. mler.ien.  
The presid nt lias seen, in. your exertions, tp  
accomplish die great objects of your instructions,  
ample pi oofs of i.i.-L zeal and patriotism m which  
•c confided ; and feels deep regret, that your  
success has not c*&gt;: responded with the reasonu­  
denessof your, propositions, and the ahilitv w ith  
which they were supported. IJe laments more  
specially that tlie British government has not  
yielded to the just and cogent considerations  
which forbid the practice of its cmizers in visit­  
in ,• and impressing the crews of our vessels, co­  
vered by an independent flag, and guarded In the  
l.iwsof the high seas, which ought to be sacred  
witii all nations.  
  
i ne rrcsiuent continues to regard this subject  
ill the light in which it has been pressed on the  
justice and friendship of Great Britain. He can­  
not reconcile it with his duly to our sea-farm*1* ci­  
tizens, or with the sensibility or sovereignty of  
the nation, to r.cogni/e even constructively, a  
principle that would expose on the high sens, their  
liberty, their lives, cvc.y thing, in a word that is  
dearest to the human heart, to the capripious or  
interested sentences whirl) may be pronounced a­  
gainst their allegiance, by officers of a foreign  
government, whom neither the law-of nations,  
noreveu the laws of that government will allow  
&gt; decide on the ownership or character of lie  
minutest article of property found in a like situ­  
ation.  
It has a great and necessary weight also, with  
the president, that the views of congress, as ma­  
nifested during the session which passed tin; non­  
importation act, as wl-11 as the primary rank field  
by tn* object of securing American crews against;  
British impressment, among the objects which  
suggested the solemnity of an extraordinary mis­  
sion, are opposed to any conventional arrange­  
ment, which, without effectually providing for  
that object, would disarm the United States ot the  
means deemed most clig.ble as an eventual reme­  
dy.  
It is considered, moreover, by the president, the  
more reasonable • hat the necess ity concession in  
this case, shouln *e wiui‘*. i&gt;v Grc, 1 Britain, mi her  
tlian by the United States, on the double coiside  
ration, first, that a concession on our part, would  
violate both a moral and political duty of the go  
verntnent tdoar citizens, which wcvtH not be .In­  
cuse on the other side ; second!;, that a gre. tir  
number of American citi/eiu, than of British sub­  
jectsare, in fact, impressed P-nn or • ess os&quot;,  
and that, consequently, more of wron? is done to  
the United States, than off :di« t . Great Britain :  
taking even her own claim H&gt;r the legal criteri­  
on.  
On these grounds, the president ia congtrr.iofd  
to decline any arrang ment, To maf or infinn, ,!,  
which docs not comprise a provision against im­  
pressments from American vessels on c o.gli  
seas, and which wotiid, n it withstanding, be a bar  
to legislative flleuiurcS, such as congress have  
thought, or niuy tli rk proper to adopt, for &lt; ou­

a view tu such alterations •!&#x27; the instrument sign­  
ed on the 31 it December, us may render it ac­  
ceptably to the United States.  
That you muv the more lullv understand his  
impressions and purposes, 1 will explain the alte­  
rations which are to be regarded as essential;  
an? proceed then to such observations on the se­  
veral articles, us w ill siiew the other alterations  
which are to be attempted, and the degree of im­  
portance respectively attached toth^m.­  
1 si. Without a provision against impressments,  
substantially such as is cOnteyupbde&#x27;d in your ori­  
ginal instructions no treaty is to ue concluded.  
2d, The eleventh article &lt;)n the subject of co­  
lonial trade, cannot be admitted, unless freed  
from the conditions which restrict to the market  
of Surope, the re-exportation of colonial produce,  
and to European articles, the supplies to the colo­  
nial market.  
3d The change made by the 3d article in the  
provisions of the treaty of 1794, relative to the  
trade with Uie British possessions in Hictia, by li­  
miting the privilege to a direct trade Jrom. the U.  
States, as well us to them, is deemed an insuper­  
able objection.  
?th. Either an express provision is to he insist­  
ed on for indemnifyvug sufferers from wrongful  
captures, or at least a saving in some form or o­  
ther, of their rights against any implied abandon­  
ment.  
5th. Articles 18 and 19 to be so altered as to  
leuve the United States free, as a neutral nation,  
to keep and place other belligerent nations on&#x27; an  
equality w ith Great Britain.  
6th. No such alternative as is presented by the  
declaratory note on the subject of the French  
decroe &lt;A November 21st, 1806, will be admis­  
sible.  
  
* i iiciiuci ii j»rw­  
vision on the subject of impressments iiulispen­  
S:.I le, lime been already sufficiently explained.  
Second. The essential importance of the a­  
mmdment required in tire 11th article, results  
fiom the extensive cHect which the article,if un­  
amended, would have on the system of our com  
nierce as hitherto carried on, with the sanction or  
acquiescence of Great Britain herself.  
It was hoped that the British government in  
Tegulutinq the subject of this article, wotdd at  
least have yielded to the example ol’ its treaty  
with Russia. It could not have been supposed  
that a modification would he insisted on, which  
shuts to our neutral commerce important channels  
left open by the adjudications of British courts,  
and particularly l»y the principle officially commu­  
nicated by that government to thi::, through Mr.  
King-, in the j ear 1801.  
According to that principle and those adjudi­  
cations, the indirect trade through our neutral  
ports was i.s free from enemy colonies, to every  
other part of the world, as to Europe’; and as free  
to such colonics, in the articles of all other coun­  
tries, as in European articles.  
According to the tenor of the article, and the  
general prohibitory principle assumed by Great  
Britsin, to which it has an implied reference, the  
productions both of the continental and of the in­  
sular colonies in America, can no longer be re­  
•\ported as heretofore to any part of Asia or A­  
ii&#x27;iea, or even of America, and consequently can  
no longer enter into the trades carried on from  
the United States, to tiic Asiatic or African  
shores -t the Mediterranean, nor to any of the  
places beyond the Cape of Good Hope, offering  
a market for them ; nor finally to any other ene­  
Ji&gt;y or neutral colonies in this quarter, to which  
in reason, as well as according to practice, they  
ought to be as re-exportable as to the countries  
hi Europe to which such colonies belong.  
In like manner the importations from beyond  
the Cape of Good Hope, more especially the cot­  
ton fabi ics of China and India, can no longer he  
Sent as heretofore to the Wesl-Indies, or the Spa­  
nish Main, where they not only now viehl a great  
profit to our merchants, but being mixed in car- |  
jpn ■; with the produce of this country, facilitate  
and encourage the trade in the latter&#x27; Besides  
the eacct of the article in abridging so materially  
our valuable commerce, the distinction which it  
introduces between the manufacturers of Europe  
and those &lt;it China and India, is chargeable with  
evils of another sort. In many cases it might not  
be easy to pronounce on the real origin of the ar­  
ticles. It is not improbable that suppositious at­  
tempts also might be occasionally made, by the  
least scrupulous traders. With such pretexts as  
these, arguing from the abuse made of less plau­  
sible ones, tite interruptions and vexations of our  
trade, by the greedy cruisers which swarm on  
the ocean, could not fail to be augmented in a de­  
gree not a liltl- enforcing the objection to the ar­  
ticle in its present form.  
  
me praiuuiiury principle or C/rcat Britain  
docs uot extend to tlie case of a colonial trade  
Usually open, and no judicial decision lias profess­  
edly applied ihe principle to such a trade, it is a  
ream nuble inference, that .the article will not be  
so construed as to interfere with the trade of that  
description, between enemy colonies beyond the  
Cape of Good Hope, and other countries and  
P&gt; rts in that quarter. But on the other hand, it  
may n&lt; 1 be amiss to guard against a construction  
ol the article that would abolish the rule observ­  
ed in the prize courts ol Great Britain, which,  
in the case of the eastern colonies, presumes that  
tlie^c ports were always open, and thereby throws  
on the captors, instead of the claimants, the dis­  
au • antage of proving the fact in question.  
y t is observable, that the duration of this article  
is l.inded to the period of the present hostilities,  
whilst the others are to be in force for ten years ;  
so that il there should he a peace and a renewal  
of the war, as is very possible, within the latter  
period, the onerous part of the bargain would  
survive a part, in consideration of which, they  
were assumed. Justice and reciprocity evident*  
Iv require that the more important articles of the  
treaty should be regarded as conditions of each  
other, and therefore that they should be co-durn­  
blc. In this point of view, you will bring the  
subject under reconsideration; and without ma­  
king this particular amendment an ultimatum,  
press it with all the force which it merits. This  
amendment ouijht to be the less resisted on the  
JB: itish side, as it would still leave to that side, an  
advantage resulting from the nature of the two  
great objects to be attained by the United States,  
namely, the immunity of our crews, and of our  
neutral commerce, w hich are connected with a  
S&#x27; ate of war only ; whereas the stipulations valu­  
ed by Great Britain, will operate constantly  
throughout the period of the treaty, as w*ll in a  
state of peace, as in a state of war.  
Whatever term may he finally settled for the  
Continuance of this regulation, it will be proper  
to n tain the clause which saves the right involv­  
. cd in the article from any constructive abandon­  
ment or abridgement. Even the temporary mo­  
dification of the right, as it will stand without  
the inadmissible restrictions now in the article,  
is considered as an important sacrifice on the part  
of the United Stales to their desire of friendly  
adjustment with Great Britain. To an admission  
of the article with these restrictions, the presi­  
dent prefers the footing promised to th* colonial  
trade, by the deference of Great Britain for the  
m odime pi*wers, and by an unfettered right of  
the United States, to adapt their regulations to  
the course which her policy may take.  
That the operation of the article in its present  
form, might be more fully understood, it was  
tnought proper to avail the public of the ideas of  
a. rii.ze i of great intelligence and experience  
■with respect to our commerce. Mis remarks,  
contained in . paper herewith rftclosed, afford a  
valuable elucidation o« the subject. They will  
Suggest at the same time, some explanatory pre­  
cautions x* oil by of attention, particularly in the  
r„ of articles, which paying no duty on impor­  
tation into (he U ited States* do trot fall under the  
regulation of draw hacks ; sud in the case of se­  
curing b&gt; bond, instead of actually paying, the  
duties allowed to he drawn back. I&lt; appears b-,  
the observations in your letter of January 3d, that  
  
tne bond was understood, as »t surely ought to be,  
equivalent to actual payment. But this is a point  
so material, that it cannot be too explicitly guard­  
ed against the misinterpretation «f the interest­  
ed cruizers, and the ignorance or perverseness of  
inferior courts.  
Third. The necessity of the change required in  
tlie third article, in order to secure an indirect, as  
well as a direct trade to the British East-Indies,  
will he fully explained by the observations which  
have been obtained from several of our best inform­  
ed citizens on that subject, and which are here­  
with enclosed-.  
As this latitude of intercourse was stipulated  
by the 13th article of the treaty of 1794, as judi­  
cially expounded by tlic British sujierior courts ;  
as it was enjoyed by the United States prior to that  
epoch, and has been always enjoyed, both before  
and since bv other friendly nations ; and as then:  
is reason to believe that the British government  
lias been at all times ready, since the article ex­  
pired, to renew it in its original form, it may just­  
ly be expected that the inserted innovation will  
not be insisted on. Should the expectation fail,  
the course preferred is to drop the article altoge­  
ther, leaving (be trade on the general footing  
of the most favored nation, or even trusting  
to the interest of Great Britain for such regulati­  
ons as may correspond with that of the United  
States.  
  
siiouiu me negociation take up the East-India  
article ot tile treaty of 1794, you will find several  
amendments suggested in the extracts above re­  
ferred to, sonic of which may be attempted with  
ti&gt;e greater chance of success, as they are harm­  
less, if not favorable to the British system. To  
these suggestions may be added, a privilege to  
American vessels of touching at the Cape of  
Good Hope. The objection to such a stipulation, !  
under the present defeasible title of Great Bri-1  
tain to the Cape, may be obviated by a descriptive  
provision, not necessarily applicable to it, in the  
event of its restitution by a treaty of peace, but  
embracing it in case the British &#x27;title should be  
established by that eventIt may be agreed  
“ that vessels of the United States may touch for  
refreshment at all.tlic ports and places in the pos­  
session of Great Britain orr, or in the African or  
Asiatic seas.”  
Fourth. Without a provision, cr reservation,  
as to the claims of indemnity, an abandonment of  
them may be inferred from a treaty, as being a  
luial settlement of existing controversies. It can­  
not l&gt;o presumed, that a precaution against such  
an inference, in any mode that may lx. most ef­  
fectual, can be bpposed or complained of. C*n  
the contrary, it excites just surprise, that so  
much resistance should be made to indemnifica­  
tions supported by the clearest rules of right, and  
by a precedent in a former treaty between the  
two countries, from which so many other arti­  
cles have been copied. The only clorable plea  
for refusing the desired provision, flows from a  
presumption, not only that the British courts are  
disposed, but that they are competent, to the  
purpose of cotnplete redress. Not to repeat  
observations heretofore made on this subject, an  
unanswerable one is suggested by the clause in  
1 . . article of the treaty, annulling the  
principle, or rather the pretence, that vessels  
without contraband of war on board, returning  
from a port to which they fiad carried articles of  
that sort, were subject to capture and condem­  
nation. Previous, even to this .recognition, it  
had been settled as the jaw of nations, by the  
British high court »&gt;f admiralty, that vessels so  
circumstanced, were exempt from interruption.  
Yet a British order of August 1803, expressly  
declares them to be lawful prizes ; and it is well  
known, that a number of American vessels, have  
been seized and condemned under that order.  
Here then is a class of wrongs, indeniably enti­  
tled to redress, and which neither can nor ever  
could possibly be redressed, in the ordinary  
course ; it being an avowed rule, with the prize  
« ourts, to follow such orders of the government,  
xs either expounding or suspending the law of  
nations. Even cases not finally decided, would  
probably he considered as falling under the rule  
existing avthe time ofthe capture, &amp; consequent­  
ly be added to this catalogue, of acknowledged,  
but unredressed injuries.  
1- if th.^ Articles 18 and 19—An effect of these  
articles is to secure to British cruizers and their  
prizes a treatment in American ports, more fu­  
vorable than will be permitted to those of an ene­  
my ; with a saving of contrary stipulations alrea­  
dy made, and a prohibition of any such in future.  
— As none of our treaties with the belligerent na­  
tions (France excepted) stipulated to their crui­  
zers an equality in this respect, and as there are  
parties to the war, with whom we have no trea­  
ties, It follows that a discrimination is made, in  
the midst of war, between the belligerent nati­  
ons, which it will not he in the power of die U­  
nited States to redress.  
  
w eigniy c» nsiucrations would dissuade from  
such a deviation from a strict equality towards  
belligerent nations, if stipulated at a time least  
liable to objection. But it would be impossible  
to justify a stipulation, in the midst of war, sub­  
stituting for an existing equality, an advantage to  
one of the belligerent parties over its adversaries ;  
and that too, without any compensation to the  
neutral, shielding its motive from the appearance  
of mere partiality. &#x27; Hitherto the United States  
have avoided as much as possible such embar­  
rassments and with this view have gratuitously  
extended to all belligerents the privileges stipu­  
lated to any of them.&#x27; Great-Britain has had the  
benefit of this scrupulous policy. She can there­  
fore with the less reason expect it to be relinquish­  
ed for her benefit.  
The last paragraph of the 19th article, estab­  
lishes a justprinciple as to the responsibility of  
amcutral nation, whose territory has been vior  
latcd by captures within its limits ; but bv ex­  
tending the principle to the two miles added to  
Our jurisdiction by the 12th article, qualified as  
that addition is, it is made peculiarly important  
that an amendment should take place.  
Passing by the failure of a reciprocity, either  
in the terms or the probable operationof the res­  
ponsibility, the United States seem to hound to  
claim from the enemies of Great-Britain, redress  
for a hostile act, which such enemies may not  
have renounced their right to commit within the  
given space ; making thus the United States lia­  
ble to the one party, without a correspondent li­  
ability to them in the other party ; and at the  
same time entitled Great-Britain to redress for  
acts committed by her enemies, which she has  
reserved to herself a right to commit against them.  
Should all the other belligerent nations, con­  
traryto probability, concur in the addition of  
two miles to our jurisdiction, this construction  
Would still he applicable to their armed ships ;  
those Unarmed alone being within the additional  
immunity against British cruizers ; and the atm­  
ed as well as the unarmed ships of Great Britain,  
being expressly within the additional responsibi­  
lity et the United States.  
Sixth. No treaty can be sanctioned bv the U­  
mled States, under the alternative presented by  
the declaratory note on the subject of the French  
decree of November 21. It&#x27;is hoped that the  
occasion which produced it will have vafushed,  
and that it will riot be renewed in connection  
with a future signature on the part of Great­  
Britain. i he utmost allowable in such a case  
wmiiIc! be a candid declaration that, in signing or  
ratifying the treaty, it was understood on the  
part of Great-Britain, that nothing therein eon­  
tamed would he a bar to any measures, which if  
no such treaty existed, would he lawful as a re­  
talintion against the measures of an enemy. And  
with such a declaration, it would be proper, on  
the part of the United States, to combine an  
equivalent protest against its bring understood,  
that either the treaty or the British declaration  
would derogate from any righ&#x27;s or immunities,  
against the effi et of such retaliating measures  
which would lawfully appertain to them, ns a  
neutral nation, in case no such trcatvor declara­  
tion existed.  
  
Having given this view of the alterations which  
are to be held essential, I proceed to notice such  
others as, though not included in the ultimatum,  
are to be regarded as more or less deserving your  
t»est exertions. This will he most conveniently  
dune l»y a review of the several articles in their  
numerical order.­  
The 2,d 4th &amp; 5th, all relate *o&#x27;tijc trade &amp;. na­  
vigation between the two countries. The two  
first make no change in the stipulations of the  
treaty of 1794. The last lias changed, and much  
for the better, the provisions of that treaty on the  
subject of tonnage aiul navigation.  
Two important questions however, enter into  
an estimate of these articles.  
The first is, whether they are t© be understood  
as a bar to any regulations, such as navigation  
acts, which would merely establish a reciprocity  
with British regulations. From the construction  
which stems to have been always put on the  
same stipulations in the treaty of1794, it is con­  
chided that no such bar could be created and con­  
sequently that the articles arc in that respect un­  
exceptionable. It may be well, nevertheless, to  
ascertain that the subject is viewed in this light  
by the British government.  
The second question is, whether the parties  
be, or be not, mutually restrained from laying  
duties, as well as prohibitions, unfavorably’dis­  
criminating between articles exported to them,  
ami like articles exported to other nations.  
According to the construction put by the  
United Sates on the same clause in the treaty of  
1794, the mutual restraint was applicable Indis­  
criminations of both kinds. The British discri­  
minating duties on exports, introduced under the  
name of convoy duties, and since continued ami  
augmented under other names, were accordingly  
combated, during the existence of the treaty, as  
  
iMiauumsui us i lie i&gt;riusii government,  
however, ncv?r yielded to our construction, ei­  
ther in. discussion or in practice. And it ap­  
pears from what passed in your negotiations on  
tins subject, that the construction which is to  
prevail, admits discriminating duties on exports.  
In this point of view, the stipulation merits  
very serious attention. It cannot he regarded  
as either reciprocal or fair in principle, or as just  
and friendly in practice.  
In the case of prohibitions, where both go­  
vernments are on an equl footing, because it is un­  
derstood that both have the authority to impose  
them, neither is left at liberty to exercise the au­  
thority.  
In the case of duties, where the British go­  
vernment possesses the authority to impose them,&#x27;  
but where it is well known that’ the authority is  
withheld from the government of the United  
States by their constitution, the articles are silent,  
and of course the British government is left ti ee  
to impose discriminating duties on their exports,  
whilst no such duties can be imposed by that of  
the United States. How will it be in practice ?  
Stating the exports of Great-Britain to the United  
States at six millions sterling only, the present  
duty of four per cent, levies a tax on the United  
States amounting to 240 thousand pounds, or one  
million, sixty five thousand, six hundred dollars ;  
and there is nothing, whilst the war in Europe  
checks competition iKoro, tnul whilst obvious  
causes must for a long time enfeeble it here, that  
can secure us against further augmentations of  
the tribute.  
Even under a regulation placing the United  
States on the footing of the most favored nation,  
it appears that the British’government would draw  
into its treasury from our consumption thrqc-&#x27;  
eights of the revenue now paid into it by the  
U. S. Such a footing, however, would he material,  
as givingjthe United States the benefit of the  
check accruing from the more manufacturing state  
of the European nations. But to be deprived of  
that check by.tlie want of an article putting us on  
the footing the nations most favored by Great  
Britain, and at the same time deprived of our own  
checks by clauses, putting Great-Britain on the  
coriirnercial footing of the nations most favored  
hv the United States, would in effect confirm a  
foreign authority to tax the people of the United  
States , without the chance ef reciprocity or re­  
dress.  
The British duty on exports of the U. State*;  
has another effect, not entirely to be disregard­  
ed. It proportionally augments the price of Bri­  
tish manufactures, re-exported from the United  
Stales to other markets, and so far promotes a  
direct supply from Great-Britain, by her own  
merchants and ships. Should this not be the ef­  
fect of her regulations as now framed, there is  
nothing that would forbid a change of them, ha­  
ving that for its object.  
  
&lt;jn these considerations it is enjoined up­  
on you by the President, to press in the stron­  
gest terms, such an explanation or amend­  
ment of this part of the treaty, as will, if  
possible, restrain Great-Britain altogether  
from taxing exports to the United States, or  
at least, place them on the footing of the most  
favored nation, or if neither be attainable,  
such a change in the instrument in other  
respects, as will reserve to the United States  
the right to discriminate between Great­  
Britain and other nations in their prohibiti­  
on of exports, the only discrimination in the  
case of export, permitted by the constituti­  
on. The unwillingness of the President to  
risk an entire failure of the projected accom­  
modation with Great-Britain, restrains him  
from making an amendment of this part of  
the treaty, a sine qua non ; but lie considers  
it to be reasonable, and so much called for  
by the opinion and feelings of this country,  
that he is equally anxious and confident with  
respect to a compliance on the part of the  
British government.  
Article 6.—This article, as taking the  
case ot the YVest-India trade out of any ge­  
neral stipulation of priviledges granted to  
other nations, may prove convenient, by dis­  
ihcumberlng measures, which may be taken  
against the British monopoly, from questions  
of which, that stipulation might otherwise  
be susceptible.  
Article 7.—Though to remain if desi­  
red, would be more reasonable, without the  
last paragraph, or, with a right only, to  
except places and periods, at which the  
trade of the other party may not be permit­  
ted.  
Article 8.—This article is framed with  
more accuracy than the 17th, on the same  
subject, in the treaty of 1794, and is impro­  
ved by the additional paragraph at the close  
of it. But as such general stipulations have  
not been found of much avail in practice, &amp;  
as it continues to be the wish of the President  
to avoid, especially at the present juncture,  
unnecessary confirmations of the principle,  
that a neutral flag does not protect enemies  
property, an omission of the article is much  
preferred, unless it be so varied as to be free  
from this objection. This may easily be done  
by substituting a general stipulation, “ that  
in all cases where vessels shall be captured  
or detained for any lawful cause, they shall  
be brought to the nearest or most conveni­  
ent port ; and such part only of the articles  
dn hoard, as arc confiscable by the law of  
nations, shall be made prize ; and the ves­  
sel, unless by that law, subject also to con­  
fiscation, shall be at liberty to proceed, Ike.”  
There ought to be the less hesitation on  
the British side, in making this change, as  
the article in its present form, departs from  
that of 1794 ; and there is the more reason,  
on our side-, for requiring the change, as the  
addition ot “or for other lawful cause,” af­  
ter specifying the two cases, of enemy’s pro­  
perty, and contraband of war, is probably  
valued by Great-Britain as supporting her  
doctrine, and impairing ours, with respect  
  
to colonial trade.. The only case other than,  
those specified, to which the right of capture  
is applicable, is that of blockades, which  
might have been as easily specified as pro­  
vided for bv such a residuary phrase ; and  
the pretext for appropriating&#x27; this phrase to  
the case of the colonial trade, would he  
strengthened l&gt;y the specific provision, in q  
subsequent article, for the ease ot block­  
ades.  
It cannot be alledged that the specificati­  
on ot the two cases ol enemy’s property and  
contraband of war, is necessary to prevent  
uncertainty and controversy ; the U. States  
having sufficiently manifested their acquies­  
cence in these causes of capture. If there be  
a source of uncertainty and controversy, it  
is in tile expressions “other lawful catlse,”  
and “otherwise confiscable,” &amp; this source  
could not be increased by the change lici t*  
proposed.  
Article 9.— Thisarticle is tin improve­  
ment of that on the same subject, in the  
treaty of 1794 ; inasmuch as it excepts from  
the list of contraband, tar and pitch, when  
not bound to a port of naval equipment; &amp;  
when so bound, substitutes pre-emption for  
forfeiture. It has an advantage also, in the  
clause renouncing the principle of the British  
order ot June 180.5, against vessels returning  
from places, to which they had carried con­  
traband of war.  
On the other hand, it would not have been  
unreasonable to expect that the British go­  
vernment would, in a treaty with the United  
States, have insisted on no stipulation less  
favorable than her stipulation on the same  
subject, with Russia; especially as the na­  
val stores exported from the United States,  
are equally the growth and produce of the  
country.  
  
Consistency, again, as well as reason, evi­  
dently required that the exception in favor  
of tar &amp; pitch should .have been extended to e­  
very species of naval stores, equally appli­  
cable to other uses than those of war, &amp;. des­  
tined to places, other than those of naval e­  
quipment.  
Lastly, it is observable, that even turpen­  
tine and rosin are not included with tar or  
pitch, in the favorable exceptions, though of  
a character so kindred as to leave no pre­  
text for the distinction.  
Neither has the British government the  
slightest ground for regarding as a concessi­  
on, the stipulated immunity of a vessel,  
which, on her.outward voyage, had carried  
contraband to a hostile port. ° The principle  
asserted by her order on that subject, is an  
innovation against the clearest.right of neu­  
trals, as recognized and enforced even bv  
British courts. The very language of the ar­  
ticle implies that this is a /ireten.ee for the  
innovation.  
These considerations urge a re-modifica­  
tion of the. article ; and they are strengthen­  
ed by the great dislike of the President to  
formal recognitions, at this particular mo­  
ment, or principles combated by some, and  
unfavorable to all neutral nations. So ineligi­  
ble indeedin his view is any step tcnding.in the  
least to retard the progress of these princi­  
ples, that naval stores are to he lelt on a  
stipulated list of contraband, in the event on­  
ly, of an inflexible refusal of the British go­  
ment to omit them ; nor are they to bv re­  
tained in any event, without an addition or  
explanation diat will except turpentine and  
rosin, as well as tar and pitch; there being  
no plausible motive for the distinction ; and  
the quantity and value of the two former ex­  
pprtcd from the U. States, being found, on  
enquiry, to make them of equal&#x27;importance  
with the two latter. .It can scarcely be sup­  
posed that the British government will insist  
on this unwarrantable distinction. It is not,  
indeed, improbable, that it has been a mere  
inadvcrtcncc. Such an inference is favored  
by the circumstance of your speaking, in  
your comment on this article, of tar and tur­  
pentine as being the two exceptions. What­  
ever the true state of the case may be, it is  
thought better to omit a list of contraband  
altogether, than not to include in tlie excep­  
tion from it turpentine and rosin, as well as  
tar and pitch. -  
  
Article. 10.—The abuse of blockades  
has been so extravagant, and lias produced  
so much vexation and injury to the fair com­  
merce of the U. States, that as on one hand  
it is of great importance to find a remedy ;  
so, ou the other, it is the more necessary,  
that the remedy should he such as not itself  
to admit ot&#x27;abuse. The considerations which  
reconciled you to the tenor of the article, us  
at least a constructive approach to a solid pro­  
vision for the case, arc allowed the weight  
which tl^y justly merit; whilst the course  
which your discussions took are a proof of  
the exertions which were used to give the ar­  
ticle a more satisfactory form.  
The failure, however, of the British com­  
missioners to substantiate a favorable con­  
struction of the article, by a proper expla­  
natory letter addressed to you, with their  
reasons to insert in tne treaty a definition of  
blockade, Justify apprehensions that the  
vague terms which alone were permitted to  
compose the article, would be more likely to  
be turned against our object, by courts and  
cruizers, and perhaps by a less liberal cabi­  
net, than to receive in practice the more fa­  
vorable construction which candor anticipat­  
ed.  
The British doctrine of blockades exem­  
plified by practice, is different from thac of  
all other nations, as well as from the reason  
and nature of that operation of war. The  
mode of notifying a blockade bv proclamati­  
ons &amp;. diplomatic communications, of what too  
is to be done, rather of what in fact has been  
done, is more particularly the evil which is  
to be corrected. Against these nominal  
blockades, the article does not sufficiently  
close the door. The preamble itself, which  
refers to distance of situation, as a frequent  
cause of not knowing that a blockade exists,  
though in one view giving the United S. rates  
the advantage of a favorable presumption;  
in anothei view, carries an admission unfa­  
vorable to our principle, which rests not on  
the distance of situation, but on the nature  
of tiie case, and which consequently rejects  
in till cases the legal sufficiency of notifica­  
tions in the British mode. The preamble  
is liable to the rtmark also that it separates  
our cause from the common one of neutral  
nations in a less distant situation, and that the  
principle it may even be pleaded against us  
in the case of blockades in the Wcit*IniliCs  
These considerations would have been out­  
weighed by the advantage of establishing a  
satifactory rule on this subject, in favor o,  
our trade; but with such provision in the  
&lt;11 tide, it is thought less advisable to retain it.  
than to trust to the law of blockades as laid  
down by all writers of authority, as support­  
ed by all treaties which define it, and more  
especially as recognized and communicated  
to the United States, by the British govern­  
ment, through its minister here, in  
last, not to mention the influence which  
the course of events, and the sentiments of  
the maritime nations iu friendship with G,  
  
Britain may have, in producing&#x27;a reform •••  
tins subject.  
Ti»e lust paragraph, though subjectir.r  
persons in civil !ls well as military service ol  
an enemy, to capture in cur vessels, .,»• &gt;&lt;  
prove a valuable safeguard t &gt; ordinary pas­  
sengers and mariner.-,, against the \vi,.m*s  
V&#x27;inc.i they now frequently experience, and  
which affect the vessel as well a* themselves.

Article 12.—It is ranch regretted that a  
provision could not he obtained against the  
practice of British cruizers, in hovering a»tl I  
taking stations for the purpose of surprising  
the trade going in and out of our harbours, a!  
practice which the British government felt •  
to be so injurious to tlie dignity and rights of  
that nation, at periods when it was neutral.  
An addition, of two-miles, nevertheless, to  
our mai&#x27;itirpe jurisdiction, so far as to pro­  
tect neutral and other unarmed vessels, not­  
withstanding its want of any tiling like a due  
reciprocity, is not without its valne. This  
t alue will at the same time be very matcri;  
ally impaired, if the stipulation cannot be li­  
berated from the clause requiring the con­  
sent of the other belligerent nation, as ne­  
cessary to exempt their vessels from search  
and seizure. None of the other belligerent  
nations have, in fact, unarmed vessels cr  
gaged in bur trade, nor are they likely ,  
have any during the. war; and these alone  
could derive advantage from their consent;  
their armed vessels being expressly excepted.  
There can be no motive with them, therefore,  
to agree to the regulation. They would ra­  
ther be tempted to embarrass it, with a view  
to continue as much as possible vexations  
which lessen the mutual good will of the par­  
ties. And as by their not agreeing to the regu­  
lation, the right is rcsinwofli© ltritnii cruizers  
to examine all vessels for the purpose of as­  
ce turning whether they may not belong to a  
belligerent, the disturbance of our trade  
might be little diminished within the additi­  
onal two miles. Besides the mere interrup­  
tion of a search concerning the vessel, it is  
hardly to be expected from the general spi­  
rit of cruizcrs, that the search &quot;will not be  
extended to the cargo, and if the latter should  
be thus or otherwise found or suspected te  
be of a confiscable sort,-that the temptation I  
to capture would be resisted, the less soper- j  
haps, as the increased distance from the shore j  
ami the increased difficulty of proof, would j  
favour tlie chance of condemnation, or at least  
countenance courts in their propensity to re- 1  
fuse damages and costs to the claimants.  
T. o secure the advantage promised bv this  
article, tlie right of search ought to be sup­  
pressed altogether, the additional space en­  
joving in this repent the same immunity as  
is allowed to the marine league. To this ob­  
ject the president wishes your endeavors to  
be directed.  
I reserve for the 19th article, another view  
of the subject which can claim your attenti­  
on.  
An tici.f. 13— 1 lie general provision hers  
copied from the treaty of 1794, though not  
hitherto found of much effect, in controlling  
the licentiousness of cruizers, and very dif­  
ferent from the special rules in favour of ned­  
trais contained in most treaties which touch  
tlie subject of search, enters very properly  
into a comprehensive arrangement, between  
two friendly nations. I lie introductory sen­  
tence alone, which consists of new matter,  
invites particlar notice. The expressions  
“c.s the course of the war may possibly per­  
mit,” and &quot;observing, as much as /lossible,  
the acknowledged principles and rules of tlie’ &lt;  
law of nations,” however favorably intended  
by the British negociators, will not impro- i  
bably be construed into a relaxation of the 1  
neutral right in favor of belligerent pleas,  
drawn from circumstances of which bellige- 1  
rent agents will be the judges. Thcexpres- &lt;.  
sions may easily be so varied as to refer sim- :  
ply to the law of nations for the rule, and to i  
the friendship of the parties, for the spirit, i  
according to which the search is to be con- i  
ducted, ff such an amendment should be j  
deliberately rejected by the British govern- ]  
ment, it will bo a proof of a lurking danger,  
that will recommend an omission of what re- i  
latcs to the subject of search in preference ]  
to retaining it.  
Articles 14, 15, and 16, call for no parti i  
eular observation. I  
Article )7—-So much of this article as i  
relates to the admission of ships of war would  
be advantageously exchanged for a general  
stipulation, allowing on this subject, the pri­  
vilege granted to the most favored nation._  
It would then be in the power of tlie United  
States To limit the number admissible* atone  
time, whereas such an indefinite admission  
of British ships imposes on our neutrality a  
like indulgence to the fleets of other nation*.  
Sue!; an alteration of tile articles is the  
more reasonable and important, as th&gt;rc will  
be little reciprocity in its operation ; the U.  
States having but few ships, and the incon­  
veniences from British ships in our ports,  
Jjeing much greater than those from our ships  
tn British port*.  
  
The engagement to treat officers of the  
navy with respect, is not only too indefinite  
to be e nforced hv penal regulations, hut im­  
plies a reproachful defect of hospitality aifd  
ci&gt;ility. In this light it was viewed during  
the discussions of the treaty of 1794, The  
cl &gt;usc probably grew then out of recent com­  
plaints, wc-11 or ill founded, of disrtspcctftfl  
conduct, on some occasion towards British  
officer*. If latter occurrences were to he  
con lilted, it would be a more apt provision  
now to stipulate for the punishment of naval  
commanders making insulting and ungrate­  
ful returns for the kindness and respect  
shown them in our ports, and towns. .The  
president makes almost a point of excluding  
this part of the article.  
Article lb and 19, already noticed.  
Alt rici.E &#x27;.JO,— -Considering the great  
number of British merchants residing with- ’  
in the l nited States, with the great means  
ol influence possessed by them, and the ve­  
ry fow American merchants who reside in  
(»reat Britain, the inconvenience which may  
be incident to such a protracted right to re­  
main dirinij a state of war, is evidently  
  
much greater on our side than on the other.  
In this view the stipulation is very equal.—  
The liberal spirit of it is, at the same time,  
highly commcpdablc. It were only to be  
wished that the readiness on one side to  
make sacrifices of this sort, to a spirit which  
ought to pervade every part of a treaty be­  
tween the parties, lutd been less met by an  
apparent disposition on the other side, ra­  
ther to extort from, than to emulate it.  
Auricle 21.—Not agreeable, but not to  
be an insuperable obstacle.  
Article 22, is altogether proper.  
Article. 23.—This article, granting the  
privileges of the most favored nation, seems  
to require explanation, if not alteration.—  
The terms “shall continue to be on the foot­  
ing of the most favored nation,“ implies that  
the parties are now on the same footing. To  
I look no further, the discrimination between  
! exports from Great Britain to Europe and  
; to the United States, is a proof that the fact  
j is otherwise.  
But may not the expression be construed  
into a barrier against laws on the part ni&#x27;  
the United States, establishing a icciprocity  
with the British navigation act, and West­  
India regulations i It might be&#x27;impolitic to  
extend such laws to all other nations, as it.  
would be unjust to extend them to such a?  
had not adopted the restrictive system of  
Great-Britain. And yet a discrimination  
might be arranged as not continuing Great  
Britain on the same footing with other nati­  
ons.  
  
The object of this article, so far as it is a li­  
gitimate one, would be sufficiently provi­  
ded for by a mutual stipulation of the priv­  
leges-in trade ar.d navigation, enjoyed by the  
most favored nation; and such stipulations  
moreover, ought injustice, to import or imply  
that where privileges are granted to a third  
nation, in consideration of privileges received,  
the privileges cannot be claimed under the  
stipulation, without a return of the same or  
of equivalent privileges. The condition is.  
certainly not without difficulties in the ex­  
ecution, but it avoinsa greater evil. Should  
Spain or France open her colonies to our  
ships and productions, on our granting* cer­  
tain privileges to her trade, these could not  
be claimed or expected by tiie most friendly  
nation who would not pay the price of them.  
Articles 24 and 25, arc entirely proper.  
Article 26—It is particularly desira­  
ble that the durationof the treaty should be  
abridged to the term limited in the instruc­  
tions of the 5th Jan. 1804.  
Having taken this view of the subject with  
[reference to a formal treaty under new mo­  
[ difications, it is necessary to recollect that  
you were authorised bv my letter of Febru­  
ary 3, to enter into informal arrangements,  
and that before the receipt of my letter of  
March 18, a plan of that sort may have been  
definitively settled. In such a state of things  
1 it is impossible to do better than to leave vour  
| own judgments, aided by a knowledge of cir­  
&#x27;tumstances unknown here, and bv the sen­  
timents of the president now communicated,  
to decide how far it may bo eligible, or o­  
therwise, to attempt to supercede that in­  
formal arrangement, by opening tiie nego­  
ciution herein contemplated.  
Should, on another hand, the negociation  
be found in the state authorised by my let­  
ter, of March 18th, that is to say, matured  
provisionally only, and .consequently leaving  
the door open for the experiment now pri&gt;­  
vided for, it must equally remain with your  
own judgments, guided by a comparison of  
the terms oi the provisional arrangement,  
with the presentinstructions, to decide how  
far it may be best to close the former, or to  
pursue the objects of the latter, with a view,  
in caso of failure, to return to, and close the  
former.  
Whatever may be the course recommend­  
ed by the actual state of tilings, you will  
feel the propriety of smoothing the \yay for j  
it, by the explanations whicli will best satis­  
fy the British government, that the several  
steps taken on the part of the United States,  
have proceeded from their solicitude to find  
some ground cn which tiie difficulties and dif­  
ferences existing between the two Countries,  
might be amicably and permanently termi­  
nated. You will be equally aware of the  
importance of transmitting hither, as carlv  
and as circumstantial information of your  
proceedings and prospects, as opportunities  
will permit; and will particularly keep in  
mind, the earnest desire of the president, to  
possess, in due time, every material, pre­  
paratory to the communications relating to  
our affairs with Great-Britain, which Will  
be so anxiously expected, on the meeting  
of congress, the first Monday in December. I  
Such are the instructions and explanations&#x27;  
under which the task is assigned to you, of  
renewing the discussions with the British ’go­  
vernment. The presdent is well assured,  
that it will lie executed with all the advan-i  
tage which talents and patriotism can con- !  
tribute ; and he is unwilling to believe that  
that government will finally prefer to the (  
reasonable t&#x27;-rms proposed, the serious state &#x27;  
of things which will be left, by a misCarri-l  
age of this ulterior appeal to the motives  
which ought to govern a just and friendly &#x27;  
nation. \s it is possible, however, that this !  
favorable calculation may not be verified 8c j  
it will necessarily remain to be decided, ‘  
whether such a stat&#x27;- of tilings can be obvia- &#x27;  
ted by afiy additional proposition, not be- I  
yondthe justifiable, limits of concession ;_j  
the president has taken the case into his se-1  
rious deliberation, and has concluded to an- !  
thorisc you, in the event of a rejection of  
every arrangement already authorised, hut &#x27;  
in that event only, to admit an article lo the !  
following effect:  
  
it is agreed that after the term of  
iponths’computed from the exchange of ratifi­  
cations, Hirrl during a war in which either  
of the parties may be engaged, neither of  
them will permit any seaman, not being its  
own citizen or subject and being a citizen or  
subject of ih* other party, who shall not have  
been for two years at least prior to that date,  
constantly, and voluntarily, in th&quot; service,  
or within the jurisdiction &lt;rf the parties res­  
pectively, to enter, or hfe employed on hoard&#x27;  
any«f its vessels navigating the high seas ;  
and proper regulations, enforced by adequate  
penalties, shall be mo .dally established, for  
distinguishing the sea neh of the parties res­  
pectively, and for gi\ ng full effect to this  
stipulation.”  
You will observe that the proposition is so  
\
  
framed as not to comprehend amoijjj British  
seamen, those who have been made citizens  
oi the United State?; and who must neces­  
, sariiy he so regarded within their jurisdicti­  
on, and under their dag. This modification  
of the article cannot produce any rgal objec­  
tion on die part o&#x27; Great-Britain.—1st. Be­  
cause the legal pre-requisites to naturaliza­  
tjon in the United States, imply what is suf­  
ficiently known, that the number of seamen  
actually naturalized or likely to be so, is too  
small to claim attention in any arraugement  
on this subject:  
2d. Became, the right of British subjects  
to naturalize themselves in a foreign trade  
and navigation; as.mid down by the judicial  
authority .of Great Britain, ought to restrain  
the government from making a difficulty  
om this point. £&lt;SV\? DurnJ&#x27;ijrd and F.anFi

.It an attempt should be made to bind the  
L ii:ted States to deliver lip the seamen to  
Great-Bri tain, instead ot excluding them  
merely front their own sendee, you are to  
say at once, that it would be inconsistent  
with our print iples, ami connot be acceded  
to.  
It will cr.cur to you, that the period cf  
two years has&#x27;been chosen, in arm.ion to  
the period established by Great-Bri ta in, • s  
sufficiently1 incorporating alien, wi h liriibh  
seamen. : Hccown example, at least, must  
have .weight-with her, and the implied- ap­  
peal to it, may be of use in shielding the vaea­  
sure-against public pi ejudices, to which the  
government may not wish to expo c itself.  
•If the British government be net predeter­  
mined against a friendly adjustment, it is  
confidently presumed vhat the concession pro -  
posed,, will not only overcome all obstacles to  
your success on the essential points, bat may­  
be turned to account in promoting the amend­  
ment of tin other articles.  
Should the concession, however, contrary i  
to nil expectation, not succeed, even as to the  
essential objects, the course prescribed by  
prudence will be, to signify your purpose e£  
transmitting the r.siilt to your government ;  
avoiding, carefully any language or appear­  
ance ot hostile anticipations ; and receivin&#x27;’*  
and transmitting, at tlie same time, any over­  
tures which may lie made &lt;,n the other side  
with a.view to bring about accommodation.  
As long r.s negotiation can be honorably pro­  
tracted, if is. a resource to he pre erred under  
existing Circumstances, to the peremptory al­  
ternative of improper concessions, or inevita­  
1 blc collisions.  
The last suggestion I hare to.make to you  
is,that in case of great difficulties in re-adi &#x27;ist­  
jing tli- multiplied provisions embraced by  
the treaty of December, particularly those  
relating tq commerce, it may lie advisable to  
simplify the transaction, by confining it to the  
lew essential objects, or by not .adding move  
than a f. w others of least difficulty, and most  
importance A general article may suffice for  
the rest, giving reciprocally, in* regard to  
trade and navigation, armed ships and prizes  
the privileges of the most favoured nation ;  
and leaving lor more le&#x27;-uvely and detailed  
provision, Whatever further riiav coiulin e to  
the mutual interests, and correspond with the  
friendly dispositions of the parties. A gene­  
ral stipulation of this sort, applied to the .!&gt;­  
ject of .commerce; would have the advantage  
to the United States of abolishing and pre­  
venting British di.criminations on exports,  
and to G i eat Britain, the like advantage, v. itii  
respect to American discriminations on im­  
ports.

MY letter of March IS, ac­  
knowledged the receipt of your dis- j  
patches, and of the treaty signed on  
tire .3 Ist December, of which Mr. Pur­  
viance was the bearer, and signified  
that the sentiments and views of tin-  
President, formed on the actual  
tine o four affairs with G. Britain ■.  
without any useless delay, be commu­  
nicated. The subject is accerdingly  
resumed in this dispatch, with v.  
Mr. Purviance will be charged. To  
render his passage the more sure and i  
convenient, he takes it in the sloop of  
war, Wasp, which will convey him to  
a British port, on her way to the Me­  
diterranean. She. will touch ;iso, at a  
French port, probably L/Orieflt, with  
dispatches for gen. Arms:  
Mr. Bbwdoin, and will afford a gdod  
opportunity for any communications  
you may iiave occasion to make to j  
those gentlemen.  
The President has seen in your  
exertions to accomplish the preal ob­  
jects of your instructions, ample  
proofs of that zeal and patriotism in  
which he confided ; and feels deep  
regret, that your success has not cor- ,  
responded with the reasonableness of,  
your propositions, and the ability with  
which they were-supported. He la-&#x27;  
i ments more especially that the Bri- &#x27;  
tish government lias not yielded to the ■  
just and cogent considerations which j  
forbid the practice of its crui/.ersin j  
visiting and impressing the crews of |  
our vessel.;, covered by an indepen­  
dent flag, and guarded by the laws of  
the high seas, which ought to be sa­  
cred with all nations.  
The President continues to r,  
this subject in the light in which it i  
has been pressed on the justice and j  
friendship of (i. Britain. He cannot  
reconcile it with his duty to our sea­  
faring citizens, or with the sensibility  
or sovereignty of the nation, to r&lt;  
nize even constructively a principle  
that would expose on the bgh seas  
their liberty,their lives, every thing,  
!in a word, that is dearest to the hu­  
man heart, to the Capricious or in­  
terested ■ which may be pro­  
nounced against their allegiance, i&gt;.  
officers of a for&lt; iVernment,  
whom neither the law of nations, nor  
even the laws of that government will  
allow to decide&quot; on the Ownership  
or character of the minutest arti­  
tcle of properly found in a like situ­  
ation.  
11 has apical, and necessary weight  
also with the President, that the vje w°s |  
ofCohgn AAvtcd during the  
ion which passed the non-in  
ration act, as well as the primary  
held by the Object &lt;d securing Anysri­  
against British iraprei smew  
among the objects which -  
the solemnity ,of an extraordinary  
ion, are opposed to any conven­  
tional arrangement, which, withoul  
effectually providing for that object,  
woUld disarm the U. States oi  
means deemed most eligible as an  
dual remedy.  
It is considered, moreover, by  
President, the mere reasonable that  
the necessary concession in this case,  
should be made by G. Britain, rather  
thand by the U. S.pn the double con­  
sideration, first) (!; pssion on  
oui part, would violate both a mora!  
and political duty of the government,  
to our citizens, which ■ Lbe !  
ci the other side ;  
that : iber of Amc,  
citizens, than of British arc, j  
t, impressed from our vessels ; j  
and consequently, more of wrong is I  
done to the U. S. than of light t&lt;  
Britain; taking even her ovn claim  
for the legal criterion.  
On these grounds, the President is j  
constrained to decline any arrange- j  
  
ment, formal or informal, which docs  
not comprize a provision against im­  
pressments from American vessels on  
the high seas, and which would, not­  
withstanding, be a bar to legislative  
measilres, such as Congress have  
thought, or may think proper to a­  
dOpt, for controlling that species of  
cession.  
Persevering at the same time in  
his earnest desire to establish the  
harmony of the two nations on a pro­  
per foundation, and calculating on the  
motives which must be equally felt  
by G. Britain to secure that impor­  
tant object, it is his intention that your  
efforts should be renewed, with a  
view to such alterations of the instru­  
ment signed on the &quot;Ist December,  
as may render it acceptable to the U.  
is.  
That you may the more fully un­  
derstand his impressions and pur­  
poses, I will explain the alterations  
winch are to be regarded as essential ;  
and proceed then to such observations  
on the several articles, as will shew  
the other alterations which arc Lo be  
npted.and the degree of impor­  
tance respectively attached to them.  
Ist. Without a provision against  
impressments, substantially such as  
is contemplated in your original in­  
structions, no treaty is to be con­  
cluded.  
2d. The eleventh article on the  
subject of colonial trade, cannot be  
i admitted, unless freed from the con­  
j ditions which restrict to the market  
jof Europe, the re-exportation of co­  
! lonial produce, and to European ar­  
ticles, the supplies to the colonial  
market­  
3d. The change made by the 3d ar­  
m the provisions of the treaty of  
1794, relative to the trade with the  
I British possession.* in India by limit*  
i ing the privilege to a direct trade  
• from the U. States, as well-as to them,  
is deemed an insuperable objection,  
i. Either an express provision is  
B insisted on for indemnifying  
sufferers from wrongful captures, or  
at least a saving in form or  
other, of their rights against any im­  
plied abandonment.  
! sth. Articles 18 and 19 to be so al­  
-1 tered as to leave the U. S. fva, as a  
I neutral nation, to keep and place other  
belligerent nation.s on an equality with  
Ci. Britain.  
6th. No such alternative as is pre­  
sented by the declaratory note on the  
j subject of the French decre&lt;  
i November 21st, 1806, will be admis­  
i bible.  
first. The considerations which  
render a provision on the subject of  
1 impressments indispensable, have  
j been already sufficiently explained.  
j Second. The essential importance  
iof the amendment required In the  
J I lth article, results from the cxten­  
! sive effect which the article, if amend­  
| ed, would have on the system of our  
I commerce as hitherto carried on, with  
I the sanction or acquiescence of G.  
Britain herself.  
j It was hoped that the British go­  
i vernment in regulating the subject of  
; this article, would at least have yield­  
ed to the example of its treaty  
with Russia. It could not have been  
Supposed that a modification would be  
i insisted on, which shuts to our neutral  
| commerce important channels, left.  
; open by the adjudication of British  
i ourtft, and particularly by the princi­  
! pie officially communicated by that  
! governmeni to this, through Mr. King,  
in the year 1801.  
According to th.it principle and  
those adjudications, the indirect trade  
through our neutral ports, was as free  
my colonies, to every other  
part pf the world as to Etlfl  
and as free to such colonies, in the  
(articles of all other countries, as in  
; European articles.  
j According to the tenor of the arti­  
and the general prohibitory prin­  
ciple assumed by Great Britain, to  
n it. has an implied reference, the  
productions both of the continental and  
of the insula  
d as iiere­  
■to any part of A.-aa or Africa,  
or even oi i, and consequently  
can no longer enter into the trades  
carried on U. S. to tiie Asiatic,  
or African shores of the Mediterra­  
f the places beyond  
the cape of Good Hop.-, offering a  
or them ; nor finally to any  
other enemy or neutral coloni  
this quarter, to Which in reason, as  
well as according to ; they  
ought to I -{portable as to the  
countries in Europe to which such co­  
lonies bel  
In like maimer the importations  
from beyond the cape of Good Hope,  
■more especially the canton fabrics of  
a and India., can no longer be  
sent, as heretofore to the W. in  
or the Spanish Alain, where they not  
only now yield a great profit to our  
merchants, but being mixed in cargoes  
with the produce of this country, faci­  
litate and encourage the trade in the  
latter. Besides t of tho article •  
in abridging so materially our vulva­  
  
ble commerce, the distinction which j  
it introduces between the manufac­  
tures of Europe and those of China  
and India, is chargeable with evils of  
another sort. In many cases it might  
not be easy to pronounce on the real  
origin of the articles. It is not im­  
probable thai suppositious attempts  
also might be occassionally made, by  
the least scrupulous traders. With  
such pretexts as these, arguing  
from the abuse made of less plausi­  
ble ones, the interruptions and vexa­  
tions of our trade, by the greedy  
oruizors which swarm on the ocean,  
could not fail to be augmented in a (  
degree, not a little enforcing the  
objection to the article in its present  
form.  
As the prohibitory principle of  
Great Britain does not extend to the  
case of a colonial trade usually open,  
and no judicial decision has profess­  
edly applied the principle to such a.  
trade, it is a reasonable inference, that  
the article will not be so constru­  
ed as to interfere with the trade of  
that description, between enemy co­  
lonies beyond the cape of Good Hope,  
and other countries and ports in that  
quarter. But on the other hand, it may  
not he amiss to guard against a con­  
struction of the article that would a- j  
bolish the rule observed in the prize J  
courts of Great Britain, which, in |  
the case of the eastern colonies, pre-!  
siimes that these ports were always  
open, and thereby throws on the }  
captors, instead of the claimants, the  
advantage ol proving the fact in ques­  
tion.  
It is observable, that the duration of  
this article is limited to the period of  
thepresent hostilities,whilst the others ;  
are to be in force for ten years; so that j  
if there should be a peace and a re­  
newal of the war, as is very possible,  
within the latter period, the onerous !  
parts of the bargain would survive  
a part, in consideration of which,  
they were assumed. Justice and re­  
ciprocity evidently require that the  
more important articles of the  
treaty should be regarded as condi­  
tions of each other and therefore  
that they should be co-durable. In J  
this point of view, you will bring ■  
the subject under reconsideration ; 8c \
without making this particular a- i  
mendment an ultimatum, pro&lt;« it with  
all the force which it merits. This  
amendment ought to be the ie  
sisled oh the British side, as i would |  
still leave to that side, an tdvan  
resulting from the nalui - I ■ lie two&#x27;  
great objects to be attaii U.  
States, namely the of  
our crews, and of duf i &#x27; com- \
merce, Avhich are connei ■ with a  
state of war only ; win- &#x27;ipu­  
lations valued by Great Britain, will  
operate constantly throughout the  
period of the treaty, as well in  
a state of peace, as in a state of  
war.  
Whatever term may finally be  
settled for the continuance of this  
regulation, it will be proper to retain  
the clause which saves the right involv­  
ed in the article from any constructive  
donment or abridgement. Even  
the temporary modification of the  
right, as it will stand without the in­  
admissible restrictions now in the  
article, is considered as an impor­  
tant sacrifice on the part of the li­  
nked States to their desire of friend­  
ly adjustment with Great Britain.  
To an admission of the article with  
i fictions, the President pre­  
fers the looting promised to the co­  
lonial trade, by the deference of  
Great Britain for the maritime pow­  
ers, and by an unfettered right of  
the LA States, to adapt their regula*  
tionsinthe course which hcrp  
may take.  
That the operation of the arti­  
cles iii its present form, might be  
more fully understood, it was thought  
proper lo avail the public of tin: ideas  
of a citizen of great inteili,,  
•xperience with respect to our  
commerce. His remarks, conta  
in a paper herewith inclosed, afford  
a valuable elucidation of the subject.  
They will Suggest at the same time,  
some explanatory precautions wor­  
thy of attention, particularly to the  
ease of articles, which paying no du­  
ty on importation into ihe United  
States do not fail under the rcgu­  
tions of drawbacks&#x27; and in tin  
of securing by bond, instead of ac­  
tually paying, the duties allowed to  
be drawn back. It appeals by the  
i-v.&#x27;uions in your letter of Janua­  
ry 3d, that the bond was understood,  
as it surely ought to be, equivalent  
io actual payment. But this is a  
point so material, that it cannot lie  
too explicitly guard* .! the  
misinterpretation of interested crui­  
zers, and the ignorance or perverse­  
uess of inferior courts.  
Third. The necessity of the change  
required in the third article, in or­  
der lo secure an indirect, us well as  
a direct trade to the British East  
Indies, will be fully explained by the  
■ observations which have been ob­  
tained from several of our best  
  
informed citizens on that subject;  
and which are herewith inclosed.  
As this latitude of intercourse was  
stipulated by the 13th&#x27; article of the  
treaty of 1794, as judicially expound­  
ed by British superior courts ; as it  
was enjoyed by the United State*  
prior to that epoch, and has been  
always enjoyed, both before and since  
by other friendly nations; and as  
there is reason to believe that the  
British government has been at all  
times, ready since the article ex­  
pired, to renew it in its original form,  
it may justly be expected that the  
inserted innovation will not be in­  
sisted on. Should th v.ion  
fail, the course preferred is lo drop  
the article altogether, hiving tile  
trade on the general footing of the  
most favored nation, or even trusting  
to the interest of Great Britain for  
such regulations as rrtay correspond  
with that of the U. States.  
Should the negociation take up the  
East India article of the treaty of  
L 794, you will find several amend­  
ments suggested in the extracts a­  
bove referred to, some of which  
may be attempted with the greater  
chance of success, as they are  
harmless, if not favorable to the Bri­  
j tish system. Tolheso suggestions may  
|be added, a privilege to American  
j vessels of touching at the cape of  
! Good Hope. The objection to such  
a stipulation, under the present de­  
feasible title of Great Britain to the  
Cape, may be obviated by a descrip­  
tive provision, not necessarily appli­  
cable toit, in the event of its resti­  
tution by a treaty of peace, butem­  
- b-acing it, in case the British title  
j should be established by that event;  
|It maybe agreed &quot;that vessels of  
j the United Suites may touch For re­  
&#x27; fresh ment at all the ports and pi  
in the possession of Great Britain  
on, or in the African or Asiatic  
.s.&quot;  
Fourth. Without a provision, or a  
reservation, as to the claims of in­  
demnity, an abandonment of them  
may be inferred from a treaty as be­  
ing a final settlement of existing con­  
troversies. It cannot be presumed*  
that a precaution against such an mi­  
i ference, in any mode that may be  
I most effectual, can be opposed or  
i complained of. On the contrary, it  
excites just surprise, that so much  
j resistance should he made to indem-  
I nifications supported by the clearest  
! rules of right, and by a precedent in a  
I former treaty between the two coun­  
| tries, from which so many other ar­  
| tides have been copied. The only  
colorable plea for refusing the de­  
| sired provision, flows from a pre-  
Sumption, not only that the British  
1 courts are disposed, but that they are  
&#x27; competent, to the purpose of complete  
j redress. Mot to repeat observatoina  
A ire made on thi A an  
■ Ale one is suggested by the  
clause in the :dc  
ol the treaty, annulling the prim  
or rather the pretence, that vessels.  
Without contraband of war on h  
returning from a port to which  
had carried articles of that sort, were  
subject to capture and condemna­  
tion Previous, even to  
tion, it had beer, settied as tin- i •  
nations, by tbe JJritish high c &gt;urt of  
admiralty, that vessels so cir  
stanccd, were exempt from interrup­  
tion. Yet a British order of An  
I, expressly declares tl  
lawful prizes; and it is well known,  
that a number of American vessels,  
have been seized and condemned  
under that order. LV is a.

possible to justify a stipulation, in the  
midst ol war,, substituting for an ex­  
[uality, an advantage to one  
ligerent parties over its ad­  
. and that tco, without any  
compensation to the neutral, shield­  
ing its motive from the appearance Of  
mere partiality. Hitherto ihe U.S.  
have avoided as un Ssible .such  
embarrassments i and with this view  
have gialuitoiiAy extended to all belli­  
gerents the privileges stipulated to  
any ol then. Great Britain has had  
the be -&#x27;nefi1. of this scrupulous policy.  
She can therefore with the less reason  
expect it to be relinquished for her  
benefit.  
The last paragraph of the 19th ar­  
ticle, establishes a just principle  
the responsibility of a neutral nation,  
whose territory has been violated by  
captures within its limits ; but by  
tending the principle to  
added to our jurisdiction by the 12th j  
article, qualified as that addition is,  
it is made peculiarly important I  
th;,- an amendment should take j  
place.  
Passing by the failure of a recipro- I  
city, cither in the terms or the probable |  
operation oi the responsibility, t.!  
States seem to be bound to claim  
from the enemies of G. Britain re­  
dress for a hostile act, which such  
enemies may not have renounced  
their right to commit within the giv­  
en space ; making thus the U. States  
liable to the one party, without a cor­  
respondent liability to them in the  
&quot;ther party ; andat the same entitling  
G. Britain to redress for acts commit­  
ted by her enemies, which she has  
reserved to herself v right to commit  
against thetra.  
Should all the other belligerent na­  
tions, contrary to probability, concur  
in the addition of two miles to our ju­  
risdiction, this construction would still  
be applicable to their armed ships;  
those unarmed alone being within the  
additional immunity against British  
cruizers ; and the armed as well as the  
unarmed ships cd&#x27;G. Britain, being ex­  
pressly within the additional respon­  
sibility of the U. S.  
Sixth. No treaty can be sanction­  
ed by the U. States, under the alterna­  
tive presented by the declaratory note  
on the subject of the French decree  
of November 21. It is hoped that the  
Occasion which produced it will have  
vanished, and thit it will not be re-j  
newed in connection with a future |  
signature on the part of G. Britain.  
The utmost allowable in such a case j  
would be a candid declaration that in  
ling or ratifying the treaty, it was  
1 en the part of G. Britain,  
that nothingthei*ein contained would  
be a bar to any measures, which if no  
such treaty existed, would be lawful j  
as a i i against the measures  
of an enemy. And with such a j  
declaration, it would be proper* on the  
part, of the U. Stales, to combine m I  
equivalent protest against its being un- j  
derstood, that either the ttealy or the  
British declaration would derogate  
from any rights or immunities, a­  
gainst the effect of such retaliating  
measures, which would lawfully ap­  
pertain to them, as a neutral nation, in  
case no such treaty or declaration ex­  
isted.  
Having given this view of the al­  
terations which are to be held essen­  
tial, 1 proceed to notice such others  
as though not included in the ultima­  
tum, arc to be regarded as more or  
less deserving your best exertions.  
This will be most conveniently done  
by a review of the several article:; in  
their numerical order.  
The 2, 4 and 5, all relate the trade  
and navigation between the two coun­  
tries. The two first make no change  
in the stipulations of the treaty of  
1791. Tbe last has changed, and  
much for the belter, the provisions of  
that treaty on the subject of tonnage  
and navigation.  
Two important questions how­  
ever, enter into an estimate of these  
arlii  
The first is, whether they arc to be  
und. a bar to any regulations,  
SUCh which would  
merely establish areciprocity with Bri­  
tish regulations. From the construc­  
tion whit b seems to have been always  
put on the sa mesi i j.-u ia i ion sin tiie trea­  
ty of l/:)&#x27;. it is concluded that no such  
bar could be eveated, kconsequently  
tin articles arc in that respect un­  
exceptionable. It may be well, ne­  
vertheless, to ascertain that the sub­  
ject is viewed in this light by the Bri­  
tish government.  
The second question is, whether  
the parties be, or be not, mutually re­  
strained from laying duties, as well as  
prohibitions, unfavorably discriminat­  
ing between articles exported to them,  
k like articles exported to sthcr na­  
tions.  
According to the construction put  
by the U. States on the same clauses  
in the treaty of 17(J4, the mutual re­  
straint was applicable to discrimina­  
tions of both kinds. The&#x27; British dis­  
criminating duties on exports, intro­  
duced under the name of convoy dv­  
  
tics, and since continued and aug­  
mented under other names, were ac­  
cordingly combated, during the cxis&#x27;  
enee of the treaty, as infractions &lt; I  
text. The British government, how­  
ever, never yielded to our construc­  
tion, either in in or in  
tice. And it.appears from what pass-1  
ed in your ncgoc.iations on this sub­  
ject, that the Construction which is to  
prevail, admits discriminating duties  
on exports.  
In this point of view, the stipula­  
tion merits very serious attention. It  
cannot be regarded as either recipro­  
cal or fair in principle, or its  
friendly in practice.  
[v the case of prohibitions, wh  
. are on an )  
footing, because it is Understood that&#x27;  
both have l he authority to impose  
them- neither is left at libetty to .  
else the authei ity.  
In the case of duties, v, |  
British governmeol possesses .the au­  
thority to impose tber.i, but where it  
is well known that the authority is  
withheld from the government Of the  
U. States by tbeii lion, the  
articles at nd of course the  
British government is left free to im-j  
pose discriminating duties on their  
exports, whilst no sttc.h&#x27;.duties cm be  
bat of the U.S. How  
will it he in pi aclice :&#x27; Stating the  
.is ei&#x27;G. Britain to the IA S. al  
six millions sterling only, the present  
duty of 4 percent, levies a tax oil ihe  
U.S. amounting to 2.40 thousand  
pOund&#x27;S, oi&#x27; one million, sixly-Ae  
thousand, six hundred dollars; and  
there is nothing*, whilst the war in  
Europe cheeks competition there, and  
whilst obvious causes must for a long  
time enfeeble it here, that can secure  
us against further augmentations of  
the tribute.  
Even under a regulation placing the  
XT. S. on tiie footing of the most favor­  
ed nation, it appears that the British  
government would draw into its trea­  
sury from our consumption three  
Ihs of the revenue now paid by the  
U. States. Such a footing, however,  
would be material, as giving the U.  
S. the benefit of the check accruing  
from the more manufacturing state of  
Europeanhations. But to be de­  
prived of that check by the want of an  
■ article, putting us on the footing of  
| the nations most favored by G. Britain,  
j and at the same time deprived of our-**  
I own checks by clauses, putting Great  
i Britain on the commercial fooling of  
I the nations most favored by the U. S.  
would in effect confirm a foreign au­  
thority lo tax the people of the U. S.  
without the chance of reciprocity or  
redress.  
The British duty on exports to the  
: IA S. has another effect, not entirely  
|to be disregarded. It proportionally  
, augments the price of British manu-  
I factures, re-exported from the U. S. to  
j other markets k so far promotes a di­  
; rec.t supply fromG. Britain, by her own  
merchants and ships. Should this not  
I be the effect of her regulations as now j  
framed, there is nothing that would  
forbid a change of them, having that  
for its object.  
On these considerations it is enjoin­  
ed upon you by the President, to press  
in the strongest/terms, such, an expla- j  
nation or amendment of this pare of  
the treaty, as will, if possible, restrain  
G-. Britain altogether from taxing ex-;  
ports to the U. States, or at least place  
them on the footing of the most­  
favored nation, or if neither he  
attainable, such a change in the &#x27;  
instrument in other respects, as wiii j  
reserve to the U. S. the right to dis- j  
criminate between G. Britain, and  
other nations in their prohibition of ex- i  
ports, the only discrimination in the  
case of exports, permitted by the con- i  
stitution. Tbe unwillingness of the J  
idenl to risk an entire failure of  
the projected accommodation WithG. i  
Britain, restrains him from making  
an amendment of this part of the trea­  
ty, a sine qua non ; but he considers  
it so reasonable, and so much called  
for by the opinions and feelings of this  
country, Unit he is equally anxious and  
confident with respect lb a compliance j  
on the part of the British government. !

! ber 21.. It is hoped that the orcasiqn which produ­  
ced it will have vanished, and that it will not be  
renewed in connection with a future signature on  
the part of Great Britain. The utmost allowable  
in such a case would be a candid declaration that  
in signing or ratifying the treaty, it was understood  
on the part of Great Britain, that notbiug therein  
contained would be a bar to any measures which, if  
no such treaty existed, would be lawful as a retaliati­  
on against the measures of an enemy. And with  
such a decimation, it waold be proper, on the part  
i of the United States, to combine an equivalent pro­  
test against its being understood that either tbe trea­  
ty or the British declaration would derogate from a­  
ny rights or immunities, against the ellect of such  
retaliating measures, which would lawfully apper­  
tain to them, as a neutral nation, in case no such  
treaty or declaration existed.

Department of state, May 20, 1807.  
GrENTLEMEN,—My letter of March 18, acknow-  
ledged the receipt of your despatches, and of the  
treaty signed on the 3lst December, of which Mr.  
Purviance was the bearer, and signified that the  
sentiments and views of the president, formed on  
the actual posture of our affairs with Great Britain,  
would, withont any useless delay, be communicated.  
The subject is accordingly resumed in tls dispatch,  
with which Mr. Purviance will be charged. To ren-  
der this passage the more sure and convenient, he  
takes it in the sloop of war, Wasp, which will con-  
vey him to a British port, on her way to the Medi-  
terranean. She will touch also, at a French port,  
probably L/’Orient, with dispatches for general  
Armstrong and Mr. Bowdoin, and will afford a good  
opportunity for any communtcations you may have  
occasion to make to those gentlemen.  
  
The president has seen in your exertiéns, to ac-  
complish the great objects of your instructions, am-  
ple proofs of that zeal and patriotism in which he  
confided; and feels feep regret, that your success  
has not corresponded with the reasonableness of  
your propositions, and the ability with which they  
were supported. He laments more especially that  
the British government has not yielded to the just  
and cogent considerations which forbid the practice  
of its cruizers in visiting and impressing the crews  
of our vessels, covered by an independent flag, and  
Suarded by the laws of the high seas, which ought  
to be sacred with all nations.  
  
The president cemtinues to regard this subject in  
the light in which it has been pressed on the justice  
and friekdship of Great Britain. He cannot reconcile  
it with his duty to our sca-faring citizens, or with  
the sensibility or sovereignty of the nation, to re-  
copnize even constructively, a principle that would  
expose on the high seas, their liberty, their lives,

claim for the legal criterion.  
  
On these grounds, the president is constrained to  
decline any arrangement, formal or informal, which  
does not comprise a provision against impressments  
from American vessels on the high seas, and which  
would, notwithstanding, bea bar to legislattve mea-  
sures, such as congress have thought, or may think  
proper to adopt, for controling that species of ag-  
gression.  
  
Persevering at the same time in his earnest desire  
to establish the harmony of the two natiens on a  
proper foundation, and calculating on the motives  
which must be equaily felt by Great Britain to  
isecure that important object, it is his intention  
that your efforts should be renewed, with a view  
to such alterations of the instrument signed on the  
31st December, as may render it acceptable to the  
United States. !  
  
That you may’ the more fully understand his im-  
pressions and purposes, I will explain the alterations  
which are to be regarded as essential; and proceed  
then to such observations on the several articles, as  
will shew the other alterations which are to be at-  
ternpted, and the degree of importance respectively  
attached to them.  
  
Ist. Without a provision against impressments,  
substantially such as is contemplated in your origi-  
nal instructions, no treaty is to be concluded.  
  
2d. The eleventh article on the subject of coloniak  
trade, cannot be admitted, unless freed from the  
conditions which restrict to the market of Europe,  
the re-exportation of colonial produce, and to Euro-  
pean articles, the supplies to the colonial market.  
3d. The change made by the’3d article in the pre-  
visions of the treaty of 1764, relative to the trade  
with the British possessions in India, by limiting  
the privilere to a direct trade from the United States,  
  
as well as to them, is deemed an insuperable objes-  
  
tion. ?  
  
4th. Either an express provision is to be insisted  
on for indemnifying sufferers from wrongful cap-  
tures, or at least a saving in some form or other, of  
their rights against any implied abandonment.

heart, to the capricions or interested sentences

and place other belligerent natiors on an equality  
with Great Britain. _ |  
  
6th. No such alternative as is presented by the  
declaratory note on the subject of the French decree  
of November 21st, 1806, will be admissible. ~  
  
First. The considerations which render a provi-  
sion on the subject of impressments indispensable,  
have been already sufficiently explained.  
  
Second. The essential importance of the amend-  
ment required in the 11th article, results from the  
extensive effect which the article, if amended,  
would have on the system of our cormmerce as hi-  
therto carried on, with the sanction or acquiescence  
of Great Britain herself. ;  
  
It was hoped that the British government in regu-  
lating the subject of this article, would at least  
have yielded to the example of its treaty with  
Russia. It could not have been supposed that a  
modification would be insisted on, which shuts to  
our neutral commerce important channels; left open  
by the adjudication of British courts, and particu-  
larly by the principle officially communicated by  
that government to this, through Mr. King, in the  
year 1801.  
  
According to that principle and those adjanies-  
tions, the indirect trade through our neutral ports  
was as free from enemv colonies, to every.other part  
of the world as to Europe; and as free to such colo-  
nies, in the articles of all other countries, as in Eu-  
ropean articles. |  
  
According to the tenor of the article, and the ge-  
neral prohibitory principle assumed by Great Bri-  
tain, to which it has an implied reference, the pro-  
ductions both of the continental and of the insular  
colonies in America, can no longer be re-exported as  
heretofore to any part of Asia or Africa, or even of  
Amerita, and consequently can no longer enter into  
the trades carried on from the United States, to the  
Asiatic or Afriéan shores of the Mediterranean, hor  
to any of the places beyond the cape of Good Hope,  
offering a market for them; nor finally to any other  
enemy or neutral colonies in this quarter, to which  
in reason, as well as according to practice, they  
ought to be as re-exportable as to the countrics in  
Europe to which such colonies belong.  
  
In like manner the importations from beyond the  
cape of Good Hope, more especially the cotton fa-  
brics of China and India, can no longer be sent as  
heretofore to the West-Indies, or the Spanish Main,  
where they not only now yield a great profit to our  
merchants, but being mixed in cargoes with the pro-  
duce of this country, facilitate and encourage the  
trade in the latter. Besides the effect of the article  
in abridging so materially our valuable commerce,  
the distinction which it introduces between the  
manufactures: of Europe and those of China and  
India, is chargeable with evils of another sort. In  
many cases it might not be easy to pronounce on the  
real origin of the articles. It is not improbable that  
suppositious attempts also might be occasionally  
made, by the least scrupulous traders. With such  
pretexts as these, arguing from the abuse made of  
less plausible ones, the interruptions and vexations  
of our trade, by the greedy cruizers which swarm on  
the ocean, could not fail to be augmented in a degree,  
not a little enforcing the objection to the article in  
its present form.  
  
As the prohibitory principle of Great Britain does  
not extend to the case of a colonial trade usually  
open, and no judicial decision has professedly ap-  
plied the principle to such a trade, it is a reasonable  
inferense, that the article will not be so construed  
as to interfere with the trade of that description,  
between enemy colonies beyond the cape of Good  
  
  
  
‘Hope, and ather coun‘ries and ports in that quarter,  
But on the other hand, it may not be amiss to guard  
against a construction of tke article that would  
abolish the rule observed in the prize-courts of Great  
Britain, which, in the case of the eastern Colonies,  
presumes that these ports were always open, and  
thereby. throws on the captors, instead of the claim-  
ants, the disadvantage of proving the fact in ques-  
tion.  
  
_ It is observable, that the duration of this article is  
limited to the period of the present hostilities, whilst  
,the others ate to be in force for ten years; so that if  
there should be a peace and a renewal of the war, as  
is very possible, Within thé latter period, the onerous  
parts of the bargain would survive a part, in consi-  
deration of which, they were assumed. Justice and  
reciprocity evidently require that the more impor-  
tant articlés of the treaty should be fegarded as  
conditions of each other, ,and therefore that they  
should be so co-durable. In this point of view, you  
will bring the subject under reconsideration; and  
without making this particular amendment an ulti-  
matum, press it with all the force which it merits.  
This amendment ought to be the less resisted on the  
British side; as it would still leave to that side, an  
jadvantage resulting from the nature of the two great  
objects to be attained by the United States, namely,  
ithe immunity of our crews, and of our neutral com-  
merce, which are connected with a state of war only}  
whereas the stipulations valued by Great Britain;  
will operate constantly throughout the period of the  
treaty; as well ina state of peace, as in a state of war,  
  
Whatever term may finally be settled for the con-  
  
tinuance of this regulation, it will be proper to retain  
ithe clause which saves the right involved in the ar-  
ticle from any constructive cideainaas or abridgs’  
ment. Even the tempotary modification of the right,  
as it will stand without the inadmissible restrictions  
inow in the article, is considered as an important sa-  
\crifice on the part of the United States to their desire  
lof friendly adjustment with Great Britain. To an  
admission of the article with these restrictions, the  
president prefers the footing promised to the colo-  
nial trade, by the deference of Great Britain for the  
‘maritime powers, and by an unfettered right of thé  
United States, to adapt their regulations to the  
course which their policy may take.  
  
That the operation of the article in its present  
form might be more fully understood, it was thought  
iproper to avail the public of the ideas of a citizen  
of great intelligence and experience with respect to  
jour commerce. His remarks, contained in a paper  
|herewith enclosed, afford a valuable elucidation of  
the subject. They will suggest at the same time,  
some explanatory precautions worthy of attention,  
particularly in the case of articles, which paying no  
duty on importation into the United States, do not  
fall under the regulation of drawbacks; and in the  
case of securing by bond, instead of actually paying,  
the duties allowed to be drawn back. It appears by  
the observations in your letter of January Sd, that  
the bond was understood, as it surely ought to be,  
equivalent to actual payment. But this is a point so  
material, that it cannot be too explicitly guarded  
against the misinterpretation of interested cruizers,  
and the ignorance or perverseness of inferior courts.  
  
Third. The necessity of the change required in  
the third article, in order to secure an indirect, aS  
well as a direct trade to the British East Indies, will  
be fully explained by the observations which have  
been obtained from several of our best informed ci-  
tizens on that subject, and which are herewith en-  
closed.

_ As this latitude of intercourse was stipulated by

ever could possibly be redressed, in the ordinary  
course; it being an avowed rule, with the prize

session of Great Britain on, or in the African or  
Asiatic seas.”  
  
Fourth. Without a provision, or a reservation; as  
to the claims of indemnity, an abandonment of them  
may be inferred from a treaty, as heing a final settle-  
ment of existing controversies. It camiot be pre-  
sumed, that a precaution against such an inference,  
In any mode that may be most effectual, can be op-  
posed or complained of. On the contrary, it excites  
Just surprise, that so much resistance should be made  
to indemnifications supported by the clearest rules of  
right, and by a precedent in a former treaty between  
the two cou ntries, from which so many other articles  
have been copied. The only colorabie plea for re-  
‘using the desired provision, flows from a presump-  
‘ion, not only that the British courts are disposed);  
  
ut that they are competent, to the purpose of com-  
plete redress. Not to repeat observations heretofore  
made on this subject, an unanswerable one is sug-  
§¢ested by the clause in the article of the

ifrom the appearance of mere partiality. Hitherto the  
‘United States have avoided as much as possible such  
|embarragsments: and with this view have gratui-  
tously extended to all belligerents the privileges  
&#x27;stipulated to any of them. Great Britain has had the  
  
‘benefit of this scrupulous policy. She can therefore  
  
|with the less reason expect it to be relinquished for  
  
‘her benefit.  
  
The last paragraph of the 19th article, establishes  
a just principle as to the responsibility of a neutrat  
nation, whose territory has been violated by captures  
within its limits; but by extending the principle to  
the two miles added to our jurisdiction bv the 12th  
article, qualified as that addition 1s, it is made pe-  
culiarly important that an amendment should take  
place.  
  
Passing by the failure of a reciprocity, either in  
  
  
  
the terms or the probable operation of the responsi-  
  
  
  
bility, the United States seem to be bound to claim  
  
from the enemies of Great Britain, redress for a hos.  
tile act, which such enemies may not have renounced  
their right to commit within the given space; making  
thus the United States liable to the one party, with-  
out a correspondent liability to them in the other  
party; and at the same time entitling Great Britain  
to redress for acts committed by her enemies, which  
she has resetved to herself a right to commit against  
them.  
  
Should all the other belligerent nations, contrary  
  
to probability, concur in the addition of two miles to  
our jurisdiction, this construction would still be  
applicable to their armed ships; thdse unarmed alone

tional responsibility of the United States.!  
  
Sixth. No treaty can be sanctioned by the United  
States, under the alternative presented by the decla-  
ratory note on the subject of the French decree of  
November 21. It is hoped that the occasion which  
produced it will have vanished, and that it will not  
be renewed in connection with a future signature on  
the part of Great Britain. The utmost allowable in  
such a case would be a candid declaration that in  
signing or ratifying the treaty, it was understood on  
the part of Great Britain, that nothing therein con-  
tained would bea bar to any measures, which, if no  
such treaty existed, would be lawful as a retaliation  
against the measures of an enemy. And with such a  
declaration, it would be proper, on the part of the  
United States, to combine an equivalent protest  
against its being understood, that either the treaty  
or the British declaration would derogate from any  
rights or immunities, against the effect of such reta-  
liating measures, which would lawfully appertain to  
them, as a neutral nation, in case no such treaty or  
declaration existed.

In the case of duties, where the British govern.  
ment possesses the authority to impose them, but  
where it is well known that the authority is withheld  
from the government of the United States by their  
coustitution, the articles are silent, and of course  
the British government is left free te impose dis.  
criminating duties on their exports, whilst no such  
duties can be imposed by that of the United States.  
How will it be in practice? Stating the exports of  
Great Britain to the United States at six millions  
sterling only, the present duties of 4 per cent. levies  
a tax on the United States amounting to two hundred  
and forty thousand pounds, or one million, sixty-five  
thousand, six hundred dollars; and there is nothing,  
whilst the war in Europe checks competition there,  
and whilst obvious causes must for a long time  
enfeeble it here, that can secure us against further  
augmentations of the tribute.  
  
Even under a regulation placing the United States  
on the footing of the most favored nation, it appears  
that the British government would draw into its  
treasury from our consumption three-eighths of the

best exertions. This Will be most conveniently done  
  
article, putting us on the footing of the nations most  
favored by Great Britain, and at the same time de-  
  
by a review of the several articles in their numerical) prived of our own checks by clauses, putting Great  
  
order.  
  
The 2, 4 and 5, all relate to the trade and naviga-|  
tion between the two countries. The two first make |  
no change in the stipulations of the treaty of 1794. |  
The jast has changed, and much for the better, the!  
provisions of that treaty on the subject of tonnage  
and navigation.  
  
Two important questions, however, enter into an |  
estimate of these articles. |  
  
The first is, whether they are to be understood as a  
bar to any regulations, such as navigation acts, |  
which would merely establish a reciprocity with)  
British regulations. From the construction which  
seems to have been always put on the same stipula-  
tions in the treaty of 1794, it is concluded that no  
such bar could be created, and consequently that the)  
articles are in that respect unexceptionable. It may  
be well, nevertheless, to ascertain that the subject is  
viewed in this light by the British government.  
  
The second question is, whether the parties be,  
or be not, mutually restrained from laying duties, as  
well as prohibitions, unfavorably discrimimating be-  
tween articles exported to them, and like articles  
exported to other nations.  
  
According to the construction put by the United  
States on the same clauses in the treaty of 1794, the  
mutual restraint was applicable to discriminations of  
both kinds. The British discriminating duties on  
exports, ivtroduced under the name of convoy  
duties, and since continued and augmented under  
other names, were accordingly combatted, during  
the existence of the treaty, as infractions of its text.  
The British government, however, never yielded to  
our construction, either in discussion or in practice.  
And it appears from what passed in your negociations  
on this subject, that the construction which is to  
prevail, admits discriminating duties on exports.  
  
In this point of view, the stipulation merits very  
serious attention. Ht cannot be regarded as either  
reciprocal or fair in principle, or as just and friendly  
in practice.  
  
In the case of prohibitions, where both govern-  
melts are on an equal footing, because it is under-  
stood that both have the authority to impose them,

|britam on the commercial footing of the nations  
  
most favored by the United States, would in effect.  
confirm a foreign authority to tax the people of the  
United States, without the chance of reciprocity or  
redress.  
  
The British duty on exports to the United States  
has another effect, not entirely to be disregarded. It  
proportionally augments the price of British manu-  
factures, re-exported from the United States to other  
markets, and so far promotes a direct supply from  
Gréat Britain, by her own merchants and ships.—  
Should this not be the effect of her regulations as  
now framed, there is nothing that would forbid a  
change of them, having that for its object.  
  
On these considerations it is enjoined upon you  
by the president, to press in the strongest terms,  
such an explanation or amendment of this part of the  
treaty, as will, if possible, restrain Great Britain  
altogether from taxing exports to the United States,  
or at least place them on the footing of the most  
favored nation, or if neither be attainable, such a  
change in the instrument in other respects, as will  
reserve to the United States the right to discrim:-  
nate between Great Britain, and other nations in  
their prohibition of exports, the only discrimination  
in the case of exports, permitted by the constitution.  
The unwillingness of the president to risk an entire  
failure of the projected accommodation with Great  
Britain, restrains him from making af’ amendment  
of this part of the treaty, a sine qua non; but he  
considers it so reasonable, and so much called for  
by the opinions and feelings of this country, that he  
is equally anxious and confident with respect to 4  
compliance on the part of the British government.  
  
Article 6.—This article, as taking the case of the  
West India trade out of any general stipulation ol  
privileges granted to other nations; may prove com  
veniert, by disincumbering measures, which may be  
taken against the British monopoly, from questions  
of which that stipulation might otherwise be sus  
ceptible.  
  
Article 7—Though to remain if desired, would be  
more reasonable, without the last paragraph, or with  
a right only to except plaees ang periods, at which  
  
  
  
neither is left at liberty to exercise the authority.

NILES’ WEEKLY REGISTER—MONROE’S TREATY. 925,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Article 8.—This article is framed with more ac-  
Cuacy than the 17th, on the same subject, in the  
treaty of 1794, and is improved by the additional  
paragraph at the close of it. But as such general  
stipulations have not been found of much avail in  
practice, and as it continues to be the wish of the  
president to avoid, especially at the present juncture,  
unnecessary confirmations of the principle, that a  
neutral flag does not protect enemies property, an  
omission of the article is much preferred, unless it)  
be so varied as to be free from this objection. This  
may easily be done, by substituting a general stipu-  
lation, “that in all cases where vessels shall be cap-  
tured or detained for any lawful Cause, they shall be  
brought to the nearest or most convenient port; and  
such part only of the articles on board as are confis-  
cable by the law of nations, shall be made prize; and  
the vessel, unless by that law subject also to confis-  
cation, shall be at liberty to proceed, &amp;c.”  
  
There ought to be the less hesitation, on the Bri-  
tish side, in making this change, as the article in its  
present form, departs from that of 1794; and there is

ciple asserted by her order on that subject, is.an in-  
novation against the clearest right of neutrals, as re-  
cognized and enforced even by British courts. The  
very language of the article implies that this is a  
pretence for the innovation.  
  
These considerations urge a re-modification of the  
article; and they are strengthened by the great dis-  
like of the president to formal recognitions, at this  
particular moment, of principles combated by some,  
and unfavorable to all neutral nations. So ineligible,  
indeed, in his view, is any step tending in the least to  
retard the progress of these principles, that naval  
stores are to be left on a stipulated list of contraband,  
in the event only, of an inflexible refusal of the Bri-  
tish government to omit them; nor are they to be  
retained in any event, without an addition or expla- |  
nation that will except turpentine and rosin, as well jij]  
as tar and pitch; there being no plausible motive for |  
the distinction; and the quantity and value of the’ 3  
two former exported from the United States, being |  
found, on inquiry, to make them of equal importance —  
with the two latter. It can scarcely be supposed that

the more reason, on our side, for requiring the change,  
as the addition of “for other lawful cause,” afier  
specifying the two cases, of enemy’s property and  
contraband of war, is probably valued by Great Bri-  
tain as supporting her doctrine, and impairing ours,  
with respect to colonial trade. The only case other  
than those specified, to which the right of capture is  
applicable, is that of blockades, which might have  
been as easily specified, as provided for by such a  
resxluary phrase; and the pretext for appropriating  
this phrase to the case of the colonial trade, would  
be strengthened by the specific provision, in a sub-  
sequent article, for the case of blockades.  
  
It cannot be alleged that the specification of the  
two cases of enemy’s property and contraband of  
war, is necessary to prevent uncertainty and contro-  
versy; the United States having sufficiently mani-  
fested their acquiescence in these causes of capture.  
If there be a source of uncertainty and controversy, it  
is in the expressions “other lawful cause,” and  
“otherwise confiscable,” and this source could not be  
increased by the change here proposed.  
  
Article 9.—This article is an improvement of that  
on the same subject, in the treaty of 1794; inasmuch  
as it excepts from the list of contraband, tar and  
pitch, when not bound to a port of naval equipment;  
and when g0 bound, substitutes pre-emption for  
forfeiture. It has an advantage also, in the clause  
renouncing the principle of the British order of June,  
1803, against vessels returning frem places, to which  
they had carried contraband of war.  
  
On the other hand, it would not have been unrea-  
sonable to expect that the British government would,  
in a treaty with the United States, have insisted on  
no stipulation less favorable than her stipulation on  
the same subject, with Russia; especially as the na-  
val stores exported from the United States are  
eqtially the growth and produce of the country.  
  
Consistency, again, as well as reason, evidently re-  
quired that the exception in favor of tar and pitch  
should have been extended to every species of naval

from the treaty of 1794, though not hitherto found of  
much effect, in controling the licentiousness of crui-  
zers, and very different from the special rules in  
‘favor of neutrals contained in most treaties which  
touch the subjeet of search, enters very properly  
into a comprehensive arrangement between two  
friendly nations. The introductory sentence alone,  
which ¢onsists of new maiter, invites particular  
notice. The expressions “fas the course of the war  
may possibly permit,” and “observing, as much as  
possible, the acknowledged principles and rules of  
the law of nations,” however favorably intended by  
the British negociators, will not improbibly be con-  
strued into a relaxation of the neutral right in favor.

which belligerent agents will be the judges. The ex-  
pressions may easily be so varied as to refer simply  
to the law of nations for the rile, and to the friend.  
ship of the parties, for the spirit, according to which  
the search is to be conducted. If such an amendment  
should be deliberately rejected by the British go-  
ivernment, it will be a proof of a lurking danger, that  
iwill recommend an omission of what relates to the  
subject of search, in preference to retaining it.  
  
Articles 14, 15 aid 16, éaif for no particular obser-  
vation.  
  
Article 17.~—So much of this article as relates to  
the admission of ships of war, would be advanta-  
igeotisly exchanged for a general stipulation, allow-  
ing on this subject, the privilége granted to the most  
{favored nation. It would then be in the power of the  
| United States to limit the number admissible at one  
time, whereas such an indefinite admission of British  
ships imposes on our neutrality a like indulgence to  
the fleets of other nations. Such an alteration of the  
‘article is the more reasonable and important, as  
there will be little reciprocity in its operation; the  
United States havints but few ships, and the incon-  
ivenienees from British ships in 6ur ports, being  
much greater than those from our ships, in British  
ports.  
  
The engagement to treat officers’ of the navy with  
respect, 1s net only too indefinite to be enforced b  
penal regulations, but implies a reproachful defect of  
hospitality and civility. In this light it was viewed  
during the discussions of the treaty of 1794. The  
clause probably grew then out of recent complaints,  
well or ifi founded, of disrespectful conduct on some  
occasion towards British officers. If latter occurren-  
ces were to be consulted, it would be a more apt  
provision now to stipulate for the ptmishment of  
naval coramanders making insulting and ungrateful  
| returns for the kindness and respect shewn them in  
‘our ports and towns. ‘Fhe president makes almost a  
[point of excluding this part of the article.  
  
Articles t§ and 19, already noticed.  
  
Article 20.—Considering the great number of Bri-  
tish merchants residing in the United States, with  
the great means of influence possessed by them, and  
the very few American merchants who reside in  
Great Britain, the inconvenience which may be inci-  
dent to sucli a protracted right to remain during a  
state of war, is evidently much greater on our side  
than on the other. In this view the stipulation is very  
unequal. The kberal spirit of it is, at the same time,  
highly commendable. It were only to be wished that  
the readiness on one side to make sacrifices of this  
sort, toa spirit which ought to-pervade every part of  
a treaty between the parties, had been less met by an  
apparent disposition on the other side, rather to ex-  
tort from, than to emulate it.  
  
Article 21.—Not agreeable, but not to be an insu-  
perable obstacle.  
  
“Article 22, is altogether proper.

Article 23.—This article, granting the privileges  
of the most favored nation, seems to require expla-  
nation, if not alteration. The terms “shall contznue to  
be on the footing of the most favered nation,” implies  
that the parties are now on that footing. To look no|  
further, the discrimination between exports from  
Great Britain to Europe and to the United States, is!  
« proof that the fact is otherwise.  
  
But may not the expression be construed into a  
birrier against laws on the part of the United States,  
establishing a reciprocity with the British navigation:

tion, without « return of the same or of equivalent

difficulties in the execution, but it avoids a greater  
evil. Should Spain or France open her colonies to our  
ships and productions, on our granting certain pri-  
vilezes to her trade, these could not be claimed er

Articles 24 and 25, are entirely proper.  
  
Article 26.—It is particularly desirable that the  
duration of the treaty should be abridged, to the  
term limited in the instructions of the 5th January,  
1804,  
  
Having taken this view of the subject with refer-  
ence to a formal treaty under new modifications, it  
iS necessary te recollect that you were authorised by  
my letter of February 3, to enter into informal ar-  
rangementts, and that before the receipt of my letter  
of March 18, a plan of that sort may have been defi-  
nitively settled. In such a siate of things it is impos-  
sible to do better than to leave your own judgments,  
aided by a knowledge af circumstances unknown  
here, and by the sentiments of the president now  
communicated, to decide how far it may be eligible,  
or otherwise, to attempt to supersede that informal  
arrangement, by opening the negociation herein con-  
templated.  
  
Should, on the other hand, the negociation be  
found in the state authorised by my letter, of March  
18th, that is to say, matured provisionally only, and  
consequently leaving the door open for the experi-  
ment now provided for, it must equally remain with  
your own judgments, guided by a ccmparison of the  
terms of the provisional arrangement, with the pre-  
sent instructions, to decide how far it may be best to  
close the former, or to pursue the objects of the lat-  
ter, with a view, in case of failure, to return to, and  
close the former. -  
  
Whatever may be the course recommended by the  
actual state of things, you will feel the propriety of  
smoothing the way for it, by the explanations which  
will best satisfy the British government, that the  
several steps taken on the part of the U. States, have  
proceeded from their solicitude to find some ground,  
on which the difficulties and differences existing  
between the two countries, might be amicably and  
permanently terminated. You will be equally aware

rent » inthe event of a rejection of every arrangement

an article to the following effect: .  
  
“It is agreed that after the term of months  
computed from/the exchange of ratifications, and  
during a war in which either of the parties may be  
engaged, neither of them will permit any seamen,  
not being its own citizen or subject and being a ci-  
tizen or subject of the other party, who shall not  
have been for two years at least prior to that date,  
constantly, and voluntarily, in the service, or within  
the jurisdiction of the parties respectively, to enter,  
or be employed on board any of its vessels navigating  
the high seas: and proper regulations, enforced by  
adequate penalties, shall be mutually established,  
for distinguishing the seamen of the parties respec-  
tively, and for giving full effect to this stipulation.”  
  
You will observe that the proposition is so framed.  
as not to comprehend among British seamen, those  
who have been made citizens of the United States;  
and who must necessarily be so regarded within their  
jurisdiction, and under their flag. This modification  
of the article cannot produce any real objection on  
the part of Great Britain. Ist. Because the legal  
pre-requisite to naturalization in the United States,  
imply what is sufficiently known, that the number of  
seamen actually naturalized or likely to be so, is too  
small to claim attention in any arrangement on this  
subject.  
  
2nd. Because the right of British subjects to natu-  
ralize themselves in a foreign trade and navigation,  
as laid down by the judicial authority of Great Bri-  
tain, ought to restrain the government from making  
a difficulty on this point. [See Durnford and Eust’s

public prejudices, to which the government may not  
wish to expose itself.  
  
If the British government be not predetermined  
against a friendly adjustment, it is confidently pre-  
sumed that the concession proposed, will not only  
overcome all obstacles to your success on the essen-  
sential pots, but may be&#x27;tarned to account in pro-  
moting the amendment of the other articles.  
  
Should the concession, however, contrary to all  
  
expectation, not succeed, even as to the essential  
objects, the course prescribed by prudence will be,  
to signify your purpose of transmitting the result to  
your government; avoiding carefully any language or  
appearance of hestile anticipations; and receiving and  
transmitting, at the same time, any overtures which  
may be made on the other side, with a view to bring  
about accommodation. As long as negociation can b:  
honorably protracted, it is a resource to be preferred  
under existing circumstances, to the peremptory  
alternative of improper concessions, or inevitabie  
collisions. ;  
_ The iast suggestion T have to make to yout is, that  
in case of great difficulties in re-adjusting the mul-  
tiplied provisions embraced by the treaty of Decem-  
ber, particularly those relating to commerce, it may  
be advisable, to simplify the transaction, by con  
fining it to the few essential objects, or by not ad-  
ding more than a few others of least difficulty, amd  
most importance. A genegal article may suffice for  
the rest, giving reciprocally, in regard to trade and  
navigation, armed ships and prizes the privileges to  
the most favored nation; and leaving for more lei.  
surely and detailed provision, whatever further may  
conduce to the mutual interests, and correspond with  
the friendly dispositions of the parties. A generai  
Siipulation of this sort, applied to the subject of  
commerce, would have the advant.ge to the United  
States of abolishing and preventing British diseri-  
minations on exports, and to Great Britain, the like  
advantage with respect to American discriminations  
on imporis.
