Mount Vernon July 20th 1774.  
  
Your Letter of the 17th was not presented to me till after the Resolution’s (which were adjudg’d advisable for this county to come to) had been revis’d, alterd, &amp; corrected in the Committee;  
  
nor till we had gone into a general Meeting in the Court House, and my attention necessarily call’d every moment to the business that was before it; I did however upon receipt of it (in that hurry &amp; bustle) hastily run it over, and handed it round to the Gentlemen on the Bench, of which there were many; but as no person present seem’d in the least disposed to adopt your Sentiments—as there appeard a perfect satisfaction, &amp; acquiescence to the measures propos’d (except from a Mr Williamson, who was for adopting your advise litterally, without obtaining a Second voice on his Side)—and as the Gentlemen to whom the Letter was shown, advis’d me not to have it read, as it was not like to make a Convert, &amp; repugnant (some of them thought) to the very principle we were contending for, I forebore to offer it otherwise than in the manner abovementioned, which I shall be sorry for, if it gives you any dissatisfaction in not having your Sentiments read to the County at large, instead of communicating them to the first People in it, by offering them the Letter in the manner I did.  
That I differ very widely from you, in respect to the mode of obtaining a repeal of the Acts so much, &amp; so justly complaind of, I shall not hesitate to acknowledge; &amp; that this difference in opinion may, probably, proceed from the different Construction’s we put upon the Conduct, &amp; Intention of the Ministry, may also be true; But as I see nothing on the one hand, to induce a belief that the Parliament would embrace a favourable oppertunity of Repealing Acts which they go on with great rapidity to pass, in order to enforce their Tyrannical System; and on the other, observe, or think I observe, that Government is pursuing a regular Plan at the expence of Law &amp; justice, to overthrow our Constitutional Rights &amp; liberties, how can I expect any redress from a Measure which hath been ineffectually tryd already—For Sir what is it we are contending against? Is it against paying the duty of 3d. pr lb. on Tea because burthensome? No, it is the Right only, we have all along disputed, &amp; to this end we have already Petitiond his Majesty in as humble, &amp; dutiful a manner as Subjects could do; nay more, we applied to the House of Lords, &amp; House of Commons in their different Legislative Capacities setting forth that, as Englishmen, we could not be deprivd of this essential, &amp; valuable part of our Constitution; If then (as the Fact really is) it is against the Right  
  
of Taxation we now do, &amp; (as I before said) all along have contended, why should they suppose an exertion of this power would be less obnoxious now, than formerly? and what reasons have we to believe that, they would make a Second attempt whilst the same Sentiments fill’d the Breast of every American, if they did not intend to inforce it if possible? The conduct of the Boston People could not justify the rigour of their Measures, unless their had been a requisition of payment &amp; refusal of it; nor did that measure require an Act to deprive the Governmt of Massachusets Bay of their Charter; or to exempt Offenders from tryal in the place, where Offences were Committed, as there was not, nor could not be, a single Instance produced to manifest the necessity of it—Are not all these things self evident proofs of a fixed &amp; uniform Plan to Tax us? If we want further proofs, does not all the Debates in the House of Commons serve to confirm this? and hath not Genl Gage’s Conduct since his arrival (in Stopping the Address of his Council, &amp; Publishing a Proclamation more becoming a Turkish Bashaw than an English Govr &amp; declaring it Treason to associate in any manner by which the Commerce of Great Britain is to be affected) exhibited unexampled Testimony of the most despotick System of Tyranny that ever was practiced in a free Government. In short what further proofs are wanting to satisfy one of the design’s of the Ministry than their own Acts; which are uniform, &amp; plainly tending to the same point—nay, if I mistake not, avowedly to fix the Right of Taxation—what hope then from Petitioning, when they tell us that now, or never, is the time to fix the matter—shall we after this whine &amp; cry for releif, when we have already tried it in vain?, or shall we supinely sit, and see one Provence after another fall a Sacrafice to Despotism? If I was in any doubt as to the Right wch the Parliament of Great Britain had to Tax us without our Consents, I should most heartily coincide with you in opinion, that to Petition, &amp; petition only, is the proper method to apply for relief; because we should then be asking a favour, &amp; not claiming a Right wch by the Law of Nature &amp; our Constitution we are, in my opinion, indubitably entitled to; I should even think it criminal to go further than this, under such an Idea; but none such I have, I think the Parliament of Great Britain hath no more Right to put their hands into my Pocket, without my consent, than I have to put my hands into your’s,  
  
for money; and this being already urged to them in a firm, but decent manner by all the Colonies, what reason is there to expect any thing from their justice?  
As to the Resolution for addressing the Throne, I own to you Sir I think the whole might as well have been expung’d; I expect nothing from the measure; nor shd my voice have accompanied it, if the non-Importation Scheme was intended to be Retarded by it; for I am convinc’d, as much as I am of my Existance, that there is no relief for us but in their distress; &amp; I think, at least I hope, that there is publick Virtue enough left among us to deny ourselves every thing but the bare necessaries of Life to accomplish this end—this we have a Right to do, &amp; no power upon Earth can compel us to do otherwise, till they have first reducd us to the most abject state of Slavery that ever was designd for Mankind. The Stopping our Exports would, no doubt, be a shorter Cut than the other, to effect this purpose, but if we owe Money to Great Britain, nothing but the last necessity can justify the Non-payment of it; and therefore, I have great doubts upon this head, &amp; wish to see the other method, which is legal, &amp; will facilitate these payments, first tried.  
I cannot conclude, without expressing some concern that I should differ so widely in Sentiments from you in a matter of such great Moment, &amp; general Import; &amp; should much distrust my own judgment upon the occasion, if my Nature did not recoil at the thought of Submitting to Measures which I think Subversive of every thing that I ought to hold dear and valuable—and did I not find, at the sametime, that the voice of Mankind is with me. I must appologize for sending you so rough a sketch of my thoughts upon your Letter. when I look’d back and saw the length of my own, I could not, as I am also a good deal hurried at this time, bear the thoughts of making off a fair Copy. I am Dr Sir Yr Most Obedt Humble Servt

Mount VefHon, July 201P, 177 l- ;  
Dear Sir-,  
Your letter of tho 17&#x27;Ji was not !  
presenter] to me till after the reaolu- -  
tions (which were adjudged advisable  
for this country to cmne to) had been  
revised, altered, and corrected-in the  
co natittea ; nor till we had gone in­  
to a general meeting in 11 • o court*  
house, and .ny attention necessarily  
calted every moment to the business  
lhat was, Uefpre it; I did however up­  
on tlie receipt cf it (ia that hurry  
and- bustle) hastily run it over,  
and (landed it round to the gentle­  
men on the bench, of which there  
were many ; bid as no person present  
itemed in ihe least disposed to adopt j  
your sentiments—as there appear- ;  
cd a perfect satisfaction and acquies* !  
cencc to tho measures proposed (ex* I  
cept from a Mr. Williamson, who  
. was for adopting your advice* literal­  
ly, without obtaining a second voice  
on his side)—and as the gentlemen  
to whom the letter was shewn ad­  
vised me not to bave it read, as it  
vms not like lo make =i convert, and  
repugnant (ao&#x27;ttte of them thought)  
to the very principle we were con­  
tendiit,- lei,l forbore to ofier it other­  
wise Uian in the manner above men­  
tioned, which I sliaii bo sorry for, if  
ii gives you any dissatisfaction in not  
having your sentiments read to the  
county at large, instead of commu­  
to tlie first people in il,  
by offering them the letter in tlie  
rie&#x27;r I did.  
That I differ very widely from  
j yon, in respect to the mode of Ob  
a repeal ofthe acts \o much, and  
i-itiy complained of, l sli-all  
1 it,-, to tcknowledge ; and that  
V&#x27; s difference of opinion may proba­  
bly proceed from the diTerent con­  
nwe put up&gt;it tlie conduct  
aad i iteirtton of the ministry, may  
be t&#x27;.-ite ; nut as I see nofhing on  
! the one hand, to induce a belief that  
j the parliament would embrace a la- i  
opportunity of repealing  
which they goon with great rapidity  
ito pass, in order to enforce their ty­  
-1 rannical system ; and on the other  
&lt; observe, or think I observe, that ;*o  
.] vernment ispursuinga regular plan  
jat the expence of law and justice, to  
&lt; overthrow our constitutional rights  
| and liber can I expert  
j redress from a measure which :  
; been ioefPectnally tried already.  
. sir, w • •. i we arc contendini  
it&quot; ? -Is it • yitip; tlie du­  
-3 1 per lb. on tea, bc.-.ause bur­  
one? No, Ills the fight only,  
wo have all along db-.pu&#x27;ed, and to  
this end wo have already petitioned  
hi i majesty in as humble and dutiful a  
ncr as subject-, could do ; nay  
more, we applied to the House of  
Lords 5e House of Commons in their  
dtfferei t legislative capacities, setting  
forth that as Englishmen we could  
not be deprived of this essential and  
.valuable part of our constitution. If&#x27;  
then, as the fact really is, it is a­  
gairrtt the right of taxation wo now  
do, and (as 1 before said) all along ,  
have coide why should they  
suppose a:*, exerlioh of this power  
would be less obnoxious now than for­  
merly ? And what reason have we to  
believe that they would make a se­  
cond attempt whilst the same senti­  
menis filled the breast of every Ame*  
ricwi, if they did not intend to enforce  
it if possible ? The conduct of the  
Boston people could not justify the  
rigor of their measures, unless there  
had been a requisition of pay ment and  
refusal of it ; nor did that measure  
require an act todepiivc the govern*  
n ent of Massachusetts Buy of their  
■-. nartcr, or to exempt offenders from  
ial in the place, where qffci  
vere committed ; aa there *v*.s not

duced to manifest the necessity of i.

r proofs of a fixed and uniform plan to  
tax us ? If we want further proofs,  
!oes not all the debates in the Hone  
&#x27; llommons serve to confirm this?  
(d hath not gen. Gage&#x27;s condue  
iCO his arrival (in stopping the ad  
ss of his council, and ptihlishini  
■ proclamation more becoming a  
IVirkhh Bash.iw llian an English go­  
vernor declari -.son to associ­  
ate in any manner hy which the com*  
mel&#x27;ce of Gretd Ilntain is to be ef­  
fected) exhibited unexampled testi­  
mony of the most despotic system  
e!&#x27;yranny tha&#x27; ever was practised in  
a free government. I;i short, what  
farther proofs a,.: wanting to satisfy  
one, of tha designs of tho mudstry  
than their own acts ; whie&#x27;i tc uni­  
fortu, and plainly tending to the same  
poir.t—nay, if I mistake not, avow­  
edly td fix the fight of taxation—  
what hope then from petitioning,  
when they tell us that now, or ne- |  
j ver, is the time to lix the matter ? !  
: Shall we after this wlii.te atvd cry for  
I relief, when we hive ah&#x27;cady tried it  
iin vain ? or shall we supinely sit. and  
! sec one province af er another fall a  
I sacrifice to despotism ? If I were in  
any doubt as to the ri&#x27;.vht which the  
Parliament of G. Britain had to tax  
us without our contents, I should  
most heartily coincide, with you in  
opinion, lhat to petition, and peti­  
tion only, is the proper method to ap­  
ply for relief ; because we should  
then be asking a favor, and not claim­  
ing aright which, by the lavv of na­  
ture and our constitution, wo are, in  
my opinion, indubitably entitled to;  
1 should even think it criminal to go  
far-, her than this, under such an idea ;  
&#x27; but none such I have, I think the Par­  
-lii v icnt of G. Britain hath no more  
; iie;!&gt;t to put tneir hands into my pock:  
I et, without my consent, than ! huvo  
to put my ham&#x27;s into yours for mo­  
ney ; and this being already urged to  
them in a firm, hut decent manner,  
hy all the colonies, what reason is  
there to expect any thing from their  
justice ?  
As to thi resolution !&lt;-&gt;r addressing  
the Throne, 1 own to you, sir, I  
thiokthe whole might as well buyo  
been expunged ; I expect nothing  
from the measure ; nor should my  
voice have accompanied it, if the non*  
irnpor.auon s. Ik me war, intended to  
be retarded by il ; w&gt;r 1 am coi yinc­  
e.l tis much as 1 am of my existence,  
that there;* no relief for us but in  
their distress; and I think, at least I  
hope, that there is public virtue  
eiioti among ns to our­  
i!&quot;g but ihe hare neccs­  
to rc&lt; bmplish this end ;  
ihis i right to do, and no  
- earth can compel us to  
ise, - ill i hey have lirst re­  
to the most abject state of  
that ever was designed for  
d. The stopping our exports  
he a shorter cut  
to affect this purpose,  
owe money to Great Bii­  
tab nothing but toe last necessity  
t) the non-payment of it;  
and therefore I have great doubts up­  
on this d wish to see the  
other method, Which is legal and  
will facilitate these payments, first  
tied.  
i cannot conclude without express*  
ing some concern, that I should dif­  
fer SO widely in sentiments horn you  
titer of su ii great thorn  
genera* import; and sh  
ouch distrust my ownjudgmeni  
pn the occasion, if my nature did not  
i] al the thought &#x27;d&#x27; submitting to  
measures whit h I think subversive of  
every thing that I ought to hold dear  
and valuable—and did I not find, at  
t!ie same time, that the voire of man­  
kind is with me. I must apologise  
tor sending you so rough a sketch of  
my thoughts upon your letter. When  
1 looked hark and siw tlie length of

 had meantime been repealed. As the times  
grew more exciting, Washington watched events  
steadily. He took no step backward, but he moved  
forward deliberately and with firmness. He did not  
allow himself to be carried away by the passions of  
the time. It was all very well, some said, to stop  
buying from England, but let us stop selling also.  
They need our tobacco. Suppose we refuse to  
send it unless Parliament repeals the Act. Wash-  
ington stood out against that except as a final  
resource, and for the reason which he stated in a  
letter :  
  
“I am convinced, as much as I am of my own existence, tha  
there is no relief for us but in their distress; and I think, at least I  
hope, that there is public virtue enough left among us to deny our  
selves everything but the bare necessaries of life to accomplish this  
end. This we have a right to do, and no power upon earth can com  
pel us to do otherwise, till it has first reduced us to the most abject  
state of slavery. The stopping of our exports would, no doubt, be  
a shorter method than the other to effect this purpose; but if we owe  
money to Great Britain, nothing but the last necessity can justify the  
non-payment of it; and, therefore, 1 have great doubts upon this  
head, and wish to see the other method first tried, which is legal and  
will facilitate these payments.”
