d called for a Bible and read what purported to be Chapter 27 of Genesis. Upon examining his own Bible the next morning Strahan discovered that “there was no such chapter, and that the whole was a well meant invention of my friend, whose sallies of humour, in which he is a great master, have always an unusual and benevolent tendency. With some difficulty I procured a copy of what he pretended to read, which I now send you for the entertainment of your readers.” Strahan added his hope that it would not be inappropriate at that Easter season, when the Church called upon its members “to commemorate the Amazing love of HIM, who possessing the divine virtue of Charity in the most supreme degree, laid down his life EVEN FOR HIS ENEMIES.”

n to Lord Kames by Dr. Franklin and that it had lately appeared in the London Chronicle with two added verses. The magazine thereupon printed the text of the Parable, using the Chronicle form of the Dick version, not the Kames version from the book under review.  
In 1774 Lord Kames again printed the Parable, this time in his Sketches of the History of Man. He used his own earlier version, but in a truncated form, since only the first eleven verses appeared; these were again unnumbered and were set as a solid paragraph. The omission of verses 12 and 13 remains unexplained. He introduced the piece by saying that it “was communicated to me by Dr. Franklin of Philadelphia,” and described it as a “parable against persecution,” the earliest use known of this expression.  
This shortened form of the Kames version also had a wide circulation, partly because Benjamin Vaughan reprinted it in 1779 in his edition of Franklin’s Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces. In a footnote Vaughan acknowledged Kames’s Sketches as his source and quoted from it the intr

e “an amiable sentiment … would certainly have been defeated, had he prefixed to the printed copies of the parable, which he was fond of dispersing, an intimation of its author. He therefore gave no name whatever to it, much less his own.” As often as Vaughan had heard him “read” the Parable, he had never heard Franklin claim authorship; “His good humor constantly led him into a train of amusing stories concerning the persons who had mistaken it for scripture, (for he had bound it up as a leaf in his bible, the better to impose upon them,) which, perhaps, made the point of authorship forgotten.”  
Franklin was of course unperturbed by the charge. He saw it, and he read and appreciated Vaughan’s defense. “The truth is,” he wrote, “that I never published that Chapter, and never claimed more credit from it, than what related to the style, and the addition of the concluding threatening and promise.” Lord Kames’s publishing of it without his consent had deprived him “of a good deal of amusement, which I used to take in reading it by heart out of my Bible, and obtaining the remarks of the Scriptuarians upon it, which were sometimes very diverting; not but that it is in itself, on account of the importance of its moral, well worth being made known to all mankind.”  
  
Chap. XXVII  
1. And it came to pass after these Things, that Abraham sat in the Door of his Tent, about the going down of the Sun.  
2. And behold a Man, bowed with Age, came from the Way of the Wilderness, leaning on a Staff.  
3. And Abraham arose and met him, and said unto him, Turn in, I pray thee, and wash thy Feet, and tarry all Night, and thou shalt arise early on the Morrow, and go on thy Way.  
  
4. And the Man said, Nay, for I will abide under this Tree.  
5. But Abraham pressed him greatly; so he turned, and they went into the Tent; and Abraham baked unleavend Bread, and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that the Man blessed not God, he said unto him, Wherefore dost thou not worship the most high God, Creator of Heaven and Earth?  
7. And the Man answered and said, I do not worship the God thou speakest of; neither do I call upon his Name; for I have made to myself a God, which abideth alway in mine House, and provideth me with all Things.  
8. And Abraham’s Zeal was kindled against the Man; and he arose, and fell upon him, and drove him forth with Blows into the Wilderness.  
9. And at Midnight God called unto Abraham, saying, Abraham, where is the Stranger?  
10. And Abraham answered and said, Lord, he would not worship thee, neither would he call upon thy Name; therefore have I driven him out from before my Face into the Wilderness.  
11. And God said, Have I born with him these hundred ninety and eight Years, and nourished him, and cloathed him, notwithstanding his Rebellion against me, and couldst not thou, that art thyself a Sinner, bear with him one Night?  
12. And Abraham said, Let not the Anger of my Lord wax hot against his Servant. Lo, I have sinned; forgive me, I pray Thee:  
13. And Abraham arose and went forth into the Wilderness, and sought diligently for the Man, and found him, and returned with him to his Tent; and when he had entreated him kindly, he sent him away on the Morrow with Gifts.  
14. And God spake again unto Abraham, saying, For this thy Sin shall thy Seed be afflicted four Hundred Years in a strange Land:  
  
15. But for thy Repentance will I deliver them; and they shall come forth with Power, and with Gladness of Heart, and with much Substance.

CHAPTER XXVH.  
  
1. And it came to pass after these things,  
that Abraham sat in the door of his tent,  
about the going down, of the sun,  
  
2. And behold, a man bowed with age,  
coming from the way of the wilderness  
leaning on a staiF.  
  
3. And Abraham arose, and met hinri,  
and said unto him,.turn in, I pr^y thee,  
and wash thy feet, and tarry allnighpi  
and thou sh&#x27;alt arise early in the morning,  
and go on thy way..  
  
4. But the man said, nay&#x27;, for I will  
abide under this tree,  
  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly ;  
so he turned, and they went into the tent:  
and Abraham baked unleavened bread,  
and they did eat.  
  
G. And when Abraham saw that the  
man blessed not God, he said unto hinr,  
Wherefore dost thou not worship the  
most high God, creator of -Heaven and  
Earth?  
  
7. And the man ans^vered and s&#x27;aid»  
I do not worship thy God, neither*do f  
call upon his name ; for I have made to  
myself a God, which abideth alway in  
mine house, ^nd providelh me with all  
things.  
  
! 8. And Abraham^s zeal was kindled  
  
against the man, and he arose, and felt  
upon him, and drave him forth with  
blows into the wilderness,  
  
“9. And at midnight God called unto  
Abraham, saying, Abraham, where is the  
stranger ?  
  
10. And Abraham answered and said,  
Lord, be would not worship thee, nei¬  
ther would he call upon thy name; there¬  
fore have I driven him out from before  
my face, into the wilderness.  
  
41.*And Gbd said, have i borne with  
him these hundred ninety and eight  
years, afnd nourished him, and clothed  
him, notwithstanding his rebellion a-  
gainst n»e; and coiildest not thou, that  
art thyself a sinner, bear v^ith him one  
night ?  
  
12. - And Abraham said, Let not the  
anger of the Lord wax hot against&#x27;his  
servant; lo, 1 have sinned r forgive me,  
I pray thee.  
  
13. And he arose, and went forth into  
the wilderness, and sought diligently for  
the man, and found him:  
  
14. And returned with him to his tent;  
and when he had entreated him kindly,  
he sent him away in the morning with  
gifts.  
  
15. And God spake again unto Abra¬  
ham, saying, for this thy sin, shall thy seed  
be afflicted four hundred years In a strange  
land.  
  
16. But for thy repentance will I deli¬  
ver them j and they shall come forth with  
power, and with gladness of heart, and  
with much substance.

morning turning to the book of (genesis,

him, notwithstanding his rebellion against me; and couldst

were interested in it, kindly made us a  
present of it. It will be seen that its antiquated,  
scriptural style, would give the impression that  
it was a quotation from Genesis. Here it is,  
It contains an important moral.  
  
“And it came to pass, after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door of his tent about the  
going down of the sun, and behold a man bent  
with age came from the way of the wilderness  
leaning ona staff. And Abraham arose and

sed him greatly ; so he turned and they went

saw that the man blessed not God, he said unto

kindled against the man, and he arose and fell  
upon him and drove him forth with blows into  
the wilderness. And God ealled unto Abraham,

and said, Lerd, he would not worship thee,

have I driven him out from before my fice into

in expressing any sentiments which he wished  
to inculcate upon mankind. One of the most  
striking examples of this is the celebrated Para-  
ble against persecution of which he is generally  
considered the author ; it is as follows :  
  
ND it came to pass  
after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door  
of his tent, about the  
going down of the sun.  
2. And behold, a  
man, bowed with age,  
came from the way of  
the wilderness, leaning  
on a staff  
3. And Abraham arose and met  
him, and said unto him, “ Turn in, I  
pray thee, and wash thy feet, and tar-  
ry all night, and thou shalt arise early  
on the morrow, and go on thy way.”  
4. But the man said, “ Nay, for I will abide  
under this tree.”  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly ; so he  
  
turned, and they went into the tent, and Abra  
ham baked unleavened brgad, and they did eat  
  
6. And when Abraham saw that the map  
blessed not God, he said unto him, “ Wherefore  
dost thou not worship the most high God, Creat.  
or of heaven and earth ?”  
  
7. And the man answered and said, “I dong  
worship the God thou speakest of, neither do |  
call upon his name ; for I have made to myself a  
god, which abideth alway in mine house, anj  
provideth me with all things.”  
  
8. And Abraham’s zeal was kindled against  
the man, and he arose and fell upon him, and  
drove him forth with blows into the wiMerness.  
  
9. And at midnight God called unto Abraham,  
saying, ‘‘ Abraham, where is the stranger &quot;’  
  
10. And Abraham answered and said, “ Lord,  
he would not worship thee, neither would he call  
upon thy name ; therefore have I driven him out  
from before my face into the wilderness.”  
  
11. And God said, ‘“ Have I borne with him  
these hundred ninety and eight years, and nour  
ished him, and clothed him, notwithstanding his  
rebellion against me ; and couldst not thou, that  
art thyself a sinner, bear with him one night!”

the dress and additions which it received from Dr.  
Franklin&#x27;s hand.&quot;  
1. And it came to pass after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door of his tent, about the  
going down of thg sun.  
2. And behold a man, bowed with age, came  
from the way of the wilderness leaning on a staff.  
3. And Abraham arose and met him, and said  
unto him, 14 Turn in, I pray thee, and wash thy  
feet, and tarry all night, and thou shalt arise  
early on the morrow, and go on thy way.&quot;  
4. But the man said 44 2tay, for I will abide  
under this tree.&quot;  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly; so he  
turned and they went into the tent, and Abra­  
ham baked unleavened bread, and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that the man  
blessed not God, he said unto him, 44 Wherefore  
dost thou not worship the most high God, Crea  
tor of beaven and earth 7 &#x27;  
7. And the man answered and said, 44 1 do not  
worship the God thou speaketh of, neither do  
call upon his name ; fur I have made to myself a  
Ood, which abideth always in mine house, and  
provideth me with all things  
8. And Abraham&#x27;s zeal was kindled against  
the man, and he arose and fell upon him, and  
drove him furth with blows into the wilderness  
9. And at midnight God called unto Abraham,  
saying, 44 Abraham, where is the stranger  
10. And Abraham answered and said, 44 Lord,  
he would not worship thee, neither would he call  
upon thy name ; therefore have I driven him out  
from before my lace into the wilderness.  
11. And God said, 44 Have I borne with him

&quot;And it canr? to pass, after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door of his tent about the­  
going down of the sun, and behold a man bent  
with age, coming from &#x27;the way of the wilder­

met him; turn in,. I pray thee, and wash thy  
f eet, and tarry all night, and thou shalt rise yearly  
in the morning and go on thy way.&#x27; And the  
old man said, &#x27;Nay, for I will abide under this  
tree.&#x27; But Abraham pressed him greatly, and  
  
lie turned and went into the tent, and Abraham4&#x27;  
  
baked unleavened bread and they did eat. And  
when Abraham saw that the man blessed not  
God, he said unto him, &#x27;Wherefore dost thou  
not worskip the most high God, creator of hea­  
ven and earth?&#x27; And the man answered and  
said, 4I do not worship thy God,- neither do I  
call upon his name: for I have made to myself a  
God which bideth always in mine house and  
provi&#x27;deth me with all things , And Abraham&#x27;s  
i.ecii was kindled against the man, and be arose  
and fell upon the man, and drove him forth with  
blows into fche wilderness. And God called un­  
to Abraham, sayiog, &#x27;Abraham where is &#x27;the  
stranger?&#x27; And Abraham answered andeaid,  
&#x27;Lord, he wculd not worship thee, neither would  
he call upon thy name, therefore have I driven  
Liia out from, before my face intp tbe wilder­  
ness And God said, &#x27;Have I borne with him  
these hundred and ninety and eight years; and

that he kept a copy of it bound up in a  
Bible, and often read it from the volume  
to bis visitors much to their perplexity,  
who invaribly expressed their astonish­  
ment that they should never bare discuv  
ered it in their owm reading of the scrip­  
tures. We publish it for thejreasqn first,  
that wc have never seen it in a newspsper  
and, secondly, for the beautiful moral it  
inculcates and that our renders may have  
the benefit of it.  
1. And it came to pass after these  
things, that Abraham sal in the door &gt; f  
his tent, about the going down of the

2. And behold, a man imwed with  
age, came from the way of the wilder­

aud said unto him, “ Turn in, 1 pray thee,  
and wash thy feet, nnd tarry all night,  
and thou slialt arise early on the morrow,  
and go on thy way.  
4. But the man said, ‘ Nay, for 1 will  
abide under this tree.”  
5. And Abraham pressed him gently ;  
so he tinned and they went into the tent,  
and Abraham baked unleveucd bread,

G. And when Abraham saw that tbe  
man blessed not God he said unto him,  
“ Wherefore dost thou non worsirp die

“ I do not worship the God thou speak  
est of, neither do I call upon his name;  
for I have made to mysell a God, which  
abideth always in mine house, aud pro  
videth me with all things.  
8. And Abrahams zeal was kindled  
against the man, and he arose nnd fell  
upon and drove him forth with blows in­  
to the wilderness.  
9 Aud at midnight God ctdled unto  
Abraham, saying, “Abraham where is  
the stranger ?”  
10. And Abraham answered and said,  
•* Lord, ho would not worship Thee,  
neither would he call upon Thy name;  
therefore have 1 driven him out from be  
fore my face into the wilderness.&quot;  
11. And God said, “Have 1 borne  
with him these hundred ninty and eight  
years, and nourished him, aud cloathed  
him, uotwithslandiug his

igently for the man, and found him, aud  
returded with him to the tent; and wheu  
he had entreated him kindly, ho, sent him

WORTH PRESErViNG.  
A Heautiful Chapter Resembling the Or-  
iginal of the Bible.  
Over one hundred years ago the fol­  
lowing so-called &quot;Genesis 5l&quot; was used  
to puzzle Biblical scholars, and to-day,  
were it read aloud in any mixed com­  
pany, it is questionable if its fraudulent  
nature would be discovered, so beauti­  
fully is the spirit and language of the  
Old Testament imitated:  
1. And it came to pass after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door of his tent, about the  
going down of the sun.  
2. And behold a man, bowed with age, came  
from the way of the wilderness, leaning on a  
ttaff.  
3 And Abraham arose and met him, and said  
unto him. Turn in, I pray thee, and wash thy  
feet, and tarry all night, and thou shalt arise  
early on the morrow, and go thy way.  
t But the man said: Nay, for I will abide  
under this tree  
5. And Abraham pressed him grsatly; so he  
turned, and they went into the tent, and Abra  
ham baked unleavened bread, and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that the man  
olessed not God, he said unto him: Wherefore  
dost thou not worship the Most High God, Cre  
ator of Heaven and earth?  
7. And the man answered and said: I do not  
worship the God thou speakest of, neither do I  
call upon His name; for I have made to myself a  
God, which abideth alway in my house and pro­  
videth me with all things.  
8. And Abrahim&#x27;s zeal was kindled against  
Se man, and he arose and drove hinf forth with  
blows into the wiiderness  
9. And at midnight God called unto Abrahain  
aying: Abraham, where is the strangerr  
10. And Abraham answered and said: Lord  
e would not worship Thee, neither would he  
call upon Thy name, therefore have I driven him  
t from before my face into the wilderness  
1. And God said: Have I not borne with hin  
these hundred ninety and eight years, and nour  
ished him, and clothed him, notwithstanding  
his rebellion against me, and couldst hot thos  
that art thyself a sinner, bear with him ont  
aight?  
12. And Abraham said: Let not the anger of  
ny Lord wax against His servant; io! I have  
inned, forgive me, I pray Thee  
12. And Abraham arose and went forth into  
the wilderness, and sought diligently for the  
man, and found him and returned with him to  
the tent, and when he had entreated him kindly,  
he sent him away on the morrow with gifts.  
14. And God spake again unto Abraham say  
ing: For this thy sin shall thy seed be afflicted  
four hundred years in a strange land.

The Bible Puzzle that was Originated 100  
Years Ago  
Over 100 years ago the following so  
called &quot;Genesis 51&quot; was used to puzzle  
Biblical scholars, and to-day, were it read  
aloud in any mixed company, it is ques­  
tionable if its fraudulent nature would be  
discovered, so beautifully is the spirit  
and language of the Old Testament imi­  
tated  
1. And it came to pass after these  
things that Abraham sat in the door of  
his tent about the going down of the sun  
2. And behold a man bowed down  
with age, came from the way of the wil­  
derness, leaning on his staff  
3. And Abraham arose and met him  
and said unto him, Turn in, I pray thee  
and wash thy feet, and tarry all night, and  
thou shalt arise early on the morrow and  
go thy way  
4. But the man said, Nay, for I will  
abide under this tree  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly  
so that he turned, and they went into the  
tent, and Abraham baked unleavened  
bread and they did eat  
6 !And when Abraham saw that the  
man blessed not God, he said unto him  
Wherefore dost not thou not worship the­  
m st high God, creator of heaven and  
earth  
7. And the man answered and said: &quot;I  
do not worship the God thou speakest of  
neither do I call upon his name; for I  
have made to myself a God, which abideth  
always in my house and provideth me  
with all things  
S And Abraham&#x27;s zeal was kindled  
against the man, and he arose and drove  
him forth with blows into the wilderness  
9. And at midnight God called unto  
Abraham, saying: &quot;Abraham, where is  
the stranger  
10. And Abraham answered and said  
Lord, he would not worship Thee, neither  
would he call upon Thy name; therefore  
have I driven him out from before my  
face into the wilderness  
11. And God said, Have I not borne  
with him these hundred and ninety and  
eight years, and nourished and clothed  
him, notwithstanding his rebellion  
against me, and couldst not thou, that  
art thyself a sinner, bear with him one  
night  
12. And Abraham said, Let not the  
anger of my Lord wax against his ser­  
vant; lo! I have sinned, forgive me, I  
pray Thee  
13. And Abraham arose and went forth  
into the wilderness, and sought diligently  
for the man, and found him, and re­  
turned with him to the tent, and when he  
had entertained him kindly he sent him  
away on the morrow with gifts  
14. And God spoke again unto Abraham  
  
saving, for this thy sin shall thy seed be  
  
afflicted 400)3 ars in a strange land.  
15. But for the repentance will I  
deliver them, and they shall come forth

I For tha past 600 or 000 years the following

i to-day, were it read aloud in any mixed

givo this unique fraud in full:

thee, and wash thy feet, and tarry all  
night, and thou shalt arise early on the  
morrow and go thy wav.  
4. But the man said, Nay, for I will  
abide under this tree.  
5. And Abraham pressed him greatly,  
so lie turned and they went into the  
tent; and Abraham broke unleavened  
bread and they did eat.

man blessed not God, he said unto him,  
Wherefore dost thou not worship tho  
  
Moat High God, creator of Hoaveii and  
enrth.  
7. And the man answered and said, I  
do not worship the God thon gpettkost  
of, neitlier do I call upon His name, for  
1 have made to myself a God which  
nbiileth always in mv house and provldcth  
me with all thfngs.  
8. And Abraham&#x27;s anger was kindled  
ngninst that man for what he had  
I said, and he aroac^ind drove him forth  
with blows into the wilderness.  
I). And at midnight God called upon  
Abraham, saving, Abraham, vhero la  
tho stranger that came by the way of  
thy tent at the going down of the ann?  
10. And Abraham answered and said,  
I Lord, he would sot worshipThee,neither  
would he call upon Thy name, therefore  
I havo driven him out before my  
face into the wildorness.  
11. And God said, have X not borne  
with him these hundred and ninety and

clothed him, notwithstanding that ho  
has rebelled against Mo? Couldst thou  
not, thco thyself being a sinner, bear

lo! I have sinned, forgive me I

to the tent, nnd when ho hnd entertained  
Mm kindly he sent him awayion

&quot;Genesis rifty-One.&quot;  
For the past 500 or GOO years the  
  
following so-called &quot;Qenesi3 Fifty-  
one,&quot; has been a puzzle to biblical  
scholars ; andt today, were it read  
aloud in any mixed company, it is  
questionable if its fraudulent nature  
would be discovered, so beautifully  
Is4he spirit and language of the Old  
Testament imitated. Below we give  
this unique fraud in full :  
1. And it came to pass after these  
things that Abraham sat in the door  
of his tent at about the going down  
of the sun.  
2. And behold a man, bowed with  
age, came from the way of the wil­  
derness, leaning on a staff.  
3. And Abraham arose and met  
him, Turn Id, I pray thee, and wash  
thy feet, and tarry all night, and  
thou shalt arise early on the morrow  
and go thy way.  
4. But the man said, Nay, for I  
will abide under this tree.  
5. And Abraham pressed him  
greatly, so he turned and they went  
into the tent; and Abraham broke  
uuleavened bread, and they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that  
the man blessed not God, he said un­  
to him, whereiore doest thou not wor  
ship the Most High God, creator of  
heaven and earth.  
7. And the man answered and said,  
I do not worship the God thon speak­  
est of, neither do I call upon His  
name, for I have made to myself a  
God which abideth always in my  
house and provideth me with all  
thing3.  
8. And Abraham&#x27;s anger was kin  
dled against that man for what he  
had said, and he arose and drove  
him forth with blows into tho wil­  
derness.9. And at midnigth God called  
upon Abraham, saying, Abraham,  
where is the stranger that came by  
the way of thy tent at the going  
down of the sun.  
10. And Abraham answered and  
said, Lord, he would not worship  
Thee, neither would he call upon  
Thy name, therefore I have driven  
him out from before my face into the  
wilderness.  
11. And God said, Have I not  
borne with him these hundred and  
ninety and eight years, and nourish­  
ed him, and clothed him, notwith­  
standing he has rebelled against Me?  
Couldst thou not, thee thyself being  
a sinner, bear with him one night ?  
12. And Abraham said, Let not the  
anger of my Lord wax against his  
servant ;. lo ! I have sinned, forgive  
me I pray of Thee.  
13. And Abraham arose and went  
forth into the wilderness and sought  
diligently for the man until he had  
found him and returnMl with him  
to the tent, and when he had enter­  
tained him kindly he sent him away  
on the morrow with many gifts.  
14. And God spake again unto  
Abraham saying, &#x27;for this thy sin  
against;the stranger, thy seed shall  
be afflicted four hundred years in a  
strange land.  
15. But for thy repentance, will I  
deliver them, and they shall come  
forth with power and with gladness  
of heart.

were it read aloud in any mixed company,  
it is questionable if its fraudulent nature

Imitated. Below we give this unique

1. And it came to pass after these things  
that Abraham satin the door of bis tent at

2. And behold a man, bowed with asje,

3. And Abraham arose and met him and  
said unto him, Turn in, I pray thee, and  
wash thy feet, and tarry nil night, and  
thou shalt arise early on the morrow and  
go thy way.  
4. But the man said, Nay, for I willabids  
under this tree. &#x27;  
3. And Abraham pressed him greatly, so  
he turned and they -went into the tent; and  
Abraham broke unleavened bread, and  
they did eat.  
6. And when Abraham saw that the man t  
blesed not God, he said unto him, Where­  
fore doest thou not worship the most high &#x27;  
God, c-eator of heaven and earth? &#x27;  
7. And the man answered and said, I do  
not  
worship the God thou speakest of, i  
neither do I call upon his name, for I have  
made to mvself a irod which abideth al-  
ways in my house and provideth me with &#x27;  
all things. &#x27;  
S. And Abraham&#x27;s anuer was kindled  
against that man for what he had said, and 1  
he arose and drove him forth with blows  
into the wilderness. ,  
9. And at midnight God called upon i

greatly, so he turned and they went

CHAP. LXVII.  
  
And it came to pass after these things, that  
Abraham sat in the door of his tent, about the  
going down of the sun.  
  
2. And behold, a man bowed with age, com-  
ing from the way of the wilderness, leaning

5. And Abraham pressed him greatly ; so he  
turned and they went into the tent; and Abra-  
ham baked unleavened bread, and they did  
eat.  
  
6. And when Abraham saw that the man  
blessed not God, he said unto him, Wherefore  
dost thou not worship the most high God, cre-  
ator of heaven and earth?  
  
7. And the man answered and said, I do not  
worship thy God, neither do I call upon his  
name; for I have made to myself a God which  
abideth always in my house, and provideth  
me with all things.  
  
8. And Abraham’s zeal was kindled against  
the man, and he arose and fell upon him and  
drave him forth with blows into the wilder-  
ness.  
  
9, And at midnight God called unto Abra-

10. And Abraham answered and said, Lord,  
he would not worship thee, neither would he  
call upon thy name; therefore have I driven  
him out from before my face into the wilder-

11. And God said, Have I borne with him  
these hundred, ninety and eight years, and  
nourished him and clothed him, notwithstand-  
ing his rebellion against me; and coulds’t not  
thou, that art thyself a sinner, bear with him  
one night?  
  
12. And Abraham said, Let not the anger of  
my Lord wax hot against his servant: lo, I  
have sinned ; forgive me I pray thee.  
  
13. And he arose and went forth into the  
wilderness, and sought diligently for the man  
and found him:  
  
14. And returned with him to his tent; and  
when he had entreated him kindly, he sent  
him away in the morning with gifts.

saying, For this thy sin shall thy seed be af-
