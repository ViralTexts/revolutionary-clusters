mber 3, 1780]  
Dr. Sir  
Agreeably to your request and my promise I sit down to give you my ideas of the defects of our present system, and the changes necessary to save us from ruin. They may perhaps be the reveries of a projector rather than the sober views of a politician. You will judge of them, and make what use you please of them.  
The fundamental defect is a want of power in Congress. It is hardly worth while to show in what this consists, as it seems to be universally acknowleged, or to point out how it has happened, as the only question is how to remedy it. It may however be said that it has originated from three causes—an excess of the spirit of liberty which has made the particular states show a jealousy of all power not in their own hands; and this jealousy has led them to exercise a right of judging in the last resort of the measures recommended by Congress, and of acting according to their own opinions of their propriety or necessity, a diffidence in Congress of their own powers, by which they have been timid and indecisive in their resolutions, constantly making concessions to the states, till they have scarcely left themselves the shadow of power; a want of sufficient means at their disposal to answer the public exigencies and of vigor to draw forth those means; which have occasioned them to depend on the states individually to fulfil their engagements with the army, and the consequence of which has been to ruin their influence and credit with the army, to establish its dependence on each state separately rather than on them, that is rather than on the whole collectively.  
It may be pleaded, that Congress had never any definitive powers granted them and of course could exercise none—could do nothing more than recommend. The manner in which Congress was appointed would warrant, and the public good required, that they should have considered themselves as vested with full power to preserve the republic from harm. They have done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, which were always chearfully submitted to—the declaration of independence, the declaration of war, the levying an army, creating a navy, emitting money, making alliances with foreign powers, appointing a dictator &amp;c. &amp;c.—all these implications of a complete sovereignty were never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the whole conduct of Administration. Undefined powers are discretionary powers, limited only by the object for which they were given—in the present case, the independence and freedom of America. The confederation made no difference; for as it has not been generally adopted, it had no operation. But from what I recollect of it, Congress have even descended from the authority which the spirit of that act gives them, while the particular states have no further attended to it than as it suited their pretensions and convenience. It would take too much time to enter into particular instances, each of which separately might appear inconsiderable; but united are of serious import. I only mean to remark, not to censure.  
But the confederation itself is defective and requires to be altered; it is neither fit for war, nor peace. The idea of an uncontrolable sovereignty in each state, over its internal police, will defeat the other powers given to Congress, and make our union feeble and precarious. There are instances without number, where acts necessary for the general good, and which rise out of the powers given to Congress must interfere with the internal police of the states, and there are as many instances in which the particular states by arrangements of internal police can effectually though indirectly counteract the arrangements of Congress. You have already had examples of this for which I refer you to your own memory.  
The confederation gives the states individually too much influence in the affairs of the army; they should have nothing to do with it. The entire formation and disposal of our military forces ought to belong to Congress. It is an essential cement of the union; and it ought to be the policy of Congress to des⟨troy⟩ all ideas of state attachments in the army and make it look up wholly to them. For this purpose all appointments promotions and provisions whatsoever ought to be made by them. It may be apprehended that this may be dangerous to liberty. But nothing appears more evident to me, than that we run much greater risk of having a weak and disunited federal government, than one which will be able to usurp upon the rights of the people. Already some of the lines of the army would obey their states in opposition to Congress notwithstanding the pains we have taken to preserve the unity of the army—if any thing would hinder this it would be the personal influence of the General, a melancholy and mortifying consideration.  
The forms of our state constitutions must always give them great weight in our affairs and will make it too difficult to bend them to the persuit of a common interest, too easy to oppose whatever they do not like and to form partial combinations subversive of the general one. There is a wide difference between our situation and that of an empire under one simple form of government, distributed into counties provinces or districts, which have no legisla⟨tures⟩ but merely magistratical bodies to execute the laws of a common sovereign. Here the danger is that the sove[re]ign will have too much power to oppress the parts of which it is composed. In our case, that of an empire composed of confederated states each with a government completely organised within itself, having all the means to draw its subjects to a close dependence on itself—the danger is directly the reverse. It is that the common sovereign will not have power sufficient to unite the different members together, and direct the common forces to the interest and happiness of the whole.  
The leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof of this. They were continually at war with each other, and for want of union fell a prey to their neighbours. They frequently held general councils, but their resolutions were no further observed than as they suited the interests and inclinations of all the parties and at length, they sunk intirely into contempt.  
The Swiss-cantons are another proof of the doctrine. They have had wars with each other which would have been fatal to them, had not the different powers in their neighbourhood been too jealous of one-another and too equally matched to suffer either to take advantage of their quarrels. That they have remained so long united at all is to be attributed to their weakness, to their poverty, and to the cause just mentioned. These ties will not exist in America; a little time hence, some of the states will be powerful empires, and we are so remote from other nations that we shall have all the leisure and opportunity we can wish to cut each others throats.  
The Germanic corps might also be cited as an example in favour of the position.  
The United provinces may be thought to be one against it. But the family of the stadtholders whose authority is interwoven with the whole government has been a strong link of union between them. Their physical necessities and the habits founded upon them have contributed to it. Each province is too inconsiderable by itself to undertake any thing. An analysis of their present constitutions would show that they have many ties which would not exist in ours; and that they are by no means a proper mode for us.  
Our own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the difficulty of drawing out the resources of the country and inducing the states to combine in equal exertions for the common cause. The ill success of our last attempt is striking. Some have done a great deal, others little or scarcely any thing. The disputes about boundaries &amp;c. testify how flattering a prospect we have of future tranquillity, if we do not frame in time a confederacy capable of deciding the differences and compelling the obedience of the respective members.  
The confederation too gives the power of the purse too intirely to the state legislatures. It should provide perpetual funds in the disposal of Congress—by a land tax, poll tax, or the like. All imposts upon commerce ought to be laid by Congress and appropriated to their use, for without certain revenues, a government can have no power; that power, which holds the purse strings absolutely, must rule. This seems to be a medium, which without making Congress altogether independent will tend to give reality to its authority.  
Another defect in our system is want of method and energy in the administration. This has partly resulted from the other defect, but in a great degree from prejudice and the want of a proper executive. Congress have kept the power too much into their own hands and have meddled too much with details of every sort. Congress is properly a deliberative corps and it forgets itself when it attempts to play the executive. It is impossible such a body, numerous as it is, constantly fluctuating, can ever act with sufficient decision, or with system. Two thirds of the members, one half the time, cannot know what has gone before them or what connection the subject in hand has to what has been transacted on former occasions. The members, who have been more permanent, will only give information, that promotes the side they espouse, in the present case, and will as often mislead as enlighten. The variety of business must distract, and the proneness of every assembly to debate must at all times delay.  
Lately Congress, convinced of these inconveniences, have gone into the measure of appointing boards. But this is in my opinion a bad plan. A single man, in each department of the administration, would be greatly preferable. It would give us a chance of more knowlege, more activity, more responsibility and of course more zeal and attention. Boards partake of a part of the inconveniencies of larger assemblies. Their decisions are slower their energy less their responsibility more diffused. They will not have the same abilities and knowlege as an administration by single men. Men of the first pretensions will not so readily engage in them, because they will be less cospicuous, of less importance, have less opportunity of distinguishing themselves. The members of boards will take less pains to inform themselves and arrive to eminence, because they have fewer motives to do it. All these reasons conspire to give a preference to the plan of vesting the great executive departments of the state in the hands of individuals. As these men will be of course at all times under the direction of Congress, we shall blend the advantages of a monarchy and republic in our constitution.  
A question has been made, whether single men could be found to undertake these offices. I think they could, because there would be then every thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But in order to this Congress by their manner of appointing them and the line of duty marked out must show that they are in earnest in making these offices, offices of real trust and importance.  
I fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrangements, as though they would lessen the importance of Congress and leave them nothing to do. But they would have precisely the same rights and powers as heretofore, happily disencumbered of the detail. They would have to inspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their plans, originate others for the public good—only observing this rule that they ought to consult their ministers, and get all the information and advice they could from them, before they entered into any new measures or made changes in the old.  
A third defect is the fluctuating constitution of our army. This has been a pregnant source of evil; all our military misfortunes, three fourths of our civil embarrassments are to be ascribed to it. The General has so fully enumerated the mischief of it in a late letter of the  to Congress that I could only repeat what he has said, and will therefore refer you to that letter.  
  
The imperfect and unequal provision made for the army is a fourth defect which you will find delineated in the same letter. Without a speedy change the army must dissolve; it is now a mob, rather than an army, without cloathing, without pay, without provision, without morals, without discipline. We begin to hate the country for its neglect of us; the country begins to hate us for our oppressions of them. Congress have long been jealous of us; we have now lost all confidence in them, and give the worst construction to all they do. Held together by the slenderest ties we are ripening for a dissolution.  
The present mode of supplying the army—by state purchases—is not one of the least considerable defects of our system. It is too precarious a dependence, because the states will never be sufficiently impressed with our necessities. Each will make its own ease a primary object, the supply of the army a secondary one. The variety of channels through which the business is transacted will multiply the number of persons employed and the opportunities of embezzling public money. From the popular spirit on which most of the governments turn, the state agents, will be men of less character and ability, nor will there be so rigid a responsibility among them as there might easily be among those in the employ of the continent, of course not so much diligence care or economy. Very little of the money raised in the several states will go into the Continental treasury, on pretence, that it is all exhausted in providing the quotas of supplies, and the public will be without funds for the other demands of governments. The expence will be ultimately much greater and the advantages much smaller. We actually feel the insufficiency of this plan and have reason to dread under it a ruinous extremity of want.  
These are the principal defects in the present system that now occur to me. There are many inferior ones in the organization of particular departments and many errors of administration which might be pointed out; but the task would be troublesome and tedious, and if we had once remedied those I have mentioned the others would not be attended with much difficulty.  
I shall now propose the remedies, which appear to me applicable to our circumstances, and necessary to extricate our affairs from their present deplorable situation.  
  
The first step must be to give Congress powers competent to the public exigencies. This may happen in two ways, one by resuming and exercising the discretionary powers I suppose to have been originally vested in them for the safety of the states and resting their conduct on the candor of their country men and the necessity of the conjuncture: the other by calling immediately a convention of all the states with full authority to conclude finally upon a general confederation, stating to them beforehand explicity the evils arising from a want of power in Congress, and the impossibily of supporting the contest on its present footing, that the delegates may come possessed of proper sentiments as well as proper authority to give to the meeting. Their commission should include a right of vesting Congress with the whole or a proportion of the unoccupied lands, to be employed for the purpose of raising a revenue, reserving the jurisdiction to the states by whom they are granted.  
The first plan, I expect will be thought too bold an expedient by the generality of Congress; and indeed their practice hitherto has so rivetted the opinion of their want of power, that the success of this experiment may very well be doubted.  
I see no objection to the other mode, that has any weight in competition with the reasons for it. The Convention should assemble the 1st of November next, the sooner, the better; our disorders are too violent to admit of a common or lingering remedy. The reasons for which I require them to be vested with plenipotentiary authority are that the business may suffer no delay in the execution, and may in reality come to effect. A convention may agree upon a confederation; the states individually hardly ever will. We must have one at all events, and a vigorous one if we mean to succeed in the contest and be happy hereafter. As I said before, to engage the states to comply with this mode, Congress ought to confess to them plainly and unanimously the impracticability of supporting our affairs on the present footing and without a solid coercive union. I ask that the Convention should have a power of vesting the whole or a part of the unoccupied land in Congress, because it is necessary that body should have some property as a fund for the arrangements of finance; and I know of no other kind that can be given them.  
The confederation in my opinion should give Congress complete sovereignty; except as to that part of internal police, which relates to the rights of property and life among individuals and to raising money by internal taxes. It is necessary, that every thing, belonging to this, should be regulated by the state legislatures. Congress should have complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace, trade, finance, and to the management of foreign affairs, the right of declaring war of raising armies, officering, paying them, directing their motions in every respect, of equipping fleets and doing the same with them, of building fortifications arsenals magazines &amp;c. &amp;c., of making peace on such conditions as they think proper, of regulating trade, determining with what countries it shall be carried on, granting indulgencies laying prohibitions on all the articles of export or import, imposing duties granting bounties &amp; premiums for raising exporting importing and applying to their own use the product of these duties, only giving credit to the states on whom they are raised in the general account of revenues and expences, instituting Admiralty courts &amp;c., of coining money, establishing banks on such terms, and with such privileges as they think proper, appropriating funds and doing whatever else relates to the operations of finance, transacting every thing with foreign nations, making alliances offensive and defensive, treaties of commerce, &amp;c. &amp;c.  
The confederation should provide certain perpetual revenues, productive and easy of collection, a land tax, poll tax or the like, which together with the duties on trade and the unlocated lands would give Congress a substantial existence, and a stable foundation for their schemes of finance. What more supplies were necessary should be occasionally demanded of the states, in the present mode of quotas.  
The second step I would recommend is that Congress should instantly appoint the following great officers of state—A secretary for foreign affairs—a President of war—A President of Marine—A Financier—A President of trade; instead of this last a board of Trade may be preferable as the regulations of trade are slow and gradual and require prudence and experience (more than other qualities), for which boards are very well adapted.  
Congress should choose for these offices, men of the first abilities, property and character in the continent—and such as have had the best opportunities of being acquainted with the several branches. General Schuyler(whom you mentioned) would make an excellent  President of War, General McDougall a very good President of Marine. Mr. Robert Morris would have many things in his favour for the department of finance. He could by his own personal influence give great weight to the measures he should adopt. I dare say men equally capable may be found for the other departments.  
I know not, if it would not be a good plan to let the Financier be President of the Board of trade; but he should only have a casting voice in determining questions there. There is a connection between trade and finance, which ought to make the director of one acquainted with the other; but the Financier should not direct the affairs of trade, because for the sake of acquiring reputation by increasing the revenues, he might adopt measures that would depress trade. In what relates to finance he should be alone.  
These offices should have nearly the same powers and functions as those in France analogous to them, and each should be chief in his department, with subordinate boards composed of assistant clerks &amp;c. to execute his orders.  
In my opinion a plan of this kind would be of inconceivable utility to our affairs; its benefits would be very speedily felt. It would give new life and energy to the operations of government. Business would be conducted with dispatch method and system. A million of abuses now existing would be corrected, and judicious plans would be formed and executed for the public good.  
Another step of immediate necessity is to recruit the army for the war, or at least for three years. This must be done by a mode similar to that which is practiced in Sweeden. There the inhabitants are thrown into classes of sixteen, and when the sovereign wants men each of these classes must furnish one. They raise a fixed sum of money, and if one of the class is willing to become a soldier, he receives the money and offers himself a volunteer; if none is found to do this, a draft is made and he on whom the lot falls receives the money and is obliged to serve. The minds of the people are prepared for a thing of this kind; the heavy bounties they have been obliged to pay for men to serve a few months must have disgusted them with this mode, and made them desirous of another, that will once for all answer the public purposes, and obviate a repetition of the demand. It ought by all means to be attempted, and Congress should frame a general plan and press the execution upon the states. When  the confederation comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this by a fundamental law, and hereafter there would be no doubt of the success. But we cannot now wait for this; we want to replace the men whose times of service will expire the 1st of January, for then, without this, we shall have no army remaining and the enemy may do what they please. The General in his letter already quoted has assigned the most substantial reasons for paying immediate attention to this point.  
Congress should endeavour, both upon their credit in Europe, and by every possible exertion in this country, to provide cloathing for their officers, and should abolish the whole system of state supplies. The making good the depreciation of the currency and all other compensations to the army should be immediately taken up by Congress, and not left to the states; if they would have the accounts of depreciation liquidated, and governmental certificates given for what is due in specie or an equivalent to specie, it would give satisfaction; appointing periodical settlements for future depreciation.  
The placing the officers upon half pay during life would be a great stroke of policy, and would give Congress a stronger tie upon them, than any thing else they can do. No man, that reflects a moment, but will prefer a permanent provision of this kind to any temporary compensation, nor is it opposed to economy; the difference between this and between what has been already done will be insignificant. The benefit of it to the widows should be confined to those whose husbands die during the war. As to the survivors, not more than one half on the usual calculation of mens lives will exceed the seven years for which the half pay is already established. Besides this whatever may be the visionary speculations of some men at this time, we shall find it indispensable after the war to keep on foot a considerable body of troops; and all the officers retained for this purpose must be deducted out of the half pay list. If any one will take the pains to calculate the expence on these principles, I am persuaded he will find the addition of expence from the establishment proposed, by no means a national object.  
The advantages of securing the attachment of the army to Congress, and binding them to the service by substantial ties are immense. We should then have discipline, an army in reality, as well as in name. Congress would then have a solid basis of authority and consequence, for to me it is an axiom that in our constitution an army is essential to the American union.  
The providing of supplies is the pivot of every thing else (though a well constituted army would not in a small degree conduce to this, by giving consistency and weight to government). There are four ways all which must be united—a foreign loan, heavy pecuniary taxes, a tax in kind, a bank founded on public and private credit.  
As to a foreign loan I dare say, Congress are doing every thing in their power to obtain it. The most effectual way will be to tell France that without it, we must make terms with great Britain. This must be done with plainness and firmness, but with respect and without petulance, not as a menace, but as a candid declaration of our circumstances. We need not fear to be deserted by France. Her interest and honor are too deeply involved in our fate; and she can make no possible compromise. She can assist us, if she is convinced it is absolutely necessary, either by lending us herself or by becoming our surety or by influencing Spain. It has been to me astonishing how any man could have doubted at any period of our affairs of the necessity of a foreign loan. It was self evident, that we had not a fund of wealth in this country, capable of affording revenues equal to the expences. We must then create artificial revenues, or borrow; the first was done, but it ought to have been foreseen, that the expedient could not last; and we should have provided in time for its failure.  
Here was an error of Congress. I have good reason to believe, that measures were not taken in earnest early enough, to procure a loan abroad. I give you my honor that from our first outset, I thought as I do now and wished for a foreign loan not only because I foresaw it would be essential but because I considered it as a tie upon the nation from which it was derived and as a mean to prop our cause in Europe.  
Concerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary taxes I need say nothing, as it is a point in which everybody is agreed; nor is there any danger, that the product of any taxes raised in this way will over burthen the people, or exceed the wants of the public. Indeed if all the paper in circulation were drawn annually into the treasury, it would neither do one, nor the other.  
  
As to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results from this principle—that the money in circulation is not a sufficient representative of the productions of the country, and consequently no revenues raised from it as a medium can be a competent representative of that part of the products of the country, which it is bound to contribute to the support of the public. The public therefore to obtain its due or satisfy its just demands and its wants must call for a part of those products the

mselves. This is done in all those countries which are not commercial, in Russia, Prussia, Denmark Sweden &amp;c. and is peculiarly necessary in our case.  
Congress in calling for specific supplies seem to have had this in view; but their intention has not been answered. The states in general have undertaken to furnish the supplies by purchase, a mode as I have observed, attended with every inconvenience and subverting the principle on which the supplies were demanded—the insufficiency of our circulating medium as a representative for the labour and commodities of the Country. It is therefore necessary that Congress should be more explicit, should form the outlines of a plan for a tax in kind, and recommend it to the states, as a measure of absolute necessity.  
The general idea I have of a plan, is that a respectable man should be appointed by the state in each county to collect the taxes and form magazines, that Congress should have in each state an officer to superintend the whole and that the state collectors should be subordinate and responsible to them. This Continental superintendent might be subject to the general direction of the Quarter Master General, or not, as might be deemed best; but if not subject to him, he should be obliged to make monthly returns to the President at War, who should instruct him what proportion to deliver to the Quarter Master General. It may be necessary that the superintendents should sometimes have power to dispose of the articles in their possession on public account; for it would happen that the contributions in places remote from the army could not be transported to the theatre of operations without too great expence, in which case it would be eligible to dispose of them and purchase with the money so raised in the countries near the immediate scene of war.  
I know the objections which may be raised to this plan—its tendency to discourage industry and the like; but necessity calls for it; we cannot proceed without [it], and less evils must give place to greater. It is besides practiced with success in other countries, and why not in this? It may be said, the examples cited are from nations under despotic governments and that the same would not be practicable with us; but I contend where the public good is evidently the object more may be effected in governments like ours than in any other. It has been a constant remark that free countries have ever paid the heaviest taxes. The obedience of a free people to general laws however hard they bear is ever more perfect than that of slaves to the arbitrary will of a prince. To this it may be added that Sweden was always a free government, and is so now in a great degree, notwithstanding the late revolution.  
How far it may be practicable to erect a bank on the joint credit of the public and of individuals can only be certainly determined by the experiment; but it is of so much importance that the experiment ought to be fully tried. When I saw the subscriptions going on to the bank established for supplying the army, I was in hopes it was only the embryo of a more permanent and extensive establishment. But I have reason to believe I shall be disappointed. It does not seem to be at all conducted on the true principles of a bank. The directors of it are purchasing with their stock instead of bank notes as I expected; in consequence of which it must turn out to be a mere subscription of a particular sum of money for a particular purpose.  
Paper credit never was long supported in any country, on a national scale, where it was not founded on the joint basis of public and private credit. An attempt to establish it on public credit alone in France under the auspices of Mr. Law had nearly ruined the kingdom; we have seen the effects of it in America, and every successive experiment proves the futility of the attempt. Our new money is depreciating almost as fast as the old, though it has in some states as real funds as paper money ever had. The reason is, that the monied men have not an immediate interest to uphold its credit. They may even in many ways find it their interest to undermine it. The only certain manner to obtain a permanent paper credit is to engage the monied interest immediately in it by making them contribute the whole or part of the stock and giving them the whole or part of the profits.  
The invention of banks on the modern principle originated in Venice. There the public and a company of monied men are mutually concerned. The Bank of England unites public authority and faith with private credit; and hence we see what a vast fabric of paper credit is raised on a visionary basis. Had it not been for this, England would never have found sufficient funds to carry on her wars; but with the help of this she has done, and is doing wonders. The bank of Amsterdam is on a similar foundation.  
And why can we not have an American bank? Are our monied men less enlightened to their own interest or less enterprising in the persuit? I believe the fault is in our government which does not exert itself to engage them in such a scheme. It is true, the individuals in America are not very rich, but this would not prevent their instituting a bank; it would only prevent its being done with such ample funds as in other countries. Have they not sufficient confidence in the government and in the issue of the cause? Let the Government endeavour to inspire that confidence, by adopting the measures I have recommended or others equivalent to them. Let it exert itself to procure a solid confederation, to establish a good plan of executive administration, to form a permanent military force, to obtain at all events a foreign loan. If these things were in a train of vigorous execution, it would give a new spring to our affairs; government would recover its respectability and individuals would renounce their diffidence.  
The object I should propose to myself in the first instance from a bank would be an auxiliary mode of supplies; for which purpose contracts should be made between Government and the bank on terms liberal and advantageous to the latter. Every thing should be done in the first instance to encourage the bank; after it gets well established it will take care of itself and government may make the best terms it can for itself.  
The first step to establishing the bank will be to engage a number of monied men of influence to relish the project and make it a business. The subscribers to that lately established are the fittest persons that can be found; and their plan may be interwoven.  
The outlines of my plan would be to open subscriptions in all the states for the stock, which we will suppose to be one million of pounds. Real property of every kind, as well as specie should be deemed good stock, but at least a fourth part of the subscription should be in specie or plate. There should be one great company in three divisions in Virginia, Philadelphia, and at Boston or two at Philadelphia and Boston. The bank should have a right to issue bank notes bearing two per Cent interest for the whole of their stock; but not to exceed it. These notes may be payable every three months or oftener, and the faith of government must be pledged for the support of the bank. It must therefore have a right from time to time to inspect its operations, and must appoint inspectors for the purpose.  
The advantages of the bank may consist in this, in the profits of the contracts made with government, which should bear interest to be annually paid in specie, in the loan of money at interest say six per Cent, in purchasing lives by annuities as practiced in England &amp;c. The benefit resulting to the company is evident from the consideration, that they may employ in circulation a great deal more money than they have specie in stock, on the credit of the real property which they will have in other use; this money will be employed either in fulfilling their contracts with the public by which also they will gain a profit, or in loans at an advantageous interest or in annuities.  
The bank may be allowed to purchase plate and bullion and coin money allowing government a part of the profit. I make the bank notes bear interest to obtain a readie currency and to induce the holders to prefer them to specie to prevent too great a run upon the bank at any time beyond its ability to pay.  
If Government can obtain a foreign loan it should lend to the bank on easy terms to extend its influence and facilitate a compliance with its engagements. If government could engage the states to raise a sum of money in specie to be deposited in bank in the same manner, it would be of the greatest consequence. If government could prevail on the enthusiasm of the people to make a contribution in plate for the same purpose it would be a master stroke. Things of this kind sometimes succeed in popular contests; and if undertaken with address; I should not despair of its success; but I should not be sanguine.  
The bank may be instituted for a term of years by way of trial and the particular privilege of coining money be for a term still shorter. A temporary transfer of it to a particular company can have no inconvenience as the government are in no condition to improve this resource nor could it in our circumstances be an object to them, though with the industry of a knot of individuals it might be.  
A bank of this kind even in its commencement would answer the most valuable purposes to government and to the proprietors; in its progress the advantages will exceed calculation. It will promote commerce by furnishing a more extensive medium which we greatly want in our circumstances. I mean a more extensive valuable medium. We have an enormous nominal one at this time; but it is only a name.  
In the present unsettled state of things in this country, we can hardly draw inferences from what has happened in others, otherwise I should be certain of the success of this scheme; but I think it has enough in its favour to be worthy of trial.  
I have only skimmed the surface of the different subjects I have introduced. Should the plans recommended come into contemplation in earnest and you desire my further thoughts, I will endeavour to give them more form and particularity. I am persuaded a solid confederation a permanent army a reasonable prospect of subsisting it would give us treble consideration in Europe and produce a peace this winter.  
If a Convention is called the minds of all the states and the people ought to be prepared to receive its determinations by sensible and popular writings, which should conform to the views of Congress. There are epochs in human affairs, when novelty even is useful. If a general opinion prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or false, and this obstructs or relaxes the operation of the public service, a change is necessary if it be but for the sake of change. This is exactly the case now. ’Tis an universal sentiment that our present system is a bad one, and that things do not go right on this account. The measure of a Convention would revive the hopes of the people and give a new direction to their passions, which may be improved in carrying points of substantial utility. The Eastern states have already pointed out this mode to Congress; they ought to take the hint and anticipate the others.  
And, in future, My Dear Sir, two things let me recommend, as fundamental rules for the conduct of Congress—to attach the army to them by every motive, to maintain an air of authority (not domineering) in all their measures with the states. The manner in which a thing is done has more influence than is commonly imagined. Men are governed by opinion; this opinion is as much influenced by appearances as by realities; if a Government appears to be confident of its own powers, it is the surest way to inspire the same confidence in others; if it is diffident, it may be certain, there will be a still greater diffidence in others, and that its authority will not only be distrusted, controverted, but contemned.  
I wish too Congress would always consider that a kindness consists as much in the manner as in the thing: the best things done hesitatingly and with an ill grace lose their effect, and produce disgust rather than satisfaction or gratitude. In what Congress have at any time done for the army, they have commonly been too late: They have seemed to yield to importunity rather than to sentiments of justice or to a regard to the accomodation of their troops. An attention to this idea is of more importance than it may be thought. I who have seen all the workings and progress of the present discontents, am convinced, that a want of this has not been among the most inconsiderable causes.  
You will perceive My Dear Sir this letter is hastily written and with a confidential freedom, not as to a member of Congress, whose feelings may be sore at the prevailing clamours; but as to a friend who is in a situation to remedy public disorders, who wishes for nothing so much as truth, and who is desirous of information, even from those less capable of judging than himself. I have not even time to correct and copy and only enough to add that I am very truly and affectionately D Sir   Your most Obed ser

“‘ Liberty Pole, 1780.  
  
‘* Dear Sir,—Agreeable to your request, and my promise, I sit down to  
give you my ideas of the defects of our present system, and the changes  
necessary to save us from ruin. They may, perhaps, be the reveries of a  
projector, rather than the sober views of a politician. You will judge of  
them, and make what use you please of them.  
  
‘The fundamental defect is a want of power in congress. It is hardly  
worth while to show in what this consists, as it seems to be universally  
acknowledged; or to point out how it has happened, as the only ques-  
tion is how to remedy it. It may, however, be said, that it has originated  
from three causes,—an excess of the spirit of liberty, which has made the  
particular states show a jealousy of all power not in their own hands;  
and this jealousy has led them to exercise a right of judging, in the last  
resort, of the measures recommended by congress, and of acting according to  
their own opinions of their propriety or necessity ;—a diffidence in congress  
of their own powers, by which they have been timid and indecisive in  
their resolutions; constantly making concessions to the states, till they  
have scarcely left themselves the shadow of power ;—a waut of sufficient  
means at their disposal to answer the public exigencies, and of vigour to  
draw forth those means, which have occasioned them to depend on the  
states, individually, to fulfil their engagements with the army; the conse-  
quence of which has been to ruin their influence and credit with the army,  
to establish its dependence on each state, separately, rather than on  
them; that is, than on the whole collectively.  
  
‘It may be pleaded that congress had never any definitive powers  
granted them, and of course could exercise none,—could do nothing more  
than recommend. The manner in which congress was appointed would

warrant, and the public good required, that they should have considered  
themselves as vested with full power to preserve the republic from harm.  
  
‘They have done man of the highest acts of sovereignty, which were  
always cheerfully submitted to; the declaration of independence, the  
declaration of ‘war, the levying an army, creating a navy, emitting money,  
making alliances with foreign powers, appointing a dictator, &amp;. &amp;c. ; all  
these were implications of a complete sovereignty, were never disputed,  
and ought to have been a standard for the whole conduct of administra-  
tion. Undefined powers are discretionary powers, limited only by the  
object for which they were given; in the present case, the independence  
and freedom of America. ‘The confederation made no difference ; for as it  
has not been generally adopted, it had no operation.  
  
‘But, from what 1 recollect of it, congress have even descended from  
the authority which the spirit of that act gives them; while the particular  
states have no farther attended to it, than as it suited their pretensions and  
convenience. It would take too much time to enter into particular in-  
stances; each of which, separately, might appear inconsiderable, but  
united are of serious import. I only mean to remark, not to censure.  
  
*‘ But the confederation itself is defective, and requires to be altered ; it  
is neither fit for war, nor peace. The idea of an uncontrollable sover-  
eignty in each state, over its internal police, will defeat the other powers  
  
iven to congress, and make our union feeble and precarious. ‘There are  
instances, without number, where acts necessary for the general good, and  
which rise out of the powers given to congress, must interfere with the  
internal police of the states; and there are as many instances in which the  
  
articular states, by arrangements of internal police, can effectually, though  
indirectly, counteract the arrangements of congress. You have already  
had examples of this, for which I refer you to your own memory.  
  
“The confederation gives the states, individually, too much influence in  
the affairs of the army; they should have nothing to do with it.  
  
‘“‘ The entire formation and disposal of our military forees ought to be-  
long to congress. It is an essential cement of the union; and it ought to  
be the policy of congress to destroy all ideas of state attachments in the  
army, and make it look up wholly to them. For this purpose, all appoint-  
ments, promotions, and provisions whatsoever, ought to be made by them.  
It may be apprehended, that this may be dangerous to liberty. But no-  
thing appears more evident to me, than that we run much greater risk of  
having a weak and disunited federal government, than one which will be  
able to usurp upon the rights of the people.  
  
“ Already some of the lines of the army would obey their states in op-  
position to congress, notwithstanding the pains we have taken to preserve  
the = of the army. If any thing would hinder this, it would be the  
personal influence of the General—a melancholy and mortifying consider-  
ation. The forms of our state constitutions must always give them great  
weight in our affairs, and will make it too difficult to blind them in the  
egg of acommon interest, too easy to oppose whatever they do not  
  
ike, and to form partial combinations, subversive of the general one.  
  
There is a wide difference between our situation and that of an empire  
under one simple form of government, distributed into counties, provinces  
or districts, which have no legislatures, but merely magistratical bodies to  
execute the laws of acommon sovereign. Here the danger is, that the  
sovereign will have too much power, and oppress the parts of which it is  
composed. In our case, that of an empire composed of confederative states,  
each with a government completely organized within itself, having all the  
means to draw its subjects to a close Siecnieape on itself, the danger is  
directly the reverse. It is, that the common sovereign will not have power  
sufficient to unite the different members together, and direct the common  
forces to the interest and happiness of the whole.

“The leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof of this.  
They were continually at war with each other, and for want of union fell  
a prey to their neighbours. They frequently held general councils, but  
their resolutions were ro farther observed, than as they suited the inter-  
ests and inclinations of all the parties, and, at length, they sunk entirely  
into contempt.  
  
‘‘ The Swiss cantons are another proof of the doctrine. They have had  
wars with each other, which would have been fatal to them, had not the  
different — in their neighbourhood been too jealous of one another, and  
too equally matched to suffer either to take advantage of their quarrels.  
That they have remained so long united at all, is to be attributed to their weak-  
ness, to their poverty, and to the cause just mentioned. ‘These ties will  
not exist in America. A little time hence, some of the states will be  
— empires; and we are so remote from other nations, that we shall  
  
ave all the leisure and opportunity we can wish to cut each other’s  
throats.  
  
‘“‘The Germanic corps might also be cited as an example in favour of  
the position.  
  
‘‘ The United Provinces may be thought to be one against it. But the  
family of the Stadtholders, whose authority is interwoven with the whole  
government, has been a strong link of union between them. Their phy-  
sical necessities, and the habits founded upon them, have contributed to it.  
Each province is too inconsiderable by itself to undertake any thing, An  
analysis of their present constitution would show, that they have many  
ties which would not exist in ours; and that they are by no means a  
proper model for us.  
  
** Onr own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the difficulty of  
drawing out the resources of the country, and inducing the states to com-  
bine in equal exertions for the common cause. ‘The ill success of our last  
attempt is striking. Some have donea — deal; others little, or searcely  
any thing. The disputes about boundaries, &amp;c. testify how flattering a  
prospect we have of future tranquillity, if we do not frame in time a con-  
federacy capable of deciding the differences, and compelling the obedience  
of the respective members.  
  
‘* The confederation, too, gives the power of the purse too entirely to  
the state legislatures. It should provide perpetual funds in the disposal  
of congress, by a land tax, poll tax, or the like. All imposts upon com-  
merce ought to be laid by congress, and appropriated to their use; for  
without certain revenues, a government can have no power; that power  
which holds the purse-strings absolutely, must rule. This seems to be a  
medium, which, without making congress altogether independent, will  
tend to give reality to its authority.  
  
“Another defect in our system is, want of method and energy in the  
administration. ‘This has partly resulted from the other defect; but ina  
great degree from prejudice and the want of a proper executive. Congress  
have kept the power too much in their own hands, and have meddled too  
much with details of every sort. Congress is properly a deliberative  
corps, and it forgets itself when it attempts to play the executive. It is  
impossible that a body, numerous as it is, constantly fluctuating, can ever  
act with sufficient decision, or with system. ‘T&#x27;wo-thirds of the members,  
one half the time, cannot know what has gone before them, or what con-  
nexion the subject in hand has to what has been transacted on former occa-  
sions. The members who have been more permanent, will only give  
information that promotes the side they espouse, in the present case, and  
  
_ will as often mislead as enlighten. The variety of business must dis-  
  
tract, and the proneness of every assembly to debate, must at all times  
delay.

*‘ Lately, congress, convinced of these inconveniencies, have gone into  
the measure of appointing boards. But this is, in my opinion, a bad plan.  
A single man, in each department of the administration, would be greatly  
preferable. It would give us a chance of more knowledge, more activity,  
more responsibility, and, of course, more zeal and attention. Boards par-  
take of a part of the inconveniences of larger assemblies ;—their decisions  
are slower, their energy less, their responsibility more diffused. They  
will not have the same abilities and knowledge as an administration by  
single men. Men of the first pretensions will not so readily engage in  
them, because they will be less conspicuous, of less importance, have less  
opportunity of distinguishing themselves. The members of boards will  
take less pains to inform themselves and arrive at eminence, because they  
have fewer motives to do it. All these reasons conspire to give a prefer-  
ence to the plan of vesting the great executive departments of the state in  
the hands of individuals. As these men will be, of course, at all times  
under the direction of congress, we shall blend the advantages of a mon-  
archy and republic in one constitution.  
  
‘¢ A question has been made, whether single men could be found to un-  
dertake these offices. I think they could; because there would be then  
every thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But in order to this,  
congress, by their manner of appointing them, and the line of duty marked  
out, must show that they are in earnest in making these offices, offices of  
real trust and importance.  
  
“] fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrangements, as  
though they would lessen the importance of congress, and leave them  
nothing todo. But they would have precisely the same rights and pow-  
ers as Deictofore, happily disencumbered of the detail. ‘They would have  
to inspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their plans, origi-  
nate others for the public good,—only observing this rule, that they ought  
to consult their ministers, and get all the information and advice they  
could from them, before they entered into any new measures, or make  
changes in the old.”

“TI shall now propose the remedies which appear to me applicable to  
our circumstances, and necessary to extricate our affairs from their present  
deplorable condition.  
  
*‘ The first step must be to give congress powers competent to the public  
exigencies. ‘This may happen in two ways: one by resuming and exer-  
cising the discretionary powers I suppose to have been originally vested in  
them for the safety of the states, and resting their conduct on the candour  
of their countrymen and the necessity of the conjuncture; the other, by  
calling immediately a convention of all the states, with full authority to  
conclude finally upon a general confederation, stating to them beforehand  
explicitly the evils arising from a want of power in congress, and the im-  
possibility of supporting the contest on its present footing, that the dele-  
gates may come possessed of proper sentiments, as well as proper authority,  
to give efficacy to the meeting. ‘Their commission should include a right  
of vesting esa $8 with the whole or a proportion of the unoccupied lands,  
to be employed for the purpose of raising a revenue, reserving the jurisdic-  
tion to the states by whom they are granted.  
  
“The first plan, I expect, will be thought too bold an expedient by the  
generality of congress; and, indeed, their practice hitherto has so rivetted  
the opinion of their want of power, that the success of this experiment may  
very well be doubted.

with the reasons for it. The convention should assemble the first of No-  
vember next; the sooner the better; our disorders are too violent to admit  
of a common or lingering remedy. The reasons for which I require them  
to be vested with plenipotentiary authority are, that the business may  
suffer no delay in the execution, and may in reality come to effect. A  
convention may agree upon a confederation; the states, individually, hardly  
ever will. We must have one, at all events, and a vigorous one, if we  
mean to succeed in the contest and be happy hereafter. As I said before,  
to engage the states to comply with this mode, congress ought to confess  
to them, plainly and unanimously, the impracticability of supporting our  
affairs on the present footing, and without a solid coercive union. I ask  
that the convention should have a power of vesting the whole or a part of  
the unoccupied lands in congress, because it is necessary that body should  
have some property, as a fund for the arrangements of finance; and I know  
of no other kind that can be given them.  
  
“The confederation, in my opinion, should give congress a complete  
sovereignty ; except as to that part of internal police which relates to the  
rights of property and life among individuals, and to raising money by  
internal taxes. It is necessary that every thing belonging to this should  
be regulated by the state legislatures. Congress should have complete  
sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace, trade, finance; and to the  
management of foreign affairs; the right of declaring war, of raising armies,  
officering, paying them, directing their motions in every respect ; of equip-  
ping fleets, and doing the same with them; of building fortifications, arse-  
nals, magazines, &amp;c. &amp;c.; of making peace on such conditions as the  
think proper; of regulating trade, determining with what countries it shall  
be carried on; granting indulgences ; laying prohibitions on all the articles  
of export or import; imposing duties, granting bounties and premiums for  
raising, exporting, or importing; and applying to their own use the product  
of these duties, only giving credit to the states on whom they are raised  
in the general account of revenues and expense; instituting admiralty  
courts, &amp;c.; of coining money, establishing banks on such terms, and with  
such privileges, as they think proper; appropriating funds, and doing  
whatever else relates to the operations of finance; transacting every thing  
with foreign nations; making alliances, offensive and defensive, treaties of  
commerce, &amp;c. &amp;c.  
  
‘The confederation should provide certain perpetual revenues, product-  
ive and easy of collection; a land tax, poll tax, or the like, which, together  
with the duties on trade, and the unlocated lands, would give congress a  
substantial existence, and a stable foundation for their schemes of finance.  
What more supplies were necessary, should be occasionally demanded of  
the states, in the present mode of quotas.  
  
“The second step I would recommend is, that congress should instantly  
appoint the following —_ officers of state: A Secretary for Foreign  
Affairs; a President of War; a President of Marine; a Financier; a Pre-  
sident of Trade; instead of this last, a Board of Trade may be preferable,  
as the regulations of trade are slow and guarded, and require prudence and  
&gt; le (more than other euititlen } for which boards are very well  
adapted.  
  
ry Congress should choose for these offices, men of the first abilities,  
property, and character, in the continent; and such as have had the best  
Fa ey of being acquainted with the several branches. General  
Schuyler, whom you mentioned, would make an excellent President of  
War; General M’Dougal a very good President of Marine; Mr. Robert  
Morris would have many things in his favour for the department of finance.  
He could, by his own personal influence, give great weight to the measures

he should adopt. I dare say, men equally capable may be found for the  
  
other departments.  
  
‘¢] know not if it would not be a good plan to let the Financier be Pre-  
sident of the Board of Trade; but he should only have a casting voice in  
determining questions there. There is a connexion between trade and  
finance, which ought to make the director of one acquainted with the other;  
but the financier should not direct the affairs of fam because, for the sake  
of acquiring reputation by increasing the revenues, he might adopt measures  
that would depress trade. In what relates to finance he should be alone.  
  
“These officers should have nearly the same powers and functions as  
those in France analogous to them, and each esl be chief in his depart-  
ment, with subordinate boards, composed of assistants, clerks, &amp;c., to  
execute his orders.  
  
“In my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of inconceivable utility to  
our affairs; its benefits would be very speedily felt. It would give new  
life and energy to the operations of government. Business would be con-  
ducted with despatch, method, and system. A million of abuses now  
existing would be corrected, and judicious plans would be formed and  
executed for the public good.”  
  
It is hardly possible at the present day to appreciate the  
entire merit of the plans of Hamilton. His views are to man

was going on--when the country was in great  
distrese- when no government whatever could  
have afforded full relief--when the feelings of the  
officers and soldiers of the army were exasperated

they attributed to the neglect or imbecility of the

says, in that letter:- &quot;Without a speedy change,

without provisions, without morals, without dis-­

excites united resistance to, and the overthrow  
of, those who attempt the usurpation. Every fede.­  
ral or whig administration hitherto in power, have  
exhibited a proneness to practice upon the doctrises  
advanced by General Hamilton, and they have all  
met the rebuke of the States and of the people. It  
is curious to note the process by which such usur

example is given in the hirst part of General Hamil­

The manner in which Congress was appointed, would  
worrant, and the public required, that they should have  
considered themselves as vested with full power to pre.­  
serve the republic from harm. They have done many  
of the highest acts of sovereignty, which were always  
cheerfully submitted to. The declaration of indepen-­  
dence; the declaration of war; the levying an army;  
creating a navy; emitting money; making alliances  
with pforeign powers; appointing a dictator, &amp;c. &amp;c;  
all these implications of a complete sovereignty were  
never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for  
the whole conduct of administration. Undefined powr­  
ers are discretionary powers, limited only by the obe­  
ject for which they were given.

one at all events, and a vigorous one, if we mean to  
succeed in the contest, and be happy hereafter. As I  
said before, to engage the States to comply with this  
mode, Congress ought to confess to them, plainly and  
unanimously, the impracticability of supporting our  
affairs on the present footing, and without a solid coer  
cive union.  
The editorial of the Enguirer States, further,  
that  
Every grant of power, almost without a solltary ex.­  
ception which Hamilton urged should be made by the  
States to the new Government, was made; and that,  
too, in a manner which clearly proves, who it was that  
controlled the convention- whose genius and whose  
spirit it was which led the minds of that assemblage  
of patriots, to the adoption of those admirable provi­  
siens which have rendered us a happy and prosperous  
people, as well as a great and powerful nation.

Dear Sir :—Agreeable to your request and my  
promise, I sit down to give you my ideas of the  
defects of our present system, and the changes  
necessary to save us from ruin. They may,  
perhaps, be the reveries of a projector, rather than  
the sober views of a politician. You will judge of  
them, and make what use you please of them.  
  
The fundamental defect is a want of power in  
Congress. It is hardly worth while to show in  
what this consists, as it seems to be universally  
acknowledged ; or to point out how it has happened,  
as the only question is how to remedy it. It may,  
however, be said that it has originated from three  
causes: an excess of the spirit of liberty, which  
has made the particular States show a jealousy of  
all power not in their own hands, and this jealousy  
has led them to exercise a right of judging in the  
last resort of the measures recommended by Con-  
gress, and of acting according to their own opinions  
of their propriety or necessity; a diffidence, in  
Congress, of their own powers, by which they have  
been timid and indecisive in their resolutions, con-  
stantly making concessions to the States, till they  
have scarcely left themselves the shadow of power ;  
a want of sufficient means at their disposal to an-  
swer the public exigencies, and of vigor to draw  
furth those ineans, which have occasioned them to  
depend on the States individually, to fulfil their  
engagements with the army—the consequences of  
which have been to ruin their influence and credit  
with the army, to establish its dependence on each  
State separately, rather than on ‘hem, that is, rather  
than on the whole collectively.  
  
It may be pleaded that Congress had never any  
definitive powers granted them, and, of course,  
could exercise none, could do nothing more than  
recommend. The manner in which Congress was  
appointed would warrant, and the public good  
required, that they should have considered them-  
selvesas vested with full power to preserve the republic  
Srom harm. They have done many of the highest  
acts of sovereignty, which were always cheerfully  
submitted to. The declaration of independence ;  
the declaration of war; the levying an army ;  
creating a navy ; emitting money ; making alliances  
with foreign powers; appointing a dictator, &amp;c.,

inconsiderable, but united are of serious import.  
= mean to remark, not to censure.  
  
ut the Confederation itself is defective and re-  
quires to be altered. It is neither fit for war nor  
peace. The idea of an uncontrollable sovereignty  
in each State, over its internal police, will defeat  
the other powers given to Congress, and make our  
Union feeble and precarious. There are instances  
without number, where acts necessary for the gen-  
eral good, and which rise out of the powers given  
to Congress, must interfere with the internal police  
of the States ; and there are as many instances in  
which the particular States, by arrangements of  
internal police, can effectually, though indirectly,  
counteract the arrangements of Congress. You  
have already had examples of this, for which I refer  
you to your own memory.  
  
The Confederation gives the States, individually,  
too much influence in the affairs of the army.  
They should have nothing to do with it.  
entire formation and disposal of our military forces  
ought to belong to Congress. It is an essential  
cement of the Union ; and it ought to be the policy  
of Congress to destroy all ideas of state attachments  
in the army, and make it look up wholly to them.  
For this purpose all appointments, promotions, and  
provisions whatsoever, ought to be made by them.  
It may be apprehended that this may be dangerous  
to liberty; but nothing appears more evident to  
me than that we run much greater risk of having  
a weak and disunited federal government, than one  
which will be able to usurp upon the rights of the  
people. Already sume of the lines of the army  
would obey their States in opposition to Congress,  
notwithstanding the pains we have taken to pre-  
serve the unity of the army. If anything would  
hinder this, it would be the personal influence of  
the general ; a melancholy and mortifying consid-  
eration.  
  
The forms of our State constitutions must always  
give them great weight in our affairs, and will  
make it too difficult to bend them to the pursuit of  
a@ common interest; too easy to oppose whatever  
they do not like, and to furm partial combinations  
subversive of the general one. There is a wide  
difference between our situation and that of an  
empire under one simple form of government, dis-  
tributed into counties, provinces, or districts, which  
have no legislature, but merely magistratical bodies,  
to execute the laws of a common sovereign. Here  
the danger is that the sovereign will have too  
much power, and oppress the parts of which it is  
composed. In our case—that of an empire composed  
of confederated states, each with a government

powers in their neighborhood been too jealous of one  
  
1 | another, and too equally matched to suffer either to  
  
take advantage of their quarrels. ‘That they have  
remained so long united at all is to be attributed to  
their weakness, to their poverty, and to the cause  
just mentioned. These ties will not exist in  
America; a little time hence, some of the States  
will be powerful empires; and we are so remote  
from other nations that we shall have all the leisure  
and opportunity we can wish to cut each other’s  
throats.  
  
The Germanic Corps might also be cited as an  
example in favor of the position.  
  
The United Provinces may be thought to be one  
against it. But the family of the Stadtholders,  
whose authority is interwoven with the whole gov-  
ernment, has been a strong link of union between  
them. Their physical necessities, and the habits  
founded upon them, have contributed to it. Each  
province is too inconsiderable, by itself, to under-  
take anything. An analysis of their present con-  
stitutions would show that they have many ties  
which would not exist in ours; and that they are  
by no means a model for us.  
  
Our own experience should satisfy us. We have  
felt the difficulty of drawing out the resources of the  
country, and inducing the States to combine in equal  
exertions for the common cause. ‘The ill-success of  
our late attempt is striking. Some have done a  
great deal ; others little, or scarcely anything. The  
disputes about boundaries, &amp;c., testify how flatter-  
ing a prospect we have of future tranquillity, if we  
do not frame, in time, a confederacy capable of de-  
ciding the differences, and compelling the obedience  
of the respective members.  
  
The Confederation, too, gives the power of the  
purse too entirely to the State legislatures. It  
should provide perpetual funds, in the disposal of  
Congress, by a land tax, poll tax, or the like. All  
imposts upon commerce ought to be laid by Con-  
gress, and appropriated to their use ; for without  
certain revenues a government can have no power.  
That power which holds the purse-strings abso-  
lutely, must rule. This seems to be a medium,  
which, without making Congress altogether inde-  
pendent, will tend to give reality to its authority.  
  
Another defect in our system is want of method  
and energy in the administration. This has partly  
resulted from the other defect ; butin a great degree  
from prejudice, and the want of a proper executive.  
Congress have kept the power too much in their  
own hands, and have meddled too much with details  
of every sort. Congress is, properly, a deliberative  
corps ; and it forgets itself when it attempts to play  
the executive. It is impossible such a body, nun-  
  
completely organized within itself, having all the , merous as it is, constantly fluctuating, can ever act  
  
means to draw its subjects to a close dependence | with sufficient decision, or with system.  
  
on itself-—the danger is directly the reverse.

But this is in my opinion a bad plan. A  
single man, in each department of the administra-  
It would give us  
  
trine. They have had wars with each other, which }a chance of more knowledge, more activity, moro re

sponsibility, and of course more zeal and attention.  
  
oards partake of a part of the inconveniences of  
larger assemblies. Their decisions are slower,  
their energy less, their responsibility more diffused.  
They will not have the same abilities and knowl-  
edge as an administration by single men. Men of  
the first pretensions will not so readily engage in  
them ; because they will be less conspicuous, of  
Jess importance, have less opportunity of distin-  
guishing themselves. ‘The members of boards will  
take less pains to inform themselves and arrive to  
eminence, because they have fewer motives to do it.  
All these reasons conspire to give a preference to  
the plan of vesting the great executive department  
of the State in the hands of individuals. As these  
men will be, of course, at all times under the direc-  
tion of Congress, we shall blend the advantages of  
a monarchy and republic in our constitution.  
  
A question has been made whether single men  
could be found to undertake these offices. I think  
they could ; because there would be then every-  
thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But in  
order to this, Congress, by their manner of appoint-  
ing them, and the line of duty marked out, must  
show that they are in earnest in making these  
officers of real trust and importance.  
  
I fear a little vanity has stood in the way of  
these arrangeinents, as though they would lessen  
the importance of Congress, and leave them noth-  
ing to do. But they would have precisely the  
same rights and powers as heretofore ; happily  
disencumbered of the detail. They would have to  
inspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate  
upon their plans, originate others for the public  
good, only observing this rule—that they ought to  
consult their ministers, and get all the information  
and advice they could from them, before they en-  
tered into any new measures, or made changes in  
the old.  
  
A third defect is the fluctuating constitution of  
ourarmy. This has been a pregnant source of evil ;  
all our military misfortunes—three fourths of our  
civil embarrassments—are to be ascribed to it.  
The General has so fully enumerated the mischiefs  
of it in a late letter of the , to Congress,  
that I could only repeat what he has said, and will,  
therefore, refer you to that letter.  
  
The imperfect and unequal provision made for  
the army isa fourth defect, which you will find  
delineated in the same letter. Without a speedy  
change the army must dissolve. It is now a mob,  
rather than an army ; without clothing, without pay,  
without provisions, without morals, without dis-  
cipline. We begin to hate the country for its  
neglect of us—the country begin to hate us for our  
oppressions of them. Congress have Jong been  
jealous of us. We have now lost all confidence  
in them, and give the worst construction to all they  
do. Held together by the slenderest ties, we are  
ripening for a dissolution.  
  
The present mode of supplying the army by  
State purchases is not one of the least considerable  
defects of our system. It is too precarious a depend-  
ence ; because the States will never be sufficiently  
impressed with our necessities. Each will make its  
own case a primary object. The variety of chan-  
nels through which the business is transacted will  
multiply the number of persons employed, and the  
opportunities of embezzling public money. From  
the popular spirit on which most of the govern-  
ments turn, the State agents will be men of less  
character and ability ; nor will there be so rigid a  
responsibility among them, as there might easily

be among those in the employ of the continent ? of  
course, not so much diligence, care, or economy.  
Very little of the money raised in the several  
States will go into the continental treasury, on  
pretence that it is all exhausted in providing the  
quotas of supplies ; and the public will be without  
funds for the other demands of government. The  
expense will be ultimately much greater, and the  
advantages much smaller. We actually feel the  
insufficiency of this plan ; and have reason to dread,  
under it, a ruinous extremity of want.  
  
These are the principal defects in the present  
system that now occur to me. ‘There are many  
inferior ones, in the organization of particular de-  
partments, and many errors of administration,  
which might be pointed out; but the task would  
be troublesome and tedious; and if we had once  
remedied those I have mentioned, the others would  
not be attended with much difficulty. I shall now  
propose the remedies which appear to me appli-  
cable to our circumstances, and necessary to extri-  
cate our affairs from their present deplorable situ-  
ation.  
  
The first step must be to give Congress powers  
competent to the public exigencies. This may  
happen in two ways: one, by resuming and exer-  
cising the discretionary powers I suppose to have  
been originally vested in them, for the safety of the  
States, and resting their conduct on the candor of  
their countrymen, and the necessity of the conjunc-  
ture; the other, by calling immediately a conven-  
tion of all the States, with full authority to conclude  
finally upon a general confederation—stating to  
them, beforehand, explicitly, the evils arising from  
a want of power in Congress, and the impossibility  
of supporting the contest on its present footing, that  
the delegates may come, possessed of proper senti-  
ments, as well as proper authority, to give efficacy  
to the meeting. Their commission should include a  
right of vesting Congress with the whole, or a  
proportion, of the unoccupied lands, to be employed  
for the purpose of raising a revenue—reserving  
the jurisdiction to the States by whom they are  
granted.  
  
The first plan, I expect, will be thought too  
bold an expedient by the generality of Congress ;  
and, indeed, their practice hitherto has so riveted  
the opinion of their want of powers, that the suc-  
cess of this experiment may very well be doubted.  
  
I see no objection to the other mode that has any  
weight in competition with the reasons for it. The  
convention should assemble the Ist of November  
next; the sooner the better. Our disorders are too  
violent to admit of a common or lingering remedy.  
The reasons for which I require them to be vested  
with plenipotentiary authority are that the busi-  
ness may suffer no delay in the execution, and may  
in reality come to effect. A convention may agree  
upon a confederation ; the States, individually,  
hardly ever will. We must have one, at all events,  
and a vigorous one, if we mean to succeed in the  
contest, and be happy hereafter. As I said before,  
to engage the States to comply with this mode,  
Congress ought to confess to them, plainly and  
unanimously, the impracticability of supporting  
our affairs on the present footing, and without a  
solid coercive union. I ask that the convention  
should have a power of vesting the whole, or a part,  
of the unoccupied lands in Congress ; because it is  
necessary that that body should have some property  
as a fund for the arrangements of finance; and I  
know of no other kind that can be given them.  
  
The Confederation, in my opinion, should give  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
THE CONCEPTION OF  
Congress complete sovereignty, except as to that  
part of internal police, which relates to the rights  
of property and life among individuals, and to  
raising money by internal taxes. It is necessary  
that everything belonging to this should be regu-  
lated by the State legislatures. Congress should  
have complete sovereignty in all that relates to  
war, peace, trade, finance, and to the management of  
foreign affairs, the right of declaring war, of rais-  
ing armies, officering them, paying them, directing  
their motions in every respect—of equipping fleets  
and doing the same with them, of building fortifica-  
tions, arsenals, magazines, &amp;c., &amp;c.—of making  
peace on such conditions as they think proper—of  
regulating trade, determining with what countries it  
shall be carried on—granting indulgencies, laying  
prohibitions on all the articles of export or import  
—imposing duties, granting bounties and premiums  
for raising, exporting or importing, and applying to  
their own use the product of these duties, only  
giving credit to the States on whom they are raised,  
in the general account of revenues and expenses  
—instituting admiralty courts, &amp;c.—of coining  
money—establishing banks on such terms and  
with such privileges as they think proper—appro-  
priating funds, and doing whatever else relates to  
the operations of finance—transacting everything  
with foreign nations—making alliances, offensive  
and defensive, treaties of commerce, &amp;c., &amp;c.  
  
The Confederation should provide certain perpet-  
ual revenues, productive, and easy of collection—  
a land tax, poll tax, or the like—which, together  
with the duties on trade, and the unlocated lands,  
would give Congress a substantial existence, and  
a stable foundation for their schemes of tinance.  
What more supplies were necessary, should be  
occasionally demanded of the States, in their pres-  
ent mode of quotas.  
  
The second step I would recommend is, that  
Congress should instantly appoint the following  
great officers of state. A Secretary for Foreign  
Affairs, a President of War, a President of Marine,  
a Financier, a President of Trade—instead of this  
last, a Board of Trade may be preferable, as the  
regulations of trade are slow and gradual, and re-  
quire prudence and experience, (more than other  
qualities,) for which boards are very well adapted.  
  
Congress should choose for these offices men of  
the first abilities, property and character in the  
continent ; and such as have had the best oppor-  
tunity of being acquainted with the several branches.  
General Schuyler, whom you mentioned, would  
make an excellent President of War; General  
McDougall a very good Presidentof Marine. Mr.  
Robert Morris would have many things in his  
favor for the department of Finance. He could, by  
his own personal influence, give great weight to  
the measures he should adopt. I dare say men  
equally capable may be found for the other depart-  
ments.  
  
I know not if it would not be a good plan to let  
the financier be President of the Board of Trade ;  
but he should only have a casting voice in determin-  
ing questions there. There is a connection between  
trade and finance, which ought to make the director  
of one acquainted with the other ; but the financier  
should not direct the affairs of trade, because, for  
the sake of acquiring a reputation by increasing  
the revenues, he might adopt measures that would  
depress trade. In what relates to finance, he should  
be alone.  
  
These officers should have nearly the same  
  
  
  
powers and functions as those in France analogous  
  
THE CONSTITUTION. 581  
to them ; and each should be chief in his depart-  
ment, with subordinate boards, composed of assist-  
ant clerks, &amp;c., to execute his orders.  
  
In my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of  
inconceivable utility to our affairs; its benefits  
would be very speedily felt. It would give new  
life and energy to the operations of government.  
Business would be conducted with despatch, method  
and system.  
  
A million of abuses, now existing, would be  
corrected ; and judicious plans would be formed  
and executed for the public good.  
  
Another step, of immediate necessity, is, to re-  
cruit the army for the war, or at least for three  
years. This must be done by a mode similar to  
that which is practised in Sweden. There the  
inhabitants are thrown into classes of sixteen ; and  
when the sovereign wants men, each of these  
classes must furnish one. They raise nes a  
of money ; and if one of the class is willing-to be-  
come a soldier, he receives the money and offers  
himself a volunteer ; if none is found to do this, a  
draft is made, and he on whom the lot falls receives  
the money, and is obliged to serve. The minds of  
the people are prepared for a thing of this kind;  
the heavy bounties they have been obliged to pay  
for men to serve a few months must have disgusted  
them with this mode, and made them desirous of  
another, that will, once for all, answer the public  
  
urposes, and obviate a repetition of the demand.  
t ought, by all means, to be attempted; and Con-  
gress should frame a general plan, and press the  
execution upon the States. When the Confedera-  
tion comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this  
by a fundamental law ; and hereafter there would  
be no doubt of the success.  
  
But we cannot now wait for this. We want to  
replace the men whose time of service will expire  
the Ist of January ; for then, without this, we shall  
have no army remaining, and the enemy may do  
what they please. The general, in his letter  
already quoted, has assigned the most substantial  
reasons for paying immediate attention to this  
point.  
  
Congress should endeavor, both upon their credit  
in Europe, and by every possible exertion in this  
country, to provide clothing for their officers ; and  
should abolish the whole system of State supplies.  
The making good the depreciation of the currency,  
and all other compensations to the army, should be  
immediately taken up by Congress, and not left to  
the States. If they would have the accounts of de-  
preciation liquidated, and governmental certificates  
given for what is due, in specie, or an equivalent  
to specie, it would give satisfaction ; appointing  
periodical settlements for future depreciation.  
  
The placing the officers upon half pay during  
life would be a great stroke of policy, and would  
give Congress a stronger tie upon them than any-  
thing else they can do. No man that reflects a  
moment but will prefer a permanent provision of  
this kind to any temporary compensation. Nor is  
it opposed to economy ; the difference between this  
and between what has already been done will be  
insignificant. The benefit of it to the widows  
should be confined to those whose husbands die  
during the war. As to the survivors, not more  
than one half, on the usual calculation of men’s  
lives, will exceed the seven years for which the  
half pay is already established. Besides this,  
whatever may be the visionary speculations of  
some men at this time, we shall find it indispensable,  
after the war, to keep on foot a considerable body  
  
  
  
  
  
582  
  
of troops; and all the officers retained for this  
—_ must be deducted out of the half pay list.  
f any one will take the pains to calculate the ex-  
pense on these principles, I am persuaded he will  
find the addition of expense, from the establishment  
proposed, by no means a national object.  
  
The advantages of securing the attachment of the  
army to Congress, and binding them to the service  
by substantial ties, are immense. We should then  
have discipline; an army in reality as well as in  
name. Congress would then have a solid basis of  
authority and consequence; for, to me, it is an  
axiom that in our constitution an army is essential  
to the American Union.  
  
The providing of supplies is the pivot of every-  
thing else, (though a well constituted ariny would  
not, in a small degree, conduce to this by giving  
consistency and weight to government.) There  
are four ways, all which must be united. A  
foreign loan; heavy pecuniary taxes; a tax in  
kind; a bank founded on public and private  
credit.  
  
As to a foreign loan, I dare say Congress are  
doing everything in their power to obtain it. The  
most effectual way will be to tell France that with-  
out it we must make terms with Great Britain. This  
must be done with plainness and firmness, but  
with respect and without petulance ; not as a men-  
ace, but as a candid declaration of our cireum-  
stances. We need not fear to be deserted by  
France. Her interest and honor are too deeply  
involved in our fate ; and she can make no possible  
compromise. She can assist us, if she is convinced  
it is absolutely necessary, either by lending us  
herself, or by becoming our surety, or by influenc-  
ing Spain. It has been to me astonishing how  
any man could have doubted, at any period of our  
affairs, of the necessity of a foreign loan. It was  
self-evident that we had not a fund of wealth in  
this country capable of affording revenues equal to  
the expenses. We must then create artificial reve-  
nues, or borrow. The first was done; but it ought  
to have been foreseen that the expedient could not  
last, and we should have provided in time for its  
failure.  
  
Here was an error of Congress. I have good  
reason to believe that measures were not taken in  
earnest, early enough, to procure a loan abroad. I  
give you my honor, that, from our first outset, I  
thought as I do now, and wished for a foreign loan ;  
not only because I foresaw it would be essential,  
but because I considered it as a tie upon the nation  
from which it was derived, and as a means to prop  
our cause in Europe.  
  
Concerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary  
taxes I need say nothing, as it is a point in which  
everybody is agreed. Nor is there any danger that  
the product of any taxes, raised in this way, will  
overburthen the people, or exceed the wants of the  
public. Indeed, if all the paper in circulation were  
drawn annually into the treasury, it would neither  
do one nor the other.  
  
As to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results  
from this principle; that the money in circulation  
is not a sufficient representative of the productions  
of the country; and, consequently, no revenues  
raised from it as a medium can be a competent  
representative of that part of the products of the  
country which it is bound to contribute to the  
support of the public. ‘The public, therefore, to  
obtain its due, or satisfy its just demands and its  
wants, must call for a part of those products them

selves. This is done in all those countries which  
are not commercial ; in Russia, Prussia, Denmark,  
Sweden, &amp;c., and is peculiarly necessary in our  
case.  
  
Congress, in calling for specific supplies, seem  
to have had this in view; but their intention has  
not been answered. The States in general have  
undertaken to furnish the supplies by purchase; a  
mode, as I have observed, attended with every in-  
convenience, and subverting the principle on which  
the supplies were demanded—the insufficiercy of  
our circulating medium as a representative ror the  
labor and commodities of the country. It is there-  
fore necessary that Congress should be more ex-  
plicit ; should form the outlines of a plan for a tax  
in kind, and recommend it to the States as a measure  
of absolute necessity.  
  
The general idea I have of a plan is, that a re-  
spectable man should be appointed by the State, in  
each county, to collect the taxes and form maga-  
zines ; that Congress should have in each State an  
officer to superintend the whole; and that the  
State collectors should be subordinate and respon-  
sible to them. This continental superintendent  
might be subject to the general direction of the  
Quarter Master General, or not, as might be deemed  
best ; but, if not subject to him, he should be obliged  
to make monthly returns to the President at War,  
who should instruct him what proportion to deliver  
to the Quarter Master General.  
  
It may be necessary that the superintendents  
should sometimes have power to dispose of the ar-  
ticles in their possession, on public account, for it  
would happen that the contributions, in places re-  
mote from the army, could not be transported to the  
theatre of operations without too great expense, in  
which case it would be eligible to dispose of them,  
and purchase, with the money so raised, in the  
countries near the immediate scene of war.  
  
I know the objections which may be raised to  
this plan; its tendency to discourage industry, and  
the like. But necessity calls for it. We cannot  
proceed without it; and less evils must give place  
to greater. It is, besides, practised with success  
in other countries, and why not in this? It may  
be said that the examples cited are from nations  
under despotic governments ; and that the same  
would not be practicable with us. But I contend,  
where the public good is evidently the object, more  
may be effected in governments like ours than in  
any other. It has been a constant remark, that free  
countries have ever paid the heaviest taxes. The  
obedience of a free people to genera] laws, however  
hard they bear, is even more perfect than that of  
slaves to the arbitrary will of a prince. To this  
may be added, that Sweden was always a free  
government, and is so now, in a great degree, not-  
withstanding. the late revolution.  
  
How far it may be practicable to erect a bank  
on the joint credit of the public and of individuals,  
can only be certainly determined by the experiment.  
But it is of so much importance, that the experi-  
ment ought to be fully tried. When I saw the  
subscriptions going on to the bank established for  
supplying the army, I was in hopes it was only the  
/embryo of a more permanent and extensive estab-  
|lishment. But I have reason to believe I shall be  
|disappuinted. It does not seem to be at all con-  
ducted on the true principles of a bank. The  
| directors of it are purchasing with their stock, in-  
| stead of bank notes, as I expected ; in consequence

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
THE CONCEPTION OF  
of a particular sum of money for a particular pur-  
  
se.  
  
Paper credit never was long supported in any  
country on a national scale, where it was not  
founded on the juint basis of public and private  
credit. An attempt to establish it on public credit  
alone, in France, under the auspices of Mr. Law,  
had nearly ruined the kingdom. We have seen  
the effects of it in America; and every successive  
experiment proves the futility of the attempt. Our  
new money is depreciating almost as fast as the  
old ; though it has, in some States, as real funds  
as paper money ever had. The reason is, that the  
moneyed men have not an immediate interest to up-  
hold its credit. They may even, in many ways,  
find it their interest to undermine it. The only  
certain manner to obtain a permanent paper credit  
is to engage the moneyed interest immediately in it,  
by making them contribute the whole or part of  
the stock, and giving them the whole or part of the  
profits.  
  
The invention of banks, on the modern principle,  
originated in Venice. There the public and a  
company of moneyed men are mutually concerned.  
The Bank of England, unites public authority and  
faith with private credit; and hence we see what  
a vast fabric of paper credit is raised on a visionary  
basis. Had it not been for this, England would  
never have found sufficient funds to carry on her  
wars ; but, with the help of this, she has done, and  
is doing, wonders. The Bank of Amsterdam is on  
a similar foundation.  
  
And why can we not have an American Bank?  
Are our moneyed men less enlightened to their own  
interest, or less enterprising in the pursuit? I be-  
lieve the fault is in government, which does not  
exert itself to engage them in such a scheme. It  
is true the individuals in America are not very  
rich ; but this would not prevent their instituting  
a bank; it would only prevent its being done with  
such ample funds as in other countries. Have they  
not sufficient confidence in the government, and in  
the issue of the cause? Let the government en-  
deavor to inspire that confidence, by adopting the  
measures I have recommended, or others equivalent  
to them. Let it exert itself to procure a solid con-  
federation ; to establish a good plan of executive ad-  
ministration ; to form a permanent military force ;  
to obtain at all events a foreign Joan. ‘Te these  
things were in a train of vigorous execution, it  
would give a new spring to our affairs, government  
would recover its respectability, and individuals  
would renounce their diffidence.  
  
The object I should propose to myself, in the  
first instance, from a bank, would be an auxiliary  
mode of supplies, four which purpose contracts  
should be made between government and the bank  
on terms liberal and advantageous to the latter.  
Everything should be done, in the first instance, to  
encourage the bank. After it gets well established  
it will take care of itself, and gover t may  
  
583  
  
be deemed good stock; but at least a fourth part  
of the subscription should be in specie, or plate.  
There should be one great company, in three  
divisions ; in Virginia, Philadelphia, and at Bos-  
ton, or two at Philadelphia and Boston. The  
bank should have a right to issue bank notes, bear-  
ing two per cent. interest, for the whole of their  
stock ; but not to exceed it. These notes may be  
payable every three months, or oftener; and the  
faith of government must be pledged for the sup-  
port of the bank. It must, therefore, have a right,  
from time to time, to inspect its operations, and  
must appoint inspectors for the purpose.  
  
The advantages of the bank may consist in this :  
in the profits of the contracts made with govern-  
ment, which should bear interest to be annually  
paid in specie; in the loan of money at interest,  
say six per cent.; in purchasing lives by annuities,  
as practised in England, &amp;c. The benefit result-  
ing to the company is evident from the considera-  
tion that they may employ in circulation a great  
deal more money than they have specie in stock, on  
the credit of the real property which they will have  
in other use. This money will be employed either  
in fulfilling their contracts with the public, by  
which also they will gain a profit, or in loans at  
an advantageous interest, or in annuities.  
  
The bank may be allowed to purchase plate and  
bullion, and coin money, allowing government a  
part of the profit. I make the bank notes bear in-  
terest to obtain a readier currency, and to induce  
the holders to prefer them to specie, to prevent to?  
great a run upon the bank, at any time, beyond its  
ability to pay.  
  
If government can obtain a foreign loan, it should  
lend to the bank, on easy terms, to extend its in-  
fluence and facilitate a compliance with its engage-  
ments. If government could engage the States to  
raise a sum of money in specie, to be deposited in  
bank in the same manner, it would be of the  
greatest consequence. If government could prevail  
on the enthusiasm of the people to make a contri-  
bution in plate for the same purpose, it would be a  
master stroke. Things of this kind sometimes  
succeed in popular contests, and if undertaken with  
address, I should not despair of its success, but I  
should not be sanguine.  
  
The bank may be instituted for a term of years,  
by way of trial, and the particular privilege of  
coining money be for a term still shorter. A tem-  
porary transfer of it to a particular company can  
have no inconvenience, as the government are in  
no condition to improve this resource ; nor could it,  
in our circurnstances, be an object to them ; though,  
with the industry of a knot of individuals, it might  
be a valuable one to them.

which we greatly want in our circumstances—I  
Mean a more extensive valuable medium. We  
have an enormous nominal one at this time, but it.  
is only a name.  
In the present unsettled state of things in this:  
| country, we can hardly draw inferences from what  
has happened in others; otherwise I should be-  
| certain of the success of this scheme ; but I think.  
it has enough in its favor to be worthy of trial. I.  
have only skimmed the surface of the different sub-  
| jects I have introduced.  
  
  
  
  
  
584  
  
Should the plans recommended come into con-  
templation in earnest, and you desire my further  
thoughts, I will endeavor to give them more form  
and particularity.  
  
I am persuaded a solid confederation, a perma-  
nent army, a reasonable prospect of subsisting it,  
would give us treble consideration in Europe, and  
produce a peace this winter.  
  
If a convention is called, the minds of all the  
States and the people ought to be prepared to re-  
ceive its determinations by sensible and popular  
writings, which should conform to the views of  
Congress. There are epochs in human affairs  
when novelty even is useful. If a general opinion  
prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or  
false, and this obstructs or relaxes the operations  
of the public service, a change is necessary, if it be  
but for the sake of change. This is exactly the  
case now. It is a universal sentiment that our  
present system is a bad one, and that things do not  
go right on this account. The measure of a con-  
vention would revive the hopes of the people, and  
give a new direction to their passions, which may  
be improved in carrying points of substantial utility.  
The anes States have already pointed out this  
mode to Congress: they ought to take the hint and  
anticipate the others.  
  
And in future, my dear sir, two things let me  
recommend, as fundamental rules for the conduct  
of Congress :—to attach the army to them by every  
motive ; to maintain an air of authority (not dom-  
ineering) in all their measures with the States.  
The manner in which a thing is done has more  
influence than is commonly imagined. Men are  
governed by opinions ; this opinion is as much in-  
fluenced by appearances as by realities. If a gov-  
ernment appears to be confident of its own powers,  
it is the surest way to inspire the same confidence  
in others. If it is diffident, it may be certain there  
will be a still greater diffidence in others ; and that  
its authority will not only be distrusted, contro-  
verted, but contemned.

I wish, too, Congress would always consider  
that a kindness consists as much in the manner as  
in the thing. The best things done hesitatingly,  
and with an ill-grace, lose their effect, and produce  
disgust rather than satisfaction or gratitude. In  
what Congress have at any time done for the  
army, they have commonly been too late. They  
have seemed to yield to importunity, rather than to  
sentiments of justice or to a regard to the accom-  
modation of their troops. An attention to this idea

mental defect,’’ he wrote, “is a want of power in Congress.”  
This was due, in his opinion, to three causes:  
  
An excess of the spirit of liberty, which has made the particular  
states show a jealousy of all power not in their own hands, —and this  
jealousy has led them to exercise a right of judging in the last resort of  
the measures recommended by Congress, and of acting according to  
their own opinions of their propriety or necessity ; a diffidence, in Con-  
gress, of their own powers, by which they have been timid and inde-  
cisive in their resolutions, constantly making concessions to the states,  
till they have scarcely left themselves the shadow of power; a want of  
sufficient means at their disposal to answer the public exigencies.&quot;  
  
To the plea that Congress “had never any definite powers  
granted them,” he replies :  
  
The manner in which Congress was appointed would warrant, and the  
public good required that they should have considered themselves as  
vested with full power 4 preserve the republic from harm. ‘They have  
done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, which were always cheer-  
fully submitted to: the declaration of independence, the declaration of  
war.... All these implications of a complete sovereignty were never  
disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the whole conduct of  
administration. Undefined powers are discretionary powers, limited  
only by the abject for which they were given; in the present case the  
independence and freedom of America.’  
  
Of the Confederation, then under discussion and soon to be  
established, he says :  
  
It is neither fit for war nor peace. The idea of an uncontrollable  
sovereignty in each state over its internal police will defeat the other  
powers given to Congress, and make our union feeble and precarious.®  
His enumeration of the powers which properly belong to Con-  
gress summarizes quite fairly the powers which, according to  
the interpretation of Hamilton and the early Federalists, were  
actually conferred on the general government by the constitu
