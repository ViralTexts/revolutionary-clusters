stance of it.  
I request all who are angry with me on the Account of printing things they don’t like, calmly to consider these following Particulars  
1. That the Opinions of Men are almost as various as their Faces; an Observation general enough to become a common Proverb, So many Men so many Minds.  
2. That the Business of Printing has chiefly to do with Mens Opinions; most things that are printed tending to promote some, or oppose others.  
3. That hence arises the peculiar Unhappiness of that Business, which other Callings are no way liable to; they who follow Printing being scarce able to do any thing in their way of getting a Living, which shall not probably give Offence to some, and perhaps to many; whereas the Smith, the Shoemaker, the Carpenter, or the Man of any other Trade, may work indifferently for People of all Persuasions, without offending any of them: and the Merchant may buy and sell with Jews, Turks, Hereticks, and Infidels of all sorts, and get Money by every one of them, without giving Offence to the most orthodox, of any sort; or suffering the least Censure or Ill-will on the Account from any Man whatever.  
  
4. That it is as unreasonable in any one Man or Set of Men to expect to be pleas’d with every thing that is printed, as to think that nobody ought to be pleas’d but themselves.  
5. Printers are educated in the Belief, that when Men differ in Opinion, both Sides ought equally to have the Advantage of being heard by the Publick; and that when Truth and Error have fair Play, the former is always an overmatch for the latter: Hence they chearfully serve all contending Writers that pay them well, without regarding on which side they are of the Question in Dispute.  
6. Being thus continually employ’d in serving all Parties, Printers naturally acquire a vast Unconcernedness as to the right or wrong Opinions contain’d in what they print; regarding it only as the Matter of their daily labour: They print things full of Spleen and Animosity, with the utmost Calmness and Indifference, and without the least Ill-will to the Persons reflected on; who nevertheless unjustly think the Printer as much their Enemy as the Author, and join both together in their Resentment.  
7. That it is unreasonable to imagine Printers approve of every thing they print, and to censure them on any particular thing accordingly; since in the way of their Business they print such great variety of things opposite and contradictory. It is likewise as unreasonable what some assert, That Printers ought not to print any Thing but what they approve; since if all of that Business should make such a Resolution, and abide by it, an End would thereby be put to Free Writing, and the World would afterwards have nothing to read but what happen’d to be the Opinions of Printers.  
8. That if all Printers were determin’d not to print any thing till they were sure it would offend no body, there would be very little printed.  
9. That if they sometimes print vicious or silly things not worth reading, it may not be because they approve such things themselves, but because the People are so viciously and corruptly educated that good things are not encouraged. I have known a very numerous Impression of Robin Hood’s Songs go off i

tages, I shall only request all who are angry  
j with me on account of printiog things they  
i don’t like, calmly to consider the following  
j particulars:  
“1st. That the opinions of ineu are almost

so many men so many minds.  
‘•2d. That the business of printing has

I mgs are no way liable to ; they who follow  
punting being scarce able to do any thing  
&#x27; in their way of getting a living which shall  
! not, probably, give offence to some, and per­  
haps to many ; whereas the smith, tho shoe­  
maker, the carpenter, or the man of any other

and the merchant may buy and sell with

i and get money by every one of them, with­  
out giving offence to the most orthordoi of  
any sort, or suffering the least censure or  
: ill-will on that account from any man what­  
soever.  
“4th. That it is unreasonable in any one  
man or set of men to expect to be pleased with  
every thing that is printed, as to think that  
nobody ought to be pleased but themselves.  
“oth. IVitUer* are educated in the belief

“o:h. Being thus continually employed in

an uucon corned lies* as to the right or wrong  
opinions contained in what they print, re­

animosity, w ith the utmost coolness and in­  
I difference, and without the least ill will to  
the persons reflected on; w ho nevertheless un­  
justly think the printer as much their enemy  
&#x27; as the author, and join both together io their

not be because they approve such things
