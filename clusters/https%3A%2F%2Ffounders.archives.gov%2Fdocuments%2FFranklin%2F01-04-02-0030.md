h School,Sketch’d out for the Consideration of the Trusteesof the Philadelphia Academy  
It is expected that every Scholar to be admitted into this School, be at least able to pronounce and divide the Syllables in Reading, and to write a legible Hand. None to be receiv’d that are under [     ] Years of Age.  
  
  
First or lowest Class.  
Let the first Class learn the English Grammar Rules, and at the same time let particular Care be taken to improve them in Orthography. Perhaps the latter is best done by Pairing the Scholars, two of those nearest equal in their Spelling to be put together; let these strive for Victory, each propounding Ten Words every Day to the other to be spelt. He that spells truly most of the other’s Words, is Victor for that Day; he that is Victor most Days in a Month, to obtain a Prize, a pretty neat Book of some Kind useful in their future Studies. This Method fixes the Attention of Children extreamly to the Orthography of Words, and makes them good Spellers very early. ’Tis a Shame for a Man to be so ignorant of this little Art, in his own Language, as to be perpetually confounding Words of like Sound and different Significations; the Consciousness of which Defect, makes some Men, otherwise of good Learning and Understanding, averse to Writing even a common Letter.  
  
Let the Pieces read by the Scholars in this Class be short, such as Croxall’s Fables, and little Stories. In giving the Lesson, let it be read to them; let the Meaning of the difficult Words in it be explained to them, and let them con it over by themselves before they are called to read to the Master, or Usher; who is to take particular Care that they do not read too fast, and that they duly observe the Stops and Pauses. A Vocabulary of the most usual difficult Words might be formed for their Use, with Explanations; and they might daily get a few of those Words and Explanations by Heart, which would a little exercise their Memories; or at least they might write a Number of them in a small Book for the Purpose, which would help to fix the Meaning of those Words in their Minds, and at the same Time furnish every one with a little Dictionary for his future Use.  
  
  
The Second Class to be taught  
Reading with Attention, and with proper Modulations of the Voice according to the Sentiments and Subject.  
Some short Pieces, not exceeding the Length of a Spectator, to be given this Class as Lessons (and some of the easier Spectators would be very suitable for the Purpose.) These Lessons might be given over Night as Tasks, the Scholars to study them against the Morning. Let it then be required of them to give an Account, first of the Parts of Speech, and Construction of one or two Sentences; this will oblige them to recur frequently to their Grammar, and fix its principal Rules in their Memory. Next of the Intention of the Writer, or the Scope of the Piece; the Meaning of each Sentence, and of every uncommon Word. This would early acquaint them with the Meaning and Force of Words, and give them that most necessary Habit, of Reading with Attention.  
The Master then to read the Piece with the proper Modulations of Voice, due Emphasis, and suitable Action, where Action is required; and put the Youth on imitating his Manner.  
Where the Author has us’d an Expression not the best, let it be pointed out; and let his Beauties be particularly remarked to the Youth.  
Let the Lessons for Reading be varied, that the Youth may be made acquainted with good Stiles of all Kinds in Prose and Verse, and the proper Manner of reading each Kind. Sometimes a well-told Story, a Piece of a Sermon, a General’s Speech to his Soldiers, a Speech in a Tragedy, some Part of a Comedy, an Ode, a Satyr, a Letter, Blank Verse, Hudibrastick, Heroic, &amp;c. But let such Lessons for Reading be chosen, as contain some useful Instruction, whereby the Understandings or Morals of the Youth, may at the same Time be improv’d.  
It is requir’d that they should first study and understand the Lessons, before they are put upon reading them properly, to which End each Boy should have an English Dictionary to help him over Difficulties. When our Boys read English to us, we are apt to imagine they understand what they read because we do, and because ’tis their Mother Tongue. But they often read as Parrots speak, knowing little or nothing of the Meaning. And it is impossible a Reader should give the due Modulation to his Voice, and pronounce properly, unless his Understanding goes before his Tongue, and makes him Master of the Sentiment. Accustoming Boys to read aloud what they do not first understand, is the Cause of those even set Tones so common among Readers, which when they have once got a Habit of using, they find so difficult to correct: By which Means, among Fifty Readers we scarcely find a good One. For want of good Reading, Pieces publish’d with a View to influence the Minds of Men for their own or the publick Benefit, lose Half their Force. Were there but one good Reader in a Neighbourhood, a publick Orator might be heard throughout a Nation with the same Advantages, and have the same Effect on his Audience, as if they stood within the Reach of his Voice.  
  
  
The Third Class to be taught  
Speaking properly and gracefully, which is near of Kin to good Reading, and naturally follows it in the Studies of Youth. Let the Scholars of this Class begin with learning the Elements of Rhetoric from some short System, so as to be able to give an Account of the most usual Tropes and Figures. Let all their bad Habits of Speaking, all Offences against good Grammar, all corrupt or foreign Accents, and all improper Phrases, be pointed out to them. Short Speechs from the Roman or other History, or from our Parliamentary Debates, might be got by heart, and deliver’d with the proper Action, &amp;c. Speeches and Scenes in our best Tragedies and Comedies (avoiding every Thing that could injure the Morals of Youth) might likewise be got by Rote, and the Boys exercis’d in delivering or acting them; great Care being taken to form their Manner after the truest Models.  
For their farther Improvement, and a little to vary their Studies, let them now begin to read History, after having got by Heart a short Table of the principal Epochas in Chronology. They may begin with Rollin’s Antient and Roman Histories, and proceed at proper Hours as they go thro’ the subsequent Classes, with the best Histories of our own Nation and Colonies. Let Emulation be excited among the Boys by giving, Weekly, little Prizes, or other small Encouragements to those who are able to give the best Account of what they have read, as to Times, Places, Names of Persons, &amp;c. This will make them read with Attention, and imprint the History well in their Memories. In remarking on the History, the Master will have fine Opportunities of instilling Instruction of various Kinds, and improving the Morals as well as the Understandings of Youth.  
The Natural and Mechanic History contain’d in Spectacle de la Nature, might also be begun in this Class, and continued thro’ the subsequent Classes by other Books of the same Kind: For next to the Knowledge of Duty, this Kind of Knowledge is certainly the most useful, as well as the most entertaining. The Merchant may thereby be enabled better to understand many Commodities in Trade; the Handicraftsman to improve his Business by new Instruments, Mixtures and Materials; and frequently Hints are given of new Manufactures, or new Methods of improving Land, that may be set on foot greatly to the Advantage of a Country.  
  
  
The Fourth Class to be taught  
Composition. Writing one’s own Language well, is the next necessary Accomplishment after good Speaking. ’Tis the Writing-Master’s Business to take Care that the Boys make fair Characters, and place them straight and even in the Lines: But to form their Stile, and even to take Care that the Stops and Capitals are properly disposed, is the Part of the English Master. The Boys should be put on Writing Letters to each other on any common Occurrences, and on various Subjects, imaginary Business, &amp;c. containing little Stories, Accounts of their late Reading, what Parts of Authors please them, and why. Letters of Congratulation, of Compliment, of Request, of Thanks, of Recommendation, of Admonition, of Consolation, of Expostulation, Excuse, &amp;c. In these they should be taught to express themselves clearly, concisely, and naturally, without affected Words, or high-flown Phrases. All their Letters to pass through the Master’s Hand, who is to point out the Faults, advise the Corrections, and commend what he finds right. Some of the best Letters published in our own Language, as Sir William Temple’s, those of Pope, and his Friends, and some others, might be set before the Youth as Models, their Beauties pointed out and explained by the Master, the Letters themselves transcrib’d by the Scholar.  
Dr. Johnson’s Ethices Elementa, or first Principles of Morality, may now be read by the Scholars, and explain’d by the Master, to lay a solid Foundation of Virtue and Piety in their Minds. And as this Class continues the Reading of History, let them now at proper Hours receive some farther Instructions in Chronology, and in that Part of Geography (from the Mathematical Master) which is necessary to understand the Maps and Globes. They should also be acquainted with the modern Names of the Places they find mention’d in antient Writers. The Exercises of good Reading and proper Speaking still continued at suitable Times.  
  
  
Fifth Class.  
To improve the Youth in Composition, they may now, besides continuing to write Letters, begin to write little Essays in Prose; and sometimes in Verse, not to make them Poets, but for this Reason, that nothing acquaints a Lad so speedily with Variety of Expression, as the Necessity of finding such Words and Phrases as will suit with the Measure, Sound and Rhime of Verse, and at the same Time well express the Sentiment. These Essays should all pass under the Master’s Eye, who will point out their Faults, and put the Writer on correcting them. Where the Judgment is not ripe enough for forming new Essays, let the Sentiments of a Spectator be given, and requir’d to be cloath’d in a Scholar’s own Words; or the Circumstances of some good Story, the Scholar to find Expression. Let them be put sometimes on abridging a Paragraph of a diffuse Author, sometimes on dilating or amplifying what is wrote more closely. And now let Dr. Johnson’s Noetica, or first Principles of human Knowledge, containing a Logic, or Art of Reasoning, &amp;c. be read by the Youth, and the Difficulties that may occur to them be explained by the Master. The Reading of History, and the Exercises of good Reading and just Speaking still continued.  
  
  
Sixth Class.  
In this Class, besides continuing the Studies of the preceding, in History, Rhetoric, Logic, Moral and Natural Philosophy, the best English Authors may be read and explain’d; as Tillotson, Milton, Locke, Addison, Pope, Swift, the higher Papers in the Spectator and Guardian, the best Translations of Homer, Virgil and Horace, of Telemachus, Travels of Cyrus, &amp;c.  
Once a Year, let there be publick Exercises in the Hall, the Trustees and Citizens present. Then let fine gilt Books be given as Prizes to such Boys as distinguish themselves, and excel the others in any Branch of Learning; making three Degrees of Comparison; giving the best Prize to him that performs best; a less valuable One to him that comes up next to the best; and another to the third. Commendations, Encouragement and Advice to the rest; keeping up their Hopes that by Industry they may excel another Time. The Names of those that obtain the Prizes, to be yearly printed in a List.  
  
The Hours of each Day are to be divided and dispos’d in such a Manner, as that some Classes may be with the Writing-Master, improving their Hands, others with the Mathematical Master, learning Arithmetick, Accompts, Geography, Use of the Globes, Drawing, Mechanicks, &amp;c. while the rest are in the English School, under the English Master’s Care.  
Thus instructed, Youth will come out of this School fitted for learning any Business, Calling or Profession, except such wherein Languages are required; and tho’ unaquainted with any antient or foreign Tongue, they will be Masters of their own, which is of more immediate and general Use; and withal will have attain’d many other valuable Accomplishments; the Time usually spent in acquiring those Languages, often without Success, being here employ’d in laying such a Foundation of Knowledge and Ability, as, properly improv’d, may qualify them to pass thro’ and execute the several Offices of civil Life, with Advantage and Reputation to themselves and Country.

them good-ſpellers very early. It is a ſhame for  
àꝝ man to be ſo ignorant of this little art, in his own

who is to take particular care that they do not read

words might be formed for theis uſe, with expla-  
nations; and they might daily get a few of thoſe  
Words and explanations by heart, which would a

SKETCH OF AN ENGLISH SCHOOL.  
For the Consideration of the Trustees of the Philadelphia  
Academy.  
  
Tr is expeeted that every scholar to be admitted into this  
school, be at least able to pronounce and divide the syllables  
in reading, and to write a legible hand, None to be received  
thatare under —years of age,  
  
FIRST, OR LOWEST CLASS,  
  
Let the first class learn the English grammar rules, and at  
the same tme let particular care be taken to improve them  
in rapby. Perhaps the latter is best done by  
the scholars; two of those nearest equal in their spelling to  
be put together. Leet these strive for victory ; each pro~  
pounding van words every day to the other to be spelled. He  
that spells truly most of the other’s words, 1s victor for that  
day ; he that is victor most days in a month to obtain a prize,  
&amp; pretty neat book of some kind, useful in their future studies.  
This method fixes the attention of ehildr ly to the  
orthography of words, and makes them good spellers very  
early. 1tis ashame for a man to be so ignorant of this little  
art, nm his own language, as to be perpetually confounding  
words of like sound and different significauions; the con  
sciousness of which defect makes some men, otherwise of  
good learning and und ding, averse to writing even @  
  
  
  
  
  
common letter.  
  
Let the pieces read by the scholars in this class be short ;  
such as Croxal’s fables and little stories. In giving the les  
son, let st be read to them; let the meani the difficult  
words in it be ex; to them; and let them con it over  
by themselves they are called to read to the master or  
usher ; who is to take particular care that they do not read  
too fast, and that they duly observe the stops and pauses, A  
vocabulary of the most usual difficult words might be formed  
for their use, with explanations ; and they might daily get a  
few of those words and explanations by heart, which would a  
little exercise their memories ; or at least they might write a  
number of them in a small book for that pu , which would  
help to fix the meaning of those words in their minds, and at  
the same time furnish every one with a little dictionary for  
his future use,  
  
THE SECOND CLASS,  
  
To be taught reading with attention, and with proper mo-  
dulations of the voice, ding to the i and the  
subject. . eS Pe  
  
Some short pieces, not exeeedi e le’ a Specta-  
tor, to be gous tin class for lessons (and some of the easier  
Spectators would be very suitable for the purpose). These  
lessons might be given every night as tasks; the scholars to  
study them against the morning. Let it then be required of  
them to give an account, first of the parts of speeeh, and cone  
struction of one or two sentences. This will oblige them to  
recur frequently to their grammar, and fix its principal rules  
in their memory. Next, of the intention of the writer, or the  
scope of the piece, the meaning of each sentence, and of  
every uncommon word. This would early acquaint them with  
the meaning and force of words, and give them that most ne=  
cessary habit of reading with attention.  
  
The master then to read the piece with the proper modu.  
lations, of voice, due emphasis, and suitable action, where  
  
action is required ; and put the youth on imitating his mane  
  
  
  
oo)  
  
ner.  
  
Where the author has used an expression not the best, let  
it be pointed out; and let his beauties be particularly re+  
marked to the youth,  
  
Let the lessons for reading be varied, that the youth may  
be made acquainted with good styles of all kinds in prose and  
verse, and the proper manner of reading each ki  
times a well-told story, a piece of a sermon, a general’s  
speech to his soldiers, a speech in a tragedy, some part of a  
comedy, an ode, a satire, a letter, blank verse, Hudibrastie,  
heroic, &amp;c. But let such lessons be chosen for reading, as  
contain some useful instruction, whereby the understanding  
or morals of the youth may at the same time be improved.  
  
It is required that they should first study and understand  
the lessons, before they are put upon reading them properly ;  
to which end each boy should have an English Dictionary to  
help him over difficulties, When our boys read English to  
us, we are apt to imagine they understand what they read,  
because we Fs and because, it is their mother tongue. But  
they often read as parrots speak, knowing little or nothing of  
the meaning. And it is impossible a reader should give the  
due modulation to his voice, and pronounce properly, unless  
his understanding goes before his tongue, and makes him  
master of the sentiment. Accnstoming boys to read aloud  
what they do not first understand, is the cause of those even  
set tones so common among readers, which, when they have  
once got a habit of using, they find so difficult to correct ; by  
which means, among fifty readers we scarcely find a good  
one. For want of good reading, pieces published with a view  
to influence the minds of men, for their own or the public  
benefit, lose half their foree. Were there but one good reader  
in a neighborhood, a public orator might be heard throughout  
a nation with the same advantages, and have the same effect  
  
upon his audience as if they stood within the reach of his  
voice,

from the Roman or other history, or from the parliamentary  
debates, might be got by heart, and delivered with the proper  
action, &amp;c.—Speeches and scenes in our best tragedies and  
comedies (avoiding every thing that could injure the morals of  
youth) might likewise be got by rote, and the boys exercised  
in delivering or acting them; great care being taken to form  
their manner after the truest models,  
  
For their farther improvement, and a little to vary their  
studies, let them now begin to read history, after having got  
} heart a short table of the principal epochas in chronology.  
  
hey may begin with Rollin’s Ancient and Roman Histo-  
ries, and proceed at proper hours, as they go through the sub-  
sequent classes, with the best histories of our own nation and  
colonies. Let emulation be excited among the boys, by giv-  
ing, weekly, little prizes, or other small encouragements to  
those who are able to give the best account of what they have  
read, as to times, places, names of persons, &amp;c. This will  
make them read with attention, and imprint the history well  
in their memories. In remarking on the history, the master  
will have fine opportunities of instilling instruction of various  
kinds, -— saproring the morals, as well as the understand-  
  
, of youth,  
  
‘he natural and mechanic history, contained in the Spec-  
tacle dela Nature, might also be begun in this class, and con-  
tinued through the subsequent classes, by other books of the  
same kind; for, nextto the knowledge of duty, this kind of  
knowledge is certainly the most useful, as well asthe most  
entertaining. The merchant may thereby be enabled better  
tound d many ities in trade ; the handicraftsman  
to improve his busi by new instr » mixtures, and  
materials, and frequently hints are given for new methods of  
improving land, that may be set on foot greatly to the advan-  
tage of a country.  
  
  
  
  
  
THE FOURTH CLASS,  
  
To be taught composition. Writing one’s own language  
well, is the eat aeceusary accomplishment after good pm  
ing. It is the writing-master’s business to take care that the  
boys make fair characters, and place them straight and even  
in the lines: but to form their style, and even to take care  
that the stops and capitals are properly disposed, is the part  
of the English master. The Ce should be put on writing  
letters to each other on any common occurrences, and on va-  
rious subjects, imaginary business, &amp;c. containing little sto-  
ries, accounts of their late reading, what parts of authors  
please them, and why ; letters of congratulation, of compliment,  
of request, of thanks, ofr dation, of admonition, of con-  
solation, of expostulation, excuse, &amp;c. In these they should  
be taught to express th s clearly, isely, and natu-  
rally, without affected words or high-flown phrases. All their  
letters to pass through the master’s hands, who is to point out  
the faults, advise the corrections, and commend what he finds  
right. Some of the best letters published in their own lan-  
  
age, as Sir William Temple’s, those of Pope and his  
riends, and some others, might be set before the youth as  
models, their beauties pointed out and explained by the mas-  
ter, the letters themselves transcribed by the scholar.  
  
Dr. Johnson’s Ethices Elementa, or First Principles of Mo-  
rality, may now be read by the scholars, and explained by the  
master, to laya solid foundation of virtue and piety in their  
minds. And as this class continues the reading of history,  
let them now, at proper hours, receive some farther instruction  
in chronology and in that part of geography (from the mathe-  
matical master) which is necessary to understand the maps  
and globes. They should also be acquainted with the modern  
names of the places they find mentioned in ancient writers.  
The exercises of good reading, and proper speaking, still con-  
tinued at suitable times,  
  
THE FIFTH CLASS.  
  
To improve the youth in composition, they may now, be-  
sides continuing to write letters, begin to write little essays  
in prose, and sometimes in verse; not to make them poets,  
but for this reason, that nothing acquaints a lad so speedil  
with a variety of expression, as the necessity of finding su  
words and phrases, as will suit the measure, sound, and rhyme  
of verse, and at the same time well express the sentiment.  
These essays should all pass under the master’s eye, who  
will point out their faults, and put the writer on correcting  
them. Where the judgment is not ripe enough for mong |  
new essays, let the sentiments of a Spectator be given, an  
required to be clothed in the scholar&#x27;s own words; or the cir-  
cumstances of some good story: the scholar to find expres-  
sion, Let them be put sometimes on abridging a paragraph  
of a diffuse author ; sometimes on dilating or amplifying what  
is wrote more closely. And now let Dr. Johnson’s Noetica,  
or First Principles of Human Knowledge, containing a lo-  
  
ic, or art of reasoning, &amp;c. be read by the youth, and the  
Fiicutties that may occur to them he explained by the mas-  
ter. ‘I&#x27;he reading of history, and the exercise of good reading  
and just speaking, still continued.  
  
  
  
  
  
SIXTH CLASS.  
  
Iw this class, besides continuing the studies of the preced-  
ing in history, rhetoric, logic, moral and natural philosophy,  
the best English authors may be read and explained; as Til-  
lotson, Milton, Locke, Addison, Pope, Swift, the higher pa-  
  
in the Spectator and Guardian, the best translations of  
  
‘omer, Virgil, and Horace, of Telemachus, Travels of Cy-  
rus, &amp;c.  
  
Once a-year let there be public exercises in the hall; the  
trustees and citizens present. Then let fine gilt books be  
given as prizes to such boys as distinguish themselves, and  
excel the others in any branch of learning, making three  
degrees of comparison; giving the best prize to him that  
  
  
  
ag t, and advice to the rest, keeping up their hopes,  
that by industry they may excel another time. The names  
of that obtain the prize, to be yearly printed in a list.  
The hours of each day are to be divided and disposed in  
such a manner as that some classes may be with the writin  
master, improving their hands, others with the mathemati  
master, learning arithmetic, accounts, geography, use of the  
lobes, drawing, mechanics, &amp;c. ; while the rest are in the  
English school, under the English master’s care.  
hus instructed, youth will come out of this school fitted  
for learning any business, caliing, or profession, except in  
such wherein languages are required ; and though unacquaint~  
ed with any ancient or foreign tongue, they will be masters  
of their own, which is of more immediate and general use ;  
and withal, will have attained many other valuable accom-  
plishments; the time usually spent in acquiring those lan-  
guages, often without success, being here employed in laying  
such a foundation of knowledge and ability, as properly im-  
proved, may qualify them to pass through and execute the  
several offices of civil life, with advantage and reputation to  
themselves and country.

SKETCH OF AN ENGLISH SCHOOL FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF  
THE TRUSTEES OF THE PHILADELPHIA ACADEMY.  
  
‘It is expected that every scholar, to be admitted into this  
school, be at least able to pronounce and divide the syllables  
in reading, and to write a legible hand. None to be received,  
that are under — years of age.  
  
First, or Lowest Class, — Let the first class learn the Eng-  
lish Grammar rules ; and, at the same time, let particular care  
be taken to improve them in orthegraphy. Perhaps the latter  
is best done by pairing the scholars ; two of the nearest equal  
in their spelling to be put together. Let these strive for vic-  
tory; each propounding ten words, every day, to the other to  
be spelled. He that spells truly most of the other’s words, is  
victor for that day ; he that is victor most days in the month,  
to obtain a prize, a pretty, neat book of some kind, useful in  
their future studies. ‘This method fixes the attention of chil-  
dren extremely to the orthography of words, and makes them  
good spellers very early. It is ashame for a man to be so  
ignorant of this little art, in his own language, as to be per-  
petually confounding words of like sound and different signi-

fication ; the consciousness of which defect makes some men,  
otherwise of good learning and understanding, averse to writ-  
ing even a common letter.  
  
Let the pieces read by the scholars in this class be short ;  
such as Croxal’s fables, and little stories. In giving the les-  
son, let it be read to them; let the meaning of the difficult  
words in it be explained to them ; and let them con over by  
themselves, before they are called to read to the master or  
usher, who is to take particular care that they do not read too  
fast, and that they duly observe the stops and pauses. A  
vocabulary of the most usual difficult words might be formed  
for their use, with explanations ; and they might daily get a  
few of those words and explanations by heart, which would a  
little exercise their memories ; or, at least, they might write  
a number of them in a small book for the purpose, which  
would help to fix the meaning of those words in their minds,  
and at the same time furnish every one with a little dictionary  
for his future use.  
  
Second Class. —To be taught reading with attention, and  
with proper modulations of the voice, according to the sen-  
timents and the subject. Some short pieces, not exceeding  
the length of a Spectator, to be given this class for lessons ;  
(and some of the easier Spectators would be very suitable for  
the purpose.) These lessons might be given every night as  
tasks ; the scholars to study them against the morning. Let  
it then be required of them to give an account, first of the  
parts of speech, and construction of one or two sentences.  
This will oblige them to recur frequently to their grammar ;  
and fix its principal rules in their memory. Next, of the in-  
tention of the writer, or the scope of the piece, the meaning  
of each sentence, and of every uncommon word. ‘This would  
early acquaint them with the meaning and force of words, and  
give them that most necessary habit of reading with attention.  
  
The master then to read the piece, with the proper modula-  
tions of voice, due emphasis, and suitable action, where action  
is required ; and put the youth on imitating his manner.  
  
Where the author has used an expression not the best, let  
it be pointed out ; and let his beauties be particularly remarked  
to the youth.  
  
Let the lessons for reading be varied, that the youth may be  
made acquainted with ‘good styles of all kinds, in prose and  
verse, and the proper manner of reading each kind, — some-  
times a well-told story, a piece of a sermon, a general’s speech  
to his soldiers, a speech in a tragedy, some part of a comedy,  
an ode, a satire, a letter, blank verse, Hudibrastic, heroic, ete.  
  
  
  
  
  
SKETCH OF AN ENGLISH SCHOOL. 547  
  
But let such lessons be chosen for reading, as contain some  
useful instruction, whereby the understandings or morals of  
youth may be improved.  
  
It is required that they should first study and understand  
the lessons, before they are put upon reading them properly,  
to which end each boy should have an English dictionary, to  
help him over difficulties. When our boys read English to  
us, we are apt to imagine they understand what they read, be-  
cause we do, and because it is their mother tongue. But they  
often read as parrots speak, knowing little or nothing of the  
meaning. And it is impossible a reader should give the due  
modulation to his voice, and pronounce properly, unless his  
understanding goes before his tongue, and makes him master  
of the sentiment.  
  
Accustoming boys to read aloud what they do not first un-  
derstand, is the cause of those even, set tones, so common  
among readers, which when they have once got the habit of  
using, they find so difficult-to correct ; by which means, among  
fifty readers we scarcely find a good one. For want of good  
reading, pieces published with a view to influence the minds  
of men, for their own or the public benefit, lose half their  
force. Were there but one good reader in a neighborhood, a  
public orator might be heard throughout a nation with the  
same advantages, and have the same effect upon his audience,  
as if they stood within the reach of his voice.  
  
Third Class. —&#x27;To be taught speaking properly and grace-  
fully ; which is near akin to good reading, and naturally fol-  
lows it in the studies of youth. Let the scholars of this class  
begin with learning the elements of rhetoric from some short  
system, so as to be able to give an account of the most useful  
tropes and figures. Let all their bad habits of speaking, all  
offences against good grammar, all corrupt or foreign accents, and  
all improper phrases, be pointed out to them. Short speeches  
from the Roman, or other history, or from the parliamen-  
tary debates, might be got by heart, and delivered with proper  
action, etc.  
  
Speeches and scenes in our best tragedies and comedies,  
(avoiding everything that could injure the morals of youth,)  
might likewise be got by rote, and the boys exercised in de-  
livering or acting them ; great care being taken to form their  
manner after the truest models.  
  
For their further improvement, and a little to vary their  
studies, let them now begin to read history, after having got  
by heart a short table of the principal epochs in chronology.  
They may begin with Rollin’s ancient and Roman histories,  
  
  
  
548 SKETCH OF AN ENGLISH SCHOOL.  
  
and proceed at proper hours, as they go through the subse-  
quent classes, with the best histories of our own nation and  
colonies. Let emulation be excited among the boys, by giv-  
ing, weekly, little prizes, or other small encouragements, to  
those who are able to give the best account of what they have  
read, as to time, places, names of persons, etc. This will  
make them read with attention, and imprint the history well  
in their memories. In remarking on the history, the master  
will have fine opportunities for instilling instruction, of vari-  
ous kinds, and improving the morals, as well as the under-  
standing of youth.  
  
The natural and mechanic history, contained in the Specta-  
cle de la Nature, might also be begun in this class, and con-  
tinued through the subsequent classes, by other books of the  
same kind ; for, next to the knowledge of duty, this know!-  
edge is certainly the most useful, as well as the most enter-  
taining. ‘I&#x27;he merchant may thereby be enabled better to un-  
derstand many commodities in trade ; the handicraftsman, to  
improve his business by new instruments, mixtures, and ma-  
terials ; and frequeutly hints are given for new manufactures,  
or new methods of improving land, that may be set on foot,  
greatly to the advantage of a country.  
  
Fourth Class. —&#x27;To be taught composition. Writing one’s  
own language well, is the next necessary accomplishment,  
after good speaking. It is the writing-master’s business to  
take care that the boys make fair characters, and place them  
straight and even in their lines; but to form their style, and  
even to take care that the stops and capitals are properly dis-  
posed, is the part of the English master. The boys should  
be put on writing letters to each other on any common occur-  
rences, and on various subjects, imaginary business, etc., con-  
taining little stories, accounts of their late reading, what parts  
of authors please them, and why ; letters of congratulation, of  
compliment, of requests, of thanks, of recommendation, of ad-  
monition, of consolation, of expostulation, excuse, etc. In  
these they should be taught to express themselves clearly,  
concisely, and naturally, without affected words, or high-flown  
phrases. All their letters to pass through the master’s hand,  
who is to point out the faults, advise the corrections, and com-  
mend what he finds right. Some of the best letters published  
in our own language, as Sir William Temple’s, those of Pope  
and his friends, and some others, might be set before the  
youth as models, their beauties pointed out and explained by  
the master, the letters themselves transcribed by the scholars.  
  
Dr. Johnson’s Ethices Elementa, or First Principles of Mo-  
  
  
  
SKETCH OF AN ENGLISH SCHOOL. 549  
  
rality, may now be read by the scholars, and explained by the  
master, to lay a solid foundation of virtue and piety in their  
minds. And as this class continues the reading of history, let  
them now, at proper hours, receive some further instruction  
in chronology, and in that part of geography, (from the math-  
ematical master,) which is necessary to understand the maps  
and globes. ‘They should also be acquainted with the modern  
names of the places they find mentioned in ancient writers.  
The exercises of good reading, and proper speaking, still con-  
tinued at suitable times.  
  
Fifth Class. —&#x27;To improve the youth in composition, they  
may now, besides continuing to write letters, begin to write  
little essays in prose, and sometimes in verse: not to make  
them poets, but for this reason, that nothing acquaints a lad so  
speedily with variety of expression, as the necessity of finding  
such words and phrases as will suit the measure, sound, and  
rhyme of verse, and, at the same time, will express the senti-  
ment. ‘These essays should all pass under the master’s eye,  
who will point out their faults, and put the writer on correct-  
ing them. Where the judgment is not ripe enough for form-  
ing new essays, let the sentiments of a Spectator be given, and  
required to be clothed in the scholar’s own words ; or the cir-  
cumstances of some good story, the scholar to find expression.  
Let them be put sometimes on abridging a paragraph of adif-  
fuse author: sometimes on dilating or amplifying what is  
written more closely. And now let Dr. Johnson’s Noética, or  
First Principles of Human Knowledge, containing a logic, or  
art of reasoning, etc., be read by the youth, and the difficul-  
ties that may occur to them be explained by the master. The  
reading of history, and the exercises of good reading and just  
speaking, still continued.  
  
Sixth Class. —In this class, besides continuing the studies  
of the preceding in history, rhetoric, logic, moral and natural  
philosophy, the best English authors may be read and ex-  
plained ; as Tillotson, Milton, Locke, Addison, Pope, Swift,  
the higher papers in the Spectator and Guardian, the best  
translations of Homer, Virgil, and Horace, of Telemachus,  
Travels of Cyrus, ete.  
  
Once a year, let there be public exercises in the hall; the  
trustees and citizens present. Then let fine gilt books be  
given as prizes to such boys as distinguish themselves and  
excel the others in any branch of learning, making tliree de-  
grees of comparison: giving the best prize to him that per-  
forms best ; a less valuable one, to him that comes up next to  
the best ; and another to the third. Commendations, encour

by industry, they may excel another time. The names of  
those that obtain the prize, to be yearly printed in the list.  
  
The hours of each day are to be divided and disposed in such  
a manner, as that some classes may be with the writing master,  
improving their hands ; others with the mathematical master,  
learning arithmetic, accounts, geography, use of the globes,  
drawing, mechanics, etc., while the rest are in the English  
school, under the English master’s care.  
  
Thus instructed, youth will come out of this school fitted  
for learning any business, calling, or profession, except such  
wherein languages are required: and, though unacquainted with  
any ancient or foreign tongue, they will be masters of their  
own, which is of more immediate and general use, and withal  
will have attained many other valuable accomplishments: the  
time usually spent in acquiring those languages, often without  
success, being here employed in laying such a foundation of  
knowledge and ability, as, properly improved, may qualify  
them to pass through and execute the several offices of civil  
life, with advantage and reputation to themselves and their  
country.”
