Sirs,  
					Quincy, April, 10 1809.  
				  
				FROM Mr. Murray, the American Minister at the  
Hague, who had been appointed by President Washington, I received assurances from the French government  
similar to those in Mr. Barlow’s letter and so many others.  
They were conveyed from the French Directory to Mr.  
Pichon, Secretary of Legation and Charge des Affaires of  
the French Republic near the Batavian Republic, in the  
absence of the French Ambassador, by him officially communicated to Mr. Murray, and by him to the Executive of  
the United States. The communication was in these  
words:[Translation.]  
Exterior Relations.  
3d division.N. B. The good order of the Correspondence requires, the answer should relate the number of the division above indicated.liberty. equality.French Seal of the Department of Exterior Relations.Paris, the 7th Vendimaire, of the 7th year of the French Republic, one and indivisible. The Minister of Exterior Relations to Citizen Pichon,  
Secretary of Legation of the French Republic, near the  
Batavian Republic.  
I have received successively, citizen, your letters of the  
22d and 23d Fructidore. They afford me more and  
more reason to be pleased with the measure you have  
adopted to detail to me your conversations with Mr. Murray. These conversations, at first merely friendly, have  
acquired consistency by the sanction I have given to them,  
by my letter of the eleventh Fructidore. I do not regret  
that you have trusted to Mr. Murray’s honor a copy of  
my letter. It was intended for you only, and contains  
nothing but what is conformable to the intentions of government. I am thoroughly convinced that should explanations take place, with confidence, between the two Cabinets  
irritation would cease; a croud of misunderstandings would  
disappear; and the ties of friendship would be more strongly  
united, as each party would discover the hand which sought to disunite them. But I will not conceal from you that  
your letters of the 2d and 3d Vendimaire, just received,  
surprise me much. What Mr. Murray is still dubious of,  
has been very explicitly declared even before the President’s message to Congress, of the 3d Messidore, (21 of  
June) last, was known in France. I had written it to Mr.  
Gerry, namely, on the 24th Messidore, and the 4th  
Messidore. I did repeat it to him before he sat out. A  
whole paragraph of my letter to you of the 11th Fructidore, of which Mr. Murry has a copy, is devoted to develope still more the fixed determination of the French Republic. According to these bases you were right to assert  
that whatever Plenipotentiary the government of the United  
States might send to France, to put an end to the existing differences between the two countries, would be undoubtedly  
received with the respect due to the representative of a free,  
independent, and powerful nation. I cannot persuade myself, citizen, that the American Government need any further declarations from us to induce them, in order to  
renew the negociations, to adopt such measures as would  
be suggested to them, by their desire to bring the differences to a peaceable end. If misunderstandings on both  
sides have prevented former explanations from reaching  
that end, it is presumable that these misunderstandings  
being done away, nothing, henceforth, will bring obstacles to the reciprocal dispositions. The President’s instructions to his envoys at Paris, which I have only known  
by the copy given you by Mr. Murray, and received by me  
the 21st Messidore, (9th July) announce, if they contain  
the whole of the American government’s intentions, and  
dispositions, which could only have added to those which  
the directory has always entertained; and notwithstanding the posterior acts of that government, notwithstanding  
the irritating and almost hostile measures they have adopted, the Directory has manifested its perseverance in the  
sentiments which are deposited both in my correspondence  
with Mr. Gerry, and in my letter to you of the 11th  
Fructidore, and which I have herein before repeated in  
the most explicit manner. Carry, therefore, citizen, to Mr. Murray, those positive expressions, in order to convince him of our sincerity, and prevail upon him to transmit them to his government.  
I presume, citizen, that this letter will find you at the  
Hague; if not, I ask it may be sent back to you at Paris.Salute and fraternity,  
(Signed) Ch. Mau. Talleyrand.This letter was transmitted by Mr. Murray to the  
American government, and I own I am not acquainted  
with any words, either in the French or English language,  
which could have expressed in a more solemn, a more  
explicit, or a more decided manner assurances of all that  
I had demanded as conditions of negociation. How  
could I get rid of it, with honor, or even without infamy?  
If ever there was a regular diplomatic communication,  
this was one. The diplomatic organs were all perfect  
and complete. Mr. Pichon was well known at Philadelphia, where he had resided some years in a public employment in the family of the French ambassador, as a  
respectable man and a man of letters. He was now Secretary of Legation, held a commission from his sovereign  
as much as a minister plenipotentiary; and every secretary of legation in the absence of his principal minister,  
is, of course, Charge des affaires; and the acts of a  
Charge des affaires are as official, as legal and authentic,  
as those of an Ambassador Extraordinary.In what other manner could Mr. Talleyrand have  
transmitted the assurances demanded? He had communicated them to Mr. Gerry, but was desirous of sending  
them by another way, that he might increase the chances  
of their arrival. At war with England, he could not send  
them to Mr. King. If he had lent them to Madrid to  
Col. Humphreys, there was no probability of their arriving in America so soon as through Holland. If he had  
sent them to Berlin, to Mr. Adams, the course would  
have been still more circuitous and the probability much  
greater of long delay and uncertain arrival. If he had  
sent them to Mr. Smith, at Lisbon, there would have been the same difficulties. Of all the diplomatic organs,  
therefore in Europe, he chose the best, the shortest, the  
safest and the most certain.  
Mr. Gerry’s Letter to the Secretary of State, dated Nantasket Road, October the 1st, 1798, confirmed these assurances beyond all doubt, in my mind, and his conversations with me, at my own house, in Quincy, if any thing  
further had been wanting, would have corroborated the  
whole. As I have not a copy of that gentleman’s letter,  
if he should chance to read this paper, I ask the favor of  
him to publish copies of his letter and of Mr. Talleyrand’s  
letters to him, and, if he pleases, to repeat the assurances  
he gave me in conversation. This gentleman’s merit in  
this transaction was very great. They have been treated  
like all his other sacrifices, services and sufferings in the  
cause of his country.If, with all this information, I had refused to institute a  
negociation or had not persevered in it, aster it was instituted, I should have been degraded in my own estimation as a man of honor; I should have disgraced the nation I represented, in their own opinion and in the judgment of all Europe.

I HAVE received successively, citizen,

to detfeil to me your conversions with Mr.  
Murray. These convtrfatians at firft mere­

fantticn I have ijiven to tliem by my letters  
of the t ith Fruftidor. Ido not recprt that  
yen have trusted to Mr. Murray&#x27;s honour,

you only, and contained nothing but what  
is conformable to the intentions of govern­

as each party would discover the hand that  
fought to difunile them.  
  
But, I will cot conceal frofn you, that,  
your letters of the 2d and 3d Vendemaire,  
just received, lurpri7e me much. What  
Mr. Murray is still dubious of, has been  
explicitly declared, even before the Prefi.

py, is devoted to develripe still more the fix­  
ed determination of the French government  
according to these bases —You were right  
to aflert, that whatever plenipotentiary the  
government of the United States, might  
fend to France, to put an end to existing  
differences, between the two countries,  
would fee undoubtedly received, with the

I cannot citiaen conceive that the Ame­

If mifundenlandingg on both fides have

henceforth will bring ebftacles to the reci­  
pr cal dispositions. The President&#x27;s in­  
ftruftions to his envoys at Paris, which I  
have oijy known by the copy given you by

have &#x27;rusted to Mr. Murray&#x27;s honor

for you oidy, and contains nothing  
but what is conformable to the inten

which sought to disunite them. But I  
will not conceal from you that your  
letters of the 2d and 3d Vendemairc,  
just received, surprise me much.— j  
What Mr. Murray is still dubious of, !  
has been explicitly declared even be- !  
fore the President&#x27;s message to Con­  
gress of the 3d Messidore,(2l of June)  
last was known in France. I bad writ: en &#x27;  
it to Mr. Gerry, namely, on the twen­  
ty-fourth Messidore and the fourth  
Messidore. I did repeat it to him be­  
fore he set out. A whole paragraph  
of my letter to you of the 11th Fruc- ,  
of which Mr. Muvray has a  
copy, is devoted to develope still  
more the fixed determination of the  
French Republic. According to these  
bases you were right to assert that  
whatever Plenipotentiary the govern­  
ment of the United States might send  
to trante, to put an end to the. exist­  
ing differences between the two coun­  
tries, wou (! be undoubtedly received with  
the respect due to the representative of  
a. free, independent, and powerful nation.  
I cannot persuade myself, citizen, that j  
the American government need any  
further declarations from us to induce  
. in order to renew the negotia­  
tions, to adopt such measures as  
would be suggested to them, by their  
desire to bring the differences to a  
peaceable end, If misunderstandings  
on both sides have prevented former  
explanations from reaching that end,  
it is presumable that these misundcr­

:\c Directory has always

posterior arts of that government,  
notwithstanding the irritating and al­

its prescveiance in the sentiments  
which are. deposited both in my cor­  
respondence with Mr. Gerry, and in

This letter was transmitted by Mr.  
Murray to the American government,  
and I own 1 am not acquainted with  
j any words cither in the French or I  
; lish lai ffhich could haveexpres­  
| scdi, iolemn, a more explicit  
or a more decided manner a  
demande*  
  
conditions of negociation. How could  
I get rid of it, with honor, or even j  
. without infamy. If ever there was a  
regular diplomatic communication,  
this was one. The diplomatic organs  
were all perfect and complete. Mr.  
Pichon was well known ai Philadel  
phia, where he had resided some years  
in a public employment in the family  
of the French ambassador, as* r spec­  
table ma 8c a man of letters. He was  
now Secre ary of Legation, held a com­  
mission from his sovereign as much  
as a minister Plenipotentary ; and eve  
ry Secretary of Legation in the ab  
sence of his principal minister is, of  
course, Charge dcs affairs, 8c the acts  
of Charges dcs affairs are as offi­  
cial, as legal and authentic, as those of  
an ambassador extraordinary.  
In what other manner could Mr.  
Talleyrand have transmitted the II  
yes demanded ? He had com­  
municated them to Mr. Gerry, bat  
lesirous of sending them by ano­  
ther way, that he might increase the  
chances of their arrival. At war with  
England he could not send them to Mr.  
King. If he had sect them to Mad­  
rid to Coi. Humphreys, there was no  
probability of their arriving in America  
so soon as through Holland. If he­  
had sent them to Berlin to Mr Adams,  
the course would have been still i ore  
circuitous and the probability much  
greater of long delay and uncertain  
arrival, If he had sent them to Mr. I  
Smith, at Lisbon, there would have I  
been the same difficulties. Of all  
the diplomatic organs, therefore, in jj  
Europe, he chose the shortest, the  
i safest and most certain.  
Mr. Gerry&#x27;s letters to the Secretary  
jof State, dated Nantasket Road, Or  
tober, the Ist, 1798, confirmed these  
assurances beyond all doubt, in my  
&#x27; mind, and his conversations with me,  
at my own house, in Quincy, if any  
thing further had been wanting,  
would have corroborated the whole.  
As I have not a copy of that gentle­  
, man&#x27;s letter, if he should chance to  
! read this paper, I ask the favor of  
! him to publish copies of his letters  
and of Mr. Talleyrand&#x27;s letters to him,  
and, if he pleases, to repeat the  
sufances he gave me in conversation.  
This gentleman&#x27;s merit in this trans­  
action was very great. They have  
been treated like all his other sacrifi­  
ces, services and sufferings in the cause  
of his country. ,  
If with all this information, I had re­  
fused to institute a negociation or had  
i not persevered in it, after it was in-&#x27;  
stituled, I should have been degraded  
in my own estimation as a man of  
honor ; I should have disgraced the  
nation I represented, in their own  
opinion and in the judgment of i  
all Europe

This letter was transmitted by Mr. Murray to  
the American government, ami I own 1 am not

could 1 get rid of it with honor, or even without

ca so soon as through Holland. If lie had  
sent them to Berlin to Mr Adams, the  
course would have been still more cir. )  
cuitous a’-id the probability much greater of  
long delay and uncertain arrival. If he  
hud sent them to Mr‘Smith, at Lisbon,  
there w; u!d have been the same difficul­  
ties. Of all the diplomatic organs, there­  
fine, in Europe, h« chose the shortest, the  
safest and most certain. •  
Mr Gerry’s letters to the Secretary of  
State, dated Nantasket Road, October the  
1st, 1798, confirmed these assurances be­  
yond all doubt,in my M nd Sc his conversa­

«uuiu nave corrouoraiea tne whole. As  
I have not a copy of that gentleman&#x27;s let­

letters to him, and, if h. pleases, to re,  
peat the assurncea he gave me in conver­  
sation. This gen tie man’s merit in &#x27;this  
transaction was very great. They have  
been treated like all Ins other sacrifices, (

country.

Sirs From Mf. Mur:ay, the Ame­  
rican minister at the Hague, who had  
been appointed byj President Washing­  
ton, I received assurances from the  
French government similar to those  
in Mr. Barlow&#x27;s letter and so many 6­  
thers. They were conveyed from the  
French directory to Mr. Pichon, secre  
tary of legation and charge des Affaires  
of the French republic, near the 3ata  
vun republic, in the absence of the  
French Ambassador, by him officially  
communicated to Mr. Murray, &quot;and by  
him to the executive of the U. States.  
Fhe communication was in these words :

The minister of exterior relations to citizen  
PiXHONj&#x27;Secretary of legation of the French  
repuauc, near me uaiavian repuouc--I  
have received successtv &#x27;ly, citizen,  
your letters of the 22d and 23d Fructi-  
dore. They afford me more and more  
reason to be pleased with the measures  
you have adop&#x27;ed, to detail to me your  
conversations with Mr. Murr ay. I he  
conversations, at nrst merely tnendly,  
have acquired consistency, by the sanc  
tion I have given to them, by my letter  
of the 11th Fructidore. I do not re  
gret that you have trusted to Mr. Mur  
ray&#x27;s honot a copy of my letter. It was  
intended for you only, and. contains no  
thing but what is conformable to the in  
tentions ol government. I am tho­  
roughly convinced that should explana­  
tions take place, with t confidence, be­  
tween the two cabinets, irritation would  
rease ; a crotru oi misunderstandings  
would disappear ; and the ties of ft &amp;nd-7j  
ship would be more strongly united, as  
each party ; would I discover the hand  
which sought to disunite them. But I  
will not conceal from you, that your let-  
er of 2d and 3d Vendimairt, just re-  
:eived surprise mc much. AVhat Mr.  
Murray is slill dubious of, has been ve-  
ty expnciiiy aeciarea even oeiore tne  
President&#x27;s message ,to Congress, of the  
3d Messidore (2 1st&quot; of -June) last, was  
known in France, i I,had written it to  
Mr. Gerry, namely, orj the 24th Messf-  
dore, and the 4th Messidore. IdidTe-  
i  
peat it to him before he sat out. A  
whole paragraph of my letter to vou of  
the 1 1th Fitictidore, of which Mr. Mur  
ray has a-4fopyf is devoted to develope  
still more the fixed determination- of  
the French republic. According tfi  
these bases you were right to assert,  
that &#x27; whatever plenipotentiary, the g-  
vernment of the United States micht  
end to France, ttput;an end to the ex  
isting differences between the two coun-.  
tries, would be undoubtedly received  
wi h the respect due to the representa­  
tive of a free, independent, and power  
ful nation. . &#x27; - - &#x27;  
1 cannot&quot; persuade myself, citizen,  
hat the American igovernihent need a-  
iy further, declarations&quot; from us tqrin-  
duce them, in-order to renew the&#x27;nei  
gociationff, to adopt such measures as&quot;  
would be suggested to themf by their  
desire to bring the difterencesvto a4  
peaceable end. If misundeTbtaridings  
on both sides have&#x27; prevented Jtormer  
explanations from peaching thai end; it  
is presumable that these misunderstand­  
ings being done away; nothing, itence-

it to him before he fat out. A whole  
paragraph of my letter to you of the  
1 Ith Fru&amp;idore, of which Mr. Mur­

fill more the sized determination of  
the French Republic. According to

that awhatevor Plemipotentiary the gov­

be suggested to them, by their desire  
to bring the differences to a peac#ble

could only have added to those which  
the directory has always entertained 3

has manitfelted its perfeverence in the  
sentiments which are depcfited both  
in my correspondence with Mr. Ger­  
ry, and in my letter to you of the  
ilth Fru&amp;idore, and which I have  
herein before repeated in the mofl ex­  
plicit manner. Carry, therefore, cit=  
izen, o Mr. Murray, those positive  
expreflions, in order to conviuce him  
of our sincerity, and prevail upon him  
to tran{mit them to his government.  
I presume, citizen, that this letter  
will find you at the Hague ; if not,  
I ask it may be fert back to&quot; you at

This letter was transmitted by Mr.  
Murray tothe American government,  
and [ own I am not acquainted with  
any words, either in the French or  
Eaglith language; which could have  
exprefled in 2 more solemn, a 2 more  
explicit, or 2 more decided mannes  
aflurances of all that I had demand­  
ed as conditions of negociation, How  
could I get rid of it, with honor, of  
even without infamy ? If ever there  
was a regular diplomatic communi­  
cation, this was one. The diplomat­  
ic organs were all perfe® and com­  
plete. Mr. Pichon was well known  
at Philadelphia, where Be had resided  
some yearsin a public employment in  
the family of the French ambaflador,  
as a relpeétable man and a man of  
‘letters. He was now Secretary of  
Legation, held a commission from his  
sovereign as much as a minister ple­  
‘nipotentiary ; and every secretary of  
legation in the absence of his principal  
minilter, is, of course, Charge des af­  
faires ; and the a&amp;s of a Charge des  
affaires are as official, as legal and an­  
thentic, as thole of an Ambassador  
Extraordinary. . = N  
la what other manuer could Mr.  
Talleyrand have transmitted the affura  
ances defnand&#x27;cd ? He had communi­  
_cated them to Mr. Gerry, but was de­  
sirous of fending them by another way  
_that he might increase the chances of  
their arrival. At war with England,  
_he could not fend them to Mr. King.  
If he had sent them to Madrid to Col.  
Humphreys, there was no probability  
of their arfiving in. America so soon  
~as through 56?13@; ~ If he had sent  
“them to Berlin to Mr. Adams, the  
course would have been still more cir­  
~cuitous and the probability &#x27; much  
_greater of long delay and uncertain
