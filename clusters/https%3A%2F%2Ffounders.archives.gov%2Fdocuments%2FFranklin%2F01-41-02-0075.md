I have nothing material to write to you respecting public affairs, but I cannot let Mr Adams who will see you go without a line, to enquire after your welfare, to inform you of mine, &amp; to assure you of my constant respect and attachment.  
I think with you that our quaker article is a good one &amp; that men will in time have sense enough to adopt it, but I fear that time is not yet come.  
What wd you think of a proposition, if I shd make it of a family compact between England France &amp; America? America wd be as happy as the Sabine Girls, if she cd be the means of  
  
uniting in perpetual peace her father &amp; her husband. (What repeated follies are these repeated Wars!

The discoveries of Franklin belong to universal science and are a bril-  
liant legacy to all nations. And it may be well at this time to recall to  
your memories a letter written by him in 1783 to an English Functionary,  
in which speaking of the Revolutionary War, he says, “What repeated  
follies are these repeated wars! How many excellent things might have  
been done to promote the eternal welfare of each country! What bridges,  
roads, canals, and other public works and institutions tending to the com-  
mon felicity, might have been made and established with the money and
