I had the honor of receiving your letter covering one from Judge Woodward, on which you desire my opinion on the several points therein stated.  
Opinion  
By the 2nd. section of the act constituting the territory of Michigan, it is declared “That there shall be established in the said Territory a Goverment in all respects similar to that provided by the Ordinance of Congress passed on the 13th. day of July 1787 for the goverment &amp;c,” and by an act passed on the 7th. day of August 1789 intitled “an Act &amp;ce.” By this section alone, the above mentioned ordinance, and act of Congress, would form the exclusive code, on which the Goverment of the Territory of Michigan would rest, &amp; consequently the provisions of the act of the 8th. of May 1792 would not apply. But the 3. §. of this act extends the powers of the Goverment of Michigan &amp; declares, “that the Officers of the said territory, shall respectively exercise the same powers, perform the same duties, and receive for their services, the same compensations, as by the ordinance aforesaid, and the laws of the U. States have been provided &amp; established for similar officers in the Indiana territory.” This section being transcribed from the 3 §. of the act constituting the Indiana territory (5 vol. 140), and that section investing the officers of Indiana with all the powers possessed by the officers of the  
  
territory North west of the River Ohio, consequently so much of the act of the 8. May 1792 as prescribes duties or confers powers on the Off

declared to be a horrid outrage upon the rights of poor

It is not a true version. Michigan was made a Territory  
by the act of 11th June, 1805 ; the second section of  
which says:  
&quot;There slnll be established within said Territory a govkrnmknt

of Congress, passed on the 13th of J uly, 1787, for  
the government of the territory of tho United States northwest  
of the river Ohio; and an ne.t of the 7th of August,  
1789.&quot;  
This latter act of August 7, 17^0, defines nothing in  
regard to the powers of the governor. Resort, to determine  
his powers, must be made to the ordinance of 1787.  
It says:  
&quot;The governor and judgbs, or a majority ok thi:m, shall  
adopt and publish in the diitrict [of Michigan] lucli lawt of  
the original State*, criminal and civil, a* map be neeeuarp
