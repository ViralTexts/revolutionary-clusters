** Nothing has occurred here since the date of my public despatches (the  
** 17th) to give our business an aspect more favourable than it then had; but  
** on the other hand I have come to the knowledge of two facts, which I  
** think sufficiently show the decided character of the emperor’s policy with  
‘*‘ regard to us. These are, first,—that in a council of administration held a  
** few days past, when it was proposed to modify the operation of the de-  
** crees of November 1806, and December‘1807 (though the proposition was  
** supported by the whple weight of the council) he became highly indig-  
**nant, and declared that these decrees should suffer no change—and that the  
** Americans should be compelled to take the positive character of either  
** allies or enemies; 2d, that on the 27th of January last, twelve days after  
‘* Mr. Champagny’s written assurances, that these decrees should work na  
** change in the property sequestered until our discussions with England were  
** brought to a close, and seven days before he reported to me verbally these  
** very assurances, the emperor had by a special decision confiscated two of  
** our vessels and their cargoes (the Junius Henry and Juniata) for want  
** merely of a document, not required by any law or usage of the commerce  
**in which they had been engaged. This act was taken as I am informed on  
‘* a general ret. t of sequestered cases, amounting to one hundred and sixty, and  
  
*‘ which, at present prices, will yield upwards of one hundred millions of  
  
*¢ franks, a sum whose magnitude alone renders hopeless all attempts at saving  
**it—Danes, Portuguese and Americans, will be the principal sufferers.—  
“If 1 am right in supposing the emperor has definitively taken his ground.  
** I cannot be wrong in concluding that you will immediately take yours.”
