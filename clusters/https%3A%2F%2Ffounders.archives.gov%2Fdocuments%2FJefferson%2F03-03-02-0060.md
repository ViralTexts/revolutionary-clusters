Sir  
Monticello Sep. 20. 10.  
  
Your favor of the 14th has been duly recieved, &amp; I have to thank you for the many obliging things respecting myself which are said in it. if I have left in the breasts of my fellow citizens a sentiment of satisfaction with my conduct in the transaction of their business it will soften the pillow of my repose thro’ the residue of life.  
The question you propose, Whether circumstances do not sometimes occur which make it a duty in officers of high trust to assume authorities beyond the law, is easy of solution in principle, but sometimes embarrasing in practice. a strict observance of the written laws is doubtless one of the high duties of a good citizen: but it is not the highest. the laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation. to lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to written law, would be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty, property &amp; all those who are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly sacrificing the end to the means.  when, in the battle of Germantown, Genl Washington’s army was annoyed from Chew’s house, he did not hesitate to plant his cannon against it, altho’ the property of a citizen.  when he besieged Yorktown, he levelled the suburbs, feeling that the laws of property must be postponed to the safety of the nation.  while that army was before York, the Govr of Virginia took horses, carriages, provisions &amp; even men, by force, to enable that army to stay together till it could master the public enemy; &amp; he was justified. a ship at sea in distress for provisions meets another having abundance, yet refusing a supply; the law of self preservation authorises the distressed to take a supply by force. in all these cases the unwritten laws of necessity, of self-preservation, &amp; of the public safety controul the written laws of meum &amp; tuum. farther to exemplify the principle I will state an hypothetical case.  suppose it had been made known to the Executive of the union in the autumn of l805. that we might have the Floridas for a reasonable sum, that that sum had not indeed been so appropriated by law, but that Congress were to meet within three weeks, and might appropriate it on the first or second day of their session. ought he, for so great an advantage to his country, to have risked himself by transcending the law, and making the purchase? the public advantage offered, in this supposed case was indeed immense: but a reverence for law, and the probability that the advantage might still be legally accomplished by a delay of only 3. weeks, were powerful reasons against hazarding the act.—but suppose it foreseen that a John Randolph would find means to protract the proceeding on it by Congress until the ensuing spring, by which time new circumstances would change the mind of the other party. ought the Executive, in that case, and with that foreknolege, to have secured the good to his country, and  and to have trusted to their justice for the transgression of the law. I think he ought, and that the act would have been approved.—after the affair of the Chesapeak we thought war a very possible result. our magazines were illy provided with some necessary articles, nor had any appropriations been made for their purchase. we ventured however to provide them and to place our country in safety, and stating the case to Congress they sanctioned the act.  
To proceed to the conspiracy of Burr, &amp; particularly to Genl Wilkinson’s situation in N. Orleans. in judging this case we are bound to consider the state of the information, correct &amp; incorrect, which he then possessed. he expected Burr &amp; his band from above, a British fleet from below, and he knew there was a formidable conspiracy within the city. under these circumstances, was he justifiable 1. in seising notorious conspirators? on this there can be but two opinions; one, of the guilty &amp; their accomplices the other, that of all honest men. 2. in sending them to the seat of government when the written law gave them a right to trial in the territory? the danger of their rescue, of their continuing their machinations, the tardiness and weakness of the law, apathy of the judges, active patronage of the whole tribe of lawyers, unknown disposition of the juries, an hourly expectation of the enemy, salvation of the city, and of the Union itself, which would have been convulsed to it’s center, had that conspiracy succeeded, all these constituted a law of necessity &amp; self preservation, and rendered the salus populi supreme over the written law. the officer who is called to act on this superior ground, does indeed risk himself on the justice of the controuling powers of the constitution, and his station makes it his duty to incur that risk. but those controuling powers, and his fellow citizens generally, are bound to judge according to the circumstances under which he acted. they are not to transfer the information of this place or moment to the time &amp; place of his action: but to put themselves into his situation.we knew here that there never was danger of a British fleet from below, &amp; that Burr’s band was crushed before it reached the Missisipi. but Genl Wilkinson’s information was very different, and he could act on no other.  
From these examples &amp; principles you may see what I think on the question proposed. they do not go to the case of persons charged with petty duties, where consequences are trifling, and time allowed for a legal course, nor to authorise them to take such cases out of the written law. in these the example of overleaping the law is of greater evil than a strict adherence to it’s imperfect provisions. it is incumbent on those only who accept of great charges, to risk themselves on great occasions, when the safety of the nation, or some of it’s very high interests are at stake. an officer is bound to obey orders: yet he would be a bad one who should do it in cases for which they were not intended, and which involved the most important consequences. the line of discrimination between cases may be difficult; but the good officer is bound to draw it at his own peril, &amp; throw himself on the justice of his country and the rectitude of his motives.  
I have indulged freer views on this question on your assurances that they are for your own eye only, and that they will not get into the hands of newswriters. I met their scurrilities without concern while in pursuit of the great interests with which I was charged. but in my present retirement no duty forbids my wish for quiet.  
  
Accept the assurances of my esteem &amp; respect

MONTICELLO, sEPT 20, 1810.  
Sir—Your favor of the 14th, has been duly  
received, and I have to thank you for the ‘many  
obliging things respecting inyself which are  
eaid in lit. If I have left in the breasts of m  
fellow-citizens a sentiment of satistaction witg  
my conduct in the transaction of their business,  
it will soften the pillow of my repose through  
the residue of life.  
  
The question you propose, whether circum- |  
stances do not sometimes occur which make it &#x27;  
a daty 1n officers of high trust to assume au- |  
therities beyond the law, is easy of solution in |  
principle, but sometimes embarrassing in prac- |  
tice. A strict observance of the written laws is |  
doubtless one of the high duties of a good citi­  
zen : but it is not the kighesi. The laws of ne- |  
cessitﬂ, of self-prescrvation, of saving our coun- |  
try when in danger, are of higher obligation.— |  
T&#x27;o lose our country by a scrupulous adherence |  
to written law, would-be to lose the law itself, &#x27;  
.with life, liberty, property, and all those who  
are enjoying them with usj thus absurdly sacri- |  
ficing the end to the means. Whoun in the bat- 1  
tle of Germantown, General Washington’s army  
was annoyed from Chew’s house, he did not  
hesitate to plant his cannon a%ainst it, alilmuagh .  
the property of a citizen. When he besieged’  
k Tawn, he levelled the suburbs, feeling  
the laws of property must be postponed to  
e safety of the nation. While that army was  
before York, the Governor of Virginia took  
horses, carriages, provisions, and even men, by  
fbice, to enable that army to stay together till  
it could master the public enemy; and he was  
justified. A ship at sea, in distress for provi­  
sions, meats another havin% abundance, yet refus­  
ing a supply ; the law of self-preservation author­  
izes the distressed to take a supply by force. In  
all these cases the unwritten laws of necessity, of  
&quot; self-preservation, and of public safety, coutrol  
the wrijgen laws of meum and tuum. Further  
to exemplify the principle, I will state an hypo­  
thetical case. Suppose it had been made known  
#o the Executive ofP:he Union in the autumn of  
1808, that we might have the Floridas for a rea­  
gonable sum, that that sum had not indeed been  
so appropriated by gw, but that Congress were  
to meet within three weeks, and might appro­  
priate it on the first or second day of their ses­  
‘sion. Ought he for so great an advantage to  
his country, to have risked himself by transcend­  
;i\%the law, and making the purchase? The  
public advan‘age offercd,in thig supposed case  
was ggqed ; imm’ensig bu:ks’ ;-e;rierence for lag,  
nd the “probability that the advantage might  
% b;&amp;-‘lwmwwa delay of only  
  
thrée woeks, were powerful reasens against  
hazarding the act,. But suppose it foreseen that  
| @M% EEsßeoox would find means to protract  
tha proceeding on it by Congress, until thie en­  
‘ suing Spring, by which time new circumstances  
wouﬁi change the iaind of the other party.  
Ought the Executive,iri that case, and with that  
forcknov\}ledge, to have secured the good to his  
country,and to Liave trusted to their justice for  
the transgression of the ldw ? I think he ought,  
and that the act would have been approved.  
after the affair of the Chesapeake, we thought  
war a very possible result. Our magazines were  
illy provided with some necessary articles; nor  
- had any appropriations been made for their pur­  
~chase.” We ventured, however, to provide them  
~and toplace our country in-safety, and stating  
the case to Congress, they sarictioned the act.  
To proceed to the conspiracy of Burr, and  
particularly to Gen. Wilkins_qri&#x27;s_ situation in  
New-Orleans. In judging this case we are  
bound to consider the state of the information,  
correct and incorrect, which He then possessed.  
He expected Burr and his band from above,a  
British fleet froni below, and he knew there was  
a formidable conspiracy within the city. Under  
these circumstances, wis he justifiable. Ist. In  
Seizing notorious conspirators? On this there  
can be but two epinions; one, of the guilty and  
their accomplices; the other, that of alyl ho­  
nest men. 2d. Sending them to the seat of  
government when the ;rittcxl law gave them a  
vight to trial in the territory ? The danger of  
their rescue, of their continuing in their machi­  
nations, the tardiness and weakness of the law,  
apathy of the Judges, active patronage of the  
whole tribe of lawyers, unkndwn disposition of  
the juries, an hourly expestation of the enemy,  
salvation of the city, and of the Union itself,  
which would have beep convulsed to its centre,  
had that conspiracy succeeded, all these consti- {  
tuted a law of necessity and self-preservation,  
and rendered the salus populi supremie over the  
written law. The otl;&#x27;xcer who is called to  
act on this superior ground, does indeed risk  
himself on the justice «f the controlling powers  
of the Constitution, and his station makes it his  
duty to incur that risk. Eut those controlling  
powers, and his fellow ciilens generally, are  
bound to judge aceording to the circumstances  
under which he acted. They s not to trandfer  
the information of this place or wioment to the  
time and place of his action: but to put them­  
selves into his situation. We know hsre that  
there never was danger of a British fleet. from be­  
low,and th~t Barr’s band was erushed hefore it  
reached the Mississippi. But Gen. Wilkinzon&#x27;s  
information was very different, and he could act  
on no other.  
  
From these examples and principles, you may  
sce what 1 tlink on the question proposed.—  
They do&#x27;not go to the case of persons charged  
with petty duties, where consequences are tri­  
fling, and time nallowed for a legal course, nor  
to authorizs thom to take such cases out of the  
written law. In these the example of overleap­  
ing the law is of greater cvil thap a strict adhe­  
rence to its imper%ect provisions. It is incumn­  
bent on those only who accept of great charges  
to risk themselves on great occasions, when the  
safety of the nation, or some of its very high in­  
terests arc at stake. An officer is bound to obey  
orders: yet he would be 2 bad one who should  
do it in cases for which thoy were not intended,  
and which involved the most iinportant consc­  
quences. The linsof discrimination hetween  
cases may be difficult; but the onod officer is  
bound to draw it at his own peril, and throw  
himself on the justice of his country and the rec­  
titude of his motives. :  
i 1 bave indulged freer views on this question  
on your assuranees that they are for your own  
eye only, and that they will.not get int the  
hands of newswriters. 1 met their scurrilities  
without cancern, while in purzuit of the great  
interests with which I was charged ; but in my  
present retivement, no duty forbids my wish for  
qufet. - :  
Accept the asgurances of my esteem and . res­  
pect. : TH : JEFFIRSON

“To proceed to the conspiracy of Burr, and particularly to  
General Wilkinson’s situation in New Orleans. In judging  
this case, we are bound to consider the state of the information  
correctand incorrect, which he then possessed. He expected  
Burr and his band from above,a British fleet from below, and  
he knew there was a formidable conspiracy within the city.  
Under these circumstances, was he justifiable, lst. In seizing  
notorious conspirators, On this there can be but two opinions:  
one, of the — and their accomplices; the other, that of all  
honest men. 2d. Sending them to the seat of government,  
when the written law gavethem a right totrial in the Terri-  
tory?’ The danger of their rescue; of continuing the machina-  
tions; the tardine§Ss and weakness of the law; apathy of the  
judges; active patronage of the whole tribe of lawyers; unknown  
dispositions of the juries; an hourly expectation of the enemy;  
salvation of the city, and of the Union itself, which would have  
been convulsed to its centre, had that conspiracy succeeded—all  
these constituted a law of necessity and self-preservation, and  
rendered the salus populi supreme over the written law. The  
officer who is called to act on this superior ground, does indeed  
risk himself on the justice of the controlling powers of the Con-  
stitution, and his station makes it his duty to incur that risk.  
But those controlling powers, and his fellow-citizens generally, -  
are bound to judge according tothe circumstances under which  
he acted. They are not to transfer the information of thie place,  
or moment, to the time and place of this action; but to put them-  
selvesinto his situation. We know here that there never was  
danger of a British fleet from below, and that Burr’s band was  
crushed before itreached the Mississippi. But General Wil-  
kinson’s information was very different, and he could act on no  
other.  
  
“From these examples and principles you may see what I  
think on the question proposed. They do not goto the case of  
persona charged-with petty duties, where consequences are  
trifling, and ume allowed for a legal course, nor to authorize  
them to take such cases out of the written law. In these the ex-  
ample of overleaping the law is of greater evil than a strict ad-  
herence to its imperfect provisions. It is incumbent on those  
only who accept of great charges, to risk themselves on great  
occasions, when the safety of the nation or some of its very  
high interestsare at stake. An officer is bound to obey orders;  
yet he would be a bad one who should do it in cases for which  
they were not intended, and which involved the most important  
consequences. The line ofdiscrimination between cases may  
be difficult, but the good officer is bound to draw it at his own  
peril, and throw himself on the justice of his country and the  
rectitude of his motives.”

0716 f the high duties of a good citizen but it is   
not the hig,hest. The laws of necessity, of calf   
preservation,of saving our country when in dan­

by a scrupulous adherende to written law, would   
be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty, proper­  
ty, and and all those who are enjoying them with   
us; thus ohs-artily sacrificing Me end to the   
means. When, in the battle of Germantown,   
General Washington&#x27;s army was annoyed from   
Chew&#x27;s hones, he did not hesitate to plant his can­  
non against it, although the property of a citizen   
When he besieged Yorktown, he levelled the =-  
barbs, feeling that the laws of property must be   
postponed to the safety of the nation. While the   
army was before York, the Governor of Virginia   
took horses, carriages, provisions, and even men,   
be fore*, to enable that army to stay together

justified, A ship at sea in distress for provisions,

the distressed to take a supply by force In all   
these oases, the unwritten laws of necessity, of   
self-preservation, and of the public safety, control   
the written laws of invent. and tuum. Farther to   
exemplify the principle, I will state an hypotheti­  
cal ease. Suppose it had been made known to the   
Knontive of the Union in the autumn of 1805, that   
we might have the Florides for a reasonable sum,   
that that sum had not indeed been so appropriated   
by law, but that Congress were to meet within three   
weeks, and might appropriate it on the first or se­  
bond day of their session. Ought he, for se great   
an advantage to his country, to have risked him­  
ielf by transcending the law and making the pur­  
abase ? The public advantage offered, in this sup•   
oared osse, was indeed immense : but a reverence   
for law, and the probability that the advantage   
might still be legally accomplished by a delay of   
only three weeks, were powerful reasons against   
bezudingtne act. But suppose it foreseen that a   
John Randolph would find means to protract the   
proceeding on it by Congress, until the ongoing   
spring, by which time new oiroumstanoes would   
change the mind of the other party. Ought the   
Executive, in that case, and with that foreknow.   
ledge, to have secured the good to his oodetry, end   
to have trusted to their justice fee the trangression   
of the Jaw? I think he ought, and that the sot   
would have been approved. After the affair of the   
Chesapeake, we thought war a very possible re­  
wilt. Oar magazines were illy provided with some   
necessary articles, nor had.any appropriations been   
made for their purchase. We ventured, however,   
to provide them&#x27;   
and to place our country in seni­  
or ; and stating the use. to Congress, they sanc­  
tioned the eel.   
&quot; To prooeed to the conspiracy of Burr, and parti­  
cularly to General Wilk ineon&#x27;a situation in Hew Or­  
leans. In judging this case, we are bound to con-,   
eider the state of the information, correct and in   
correct, which he then poeseesed. He expected   
Burr and his band from above, a British fleet from   
below, and he knew there wag a formidable con­  
spiracy within the city. Under these oiroumetaneeS,   
was hejuetillable, let, in seizing -notorious con­

other, that of all honest wen. 21. In sending   
theta to the seat of government, when the written   
taw gave them a right to trial in the territory ?   
The danger of their rescue, of their oontinning   
their inaoninatione, the tardiness and weaknese of   
the law, apathy of the judges, active patronage of   
the whole tribe of lawyers, unknown disposition of   
the juries, and hourly expectation of the enemy,   
salvation of the city, and-of the Union itself,   
*blob would have been convulsed to He centre,   
bad that conspiracy succeeded; all these consti­  
tuted a law of necessity and self presertation.   
and rendered the salus pofrulz supreme over the   
written late. The officer who is called to ant on   
this superior grotind, does, indeed. risk himself on   
the justice of the controlling powers of the Condi   
tution,. and his station makes it hie duty to them&#x27;   
that risk. Bat those controlling powers, and his   
fellow-oitizens generally, are bound to judge so   
cording to the inroametanoee under which he acted.   
They are not to transfer the informative of this place   
or moment to the time and piece of his action ; but   
to put themselves into his Situation. We know   
here that them never was danger of a British fleet   
from below, and that Burr&#x27;s band was crushed be­  
fore it reached the Mississippi. But General Wilk­  
inson&#x27;s information was very different, and be   
could actors no other.   
&quot; From these examples and principles, you may   
see what I think on the question proposed. They do   
not go to the ease of persons charged with petty &amp;i­  
-sles, where consequences aro trifling, and time al­  
lowed for a legal coarse, nor to authorise them to   
_take such cams out of the written law. In these,   
ha example of overleaping the law is of greater   
evil than a strict adherence to its imperfect pro­  
visions. It ie incumbent on those only who accept   
-nf great charges, to risk themselves on groat ec   
melons, when the safety of the nation, or some of   
its very high interests are at stake. An officer is   
bound to obey orders ; yet he would be a bad one   
who should do le in oases for which they were not   
intended, and which involved the most important   
consequences. The line of discrimination between   
cases may be difficult; bat the good officer is   
bound to draw it at his own peril, and throw him­  
self on the justice-of his country and the rectitude   
of his motives.   
&quot;I have indulged freer mews on this question.,   
On your assurances that they are for your own eye   
only, :and that they will not get into the hands of   
newewriters.&quot;

enced to perpetrate any such acts of folly,  
or he will not be able to redeem his pledge  
to the President, the Cabinet and the coun­  
try.-N. Y. Cour, and Eny.  
  
Laws or NecEssIrr. The Philadelphia Pres  
publishes the following extract from a letter  
of Thomas Jefferson, which has a bearing on  
the habeas corpus argument of Chief Justice  
Taney. The great Virginia statesman main­  
tained at the period the extremest views of  
the inviolable character of the writ of habeas  
corpus. The extract is taken from a letter  
to J. B. Colvin, written Sept 10, 1810:  
The question you propose, whether circum­  
stances do not sometimes occur which make  
it a duty in officers of high trust to assume  
authorities beyond the law, is easy of solution  
in principle, but sometimes emibarrassing in  
practice. A strict observance of the written  
law is doubtless one of the high dutics of a  
good citizen; but it is not the highest. The  
laws of necassity, of self-preservation, of save  
ing our country when in danger, are of higher  
obligation. To lose our country by a scru­  
pulous adherence to written law, would be to  
lose the law itself, with life, liberty, property.  
and all those who are enjoying them with us;  
thus absurdly sacrificing the end to the means.  
When in the battle of Germantown, Gen­  
eral Washington&#x27;s army was annoyed from  
Chew&#x27;s house, he did not hesitate to plant his  
cannon against it, although the property of a  
citizen. When he besieged Yorktown, he  
levelled the suburbs, feeling that the laws of  
property must be postponed to the safety of  
the nation. While the army was before York  
the Governer of Virginia took horses, car­  
riages, provisions, and even men, by force, to  
enable that army to stay together till it could  
master the public enemy; and he was justified.  
A ship at sca in distress for provisions, meets  
another having abundance, yet refusing a  
supply; the law of self-preservation author­  
izes the distressed to take a supply by force.  
In all these cases, the unwritten laws of ne­  
cessity, of self-preservation, and of the public  
safety, control the written laws of meum and  
fuum.

Transcript has the following from a corres­

&quot;A most exciting scene transpired at the  
New Hampshire encampment Saturday after­  
noon, while the firing at Arlington Heights  
was going on. The regiment was drawn up  
about the chaplain, Rev. Mr. Abbott, who

To proceed to tho conspiracy of Burr, and par-  
ticularly to Gen. Wilkinson’s situation in New

consider the state of the information, correct and  
incorrect, which he then possessed. He expected  
Burr and his band from above, a British fl et from  
below, and he knew there was a formidable con-

plices;&#x27; tho other, that of all honeU men.  
2d. : In sending them to the seat of Govern-  
ment when the written law gave them a right to  
trial in the Teiritorj? The danger of their res-  
cue, of their continuing their machinations, the  
tardiness and weakness of tho law, apathy of the  
fudges, active patronage of tho whole tribe of  
lawyers, unknown disposition of tho juries, an  
hourly expectation cf the cnemv, salvation of  
the city, and of the Union itself, which would  
have been convulsed to its centre had that con-  
spiracy succeedi d; all these constituted a la w of  
necessity and self preservation, and renderod the  
sal us populi supremo over the written law. The  
officer who is called to act on tbte superior ground  
does indeed ri?k himself on the justice of the con-  
trolling powers of tho constitution, and his station  
makes it his duty to incur that risk. But tbo^e  
controlling powers, ard his follow-citizens gener-  
ally, are bound to judge according to tho circum-  
stances under which he acted. They are not to  
transfor tho information of this place or moment  
to tho time and place of his action; but to put  
themselves into bis situation. We knew here  
that there never was danger of a British fleet  
from i*elow, and that Burr’s band was crushed  
bftfaro it reached the Mississippi. Bit General  
Wilkinson’s information was very different, and  
he c uld act on no other.  
  
From tho^e examples and principle?, you may  
*ee what 1 think on the question proposed. They  
do not go to tho caso of persons charged with  
petty duties, where eon?equsnces are trifling, and  
time allowed for a legal courso, nor to authorize  
thorn to take such cases out of the written law.  
In these the example of overleapmg the law is of  
greater evil than a strict adherence to its imper-  
fect provisions. It is incumbent on those only  
who accept of groat charges, to risk thunselvos  
on groat occasions, when ihe safety of the nation  
or some of its very high interests aro at stake.  
An officer i* bound to obey order?; vat ho would  
be a bad one who fhonld do it in cases for which  
they wore not intended, and which involved tho  
most important consequences. The lino of dis-  
crimination between cases may be difficult, but  
the goed officer is bound to draw it at his own  
peril, aud throw himself on the justice of fps  
country and the rectitude of bis motive?.  
  
1 have indulged freer views on this question on  
your assurance* that they are for vour own eye  
only, and that they will not get into the hands of

; &quot;The question y on propose, whether  
circumstances do not sometimes occur  
which make it a duty in officers of high  
trust to assume authorites beyond the  
law, is easy of solution in principle, but  
sometimes embarrassing in practice. A  
strict observance ot the written laws is  
doubtless one of the high duties of a  
geod citizen; but it is not the highest.  
iThe laws of necessity, of self preserva  
tion, 01 saT-oar country when in dan  
ger, are of higher obligation. To lose  
our country by scrupulous adherence to  
written law, would be to lose the law  
itself with, life, liberty, property, and  
al those who are enjoying them with  
us: thus absurdly sacrificing the end to the  
means. When, in the battle of German-  
town, General Washington&#x27;s army was  
annoyed from Chew&#x27;s house, he did not  
hesitate to plant his cannon against it,  
although the property of a citizen.  
When he besieged Yorktown, he levelled  
the suburbs, feeling that the laws of  
property must be postponed to the safety  
ot the nation. While the army was be­  
fore Yoik, the Governor of Virginia  
took horses, carriages, provisions, and  
even men by force, to enable that army  
to stay together till it could master the  
public enemy; and he was justified. A  
ship at sei in distress for provisions,  
meets another having abundance, yet re­  
fusing a supply; the law ofself-preservation,  
authorizes the distressed to take  
a supply by force. In all these cases,  
the unwritten laws of necessity, of self­  
preservation, and of the public safety  
control the written laws of ?neum tuum.  
&quot;To proceed to the conspiracy of  
Burr, and particularly to General Wilk­  
inson&#x27;s situation in New Orleans. In  
judging this case, we are bound to con  
sider the state of the information, cor­  
rect and incorrect, which he then pos  
sessed, lie expected Burr and Ins band  
from above, a British fleet from below,  
and he knew there was a formidable  
conspiracy within the city. Under  
these circumstances, was he justifiable,  
1st in seizing notorious conspirators?  
On this there can be but two opinions,  
one of the guilty and their accomplices;  
the other that of all honest men. 2nd. In

ted a law of necessity and self-preservation,  
aim ri-uuereu ine p&#x27;itiuu supreme over  
the written law. The officer who is called  
to act on this superior ground does indeed  
risk himself on the justice of the controlling  
powers of the Constitution, and his station  
makes it his duty to incur that risk. But  
thre controlling powers, and bisfellow-citizens  
generally, are bound to judge according;  
to the circumstances under which he acted.  
They are not to transfer the information of  
place of his action : but to put themselves  
into his situation. We knew here that there  
never was danger of a British fleet from be­  
low, and that Burr&#x27;s band was crushed be­  
fore it reached the .Mississippi. But General  
Wilkinson&#x27;s information was very different,  
and he could act on no other.  
From these examples and principles. yot(  
may see what I think on the questions pro­  
posed. They do not goto the case of persons  
charged with petty duties, where consequen­  
ces are trifling and time allowed for a legal  
course, nor to authorize them to take such  
cases out ofthe written law. In these, the  
example of overleaping the law is of greater  
evil than of strict adherence to its imperfect  
provisions. It is incumbent on those only  
who accept of great charges, to rislr. them­

&quot;The question you  
propose, whether  
circumstances do sometimes occur which  
makes it a duty in officers of high trust to  
assume authorities beyond the law, is easy  
of solution in principle, but sometimes em­  
barrassing in practice. A strict obsery­  
ance of the written law is doubtless one of  
the high duties of a good citizen, but it is  
not the Afihest. The laws of necessity, of  
self preservation, of saving our country  
when in danger, are of higher obligation.  
To lose our country by a scrupulous ad-  
 a ta terittan law would be to lose the  
herence to wiitteh lu t  
law itself,  
ith life, liberty, property, and  
all those who are enjoying them with us;  
thus absurdly sacrificing the end to the  
means.  
&quot;From tuese exampies au t y  
you may see what I think on the question  
proposed. They do not go to the case of  
persons charged with petty duties, where  
consequences are trifling and time allowed  
for a legal course, nor to authorize them  
to take such cases out of the written law.  
In these the example of overleaping the  
is of greater evil than a strict adher  
ace to its imperfect provisions. It is in  
on those only who accept of great  
risk themselves on great occi-  
cumbent  
charges to  
sions, when the safety of the nation or  
some of its very high interests are at  
stake.

laws of property must be postponed to the

before York, the Governor of Virginia took  
horsas, carriages, provisions, and even men,  
by force, to enable that army to stay to­  
gether till it could master the public ene­

in distress for provisions, meets another

ger:  
Moxtickllo, September 20.  
Sir : Your favor of tbe 14th bas been  
duly received, aod I have to thank you for  
tbe many obliging thiogs respecting my­  
?e f which are said&#x27; in it. If I have left in  
tbe breasts of my fellow-citizens a senti­  
ment of satisfaction with my conduct in  
tbe transaction of their business, it will  
itbe pillow of my repose through tbe  
;jr sidce of life.;  
Tbe qorstion you propose, whether cir­  
cumstances do not sometimes occur, which  
.: .v , ? -  
aiMi k - i  
  
make-it a&#x27;duty in officers of high trust, to  
assume authorities beyond the law, is easy  
&lt;&gt;f solution in principle, bat sometimes em­  
barrassing in practice. A strict observance  
of the written laws Is-doubtless-one of-the  
high duties of a good&#x27;citizen,&quot; but it is not  
ibe highest. The laws of.necessity,:of self­  
preservation, of saving our country^beu  
in danger, are of&lt;1iighpT obligations To;  
lose our country by a scrupulous adherence  
to written law, would be to lose itself, with  
life, liberty, property and all those who are  
cdjoying them with us; thus absurdly  
sacrificing the end to the means. When,  
iu the battle of Germantown, Gen. Wash­  
inglon&#x27;s army was annoyed from Chew_&#x27;a  
house, be did not hesitate to plant bis  
cannon against it, although the property  
of a citizen. When be besieged Yorktown,  
be leveled the suburbs, feeling that the laws  
of property must be postponed to the safety  
of the nation. While the army was before  
York, the Governor of Virginia took  
horses, carriages, provisions, and even men,  
by force, to enable that army to stay to  
gether till it could master tbe public ene­  
my; and he was justified. A ship at sea in  
distress for provisions meets another hav­  
icgabundance, yet refusing a supply; the  
law of self preservation authorizes tbe  
distressed to take a supply by force. In  
&#x27;ill these cases the unwritten laws of ne­  
cessity, of self-preservation, and of thi  
public safety, control the written laws ol  
ineum aud teum.  
Further to exemplify tbe principle, I wil  
state an hypothetical case. Suppose it had  
been made known to tbe Executive of tbe  
Onion, in the autumn of 1805, that w&lt;  
uiigbt have the Florida* for a reasonable  
anm; that that sum bad not been so appror  
priated by law, bnt that Congress were tc  
meet within three weeks, and might ap­  
propriate it on tbe first or second day ol  
tbeir session. Ought bo, ?  
advantage to bis country, to have risked  
?Iluisett Oy tr&amp;uaooodtn^ the law and rotll^:  
ing the purchase? The public advantage  
offered, in the supposed case, was indeec  
immense; but a reverence for law, and th(  
probability that the advantage might stil  
be legally accomplished by a delay o  
only three weeks were powerful reason:  
Against hazarding the act. Bnt suppose  
it forseen that a John Randolph would  
find means to protract the proceeding!  
on it by Congress until tbe ensuing spring,  
by which time new circumstances would  
change tbe mind of the other party. Ougbl  
the Executive, in that case, and with that  
foreknowledge, to have secured tbe good  
to bis country, and to have trusted to tbeii  
justice for tbe transgression ef the law??  
1 think he ought, and that the act would  
have been approved. After tbe affair of tbe  
Chesapeake, we thought war a very possi­  
ble result. Our magazines were illy pro­  
vided with some necessary article*, nor  
bad any appropriations beeu mado for tbeir  
purchase. We ventured, however, to pro­  
vide them, and to place our country in  
safety; and stating tbe case to Congress,  
they sanctioned tbe act. To proceed to tbe  
conspiracy of Burr, and particularly to  
Gen. Wilkinson&#x27;s s-ituation in New Orleans.  
In judging tbe case, we are bound to con­  
sider the state of tbe information, correct  
and incorrect, wbich be then possessed.?  
He expected Burr and bis band from above,  
a British fleet from below, and he knew  
there was a formidable conspiracy witbin  
the city. Under these circumstances, was  
be justifiable, 1st. In seizing notorious con­  
Hpirators? On this there can ba but two  
opinions; one, of the guilty and their ac­  
complices ; tbe other, that of all honest  
men. 2d. In sending tbem to the seat of  
government, when the written law gave  
them a right to trial in tbe territory? The  
d*og?p of tbeir rescue, of a.:- -?  
their machinations, the tardiness aud  
weakness of the law, apatby of the  
judges, active patronage of tbe  
whole tribe of lawyers, unknown  
disposition of tbe juries, an hourly expec­  
tation of the enemy, salvation of the city,  
and of the Union itself, which would have  
been oonvulsed to its centre, bad that con­  
spiracy succeeded; all these constituted a  
law of necessity and self-preservation, and  
rendered tbe ealue populi supreme over tbe  
written law. Tbe officer who is called to  
act on this superior ground, does indeed  
risk himself on tbe justice of tbe controll­  
ing powers of tbe Constitution, and bis  
station makes it bis duty to incur that risk.  
But those controlling powers, and bis fel­  
low-citizens generally, are bound to judge  
according to tbe circumstances under  
which he acted. They are not to transfer  
tho information of this place or moment to  
I the time and place of his action; but to put  
himself into his situation. We knew here  
that there never was danger of a British  
fleet from below, and that Burr&#x27;s band  
I was crushed before it reached the Missis­  
sippi. But General Wilkiosou&#x27;s informa­  
tion was very different, and he could act  
on no other. From these examples and  
principles yon may see w&#x27;nat I think on the  
I qnestion proposed. They do not go to tbe  
case of persons charged with petty duties,  
where consequences are trifling, and time  
allowed for a legal coarse, nor to author­  
ize tbem to take such cases out of tho writ­  
I ten law. In these, Jho example of over­  
leaping the law is of greater evil than a  
strict adherence to its imperfect provisions.  
It is incumbent apoa those only who  
accept of great charges, to risk  
themselves on great occasions, when

5th volume of Jorks. It clear.  
ly shows what the author of the Declara  
tion of Independence thought to be th  
duty of the President of the United States  
in time of insurrection and public danger.  
In that letter he says: &quot;A strict observ  
ance of the written laws is doubtless one  
of the high duties of a good citizen, but  
is not the highest. The laws of necessity,  
of self-preservation, of saving our country  
when in danger, are of higher obligation. To  
lose our country by a scrupulous adherence  
to written law, would be to lose itself, with  
life, liberty, property and all those who

sacrificing the end to the means.&quot; N

knew there was a formidable conspiracy  
within the city. Under these circumstances  
was he justifiable, 1st. In seizing notori

. Mohticxllo, September -0.  
Sib: Your favor of the I4?h has been  
duly received, and I have to thank you for  
the many obliging things respecting myself  
whioh are said in it. If I have left in the  
breasts of my fellow-citizens a sentiment of  
satisfaction with my conduct in the trans  
action of their business, it will soften the  
pillow of my repose through the residue of  
my life.  
The question you propose, whether cir­  
cumstances do nnt sometimes occur, which  
make it a duty in offices of hitrh trust, to  
assume authorities beyond the law, is easy  
of the written liws is doubtluss one of the  
high duties of a good citizen, but it is not  
the highest. The laws of necessity, of self­  
preservation, of saving our country when in  
danger, are of higher obligations. To lose  
our country by a scrupulous adherance to  
written law, would be to lose itself, with  
life, liberty, prosperity and all those who  
  
are enjoying them with, us ; thus eosuraiy American not that tuere were not diner­  
sacrificine the end to the means. When, in fences of opinion in regard to some of the  
  
the battle of Germantown, General Wash-  
ington&#x27;s army was annoyed from Chew&#x27;s  
house, he did not hesitate to plant his can-  
non against it, although the property of a  
citisen. When he besieged Yorktown, he  
leveled the suburbs, feeling that the laws  
of property must be pos&#x27;ponad to the safety  
of the nation. Whibi the army was before  
York, the Governor of Virginia took horses,  
carriages, provisions, nnd, even men, by  
force, to enable that army to suy together  
till it could m ster the public eoemr, and  
he was justified. A ship at sea in distress  
for provision meets another having abund­  
ance, yet refusing t ipply ; the law of  
self-preservatijn a-rlurizs the distressed to  
take a supply by force. In Ul these cse the  
unwrit&#x27;eu laws of necessity, ofself-preservation,  
and of the public safe&#x27;y, uoutrol the  
unwritten laws of mum and teum.  
Further toexemp ity the prin&#x27;.iplo, I will  
state an hypothetical case. Suppose it had  
been made known to the Executive of the  
Union, in the autumn of 1305, that we  
might have the Florid for a reasonaMe  
j sum ; that that sum had not bmii soappro-SOL-  
; priatel bylaw, but i hat Congress were to  
meet wiimn niree wbcks, and tiiigut appro­  
priate it on the first or seond day of their  
session. Ought he, for s great au advan  
tage to his country, to have risked

the act. But suppose it ws foreseen tbat a - connection with his remaiks on this subject,

party. Ought the Executive, in that case, war in which we are engaged. But, with

MONTICELLO, September 20.  
  
Snt: Your favor of the 11th bus boon  
duly received, and I have to thank you for  
tho inanv obliging things respoctin&#x27; niv-  
self which are said in it. If I have left in  
the breasts of my fellow citi.&#x27;.ens a sentiment  
of satisfaction with my conduct iu the trans­  
action of their business, it will soltou the  
pillow of my repose through the residue of  
my life.  
The nuestioti you propose, whether cir­  
cumstances do not sometimes occur, which  
mako it a duty iu ollicers of high trust, to  
assume authorities beyond the law, is easy  
ol solution in principle, but sometimes em­  
barrassing in practice. A strict ohaervaneo  
of the written laws is doubtless one of the  
high duties of a good cili.en, but it is not  
the highest. Tho laws of necessity, of self­  
preservation, of saving our country when  
iu danger, aro of higher obligations. To  
lose our country by a scrupulous adherence  
to written law, would be to lose itself, with  
life, liberty, prosperity and all those who  
are enjoying them with us ; thus absurdly  
sacrificing thu end to the meaus. When, in  
tho battle of (iciinautow n, (ion. Washing­  
ton&#x27;s army was annoyed from Chew&#x27;s house,  
ho did not hesitate to plant his chuiiou  
against it, although tho property ol&#x27; a cit­  
izen. When ho besieged Yorktown, he  
levclod tho suburbs, feeling that the laws  
of properly must bo postponed to the Balety  
of tho nation. While the army was before  
York, tho tiovernor of Virginia took horses,  
carriages, provisions and even men, by  
force, to enable that army to stay togolhm  
till it could muster the public enemy, nnd  
ho wns justified. A shin at sea in distress  
for provisions meets another having abun­  
dance, yet refusing a supply j the law of  
self-preservation au!hori&#x27;es tho distressed  
to tako a supply by force. 1 11 nil these  
cases tho unwritten laws of nccossily, or  
self-proservation, and of the public safely,  
control tho unwritten laws ol niritiii and  
team.  
Further to oxoinplify tho principle, I will  
slate an hypothetical case. Suppose it had  
been made known to tlio Kxeeittivo of the  
Cnion, iu tho autumn of 1 St that we miht  
havo tho lioi idits for a reasonable sum ; that  
that Rltm bad not been so appropriated by  
law, but that Congress were to meet within  
throo weeks, and might appropriate it on  
tho first or second day of their session.  
Ought he, for so great 1111 advantage to his  
country ,to have risked himself by transcend­  
ing tho law and making the purchase?  
Tho public advantage ollered, in tho sup­  
posed case, was indeed iiniuense, but a rev­  
oronco for law, and tho probability that tho  
advantage might still bo legally accom­  
plished by 11 delay of only three weeks  
were powerful reasons against the hazard­  
ous act. Hut suppose it foreseen that a  
lolin Randolph would find means lo protract  
the proceedings on it by Congress until the  
ensuing spring, by whhh timo new circum­  
stances woil&#x27;d uhuugo the mind of the other&#x27;  
party. Ought thu Executive, in that case,  
with that foreknowledge, havo secured tho  
good to his country, aud to have trusted to  
their justice for tho transgression of tho  
law? 1 think ho ought, and that tho act  
would have beon approved. After the af­  
fair of tho Chesapeake, wo thought war a  
very possible result. Our magazines wero  
illy provided with some necessary articles,  
nor had any appropriations been made lor  
tho purchase. We ventured, however, to  
provide them, und to place our country in  
safety ; ami stating tho enso to Congress,  
they sanctioned the act. To proceed to Iho  
conspiracy of Hurr, aud particularly tolien­  
einl Wilkinson&#x27;s situation iu New Orleans.  
In judging the case, wo aro bound to con­  
sider tho state of information, correct und  
incorrect, which he then possessed. Ho  
expected Hurr aud his baud from above, a  
Hritish ileet from below, and ho knew  
there was a formidable conspiracy within  
tho city. I&#x27;n dor these circumstances, wns  
ho justifiable, let, in Reizing notorious con­  
spirators On thiN there can bo but two  
opinions; one, of the guilty nnd their ac­  
cumplices ; the other, that of all honest men.  
2d, in souding thorn lo tho seat of govern­  
ment, when the writbn law gave them a  
right to trial in tho territory? The dinger  
of their rescue, of their continuing their  
nii&#x27;iJiinatioiis.tho tanliiiuss and weakness of  
thelaw, apathy of !! -j judges, &quot;five pat­  
ronage 01&#x27; the who! tribo of lawyers, un­  
known disposition of the juries, an hourly  
expectation of tho enemy, salvation of tho  
city, ami of tho l&#x27;nion itself, which would  
havo been convulsod to its confer, had that  
conspiracy succeeded ; nil these constituted  
a law of necessity ami solf-prcsorvution, und  
rendered tho talus pniuli supremo over tho  
written law. The olliccr w ho is called to  
act on ihiz superior ground, docs indeed  
risk himself on the justice of the controlling  
powcus of the Constitution, and his station  
makes it his duty Ut incur that risk. Hut  
thoso&quot;controlling powers, and his fellow­  
citizens generally, are bound to judge ac­  
cording to the circumstances under which  
ding to tho circumstances under which ho  
acted. They were not to transfer tlio in­  
formation of this place or moment to the  
timo and place of his action ; but to put  
himself into his situation. Wo know hero  
that there was never danger of a Hritish  
fleet from below, and that Hun &#x27;s band wns  
cru.ilied before it reached tho Mississippi.  
Hut (leu. Wilkinson&#x27;s information was very  
different, and ho could act on no other.  
From these examples and principles you  
may see what I think 011 the question pro­  
posed. They do not go to tho case of per­  
sons charged with petty duties, where con­  
sequences are trifling, am! time allowed for  
a legal course, nor to authorize them to  
tako such cases out of tho written law.  
In these the cxamplo of overleaping the  
lawsjs of greater evil than a strict udhor­  
euco to its imperfect provisions. It is in­  
cumbent upon those only who accept tho  
gre.&#x27;tt charges, to risk themselves ou great  
occasions, when the safety of tho nation, or  
somo of its very high interests aro ut stake.  
An ollieer is bound to obey orders ; yut ho  
would bu a bud oue who bhotild do it in  
cases for which they wcro not intended,  
and which involved thu most important  
consoquences. Tho lino of discrimination  
between cases may bo diflicultj but the  
good officer is bound to draw it at his own  
jieril. jnd throw himself on tho justice of  
his country and the rectitude of hismotives.  
  
I have indulged freer views on this que  
tion, on your assurances that they are for  
your own eye only, and they will not get  
into the hands of tiewi-wtiter. I met  
their scurrilities without concern, while in  
the pursuit of tho great interests with  
which I was charged. Hut in my present  
retirement, 110 duty forbids my &quot;wish for  
quiet.  
Accept the nsrurances of mv esteem and

language:  
&quot;The question you propose--whether cir­  
cumstances do not sometimes occur which  
make it a duty in officers of high trust to as  
sume authorities beyond the law--is casy of  
solution in principle, but sometimes embar  
rassing in practice. A strict observance of  
the written laws is doubtless one of the high  
duties of a good citizen, but it is not the  
highest. The lamcs of necessity, of self-preser.  
ration, of sacing our country when in danger,  
are all of higher obligation. To lose our coun

would be to lose itself with life, liberty, pro

In judging the case, we are bound to con­  
sider the State of the information, correct  
and incorrect, which he (Wilkinson) then  
possessed. He expected Burr and his band  
 from above, a British fleet from below, and  
he knew there was a formidable conspiracy  
 within the city. Under these circumstances  
 was he justifiable--Ist. In seizing notorious  
e i a  
whole tribe of lawyers, unknown disposition  
  
chont the jesiften low gave thom a pialt to o  
  
of the juries, and hourly expectation of the  
enemy, salvation of the city and of the Union  
itself, which would have been convulsed to  
its centre had that conspiracy succeeded; a  
  
these constituted a law of necessity and self-  
preservation, and rendered the salus popuh  
supreme over the written law. The officer  
is called to act on the superior ground,  
does indeed isk hiself on the iustice of the  
controlling powers of the Constitution, and  
his station makes it his duty to incur that  
risk.&quot;  
There would seem from this to be little  
doubt how Jefferson would act were he at  
the head of affairs now. He would set a De­  
mocratic precedent which even Brooks and  
the Woods would respect.

Mcstickllo September 0. &#x27;  
Sir: Your favor of the 14th has been  
dnlv r pi oil . nnd I have to thank rnn

a f .... L . Sf

left in the breasts of mv fellow-citizens a &#x27;i  
sentiment of satisfaction with my con­  
duct in the transaction of their business,  
i will soften the pillow of my repose  
through the residue of my life.  
The question you propose, whether  
circumstances do not sometimes occur,  
which make it a duty in fl i e r of high  
trust, to assume authorities beyond the  
law is easy of solution in principle, but  
sometimes embarrassing in practice. A  
strict observation of the written laws is  
uouuuess one oi tne nigncsi unties oi a  
good citizen, but it is not the highest.  
loubtless one of the highest duties of  
The laws of necessity, of self-preservation,  
of saving our country when in danger, are  
of higher obligations. To lose our coun­  
try by a scrupulous adherence to written  
law, would be to ioso irelf, with life,  
liberty, prosperity and all those who are  
enjoying them with us; thus absurdly sac­  
rificing the end to the means. Washing­  
ton&#x27;s army was annoyed from Chew&#x27;s  
bouse, he did not hesitate to plant his  
cannon agaiust it, nithough the property  
of a citizen. When he besieged Yoik­  
town, he leled the suburbs, feeling that  
the laws of property must be postponed  
to the safety of the nation. While tho  
army was bebte York, the Governor of  
Virginia took horses, carriages, provis­  
ions, and, even men, by force to enable  
that army to stay together till it could  
master the public enemy, and he was justi­  
fied. A ship at sea In distress for pro­  
visions meets another having abundance,  
yet lefnsing to supply; the law of self­  
preservation authorizes the distressed to  
take a supply by force. In all these ca­  
ses tho unwritten laws of necessity, of  
self preservation, and of the public safety,  
control the unwritten laws of mcum and  
tcum.  
Further, to exemplify the principle, I  
will state an hypothetic! case. Suppose  
it ha 1 been made known to the Executive  
of the Union, in the autumn of 1805, that  
we might have the Floridas for a reason­  
able sum; that, that sum had not been so  
appropriated by law, but that Congress  
were to meet within three weeks, and  
might appropriate it on the first or second  
day of their session. Ought he for to  
great an advantage to his country, to have  
riked himself by transcending the law  
and making the purchase? Thc public  
advantage offered, in the supposed case.  
was, indeed immense, but a reverence for  
law, and the probability that the advan-  
tage might .till be legally accomphsheu  
by a delay ot only ttiree weeks were  
powerful reasons against hazarding tho  
act. Out suppose it foreseen that a John  
Randolph would find means to protract  
tho proceedings on it by Congress until  
the ensuing spring, by which time the  
new circumstances would change the  
mind of the other party. Ought the  
Executive, in that case, and with that  
foreknowledge, to have secured ?he good  
  
to his country and to have trusted to fore long. The Surgeons ciijed prison a I-eaco man, an able an 1 honost one-their  
justice for the transgression of the .:fÄ , . J v r i W ith such a man as President of tho Lm-  
  
law: i tninK ue ongm, auu iusi tns aci  
would have been approved. After the  
affair of the Cltesapeake, we thought war  
W .1 A. 1 . . J ,L. ..  
very possible result.  
Our  
magazines  
: were illy provided with some necessary  
articles, nor bad any appropriations been  
made for their purchase. We ventured, i  
Iwuvarnr r nn.L&#x27;litA t m,r And t CI r, 1 Q no  
our country in safety; and stating the  
case to Congress, ttu-y sanctioned the act.  
To proceed to the conspiracy of  
Burr,  
and paiticularly to  
to Gen. Wilkinson&#x27;s  
Orleans. In judging  
onnd to consider the  
situation in New  
the case, we are bon  
state of the information, correct and in­  
correct, which he then possessed. He ex­  
pected Burr and his band from above, a  
British fleet from below, and be knew  
there was a formidable conspiracy within  
the city. Under these circumstances was  
he justifiable, 1st, In seizing notorious  
conspirators? On this there can be two  
opinions; one, of the guilty and their ac­  
complices; the other, that of all honest  
).: Tn An.llnir t Wem tri tm cf ,,f  
i men. o, Xu evin&#x27;.&#x27;1, -. v .u, mi ui  
government, when the written law gave  
thorn a right to trial in the territory?  
The danger of their rescue, of their con­  
tinuing thoir machinations, the tardiness  
and weakness of tho law, apathy of the  
judges, active patronsge of the whole  
tribe of lawyers, unknown dispotism of  
thc juries, an hourly expectation of the  
enemy, salvation cf the city, and of the  
Union itself, which would have been con­  
vulsed to its center, had that conspiracy  
success; all those constituted a law of ne­  
cessity and self-preservation, and render­  
ed the talus poptdi supreme over thc writ  
ten law. The officer who is called to act  
on this superior ground does indeed risk  
himself on the justice of controlling pow­  
ers of the Constitution, and his station  
makei it his duty to incurs thnt risk.  
But those controlling powers, and  
his fellow-citizens generally, are bound to  
judge according lo the circumstances un­  
der which he acted. They are not to  
transfer the information of this place or  
moment to tho time and place of his  
.1  
action; but to pot ttiemseives into his  
situation. We knew here that there never  
waa danger of a British fleet from below,  
and that Burr&#x27;s band was crushed beforo  
it reached the Mississippi. But Gen.  
Wilkinson&#x27;s information waa very dif­  
ferent and he could act on no other.

&quot;The question you propose- whether  
circumstances do not sometimes occur  
which make it a duty in officers of high  
trust to assume authorities beyond the law  
is easy of solution in principle, but some­  
times embarrassing in practice. A strict  
ohservance of the written laws is doubtless  
one of the high duties of a good citizen,  
but it is not the highest. The laws of ne­  
cessity, of self preservation, of saving our  
country by a scrupulous adherence  
written law, would be to lose itself with  
life, liberty, property, and all those who  
are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly  
sacrificing the end to the means.  
In judging the case, we are  
bound to consider the state of the informa­  
tion, correct and incorrect, which he (Wil­  
kinson) then possessed. He expected

just received, land I have to thank you for the  
many obliging things respecting myself which  
are said in it. | If I have left in the breasts of .  
my fellow-citizens a sentiment of satisfaction -  
with my conduct in the&#x27; transaction of tbejrbo­  
sinesS, it will soften the pillow of my repose  
through the residue of my life. :  
The question yon propose, whether direnm- 5  
stances do not sometimes&#x27; occur which’ fn&#x27;ake it J  
a duty in an officer of high trust to assume au­  
thorities beyond the law, is easy of eolation in *  
principle, but sometimes embufduing in-prac­  
tice. A strict observance of the Written laws ,  
is doubtless one of tbe highest duties of a  
good citizen, but it is not the highest Tbs&#x27; &#x27;  
laws of necesssity, of self-preservatioh, of&#x27;sav­  
ing oqr country when in danger, are of higher r  
obligation. To lose our country bj a sorupn­  
lous adherence to written law, would bo tdlose ’  
life itself, with] life, liberty, prosperity, and ell  
those who are enjoying them with os—thus ab­  
surdly sacrificing.tbe end to the means. When  
in the battle of Germantown Gen. .Washings  
ton’s army was.annoyed from Chew’s House,&#x27; .  
be did not hesitate to plant bis cannon against  
it, although the property of a citizen. When &#x27;  
be besieged Torktown be leveled the suburbs, _  
feeling that the laws of property must be post-’  
poned to the safety of the nation. While ;the&#x27;-  
army was before York,-the Governor ofVir-;  
ginia took horses, carriages, provisions,- and  
even men, by! force, to enable that army to stay  
together until it could master public enemy,  
and be was justified. A ship at sea in distress  
for provisions, meets another baving abund­  
ance, yet refusing to supply } the law of self­  
preservation [authorizes the distressed to take  
a supply by force. &quot;In all these cases the un­  
written law of necessity, of self-preservation/  
and of tbe public safety, control the- writteif  
laws of mema et iuum. , -■=-  
  
- Further, to exemplify the?principle!. Twill  
state-.an hypothetical case. Suppose it had  
been made known .to tbs Executive of&#x27; the  
Union, in the autumn of 1805, that w« might  
have the. Floridan for a reasonable sum ; that  
that sum. bad not been so appropriated by law,&#x27;  
-put “niai cthigress WSrelo nSCet Wlttrtnthrew •

second day of . their session. Ought he&#x27; for so;  
great an advantage, to have risked himself by  
traneending the law and making the purchased  
Tbk public advantage offered, in tba supposod  
case, was&#x27;, indeed immensej.bnt a reverence for  
law, and a probability that the advantage might  
still be legally accomplished hyf a delay of  
only three wiieks were powerful reasons against -f  
hazarding the act; But suppose itfoteseen that .;  
n John Randolph would means to protractile |  
proceedings on it by Cpngretfs Otftil the ensuing  
spring, by which time thet naw circumstances&#x27;  
would&quot; change the mind Of the   
Ought the Executive, in that case, and with  
that foreknowledge, to-have secured the good to(

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
MoNTIcEtLO, Sept. 20.  
Str: Your favor of the 14th has been  
duly received, and I have to thank you for  
the many obliging things respecting myself  
which are said in it. If I have left in the  
breasts of my fellow-citizens a sentiment of  
satislaction with my conduct in the transac  
tion of their business, it will vastly soften  
the pillow of repose through the residue of  
my life.  
  
The question you propose, whether circum­  
stances do not sometimes occur, which make  
it a duty in an officer of high trust to as­  
sume authority beyond the law, is easy of  
solution in principle, but sometimes embar­  
rassing in practice.  
A strict observance of the written laws is  
doubtless one of the highest duties of a good  
citizen, but is not the highest. The law of  
necessity, of self preservation, of saving our  
country when in danger, are of higher obli­  
gations. To lose our country by a scrupu­  
lous adherence to written law, would be to  
lose itself, with life, liberty, prosperity and  
all those who are enjoying them with us; the  
absurdly sacrificing the end to the means.  
When in the battle of Germanstown General  
Washington&#x27;s army wasannoyed from Chew&#x27;s  
house, he did not hesitate to plant his can­  
non against it, although the property of a  
citizen. When he besieged Yorktown he  
leveled the suburbs, feeling that the laws of  
property must be postponed to the safety of  
the nation.  
  
While the army was before York, the Gov­  
ernor of Virginia took horses, carriages,  
provisions, and even men by force, to enable  
the army to stay together till it could master  
the public enemy, and he was justified. A  
ship at sea in distress for provisions meets  
another having abundance, yet refusing to  
supply; the law of self-preservation author­  
izes the distressed to take a supply by force.  
In all these cases the unwritten laws of ne­  
cessity, of self-preservation, and of the pub­  
lic safety, control the written laws of meum  
and feum.  
Further, to exemplify the principle, I will  
state a hypothetical case. Suppose it had  
been made known to the Executive of the  
Union, in the autumn of 1805, that wo might  
have the Floridas for a reasonable sum; that  
that sum had not been so appropriated by  
law, but that Congress were to meet within  
three weeks, and might appropriate it on the  
first or second day of their session. Ought  
he, for so great an advantage to his coun­  
try, to have risked himself by transcending  
the law and making the purchase? The  
public advantage offered, in the supposed  
case, was, indeed immense, but a reverence  
for law, and a probability that the advan­  
tage might still be legally accomplished by a  
delay of only three weeks were powerful  
reasons against hazarding the act. But sup­  
pose it foreseen that a John Randolph would  
find means to protract the proceedings on it  
by Congress until the ensuing spring, by  
which time the new circumstances would  
  
change the mind of the other party. Ought  
the Executive in that case, and with the  
foreknowledge, to have secured the good to  
his country, and to have trusted to their jus  
tice for the transgression of law? I think he  
ought, and that the act would have been ap­  
proved. After the affair of the Chesapeake, we  
thought war a very possible result. Our mag  
azines were illy provided with some neces  
sary articles, nor had any appropriations  
been made for their purchase. We ventur­  
ed, however, to provide them and to place  
our country in safety, and stating the case  
to Congress, they sanctioned the act.  
To proceed to the conspiracy of Burr and  
particularly to Gena Wilkingon&#x27;s situation  
in New Orleans. In judging the case, we  
are bound to consider the State of the infor­  
mation, correct or incorrect, which he then  
possessed. He expected Burr and his band  
from above, a British fleet from below, and  
he knew there was a formidable conspiracy  
within the city. Under these circumstances  
was he justifiable, Ist, In seizing notorious  
conspirators? On this there can be two  
opinions- one, of the guilty and their ac­  
complices; the other that of all honest men.  
2d, In sending them to the seat of Govern­  
ment, when the written law gave them a  
right to trial in the territory? The danger  
of their rescue, of their continuing their  
machinations, the tardiness and weakness of  
the law, apathy of the judges active patron-  
age of the whole tribe of lawyers, unknown  
disposition of juries, an hourly expectation  
of the enemy, salvation of the city, and of  
the Union itself, which would have been  
convulsed to its center, had that conspiracy  
succeeded; all those constituted a law of  
necessity and self-preservation, and reaching  
the salus populi supreme over the written  
law. The officer who is called to act on this  
superior ground does indeed risk himself and  
the justice of the controling powers of the  
Constitution, and his station makes it his duty  
to incur that risks. But those controlling  
power, and his fellow-citizens generally are  
bound to judge according to the circum­  
tances which he acted. They are not to  
transfer the information of this place or mo-  
  
ment to the time and place of his action;  
but to put themselves into his situation.  
We know here that there never was danger  
of a British fleet from below, and that Burr&#x27;s  
band was crushed before it reached the Mis­  
sissippi. But Genr Wilkinson&#x27;s information  
was very different, and he could act on no  
other.  
From these examples and principles you  
may see what I think on the question pro-  
posed. They do not affect the case of persons  
charged with petty duties, where consequen­  
ces are trifling, and time allowed for a legal  
course, nor to authorize them to take such  
cases out of the written law. In these, the  
ample overleaping the law is of greater evil  
than a strict adherence to its imperfect pro­  
vision. It is incumbent upon those only who  
accept the great charges, to risk themselves  
on great occasions, when the safety of the  
nation, or some of its high interests are at  
stake. An officer is bound to obey orders,  
yet he would be a bad one who should do it  
in cases for which they were not intended,  
and which involved the most important con­  
sequences. The line of discrimination be­  
tween cases may be difficult; but the good  
officer is bound to draw it at his own peril,  
and throw himself on the justice of his  
country and the rectitude of his motives.  
I have indulged freer views on this subject,  
on your assurances that they are for your  
own eye only, and that they will not get in­  
to the hands of the news writers. I met  
their scurrilities without concern while in  
pursuit of the great interest with which I  
was charged. But in my present retirement,  
no duty forbids my wish for quiet.  
Accept the assurances of my esteem and  
respect.d THOMAs JEFFERSON

Monticello, Sept. 20.  
Sir :—Your favor of tbs 14tli has  
been duiv received, and I bare to thank  
you fur the many obliging things respect  
ing myself which are said in it. If I  
have left in the breasts of my fellow-cit­  
izens a sentiment of satisfaction with my  
conduct in the transaction of their busi­  
ness, it will soften the pillow of my re­  
pose through the residue of my life.  
The question you proj»ose, whether cir­  
cumstances do nut sometimes occur,  
which makes it a duty in officers of hi Jr  
trust to assume authorities beyond the  
law, is easy of solution in principle, but  
sometimes embarrass in practice. A  
strict observance of the written laws is  
doubtless one of the highest duties of a  
go&lt;xl citizen, but it is not the highest.—  
The laws of necessity, of self-preserva­  
tion, of saving our country when in dan  
ger, are of higher obligation. To lose  
our country by a scrupulous a lherenco  
to w ritten law, would be to lose itself,  
life, liberty, prosperity and all those who  
are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly  
sacrificing the end to the means.  
When iu the battle of Germantown  
Gen. Washington’s army was annoyed  
from Chew’s house, he did not hesitate  
to plant bis cannon against it, although  
the property of a citizen. When tie be­  
sieged Yorktown, he leveled the suburbs,  
feeling that the laws of property must be  
postponed to the safety of the nation.—  
While the army was before York, the  
Governor of Virginia took horses, car­  
riages, provisions, an I even men by  
force, to enable that army to stay togeth­  
er till it could master the public enemy,  
nnd he was justified. A ship at sea in  
distress for provisions, meets another  
having abundance, yet refusing to sup­  
ply ; the law of self-preservation author­  
ises the distressed to take supplies by  
force. In all these cases, the unwritten  
laws of necessity, of self preservation,  
nud of the public safety, control tho un­  
written laws of meum and teum.  
Further to exemplify the principle, I  
will state an hypothetical case. Suppose  
it had been made known to the Execu­  
tive of the Union, in the Autumn c.f  
ISOS. that wo might have the Floridas  
for a reasonable sum ; that the sum bnd  
not been so appropriated by law, but  
that Congress was to meet within three  
weeks, and might appropriate it on tie*  
first or second day of their session.—  
Ought he, for so great an advantage to  
his country, to Lave risked himself by  
transcending the law and making the  
purchase ? The public advantage offer­  
ed in the supposed case, was indeed im­  
mense, but a reverence for law, and the  
probability that tho advantage might  
still be accomplished by a delay of only  
three weeks, were powerful reasons  
against hazarding the act. But suppose  
it was foreseen that a John Randolph  
would find means to protract the pro­  
ceedings on it by Congress until the en­  
suing Spring, by which time new circuin  
stances would change the mind of the  
other party.  
Ought the Executive, in that case, and  
with that foreknowledge, to have secured  
the good to his country, and to base  
trusted to their justice for tho transgres­  
sion of the law ? I think ho ought, and  
that the act would have been approved.  
After the affair of the Chesapeake, we  
thought war a very possible result. Oar  
magazines were illy provided with some  
necessary articles, nor had any appropri­  
ations been made for tho purchase. We  
ventured, now, to provide them, and to  
place our country in safety; and staling  
the case to Congress, they sanctioned the  
act. To proceed to the conspiracy of  
Burr, and particularly to Gen. Wilkin­  
son’s situation in New Orleans. In judg­  
ing the case we are bound to consider  
the state of the information, correct and  
incorrcc*, which ho then possessed. He  
expected Burr and his band from above,  
a Biitish fleet from l»clow, and he knew  
there was a formidable conspiracy with­  
in the c’tv.  
  
Under those circumstances, was be jus­  
tifiable, Ist, in siczing notorious conspira­  
tors ? On this there can be but two  
opinions; one, of the guilty and their ac­  
complices; the other, that of all honest  
men. 2d, in sending them to the scat of  
Government, when the written laws gave  
them a right to trial in the territory ?  
The danger of their rescue, or their con­  
tinuing their machination*, the tardiness  
and weakness of the law’, apathy of judg­  
es, active patronage of the whole tribe  
of lawyers, unknown disposition of the  
juries, an hourly expectation of the ene­  
my, salvation of the city, and of the Un­  
ion itself, which would have been con­  
vulsed to its centre, bad that conspiracy  
succeeded ; all these constituted a law of  
necessity and self-preservation and ren­  
dered the solus populi supremo over the  
written law. The officer who is called  
to act on this superior ground, does in­  
deed risk himself on tho justice of the  
controlling powers of tho Constitution,  
and Lie station makes it bis duty to incur  
that risk.  
But those controlling powers and his  
fellow citizens generally, are bound to  
judge according to the circumstances un­  
der which be acted. They were not to  
  
transfer the information of this place or  
moment to the time and place of his ac  
tion; but to put himself into his situation.  
Wo knew here that there never was any  
danger of n British fleet from below, and  
that Burr’s Land was crushed before it  
reached the Mississippi. But Gen. Wil  
kinson’s information was very different,  
and he ccuid act on no other.  
From these examples and principles  
you may sec what 1 think on the ques­  
tion proposed. They do not go to the  
case of persons with petty duties, where  
consequences arc trifling, and lime allow­  
ing for a Dgal course, nor to authorize  
them to take such cases out of the writ­  
ten law. Iu these, the example of over­  
leaping tho law is of greater evil than a  
strict adherence to its imperfect provis­  
ions.  
It is incumbent upon those only who  
accept tho great charges, to risk them­  
selves on great occasions, when the safety  
of tho nation or some of its very high  
interests are at stake. An officer is  
bound to oT ey orders, yet he would be a  
bad one who should do it in cases for  
which they were not intended, and which  
involved tho most important consequen­  
ces. The line of discrimination between  
cases may I c difficult; but the good offi­  
cer is bound to draw it at his own peril,  
and throw himself on the justice of his  
country and tho rectitude us bis mo­  
tives.  
I have indulged free views on this  
question on your assurance that they are  
for your own eje only, mid that they  
will’not gel into the hands of news wri­  
ters. I met their scurrilities without con­  
cern, while in pursuit of the great inter­  
ests with which 1 was charged. But in  
my present no duty forbids  
my wish for quiet.  
Accept the assurance of my esteem  
and respect. Thomas Jefferson

In judging of this case, we are bound to con­  
sider the state of the information, correct and  
incorrect, which he then possessed. He ex­  
pec. ed Burr and his band from above, a Brit­

a formidable conspiracy within the city. Un­

guilty and their accomplices ; the other, that  
of all honest men. 2nd, In sending them to

It is plain to my mind that the writer of the Declaration  
of Independence and founder of our institutions regarded  
the welfare of the greatest number of people to be of bigher  
value than the written law, and that if a majority of the  
people, whether men or women, desired to exercise a right,  
or a supposed right, that they could and would do so, thus  
proving that the will of the masses is law, nature’s law, and  
above written law. . The people ratify, the Constitution
