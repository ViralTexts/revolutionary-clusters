At a meeting of the Comittee of Correspondence appointed by the  
Delagates of Forty five Volunteer Corps, assembled at Lisburn on the 1st. July Inst.,  
held at Belfast 19 July 1783— Present—  
  
Leiut. Col. Sharman, in the ChairMajor Burden—  
Captain CunninghamCaptain Prentice  
Captain MooreCaptain Crawford  
Leiut. Tomband Mr. Robert Thompson,  
Ordered, that the following Letter, signed by the Secretary in the  
Name of this Comittee, be forwarded to  
his Excellency Benjamin Franklin Inclosing a Copy of the Resolutions of the Provincial  
meeting of Volunteers of Munster, &amp; of the proceedings of the forty five Volunteer  
Delagates assembled at Lisburn on the 1st. Inst. respecting a Parlimentary Reform, as  
also a Copy of the Circular Letter written this day by this Comittee to the several  
Volunteer Corps of this Province—  
  
  
Sir  
Belfast 19 July 1783  
  
Your attachment to the rights of mankind, induce us to address you on the present great and momentous occasion—  
The Spirit of freedom, which pervades all ranks of people in Ireland, with the Justice  
&amp; wise policy of the British Nation, having forever removed all possible cause of  
Jealousy between the Sister Kingdoms, and united us to Britain on the basis of equal  
liberty &amp; similar Constitution; it becomes the Duty, as it is the interest of each  
Kingdom to assist the other in their endeavours to restore to its ancient purity &amp;  
vigour, a decayed, enfeebled &amp; sickly Constitution.  
In both nations it is now generally acknowledged that this great object can be obtained  
by no other means, but by a reform of the representation in  
Parliament— In England, the measure has for the present miscarried, tho’ supported by so  
many wise, honest, great &amp; independent men— We trust however it has misscarried only for a  
Season, &amp; that the next attempt will prove successfull— Ireland has now taken up the  
Idea, and if we shall be so happy as to see success crown our efforts, we think  
considerable weight will be thereby added to the endeavours of the freinds of the People  
in England. The People of the two nations united in pursuit of the same important  
object, must be not only powerfull but irrisistable.  
The inclosed papers, which we request you may peruse, will show how far this Country  
has already gone in determining to procure a more equal Representation; the unanimous  
resolutions of about fifteen thousand Volunteers, already declared in a very few weeks,  
assure us the resolves of the Delagates of Ulster, who are to assemble at Dungannon on  
the 8th Sepr. next, will be no less unanimous and we will know that what the Volunteers (vast numbers of whom are freeholders) shall determine on, the other  
freeholders and people in general, who are not Volunteers, will adopt &amp; Support by  
every means in their power—the aged fathers cannot differ from their Sons, respecting a  
matter on which depends every thing, that either holds dear for themselves, or their  
Posterity—  
That you may see the very depraved state of our representation it is necessary to  
observe, that out of three hundred Members, of which our House of Commons consists, two  
hundred &amp; twenty are returned by Boroughs. Those one hundred &amp; ten Bouroughs are  
divided into three Classes— 1st. Those where the right of Election is vested in the  
Protestant Inhabitants at large— 2d Those where the right of Election is vested, in the  
Chief Majestrate Burgesses &amp; Freemen— 3d Those where the right of Election is  
confined to the Chief Majestrate &amp; Burgesses— frequently not exceeding five or Six  
in number &amp; seldom above ten or twelve—  
Almost all the Boroughs are venal &amp; Corrupt, or implicitly obedient to the arbitary  
will of their respective Land lords, who dictate to the Electors in the most absolute  
manner, those Land lords, claim by prescription a kind of property in those Boroughs,  
which they transfer by sale, like an Estate, &amp; receive from eight thousand to Nine  
thousand pounds for a Borough. And a seat for a Bourough is generally sold for Two  
thousand pounds, so that every Seven or Eight Years, the borough brings In Four thousand  
pounds to the Patron— Unhappily for Ireland our Counties are also too much governed by  
our Peers—&amp; great men, whose influence over many of their respective tenants is very  
great, &amp; this consideration has given rise here, to a doubt in the minds of many  
well meaning men, as to the propriety of adding to the Number of knights of the Shire—as  
generally now two great families endeavour to divide between them the Seats for the  
County, the others remain Neuter or join the independent interest, it is alledged were  
there Six Seats for the County—six great families woud  
divide them, and against such a junction, the independent freeholders woud not be able  
to make any effectual opposition—  
May we now intreat as a most important favour conferred on not only us, but on this  
Kingdom, that you may be pleased to favour us with your  
sentiments &amp; advice, as to the best, most eligible &amp; most practicable mode of  
destroying, restraining, or counteracting this Hydra of Corruption, Borough Influence;  
that we may be enabled to lay yr. opinion before the Provincial assembly of Delagates at  
Dungannon; and as our last meeting for arranging buisness previous thereunto, is fixed  
to be on the twentieth of August, we hope you will be obliging enough, to forward your  
reply so as to be with us about that time—  
Many apologies are due for this long address &amp; for the very great trouble we have  
requested you to take, but we are Young in Politicks, &amp; wish for information from  
men of more wisdom— experience—&amp; abilities. This however we may venture to assert,  
that if we can only be directed to the best mode, The mass of the inhabitants of Ireland  
is at this moment so compleatly alive &amp; sensible to the necessity of a well digested  
Reform— that there cannot remain a doubt, that what it attempts in conjunction with the  
Virtuous part of England, must be effectual—  
The several matters on which we have requested your opinion are thrown into one Veiw in  
the following Queries— In order to the purity of Parliament &amp; to restore that  
constitutional controul, which the constituent body shoud have over the  
Representative—  
1st. Is it necessary that the Boroughs, when the right of election is  
vested in a few, and which in general are at the absolute disposal of one or two  
persons—should be disfranchised, and in their place the County Representatives  
increased—  
2d The protestant inhabitants consist of near one million who return  
three hundred members, woud it be wise to encrease the Number of Representatives of the  
Nation at large?  
3d A plausible objection (mentioned above) has been raised against an  
increase of County Representatives, has that argument much weight, and if it has—is it  
remediable—  
4th. Should the right of suffrage be extended, and if it should, who  
are the proper objects of such extension—?  
5th. In order to gaurd against undue influence woud it be wise to  
have the Members returned by Ballot?  
  
6th. Woud not a limitation of the duration of Parliaments to a  
shorter term then eight Years have excellent effects, &amp; shd. it be less then  
triennial?  
7th. If the abolition of the enslaved Boroughs is necessary, woud it  
be equitable or expedient, that they be purchased by the Nation—  
8th. What specific mode of Reform, in the representation of Ireland  
best suits your own Ideas—considering the situation of this Country and what are the  
Steps which you conceive best adapted to effect the Reform—  
You will be so obliging as to direct your reply to our Chairman Leiut. Col. Sharman at  
Lisburn—  
The long Connexion that has

The Spirit of Freedom which pervades:  
all Ranks of People in Ireland with the  
Juſtice and wiſe policy of the Britiſh Na-

_ Cauſe of Jealouſy between the Siſter King-

it becomes the Duty, as it is the Intereſt  
of each Kingdom to affiſt the other in  
their Endeavours to reſtore to its antient  
Purity and Vigour a decay&#x27;d, enfeebled  
and fickly Conſtitution. In both Nations  
it is now generally acknowledged, that  
this great Object can be attained by 20  
other Means but by a Reform of the Re-  
preſentation in Parliament. In England  
the Meaſure has for the preſent miſcarri-

ſucceſsful. |  
  
Ireland has now taken up the Idea, and  
if we ſhall be ſo happy as to ſee Succeſs:

for Jreland our counties are alſo too much governed

priety of adding to the number of knights of the

laſt meeting for arranging buſineſs previous thereto,  
is fixed to be on the twentieth of Auguſt, we hope  
you will be obliging enough to forward your reply,  
ſo as to be with us about that time.  
  
MANY apologies are due for this long addreſs, and  
for the very great trouble we have requeſted you to  
take, - but we are yoting in politicks, and wiſh for  
information from men of more wiſdom, experience  
and abilities. This however we may venture to  
aſſert, that if we can only be directed to the beſ?  
mode, the maſs of the inhabitants of Ireland is ſu  
compleatly alive and ſenſible to the neceſſity of a  
well-digeſted reform, that there cannot remain #  
doubt that what it attempts, in conjunction with  
the virtuous part of England, muſt be effectual.  
  
Tu ſeveral matters on which we have requeſted  
your opinion are thrown | into one view in the follow-  
ing queries.  
  
Ix order to the purity of parliament, and 1 to te  
ſtore that conſtitutional controul which the conſti-  
tuent body, fhould have over the repreſentative,  
rſt. Is it neceſſary that the boroughs, where the  
elective ſuffrage is veſted in a few, and which in ge-  
  
neral are at the abſolute diſpoſal of one or two per-  
_ fons, ſhould be disfranchiſed, and ia their place the  
county repreſentatives encreaſed ?  
  
ad. Taz  
  
( 26  
2d. Tux proteſtant inhabitants conſiſt of near one  
million, who return three hundred members; would  
  
it be wiſe to encreaſe the number of repreſentatives  
for the nation at large?  
  
3d. A plauſible objection, mentioned before, has  
been made againſt an encreaſe of county repreſenta-  
tives; has that nent much weight, and if it has,  
is it remediable ?  
  
4th. SHoutD ſuffrage be extended; and if it  
ſhould, who are the proper objects of ſuch extenſion ?  
  
th. Ix order to guard againſt undue influence,  
would it be wiſe to have the members returned by  
ballot ?  
  
6th. Would not a limitation of the duration of par-  
liament, to a ſhorter term than eight years, have  
excellent effects; and ſhould it be leſs than trien-  
nial ?  
  
.7th. If the abolition of the enſlaved boronghs&#x27; is  
neceſſary; would it be equitable or . that  
they be purchaſed by the nation? ä  
  
Sth. WHAT ſpecific mode of reform in the repre-  
ſentation of Ireland beſt ſtiits your own ideas—con-  
  
  
the ſteps which you conceive beſt * to effect  
that reform?  
  
You will be fo obligiog as to direct your reply to  
our Chairman Lieut. Col. Sharman, at Liſburn.

have requeited your Grace to take; but we are  
young in politics, and with for information from  
raen of more wifdom, experience, and abilities.

if we cag only be direéted to the beit mode, the.  
mafs of the inhabitants of Ireland is at this  
moment fo completely, alive and feafible th the  
neceflity of a well-digefted reform, that there  
cannot remain a doubt that what it attempts in,  
conjunction with the virtuous part of “England  
will be effectual. . The feveral matters on which :  
we have requefted your Grace’s opinion are  
thrown into one view in the following queries:
