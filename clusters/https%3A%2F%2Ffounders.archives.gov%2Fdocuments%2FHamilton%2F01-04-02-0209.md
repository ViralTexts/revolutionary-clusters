[New York, February 22, 1788]  
  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
THE natural order of the subject leads us to consider in this place, that provision of the Constitution which authorises the national Legislature to regulate in the last resort the election of its own members. It is in these words—“The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law, make or alter such regulations except as to places of choosing senators.”  
  
I Clause, 4 Sect. of the 1st Art.  
  
This provision has not only been declaimed against by those who condemn the Constitution in the gross; but it has been censured by those, who have objected with less latitude and greater moderation; and in one instance, it has been thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the advocate of every other part of the system.  
I am greatly mistaken, notwithstanding, if there be any article in the whole plan more completely defensible than this. Its propriety rests upon the evidence of this plain proposition, that every government ought to contain in itself the means of its own preservation. Every just reasoner will at first sight, approve an adherence to this rule, in the work of the Convention; and will disapprove every deviation from it, which may not appear to have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the work some particular ingredient, with which a rigid conformity to the rule was incompatible. Even in this case, though he may acquiesce in the necessity; yet he will not cease to regard a departure from so fundamental a principle, as a portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of future weakness and perhaps anarchy.  
It will not be alledged that an election law could have been framed and inserted into the Constitution, which would have been always applicable to every probable change in the situation of the country; and it will therefore not be denied that a discretionary power over elections ought to exist somewhere. It will, I presume, be as readily conceded, that there were only three ways, in which this power could have been reasonably modified and disposed, that it must either have been lodged wholly in the National Legislature, or wholly in the State Legislatures, or primarily in the latter, and ultimately in the former. The last mode has with reason been preferred by the Convention. They have submitted the regulation of elections for the Fœderal Government in the first instance to the local administrations; which in ordinary cases, and when no improper views prevail, may be both more convenient and more satisfactory; but they have reserved to the national authority a right to interpose, whenever extraordinary circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its safety.  
Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the National Government, in the hands of the State Legislatures, would leave the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment annihilate it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to administer its affairs. It is to little purpose to say that a neglect or omission of this kind, would not be likely to take place. The constitutional possibility of the thing, without an equivalent for the risk, is an unanswerable objection. Nor has any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that risk. The extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can never be dignified with that character. If we are in a humour to presume abuses of power, it is as fair to presume them on the part of the State Governments, as on the part of the General Government. And as it is more consonant to the rules of a just theory to intrust the Union with the care of its own existence, than to transfer that care to any other hands; if abuses of power are to be hazarded, on the one side, or on the other, it is more rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be placed, than where it would unnaturally be placed.  
Suppose an article had been introduced into the Constitution, empowering the United States to regulate the elections for the particular States, would any man have hesitated to condemn it, both as an unwarrantable transposition of power, and as a premeditated engine for the destruction of the State governments? The violation of principle in this case would have required no comment; and to an unbiassed observer, it will not be less apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the National Government, in a similar respect to the pleasure of the State governments. An impartial view of the matter cannot fail to result in a conviction, that each, as far as possible, ought to depend on itself for its own preservation.  
As an objection to this position, it may be remarked, that the Constitution of the national Senate, would involve in its full extent the danger which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the State Legislatures to regulate the fœderal elections. It may be alledged, that by declining the appointment of Senators they might at any time give a fatal blow to the Union; and from this, it may be inferred, that as its existence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in so essential a point, there can be no objection to entrusting them with it, in the particular case under consideration. The interest of each State, it may be added, to maintain its representation in the national councils, would be a complete security against an abuse of the trust.

amination be found solid. It is certainly true, that the State Legislatures, by forbearing the appointment of Senators, may destroy the National Government. But it will not follow, that because they have the power to do this in one instance, they ought to have it in every other. There are cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far more decisive, without any motive, equally cogent with that which must have regulated the conduct of the Convention, in respect to the construction of the Senate, to recommend their admission into the system. So far as that construction may expose the Union to the possibility of injury from the State Legislatures, it is an evil; but it is an evil, which could not have been avoided without excluding the States, in their political capacities, wholly from a place in the organization of the National Government. If this had been done, it would doubtless have been interpreted into an entire dereliction of the fœderal principle; and would certainly have deprived the State governments of that absolute safe-guard, which they wil

 The joint result of these circumstances would be, that a temporary combination of a few States, to intermit the appointment of Senators, could neither annul the existence nor impair the activity of the body: And it is not from a general or permanent combination of the States, that we can have any thing to fear. The first might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members of a few of the State Legislatures; the last would suppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people; which will either never exist at all, or will in all probability proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the General Government to the advancement of their happiness; in which event no good citizen could desire its continuance.  
But with regard to the Fœderal House of Representatives, there is intended to be a general election of members once in two years. If the State Legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of regulating these elections, every period of making them would be a delicate crisis in the national situation; which might issue in a dissolution of the Union, if the leaders of a few of the most important States should have entered into a previous conspiracy to prevent an election.  
I shall not deny that there is a degree of weight in the obs

Mr. Hamilton devoted three numbers of the Fe-  
deralist to this provision of the constitution; and in  
his luminous exposition of it are found these pas-  
sages: ‘They have submitted the regulatioas of elec-

national situation; which might issue in dissolution

legislatures, would leave the existence of the  
Union entirely at their mercy. They eonltl at

ancous expositions of the founders of the  
Constitution. Thus Alexander Hamilton,  
in the Federalist, says:  
It will not be denied that a discretionary pow  
er over elections ought to exist somewhere. It  
will, I presume, be as readily conceded, that  
there were only three ways in which this pow­  
r could have been reasonably organized; that  
it must either have been lodged wholly in the na  
tional legislature, or wholly in the state leg­  
islatures, or primarily in the latter, and ulti  
mately in the former. The last mode has, with  
reason, been preferred by the convention. They  
have submitted the regulations of elections for  
the Pederal government, in the first instance,  
to the local administrations, which, in ordin  
ary cares and when no improper views prevail  
may be both more convenient and more satis  
factory; but they have reserved to the nation­  
al authority a right to interfere, wchenerer er­  
traordinary circumstances might render that  
interposition necessary to its safely.  
Nothing can be more evident than that an  
exclusive power of regulating elections for the  
national government in the hands of the state  
legislatures, would leave the existence of the  
Union entirely at their own mercy.  
Yet one would suppose from the utter  
ances of the democratic press, and of demo  
cratic&quot; spouters&quot; in and out of Congress,  
that there is no power vested in the nationa  
legislature to meddle with elections in the  
states at all, nor to prescribe methods for th

speculation it may be said that Congress would probably have  
had some power to control federal elections without such express  
provision ; for, in the event of a State’s refusing to provide for an  
election, it is not likely that the resources of the Constitution  
would fail to preserve the government.  
  
In early days it was thought that the power could be exercised  
only when necessity demanded. Hamilton apparently saw merely  
a reservation of a right to the national government “to interpose  
whenever extraordinary circumstances might render that interpo-  
sition necessary to its safety.” ? Atall events, it was thought that  
the power would not be exerted unless occasion absolutely re-

The natural order of the subject leads ns  
to consider in this place that provision of  
the Constitution which authorizes the na­  
tional legislature to regulate, in the last  
resort, the election of its own members. It  
is in these words: &quot;The times, places and  
manner of holding elections in each State  
shall be prescribed by the Legislature  
therof; but the CongrtbS may at any time  
by law mak) or alter such regulations, ex­  
cept as to the place of choosing Senators.&quot;  
This provision has not only been declaimed  
against by those who condemn the Consti­  
tution in the gross, but it has been cen­  
sured by those who nave objected with less  
latitude and gt eater moderation. I am  
greatly mistaken, notwithstanding, if  
there be any other article iu the whole  
flan more completely defensible than this,  
ts propriety rests upon the evidence of  
this plain proposition: that every govern­  
ment ought .to contain withiu itself tho  
means of its own preservation. Every  
just reasoner will at tirst sight approve an  
adherence to this rule in the work of tho  
convention, and will disapprove every de­  
viation from it which may not appear to  
have been dictated by the necessity of in­  
corporating into the work some particular  
ingredient with which a rigid conformity  
to tho rule was incompatible. it  
will not be alleged that nn election law  
could have been framed and inserted in tho  
Constitution which would have been ap­  
plicable to every probable change in the  
situation or the country; and it will, there­  
fore, not be denied that a discretionary  
power over elections ought to exist some­  
where. It will, 1 presume, be as readily  
conceded that there were only tftree ways  
in which this power could have been rea­  
sonably organized: that it must either have  
beeu lodged wholly in the national legisla­  
ture, or wholly in the State Legislatures,  
or primarily in the latter and ultimately in  
the former. The last mode has, with rea­  
son, been preferred by the convention.  
They have submitted the reculations for  
the federal government, in the first  
instance, to the local administra­  
tions, which, in ordinary cases and  
when no improper views prevail,  
may be both more convenient and more  
satisfactory; but they have reserved to the  
national authority a right to interfere  
whenever extraordinary circumstances  
might render that interposition necessary  
to its safety. Nothing can be more evident  
than that an exclusive power of reeulatinir  
elections for the national government in  
the hands of the State Legislature would  
leave the existence of the Union entirely  
at their mercy. If we aio in a  
humor to presume the abuses of power, it is  
as fair to presume them on the pare of the  
State government as on the part of the gen­  
eral government. And, as it is more con­  
sonant to the rules of a great theory to in­  
trust the Union with the care of its own  
existence than to transfer that care to any  
other hands, if abuses of power are to be  
hazarded on one side or the other, it is  
more rational to hazard them where the  
power would naturally be placed than  
where it would unnaturally be placed.  
This shows Hamilton&#x27;s views in re­  
gard to the wisdom of that clause of  
the Constitution which gives Congress  
tho right&#x27;to regulate and control nation
