shington November 5th 1811  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
In calling you together sooner than, a separation from your homes, would otherwise have been required; I yielded to considerations, drawn from the posture of our foreign affairs; and in fixing the present, for the time of your meeting; regard was had to the probability of further developements of the policy of the Belligerent Powers towards this Country, which might the more unite the national councils, in the measures to be pursued.  
At the close of the last session of Congress, it was hoped, that the successive confirmations of the extinction of the French Decrees, so far as they violated our neutral commerce, would have induced the Government of Great Britain to repeal its orders in Council; and thereby authorize a removal of the existing obstructions, to her commerce with the United States.  
Instead of this reasonable step towards satisfaction and friendship between the two nations, the orders were, at a moment when least to have been expected, put into more rigorous execution; and it was communicated through the British Envoy just arrived, that, whilst the revocation of the Edicts of France, as officially made known to the British Government, was denied to have taken place; it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the British orders, that commerce should be restored to a footing, that would admit the productions and manufactures of Great Britain, when owned by neutrals, into markets shut against them by her Enimy; the United States being given to understand that, in the mean time, a continuance of their non-importation Act, would lead to measures of retaliation.  
At a later date, it has indeed appeared, that a communication to the British Government, of fresh evidence of the repeal of the French Decrees against our neutral trade, was followed by an intimation, that it had been transmitted to the British Plenipotentiary here; in order that it might receive full consideration, in the depending discussions. This communication appears not to have been received: But the transmission of it hither, instead of founding on it, an actual repeal of the orders, or assurances that the repeal would ensue, will not permit us to rely, on any effective change in the British Cabinet. To be ready to meet with cordiality, satisfactory proofs of such a change; and to proceed, in the mean time, in adapting our measures to the views which have been disclosed through that Minister, will best consult our whole duty.  
In the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures, indemnity and redress for other wrongs, have continued to be withheld; and our Coasts and the mouths of our harbours, have again witnessed scenes, not less derogatory to the dearest of our national rights, than vexatious to the regular course of our trade.  
Among the occurrences produced by the conduct of British ships of war, hovering on our Coasts, was an encounter between one of them, and the American Frigate commanded by Captain Rodgers, rendered unavoidable on the part of the latter, by a fire, commenced without cause, by the former; whose commander is, therefore, alone chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed, in maintaining the honor of the American flag. The proceedings of a Court of Enquiry requested by Captain Rodgers, are communicated; together with the correspondence relating to the occurrence, between the Secretary of State and His Britannic Majestys Envoy. To these are added, the several correspondences, which have passed on the subject of the British Orders in Council; and to both, the correspondence relating to the Floridas, in which Congress will be made acquainted with the interposition, which the Government of Great Britain has thought proper to make, against the proceedings of the United States.  
The justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of the United States towards France, both before and since the revocation of her Decrees, authorized an expectation, that her Government would have followed up that measure by all such others as were due to our reasonable claims, as well as dictated by its amicable professions. No proof, however, is yet given, of an intention to repair the other wrongs done to the United States; and particularly, to restore the great amount of American property, seized and condemned, under Edicts; which, though not affecting our neutral relations, and therefore not entering into questions between the United States and other Belligerents, were nevertheless founded in such unjust principles, that the reparation ought to have been prompt and ample.  
In addition to this, and other demands of strict right, on that nation: the United States have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and unexpected restrictions, to which their trade with the French dominions has been subjected; and which, if not discontinued, will require at least, corresponding restrictions on importations from France into the United States.  
On all those subjects our Minister Plenipotentiary, lately sent to Paris, has carried with him the necessary instructions; the result of which will be communicated to you; and by ascertaining the ulterior policy of the French Government towards the United States, will enable you to adapt to it, that of the United States, towards France.  
Our other foreign relations remain without unfavorable changes. With Russia, they are on the best footing of friendship. The Ports of Sweeden have afforded proofs of friendly dispositions towards our commerce, in the Councils of that Nation also. And the information from our Special Minister to Denmark, shews that the Mission had been attended with valuable effects to our Citizens, whose property had been so extensively violated and endangered, by Cruisers under the Danish flag.  
Under the ominous indications which commanded attention, it became a duty, to exert the means committed to the Executive Department, in providing for the general security. The works of defence on our maritime frontier, have accordingly, been prosecuted with an activity, leaving little to be added for the completion of the most important ones; and, as particularly suited for co-operations in emergencies, a portion of the Gun-boats have, in particular harbours been ordered into use. The ships of war before in commission, with the addition of a Frigate, have been chiefly employed, as a cruising Guard to the rights of our Coast. And such a disposition has been made, of our land forces, as was thought to promise the services most appropriate and important. In this disposition is included, a force consisting of regulars and militia, embodied in the Indiana Territory, and marched towards our Northwestern frontier. This measure was made requisite by several murders and depredations committed by Indians; but more especially, by the menacing preparations and aspect of a combination of them on the Wabash, under the influence and direction of a Fanatic of the Shawanese Tribe. With these exceptions, the Indian Tribes retain their peaceable dispositions towards us, and their usual pursuits.  
I must now add, that the period is arrived, which claims from the Legislative G[u]ardians of the National rights, a system of more ample provisions for maintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous justice, the protracted moderation, and the multiplied efforts on the part of the United States, to substitute, for the accumulating dangers to the peace of the two Countries, all the mutual advantages, of re-established friendship and confidence; we have seen that the British Cabinet perseveres, not only in withholding a remedy for other wrongs, so long and so loudly calling for it; but in the execution, brought home to the threshold of our Territory, of measures which, under existing circumstances, have the character, as well as the effect, of war on our lawful commerce.  
With this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trampling on rights which no Independent Nation can relinquish; Congress will feel the duty of putting the United States into an armour, and an attitude demanded by the crisis, and corresponding with the national spirit and expectations.  
I recommend, accordingly, that adequate provision be made, for filling the ranks, and prolonging the enlistments of the regular troops; for an auxiliary force, to be engaged for a more limited term; for the acceptance of volunteer Corps, whose patriotic arder [sic] may court a participation in urgent services; for detachments, as they be wanted, of other portions of the Militia; and for such a preparation of the great Body, as will proportion its usefulness, to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the occasion fail to remind you, of the importance of those Military Seminaries, which, in every event, will form a valuable and frugal part of our Military establishment.  
The manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with due success, and the stock and resources of all the necessary munitions, are adequate to emergencies. It will not be inexpedient, however, for Congress to authorize an enlargement of them.  
Your attention will of course be drawn to such provisions, on the subject of our naval force, as may be required for the services to which it may be best adapted. I submit to Congress, the seasonableness also, of an authority to augment the stock of such materials, as are imperishable in their nature, or may not at once be attainable.  
In contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous Epoch, and estimating their claims to our attention, it is impossible to overlook those developing themselves, among the great communities, which occupy the southern portion of our own hemisphere, and extend into our neighbourhood. An enlarged philanthropy, and an enlightened forecast, concur in imposing on the national Councils, an obligation to take a deep interest in their destinies; to cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will; to regard the progress of Events; and not to be unprepared, for whatever order of things, may be ultimately established.  
Under another aspect of our situation, the early attention of Congress will be due, to the expediency of further guards, against evasions and infractions of our Commercial laws. The practice of smuggling, which is odious every where, and particularly criminal in free Governments, where, the laws being made by all for the good of all, a fraud is committed on every individual as well as on the State, attains its utmost guilt, when it blends with a pursuit of ignominious gain, a treacherous subserviency, in the transgressors, to a foreign policy, adverse to that of their own Country. It is then, that the virtuous indignation of the public, should be enabled to manifest itself, through the regular animadversions, of the most competent laws.  
To secure greater respect to our mercantile flag, and to the honest interests which it covers; it is expedient also, that it be made punishable in our Citizens, to accept licences from foreign Governments, for a trade unlawfully interdicted by them, to other American Citizens; or to trade under false Colour or papers of any sort.  
A prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance, by our Citizens, of special licences, to be used in a trade with the United States; and against the admission into particular ports of the United States, of vessels from foreign Countries, authorized to trade with particular ports only.  
Altho’ other subjects will press more immediately on your deliberations, a portion of them cannot but be well bestowed, on the just and sound policy, of securing to our manufactures, the success they have attained, and are still attaining, in some degree under the impulse of causes not permanent; and to our navigation, the fair extent, of which it is at present abridged by the unequal regulations of foreign Governments.  
Besides the reasonableness of saving our manufacturers from sacrifices, which a change of circumstances might bring on them; the national interest requires, that, with respect to such articles at least, as belong to our defence, and our primary wants, we should not be left in unnecessary dependance on external supplies. And whilst Foreign Governments adhere to the existing discriminations in their ports, against our navigation; and an equality or lesser discrimination, is enjoyed by their navigation, in our ports, the effect cannot be mistaken, because it has been seriously felt by our shipping Interests: and in proportion as this takes place, the advantages of an independent conveyance of our products to foreign markets, and of a growing body of mariners, trained by their occupations for the service of their Country in times of danger, must be diminished.  
The receipts into the Treasury, during the year ending on the thirtieth of september last, have exceeded thirteen Millions and a half of Dollars; and have enabled us to defray the current expences, including the Interest on the public debt, and to reimburse more than five Millions of Dollars, of the principal; without recurring to the loan authorized by the Act of the last session. The temporary loan obtained in the latter end of the year one thousand eight hundred and ten, has also been reimbursed, and is not included in that amount.  
The decrease of revenue arising from the situation of our commerce, and the extraordinary expences which have and may become necessary, must be taken into view, in making commensurate provisions for the ensuing year. And I recommend to your consideration, the propriety of ensuring a sufficiency of annual revenue, at least to defray the ordinary expences of Government, and to pay the interest on the public debt; including that on new loans which may be authorized.  
I cannot close this communication, without expressing my deep sense of the crisis in which you are assembled, my confidence in a wise and honorable result to your deliberations, and assurances of the faithful zeal with which my co-operating duties will be discharged; invoking, at the same time, the blessing of Heaven on our beloved Country, and on all the means that may be employed, in vindicating its rights, and advancing its welfare.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of  
  
the House of Representatives,  
  
In calling you together sooner than  
a separation from your homes would  
otherwise have been required, I yield¬  
ed to considerations drawn from the  
posture of our foreign affairs ; and in  
fixing the present for the time of your  
meeting, regard was had to the pro¬  
bability of further developments of the  
belligerent powers towards this coun¬  
try, which might the more unite the  
national councils in the measures to be

EDINBURGH ANNUAL ROISTER, 1811.  
  
At the close of the last session of  
congress, it was hoped that the suc¬  
cessive confirmations of the extinction  
of the French decrees, so far as they  
violated our neutral commerce, would  
have induced the government of Great  
Britain to repeal its orders in council;  
and thereby authorize a removal of the  
existing obstructions to her comyierce  
with the United States.  
  
Instead of this reasonable step to¬  
wards satisfaction and friendship be&gt;  
tween the two nations, the orders were,  
at a moment when least to have been  
expected, put into more rigorous exe¬  
cution ; and it was communicated,  
through the British envoy just arrived,  
that, whilst the revocation of the edicts  
of France, as officially made known to  
the British government, was denied to  
have taken place, it was an indispen¬  
sable condition of the repeal of the Bri¬  
tish orders, that commerce should be  
restored to a footing, that would admit  
the productions and manufactures of  
Great Britain, when owned by neu¬  
trals, into markets shut against them  
by her enemy ; the United States be¬  
ing given to understand, that, in the  
mean time, a continuance of their non¬  
importation act would lead to measures  
of retaliation.  
  
At a later date, it has, indeed, ap-  
  
E ;ared, that a communication to the  
ritish government, of fresh evidence  
of the repeal of the French decrees  
against our neutral trade, was follow¬  
ed by an intimation, that it had been  
transmitted to the British plenipoten¬  
tiary here, in order that it might re¬  
ceive full consideration in the depend¬  
ing discussions. This communication  
appears not to have been received;  
but the transmission of it hither, in¬  
stead of founding on it an actual re¬  
peal of the orders, or assurances that  
the repeal would ensue, will not per¬  
mit us to rely on any effective change  
in the British cabinet. To be ready  
Jo meet with cordiality satisfactory  
  
proofsof such a change, and to proceed,  
in the mean time, in adapting our mea¬  
sures to the views which have been dis¬  
closed through that minister, will best  
consult our whole duty.  
  
In the unfriendly spirit of those dis¬  
closures, indemnity and redress for  
other wrongs have continued to be  
withheld ; and our coasts and the  
mouths of our harbours- have again  
witnessed scenes, not less derogatory  
to the dearest of our national rights  
than vexatious to the regular course  
of our trade.  
  
Among the occurrences produced  
by the conduct of British ships of war  
hovering on our coasts, was an encoun¬  
ter between one of them and the Ame¬  
rican frigate commanded by Captain  
Rodgers, rendered unavoidable on the  
part of the latter, by a fire commenced  
without cause by the former; whose  
commander is, therefore, alone charge¬  
able with the blood unfortunately  
shed in maintaining the honour of the  
American flag. The proceedings of  
a court of enquiry, requested by Capt.  
Rodgers, are communicated; toge¬  
ther with the correspondence relating  
to the occurrence, between the Secre¬  
tary of State and his Britannic Majes¬  
ty’s envoy. To these are added, the  
several correspondences which have  
passed on the subject of the British  
orders in council; and to both, the  
correspondence relatingto the Floridas,  
in which Congress will be made ac¬  
quainted with the interposition which  
the government of Great Britain has  
thought proper to make against the  
proceedings of the United States.  
  
The justice and fairness which have  
been evinced on the part of the United  
States towards France, both before  
and since the revocation of her de¬  
crees, authorized an expectation that  
her government would have followed  
up that measure by all such others as  
were due to our reasonable claims, as  
well as dictated by its amicable pro-

fessions. No proof, however, is yet  
given of an intention to repair the  
other wrongs done to the United  
States; and, particularly, to restore  
the great amount of American pro¬  
perty seized and condemned under  
edicts, which, though not affecting  
our neutral relations, and therefore,  
not entering into questions between  
the United States and other bellige-  
rents, were nevertheless founded in  
such unjust principles, that the repa¬  
ration ought to have been prompt and  
ample.  
  
In addition to this and other de-  
^nands of strict right on that nation,  
the United States have much reason  
to be dissatisBed with the rigorous and  
unexpected restrictions to which their  
trade with the French dominions has  
been subjected; and which, if not dis¬  
continued, will require at least corre¬  
sponding restrictions on importations  
from France into the United States.  
  
On all those subjects our minister  
plenipotentiary, lately sent to Paris,  
has carried with him the necessary in¬  
structions ; the result of which will be  
communicated to you ; and by ascer¬  
taining the ulterior policy of the French  
government towards the United States,  
will enable you to adapt to it that of  
the United States towards France.  
  
Our other foreign relations remain  
without unfavourable changes. With  
Russia, they are on the best footing of  
friendship. The ports of Sweden have  
afforded proofs of friendly dispositions  
towards our commerce in the councils  
of that nation also. And the informa¬  
tion from dur special minister to Den¬  
mark, shews, that the mission had been  
attended with valuable effects to our  
citizens, whose property had been so  
extensively violated and endangered by  
cruisers under the Danish flag.  
  
Under the ominous indications which  
commanded attention, it became a duty  
to exert the means committed to the  
executive department, in providing for  
  
the general security. The works of  
defence on our maritime frontier have  
accordingly been prosecuted with an  
activity leaving little to be added for  
the completion of the most important  
ones; and, as particularly suited for  
co-operation in emergencies, a portion  
of the gun-boats have, in particular  
harboyrs, been ordered into use. The  
ships of war before in commission,  
with the addition of a frigate, have  
been chiefly employed as a cruising  
guard to the rights of our coast; and  
such a disposition has been made of  
our land forces, as was thought to pro¬  
mise the services most appropriate and  
important: In this disposition is in¬  
cluded a force, consisting of regulars  
and militia, embodied in the Indiana  
territory, and marched towards our  
north-western frontier. This measure  
was made requisite by several murders  
and depredations Committed by In¬  
dians ; but more especially by the me¬  
nacing preparations and aspect of a  
combination of them on the Wabash,  
under the influence and direction of a  
fanatic of the Shawanese tribe. With  
these exceptions, the Indian tribes re¬  
tain their peaceable dispositions towards  
us, and their usual pursuits.  
  
I must now add, that the period is  
arrived, which claims from the legisla¬  
tive guardians of the national rights a  
system of more ample provisions for  
maintaining them.—Notwithstanding  
the scrupulous justice, the protracted  
moderation, and the multiplied efforts  
on the part of the United States, to  
substitute, for the accumulating dan¬  
gers to the peace of the two countries,  
all the mutual advantages of re-esta¬  
blished friendship and confidence, we  
have seen that the British cabinet per¬  
severes, not only in withholding a re¬  
medy for other wrongs, so long and so  
loudly calling for it, but in theexecutiou  
brought home to the threshold of our  
territory, of measures which, under  
existing circumstances, have the cha-  
1

racter as well as the effect of war on  
our lawful commerce.  
  
With this evidence of hostile inflexi-  
bility, in trampling on rights which  
no independent nation can relinquish,  
congress will feel the duty of putting  
the United States into an armour and  
an attitude demanded by the crisis, and  
corresponding with the national spirit  
and expectations.  
  
I recommend, accordingly, that ade¬  
quate provision be made for filling the  
ranks and prolonging the enlistments  
of the regular troops ; for an auxiliary  
force, to be engaged for a more limited  
time ; for the acceptance of volunteer  
corps, whose patriotic ardour may  
court a participation in urgent servi¬  
ces ; for detachments, as they may be  
wanted, of other portions of the mili¬  
tia ; and for such a preparation of the  
great body, as will proportion its use¬  
fulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor  
can the occasion fail to remind you of  
the importance of those military semi-  
saries, which, in every event, will form  
a valuable and frugal part of our mili¬  
tary establishment.  
  
The manufacture of cannon and  
small arms has proceeded with due  
success, and the stock and resources of  
all the necessary munitions are adequate  
to emergencies. It will not be inex¬  
pedient, however, for congress to au¬  
thorize an enlargement of them.  
  
Your attention will of course be  
drawn to such provisions, on the sub¬  
ject of our nav^ force, as may be re¬  
quired for the services to which it may  
be best adapted. I submit to congress  
the seasonableness, also, of an authori¬  
ty to augment the stock of such mate¬  
rials as are imperishable in their nature,  
er may not at once be attainable.  
  
In contemplating the scenes which  
distinguish this momentous epoch, and  
estimating their claims to our attention,  
it is impossible to overlook those de¬  
veloping themselves among the great  
communities which occupy the south¬  
  
ern portion of our own hemisphere,  
and extend into our neighboumood.  
An enlarged philanthropy, and an  
enlightened forecast, concur in impo¬  
sing on the national councils an obliga¬  
tion to take a deep interest in their  
destinies ; to cherish reciprocal senti¬  
ments of good-will; to regard the pro¬  
gress of events ; and not to be unpre¬  
pared for whatever order of things may  
be ultimately established.  
  
Under another aspect of our situ¬  
ation, the early attention of congress  
will be due to the expediency of further  
guards against evasions and infractions  
of our commercial laws. The practice  
of smuggling, which is odious every  
where, and particularly criminal in free  
governments, where, the laws being  
made by all for the good of all, a fraud  
is committed on every individual as well  
as on the state, attains its utmost guilt,  
when it blends, with a pursuit of igno¬  
minious gain, a treacherous subser¬  
viency, in the transgressors, to a foreign  
policy adverse to that of their own  
country. It is then that the virtuous  
indignation of the public should be  
enabled to manifest itself, through the  
regular animadversions of the most  
competent laws.  
  
To secure greater respect to our  
mercantile flag, and to the honest in¬  
terests which it covers, it is expedient,  
also, that it be made punishable in our  
citizens to accept licences from foreign  
governments, for a trade unlawfully  
interdicted by them to other American  
citizens; or to trade under false co¬  
lours or papers of any sort.  
  
A prohibition is equally called for  
against the acceptance, by our citizens,  
of special licences, to be used in a trade  
with the United States ; and against  
the admission into particular ports of  
the United States, of vessels irom fo¬  
reign countries, authorised to trade  
with particular ports only.

tionty a portion of them cannot but  
be well bestowed on the just and  
sound policy of securing to our manu&gt;  
factures the success they have attained,  
and are still attaining, in some degree,  
under the impulse of causes not per-  
manent; and to our navigation, the  
fair extent of which is at present  
abridged, by the unequal regulations  
of foreign governments.  
  
Besides the reasonableness of saving  
ourmanufacturersfrom sacriiices which  
a change of circumstances might bring  
on them, the national interest requires  
that, with respect to such articles, at  
least, as belong to our defence and our  
primary wants, we should not be left  
in unnecessary dependence on exter&gt;  
nal supplies. And whilst foreign go*  
vernments adhere to the existing dis¬  
criminations in their ports against our  
navigation, and an equality or lesser  
discrimination is enjoyed by their navi-  
ation in our ports, the effect cannot  
e mistaken, because it has been seri¬  
ously felt by our shipping interests;  
and in proportion as this takes place,  
the advantages of an independent con¬  
veyance of our products to foreign  
markets, and of a growing body of  
mariners, trawed by their occupations  
for the service of their country in times  
of danger, must be diminished.  
  
The receipts into the treasury, du¬  
ring the year ending on the SOth of  
September last, have exceeded thirteen  
millions and a half of dollars; and have  
  
enabled us to defray the current ex-  
pences, including the interest on the  
public debt, and to reimburse more than  
Hve millions of dollars of the principal,  
without recurring to the loan autho¬  
rised by the act of the last session.  
The temporary loan obtained in the  
latter end of the year 1810 has also  
been reimbursed, and is not included  
in that amount.  
  
The decrease of revenue, arising  
from the situation of our commerce  
and the extraordinary expences which  
have and may become necessary, must  
be taken into view, in making commen¬  
surate provisions for the ensuing year.  
And I recommend to your consider¬  
ation the propriety of ensuring a suffi¬  
ciency of annual revenue, at least, to  
defray the ordinary expences of go¬  
vernment, and to pay the interest on  
the public debt, including that on  
new loans which may be anthorised.  
  
1 cannot close this communication  
without expressing my deep sense of  
the crisis^n which you are assembled,  
my confidence in a wise and honourable  
result to your deliberations, and assu¬  
rances of the faithful zeal with which  
my cooperating duties will be dischar¬  
ged ; invoking, at the same time, the  
blessing of heaven on our beloved  
country, and on all the means that may  
be employed in vindicating its rights  
and advancing its welfare.

Fellon—Citizens of the Senate, and  
Of the House of Representatives.  
In calling you together sooner than a  
  
seperation from your homes would other­  
wise have been required, I yielded to con­  
siderations drawn from the posture of our  
foreign affairs ; and iti fixing the present  
for the time of your meeting, regard was  
had to the probability of further develope­  
ments of the policy ofthe belligerent pow­  
ers towards this country, which might  
the more unite the national councils, in  
the measures to he pursued.  
At the close ofthe last session of Con­  
gress, it was hoped that the successive  
confirmations of the extinction ol the  
French decrees, so far as they violated onr  
neutral commerce, would have induced  
the government of Great Britain to repeal  
its orders in council, and thereby autho­  
rise a removal of the existing obstructions  
to her commerce with the United States.  
Instead of this reasonable step towards  
satisfaction anil friendship between the two  
nations, the orders were, at a moment  
when least to have been expected, put in­  
to more rigorous execution; and it was  
communicated, through the British Envoy^  
just arrived, that whilst the revocation of  
the Edicts of France, as officially made  
known to ll:e British government, was de­  
nied to have taken place; it was an indis­  
pensable condition ofthe repeal ofthe Bri­  
tish orders, that commerce should he re­  
stored to a footing that would admit the  
productions and manufactures ot Great  
Britain, when owned by neutrals, into  
• markets shut against them by her enemy;  
the United Stales being given to under­  
stand that, in the mean time, a continu­  
. • . IB  
  
anco ol their non—importation act wuuiu  
lead to measure** ol* retaliation.  
*lt a \ xWr d iU\ it has Indeed appeared,  
that a communication to the British gov­  
ernment, of fresh evidence ot the repeal of  
the French detrees against our neutral  
trade, was followed by an intimation, that it  
had l&gt;een transmitted to the British Plenipo­  
tentiary here; in order that it might receive |  
full consideration, in the dcpendingdiscus-j  
sinus. This communication appears not to  
have been received: But the transmission  
of it hither, instead of founding on it an  
actual repeal of the orders, or assurances  
that the repeal would ensue, will not  
permit us to rely on any effective change  
in the British cabinet. To be ready to  
meet with cordiality satisfactory proofs of  
such a change, and to proeeed, in the mean  
time, in adapting our measures to the views  
which have been disclosed through that  
minister* will IkM consult our whole duty,  
in the in.friendly spirit ol those disclosures,  
indemnity and redress for other wrongs have  
continued to he withheld ; and our coasts and  
the mouths of our harbors have again witnes­  
sed scenes, l.ot h ss derogatory to the dearest  
of our national rights, than vexatious to the  
regular course of our trade.  
Among tl»w occurrences produced by the  
conduct of tne liritish ships of war hovering  
on our coasts, was an encounter between one j  
of them and ’Sic American frigate commanded i  
by C iplain Rogers, rendered unavoidable on  
on the part of the latter, bv ;* f:re, commenc­  
ed without ckuse, by the former ; whose coiq­  
mandor is, therefore, alone chaigeable with  
the blood unfortunately shed in maintaining  
the honor of the American flag. The proa  
  
ceedingsof a court of enquiry requested&#x27; by  
Captain Rodgers, are communicated ; toge­  
ther with the correspondence relating to the  
occurrence, between the Secretary of State  
and his Britannic Majesty’s Envoy. To these  
are added the several correspondences which  
have passed on the subject of the British Or­  
ders in Council; and to both, the correspond­  
ence relating to the Floridas, in which Con­  
gress will be made acquainted with the inter­  
position which the government of Great-Bri­  
tain has thought proper to make against the  
proceedings ot the United States.  
The justice and fairness which have been  
evinced ou the part of the United States to­  
wards France, both before and since the re­  
vocation of her Decrees, authorised an cxpec-*  
tation that her government would have follow­  
ed up that measure by all such others as were  
due to our reasonable claims, as well as dic­  
tated by its amicable professions. No proof,  
however, is yet given of an intention to repair  
the other wrongs done to the United States ;  
and particularly to restore the great amount&#x27;  
of American property seized and condemned  
under edicts, which, though not affecting our  
neutral relations, and, therefore, not entering  
into questions between the United States and  
other Belligerents, were nevertheless found­  
ed on such unjust principles, that the repara­  
tion ought to have been prompt and ample.  
In addition to this, and other demands of  
strict right, on that nation; the U. States have  
much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigo­  
rous and unexpected restrictions, to which  
their trade with the French dominions has  
been subjected ; and which, if not discontinu­  
ed, will require at least corresponding restric­  
tions on importations from France into the  
U. States.  
On all those subjects our Minister Plenipo­  
tentiary, lately sent to Paris, has carried with  
him the necessary instructions; the result of  
which will be communicated to you, and by  
ascertaining the ulterior policy of the French  
government towards the U. States, will ena­  
ble you to adapt to it, that of the U. States  
  
towards France.  
Our other foreign relations remain without  
unfavorable changes. With Russia, they are  
on the best footing of friendship. The ports  
of Sweden have afforded proofs of friendly dis­  
position towards our cormflarce,in the coun­  
cils of that Nation also. And the information  
from our Special Minister to Denmark shews,  
that the mission had been attended with valu­  
able effects to our citizens, whose property  
had been so extensively violated &amp; endanger­  
ed, by cruisers under the Danish flag.  
Under the ominous indications which com­  
manded attention, it became a duty, to exert  
the means committed to the Executive De­  
partment, in providing for the general securi­  
ty. The works of defence on our maritime  
frontier have accordingly been prosecuted,  
with an activity leaving little to be added for  
the completion of the most important ones;  
and, as particularly suited for co-operation in  
emergencies, a poition of the Gun-boats have,  
in particular harbors, been ordered into use.  
The ships of war before in commission, with  
the addition of a frigate, have been chiefly  
employed, as a cruising guard to the rights  
of our coast. And such a disposition has  
been made of our land forces, as was thought  
to promise the services most appropriate and  
important. In this disposition is included,  
a force consisting of regluars and militia,  
embodied in the Indiana Territory, ami  
maivhcd towards our North-Western frontier.  
This measure was made requisite by several  
murders and depredations committed by In­  
dians ; but more especially by the menacing  
preparations and aspect of a combination of  
  
tncm, on tac wauasn uuuer me uiuucnce anu  
direction of a fanatic of the Shawanese Tribe.  
With these exceptions the Indian tribes retain  
their peaceable dispositions towards us, and  
their usual pursuits.  
I must now add, that the period is arrived,  
which claims froia the Legislative Guardians  
of the National rights a system of more am­  
ple provisions for maintaining them. Not­  
withstanding the scrupulous justice, the pro- i  
tractcd moderation, and the multiplied ef­  
forts on the part of the United States, to sub­  
stitute for the accumulating dangers to the  
peace of the two countries all the mutual ad­  
vantages of re-established friendship and con­  
fidence ; we have seen that the British Cabi­  
net perseveres, not only in withholding a re­  
medy for other wrongs, so long and so loudly  
| calling for it; hut in the execution, brought  
; home to the threshold of our Territory, of  
■ measures which, under existing circumstan­  
I ces, have the character, as well as the effect,  
1 of war on our lawful commerce.  
I With this evidence of hostile inflexibility,  
in trampling on rights which no Independant  
! Nation cun relinquish ; Congress will feel the  
duty of putting the United States into an ar­  
mor and an attiiude demanded by the crisis,  
and corresponding with the national spirit and  
| expectations.  
i 1 recommend, accordingly, that adequate  
provision be made for filling the ranks and  
prolonging the enlistments of the regular  
troops ; for an auxiliary force, to be engaged  
1 for a more limited term; for the acceptance  
of volunteer corps, whose patriotic ardor  
may court a participation in urgent services ;  
for detachments, as they may be wanted, ol  
other portions of the militia ; and for such a  
preparation of the great body, as will |propor­  
tion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacities.  
Nor can the occasion fail to remind you of the  
importance of those Military Seminaries,  
  
which, in every event, will form a valuable  
anti frugal part of our military establishment.  
The manufacture of cannon and small arms  
has proceeded with due success, and the stock  
and resources of all the necessaiy munitions  
are adequate to emergencies. It will not be  
inexpedient, however, for Congress to au­  
thorise an enlargement of them.  
Your attention wiU of course be drawn to  
such provisions, on the subject of our naval  
force, as may be required for the services to  
which it mr.y be best adapted. I submit to  
Congress, the scasonableness, also, of an au­  
thority to augment the stock of such materi­  
als, as are imperishable in their nature, or may  
not at once be attainable.  
In contemplating the scenes which distin­  
guish this momentous epoch, and estimating  
their claims to our attention, it is impossible  
to overlook those developing themselves, a­  
mong the great communities which occupy  
the southern portion of our own hemisphere,  
and extend into our neighbourhood. An en­  
larged philanthropy, and an enlightened fore­  
cast, concur in imposing on the National  
Councils an obligation to take a deep interest  
in their destinies ; to cherish reciprocal senti­  
ments of good will; to regard the progress of  
events ; and not to be unprepared for whate­  
ver order of things may be ultimately esta­  
blished.  
Under another aspect of our situation, the  
early attention of Congress will be due to the  
expediency of further guards against evasions  
and infraction s of our commercial laws. The  
practice of smuggling, which is odious every  
where, and particularly criminal in free go­  
vernments, where, the laws being made by all  
for the good of all, a fraud is committed on  
every individual as well as on the state, attains  
its utmost guilt, when it blends, with a pursuit  
of ignominious gain, a treacherous subservi­  
ency, in the transgressors, to a foreign policy,  
adverse to that of their own country. It is  
then that the virtuous indignation of the pub­  
lic should be enabled to manifest itself, thro’  
the regular animadversions of the most com­  
  
To secure greater respect to our mercan­  
tile flag, and to the honest interests which it  
covers; it is expedient also, that it be made  
punishable in our citizens, to accept licenses  
from foreign governments, for a trade unlaw­  
fully interdicted by them to other American  
citizens ; or to trade under false colors or pa­  
pers of any sort.  
A prohibition is equally called for against  
the acceptance, bv our citizens, of special li­  
censes to be used in a trade with the United  
States ; and against the admission into parti­  
cular ports of the United States, of vessels  
from foreign countries, authorized to trade  
with partiaular ports only.  
Altho* other subjects will press more im­  
mediately on your deliberations, a portion of  
them cannot but be well bestowed on the just  
and sound policy of securing to our manufac­  
tures the success they have attained, and are  
still attaining, in some degree, under the im­  
pulse of causes not permanent ; and to our  
navigation, the fair extent of which it is at  
present abridged by the unequal regulations  
of foreign governments.  
Besides the reasonableness of saving our  
manufacturers from sacrifices which a change  
of circumstances might bring on them, the  
national interest requires that, with respect  
to such articles at least, as belong to our de­  
fence, and our primary wants, we should not  
be left in unnecessary dependence on external  
supplies. And whilst foreign governments  
adhere to the existing discriminations in their  
ports against our navigation, and an equality  
or lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their na­  
vicrafinn. in mir nnrts. the effect cannot lie  
  
0 -• 1 #  
mistaken, because it has been seriously felt by  
our shipping interests, and in proportion as  
this takes place, the advantages of an indepen­  
dent conveyance of our products to foreign  
markets, and of a growing body of mariners,  
trained by their occupations for the service  
of their country in times of danger, must be  
diminished.  
The receipts into the treasury, during the  
year ending on the 3otli of September last,  
have exceeded thirteen millions and a half of  
dollars, and have enabled us to defray the cur­  
rent cxpences, including the interest on the  
public debt, and to reimburse more than five  
millions of dollars of the principal, without re­  
curring to the loan authorised by the act of the  
last session The temporary loan obtained in  
the latter end of the year one thousand eight  
hundred and ten, has also been reimbursed,  
and is not included in that amount. The de­  
crease of revenue arising from the situation  
of our commerce, and the extraordinary ex­  
pences which have and may become necessa­  
ry, must be taken into view, in making com­  
mensurate provisions for the ensuing year.—  
And I recommend to your consideration, the  
propriety of ensuring a sufficiency of annual  
revenue, at least to defray the ordinary ex­  
pences of government, and to pay the inte­  
rest on the public debt, including that on new  
loans which may be authorised.  
1 cannot close this communication without  
expressing my deep sense of the crisis in  
which you are assembled, my confidence in a  
wise and honorable result to your delibera­  
tions, and assurances of the faithful zeal with  
which my co-operating duties will be dis­  
charged ; invoking, at the same time the  
clessing of Heaven on our beloved country,  
and on all the means that may be employed,  
in vindicating its rights, and advancing its.  
its welware.

tb repeal of lb* British orders, that com­  
tnerce should be restored to a f.xiting that  
would admit the productions of manufac­  
tures of Great Britain, when owned by neu­  
trals, into markets iliut against them by her  
enemy ; the United rotates being given to un­  
derstand that, iu the meantime, a continu­  
ance of their non-irr.portation act would lead  
to measures of retaliation.  
  
sv. a taicr uuie, it uas inueea appeared,  
that a communication to the British govern­  
tnent, of fresh evidence of the repeal of the  
t rench decree* against our neutral trade,  
was followed by an intimation, that it had  
been transmitted to the British Plenipotenti­  
ary here ; in order that it might receive full  
consideration, in the depending discussions.  
This communication appears not to have  
been received: But the transmission of it  
hither, instead of founding on it an actual  
repeal of the orders, or assurances that the  
repeal would ensue, Would not j»er.nit us to  
rely on any effective change in the British  
iet. To be re«.dy to meet with cordiali­  
tisfactory proof* of such &amp; change, and  
to proceed in the mean tin e, in adapting our  
measures to the views which &#x27;nave been dis­  
closed through that minister, will best con­  
sult our wuoit duty.  
lu the unfriendly spirit cf those disclosures,  
indemnity and redress for other wrongs have  
continued to be withheld ; and our coasts and  
th-mouths of our harbors have again wit­  
nessed scene?, not less derogatory to the dear­  
est of our national rights, than vexatious to  
the regular course of our trade.  
Among the occurrences produced by the  
ccuduct of the British ships of war hovering  
on our coasts, was an encounter between cnc  
of them and the American frigate comman­  
ded by Captain Rodgers, rendered unavoid­  
able on the part of the latter, by a fire com­  
menced without cause by the former; whose  
commander is, therefore, alpne chargeable  
with the blocd unfortunately sh^d in main­  
taining the honor of the American flag. The  
proceedings of ?i court of enquiry requested  
by Capt. Kcdgcrs, are communicated; to­  
gether with the correspr ndcitce relating to  
the occurrence between the Secretary of  
State and His Britannic Majesty’s Euvoy.—  
To these m e added the sever*-.! conespon­  
dences which have passed on the subject of  
tho British Orders in Council; and to both  
the correspondence relating to the Floridas,  
in which Congress will be made acquainted  
with the interposition which the government  
of Great-Britain has thought proper to make  
against the proceedings of the U. States.  
The Justice and fairness which have l&gt;cei&gt; j  
evinced &gt; n the part of the United States to­  
ward* France. both before and since the re­  
  
vocation of hgr Decrees, authorised an ex­  
pectation that her government would have  
followed up that measure by all such othetn  
us were due to our reasonable claims, ai well  
ns dictated by its amicable professions. No  
proof, however, is yet given of andhtention to  
repair the other wrongs done to the United  
States; and particularly to restore the great  
ftraottnt of American property uiztil a&#x27;td  
condemned under edict*, which, though not  
affecting our neutral relations, and, then.f. re,  
not entering into questions between the U u- ,  
ted States and other Belligerent*, were ne­  
vertheless founded on such unjust principle*,  
that the reparation ought to hate JU.cn  
prompt and ample.  
In addition to this, and other demands «*t  
strict right, on that nation ; tl»e United Stages  
have much reason to bo dissatisfied with the  
rigorous and unexpected restrict! m*. to  
which their trade with the French domii i­  
on* Inis been subjected, and which, if r&#x27;t  
discontinued, will require at least corrt*­  
ponding restrictions on importations frim  
rrttr.ee into the U. States.  
On ah ’.hose subjects our Minister Plctu­  
pctert:ary, lately t&gt;en^ to Paris, has carr. -d  
with him the necessary instructions; the re­  
mit rf which till be communicated to y«’U,  
nud by ascertainii g the iilteri* r policy of the  
French government towards the U. State&#x27;s  
will enable you to adapt to it, that of the U.  
States towards France.  
Our other foreign relatiors remain with­  
out unfavorable dyanges. With Russia,thtfy  
are on the best footing; of friendship. Tl»«

guard to the rights &lt;*f our ccas&#x27;- And such a  
disposition has been made of our land forces,  
as&#x27;.vas thought to promise the services most  
appropriate and important. In this disposition  
is included, a force consisting of regulars arid  
militia, embodied in the Indiana 1’erritorv,  
and marched towards cur N&lt; rth Western  
frontier. 1 his measure was made requisite  
uy several murders and depredations com­  
by Indians; but more especially by

s retain their peaceable dis­  
us, and their usual pur­  
suits. 1  
I must now add, that the period it arrived,  
which claims fr&lt; in the Legislative Guurdi­  
uns of the National rights a system of more  
ample provisions for mnintainingthem. Not­  
withstanding the scrupulous justice, the pro­  
tracted moderation, and the multiplied ef­  
forts on the part of the United State, to sub­  
stitute f* r the accumulating dangers to the  
pence of the two countries all the mutual ad- ;  
vantages of re-established friendship and :  
confidence: we have seen that the British !

in trampling on rights which no independent  
nation can relinquish ; Congress will feel the  
dmy^^u‘t:ng tne United States into an ar- I

usefulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can  
the occasion fail to remind you of the impor­  
tance of those Military Seminaries, which, in  
every event, will form a valuable and frugal  
part of our military establishment.  
The manufacture of cannon &amp; small arms  
has proceeded with due success, and the  
sb-ck. and resources of all the necessary mu­  
nitions are adeepmte to emergencies, it will  
not be inexpedient, howevor, for Congress to  
authorise an enlargement of them.

which^f may be be^adapted. 1 submit to

Councils an obligation to take a deep interest  
in theirdestinies ; to cherish reciprocal senti­  
ments of good will; to regard the progress of  
events; and not to be unprepared for what­  
ever order of things may be ultimately estab­  
lished.  
Under another aspect, of our situation, the  
early attention of Congress will 1** due to the  
expediency&#x27; of further guards against evasions  
and infractions of our commercial laws. The  
j practice of smuggling, winch is odious every  
where and particularly criminal in free govern­  
! men&#x27;s, where the laws being made by all for the  
good of all, a fraud is committed on every indi­  
vidual as wdl as on the state, attains its utmost  
guilt, when it blends, w ith a pursuit of ignomi­  
nious gain, a treacherous subserviency, in the  
transgressors, to a foreign policy, adverse to  
that &lt;»f their own country. It is then that the  
  
vintuius in me jMimic snuum ur  
enabled to nun.ft st itself thro’ the regular ani­  
madversions of the most competent laws.  
To secure greater respect to our mercantile  
flag, and to the honest interests which it covers  
—it is expedient also, that it he made punisha­  
ble in our citizens, to accept licences front for­  
eign governments, for a trade unlaw fully inter­  
dicted by them to other American citizens ; or  
1 to trade tinder false colors ot pauert of any sort.  
A prohibition is equally called for agr.fnst the  
acceptance, bv our citizens, of special licences,

and agiiii st the admission into particular port-*

Fellow Citizens of the Senate t&gt;,

&#x27; To railing yon together sooner than a separation  
r-r Irons yohr homes would otherwise have hero requi­  
red j | yielded to considerations drawn from the pos­  
ture of our foreign affairs 1 and in fixing the pre  
sent, for the time of your meeting, regard was bad  
to the probability of further devtiopemenis of the  
policy Of&#x27;fhe belligerent powers towards this coun­  
tiy, w^ich might the more unite the national coun­  
. tils, in the hieasui.es to bfe pursued,  
v At the close of the last session of Congress, it  
■ was hoped that the successive confirmations of the  
extinction of the French decrees, so far as they  
violated our neutral commerce, would have induced  
thegovernnsenl of Great Britain to repeal its or­  
ders in council; and thereby authorised removal  
of. the existing obstructions, to her commerce with  
. the United States. K  
, &#x27; Instead of this reasonable step towards satisfar­  
-turn and friendship between the two nations, the  
»ordera were; at a moment when least to have been  
’ expected,&#x27; put into more rigorous execution ; aud  
’ it was communicated through the British Envoy,  
&#x27;jast arrived, that, whilst tbe revocation of the L.  
diets of France, as officially made‘known to the  
British government, was denied le have taken  
place ; it was an indispensable condition of tbe  
repeal of the British nrdeis, that commerce should  
be restored lo a footing, that would admit the pro­  
dOrtiooS&#x27;Und manufactures of Great Britain, when  
owned by neuters, into markets shut against them  
.- .’by bw enemy ; the United States being given to  
understand that, in the mean time, a continuance  
of their non-importation act would lead to mea­  
• suras of retaliation.  
( At a later date, it has indeed appeared, that a  
communication to the British government, of fresh  
evidence ol the repeal of the French decrees against  
our neutral trade, was followed by an intimation,  
that it had been transmitted to the British Pleni­  
potentiary here ; in order that it migiit receive full  
consideration in the depending discussions. This  
communication appears not to have been received :  
Bat the transaiissn%ofit hither, instead of found  
logon it an actual repeal of the oiders, or assu­  
rances that the repeal would ensue, will not permit  
ns to rely on any effective change in the British  
cabinet. Th be ready to meet with cordiality sa­  
tisfactory proofs of such a change, and to proceed,­  
in the mean time, in adapting our measures to the  
views which have been disclosed through that mi­  
nister, will best consult our whole duty.  
* t In tbe unfriendly spirit of those disclosures, jpd  
V demhity and redress mr otherwrongs have conti­  
nued to be withheld, and our coasts aud tbe mouths  
of ourharbdrs have again witnessed scenes, not less  
derogatory to the dearest of our national rights,  
tbad vexations to tbe regular c mise of our trade.  
Among the ecchrrenres produced by the conduct  
&gt;sf British ships of war hovering on our coasts,  
was an encounter between one of them, and the  
American frigate commanded by Captain Rodgers,  
rendered unavoidable on fbe part of the lattei, by  
X fire, commenced withou* cause, by the former,;  
whose commander is, .therefore, alone chargeable  
with the blood unfortunately abed in maintain­  
ing, the honor of the American Bag-—-The  
proceedings of a court of enquiry requested by  
Capt. Rodgers, are Communicated; together with  
the Correspondence relating to the occurrence be­  
tween the Secretary of Stale and his Britannic  
Majesty&#x27;s envoy. To these are added the several  
eorrespondqscrs which have passed on tbe subject  
of tfce British Orders in Council; and to both, tbe  
correspondence relating to the Florida#, iu which  
Congress will be&#x27;made acquainted with the interpo­

:sUc!i a disposition bas beenmkde of oar land turret,  
#s was thought to promise the servires most op.  
propriate and important. -Jo this disposition it in­  
cluded a (ore’s, consisting of ^regulars and militia,  
embodied in the Indians Territory, and marched  
towards our North Western frontier. This measure  
was made requisite by several&#x27; murders and depre­  
dations committed by Indians $ but more especial  
ly by the menacing preparations and aspect of a  
combination of them on the Wabash under the in­  
fluence and direction of a fanatic of the Shswancse  
tribe. With these exceptions the Indian tribes re­  
tain their peaceable dispositions towards os, and  
their usual pursuits.  
,, I roust now add, that the period is arrived, which  
claims from the Legislative Guardians of the Na­  
tional rights a system of more ample provisions for  
maintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupu­  
lous justice, the protracted moderation, and the  
multiplied efforts on the part of the United States,  
to substitute, for the &quot;accumulating &#x27;dangers to the  
peace of the two countries, all the mutual advanta­  
ges of re-established friendship and confidence; we  
have seen that the British Cabim-t perseveres, not on­  
ly in withholding a remedy for other wrongs, so long  
and so loudly calling for it ; but in the execution;  
brought home to the threshold of our Territory, of  
measures which, under existing circumstances,  
have the character, as well as the eflert, of war on  
  
Wnti tils evidence »f hostile inflexibility, jn  
trampling on right*-which no Independent Nation&#x27;  
can relinquish Congress will feel the duty of put­  
ting the United States into an armour, and a&#x27;n at­  
titude demanded hy the crisis, and corresponding  
with the national spirit and expectations.  
I recommend, accordingly, that adequate-previ­  
sion he made for tilling the ranks and prolonging  
the enlistments of the regular troops; for an aux­  
iliary force, to be engaged for a more limited term ;&#x27;  
for the acceptance of volunteer corps, whose patri­  
otic aidor may court 4 participation in urgent ser­  
vice* ; for detachments, as they may be wanted,  
of other portions of the Militia; and for such a pre­  
paration of the great .&#x27;body, as will proportion &#x27;its&#x27;  
usefulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the  
occasion fail to remind you of -the importance of  
those military Seminaries, which, in every event,  
will form a valuable and frugal part of our military  
establishment. . . ; ,,, &gt;r ;  
The manufacture of cannon and small arms bas  
proceeded with due success, and the slock and re­  
sources of ail the necessary, munitions are adequate  
to emergencies, it will nut be inexpedient, how­  
ever, for Congress to authorize an enlargement ol

Your attention will of course be drawn to auch  
provisions, on the subject of our oavai force,as rosy  
be required for the services to which it rit*y be best  
adapted. 1 submit to Congress the saasuitableness,  
also, of an authority to augment the slock of such  
materials, as are imperishable in their nature, or  
may not at once be attainable. *OV  
in contemplating the scenes which distinguish  
this momentous Epoch,and estimating their claims  
to our attention, it is impossible to overlook those  
developing themselves among the great communi­  
ties which occupy the southern portion of our own he­  
misphere, and extend into our neighbourhood. An  
enlarged philanthropy, and an enlightened forecast,  
concur in imposing on the National Couurils an ob­  
ligation to lake a deep interest in their destinies ;  
to cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will; to  
regard the progress of events ; and not to be unpre­  
pared for whatever order things may be ultimately  
established. .•it.,  
_. &lt; u__a -r_ *  
  
attention of Congress will be due to the expediency  
of further guards against evasions and infractions  
ofour commercial laws. The practice of smuggling,  
which is odious every where, and particularly cri­  
minal in free governments, where, the laws being  
made by ell for the good of all, a fraud is committ­  
ed o.* every individual aa well as on the stale, at*  
tains its utraostguilt.wben it blends, with a pursuit  
of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency, in  
the transgressors, to a foreign policy adverse to that  
of their own country. It is then that the virtuous  
indignation of the public should ba enabled to man­  
ifest itself, through the regular animadversions of  
the most competent laws.  
v To secure greater respect to nor mercantile flag,  
and to the honest-interests which it covers; it is  
expedient also, that it be made punishable in our ci­  
tizens, to accept licences from foreign governments,  
for a trade unlawfully interdicted by them to other  
Amer ican citizens; or to tragic uodtr false colors or  
papers of any sort. . -Mx*. &#x27;■ &#x27;A­  
: , A prohibition is equally called for, against&#x27; the ac­  
ceptance, by our ritiaens, of special licences, to lie  
used iob trade with the United States ; and against  
ihe adanssion into particular ports of the United  
States# m vessels from fmeigu^ountnel, authorised  
to trade with particular ports only.  
Although other (objects will press mure immedi­  
ately otryiiur deliberations a port mo of. them cannot  
but be weli bestowed, on the just and soundffcfliry  
.of securing to our tnanufactHrrs the success they

In calling you together sooner than a separation

Atthe close of the last session of Congress, it was  
hoped that the st:ceessive confirmations of the ex-  
tinction of the French decrees, so far as they v.ola-  
ted our neutral commerce, would have induced the

ders were, at a moment when least tohave been ex-  
pected, put into more rigorous execution; and it  
syas communicated through the British envoy just  
arrived, that, whilst the revocation of the edicts of  
France as officially made known to the British  
government, was denied to have taken place ; it  
Was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the  
British orders, that commerce should be restored  
to a footing, that would admit the productions and  
tnanufactures of Great Britain when owned by  
neutrals into market shut agamst them by her ene-  
my; the United States being given to understand  
that, in the mean time, a continuance of their non-  
importation act would lead to measures of retali-  
ation.  
  
At a later date it has indeed appeared, that a com-  
munication to the British government, of fresh evi-  
dence of the repeal of the French decrees against  
our neutral trade, was followed by an intimation,  
that it had been transmitted to the British Plenipo- |  
tentiary here; in order that it mightreceive full  
consideration in the depending discussions. This  
communication appears not to have been reccived :  
But the transmission of it hither, instead of found-  
ing on it anactual repeal of the orders, or assuran-&#x27;  
ces that the repeal would ensue, will not permit us  
to rely on any effective change in the British cabi-  
net. To be ready to meet with cordiality satisfac-  
tory proofs of such a change, and to proceed, in the  
meantime, in adapting our measures to the views  
which have been disclosed through that minister,  
will best consult our whole duty.  
  
in the unfriendly spirit of these disclosures, in-  
demnity and address for other wrongs have conti-  
nued to be withheld, and eur coasts and the mouths  
of our harbors have again witnessed scenes, not  
jess derogatory to the dearest of our national rights,  
than vexatious to the regular course of our trade.  
  
Among the occurrences produced by the cenduct&#x27;  
of British ships of war hovering on our coasts, was  
an encounter between one of them and the Ameri-  
can frigate commanded by captain Rodgers, ren-  
dered unavoidable on the part of the latter, by a fire,  
commenced without cause by the former; whose  
commander is, therefore, alone chargeable with the  
blood unfortunately shed in maintaining the honor  
of the American flag. The proceedings of a court of  
enquiry, requested by captain Rodgers, are com-  
municated—together with the correspondence rela-  
ting to the occurrence, betwecn the secretary of  
state and his Britanic majesty’s envoy. To these  
are added the several correspondences which have  
passed on the subject of the British orders in coun-  
ei]—and to both the correspondences relating to the  
Ftoridas, in which congress will be made acquaint-  
ed with the interposition which the government of  
Great Britain has thought proper to make against  
the proceedings of the United States.  
  
In addition to this and other demands of strict  
right, on that nation, the United States have much  
reason to be dissatisfied with the mgorous and un-  
expected restrictions, to which their trade with the  
French dominions has been subjected ; and which,  
if not discontinued, will require at least correspon-  
ding restrictions on importations from France into  
the United States.  
  
On all those subjects our minister plenipotentiary,  
lately sent to Paris, has carried with him the neces-  
sary instructions—the result of which will be com;  
municated to you, and by ascertaiming the ulterior  
policy ot the French government towards the Uni-  
ted States, will enable you to adapt to it that of  
the United States, towards France.  
  
Our other foreign relations remain without unfa-  
vourable changes. With Russia they are on the  
best footing of friendship. The ports of Sweden  
have afforded proofs of friendly dispositions towards  
our commerce, in the councils of that nation also,  
And the information from our special minister in  
Denmark, shews that the mission had been attended  
with valuable effects to our citizens, whose proper-  
ty had been so extensively violated andendangered  
by cruizers under the Danish flag.  
  
Under the ominous indications which commanded  
attention, it became a duty to exert the means com  
mitted to the executive department, in providing for  
the general security. The works of defence on our  
maratime frontier have accordingly been prosecuted  
with an activity leaving little to be added for the  
completion of the most important ones ; and as par-  
ticularly suited for co-operation in emergencies, 2  
portion of the gunboats have in particular harbors,  
been ordered into use. The ships of war before in  
commission, with the addition of a frigate, have  
\been chiefly employed as a cruising guard to the  
rights of our coast. And such a disposition has  
been made of our land forces as was thought to pro-  
  
|mise the services most appropriate and important.  
{In this disposition is included a force consisting of  
  
regulars and militia, embodied in the Indian territog  
ry, and marched towards our yorth western frontier.  
  
This measure was made requisite by several mur:  
  
ders and depredations committed by the Indians &lt;  
but more especially by the menacing preparations  
and aspect of acombination of them on the Wabash  
under the influence and direction ofa fanatic of the  
Shawanese tribe With these exceptions the Indian  
tribes retain their peaceable dispositions towards  
us, and their usual pursuits.  
  
I must now add, that the period is arrived, which  
claims from the legislative guardians of the national  
rights a system of more ample provision for mair-  
taining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous  
justice, the protracted modcration, and the multipli-  
ed efforts on the part of the United States to substi-  
tute for the accumulating dangers to the peace of the  
two countries; all the mutual advantages of re

be made for filling the ranks and prolonging the  
enlistments of the regular troops ; for an auxiliary  
force to be engaged for a more limited term ; for the  
acceptance Of volunteer corps, whose patriotic  
ardour may court a participation in urgent services  
fcr detachments, as they may be wanted, of other  
portions of the militia; and for sich a preparation  
of the great body, as will proportion its usefulness  
to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the occasion  
fail to remind you of the importance of those mil-  
tary seminaries, which, in every event, will form a  
®aiuable and frugal part of our military establish-  
ment.  
  
The manufacture of cannon and sma!larms has  
proceeded with due success, and the stock and  
resources of all the necessary munitions are ade-  
quate to emergencies. It will not be mexpedient,  
however, for congress to authorise an cnlargement  
of them. |  
  
Your attention will of course be drawn to such  
provisions on the subject of our naval*force, as  
may be required for the service to which it may be  
best adapied. I submit to congress the seasonable-  
ness, also, of an authority to augment the stock of  
such materials, as are imperishable in their nature,  
or may not at once be attainable.  
  
In contemplating the scenes Which distinguish  
this momentous epoch, and estimating their claims  
to our attention, it is impossible to overlook those  
developing themselves among the great communi-  
ties which occupy the southern portion of our  
own hemisphere, and extend into our neighborhood.  
An enlarsed philanthropy, and an enlightened fore-  
cast, concur, in imposing on the national councils  
an obligation to take a deep interest in their desti-  
ries ; to cherish reciprocal sentiments of good wiil ;  
to regard the progress of events ; and not to be  
unprepared for whatever order of things may be  
ultimately established. &#x27;  
  
Under another aspect of our situation, the early  
attention of congress will be duc to the expediency  
of further guards against evasions and infractions of  
our commercial laws. The practice of smuggling,  
which is odious every where, and particularly cri-  
minal in free governments, where. the laws being  
made by all for the good of all, a fraud is committed  
on every individual as well as on the siate, attains  
its utmost guilt, when it blends, with a pursuit of  
ignominious gain, 2 treacherous subserviency, in  
the transgressors, to a foreign policy adverse to that  
of their own country. It is then that the virtuous  
indignations of the publick shou!d be enabled to ma-  
nifest itself, through the regular animadversions of  
the most competent laws.  
  
To secure greater respect to our mercantile flag,  
and to the honest interest which it covers ; it 1s  
expedient also, that it be made punishable in our  
citizens, to accept licences from foreign govern-  
mcnts fora trade unlawfully interdicted by tiem to  
other American citizens ; or to trade under false  
colors or papers of any sort.  
  
A prohibition is equally called for against the ac-  
ceptance, by our citizens, of special licences, to  
be used in a trade with the United States; and  
against the admission into particular ports of the  
United States, of vessels from foreign countries;  
authorised to trade with particular ports only.  
  
_Althotgh other subjects will press more imme-  
diately on your deliberations, a portion of them  
cannot but be well bestowed, on the just and sound  
policy of securing to our manufactures the suc-  
cess they have obtained, and are still attaining in  
‘Some degree, under the impulse of causes not per-  
  
which it is at present abiridged by the unequal regu-

stances might bring on them, the natidnal interest  
requires that, as respects such articelés at lcast, as  
belong to our defence, and our primary wants, we  
should not be jeft in unnecessary dependence on  
external supplics. And whilst foreign governments  
adhere to the existing discriminations in their ports  
against our navigations, and an equality or lesser dis+  
  
  
  
cr.mination is enjoyed by their nayiyation, in our  
ports, the effect cannct be mistaken, because it hag  
been seriously felt by our shipping interest ; and in  
propertion as this take place, the advantages cf an  
independent conveyance of our products to foreign  
markets and of a growing body of marincrs, trained.  
by their occupations for the service of their country  
in times of danger must be diminished.  
  
The recipts into the treasury, during the year  
ending on the thirtieth of September last, have ex:  
ceeded thirteen millions and a half of dollars, and  
have enabled us to defray the current expences,  
including the interest on the public debt, and to  
reimburse more than five millions of dollars of the  
principle, without recurring to the loan authorized  
by the act of last session. The temporary loan  
obtained in the latter end of the year 1810, has also  
been reimbursed, and is not included inthat amount.  
  
The decrease of revenue, arising from the situa-  
tion of our commerce and the extraordinary expen-  
ses which have and may become necessary, must  
be taken into view in making commensurate proy’-  
sions for the ensuing year. And I recommend to  
your consideration the propriety of ensuring a suf-  
ficiency of annual revenue, at least to defray the  
ordinary expences of government, and to pay the  
interest on the public debt, including that on new  
loans which may be authorised.  
  
I cannot close this communication without ex-  
pressing my decp sense of the crisis in which you  
are assembled ; my confidence in a wise and hono-  
rable result of your deliberations, and assurances of  
the faithful zeal with which my co-operating duties  
will be discharged ; invoking, at the same time, the  
blessings of Heaven on our beloved country, and  
on all means that may be cmployed, in Vindicatings  
its rights and advancing its welfare.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
Fellow citizens of the Senate and  
of the House of Representatives,  
  
In calling you together sooner than a separation  
from your homes would otherwise have been re-  
quired, I yield to considerations drawn from the  
posture of ovr foreign affairs; and in fixing the pre-  
sent for the time of your meeting, regard was had  
  
to the probability of further developements of the |  
  
policy of the belligerent powers towards this coun-  
try, which might the more unite the national coun-  
cils in the measures to be pursued.  
  
At the close of the late cession of congress, it  
was hoped that the successive confirmations of the  
extinction of the French decrees, so far as they  
violated our neutral commeice, would have in-  
  
duced the government of great Britain to repeal |  
  
its orders in council, and thereby authorise a remo-  
  
val of the existing obstructions to her commerce |  
  
with the United States.  
Instead of this reasonable step towards satisfac-  
  
tion and friendship between the two nations, the |  
  
orders were, at a moment when least to have been  
expected, put into more rigorous execution; and it  
  
was communicated through the British envoy just :  
arrived, that, whilst the revocation of the edicts of |  
France, as officially made known to the British gov- |  
ernment, was denied to have taken place, it was —  
  
an indispensable condition of the repeal of the Bri-  
tish orders, that commerce should be restored to  
  
a footing, that would admit the productions and |  
  
manufactures of Great Britain, when owned by  
neutrals, into markets shut against them by her  
  
enemy; the United States being given to understand |  
  
that, in the mean time, a continuance of their non-  
importation act would lead to measures of retalia-  
tion.  
  
Ata later date, it has indeed appeared, thata com- |  
  
Munication to the British government, of fresh evi-  
dence of the repeal of the French decrees against  
our neutral trade, was followed by an intimation, that  
it had been transmitted to the British plenipotentiary  
here, in order that it-might receive full considera-  
tion in the depending discussions. This communi-  
cation appears not to have been received: but the  
transmission of it hither, instead of founding on  
it an actual repeal of the orders, or assurances that  
  
a .  
  
mi ° mer  
  
the repeal would ensue, will not permit us to rely  
on any éffective change in the British cabinet.  
To be ready to meet with cordiality satifactory  
proofs of such a change, and to proceed, in the  
mean time, in adapting our measures to the views  
which have been disclosed through that minister,  
will best consult our whole duty.  
  
In the unfriendly spirit 6f those disclosures, in-  
demnity and redress for other wrongs have con-  
tinued to be withheld, and our coasts and the  
mouths of our harbours have again witnessed  
  
national rights, than vexatious to the regular course  
of our trade.  
  
Among the occurrences produced by the con  
duct of British ships of war hovering on our coasts,  
was an encounter between one of them and the  
American frigate commanded by captain Rogers,  
rendered unavoidable on the part of the latter, by  
a fire, commenced without cause, by the former;  
whose commander is, therefore, alone chargeable  
with the blood unfortunately shed in maintaining  
the honour of the American flag. The proceedings  
of a court of inquiry, requested by © captain  
Rogers, are communicated, together with the cor-  
respondence relating to the occurrence, between  
the secretary of state and his Britannic majesty’s  
envoy. To these are added, the several correspon-  
  
  
  
dences which have passed on the subject of the  
British orders in council; and to both, the corres-  
pondence relating to the Floridas, in which con-  
gress will be made acquainted with the interposi-  
tion which the government of Great Britain has  
thought proper to make against the proceedings of  
the United States.  
  
The justice and fairness which have been evinced  
on the part of the United States towards France,  
both before and since the revocation of her decrees,  
authorised an expectation that her government  
would have followed up that measure by all such  
| others as were due to ourreasonable claims, as  
well as dictated by its amicable professions. No  
  
  
  
  
  
|, proof, however, is yet given of an intention to re-  
| pair the other wrongs done to the United States;  
  
American property seized and condemned under  
edicts, which, though not affecting our neutral re-  
lations, and, therefore, not entering into questions  
| between the United States and other belligerents,  
were nevertheless founded in such unjust principles,  
that the reparation ought to have been prompt and  
} ample.  
| In addition to this, and other demands of strict  
| right, on that nation, the United States have much  
reason to be dissatisfied with the regorous and un-  
| expected restrictions to which their trade with  
the French dominions has been subjected; and  
which, if not discontinued, will require at least  
| corresponding restrictions on importations from  
| France into the United States.  
| On all those subjects our minister plenipotentia-  
| ry, lately sent to Paris, has carried with him the  
| Necessary instructions; the result of which will be  
, communicated to you, and by ascertaining the  
‘ulterior policy of the French government towards  
the United States, will enable you to adapt to it  
that of the United States towards France  
Our other foreign relations remain without un-  
  
favourable changes. With Russia; they are on the  
best footing of friendship! Te poris of Sweden  
have: offered proois of friendly disposition towards  
our commerce, iv the councils of that nation also.

al rights a system of more ample provisions for  
maintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous  
justice, the protracted moderation, and the multi-  
plied efforts on the part of the United States, to  
substitute, for the accumulating dangers to the  
peace of the two countries, all the mutual advanta-  
ges of re-established friendship and confidence; we  
have seen that the British cabinet perseveres, not  
only in withholding a remedy for other wrongs so  
long and so loudly calling for it; but in the execu&lt;  
tion, brought home to the threshold of our territo-  
ry, of measures which, under existing circumstan-  
ces, have the character, as well as the effect, of  
war on our lawful commerce.  
  
With this evidence of hostile inflexibility, in  
trampling on rights which no independent nation  
| can relinquish; congress will feel the duty of put-  
ting the United States into an armour, and an atti-  
tude demanded by the crisis, and corresponding  
with the national spirit and expectations!  
  
YT recommend accordingly, that adequate pro-  
vision be made for filling the rahks and prolonging  
the enlistments of the regular troops: for an auxilia-  
ry force, to be engaged for a more limited term;  
for the acceptance of volunteer corps, whose patvi-  
otic ardour may court a participation in urgent ser-  
vices; for detachments, as they may be wanted, of  
other portions of the militia; and for such a prepa-  
ration of the great body, as will proportion its uses  
fulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the oc-  
casion fail to remind you of the importance of those  
military seminaries, which, in every event, will  
form a valuable and frugal part of our military es.  
tablishment.

proceeded with due success, and the stock and re.  
sources of all the necessary munitions are adequate

er, for congress to authorize an enlargement of  
them.  
  
Your attention will of course be drawn to such  
provisions, on the subject of our naval force, as  
may be required for the services to which it may  
be best adapted. I submit to congress the season-  
ableness, also, of an authority to augment the stock  
of such materials, as are imperishable in their na-  
ture, or may not at once be attainable.  
  
In contemplating the scenes which distinguish  
this momentous epoch, and estimating their claims  
to our attention, it is impossible to overlook those  
developing themselves among the great communi-  
ties which occupy the southern portion of our own  
hemisphere, and extend into our neighbourhood, An  
enlarged philanthrophy, and an enlightened forecast  
concur in imposing on the national councils an ob-  
ligation to take a deep interest in their destinies; to  
cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will; to regard  
the progress of events; and not to be unprepared  
for whatever order of things may be ultimately es-  
tablished. &amp;  
  
Under another aspect of our situation, the early  
attention of congress will be due to the expediency  
of further guards against evasions and infractions  
  
&quot; of our commercial laws. The practice of smuggling,  
  
which is odious every where, and particularly crimi-  
nal in free governments, where the laws being made  
by all for the good of all, a fraud is committed on  
every individual as well as on the state, attains its  
  
° e ° ° ° |  
utmost guilt, when it blends, with a pursuit of ig-|  
nominious gain a treacherous subserviency, in the |  
  
transgressors, to a foreign policy adverse to that of |  
  
their own country. It is then that the virtuous in-  
dignation of the public should be enabled to mani-  
fest itself, through the regular animadversions of  
  
_the most competent laws.  
  
To secure greater respect to our mercantile flag,  
and to the honest interests which it covers, it is ex-  
  
pedient also, that it may be punishable in our citi- |  
  
zens, to accept licences from foreign governments,  
  
&quot; for a trade unlawfully interdicted by them to other  
  
American citizens; or to trade under false colours or  
papers of any sort.  
A prohibition is equally c: alled for, against the  
  
acceptance, by our citizens, of special licences, “to |  
  
  
  
be used in a’ trade with the United Siates; and |  
  
ngainst the admission into particular ports of the |  
|  
United States, of vessels from foreign countries,  
  
authorized to trade with particular ports only.  
  
Although other subjects will press more immedi-  
ately on your deliberations, a portion of them cannot  
but be well bestowed, on the just and sound policy  
of securing to our manufactures the success they  
have attained, and are still attaining in some degree ,  
under the impulse of causes not permanent; and  
to our navigation, the fair extent, of which it is at  
present abridged by the unequal regulations of fo-  
reign governments.  
  
Besides the reasonableness of saving our manu-  
facturers from sacrifices which a change of circum-  
stances might bring on them, the national interest  
requires, that, with respect to such articles at least  
as belong to our defence, and our primary wants,  
we should not be left in winecessary dependance  
on external supplies. And whilst foreign govern-  
ments adhere to the existing discriminations in their  
ports against our navigation, and an equality or les-  
ser discrimination is enjoyed by their navigation, in  
our ports, the effect cannot be mistaken, because it  
has been seriously felt by our shipping, interests;  
andin proportion as this takes place, the advanta-  
  
|  
  
ges of an Jedeosaien? conveyance of our F osaiieaia  
to foreign markets, and of a growing body of ma-  
riners, trained by their occupations for the service  
of their country in times of danger, must be dimin-  
ished,  
  
The receipts into the treasury, during the year  
ending on the thirtieth of September last, have ex-  
ceeded thirteen millions and a half of dollars, and  
have enabled us to defray the current expenses, in-  
cluding the interest on the public debt, and to re-  
imburse more than five millions of dollars of the  
principal, without recurring to the loan authorised  
by the act of the last session The temporary loan  
  
| obtained in the latter end of the year one thousand  
  
eight hundred:and ten, has also been reimbursed,  
and is not included in that amount.  
  
The decrease of revenue, arising from the situa-  
tion of our commerce and the extraordinary ex-  
penses which have and may become necessary,  
must be taken into view, in making commensurate  
provisions for the ensuring year. And I recom-  
mend to your consideration the propriety of en-  
suring a sufficiency of annual revenue, at least to  
defray the ordinary expenses of government, and  
to pay the interest on. the public debt, including  
that on new loans which may be authorised.  
  
I cannot close this communication without ex-  
pressing my deep sense of the crisis in which  
  
| vou are assembled, my confidence ina wise and  
  
honourable result to your deliberations, and as-  
surances of the faithful zeal with which my co-  
operating duties will be discharged; mvoking, at  
the same time, the blessing of Heaven on our  
beloved country, and on ali means that may be  
employed, in vindicating its rights and advancing  
its welfare.

Fellow Citizens-of the Senité, and of the  
House of Reprefentives,  
I;N calling you together sooner than  
i a separation from your homes  
“wourd otherwise have been required,  
I yiclded t 6 considerations Jrawn  
from the posture of car foreign af­  
fairs ; and in sizing the present for  
the time of your meeting, regard was  
had to the probability of further de­  
velopments of tise policy of the bel%..  
gerent powers towdrds this country,  
which might ths mare unite the na­  
tional councils in the measures to be  
puriued, ’ ,  
At the close of the 1a&amp; fiflion of  
Congress, it was hoped that the fue­  
ceflive confirmation of the extindion  
a 2 the French decrees, 10 fat as they  
violated oar neatral com merce,would  
have induced the goveramenat of  
Great Britain to repeal its orders in  
council ; and thereby authorife a re­  
moval of tae exiftiig obftru&amp;tions 1o  
her commerce with the United States.  
Instead of this reasonable step to­  
wards fatisfation 4nd friendfhip be­  
tween the two natiops, the orders  
were at a. moment when least to have  
been expccled, pat into more rigor­  
ous, execution : and it was comfthuni­  
cated through the British Lanvoy jalt  
-arrived, that, whilst the revocation of  
the Edi&amp;s of Fratce, as efficially  
made known to the Britith govern­  
ment,was denied to have taken places  
it was an indifpenfible condition of  
the repeal of -the British, ordersy that  
commerce should be restored to a  
footing that would admit the produc  
tions and manufaltures of Great  
Britain, when owned by neutrals, ia.  
to markets shit against themp by bher  
enemy ; the United Statzs being giv­  
en to undgrfiend that in the mean  
time; 4 continuaneé of their ‘non im­  
portation act would lead to mealures  
of retaliation. ~  
‘At a latter date, it has indeed ap.  
peared, that a éomuinuanication to the  
Britilh Government, of frcth eviden­  
cgs of therepeéal of the French .de­  
crees against our neutral trade, was  
followed by an intimation, that it had  
been trunf{mitted to the Britilh Pleni­  
potentiary here; in otrder that it  
might receive full consideration in the  
‘wepending difcullions. ‘This commu,  
pication appears not to have been re­  
ceived: But the tranfmiflion of it  
hither, intead of founding en it an  
aétual rep®al of the orders, or aflu­  
rances that thé-repeal wounld ensue,  
will not permit héto rely on any ef­  
fc&amp;tive change in the Britith Cabiuet.  
T&#x27;o be ready to meet with cordiality  
{atisla&amp;ory proofs es fuch*a_change,  
&amp; to proceed in the mean tigiein aap­  
tiag our&#x27;meafures to the views which  
have been diiclosed through that Hin­  
ilter,will beflt consult oar. whole duty.  
1o the unfriendly fpiiit of those dis­  
closures, indemnity and sedrefs for  
other wrongs have continued to be  
withheld, and our coafls and the  
thouths of our harbors have again  
witnelled scenes, not lels derogatory  
to the dearell of our mational -rights,  
than vexatious to the tegular course  
of our trade, &#x27;  
- Among the 6ccurrences produced  
By the condud of British (hips of war  
hovering on our coasts, was an en:  
counter between one of them and the  
American frigaté commanded .by  
Capt. Rogers, rendered unavoidabie  
on the part of the latier, by a fire  
commenced withotit cause from the  
former; whose commander is there­  
fore, alone chargeable with the blood  
unfortunately shed in mainjaining the  
honor of the Amecrican flag. The  
proceedings’ of the court of inquiry,  
requested by Capt. Rogers, are com- .  
municated ; together with the corres­  
pondence relating to the occurrence,  
batween the Secretary of State and  
His Britannic Majefly’s Envoy. To  
thefz are added, the several corref- .  
pondences wh’i;;v__hhave.%ifcd on the  
{ubjeét of the Britith Orflers in Coun­

In addition to this, and other de­  
mands of firict right, on that nation,&quot;  
the U. States have much reason to bs.  
diffatisfied with the rigorous and un­  
expetted refirictions; t 6 which their

been fubjedted ¢ and which, if not dis- 1  
continued, will require at lealt corref.  
ponding reftri®ions on&#x27; iraportatioas  
from France into the United State_s. 1  
On all ofe fubje@s our Minister  
Plenipotentiary, lately sent to Paris, |  
has carried with him the neceflary in-  
Rru&amp;tions ; the refule of which will be  
commuaicated to you, and by afcer.  
taining the ulterior policy of the  
French government towards the U.  
States, will efable you to acapt to it  
that of the United States towards  
France. T ad) ot il  
Our other foreign relations remain  
without unfavorabie changes. With  
Rulffia they are on the best footing of  
friendfhip. The ports of Sweden .  
havs afforded proofs of friendly dis­  
positions towards our. commerce, in  
the councils of that nation aifo.. And  
the information from our Special Min.  
ifter to Denmark, shews that the mis­  
sion had: been attended with yalu­  
~able eff:&amp;s to our citizens, whose ptb. |  
perty had been so extenfively.vivlated |  
~and endangeted by cruiiers ugder the |  
Danith flag. ißy ’  
. Under the omioous indications  
which commanded artestion, it be- .  
came a duty, to €xert the means cotm­  
mitted to the Lxecutive Department,  
in providing for the general security.  
The works of defence on our mari. |  
time froatier have accordingly been 2  
profecu%d, with an attivity. leaving  
little to be ddded for the completion of  
the mo_ﬁ/fmpdrt.ant ones ;. and as par-,  
ticuletly suited for ed-operatiop in  
%@étgencies, a portion of the Gun. g  
- Doats have, in particular barbors,been  
-ordered into use. The ships of war  
betcre in commiflion, with the addi­  
“tion of a frigate, have been chiefly  
employed, as a eraifing puard to the  
rights of our coalt. And iuzh a dif­  
pefition has been made of our land  
farces, as was thought to promifs the  
services molt ‘appropriate and impor­  
tant. In this difpolition 15 inclided  
a for .. consisting of regulars =nd mi,  
litia, embédied in the Indiana Territo- -  
ily, and marched towards our North  
. Weltern frontier. This meafiire was  
made requisite by several murdersand  
depre futions committed by Indians j  
but morg efpetially by the michacing  
sprepdrations and alpe&amp;t of acombina- i  
tion of them on the Wabash, under the |  
influerice and dire&amp;ion of a fanatic of l  
the Shawanefe tribe. With these ex-. !  
ceptions, the Indian tribes retain thiir  
ptaceable difpolitions rowards us, and i  
their ulval purfvits. &#x27; 4  
I must pow add, that the period is |  
arrived, which claims from the Legifs  
lativeGuardians of the National rights i  
4 fyßkem of more ample provisions for |  
maintaining them, Nm(wj,thﬂa&#x27;nding §

Jaoderation, and the muliiplied efforts

gers.to the peace of the two coan- |  
tries, all the mutnal advantzges of re.  
eftablitheq friendfhip and ¢onfidence.; .  
we have seen that the British Cabinet  
perseveres not only in withholding a  
‘remedy for other wrongs, {o ldpg and.  
so loudly calling for it but in the  
execution, brought homie to the thresh­  
old of our Territory, of measures  
which, under - exilting circuniftances,  
have the cliaraéter, as well as the ef­  
fe&amp;t, of war on our l;ivﬁiii;pm&amp;gercg, :  
. With this evidence of hofiile inflex­  
ibilityin trampling on rights which  
no independent nation cau relinquilh ;.  
Congress will feel the duty of putting  
the United States into an armot, and  
an attitude demanded by the crisis,  
and corresponding with the national  
spirit and expe@ations. . &amp;  
- I recommend zccordingly, thar ad­  
cguate provision be made for filling -  
the ‘ranks and prolonging the eulift­  
ments of -the regular troops ; for an  
=uxitiary _force, to-.be engaged for a.  
more limited term; . for the accep­  
tance of volunieer corps, whose patri­  
otic ardor may court a patticipation -  
in tirgent services ; for detachments,  
as they may be wanted, of other por-.  
‘tiops of the militia ; and for —fuch.a :

Under anothier afpe® of otr situation,

Pellow-citizens of the Senate and of  
  
the House of Kefiresentatives,  
  
In calling you together sooner than a separation  
from your homes would otherwise have been re-  
quired, I yielded to considerations drawn from  
the posture of our foreign affairs; and in fixing  
the present, for the time of your meeting, regard  
was had to the probability of further develope-  
ments of the policy of the belligerent powers to-  
wards this couniry, which might the more unite  
the national councils, in the measures to be pur-  
sued.  
  
At the close of the last session of Congress, it  
  
was hoped that the successive confirmations of  
  
the extinction of the French decrees, so far as  
they violated our neutral commerce, would have  
induced the government of Great-Britain to re-  
Peal WE Srders in cuwneil : and thereby authorize  
a removal of the existing obstructions to her com-  
inerce with the United States.  
  
Instead of this reasonable step towards satisfac-  
tion and friendship between the two nations, the  
orders were, ata moment when ieast to have  
been expected, put Into more rigorous execution ;  
and it was communicated through the British en-  
yoy just arvived, that, whilst the revocation of the  
edicts of rance, as officially made known to the  
Erttish eovernment, was dented to have taken  
piace ; it was an indispensible condition of the  
British orders, that commerce should be restored  
to a footing, that would adintt the productions and  
manufactures of Great Britain, when owned by  
neutrals, into markets shut against them by her  
enemv; the United Stetes being given to under-  
stand that. in the mean time, a continuance of  
their non-importation act would lead to measures  
of retaliation.  
  
Ata later date, it has indeed appeared, that a  
communication to the Briush government, of  
fresh evidence of the repeal of the French de-  
crees against our nevtral irade, was followed by  
an iadmation, that it had been transmitted to the  
British plenipotentiary here ; in order that il  
micht receive full consideration in the depending  
discussions. This communication appears not to  
have been ceceived: But the transmission of it  
hither, insiead of founding on it an actual repeal  
of the orders, or assurances that the repeal would  
ensue, will not permit us to rely on any effective  
change in the British cabinet. To be ready to  
  
  
  
| meet with cordiality satisfacto?¥ proofs ‘of such a  
change, and to proceed, in the mean time, in a-  
| dapting our measures to the views which have  
, been disclosed through that minister, will best  
consult our whole duty.  
  
_ Inthe unfriendly spirit of those disclosures,  
indemnity and redress for other wrongs have  
continued to be withheld, and our coasts and the  
mouths of our harbours have again witnessed  
scenes, not less derogatory to the dearest of our  
national rights, than vexatious to the regular  
course of our trade.  
  
Among the occurrences produced by the con-  
duct of British ships of war hovering on our coasts,  
was an encounter between one of them and the  
American frigate commanded by capt. Rodgers,  
rendered unavoidable on the part of the latter, by  
a fire commenced without cause by the former ;  
whose commander is therefore alone chargeable  
with the blood unfortunately shed in maintaining  
the honor of the American flag. The proceed-  
ings of a court of enquiry, reqyested by captain  
Rodgers, are communicated ; together with the  
correspondence relating to the occurrence, be-  
tween the secretary of state and his Britannic  
majesty’s envoy. ‘lo these are added the seve-  
ral correspondences which have passed on the  
subject of the British orders in council ; and  
io both, the correspondence reiating to the Flort-  
das, in which congress will be made acquainted  
with the interposition which the government of  
i Great-Britain has thought proper to make against  
; the proceedings of the U. States.  
  
‘The justice and {cirness which have been evinc-  
ed on the part oi the United States towards France  
both before and since the revocation of her de-  
crees, authorised an expectation that her govern-  
ment would have followed up that measure by all  
such others as were due to our reasonable claims,  
as well as dictated by its amicable professions.  
No proof, however, is yet given of an intention to  
repair the other wrongs done to the U. States ; and  
particulaly to restore the great amount of Amer-  
ican property seized and condemned under edicts,  
which, though not affecting our neutral relations,  
and, therefore, not entering into questions between  
the United States and other belligerents, were  
nevertheless founded on such unjust principles,  
that the reparation ought to have been prompt and  
ample.  
  
In addition to this, and other demands of strict  
right on that nation. the United States have much  
reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and un-  
expected restrictions, ta which their trade with  
the French dominions has beeo subjected: and  
which if not discontinued, will require at least  
corresponding restriciigns On importations from  
France into the U. States. &lt;4  
  
On all these subjects our minister  
tiary, lately sent to Paris, has carried

h him

‘ No. 46.  
the necessary instrugtionas.the result of which  
will be communicated to you, and by ascertaining  
the ulterior policy of the French government to-  
wards the U.S. will enable you.to adapt to it that  
of the U. S. towards France.  
  
Our other foreign relations remain withodeun-  
favorable changes. With Russia they are on the  
best footing of friendship. The ports of Sweden  
have afforded proofs of friendly dispositions to-  
wards our commerce, in the coun of that na-  
tion also. And the information from our special  
minister to Denmark, shews that the mission had  
been attended with valuable effects to ouF citizens,  
whose property had been so extensively violated  
and endangered by cruisers under the Danish flag.  
  
Under the ominous indications which comman-  
ded atrention, it became a duty to exert the means  
committed to the executive department, in pro-  
viding for the general security. The works of  
defence on our maritime frontier have according-  
ly been prosecuted, with an aetivity leaving lit-  
tle to be added for the completion of the most im-  
portant ones; and,as particularly suited forco-op-  
eration in emergencies,a portion of the gun-boats  
have, in particula® harbors, been ordered int ‘  
The ships of war before in commission, with thead-  
dition of a frizatephave been chiefly employed as  
a cruising guard to the rights of our coast. And  
such a disposition has been made of om land for-  
ces as was thought to promise the services most  
appropriate and important. In this disposition  
is included a force, consistinggof regulars and  
militia, embodied in the In ‘territory, and  
marched towards our northwestern frontier.—  
This measure was made requisite by several mur  
ders and depredations committed by Indiuns ;  
but more especially by the menacing preparations  
and aspect of a combination of them on the Wa-  
bash under the influence and direction of a fa-  
natic of the Shawanese tribe. With these ex-  
ceptions, the Indian tribes retain their peacea-  
ble dispositions towards, us and their usual puré  
suits.  
  
I must now add, that the period is arrived  
which claims from the legislative guardians cf  
the national rights a system of more ample pro-  
visions for maintaining them. Notwithstanding  
the scrupulous justice, the protracted modera-  
tion, and the multiplied efforts on the part of the  
United States, to substitute, for the accumulating  
dangers to the peace of the two countries, all the  
mutual advantages of re-established friendship  
and confidence ; we have seen that the British  
cabinet perseveres, not only in withholding a  
remedy for other wrongs, so long and so loudly  
calling forit ; but inthe execution, brought home  
to the threshold of our territory, of measures  
which, under existing circumstances, have the  
character, as well as. the effect, of war on Gir  
lawful commerce.

and for su preparation of the great body, us  
will proportion its usefulness to its intrinsic ca-  
pacities. Nor can the occasion fail to remind |  
you of the importance of those military semina-  
rics, which, in every event, will form a valus-  
ble and frugal part of our military estabiish-  
ment.  
  
The manufacture of cannon and smal! arms  
has proceeded with due success, and the stock  
  
and resources ofall the necessary munitions are |  
adequate toemergencies. I. will not be inexpe- |  
dient, howeye@r, for congress to authorise an en-  
largement of them.  
  
Your attention will of course be drawn to such  
provisions, on the subject of cur naval force, as  
mey be required for the services to which it  
muy be best adapted. I submit to congress the |  
seasonableness, also, of in authority to augment |  
the stock of such materia!s as are imperishable  
in their naf™re, or may not at once be attaina-  
ble.  
  
in contemplating the scenes which distinguish  
this momentous epoch, and estimating their  
claims to our attention, it is impossible to over-  
look those developing themselves among the  
great communiues which occupy the southern  
begin of our own hemispheres and ex end into  
  
¢ighbourhood. Anenlarged philanthropy,  
and an enlightened forecast, concur in imposing  
on our national councils an obligation to take a  
deep interest in their destinies ; to cherish re-  
cipiocal sentiments of good will; to regard the |  
progress of the events; and not to be uaprepar- |  
ec for whotever order of things may be uitimate- |  
ly establishedsy™ ”  
  
Lider anot Faspect of our situation, the ear- |  
ly attention of congress will be due to the expe- |  
diency of further guards against evasions and in-  
fractions of our commercial laws. The practice |  
of smugeting, which is odious every where, and  
perticuiarly crintinal in free governments, where,  
the laws being meade by ail for the good of all, a  
fraud is committed on every individual as well as  
Oi. ine siate, attains its utmost guilt, when it  
biends, with.a pursuit of ignominious gain, a}  
treacherous subserviency, us the transgressors,  
to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own  
country. “I: is then that the virtuous indignation  
of the public sheuid be enabled to manifest itseli.  
through the reguiar animadversions of the most  
competent laws.  
  
To secure greater respect to our mercantile |  
flag, and to the honest interest which it covers; |  
it is expectent also, that it be made punishable  
in our citizens, to accept licences from foreicn |  
LOVER MENLS, for a trade unlawfully interdicted  
by them (o Other American citizens 3 or to trade |  
under false colours or po pers of any sort. |  
  
A prohibition is equaliy called for, against the |  
acceptance, by our citizens, of special licences, |

Although other subjcts will press more im-

ufactures from sacrifices Which a change of cir-  
  
cles at least, as belong to our defence and ow  
primary wants, we should not be left in unneces-  
sury dependance on external supplies. And  
whilst foreign governments adhere to the exist-  
ing discriminations in their ports against our nav-  
igation, and an equality or lesser discrimination  
is enjoyed by their navigation, in our ports, the  
effect cannot be mistaken, because it has been  
seriously feit by our shipping interest; and in  
proporton us this takes place, the advantages of  
an independent conveyance of our products to

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and 1

requested by Capt, Rodgers, are com­  
“municated ; together with the corres­  
pondence relating to the occurence, be­  
tween the Sccretary of State and His  
Brittanick Majesty’s Eavoy. To these

which have passed on the subject of the  
British Orders in Council ; and to both  
the correspondeaces relating to the Flori­

)€ justice an fairness which have  
been evinced on the part of the U. States  
towards France, both befee and since  
(he revoeation of her decrees, authoriz­  
ed an expectation that her government  
would have followed up that measure by  
all such others as were due to cur reaso­  
nable claims, as well as dictated by its  
smicable professions, « No proof, how­  
cver, is yet given of afintention 1o re­  
nir the other wrongs done to the United  
States : and particularly to restare the  
reat amount of American property seiz­  
“d under edicts which, though not ai­  
iccting our neutral relations, and, there­  
fore, not cutering into questions between  
die United States andd other belligerents,  
were nevertheless founded on such un­  
just principles, that the reparation ought  
0 have Leen prompt and umple.  
In addition to this, and other demands  
of strict right, on that mation, the Unit.  
ed States have much reason to be dissat­  
isfied with the rigorous and uncxpeeted  
restrictions, to which their trade with the  
French dominions has been subjected ;  
and which if not discontinued, will re­  
quire at least corresponding réstrictions  
on importations irom France into the U.  
States.  
- On all those subjects our Minister  
Plenipotentiary, lately sent to Paris, has  
carried with him the necessary instruc­  
btions . the result of which wiil be com­  
municated to you, and by ascertaming  
the ulteriour peiicy of the French gov­  
crument towards the United Stares, will  
enable you to adapt to it that of the U,  
States, towards I rance.  
Our other forcign relations remain  
without unfavourable changes. With  
Russia they are on the best footing of  
friendship. The ports of Sweden have  
afforded proofs of friendly dispositions  
rowards our commernce, in the councils  
50 that nation also. And the informa­  
tion from our special Minister to Den­  
mark, shews that the mission had been  
attended with valuable effects to our citi­  
zens, whose property had been so ex.  
tensively violated and endangered by  
cruisers unde the Danish flag. :  
Under the ominous indications wh?cv‘  
-oramanded attention, 1t became a duty  
to exert the means committed to the ex­  
contive department, in providing for the  
weralsecurity, The worksof defence  
o our paniime frontier have accordingly  
s prosecuied, widh an activity leaving  
e added for the completion of  
S Imest impo tant ones 3 und as partic­  
vt aited for co-operation in emerg­  
oo a pertion of the Guo Boats, have,  
0o cuar harbours, been ordered In­  
to wse. The ships of war belore in  
commission, withthe addition of a Irnigate,  
nve been chiclly employed, as a cruis­  
mg puard to the rights of our coast.  
And such a disposiiion has been made of  
our land forces, us vus thought to pro­  
mise the services most appropriate and  
important. i this disposiien 1s incilud­  
ed a force consisting of vegulars and mi.  
litin, embodied in the Indhiana Terntory, |  
avd marched towards our fvoith Wes- |  
em frontier. This wcasure was made  
requisite by several muidors and depre­  
dations commiticd by Indians ; but  
more especially by the menaang prepa­  
rations and aspect of a combination of  
them on the Wabash, under bie influ­  
ence arzl direction of a fanatick of the  
Shawanese tribe. With these »xcep.  
tions, the Indian tribes retain theirjeace­  
able dispositions towards us, and their  
usual pursuits. |  
I must now add, that the period is  
arrived, which claims from the Legis.  
tive Guardians of the national rights.  
system of more am‘sk: provisions for  
muintaining them. Notwithstanding the&#x27;  
scrupulous justice, the protfacted med­  
eration, and the multiphed efforts on the  
part of the United States, - to substitute,  
for the accumulating dangers to the peace  
of the two countrics, all the mutual ad­  
vantages of re-establishied friendship and  
[ confidence ; we have seca that the Brit­  
ish Cabinet perseveres not only in” with­  
holding a remedy for other wrongs ; so  
long and so loudlg&#x27;xning for it ; but in  
the c¢xecution, ght home to the  
threshold of opr territory, of measures  
which under existing circumstances,have  
the character, as well as the cficet, of  
war on our lawful commerce.  
With this evidence of hostile inflexi­  
ity in wrampling on rights which no  
  
Tndependent Naticn can relinguish ;  
Congress will feel the duty of putting  
the 6nitcd States into an armour, and  
an attitude demanded by the crisis, and  
corresponding with the rational spirit and  
expectations. &#x27;  
rrcccommcnd accordin?y, that ade­  
quate provisions be made for filling the  
ranks and prolonging the .enlistments of  
regular troops, for an auxiliary force, to  
0 be engaged for a more limited term ;  
for the zcceptance of volunteer corps,  
whose patriotick ardour may court a par­  
ticipation in urgent services ; for detach­  
ments, as they may be wanted, of oth­  
er portions of the militia; and for such  
a preparaticn of the great bedy, as will  
proportion its usefulness to its intrinsick  
capacities. Nor cun the occasion fail to  
remind you of the importance of those  
military seminaries, which, in every e­  
vent, will form a valucble and frugal  
part of our miiitary establishment.  
&quot;F&#x27;he manufacture of canncn and small  
arms has preeceded with due success,  
and the siock and resources of all unnes­  
sery mpunitions are adequate to emergen­  
cics. It will not be inexpedient, how­  
ever, for Congress to authorize an en­  
largement of them. &#x27;  
Your attention will of course be drawn  
to such provisions, on the subject of our  
naval force, as may be required for the  
services to which it may be best adapted.  
I submit to Congress the scasonableness,  
also of an authority to augment the stock  
of such materials, asare imperishable in  
their nature, or may not at once be at­  
tainubles  
  
In contemplating the scenes which  
distinguish this momentous epoch, and  
estimating their claims to our attention,  
it is impossible to overlook those devel­  
oping tﬁcmselvcs among the great ccm­  
munities which occupy the southern por­  
tion of our own hemisphere, ard extend  
into our meighbourhood. An enlarg=d  
philanthropy, and an enlightened fore­  
cast, concur in imposing on our Nation­  
al Councils, an obligation to take 2 deep  
interest in their destinies ; to cherish re­  
ciprocal sentiments of good will; to re­  
gard the progress of the events ; and not  
to be unprepared for whatever order of  
things may be ultimatcly established.  
lfndcr another aspect of our situation,  
the carly attention of Congress will be  
due to the expediency of further guards  
against evasions and infractions of our  
commercial laws. The practice of smug­  
gling, which is odious every where, and  
particularly eriminal in free governments,  
where, the laws being made by all for the  
good of all, a fraud is committed on ev­  
ery individual as well as on the state, at~  
tains its utmost guilt, when it blends,  
with a pursuit of ignominious gain a  
treachcrous subserviency, i the tran  
gressors, to a loreign policy adverse to  
that of their own country. It is then  
that the virtuous indignation of ‘the pub­  
lick should be enabled to manifest itself,  
through the regular animudversion of the  
most competent Jaws,  
&quot;T&#x27;o secure greater respect to our mer­  
cantile flag, and to the honest interest  
which it covers ; it is cxpedient also,  
that 1t be made punishable in our citizens,  
o aceept licences from foreign govern­  
wcints, tor a trade unlawfully interdicted  
by thcm to other Ameriean citizens ; or  
t trade under fuise colours or papers of  
anv sort.  
  
A prohibition is equally called for, a­  
gainst the acceptance, by our citizens, of  
special licences, to be used in a trade  
with the United States ; and against the  
admission into particular parts of the U,  
States, of vessels from foreign countries,  
authorized to trade with particular ports  
only.  
  
Although other subjects will press  
morce immediately on your deliberations,  
a portion of them cannot but well be bes­  
towed, on the just and sound policy of  
scturing to our manufactures the success  
they have attained, and are still attaining,  
“n jome degree, under the impulse of  
Guys not permanent ; and to our navi­  
881G, the fair extent of which it is at  
presek abridged by the unequal regula­  
-lons ¢ foreign governments.  
Besitg the reasonablencss of saving  
our MatGetures from sacrifices which a  
change Okjrcymstances might bring on  
them, the yional interest requires, that,  
with respeCeq such articles at Jeast as

wants, we shygq not be left in unneces.-

expected, put into rnore rigorous execution and  
it communicated through the British, Envoy just

fellow Citizen aftbe Senate, . ,r-qnd  
of the. Houee, ofHefireseruauva  
&#x27; In calling you together sooner than  
a separation from your homes would o­  
therwise have been .required j I yielded  
to considerations drawn from th pos­  
ture of our foreign affairs ; and in fixing  
the present, for the time of your meet­  
ing, regard was had to the . probability  
of further devjlopements of. the policy  
of the belligerent powers towards tnis  
country, which might the more unite  
the, national councils, in the &#x27;measures  
to be pursued. x . , t  
At the close of the last session of Com  
grss, it was hoped that the successive:  
confirmations of the extinction of the  
French decrees, so far as they violated  
our neutral commerce, -would have in  
duced the!government of Great-Britain  
to repeal its orders in council, and there­  
by authorise a removal of the existing  
obstructions to her commerce with the  
United States. 4  
Instead of this reasonable step to­  
wards satisfaction and friendship be­  
tween the two nationsoihe orders were,  
at a moment when least to have been  
expected, put into more rigorous exe­  
cution ; and it was communicated, thro&#x27;  
the&#x27; Britih Envoy just arrived,&quot; that  
whilst the revocation of the Edicts of  
Frar.ce, as officially made known to the  
Uri&#x27;ish governmriit, was denied to have  
taken plce it was an indpensable  
condi i.jn of the repeal of the British or­  
der, that commerce sb uld be restored  
to a footing that would admit the pro  
ductions and manufactures . of -.Great  
Briruin, when ownd by neutrals, inj  
markets shut against them by her. ene  
my ; the United Spates being given t  
understand that, m tne mean  
time, - a  
continuance of their non-importation  
act would lead to measures of retalia&#x27;ibn.  
&#x27; At a later date, it has indeed anpear­  
ed, Jht a communication to the British  
government, of fresh evidence of the re­  
peal of the French decrees against oUr  
neurral trade, was followed by an inti­  
mation, lhat it had been transmitted o  
the British Plenipotentiary heie; in or­  
der that it might receive full consideta  
tion, i:i the depending discussions. Thi.  
communication appears not to have been  
received t But the transmission of tbi-tht-r,  
instead of founding oh it an actu­  
al repeal of the orders, or , assurances  
that the repeal would ensue, will not per­  
mit. us to rely on any effective change  
in the Brkish cabinet. To be ready to  
mte with&#x27; cordiality satisfactory proofs  
of .uph a chang&#x27;e, and to pioceed, in  
the mean time, in adapting our ms­  
sues to the&#x27;viewS&#x27; which have been dis  
closed through that minister, will besC  
C9nsult our whole duty &#x27;

Fellow Citizens of  
  
THE Senate, and of the  
  
House of Representatives,  
  
In calling you togctlicr soo.ncr than a  
.separation from your homes Mould other-  
wise have been rc(|uired, I yielded to con-  
siderations drawn from the posture of our  
foreign affairs; and in fixing the present,  
for the time of your meeting, regard was  
had to the probability of further developc-  
ments of the policy of the belligerent  
powers towards this country, which  
might the mor. unite the national coun-  
cils, in the measures to be pursued.  
  
At the close of the last session of Con-  
gress, it was hoped that the successive  
confirmations of the extinction of the  
French dccress, sofar as they violated our  
neutral commerce, would have induced  
the government of Great Britain to re-  
peal its orders in council, and thereby au-  
thorise a removal of the existing obstruc-  
tions to her commerce with the United  
States.  
  
Instead of this reasonable step towards  
satisfaction and friendship between the  
two nations, the orders were, at a moment  
when least to have been expected, put in-  
to more rigorous execution ; and it was  
communicated, through the British En-  
voy just arrived, that whilst the revoca-  
tion of the edicts of France, as officially  
made known to the British government,  
was denied to have taken place ; it was  
an indispensable condition of the repeal of  
the British orders, that commerce should  
be i\ stored to a fooling that would admit  
the productions and manufactures of (i.  
Britain, when owned by neuti*als, into  
markets shut against them by her ene-  
my ; the United States being given to un-  
derstand that, in the mean t me, a contin-  
uance of their non-importation act rvoiild  
lead to measures of retaliation.  
  
At a later date, indeed appeared, tliat a  
communication to the British govern-  
ment, of fresli evidence of the repeal of  
the French decrees against our neutral  
trade, was followed by an intimation, that  
it l;ad bcei i transmitted to the British ple-  
nipotentiary here ; in order that it might  
receive full consideration, in the depend-  
ing discussions. Tins communication ap-  
pears not to have been received: But  
the transmission of it hither, instead of  
founding oi \ it an acai.T,! repeal of the or-  
ders, or ass lirances that the repeal ivould  
ensue, will not permit us to roly on any  
effective change in the British cabinet.  
To be rcadjt to meet with cordiality satis-  
factory pic ofs of such a change, and to  
proceed, in the mean time, in adapting  
our measui vs to the views which have  
been disclo sed through that minister, will  
best consult our whole c’uty.  
  
In the un Friendly spirit of those disclo-  
suros, inde.ninity and redress for other  
wrongs havi ; continued to be withheld ;  
ar.d our coa sts and the mouths of our har-  
bours have again witnessed scenes not  
less derogati ary to the dearest of our na-  
tional rights , tlian vexatious to the regu-  
lar coiu&#x27;se Oi ’ our trade.  
  
.\mong t he occurrences produced by  
the conduct of British ships of war ho-  
vering on cu r coasts, was an encounter  
between one of them and the American  
frigate ccmi nanded by captain Rodgers,  
rendereti un: ivoidable on the jiait of tlie  
latter, by a fire, commenced without  
cause, by tlie former; whose command-  
er is, thereforo?, alone chargeable with the  
blood iinfortui Ki tely shed in maintaining  
the honor of tjhe American Hag. The  
  
proceedings of a court of enguiry re-  
quested by Captain Rodgers, are commu-  
nicated ; together with the correspon-  
dence relating to the occurrence, between  
the Seci&#x27;etary of State and His Britanic  
Majesty&#x27;s Envoy. To thesa are added,  
the several corresixindcnces which have  
passed on the subject of the British Or-  
ders in Council ; and to both, the cor-  
respondence relating to the Floridas, in  
which Congress will be made actpiaint-  
ed with the interposition which the govs  
ernment of Great-Britain has thought  
proper to make against the proceedings  
of the United States.  
  
The j&#x27;.w ice and fairness which have  
been evinced on the part of the United  
States towards France, both before and  
since the revocation of her Decrees, au-  
thorised an expectation that her govern-  
ment would have followed up that mea-  
sure by all such others as were due to  
our reasonable claims, as well as dicta-  
ted by its amicable professions. No  
proof, however, is yet given of an inten-  
tion to repair the otlier wrongs done to  
the United States ; and particularly to  
restore the great amount of American  
property seized and condemned under  
edicts, which, though not affecting our  
neutral relations, and, therefore, not en-  
tering into questions between the Uni-  
ted States and other Beligerents, were  
nevertheless founded on such unjust prin-  
ciples, that the reparation ought to have  
been prompt and ample.  
  
In addition to this, and other demands  
of strict right, on that nation ; the Uni-  
ted States have much reason to be dissat-  
isfied with the rigorous and unexpected  
restrictions, to which their trade with  
the French dominions has been subject-  
ed ; and which, if not discontinued, will  
require at least corresponding restric-  
tions on importations from France into  
the United Slates.  
  
On all those subjects our Minister  
Plenipotentiary, lately sent to Paris, has  
carried witii him the necessary instnic-  
tions ; the result of which will be com-  
municated to you, and by ascertaining the  
ulterior policy of t&#x27;ic French govern-  
ment towards the United States, will ena-  
ble you to adapt to it, tliat of the United  
States tOM&#x27;arols France.  
  
Our other foreign relations remain  
without unfavorable changes. With  
Russia, they arc on the best footing of  
friendship. The ports of Sweden have  
afforded proofs of friendly disfxisitions  
towards onr commerce, in the councils  
of that Nation also. And the informa-  
tion from our Special minister to Den-  
mark shews, that the mission had been  
attended with valuable efiects to our ci-  
tizens, whose property had been so ex-  
tensively violated and endangered, by  
cruisers under the Danish flag.  
  
Under the omnious indications which  
commanded attention, it became a dtity, to  
exert the means committed to the Exec-  
utive Department, in providing for the  
general security. The works of defence  
on our maratime frontier have according-  
ly been prosecuted, with an activity leav-  
ing little to be added for the completion  
of the most important ones ; and, as par-  
ticularly suited for co-operation in emer-  
gencies, a portion of the Gun-boats have,  
in particular harljours, been ordered into  
use. The ships of war before in com-  
mission, with the addition of a frigate,  
have been chiefly employed, as a cruis-  
ing guard to the rights of our coast. —  
And such a disposition has been made of  
our land forces, as&#x27;was thought to promise  
the services most appropriate and im-  
portant. In this disposition is included a  
force consisting of regulars and militia,  
embodied in the Indiana Territory, and  
marched towards our North IVestem  
frontier. This measure was made re-  
(juisitc by several murders and deprcda-  
dations committed by Indians ; but more  
especially by the menacing preparations  
  
and aspect of a combination of them, on  
the Wabash, under the influence and di-  
rection of a fanatic of the Shawanese  
Tribe. With these exceptions, the In-  
dian tribes retain their peaceable dispo-  
sitions towards us, and their usual pur-  
suits.  
  
I must now add, that the period is ar-  
rived, which claims from the I.egislative  
Guardians of the National rights a sys-  
tem of more ample provisions for main-  
tauiing them. Notwithstanding the scru-  
pulous justice, the protracted moileration,  
and the multiplied eftbrts on tlie p?Jt of  
the United States, to substitute for the  
accumulating dangers to the peace of the  
two countries all the mutual advantages  
of re-established friendship and confi-  
dence ; w&#x27;c have seen that the British  
Cabinet perseveres, not only in withhold-  
ing a remedy for other wrongs, so long  
and so loudly calling for it ; but in the  
execution, brought home to the thresh-  
old of our &#x27;I&#x27;erritoiy, of measures which,  
under existing circumstances, have the  
character, as well as the effect, of war on  
our lawful commerce.  
  
With this evidence of hostile inflexi-  
bility, in trampling on rights which no  
independent nation can relinqu&#x27;sh ; Con-  
gress will feel the duty of putting tlie U-  
nited States into an armour and an atti-  
tude demanded by the crisis, and corres-  
jionding with the national spirit and ex-  
pectations.  
  
1 recommend, accordingly, that ade-  
quate provision be made for filling the  
ranks and prolonging the enlistments of  
the regular troops ; for an auxilary force,  
to be engaged for a more limited term ; for  
the acet ptance of volunteer corps, whose  
patriotic ardor may court a participation in  
urgent services ; for detachments, as tlu y  
may be wanted, of other [lortioiis of the  
militia ; and for such a preparation of  
the great body, as will proportion its use-  
fulness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor  
can the occasion fail to remind you of tiie  
importance of those Military Seminaries,  
which, in every event, will form a valua-  
ble and frugal part of our military estab-  
lishment.  
  
The manufacture of cannon and small  
anus has proceeded with due siiec. ss,  
and the slock and resources of all the ne-  
cessary munitioFs arc adequate to emer-  
gencies. It will not be inexpedient,  
however, for Congress to authorise an  
enlargement of them.  
  
Your attention will of course be drawn  
to such provisions, on the subject cf our  
naval force, as may be retiuircd for the  
services to which it may be best adapted.  
  
I submit to Congress, the seasonableness,  
also, of an authority to augment the stock  
of such materials, as are imperishable in  
their nature, or may not at once be attain-  
able.  
  
In contemplating the scenes which dis-  
tinguish this momentous epoch, and es-  
timating their claims to our attention, it  
is impossible to overlook those develop-  
ing themselves among the great commu-  
nities which occupy the southern portion  
of our own hemisphere, and extend into  
our neighborhood. An enlarged philan-  
thropy, and an enlightened forecast, con-  
cur in imposing on the National Councils  
an obligation to take a deep interest in  
their destinies ; to cherish reciprocal sen-  
timents of good will ; to regard the ]iro-  
gress of events ; and not to be unprepar-  
ed for whatever order of thing!/ may be  
ultimately established.  
  
Under another aspect of our situation,  
the early attention of Congress will be  
due to the expediency of further guards  
against evasions and infractions of our  
commercial laws. The practice of smug-  
gling, which is odious every vvherc, and  
particularly criminal in fi-ee governments,  
where, the laws being made by all for  
the good of all, a fraud is committed on  
every individual as well as on the state,  
attains its utmost guilt, when it blends,  
  
with a pursuit of ignominious gain, a  
treacherous subserviency in tlie trans-  
gressors, to a foreign ptdicy, adverse  
to that of their own country. It is then  
that the virtuous indignation of the pub-  
lic should be enabled to manifest itself,  
through the regular aniinadveisior.s of  
the most competent law s.  
  
To secure greater respect to our mer-  
cantile flag, and to the honest interests  
which it covers ; it is expedient also, that  
it be made punishable in our citizei.s, to  
accept licences Irom foreign govern-  
ments, for a trade unlawfully interdicted  
by themlo other American citizens; or to  
trade under false colors or papers of any  
sort.  
  
A prohibition is equally callejj for, a-  
gainst the acceptance, by our citizens,  
of special licences, to be used in a trade  
with the United States; and against the  
admission into particular ports of the U-  
nited States, of vessels from foreign  
countries, authorised to trade with par-  
ticular pons only.  
  
Although other subjects will press  
more immediately on your deliberatioi s,  
a portion of them cannot but be well bes-  
towed on the just and sound policy of se-  
curing to our manufactures the success  
they have attained, and are still attaining,  
in some degree, under the impulse of  
causes not permanent; and to our navi-  
gation, the lair extent of which it is at  
present abritlged by the unequal regula-  
tions of foreign governments.  
  
Besides the reasonableness of saving  
our manufactures from sacrilices which  
a change of circumstances ni&#x27;ght bring  
on them, the national interest requires,  
that with respect to such articles at h ast,  
as belong to our defence, and our prima-  
iT wants, we should not be left hi u:ine-  
ccssai-y dependence on external supplies.  
And whilst foreign governments adhere  
to existing discriminations in their ports  
agaii.st our navigation, and an equality oi‘  
lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their  
navigation, in our ports, the effec t cannot  
be mistaken, because it has been seriously  
felt by our shipping interes&#x27;S; and in  
proportion as this takes place, the advan-  
tage sol an independent coiiveyancc of our  
products to foreign markets, and of a  
grow ing body of mariners, trained by their  
occupations for the service of their coun-  
tn- in times of danger, must be diminished.  
  
The receipts into . the Treasury, during  
the year ending on the 30th of Septem-  
ber Iasi, have exceeded thirteen millic&#x27;As  
and a half of dollars, and have enabled us  
to defray the current expences, including  
the interest on the public debt, and to re-  
imburse more than five millions of dollars  
of the principal, witliout recurring to the  
loan authorised by the act of last session.  
The temporar)’ loan obtained in the latter  
end of the year one thousand eight hun-  
dred and ten, has also been reimbursed,  
and is not included in that amount.  
  
The decrease; of revenue arising from  
the situation of our commerce, and extra-  
ordinary expences which have and may  
become necessaiy, must be taken into  
view, in making commensurate provi-  
sions for the ensuing year. And I recom-  
iiicnd to your consideration, the propriety  
of ensuring a sufficiency of animal reve-  
nue, at least, to defray the ordinary ex-  
pellees of government, and to pay the in-  
terest on the public debt, including that  
on new loans which may be authorised.  
  
I cannot close this communication with-  
out expressing my deep sense of the cri-  
sis in which you arc assembled, my confi-  
dence in a wise and honorable result to  
your deliberations and .assurances of the  
faithful zeal with which my co-operating  
duties will be discharged ; invoking at  
the same time the blessing of H ;.tven .cn  
our beloved country, and on all the mca i:; •  
that may be emploj&#x27;ed, in vindicating its.  
rights, and adviuicing its welfare.

powers with regard to this country, which  
wight the more unite the national councils  
jn the measures to be pursued. At the  
dose of the last session of Congress, it  
was hoped that the successive confirma-  
tion of the extinction of the French decrees,  
80 far as they violated our neutral com-  
merce, would have induced the Govern-  
nent of Great Britain to repeal its Orders  
in Council; and thereby authorise a re-  
moval of the existing obstructions io her  
tommerce with the United States. In-  
gtead of this reasonable step towards sa-  
lisfaction and friendship between the two  
nations, the Orders were, at a moment  
when least to have been expected, put  
into more rigorous execution ; and it was  
communicated through the British Envoy  
just arrived, that whilst the revocation of  
the Edicts of France, as officially made  
known to the British Government, was  
denied to have taken place, it was an in-  
dispensable condition of the British Or-  
ders, that commerce should be restored  
to a footing that would admit the produc-  
tions and manufactures of Great -Britaia,  
when owned by neutrals, into markets  
shut against them by her Enemy; the  
United States being given to understand,  
that in the mean time a continuation of  
their Non-importation Act would lead to  
Measures of retaliation: At a later date  
ithas indeed appeared, that a communi-  
eation to the British Government of fresh  
evidence of the repeal of the French de-  
¢rees against our neutral trade, was fol-  
lowed by an intimation that it had been  
transmitted to the British Plenipotentiary  
here, in order that it might receive full  
@ofsideration in the depending discus-  
tions, This communication appears not  
have been received. But the transmis-  
tion of it hither, instead of founding on it  
mM actual repeal of the orders, or assu-  
vances that the repeal would ensue, will  
Bot permit us to rely on any effective  
change in the British cabinet. To be  
ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory  
proofs of such a change, and to proceed,  
i the mean time, in adapting our mea-  
tires to the views which have been dis-  
dosed through that minister, will best con-  
mit onr whole duty. In the unfriendly  
mirit of these disclosures, indemnity and  
redress for other wrongs have continued  
be withheld, and our coasts and the  
mouths of our harbours have again wit-  
  
scenes, not Jess derogatory to the  
dearest of our national rights, than vexa-  
Hous to the regular course of trade.  
  
Among the occurrences produced by the  
@ndect of British ships of war hovering on  
Our coasts, was an encounter between one  
@ them and the American frigate com-  
Manded by Capt. Rodgers, rendered un-  
sMeidable on the part of the latter by a

alone chargeable with the blood unfortu-  
nately shed in maintaining the honour of  
the American flag. ‘The proceedings of a  
Court of Inquiry, requested by Capiain  
Rodgers, are communicated, together  
with the correspondence relating to the  
occurrence between the Secretary of State  
and his Britannic Majesty’s Envoy. To  
these are added the several correspond.  
cences which have passed on the subject  
of the British Orders in Cotnci! ; and to  
both the correspondence relating to the  
Floridas, in which Congress will be made  
acquainted with the ‘interposition which  
the Government of Great Britain has  
thought proper&#x27;to make against the pros  
ceedings of the United: States. —The jus-  
tice and fairness which have been evinced  
ow the part of the United States towards  
France, both before and since the revocay  
tion of her decrees, authorised an expec-  
tation that her Government would have  
followed up that measure by all such  
others as were due to our reasonable  
claims, as well as dictated by its amicable  
professions. No proof, however, is yet  
given of an intention to repair the other  
wrongs done to the United States; and  
particularly to restore the great amount  
of American prope:ty seized and con-  
demned under edicts which, though aot  
affecting our neutral relations, and there-  
fore not eutgring into questions between  
the United States and other belligerents,  
were nevertheless founded in such unjust  
principles, that the reparation ought te  
have been prompt and ample. Iu addi-  
tion to this and other demands of strict  
right on that nation, the United States  
have much reason to be dissatisfied with  
the rigorous aud unexpected restrictions  
to which their trade with the Prench doe  
minions has beeu subjected; and which,  
if not discontinued, will require at least  
corresponding restrictions on importations  
from France into the United States. On  
all those subjects our Plenipotentiary,  
lately sent to Paris, has carried with him  
the necessary instructions, the result of  
which will be communicated to you ; and  
by ascertaining the ulterior policy of the  
French Government towards the United  
States, will enable you to adapt to it that  
of the United States towards Prance.—Our  
other foreiga relations remain without ua-  
favourable changes: with Russia they are  
on the best footing’ of friendship. The  
ports of Sweden have afforded proofs of  
friendly dispositions towards our come  
merce, in the councils of that nation also,  
And the information from our Special Mi-  
nister to Denmark shews, that the mission  
had been attended with valuable effecta  
to our citizens, whose property had been  
so extensively violated, aud endangered  
  
by cruisers under the Danish flag.  
Under the omiuous indications which  
commanded stientiva, it became a duty  
we  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
643  
  
to exert the means commiited to the exe-  
ecutive department, in providing for the  
general security. The works of defence  
On our maritime frontier have accordingly  
been pr secu ed with an activity, leaving  
littie to be adided for the completion of the  
Most important ques; and, as partucu-  
lariy suited for co-operation in ewergen-  
cies, a portion of the gun-bvats have, ia  
particular harbour-, beea ordered into  
use, The ships of war before in commis-  
sion, with the addition of a frigate, have  
been chiefly employed as a cruising guard  
to the nghts of our coast, And sucha  
disposition has been made of our land  
foices, as was thought to promise the ser-  
vices most appropriate and imporiaut.  
In this disposition is included a force,  
consisting of regulars and militia, embo-  
died in the Indiana territory, and marched  
towards our North-western frontier. This  
measure was made requisite by several  
murders and depredatious commitied by  
Indians; but more especially by the me-  
nacing preparations and aspect of a com-  
bination of them on the Wabash, under  
the influence and direction of a fanatic of  
the Shawanese tribe, With these excep-  
tions, the Indian tribes retain their peace-  
abie dispositions towards us, and their  
usual pursuits,  
  
I must now add, that the period is ar-  
rived, which claims from the Legislative  
Guaidian: of the National Rights a system  
ef more anple provisions for maintaining  
them. Norwithstanding the scrupulous  
justice, the protracted moderation, and  
the multiplied efforts, on the part of the  
United States, to substitute, for the ac-  
cumulating daugers to the peace of the  
two countries, ali the mutual advantages  
of re-established friendship and confi-  
dence, we have seen that the British  
Cabinet perseveres, not only in with-  
holding a remedy for other wrongs, so  
long and so loudiy calling for it; but in  
the execution, brought home to the thresh-  
old of our territory, of measures which,  
under existing circumstauces, have the  
character, as well as the effect of war, on  
our lawful commerce. With this evidence  
of hostile inflexibility, in trampling on  
rights which no independent nation can  
relinquish ; Congress will feel the duty of  
putting the United States into an armoup  
and an attitude demanded by the crisis,  
and corresponding with the national spirit  
aud expectations. 1 recommend, accord-  
ingly, that adequate provisions be made  
for filling the ranks and prolonging the  
enlistments of the regular troops; for an  
auxiliary force, to be engaged for a more  
limited term; for the acceptance of vo-  
lunteer corps, whose patriotic ardour may  
court a participation iv urgent services ;

—Feliow Citizens of the Senate and of the  
House of Representatives,—In calling you  
together sooner than a separation from  
vour homes would otherwise have been  
required, i yielded to considerations drawn  
from the posture of ovr foreign affairs ;  
and in fixing the present for the time o!  
your meeting, regard was had _to the pro-  
bability of farther developemenis of the  
policy of the belligerent powers towards  
this country, which might the more unite  
the national councils in the measures to be  
pursued.—At the close of the last session  
of Congress, it was hoped that the suc-  
cessive confirmations of the extinction of  
the French decrees, so far asthey violated  
our neutral commerce, would have in-  
duced the government of Great Britain to  
repeal its orders in council; and thereby  
authorise a removal of the’ existing ob-  
structions to her commerce .with the  
United States.—Instead of this reasonable  
step towards satisfaction and friendship  
between the two nations, the orders were,  
at a moment when least to have been ex-  
pected, put into more vigorous execution ;  
aud it was communicated through the  
British knvoy just arrived, that whilst the  
revocation of the Edicts of France, as of-  
ficially made known to the British Go-  
vernment, was denied to have taken place,  
it was an indispensable condition of the re-  
peal of the British Orders, that commerce  
should be restored to a footing, that would ad-  
mit the productions and manufactures of Great  
Britain, when owned by neutrals, into markets  
shut against them by her enemy; the United  
States being given to understand, that, in  
the mean time, a continuance of their  
Non-importation Act would Jead to mea-  
sures of retaliation.—At a later date, it has  
indeed, appeared, that a communication to  
he | Government, of fresh evidence  
of the repeal of the French decrees against  
eur neutral trade, was followed by an in-

[726  
  
timation, that it had been transmitted  
to the British plenipotentiary here, in  
order that it might receive full considera-  
tion in the depending discussions. This  
communication appears not to have been  
received: but the tratismission of it hither  
instead of founding on it an actual repeal  
of the orders, or assurances that the repeal  
  
&#x27; would ensne, will not permit us to rely on  
  
any effective change im the British Cabi-  
net. To be ready to meet with cordiality  
satisiactory prools of such a change, and  
to proceed, in the mean time in adapting  
our measures to the views which have been  
disclosed through that minister, will best  
  
/ consult our whole duty.—In the unfriend-  
  
ly spirit of those disclosures, indemnity  
and redress for other wrongs have con-  
tinned to be withheld ; and our coasts and  
the mouths of our harbours have again  
witnessed scenes, not less derogatory to  
the dearest of our national rights than  
vexatious to the regular course of our  
trade.—Among the occurrences produced  
by the conduct of British ships of war  
hoverivg on our coasts, was an encounter  
between one them and the American fri-  
gate commanded by Captain Rodgers,  
rendered unavoidable on the part of the  
latter, by a fire commenced without cause  
by the former; whose Commander is,  
therefore, alone chargeable with the blood  
unfortunately shed in maintaining the ho-  
nour of the American flag. ‘The proceed-  
ings of a Court of Enquiry, requested by  
Captain Rodgers, are communicated ; to-  
gether with the correspondence relating  
to the occurrence, between the Secretary  
of State and his Britannic Majesty’s Envoy.  
To these are added, the several corre-  
spondencies which have passed on the  
subject of the British Orders in Council ;  
and to both, the correspondence relating  
to the Floridas, in which Congress will be  
made acquainted with the interposition  
which the Government of Great Britain  
has thought proper to make against the  
proceedings of the United States.—The  
justice and fairness which have been  
evinced onthe part of the United States to-  
wards France, both before and since the  
revocation of her decrees, authorised an  
expectation that her Government would  
have followed up that measure by all such  
others as were due to our reasonable claims,  
as well as dictaied by its amicable profes-  
sions. No proof, however, is yet given of  
an intention to repair the other oe  
done to the United States, and, particalarly  
to restore the great amount of American

property seized and condemned under  
edicts, which, though not affecting our  
neutral relations, and therefore, not en-  
tering into questions between the United  
States and other belligerents, were never-  
theless founded in such unjust principles,  
that the reparation ought to have been  
prompt and ample.—in addition to this  
and other demands of strict right on that  
nation, the United States have much reason  
to be dissatisfied with the rigorous aud  
unexpected restrictions. to which their  
trade with the French dominions has been  
subjected ; and which, if not discontinued  
will require at least corresponding restric-  
tions on importations from France into the  
United States —On all those subjects our  
Minister Plenipotentiary, lately sent to  
Paris, has carried with him the necessary  
instructions ; the result of which will .be  
communicated to you ; and by ascertain-  
ing the ulterior policy of the French Go-  
vernment towards the United States, will  
enable you to adapt to it that of the  
United States towards France.—Our other  
foreign relations remain without unfavour-  
able changes. Wath Russia, they are on  
the best focting of iriendship. The ports  
of Sweden have aflorded proofs of friendly  
dispositions towards our commerce in the  
councils of that nation also, And the in-  
formation from our Special Minister to  
Denmark, shews, that the mission had been  
attended with valuable effects, to our  
citizens, whose property had been so ex-  
tensively violated and endangered by  
  
cruisers under the Danish flag —Under.  
  
the ominous indications which command-

the means committed to the Executive  
department; in providing for the general  
security. ‘The works of defence on our  
maritime frontier have accordingly been  
prosecuted with an activity leaving little  
to be added for the completion of the most  
important ones; and, as particulary suited  
for co-operation in emergencies, a portion  
of the gun-boats have, in particular har-  
bours, been ordered into use. The ships  
of war before in commission, with the ad-  
  
dition of a frigate, have been chiefly em-  
  
ployed, as a cruising guard to the rights  
of our coast ; and such a disposition has  
been made of our land forces, as was  
thought to promise the services most ap-  
propriate and important. In this dispo-  
sition is included a force, consisting of re-

With  
these exceptions, the Indian tribes retain  
their peaceable dispositions towards Us,  
and their usual pursuits.—I must now add,  
that the period is arrived, which claims  
from the legislative guardians of the na-  
tional rights a system of more ample pro-  
visions for maintaining them. - Nowwith-  
  
standing the scrupulous justice, the pro-  
  
tracted moderation, and the multiplied  
efforts on the part of the United States, to  
substitute, for the accumulating dangers  
to the peace of the two countries, ail the  
mutual advantages of re-established friend-  
ship and confidence; we have seen that  
the British Cabinet perseveres, not only in  
withholding a remedy for’ other wrongs,  
so long and so loudly calling for it, but in  
the execution, brought home to the thres-  
hold of our territory, of measures which,  
under existing circumstances, have the  
character as well as the effect of war on  
our lawfal commerce.—W ith this evidence  
of hostile inflexibility, im trampling on  
rights which no independent nation can  
relinquish, Congress will feel the duty ol  
putting the United States into an armour  
and an attitude demanded by the crisis,  
and corresponding with the national spirit  
and expectations. —I recommend, accord  
ingly, that adequate provision be mate lot  
filling the ranks.and prolonging the enlist  
ments of the regular troops; for an ausi-  
iary force, to be engaged for a mvt  
limited term; for the acceptance of

may court a participation in urgent ys  
vices; for detachments, as they may  
wanted, of other portions of the multi  
and for such a preparation of the gre  
body, as will proportion. its usefulness  
its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the andl

of our naval force, as may be required for  
the services to which it may be best  
adapted. I submit to Congress the sea-  
sonableness, also, of an authority to aug-  
ment the stock of such materials as are  
imperishable in their nature, or may not  
atonce be attainable.—In contemplating  
the scenes which distinguish this moment-  
ous epoch, and estimating their claims to  
our attention, it ts impossible to overlook  
those developing themselves among the  
great communities which occupy the  
southern portion of our own hemisphere,  
and extend into our neighbourhood. An  
enlarged philanthropy, and an enlightened  
forecast, concur in imposing on the Na-  
tional Councils an obligation to take a  
deep interest in their destinies; to cherish  
reciprocal sentiments of good will ; to re-  
gard the progress of events; and not to be  
unprepared for whatever order of things  
may be ultimately established.—Under  
another aspect of our situation, the early  
attention of Congress will be due to the  
expediency of farther guards against eva-  
sions and infractions of our commercial  
lavs. The practice of smuggling, which  
is odious every where, and particularly  
criminal in free governments, where,  
the laws being made by all for the  
good of all, a fraud is committed on every  
individual as well as on the State, attains  
its utmost guilt, when it blends, with a  
pursuit of ignominious gain, a treacherous  
subserviency, in the transgressors, to a fo-  
reign policy adverse to that of their own  
country. It is then that the virtuous in-  
dignation of the public should be enabled  
to manifest itself, through the regular ani-  
madversions of the most competent laws.  
—To secure greater respect to our mercan-  
tile flag, and to the honest interests which  
it covers, it is expedient, also, that it be  
made punishable in our citizens to accept  
licences from foreign Governments, for a  
trade unlawfully interdicted by them to  
other American’ citizens; or to~ trade  
under false colours or papers of any sort.—  
A prohibition is equally called for against  
the acceptance, by our citizens, of special  
licences, to be used in a trade with the  
United States; and against the admission  
into particular ports of the United States,  
of vessels from foreign countries, autho-  
rised to trade ‘with particular ports only.  
—Although other subjects will press more  
immediately on your deliberations, a por-  
tion of them cannot but ‘be well bestowed

attained, and are still attaining, in some  
degree, under the impulse of causes not  
periuaneut ; and to our navigation, the fair  
extent of which it is at present abridged,  
by the unequal regulations of foreign go-  
vernments.—-Besides the reasonableness of  
saving our manufacturers from sacrifices  
which a change of circumstances might  
bring on them, the national interest re-  
quires, that, with respect to such articles,  
at least, as belong to our defence and our  
primary wants, we should not be left in  
unnecesary dependence on external sup-  
plies. And whilst foreign governments  
adhere to the existing discriminations in  
their ports against our navigation, and an  
equality or lesser discrimination is enjoyed  
by their navigation in our ports, the effect  
cannot bermistaken, because it has been  
seriously felt by our shipping interests ;  
and in proportion as this takes place, the  
advantages of an independent conveyance  
of our products to foreign markets, and of  
a growing body of mariners, trained by  
their occupations for the service of their  
country in times of danger, must be dimi-  
nished. The receipts into the Treasury,  
during the year ending on the 30th of  
September last, have exceeded thirteen  
millions and an half of dollars: and have  
enabled us to defray the current expences,  
including the interest on the public debt,  
and to reimburse more than five inillions  
of dollars of the principal, without recur-  
ring to the loan authorised by the act of  
the last session. ‘The temporary loan ob-  
tained in the latter end of the year 1810  
has also. been reimbursed, and is not in-  
cluded in that amount.—The decrease of  
revenue, arising from the situation of our  
commerce and the extraordinary expences  
which have and may become necessary,  
must be taken into view, in making com-  
mensurate provisions for the ensuing year.  
And I recommend to your consideration  
the propriety of ensuring a sufficiency of  
annual revenue, at least to defray the or-  
dinary expences of government, and to  
pay the interest on the public debt, in-  
cluding that on ngw loans which may be  
authorised. I cannot close this communi-  
cation without expressing my deep sense  
of the crisis in which you are assembled,  
my confidence in a wise and honourable  
result to your deliberations, and assurances  
of the faithful zeal with which my co-  
operating duties will be discharged; in-

At the close of the last Session of Congress, it was hoped that  
the successive confirmations of the extinction of the Freuch De-  
erees, go for as they vidlated our neutral commerce, would  
have induced the Government of Great Britain to repeal its Or-  
ders in Council; and thereby authorisea removal of the existing  
obstructions to her commerce with the United States. ae  
Tostead of this reasonable step towards satisfaction and friend-  
ship between the two nations, the orders weré, at 2 moment  
when least to have been expected, put into more rigoreus exe-  
ecution; and it was communicated through the British Envay  
just arrived, that, whilst the revocation of the Edicts of Fraoce,  
a3 officially made known to the British Government, was denied  
  
to have taken place, it was an indispensable contition of the  
  
repeal of the British Orders, that commerce should he restored  
ty a footing, that would admit the productions and mauufactures  
of- Great Britain,. when owned by neutrals, into markets: shut  
against them by her enemy; the United States being given to  
understand, that, in the mean time, a continezsce of their Non-  
importation Act would lead to measures of retaliation.  
  
‘Ata later date, it las, indeed, appeared, that a communi-  
cation to the British Goveroment,, of fresh evisience of the re-  
peal of the French Decrees against our neutral trade, was fol-  
lowed by an‘intimation, that it had been fransthitted: to ‘the

THE EXAMINER. ‘783

In contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momento:  
epoch, and estimating their claims to our attention; it is im-  
possible to. overlook those developing themselves among the  
great communities which orcupy the southern portion of our  
gwn hemisphere, and extended into our neighbourhood, Ao  
enlarged piilanthropy, and an enlightened forecast, concur in  
imposing on the Natiohal Coxncils an obligatidh to take a dee)  
interest in their destinies; to cherish recipro.?.! sentiments of  
good w itty to regard the progress of events; not to be unpre-  
pared for whatever order of things may be ultimately established,  
  
Under another aspect of our situation, the early attention of  
Congress will be due to the expediency of.farther guards against  
evasions aod infractions of owt commercial laws. The practice  
of smuggling, which is odious every where, and particularly  
criminal in&#x27; free governments, where, the laws being made by  
al! for thegood of all, a fraud is committed on evety individual  
as well as onthe State, attains its utmost guilt, when it blends,  
with @ pursuit of ignominous gain, a treacherous sebserviency,  
  
. ia. the Wansgressors, to a foreign policy attverse totbat af their  
own country. It is then that the virtwons indignation of the  
public should-he enabled to manifest itself, through the regular  
suimadversiohs of the most competent laws.  
  
To secure greater respect to our merenntile flag, and to the  
honest interests, which it covers, it is expedient; wiso, that it be  
made punishable in our citizens to accept licenc~s from foreign  
Governments, for a trade unlawfully Interdicted by them to  
obuer American citizens; ar to trade ender false colours or  
papers of any sort.  
  
A prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance,  
by our citizens, of special licences, to be used in a trade with  
the United Sidtes; and against the admission into pagticular  
  
&#x27; ports of the United Siates, of veisels from foreign countries,  
  
authorised to trade with particular ports only.  
  
Although other subjects will press more immediately on your  
deliberations, a portium of them cannot. bat be well bestowed  
om the just and sound policy of secaring ta our manufacturers the  
Success they have attained, and are still aitaining, in some de.  
- fee, under. the impulse of causes not permanent s and te our  
navigation, the fair extent of which is ai present abridged,  
By. the uoequal regulasions of forvign governments.  
  
Besides the reasonableness of saving our jnunufactarers from  
. bacrifces which a change of circumstances might bring on them,  
the national interest requires, that,with respect to such articles,  
at leust, as belong to our defeuce and pur primary wants, we  
should pot be left in unnecessary dependence on external sup-  
plies. And whilst foreign governments adhere to existing dis-  
criminatious ig their ports against our navigation, and an eqan-  
tity of lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their navigation in oar  
perts, the effect cannot he mistaken, becanse bas been se-  
ridusly felt by our shipping iuteresis; and ia proportion as  
this takes place, the advantages of au independent coaveyaace  
wf our praducis ta foreign markets, and of a growing body of  
mariners, trained by their occupations for the service of their  
euuniry in times of danger, muyt be diminished,  
  
The receipts tute the Treasury, during the year ending on  
the 30th of September lust, buve exceeded 13 millions and an  
half of dollars; aod have enabled us to defray the current ex-  
peuces, including the interest on the public debt, and to r¢im-  
burse wore than five millions of dollars of the priocipal, without  
recurring to the loan authorised by the Act of the last Session.  
The temporary laan obtained in the later end of the year 1819,  
has also been relinbursed, and is not included in (he amount,  
  
The decrease of reveoue, arising from. the situation of our  
commerce aed ihe extraordinary expences which have and may  
_ become aecessary, must be taken into view, in making cain-

In calling vou together sooner than a  
separation from your homes, would other-  
wise have been required, I yielded to coum  
siderations drawn from the posture of our  
foreign affairs ; and in fixing the present,  
for the time of your meeting, regard was  
had to the probability of further develope  
ments of the policy of the belligerent pow-  
ers towards this country, which might the  
more unite the national councils, in the  
measures to be pursued.  
  
At the close of the last session of Com  
gress it was hoped that the successive  
confirmations of the extinction of the  
French decrees, so far as they violated our  
neutral commerce, would have induced the  
government of Great Britain to repeal ms  
orders in council; and thereby autheriz  
a removal of the existing obstructions @  
her commerce with the United States.  
  
Instead of this reasonable step to  
satisfaction and friendship between the  
two nations, the orders were at a moment  
when least to have been expected puta  
more rigorous execution ; and it was com  
municated through the British envoy jo  
arrived, that, whilst the revocation of the  
edicts of France, as officially made known  
to the British government, was

have taken place; it was an indiépensa-  
ble condition of the repeal of the British  
orders, that commerce should be restored  
toa footing, that would admit the produc-  
sons and manufactures of Great Britain,  
when owned by neutrals, into markets  
shut against them by her enemy ; the Uni-  
ted States being given to understand that,  
in the mean time, a continuance of their  
noo-importation act would lead to measures  
of retaliation.  
  
Ata later date, it has indeed appeared,  
that a communication to the British go-  
yernment of fresh evidence of the repeal of  
the French decrees against our neutral trade,  
was followed by an intimation, that it had  
been transmitted to the British Pleni-  
  
wentiary here,ia order that it might re-  
ceive full consideration in the depending  
discussions, This communication appears  
not tohave been received: But the trans-  
mission of it hither, instead of founding  
oo it an actual repeal of the orders, or  
assurances that the repeal would ensue,  
will not permit us to rely on any effective  
change, in the British cabinet. ‘To be reas  
dy te meet with cordiality satisfactory  
proofs of such a change, and to proceed in  
the mean time,in adapting our measures to  
the views which have been disclosed  
through that minister, will best consult  
our whole duty. é  
  
In the unfriendly spirit of those disclo-  
tures, indemnity and redress for other  
wrongs have continued to be withheld, and  
our coasts and the mouths of our harbours  
have again witnessed scenes not less dero-  
getory to the dearest of our national rights,  
than vexatious to the regular course of  
our trade.  
  
Among the occurrences produced by the  
conduct of British ships of war hovering  
8 our coasts, was an encounter between  
oe of them and the American frigate,  
commanded by Captain Rogers, render-  
edunavoidable, on the part of the latter,  
by a fire, commenced without, cause, by  
the former ; whose commander is, therefore,  
alone chargeable with the blood unfor-  
tunately shed in maintaining the honour  
ofthe American flag, The proceedings of  
acourt of inquiry, requested by Captain  
4, are communicated ; together with  
the correspondence relating to the occur-  
rence, between the Secretary of State and  
his Britannic Majesty’s envoy. To these  
ae added, the several correspondences  
which have passed on the subject of the  
  
tsh orders in council ; and to both,  
  
correspondence relatipg to the Flori-  
  
Documents.

das, in which Congress will be made ac.  
quainted with the interposition which the  
government of Great Britain has thought  
proper to make against the proceedings af  
the United States.  
  
fhe justice and fairness which have  
beenevineed on the part of the United  
States towards France, both before and  
since the revocation of her decrees, au-  
therised an expectation that her governs  
ment would have followed that measure  
by all such others as were due to our rea-  
sonable claims, as well as dictated by its  
amicable professions. No proof, however,  
is yet given of an intention te repair the  
other wronts done to the United States,  
and particularly to restore the great a-  
mount of American property seized and  
condemned under edicts, which, though  
not affecting our neutral relations, and,  
therefore, not entering into questions be-  
tween the United States and other belii-  
gerents, were nevertheless founded on  
such unjust principles that the reparation  
ought to have been prompt and ample.  
  
In addition to this, and other demands of  
strict right, on that mation; the United  
States have much reason to be dissatisfied  
with the rigorous aud unexpected restric-  
tions, to which their trade with the French  
Dominions has been subjected ; atid which,  
if not discontinned, will reguire at least  
corresponding restrictions on importations  
from France into the United States,  
  
On all those subjects our minister pleni-  
potentiary, lately sent to Paris, has care  
ried with him the necessary instructions ;  
the result of which will be communicated  
to you, and by ascertaining the ulterior  
policy of the Freach government towards  
the United States will enable you to adapt  
to it that of the United btates towards  
France.

will feel the duty of putting che United

Fellow Citizens of the Senate  
and of the House of Representatives.  
  
In calling you together, sooner than a separation from your  
homes would otherwise have been required, I yielded to considera-  
tions drawn from the posture of our foreign affairs; and in fixing  
the present, for the time of your meeting, regard was had to the  
probability of further developments of the policy of the belligerent  
powers towards this country, which might the more unite the na-  
tional councils, in the measures to be pursued.  
  
At the close of the last session of Congress, it was hoped that  
the successive confirmations of the extinction of the French de-  
crees, so far as they violated our neutral commerce, would have  
induced the government of Great Britain to repeal its orders in  
council; and thereby authorize a removal of the existing obstruc-  
tions to her commerce with the United States.  
  
Instead of this reasonable step towards satisfaction and friend-  
ship between the two nations, the orders were, at a moment when  
least to have been expected, put into more rigorous execution; and  
it was communicated through the British envoy just arrived, that,  
whilst the revocation of the edicts of France, as officially made  
known to the British government, was denied to have taken place;  
it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the British orders,  
that commerce should be restored to a footing that would admit the  
productions and manufactures of Great Britain, when owned by  
neutrals, into markets shut against them by her enemy: the United  
States being given to understand that, in the mean time, a continu-  
ance of their non-importation act would lead to measures of retali-  
ation.  
  
At a later date, it has indeed appeared, that a communication to  
the British government, of fresh evidence of the repeal of the French

decrees against our neutral trade, was followed by an intimation,  
that it had been transmitted to the British plenipotentiary here, in or-  
der that it might receive full consideration in the depending discus-  
sions. This communication appears not to have been received: But  
the transmission of it hither, instead of founding on it an actual  
repeal of the orders, or assurances that the repeal would ensue, will  
not permit us to rely on any effective change in the British cabinet.  
To be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory proofs of such a  
change, and to proceed, in the mean time, in adapting our measures  
to the views which have been disclosed through that minister, will  
best consult our whole duty.  
  
In the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures, indemnity and re-  
dress for other wrongs, have continued to be withheld; and our  
coasts, and the mouths of our harbors, have again witnessed scenes,  
not less derogatory to the dearest of our national rights, than vexa-  
tious to the regular course of our trade.  
  
Among the occurrences produced by the conduct of British ships  
of war hovering on our coasts, was an encounter between one of  
them, and the American frigate, commanded by captain Rodgers,  
  
_yendered unavoidable on the part of the latter, by a fire, commenced  
  
without cause, by the former; whose commander is, therefure, alone  
chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed in maintaining the  
honour of the American flag. The proceedings of a court of inquiry,  
requested by captain Rodgers, are communicated; together with  
the correspondence relating to the occurrence, between the secre-  
tary of state and his Britannic majesty’s envoy. To these are added,  
the several correspondences which have passed on the subject of  
the British orders in council; and to both, the correspondence re-  
lating to the Floridas, in which Congress will be made acquainted  
with the interposition which the government of Great Britain has  
  
~thought proper to make against the proceedings of the United  
States.  
  
The justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of  
the United States, towards France, both before and since the revo  
cation of her decrees, authorized an expectation that her govern-  
ment would have followed up that measure, by all such others as  
were due to our reasonable claims, as well as dictated by its ami-  
cable professions. No proof, however, is yet given, of an intention  
to repair the other wrongs done to the United States; and particu-  
larly to restore the great amount of American property seized and  
condemned under the edicts, which, though not affecting our neu-  
tral relations, and therefore not entering into questions between the  
United States and other belligerents, were nevertheless founded in  
such unjust principles, that the reparation ought to have been  
prompt and ample. 7  
  
In addition to this, and other demands of strict right, on that na-  
tion, the United States have much reason to be dissatisfied with the  
rigorous and unexpected restrictions, to which their trade with the  
French dominions has been subjected; and which, if not disconti

nued, will require at least corresponding restrictions on importa-  
tions from France into the United States. |  
  
On all those subjects, our minister plenipotentiary, lately sent to  
Paris, has carried with him the necessary instructions; the result of  
which, will be communicated to you, and by ascertaining the ulte-  
rior policy of the French government towards the United States,  
will enable you to adapt to it, that of the United States towards  
France.  
  
Our other foreign relations, remain without unfavourable  
changes. With Russia, they are on the best footing of friendship.  
The ports of Sweden have afforded proofs of friendly dispositions  
towards our commerce, in the councils of that nation also. And the  
information from our special minister to Denmark, shows that the  
mission had been attended with valuable effects to our citizens,  
whose property had been so extensively violated and endangered  
by cruizers under the Danish flag.  
  
Under the ominous indications which commanded attention, it  
became a duty to exert the means committed to the executive de-  
partment, in providing for the general security. ‘The works of de-  
fence on our maritime frontier have accordingly been prosecuted,  
with an activity leaving little to be added for the completion of the  
most important ones; and, as particularly suited for co-operation in  
emergencies, a portion of the gun-boats have, in particular harbours,  
been ordered into use. The ships of war before in commission,  
with the addition of a frigate, have been chiefly employed as a cruiz-  
ing guard to the rights of our coasts. And such a disposition has  
been made of our land forces, as was thought to promise the ser-  
vices most appropriate and important. In this disposition is included  
a force, consisting of regulars and militia, embodied in the Indiana  
territory, and marched towards our North Western frontier. This  
measure was made requisite by several murders and depredations  
committed by Indians; but more especially by the menacing pre-  
parations and aspect of a combination of them on the Wabash under  
the influence and direction of a fanatic of the Shawanese tribe. With  
these exceptions the Indian tribes retain their peaceable disposi-  
tions towards us, and their usual pursuits.  
  
I must now add, that the period is arrived, which claims from the  
legislative guardians of the national rights a system of more ample  
provisions for maintaining them. Notwithstanding the scrupulous  
justice, the protracted moderation, and the multiplied efforts on the  
part of the United States, to substitute, for the accumulating dan-  
gers to the peace of the two countries, all the mutual advantages  
of re-established friendship and confidence; we have seen that. the  
British cabinet perseveres, not only in withholding a remedy for  
other wrongs, so long and so loudly calling for it; but in the exe-  
cution, brought home to the threshhold of our territory, of measures  
which, under existing circumstances, have the character, as well as  
the effect, of war on our lawful commerce.  
  
With this evidence of hostile inflexibility, in trampling on rights

which no independent nation can relinquish, Congress will feel the  
duty of putting the United States into an armour, and an attitude  
demanded by the crisis, and corresponding with the national spirit  
and expectations.  
  
I recommend, accordingly, that adequate provision be made for  
filling the ranks and prolonging the enlistments of the regular  
troops; for an auxiliary force, to be engaged for a more limited  
term; for the acceptance of volunteer corps, whose patriotic ardor  
may court a participation in urgent services; for detachments, as  
they may be wanted, of other portions of the militia; and for  
such a preparation of the great body, as will proportion its useful-  
ness to its intrinsic capacities. Nor can the occasion fail to remind  
you of the importance of those military seminaries, which, in every  
event, will form a valuable and frugal part of our military establish-  
ment.  
  
The manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with  
due success; and the stock and resources of all the necessary muni-  
tlons are adequate to emergencies. It will not be inexpedient, how-  
ever, for Congress to authorize an enlargement of them.  
  
Your attention will of course be drawn to such provisions, on the  
subject of our naval force, as may be required for services to which  
it may be best adapted. I submit to Congress the seasonableness,  
also, of an authority to augment the stock of such materials, as are  
imperishable in their nature, or may not at once be attainable.  
  
In contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous  
epoch, and estimating their claims to our attention, it is impossible  
to overlook those developing themselves among the great commu-  
nities which occupy the southern portion of our own hemisphere,  
and extend into our neighbourhood. An enlarged philanthropy, and  
an enlightened forecast, concur in imposing on the national coun-  
cils an obligation to take a deep interest in their destinies; to che-  
rish reciprocal sentiments of good will; to regard the progress of  
events; and not to be unprepared for whatever order of things may  
be ultimately established.  
  
Under another aspect of our situation, the early attention of Con-  
gress will be due to the expediency of further guards against eva-  
sions and infractions of our commércial laws. The practice of  
smuggling, which is odious every where, and particularly criminal  
in free governments, where, the laws being made by all for the  
good of all, a fraud is committed on every individual as well as on  
the state, attains its utmost guilt, when it blends, with a pursuit  
of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency, in the transgres-  
sors, to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own country. It is  
then that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enabled  
to manifest itself, through the regular animadversions of the most  
competent laws.  
  
To secure greater respect to our mercantile flag, and to the  
honest Interest which it covers, it is expedient also, that it be made  
punishable in our citizens, to accept licenses from foreign govern

ments, for a trade unlawfully interdicted by them to other Ameri-  
can citizens; or to trade under false colours or papers of any sort.  
  
A prohibition is equally called for, against the acceptance, by our  
citizens, of special licenses, to be used in a trade with the United  
States; and against the admission into particular ports of the United  
States, of vessels from foreign countries, authorized to trade with  
particular ports only.  
  
Although other subjects will press more immediately on your  
deliberations, a portion of them cannot but be well bestowed on the  
just and sound policy of securing to our manufactures the success  
they have attained, and are still attaining, in some degree, under  
the impulse of causes not permanent; and to our navigation, the  
fair extent, of which it is at present abridged by the unequal regu-  
lations of foreign governments.  
  
Besides the reasonableness of saving our manufactures from sa-  
crifices which a change of circumstances might bring on them, the  
national interest requires, that, with respect to+such articles, at  
least, as belong to our defence, and our primary wants, we should  
not be left in unnecessary dependence on external supplies. And  
whilst foreign governments adhere to the existing discriminations  
in their ports against our navigation, and an equality or lesser dis-  
crimination is enjoyed by their navigation, in our ports, the effect  
cannot be mistaken, because it has been seriously felt by our ship-  
ping interest; and in proportion as this takes place, the advantages  
of an independent conveyance of our products to foreign markets,  
and of a growing body of mariners, trained by their occupations for  
the service of their country in times of danger, must be dimi-  
nished.  
  
The receipts into the treasury, during the year ending on the  
thirtieth of September last, have exceeded thirteen millions and a  
half of dollars, and have enabled us to defray the current expenses,  
including the interest on the public debt, and to reimburse more  
than five millions of dollars of the principal, without recurring to  
the loan authorized by the act of the last session. The temporary  
loan obtained in the latter end of the year one thousand eight hun-  
dred and ten, has also been reimbursed, and is not included in that  
amount.  
  
The decrease of revenue, arising from the situation of our com-  
merce and the extraordinary expenses which have and may become  
necessary, must be taken into view, in making commensurate pro-  
visions for the ensuing year. And I recommend to your conside-  
ration, the propriety of ensuring a sufficiency of annual revenue, at  
least to defray the ordinary expenses of government, and to pay  
the interest on the public debt, including that on new loans which  
may be authorized.  
  
I cannot close this communication without expressing my deep  
sense of the crisis in which you are assembled, my confidence in a  
wise and honourable result to your deliberations, and assurances of  
the faithful zeal with which my co-operating duties will be dis
