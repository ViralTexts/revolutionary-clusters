Sir,  
London, April 22. 1771  
I duly received your Favours of the 4th. of October and the 17th. of November. It gave me Pleasure to hear, that tho’ the Merchants had departed from their Agreement of Non-Importation, the Spirit of Industry and Frugality was likely to continue among the People. I am obliged to you for your Concern on my Account. The Letters you mention gave great Offence here; but that was not attended with the immediate ill Consequences to my Interest that seem to have been hoped for by those that sent Copies of them hither.  
If our Country People would well consider, that all they save in refusing to purchase foreign Gewgaws, and in making their own Apparel, being apply’d to the Improvement of their Plantations, would render those more profitable, as yielding a greater Produce, I should hope they would persist resolutely in their present commendable Industry and Frugality. And there is still a farther Consideration. The Colonies that produce Provisions grow very fast: But of the Countries that take off those Provisions, some do not increase at all, as the European Nations, and others, as the West India Colonies, not in the same proportion. So that tho’ the Demand at present may be sufficient, it cannot long continue so. Every Manufacturer encouraged in our Country, makes part of a Market for Provisions within ourselves, and saves so much Money to the Country as must otherwise be exported to pay for the Manufactures he supplies. Here in England it is well known and understood, that wherever a Manufacture is established which employs a Number of Hands, it raises the Value of Lands in the neighbouring Country all around it; partly by the greater Demand near at hand for the Produce of the Land; and partly from the Plenty of Money drawn by the Manufacturers to that Part of the Country. It seems therefore the Interest of all our Farmers and Owners of Lands, to encourage our young Manufactures in preference to foreign ones imported among us from distant Countries.  
I am much obliged by your kind Present of curious Seeds. They were welcome Gifts to some of my Friends. I send you herewith some of the new Barley lately introduced into the Country, and now highly spoken of. I wish it may be found of Use with us.  
I was the more pleas’d to see in your Letter the Improvement of our Paper, having had a principal Share in establishing that Manufacture among us many Years ago, by the Encouragement I gave it. If in any thing I can serve you here, it will be a Pleasure to Your obliged Friend and humble Servant

London, April 22d, 1771.  
  
Sir :—I duly received your favours of the 4th of October and the 17th of November.  
It gave me pleasure to bear, that though the merchants had departed from their agree-  
ment of non-importation, the spirit of industry and frugality was likely to continue among  
the people. I am obliged to you for your concern on my account. -The letters you men-  
tion gave great offence here; but that was not attended with the immediate ill-conse-  
quences to my interest that seem to have been hoped for by those that sent copies of  
them hither.  
  
If our country people would well consider, that all they save in refusing to purchase  
foreign gewgaws, and in making their own apparel, being applied to the improvement  
of their plantations, would render those more profitable, as yielding a greater produce, I  
should hope they would persist resolutely in their present commendable industry and  
frugality. And there is still a farther consideration. The colonies that produce pro-  
visions grow very fast. But of the countries that take off those provisions, some do not  
increase at all, as the European nations; and others, as the West India Colonies, not in  
the same proportion. So that though the demand at present may be sufficient, it cannot  
long continue so. Every manufacturer encouraged in our country, makes part of a  
market for provisions within ourselves, and saves so much money to the country as  
must otherwise be exported to pay for the manufactures hesupplies. Here, in England,  
it is well known and understood, that wherever a manufacture is established which  
employs a number of hands, it raises the value of lands in the neighbouring country all  
around it; partly by the greater demand near at hand for the produce of the land; and  
partly from the plenty of money drawn by the manufacturers to that part of the country.  
It seems, therefore, the interest of all our farmers and owners of lands, to encourage our  
young manufactures in preference to foreign ones imported among us from distant  
countries.  
  
I am much obliged by your kind present of curious seeds. They were welcome gifts  
to some of my friends. I send you herewith some of the new barley lately introduced  
into this country, and now highly spoken of. I wish it may be found of use with us.  
  
I was the more pleased to see in your letter the improvement of our paper, having  
had a principal share in establishing that manufacture among us many years ago, by  
the encouragement I gave it.

i.ondt on. April 22d, 1771   
SIB I-1 duly :received your favors of the

It gave me pleasure to hear,- that though the

was not ,attended with .the immediate ill­  
consequences, to mylnt-e, rest that seem. to   
have been hOped or by&#x27; those that sentcopies

If.ou r eon nt ry people would well consider.   
that all they save in refusing to purahase   
foreign gewgaws, and in making their own   
apparel, being applied to the improvement   
of their plantations, would tender those more   
, profitable. as Yielding a greater produce, I   
should hope:they. would persist resolutelY in   
their present commeudable industry and fru­

not long con nue.so. Every manufae,urer.

market for provr. &#x27;ons within ourselves, add   
and saves so much money to the country as   
must otherivise be evoried&quot; to pay foi the   
tirinufactures he supplies., Here in England&#x27;   
is well knbwn and undkrstocal, that where­

toys a nimlber of hands, it ises the value

, ear at hand for the produce o the land;   
and partly from the plenty of &#x27;none, drawn   
to that part of the couutry. It (Tins,   
therefore tlte interest of all our fa erl,   
to encoura;:r,e our young manufactures in

If our Country Feople would well consider  
that ail they save in refusiug to purchase for­

applyeu to the Improvement of their Plantations,  
would render those more profitable, as yielding

persist resolutely in their present oc.-mendalle

Countries !bt take off those Rrovisions aorae  
; Jo not increase at ail, the European Nations;  
&#x27; and others, as the West India Colonies, not in  
the same proportion. So that though the Le­  
uiand at present may be sufficient, it cannot  
long continue so. Every Manufacturer encour­  
aged iu our Country mikes part of u Market  
for Provisions witLia ourselves, and saves so  
much Money to tbe Country as must other wily  
be exported to pay For the Manufactures he sup­

tablished which employs a Number tji&#x27; Hands,  
it raises ihe Vraiue of Lands in tbe neighbor­  
ing Country ali around it; partly by &#x27;be great­  
er Deniaud near at hand for the Produce of the  
Land, aud partly from tiro Plenty of Money  
drawn by the Manufacturers to that Part of tbo

toulion, April 22, MI.   
Soh : duly reatfted your favors of the 4th of   
October and the 17th of November. It gave me   
pleasurb to hear that, though the merchants had   
departed&#x27; front their agreemont of non-importation,   
the spirit of industry and frugality was likely to   
&#x27;continue among the pimple. I amohliged to you   
for your condom on m 3/. account. Tho lettere you   
ihention gavo great offence hero; but that was   
not attended with the immediate ill consequences   
to my interest that seemod to have boon hoped for   
by those that sent copies of Limn hither&#x27;.   
If Our colontrY people wind bonoider that   
alt they saVe in refusing to purchase foreign gew­  
gaws, and in making their own apparel, being ap­  
plied to the improvement of their plantations   
would rondor those more profitable, as yielding a   
greater produce, I should hope they would per­  
sist .rosolutoly In their present cOmmendablo in­  
dustry and frugdlity. .And there is still a ftirthor   
osnsideration : The colonies that produce pro•   
visions grow vary fast; but, of the countries that   
tako off those provisions, some do not increase at   
all, as the European nations ; and others, as the   
IVott India colonies, not in the moo proportion ;   
so that, though the demand at Presont may ho oaf­  
&amp;dont, it cannot long continuo no. Every manu­  
facturer enoodraglid In Our country makes part of   
a market for provisione within oonrsolves, and   
saves so much money to the country de mist other­  
wise be exported to pay tor the mannfaobiros be   
supplies. Here, in Dingland, it to well known rind   
undorstooci that, Wherevet. a Manufacture Is estab­  
lished which oruploys a number of hands, it raises   
the value of lands in the neighboring country all   
around it; partly by the greater demand near at   
band for the produce of the land, and partly from   
the plenty of money drawn by the manufacturers   
to that part of the country. It seams, therefore,   
the interest of all our farmers and owners of lands   
to encourage our young manufactures in prefer­  
ence to foreign ones imported among uto from dis­  
tant countries.   
I am obliged by your kind present of curious   
seeds. They were welcome gifts to some of my   
friends, I send you, herewith, scone of the now   
barley lately introduced into this country, and   
now highly spoken of. I wish it may be found of   
use with us.   
I woe the more pleased to eon in your lottor tiro   
improvement, of our, ippon having had a principal   
share in establishing that manufnoturo among us,

‘It seems, therefore, the interest of all our farmers and |

Franklin sought not teow discord between the

them in no antagonistical position, as the free |  
traders are in the habit of doing. He knew that |

Lonpon, April 22, 1771.  
SIR,  
  
I duly received your Favours of the 4th of October and  
the 17th of November. It gave me Pleasure to hear that tho’  
the Merchants had departed from their Agreement of Non-Im-  
portation, the Spirit of Industry and Frugality was likely to  
continue among the People. I am obliged to you for your Con-  
cern on my Account. The letters you mention gave great Offence  
here; but that was not attended with the immediate ill Conse-  
quences to my Interest that seem to have been hoped for by those  
that sent Copies of them hither.  
  
If our Country People would well consider, that all they save  
in refusing to purchase foreign Gewgaws, &amp; in making their own  
Apparel, being apply’d to the Improvement of their Plantations,  
would render those more profitable, as yielding a greater Produce,  
I should hope they would persist resolutely in their present com-  
mendable Industry and Frugality. And there is still a farther  
Consideration. The Colonies that produce Provisions grow very  
fast: But of the Countries that take off those Provisions, some  
do not increase at all, as the European Nations; and others, as  
the West India Colonies, not in the same proportion. So that  
tho’ the Demand at present may be sufficient, it cannot long con-  
tinue so. Every Manufacturer encouraged in our Country,  
makes part of a Market for Provisions within ourselves, and  
saves so much Money to the Country as must otherwise be  
exported to pay for the Manufactures he supplies. Here in  
England it is well known and understood, that wherever a  
Manufacture is established which employs a Number of Hands, it  
raises the Value of Lands in the neighboring Country all around  
it; partly by the greater Demand near at hand for the Produce  
of the Land, and partly from the Plenty of Money drawn by  
the Manufacturers to that Part of the Country. It seems  
terefore the interest of all our Farmers and Owners of Lands,  
to encourage our young Manufactures in preference to foreign  
ones imported among us from distant countries.  
  
* * * * ~  
  
  
  
78 The Penn Monthly. [ Feb.  
  
I was the more pleas’d to see in your Letter the Improvement  
of our Paper, having had a principal Share‘in establishing that  
Manufacture among us many Years ago, by the Encouragement  
I gave it.  
  
If in anything I can serve you here, it will be a pleasure to  
  
Your obliged Friend  
and humble Servant,

London, April 22, 1771.  
Sir,  
I duly received your Favours of the  
4lh of October and the Kith of Novem­  
ber. It gave me Pleasure to hear, that  
tho’ the Merchants had departed from  
their Agreement of Non-Importation,  
the Spirit of Industry and Frugality  
was likely to continue among the Peo­  
ple.—l am obliged to you for your Con­  
cern on my Account. The Letters you  
mention gave great Offence here ; but  
that was not attended with the imme­  
diate ill Consequences to my Interest  
that seem to have lieen hoped Tor by  
those that sent Copies of them hither.  
If our Country People would well  
consider, that all the}&#x27; save iu refusing  
to purchase foreign Gewgaws, &amp; in  
making their own Apparel, being ap­  
ply&#x27;d to the Improvement of their Plan­  
tations, would render those more profit­  
able, as yielding a greater Produce, I  
should hope they would persist reso­  
lutely in their present commendable  
Industry and Frugality.—And there is  
still a farther Consideration. The Col­  
onies that produce Provisions grow very  
fast: But of the Countries that take  
off those Provisions, some do not in­  
crease at all, as the European Nations;  
and others, as the West Indian Colon­  
ies, not in the same proportion. So  
that tho&#x27;the Demand at present may be  
sufficient, it cannot long continue so.—  
Every Manufacturer encouraged in our  
Country, makes part of a Market for  
Provisions within ourselves, and saves  
so much Money to the Country as must  
otherwise be exported to pay for tho  
Manufactures ho supplies. Here in  
England it is wellknown and under­  
stood, that whereever a Manufacture is  
established which employs a Number of  
Hands, it raises ihe Value of Lands in  
the neighboring Country all around it;  
partly by the greater Demand near at  
hand for the Produce of the Land ; anil  
partly from the Plenty of Money drawn  
by the Manufacturers to that part of  
the Country. It seems therefore the  
Interest of all our Farmers and Owners  
of Lands, to encourage our young Man­  
ufacturers in preference to foreign ones  
imported among us from distant Coun­  
tries.  
I am much obliged by your kind  
Present of curious Seeds. They were  
welcome Gifts to some of my Friends.  
I send you herewith some of the new  
Barley lately introduced into this Coun­  
try, &amp; now highly spoken of. I wish  
it may be found of Use with us.  
I was the more pleas&#x27;d to see in your  
Letter the Improvement of our Paper,  
having had a principal Share in estab­  
lishing that Manufacture among us  
many Years ago, by the Encouragement  
I gave it.  
If in anything I can serve you hero,  
it will lie a Pleasure to

Lonpon, April 22, 1771.—Sir :—I duly re-  
ceived your favors of the 4th of October  
and the 17th of November. It gave me  
pleasure to hear that, though the merchants  
had departed from their agreement of non-  
importation, the spirit of industry and fru-  
gality was likely to continue among the  
people. Iam obliged to you for your con-  
cern on my account. The letters you men-  
tion gave great offence here; but that was  
not attended with immediate ill consequences  
to my interest that seem to have been  
hoped for by those that sent copies of them  
hither.  
  
If our country people would well consider,  
that all they save in refusing to purchase  
foreign gew-gaws, &amp;c., in making their own  
apparel, being ap plied | to the improvement  
of their plantations, would render those  
more profitable, as yielding a greater pro-  
duce, I should hope that they would persist  
resolutely in their commendable industry  
and frugality. And there is still a further  
consideration. The colonies that produce  
provisions grow very fast ; but of the coun-  
tries that take off those provisions, some do  
not increase at all, as the European nations ;  
and others as the West India colonies, not  
in the same proportion. So that, though  
the demand at present may be sufficient, it  
cannot long continue so. Every manufac-  
turer encouraged in our country, makes part

it is well known and understood, that

all around it ; partly by the greater demand  
near at hand for the produce of the land  
and partly from the plenty of money drawn

terest of all our farmers and owners of lands,  
to encourage our young manufactures in  
preference to foreign ones imported among  
us from distant countries. I am much  
obliged by your kind present of curious  
seeds. They were welcome gifts to some of  
my friends. I send you herewith some of  
the new barley introduced into this country,  
and now highly spoken of. I wish it may  
be found of use with us. I was the more  
pleased to see in your letter the improve-  
ment of our paper, having had a principal  
share in establishing that manufacture  
among us many years ago, by the encour-  
agement I gave it.

hear, that tho&#x27; the Merchants had de  
parted from their Agreement of Non  
Importation, the Spirit of Industry and  
&#x27;Frugality was likely to continue among  
the People. I am obliged to you for

here t&#x27;Dut that was not attended with  
the immediato ill Consequences to my  
Interest .that seem to have, been hoped  
for by those that sent Copies of them  
hither.  
In our Country People would well  
consider that all they save in refusing  
to purchase ioreign uewgaws, &amp; in  
maKing tneir own Apparel, being ap

Plantations, would render thoso more  
profitable, as yieldinu a creater Pro-  
dace, I should hope they would persist  
resoiuteiy in their present comiuemla  
Lie Industry and Frugality. And  
there is still a farther Consideration.  
The Colonies that produce Provisions  
grow very fast : But of the Countries  
that take off those Provisions, some do  
not increase at all, as tho European  
jNaiions ; and others, as tho West In  
dia Colonies, not in the same proportion,  
oo that tho&#x27; the Demand at present  
may oe sumcient, it cannot long con  
tfnue bo Every Manufacturer enoour  
acred in our Countrv. makes nart of i  
Market for Provisions within ourselves,  
and saves so much Money to pay for  
the Manufactures ho supplies. Hero  
in England it is well-known and un  
derstood, that wherever a Manufaoturo  
is established which employ a Number  
ot nanus, it raises tho value ot lianas  
in the neiuhborlriir Countrv all around  
it i partly by the greater Demand near  
at nana tor tho 1&#x27;roduce of tho Land  
and partly from the Plenty of Money  
drawn by tbo Manufactures to that  
part ot the Couutry. it seems therefore  
tho Interest of all our Farmers and  
Owners of Lands, to encourago tho  
young Manufactures in preference to  
auruigu uiics imported among us irom  
distant Countries.  
I am much obliged by your kind  
Present of curious Seeds. Thoy wore

provisions within ourselves, and saves  
so much money to the country as must  
otherwise be exported to pay for the  
manufactures he supplies. Here in

established which employs a number of

the neighbourhood all around it. It is,  
therefore, the deep interest of our

o carefully examine it  
will not fail to detect some very prominent  
and unmistakable ear-marks. Mr. Donnell  
asserts that &quot;in 1783 when the American  
commissioners, Franklin, Adams, and Jay,  
met the English commissioner to make a  
commercial treaty between the two coun­  
tries, one of the first propositions submitted  
by the Americans was mutual uncondi­  
tional free trade.&quot; Now, Mr. Editor, when  
Mr. Donnell made that statement it is fair  
to presume that he had not seen the letter  
by Benjamin Franklin to Humphrey Mar­  
shall, dated &quot;London, April 22, 1771,&quot; in  
which, among other things, Franklin says:  
If our country people would well consider  
that all they save in refusing to purchase for­  
eign gewgaws and in making their own ap­  
parel, being applied to the improvement of  
their plantations, would render these more  
profitable as yielding a greater produce, I  
should hope they would persist resolutely in  
their present commendable industry and fru­  
gality. And there is still a further considera­  
tion, the colonies that produce provisions grow  
very fast. But of the countries that take off  
those provisions, some do not increase at all,  
as the European nations and others, as the  
West India colonies, not in the same propor­  
tion. So that though the demand may at pres-  
ent be sufficient it cannot long continue so.  
Every manufacturer encouraged in our country  
makes part of a market for provisions within  
ourselves, and saves so much money to the  
country as must ofnerwise be exported to pay  
for the manufactures he supplies. Here, in  
England, it is well known and uinderstood that  
whenever a manufacture is established which  
employs a number of hands it raises the value  
of lands in the neighboring country all around  
it, partly by the greater demand near at hand  
for the produce of the land, and partly by the  
plenty of money drawn by the manufacturers  
to that part of the country. It seems, there­  
fore, the interest of all farmers and owners of  
lands to encourage our young manufactures in  
preference to foreign ones imported among us  
from distant countries.  
This does not look much as if Franklin  
was in favor of free trade. In another part  
of the same letter he more than intimates  
that he is in favor of non-importation. A  
few years later Thomas Jefferson is credited  
with saying that &quot;it would be better for  
this country if the Atlantic was an impass­  
able gulf of fire.&quot; But whether he said it  
or not one thing is certain, and that is that  
there is no government on earth so well able  
to live prosperously within itself as the  
United States. No other country has suc

preference to foroign ones, if we ever  
wish to grow in wealth and greatness.

home market and saves so much money

that whenever a manufactory 14 estab

“Lonpon, April 22, 1771.  
“ Sir,  
*‘T duly received your Favours of the 4&quot; of October and  
  
the 17&quot; of November. It gave me Pleasure to hear, that |  
  
tho’ the Merchants had departed from their Agreement of  
Non-Importation, the Spirit of Industry and Frugality was  
likely to continue among the People. I am obliged to you  
for your Concern on my Account. The Letters you men-  
tion gave great Offence here; but that was not attended  
with the immediate ill Consequences to my Interest that  
seem to have been hoped for by those that sent Copies of  
them hither.  
  
“Tf our Country People would well consider, that all they  
save in refusing to purchase foreign Gewgaws, &amp; in making  
their own Apparel, being apply’d to the Improvement of  
their Plantations, would render those.more profitable, as  
yielding a greater Produce, I should hope they would  
persist resolutely in their present commendable Industry  
and Frugality. And there is still a farther Consideration.  
The Colonies that produce Provisions grow very fast. But  
of the Countries that take off those Provisions, some do not  
increase at all, as the European Nations; and others, as the  
West India Colonies, not in the same proportion. So that  
tho’ the Demand at present may be sufficient, it cannot long  
continue so. Every Manufacturer encouraged in our Coun-  
try, makes part of a Market for Provisions within ourselves,  
and saves so much Money to the Country as must otherwise

be exported to pay for the Manufactures he supplies. Here  
in England it is well known and understood, that where  
ever a Manufacture is established which employs a Number  
of Hands, it raises the Value of Lands in the neighbouring  
Country all around it; partly by the greater Demand near  
at hand for the Produce of the Land; and partly from the  
Plenty of Money drawn by the Manufacturers to that Part  
of the Country. It seems therefore the Interest of all our  
Farmers and Owners of Lands, to encourage our young  
Manufactures in preference to foreign ones imported among  
us from distant Countries.  
  
“T am much obliged by your kind Present of curious  
Seeds. They were welcome Gifts to some of my Friends.  
—I send you herewith some of the new Barley lately intro-  
duced into this Country, &amp; now highly spoken of. I wish  
it may be found of use with us.—  
  
“T was the more pleas’d to see in your Letter the Im-  
provement of our Paper, having had a principal Share in  
establishing that Manufacture among us many Years ago,  
by the Encouragement I gave it.—  
  
“ Tfin anything I can serve you here, it will be a Pleasure to
