Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives  
[New York, 30 April 1789]  
  
  
  
Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the fourteenth day of the present month. On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years: a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my Country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens, a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence, one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration, ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I  
  
dare aver, is, that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance, by which it might be affected. All I dare hope, is, that, if in executing this task I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof, of the confidence of my fellow-citizens; and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me; my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me, and its consequences be judged by my Country, with some share of the partiality in which they originated.  
Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station; it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official Act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe, who presides in the Councils of Nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the People of the United States, a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes: and may enable every instrument employed in its administration, to execute with success, the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of my fellow-citizens at large, less than either: No People can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand, which conducts the Affairs of men more than the People of the United States. Every step, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency. And in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their United Government, the tranquil deliberations, and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities, from which the event has resulted, cannot be compared with the means by which most Governments have been established, without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join me I  
  
trust in thinking, that there are none under the influence of which, the proceedings of a new and free Government can more auspiciously commence.  
By the article establishing the Executive Department, it is made the duty of the President “to recommend to your consideration, such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” The circumstances under which I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that subject, farther than to refer to the Great Constitutional Charter under which you are assembled; and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications, I behold the surest pledges, that as on one side, no local prejudices, or attachments; no seperate views, nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great Assemblage of communities and interests: so, on another, that the foundations of our national policy, will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality; and the pre-eminence of free Government, be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its Citizens, and command the respect of the world. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my Country can inspire: since there is no truth more thoroughly established, than that there exists in the œconomy and course of nature, an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness, between duty and advantage, between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy, and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity: Since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven, can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven itself has ordained: And since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of Government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.  
  
Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide, how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the Fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the System, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunites, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good: For I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an United and effective Government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience; a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen, and a regard for the public harmony, will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified, or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.  
To the preceding observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself; and will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honoured with a call into the service of my Country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departed—And being still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myself, any share in the personal emoluments, which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the Executive Department; and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the Station in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.  
Having thus imparted to you my sentiments, as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the human race, in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favour the American people, with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility, and  
  
dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a form of Government, for the security of their Union, and the advancement of their happiness; so this divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views—the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.  
  
Go: Washington.

By the article eftablifhing the Executive Depart-  
ment, it is made the duty of the Prefident ‘* to recom-  
mend to your confideration, fuch meafures as ke fhall  
judge neceflary and expedient.” The circumftahces  
under which I now meet you, will acquit me from en-  
tering into that fubje® farther than to refer to the  
Great Conftitutional Charter under which we are af-  
fembled ; and which, in defining your powers, defig-  
nates the obje¢ts to which your attention is to be given.  
It will be more confiftent with thofe circumftances,  
and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate  
me, to fubftitute in place of a recommendation of par-  
ticular meafures, the tribute that is due to the talents,  
the re&amp;titude, and the patriotifm which adorn the cha-  
racters felected to devife and adopt them. In thefe  
honourable qualifications, I behold the fureft pledges,  
that as on one fide, no loeal prejudices or attachments,  
no feparate views nor party animofitics, will mifdirect  
the comprehenfive and equal eye which ought to watch  
over this great aflemblage of communities and interetts ;  
fo, on another, that the foundations of our national  
policy will be laid in the pure and immutable princi-  
ples of private morality ; and the pre-eminence of a  
free government be exemplified by all the attributes  
which can win the affections of its citizens, and com-  
mand the refpeé of the world.  
  
I dwell on this profpect with every fatisfaGion  
which an ardent love for my country can infpire ; fince  
there is no truth more thoroughly eftablithed, than that  
there exifts in the economy and courfe of nature, an in-  
diffuluble union between virtue &amp; happinefs—between  
duty &amp; advantage—between the genuine maxims of an  
honeft and magnanimous policy, and the folid rewards  
of publick profperity and felicity. Since we ought  
to be no lefs perfuaded that the propitious {miles of  
Heaven can never be expeéted on a nation.that difre-  
gards the eternal rules of order and right, which Hea-  
ven itfelf has ordained.—And fince the prefervation of  
the facred fire of liberty, and the deftiny of the re-  
publican model of government, are juftly confidered as  
deeply, perhaps as finally ftaked, on the experiment in-  
truited to the hands of the American people.  
  
  
  
Befides the ordinary obje&amp;s fubmitted to your care,  
it will remain with your judgment to decide how far  
an exercife of the occafional power delegated by the  
Fifth Article of the Conftitution is rendered expedient  
at the prefent juncture by the nature of objections which

the permanent policy of the country, and as  
connected with the important trust reposed in  
the preservation of liberty here, and of our influence  
as a beacon light for the guidance of the  
family of man.  
How exalted and how reverential was his  
estimate of the boon our fathers won! It  
was blended with every religious conviction  
and emotion of his nature. &quot;No people,&quot; he  
declared in the Inaugural we have quoted,

past seems to presage.&quot;

When clouds. obscure the present, there is  
  
tastes of his countrymen, the &quot;model republic&quot;

THE SuN, THuRSDaY, MArCH 5, 1888.  
  
Inaugural Addresses  
HoH eacH President has vinw  
mis duties and responsinilii  
 President Washington Filled with Grent  
 Anxiety as to his Fitneas for the offes  
ceorce fushington&#x27;s First Inaugural Address  
90, 1780.  
Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no  
vent could have filled me with greater anxie  
ties than that of which the notification was  
transmitted and received on the 14th day of the  
present month. On the one hand, I was sum­  
moned by my country, whose voice I can never  
hear but with veneration and love, from a re­  
treat which I had chosan with the fondest pre  
dilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an  
  
immutable decision, as the asylum of my de­  
clining years--a retreat which was rendered  
every day more necessary as woll as more dear  
to me by the addition of habit to inclination  
and of frequent interruptions in my health  
to the gradual waste committed on it  
by time. On the other hand, the magnitude  
and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of  
my country called me, being sufficient to  
awaken in the wisest and most experienced of  
her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his  
qual ifleations, could not but overwhelm with  
despondence one who, inheriting inferior en­  
dowments from nature, and unpractised in the  
duties of civil administration, ought to be pe  
culiarly conscious of his own deficiencies. All  
I dare hope is that if, in accepting this task, I  
have been too much swayed by a grateful re  
membrance of former instances, or by an affec  
tionate sensibility to this transcendent proof  
of the confidence of my fellow citizens, and  
have thence too little consulted my incapacity  
as well as disinclination for the weighty and  
untried cares before me, my error will be pal  
liated by the motives which misled me, and its  
consequences be judged by my country with  
some share of the partiality with which they  
originated

&quot;Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no  
event could have tilled me with greater anxie­  
ties than that of which the notification was  
transmitted by your order, and received on the  
14th day of the present month. On the one  
hand, I was summoned by my country, whose  
voice I can never hear but with veneration and  
love, from a retreat which I had chosen with  
the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering  
OLD FED  
hopes, with an immutable decision as the asy­  
lum of my declining years?a retreat which  
was rendered every day more necessary, as  
well as more dear to me, by the addition of  
habit to inclination, and of frequent interrup­  
tions in my health to the gradual waste com­  
mitted on it by time.  
On the other hand, the magnitude and dif­  
ficulty of the trust to which the voice of my  
country called me. being sufficient to awaken  
in the wisest and most experienced of her citi­  
zens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifica­  
tions, could not but overwhelm with despon­  
dence one who, inheriting inferior endowments  
from nature, and unpracticed in the duties of  
civil administration, ought to be peculiarly  
conscious of his own deficiencies. In this con­  
flict of emotions, all 1 dare aver is that it has  
been my faithful study to collect my duty from  
a Just appreciation of every circumstance by  
which it might be affected. All I dare hope is,  
that if in accepting this task, I have been too  
much swayed by a remembrance of former in­  
stances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this  
transcendent proof of the confidence of my  
fellow-citizens, and have thence too little con­  
sulted my incapacity as well as disinclina­  
tion for the weighty and nntried cares before  
me, my error will be palliated by the motives  
which misled me, and its consequences be  
judged by my country with some share of the  
partiality in which they originated. Such  
being the impressions under which I have  
in obedience to the publio summons repaired  
to the present station, it will be peculiarly  
improper to omit in this first official act my  
fervent supplications to that Almighty Being  
who roles over the universe, who presides in  
the councils of nations, and whose providential  
aids can supply every human defect, that His  
benediction may consecrate to the liberties  
and happiness of the people of the United  
Statee, a government instituted by themselves  
for these essential purposes, and may enable  
every instrument employed in its administra­  
tion, to execute with success the function ai­  
  
lotted to its charge. In tendering this homage  
to tie great author of every public and private  
good. I assure myself that it express* * your

eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained.”

an honest and magnanimous policy  
and the solid rewards of public pros­  
perity and felicity.—George Washing­  
ton, in his first inaugural address.
