y of the whole.  
The facts of the case, which must decide its true character, a character without a prototype, are, that the  
Constitution was created by the people, but by the people as composing distinct States, and acting by a majority in each:  
that being derived from the same source as the Constitutions of the States, it has within each State, the same authority  
as the Constitution of the State, and is as much a Constitution in the strict sense of the term, as the Constitution of  
the State: that being a Compact among the States in their highest sovereign capacity, and constituting the people thereof  
one people for certain purposes, it is not revocable or alterable at the will of the States individually, as the  
Constitution of a State is revocable and alterable at its individual will: that the sovereign or supreme powers of the  
Government are divided into the separate depositories of the Government of the United States, and the Governments of the  
Individual States: that the Government of the United States is a Government in as strict a sense of the term, as the  
Governments of the States; being like them, organized into a Legislative, Executive and Judiciary Department, operating  
like them, directly on persons and things, and having like them, the command of a physical force for executing the powers  
committed to it: that the Supreme powers of Government being divided between different Governments, and controversies as  
to the landmarks of jurisdiction, being unavoidable; provision for a peaceable and authoritative decision of them was  
obviously essential: that to leave this decision to the States, numerous as they are in with a prospective increase, would  
evidently result in conflicting decisions, subversive of the Common Government and of the Union itself: that according to  
the actual provision against such calamities, the Constitution &amp; laws of the United States are declared to be  
paramount to those of the Individual States, and an appellate supremacy is vested in the Judicial power of the United  
States: that as safeguards against usurpations and abuses of power by the Government of the United States, the members of  
its Legislative and the head of its Executive Department, are eligible by and responsible to the people of the States, or  
the Legislatures of the States; and as well the Judicial, as the Executive functionaries including the Head, are  
impeachable by the Representatives of the people in one branch of the Legislature of the United States, and triable by the  
Representatives of the States in the other branch: that in case of an experienced inadequacy of these provisions, an  
ulterior resort is provided in amendments attainable by an intervention of the States, which may better adapt the  
Constitution for the purposes of its creation:  
Should all these provisions fail, and a degree of oppression ensue, rendering resistance and revolution a  
lesser evil than a longer passive obedience, there can remain but the ultima ratio, applicable to extreme cases, whether  
between nations, or the component parts of them.  
Such, Sir, I take to be an outline view, tho’ an imperfect one, of the political system presented in the  
Constitution of the United States. Whether it be

*hU momentous subject. The folio wing extracts  
from a letter just received from this venerable  
miu, will set this in a clear light. In this letter  
Mr. Madison sketches what he denominates ».*&gt;n  
outline view of the political system presented in  
the Constitution of the United States.’ After  
several other statements, he remarks—  
•That, being derived from the same source as  
the Constitution of the States, it hits, ..ithineach  
jtare. the same authority as the Constitution of  
;!e State: and is much a Con* i‘ulL&gt;n. in the  
»&#x27;rirt sense of the term, as fK* Constitution of  
Hie State: That being a compact among the  
&#x27;fates in their highest sovereign capacity, and  
lonstituting the people thereof one j.eople, for  
(• .taiu purposes, it i&#x27; not revocable,or alterable,  
.it the will of the Sta’es, individually, as the  
&lt;‘i&gt;!is&#x27;ituiion of the rotate is rev /cable, or altera­  
i&gt;&#x27;e. at its individual will: That the sovereign,  
. r supreme powers of the Government, are di­  
vided into the separate depositories of the Gov­  
-inuiiMit of the l nited States, and the Govern­  
mentsof the individual States: I hat i.ieGovern­  
ment of the United States is a Government in as  
&#x27;*rict a sense of the term, as the Governments  
&quot;f the States—operating, lue them, directly on  
persons atid things, ike-: That the sup une pow­  
er being ilivided between different Governments,  
itt.l controversies as to the land-marks &lt;»| juris­  
Jici &gt;n being unavoidable, provision for a peace­  
able and authoritative decisi&#x27;m of ihem, was ob­  
viously essential: That to leave this&#x27;decision to  
•in* Stales, would evidently result in conflicting  
decisions, subversive of the common Govern­  
ment, and of the Union itself: That, according  
:&gt; &#x27;he actlial provision against such caiamiti-s,

Tho Charleston Courier contains extracts of J

venerable statesman holds, concerning the Fede  
ral constitution, tins important ana orthodox  
anMiae:  
Tiiat bein? derived from the same source as

each State, tho same authority as the Constitution  
of the Siaie ; and hi ns much a Constitution in the

reign, or suprome powers of tho Government,  
are divided into the separate depositories of the  
Government of the United States, and the Go­  
vernment of the individual States. That the Go­  
vernment of the United Slates is a Government  
in as strict a sense of tho term, as tho Government  
of the States opcrntint&#x27;,1ike them, directly on

power being divided between diilcrent Govern­  
ments, and controversies as to the landmarks of
