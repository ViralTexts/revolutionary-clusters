 I would never wish that it should be placed on a worse footing than the rest of the state. but if it is beleived that these elementary schools will be better managed by the Governor &amp; council, the Commissioners of the literary fund, or any other general authority of the government, than by the parents within each ward, it is a belief against all experience. try the principle one step further, and amend the bill so as to commit to the Governor &amp; Council the management of all our farms, our mills, &amp; merchants’ stores.No, my friend, the way to have good and safe government, is not to trust it all to one; but to divide it among the many, distributing to every one exactly the functions he is competent to. let the National government be entrusted with the defence of the nation, and it’s foreign &amp; federal relations; the State governments with the civil rights, laws, police &amp; administration of what concerns the state generally; the Counties with the local concerns of the counties; and the Wards  each Ward direct the interests within itself. it is by dividing and subdividing these republics from the great National one down thro’ all it’s subordinations, until it ends in the administration of every man’s farm and affairs by himself; by placing under every one what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the best. what has destroyed liberty and the rights of man in every government which has ever existed under the sun? the generalising &amp;  concentrating all cares and powers into one body, no matter whether of the Autocrats of Russia or France, or of the Aristocrats of a Venetian Senate.and I do believe that if the Almighty has not decreed that Man shall never be free, (and it is  blasphemy to believe it) that the secret will be found to be in the making himself the depository of the powers respecting himself, so far as he is competent to them, and delegating only what is beyond his competence by a synthetical process, to higher &amp; higher orders of functionaries, so as to trust fewer and fewer powers, in proportion as the trustees become more and more oligarchical.the elementary republics of the wards, the county republics, the State republics, and the republic of the Union, would form a gradation of authorities, standing each on the basis of law, holding every one it’s delegated share of powers, and constituting truly a system of fundamental balances and checks for the government. where every man is a sharer in the direction of his ward-republic, or of some of the higher ones, and feels that he is a participator in the government of affairs not merely at an election, one day in the year, but every day; when there shall not be a man in the state who will not be a member of some one of it’s councils, great or small, he will let the heart be torn out of his body sooner than his power be wrested from him by a Caesar or a Bonaparte. how powerfully did we feel the energy of this organisation in the case of the Embargo? I felt the foundations of the government shaken under my feet by the New England townships. there was not an individual in their states whose body was not thrown, with all it’s momentum, into action, and altho’ the whole of the other states were known to be in favor of the measure, yet the organisation of this little selfish minority enabled it to overrule the Union. what could the unwieldy counties of the middle, the South and the West do? call a county meeting, and the drunken loungers at and about the Court houses would have collected, the distances being too great for the good people and the industrious generally to attend. the character of those who really met would have been the measure of the weight they would have had in the scale of public opinion. as Cato then concluded every speech with the words ‘Carthago delenda est,’ so do I every opinion with the injunction ‘divide the counties into wards.’ begin them only for a single purpose; they will soon shew for what others they are the best instruments.

thus of the great Virginia statesman&#x27;s  
tribute to the value of the New England  
township system:  
The inference which Jefferson drew from  
the power of New England in finally break­  
ing down the embargo is worthy of note.  
Hs attrihuted it to the township system,  
which he valued most highly, and strove  
long to introduce into VirginlaHo

subject—local incorporation for schools—he remarks: ‘* Where  
every man is a sharer in the direction of his ward-republic [e. g.  
school district or township] or of some of the higher ones, and  
feels that he is a participator in the government of affairs, not  
merely at an election one day in the year, but every day; when  
there shall not be a man in the State who will not be a member of  
some one of its councils, great or small, he will let the heart be  
torn out of his body sooner than [allow] his power [to} be wrested  
from him by a Cesar or a Bonaparte. How powerfully did we  
feel the energy of this organization in the case of the embargo. I  
felt the foundations of the government shaken under my feet by  
the New England townships. There was not an individual in their  
States whose body was not thrown with all its momentum into  
action; and although the whole of the other States were known to  
be in favor of the measure, yet the organization of this little selfish  
minority enabled it to overrule the Union. What would the un-  
wieldy counties of the middle, the south and the west do? Calla  
county meeting, and the drunken loungers at and about the court  
houses would have collected, the distances being too great for the  
good people and the industrious generally to attend. The character  
of those who really met would have been the measure of the weight  
they would have had in the scale of public opinion. As Cato, then,  
concluded every speech with the words, ‘Carthago deleada est,”  
so do I every opinion, with the injunction, ‘divide the counties  
into wards.’ Begin them only for a single purpose ; they will soon  
show for what others they are the best instruments.”

But if the interest of New England in a  
proposed Federal law is clear, the whole  
population is alive to it, and presses for it  
in a united mass. It was of this strong  
united power of the townsmen of the State  
in which there was not a citizen not a  
‘*‘member of some one of its councils,  
great or’small,” that Thomas Jefferson  
spoke in the much-quoted passage from  
his letter to Mr. Cabell.  
  
‘* How powerfully,” he wrote, ‘‘did we  
feel the energy of this organization in the  
case of embargo! I felt the foundations  
of government shaken under my feet by  
the New England townships. There was  
not an individual in these States whose  
body was not thrown with all its mo  
mentum intoaction; and though the whole  
of the other States were known to be in  
favor of the measure, yet the organization  
of this little selfish minority enabled it to  
overrule the Union. What would the  
unwieldy counties of the Middle, the  
South, and the West do? Call a county  
meeting; and the drunken loungers at and  
about the court-houses would have col-  
lected, the distances being too great for the  
good people and the industrious generally  
to attend.... £ As Cato, then, concluded  
every speech with the words, Delenda est  
Carthago, so do I every opinion with  
the injunction, ‘ Divide the counties into  
wards.’”

fewer powers in proportion as the trustees become more and more oli-  
garchical. The elementary republics of the wards, the county republics,  
the state republics and the republic of the Union would form a gradation  
of authorities, standing each on the basis of law, holding every one its  
delegated share of powers, and constituting truly a system of funda-  
mental balances and checks for the government. Where every man is  
a sharer in the direction of his ward-republic or of some of the higher  
ones, and feels that he is a participator in the government of affairs,  
not merely at an election one day in the year, but every day; when  
there shall not be a man in the state who will not be a member of  
some one of its councils, great or small; he will let the heart be torn out  
of his body sooner than his power be wrested from him by a Cesar or  
a Bonaparte. How powerfully did we feel the energy of this organ-  
ization in the case of embargo? I felt the foundation of the govern-
