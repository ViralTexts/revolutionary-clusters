A letter from you calls up recollections very dear to my mind. it carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties &amp; dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right of self-government. laboring always at the same oar, with a   
some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us &amp; yet passing harmless under our bark we knew not how, we rode through the storm with heart &amp; hand, and made a happy port

&quot;Here wo do little in the fine way, but in  
  
coarse and- middling good a great deal.  
  
Every famBy in the country is a manufactory  
  
within itself, and is very generally able- to  
  
make witbm lUelt ail the stouter and mm  
  
duns: stuns for its own clothing and house  
  
hold -use.. We tin.ider a shep for every  
  
person in the lamily as sufficient to clothe it,  
  
in addition to the cotton, hemp, and flt.x,  
  
which we raise ourselves. For fine stuff we  
shall depend on your Northern manufactor  
  
ies. -Of these, that is to say of company  
  
establishments, we have none. We use little  
  
machinery. Thepinning jenny and loom  
  
witn Hying shuttle can be managed in a  
  
familv, but nothing more complicated.  
  
&quot;A letter frm you caJls up recollections  
  
very dear to my mind. It carries me back  
  
to the times when, beset with difficulties and  
  
dangers,&#x27; we were fellow-laborers in the same  
cause, struggling for what is most valuable  
  
to man, his right of self-government. Labor  
  
ing always at the same oar, with some wave  
overhead threatening to overwhelm us, and  
yet passing harmless under our bark, we kne w  
not how we rode through the storm with  
  
heart and hand, and made a happy port.

 seen by men. Of the  
signers of the Declaration of Independence,  
I see now living not more than half a dozen  
on your side of the Potomac, and on this  
side myself alone. You and I have been  
wonderfully spared; and myself with re-  
markable health and a considerable activ-  
ity of body and mind. I am on horseback  
three or four hours of every day, visit  
three or four times a year a possession I  
have ninety miles distant, performing the  
winter journey on horseback. I walk  
little, however, a single mile being too  
much for me, and I live in the midst of my  
grandchildren, one of whom has lately  
promoted me to be a great-grandfather.  
I have heard with pleasure that you also  
retain good health, and a greater power of  
exercise in walking than I do. But I  
would rather have heard this from your-  
self, and that, writing a letter like mine,  
full of egotisms and of details of your  
health, your habits, occupations and en-  
joyments, I should have the pleasure of  
knowing that in the race of life you do  
not keep, in its physical decline, the same  
distance ahead of me which you have done  
in political honors and achievements. No  
circumstances have lessened the interest I  
feel in these particulars respecting your-  
self; none have suspended for one moment  
my sincere esteem for you, and I now  
salute you with unchanged affection and  
respect.  
“Thomas Jefferson.
