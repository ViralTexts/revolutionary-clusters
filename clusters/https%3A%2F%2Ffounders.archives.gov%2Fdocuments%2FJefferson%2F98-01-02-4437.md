rrectness, on first reading your letter I was alarmed when I met with something like a dissent from my conclusion; and I immediately paused, to reconsider my notion of unchangeableness in a national polity: But, not therein discovering any error, and, on proceeding to the end of your argument on that topic, I felt relieved by the persuasion then afforded me, that, from the premises in which both of us are agreed, when closely attended to, the same doctrine will in fact be found to result.In vindication of this inference, I am sure you will excuse my analyzing the passage in your letter to which I allude.—You ask—“can one generation bind another, and all others in succession for ever?”—With your own, my answer also is, “I think not;” and to this answer I add—but, nevertheless, the Law of Nature must so bind future generations; since this law, when once ascertained, is of eternal obligation.—You proceed to remark, that “the creator has made the earth for the living, not the dead. Rights and powers can only belong to persons, not to things.” To all this, I fully assent.—You further say, “a generation may bind itself as long as its majority continues in life. When that has disappeared, another majority is in place, holds all the rights and powers their predecessors once held, and may change their laws and institutions to suit themselves.”—Confining this observation to the laws and legal institutions, in contradistinction to an adopted constitution framed according to the Law of Nature, I say the same.—Your final proposition is, “Nothing then is unchangeable but the inherent and unalienable rights of men.

generation bind another, and all others, in  
succession forever ?”’ Then he answers it  
himself: “I think not. The Creator has  
made the earth for the living, not the dead.”  
Presently he adds: “ A generation may bind
