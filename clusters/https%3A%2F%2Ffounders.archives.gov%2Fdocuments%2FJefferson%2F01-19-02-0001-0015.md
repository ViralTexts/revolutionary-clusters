By the President of the U. S. of A. a Proclamation  
Whereas by a proclamation bearing date the 24th. day of Jan. of this present year, and in pursuance of certain acts of the states of Maryland and Virginia, and of the Congress of the U. S. therein mentioned, certain lines of experiment were directed to be run in the neighborhood of George town in Maryland for the purpose of determining the location of a part of the territory of 10. miles square for the permanent seat of government of the U. S. and a certain part was directed to be located within the said lines of experiment on both sides of the Potomac and above the limit of the Eastern branch prescribed by the said act of Congress:  
And Congress by an amendatory act, passed on the 3d. day of this present month of March, have given further authority to the President of the U. S. ‘to make any part of the territory below the said limit and above the mouth of Hunting creek, a part of the said district, so as to include a convenient part of the Eastern branch, and of the lands lying on the lower side thereof, and also the town of Alexandria.’  
Now therefore for the purpose of amending and completing the location of the whole of the said territory of ten miles square in conformity with the said amendatory act of Congress, I do hereby declare and make known that the whole of the said territory shall be located and included within the four lines following, that is to say:  
Beginning at Jones’s point, being the upper cape of Hunting creek in Virginia, and at an angle, in the outset, of 45. degrees West of the North; and running in a direct line ten miles for the first line: then beginning again at the same Jones’s point, and running another direct line, at a right angle with the first, across the Potomac, ten miles for the second line: then from the terminations of the said first and second lines, running two other direct lines, of ten miles each, the one crossing the Eastern branch aforesaid, and the other the Potomac, and meeting each other in a point.  
And I do accordingly direct the Commissioners named under the authority of the said first mentioned act of Congress to proceed forthwith to have the said four lines run, and by proper metes and bounds defined and limited, and thereof to make due report under their hands and seals: and the territory so to be located, defined  and limited, shall be the whole territory accepted by the said acts of Congress as the district for the permanent seat of the government of the U. S.  
&lt;And Whereas the said first mentioned act of Congress did further enact that the said Commissioners should, under the direction of the President of the U. S. provide suitable buildings for the accomodation of Congress and of the President and for the public offices of the government of the United States; I do hereby further declare and make known, that [the highest summit of lands in the

miles square for the seat of the government, but providing  
that nothing contained in the act should authorize the erec-  
tion of the public buildings otherwise than on the Maryland  
side of the river Potomac.  
  
On March 30, a.p. 1791, President Washington issued a  
proclamation, describing the territory selected by him for the  
location of the seat of government, as follows:  
  
“ Beginning at Jones’ Point, being the upper cape of Hunt-  
ing Creek in Virginia, and at an angle, in the outset, of forty-  
five degrees west of the north, and running in a direct line  
ten miles for the first line; then beginning again at the same  
Jones’ Point and running another direct line at a right angle  
with the first across the Potomac ten miles for the second  
line; then from the terminations of the said first and second  
lines, running two other direct lines of ten miles each, the one  
crossing the Eastern Branch aforesaid and the other the Poto-  
mac, and meeting each other in a point.”  
  
The Commissioners were accordingly instructed by the Presi-  
dent to have the said four lines run, and to report their action.  
  
In the meantime intercourse was had between the Commis-  
sioners and the principal owners of property within the dis-  
trict, looking to the sale and conveyance by the latter of land  
on which a Federal City was to be erected. And the following  
agreement was signed by the proprietors:  
  
“We, the subscribers, in consideration of the great benefits  
we expect to derive from having the Federal City laid off  
upon our lands, do hereby agree and bind ourselves, heirs,  
executors and administrators, to convey in trust, to the Presi-
