His information and his reasoning will be useful in the discussion; and to illustrate both I also inclose herewith a copy of the Map to which he refers in the beginning of his letter.  
The essential objects to be secured to the United States are the jurisdiction of Moose Island and the common navigation of the Bay and of the channels leading towards the sea between Deer Island and the Island of Campo bello. To the observations of Judge Sullivan in support of the rights of the United States it need only be added that the outlet through those Islands being the only adequate communication with the sea from a great and valuable territory of the United States, they are entitled to the full use of it on that principle as well as on others; and with the less pretext for objection, as the trifling island

 each of the two Governments, and an appointment by the two Commissioners of a surveyor. In fixing the point at which the line is to terminate, and which is referred to as the N. W. angle of Nova Scotia, the difficulty arises from a referrence of the Treaty of 1783 “to the Highlands,” which it is now found have no definite existence. To cure this difficulty, no better expedient occurs than to provide for the appointment of a third Commissioner as in Art: 5th of the Treaty of 1794, and to authorize the three to determine on a point most proper to be substituted for the description in the 2d Art: of the Treaty of 1783, having due regard to the general idea that the line ought to terminate on the elevated ground dividing the rivers falling into the atlantic from those emptying themselves into the St Laurence. The Commissioners may also be authorized, to substitute for the description of the boundary between the point so fixed and the Northwestermost head of Connecticut river, namely, a line drawn “along the said Highlands” such a referrence to intermediate sources of rivers, or other ascertained or ascertainable points, to be connected by straight lines, as will admit of easy and accurate execution hereafter, and as will best comport with the apparent intention of the Treaty of 1783. The remaining provision necessary to complete the boundary of the United States, will be a stipulation amending the 2d Art: of the Treaty of 1783 in its description of the line which is to connect th

I would refer, in proof of this, simply to Ameri-  
ean authorities, and those of the very first order.  
  
In the year 1802, Mr. Madison, at that time Sec-  
retary of State for the United States, in his in-  
structions to Mr. Rufus King, observed that the  
difficulty in fixing the northwest angle of Nova  
Scotia “arises from a reference, in the treaty of  
  
1783, to highlands which it is now found have no °  
  
definite existence.’ And he suggests the appoint-  
ment of a commission, to be jointly appointed, “to  
determine on a point most proper to be substituted  
for the description in article IL of the treaty of  
1783.” Again: Mr. President Jefierson, in a mes-  
sage to Congress, on the 17th October, 1803, state

&quot; In fixing,&quot; said he. &quot; the point at which the line  
is to terminate, and which is referred to as the northwest  
angle of Nova Scotia, the difficulty arises from  
a reference of the treaty of 1783 to &#x27; the highlands,&#x27;  
which it is notr found hare no ilejinite existence. To remove  
this difficulty, i o belter exjiedient occurs than  
  
lo provide i ir uie appointment ol a third commissioner,  
as in article five of the treaty of 17&#x27;J4; anil to authorize  
the three lo determine on a point to be substituted  
for the description in the second article oi&#x27; the  
treaty of 1783, having due regard to the general iJeu  
that the line ought lo terminate oil the elevated  
ground dividing the rivers falling into the Atlantic,  
from those emptying themselves into the St. Lawrence.  
The commissioners may also be authorized  
to substitute for the description ot the boundary between  
the point so fixed and the uorthwesterninosl head of  
the Connecticut river?namely, a line &#x27;along the said  
highlands&#x27;?such a reference to intermediate sources  
of rivers, or other ascertained or ascertainable points,  
to be connected by straight lines, as will admit of easy  
and accurate execution hereafter, and as will best  
comport w ith the apparent intention of the treaty of  
1783 &quot;  
Here we have an instruction from one of the most  
cautious, as well as able and enligntemd statesmen
