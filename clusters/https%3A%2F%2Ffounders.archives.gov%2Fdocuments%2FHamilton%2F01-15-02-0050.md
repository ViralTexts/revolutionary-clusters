The second &amp; principal objection to the Proclamation namely that it is inconsistent with the Treaties between the United States and France will now be examined.  
It has been already shewn, that it is not inconsistent with the performance of any of the stipulations in those Treaties, which would not make us an associate or party in the war and particularly, that it is compatible with the privileges secured to France by the 17 &amp; 22d articles of the Treaty of Commerce; which, except the clause of Guarantee, constitute the most material discriminations to be found in our treaties in favour of that Country.  
Official documents have likewise appeared, in the public papers, which are understood to be authentic, that serve as a comment upon the sense of the proclamation in this particular; proving that it was not deemed by the Executive incompatible with the performance of the stipulations in those articles, and that in practice they are intended to be observed.  
It has however been admitted, that the declaration of neutrality excludes the idea of an execution of the clause of Guarantee.  
It becomes necessary therefore to examine whether the United States would have a valid justification for not complying with it, in case of their being called upon for that purpose by France.  
Without knowing how far the reasons, which have occurred to me, may have influenced the President, there appear to me to exist very good and substantial grounds for a refusal.  
The Alliance between the United States and France is a Defensive Alliance. In the Caption of it it is denominated a “Treaty of Alliance eventual and defensive.” In the body of it, (Article the 2) it is again called a defensive Alliance. The words of that Article are as follow “The essential and direct end of the present Defensive Alliance is to maintain effectually the liberty, sovereignty, and independence absolute and unlimited, of the United States, as well in matters of government as of commerce.”  
The predominant quality or character then of our alliance with France is that it is defensive in its principle. Of course, the meaning obligation and force of every stipulation in the Treaty must be tested and determined by that principle. It is not necessary (and would be absurd) that it should be repeated in every article. It is sufficient that it be once declared, to be understood in every part of the Treaty, unless coupled with express negative words excludi⟨ng⟩ the implication.  
The great question consequently is—What are the nature and effect of a defensive alliance? When does the casus fœderis, or condition of the contract take place, in such an alliance?  
Reason the concurring opinions of Writers and the practice of Nations will answer—“When either of the allies is attacked, when war is made upon him not when he makes war upon another.” In other words, The stipulated assistance is to be given to the ally, when engaged in a defensive not when engaged in an offensive war. This obligation to assist only in a defensive war constitutes the essential difference between a defensive alliance and one which is both offensive and defensive. In the latter case there is an obligation to cooperate as well when the war on the part of our ally is offensive as when it is defensive. To affirm therefore that the UStates are bound to assist France in the War in which she is at present engaged would be to convert our Treaty with her into an Alliance Offensive and Defensive contrary to the express &amp; reiterated declarations of the Instrument itself.  
This assertion implies that the War in question is an offensive war on the part of France.  
And so it undoubtedly is with regard to all the powers with whom she was at War at the time of issuing the Proclamation.  
No position is better established than that the Power which first declares or actually begins a War, whatever may have been the causes leading to it, is that which makes an offensive war. Nor is there any doubt that France first declared and began the War against Austria, Prussia, Savoy Holland England and Spain.  
Upon this point there is apt to be some incorrectness of ideas. Those, who have not examined subjects of such a Nature are led to imagine that the party which commits the first injury or gives the first provocation is on the offensive side in the war, though begun by the other party.  
But the cause or occasion of the War and the War itself are things entirely distinct. Tis the commencement of the War itself that decides the question of being on the offensive or defensive. All writers on the laws of Nations agree in this principle but it is more accurately laid down in the following extract from Burlamaqu

mands the satisfaction for the Injury received is always on the Defensive. There are a great many unjust acts which may kindle a War and which however are not the war itself, as the ill treatment of a Princes Ambassador the plundering of his subjects &amp;c.”  
“If therefore we take up arms to revenge such an unjust act we commence an offensive but a just war; and the Prince who has done the injury and will not give satisfaction makes a defensive but an unjust war.”  
“We must therefore affirm, in general, that the first who takes up arms whether justly or unjustly commences an offensive War &amp; he who opposes him whether with or without reason, begins a defensive War.  
France then being on the offensive in the war, in which she is engaged, and our alliance with her being defensive only, it follows that the casus fœderis or condition of our guarantee cannot take place; and that the UStates are free to refuse a performance of that guarantee, if demanded.  
Those who are disposed to justify indiscriminately every thing, in the conduct of France, may reply that though the war in point of form may be offensive on her part, yet in point of principle it is defensive—was in each instance a mere anticipation of attacks meditated against her, and was justified by previous aggressions of the opposite parties.  
It is believed that it would be a sufficient answer to this observation to say that in determ[in]ing the legal and positive obligations of the UStates the only point of inquiry is—whether the War was in fact begun by France or by her enemies; that All beyond this would be too vague, too liable to dispute, too much matter of opinion to be a proper criterion of National Conduct; that when a war breaks out between two Nations, all other nations, in regard to the positive rights of the parties and their positive duties towards them are bound to consider it as equally just on both sides—that consequently in a defensive alliance, when war is made upon one of the allies, the other is bound to fulfil the conditions stipulated on its part, without inquiry whether the war is rightfully begun or not—as on the other hand when war is begun by one of the allies the other is exempted from the obligation of assisting; however just the commencement of it may have been.  
  
The foundation of this doctrine, is the utility of clear and certain rules for determining the reciprocal duties of nations—that as little as possible may be left to opinion and the subterfuges of a refining or unfaithful casuistry.  
Some writers indeed of great authority affirm that it is a tacit condition of every Treaty of alliance, that one ally is not bound to assist the other in a war manifestly unjust. But this is questioned on the ground which has been stated by other respectable authorities. And though the manifest injustice of the war has been affirmed by some, to be a good cause for not executing the formal obligations of a treaty, I have no where found it maintained, that the justice of a war is a consideration, which can oblige a nation to do what its formal obligations do not require; as in the case of a defensive alliance, to furnish the succours stipulated, though the formal obligation did not exist, by reason of the ally having begun the war, instead of being the party attacked.  
But if this were not the true doctrine, an impartial examination would prove, that with respect to some of the powers, France is not blameless in the circumstances, which preceded and led to the war with those powers; that if she received, she also gave cause of offense, and that the justice of the War on her side is, in those cases, not a little problematical.  
There are prudential reasons which dissuade from going largely into this examination; unless it shall be rendered necessary by the future turn of the discussion.  
It will be sufficient here, to notice cursorily the following facts.  
France committed an aggression upon Holland in declaring free the navigation of the Scheldt and acting upon that declaration; contrary to Treaties in which she had explicitly acknowleged and even guaranteed the exclusive right of Holland to the navigation of that River and contrary to the doctrines of the best Writers and established usages of Nations, in such cases.  
She gave a general and just cause of alarm to Nations, by that Decree of the 19th. of November 1792 whereby the Convention, in the name of the French Nation, declare that they will grant fraternity and assistance to every People who wish to recover their liberty and charge the Executive Power to send the necessary orders to the Generals to give assistance to such people, and to defend those citizens who may have been or who may be vexed for the cause of liberty; which decree was ordered to be printed in all languages.  
When a Nation has actually come to a resolution to throw off a yoke, under which it may have groaned, and to assert its liberties—it is justifiable and meritorious in another nation to afford assistance to the one which has been oppressed &amp; is in the act of liberating itself; but it is not warrantable for any Nation beforehand to hold out a general invitation to insurrection and revolution, by promising to assist every people who may wish to recover their liberty and to defend those citizens, of every country, who may have been or who may be vexed for the cause of liberty; still less to commit to the Generals of its armies the discretionary power of judging when the Citizens of a foreign Country have been vexed for the cause of Liberty by their own government.  
The latter part of the decree amounted exactly to what France herself has most complained of—an interference by one nation in the internal Government of another.  
Vatel justly observes, as a consequence of the Liberty &amp; Independence of Nations—“That it does not belong to any foreign Power to take cognizance of the administration of the sovereign of another country, to set himself up as a judge of his Conduct or to oblige him to alter it.”  
Such a conduct as that indicated by this Decree has a natural tendency to disturb the tranquillity of nations, to excite fermentation and revolt every where; and therefore justified neutral powers, who were in a situation to be affected by it in taking measures to repress the spirit by which it had been dictated.  
But the principle of this Decree received a more particular application to Great Britain by some subsequent circumstances.  
Among the proofs of this are two answers, which were given by the President of the National Convention at a public sitting on the 28th. of November to two different addresses; one presented by a Deputation from “The Society for constitutional information in London” the other by a deputation of English &amp; Irish Citizens at Paris.  
  
The following are extracts from these answers.  
“The shades of Penn, of Hambden and of Sydney hover over your heads; and the moment without doubt approaches, in which the French will bring congratulations to the National Convention of Great Britain.”  
“Nature and principles draw towards us England Scotland and Ireland. Let the cries of friendship resound through the two Republics.” “Principles are waging war against Tyranny, which will fall under the blows of philosophy. Royalty in Europe is either destroyed or on the point of perishing, on the ruins of feudality; and the Declaration of Rights placed by the side of thrones is a devouring fire which will consume them. Worthy Republicans &amp;c.”  
Declarations of this sort cannot but be considered as a direct application of the principle of the Decree to Great Britain; as an open patronage of a Revolution in that Country; a conduct which proceeding from the head of the body that governed France in the presence and on behalf of that body was unquestionably an offense and injury to the Nation to which it related.  
The decree of the 15 of November is another cause of offence to all the Governments of Europe. By That Decree “The French Nation declares, that it will treat as enemies the people, who refusing or renouncing liberty and equality are desirous of preserving their Prince and privileged casts—or of entering into an accomodation with them &amp;c.” This degree was little short of a declaration of War against all Nations, having princes and privileged classes.  
The incorporation of the territories, over which the arms of France had temporarily prevailed, with and as a part of herself is another violation of the rights of Nations into which the Convention was betrayed by an intemperate zeal, if not by a culpable ambition.  
The laws of Nations give to a Power at War nothing more than a usufructuary or possessory right to the territories, which it conquers; suspending the absolute dominion &amp; property till a treaty of Peace or something equivalent shall cede or relinquish the conquered territory to the Conqueror. This principle is one of the greatest importance to the tranquillity and security of Nations; facilitating an adjustment of the quarrels and the preservation of ancient limits.  
  
But France, by incorporating with herself, in several instances, the territories she had acquired, violated this important principle and multiplied indefinitely the obstacles to peace and accommodation. The Doctrine, that a Nation cannot consent to its own dismemberment, but in a case of extreme necessity, immediately attached itself to all the incorporated territories. While the progressive augmentation of the dominions of the most powerful nation in Europe, on a principle not of temporary acquisition, but of permanent union, threatened the independence of all other countries and give to neighbouring neutral powers the justest cause of umbrage and alarm.  
It is a principle well agreed &amp; founded on the best reasons, that whenever a particular nation adopts maxims of conduct contrary to ⟨th⟩ose generally established among nations calculated to disturb their tranquillity &amp; to expose their safety, they may justifiably make a common cause to oppose &amp; controul such Nation.  
Whatever partial[it]y may be entertained for the general object of the French Revolution, it is impossible for any well informed or soberminded man not to condemn the proceedings which have been stated; as repugnant to the general rights of Nations, to the true principles of liberty, to the freedom of opinion of mankind; &amp; not to acknowlege as a consequence of this, that the justice of the war on the part of France, with regard to some of the powers with which she is engaged, is from those causes questionable enough to free the UStates from all embarrassment on that score; if it be at all incumbent upon them to go into the inquiry.  
The policy of a defensive alliance is so essentially distinct from that of an offensive one, that it is every way important not to confound their effects. The first kind has in view the prudent object of mutual defence, when either of the allies is involuntarily forced into a war by the attack by some third power. The latter kind subjects the peace of each ally to the will of the other, and obliges each to partake in the wars of policy &amp; interest, as well as in those of safety and defence, of the other. To preserve their boundaries distinct it is necessary that each kind should be governed by plain and obvious rules. This would not be the case, if instead of taking the simple fact of who begun the war as a guide, it was necessary to travel into metaphysical niceties about the justice or injustice of the cause which led to it. Since also the not furnishing a stipulated succour, when it is due, is itself a cause of War, it is very requisite, that there should be some palpable criterion for ascertaining when it is due. This criterion as before observed, in a defensive alliance is the commencement or not of the war by our ally, as a mere matter of fact.  
Other topics calculated to illustrate the position, that the UStates are not bound to execute the clause of guarantee; are reserved for another paper

THE second and principal ofcjeftion to the  
proclamation, namely, (hat it is iti&#x27;con­  
filtent with the treaties between the Unite J  
St:&#x27;&quot;es an.d France, will now be examined.  
It has been already !lic\Vn, that it is nnt in­  
confident with the performance of any of the  
stipulations in thole treaties, which would  
not make ns an alTociate or party in the v at  
and particularly that it is incompatible with  
the privileges secured to Fiance by the fe­  
venteentb and twenty-second articlei of the  
Treaty of Commerce ; which, except the  
claur&lt;* of guarantee, comlitute the most ma­  
terial discriminations to be found in our trea­  
ties in favor of that country.  
Official documents have likewise appeared  
in the pnblic papers, which are understood to  
be authentic, that serve as a comment upon  
the lenfe of the proclamation in this part ci:-  
lar, proving that it was nto deemed by the  
executive incompatible with the performance  
of the ftipnlatio&#x27;ns in tbofe articles, and that  
in practice they are intended to be obiervec1.  
It has however been admitted, that the  
declaration of netit&#x27;rality excludes the idea of  
an execution of the clause of guarantee.  
It becomes neceHary therefore toexanrme,  
whether the United States would have a va­  
lid juftificatien for no&#x27; complying with it, iii  
ca&#x27;e of the , r being called upon for that pur­  
pore by France.  
Without knowing bow far the reasons&quot;  
which have occurred to me, may have influ­  
enced the President, there appear to me to  
exist very good and fubftantiaJ grnan&#x27;ds far A  
refufal.  
  
The alliance between the United States  
and France is a d-Jevfive alliance. In the cap­  
tion of it it »s denominated a u treatv of al­  
liance eventual and dejenfive.&quot; In the body of  
it. (article second) it is called adefenfive alliance.  
The, words of that article are as follow 44 the  
efTential and dire&lt;sl end of the present dcfcvfve  
&#x27;affiance is to maintain eife&amp;uajly the liberty,  
sovereignty and independence absolute and  
unlimited of the United States, as wdlfin  
mat te v r «tr •?» &lt;*-ef com me r ce.&#x27;&#x27;  
  
The predominant quality or character then  
of our alliance wi:h France is, t&#x27;.&lt;at it h&#x27;de­  
ftnfive in its principle, of course the meaning  
obligation and force of every stipulation in  
the treaty must he tested and determined by  
that principle. It j&#x27;s not necetfary (and would  
be abTurd) that it lhould be repeated in every  
article. 11 is fufHcienc that it be once de­  
clared, to big undferftood in every part of the  
treaty, unless coup&#x27;ed with express negative  
words excluding the implication.  
The great queflion consequently :s—what  
are the. nature and eueft of a defenfive alli­  
ance ? When does the cafus fcdeer is, or cords/ion  
of the contra# take place, in such an alliance?  
  
Reason, the concurring opinions of writers,  
and the practice of nations will answer  
u when either of the allies i* attacked, when  
war is made upon him, not when he makes  
war upon another In other words, the ft -  
pulated afHUance is to be given to the ally  
when engaged in a defcnficc, not when enga­  
ge/J in an o]f:nf,ve war. This obligation to  
allift only in a defenfive war, the  
eilential difference between a defenfive allir  
ance and one which is both ofifcnfive and dr.  
fenliye. In the latter cafe there is an obli­  
gation to co operate as well when the war on  
the part of our ally is offenfive, as when.it is  
defenfive. To affirm therefore, that the  
United States are bound to allift France in  
the war in which Ihe is at preient engaged,  
would be to convert our treary with, her into  
an alliance offenfive and defenfive, contrary  
to the express and reiterated declarations of  
the instrument itfelf.  
  
This afljertion implies, that the war in  
question is an ojfcnjivc war on the part of  
  
France.  
  
And To it undoubtedly is with regard to all  
the powers with whom fl?e was. at war at the  
tir.se ofifiuing the proclamation.  
  
No portion is betrer eftablilhed, than that  
the power which firjl declares, or ail tally begins  
a War, whatever may have been the caul&#x27;es  
leading to it, is that which makes an ojfcnjive  
war. Nor is there any doubt that France  
nrft declared and began the war, against Au­  
stria, Prussia, Savoy, Holland, England and  
Spain.  
  
Upon this point there is apt to be some in­  
corre&amp;nefs of ideas. Thjofe who have not  
examined fubjefts of such a nature, are led to  
imagine that the party which commits the  
firft injury, or gives the firft provocation, is  
0:1 the offenfive fide in the war, though begun  
by the other party.  
  
But the cause or the occasion of the war,  
and the war itielf, are things entirely diftinA.  
Tis the commencement of the war itfelf,  
that decries the question of being an the of­  
fenli ve or deienfive. Ail writers on the laws  
ot nations agree in this principle, but it is  
more accurately laid down in the following

janfo the fatiij&amp;clijn &#x27;for the injury reficitca,&#x27;  
is aiwavs on the dejenfue. Then; are a great  
many vnjuJl&#x27;dMs which may kindle a war, and  
which- luwever are not the , war itfelt&quot;—as  
the ill treatment of a prince&#x27;s ambaiTadors,  
the plundering of his fubje&amp;s, &amp;c.&quot;  
&quot; If therefore we take up arms to revenge  
such an unjiiH aCI, we com.nence an off &#x27;nfive  
butajuft wai ; and the prince who has done  
the injury, and will not give fatisfa&amp;ion,  
jnnke&quot; a defenfive but an unjust war.&quot;  
  
&quot;We mult therefore affirm, in general,  
that the firft who takes up arms, whether  
jujily or uM/ufiiy, commences an ejfenjivc war,  
and he who oppofas him, whether with or  
without reason, begins a defunliye war.&quot;  
  
France then being on the ojfcnfive in the war  
in which she is engaged, and our alliance  
with her being defenfrve only, it follows, that  
the tafus foederis, or condition of our guaran­  
tee, cannot take place; and that the United  
States are free to rcfufe -a peiformance of  
that guarantee, if demardod  
  
T&#x27;&#x27;ofe who are dilpofed to juftify indiscri­  
minately every thing n the conduct of France,  
may reply, that ih &gt;ugh the war in point of  
form may be ofFenlive on her part, yet in  
point of princip&#x27;e, it is d*fenfive—was in each  
instance a mere anticipation of attacks me  
ditafed against her, and was jult fied by pre­  
vious a2,gieffions~of the oppoiite pa* ties.  
  
It is b&#x27;-Heved, that it would be a ufiicient  
anfwerto th s observation to lay, that hi de  
termining the legal and po/iire obligations of  
the United Sta s,the o ly point of inquiry is,  
whether the war in fa I began by   
or byher ene.nes—&#x27; hat aM beyond tfii w &gt;uld  
be too var-;u£, too liable &#x27;o di&#x27;.pute, too uc 1  
matter of opinio 1 &#x27; i oe a f&gt; oyer criterion o  
rational to &gt;dufr ; that when a war Breaks  
out between two jation% all other nations, in  
regard to the poutive rights of the p* ties,  
and their p si ve duties toward; them, are  
bou&#x27;d to coniitier it as equally jult on both  
fid.&#x27; —that co&#x27; equentlv in a dejenfue alliance,  
when war is mile upon one of t:i; aliier., the  
other is bound to fulfil the conditions ftipu-  
on its part, v t lout inquiry, whetner rhc  
war is rightfully begun or not—as, on ?:he  
o* .er hand, when war is begun by one of the  
allies, tilt other is exempted f om the obliga­  
tio ef lfifting ; nowever jnit the commence­  
jnent of it m.iy have been.  
  
The foundation of this doctrine is, the -uti­  
lity of certain rules for determining  
the reciprocal duties pi «atioris-»-that as littie  
»s polSSle be left to opinion, andto the  
fu&#x27; terfugejof a refining or unfaithful cafuif­  
tly ; . - • .. .  
  
Some writers indeed of great authority af­  
firm, rhjt ]t is a tacit condition of every  
treat of aNiance, t &gt;at 01 e ally is not bound  
to afiilt the other in a war manifeftly unjust.  
But this is queftio.ied on the ground which  
has been stated by other refpeftable authori­  
ties And though the ina.iifeft: injnftice of  
the war has been affirmed by lbinjy to be a  
good cauf- for not executing the formai obli­  
gations of a treaty. I have no where found it  
maintained, that the jultice ofa war is a con­  
fxderation which ran oblige a nation to do  
wnat its formal obligat &gt;ns d 3 not require ;  
as in the cafe ofa dejcnjiiic alliance, to fu nifh  
the luccours stipulated, though ti.e formal ob­  
ligation did notexift, by reason of the ally  
having begun the war instead of being the  
part-y attacked.  
Bnt if t!iis were not the true doftrrne, an  
Impartial examination would &quot;prove, that witl  
refpeft to some of t ie powers, France is not  
Wamelefs in the circumstances winch precedec  
and led to the war with t&#x27;.iofe powers; thai  
if flu eceived, lhe a!fo gave causes of of  
fence, a d that the juftite of the war, on hei  
fide, is in those caies not a littie problema  
tical.  
  
T iere are p u lential reaforls which difluade  
from going largely into this examination, un­  
less it ihal! be rendered necelTary by the fu­  
tue tii&#x27; n of rhe dift ufiioii.  
It will befn&amp;cient here, to notice cursorily  
tK following tufts.  
  
Fiance co.nnitted an npon Hoi-  
Jand in declaring fiee the navigation oi the  
Sc&#x27;ieldt, and acting upon that declaration ;  
contrary to Treaties in which she had expli­  
citly acknowledged and even guaranteed the  
exclnfive right of Holland to the navigation  
of that river, and contrary to the doitrines  
of the best wrners, and the eftabliflied   
of nations in such cases.  
  
She give a general and just cause of alarm  
to nation-?, by that decree of the 19th of No­  
vemberf 1792, whereby tbe Convention, in  
the name of the French nation, declare that  
they will g ant Jraternity and ajjijlance to every  
f topic who rvipi ro recover their liberty, and  
charge the executive power to lend the necef-  
A\ry orders to the generals to give aifiltance to  
such people, and to defend thoje citizens who may  
have been, or who may be vexed tor the caule  
oflberty; which decree was 01 dered to be  
printed in all languages.  
• Whim a nation has a&amp;ually come to a refo-  
Intiou to thraw off a yoke, under which it may  
Have groaned, and to all&#x27;ert its liberties, it is  
juftifiahle and meritorious in another nation  
to afford afliltance ro the one which has been  
opprelTed, and is in sheaS of liberating itleJf,  
but it i% not warrantable for any nation bejore­  
koud to hold out a general invitation to inlur­  
feetion and revolution, by promising to assist  
ctery people who may xuijh to recover their li­  
berty, and to defend those cuizcjis oi every  
country, who may have beeni or who may be vexed  
jor the cauje of liberty&#x27; It ill le Is to commit to  
the Genkr als of its armies the discretionary  
power of judging, when the citizens of a fo­  
reign country have been vexed for the caul&#x27; 6  
oi liberty by their own government.  
  
The iatrer part of t&#x27;le decree amounted  
to what France herfelf had molt com­  
p&#x27;jined of-**an interference by one nation in  
i*: -* iutevnal government of another.  
  
• Vatel juillv o&#x27;.;fcrv«-,, as a conl«]uence of  
li!»,-;tv and independence of nations—  
  
-1 - does riot belong t) P.nV forv-ion quiver  
to take cognizance of&quot; the-adminiftratioYi -of  
thejovereiga of another country, to ler-himfMf  
up as a judge of bis cosdu&amp;,:or to obiige iiun  
to alter it.&quot; &#x27; . &#x27;  
  
Such a conduct as that indicated by this  
decree, has a natural tendency to disturb the  
tranquility of nations, to excite fermentation  
and revolt every where; and thereforeju(li­  
fted neutral powers, who were in a lituation  
to be aittrfted bv it, in taking me afu res to re  
pre(s the Ipirit by which it had been dictated.  
But the principle of this decrec received a  
more particular application roGreat-Britain,  
by some subsequent circumftarices,  
  
Among the proofs of this are two answers,&#x27;  
which were given by the President of the  
National Convention, at a public fitting on  
the 28th of to two clitivrent, ad­  
dre&#x27;Tes; one presented by a deputation from  
&quot; The Society for Constitutional Information  
in London&quot;—the other by a deputation of  
EngJifh and Iridi citizens at Paris.  
The following are extra&amp;s from these an­  
swers:  
&quot; The (hades of Fenn, of Hambden and of  
Sydney, hover over your head&#x27;-; and tht mo­  
ment, wvjtout do-iht, approaches, in xvhich the French  
will bring congratulation &#x27;s to the National Conven­  
tion of (treat-Britain.&quot;  
  
&quot; Nature and principles draw towards us  
England, Scotland and Ireland. Let the cries  
of friend»h&#x27;p r-found through the two Repub­  
lics.&quot; 44 Principles are waging war agai&#x27;ift  
tyranny, which will fall under the blows of  
ohilftfbpliy. fto\a/f\ in Europe is eirh r dJlro\ed,  
or on the point of perijh &#x27;mg, on the ruins ot&#x27;fceo­  
dalit1 ; and the declaration of rights phc db\ the  
si le oj thrones, is a devouring fire which willco&gt;Jme  
th m.— &#x27;/OR.THY REPUBLICANS, &amp;C.  
Declarations of this fort cannot but be con­  
sidered as a d eel application of the principle  
of the decree to Great-Britain ; as an open  
patronage of a revolution in that country ; a  
ror.duct which proceeding from she head of the  
body that governs France, in the prerenee&#x27;  
and on behalf of that body, was unquestiona­  
bly an orfence and injury to the nation to  
which it related.  
  
The dec ee of the 1 of November is  
another cause of offence to all the govern­  
ments of Europe. Bv that decree 44 the French  
nation declares, that it will treat as enemies the  
penp/e, who re/nftng or renouncing liberty and  
equality, are J /irons of preserving their prince  
and privileged cajis—or of entering into an accom­  
modation with themy &amp;zc.&quot; This dectte was  
little /hort of a declaration of war a&quot;.ainft all  
nations having princes and privileged chjfes.  
  
The incorporation of the ten &quot;,^OJ ies, over  
which the arms of France had temporarily  
prevailed, with and as a part of herfelf, is mo­  
ther violation of the rights of nations, into  
which the convention was betrayed by an in­  
temperate zeal, if not by a culpable ambition.  
  
The laws of nations give to a power at war  
nothing more than a u&#x27;ufrn&amp;uary or pofleflo­  
rv right to the territories which it conquers ;  
suspending the abfoHite property and $lpmi-4  
rtion til a treaty of peace or fometh&#x27;ng equi­  
valent shall cede or relinduifh the conquered  
territory to the conqueror. This principle  
is one of the greatest importance to the tran­  
quility and security of nations—facilitating  
an adjuft.nent of their quarrels and the pre­  
servation of anc ent I&#x27;mits.  
But France, by incorporating with herfelf,  
in several instances, the territories she had  
acquired, violated this important principle  
and multiplied infinitely the oblfcacles of peace  
and accommodation. The roftrine, that a  
nation cannot consent to its own dfmember went, but  
in a cafe of extreme necejjityy immediately at­  
tached itfeif to all the important territories :  
while the progrefiive augmentation of the  
dominions of the mod powerful nation in Eu­  
rope, on a principle not of temporary acqui­  
sition, but of permanent union, threatened  
the independence of all other countries and  
gave to neighboring neutral powers the juftelt  
caufeof umbrage and alarm. It is a princi­  
ple well agreed and founded on the best rea­  
sons, that whenever a particular nation a­  
dopts maxims of conduct contrary to thofeV  
generally established among nations, calcula­  
ted todiftm b their tranquility and to expose  
their fafety, they may juitinabW make a com­  
mon cause to oppo.e and controul iuch na­  
tion.  
  
Whatever partiality may be entertained  
for the general object of the French revolu­  
tion, it is impofliole for any well informed or  
fooer minded man not to condemn the pro­  
ceeding* which have been itated ; as repug­  
nant to the general rights of nations, to fl e  
true principles of liberty, to the freedom of  
opinion of mankind : and not to acknowledge  
as a conlequence of this, that the justice oi  
the war on the part of France, with regard  
to some of the powers with which (he is en­  
gaged, is from those causes questionable  
• iough to free the United States from all  
emb.tn aflfineAts on that score ; if it be at all  
incumbent upon them to go into the inquiry.  
The policy of a defenfive alliance is so ei­  
fentially diftinft from that of an otfenfive one,  
that it is every way important not to con­  
found their eifc-(sts. The fir ft kind has in  
view toe prudent o&#x27;ojeft of mutual   
when either of the allies is invo&#x27;untarijy for­  
ced into a w ,r by t ie attack «f Tome   
power. The iatter kind fubje&amp;s the peace  
of each ally to the will of the other, and obli­  
ges each to pa&#x27; fake in the wars of policy and  
interest, as well as in those of fafety and de­  
fence, of the other. To preserve their boun­  
daries diftinft, it is necellary that each kind  
(hould be governed bv plain andobvi«&gt;us rules.  
This would not be the cafe, if instead of  
taking the simple fart of who begtftlfe the war  
asagoide, it was neteffary to travel into  
metaphysical nicetics about the juitice or in­  
justice of the causes which led to it- Since  
also the not furnilhing a stipulated succour,  
when it is due, is itielf a cause of war, it is  
very requifice, that there ihould be fome^&gt;al-
