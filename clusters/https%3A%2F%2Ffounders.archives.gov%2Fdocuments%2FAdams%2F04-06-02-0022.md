This Day 8 Months I sailed for Europe since which many new and interesting Scenes have presented them selves before me. I have seen many of the Beauties and some of the Deformities of this old World. I have been more than ever convinced that there is no Sumit of virtue, and no Depth of vice which Humane Nature is not Capable of riseing to, on the one hand, or sinking into on the other. I have felt the force of an observation which I have read, that “daily example is the most subtle of poisons.” I have found my taste reconciling itself to habits customs and fashions, which at first disgusted me. The first dance which I saw upon the Stage shoked me, the Dress’es and Beauty of the performers was enchanting, but no sooner did the Dance commence, than I felt my delicacy wounded, and I was ashamed to bee seen to look at them. Girls cloathd in the thinest Silk: and Gauze, with their peticoats short Springing two foot from the floor poising themselves in the air, with their feet flying, and as perfectly shewing their Garters and draws, as tho no peticoat had been worn, was a sight altogether new to me. Their motions are as light as air and as quick as lightning. They balance themselves to astonishment. No description can equal the reality. They are daily trained to it from early infancy, at a Royal academy instituted for this purpose. You will very often see little creatures not more than 7 or 8 years old as undauntedly performing their parts as the eldest amongst them. Shall I speak a Truth and say that repeatedly seeing these Dances has worn of that disgust which I first felt, and that I see them now with pleasure.

The art of dancing is carried to the highest degree of perfection that it is capable of; at the opera. The House is neither so grand, or Beautifull architecture as the French Theater, but it is more frequented by the Beau Mond, who had rather be amused than instructed. The Scenary is more various, and more highly decorated, the dresses more costly and rich. And O! the Musick vocal and instrumental, it has a soft persuasive power and a dying dying Sound. Conceive a highly decorated building filled with Youth, Beauty, Grace, ease, clad in all the most pleasing and various ornaments of Dress which fancy can form; these objects Singing like Cherubs to the best tuned instruments most skilfully handled, the softest tenderest Strains, every attitude corresponding with the musick, full of the God or Goddess whom they celebrate, the female voices accompanied by an equal number of Adonises.

“Where Musick Softnes, and where dancing fires”  
  
it requires the immortal Shield of the invincible Minerva to skreen youth from being wounded by the arrows which assail them upon every side.

She Caught him says the wise king, and kissed him with an impudent face. How often have I seen this upon the Stage?  
As soon as a Girl sets her foot upon the floor of the opera, she is excommunicated by the Church and denied Burial in holy ground; she conceives nothing worse can happen to her, all restraint is thrown off and she delivers herself to the first who bids high enough for her.

&quot;TO MKS. CRANCH.  
&quot;Autcuil, February 201 h, 1785.  
&quot;My dear sister.—This day eight months 1  
sailed for Europe, since which many new and  
interesting scenes have presented themselves  
before me. I have seen many of the beauties,  
and some of the deformities, of this old world.  
I have been more tnan ever convinced, that  
there is no summit of virfue, and no di pth of  
vice, which human nature is not capable of  
rising to on the one hand, or sinking into on the  
other. I have felt the force of an observation,  
which I have read, that daily example is the  
most subtle of all poisons I have found uiy  
taste reconciling itself to habits, customs, and  
fashions which at first disgusted uie. The  
fust dance which I saw upon tiic stage shocked  
me; the dresses and beauty of ill pnformers  
were exchanting; but, no sooner did the dance  
commence, than 1 felt my delicacy wounded,  
and I was ashampd to be seen to look at thein.  
Girls, clothed in the thinnest silk and guaze,  
with their petticoats short, springing two feet  
from the fioor, poising themsieves in the air,  
with their feet flying, and as perfectly showing  
their garters and drawers as though no petticoat  
had been won., was a sight altogether new to  
me. Their motions are as light as air and as  
quick as lightning; they balance tliesi Ives to  
astonishment. JVo description can equal the  
reality. They are daily trained to it from ear­  
ly infancy, at a royal academy, instituted lor  
that purpose. You will very often see little  
creatures, not more than seven of eight years  
old, as undauntedly performing their parts as  
the eldest among them. Shall I speak a truth,  
and say that repeatedly seeing these dances has  
worn oil&#x27; that disgust, which I at tirst felt, and  
that I see them now with pleasure? Yet, when  
I consider the tendency of these things, the  
passions they must excite, and the known  
character, even to a proverb, which is attached  
to an opera girl, my abhorrence is not lessened,  
and neither my reason nor judgment has ac­  
companied my sensibility in acquiring an, de­  
gree of callousness. The art ot dancing is car­  
ried to the highest degree of peri-ction that it  
is capable 01. At the opera, the house is nei­  
ther so grand, nor of so beautiful architecture,  
as the French theatre, but it is more frequented  
by the beau monde, who had rather be amused  
than instructed. The scenery is more various  
and more highly decorated, the dresses more  
costly and rich. And O! the music, vocal  
and instrumental, it has a soft, persuasive  
power, and a dying sound. Conceive a highly­  
decorated building, tilled with youth, beauty,  
grace, ease, clad in all the most pleasing and  
various ornaments of dress, which fancy can  
form; these objects singing like cherubs-To the  
best tuned-instruments, most skilfully handled,  
the softest, tendered strains; every attitude  
corresponding with the music; full of the god  
or goddess whom they celebrate; the female  
voices accompanied by an equal number of  
Adonises. Think you that this city can fail  
of becoming a Cylhera, and this bouse a tem­  
ple of Venus?  
&#x27;When music softens, and when d.-ncing fires,&#x27;  
it requires the immortal shield of the invinci­  
ble Mineiva, to screen youth from the arrows  
which assail them on every side.  
&#x27;As seon as a girl sets her foot upon the floor  
of the opera, she is excommunicated by the  
Church, and denied burial in hdy ground. She  
conceives nothing worse can happen to her; all  
restraint is thrown off, and she delivers herself  
to the first who bids high enough for her. but  
let me turn from a picture of which the out­  
lines are but just sketched; I would willingly

often see littlte creatures, not more than sev­

I sec them now with pleasure ? Yet, when  
I consider the tendency of these things,  
the passions they must excite, and the  
known character, even to a proverb, which  
is attached to an opera girl, my abhorrence  
is not lessened, and neither my reason nor  
judgment has accompanied my sensibility  
in acquiring any degree ot callousness.  
The art of dancing is carried to the high  
est degree of perfection that it is capable  
of. At the opera, the house is neither so  
grand, nor of so beautiful architecture, as  
the French theatre, but it is more frc  
qucnted by the beau monde, who had rather  
be amused than instructed. 1 he scenery  
is more various and more highly decorated,  
the dresses more costly and rich. And  
Oh I the music, vocal and instrumental : it  
has a soft persuasive power ; and a dying  
sound. Conceive a highly decorated build­  
ing, filled with youth, beauty, grace, ease,  
clad in all the most pleasing and various  
ornaments of dress, which fancy can form;  
these objects singing like cherubs to the  
best tuned instruments, most skilfully han  
dled, the softest tenderest strains, every  
attitude corresponding with the music ; full  
of the god or goddess whom they celebrate;  
the lomalc voices accompanied by an equal  
number 01 Adonises. 1 Innk you this citv

&quot; .My Dkui Sitkk. This day e ight  
months I sailed f r E.irope, since winch  
I many new and interesting scnus Iviv.  
presented themselves before&#x27; me. Iliave  
seen many of the beauties, and some ol  
tho eleforinilie ?, of this old world. I have  
b&#x27;vn more than ever coiii&#x27;inci d, th:it  
there h no summit of virtue, and no depth  
of vice, which human&#x27; nature is not capa­  
ble of rising to on the one h;iiir of sink­  
ing into on the other. I have found on  
the force of an observation, which I have  
had, that daily example is the most subt­  
le of all poisons. I have found my taste  
reconciling itself to habits, customs, and  
fashions which at first disgusted me.  
Tho first dance which I saw upon the  
stage shocked rie ; the dresses and beau­  
ty ol the performers were enchanting,  
hut no .looner did the dance commence,  
than I felt my delicacy wounded, wiiel I  
was asharned to be seen to look at them.  
Girls, clothed in the thinnest silk and  
  
gauze, with their petticoats short, spring­  
ing two feet from the floor, passing them­  
selves in the air, with their feet flying,  
and as perfectly sjiowtng their garters  
and drawers as though no pett coal had  
been worn, was a sight altogether new  
to me. Their motions are as light a  
air and as quick as lightning; they bal­  
ance themselves to astonishment. No  
description can equal the reality They  
arc daily trained to it from earl v infaticv,  
at a royal academy, instituted for that  
purpose. You will very often see little  
creatures, no more than seven or eight  
years old, as undauntedly performing  
their part9 as the eldest among them.  
Shall I speak a truth, and sav that repea­  
tedly seeing these dances has worn edT

I see them now with pleasure? Yet, when
