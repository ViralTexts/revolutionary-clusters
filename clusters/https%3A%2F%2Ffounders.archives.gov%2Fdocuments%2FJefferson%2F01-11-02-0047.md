. This event, which will hardly excite any attention in America, is deemed here the most important one which has taken place in their civil line during the present century. Some promise their country great things from it, some nothing. Our friend de la fayette was placed on the list originally. Afterwards his name disappeared: but finally was reinstated. This shews that his character here is not considered as an indifferent one; and that it excites agitation. His education in our school has drawn on him a very jealous eye from a court whose principles are the most absolute despotism. But I hope he has nearly passed his crisis. The king, who is a good man, is favorably disposed towards him: and he is supported by powerful family connections, and by the public good will. He is the youngest man of the Notables, except one whose office placed him on the list.

d. He is a great and good minister, and an accident to him might endanger the peace of Europe.  
The tumults in America, I expected would have produced in Europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has  not. On the contrary, the small effect of those tumults seems to have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the opinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves. The people are the only censors of their governors: and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution. To punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro’ the channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did any where. Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves and sheep. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. Do not be too severe upon their errors, but reclaim them by enlightening them. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress, and Assemblies, judges and governors shall all become wolves. It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions; and experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich on the poor.—The want of news has led me into disquisition instead of narration, forgetting you have every day enough of that.

ol Ibe people themselves on the side of government

To punish these error# loo severely would be to snp

way to prevent these irregular tmerpoiHonsof the peo­

Jefferson’s Opinion of Newpapers.  
  
The great apostle of Democracy in this coun-  
try, seems to have caught a prophetic glimpse of  
the future power of Newspapers, and to have en-  
tertained a high opinion of their influence in con-  
trolling our national affairs. Ina letter from Pa-  
ris to Col. Carrington, soon after the close of the  
revolutionary war, in relation to the insurrection-  
ary movements then occurring in the Eastern  
States, he says:  
  
I am persuaded myself, that the good sense of  
the people will always be found to be the best  
army. They may be led astray for a moment,  
but will soon correct themselves. The people  
are the only censors of their governors; and even  
their errors will tend to keep these to the true  
principles of their institution. To punish these  
errors too severely, would be to suporess the on-  
ly safeguard of the public liberty. The way to  
prevent those irregular interpositions of the peo-  
ple, is to give them full information of their affairs,  
through the channel of the public papers, and to  
contrive that those papers should penetrate the  
whole mass of the people. The basis of our gov-  
ernment being the opinion of the peop!e, the very  
first object should be to keep that right ; and were  
it left for me to decide, whether we should have  
a government without newspapers, or newspapers  
without a government, I should not hesitate a  
moment to prefer the /after. But I should mean  
that every man should receive those papers, and

i’aris, will In fon ml quite appropu» to the  
present stale of affairs :  
“The tumults in America (the Shay in­  
surrection in Mass.) I expected would  
have produced in Europe an unfavorable  
opinion of our political Mlate. Hut it has  
not. On the contrary, the small effects of  
these tumults seem to have given more  
confidence in the firmness of our govern­  
ment. The interposition of the people  
themselves on the side of government has  
had a great effect on the opinion here.—  
1 am persuaded that the good sense of the  
people will always be found to he the best  
army. They may be led astray for a mo­  
ment, but will soon correct themselves.  
“The people are the only censors of  
their governors; and even their errors  
will tend U&gt; keep thvse to the true princi­  
ples of their institution!!. To punish these  
errors too severely would lie to suppress  
the only safeguard of the public liberty.  
The way to prevent these irregular inter­  
positions of the people, is to give them full  
information of their affairs through the  
channel of the public papers, and to con­  
trive that those papers should penetrate  
the w hole mass of the people.  
“The basis of our government being

were it left to me to decide whether we  
should have a government without news­

prefer the Utter. Uut I should mean that  
every man should receive those papers and  
be capable of reading them.  
“ I am convinced that those societies  
(as Indians) which&#x27;ltve without govern  
meni, enjoy in their general mass, an in­  
finitely greater degree of happiness than  
Illuse who live under the Europenn Gov­  
ernments. Among the former, public  
opinion is in the place of law, and restrains  
morals as powerfully as law s ever did any­  
where.  
“ Among the latter, under the pretence  
of governing, they have divided their na­  
tions into two classes, wolves and sheep.  
“ 1 do not exaggerate. This is a true  
picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the  
spirit of our people, and keep alive their

one of these Judges is asking the  
people to elevate him for fifteen years  
to the sacred Bench of Justice.  
We have long since anticipated the  
London Times in its hope that &quot;the  
consciousness of existing evils will  
lead to the way of correcting them.&quot;  
To rouse that consciousness is the  
most sacred office of the public press,  
and its power to do it is so vital to  
the interests of society, that Jefferson  
said:  
Wero it left to me to decide  
&quot;whether we should have a govern-  
&quot;ment without newspapers, or news.  
&quot;papers without a government, I  
&quot;should not hesitate a moment to

&quot;mean that every man should receive  
&quot;those papers, and be capable of  
&quot;reading them.(Letter of Thomas  
&quot;Jefferson, January 16, 1787.)  
Now it is this, the highest sunction  
of the press, which we strive to per­  
form, fearlessly and fully; and if not  
always dispassionately--for we pre  
tend to no complacent tolerance of  
the crimes we reprehend- yet we  
hope always justly, and under the  
deepest sense of responsibility for the  
truth of what we utter.-p

situated, our rulers are eminently amen-  
able to the popular will. and if they out-  
rage or defy the behests of their constit-  
uents, debasement from office is the fate  
which will overtake them. So much  
was Thomas Jefferson, the most abused  
man of his day, impressed with the im-  
portance of newspapers, that in a letter  
to Colonel E. Carrington he says:  
  
‘*T am persuaded myself that the good  
sense of the people will always be found  
to be the best army. They may be led  
astray for a moment, but will soon cor-  
rect themselves. The people are the  
censors of their governors; and even  
their errors will tend to keep these to  
the true principles of their institution.  
To punish these errors too severely would  
be to suppress the only safeguard of the  
public liberty. The way to prevent  
irregular interpositions of the people is  
to give them full information of their  
affairs through the channel of the public  
papers, and to contrive that those papers  
should penetrate the whole mass of the  
people. The basis of our government  
being the opinion of the people, the very  
first object should be to keep that right,  
and were it left me to decide whether we  
should have a government without news-  
papers, or newspapers without a govern-

Some promise their country great things from it; some  
nothing. Our friend de La Fayette was placed on the list  
originally. Afterwards his name disappeared, but finally  
was re-instated. This shows that his character here is not  
considered as an indifferent one, and that it excites agita-

very jealous eye from a court whose principles are the most  
absolute despotism. But I hope he has nearly passed this

My Dear Sir:—I am persuaded,  
; myself, that the good sense of the  
people will be the best army. They  
may be led astray for a moment, but  
will soon correct themselves, The |  
people are the only uensorS of their  
government; and even their errors  
will tend to keep those to the true  
principles of their instutioni. To  
punish errors too severely  
would be to sup press th» only safe­  
guard of the public liberty.  
The way to prevent these irregu-&#x27;  
lar interpositions of the people is to  
give them full information of their  
affairs through the channel oi the |  
public papers, and to contrive that  
.those papers should penetrate the;  
! whole mass of the people, basis of.  
• our government being tlie opinion&#x27;  
!of the people. The very first object  
should be to keep that right, and  
wer« it left to me to decide whether |  
;we should have a government with-i  
out newspapers or newspapers with- i  
| out a government, I should not hes-!  
itate a moment to prefer the latter.  
But I should mean that every man ;  
should receive those papers and be  
capable of reading them. I am 4  
convinced that those societies (as \
: the Indians) which live without­  
government, enjoy in their general  
j mass an infinitely greater degree of  
happiness than those who &quot;live under&#x27;

the former, public opinion is in the

Among the latter under pretense of
