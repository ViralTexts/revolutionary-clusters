6th. Before Morning the Trenches were in such forwardness as to cover the Men from the enemys fire. The work was executed with so much secresy &amp; dispatch that the enemy were, I believe, totally ignorant of our labor till the light of the Morning discovered it to them. Our loss on this occasion was extremely inconsiderable, not more than one Officer (french) &amp; about 20 Men killed &amp; Wounded—the Officer &amp; 15 of which were on our left from the Corps of the Marqs. de St. Simond, who was betrayed by a deserter from the Huzzars that went in &amp; gave notice of his approaching his parrallel.  
  
  
The trenches were opened between 500 and 600 yards from the British works, and the first parallel, supported by four redoubts (two on American ground, two on French), ran from the center of the enemy’s works to the York River (TILGHMAN [3]Memoir of Lieut. Col. Tench Tilghman, Secretary and Aid to Washington, together with an Appendix, containing Revolutionary Journals and Letters, Hitherto Unpublished. 1876. Reprint. New York, 1971., 104). On the night of 6 Oct. the British concentrated their fire on a trench opened on the French left and on the redoubts on Pigeon

eek.  
  
  
  
  
7th. &amp; 8th. Was employed in compleating our Parallel—finishing the redoubts in them and establishing Batteries.  
  
  
  
9th. About 3 o’clock P.M. the French opened a battery on our extreme left, of 4 Sixteen pounders, and Six Morters &amp; Hawitzers and at 5 oclock an American battery of Six 18s &amp; 24s; four Morters &amp; 2 Hawitzers, began to play from the extremity of our right—both with good effect as they compelled the Enemy to withdraw from their ambrazures the Pieces which had previously kept up a constant firing.  
  
  
According to Dr. James Thacher, “his Excellency General Washington put the match to the first gun, and a furious discharge of cannon and mortars immediately followed, and Earl Cornwallis has received his first salutation” (THACHERJames Thacher. Military Journal of the American Revolution, From the commencement to the disbanding of the American Army; Comprising a detailed account of the principal events and Battles of the Revolution, with their exact dates, And a Biographical Sketch of the most Prominent Generals. Hartford, 1862., 283).  
  
  
  
  
10th. The French opened two batteries on the left of our front parallel—one of 6 twenty four pounders, &amp; 2 Sixteens with 6 Morters &amp; Hawitzers—the other of 4 Sixteen pounders and the Americans two Batteries between those last mentioned &amp; the one on our extreme right the left of which containing 4 Eighteen pounders—the other two Mortars.  
The whole of the batteries kept an incessant fire—the Cannon at the Ambrazures of the enemy, with a view to destroy them—the Shells into the Enemy’s Works, where by the information of deserters they did much execution.  
The French battery on the left, by red hot shot, set fire to (in the course of the Night) the Charon frigate &amp; 3 large Transports which were entirely consumed.  
  
  
  
11th. The French opened two other batteries on the left of the parallel, each consisting of 3 Twenty four pounders. These were also employed in demolishing the Ambrazures of the enemys Works &amp; advancd Redoubts.  
Two Gentlemen—a Major Granchien &amp; Captn. D’Avilion being sent by Admiral de Grasse to reconnoiter the Enemys Water defences, &amp; state of the River at and near York, seemed favourably disposed to adopt the measure which had been strongly urged of bringing Ships above the Town &amp; made representations accordingly to the Count de Grasse.  
  
  
Guillaume Jacques Constant de Liberge de Granchain (1744–1805) had served as major général de l’escadre in the fleet, under the command  
  
of Admiral de Ternay, which brought Rochambeau to America. While at Newport he had been influential in planning French strategy. The other officer, a M. de la Villeon (see GW to de Grasse, 11 Oct. 1781, DLC:GW), is listed as a lieutenant de vaisseau on board de Grasse’s flagship, the Ville de Paris (COMBATTANTS FRANÇAISHenri Mérou. Les combattants français de la guerre américaine, 1778–1783. Paris, 1903., 109).  
  
  
  
  
12th. Began our second parallel within abt. 300 yards (&amp; in some places less) of the enemys lines and got it so well advanced in the course of the Night as to cover the Men before morning. This business was conducted with the same secresy as the former &amp; undertaken so much sooner than the enemy expected (we should commence a second parallel) that they did not by their conduct, &amp; mode of firing, appear to have had any suspicion of our Working parties till day light discovered them to their Picquets; nor did they much annoy the Trenches in the course of this day (the Parallel being opened last Night from the ravene in front, and on the right flank of the Enemy till it came near to the intersection of the line of fire from the American 4 Gun Battery to the enemy’s advanced redoubts on their left. The french Batteries fired over the second parallel.

13th. The fire of the enemy this Night became brisk—both from their Cannon and royals and more injurious to us than it had been; several Men being killed, and many wounded in the Trenches, but the works were not in the smallest degree retarded by it. Our Batteries were begun in the course of the Night and a good deal advanced.  
  
  
A royal was a small mortar carrying a shell with a diameter of 5·5 inches.  
  
  
  
  
14th. The day was spent in compleating our parallel, and maturing the Batteries of the second parallel. The old batteries were principally directed against the abattis &amp; salient angles of the enemys advanced redoubts on their extreme right &amp; left to prepare them for the intended assault for which the necessary dispositions were made for attacking the two on the left and,  
At half after Six in the Evening both were carried—that on  
  
their left (on the Bank of the river) by the Americans and the other by the French Troops. The Baron Viominel commanded the left attack &amp; the Marqs. de la fayette the right on which the light Infantry were employed.  
In the left redoubt (assaulted by the Americans) there were abt. 45 men under the command of a Major Campbell;  of which the Major a Captn. &amp; Ensign, with 17 Men were made Prisoners—But few were killed on the part of the Enemy &amp; the remainder of the Garrison escaped. The right Redoubt attacked by the French, consisted of abt. 120 Men, commanded by a Lieutenant Colo.—of these 18 were killed, &amp; 42 taken Prisoners—among the Prisoners were a Captain and two Lieutenants. The bravery exhibited by the attacking Troops was emulous and praiseworthy—few cases have exhibited stronger proofs of Intripidity coolness and firmness than were shown upon this occasion. The following is our loss in these attacks and since the Investiture of York.

15th. Busily employed in getting the Batteries of the Second parallel compleated, and fixing on New ones contiguous to the Redoubts which were taken last Night. Placed two Hawitzers in each of the Captured Redoubts wch. were opened upon the enemy about 5 oclock in the Afternoon.  
  
  
  
16th. About four O’clock this Morning the enemy made a Sortee upon our Second parallel and spiked four French pieces of Artillery &amp; two of ours—but the guards of the Trenches advancing quickly upon them they retreated precipitately. The Sally being made upon that part of the parallel which was guarded by the French Troops they lost an officer &amp; 12 Men killed and 1 Officer taken prisoner. The American loss was one Sergeant of Artillery (in the American battery) Wounded. The Enemy, it is said, left 10 dead and lost 3 Prisoners.  
About 4 Oclock this afternoon the French opened two Batteries of 2. 24s. &amp; four 16s. each. 3 pieces from the American grand battery were also opened—the others not being ready.

New Haven, 1954., 583–87). On the 16th, after the failure of Abercromby’s sortie had become apparent, Cornwallis made a last desperate attempt to escape the siege. He planned an attack on Choisy on Gloucester, hoping to break through his lines and march his troops north. Tarleton, already entrenched on Gloucester, sent 16 large boats across the river to ferry the British forces to Gloucester, since Cornwallis “hoped to pass the infantry during the night, abandoning our baggage and leaving a detachment to capitulate for the townspeople and for the sick and wounded, on which subject a letter was ready to be delivered to General Washington.” At this point a violent storm broke, driving the boats down the river.

17th. The French opened another Battery of four 24s. &amp; two 16s. and a Morter Battery of 10 Morters and two Hawitzers. The American grand Battery consisting of 12 twenty fours and Eighteen prs.—4 Morters and two Hawitzers.  
About ten Oclock the Enemy beat a parley and Lord Cornwallis proposed a cessation of Hostilities for 24 hours, that Commissioners might meet at the house of a Mr. Moore (in the rear of our first parallel) to settle terms for the surrender of the Posts  
  
of York and Gloucester. To this he was answered, that a desire to spare the further effusion of Blood would readily incline me to treat of the surrender of the above Posts but previous to the meeting of Commissioners I wished to have his proposals in writing and for this purpose would grant a cessation of hostilities two hours—Within which time he sent out A letter with such proposals (tho’ some of them were inadmissable) as led me to believe that there would be no great difficulty in fixing the terms. Accordingly hostilities were suspended for the Night &amp; I proposed my own terms to which if he agreed Commissioners were to meet to digest them into form.

18th. The Commissioners met accordingly; but the business was so procrastinated by those on their side (a Colo. Dundas &amp; a Majr. Ross) that Colo. Laurens &amp; the Viscount De Noailles who were appointed on our part could do no more than make the rough draft of the Articles which were to be submitted for Lord Cornwallis’s consideration.  
  
  
The British commissioners were Lt. Col. Thomas Dundas of the 80th Regiment of Foot (Royal Edinburgh Volunteers) and Maj. Alexander Ross, Cornwallis’s aide-de-camp. The American commissioners were Lt. Col. John Laurens and the vicomte de Noailles, mestre de camp en second of the Soissonnais Regiment and brother-in-law of Lafayette. The discussions dragged on through the day, and in late evening the commissioners reported that negotiations had been so protracted that an extension of the truce until 9:00 the next morning had been necessary.

21st. The prisoners began their March &amp; set out for the Fleet to pay my respects, &amp; offer my thanks to the Admiral for his important Services and to see if he could not be induced to further co-operations before his final departure from this Coast. Despairing from the purport of my former conferences with him, &amp; the tenor of all his letters, of obtaining more than a Convoy, I contented myself with representing the import, consequences and certain prospect of an attempt upon Charles town and requesting if his orders or other Engagements would not allow him to attend to that great object, that he would nevertheless transport a detachment of Troops to, &amp; cover their debarkation at Wilmington that by reducing the enemy’s post there we might give peace to another State with the Troops that would afterwards join the Southern army under the Command of Majr. Genl. Greene.  
Having promised the Command of the detachment destined for the Enterprize against Wilmington to the Marqs. de la Fayette in case he could engage the Admiral to convey it &amp; secure the debarkation I left him on Board the Ville de Paris to try the force of his influence to obtain these.

28th. Began to Embark the Ordnance and Stores for the above purpose.  
  
Received a Letter from the Count de Grasse, declining the Convoy he had engaged to give the detachment for Wilmington &amp; assigning his reasons for it. This after a suspence &amp; consequent delay of 6 or 7 days obliged me to prepare to March the Troops by Land under the command of M. Genl. St. Clair.  
In the Evening of this day Intilligence was received from the Count de Grasse that the British fleet was off the Capes, &amp; consisted of 36 Ships 25 of which were of the line &amp; that he had hove out the Signal for all his People to come on board &amp; prepare to Sail—but many of his Boats &amp; hands being on Shore it could not be effected.

destined for their reception, he went on board the Ville de Paris to pay  
his respects to the admiral, and to thank him for his important services.  
Aware from an earlier conference, that there was little hope of obtaining  
more than a convoy, he contented himself, to use the words of his inval-  
uable journal, “ with representing the important consequences and cer-  
tain prospect of an attempt upon Charleston, and requesting, if his  
orders or other engagements would not allow him to attend to that  
great object, that he would, nevertheless, transport a detachment of  
troops to, and cover their debarkation at, Wilmington, that by reducing  
the enemy’s post there we might give peace to another State with the  
troops that would afterwards join the Southern army under the com-  
mand of Major-General Greene,” who only awaited sufficient reinforce-  
ment before undertaking the siege of Charleston in form.  
  
The Marquis de Lafayette, to whom the command of the detachment  
destined for the attack upon Wilmington had been promised, accom-  
panied Washington on this visit to the fleet, and, according to the narra-  
tive of Cromot du Bourg, an aide of Rochambeau, the French general

October 6th — Before morning the  
Trenches were in such forwardness as to  
cover the men from the enemy’s fire—  
The work was executed with so much  
secresy &amp; dispatch that the enemy were,  
I believe, totally ignorant of our labor  
till the light of the morning discovered  
it to them.—Our loss on this occasion  
was extremely inconsiderable—not more  
than one officer (french) &amp; about 20  
men killed &amp; wounded—the officer &amp;  
15 of which were on our left from the  
corps of the Marqs. de St. Simond, who  
was betrayed by a deserter from the  
Huzzars that went in &amp; gave notice of  
his approaching his parrallel.  
  
129  
  
October 7th and 8th—Was employed  
in compleating our Parallel—finishing  
the redoubts in them and establishing  
Batteries.  
  
October gth—About 3 o&#x27;clock P. M.  
the French opened a battery on our ex-  
treme left of 4 sixteen pounders,and six  
Morters &amp; Howitzers—and at 5 o’clock  
an American battery of six 18s &amp; 24s;  
four Morters &amp; 2 Howitzers began to  
play from the extremity of our right.—  
both with good effect as they compelled  
the enemy to withdraw from their am-  
brazures the Pieces which had pre-  
viously kept up a constant firing.  
  
October 1oth—The French opened two  
batteries on the left of our front par-  
allel—one of 6 twenty-four pounders, &amp;  
2 sixteens with 6 Morters &amp; Howitzers  
—The other of 4 sixteen pounders.—  
And the Americans two Batteries be-  
tween those last mentioned &amp; the one  
on our extreme right, the left of which  
containing 4 eighteen pounders—the  
other two Mortars.  
  
The whole of the batteries kept  
an incessant fire—the cannon at the  
ambrazures of the enemy, with a view  
  
to destroy them—The shells into the  
enemy’s works where by the _infor-  
  
mation of deserters, they did much exe-  
cution.  
  
The French battery on the left, by  
red hot shot, set fire to, (in the course  
of the Night) the Charon frigate &amp; 3  
large Transports which were entirely  
consumed.  
  
October 11th—The French opened two  
other batteries on the left of the par-  
allel, each consisting of 3 Twenty-four  
pounders—these were also employed in  
  
  
  
130  
demolishing the ambrazures of the  
enemy’s works &amp; advancd Redoubt.  
  
Two Gentlemen—a Major Granchier  
&amp; Captn D’Avilier being sent by Ad-  
miral de Grasse to reconnoiter the  
enemy’s water defences and state of the  
river at and near York, seemed fa-  
vorably disposed to adopt the measure,  
which had beeu strongly urged, of bring-  
ing ships above the town, and made  
representations accordingly to the Count  
de Grasse.  
  
October 12th—Began our second par-  
allel within about 300 yards (and in some  
places less) of the enemy’s lines—and got  
it so well advanced in the course of the  
night as to cover the men before morning.  
—This business was conducted with the  
same secresy as the former, and under-  
taken so much sooner than the enemy  
expected (we should commence a second  
parallel), that they did not, by their con-  
duct and mode of firing, appear to have  
had any suspicion of our working parties  
till daylight discovered them to their  
Picquet ; nor did they much annoy the  
Trenches in the course of this day (the  
Parallel being opened last night from the  
ravine in front, and on the right flank of  
the enemy, till it came near to the inter-  
section of the line of fire from the Ameri-  
can 4 gun Battery to the enemy’s ad-  
vanced redoubt on their left. The  
French Batteries fired over the second  
parallel.  
  
October 13th—The fire of the enemy  
this night became brisk—both from their  
cannon and royals—and ‘more injurious  
to us than it had been; several men  
being killed, and many wounded, in the  
Trenches, but the works were not in the  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
smallest degree retarded by it—our bat-  
teries were begun in the course of the  
night, and a good deal advanced.  
  
October 14th—The day was spent in  
compleating our parallel and maturing  
the Batteries of the second parallel—the  
old batteries were principally directed  
against the abattis and salient angles of  
the enemy’s advanced redoubts on their  
extreme right and left, to prepare them  
for the intended assault for which the  
necessary dispositions were made for  
attacking the two on the left, and,  
  
At half after six in the evening both  
were carried—that on their left (on the  
Bank of the river) by the Americans, and  
the other by the French Troops. The  
Baron Viominel commanded the left  
attack &amp; the Marq’s de la Fayette the  
right, on which the light Infantry were  
employed.  
  
In the left redoubt (assaulted by the  
Americans) there were abt 45 men under  
the command of a Major Campbell; of  
which the Major, a Captn. and Ensign,  
with 17 men, were made Prisoners. But  
few were killed on the part of the enemy,  
&amp; the remainder of the Garrison escaped.  
The right redoubt, attacked by the  
French, consisted of abt 120 men, com-  
manded by a Lieutenant-Colonel—of  
these 18 were killed &amp; 42 taken Prison-  
ers. Among the Prisoners were a Cap-  
tain and two Lieutenants. The bravery  
exhibited by the attacking Troops was  
emulous and praiseworthy—few cases  
have exhibited stronger proofs of In-  
tripidity, coolness and firmness than were  
shown upon this occasion. The follow-  
ing is our loss in these attacks, and since  
the Investiture of York :

October 15¢h—Busily employed in get-  
ting the Batteries of the second parallel  
compleated, and fixing on new ones con-  
tiguous to the Redoubts which were  
taken last night—placed two Howitzers  
in each of the captured redoubts, wch  
were opened upon the enemy about 5  
o’clock in the afternoon.  
  
131  
  
October 16¢h—About four o’clock this  
morning, the enemy made a Sortee upon  
our second parallel and spiked four  
French pieces of Artillery and two of  
ours, but the guards of the Trenches ad-  
vancing quickly upon them, they re-  
treated precipitately. The Sally being  
made upon that part of the parallel which  
was guarded by the French Troops—they  
lost an officcr and 12 men killed and 1  
officer taken prisoner. The American  
loss was one Sergeant of Artillery (in  
the American Battery) wounded. The  
enemy, it is said, left 10 dead and lost 3  
Prisoners.  
  
About 4 o’clock this afternoon the  
French opened two Batteries of 2 24s &amp;  
four 16s each—3 pieces from the Ameri-  
can grand battery were also opened, the  
others not being ready.  
  
October 17th—The French opened an-  
other Battery of four 24s &amp; two 16s  
and a Morter Battery of 10 Morters and  
two Howitzers—The American grand  
Battery consisting of 12 twenty-four and  
eighteen prs, 4 Morters and two Howit-  
zers.  
  
About ten o’clock the enemy beat a  
parley, and Lord Cornwallis proposed a  
cessation of Hostilities for 24 hours,  
that Commissioners might meet at the  
house of a Mr. Moore (in the rear of  
our first parallel) to settle terms for the  
Surrender of the Posts of York and  
Gloucester.—To this he was answered,  
that a desire to spare the further effu-  
sion of Blood would readily incline me  
to treat of the Surrender of the above  
Posts—but previous to the meeting of  
Commissioners, I wished to have his  
proposals in writing, and for this pur-  
pose would grant a cessation of hostili-  
  
  
  
132  
  
ties two hours—Within which time he  
sent out A letter with such proposal  
(tho’ some of them were inadmissible)  
as led me to believe that there would be  
no great difficulty in fixing the terms—  
accordingly hostilities were suspended  
for the night &amp; I proposed my own terms  
to which, if he agreed, commissioners  
were to meet to digest them into  
form.  
  
October 18th—The Commissioners met  
accordingly; but the business was so  
procrastinated by those on their side (a  
Colo. Dundas &amp; a Maj’r Ross) that  
Colo. Laurens &amp; the Viscount de  
Noailles, who were appointed on our  
part could dono more than make the  
rough draft of the articles which were  
to be submitted for Lord Cornwallis’s  
consideration.  
  
October 19th—In the morning early I  
had them copied and sent word to Lord  
Cornwallis that I expected to have them  
signed at 11 o’clock—and that the Gar-  
rison would march out at two o’clock—  
both of which were accordingly done—  
two redoubts on the enemy’s left being  
possessed (the one by a detachment of  
French Grenadiers, &amp; the other by  
American Infantry), with orders to pre-  
vent all intercourse between the army  
&amp; Country and the Town.—While  
officers in the several departments were  
employed in taking acc’t of the public  
stores, &amp;c.—  
  
October 20th—W inchester &amp; Fort Fred-  
erick in Maryland, being the places des-  
tined for the reception of the Prisoners,  
they were to have commenced their  
march accordingly this day, but were  
prevented by the Commissary of  
Prisoners not having compleated his  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
accounts of them &amp; taken the paroles

October 21st—The prisoners began  
their march &amp; I set out for the Fleet to  
pay my respects &amp; offer my thanks to  
the Admiral for hisimportant services—  
and to see if he could not be induced to  
further co-operations before his final  
departure from this coast—despairing  
from the purport of my former Confer-  
ence with him, &amp; the tenor of all his  
letters of obtaining more thana convoy,  
  
‘I contented myself with representing the  
  
import[ant] consequences and certain  
prospects of an attempt upon Charles-  
town, and requesting if his orders, or  
other engagements would not allow him  
to attend to that great object, that he  
would nevertheless transport a detach-  
ment of Troops to, &amp; cover their de-  
barkation at Wilmington that by reduc-  
ing the enemy’s post there, we might  
give peace to another State with the  
Troops that would afterwards join the  
Southern Army under the Command of  
Maj’r Genl. Greene.—  
  
Having promised the command of the  
detachment destined for the enterprise  
against Wilmington to the Marq’s de la  
Fayette in case he could engage the  
Admiral to convey it &amp; secure the de-  
barkation, I left him on Board the Ville  
de Paris to try the force of his influence  
to obtain these.

October 24th—Received advice by  
Express from General Forman of the  
British Fleet in the Harbour of New  
York consisting of 26 sail of the line,  
Some 50s &amp; 44s—many frigates—fire  
ships &amp; Transports, mounting in the

upon the point of Sailing for Chesa-

municated to the Count de Grasse.  
  
From this time to the 28th was em-  
ployed in collecting and taking an acc’t  
of the different species of stores which  
were much dispersed and in great dis-  
order.  
  
All the vessels in public employ in  
the River James River were ordered

transporting stores, &amp;c., to the Head of  
Elk.

October 28th—Began to Embark the  
Ordnance and Stores for the above pur-  
pose.  
  
Received a Letter from the Count de  
Grasse, declining the convoy he had en-  
gaged to give the detachment for Wil-  
mington &amp; assigning his reasons for it.  
—This after a suspence and consequent  
delay of 6 or 7 days, obliged me to pre-  
pare to march the Troops by land under  
the command of M. Genl. St. Clair.  
  
In the Evening of this day Intelli-  
gence was received from the Count de  
Grasse that the British fleet was off the  
Capes, &amp; consisted of 36 Ships, 25 of  
which were of the line, &amp; that he had  
hove out the Signal for all his people to  
come on board &amp; prepare to Sail—but  
many of his Boats &amp; hands being on  
shore, it could not be effected.  
  
October 29th—The British Fleet still  
  
133  
  
appeared in the offing without the Capes,  
but, the wind being unfavourable, and  
other causes preventing, the French  
Fleet kept to their moorings within.—  
  
In the Evening of this day the former  
fleet disappeared, &amp; Count de Grasse  
engaged to remain a few days in the  
Bay to cover the water transport of our  
stores and Troops up the Bay to the  
River Elk.  
  
From this time to the 5th of Nov’r  
was employed in embarking the Ord-  
nance and stores and the Troops which  
were returning to the Northward—pre-  
paring the detachment for the South-  
ward—providing clothing and stores for  
the Army commanded by Maj’r Gen’l  
Greene—depositing a magazine at West-  
ham[pton] for the use of the Southern  
States—and making other necessary ar-  
rangements previous to the division  
of the army and my return to the  
North River—also in marching off 467  
convalescents from the British Hospital  
under escort of Courtlandt’s York Reg-  
iment for Fredericksburg on their way  
to join their respective Regiments at  
Winchester and Fort Frederick in Mary-  
land.
