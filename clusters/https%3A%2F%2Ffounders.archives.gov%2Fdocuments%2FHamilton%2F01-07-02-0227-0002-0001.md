d other buildings of the dealers in excised articles. But by that the plan proposed the officers to be employed are to be cloathed with no such summary jurisdiction, and their discretionary power of visiting and searching is to be restricted to those places, which the Dealers themselves shall designate by public insignia or marks as the depositories of the articles on which the duties are to be laid. Hence it is one of the recommendations of the plan that it steers clear of it is not liable to those objections.  
Duties of the kind here proposed as has been before intimated are not novel in the United States; as has been intimated in another place. They have obtained under existed to a considerable extent, under several of the state governments, particularly in Massachusettes Connecticut and Pensylvania. In Connecticut, a state exemplary for its attachment to popular principles, not only all ardent spirits but foreign articles of consumption generally have been the subjects of an excise, or inland duty.  
If the supposition that duties of this kind are attended are attended with greater expence in the collection, than taxes on land, should seem an argument for preferring the latter, it may be observed that the fact ought not too readily to be taken for granted. The state of things in England is sometimes referred to as an example on this point. But there the smallness of the expence in the collection of the land tax is to be ascribed to the peculiar modification of it; which proceeding without new assessments according to a fixed standard not long since adjusted, totally disregards the comparitive value of lands and the variations in their value. The consequence of this is an inequality, so palpable and extreme, as would be likely to be ill relished by the land holders of the United States. If in pursuit of greater equality, accurate periodical valuations and or assessments are to afford a rule, it may be well be doubted whether the expence of a land tax will not always exceed that of the kind of duties proposed.  
The ingenious but fallacious hypothesis that all taxes on consumption fall finally with accumulated weight on land is now too generally and too

f capital and industry contribute their proportion to the revenue; and consequently that as far as they can be made substitutes for taxes on lands they serve to exempt it them from an undue share of the public burthen.

afety. It will be a consolatory reflection, that so capital a resource remains untouched by that provision; which, while it will have a very sensible influence in favour of public Credit, will be materially conducive to the tranquillity of the Public mind, in respect to external danger, and will truly really operate as a powerful guarantee of peace. In proportion as the estimation of our resources is exalted in the eyes of foreign Nations, the respect for us must increase; which will and this must beget a proportionable caution neither to insult nor injure us with levity. The While on the contrary the appearance of exhausted resources, to satisfy obligations contracted for the past (which would be very apt likely to be produced by perhaps be a consequence of mortgaging the revenue of to be derived from land for the interest of the public debt) would might tend to invite both insult and injury, but by inspiring an opinion, that our efforts to resent or repel them were little to be dreaded.

There is at least satisfactory evidence, that they cannot be extended further without contravening the sense of the body of the Merchants; and though it is not to cannot be admitted as a general rule that this circumstance ought to conclude against the expediency of a public measure; yet when a due regard to is had to when the disposition which that enlightened class of citizens has manifested towards the National government, to the alacrity chearfulness with

eady taken place in the former state of things, there will be perceived to exist the most solid reasons against lightly passing the bounds, which coincide with their impressions of reasonableness what is reasonable and eligible. proper It would be in every view inauspicious to give occasion for a supposition that Trade alone is destined to feel the immediate weight of the immediate hand of government in every new emergency exigency of the Treasury.  
However true as a general position that the Consumer pays the duty; yet to make the advances it will not follow that Trade may not be essentially distressed and injured by carrying duties on importation to a height which is disproportioned to the Mercantile Capital of the a Country. It may not only be the cause of diverting too large a large share of it from the exigencies of business; but the requisite advances which they require will be requisite to satisfy the duties will in many if not in most cases precede the receipts from the product sale of the articles subject to duty on which they are laid imposed and the consequence will often either be a pos often be sacrifices which cannot be afforded the Merchant cannot afford to make.. The inconveniences of them exceeding the salutary proper limit in this respect, &amp; which will be felt every where will be peculiarly grievous in particularly will fall with particular severity on those places which have not the advantage of public banks &amp; which abound least less in pecuniary resources. Appearances do not justify such an estimate of the extent of the Mercantile capital of the United States as to encourage to material accumulations on the already considerable rates of the duties, on the mass of foreign importations.  
Another motive for caution, on this point arises results, from the reflection, that that the effect of an important augmentation, made by a law of the last session, is hitherto a mere matter of speculative calculation, and has not yet even begun to be tried.  
It is presumeable too that a still further augmentation would have an influence the reverse of favourable to the public Credit. The operation would be apt to be regarded as artificia

diferetionary power of fearching was to be reftricted to thofe places, which the deal-  
ers themfelves fhould defignate, as the depofitories of the dutied articles, Duties of  
this kind were by no means novelin the United States. ‘They had been laid by fe-  
veral of the State governments, particularly in Peanlylvania, Maflachufetts, and Con-  
necticut. In the laft, all foreign articles of confumption, generally, had been fubje&amp;  
te an excife or inland duty.  
  
The next object of the Secretary’s arguments was, to fhow that an excife would be  
preferable to aland-tax. “ If, faid he, the fuppofition that taxcs of this kind are at-  
tended with greater expence in the collectien than taxes on land, fhould feem an ar-  
gument for preferring the latter; it may be obferved, the fa&amp; ought not too readily  
to be taken for granted. ‘The ftate of thingsin England is fometimes referred to as  
an example on this point. But there the fmallnefs of the expence in the collection of  
the iJand-tax, is to. be afcribed to the peculiar modification of it ; which proceeding  
without new affefiments, according to a fixed ftlandard, long fince adjufted, totally  
difregards the comparative value of lands, and the variationsin their value. The con-  
fequence of this is an inequality, fo palpable and extreme, as would be likely to be ill  
relifhed by the landholders of the United States. If, in purfuit of greater equality, ac-  
curate periodical valuations or aff.ffments are to afford a rule, it may well be doubted  
whether the expence of a laud tax will not always exceed that of the kind of dutics  
propofed.”
