.  
The arrival of the J. Adams brought your letters of the following dates . From that of the 16th. April, it appears that the seizures of Amn. property lately made, had been followed up by its actual sale, &amp; that the proceeds had been deposited in the Emperors Caisse prive. You have presented in such just colours the enormity of the outrage, that I have only to signify to you that the P entirely approves the step taken by you, &amp; that he does not doubt that it will be followed by yourself, or the person succeeding to the duty, with any further interpositions which may be deemed advisable. He instructs you, particularly, to make the F Govt. sensible of the deep impression made here by so signal an aggression on the principles of justice &amp; of good faith, &amp; to demand every reparation of which the case is susceptible. If it be not the purpose of the F. Govt. to renoun⟨ce⟩ every idea of friendly adjustment with the U. S. it wd. seem impossible but that a reconsideration of this violent proceeding, must lead to a redress of it, as a preliminary to a general accomodation of the differences between the two Nations.  
At the date of the last communications from Mr. P. he had not obtained from the B. Govt. an acceptance of the condition on which the F. Govt. was willing to concur in putting an end to all the illegal Edicts of both agst. our neutral commerce. Should he have afterwards succeeded, you will of course on receiving the fact, immediately claim from the F. G. the fulfilment of its promise; and by transmitting it to Mr. P. co-operate with him in compleating the removal of all the illegal obstructions to our commerce.  
Among the documents now sent, is another copy of the Act of Congs. repealing the non-intercourse law; but authorizing a renewal of it, agst. G. B. in case F shall repeal her Edicts; &amp; G. B. refuse to follow the example; &amp; vice versa. You have been already informed that the P. is ready to exercise the power vested in him for such a purpose, as soon as the occasion shall arise. Should the other experiment in the hands of Mr. P. have failed, you will make the Act of Congs. and the disposition of the P. the subject of a formal communication to the F. Govt. and it is not easy to conceive any grounds even specious on which the overture specified in the Act can be declined.  
If the non-intercourse law, in any of its modifications, was objectionable to the Emperor of the French, that law no longer exists.  
If he be ready, as has been declared in the letter of the D. de Cadore of Feby. 14, to do justice to the U. S. in the case of a pledge on their part, not to submit to the B. Edicts, the opportunity for making good the declaration is now furnished. Instead of submission, the P. is ready, by renewing the Non-intercourse agst. G. B. to oppose to her orders in Council a measure of a character, which ought to satisfy every reasonable expectation. Should it be necessary for you to meet the question, whether the non-intercourse will be renewed agst. G. B. in case she should not comprehend in a repeal of her Edicts, her Blockades, not consistent with the L. of Nations, you may, if found necessary, let it be understood that a repeal of the illegal Blockades, prior to the Berlin Decree, namely that of May 1806, will be included in the condition required of G. B.: that particular blockade having been avowed to be comprehended in &amp; of course identified with the orders in Council.  
With respect to Blockades, of subsequent date or not agst. France, you will press the reasonableness of leaving them, together with future blockades not warranted by pub. law, to be proceeded agst. by the U. S in the manner they may chuse to adopt. As has been heretofore stated to you, a satisfactory provision for restoring the property lately surprized &amp; seized by the order or at the instance of the F. Govt. must be combined with a repeal of the F Edicts, with a view to a non-intercourse with G. B.: such a provision being an indispensible evidence of the just purposes of F. towards the U. S. And you will moreover be careful, in arranging such a provision for that particular case of spoliations, not to weaken the ground on which a redress of others may be justly pursued.  
If the Act, in legalizing a free trade with both the Belligts.; witht. guarding agst. Bsh. interruptions of it with F. whilst F. can not materially interrupt it with G. B, be complained of as leaving the trade on the worst possible footing for F. &amp; on the best possible one for G. B, the F G. may be reminded of the other feature of the Act which puts it in their own power to obtain either an interruption of our trade with G. B. or a re⟨call⟩ of her interruption of it with F.  
Among the considns. which belong to this subject it may be remarked, that it might have been reasonably ⟨ex⟩pected by the U. S. that a repeal of the F. decrees, would have resulted from the B. Order in Council of Apl. 1809. This order, expressly revoked the preceding orders of Novr. 1807 heretofore urged by F. in justification of her Decrees, &amp; was not only different in its extent and in its details, but was essentially different in its policy &amp; object. The object of the orders of 1807, was by cutting off all commercial supplies, to retort on her Enemies, the distress, which the French Decree was intended to inflict on G. B. The object of the Order of Apl. 1809. was if not avowedly, most certainly, not to deprive F. of such supplies; but by arresting those from neutral sources, to favor a surreptitious monopoly to B. Traders. In order to counteract this object, it was the manifest interest of F. to have favored the rival &amp; cheaper supplies thro’ neutrals; instead of which she has co-operated with the monopolizing views of G. B. by a rigorous exclusion of neutrals from her ports. She has in fact reversed the operation originally professed by her Decrees. Instead of annoying her enemy, at the expence of a friend, she annoys a friend for the benefit of her enemy.  
Should the F. Govt. accede to the overture contained in the Act of Congs. by repealing or so modifying its Decrees as that they will cease to violate our neutral rights, you will transmit the repeal properly authenticated, to Mr. P. by a special messenger if necessary; and hasten &amp; ensure the receipt of it here, by engaging a vessel if no equivalent conveyance shd. offer, to bring it directly from F. and sending several copies to Mr. P. to be forwarded from B. Ports

&quot;1 he ayival of the J-hn Adams  
brought your letters of the 1st, W\. 7th and  
16th April.  
Fratn that of the 16th April, it appears,  
th,&lt;t »he seizu1 -2s ot the American property  
la&#x27;e&gt;y made had been followed b\ itsacual  
sale, and liat the proceeds had been dr &gt;ns  
iteil in the emperor&#x27;s ca’aae firive. V u  
have presented, in such just colors ..the en&lt; r  
; mity of ibis outiage that I have only to  
signify to you, that the President entirely  
; approves the s ep that lias been t.ken by  
you. and that he does not doubt that it wt I  
he followed by you, or ’he person who may  
succeed you with such further interposition,  
as may be deemed advisable He instructs  
you, particuiarlv, to make ihe Krencii gov  
»rnment sensible cf the derp impression  
, made here by so signal an aggression on the  
principles ot justice and of good faith; and  
I to demand every reparation of which the  
jaase is susceptible. If it be not the purpose  
i of the French government to remove every  
idea of friendly adjustment with the ET. S.  
it would seem impossible but that a teconsi.  
deration of this violent proceeding must lead  
to a redress ot it, as a preliminary to a gen.  
era! accommodation of the differences be­  
tween the two countries.  
At the date of the last communication  
from Mr. Pinkney, he had not obtained, from  
the British government, an acceptance of  
the condition, on which the French gov  
eminent w as willing toconcur, in putting an  
end to all the edicts ot both against our neu­  
tral commerce. If he should afterwards  
have succeeded, you will, ot course on re  
ceiving information of the fact immrdtaetly  
claim, from the French government, the ful  
fihnentof its promise ; and by transmitting  
the result to Mr, Pinkney, vou will coope,  
rate with him in completing the removal of  
all the illegal obstructions to our commerce.  
Among the documents, now sent, is anoj  
ther copy of the aci ofCnngi ess, repealing the  
non in ei course law, bu. authorising a re  
new .1 »&gt;t it against G, B. in case France  
sl.ali repeal her edicts, and G B. refuse to  
follow the example, and vice versa. You  
have been already informed that the Presi.  
dent is ready to exercise the power vested  
in him for snch a purpose, as soon as the oc­  
casion shail arise Should the other-experi­  
ment, in the hands of Mr. Pinkney, have  
failed, f nu will make the act of Congress,  
and he disposition of he President, the  
&quot;abject of a formal communication to the  
Fiench government, anil it is not easy to con.  
ceive any ground, even specious, on which  
the overture specified in the act can be de­  
clined.  
If he non intercourse law, in any of its  
modifiertions, was objectionable to the em­  
peror of ihe French, that law no longer ex  
tsts.  
  
If he be reedy, as has been declared, it)  
the letter of the duke of Cadore, of Febru­  
ary l*&#x27;h, to do justice to the U. b. in the  
case of a pledge on their part not to submit  
to the British edicts, the opportunity for  
makjng good ,he declaration ts now afford,  
ed. Instead of submission, the President is  
ready, by renewing the nofl.intercourst a. j  
gainst llren Britain, to oppose, to her or  
ders in council it measure, which is of a  
character that ought to satisfy any reasona  
hie expectation.  
If it should be necessary for you to meet  
th&lt; question, whether tlie Don*intercourse  
will he renewed ag.tinst Britain, in case !  
she should not comprehend in th&#x27;- repeal of  
her (diets her blockades, which.are not coa  
sistent \vf&#x27;h :he law &lt;»f nations, you may,  
should it be found nece-sary. let it be under­  
sto- il, that a repeal of the illegal block ides,  
of a date prior to the Berlin decree, name­  
ly, that of \lay, IfioO, will be included in  
the condition, required by Cireat Britain ;  
that pai ticular blockade Ikivu^ been avow.,  
cd to be comprehended in, and of course  
identified with, the ordeis in council. With  
respect to blockades of a subsequent d*ke,  
UV not against Prance, you will press the  
i easouabkiiess of leaving them, together with  
future blockades, not warranted by public  
law, to be proceeded against, by the United  
States, in the manner they may chose to  
adopt.  
As has been heretofore stated to you, a  
satisfactrry provision for restoring the pro  
periy lately surprised and se.f-ed by the or-,  
*  
  
%ef, A ft lie Instance, off the French p#e- i  
eminent, must be combined with a. icptal  
of the French edic&#x27;s, with a vi&lt;w to a n«&gt;n  
intercourse withG. Britain ; such a provisi  
on bemg an ind-&gt;pensibtc evidence of the  
just purpose of France towards the US —  
Atid you will, moreover, be cartful, in ar  
ranging such a provision for that particular  
case of spoliations, not to weaken die ground  
on which a redress of others inav be justly  
pursued.  
If the act of Congress, which has legalised  
a tree trade with both the belligerents, weh  
out. Ru*rding against British interruptions  
ot it with Fi ance, whilst France cannot ma  
terialiy interrup&#x27; it with G Britain, be c&gt;tn  
plained of, as leaving toe trade on the worst  
| possible footing for France, and on the best  
I possible one tor (i Britain the French gov  
!eminent may be reminded of the other f a_  
.ture of the act, which puts it in *hcir own  
j power to obtain either an interruption of our  
.trade with G. Britain, or a recal of her in­  
| ten option of it with F i.ir.e.  
Among the considerations which belong to  
tlu«&gt; -ubjert. it may l.-e remarked, that it  
might have been reasonably expec td. by  
the U S. that a repeal »f iv F.-e »c » de  
ciees would havt resulted from he Bri isli  
order in countil ,f April 1809. This oider  
expressly revoked tne pi (.ceding orders of  
November, 1807. heretofore urged by France  
in justification ot her decrees, and was not  
only different in- its extent and its details,  
but was essentially different in its policy.  
1 he policy of the orders of 1807 was, by  
cutting off all commercial supplies, to retort  
on her enemies the distress, which &#x27;the  
French decree was intended to inflict on G.  
Britain.  
The policy of the order of April 1809. if  
hot avowedly,,was most certainly to prevent  
such supplies, hy shutting out’those only,  
which migltt flow from neutral sources, in  
order thereby to favor a surreptitious mono, j  
poly to British traders. In order to coun !  
teract this policy, it was the manifest inter- j  
est ot France to have favored the rival and ]  
cheaper supplies through neutrals ; instead  
of which, she nas co-operated with the mo  
nopolising • lews ofG*eat Britain, by a rigo_  
mu« exclusion of rieu;rals from her ports_  
Sht has, in fact, reversed the operation, o  
riginally professed bv her decree Instead  
of annoying he enemy a&gt; the expence of a  
frirnd she annoys a friend tor the benefit j  
of her enemy.  
It the French government should accede !  
to the overture, contained in the act of (&#x27;.on - j  
g rss hy repeating or sn modifying its de- !  
C&#x27;ees, as that they will cease to violate &#x27;mr  
neutral rights you will, if necessary trails. !  
mit &#x27;he repeal, properly authenticated, to  
M’ • Pinkney, hy a spreial messenger ; and  
vnu will hasten and ensure the receipt ot it1  
here, bv engaging a vessel, if no equivalent 1  
r&#x27; rvp&#x27; &quot;&quot;re should off. r to bring it directly j  
f. oin France, and bv sending several copies .

®*r&lt; 1 he aniviil of the John A&#x27;fau.s brougl t  
your letters of the 1st, 4tb, 7th and 16&#x27;th April.  
I-roai that ol the l6\h April, it appears, that the  
seizures ol ttie American property,■lately made, tiad  
betn (..Unwed by its actual sal-,&#x27;and that tin pro­  
ceeds had been deposited in the Emperoi&#x27;s caisse  
price. You bave presented,in such just rotors, the  
enormity ol this outrage, that I have only to sig­  
nify to you, that the President entirely approv-s th»  
step that has been taken by yon, and that he dors  
not doubt that it will be followed by yon, or t; e  
person who may succeed you, with such furl hr  
interposition, as may be deemed advisable. He 10­  
mstructs yon, particularly, to make the Fr.nrh  
government sensible of the deep impression made  
here, by.so signal an aggression on tiie pr nriol-s  
,0! justice and good faith; and to demand every re­  
paration of which tbe case is susceptn.le. ll it be  
not the purpose of the I rench government to re­  
move every idea of friendly adjustment with the U.  
Stales, it would seem impossible but that a rerun­  
side ration ol Ihis violent proceeding must lead to a  
redrc-ss of it, as a preliminary to a&#x27;genet at accom­  
modation ut tbe differences between the two  
countiies.  
At the date of tbs last communication from Mr.  
Pinkney, he had nut obtained, from the British  
government, an acceptance of the condition, on  
which tbe french government w«s willing to con­  
cur, in Fulling an end to all the edic ts of holt,  
against our neutral comm-rre. If he should af­  
terwards have succeeded, you will, of course, .m  
receiving information of the fact, immediately  
claim, irom the French government, tbe fulfilment  
ol it* promise: and by transmitting the result to  
Mr, Pinkney, you will co-operate with him m com­  
pleting tbe removal ut all the illegal obstructions to  
oui commerce.  
Among the documents, now sent, is another co­  
py of the act of Congress, repealing the non-inter  
course law, but authorizing a renewal of it Hguinst  
G. Britain, in case France shall repeal her edicts,  
and G. Britain refuse to follow the example, and  
vice versa. Y ou have been already informed that  
tun President is ready to exercise the power vested  
in him for such a purpose, as soon as tbe occasion  
shall arise, Snnuld tbe other experiment, in the  
hands of Mr. Pinkney, have failed, y..u will make  
the ac t of Congress, and the dipnsition of the Pre  
sident, the subject of a form &gt;1 communication tn  
the French government; and it is not easy con  
ceive any ground, ev. n specious, on which the over­  
ture specified in the act can he dei liu.d.  
Il the non intercourse law, in any of its modifica­  
tions, was otjeciiunxhle to the emperor of the  
French,, that I .w no longer exists. *  
It he be ready, as has been declared, in the letter  
of the doki of Cadure, ol February 14th,. to do  
justice to the U. States, in the case of a pledge on  
their part not to submit to the British edirts, YheJ  
oppi.rriinity for making good the decUtatii n s now &#x27;  
afforded. Instead of submission, thV President 1.  
ready, by renewing the non inter. 0111 se against G.  
Britain, to oppose to her orders in council a mea­  
sure, which is of a character that ougtuto satisfy  
any reasonable expectation.  
If il should be necessary for you to meet the ques­  
tion, whether the non-intercourse will be renewed  
against G. Briuiu, in cuse she should not compre­  
hend in tbe repeal of her edicts her blockades,  
which are not consistent with the law of nations,  
you mey, should it be found necessary, let it be un­  
derstood, that a repeal of the illegal blockades, of n  
dale prior to the Berlrri decree, namely, that of  
May, 1806, will be included in tbe condition, re­  
quired by Great Britain; that particular blockade  
having been avowed tb be comprehended in, and of  
Course identified with the orders in council. With  
respect to blockades of a subsequent date, or not u­  
gainst France, you will press the reasonableness of  
leaving them, together with future blockades, not  
war.&#x27;.tilted by puoltek law, to be proceeded against,  
by tbe (J. States, in.the manner they may choose  
to adopt.  
  
As lias been heretofore stated to yon, a satisfacto­  
ry provision for restoring the property lately sur­  
pfistd and seized by the older, or at the instanrr, of  
the f rench government, mlist be combined wnh a  
repeal of the French edicts, with a view to a nmi­  
tnieicotnv- with Ci. Biium; such&#x27;a provision be­  
ing an indispensikle evidence ol the just purpose of  
France towards the United States. And you will,  
moreover, be careful, in arranging such a provision  
for that particular rase of spoliations, not to weak­  
en the ground ou which a redress of others may be  
justly put sued.. i ■. . . .

The arrival of the John Adams  
brought your letters of il.e 1st, 4th.  
7th, and 16th April.  
Prom ihist.of the 16th April, it ap­  
pears, that the&#x27;&#x27;seizures of the Ameri­  
can property, lately made, had been  
followed by its actual sale, and that  
the proceeds had been deposited in tl :  
emperor’s caisse privt. You have pre­  
sented, iu such just color?, the enor­  
mity ol this outrage, that I have only  
to signify to you, that the President  
entirely approves the step that ha3  
been trken hy you, and that he does  
n&lt;-t doubt that it will be followed by  
you, or the person who may succeed  
you, with such further interposition,  
a* may be deemed advisable, lie in­  
stiucts you, particularly, to make the  
French government sensible of the  
d- ep impression made here, bv so sig­  
nal an aggression on the principles of  
justice and of good faith : and to de­  
mand everv reparation of whirh  
  
case is susceptible. If it be not the  
purpose of the French government to  
remove every idea of friendly adjust­  
ment with the United States, it would  
seem impossible bu: that a reconside­  
ration of this violent proceeding must  
It ad to a redress of it, as a preliminary  
to a general accommodation of the dif­  
ferences between the two countries.  
At the date of the last communica­  
tion from Mr. Pinkney, he had not  
obtained, from the British government  
an acceptance of the condition, on  
which the French government was wi.l  
l;rg ;o concur, in putting an end to  
all the edicts of both against our neu­  
tral commerce. If he should alter  
wards have succeeded, you will, of  
course, on receiving information of  
the fact, immediately claim, from the  
French government,’,he fulfilment of  
its promise ; and hy transmuting the  
result to Mr. Pinkney, you will co­  
operate with him in completing the  
rtmovnl of ail tne illegal obstructions  
to our commerce.  
Among the documents, now sent,  
i3 anotiv r copy of the act of Con­  
gress, repealing the non-intercourse  
law, but authorising a renewal of it  
against G. Britain, in case France  
shall repeal her edicts, and G. Britain  
refuse to follow the example, .and  
vice versa You have been already  
iuformed that the President is ready  
to &lt; xercise the power vested in him  
for such a purpose, ar, soon as the oc­  
casion sh ill arise* Should the other  
experiment, in the hands of Mr. Pink­  
ney, have, failed, you will make the  
act of C. oogtess, and the disposition  
cf’.he Prtsidcn&#x27;, the subject of a for­  
mal communication to the French go­  
vernment ; and it is nr t easy to con­  
ceive any ground, even specious, on  
which the overture specified in th-act  
can be declined.  
If the non intercourse law, in ar.y of  
its modification* was objectionable to  
the &lt; mp ror of the Fieseh, that law  
t o long* r exi-ty.  
if he be ready, as has been declar­  
er!, in the letter of tee duke of Cadorr,  
of February 14th, to do justice to the  
VJ. States, in the case of a pledge on  
their part n- t 10 submit to the British  
edicts, the o( portuniiy for making  
rood the declaration is now afforded!  
Instead ol submission, the President is  
r* ily, by re.ieu ing ibe non_intrrcMir e  
f . tin t G. Briteii:, to oppose tc her or­  
Cci&#x27;s in council a measure, which is cf  
  
&amp; character that ought to satisfy any  
reasonable expectation.  
It it should he necessary for you to  
n&#x27;ect the question, whether the hon-in­  
ttrcour&amp;e will be renewed against G.  
Britain, in case she should mot com­  
prehend in the repeal ol her edicts her  
blockades, which arc not consistent  
&quot; it*&#x27; the law of nations, you may,  
should it he found necessary, iet it be  
understood, that a repeal of tlie ilie&lt;  
jral blockades, if a date prior to the  
Berlin decree, namely, that of May-i  
IttOS, will lie included in the conditi­  
on, nquired by G-eat Britain; thal  
particular blockade having been avow­  
ed to be comptehended in, and tfi  
course identified with, the ©rders ir  
council. With respect to blockades ol  
a subsequent date, or not against  
France, you will press the reasonable*  
ness of leaving them, together with fu­  
ture blockades, not warranted by pub­  
lic law, to be proceeded against, by  
the U. States in the manner they may  
choose to adopt.  
As hae been heretofore stated to yon, a  
satixfactory provision *for restoring the; pro­  
perty lately surprised and seized by the  
order, or at the instance, of the French go­  
vernor n., must be combined with a repeal  
oftlie French edicts, with a view to a non­  
intercourse with G. B. such a provision be­  
ing an Indispensable evidence of the just pur­  
poseef France towards the U. Stales. And,  
you will, moreover, be careful, in amng­  
ing such a provision for that particular  
case cf spolaticns, not to weaken the ground  
oa which a rediess of others may be justly  
pursued.  
If the act of Congress, which his lega»  
mod a tree trade with both the belligerents,  
Without guarding against British interrupt  
t.ons of it with France, whilst France can­  
not materially intei rupt it with G Britain,  
be complained of, as leaving the trade on  
the worst possible footing for France, and  
on the best possible one for G. Britain, the  
French government may be reminded of  
the other feature ot the act, which puts it  
m their own power to obtain either an in­  
terruptirn of our trade with (i. Britain,  
or a tecal of her interruption ot it with  
l&quot; ranee.  
Among the considerations wideh be­  
long to this subject, it may be remark­  
ed, that it might have been reasonably&#x27;  
expected, by the United Sta es, that a  
repeal ot the French decrees wculd  
have resulted from the British ordet*  
in council of April, lgoy. This or­  
der expressly revoked the preceding  
orders of November, lhor, heretofore  
urged by France in justification of her  
  
ueciees, and was not only different m  
its extent and its details, but tvus es­  
sentially different in its policy.  
1 he policy of the orders of 1807,  
was by cutting off all commercial sup­  
plies, to retort on her enemies the  
distress, which the French decrees  
was intended to inflict on Great JJi i*  
tain.  
1 he policy of the order of April  
1809, if not avowedly, was most cer­  
tainly toprevent such supplies, by shiil*  
ting out those only which might flow  
from neutral sources, in order thereby  
to favor a surreptitious monopoly to  
British traders. In order to counter­  
act this policy, it was the manifest in­  
terest of 1« ranee to have favored the  
rival §c cheaper supplies through neu­  
trals; instead of which, she h.«s co-op­  
erated with the monopolising views of  
Great Britain, by a rigorous exclusion  
of neutrals from her ports. She has,  
in fact, reversed the operation, origi­  
nally professed by her decree. Instead  
°1 annoying her enemy at the expense  
of a lriend, she unnots a friend T&gt;r  
the benefit of her enemy.  
It the French government should  
accede to the overture, contained in  
the act of Congress, by repealing or  
so modifying its decrees, as that they  
wid cease to violate our neutral rights,  
you will, if necessary, transmit the re­  
peal, properly authenticated, to 7*Ir.  
Pinkney, by special messenger; and  
you will hasten and ensure the re*  
ceipt of it here, by engaging a vessel,  
if no equivalent conveyance should of­  
fer, to bring it directly from France,  
and by sending several copies to Mr.  
Pinkney, to be forwarded from British  
ports

Sir The arnvalVthe John Adams,  
I brought your letters of .the 1st,&#x27; 4th, 7th  
and 16th April.:  
From-th.it of the 16th April,- it ap­  
pears, that the stizuresof the American

in uch ui culo trs, the enormity ol

to you, that the President entirely ap­  
proves the step that has been taken by  
you, and that he does not doubt that it  
will be followed by you, or the person,  
who may succeed you, with such fur­  
ther, interpositions, as may be deemed  
advisable. He instructs you, particu  
laily, to make the trench government  
sensible of the.deep impression mad&#x27;  
here, by so S&#x27;gnal an aggression otthe  
principles of justice and of good faith ;  
and todemand every reparation of which  
the case is susceptible. If H bt lot the  
purpose of the French government to

seem impossible but that a reconsiciera  
lion of this violent proceeding must lead  
to a redress of it, as a preliminary to a  
general accommodation of the diffrences  
between the two countries.  
it the date of the last communication  
from Mr. Pinkney, he , had not obtained  
from the BntUh government an accrp  
tance of the condition, on which the  
French government was willing to con  
cur, in pulting an end to all the edicts of  
both, atrainst our neutral commerce. If  
he shout. I afterwards have succeeded,  
yru will, of course, on receiving informa  
tiun &#x27;.frhe fact, immediately claim, fron)  
the French Kovernmtrit, the fulfilment  
of its promise ; and by transmitting the  
result !to Mr. Pinkney. you will co-oper  
rate .with him in completing the remo  
val of all the illegal obstructions to, our  
commerce. - .  
Among the documents, now sent, is  
another copy f the act of Congress, re

thorising.a renewal of it against Great­  
Britain, in case France shall repeal her.

If the non-intercourse la w, in any ot  
its modifications, was objectionable to

the opportunity for making gcod the de­  
riaratton Is now &#x27;afforded. Instead of  
submission; the President is ready, by

racter that ought to satisfy any reasona­

Britain, in case she should not cornprer  
hend, in the repeal of her edicts, hr  
blockades, which are not consistent with  
the law of nations, you mjy, should it  
be found necessary, let it be understood,  
that a repeal of the illeg! 1 blockade?, of  
a date prior to the Berlin decree name­  
ly, that ol May, 1806, will be included  
in the condition, required of Great Bri­  
tain ; that particular blockade having  
been avowed to be comprehended in,  
and of course identified with, the orders  
in council.! With respect to blockades  
of a subsequent date, or not against  
  
France, you will press the reasonable­  
ness of leaving them, together with fu­  
ture blockades, not warranted by publu  
Uw, to be proceeded against, by the U

As has been heretofore stated to ycu  
a satisfactory provision foi restoring tin  
property, lately surprized and seized,  
by the order, or at the instance, ot the  
French government, must be combineo  
with a repeal of the French edicts,.wiih  
view to a non-intercourse with Great  
Britain ; such a provision being an in  
dispensable evidence of &#x27;he just purpos  
of France towards the United Slates.  
And you will, moreover, be.caitful, in  
arranging such a prsvUiun, for that par  
tlcubrcabc of spoliations, not to waken  
the ground on which a redress of other  
may be justly pursued..  
If the act of Cor gress, which has le  
galised a free tiade with both the belli  
gerents, without guarding agoinst Bn  
tish interruptions of it with Franco  
whilst France cannot materially inter  
nipt it with Great Britain, be complain  
ed of, leaving the trade on the worst  
possible foV.iog for France, and on the  
best possible one Mr Great Britain, the  
French government may be reminded  
i of the other. feature of the act, which  
puts it in their own power to obtain ei  
ther an. interruption of our trade wuh  
Great Britain, or a recal of her interrup  
lion of it with France.  
.Among the consideraticns which be  
long tu this subject, it may be remaiked,  
that It might have been&#x27; reasonably ex­  
pected, by the United States, that a re  
peal of the French decrees, would hnVt  
resulted from the Bitih order in coun  
cil of April, 1809. This order expressly  
revoked the preceding orders ofNovem  
ber, 1807, heretofore urged bV France  
in jusuucanon.oi ner aecrees, anu wa  
not only different in its extent and in its  
detail, but was essentially different in  
its policy. y &#x27; f  
The. policy&#x27; of the orders of 1 807 was;  
by cuttingoff all commercial supplies,  
to retort on her enemies&#x27; the distress,  
which the French decree was intended  
to infiict on Great Britain. 6  
The policy of the&quot;erder of April.  
&quot; 1 809, if not avowedly1, was most certainly  
to prevent such supplies,&quot; by shutting out  
those only which might tiw from neu  
tral sources, in order thereby to favor a  
surreptitious monopoly to British tra  
ders. In order to counteract this policy,  
it was the manifest Interest of r ranee,  
to . have favored the rival and cheaper  
supplies through neutrals ; - instead of  
which, she has co-operated With the  
monopolising tews ofGreat Britain, by

ted States. And, you will, moreover, he  
careful, in arranging such a provision for  
that particular case of spoliations, n*t to  
weaken the ground on which a redress of o­  
thers may be justly pursued.  
If the act ot congress, which has legalised  
a free trade with both the belligerents, with­  
out guarding against British interruption of  
it with France, whilst France cannot materi­  
ally interrupt it with Great-Britain, be com­  
plained of, as leaving the trade on the worst  
possible footing for Franee, and on the best  
possible one for Great-Britain, the French  
government may be reminded of the other  
feature of the act, which puts it in their own  
power to obtain either an interruption of our  
trade with Great Britain, or a recal of her  
interruption of it with. France.  
Among the considerations which belong to  
this subject, it may bo remarked, that it

order in council of April, 1809. &#x27;1 nis order  
exoressiy revolted tne preceding order* Ot  
November, inO/, heretofore urged by Pane©  
in justification of her decrees, and was not  
only dhierent in it* extent anti if* details, but  
was essentially different in its policy..  
Tne policy of the orders of 180/ war, by •  
cutting olT all commercial supplies, to retort ,  
on her enemtes the distress, which tne j  
French decree was intended to intiict cn G.  
Britain.  
Tne policy of the order of April 1809, it  
not avowedly, was most certainly to prevent  
nuch supplies, by shutting out those ouiy&#x27;  
wnich might How from neutral sources, in  
order thereby to favour a surreptitious mono­  
poly to British traders. In order to counter­  
act this policy, it was the manifest interest  
of France to have favoured the rival and  
cheaper supplies through neutrals ; instead  
of which, she has co-operated with the mo­  
nopolizing view* of Great-Britain, by a rigor­  
ous exclusion ot&#x27;neutrals from her ports. Sue  
hat, in fact, reversed the operation, original­  
ly professed by her decree. Instead of annoy­  
ing an enemy at the cxpence of a friend,  
she annoys a friend for the bcnclit cf her  
enemy.  
If tne French government should accede to&quot;  
the overture, contained in the act of Con­  
gress, bv repealing or so modifying its de­  
crees as that they Will cease to violate our  
neutral rights, you will if necessary, trans­  
mit the repeat, properly authenticated, to  
Mr. Pinkney, by a special messenger ; and  
you will hasten and ensure the re e:pt of it  
he^e, t.y engaging a vessel, if no equivalent  
conveyance should offer, to bring ii directly  
from France, and by sending several conies  
to Mr. Pinkney, to be forwarded from Bri­  
tish ports.

Sie—&quot;The arrival of the John Ad­  
ams brought your letrers of the liit,  
4th, 7th and 16th. April. .  
From that of the 16th April, it ap­  
pears, that the seizures of the Ameri­  
can property, lately made, had been  
followed by its adtual sale, and. that  
the proceeds had been deposited in the  
emiperot’s caiffe prive. You have pre­  
sented, in such jult colors, the enormi­  
ty of this odtrage, that I bave, only  
to- fignify to you, that the Prefidert  
entirely. approves the fep that has  
beei taken by you, and that he. does  
not doubt that it will be followed by.  
you, or the perfun who may succeed.  
vou, with such further interposition,  
as may be dermed ad¥ifable. Hein­  
ftru&amp;s you, particularly, to make the  
French govérnment sensible of the  
deep impreflion made here, by so sig­  
nal an aggreflion.on the principles of  
jultice and of good faith ; and to de­  
mand every réparation of which the  
cdfe is susceptible. If it be not the  
purpose of the French government  
to remove every idea of friendly ad­  
justment with the ‘United States, it  
would seem impoflible but that a re­  
consideration of this violent procted­  
ing mult léad to a redress of it; as a  
preliminary to a general accommoda­  
tion of the differences. between the  
twQ countries. .., §o  
At the date of the last commaunica:  
tion from Mr, Pinkney, he had not  
obtained; from .the Britith govern­  
ments, an acceptance of the condition,  
on which the French government was  
willing to. concur, in putting an end  
to «ll the edi@s of both ag‘;i_n_g our

46 Appendix—State Papers. [ Jan.  
  
From that of the 16th of April it appears, that the seizures of  
the American property, lately made, had been followed up by its  
actual sale, and that the proceeds had been deposited in the em-  
peror’s caisse privé. You have represented in such just colours, the  
enormity of this outrage, that I have only to signify to you, that the  
  
resident entirely approves the’ step that has been taken by you,  
and that he does not doubt that it will be followed by you, or the  
person who may succeed you, with such further interpositions as  
may be deemed advisable. He instructs you particularly to make  
the French government sensible of the deep impression made here  
by so signal an aggression on the pfrrincifiles of justice and of good  
faith, and to demand every reparation of which the case is suscept-  
ible. If it be not the purpose of the French government to remove  
every idea of friendly adjustment with the United States, it would  
seem impossible but that a reconsideration of ihis violent frroceeding  
must lead to a redress of tty as a fireliminary to a general eccommo-  
dation of the differences between the two countries.  
  
At the date of the last communication from Mr. Pinkney, he.  
had not obtained from the British government an acceptance of  
the condition, on which the French government was willing to con-  
cur, in putting an end to all the edicts of both, against our neutral  
commerce. If he should afterwards have succeeded, you will of  
course, on receiving information of the fact, immediately claim  
from the French government the fulfilment of its promise, and by  
transmitting the result to Mr. Pinkney, you will cooperate with  
him in completing the removal of all the illegal obstructions to  
our commerce.  
  
Among the documents now sent is another copy of the act of  
congress, repealing the non-intercourse law, but authorizing a re-  
newal of it against Great Britain, in case France shall repeal her  
edicts and G. Britain refuse to follow her example, and vice versa.  
You have been already informed that the president is ready to ex-  
ercise the power vested in him for such a purpose, as soon as the  
occasion shall arise. Should the other experiment, in the hands of  
Mr. Pinkney, have failed, you will make the act of congress, and  
the disposition of the president, the subject of a formal communi-  
cation to the French government, and it is not easy to conceive any  
ground, even specious, on which the overture specified in the act  
ean be declined.  
  
If the non-intercourse law, in any of its modifications, was ob-  
jectionable to the emperor of the French, that law no longer exists.  
  
If he be ready as has been declared in the letter of the duke of  
Cadore of February 14, to do justice to the United States, in the  
ease of a pledge on their part not to submit to the British edicts,  
the opportunity for making good the declaration is now afforded.  
Instead of submission, the president is ready, by renewing the non-  
intercourse against Great Britain, to oppose to her orders in coun-  
cil a measure, which is of a character that ought to satisfy any rea-  
sonable expectation. If it should be necessary for you to meet the  
question, whether the non-intercourse wil be renewed against G.

Britain, in case she should not comprehend, in the repeal of her  
edicts, her blockades, which are not consistent with the law of na-  
tions, you may, should it be found necessary, let it be understood,  
that a repeal of the illegal blockades of a date prior to the Berlin  
decree, namely, that of May, 1806, will be included in the condi-  
tion required of Great Britain; that particular blockade having been  
avowed to be comprehended in, and of course identified with the i  
orders in council. With respect to blockades, of a subsequent date  
or not, against France, you wiil press the reasonableness of leaving  
them, together with future blockades not warranted by public law, |  
  
to be proceeded against by the United States in the manner they  
may choose to adopt. 4s has been heretofore stated to you, a satis-  
factory frrovision for restoring the firofierty lately surprised and  
seized by the order, or at the instance of the French government, |  
must be combined with a refieal of the French edicts, with a view to  
a non-intercourse with Great Britain: such a frovision being an in-  
dispensable evidence of the just fiurfiose of l’rance towards the Uni- |  
ted States. And you will, moreover, be careful, in arranging such  
a provision for that particular case of spoliations, not to weaken  
the ground on which a redress of others may be justly pursued.  
  
If the act of congress which has legalized a free trade with both  
the belligerents, without guarding against British interr uptions of  
it with France, whilst France cannot materially interrupt it with  
Great Britain, be complained of as leaving the trade on the worst  
possible footing for France, and on the best possible one for Great  
Britain, the French government may be reminded of the other i  
feature of the act, which puts it in their own power to obtain either  
an interruption of our trade with Great Britain, or a recall oi her  
interruption of it with France.  
  
Among the considerations which belong to this subject, it may 1  
be remarked that it might have been reasonably expfrected, by the 1  
United States, that a repeal of the French decrees would have resuilt-  
  
ed from the British order in council of April, 1809. This order ex-  
frressly revoked the fireceding orders of Novembcr 1807, heretofore  
urged by France in justification of her decrees, and was not only ;  
‘ different in its extent and its details, but was essentially different in i,  
its frolicy.  
  
The policy of the orders of 1807 was, by cutting off all commer-  
cial supplies, to retort on her enemies the distress which the French  
decree was intended to inflict on Great Britain.  
  
The policy of the order of April, 1809, if not avowedly, was most |  
certainly to prevent such supplies, by shutting out those only which |  
might flow from neutral sources, in order thereby ‘o favour a sur-  
reptitious monopoly to British traders. In order to counteract this  
policy, it was the manifest interest of France to h.ve favoured the if  
  
rival and cheaper supplies through neutrals; instea: of which, she |  
has cooperated with the monopolizing views oi Gritain by a  
rigorous exclusion of neutrals from her ports. % s in fact re-  
  
versed the operation originally professed by her cecree. Instead  
of annoying her enemy at the expense of a friend, she annoysa  
friend for the benefit cf her enemy.

If the French government should accede to the overture con-  
tained in the act of congress, by repealing or so modifying its de-  
crees as that they will cease to violate our neutral rights, you will,  
if necessary, transmit the repeal, properly authenticated, to Mr.  
Pinkney by a special messenger, and you will hasten and insure  
the receipt of it here; by engaging a vessel, if no equivalent con-  
veyance should offer, to bring it directly from France, and by send-  
ing several copies to Mr. Pinkney to be forwarded from British

•• From that of the 13th April, it appears,  
that the seizures of the American property  
lately made, had been followed up by its  
actual sale, and that the proceeds had been  
deposited in the emperor&#x27;s caiss- privet —  
You have presumed, in such just colors, ihe  
enormity of this outrage, that 1 nave only  
to signify *o you, that the President entire  
ly approves the step that has been taken by  
you, and that he does n.it doubt that it wilt  
be followed by you, or the person who  
may succeed you, with such Jurther inter­  
positions . as may be deemed advisable.—  
He instructs you, particularly, to make the  
French government sensible of the deep  
impression mode here, by so signal an ag„  
gression on the principles of justice and of  
good faith » and o demand every reparati  
on of which the case is susceptible. It it  
be not the purpose of the French govern*  
mentto remove every idea of friendly ad­  
justment with the U. States, it would see *  
impossible but that a reconsideration of thiR  
viola it proceeding must lead to a rrdrea*,of  
it as a preliminary to a general acc ,m»

countries.
