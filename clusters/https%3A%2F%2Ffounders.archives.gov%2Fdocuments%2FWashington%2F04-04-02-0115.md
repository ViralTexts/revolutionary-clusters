Mount Vernon 18th June 1786  
  
Under cover of your favor of the 21st of April, which came duly to hand, was a letter from Arthur Young Esqr. (author of  
  
the tours thro’ G. Britain and Ireland, with observations on the husbandry of those Kingdoms) informing me that he had sent me a compleat sett of all his works. As these have never yet come to hand, nor any advice of them, you would do me a favor (if you can recollect of whom you received the letter) by enquiring whether, or not, it was accompanied with a parcel. Mr Young in his letter to me says, these books were sent to the care of Mr Athawes, Mercht of London; but why Mr Athawes should send the letter without the parcel—or either by way of New York—I cannot easily conceive, as there are vessels from London passing my door (the situation of which is well known to him) every day.  
The Winter &amp; spring have been exceedingly opposed to our works at the Great Falls—The incessant rains often preventing, and at all times retarding, the removal of earth. The latter rains in May, which were continual for more than 20 days, have produced very calamitous effects in this Country; Half the Wheat (some say a great deal more) and 3/4ths of the rye, are blasted; and the ground surcharged to that degree with Water, as to have rendered plowing impracticable; which has involved the Indian corn that did come up so deeply in weeds &amp; grass as to exhibit a melancholy prospect in level lands of this crop also.  
The advantages with which the inland navigations of the rivers Potomack &amp; James are pregnant, must strike every mind that reasons upon the subject; but there is, I perceive, a diversity of sentiment respecting the benefits, &amp; the consequences which may flow from the free, &amp; immediate use of the Mississipi. My opinion of this matter has been uniformly the same, &amp; no light, in which I have been able to consider the subject, is likely to change it. It is, ⟨neither to⟩ relinquish, nor to push our claims to the navigation; but in the meanwhile to open all the communications which nature has afforded, between the Atlantic States and the Western territory, &amp; to encourage the use of them to the utmost. In my judgment it is a matter of very serious concern to the well being of the former, to make it the interest of the latter to trade with them; without which, the ties of consanguinity which are weakening every day, will soon be no band; and we shall be no more a few years hence to the Inhabitants of that Country than the Spaniards or British are to them at this day; perhaps not so much—because commercial connections it is well known introduce others; and united, are difficult to be broken.  
  
With the Spaniards these must take place, if the navigation of the Mississipi is opened. Clear I am that it would be for the interest of the western settlers as low down the Ohio as the big Kanhawa, &amp; back to the Lakes, to bring their produce through one of the channels I have mentioned; but the way must be cleared, made easy, ⟨&amp; obvious⟩ to them or else the ease with which people ⟨glide⟩ down the stream, will give a different bias to their thinking &amp; acting. ⟨Whene⟩ver the New States become so populous, and so extended to the Westward as really to need it, there is no power that can deprive them of the use of the Mississipi. Why then should we, prematurely, urge a matter which is disagreeable to others, and may be attended with embarrassing consequences, if it is our interest to let it sleep? It may require some management to quiet the restless &amp; impetuous spirits of Kentucke (of whose conduct I am more apprehensive in this business than I am of all the opposition that will be given by the Spaniards).  
Mrs Washington &amp; George &amp; his wife join me in compliments &amp; good wishes for Mrs Lee &amp; yourself. With very great esteem &amp; regard I am Dr Sir Yr affecte Hble Servt  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
I will thank you for your care of the inclosed

Draper quotes (p. 203,) it is said: /There is, I perceive, a di-  
versity of sentiment respecting the benefits and consequences  
which may flow from the free and immediate use of ‘the Missis-  
sippi. My opinion of this matter has uniformly been the same;  
and no light in which I*have been able to consider the subject is  
likely to change it. Jt is neither to relinquish nor to push our  
claim to this navigation.’ Now this passage, as well as the whole  
correspondence of Washington on the same subject, shows that  
he only denied the benefits to flow from ‘ the immediate use of the  
Mississippi.’ If Mliad believed ‘ that the possession of the river  
would be of more harm than good’ to the republic, then he  
would have agreed with the North in wishing to sce it relin-  
quished. But he was opposed to its relinquishment, because, as  
his whole correspondence shows, he perfectly comprehended its  
great importance to the Western development of the South. On  
the other hand, he did not wish ‘to push our ‘claim to this navi-  
gation’, because he knew that it would, in due time, become ours  
without any pushing or disturbance. Thus, in the same extract  
made by Dr. Draper, he says: ‘ Whenever the new States be-  
come so populous and so extended to the westward [is not this a  
glance beyond the ‘ Alleghany Mountains’, or the Atlantic bor-  
der’?]as really to need it, there will be no power which can deprive  
them of it. Why, then, should we prematurely urge a matter  
which is displeasing, and may produce disagreeable consequences,  
  
if it is our interest t6 let it sleep?’ (p. 204).

nature has afforded between the Atlantic States &amp; the western  
territory &amp; to encourage the use of them to the utmost. In my  
judgement it isa matter of very serious concern to the well being  
of the former, to make it the interest of the latter to trade with  
them; without which, the ties of consanguinity, which are weak-  
ening every day, will soon be no band, and we shall be no mare  
a few years hence, to the Inhabitants of that Country, than the  
Spaniards or British are to them at this day; perhaps not so  
much, because commercial it is w&quot; introduce others; and  
united are difficult to be broken. With the Spaniard these  
must take place if the navigation of the Mississippi is opened.  
Clear I am that it would be for the interest of the Western Set-  
tlers as low down the Ohio as the big Kanawha and back to the  
lakes to bring their produce through one of the channels I have  
mentioned; and the way must be cleared &amp; made easy * * to  
them or else the ease with which the people glide down stream.  
[ Illegible—worn off.] * * Whenever the new states become  
so populous and so extended to the Westward as really to need  
it, there is no power that can deprive them of the use of i e  
Mississippi. Why then should we prematurely urge a matter  
which is disagreeable to others, and may be attended with em-  
barrassing consequences if it is our interest to let it sleep? It  
may require some management to quiet the restless &amp; impetuous  
spirits of Kentucky (of whose conduct I am more apprehensive  
in the business than I am of all the opposition that will be given  
by the Spaniards). Mrs. Washington &amp; George &amp; his wife join  
me in compliments &amp; good wishes for Mrs. Lee &amp; yourself.  
With very great esteem &amp; regard, I am D* Sir,  
Your affec. H’* Serv&#x27;,
