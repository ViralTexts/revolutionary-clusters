Dear Sir  
					Monticello Sep. 4. 23.  
				  
				Your letter of Aug. 15. was recieved in due time, and with the welcome of every thing which comes from you. with it’s opinions on the difficulties of revolutions, from despotism to freedom, I very much concur. the generation which commences a revolution can rarely compleat it. habituated from their infancy to passive submission of body and mind to their kings and priests, they are not qualified, when called on, to think and provide for themselves and their inexperience, their ignorance and bigotry make them instruments often, in the hands of the Bonapartes and Iturbides to defeat their own rights and purposes. this is the present situation of Europe and Spanish America. but it is not desperate. the light which has been shed on mankind by the art of printing has eminently changed the condition of men the world. as yet that light has dawned on the midling classes only of the men of Europe. the kings and the rabble of equal ignorance, have not yet recieved it’s rays; but it continues to spread. and, while printing is preserved, it can no more recede than the sun return on his course. a first attempt to recover the right of self-government may fail; so may a 2d. a 3d. Etc. but as a younger, and more instructed race comes on, the sentiment becomes more and more intuitive, and a 4th. a 5th. or some subsequent one of the ever renewed attempts will ultimately succeed. in France the 1st. effort was defeated by Robespierre, the 2d. by Bonaparte, the 3d. by Louis XVIII. and his holy allies; another is yet to come, and all Europe, Russia excepted, has caught the spirit; and all will attain representative government, more or less perfect. this is now well understood to be a necessary check on kings, whom they will probably think it more prudent to chain and tame, than to exterminate. to attain all this however rivers of blood must yet flow, &amp; years of desolation pass over, yet the object is worth rivers of blood, and years of desolation. for what inheritance, so valuable, can man leave to his posterity? the spirit of the Spaniard and his deadly and eternal hatred to a Frenchman, gives me much confidence that he will never submit, but finally defeat this atrocious violation of the laws of god and man under which he is suffering; and the wisdom and firmness of the Cortes afford reasonable hope that that nation will settle down in a temperate representative government, with an executive properly subordinated to that. Portugal, Italy, Prussia, Germany, Greece will follow suit. you and I shall look down from another world on these glorious atchievements to man, which will add to the joys even of heaven.I observe your toast of mr Jay on the 4th. of July, wherein you say that the omission of his sig

For what inheritance so valuable can  
man leave to his posterity! The spirit  
of the Spaniards, and his deadly ai d e­

much confidence that he will never sub­  
mit, but finally defeat ibis afroemu- vio­  
lation of the laws of Cod and man, un­  
der which he is suffering; a d the wis­  
dom and firmness of the Cortes afford rea­  
sonable hope that that nation will set lie  
down in a temperate representative gov­  
ernment, with an executive properiv  
subordinated to that. Portugal, Italy,  
Prussia, Germany, Greece, will follow  
suit. You and I shall look down from  
another world on these glorious achieve­  
ments of man, which will add to the joys  
even of Heaven.”
