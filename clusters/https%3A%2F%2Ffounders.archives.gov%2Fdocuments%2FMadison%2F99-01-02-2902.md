						Department of State April 4th. 1808  
					  
					My last was of March 22d., and went under the care of Mr Rose. I now forward printed copies of the correspondence with him on the subject of his mission, and of the antecedent documents relating to the case of the Chesapeake. As soon as the voluminous  
						residue of the communications made to Congress issues from the press, it shall also be forwarded. You will find that they include certain documents relating to France which were thought proper for the knowledge of Congress at the present Crisis.  
					To these communications, I add copies of Mr. Erskine’s letter to me on the subject of the British decrees of Novr. last; and of my answer. And that you may have a view of the ground which has been taken with respect to the French decree of Novr. 1806, and  
						to the judicial exposition in the case of the Horizon giving it an illegal operation against the United States, I inclose copies of two letters to Genl Armstrong on these subjects.  
					The President made to Congress a few days ago, other communications relating to the present crisis with Great Britain and France, among which were Mr Erskine’s letter now inclosed, and a letter from Mr. Champagny to Genl Armstrong, explaining the course  
						meditated by the French Government with respect to the commerce of the U. States. These being excepted from the confidential character attached to the others have been published, and will be found among the printed inclosures. Your letter of Feby 26 was  
						included in the communication to Congress but not in the exception.  
					The conduct of the two great contending nations towards this Country, as it will now appear to it and to the world, fully displays their mutual efforts to draw the United States into a war with their adversary. The efforts on both sides are too little  
						disguised to be worthy the discernment of either, and are addressed moreover, to motives which prove great ignorance of the character of the United States, and indeed of human nature.  
					From the posture in which Mr Rose’s final reply to the compromise proposed to him, placed the question of adjustment in the case of the Chesapeake, it remains with the British Government to resume it, if adjustment be their object. Whether a tender of  
						reparation will be made here, or to you, will also be on that side. It will certainly be most becoming that Government under all circumstances to make the reparation here, and this course might of right be insisted on by this Government. The President nevertheless, in the  
						liberal spirit which always governs him, authorizes you to accept the reparation provided it be tendered spontaneously, be charged with no condition, unless it be that on the receipt of the act of reparation here the proclamation of July 2d. shall be revoked: and provided the  
						reparation shall add to the disavowal of the attack on the Chesapeake, an express engagement that the seamen retained shall be immediately restored, and that the guilty officers shall experience an exemplary punishment. The reparation will be the more satisfactory, and not  
						exceed a just expectation if the restoration of the seamen be made to the very ship from which they were wrested, and if provision be made for the wounded survivors, and for the families of those who lost their lives by the attack.  
					I must repeat however that it is considered entirely proper that the reparation should be offered here, rather than in London, and it is only in the event of a decided repugnance in the British Government to make it thro’ a functionary here, that you are to  
						accept it there.  
					The answer to Mr. Erskine’s letter on the British orders, will furnish the grounds to be taken in your communications with his Government on that subject. If the Cabinet can be brought to view the orders in their true light a revocation of the whole of them  
						can not fail to take place, unless they mean to violate every maxim of justice, or are fixed in hostile purposes against the United States. In not regarding the orders indeed as acts of hostility and in trusting for redress to the motives and the means to which they have  
						appealed, the United States have given the most signal proof of their love of peace, and of their desire to avoid an interruption of it with the British nation.  
					Still it is to be understood, that whilst the insult offered in the attack on the American Frigate remains unexpiated, you are not to pledge or commit you Government to consider a recall of the orders as a ground on which a removal of existing restrictions  
						on the commerce of the United States with Great Britain, may be justly expected.  
					The two letters to Genl Armstrong of 22d. May 1807 and Feby 8th. 1808 are proofs of the sincerity and impartiality with which the President has proceeded in relation to the belligerent parties, and may perhaps assist you in repressing unjust suspicions  
						imbibed by the British Cabinet. It would be happy for all parties, the belligerent as well as the UStates, if truth could in this case be made to prevail; and if the retaliating rivalship of the former against the latter, could be converted into an emulation, as politic as it  
						would be magnanimous in both, to take the lead in a fair, lawful, and conciliatory course towards a Nation which has done no wrong to either. Should the experiment be made on either side it would probably be followed on the other; and it could never happen, that the side  
						first doing justice would suffer on that account.  
					In the present state of our relations to Great Britain, it would be premature to mark out the course to be pursued with respect to further negotiations on other topics, than those above noticed. You are authorized however to continue your  
						interpositions in behalf of our impressed or detained seamen, and in the event of a repeal of the British orders, and satisfactory pledges for repairing the aggression on the Chesapeake to enter into informal arrangements for abolishinging  
						impressments altogether and mutually discontinuing to receive the Seamen of each other into either military, or merchant service, conformably to the instructions on this point transmitted by Mr. Purviance.  
					You will find by a passage in Mr. Rose’s reply of March 17th., that the British Government does not maintain the principle that the obligation of the United States extends beyond the discharge of deserters from their public  
						service: and by an order of the Navy Department here, already carried into execution, of which a copy is enclosed, that it has lately been decided that no foreign Seamen, whether deserters or not, shall serve on board our ships of War. The principles respectively manifested  
						by these documents, ought to facilitate such an adjustment as is contended for by the United States.  
					It cannot yet be said how much longer the Session of Congress will be protracted. The two provisions of most importance remaining to be decided on are the augmentation of the army, and a definition of the case or cases in which a repeal or relaxation of the  
						Embargo, may, during a recess, be committed to the Executive. I have the honor to be &amp;c.

Srir—My last was of March  
22, and went under the care of  
Mr. Rose. I now forward print-  
ed copies of the correspondence  
with him on the subject of his  
mission, and of the antecedent  
  
{38  
  
documents relating to the case of  
the Chesapeake. As soonasthe  
voluminous residue of the com-  
munications made to congress  
issues from the press, it shall al-  
so be forwarded. You will find  
that they include certain docu-  
ments relating to France, which  
were thought proper for the  
knowledge of congress at the  
present crisis.!  
  
To these communications I add  
copies of Mr. Erskine’s letter to  
me on the subject of the British  
decrees of November last, and  
of my answer. And that you  
may have a view of the ground  
which has been taken with re-  
spect to the French decree of  
November, 1806, and to the ju-  
dicial exposition in the case of  
the Horizon, giving to it an ille-  
gal operation against the United  
States, I inclose copies of two  
letters to general Armstrong on  
those subjects.  
  
The president made to con-  
gress, a few days ago, other com-  
munications relating to the pre-  
sent crisis with Great Britain and  
France, among which were Mr.  
Erskine’s letter, now inclosed,  
and a letter from M. Champagny  
to general Armstrong, explaining  
the course meditated by the  
French government with respect  
i the commerce of the United  
States. These being excepted  
from the confidential character  
attached to the others, have been  
published, and will be found a-  
mong the printed inclosures.  
Your letter of February 26 was  
included in the communications  
to congress, but not in the excep-  
tion.  
  
The conduct of the two great  
contending nations towards this  
¢ountry, as it will now appear to  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER.  
  
it and to the world, fully displays  
their mutual efforts to draw the  
United States into &amp; war with  
their adversary: The efforts on  
both sides are too little disguised  
to be worthy the discernment of  
either, and are addressed more-  
over to motives which prove  
great ignorance of the character  
of the United States, and indeed  
of human nature.  
  
From the posture in which  
Mr. Rose’s final reply to the com-  
promise proposed to him placed  
the question of adjustment in the  
case of the Chesapeake, it re-  
mains with the British govern-  
ment to resume it, if adjustment  
be their object. Whether a ten-  
der of reparation will be made  
here, or to you, will also lie on  
that side. It will certainly be  
most becoming that goverament,  
under all circumstances, to make  
the reparation here; and this  
course might of right be insisted  
on by this government. The  
president, nevertheless, in the  
liberal spirit which always go-  
verns him, authorizes you to ac-  
cept the reparation, provided it  
be tendered spontaneously, be  
charged with no condition, unless  
it be that, on the receipt of the  
act of reparation here, the pro-  
clamation of July 2d shall be re-  
voked ; and provided the repara-  
tion shall add, to the disavowal of  
the attack on the Chesapeake, an  
express engagement that the sea-  
men retained shall be immedi-  
ately restored, and that the guilty  
officer experience an exemplary  
punishment. The reparation  
will be the more satisfactory, and  
not exceed a just expectation, if

survivors, and for the families of  
those who lest their lives by the  
attack.  
  
I must repeat, however, that it  
is considered entirely proper, that  
the reparation should be offered  
here, rather than in London, and  
it is only in the event of a decided  
repugnance in the British go-  
vernment to make it through a

accept it there.  
  
The answer to Mr. Erskine’s  
letter on the British orders, will  
furnish the grounds to be taken  
in your communications with his  
government on that subject. If  
the cabinet can be broughtto view  
the orders in theirtrue light, a re-  
vocation of the whole of them  
cannot fail to take place, unless  
they mean to violate every maxim  
of justice, or are fixed in hostile  
purposes against the United  
States. In not regarding the or-  
ders, indeed, as acts of hostility,  
and in trusting for redress to the  
motives and the means, to which  
they have appealed, the United  
States have given the most signal  
proof of their love of peace, and  
of their desire to avoid an inter-  
ruption of it with the British na-  
tion.  
  
Still it is to be understood, that  
whilst the insult offered in the at-  
tack on the American frigate re-  
mains unexpiated, you are not to  
pledge, or commit your govern-  
ment, to cousider a recall of the  
orders as a ground on which a re-  
moval of the existing restrictions  
on the cotmmerce of the United  
States with Great Britain may be  
justly expected.  
  
The two letters to general  
Armstrong, of the 22d May,  
‘1807, and February 8th, 1808,  
  
i39  
  
are proofs of the sincerityand im-  
partiality with which the presi-  
dent has proceeded in relation to  
the belligerent parties, and may,  
perhaps, assist you in repressing  
unjust suspicions, imbibed by the  
British cabinet. It would be  
happy for all parties, the belli-  
gerents as well as the United  
States, if truth could, in this  
case, be made to prevail; and if  
the retaliating rivalship of the  
former against the latter, could  
be converted into an emulation,  
as politic, as it would be magnani-  
mous in both, to take the lead in  
a fair, lawful, and conciliatory  
course, towards a nation which  
has done ne wrong to either.  
Should the experiment be made  
on either side, it would probably  
be followed on the other; and it  
could never happen, that the side  
first doing justice would suffer on  
that account.  
  
In the present state of our re-

be premature to mark out the  
course to be pursued with respect  
to further negotiations on other  
topics than those above noticed.  
You are authorized, however, to

mutually discontinuing to receive  
the seamen of each other, into  
either military or merchant ser-  
vice, conformably to the instruc-

Mr. Purviance.

“ My last was of March 22, and went un­  
der the care of Mr. Hose. I now forward  
{ointed copies tf the correpondence with  
dm, on the sub ect of his mission, and of the  
antecedent documents, relating to the case  
of the Chesapeake. As soon as the volumi­  
nous residue of the communications made to  
Congress issues from the press, it shall al­  
so be forwarded. You &#x27;illlind that they in­  
clude certain documents relating to France,  
which were thought proper for the know­  
ledge of Congiess at the present crisis.  
To tho e communications, f add copies of  
Mi Erskihc’s letter to me, on the subject of  
the British decree of November last, and of  
my answer. And, that you may have a view  
of the ground which has been taken, with re­  
spect to the French decree of November,  
^806, and to the judicial exposition, in the  
ft|se of the Horizon, giving to it an illegal  
j^Beratinn against the U. States, I enclose  
ij^Kdes of two letters to general Armstrong  
those subjects.  
^^JThe . President made to Congress, a few  
|tla\ s ago, other communications relating to  
&#x27;the present crisis, with Great Britain and  
France, amoug which were Mr. Erskine’s  
letter, now enclosed,&#x27; and a letter from Mr.  
Champagny to gen. Armstrong, explaining  
th« course meditated by the French govern­  
ment, with respect to the commerce of the  
United States. These, being excepted from  
the confidential character attached to the o­  
thers, bate been published, and will be  
found among the printed enclosures.—Your  
letter of Feb. 26 was included in the commu­  
nications to Congress, but not in the excep­  
tion ”  
•• The conduct of the two great contending  
nations towards this countrv, ns it will no v  
appear to it, and to the wor;d, fully displays  
their mutual efforts to draw the U. States  
into a war with their adversary. The efforts  
on both sides, are too little disguised to be  
worthy the discernment of either, and are  
addressed, moreover, to motives which prove  
great ignorance of the character of the Unit­  
ed States, and, indeed, of human nature.”  
“From the posture in which Mr. Hose’s  
final reply to the compromise proposed to  
him, placed the question of adjustment, in  
the case of he ( hesapeake, it remains with  
the British government to resume it, if ad­  
jiisuoent lie their object. Whethera tender  
of reparation will be made here, or to you,  
wii also lie on that side. It will certainly  
be most becoming that government, under all  
circumstances. 1 make the leparation here;  
and this c&lt;au se might, of right, be insisted on  
by this government The President, never­  
theless in the liberal spirit w hich always go­  
verns him, authorizes you to accept the re­  
parathn provided it be tendered spontane­  
ously lie charged with no condition, unless  
it be, that on tin receipt of the act of repa­  
ration hete, the proclamation of July 2 shall  
he revoked: and provided the reparation  
shall add&lt;o tin disavowal of the attack on the  
Chesapt; ke, an express engagement, that  
the seamen retained shall be immediately re­  
stored, and that the guilty officer experience  
an exemplar) punishment. The reparation  
Wiii be the more satisfactory, and not exceed  
a just expectati n, if the restoration of the  
Seamen be made to the very ship from which  
th» v v et o wrested, and if provision be made  
foi tfif wounded survivors, and for the fami­  
lies of those wlio lost their lives by the at­  
tack. * •  
1 roust rppeat, however, that it is consi­  
dered entirely pinper, that the reparation  
*b(H &lt;d be offered here, rather than in Lon­  
don ; and it isotih in the event of a decided  
repugnance in 1 he British government to  
make ij through a functionary here, that you  
art to accept it there.”  
*• The answer to Mr. Erskine’s letter on  
the British orders w ill furnish the grounds to  
be f iketi in your communications with hisgo- |  
vernn.enf on that subject. If ‘lie cabinet c o  
hr brought to view lli£ orders in their true  
light, a revocation of the whole of them can­  
not fail to take plnre, unless they mean to  
violate every maxim of justice, or are fixed  
in liosti e purposes against United States.  
In not &gt;■&lt; garding the &lt; rders, indeed, as acts  
of hostility, and in trusting for redress to  
the motives and the means, to which they  
have appealed, the United States hove given  
the most signal proof of their love of peace,  
  
rowtheir desire to ovoid an intc.ruption  
o» «: with the British notion.  
Still it is to be understood, that whilst the  
insult offered in the attack on the American  
frigate remains unexpiated, you are not to  
pledge or commit your government to consi­  
der a recall of the orders ns. a ground on  
which a removal of the existing restrictions,  
on the commerce of the United States with  
Grcat-Britain, may be justly expected.’*  
“ The two letters to Gen. Armstrong of  
22d May, 1807, and Feb. 8th, 1808, are  
[proofs of the sincerity and impartiality with  
I which the President hns proceeded in rcla­  
! tion to the belligerent parties; and may, per­  
haps, assist you in repressing unjust suspi­  
cions imbibed by tlie British cabinet. It  
would be happy for all parties, the belliger­  
ent, as well as the United States, if truth  
could in this case be made to prevail ; and if  
the retaliating rivalship of the former a­  
! gainst the latter could be converted into an  
I emulation, as politic as it would be magna­  
I ninaous in both, to take the lead in a fair, j  
(lawful and conciliatory course towards a na- j  
tion which has done no wrong to either.  
&#x27;Should the experiment be made on either  
side, it would probably be followed on the o­  
i tiler ; and it could never happen that the  
. side first doing justice would sutler on that  
account.  
In the present state of our relations to G.  
Britain, it would be premature to mark out  
the course to be pursued with respect to fur­  
ther negneiatinns on other topics than those  
above noticed. You are authorized, howe­  
ver, to continue your interpositions in bell ilf  
of our impressed or detained seamen ; and  
in the event of a repeal of the British orders,  
and of satisfactory pledges for repairing the  
aggression on the Chesapeake, to enter into  
informal arrangements for abolishing im­  
pressments altogether, and mutually discon­  
jtinuingto receive the seamen of each other  
: into either military or merchant service, con­  
formably to&#x27; the instructions on this point  
transmitted by Mr. Purviance.  
You will find by a passage in Mr. Rose’s  
i &gt;cpty of march if, that tlie British govern*  
; ment does not maintain the principle, that  
the obligation of the United States extends  
beyond the discharge of deserters from their  
public service: and by an order of the Na­  
vy Department here, already carried into  
execution, of which a copy is enclosed, that  
it has lately been decided that noforeigi  
seamen, whether deserters or not, shall serve  
on board our ships of war. The principles  
respectively manifested by these documents  
ought to facilitate such an adjustment as is  
contended for by the United States.”

“Tothose communications, I add copies

1806, and to the judicial exposition, in tht

close copies of two lettf rs to general Arm­  
s&#x27;rongon those subjects.  
“ The President made to Congress, f  
few days ago, other communications rela

Erskine’s letter,now enclosed, and alettci  
from Mr. Chnmpagny to gen. Armstrong  
explaining the course m -ditated by th&lt;  
French government, with respect t-i tilt

“ The conduct of the two great conten

‘‘frill the posture in which Mr. Rose1  
final reply to the compromise proposed t  
him, placed the question of adjustment, i  
the cave of the Chesapeake, it remains wit  
the Ilritish government to resume it, if ad

tainly he most becoming that government  
under all circumstances, to make the r^

“1 must repeat, however, tli it it is con­

“ Phe ans ver to \Ir. Krskioe’s letter on

indeed, as ac&#x27;s or hisrilitv, and in trusting  
r r redress to the m »f*v -s and me ins, to  
which they have annulled, the IT. States  
have given the m is* signal proof of their

an interruption of it with the British nati­

. it has lately been decided that no foreign  
seamen, whether tl serters or not, shall  
serve on board our ships of war. The prin­

&#x27; r.T Department of State0.  
April 4, 1108.  
(Extracts.)  
* My last was oOW|Kh t»,  
and watt under the dp?©f Mr.  
Reec. I ttgw forward printed  
copies of the eorrespoodence with  
hies, on the subject of hit mission,  
and of the antecedent documents,  
relating to the case of the Chesa­  
peake. As soon as the voluroin­  
oos residue at the eamnuniri.  
tieas made to Congress is issued  
from the press, H shall also be  
forwarded. Ton will find that  
they include certain documents  
relating to France Which were  
thought proper for the knowledge  
of congress at the present crisis.  
^To these communications 1 add  
copies ofttr. ErskineV letter to  
me on the subject of the British  
decree of November last, and of  
my answer. And, that youmay  
Kara a view of the ground which  
has been taken with reapeetto the  
French decree of November,  
1806, and to the judicial exposi­  
tion ; in the,case of the Horizon  
giving to it an illegal operation a­  
gainst the United States, I en­  
close copies of two letters to ge­  
neral Armstrong on those sub­  
  
m  
jecte.  
The president made to congress  
• few day* ago other communica­  
tions plating to the present crisis,  
wklfGrcat* Britain and Prance :  
^ among which were Mr. Erskinc’s  
fetter, now enclosed, add a fetter  
from Mr. Clumpagoy to gen.  
Armstrong, explaining the course  
meditated by the Preach govern­  
ment, with respect to the com­  
merce of the United States.  
These being eteepted from the  
confidential character attached to  
the others, have been published,  
and found among the printed e&amp;  
closures. Your letter of Pebru »­  
ry S6 was included in the commu­  
nicstions to congress, but not in  
the exception.  
** The conduct of the two great  
contending nation* towards this  
coonttry, ss h will howanpear to  
k and to the world, fully display*  
their mutual efforts to draw the  
United States into a war with  
their adversary.1 The efforts, on  
both sides, arc too little dbgniicd  
to be worthy the fliacernmcat of  
cither, and are addressed, more­  
ovsr, to motives which prove  
great ignorance of the character  
of the United States and, indeed,  
of human nature.  
From the posture in which Mr/  
note&#x27;s final reply to the.-compro­  
mise proposed to him, placed the  
question oi adjustment in the case  
of the Chesapeake, it remains  
With die British government to  
resume it, if adjustment be their  
©bjeoju Whether a tender of re­  
par«.tioa will be made here, or to  
you dill also lie on that side. It  
will certainly be most becoming  
that government, under all cir  
cumstances, to make the repmr*.  
tion here ; and this course might,  
of right, be, insisted on by ibis  
government. The ■ president  
nevertheless, in the liberal spirit  
which alar ays govtrns him, au­  
thorizes you to accept the repa­  
ration, provided H be tendered  
•pontaneously ; bp charged with  
no condition, unless it be, that  
on the receipt of the act of repara  
if tion here, the proclamation of  
July 3 shall he revoked fand pro­  
vided die reparation shad add to  
th«P disavowal of the stir ck on the  
Chesapeake, an express tngage­  
ment, that .the seamen retained  
sh{|l be unnuliately restored,  
? - &#x27; Vv’f&#x27;V&#x27;  
§r\
  
&gt;&#x27; V • • /  
and that the  
ej§M*  
leer eiperi*  
S«“i . ml * -  
if the m**o«Uo. of  
^ beinade to tte my  
•Md from which they were wrest*&#x27;  
cd, and if provision be made for  
the wounded survivors, and* for  
the foasiliaaofihnn ohuinii tfcjr  
lives by the attack.  
“ I must reoeat. however, that  
it is considered entirely proper,  
that the reparation should be offer*  
cd here, rather than in London;  
and it is only in the event of a de­  
cided repugnance in the British  
government to make it through a  
functionary here, that you are to  
scceptit there.”  
* the answer to Mr. Krskiae&#x27;a  
letter on tne British orders will  
furnish the grounds to be taken in  
your communications with his go­  
vernment on that subject. If the  
cabinet cab be brought to view  
the orders in the true light, a re­  
vocation of the whole of them can­  
not foil to take place unless they  
mean to violate every maxim of  
justice, or are,. fixed In hostile  
purposes against the U. States.—  
la not regarding the orders, in­  
deed, as acts of nosdli’.y, and in  
trusting for redrtssto the motives  
sod means, to which they have  
appealed, the United States have  
given the most signal proof of her  
love ot peace,, ana of iheir desire  
to avoid an interruption of it with  
the British nation.  
Still it Hlo be understood, that  
whilst the insult offered in the at­  
tack on theAmerican frigate re­  
mains uoexpiated, you are not to  
pledge or commit your govern­  
ment to consider the recaff of the  
orders as a ground on which a re­  
moval of the existing restrictions  
on the commerce of the U. States  
with Great Britain, may be just­  
ly expected.”  
  
” i nc two letters to general  
| Armstrong of the Sid May, 1807,  
and February 8, 1*06, arc proofs  
of the sincerity, hod impartiality  
with which the president has pro­  
ceeded in relation to the bellige­  
rent parties ; and may, perhaps,  
assist in repressing unjust suapi  
cions imbibed by the British cabi­  
net. It woujd be happy for all  
parties, the belligerent, as well  
as the United States, if truth  
could in this case be mode to pre­  
vail ; and if the retwlistiog rival­  
ship of the former against the lat­  
ter could be converted into an  
emulation, as politic as it would  
be magnanimous in both, to take  
the feud in a fair, lawful and con­  
ciliatory course towards h nation  
which has done no wrong to ci­  
ther. Should the caperiascot be  
made on cither side, it would pro­  
bably be followed on the other j  
and it could never happen that the  
firs: side doing justice would suf­  
fer on that account.  
In the present state of our re­  
lations to Great Britain it would  
be premature to mark -out the  
course to be pursued with respect  
to further negotiations on other  
topics Bum the shove noticed.—­  
You are authorised, however, to  
continue your interpositions in.be­  
half of our impressed or dctilawf  
seamen $ and in the event of a re*  
peal of the British orders aid of  
satisfactory pledges for repairing  
the aggression on the Chesapeake,  
to enter inti informal arrange­  
ments for abolishing impressments  
altogether, and mutually-discon­  
tinuing to receive the seamen of  
each other into either military or  
merchant service, conformably to  
the inafeiictioof on this point  
transmitted by Mr. Purviaaeej.  
“ You will find by ajMtsage in  
Mr. Hose’s reply of March 17,  
that the British government does  
not {maintain the principle, that  
the obligation of the U. S. extends  
beyond the discharge of desfirt­  
cts from their public service; sad  
by an order of the navy depart­  
ment here already carried iato  
execution, of which a copy is en­  
closed, that it had lately been de­  
cided that no foreign seamen,  
whethyr deserters or not, shall  
serve on board our ships of war.  
The principles reipectivtly mani­  
fested by these documents ought  
to facilitate such an adjustment as  
is contended for by the U. S.”
