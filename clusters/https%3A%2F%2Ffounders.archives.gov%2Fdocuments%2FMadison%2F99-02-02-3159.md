Dear Sir

July 25th. 1835.  
  
  
I have received your letter of the 20th. informing me &quot;that I have been unanimously elected President of the  
Washington National Monument Society, in the place of its late lamented President Cheif justice Marshall.&quot;  
I am very sensible of the distinction conferred by the relations in which the Society has placed me; and  
feeling, like my illustrious predecessor, a deep interest in the object of the association, I cannot withhold, as an  
evidence of it, the acceptance of the appointment; tho’ aware that in my actual condition it cannot be more than honorary,  
and that under no circumstances, it could supply the loss which the Society has sustained.  
A Monument worthy of the memory of Washington reared by the means proposed, will commemorate at the same  
time, a virtue, a patriotism and a gratitude truly national, with which the friends of liberty every where will  
sympathise, and of which our Country may always be proud.  
I tender to the Society the acknowledgements due from me, and to yourself the assurance of my high &amp;  
cordial esteem
