N.B. Gather the Grapes after the Dew is off, and in all dry Seasons. Let not the Children come at the Must, it will scour them severely. If you make Wine for Sale, or to go beyond Sea, one quarter Part must be distill’d, and the Brandy put into the three Quarters remaining. One Bushel of Grapes, heap Measure, as you gather them from the Vine, will make at least a Gallon of Wine, if good, five Quarts.  
These Directions are not design’d for those who are skill’d in making Wine, but for those who have hitherto had no Acquaintance with that Art.

From Georgia t’Augustine the General goes;  
From Augustine to Georgia come our Foes;  
Hardy from Charlestown to St. Simons hies,  
Again from thence to Charlestown back he flies.  
Forth from St. Simons then the Spaniards creep;  
Say, Children, is not this your Play, Bo-peep?  
  
How few there are who have courage enough to own their Faults, or resolution enough to mend them!  
  
Men differ daily, about things which are subject to Sense, is it likely then they should agree about things invisible.  
XII Mon. February hath xxviii days.  
  
Democritus, dear Droll, revisit Earth;  
And with our Follies glut thy heighten’d Mirth:  
Sad Heraclitus, serious Wretch, return;  
In louder Grief, our greater Crimes to mourn.  
Between you both, I unconcern’d stand by:  
Hurt, can I laugh? and honest, need I cry?

From an insolent Friend, and a termagant Wife,  
From the Kindred of such (on one Side or t’other)  
Who most wisely delight in plaguing each other;  
From the Wretch who can cant, while he Mischief designs,  
From old rotten Mills, bank’d Meadows and Mines;  
From Curses like these if kind Heav’n defends me,  
I’ll never complain of the Fortune it sends me.  
In prosperous fortunes be modest and wise,  
The greatest may fall, and the lowest may rise:

p Holidays than Commandments.  
  
Once on a Time it by Chance came to pass,  
That a Man and his Son were leading an Ass.  
Cries a Passenger, Neighbour, you’re shrewdly put to’t,  
To lead an Ass empty, and trudge it on foot.  
Nay, quoth the old Fellow, if Folk do so mind us  
I’ll e’en climb the Ass, and Boy mount behind us:  
But as they jogg’d on, they were laught at and hiss’d,  
What, two booby Lubbers on one sorry Beast!  
This is such a Figure as never was known;  
’Tis a sign that the Ass is none of your own.  
Then down gets the Boy, and walks by the Side,  
Till another cries, What, you old Fool must you ride?  
When you see the poor Child that’s weakly and young  
Forc’d thro’ thick and thin to trudge it along.  
Then down gets the Father, and up gets the Son;  
If this cannot please them we ne’er shall have done.  
They had not gone far, but a Woman cries out,  
  
O you young graceless Imp, you’ll be hang’d, no doubt!  
Must you ride an Ass, and your Father that’s grey  
E’en foot it, and pick out the best of his Way?  
So now to please all they but one Trick lack,  
And that was to carry the Ass a pick-pack:  
But when that was try’d, it appear’d such a Jest,  
It occasion’d more Laughter by half than the rest.  
Thus he who’d please all, and their Good-liking gain,  
Shows a deal of Good-Nature, but labours in vain.  
  
Courts.  
A Person threatning to go to Law, was dissuaded from it by his Friend, who desired him to consider, for the Law was chargeable. I don’t care, reply’d the other, I will not consider, I’ll go to Law. Right, said his Friend, for if you go to Law I am sure you don’t consider.  
  
A Farmer once made a complaint to a Judge,  
My Bull, if it please you, Sir, owing a Grudge,  
Belike to one of your good Worship’s Cattle,  
Has slain him out-right in a mortal Battle:  
I’m sorry at heart because of the Action,  
And want to know how must be made Satisfaction.  
Why, you must give me your Bull, that’s plain  
Says the Judge, or pay me the Price of the Slain.  
But I have mistaken the Case, Sir, says John,  
The dead Bull I talk of, and please you, ’s my own:  
And yours is the Beast that the Mischief has done.  
The Judge
