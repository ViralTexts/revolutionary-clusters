n a note had proposed to surrender our claims to compensation for Spanish spoliations, or even for French.  
their instructions were to make no treaty in which Spanish spoliations were not provided for; and altho they were  
permitted to be silent as to French spoliations carried into Spanish ports, they were not expressly to abandon even them.  
2. it is not true that our ministers, in agreeing to establish the Colorado as our Western boundary had been obliged to  
exceed the authority of their instructions. altho’ we considered our title good as far as the Rio Bravo, yet in proportion  
to what they could obtain East of the Missipi, they were to relinquish to the Westward, &amp; successive sacrifices were  
marked out, of which even the Colorado was not the last. 3. it is not true that the Louisiana treaty was antedated lest  
Great Britain should consider our supplying her enemies with money as a breach of neutrality. after the very words of the  
treaty were finally agreed to, it took some time, perhaps some days, to make out all the copies in the very splendid  
manner of Bonaparte’s treaties. whether the 30th. of Apr. 1803. the date expressed, was the day of the actual compact, or  
that on which it was signed, our memories do not enable us to say. if the former, then it is strictly conformable to the  
day of the compact; if the latter, then it was postdated, instead of being ante-dated: the motive assigned too is as  
incorrect as the fact. it was so far from being thought by any party a breach of neutrality, that the British minister  
congratulated mr King on the acquisition &amp; declared that the king had learned it with great pleasure; &amp; when Baring,  
the British banker asked leave of the minister to purchase the debt &amp; furnish the money to France, the minister  
declared to him that so far from throwing obstacles in the way, if there were any difficulty in the paiment of the money,  
it was the interest of Great Britain to aid it. 4. he speaks of a double set of opinions &amp; principles, the one  
ostensible to go on the journals &amp; before the public, the other efficient &amp; the real motives to action. but where are  
these double opinions and principles? the Executive informed the legislature of the wrongs of Spain &amp; that preparation  
should be made to repel them by force if necessary. but as it might still be possible to negotiate a settlement, they  
asked such means as might enable them to meet the negociation, whatever form it might take. the 1st. part of this system  
was communicated publicly, the 2d. privately; but both were equally official, equally involved the responsibility of the  
Executive, &amp; were equally to go on the journals. 5. that the purchase of the Floridas was in direct opposition to the  
views of the Executive as expressed in the President’s official communication. it was not in opposition even to the public
