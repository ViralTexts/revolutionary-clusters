						be doubted, as the British orders in Council, had not only been referred for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the U. S. no longer to be pretended; but as the arrangement proposed, whilst it resisted the illegal Decrees of France; involved moreover  
						substantially, the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the B. Orders. The arrangement has, nevertheless, been explicitly rejected, the controverted fact being assumed, that the Enemy of G. B. was the original aggressor; and the extraordinary doctrine maintained, that,

					This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no other event having occurred, on which a suspension of the Embargo by the Executive, was authorized it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it. We have the satisfaction however to  
						reflect, that in return for the privations imposed by the measure, and which our fellow Citizens in general have borne with patriotism, it has had the important effects of saving our vast mercantile property and our mariners; as well as of affording time for prosecuting the  
						defensive &amp; provisional measures required on the part of the U. S. Whilst on another hand, the Course pursued by them, will have demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation &amp; firmness which govern their Councils and have confirmed in all their Citizens the motives
