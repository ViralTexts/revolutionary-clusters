[New York, December 18, 1787]  
  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
THE necessity of a Constitution, at least equally energetic with the one proposed, to the preservation of the Union, is the point, at the examination of which we are now arrived.  
This enquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches—the objects to be provided for by a Fœderal Government—the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those objects—the persons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention under the succeeding head.  
The principal purposes to be answered by Union are these—The common defence of the members—the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks—the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States—the superintendence of our intercourse, political and commercial, with foreign countries.  
The authorities essential to the care of the common defence are these—to raise armies—to build and equip fleets—to prescribe rules for the government of both—to direct their operations—to provide for their support. These powers ought to exist without limitation: Because it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent extent &amp; variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy them. The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite; and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed. This power ought to be co-extensive with all the possible combinations of such circumstances; and ought to be under the direction of the same councils, which are appointed to preside over the common defence.  
This is one of those truths, which to a correct and unprejudiced mind, carries its own evidence along with it; and may be obscured, but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning. It rests upon axioms as simple as they are universal. The means ought to be proportioned to the end; the persons, from whose agency the attainment of any end is expected, ought to possess the means by which it is to be attained.  
Whether there ought to be a Fœderal Government intrusted with the care of the common defence, is a question in the first instance open to discussion; but the moment it is decided in the affirmative, it will follow, that that government ought to be cloathed with all the powers requisite to the complete execution of its trust. And unless it can be shewn, that the circumstances which may affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate limits; unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and rationally disputed, it must be admitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority, which is to provide for the defence and protection of the community, in any matter essential to its efficiency; that is, in any matter essential to the formation, direction or support of the NATIONAL FORCES.  
Defective as the present Confederation has been proved to be, this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the fram

” It was presumed that a sense of their true interests, and a regard to the dictates of good faith, would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the Fœderal Head.  
The experiment has, however demonstrated, that this expectation was ill founded and illustory; and the observations made under the last head, will, I imagine, have sufficed to convince the impartial and discerning, that there is an absolute necessity for an entire change in the first principles of the system: That if we are in earnest about giving the Union energy and duration, we must abandon the vain project of legislating upon the States in their collective capacities: We must extend the laws of the Fœderal Government to the individual citizens of America: We must discard the fallacious scheme of quotas and requisitions, as equally impracticable and unjust. The result from all this is, that the Union ought to be invested with full power to levy troops; to build and equip fleets, and to raise the revenues, which will be required for the formation and support of an army and navy, in the customary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments.  
If the circumstances of our country are such, as to demand a compound instead of a simple, a confederate instead of a sole government, the essential point which will remain to be adjusted, will be to discriminate the OBJECTS, as far as it can be done, which shall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power; allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the objects committed to its charge. Shall the Union be constituted the guardian of the common safety? Are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose? The government of the Union must be empowered to pass all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them. The same must be the case, in respect to commerce, and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to extend. Is the

to be secured? Is there not a manifest inconsistency in devolving upon the Fœderal Government the care of the general defence, and leaving in the State governments the effective powers, by which it is to be provided for? Is not a want of co-operation the infallible consequence of such a system? And will not weakness, disorder, an undue distribution of the burthens and calamities of war, an unnecessary and intolerable increase of expence, be its natural and inevitable concomitants? Have we not had unequivocal experience of its effects in the course of the revolution, which we have just accomplished?  
Every view we may take of the subject, as candid enquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the Fœderal Government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management. It will indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful attention of the people, to see that it be modelled in such a manner, as to admit of its being safely vested with the requisite powers. If any plan which has been, or may be offered to our consideration, should not, upon a dispassionate inspection, be found to answer this description, it ought to be rejected. A government, the Constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the powers, which a free people ought to delegate to any government, would be an unsafe and improper depository of the NATIONAL INTERESTS, wherever THESE can with propriety be confided, the co-incident powers may safely accompany them. This is the true result of all just reasoning upon the subject. And the adversaries of the plan, promulgated by the Convention, ought to have confined themselves to showing that the internal structure of the proposed government, was such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people. They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations, and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The POWERS are not too extensive for the OBJECTS of Fœderal administration, or in other words, for the management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS; nor can any satisfactory argument be framed to shew that they are chargeable with such an excess. If it be true, as has been insinuated by some of the writers on the other side, that the difficulty arises from the nature of the thing, and that the extent of the country will not permit us to form a government, in which such ample powers can safely be reposed, it would prove that we ought to contract our views, and resort to the expedient of separate Confederacies, which will move within more practicable spheres. For the absurdity must continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government, the direction of the most essential national interests, without daring to trust it with the authorities which are indispensable to their proper and efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative

admired. As they may serve to the more complete develop-  
ment of the merits of the constitution, we shall quote them in  
some detail, commencing with the enumeration made by the  
Federalist of its leading objects.  
  
“ The principal purposes,” says General Hamilton, ‘‘to be answered by  
the Union are these:—the common &lt;lefence of the members:—the preserva-  
tion of the public peace, as well against internal convulsions as external at-  
tacks; the regulation of commerce with other nations, and between the  
states; the superintendence of our intercourse political and commercial with  
foreign countries.*  
  
“ The authorities essential to the care of the common defence are these—  
to raise armies; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe rules for the govern-  
_ ment of both, to direct their operations and to provide for their support.  
These powers ought to exist without limitation, because it is impossible to  
foresee or to define the extent and variety of national exigencies, and the cor-  
respondent extent and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy  
them. The circumstances which endanger the safety of nations, are infinite,  
and for this reason, no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed, on the  
power to which the care of itis committed. This power ought to be coex-  
tensive with all possible combinations of circumstances, and ought to be  
under the direction of the same councils, which are appointed to preside  
over the common defence. This is one of those truths which to an unpre-  
judiced mind, carries its own evidence along with it. It rests upon axioms  
as simple as they are universal—the means should be proportioned tothe end  
—the persons from whose agency the attainment of any end is expected,  
ought to possess the means by which it is to be attained. The moment it is  
decided in the affirmative that there ought to be a federal government, in-  
trusted with the care of the common defence, it will follow, that such a  
government, ought to be clothed with all the powers requisite to the com-  
plete execution of its trust.

General Hamilton and ts directly in point—*t The necessity of a  
Constitution, at least equally energetic with the one proposed,  
to the preservation of the Union, is the poimt at the examination  
of which we are now arrived. The inquiry will naturally di-  
vide itself into three branches: The objects to be provided for  
by a Federal Government—the quantity of power necessary to  
the accomplishment of those objeets—the persons upon whom  
the power ought to operate. * * * * * The principal  
purposes to be answered by the Union, are these: the common  
defence of the members—the preservation of the public peace,  
as well against national convulsions as external attacks—/he  
regulation of commerce with other nations and between the United  
Stutes—the superintendence of our intercourse, political and  
commercial with foreign countries.”* We beg our readers,

&quot;The circumstances that endanger the  
safety of nations are infinite, and for this  
reason no constitutional shackles can wise­  
ly be imposed on the power to which the  
care of it is committed. This power ought  
to be co-extensive with all possible combi­  
nations of circumstances, and ought to be  
under the direction of the same councils  
which are appointed to preside over the  
common defence.  
Shall the Union be constituted the guard­  
ian of the common safety? Are fleets and  
armies and revenue necessary to the pur­  
pose? The Government of the Union must  
be empowered to pass all laws and to make  
all regulations which have relation to them.  
&quot;The same must be the case with respect  
to commerce and to every other matter to  
which its preservation is permitted to ex­  
tend.Every view we  
may take of the subject as candid inquirers  
after truth, will serve to convince us that  
it is both unwise and dangerous to deny  
the Federal Government an unconfined  
authority in respect to all those objects  
which are entrusted to its management.

upon the plain, clear letter of the Constitution. When it  
declares that the Senate shall have the sole power to try  
impeachments, it necessarily invests the Senate with the  
sole and exclusive power to determine finally and forever  
every issue of law and of fact arising in the case. This is  
one of those self-evident propositions arising under the  
Constitution of the United States, which Hamilton states  
in words clear and strong, and which must carry convic

The Federalist, December 19, 1787: &quot;The  
principle purposes to be answered by  
union are these: The common defense  
of the members; the preservation of the  
public peace, as well against internal  
as external attacks; the regulation of  
commerce with other nations and be­  
tween the States; the superintendence  
of our intercourse, political and commer­  
cial, with foreign countries.&quot;  
  
&quot;The authorities essential to the care  
of the common defense are these: To  
raise armies; to build and equip fleets;  
to prescribe the rules for the govern­  
ment of both; to direct their operations:  
to provide for their support. These pow­  
ers to exist without limitation; because  
it is impossible to foresee or to define the  
extent and variety of national exigencies,  
and the correspondent extent and varfety  
of the means which may be necessary  
to satisfy them. The circumstances  
that endanger the safety of nations are  
infinite, and for this reason no constitu­  
tional shackles can wisely be imposed on  
the power to which the care of it is com­  
mitted. This power ought to be co­  
extensive with all the possible combina­  
tions of such circumstances; and ought  
to be under the direction of the same  
councils, which are appointed to preside  
over the common defense.&quot;  
&quot;This is one of those truths, which, to  
a correct and unprejudiced mind, carries  
its own evidence along with it; and may  
be obscured, but cannot be made plainer  
by argument or reasoning. It rests upon  
the axioms, as simple as they are uni­  
versal--the means ought to be propor­  
tioned to the end; the persons from whose  
agency the attainment of any end is ex­  
pected ought to possess the means by  
which it is to be attained.&quot;  
&quot;8ee Unless it can be shown that  
the circumstances which may affect the  
public safety are reducible within certain  
determinate limits; unless the contrary  
of this position can be fairly and ration­  
ally disputed, it must be admitted as a  
necessary consequence that there can  
be no limitation of that authority, which  
is to provide for the defense and pro­  
tection of the community, in any matter  
to its efficacy; that is, in any  
matter essential to the formation, direc­  
tion or support of the national forces.
