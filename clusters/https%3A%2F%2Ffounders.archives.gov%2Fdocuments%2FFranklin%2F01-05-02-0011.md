7. That upon examining the Royal and Provincial Charters, we find, that among other great Privileges King Charles II. granted to our late worthy Proprietary, and his Heirs, to his and their Deputies and Lieutenants, for the good and happy Government of the said Country, to ordain, make and enact, and under his and their Seals, to publish any Laws whatsoever, for the Raising of Money for publick Uses of the said Province, or for any other End, appertaining either unto the Publick State, Peace or Safety of the said Country, or unto the private Utility of particular Persons, according to their best Discretion, by and with the Advice, Assent and Approbation of the Freemen of the said Country, or the greater Part of them, or of their Delegates or Deputies, whom, for the Enacting of the said Laws, when, and as often as Need shall require, we will that the said William Penn, and his Heirs, shall assemble in such Sort and Form as to him and them shall seem best, and the same Laws duly to execute unto and upon all People within the said Country and Limits thereof; which Laws, so as aforesaid to be published, our Pleasure is, and so we enjoin, require and command, shall be most absolute and available in Law; and that all the Liege People and Subjects of us, our Heirs and Successors, do observe and keep the same inviolably in those Parts, so far as they concern them, under the Pain therein expressed, or to be expressed; provided nevertheless, that the same Laws be consonant to Reason, and not repugnant, or contrary, but, as near as conveniently may be, agreeable to the Laws and Statutes, and Rights of this our Kingdom of England. And to the End that the said William Penn, or his Heirs, or other the Planters, Owners or Inhabitants of the said Province, may not, at any Time hereafter, by Misconstruction of the Power aforesaid, thro’ Inadvertency or Design, depart from that Faith and due Allegiance, which, by the Laws of this our Realm of England, they and all our Subjects in our Dominions and Territories, always owe to us, our Heirs and Successors, by Colour of any Extent or Largeness of Powers hereby given, or pretended to be given, or by Force or Colour of any Laws hereafter to be made in the said Province, by Virtue of any such Powers: Our further Will and Pleasure is, that a Transcript or Duplicate of all Laws which shall be, so as aforesaid, made and published within the said Province, shall, within five Years after the Making thereof, be transmitted and delivered to the Privy Council for the Time being of us, our Heirs or Successors; and if any of the said Laws, within the Space of six Months after that they shall be so transmitted and delivered, be declared by us, our Heirs and Successors, in our or their Privy Council, inconsistent with the Sovereignty or lawful Prerogative of us, our Heirs or Successors, or contrary to the Faith and Allegiance due to the legal Government of this Realm from the said William Penn, or his Heirs, or of the Planters and Inhabitants of the said Province; and that thereupon any of the said Laws shall be adjudged and declared to be void by us, our Heirs and Successors, under our or their Privy Seal, that then, and from thenceforth, such Laws concerning which such Judgment and Declaration shall be made, shall become void; otherwise the said Laws so transmitted, shall remain and stand in full Force, according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof. Under this royal Grant, and our Provincial Charter, by which the Proprietary confirms them to the Freemen of this Province, we claim our Privileges. How far the Clause proposed to be added to the Bill is destructive of those Privileges, we leave to the House to determine; and how far the Proprietaries may apprehend it i
