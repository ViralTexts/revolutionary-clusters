Your favor of Jan. 15. is recieved, and I am entirely sensible of the kindness of the motives which suggested the caution it recommends. but I believe what I have done is the only thing I could have done with honor or conscience. mr Gilmer requested me to state a fact which he knew himself, and of which he knew me to be possessed. what use he intended to make of it I knew not, nor had I a right to enquire, or to indicate any suspicion that he would make an unfair one. that was his concern, not mine; and his character was sufficient to sustain the responsability for it. I knew too that if an incanded use should be made of it, there would be found those who would so prove it. independant of the terms of intimate friendship on which mr Giles and myself have ever lived together, the world’s respect entitled him to the justice of my testimony to any truth he might call for; and how that testimony should connect me with whatever he may do or write hereafter, and with his whole career, as you apprehend, is not understood by me. with his personal controversies I have nothing to do. I never took any part in them, or in those of any other person. add to this that the statement I have given him, on the subject of mr Adams, is entirely honorable to him in every sentiment and fact it contains. there is not a word in it which I would wish to recall. it is one which mr Adams himself might willingly quote, did he need to quote anything. it was simply that; during the continuance of the embargo, mr Adams informed me of a combination (without naming anyone concerned it it) which had for it’s object a severance of the union, for a time at least. that mr Adams and myself, not being then in the habit of mutual consultation and confidence, I considered it as the stronger proof of the purity of his patriotism, which was able to lift him above all party passions, when the safety of his country was endangered. nor have I kept this honorable fact to myself. during the late canvas particularly, I had more than one occasion to quote it to persons who were expressing opinions respecting him of which this was a direct corrective. I have never entertained for mr Adams any but sentiments of esteem and respect; and if we have not thought alike on political subjects, I yet never doubted the honesty of his opinions, of which the letter in question, if published will be an additional proof. still I recognize your friendship in suggesting a review of it, and am glad of this, as of every other occasion of repeating to you the assurance of my constant attachment and respect.Th: Jefferso

motives which suggested the caution it recom­

only thing I could hare done, with honor and con­  
science. Mr Giles rerpiested me to state a tact,  
which lie knew himself, and of which lie knew  
me to lie possessed M h it use he intended In  
make of it, I knew not, nor have I a right to iu­  
fjulrc,or to indicate any t •. spicion that he would  
make an unfair one; that was his concern, not  
mine; and his character was sufficient to -ustain

di I uso should he made of it, there Would be  
found tho&#x27;*-. w ho would «o piove it. Independentot  
j the fenu* of udiriai&#x27;- blend-hip, on which Mr.  
Giles and tnyself hav ever lr. d together, the  
| world’s re-pert entitled him to the justice of my  
testimony to any truth lie might cali for; and how*  
that fesitinony -hould connect me with whatever  
he may do or write hereafter, and with hi* whole  
career as you apprehend, is no: under1 torsi by me.  
V\ i&#x27;li his prr on il controversies I have nothing to

given hi?;i on thn subject of Mr. Adams, is entirely  
honorable to him, in every sentiment ami tact it  
&gt; ••!.(.tins. .’I here is not a word in it in which I  
would wish to recall; it is one which Mr. A. himself  
might willingly quote,(liil he need toquoe any tiling.  
It ivas simply, (hut during the contiiniuure ot the  
embargo, Air. A. informed me of a combination j  
(without naming any one concerned in it; which j  
had lor-ils object a severance of the union, for a  
time at least;that Mr. Adams and myself, not be­

Monticello, Jan. 21, 182 6.  
Dear Sir:-— Your favor ol January 15th is re­  
ceived, and I am entirely sensible of the kind­  
ness of you; motives which suggested the cau­  
tion it recommend- d; hut I believe what I have  
done, is ilie onlv thing I could have done, with  
honor and const ience. Mr. Giles requested me  
to state a fact, which he knew hims&lt; IT. and of  
which he knew me to b • poss s-ed. What u--e  
  
lie intended to make of i , 1 knew not, nor ha-e  
1 a light to inquire, or t&lt;» in licate any suspi­  
cion that he would mak • an unfair one; tha&#x27;  
was hi- concern, not mim; and his character  
was sufficient to sustain ihe responsibility for  
t«. I km w, too, if an uncnndid use should lie 1  
mad*’ of it, there would be found those who  
would so piove it. Independent of the terms  
of intimate friendship on which Mi. (iilesand  
myself have pv?r lived tog- the*&#x27;, the world’s re­  
spect entitled him to the justice of my tes imo  
ny to any truth iie might rail for; and&quot; how that  
testimony should concert me with whatever lie  
may do or wruc hereafier, ami will his w ole  
caret r, as you apprehend, is not undei stood by  
me. With his ptrsunal controversies * have  
nothing to do. I never took any patt in tbein  
or in those of any other pcrso ; add to this, that  
the statement I have given h.m on the sumet  
of Mr Adams, is entirely honorable to him, in  
every sentiment and fact it contains. There is  
not a word in it which I would wish to ircall;  
it is one which Mr. A. Iiimself miglu willingly  
quote, did he need to quote any tiling. It was  
simply, that during the continual ct of the em­  
bargo, Mr A. informed me of a combination  
(without naming any one concerned in it) which  
had lor its object a severance of ihr Union, for  
a time at least; that Mr. Adams and myself,  
not being then in the habit of mutual consul.a­  
tion and confidence, i considered it as the  
stronger proof of the purity of his patriotism,  
which was able to lift him above all pjry p,-s- {  
si&gt;ms, when the safety of his country was en­  
dangered: nor have I kept the honora le fact  
to myself; during the late canvass paittcular&#x27;y,  
I had more than one occasion to q^ote it o  
p- rsons who were expressing opinions respect­  
ing him, of which this was a direct ee.-rective.  
I have never entertained for Mr. Auano any  
but sentiments of esteem and respec&#x27;; and li we  
have not thought alike on poluicid subjects, I  
yet never doub ed the hones&#x27;V of his op.nions:  
of which the letter in &#x27;question, if. pu dished,  
wil1 be an additional proof&quot; S&#x27;iil I tecognise  
your friendship in suggeg-irq. d ievn w r&gt;f it.—  
I am plau ol this as of every other occasion of |  
  
repeating to you the assurance of my constant  
attachment and respert. * _.T

Monticello, Jan. 21, 1826.  
  
Dear sir:—Your favor of Jan. 15th is received, and I am  
entirely sensible cf the kindness of your motives which  
suggested the caution it reeommended: but I believe what  
I have done, is the only thing I could have done, with  
honor and conscience. Mr. Giles requested me to state  
a fact, which he knew himself, and of which he knew me to  
be possessed. What use he intended to make of it, I knew  
not, nor have f aright to inquire, or to indicate any suspi-  
cion that he would make an unfair one; that was his con-  
cern, not mine, and his character was sufficient to sustain  
the responsibility for it. I knew too, if an uncandid use  
should be made of it, there would be found those who  
would so prove it. Independent of the terms of intimate  
friendship, on which Mr, Giles and myself have ever  
lived together, the world’s respect entitled him to the  
justice of my testimonty to any truth he might cali for;  
and how that testimony should connect me with whate  
ever he may do or write hereafter, and with his whole  
career, as you apprehend, is not understood by me.  
With his personal controversies I have nothing to do.  
[ never took any part in them, or in those of any other  
person; add to this, that the statement l have given him  
onthe subject of Mr. Adams, is entirely honorable to  
him, in every sentiment and fact it contains. There is  
net a word in it which I would wish to recall; it is one  
which Mr. A. himself might willingly quote, did he need  
to quote any thing. It was simply, that during the con-  
tinuance of the embargo, Mr. A. informed me of a come  
bination, (without naming any one concerned in it),  
which had for its object a severance of the union, fora  
time at least; that Mr. Adams and myself, not being  
then in the habit of mutual consultation and confidence,  
I considered it as the stronger proof of the purity of his  
patriotism, which was able to lift him above all party pas-  
sions when the safety of his country was endangered; nor  
have I kept the honorable fact to myself; during the late  
canvass particularly, | had more than one occasion to  
quote it to persons Who were expressing Opinions respect
