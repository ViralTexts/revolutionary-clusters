The Year 1770 was memorable enough, in these little Annals of my Pilgrimage. The Evening of the fifth of March, I spent at Mr. Henderson Inches’s House at the South End of Boston, in Company with a Clubb, with whom I had been associated for several Years. About nine O Clock We were allarmed with the ringing of Bells, and supposing it to be the Signal of fire, We snatched our Hats and Cloaks, broke up the Clubb, and went out to assist in quenching the fire or aiding our friends who might be in danger. In the Street We were informed that the British Soldiers had fired on the Inhabitants, killed some and wounded others near the Town house. A Croud of People was flowing down the Street, to the Scene of Action. When We arrived We saw nothing but some field Pieces placed before the south door of the Town house and some Engineers and Grenadiers drawn up to protect them. Mrs. Adams was in Circumstances, and I was apprehensive of the Effect of the Surprise upon her, who was alone, excepting her Maids and a Boy in the House. Having therefore surveyed round the Town house and seeing all quiet, I walked down Boylstons Alley into Brattle Square, where a Company or two of regular Soldiers were drawn up in Front of Dr. Coopers old Church with their Musquets all shouldered and their Bayonetts all fixed. I had no other way to proceed but along the whole front in a very narrow Space which they had left for foot passengers. Pursuing my Way, without taking the least notice of them or they of me, any more than if they had been marble Statues, I went directly home to Cold Lane. My Wife having heard that the Town was still and likely to continue so, had recovered from her first Apprehensions, and We had nothing but our Reflections to interrupt our Repose. These Reflections were to me, disquieting enough. Endeavours had been systematically pursued for many Months, by certain busy Characters, to excite Quarrells, Rencounters and Combats single or compound in the night between the Inhabitants of the lower Class and the Soldiers, and at all risques to inkindle an immortal hatred between them. I suspected that this was the Explosion, which had been intentionally wrought up by designing Men, who knew what they were aiming at better than the Instrument employed. If these poor Tools should be prosecuted for any of their illegal Conduct they must be punished. If the Soldiers in self defence should kill any of them they must be tryed, and if Truth was respected and the Law prevailed must be acquitted. To depend upon the perversion of Law and the Corruption or partiality of Juries, would insensibly disgrace the Jurisprudence of the Country and corrupt the Morals of the People. It would be better for the whole People to rise in their Majesty, and insist on the removal of the Army, and take upon themselves the Consequences, than to excite such Passions between the People and the Soldiers as would expose both to continual prosecution civil or criminal and keep the Town boiling in a continual fermentation. The real and full Intentions of the British Government and Nation were not yet developed: and We knew not whether the Town would be supported by the Country: whether the Province would be supported by even our neighbouring States of New England; nor whether New England would be supported by the Continent. These were my Meditations in the night. The next Morning I think it was, sitting in my Office, near the Steps of the Town house Stairs, Mr. Forrest came in, who was then called the Irish Infant. I had some Acquaintance with him. With tears streaming from his Eyes, he said I am come with a very solemn Message from a very unfortunate Man, Captain Preston in Prison. He wishes for Council, and can get none. I have waited on Mr. Quincy, who says he will engage if you will give him your Assistance: without it possitively he will not. Even Mr. Auchmuty declines unless you will engage.... I had no hesitation in answering that Council ought to be the very last thing that an accused Person should want in a free Country. That the Bar ought in my opinion to be independent and impartial at all Times And in every Circumstance. And that Persons whose Lives were at Stake ought to have the Council they preferred: But he must be sensible this would be as important a Cause as ever was tryed in any Court or Country of the World: and that every Lawyer must hold himself responsible not only to his Country, but to the highest and most infallible of all Trybunals for the Part he should Act. He must therefore expect from me no Art or Address, No Sophistry or Prevarication in such a Cause; nor any thing more than Fact, Evidence and Law would justify. Captain Preston he said requested and desired no more: and that he had such an Opinion, from all he had heard from all Parties of me, that he could chearfully trust his Life with me, upon those Principles. And said Forrest, as God almighty is my Judge I believe him an innocent Man. I replied that must be ascertained by his Tryal, and if he thinks he cannot have a fair Tryal of that Issue without my Assistance, without hesitation he shall have it. Upon this, Forrest offered me a single Guinea as a retaining fee and I readily accepted it. From first to last I never said a Word about fees, in any of those Cases, and I should have said nothing about them here, if Calumnies and Insinuations had not been propagated that I was tempted by great fees and enormous sums of Money. Before or after the Tryal, Preston sent me ten Guineas and at the Tryal of the Soldiers afterwards Eight Guineas more, which were all the fees I ever received or were offered to me, and I should not have said any thing on the subject to my Clients if they had never offered me any Thing. This was all the pecuniary Reward I ever had for fourteen or fifteen days labour, in the most exhausting and fatiguing Causes I ever tried: for hazarding a Popularity very general and very hardly earned: and for incurring a Clamour and popular Suspicions and prejudices, which are not yet worn out and never will be forgotten as long as History of this Period is read. For the Experience of all my Life has proved to me, that the Memory of Malice is faithfull, and more, it continually adds to its Stock; while that of Kindness and Friendship is not only frail but treacherous. It was immediately bruited abroad that I had engaged for Preston and the Soldiers, and occasioned a great clamour which the Friends of Government delighted to hear, and slyly and secretly fomented with all their Art.   
The Tryal of the Soldiers was continued for one Term, and in the Mean time an Election came on, for a Representative of Boston. Mr. Otis had resigned: Mr. Bowdoin was chosen in his Stead: at the general Election Mr. Bowdoin was chosen into the Council and Mr. Hutchinson then Governor did not negative him. A Town Meeting was called for the Choice of a Successor to Mr. Bowdoin; Mr. Ruddock a very respectable Justice of the Peace, who had risen to Wealth and Consequence, by a long Course of Industry as a Master Shipwright, was sett up in Opposition to me. Notwithstanding the late Clamour against me, and although Mr. Ruddock was very popular among all the Tradesmen and Mechanicks in Town, I was chosen by a large Majority. I had never been at a Boston Town Meeting, and was not at this, till Messengers were sent to me, to inform me that I was chosen. I went down to Phanuel Hall and in a few Words expressive of my sense of the difficulty and danger of the Times; of the importance of the Trust, and of my own Insufficiency to fulfill the Expectations of the People, I accepted the Choice. Many Congratulations were offered, which I received civilly, but they gave no Joy to me. I considered the Step as a devotion of my family to ruin and myself to death, for I could scarce perceive a possibility that I should ever go through the Thorns and leap all the Precipices before me, and escape with my Life. At this time I had more Business at the Bar, than any Man in the Province: My health was feeble: I was throwing away as bright prospects as any Man ever had before him: and had devoted myself to endless labour and Anxiety if not to infamy and to death, and that for nothing, except, what indeed was and ought to be all in all, a sense of duty. In the Evening I expressed to Mrs. Adams all my Apprehensions: That excellent Lady, who has always encouraged me, burst into a flood of Tears, but said she was very sensible of all the Danger to her and to our Children as well as to me, but she thought I had done as I ought, she was very willing to share in all that was to come and place her trust in Providence. I immediately attended the General Court at Cambridge, to which place the Governor had removed it, to punish the Town of Boston, in Obedience however, as he said I suppose truly to an Instruction he had received from the King. The Proceedings of the Legislature, at that time and place may be seen in their Journals, if they are not lost. Among other Things will be found a laboured controversy between the House and the Governor, concerning these Words “In general Court assembled and by the Authority of the same.” I mention this merely on Account of an Anecdote which the friends of Government circulated with diligence, of Governor Shirley who then lived in retirement at his Seat in Roxbury. Having read this dispute in the public Prints, he asked who has revived these old Words. They were expressed during my Administration. He was answered the Boston Seat. “And who are the Boston Seat?” Mr. Cushing, Mr. Hancock, Mr. Samuel Adams and Mr. John Adams. Mr. Cushing I know and Mr. Hancok I know, replied the old Governor, but where the Devil this brace of Adams’s came from, I know not. This was archly circulated by the Ministerialists, to impress the People, with the Obscurity of the original, of the par nobile fratrum, as the Friends of the Country used to call Us, by way of Retaliation. This was to me a fatiguing Session, for they put me upon all the Drudgery of managing all the disputes, and an executive Court had a long Session which obliged me to attend, allmost constantly there upon a Number of very disagreable Causes. Not long after the Adjournment of the General Court

. Prestons Tryal was taken down in short hand and sent to England but was never printed here. I told the Court and Jury in both Causes, that as I was no Authority, I would propose to them no Law from my own memory: but would read to them, all I had to say of that Nature, from Books, which the Court knew and the Council on the other Side must acknowledge to be indisputable Authorities. This Rule was carefully observed but the Authorities were so clear and full that no question of Law was made. The Juries in both Cases, in my Opinion gave correct Verdicts. It appeared to me, that the greatest Service which could be rendered to the People of the Town, was to lay before them, the Law as it stood that they might be fully apprized of the Dangers of various kinds, which must arise from intemperate heats and irregular commotions. Although the Clamour was very loud, among some Sorts of People, it has been a great Consolation to me through Life, that I acted in this Business with steady impartiality, and conducted it to so happy an Issue

THE BRACE OF ADAMSES.  
  
&quot;I immediately attended the Gene  
ral Court, at Cambridge, to which  
place the Governor had removed it,  
to punish the town of Boston, in  
obedience, however, as he said,  
suppose truly, to an instruction he  
had received from, the King. The  
proceedings of the legislature at that  
time and place, may be seen in their  
(journals, if not lost. Among other  
things will be found a labored contro  
versy, between the House and the  
Governor, concerning these words:  
&#x27;In General Court assembled, and by  
the authority of the same.&quot; I men­  
tion this merely on account of an  
anecdote, which the friends of the  
governor Shirley, who then lived in  
retirement at his seat in Koxbury.  
&quot;Having read this dispute, in pub­  
lic prints, he asked. &#x27;Who has revi­  
ved those old words? They were  
expunged during m administration.&#x27;  
He was answered. &#x27;The .Boston  
seat.&#x27; &#x27;And who are the Boston seat&quot;  
&#x27;Mr. Cushing, Mr. Hancock, Mr  
Samuel Adams, and Mr John  
Adams.&#x27; &#x27;Mr. Cushing I knew, and  
Mr. Hancock, I knew,&#x27; replied the  
old Governor, &#x27;but where the devil  
this brace of Adamses came from, 1  
know not. This was archly circu  
lated by the ministerialists, lo impress

original of the country used to call

‘‘ The year 1770 was memorable enough in these little annals  
of my pilgrimage. The evening of the 5th of March I spent at  
Mr. Henderson Inches’s house, at the south end of Boston, in  
company with a club with whom I had been associated for several  
  
ears. About nine o’clock we were alarmed with the ringing of  
bells, and, supposing it to be the signal of fire, we snatched our  
hats and cloaks, broke up the club, and went out to assist in  
quenching the fire, or aiding our friends who might be in danger.  
In the street we were informed that the British soldiers had fired  
on the inhabitants, killed some and wounded others, near the  
town-house. A crowd of people was flowing down the street to  
the scene of action. When we arrived, we saw nothing but some

field-pieces, placed before the south door of the town-house, and  
some engineers and grenadiers drawn up to protect them. Mrs.  
Adams was then in circumstances to make me apprehensive of  
the effect of the surprise upon her, who was alone, excepting her  
maids and a boy, in the house. Having therefore surveyed round  
the town-house, and seeing all quiet, 1 walked down Boylston  
Alley into Brattle Square, where a company or two of regular  
soldiers were drawn up in front of Dr. Cooper’s old church, with  
their muskets all shouldered, and-their bayonets all fixed. I had  
no other way to proceed but along the whole front in a very nar-  
row space which they had left for foot passengers. Pursuing my  
way, without taking the least notice of them, or they of me, any  
more than if they had been marble statues, I went directly home  
to Cole Lane.  
  
‘“‘ My wife having heard that the town was still, and likely to  
continue so, had recovered from her first apprehensions, and we  
had nothing but our reflections to interrupt our repose. ‘These  
reflections were to me disquieting enough. Endeavors had been  
systematically pursued for many months, by certain busy charac-  
ters, to excite quarrels, rencounters, and combats, single or com-  
pound, in the night, between the inhabitants of the lower class  
and the soldiers, ‘and at all risks to enkindle an immortal hatred  
between them. I suspected that this was the explosion which had  
been intentionally wrought up by designing men, who knew what  
they were aiming at better than the instruments employed. If  
these poor tools should be prosecuted for any of their illegal con-  
duct, they must be punished. If the soldiers in self-defence should  
kill any of them, they must be tried, and, if truth was respected  
and the law prevailed, must be acquitted. ‘To depend upon the  
perversion of law, and the corruption or partiality of juries, would  
insensibly disgrace the jurisprudence of the country, and corrupt  
the morals of the people. It would be better for the whole peo-  
ple to rise in their majesty and insist on the removal of the army,  
and take upon themselves the consequences, than to excite such  
passions between the people and the soldiers as would expose  
both to continual prosecution, civil or criminal, and keep the town  
boiling in a continual fermentation. The real and full intentions  
of the British government and nation were not yet developed ;  
and we knew not whether the town would be supported by the  
country ; whether the Province would be supported by even our  
neighboring States of New England ; nor whether New England  
would be supported by the continent. ‘These were my medita-  
tions in the night.

the steps of the town-house stairs, Mr. Forrest came in, who was

then called the Irish Infant. I had some acquaintance with him.  
With tears streaming from his eyes, he said, ‘ 1 am come with a  
very solemn message from a very unfortunate man, Captain  
Preston, in prison. He wishes for counsel, and can get none. I  
have waited on Mr. Quincy, who says he will engage, if you will  
give him your assistance ; without it, he positively will not.  
Even Mr. Auchmuty declines, unless you will engage.’ I had no  
hesitation in answering, that counsel ought to be the very last  
thing that an accused person-should want in a free country ;  
that the bar ought, in my opinion, to be independent and impar-  
tial, at all times and in every circumstance, and that persons  
whose lives were at stake ought to have the counsel they pre-  
ferred. But he must be sensible this would be as important a  
cause as was ever tried in any court or country of the world;  
and that every lawyer must hold himself responsible not only to  
his country, but to the highest and most infallible of all tribunals,  
for the part he should act. He must, therefore, expect from me  
no art or address, no sophistry or prevarication, in such a cause,  
nor any thing more than fact, evidence, and law would justify.  
‘Captain Preston,’ he said, ‘ requested and desired no more ;  
and that he had such an opinion from all he had heard from all  
parties of me, that he could cheerfully trust his life with me  
upon those principles.” ‘ And,’ said Forrest, ‘ as God Almighty  
is my judge, I believe him an innocent man.’ I replied, ‘ that  
must be ascertained by his trial, and if he thinks he cannot have  
a fair trial of that issue without my assistance, without hesitation,  
he shall have it.’  
  
* Upon this, Forrest offered me a single guinea as a retaining  
fee, and I readily accepted it. From first to last I never said a  
word about fees, in any of those cases, and I should have said  
nothing about them here, if calumnies and insinuations had not  
been propagated that | was tempted by great fees and enormous  
sums of money. Before or after the trial, Preston sent me ten  
guineas, and at the trial of the soldiers afterwards, eight guineas  
more, which were all the fees I ever received or were offered to  
me, and I should not have said any thing on the subject to my  
clients if they had never offered me any thing. ‘This was all the  
pecuniary reward [ ever had for fourteen or fifteen days’ labor in  
the most exhausting and fatiguing causes I ever tried, for hazard-  
ing a popularity very general and very hardly earned, and for  
incurring a clamor, popular suspicions and prejudices, which are  
not yet worn out, and never will be forgotten as long as the his-  
tory of this period is read,”  
  
The trial of Captain, Preston and his men was continued  
for one term, and, in the mean time, an election came on for

*“*Preston’s trial was taken down, in short hand, and sent to  
England, but was never printed here. I told the court and jury,  
in both causes, that, as | was no authority, | would propose to  
them no law from my own memory, but would read to them all I  
had to say of that nature from books, which the court knew, and  
the counsel on the other side must acknowledge, to be iadisputa-

ties were so clear and full, that no question of law was made.  
The juries in both cases, in my opinion, gave correct verdicts.  
It appeared to me, that the greatest service which could be ren-  
dered to the people of the town, was to lay before them the law  
as it stood, that they might be fully apprized of the dangers of  
various kinds which must arise from intemperate heats and irregu-

some .sorts of people, it has been a great consolation to me,  
through life, that I acted in this business with steady impartiality,

tative of Boston.] I went down to Faneuil  
Hall, and in a few words expressive of my  
sense of the difficulty and danger of the times,  
of the importance of the trust, and of mv own  
insufficiency to fulfill the expectations of the  
people, I accepted the choice. Many congrat­  
ulations were offered, which I received civilly,  
but they gave no joy to me. I considered the  
step as a devotion of try family to ruin, and  
myself to death; for I could scarce perceive a  
possibility that I should ever go through the  
thorns and leap all the precipices before me,  
and escape with my,life. At this time I had  
more business at the bar than any man in the .  
province. My health was feeble. I was throw­  
ing away as bright prospects as any man ever  
had before him, and I had devoted myself to  
end&#x27;ess labor and anxiety, if not to infamy and  
to death, and that for nothing, except what in­  
deed was and ought to be in all, a sense of du­  
ty. In the evening, I expressed to Mrs. Adams  
all my apprehensions. That excellent lady,  
who has always encouraged me, burst into a  
flood of tears, but said she was sensible of all  
the dangers to her and to our children, as well  
as to me, but she thought I had done as I ought:  
she was very willing to share in all that was  
to come, and to place her trust in Providence.

“The next morning, I think it was, sitting in my office, near the steps of the town-  
house stairs, Mr. Forrest came in, who was then called the Irish Infant. I had some  
uaintance with him. With tears streaming from his eyes, he said, ‘I am come  
with a very solemn message from a very unfortunate man, Captain Preston, in  
prison. He wishes for counsel, and can get none. I have waited on Mr. Quincy,  
who says be will engage, if you will give him your assistance ; without it, he posi-  
tively will not. Even Mr. Auchmuty declines, unless you will &gt; I had no  
hesitation in answering, that counsel ought to be the very last thing that an accused  
shoul! want in a free country ; that the bar ought, in my opinion, to be in-  
pendent and impartial, at all times, and in every circumstance, and that  
whose lives were at stake ought to have the counsel they preferred. But he must  
be sensible this would be as important a cause as was ever tried in any court or  
country of the world; and that every lawyer must hold himself responsible not  
only to his country, but to the highest and most infallible of all tribunals, for the  
part he should act. He must, therefore, expect from me no art or address, no  
sophistry, or prevarication, in such a cause, nor anything more than fact, evidence  
and law would justify. ‘Captain Preston,’ he said, ‘requested and desired no more ;  
and that he had such an opinion from all he had heard from all ies of me, that  
he could cheerfully trust his life with me upon those principles.’ ‘And,’ said For-  
rest, ‘as God Almighty is my judge, I believe him an innocent man.’ I replied, ‘ that  
must be ascertained by his trial, and if he thinks he cannot have a fair trial of that  
issue without my assistance, without hesitation, he shall have it !’” pp. 230-1.  
  
His retaining fee was a single guinea ; and all he ever received
