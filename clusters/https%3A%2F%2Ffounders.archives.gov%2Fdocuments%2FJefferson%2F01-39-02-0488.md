In compliance with a request of the House of Representatives of the US. as well as with a sense of what is necessary, I take the liberty of urging on you the importance and indispensible necessity of vigorous exertions, on the part of the state governments, to carry into effect the militia system adopted by the national legislature, agreeably to the powers reserved to the states respectively, by the constitution of the US. and in a manner the best calculated to ensure such a degree of military discipline, &amp; knowledge of tactics, as will, under the auspices of a benign providence, render the militia a sure and permanent bulwark of national defence.  
None but an armed nation can dispense with a standing army. to keep ours armed and disciplined, is therefore at all times important. but especially so at a moment when rights the most essential to our welfare have been violated, and an infraction of treaty committed without colour or pretext. and altho’ we are willing to believe that this has been the act of a subordinate agent only, yet it is wise to prepare for the possibility that it may have been the leading measure of a system. While therefore we are endeavoring, and with a considerable degree of confidence, to obtain by friendly negociation a peaceable redress of the injury, and effectual provision against it’s repetition, let us array the strength of the nation, and be ready to do with promptitude &amp; effect whatever a regard to justice &amp; our future security may require.
