 Possession of Paulus Hook and Bergen Point, Places on the Jersy side of the North River.  
By this Time their Force is so divided between Staten Island, Long Island, New York, Paulus Hook and Bergen Point, that, I think they will do no great Matter more this fall, unless the Expiration of the Term of Inlistment of our Army, should disband it. If our new Inlistments fill up, for Soldiers during the War, We shall do well enough.—Every Body must encourage this.  
You are told that a Regiment of Yorkers behaved ill, and it may be true, but I can tell you that several Regiments of Massachusetts Men have behaved ill, too.  
The Spirit of Venality, you mention, is the most dreadfull and alarming Enemy, that America has to oppose. It is as rapacious and insatiable as the Grave. We are in the Fasce Romuli, non Republica Platonis. This predominant Avarice will ruin America, if she is ever ruined. If God almighty does not interpose by his Grace to controul this universal Idolatry to the Mammon of Unrighteousness, We shall be given up to the Chastisements of his Judgments. I am ashamed of the Age I live in.  
  
You surprise me with your Account of the Prayers in publick for an Abdicated King, a Pretender to the Crown. Nothing of that Kind is heard in this Place, or any other Part of the Continent, but New York and the Place you mention. This Practice is Treason against the State and cannot be long tolerated.  
I lament the Loss of Soper, as an honest, and usefull Member of Society.  
Dont leave off writing to me—I write as often as

The chapter on Religion shows plainly that however  
devout a few men and women were during the Revo-  
lutionary period, religion itself was not so generally  
expected nor so influential upon society as at the  
present day. How much this lack of influence was  
due to the repellent nature of the service and the doc-  
trive the author does not tell us. One of the long-  
departed curiosities of the last century is quite fully  
described. It should be remembered that in thos

Unfortunately, venality was not the  
ve vice of the times. There were many  
and grave departures from the standards,  
at least from those standards which are  
commonly accepted now. Intemperance  
and grosser immoralties were common,  
and had not the force of public sentiment  
to struggle with which has been raised up  
against them in recent times. Profane-  
ness, Which is now both unchristian and  
ungentlemanly, was at least hardly un-
