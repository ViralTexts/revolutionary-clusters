At another General Court Martial whereof Colonel Nixon was President the 6th day of April last, a certain Isaac Depue was tried for “Assisting to seize and secretly convey to places within the possession of the british forces Major Blauvelt and Hermanus Talman, loyal Citizens of the State of New-York” unanimously adjudged guilty of the charge exhibited against him and in pursuance of a resolution of Congress of the 7th of February 1778. unanimously sentenced to suffer death, by being hung by the Neck until he shall be dead.

Likewise Joseph Bettys was tried for “Having been a Spy for General Burgoyne (in the service of the enemy) by coming within the American lines in the State of New-York in a secret manner and returning again to the enemies of the United States, and for having forged a certificate to facilitate the execution thereof,” found guilty and unanimously sentenced to suffer death, by being hung by the Neck ’till he shall be dead.  
The Commander in Chief confirms the aforegoing sentences.  
A certain Stephen Smith was also tried by a General Court-Martial whereof Lieutenant Colonel Loring was President the 6th of January last for “Being a Spy, by coming frequently within the American lines in the States of New-York and Connecticutt in a secret manner and returning to the enemies of the United-States”—found guilty and unanimously sentenced to suffer death.  
Which sentence was afterwards approved by Major General McDougall.  
This day, being the Anniversary of our glorious Independence will be commemorated by the firing of Thirteen Cannon from West-Point at one ô clock P.M.  
The Commander in Chief thinks proper to grant a general pardon to all Prisoners in this Army under sentence of death—They are to be released from confinement accordingly.  
  
At a Brigade General Court-Martial June 24th 79. Lieutenant Colonel Davidson President, William Shields Waggon-Master to the North-Carolina Brigade was tried.  
1st—“For exchanging a public horse as one of his own property.”  
2nd—“For stealing the Waggoner’s forage.”  
3rdly—“For having offered for sale (or to exchange) a public Mare (as his own property) which he drew out of the continental yard for the use of the brigade.”  
4thly—“For having sold (to the driver of Major Murphy’s private team) two collars which he drew for the use of the brigade, and  
5thly—“For selling to a soldier (at near double price) cloathing he drew out of the public Store and paid for.”  
The Court do acquit him of the 1st charge but find him guilty of the last four and sentence him to be dismissed the service.  
The General is sorry to differ in opinion, in part, from the Court— It appears to him that the first charge was better supported than the second.  
Shields had no right to take the horse in the first instance, but when he was taken and put into the public service, which appears to have been the case, he became a public horse and the public was responsible for him to the original owner, therefore as he afterwards took this horse and exchanged him as his own, the first charge appears well founded.  
His being Waggon Master and taking forage from the Waggoners under him for the use of his own horses even tho’ it may have been done irregularly or wantonly can hardly be considered as a theft which the charge declares.  
These reasons do not permit the General to confirm the sentence but as Mr Shields appears to have been very culpable upon the whole, the General recommends it to the Quarter Master General immediately to dismiss him from the service.  
The General requests the commanding officers of those regiments who have furnished men for his guard to send without delay to the Adjutant General, certificates of the time of service for which they are respectively engaged

At a brigade general court martial the  
24th ult., Lieutenant Colonel Davidson,

1st. For exchanging a public horse as  
one of his own property.  
  
2nd. For stealing the wagoner’s for-  
age.  
3d. For having offered to sale (or ex-

yard for the use of the brigade.  
  
4th. For having sold to the driver of  
Major Murphy’s private team, two collars,  
which he drew for the use of the brig-  
ade.  
  
sth. For selling to a soldier, at near  
double price, clothing he drew out of the  
public store and paid for.  
  
The court do acquit him of the first  
charge, but find him guilty of the last  
four, and sentence him to be dismissed  
the service.  
  
The General is sorry to differ in opinion  
in part from the court. It appears to him  
that the first charge was better supported  
than the second. Shields had no right to  
take the horse in the first instance; but when  
he was taken and put into the public serv-  
ice, which appears to have been the case,  
he became a public horse, and the public  
was responsible for him to the original  
owner; therefore, as he afterwards took  
this horse and exchanged him as his own,  
the first charge appears well founded.  
His being a waggon-master, and taking  
forage for the waggoners under him for  
the use of his own horses, even though it  
may have been done irregularly and  
wantonly, can hardly be considered as a  
theft which the charge declares. These  
reasons do not permit the General to con-

pears to have been very culpable upon the  
whole, the General recommends it to the  
Q. M. General immediately to dismiss  
him from the service.  
  
The General requests the commanding  
officers of those regiments who have furn-  
‘ished men for his guard to send, without
