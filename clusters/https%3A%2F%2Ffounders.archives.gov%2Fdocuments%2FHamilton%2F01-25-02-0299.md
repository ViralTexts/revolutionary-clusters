It is generally understood that the Essays under the Title of the Federalist, which were published at New York, while the plan of our present Federal Constitution was under the consideration of the people, were principally written by two persons  
James Madison, now Secretary of State, Alexander Hamilton, formerly Secretary of the Treasury.  
who had been members of the Convention which devised that plan, and whose names are subscribed to the instrument containing it. In these Essays  
Particularly Nos. XLVII to LI inclusive, and Nos. LXXVIII to LXXXII inclusive.  
the principles advanced in the last number of this Examination are particularly stated and strongly relied upon in defence of the proposed Constitution; from which it is a natural inference that they had influenced the views with which the plan was digested. The full force of this observation will be best perceived by a recurrence to the work itself; but it will appear clearly enough from the following detached passages.  
“One of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the Constitution, is its supposed violation of the political maxim that the Legislative, Executive and Judiciary Departments ought to be separate and distinct.” “No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all power, Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many; whether hereditary, self appointed or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tryanny.”  
No. XLVII.  
“Neither of the three Departments ought to possess directly or indirectly an overruling influence over the others in the administration of their respective powers.” “But the most difficult task is to provide some practical security for each against the invasion of the others.”  
“Experience assures us that the efficacy of parchment barriers has been greatly overrated, and that some more adequate defence is indispensably necessary for the more feeble against the more powerful members of the government. The Legislative Department is every where extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.” “In a representative republic, where the executive magistracy is carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired by a supposed influence over the people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude; yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes; it is against the enterprising ambition of this department, that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.” Again, “The tendency of Republican Governments is to an aggrandizement of the Legislature at the expence of the other Departments.”  
  
These passages recognise as a fundamental maxim of free government, that the three departments of power, ought to be separate and distinct; consequently that neither of them ought to be able to exercise, either directly or indirectly, an overruling influence over any other. They also recognize as a truth, indicated by the nature of the system and verified by experience, that in a Representative Republic, the Legislative Department is the “Aaron’s Rod” most likely to swallow up the rest, and therefore to be guarded against with particular care and caution: And they inculcate that parchment barriers, (or the formal provisions of a constitution designating the respective boundaries of authority) having been found ineffectual for protecting the more feeble against the most powerful members of the government, some more adequate defence, some practical security is necessary. What this was intended to be will appear from subsequent passages.  
“To what expedient shall we finally resort for maintaining in practice the necessary partition of power among the several Departments as laid down in the Constitution?” “As all exterior provisions are found to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied by so contriving the interior structure of the government as that its several constituent Departments may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places.”  
No. LI.  
  
These passages intimate the “practical security” which ought to be adopted for the preservation of the weaker against the stronger members of the Government. It is so to contrive its interior structure that the constituent organs may be able to keep each other in their proper places; an idea essentially incompatible with that of making the existence of one dependent on the will of another. It will be seen afterwards how this structure is to be so contrived.  
“In order to lay a foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent, is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty; it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others. This principle rigorously adhered to would require that all the appointments for the several departments should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people.” But “In the constitution of the Judiciary Department it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle; first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be [to] select that mode of choice, which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that Department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them.”  
“It is equally evident that the members of each Department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the Executive Magistrate or the Judges not independent of the Legislature in this particular, their Independence in every other would be merely nominal.” “The great security against a concentration of the several powers in the same Department consists in giving to those who administer each Department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.” “But it is not possible to give to each Department an equal power of self-defence. In Republican Governments the Legislative authority necessarily predominates.”  
The means held out as proper to be employed, for enabling the several departments to keep each other in their proper places, are:  
1. To give to each such an organization as will render them essentially independent of one another. 2. To secure to each a support which shall not be at the discretionary disposal of any other. 3. To establish between them such mutual relations of authority as will make one a check upon another, and enable them reciprocally to resist enroachments, and confine one another within their proper spheres.  
To accomplish the first end, it is deemed material that they should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of one another, and should all emanate directly from the same fountain of authority—the people: And that it being expedient to relax the principle, in respect to the Judiciary Department, with a view to a more select choice of its organs; this defect in the creation ought to be remedied by a permanent tenure of office; which certainly becomes nominal and nugatory, if the existence of the office rests on the pleasure of the Legislature. The principle that the several organs should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of each other, is directly opposed to the claim in favour of one of a discretionary agency to destroy another. The second of the proposed ends, is designed to be effected by the provisions for fixing the compensations of the Executive and Judicial Departments—The third, by the qualified negative of the Executive, or the acts of the two houses of Congress; by the right of one of these houses to accuse; of the other to try and punish the Executive and Judicial officers; and lastly, by the right of the Judges, as interpreters of the laws, to pronounce unconstitutional acts void.  
These are the means contemplated by the Constitution, for maintaining the limits assigned to itself, and for enabling the respective organs of the Government to keep each other in their proper places, so that they may not have it in their power to domineer the one over the other, and thereby in effect, though not in form, to concentrate the powers in one department, overturn the Government, and establish a Tyranny. Unfortunate if these powerful precautions shall prove insufficient to accomplish the end, and to stem the torrent of the Imposter—Innovation disguised in the specious garb of Patriotism!  
The views which prevailed in the formation of the Constitution are further illustrated by these additional comments from the same source.  
No. LXXVIII  
  
“As liberty can have nothing to fear from the Judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of such an union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as from the natural feebleness of the Judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence, as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution; and in a great measure as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.”  
“The complete Independence of the Courts of Justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution. Limitations can be preserved in practice no other way, than through the medium of the Courts of Justice to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.”  
Then follows a particular discussion of the position, that it is the right and the duty of the Courts to exercise such an authority: to repeat which, would swell this number to an improper size.  
The essence of the argument is, that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised is void; consequently that no legislative act, inconsistent with the Constitution, can be valid. That it is not a natural presumption that the Constitution intended to make the legislative body the final and exclusive judges of their own powers; but more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the bounds assigned to its authority. That the interpretation of the laws being the peculiar province of the Courts, and a Constitution being in fact a fundamental law, superior in obligation to a statute, if the Constitution and the statute are at variance, the former ought to prevail against the latter; the will of the people against the will of the agents; and the Judges ought in their quality of interpreters of the laws, to pronounce and adjudge the truth, namely, that the unauthorised statute is a nullity.  
“Nor (continues the commentator) does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature declared in its statute, stands in opposition to that of the people declared in the constitution, the Judges ought to be governed by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental.”  
“If then the Courts of Justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution, against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of Judicial offices.”  
But no proposition can be more manifest, than that this permancy of tenure must be nominal, if made defeasible at the pleasure of the Legislature, and that it is ridiculous to consider it as an obstacle to encroachments of the Legislative Department; if this department has a discretion to vacate or abolish it directly or indirectly.  
In recurring to the comments which have been cited, it is not meant to consider them as evidence of any thing but of the views with which the Constitution was framed. After all, the Instrument must speak for itself. Yet to candid minds, the co-temporary explanation of it, by men, who had had a perfect opportunity of knowing the views of its framers, must operate as a weighty collateral reason for believing the construction agreeing with this explanation to be right, rather than the opposite one. It is too cardinal a point, to admit readily the supposition, that there was misapprehension; and whatever motives may have subsequently occurred to bias the impressions of the one or the other of the purposes alluded to, the situation in which they wrote, exempts both from the suspicion of an intention to misrepresent in this particular. Indeed a course of argument more accommodating to the objections of the adversaries of the Constitution would probably have been preferred as most politic, if the truth, as conceived at the time, would have permitted a modification. Much trouble would have been avoided by saying, “The Legislature will have a complete controul over the Judges, by the discretionary power of reducing the number of those of the Supreme Court, and of abolishing the existing Judges of the Inferior Courts, by the abolition of the Courts themselves.” But this pretension is a novelty reserved for the crooked ingenuity of after discoveries.

THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
dency of republican governments is to an aggran-  
dizement of the legislative, at the expense of the other  
departments.&quot;  
  
These passages recognize, as a fundamental  
maxim of free government, that the three govern-  
ments of power, ought to be separate and distinct ;  
consequently that neither of them ought to be able  
to exercise, either directly or indirectly, an over-  
ruling influence over any other. They also recog-  
nize as a truth, indicated by the nature of the  
system, and verified by experience, that, in a re-  
presentative republic, the legislative department  
is the * Aaron’s rod” most likely to swallow up  
the rest, and therefore to be guarded against, with  
particular care and caution. And they inculcate,  
that parchment barriers (er the formal provisions  
of a constitution, designating the respective boun-  
daries of authority) having been found ineffectual  
for protecting the more feeble against the more  
powerful members of the government, some more  
adequate defence, some practical security is ne-  
cessarye What this was intended to be, will ap-  
pear from subsequent passages :  
  
“ To what expedient shall we finally resort, for  
maintaining in practice the necessary partition of  
power among the several departments, as laid  
down in the constitution?” “ As all exterior pro-  
visions are found to be inadequate, the defect  
must be supplied, by so contriving the interior  
stricture of the government, as that its several  
constituent departments may, by their mutual re-  
lations, be the means of keeping each other in  
their proper places.’’*  
  
These passages intimate the “ practical security”  
which ought to be adopted, for the preservation of  
the weaker against the stronger members of the  
rovernment. It is so to contrive its interior struc-  
ture, that the constituent organs may be able to  
keep each other in their proper places; an idea es-  
sentially incompatible with that of making the ex-  
istence of one dependent on the wy// of another.  
It will be scen afterwards, how this structure is to  
be so contrived.  
  
“ In order to lay a foundation for that separate  
and distinct exercise of the different powers of  
government, which, toa certain extent, is admitted  
on all hands, to be essential to the preservation of  
liberty, it is evident, that each department should  
have a will of its own; and consequently should  
be so constituted, that the members of each should  
have as little agency as possible, in the appoint-  
ment of the members of the others. This princi-  
ple, rigorously adhered to, would require that all  
the appointments, for the several departments,  
  
should be drawn from the same fountain of autho-  
  
rity, the people.” But, “ In the constitution of  
the judiciary department, it might be inexpedient  
to insist rigourously on the principle; first, be-  
cause peculiar qualifications being essential in the  
members, the primary consideraiion ought to be  
to select that mode of choice, which best secures  
these qualifications ; secondly, because the perma-  
nent tenure by which the appointments are held in  
that department, must soon destroy all sense of  
dependence on the authority conferring them.”  
“It is equally evident, that the members of each  
department should be as little dependent as pos-  
sible on those of the others, for the emoluments  
annexed to their offices. Were the executive  
magistrate or the judges not independent of the  
legislature, in this particular, their independence in  
every other would be merely nominal.” “ The  
great security against a concentration of the several  
powers, in the same department, consists in giving  
to those, who administer each department, the ze-  
cessary constitutional meuns and personal motives, to  
resist the encroachments of the others.” “ But  
it is not possible to give to each department an  
  
  
  
* No. LIL,  
  
  
  
equal power of self-defence. In republican ga.  
vernments, the legisiative authority necessarily  
predominates.”  
  
The means held out as proper to be employed,  
for enabling the several departments to keep each  
other in their proper places, are: 1. To give to  
each such an organization as will render them es-  
sentially independent of one another. 2. To se  
cure to each a support, which shall not be at the  
gies disposal of any other. 3. To esta-  
blish between them such mutual relutions of authos  
rity as will make one a check upon another, and  
enable them reciprocally to resist encroachments,  
and confine one another within their proper  
spheres.  
  
‘To accomplish the first end, it is deemed mates  
rial that they should have as little agency as possi-  
ble in the appointment of one another, and should,  
all emanate directly from the same fountain of  
authority....the people: And that it being expe-  
dient to relax the principle, in respect to the judi-  
ciary department, with a view to a more select  
choice of its organs; this defect in the creation  
ought to be remedied by a permanent tenure of of-  
fice ; which certainly becomes nominal and nuga-  
tory, if the existence of the office rests on the  
pleasure of the legislature. ‘The principle that  
the several organs should have as little agency as  
possible in the appointment of each other, is di-  
rectly opposed to the claim in favour of one of a  
discretionary agency to destroy another. These-  
cond of the proposed ends, is designed to be effec-  
ted by the provisions for fixing the campensations  
of the executive and judicial departments. The  
third, by the qualified negative of the executive, or  
the acts of the two houses of congress; by the  
right of one of these houses to accuse; of the other  
to try and punish the executive and judicial officers;  
and lastly, by the right of the judges, as interpre-  
ters of the laws, to pronounce unconstitutional  
acts void.  
  
These are the means contemplated by the con-  
stitution, for maintaining the limits assigned to it-  
self, and for enabling the respective organs of the  
government to keep each other in their proper  
places, so that they may not have it in their power  
‘to domineer the one over the other, and thereby,  
in effect, though not in form, to concentrate the  
powers in one department, overturn the govern-  
ment, and establish a tyranny. Unfortunate if  
these powerful precautions shall prove insufficient  
to accomplish the end, and to stem the torrent of  
the impostor....INNOVATION disguised in the spe-  
cious garb of Patriotism !  
  
‘The views, which prevailed in the formation of  
the constitution, are further illustrated by these ad-  
ditional comments from the same source*.  
  
“© As liberty cam have nothing to fear from the  
judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear  
from its union with either of the other depart-  
ments; that as all the effects of such an union  
must ensue from a dependence of the former on  
the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent  
separation ; that as frem the natural feebleness of  
the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being  
overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate  
branches; and that as nothing can contribute so  
much to its firmness and independence, as perma-  
nency in office, this quality may therefore be justly  
regarded as an indispensible ingredicnt in its con-  
stitution; and in agreat measure as the citadel of  
the public justice, and the public security.  
  
«“ The complete independence of the courts of  
justice is peculiarly essential in a limited consti-  
tution. Limitations can be preserved in practice  
no other way, than through the medium of the  
courts of justice to declare all acts contrary to the  
  
nanifest tenor of the constitution void.”

Then follows a particular discussion of the posi-  
tion, that it is the right and duty of the courts to  
exercise such an authority ; to repeat which, would  
swell this number to an improper size.  
  
The essence of the argument is, that every act  
of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor cf  
the commission, under which it is exercised, is  
yoid; consequently that no legislative act, incon-  
sistent with the constitution, can be valid. That  
it is not a natural presumption, that the constitu-  
tion intended to make the legislative body the final  
and exclusive judges of their own powers; but  
more rational to suppose that the courts were de-  
sizned to be an intermediate body between the  
people and the legislature, in order, among other  
things, to keep the latter within the bounds as-  
signed to its authority. That the interpretation  
of the laws being the peculiar province of the  
courts, and a constitution being in fact a funda-  
mental law, superior in obligation to a statute, if  
the constitution and the statute are at variance,  
the former ought to prevail against the latter; the  
will of the people against the will of the agents ;  
and the judges ought, in their quality of interpre-  
ters of the laws, to pronounce and adjudge the  
truth, namely, that the unauthorized statute is a  
nullity.  
  
“ Nor (continues the commentator) does this  
conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of  
the judicial to the legislative power. It only sup-  
poses that the power of the people is superior to  
both; and that where the will of the legislature,  
declared in its statuté, stands in opposition to that  
of the people, declared in the constitution, the  
judges ought to be governed by the lattef, rather  
than by the former. ‘They ought to regulate their  
decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by  
those, which are not fundamental.  
  
“ If then the courts of justice are to be consi-  
dered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution,  
against legislative encroachments, this considera-  
tion will afford a strong argument for the perma-  
nent tenure of judicial offices.”  
  
But no proposition can be more manifest, than  
that this permanency of tenure must be nominal,  
if made defeasible at the pleasure of the legisla-  
ture, and that it is ridiculous to consider it as an  
obstacle to encroachments of the legislative de-  
partment, if this department has a discretion to  
vacate or abolish it directly or indirectly.”  
  
In recurring to the comments, which have been  
cited, it is not meant to consider them as evidence  
of.any thing but of the views, with which the con-  
stitution was framed. After all, the instrument  
must speak for itself. Yet to candid minds, the  
co-temporary explanation of it, by men, who had  
had a perfect opportunity of knowing the views of  
its framers, must operate as a weighty collateral  
reason for believing the construction agreeing with  
this explanation to be right, rather than the oppo-  
site one. It istoo cardinal a point, to admit readi-  
ly the supposition, that there was misapprehension;  
and whatever motives may have subsequently oc-  
curred to bias the impressions of the one or the  
other of the purposes alluded to, the situation, in  
which they wrote, exempts both of an intention to  
misrepresent in this particular. Indeed a course  
of argument more accommodating to the objec-  
tions of the adversaries of the constitution would  
probably have been preferred as most politic, ifthe  
truth, as conceived at the time, would have per-  
mitted a modification. Much trouble would have  
been avoided by saying, “ The legislature will  
have a complete controul over the judges, by the  
discretionary power of reducing the number of  
those of the supreme court, and of abolishing the  
existing judges of the inferior courts, by the aboli-  
tion of the courts themselves.’”’ But this preten-  
Sion is a novelty reserved for the crooked ingenu-  
ity of after discoveries.

ice azures us that the efficacy of parch

seflary for the snore feeble againrt the  
werfnl members of the government,  
{illative department is every where ex­  
the fphere of its activity and drawing  
rr into its impetuous vortex.” “ In a  
tative republic, where the executive

the daraiion of its power ; and where

TWc paflages recognize as a fundamental

u It 19 equally evident that the members of ,j

The means held out as proper tp be employed |

To accomplice the 6rft end, it is deemed  
material that they fhould have as little agency  
as poftibie in the appointment of one another,  
and Ihojuld all emanate diredly from the fame

being: expedient 10 rehx »he principle, in refpift

The principle that the feveral organs fhould  
have as little agency as poffibie in the appoint­  
ment of each other, is direSly opp&lt; fed to the  
claim in favor of one of a difcretionary agency  
to deftroy another. The fecond of the propofed  
ends is defigned t« be effected by the provifions  
for fixing the cnmpenfations of the Executive  
and Judicial Departments : The third, by the  
qualified negative of the Executive, or the a&amp;s  
of the two Houfes of Congrefs; by the right  
of one of tfcefe Houfes to accufe,—of the other  
to try and punifti, the Executive and Judicial  
officers ; and iaftly, by the right of the Judges,  
as interpreters of the laws, to pronounce uncon -  
ftitu&#x27;ional alls void, f  
Thefe are the means contemplated by the  
conftitution. for maintaining the limits affigned  
to ittelf, and for embracing the refpetfive organs  
of the Government to keep each other in their  
proper places, fo that they may not have it in  
their power to domineer the one over the other,  
and thereby in effell, though not in form, to  
concentrate the powers in one department,  
overturn the Government and eftablifti a tyra­  
ny. Unfortunate if thefe powerful precautions  
(hail prove inefficient to accomplifti the end,  
and to ftem the torrent of the impofter, Inno  
vation, difguifed in the fpccious garb o( patri­  
tifm !  
The views which prevailed in the formation  
of the conftitution are further illuftrated by thefe  
additional comments from the fame fource.*  
“As liberty can have nothing to fear from  
the judiciary alone, but would have every thing  
to fear from its union with either of the other  
J departments ; that as all the effeds of fuch an  
union mull enfue from a dependence of the |  
former on the latter, notwitbftanding a nominal  
and apparent reparation ; that as from the nat­  
ural fecblcnefs of the Judiciary, it is in contin­  
ual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed or  
influenced by its co ordinate branches ; and  
that as nothing can contribute fo much to its  
firmnefs and independence, as permanency in office,  
this quality may therefore be joftly regarded as  
an indifpcofable ingredient in its conftitution ;  
and in a great roeafure as the citadel of the  
public juftice and the public facurity.”  
“ The complete independence of the Courts  
of Juftice is peculiarly eflential in a limited con­  
ftitution. Limitations can be preferved in prac  
tice no other way, than through the medium  
of the Courts of Juftice to declare all afts con­  
trary to the manifeft tenor of (be conftitution  
void.”  
Then follows a particular difeufiaoa of the  
• No. LXXVIII.  
  
aw* » ^  
• t - ♦  
pofitioos that it ii thv right and the duty cf the  
jjfcooru, tb-erercifr fuch so authority ; tv repeat  
which, would fwell this nUmbet to an improper  
&amp;ze.  
The eHence of the argument is, that bvery  
*3 ri&#x27; a deiegatfd authority, contrary to the  
tcuftf of the commiffien under which it is  
tec tied, is void ; cbnfeqoently that no legilla­  
tive a&amp;, incontinent with thv conftituTion, can  
be Valid. Thar it is not a natural prefumptioft  
that the conftiiution intended to make the le­  
giiiaiivc body the final and exclusive judges of  
their own powers | hot more rational to fuppofe  
that the courts were defigned to bean intermc  
dials body between the people and the legilla­  
tutt, in order among other things, to keep the  
latter within the bounds affigned to its authori­  
ty. That the interpretation of the laws being  
the pecoiiar provice of the courts, and a ton  
dilution being in lad a fundamental law, fupv.  
Ttor in obligation to a ftatutc, if the conftiiution  
and the ftatutv are at variance, the former ought  
i to prevail again ft the latter ; the will of the  
people againft the will of the agents; and the  
judges cughr imtbeir quality or interpreters of  
the laws, to pronounce and adjudge the truth,  
namely, that the unauthorifed Itatute is a  
nullity.  
u N* r (continues the commentator) does this  
conclution by any means fuppofe a fuperiority  
of the judicial to the legiflative power, liouiy  
fopmofr* dun tne power ot tne people is fuperior  
0o&#x27; noth f and that where the will cf the legilla.  
lure, declared in its ftatute, ftands in oppotition  
ro chat of the people declared in the eonfti utidn,  
the Judges ought to he governed by the latter,  
rather lhan the*fbrmer. They ought to regu  
late their decffiions by the fundamental laws,  
nther than by thofe which are not fundamen­  
tal M  
*• If then the Courts ofjuftice are to be con  
fidercd as the bulwarks of a limited conftitution,  
againft legiflative encroachments, this confider­  
a ion will afford a ftrong argument for the per  
iramnt tenure of Judicial offices.**  
But nv proposition can be more manifeft, than  
that this permanency of tenure muft be norm j  
hal, if made defeafible at the”pleafure of the  
Leg flature, and that it is ridiculous to confider  
it as an obllacle to encioachments of thv Legif  
1-stive Department, if this department has a  
difcre’ion to vacate of abolilh it dire&amp;iy or in*  
ditetfly.  
  
in recurring to the comment* which have  
been cited, it i* not meant to confider them  
as evidence of any thing but of the view* with  
which the conftitution was framed. After all,  
the inftrument muft fpcak for itielf. Yet to  
candid minds, the co temporary explanation of  
ii, by men, who had had a peifed opportunity  
of knowing the view* of its framer*, muft ope­  
rate a&gt; a weighty collateral reafon for believing  
the eonftrudion agreeing with this explanation  
to be right, rather than the rppofite one. It is  
too cardinal a point to admit readily the fuppo­  
fition that there was mifapprehenfion ; and  
whatever motives may have fubfeqjeiuly occur­  
red to bias the imp re (lions of ^he one or the oth.  
er of the perfen&#x27;s alluded to, the fituaticn in  
which they wmte^ exempt* both from the for*  
picion of an intention to mifreptefent in this  
particular. Indeed a conrfe of argument more  
accommodating to the objedions of the adver |  
faries of the Conftituiim would probably have  
been preferred as mod politic, if the truth, a*  
conceived at the time, weuld have permitted a  
modification. Much trouble would have been  
avcided by faying, “ The Legiflature will have  
a complete controul over the Judges, by the  
diferetionary power of reducing the number of  
thofc of the Supreme Cou-t, and of aboli&amp;ing  
the exifting Judges of the Inferior Courts, by  
the abolition of the Courts tbemfelves.” But  
this pretention i* a novelty referved for the  
crooked ingenuity of after difeoverics.

WARNINGS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY STATESMEN.  
  
And yet the statesmen of that day had a full understanding  
of these defects. Listen to Madison, in the Federalist: “The  
accumulation of all powers—Legislative, Executive and Judi-  
ciary—in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many,  
and whether hereditary, self-appointed or elective, may justly  
be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” After com-  
paring at length the provisions of these State Constitutions,  
he says: “They carry strong marks of the haste and still  
stronger of the inexperience under which they were framed,  
and in some instances the fundamental principle under con-  
sideration has been violated by too great a mixture or even  
an actual consolidation of the different powers.” ... “The  
Legislative Department is everywhere extending the sphere

nately there were wiser men, who thought with Hamilton :  
“The Courts of Justice should be the bulwarks of a limited  
constitution against legislative encroachments.” The good  
sense of the Convention brushed aside these jealousies and  
gave the Judiciary the ample powers it now possesses, Of  
the growth of these powers by judicial construction I will  
speak presently. Another influence, supported by such men,  
as Madison, Wilson and Morris, would have combined the  
Judges of the Supreme Court with the President in the exer-  
cise of the veto power, after the model of the Council of  
Revision in New York, unmindful of the danger of mingling  
the powers of the different departments. This, too, was  
happily overruled in the convention.
