Memorandums taken on a journey from Paris into the Southern parts of France and Northern of Italy, in the year 1787.  
Champagne. March 3. Sens to Vermanton. The face of the country is in large hills, not too steep for the plough, somewhat resembling the Elk hill and Beverdam hills of Virginia. The soil is generally a rich mulatto loam, with a mixture of coarse sand and some loose stone. The plains of Yonne are of the same colour. The plains are in corn, the hills in vineyard, but the wine not good. There are a few apple trees but none of any other kind, and no inclosures. No cattle, sheep, or swine. Fine mules.  
Few chateaux. No farm houses, all the people being gathered in villages. Are they thus collected by that dogma of their religion which makes them believe that, to keep the Creator in good humor with his own works, they must mumble a mass every day? Certain it is that they are less happy and less virtuous in villages than they would be insulated with their families on the grounds they cultivate. The people are illy clothed. Perhaps they have put on their worst clothes at this moment as it is raining. But I observe women and children carrying heavy burthens, and labouring with the hough. This is an unequivocal indication of extreme poverty. Men, in a civilised country, never expose their wives and children to labour above their force or sex, as long as their own labour can protect them from it. I see few beggars. Probably this is the effect of a police.  
Burgundy. Mar. 4. Lucy le bois. Cussy les forges. Rouvray. Maison-neuve. Vitteaux. La Chaleure. Pont de Panis. Dijon. The hills are higher and more abrupt. The soil a good red loam and sand, mixed with more or less grit, small stone, and sometimes rock. All in corn. Some forest wood here and there, broom, whins and holly, and a few inclosures of quick hedge. Now and then a flock of sheep.  
The people are well clothed, but it is Sunday. They have the appearance of being well fed. The Chateau de Sevigny, near Cussy les forges is in a charming situation. Between Maison neuve and Vitteaux the road leads through an avenue of trees 8. American miles long in a right line. It is impossible to paint the ennui of  this avenue.

gons. The road, in this part of the country, is divided into portions of 40. or 50. feet by stones, numbered, which mark the task of the labourers.  
March 7. 8. From La Baraque to Chagny. On the left are plains which extend to the Saone, on the right the ridge of mountains called the Cote. The plains are of a reddish-brown, rich loam, mixed with much small stone. The Cote has for it’s basis a solid rock on which is about a foot of soil, and small stone in equal quantities, the soil red and of midling quality. The plains are in corn, the Cote in vines. The

o 60.₶ A farmer of 10. arpents has about three labourers engaged by the year. He pais 4. Louis to a man, and half as much to a woman, and feeds them. He kills one hog, and salts it, which is all the meat used in the family during the year. Their ordinary food is bread and vegetables. At Pommard and Voulenay I observed them eating good wheat bread; at Meursault, rye. I asked the reason of the difference. They told me that the white wines fail in quality much oftener than the red, and remain on hand. The farmer therefore cannot afford to feed his labourers so well. At Meursault, only white wines are made, because there is too much stone for the red. On such slight circumstances depends the condition of man

ers of the Saone and Loire.—Met a malefactor in the hands of one of the Marechaussée; perhaps a dove in the talons of the hawk. The people begin now to be in separate establishments, and not in villages. Houses are mostly covered with tile.  
Beaujolois. Maison blanche. St. George. Chateau de Laye Epinaye. The face of the country is like that from Chalons to Macon. The Plains are a dark rich loam, the hills a red loam, of midling quality, mixed generally with more or less coarse sand  and grit, and a great deal of small stone. Very little forest. The vineyards are mostly inclosed with dry stone wall. A few small cattle and sheep. Here, as in Burgundy, the cattle are all white.  
This is the richest country I ever beheld. It is about 10. or 12. leagues in length, and 3. 4. or 5. in breadth; at least that part of it which is under the eye of the traveller. It extends from the top of a ridge of mountains running parallel with the Saone, and sloping down to the plains of that river scarcely any where too steep for the plough. The whole is thick sown with farm houses, chateaux, and the Bastides of the inhabitants of Lyons. The people live separately, and not in villages. The hillsides are in wine and corn: the plains in corn and pasture. The lands are farmed either for money, or on half-stocks. The rents of the corn lands farmed for money are about 10. or 12.₶ the arpent. A farmer takes perhaps about 150. arpents for 3. 6. or 9. years. The 1st. year they are in corn, the 2d. in other small grain, with which he sows red clover; the 3d. is for the clover. The spontaneous pasturage is of greenswerd, which they call fromenteau. When lands are rented on half stocks, the cattle, sheep &amp;c. are furnished by the landlord. They are valued and must be left of equal value. The increase of these, as well as the produce of the farm, are divided equally. These leases are only from year to year. They have a method of mixing beautifully the culture of vines, trees and corn. Rows of fruit trees are

in brandy. The wages of a labouring man here are 5. Louis, of a woman one half. The women do not work with the hough: they only weed the vines, the corn, &amp;c. and spin. They speak a Patois very difficult to understand. I passed some time at the chateau de Laye epinaye. Monsieur de Laye has a seignory of about 15,000 arpens, in pasture, corn, vines, and wood. He has over this, as is usual, a certain jurisdiction both criminal and civil. But this extends only to the first crude examination, which is before his judges. The subject is referred for final examination and decision to the regular judicatures of the country. The Seigneur is keeper of the peace on his domains. He is therefore subject to the expences of  maintaining it. A criminal prosecuted to sentence and execution, costs M. de Laye about 5000.₶ This is so burthensome to the Seigneurs, that they are slack in criminal prosecutions. A good effect from a bad cause. Thro’ all Champagne, Burgundy and the Beaujolois, the husbandry seems good, except that they manure too little. This proceeds from the shortness of their leases. The people of Burgundy and Beaujolois are well clothed, and have the appearance of being well fed. But they experience all the oppressions which result from the nature of the general government, and from that of their particular tenures, and of the Seignorial government to which they are subject. What a cruel reflection that a rich country cannot long be a free one

There are few chateaux in this province. The people too are mostly gathered into villages. There are however some scattering farm houses. These are made either of mud or of round stone and mud. They make inclosures also in both those ways. Day laborers receive 16.s or 18.s the day, and feed themselves. Those by the year receive, men 3. Louis and women half that, and are fed. They rarely eat meat; a single hog salted being the year’s stock for a family. But they have plenty of cheese, eggs, potatoes and other vegetables, and walnut oil with their sallad.

Rozzano. Parmesan Cheese. It is supposed this was formerly made at Parma, and took it’s name thence, but none is made there now. It is made thro all the country extending from Milan 150. miles. The most is made about Lodi. The making of butter being connected with the making cheese, both must be described together. There are, in the stables I saw, 85. cows, fed on hay and grass, not on grain. They are milked twice in the 24. hours, 10 cows yeilding at the two milkings a brenta of milk, which is 24. of our gallons. The night’s milk is scummed in the morning at day break, when the cows are milked again and the new milk mixed with the old. In 3. hours the whole mass is scummed a second time, the milk remaining in a kettle for cheese, and the cream being put into a cylindrical churn, shaped like a grindstone, 18.I. radius and 14.I. thick. In this churn there are three staves pointing inwardly endwise to break the current of the milk. Thro it’s center passes an iron axis with a handle at each end. It is turned about an hour and an half by two men till the butter is produced. Then they pour off the buttermilk and put in some water which they agitate backwards and forwards about a minute, and  pour it off. They take out the butter, press it with their hands into loaves, and stamp it. It has no other washing. 16 American gallons of milk yield 15 ℔. of butter, which sells at 24 sous the ℔.  
The milk which after being scummed as before had been put into a copper kettle receives it’s due quantity of rennet and is gently warmed if the season requires it. In about 4. hours it becomes a slip. Then the whey begins to separate. A little of it is taken out. The curd is then thoroughly broken by a machine like a chocolate mill. A quarter of an ounce of saffron is put to 7. brenta of milk to give colour to the cheese. The kettle is then moved over the hearth, and heated by a quick fire till the curd is hard enough, being broken into small lumps by continual stirring. It is moved off the fire, most of the whey taken out, the curd compressed into a globe by the hand, a linen cloth slipped under it, and it is drawn out in that. A loose hoop is then laid on a bench and the curd, as wrapped in the linen is put into the hoop. It is a little pressed by the hand, the hoop drawn tight, and made fast. A board 2.I. thick is laid on it, and a stone on that of about 20 lb. weight. In an hour the whey is run off and the cheese finished. They sprinkle a little salt on it every other day in summer and every day in winter for 6. weeks. 7. brentas of milk make a cheese of 50. ℔., which requires 6. months to ripen, and is then dried to 45 ℔. It sells on the spot for 88₶ the 100. ℔. There are now 150. cheeses in this dairy. They are 19.I. diameter and 6.I. thick. They make a cheese a day in summer, and 2. in 3. days, or 1. in 2. days in winter.  
The whey is put back into the kettle, the butter milk poured into it, and of this they make a poor cheese for the country people. The whey of this is given to the hogs. 8. men suffice to keep the cows and do all the business of this dairy. Mascarponi, a kind of curd, is made by pouring some butter milk into cream, which is thereby curdled, and is then pressed in a linen cloth.  
The Ice-Houses at Rozzano are dug about 15.f. deep, and 20.f. diameter and poles are driven down all round. A conical thatched roof is then put over them 15f. high. Pieces of wood are laid at bottom to keep the ice out of the water which drips from it, and goes off by a sink. Straw is laid on this wood, and then the house filled with ice always putting straw between the ice and the walls, and covering ultimately with straw. About a third is lost by melting. Snow gives the most delicate flavor to creams; but ice is the most powerful congealer, and lasts longest. A tuft of trees surrounds these ice houses.

They become porters, carters, reapers, wood cutters, sailors, lock keepers, smiters on the anvil, cultivators of the earth &amp;c.

June 1. 2. The country from Nantes to Lorient is very hilly and poor, the soil grey. Nearly half is waste, in furze and broom, among which is some poor grass. The cultivated parts are in corn, some maize, a good many apple trees, no vines. All is in small inclosures of quick hedge and ditch. There are patches and hedgerows of forest wood, not quite deserving the name of timber. The people are mostly in villages, they eat rye bread and are ragged. The villages announce a general poverty as does every other appearance. Women smite on the anvil, and work with the hoe, and cows are yoked to labour.

March 9. From Chalons to Macon. “ Met a malefactor

the talons of the hawk. The people begin now to be in  
separate establishments and not in villages. Houses are  
mostly covered with tile.”

is about ten-of twelve leagues in length, and three or four  
or five in breadth; at least that part of it which is under the  
eye of the traveller . . . The whole is thick-set with farm  
houses, chateaux, and the Bastides of the inhabitants of  
Lyons. The people live separately and not in villages.  
The hill-sides are in vine and corn; the plains in corn and  
pasture. The lands are farmed either for money or on  
half-stocks. The rents of the corn lands, farmed for money,  
are about ten or twelve livres the arpent. . . . When lands  
are rented on half-stocks, the cattle, sheep, etc., are fur-  
nished by the landlord. They are valued and must be left  
of equal value. The increase of these as well as the pro-  
duce of the farm is divided equally. These leases are only  
from year to year. They have a method of mixing beauti-  
fully the culture of vines, trees and corn. . . . The wages  
of a laboring man here are five louis; of a woman, one-half.  
The women do not work with the hoe; they only weed the  
vines, the corn, etc., and spin. ...I passed some time  
at the Chateau de Laye-Epinaye. Monsieur de Laye has a  
seignory of about five thousand arpents in pasture, corn,  
vines and wood. He has over this, as is usual, a certain

The subject is referred for final examination and decision  
to the regular judicatures of the country. The Seigneur is  
keeper of the peace on his domains. He is therefore sub-  
ject to the expenses of maintaining it. A criminal prose-  
cuted to sentence and execution costs M. de Laye about  
five thousand livres. This is so burdensome to the Seig-  
neurs that they are slack in criminal prosecutions—a  
good effect from a bad cause. Through all Champagne,  
Burgundy and Beaujolois the husbandry seems good,  
except that they manure too little. This proceeds from  
the shortness of their leases. The people of Burgundy  
and Beaujolois are well clothed and have the appearance  
of being well fed. But they experience all the oppressions  
which result from the nature of the general government  
and from that of their particular tenures, and of the seig-  
norial government to which they are subject. What a  
cruel reflection that a rich country cannot long be a free  
one.

Dauphiné, March 15-18. “There are few chateaux in  
this province.__The-peepletoo,.are mostly gathered into  
villages. There are, however, some scattering farm houses.  
These are made either of mud or of round stone and mud.  
They make inclosures also in both these ways. Day lab-  
orers receive sixteen or eighteen sous the day and feed  
themselves. Those by the year receive, men, three louis,  
women half that, and are fed. They rarely eat meat; a  
single hog salted being the year’s stock for the family.  
But they have plenty of cheese, eggs, potatoes and other  
vegetables, and walnut oil with their salad.”

Aix, March 25-28. “The wages of a laboring man are  
one hundred and fifty livres the year, a woman’s sixty to  
sixty-six livres, and fed. Their bread is half wheat, half  
rye, made once in three or four weeks to prevent too great  
a consumption. In the morning they eat bread with an  
anchovy or an onion. Their dinner, in the middle of the  
day, is bread, soup and vegetables. Their supper the same.  
With their vegetables they have always oil and vinegar.  
The oil costs about eight sous the pound. They drink  
what is called piquette. This is made after the grapes are  
pressed, by pouring hot water on the pumice. On Sunday  
they have meat and wine.”

Le Saumal. Travelling via the Languedoc Canal. “ The  
barks which navigate it are seventy and eighty feet long,  
and seventeen or eighteen feet wide. They are drawn by  
one horse and worked by two hands, one of which is gen-  
erally a woman. The locks are mostly kept by women,  
but the necessary operations are much too laborious for  
them. The encroachment by the men on the offices proper  
for the women is a great derangement in the order of  
things. Men are shoemakers, tailors, upholsterers, stay-  
makers, mantua-makers, cooks, housekeepers, house-  
cleaners, bed-makers, they coeffe the ladies and bring them

take the offices which they abandon. They become por-  
ters, carters, reapers, sailors, lock-keepers, smiters on the  
anvil, cultivators of the earth, etc. Can we wonder if such  
of them as have a little beauty prefer easier courses to get  
their livelihood, as long as that beauty lasts?”  
  
Bordeaux, May 24. “The farmers live on their farms.  
. . . They never hire laborers by the year [in the vine-  
yards]. The day wages for a man are thirty sous, a  
woman’s, fifteen sous, feeding themselves. The women  
make the bundles of sarment, weed, pull off the snails, tie  
the vines, and gather the grapes. During the vintage are  
paid high and fed well.”

Near Rennes. “Some small separate houses, which  
seem to be the residence of laborers or very small farmers;  
the walls frequently of mud, and the roofs generally covered  
with slate.”  
  
Thus we see that Jefferson, after a long and leisurely  
trip through France, has left no very severe arraignment  
of the condition of the masses. He believed it would be  
better for them to live upon the farms rather than to be  
huddled together in villages, which is quite in harmony with  
the belief he always entertained that population should be  
scattered rather than greatly concentrated at a few points.  
But he finds numerous regions where this is the case. H
