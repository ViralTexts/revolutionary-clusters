Sir,  
Boston. December 4. 1754  
I mention’d it Yesterday to your Excellency as my Opinion, that Excluding the People of the Colonies from all Share in the Choice of the Grand Council would probably give extreme Dissatisfaction, as well as the Taxing them by Act of Parliament where they have no Representative. In Matters of General Concern to the People, and especially where Burthens are to be laid upon them, it is of Use to consider as well what they will be apt to think and say, as what they ought to think: I shall, therefore, as your Excellency requires it of me, briefly mention what of either Kind occurs at present, on this Occasion.  
First, they will say, and perhaps with Justice, that the Body of the People in the Colonies are as loyal, and as firmly attach’d to the present Constitution and reigning Family, as any Subjects in the King’s Dominions; that there is no Reason to doubt the Readiness and Willingness of their Representatives to grant, from Time to Time, such Supplies, for the Defence of the Country, as shall be judg’d necessary, so far as their Abilities will allow: That the People in the Colonies, who are to feel the immediate Mischiefs of Invasion and Conquest by an Enemy, in the Loss of their Estates, Lives and Liberties, are likely to be better Judges of the Quantity of Forces necessary to be raised and maintain’d, Forts to be built and supported, and of their own Abilities to bear the Expence, than the Parliament of England at so great a Distance. That Governors often come to the Colonies meerly to make Fortunes, with which they intend to return to Britain, are not always Men of the best Abilities and Integrity, have no Estates here, nor any natural Connections with us, that should make them heartily concern’d for our Welfare; and might possibly be sometimes fond of raising and keeping up more Forces than necessary, from the Profits accruing to themselves, and to make Provision for their Friends and Dependents. That the Councellors in most of the Colonies, being appointed by the Crown, on the Recommendation of Governors, are often of small Estates, frequently dependant on the Governors for Offices, and therefore too much under Influence. That there is therefore great Reason to be jealous of a Power in such Governors and Councils, to raise such Sums as they shall judge necessary, by Draft on the Lords of the Treasury, to be afterwards laid on the Colonies by Act of Parliament, and paid by the People here; since they might abuse it, by projecting useless Expeditions, harrassing the People, and taking them from their Labour to execute such Projects, and meerly to create Offices and Employments, gratify their Dependants and divide Profits. That the Parliament of England is at a great Distance, subject to be misinform’d by such Governors and Councils, whose united Interests might probably secure them against the Effect of any Complaints from hence. That it is suppos’d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own Consent given thro’ their Representatives. That the Colonies have no Representatives in Parliament. That to propose taxing them by Parliament, and refusing them the Liberty of chusing a Representative Council, to meet in the Colonies, and consider and judge of the Necessity of any General Tax and the Quantum, shews a Suspicion of their Loyalty to the Crown, or Regard for their Country, or of their Common Sense and Understanding, which they have not deserv’d. That compelling the Colonies to pay Money without their Consent would be rather like raising Contributions in an Enemy’s Country, than taxing of Englishmen for their own publick Benefit. That it would be treating them as a conquer’d People, and not as true British Subjects. That a Tax laid by the Representatives of the Colonies might easily be lessened as the Occasions should lessen, but being once laid by Parliament, under the Influence of the Representations made by Governors, would probably be kept up and continued, for the Benefit of Governors, to the grievous Burthen and Discouragement of the Colonies, and preventing their Growth and Increase. That a Power in Governors to march the Inhabitants from one End of the British and French Colonies to the other, being a Country of at least 1500 Miles square, without the Approbation or Consent of their Representatives first obtain’d to such Expeditions, might be grievous and ruinous to the People, and would put them on a Footing with the Subjects of France in Canada, that now groan under such Oppression from their Governor, who for two Years past has harrass’d them with long and destructive Marches to the Ohio. That if the Colonies in a Body may be well governed by Governors and Councils appointed by the Crown, without Representatives, particular Colonies may as well or better by so governed; a Tax may be laid on them all by Act of Parliament, for Support of Government, and their Assemblies be dismiss’d as a useless Part of their Constitution. That the Powers propos’d, by the Albany Plan of Union to be vested in a Grand Council representative of the People, even with Regard to Military Matters, are not so great as those the Colonies of Rhode-Island and Connecticut are intrusted with, and have never abused; for by this Plan the President-General is appointed by the Crown, and controlls all by his Negative; but in those Governments the People chuse the Governor, and yet allow him no Negative. That the British Colonies, bordering on the French, are properly Frontiers of the British Empire; and that the Frontiers of an Empire are properly defended at the joint Expence of the Body of People in such Empire. It would now be thought hard, by Act of Parliament, to oblige the Cinque Ports or Sea Coasts of Britain to maintain the whole Navy, because they are more immediately defended by it, not allowing them, at the same Time, a Vote in chusing Members of Parliament: And if the Frontiers in America must bear the Expence of their own Defence, it seems hard to allow them no Share in Voting the Money, judging of the Necessity and Sum, or advising the Measures. That besides the Taxes necessary for the Defence of the Frontiers, the Colonies pay yearly great Sums to the Mother Country unnotic’d: For Taxes, paid in Britain by the Land holder or Artificer, must enter into and increase the Price of the Produce of Land, and of Manufactures made of it; and great Part of this is paid by Consumers in the Colonies, who thereby pay a considerable Part of the British Taxes. We are restrain’d in our Trade with Foreign Nations, and where we could be supplied with any Manufactures cheaper from them, but must buy the same dearer from Britain, the Difference of Price is a clear Tax to Britain. We are oblig’d to carry great Part of our Produce directly to Britain, and where the Duties there laid upon it lessens its Price to the Planter, or it sells for less than it would in Foreign Markets, the Difference is a Tax paid to Britain. Some Manufactures we could make, but are forbid, and must take them of British Merchants; the whole Price of these is a Tax paid to Britain. By our greatly increasing the Consumption and Demand of British Manufactures, their Price is considerably rais’d of late Years; the Advance is clear Profit to Britain, and enables its People better to pay great Taxes; and much of it being paid by us is clear Tax to Britain. In short, as we are not suffer’d to regulate our Trade, and restrain the Importation and Consumption of British Superfluities, (as Britain can the Consumption of Foreign Superfluities) our whole Wealth centers finally among the Merchants and Inhabitants of Britain, and if we make them richer, and enable them better to pay their Taxes, it is nearly the same as being taxed ourselves, and equally beneficial to the Crown. These Kind of Secondary Taxes, however, we do not complain of, tho’ we have no Share in the Laying or Disposing of them; but to pay immediate heavy Taxes, in the Laying Appropriation or Disposition of which, we have no Part, and which perhaps we may know to be as unnecessary as grievous, must seem hard Measure to Englishmen, who cannot conceive, that by hazarding their Lives and Fortunes in subduing and settling new Countries, extending the Dominion and encreasing the Commerce of their Mother Nation, they have forfeited the native Rights of Britons, which they think ought rather to have been given them, as due to such Merit, if they had been before in a State of Slavery.  
These, and such Kind of Things as these, I apprehend will be thought and said by the People, if the propos’d Alteration of the Albany Plan should take Place. Then, the Administration of the Board of Governors and Council so appointed, not having any Representative Body of the People to approve and unite in its Measures, and conciliate the Minds of the People to them, will probably become suspected and odious. Animosities and dangerous Feuds will arise between the Governors and Governed, and every Thing go into confusion. Perhaps I am too apprehensive in this Matter, but having freely given my Opinion and Reasons, your Excellency can better judge whether there be any Weight in them. And the Shortness of the Time allow’d me will I hope, in some Degree, excuse the Imperfections of this Scrawl.  
With the greatest Respect and Fidelity, I am, Your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble Servant  
B Franklin

T mentioned it yefterday to your Excel-  
lency as my opinion, that excluding the  
people of the Colonies from all thare in the  
choice of the Grand Council would pro-

as the taxing them by A&amp;t of Parliament,  
where they have no reprefentation. In  
matters of general concern to the people,  
and efpecially where burdens are to be laid

what they will be apt to think and fay, as  
what they ought to think: I fhall there-

me, briefly mention what of cither kind  
occurs to me on this occation.

juftice, that the body of the people in the  
Colonies are as loyal, and as finnly at-

pence, than the Parliament of England at  
iy great a diftance.  
  
‘That Governors often come to the Colo-  
nies merely to make fortunes, with which  
they intend to return to Britain ; are not  
always men of the beft abilities or inte-  
grity; have many of them no ettates here,  
nor any natural connections with us, that  
thould make them heartily concerned for  
our welfare; and might poflibly be fond  
of raifing and keeping up more forces than  
neceflary, from the profits accruing to them-  
felves, and tomake provifion for their friends  
and dependents.  
  
That the counfellors in moft of the  
Colonies, being appointed by the Crown,  
on the recommendation of Governors, are  
often [N. B] of finall eftates, frequently  
dependent on the Governors for offices, and  
therefore too much under influence.  
  
That there is therefore great reafon to  
be jealous of a power in fuch Governors  
and councils to raife fuch fums as they  
fhall judge neceflary by drafts on the  
Lords of the Treafury, to be afterwards  
jJaid on the Colonies by aét of Parliament,  
and paid by the people here; fince they  
might abule it, by projecting uteleis expedi-  
tions, harraffing the people, and taking them  
from their labour to execute fuch projects,  
merely to create offices and employments,  
and gratify their dependents, and divide  
profits.  
  
That the Parliament of England is at a  
great difiance, fubjeét to be mifinformed  
and mifled by fuch Governors and coun-  
cils, whofe united interefts might probably  
fecure them againit the effeét of any com-  
plaint from hence.  
  
That it is fuppofed an undoubted richt  
of Englifhmen not to be taxed but by  
their own confent, given through their  
reprefentatives.  
  
That the Colonies have no reprefenta-  
tives in Parliament.  
  
That to propofe taxing them by Par-  
liament, and refufe them the liberty of  
chufing a reprefentative council, to meet  
in the Colonies, and confider and judge  
of the neceffity of any general tax, and  
the quantum, fhews a fufpicion of their  
loyalty to the Crown, or of their regard  
for their country, or of their common  
fenfe and underftanding, which they have  
not deferved.  
  
That compelling the Colonies to pay  
money without their confent would be  
rather like raifing contributions in an ene-  
my’s country, than taxing of Englifhmen  
for their own public benefit.  
  
That it would be treating them as a  
conquered people, and not as true Britifh  
fubjects.  
  
That a tax laid by the reprefentatives  
of the Colonies might be eafily leffened, as  
the occafions fhould leffen ; but, being once  
laid by Parliament under the influence of the  
reprefentations made by Governors, would  
probably be kept up, and continued for the  
benefit of Governors, to the grievous bur-  
thenand difcontentmentof the Colonies, and  
prevention of their growth and increaie.  
  
That a power in Governors to march the  
inhabitants from one end of the Britith  
and French Colonies to the other, being a  
country of at leaft 1500 miles long, with-  
out the approbation or the confent of their  
reprefentatives firft obtained to fuch expe-  
ditions, might be grievous and ruinous to  
the people, and would put them upon a  
footing with the fubjects of France in Ca-  
nada, that now groan under fuch oppreffion  
from their Governor, who, for two years  
paft, has harrailed them with long and de-  
{truétive marches to the Ohio.  
  
That if the Colonies in a body may be  
well-governed by Governors and councils  
appointed by the Grown, without repre-  
fentatives, particular Colonies may as well,  
or better, be fo governed; a tax may. be  
laid upon them all by aét of Parliament  
for fupport of government; and their af-  
femblies may be difmiffed as an ufelels  
part of the conftitution.  
  
That the powers propofed by the Albany  
plan of union, to be vefted in a Grand  
Council reprefentative of the people, even  
with regard to military matters, are not  
fo great as thofe of the Colonies of Rhode-  
Ifland and Conneéticut are intrufted with  
by their charters, and have never abuted ;  
for by this plan the Prefident General is  
appointed by the Crown, and controls ail  
by his negative; but in thofe Govern-  
ments the people chufe the Governor,  
and yet allow him no negatifee

That the Britifh Colonies bordering on  
the French are properly fronticrs of the  
Britifh empire; and the frontiers of an  
empire are properly defended at the joint  
expence of the body of the people in fuch  
empire : it would now be thought hard by  
act of Parliament to oblige the cinque  
ports or fea-coafts of Britam to maintain  
the whole navy, becaufe they are more im-  
mediately defended by it, not allowing  
them at the fame time a vote in chufing  
members of the Parliament; and, as the  
frontiers of America bear the expence of  
their own defence, it feems hard to allow  
them no fhare in voting the money, judg-  
ing of the neceffity and fum, or advifing  
the meafures.  
  
That, befides the taxes neceffary for the  
defence of the frontiers, the Colonies pay  
yearly great fums to the mother-country  
yee ot for taxes, paid in Britain by  
  
1¢ landholder or artificer, muft enter into  
er! increafe the price of the produce of land  
znd manufactures made of it; and great  
part of this is paid by contumers in the  
Colonies, who thereby pay a confiderable  
part of the Britifh taxes.  
  
We are re(trained in our trade with fo-  
reign nations ; and where we could be fup-  
plied with any manufaéture cheaper from  
them, but muft buy the fame dearer from  
Brit in, ¢ the difference of price is a clear  
tax to Britain. We are obliged to carry  
a great part of our produce direétly to Bri-  
tain, aud where the duties laid upon it  
leffen its price to the planter,* or it fells for  
lefS than it would in foreign markets, the  
difference is a tax paid to Britain.  
  
Some manufaétures we could make, but  
are forbidden, and mutt take them of Bri  
tith merchants; the whole price is a tax  
paid to Britain.  
  
By our greatly increafing the demand  
and con fumption of Britith manuf. ciures,  
their price is confiderably raifed of late  
years; the advantage is clear profit to  
Britain, and inables its people better to  
pay great taxes; and much of it, being  
paid by us, is a clear tax to Britain.  
  
In fhort, as we are not fuffcred to re-  
gulate our trade, and reftrain the importa-  
tion and confumption of Britifh iuper-  
fluitics (as Britain can the confumption  
of foreign iuperfluities) our whole wealth  
  
centers ‘finally amongit the merchants and  
inhabitants of Britain; and, if we make  
them richer, and inable them | better to pay  
their taxes, it is near! ly the fame :

no fhare in the laying or difpofing of them ;  
but to pay immediate heavy taxes, in tl ia  
laying, aeepnn, and difpo! ition 1 of  
which, we have no part, and fe hich per-  
haps we may know to be as grievous, mutt  
feem hard meafure to En; ~lithmne n, who  
cannot conceive that, by hazarding their  
lives and fortunes in fubduing and iettling  
new countries, extending and increafii 1g  
the commerce of the mother-nation, they  
have forfeited the native right of Britons ;  
which they think ought rather to be given  
to them, as duc to {uch merit, if they had  
been before in a ftate of ilaver ry.  
  
Tihefe, and fugh kind ¢ of things as thefe,  
I apprehend, vill be thought and faid by  
the people, if the propofed alteration of  
the Albany plan fhould take place. Then  
the adminittration of the board of Governors  
and council fo appointed, not having the  
reprefentative body of the people to ap-  
prove and unite in its meafures, and con-  
ciliate the minds of the people to them,  
will probably become fulpeéted and odi-  
ous; dangerous animofities and feuds wilh  
arife between the Governor and governed,  
and every day go into confufion.  
  
Perhaps I am too appreheniive in this  
matter 5 but, having freely given my opi  
nion and reafons, your Excellency can  
judge better than. I, “whether there be any  
weight i in them, and the fhortnefs of the  
time allowed me will, I hope, in fome  
degree, excule the imperfeStions of this  
{crawl.  
  
With the greateft refpe&amp;t and fidelity,  
I have the honour to be your Excellency’s

pire; and the frontiers of an empire are properly  
defended at the joint expence of the body of the  
people in ſuch empire: It would now be thought  
hard by Act of Parliament to oblige the Cinque  
ports or ſea coaſts of Britain to maintain the whole  
navy, becauſe they are more immediately de-  
fended by it, not allowing them at the ſame time a  
vote in chuſing Members of the Parliament; and  
if the frontiers in America muſt bear the expence

and great part of this is paid by conſumers in  
the Colonies, who thereby pay a conſiderable pars  
of the Britiſh taxes.  
  
We are reſtrained in our trade with foreign  
nations; and where we could be ſupplied with any  
manufacture cheaper from them, but muſt buy  
the ſame-dearer from Britain; the difference of  
price is a clear tax to Britain. We are obliged to  
carry great part of our produce directly to Britain,  
and where the duties there laid upon it leſſen its  
price to the planter, or it ſells for leſs than it would  
in foreign markets; the difference is a tax paid  
  
to Britain,

Some manufactures we could make, but are  
forbidden, and muſt take them of Britiſh mer-  
chants ; the whole price of theſe is a tax paid to  
Britain.  
  
« By our greatly increaſing the demand and  
conſumption of Britiſh manufactures, their price  
is conſiderably raiſed of late years; the advance  
is clear profit to Britain, and enables its people  
better to pay great taxes; and much of it being  
paid by us, is clear tax to Britain.  
  
In ſhort, as we are not ſuffered to regulate  
our trade, and reſtrain the importation and con-

conſumption of foreign ſuperfluities) our whole  
wealth centers finally among the merchants and in-  
habitants of Britain; and if we make them richer,  
and enable them better to pay, their taxes, it is  
nearly the ſame as being taxed ourlelves, and  
equally beneficial to the Crown. |  
  
« Theſe kind of ſecondary taxes, however, we  
do not complain of, though we have no ſhare in  
the laying or diſpoling of them; but to pay imme-  
diate heavy taxes, in the laying, appropriation,

SIR, | Wedneſday Morning.  
be ] mentioned it yeſterday to your Excellency  
as my opinion, that excluding the People of che  
Colonies from all ſhare in the choice of the Grand  
Council, would probably give extreme diſſatiſ-  
faction, as well as the taxing them by Act of Par-  
liament, where they have no Repreſentative. In  
matters of general concern to the People, and eſpe-  
cially where burthens are to be laid upon them, it  
is of uſe to conſider, as well what they will be apt  
  
  
ſhall therefore, as your Excellency requires it of  
me, briefly mention what of either kind occurs to  
me on this occaſion, |  
  
ce Firſt they will ſay, and perhaps with juſtice,  
that the body of the People in the Colonies are as  
loyal, and as firmly attached to the preſent Con-  
ſtitution, and reigning family, as any ſubjects in  
the King&#x27;s dominions,  
  
« That there is no reaſon to doubt the readineſs  
and willingneſs of the Repreſentatives they may  
chuſe, to grant from time to time ſuch ſupplies for  
the defence &#x27;of the Country, as ſhall be judged  
neceſſary, ſo far as their abilities will allow,  
  
« That the People in the Colonies, who are  
| to feel the immediate miſchiefs of invaſion and  
conqueſt  
  
  
11  
conqueſt by an enemy, in the loſs of their eſtares,  
lives and liberties, - are likely to be better judges  
of the quantity of forces neceſſary to be raiſed and  
maintained, forts to be built and fupported, and  
4 a own abilities to bear the expence, than the  
iament of England at ſo great a diſtance.  
  
« That Governors often come to the Colonies  
merely to make fortunes, with which they intend  
to return to Britain, are not always men of the  
beſt abilities or integrity, have many of them  
no eſtates here, nor any natural connection with  
us, that ſhould make them heartily concerned  
for our welfare; and might poſſibly be fond of  
railing and keeping up more forces than neceſſary,  
from the profits accruing to themſelves, and to  
make proviſions for their friends and dependants.  
  
That the Counſellors in moſt of the colonies  
being appointed by the Crown, on the recom-  
mendation of Governors, are often of ſmall eſtates,  
frequently dependant on the Governors for Offices,  
and therefore too much under influence.  
  
That there is therefore great reaſon to be jea-  
lous of a power in ſuch Governors and Councils,  
to raiſe ſuch ſums as they ſhall judge neceſſary, by  
draft on the Lords of the Treaſury, to be af-  
terwards laid on the Colonies by A&amp; of Parlia-  
ment, and paid by the People here: ſince they  
might abuſe it, by projecting uſeleſs expeditions,  
haraſſing the People, and taking them from their  
labour to execute ſuch projets, merely to create  
offices and employments, and gratify their de-  
pendants, and divide profits,  
  
o and  
  
*  
K *  
  
  
N  
« That the Parliament of England is at a great  
diſtance, ſubject to be miſinformed and miſted by  
  
  
tereſts might probably ſecure them againſt the  
effect of any complaint from hence.  
  
« That it is ſuppoſed an undoubted right of  
Engliſhmen not to be taxed but by their own con-

tax, and the quantum, ſhows a ſuſpicion of their  
loyalty to the Crown, or of their regard for  
their Country, or of their common ſenſe and un-  
derſtanding, which they have not deſerved.
