Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.  
At the opening of the present Session of Congress I mentioned that some circumstances of an unwelcome nature had lately occurred in relation to France; that our trade had suffered and was suffering extensive injuries in the West Indies from the Cruisers and Agents of the French Republic; and that communications had been received from its minister here which indicated danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its authority, and that were in other respects far from agreeable: but that I reserved for a special message, a more particular communication on this interesting subject. This communication I now make.  
The complaints of the French minister embraced most of the transactions of our Government in relation to France from an early period of the present war; which therefore it was necessary carefully to review. A collection has been formed of letters and papers relating to those transactions, which I now lay before you, with a letter to mr Pinckney, our minister at Paris, containing an examination of the Notes of the French minister, and such information as I thought might be useful to mr Pinckney in any further representations he might find necessary to be made to the French Government. The immediate object of his mission was to make to that Government such explanations of the principles and conduct of our own, as by manifesting our good faith might remove all jealousy and discontent, and maintain that harmony and good understanding with the French Republic which it has been my constant solicitude to preserve. A Government which required only a knowledge of the truth to justify its measures, could not but be anxious to have this fully and frankly displayed.

^ Oemlemeti of the Senate, and of  
the tloufe of {Reprefentatives,  
  
•• AT the openiag of the prefent  
* Seflion of CoBgrefs, 1 mentioned that  
  
fome circumfiances of an unwelcome  
nature had lately occurred in relation  
to France ( that our trade had fuiTered  
and wu fufTering extenfive injuries in  
the Wefi-Indiff, from the cruizenand  
agents of the French Republic; and  
that communications had been received  
from its MiniQer here, which indicated  
danger of a further difiurbance of onr  
commerce by its authority; and that  
we were, in other refpe^s, far from  
agreeable ; but thVit&#x27; 1 relcrvcd for a  
fpecial melTage a more particular com-  
municathm on this interefiing fubje^t.  
This communication 1 now make.  
  
“ The complaints of the French  
Miniftcr embraced mod of the irauf-  
a^lions of our Government, in relation  
to France, from an early period of the  
prefent war; which, therefore, it was  
necelTary carefully to review. A col-  
ledtion has been formed&#x27;of letters and  
papers relating to thofc tranfadVions,  
which 1 now lay before you, with a  
letter to Mr. Pinckney, our Minifter  
at Paris containing an examination of  
the notes of the French Minifier, and  
fuch information as I thought might be  
ufeful to Mr. Pinckney in any further  
reprefentations he might find iucclTdry  
to be made to the French Government.  
The immediate objc^l of his miffi. n  
was, to make to that Governmeat fuch  
explanations of the principles and con¬  
duct of our own, as, hy inanirelling  
our good faith, might remove all jea-  
loiify and difeontenr, and maintain th^t  
harmony and gi&gt;od underfianding with  
the French Republic, which it ha*  
been my confiant folicitude to preferve.  
A Government which required on!v  
a knowledge of the /r«/^ to jufiify its  
nieafurcs, could not but be anxious tu  
have this fully and frankly difplayed.  
  
“ Geo. Washinctpv
