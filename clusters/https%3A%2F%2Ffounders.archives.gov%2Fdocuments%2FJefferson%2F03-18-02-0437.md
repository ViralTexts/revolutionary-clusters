Monticello June 26. 22.  
  
I have recieved and read with thankfulness &amp; pleasure your denunciation of the abuses of tobacco &amp; wine. yet however sound in it’s principles, I expect it will be but a sermon to the wind. you will find it as difficult to inculcate these sanative precepts on the sensualists of the present day, as to convince an Athanasian that there is but one God. I wish success to both attempts, and am happy to learn from you that the latter, at least, is making progress, and the more rapidly in proportion as our Platonising Christians make more stir and noise about it.  
The doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all to the happiness of man.  
1. that there is one God, and he all-perfect:  
2. that there is a future state of rewards and punishments:  
3. that to love God with all thy heart, &amp; thy neighbor as thyself, is the sum of religion. these are the great points in on which he endeavored to reform the religion of the Jews. but compare with these the demoralising dogmas of Calvin.  
1. that there are three Gods:  
2. that good works, or the love of our neighbor are nothing:  
3. that Faith is every thing; and the more incomprehensible the proposition, the more merit in it’s faith:  
4. that Reason in religion is of unlawful use:  
5. that God, from the beginning, elected certain individuals to be saved, &amp; certain others to be damned; and that no crimes of the former can damn them, no virtues of the latter save.  
Now which of these is the true and charitable Christian? he who believes and acts on the simple doctrines of Jesus? or the impious dogmatists of Athanasius and Calvin? verily, I say that these are the false shepherds, foretold as to enter, not by the door into the sheep-fold, but climbing to climb up some other way. they are mere Usurpers of the Christian name, teaching a Counter-religion, made up of the deliria of crazy imaginations, as foreign from Christianity as is that of Mahomet. their blasphemies have driven thinking men into infidelity, who have too hastily rejected the supposed Author himself, with the horrors so falsely imputed to him. had the doctrines of Jesus been preached always as purely as they came from his lips, the whole civilised world would now have been Christian. I rejoice that in this blessed country of free enquiry and belief, which has surrendered it’s creed and conscience to neither kings nor priests, the genuine doctrine of one only God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the US. who will not die an Unitarian.  
But much I fear that when this great truth shall be re-established, it’s Votaries will fall into the fatal error of fabricating formulas of creed, and Confessions of faith, the engines which so soon destroyed the religion of Jesus, and made of Christendom a mere Ak Aceldama: that they will give up morals for mysteries, &amp; Jesus for Plato. how much wiser are the Quakers, who, agreeing in the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, schismatize about no mysteries, and keeping within the pale of Common sense, suffer no speculative differences of opinion, any more than of feature, to impair the love of their brethren. be this the wisdom of Unitarians; this the holy mantle which shall cover within it’s charitable circumference all who believe in one God, and who love their neighbor.—I conclude my sermon with sincere assurances of my friendly esteem and respect.

Timrcus, Spirio«a, Diderot, and d&#x27;llolbach.—The doctrines of Jesus are  
simple, and lend all to the happiness of man :—1. That there is one only

punishm*&#x27;nl*.—3. That to love God with all thy heartland thy neighl&gt;our  
a* thyst^lf, is the sum of religion.—These are the great points on which  
he endeavoured to reform the religion of the Jews. But compare with  
the»e the demoralizing dogmas of Calvin:—1. That there are three  
Gods.—&gt;2. That good works, or the love of our neighbours, are nothing.  
.3. That faith is everything; and the more incomprehensible the propo*  
sition, the more merit in its faith.—4. That reason in religion is of unlaw-

former can damn them, no virtues of the latter save.—Now w hich of these

Monticei.lo, June 26, 1822.  
Dear Sir: I have received und read with  
thankfulncss&#x27;and pleasure your denunciations  
of the abuses of tobacco and wine. Yet, how­  
ever sound in its principles, I expect it will  
be but a sermon to the wind. You will find it  
as difficult to inculcate these sensative precepts  
on the sensibilities of the present day, as to  
convince an Athanasian that there is but one  
God. I wish success to both attempts, and  
am happy to learn from you, that the latter,  
at least, is making progress, and the more ra­  
pidly in proportion as our Piatunizing Chris  
tains make more stir and noise about it. The  
doctrines of Jesus arc simple, and tend to the  
happiness of man.  
1. That there is one only God, and he all  
perfect.  
2. That there is a future state cf rewards  
and punishments.  
3. That to love God with all thy heart,and  
thy neighbor as thyself, is the sum of religion.  
These art the great points on which he en­  
deavored to reform the religion of the Jews.  
But compare with these the demoralizing dog­  
mas of Calvin.  
1. That there are three Gods.  
2. That good works, or the love of our  
neighbor, are nothing.  
3. That faith is every thing, and the more  
incomprehensible the proposition, the more  
merit in its faith.  
4. That reason in religion isof unlawful use.  
5. That God, from the beginning, elected  
certain individuals to be. saved, and certain  
others to be damned; and that no crime of the  
former can damn them; no virtues of the hit­  
ter, save them.  
Now, which of these is the true and chari­  
table Christian ? He who believes and acts  
on the simple doctrines of Jesus; or the impi­  
ous dogmatists, as Athanasus and Calvin?—  
Verily i say these are the false shepherds  
foretold, as to enter not by the door into lie  
sheepfold, but to climb up some other way.  
They are mere usurpers of the Christian name  
teaching a counter religion made up of the  
dcliria of crazy imaginations, as foreign from  
Christianity as is that of M dnimet. Their  
blasphemies have driven thinking inen into in  
fidelity, who have too hastily rejected the  
supposed author himself, with the horrors so  
falsely imputed to him. Had tile doctrines  
of Jesus been preached always as pure as they  
canie from his lips, the whole civilized world  
would have been Christians. 1 rejoice that  
m this blessed country of free inquiry and be­  
lief, which has surrendered its creed and con­  
science to neither kings nor priests,, the genu­  
ine doctrines of the only God is reviving, and  
1 tiust that there is not a young man now liv­  
ing in the United States, who will nut die an  
Unitarian.  
  
jjul mucii i rear, mac wnentms great truth  
shall be re-established, its votaries will fall  
into the fatal error of fabricating tonnulas of  
creeds and confessions of faith, the engines  
which s«&#x27; soon destroyed the religion of Jesus,  
and made of Christendom a mere Aceldama:  
that they will give up morals for mysteries,  
and Jesus for Plato. How much wiser are the  
Quakers who, agreeing in the fundanu:.tal  
doctrines of the Gospel, do not schematize  
about mysteries, and keeping within the pale  
of common sense, suffer no speculative differ­  
ences of opinion, any more than the feature,  
to impair the love of their brethren. Be this  
the wisdom of Unitarians, this the holy man­  
tle which shall cover within its charitable cir­  
cumference all who believe in one God, and  
love their neighbor! I conclude my sermon  
with sincere assurances of my friendly esteem  
and respect. TH: JEFFERSON

The wise Franklin was once an infidel, and as he himself  
tells us, in his writings, he was made such by the doctrines of  
eternal decrees, election and reprobation; such doctrines he  
could not believe, and those he was taught to believe were  
Christianity. A distinguished man of Virginia, who has been

## [From _The Open Court, a Quarterly Magazine [Devoted to the Science of Religion, the Religion of Science, and the Extension of the Religious Parliament Idea (1887-1905)_](https://archive.org/details/sim_open-court_1896-06-11_10_459/page/n1/mode/1up?view=theater)

#### 1896-06-11 &middot; [Chicago](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Perhaps the most important letter of all as bearing  
on theological matters is one to Dr. Benjamin Water-  
house. In it he sums up the doctrines of Jesus as:  
‘¢(1) There is only one God, and he all-perfect. (2)  
There is a future state of reward and punishment.  
(3) To love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor  
as thyself, is the sum of religion. These are the great  
points on which he endeavored to reform the religion  
of the Jews. But compare with those the demoralis-  
ing dogmas of Calvin. (1) That there are three Gods.  
(2) That good works or love of our neighbor are noth-  
ing. (3) That faith is everything ; and the more in-  
comprehensible the proposition the more merit in the  
faith. (4) That reason in religion is of unlawful use.  
(5) That God from the beginning elected certain in-  
dividuals to be saved, and certain others to be damned;  
and that no crimes of the former can damn them ; no  
virtues of the latter save. Now, which of these is the  
true Christian? He who believes and acts on the  
simple doctrines of Jesus? Or the impious dogma-  
tists, as Athanasius and Calvin? Verily I say these  
last are the false shepherds, foretold as to enter not  
by the door into the sheepfold. They are usurpers of  
the Christian name, teaching a counter religion. Their  
blasphemies have driven thinking men into infidelity,  
who have too hastily rejected the supposed author  
himself. Had the doctrines of Jesus always been  
preached as pure as they came from his lips the whole  
civilised world would now have been Christian. I re-  
joice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and  
belief, which has surrendered its creed and conscience  
to neither kings nor priests. The general doctrine of  
one only God is reviving ; and I trust that there is not  
a young man now living in the United States who will  
not die a Unitarian.  
  
‘¢ But much I fear that when this great truth shall  
be re-established, its votaries will fall into the fatal  
error of fabricating formulas of creed and confessions  
of faith, the engines which destroyed the religion of  
Jesus, and made of Christendom a mere Aceldama.  
How much wiser are the Quakers, who, keeping  
within the pale of common sense, suffer no specula-  
tion to impair the love of brethren. Be this the wis-  
dom of Unitarians ; this the holy mantle which shall  
cover within its charitable circumference all who be-  
lieve in one God and who love their neighbor.” Hi
