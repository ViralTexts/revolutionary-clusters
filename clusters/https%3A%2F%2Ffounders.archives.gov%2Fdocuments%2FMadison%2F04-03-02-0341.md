A Proclamation too of that government of   (not officially indeed communicated to us, yet so given out to the public as to become a rule of action with them) seems to have shut the door on all negociation with us, except as to the single aggression on the Chesapeak.” You however suggested a

It was in these words. “The Communications now made, shewing the great and increasing dangers with which our vessels, our seamen and merchandise are threatened, on the high seas and elsewhere, from the belligerent powers of Europe, and it being of the greatest importance to keep in safety those essential resources, I deem it my duty to recommend the subject to the consideration of Congress, who will doubtless percieve all the advantage which may be expected from an inhibition of the departure of our vessels from the ports of the United States.”
