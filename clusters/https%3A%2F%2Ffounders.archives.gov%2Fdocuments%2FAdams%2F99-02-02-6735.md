Quincy March 29th. 1817.  
  
Is your daughter, Mrs Stewart, who I am credibly informed is one of the most accomplished Ladies, a Painter? Are you acquainted with Miss Lydia Smith, who I am also credibly informed is one of he most accomplished Ladies and a Painter? Do you know Mr. Sargent? Do you correspond with your old companion in Arms Colo. John Trumbull? Do you think Fisher will be an historical Painter?  
Whenever you shall find a Painter male or female, I pray you to suggest a scene and subject  
The  Scene is the Council Chamber of the Old Townhouse in Boston. The date is the month of February 1761, nine years before you came to me in Cole lane. As this was five years before you entered Colledge you must have been in the second form of Master Lovells school.  
That Council Chamber was as respectable an Appartment and more so too in proposition, than the House of Lords or House of Commons in Great Britain, or that in Philadelphia in which the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.  
In this Chamber near the fire were seated five Judges with Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson at their head as Cheif Justice, all in their new fresh Robes of Searles English cloth in their broad bands and immense Judicial Wiggs. In this Chamber was seated at a long Table all the Baristers of Boston and its neighbouring County of Middlesex in their Gowns bands &amp; Tye wiggs. They were not seated on Ivory chairs, but their dress was more solemn &amp; more pompous than that of the Roman Senate, when the Gauls broke in upon them. In a corner of the Room must be placed Wit, sense, Imagination, Genius, Pathos, Reason, Prudence, Eloquence, Learning, science and immense Reading, hung by the shoulders on two crutches covered with a cloth great coat, in the person of Mr. Pratt who had been solicited on both sides but would engage on neither, being about to leave Boston forever as Chief Justice of New York.  
Two Portraits at more than full length of King Charles the second, and King James the second, in splendid golden frames were hung up in the most conspicuous side of the apartment. If my young eyes or old memory have not deceived me, these were the finest Pictures I have seen. The colours of their long flowing Robes and their Royal Ermines were the most glowing, the figures the most noble &amp; graceful, the features the most distinct &amp; characteristic far superior to those of the King &amp; Queen of France in the Senate Chamber of Congress. I believe they were Vandykes. Sure I am there was no Painter in England capable of them at that time, they had been sent over without frames in Governor Pownals time, but as he was no admirer of Charles’ or James’ they were stowed away in a Garrett among rubbish, till Governor Bernard came, had them cleaned, superbly framed, and placed in Council for the admiration and imitation of all men, no doubt with the concurrence of Hutchinson and all the Junto; for there has always been a Junto. One circumstance more. Samuel Quincy and John Adams had been admitted Barristers at that Term. John was the youngest he should be painted looking like a short thick fat Archbishop of Canterbury seated at the table, with a pen in his hand, lost in admiration, now &amp; then minuting those despicable notes which you know that Jonathan Williams Austin, your fellow student in my Office, stole from my desk and printed in the Massachusetts Spy, with two or three bombastic expressions interpolated by himself; and which your Pupil, Judge Minot has printed in his history.  
You now have the stage and the scenery. Next follows a narration of the subject. I rather think that we Lawyers ought to call it a Brief of the cause.  
When the British Ministry, received from General received from General Amherst, his dispatches announcing his conquest of Montreal and he consequent annihilation of the French Government and Power in America in 1759. they immediately conceived this design and took the Resolution of conquering the English Colonies, and subjecting them to the unlimited Authority of Parliament. With this view and intention, they send orders and Instructions to the Collector of the Customs in Boston. Mr. Charles Paxton, to apply to the civil Authority for writs of assistants, to enable the Custom house Officers, Tide waiters, Land waiters &amp; all, to command all Sheriffs &amp; Constables, to attend and aid them, in breaking open houses, stores, Shops, Cellars, Ships Bales, trunks, chests, casks, packages of all sorts, to search for goods wares and Merchandizes, which had been imposted against the prohibitions, or without paying the taxes imposed by certain Acts of Parliament called “The Acts of Trade” i.e. by certain Parliamentary Statutes, which had been procured to be passed from time to time for a Century before by a combination of selfish intrigues between West India Planters and North American Royal Governors. These Acts never had been executed, and there never had been a time when they would have been or could have been obeyed.  
Mr Paxton, no doubt consulting with Governor Bernard Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson, and all the principal Crown Officers and all the rest of the Junto, thought it not prudent to commence his operations in Boston. For obvious reasons he instructed his deputy Collector in Salem, Mr. Cockle, to apply by petition to the Superior Court in November 1760, then selling in that Town for Writs of Assistants. Stephen Sewall was then Chief Justice of that Court, an able Man, an uncorrupted American and a sound Whig, a sincere friend of Liberty, civil and religious. He expressed great doubts of the legality of such a writ and of the Authority of the Court to grant it. Not one of his brother Judges uttered a word in favour of it, but as it was an application on the part of the Crown, it must be heard and determined—After consultation, the Court Ordered the Question to be argued at the next February Term in Boston, i.e. in 1761.  
In the mean time Chief Justice Sewall died, and Lieut. Governor Hutchinson was appointed Chief Justice of that Court in his stead. Every observing and thinking man knew that this appointment was made for the direct purpose of deciding the question, in favour of the Crown, and all others in which it should be interested.  
An alarm was spread far and wide. Merchants of Salem &amp; Boston, applied to Mr. Pratt who refused, and to Mr. Otis &amp; Mr. Thacher who accepted, to defend them, against the sensible menacing Monster, the Writ of Assistants. Great fees were offered, but Otis &amp; I believe Thacher, would accept of none. “In such a Cause,” said Otis, “I despise all fees.”  
I have given you a sketch of the Stage &amp; the scenery; and a Brief of the cause, or if you like the phrase better, of the Tragedy, Comedy or Farce.  
Now for the Actors &amp; Performers. Mr. Gridley argued with his Characteristic, Learning, Ingenuity &amp; Dignity, and said every thing that could he said in favour of Cockle’s Petition, all depending, however on the “If the Parliament of Great Britain is the sovereign Legislator of all the British Empire.”  
Mr. Thacher followed him on the other side, and argued with the softness of manners, the Ingenuity, the cool reasoning which were peculiar to his amiable character.  
But Otis was a flame of fire! With a promptitude of Classical Allusions, a depth of research, a rapid summary of historical events &amp; dates, a profusion of Legal Authorities, a prophetic glance of his eyes into futurity, and a rapid torrent of impetuous Eloquence he hurried away all before him. American Independence was then &amp; there born. The seeds of Patriots &amp; Heroes to defend the Non sine Diis Animosus Infans; to defend the Vigorous Youth were then &amp; there sown. Every Man of an immense crouded Audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take Arms against Writs of Assistants. Then and there was the first scene of the first Act of opposition to the Arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the Child Independence was born. In fifteen years i.e. in 1776. he grew up to Manhood, &amp; declared himself free.  
The Court adjourned for Consideration, and after some days at the close of the Term, Hutchinson Cheif Justice arose &amp; said, “The Court has considered the subject of Writs of Assistants, and can see no foundation for such a Writ, but as the practice in England is not known, it has been thought best, to continue the Question to next Term, that in the mean time Opportunity may be given to write to England for Information concerning the subject.” In six months the next Term arrived, but no Judgment was pronounced, nothing was said about Writs of Assitants, no letters from England, and nothing more ever said in Court concerning them. But it was generally reported &amp; understood that the Court clandestinely granted them, and the Custom house Officers had them in their pockets, though I never knew that they dared to produce and execute them in any one instance.  
Mr. Otis’s popularity was without bounds. In May 1761. he was elected into the House of Representatives, by an almost Unanimous vote. On that week I happened to be at Worcester attending a Court of Common Pleas of which Brigadier Ruggles was Chief Justice. When the news arrived from Boston, you can have no idea of the consternation among the Government people. Chief Justice Ruggles at dinner at Col. Chandlers on that day, said, “Out of this Election will arise a damn’d Faction, which will shake the Province to its foundation.”  
For ten years afterwards Mr. Otis at the head of his Countrys cause, conducted the Town of Boston &amp; the people of the Province with a prudence &amp; fortitude, at every sacrifice of personal interest, &amp; amidst unceasing persecution; which would have done honour to the most virtuous Patriot or Mastyr of Antiquity.  
I fear I shall make your refusal of bringing out, the / Old Gentleman.  
  
  
John Adams

nine vears before you came to me in

That Council Chamber was as respec­

perior to those of the King and Queen of  
France in the Senate Chamber ol Con­

Sur- I am there was no painter in Eng­  
land capable ot them at that time. Thev

One circumstance more. Samuel Quincy  
anJ John Adams had been admired Bai­  
risters at that term. John was the young­  
est. He should be painted, looking like  
a short thick fat Archbishop of Canterbu­

When the Bri-.wi ministry received

to tb« collector of the customs in Boston,  
Mr. Charles Paxton, to apply to the ci­  
vil authority for writs of assistance, to e­  
nablc the cu8t&lt;&gt;m-hou*e officers, tide wait­  
ers, land waiters, aod all, to command  
all sheriffs and constable* to attend and  
aid them in breaking open hnuses, stores,  
shops, cellars, ship*, bales, trunks,cask*,  
packages of all *ortR, to search for goods,  
wares and merchandizes, which had bee &gt;  
imported a* against the prohibitions, or  
without paying the taxe* imposed bv rer­  
J tain Act* of Parliament, called •&#x27;the  
acts or trade,” ii e. by certain Parli­  
amentary Statutes, which had h-en prn­  
| cu ed to be passed from time to time, for  
j a century before, by a combination ofael­  
fiih intrigues between We«t-Indp Plan­  
1 ters and North American Royal Gover­  
nors. These acts never had been exe­  
| cuted, and there never had been a time  
| when they would have been, or could  
have been obeyed  
Mr Paxton, no doubt consulting with  
Governor Bernard, Lieut Gov Hutchin­  
son,- and all the principal cmwn oflr-er*,  
and all &#x27;he rest of the junto, thought it  
not prudent to commence his operations  
in B *sron. For obvious reasons, he in­  
stracted h-s deputy collector in Salem,  
Mr. Cockle, to apply by petition to the  
superior court, in Nov. 17^0, then sit­  
ting in that town, for writs of assistance.  
Stephen Sewell was then chief justice of  
that court, an able man, an uncorrupted  
American, a sound whig, a sincere friend  
ot liberty, civil and religious. He ex­  
pressed great doubts of the legality of  
such a writ, and of the authority of the  
court to grant it.—Not one of his brother  
judges uttered a word in favor of it; but  
as it was an apnlication on the part of the  
crown it mud be heard and determined  
After consultation, the court ordered the  
  
question to be argued A the next Febru*  
art te m, in Boston, i. e. in 176f.  
In the mean time chief ju«»icr Newell  
died, and Lieut. Gov. Hntchinson was  
appointed chief justice of that court in  
lus stead. Every observing and thinking  
man knew that this ippointmen&lt; was  
made for the direct purpose of deciding  
this question, in favor of the crown, and  
all others in which it should be interest­  
ed  
An alarm was spread far and wide.—  
Merchants of Salem and Boston applied  
to Mr. Pratt, who refused, and to Mr.  
Otis and Mr. Thatcher, who acc-pted.to  
defend them against this terrible meua  
cing monster, the writ of .assistance.—  
fireat fee« were offered, but Otis, and I  
believe Thatch&#x27; r, would accept ot none.  
“ In such a cause,” said Otis, “ I des­  
pise all fees.”  
I have given you a sketch of the stage  
and the scenery, and a briet of the cao*e  
—or, if you like the phra-e better, ol the  
Tragedy, Comedy or Farce  
Now for the actors and perfi»rmers.*­  
Mr. Gridley argued with hi* characteris­

said every thing that could be sa&#x27;d in fa­

howevar, on the ** If the parliament ot

Mr. Thatcher followed him on the o­  
ther side, and argued with the softness of  
manners, the ingenuitv, the cool reason­  
ing which were peculiar to hi* amiable  
character.  
But Otis was a flame of fire! With a  
promptitude of classical allusions; a  
depth ot research, a rapid summary of  
historical events and datts, a profusion  
of legal au&#x27;horities, a prophetic glsre of  
his eves into futurity, and a ranid torrent  
of impetuous eloquence he hurried away

was then and there born &#x27;tTi« «eed« of  
Patriots and Heroes to defend the Non

the vigorous youth were then and there  
sown. Every man of an immense crowd­  
ed andience apneared to n e to go away

The court adjourned for consideration,  
and after some davs at the close of the  
term, Hutchinson, chief justice, arose  
and said, The court has considered the  
subject of Writs of A**istance, and can

Quincy, March 29, 1817.  
  
Dear Sir—Is your daughter, Mrs. Stuart, who |  
am credibly informed is one of the most accom-  
plished ladies, a painter? Are you acquainted  
with Miss Lydia Smith, who, I am also credib]  
informed, is one of the most accomplished ladies,  
and a painter? Do you know Mr. Sergeant? Do  
you correspond with your old companion in arms,  
Col. John Trumbull? Do you think Fisher will  
be an historical painter?  
  
Whenever you shall find a painter, male or fe-  
male, I pray you to suggest a scene, and a sub-  
ject, for the pencil.  
  
The scene, is the council chamber in the old  
Town House in Boston. ‘The date is in the month  
of February 1761, nine years before you entered  
my Office in Cold Lane. As this was five years  
before you entered college, you must have been  
in the second form of master Lovell’s school.  
  
That council chamber was as respectable an  
apartment as the house of commons or the house  
of lores in Great Britain, in proportion, or that in  
the state house in Philadelphia in which the de-  
claration of independence was signed, in 1776. In  
this chamber, round a great fire, were seated five  
judges, with lieutenant governor Hutchinson at  
their head, as chiefjustice, all arrayed in their new,  
fresh, rich robes of scarlet English broad cloth;  
in their large cambric bands, and immense judici-  
al wigs. Inthis chamber were seated at a long  
table all the barristers at law of Boston, and of the  
  
J 2 Ci PLETED  
  
In acorner of the room must be placed us a  
spectator and an auditor, wit, sense, imapination,  
genius, pathos, reason, prudence, eloquence, learii-  
ing’and immense reading, hanging by the s)oulders  
on two crutches, covered with a cloth great coat  
in the person of Mr. Praft, who had been solicited  
on both sides but would engage on neither, being,  
as chief justice of New York, about to leave Bos.  
ton forever: two portraits at more than full length  
of king Charles the second and of king James the  
second, in splendid golden frames were hung up  
on the most conspicuous sides of the apartment.  
If my young eyes or oid memory have not de-  
ceived me, these were as fine pictures as I ever  
saw; the colours of their royal ermines and long  
Howing robes were the most glowing, the figures  
the most noble and graceful, the features the most  
  
he king and queen of France in the senate cham-  
ber of congress—these were worthy of the pencils  
of Rubens and Vandyke. ‘There was no painter in  
England capable of them at that time. They had  
been sent over without frames in gov. Pownall’s  
time, but he was no admirer of Charies or James;  
the pictures were stowed away in a garret among  
rubbish till governor Bernard came, who had them  
cleaned, superbly framed, and placed in council,  
forthe admiration and imitation of all men—no  
doubt with the advise and concurrence of Hut-  
chinson and all his nebula of stars and satteliites.  
One circumstance more: Samue} Quincy and John  
Adams had been admitted barristers at that term.  
John was the youngest; lhe should be painted look-  
ing like a short thick arch-bishop of Canterbury  
seated at the table with a pen in his hand, lost in  
admiration, now and then minuting ibose poor notes  
which your pupil, judge Minot, has printed im his  
history, volume 2d, page 89, 90, 91,92, 93, 94, 95

You have now the stage and the scenery, next fol-  
lows the narration and the subject. I rather think  
that we lawyers ought to call it a briefof the cause.  
  
When the British ministry received fromm Gene-  
ral Amherst bisdespatches announcing the conquest  
of Montreal and the consequent annihilation of the  
French government in America, in 1759, they im-  
mediately conceived the design, and took the reso-  
lution, of conquering the Erglish colonies, and sub-  
jecting them to the unlimited authority of parlia-  
ment; with this view and intention they sent orders  
and instructions to the collector of customs in Bos-  
ton, Mr. Charles Paxton, to apply to the civil au-  
thority for writs of assistants, to enable the custom-  
house officers, tide waiters, land waiters and all,  
to command ail sheriffs and constables, &amp;c. to at-  
tend aod aid them in breaking open houses, stores,  
shops, cellars, ships, bales, trunks, chests, casks,  
packages of all sorts, to search for goods, wares  
and merchandizes which had been imported against  
the prohibitions or without paying the taxes im-  
posed by certain acts of parliament called the acts  
of trade; that is, by certain parliamentary statutes  
which had been procured tobe passed from time  
to time for a century before, by a combination of  
selfish intrigues between West Indiaplanters and  
north Ainerican royal governors. These acts never  
had been executed as revenue laws, and there  
never had been a time when they would have been  
or could have been obeyed as such.  
  
Mr. Paxton, no doubt consulting with governor  
Barnard, lieutenant governor Hutchinson and all  
the principal crown officers, thought it not pru-  
dent to commence his operations in Boston, for  
obvious reasons; he instructed bis deputy collector  
in Salem, Mr. Cockle, to apply by petition to the  
superior court, in November 1769, then sitting in  
that town, for writs of assistants. Stephen Sewal  
was then chief justice of that court, an able man,  
an uncerrupted American, and a sincere friend of  
liberty, civil and religious.  
  
He expressed great doubts of the legality of such  
a writ and of the authority of the court to grant it.  
Not oxe of his brother judges uttered a word in  
favor of it; but as it was an application on the part  
of the crown, it must be heard und determined.—  
After consultation, the court ordered the question  
  
to be argued at the next February term in Boston  
(viz) 1761. In the mean time chief justice Sewal  
died, ard }ieut. gov. Hutchinson was appointed  
chief justice of that court in his stead—every ob-  
serving and thinking man knew that this appoint.  
ment was made for the direct purpose of deciding  
this question in favor of the crown, and all others  
in which it should be interested,  
  
As alarm was spread far and wide. Merchants  
of Salem and Boston applied to Mr. Pratt, who re-  
fused, and to Mr. Otis and Mr. Thatcher, who ac-  
cepted, to defend them against the terrible menac-  
ing monster, the writ of assistants. Great fees were  
oftered, but Otis, and I believe Thatcher, would ac-  
cept of none, “In such a cause,” said Otis, “1 de-  
spise all fees.”  
  
I have given you a sketch of the stage, and the  
scenery, and the brief of the cause, or if you like  
the pirase better, the tragedy, comedy, or farce.  
  
Now for the actors and pertormers. Mr. Grid-  
ley argued with his characteristic learning, inget.u-  
ity and dignity, and said every thing that could  
be said in favor of Cock!e’s petition; all depending  
however on the “if the parliament of Great Britain  
is the sovereign leyislature of all the British em.  
pire.” Mr. Phatcher fotlowed him on the other

ae  
  
side, and argued with the softness of manners, the  
integrity and cool reasoning which were remarka-  
ble in his amiable character,  
  
But Otis was a flame of fire!-—with a promptitude  
of classical allusions, a depth of research, a rapid  
summary of historical events and dates, a profusion  
of legal authorities, a prophetic glance of his eye in-  
to futurity, and a torrent ofimpetuous eloquence, he  
hurried away every thing before him.  
  
American independence was then and there born;  
the seeds of patriots and heroes were then and  
there sown, to defend the vigorous youth, the non  
sine Diis animosus infans.  
  
Every man of a crowded audience appeared to  
me to go away as I did, ready to take arms against  
Writs of assistants. Then and there was the first  
scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary  
claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child  
Independence was born; in fifteen years (viz) 1»  
1776, hie grew up to manhood and declared himseif  
free.  
  
‘The court adjourned for consideration, and after  
some days, at the close of the term, Hutchinson,  
chief justice, arose and said, “The court has const-  
dered the subject of writs of assistants and cao  
see no foundation for such a writ; but as the prac-  
tice in Ex.gland is not known, it has been thought  
best to con.inue the question until next term, that  
in the mean time opportunity may be given to write  
to England for information concerning the subject.  
In six months thenext term arrived, but no judg-  
ment was pronounced, no letters from England  
were produced, and nothing more was ever said in  
court concerning writs of assistants; but it was ge-  
neraily reported and understood that the courts  
clandestinely granted them, and the custom-house  
vfficers had them in their pockets, though I never  
knew that they dared to produce them or execute  
them in any one instance.  
  
Mi. Os’ popularity was without bounds. In May,  
1761, he was elected into the house of representa-  
tives by an almost unanimous vote. On the week of  
his election, | happened to be at Worcester, attend-  
ing the court of common pleas, of which brigadier  
Ruggies was chief justice, when the news arrived  
from Boston of Mr. Otis’ election. You can have no  
idea of the consternation among the government-  
people. Chier justice Ruggles, at dinner at col.  
Chandler’s on that day, said, “Out of this election  
will arise a d d faction, which will shake this  
province to iis foundation.” Ruggles’ foresight  
reached not beyond his nose. That election has  
shaken two continents and will shake all four.—  
For ten years, Mr. Otis, at the head of his country’s  
cause, conducted the town of Boston, and the peo-  
pie ci tie province, with a prudence and fortitude,  
and at every sacrifice of personal interest,and amidsi  
unceaslig persecution, which would have done ho-  
nor to the Most virtuous patriot or martyr of an-  
trquity.

and southern colonies,  
  
John Adams, who was present at  
the hearing as a newly admitted  
member of the bar, took notes of Otis’  
arguments, which he afterwards ex-  
panded into the fullest account we  
have of it. “In this chamber,” wrote  
Adams, “near the fire, were seated  
five judges, with Lieut.-Gov. Hutch-  
inson at their head, as chief-justice;  
all in their new fresh robes of scarlet  
English cloth, in their broad bands

all the barristers of Boston and its

“Two portraits, at more than full  
length, of King Charles II. and King  
James II., in splendid gilded frames  
were hung on the most conspicuous  
side of the apartment. They  
had been sent over without frames in  
Gov. Pownal’s time. But as he was  
no admirer of the Charleses or  
Jameses, they were stowed away ina  
garret among rubbish till Gov. Ber-  
nard came, had them cleaned, superbly  
framed, and placed in council for the  
admiration and imitation of all men.”

his old instructor, Jeremiah Gridley,  
against the application for the writs.  
The cause came on for trial in Febru-  
ary, 1761, in the old Town House in  
Boston, before the five judges of the  
Superior Court, Hutchinson being the  
Chief Justice.  
President Adams said of this occa-

ican independence was then and there  
born. The seeds of patriots and he-  
roes, to defend the Non Sine Dus Ani-

youth, were then and there sown. Ev-

I did, ready to take up arms against  
writs of assistance. Then and there  
was the first scene of the first act of  
opposition to the arbitrary claims of  
Great Britain. Then and there the  
child Independence was born. In fif-  
teen years, that is, in 1776, he grew up  
to manhood and declared himself free.  
  
Mr. Otis’s argument lasted for  
nearly five hours, and after its close  
the court adjourned for consideration.  
At the end of the term Chief Justice  
Hutchinson pronounced the opinion:  
“The court has considered the subject  
of writs of assistance, and can see no  
foundation for such a writ; but, as the  
practice in England is not known, it  
has been thought best to continue the  
question to the next term, that, in the  
mean time, opportunity may be given  
to know the result.” «The next term  
came, but no judgment was pro-  
nounced, and nothing was said about  
the writs. However, nothing more was  
heard of this odious instrument.

“Is your daughter, Mrs. Stuart,”—so the  
first lettere—“‘who I am credibly informed  
is one of the most accomplished of ladies,  
a painter? Are you acquainted with Miss  
Lydia Smith, who, I am also credibly in-  
formed, is one of the most accomplished  
ladies and a painter? Do you know Mr.  
Sargent? Do you correspond with your  
old companion in arms, Colonel John  
Trumbull? Do you think Fisher will be an  
historical painter? Whenever you shall  
find a painter, male or female, I pray you  
to suggest a scene and a subject for the  
pencil.  
  
“The scene is the Council Chamber in  
the old Town House in Boston. The date  
is the month of February, 1761, nine years  
before you entered my office in Cole Lane.  
As this was five years before you entered  
college, you must have been in the second  
form of Master Lovell’s school. That  
council chamber was as respectable an  
apartment as the House of Commons or  
the House of Lords in Great Britain, in  
proportion, or that in the State House in  
Philadelphia, in which the declaration of  
independence was signed in 1776. In this  
chamber, round a great fire, were seated  
five judges, with Lieutenant-Governor  
Hutchinson at their head, as Chief Justice,  
all arrayed in their new, fresh, rich robes  
of scarlet English broadcloth; in their  
large cambric bands and immense judicial  
  
I31  
wigs. In this chamber were seated at a  
long table all the barristers at law of Bos-  
ton and of the neighboring county of Mid-  
dlesex, in gowns, bands, and tie wigs.  
They were not seated on ivory chairs, but  
their dress was more solemn and more  
pompous than that of the Roman Senate,  
when the Gauls broke in upon them.  
  
“In a corner of the room must be placed,  
as a spectator, an auditor, wit, sense, im-  
agination, genius, pathos, reason, pru-  
dence, eloquence, learning, and immense  
reading, hanging by the shoulders on two  
crutches, covered with a great cloth coat,  
in the person of Mr. Pratt, who had been  
solicited on both sides, but would engage  
on neither, being, as Chief Justice of Ne

York, about to leave Boston forever. Two  
portraits, at more than full length, of King  
Charles the Second and of King James the  
Second, in splendid golden frames, were  
hung up on the most conspicuous sides of  
the apartment. If my young eyes or old  
memory have not deceived me, these were  
as fine pictures as I ever saw; the colors of  
the royal ermines and long flowing robes  
were the most glowing, the figures the  
most noble and graceful, the features the  
most distinct and characteristic, far su-  
perior to those of the King and Queen of  
France in the Senate chamber of Con-  
gress—these were worthy of the pencils of  
Rubens and Vandyke. There was no  
painter in England capable of these at that  
time. They had been sent over without  
frames in Governor Pownall’s time, but  
he was no admirer of Charles or James.  
The pictures were stowed away in a garret  
among rubbish till Governor Bernard  
came, who had them cleaned, superbly  
framed, and placed in council for the ad-  
miration and imitation of all men—no  
doubt with the advice and concurrence of  
Hutchinson and all his nebula of stars and  
satellites.

Quincy and John Adams had been admit-  
ted barristers at that term. John was the  
youngest; he should be painted
