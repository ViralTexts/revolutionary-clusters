.  
The Empire of Russia is supposed to be the largest in the world but it was formerly of no consideration in Europe. It was indeed plunged into the lowest degree of barbarism, when Peter the first very justly surnamed the Great came to the throne. He was born in 1672. At twenty five years of age he went into Holland to the village of Saardam, and there enrolled himself as a common ship-carpenter, until he had learned the art of ship-building. He applied himself by turns to every sort of the mechanicks, and in the mean time reformed his country. The following is an eulogy of this prince by Thomson in his Winter.  
  
“What cannot active government perform,  
New moulding man? wide stretching from these shores  
A people savage from remotest time.  
A huge, neglected empire, ONE VAST MIND  
By heaven inspired from Gothic darkness call’d.  
Immortal Peter! first of Monarchs! He  
His stubborn country tamed, her rocks, her fens;  
Her floods, her seas, her ill submitting sons;  
And while the fierce Barbarian he subdued,  
To more exalted soul he rais’d the Man.  
Ye shades of antient heroes, ye who toil’d  
Thro’ long successive ages to build up  
A labouring plan of state, behold at once  
The wonder done! behold the matchless prince!  
Who left his native throne where reign’d till then  
A mighty shadow of unreal power;  
Who greatly spurn’d the slothful pomp of courts;  
And roaming every land, in every port  
His sceptre laid aside, with glorious hand  
Unwearied, plying the mechanic tool,  
Gather’d the seeds of trade, of useful arts  
Of civil wisdom, and of martial skill.  
Charg’d with the stores of Europe, home he goes!  
Then cities rise amid th’illumined wastes  
O’er joyless desarts smiles the rural reign;  
Far distant flood to flood is social joined,  
Th’astonished Euxine hears the Baltick roar,  
Proud navies ride on seas that never foam’d  
With daring keel before; and armies stretch  
Each way their dazzling files, repressing here  
The frantic Alexander of the North,  
And awing there stern Othman’s shrinking sons.  
Sloth flies the land, and ignorance, and vice  
Of old dishonour proud: it glows around.   
Taught by the ROYAL HAND that rous’d the whole,  
One scene of arts, of arms, of rising trade:  
For what his wisdom plann’d and power enforc’d  
More potent still, his great example shew’d.  
  
The famous Voltaire has written a hi
