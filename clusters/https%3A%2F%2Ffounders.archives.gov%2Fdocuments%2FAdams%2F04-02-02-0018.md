Your Favour of June 15. 1776 was handed to me, by the last Post. . . . I hold myself much obliged to you for your Attention to me, at this Distance, from those Scenes, in which, altho I feel myself deeply interested, yet I can neither be an Actor nor Spectator.  
You have given me (not withstanding all your modest Apologies) with a great deal of real Elegance and Perspicuity, a minute and circumstantial Narration of the whole Expedition to the lower Harbour, against the Men of War.—It is lawfull you know to flatter the Ladies a little, at least if Custom can make a Thing lawfull: but, without availing myself in the least degree of this Licence, I can safely say, that from your Letter and another from Miss Paine to her Brother, I was enabled to form a more Adequate Idea of that whole Transaction, than from all the other Accounts of it, both in News papers and private Letters which have come to my Hands.  
In Times as turbulent as these, commend me to the Ladies for Historiographers. The Gentlemen are too much engaged in Action. The Ladies are cooler Spectators. . . . There is a Lady at the Foot of Pens Hill, who obliges me, from Time to Time with clearer and fuller Intelligence, than I can get from a whole Committee of Gentlemen.  
I was a little mortified, at the unlucky Calm, which retarded the Militia from Braintree, Weymouth and Hingham. I wished that they might have had more than half the Glory of the Enterprize. However, it satisfies me to reflect, that it was not their Fault but the fault of the Wind that they had not.  
I will inclose to you a Declaration, in which all America is remarkably united. . . . It compleats a Revolution, which will make as good a Figure in the History of Mankind, as any that has preceeded it—provided always, that the Ladies take Care to record the Circumstances of it, for by the Experience I have had of the other Sex, they are either too lazy, or too active, to commemorate them.  
A Continuance of your Correspondence, Miss Polly, would much oblige me. My Compliments to Papa, and Mamma and the whole Family. . . . I hope they will see more serene Skies. I begin now to flatter my self, however, that you are situated in the safest Place upon the Continent.  
Howes Army and Fleet are at Staten Island. But there is a very numerous Army, at New York and New Jersey, to oppose them. Like Noahs Dove, without its Innocence, they can find no Rest.  
  
I am, with much Respect, Esteem and Gratitude, Your Friend and humble Servant,

Philadelphia, Pa., July 5,1776.  
Miss Polly: Your favor of June 15,  
1776, was handed to me by .the last  
post. I hold myself much obliged for  
your attention to me at this distance  
from those scenes in which, although I  
feel myßelf deeply interested, yet I can  
neither be an actor nor spectator. You  
have given me (notwithstanding all  
your modest apologies), with a great  
deal of real elegance and perspicuity, a  
minute and circumstantial of the whole  
expedition to the lower harbor against  
the man-of-war. It is lawful, you  
know, to flatter the ladies a little—at  
least if custom can make a thing law­  
ful—but without availing myself in the  
least of this license I can safely say  
that from your letter and one from  
Miss Paine to her brother, I was en­  
abled to form a more adequate idea of  
that whole transaction than from all  
the other accounts of it, both in the  
newspapers and private letters which  
have come to my hands. In times as  
turbulent as these commend me to the  
ladies for historiographers. The gentle­  
men are too much engaged, in action;  
the ladies are cooler spectators. There  
is a lady at the foot of Pen’s Hill who  
obliges me from time with cleverer  
public intelligence than I can get from  
a whole-committee of gentlemen.  
I was a little mortified at the unlucky  
calm which retarted the militia from  
Braintree, Weymouth and Ilingham. I  
wished that they might have had more  
than half the glory of the enterprise;  
however, it satisfies me that it was not  
their fault, but the fault of the wind  
they had not.  
I will enclose to you a declaration in  
which all America is remarkably united.  
It completes a revolution which makes  
as great a figure in the history of man­  
kind as any that have preceded it, pro­  
vided always that the ladies take care  
to record the circumstances of it, for  
by the experience I have had of the  
other sex they are either too lazy or too  
active to commemorate them.  
A continuance of your corresjxni­  
dence, Miss Polly, would much oblige  
me. Compliments to papa and mam­  
ma and the whole family. I liegin now  
to flatter myself that you are situated  
in the safest place on the continent.  
Howe&#x27;s army and fleet are at Staten  
Island, but there is a very numerous  
army at New York and New Jersey to  
oppose him. Like Noah’s dove—with­  
out its innocence—they can find no  
rest.  
I am, with much respect, esteem and  
gratitude, your friend and humble ser­  
vant, John Adams
