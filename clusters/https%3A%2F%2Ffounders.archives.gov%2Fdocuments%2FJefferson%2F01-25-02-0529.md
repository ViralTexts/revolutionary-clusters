the French republic to the United States of America was understood  
to be on his passage, the president (Washington) did, on the 18th of  
April, address the following questionsto the three secretaries and the  
attorney-general, who on ail umportant occasions formed his council  
  
of state. |  
‘ Qaeition 1. Shall a minister from the republic of France be re«

* Question z. Shall the United States consider the treaties hereto-  
fore made with France, as applying io the present situation of the
