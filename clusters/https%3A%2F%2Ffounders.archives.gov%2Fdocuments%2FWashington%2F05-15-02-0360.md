Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
United States 28. March 1794.  
  
In the execution of the resolution of Congress, bearing date the 26. of March 1794, and  
imposing an embargo, I have requested the Governors of the several States to call forth  
the force of their militia, if it should be necessary for the detention of vessels. This  
power is conceived to be incidental to an embargo.  
It also deserves the attention of Congress, how far the clearances from one district to  
another, under the law as it now stands, may give rise to evasions of the embargo. As  
one security, the Collectors have been instructed to refuse to receive the surrender of  
coasting licences for the purpose of taking out registers, and to require bond from  
registered vessels, bound from one district to another, for the delivery of the cargo  
within the United States.  
It is not understood, that the resolution applies to fishing vessels; although their  
occupations lie generally in parts beyond the United States. But  
without further restrictions there is an opportunity of their priviledges being used as  
means of eluding the embargo.  
All armed vessels, possessing public commissions from any foreign power (letters of  
marque excepted) are considered as not liable to the embargo.  
These circumstances are transmitted to Congress for their consideration.

could not fail to terminate in the entire  
destruction of the leaders, and in the ut-  
ter ruin of such persons as should have  
the temerity to join them. We therefore  
; think it was not unwise to recommend to  
] the people the « suppression,’’ the more  
particularly as an important election is  
approaching, at which the people may  
incline to take their affairs out of the  
hands ol the faction, into their own keep-  
ing  
  
licenses for the purpose of taking out rtgis’  
ters, and to require bond from registered ves-  
sels, bound from one district to another, for  
the delivery of the cargo within the U States.  
  
It is not understood, that the resolution ap-  
plies to fishing vessels, although their occu-  
pations lie generally in parts beyond the Uni-  
ter. States. lin! without further restrictions ,  
there is an opportunity of ti.cir privileges being  
used as means nf eluding the Embargo.  
  
All armed vessels, possessing public com-  
missions from any foreign power, (letter-of-  
marque excepted) are considered «.s not liable  
for the embargo. These circumstances are  
transmitted to Congress for thvir considera-  
tion.
