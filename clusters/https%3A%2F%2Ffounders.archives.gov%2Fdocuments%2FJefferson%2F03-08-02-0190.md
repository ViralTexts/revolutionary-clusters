ny other striking matters, was the head of a mammoth, or, as Cuvier calls it, a mastodon, containing the only os frontis, Mr. Jefferson tells me, that has yet been found. On the fourth side, in odd union with a fine painting of the Repentance of Saint Peter, is an Indian map on leather, of the southern waters of the Missouri, and an Indian representation of a bloody battle, handed down in their traditions.  
Through this hall—or rather museum—we passed to the dining-room, and sent our letters to Mr. Jefferson, who was of course in his study. Here again we found ourselves surrounded with paintings that seemed good.  
  
We had hardly time to glance at the pictures before Mr. Jefferson entered; and if I was astonished to find Mr. Madison short and somewhat awkward, I was doubly astonished to find Mr. Jefferson, whom I had always supposed to be a small man, more than six feet high, with dignity in his appearance, and ease and graciousness in his manners. .…	He rang, and sent to Charlottesville for our baggage,  
and, as dinner approached, took us to the drawing-room,—a large and rather elegant room, twenty or thirty feet high,—which, with the hall I have described, composed the whole centre of the house, from top to bottom. The floor of this room is tessellated. It is formed of alternate diamonds of cherry and beech, and kept polished as highly as if it were of fine mahogany.  
Here are the best pictures of the collection. Over the fireplace is the Laughing and Weeping Philosophers, dividing the world between them; on its right, the earliest navigators to America,—Columbus, Americus Vespuccius, Magellan, etc.,—copied, Mr. Jefferson said, from originals in the Florence Gallery. Farther round, Mr. Madison in the plain, Quaker-like dress of his youth, Lafayette in his Revolutionary uniform, and Franklin in the dress in which we always see him. There were other pictures, and a copy of Raphael’s Transfiguration.

 ground of their love of old books and young society.  
On Sunday morning, after breakfast, Mr. Jefferson asked me into his library, and there I spent the forenoon of that day as I had that of yesterday. This collection of books, now so much talked about, consists of about seven thousand volumes, contained in a suite of fine rooms, and is arranged in the catalogue, and on the shelves, according to the divisions and subdivisions of human learning by Lord Bacon. In so short a time I could not, of course, estimate its value, even if I had been competent to do so.  
Perhaps the most curious single specimen—or, at least, the most characteristic of the man and expressive of his hatred of royalty—was a collection which he had bound up in six volumes, and lettered “The Book of Kings,” consisting of the “Memoires de la Princesse de Bareith,” two volumes;  
	 “Les Memoires de la Comtesse de la Motte,” two volumes;the “Trial of the Duke of York,” one volume; and “The Book,” one volume. These documents of regal scandal seemed to be favorites with the philosopher, who pointed them out to me with a satisfaction somewhat inconsistent with the measured gravity he claims in relation to such subjects generally.

it is with the others. At eight o’clock the first bell is rung in the great hall, and at nine the second summons you to the breakfast-room, where you find everything ready. After breakfast every one goes, as inclination leads him, to his chamber, the drawing-room, or the library. The children retire to their school-room with their mother, Mr. Jefferson rides to his mills on the Rivanna, and returns at about twelve. At half past three the great bell rings, and those who are disposed resort to the drawing-room, and the rest go to the dining-room at the second call of the bell, which is at four o’clock. The dinner was always choice, and served in the French style; but no wine was set on the table till the cloth was removed. The ladies sat until about six, then retired, but returned with the tea-tray a little before seven, and spent the evening with the gentlemen; which was always pleasant, for they are obviously accustomed to join in the conversation, however high the topic may be. At about half past ten, which seemed to be their usual hour of retiring, I went to my chamber, found there a fire, candle, and a servant in waiting to receive my orders for the morning, and in the morning was waked by his return to build the fire

Two little incidents which occurred while we were at Monticello should not be passed by. The night before we left, young Randolph came up late from Charlottesville, and brought the astounding news that the English had been defeated before New Orleans by General Jackson. Mr. Jefferson had made up his mind that the city would fall, and told me that the English would hold it permanently—or for some time—by a force of Sepoys from the East Indies. He had gone to bed, like the rest of us; but of course his grandson went to his chamber with the paper containing the news. But the old philosopher refused to open his door, saying he could wait till the morning; and when we met at breakfast I found he had not yet seen it.

From his manner, I supposed it an affair of small consequence, but at Charlottesville, on my way to Richmond, I found the country ringing with it. Mr. Jefferson’s great dam was gone, and it would cost $30,000 to rebuild it.

Franklin. The library, consisting of  
about seven thousand volumes, was ar-  
ranged in the catalogue and on the shelves  
according to the divisions and subdivis-  
ions of human learning by Lord Bacon.  
  
Perhaps the most curious single specimen  
—or, at least, the most characteristic of the  
man and expressive of his hatred of royalty —  
was a collection which he had bound up in  
six volumes, and lettered “The Book of  
Kings,” consisting of the “ A/émoires de la  
Princesse de Baireuth,’” two volumes; “ Les  
Mémoires de la Comtesse de la Motte,” two vol-  
umes ; the “ Trial of the Duke of York,” one  
volume ; and “ Zhe Book,” one volume. These  
documents of regal scandal seemed to be  
favorites with the philosopher, who pointed  
them out to me with a satisfaction somewhat  
inconsistent with the measured gravity he  
claims in relation to such subjects generally.

Jefferson, are worthy of note. ‘We had hardly time to glance  
at the pictures’, he says, ‘before Mr. Jefferson entered ; and if I  
was astonished to find Mr. Madison short and somewhat awkward,  
I was doubly astonished to find Mr. Jefferson, whom I had  
always supposed to be a small man, more than six feet high, with  
dignity in his appearance and graciousness in his manners. . . .  
There is a breathing of notional philosophy in Mr. Jefferson—in  
his dress, his house, his conversation. His setness, for instance,  
in wearing very sharp-toed shoes, corduroy small-clothes, and red  
plush waistcoat, which have been laughed at till he might have  
wisely dismissed them’. Mr. Jefferson’s famous library of seven  
thousand volumes was arranged, both in the catalogue and on  
the shelves, according to the divisions of learning by Lord Bacon.  
‘Two little incidents which occurred while we were at Monti-  
cello’, says Mr. Ticknor, ‘should not be passed by. The night  
before we left, young Randolph came up late from Charlottesville,  
and brought the astounding news that the English had been de-  
feated before New Orleans by General Jackson. Mr. Jefferson  
had made up his mind that the city would fall, and told me that  
the English would hold it permanently—or for some time—by a  
force of Sepoys from the East Indies. He had gone to bed, like

the rest of us; but of course his grandson went to his door with  
the paper containing the news. But the old philosopher refused  
to open his door, saying he could wait till the morning ; and when  
we met at breakfast, [ found he had not seen it. ... One  
morning, when he came back from his ride, he told Mr. Ran-  
dolph, very quietly, that the dam had been carried away the  
night before. From his manner, I supposed it an affair of small  
consequence, but at Charlottesville, on my way to Richmond, I  
found the country ringing with it. Mr. Jefferson’s great dam  
was gone, and it would cost $30,000 to rebuild it’.
