 Uncle Thomas’s only Child Mrs. Fisher, the same that left you the Legacy. However I shall not do it unless I determine to remain in England, which I have not yet done.  
As to the Reports you mention that are spread to my Disadvantage, I give myself as little Concern about them as possible. I have often met with such Treatment from People that I was all the while endeavouring to serve. At other times I have been extoll’d extravagantly when I have had little or no Merit. These are the Operations of Nature. It sometimes is cloudy, it rains, it hails; again ’tis clear and pleasant, and the Sun shines on us. Take one thing with another, and the World is a pretty good sort of a World; and ’tis our Duty to make the best of it and be thankful. One’s true Happiness depends more upon one’s own Judgement of one’s self, on a Consciousness of Rectitude in Action and Intention, and in the Approbation of those few who judge impartially, than upon the Applause of the unthinking undiscerning Multitude, who are apt to cry Hosanna today, and tomorrow, Crucify him. I see in the Papers that your Governor, Mr. Barnard, has been hardly thought of, and a little unkindly treated, as if he was a favourer of the Stamp Act

in London, in 1766, he adverted in a letter to a friend in  
America, to reports which were spread by his enemies in this  
country to his disadvantage :  
  
“T give myself,” he says, “as little concern about them as  
possible. I have often met with such treatment from people,  
that I was all the while endeavouring to serve. At other times,  
I have been extolled where I had little or no merit...... One’s  
true happiness depends more upon one’s own judgment of one’s  
self, or a consciousness of rectitude in action and intention, and  
the approbation of those few who judge impartially, than upon  
the applause of the unthinking, undiscerning multitude, who are

of the best books of the kind in any  
language.”  
  
Franklin, in a letter to his sister, re-  
ferring to unjust treatment and extravy-  
agant praise, strikes the key-note of his  
own life. ‘These are the operations of  
nature. It sometimes is cloudy, it  
rains, it hails; again it is clear and  
pleasant and the sun shines on us.  
Take one thing with another, the world  
is a pretty good sort of a world, and it  
is our duty to make the most of it and  
be thankful. One’s true happiness de-  
pends more upon one’s own judgment  
of one’s self or a consciousness of recti-  
tude in action and intention and the  
approbation of those few who judge  
impartially, than upon the applause of  
the unthinking, undiscerning multitude  
who are apt to cry ‘Hosanna’ to-day,  
and to-morrow, ‘ Crucify him.’ ”
