 vessels and other property of citizens of the United States, under colour of authority or commissions from his Britannic majesty, in which adequate compensation for the losses and damages sustained, cannot, for whatever reason, be actually obtained in the ordinary course of justice, full and complete compensation for the same will be made by the British government to the claimants; except where the loss or damage may have been occasioned by the manifest delay, or negligence, or wilful omission of those claimants. 2. The amount of the losses and damages to be compensated is to be ascertained by five commissioners, who are to be appointed in exactly the same manner as those for liquidating the compensation to British creditors. 3. These commissioners are to take a similar oath, and to exercise similar powers for the investigation of claims with those other commissioners, and they are to decide according to the merits of the several cases and to justice, equity, and the laws of nations. 4. The same term of eighteen months is allowed for the reception of claims, with a like discretion to extend the term as in the case of British debts. 5. The award of these commissioners or of three of them, under the like guards as in that case, is to be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim and the amount of the compensation. And, lastly, His Britannic majesty is to cause the compensation awarded to be paid to the claimants in specie, without deduction, at such times and places, and upon the condition of such releases or assignments, as the commissioners shall prescribe.  
Mutually and dispassionately examined, it is impossible not to be convinced, that this provision is ample and ought to be satisfactory. The course of the discussion will exhibit various proofs of the disingenuousness of the clamo

It admits fully and explicitly the principle, that compensation is to be made for the losses and damages sustained by our citizens, by irregular or illegal captures, or condemnations of their vessels and other property] under colour of authority (which includes Governmental orders and instructions) or of commissions from his Britannic Majesty. It is to be observed that the causes of the losses and damages are mentioned in the disjunctive, “captures or co

 Government.  
For the very reason that this subtil and artificial meaning ascribed to the term would tend to defeat the manifest general intent of the main provision of the Article, which is plainly to give reparation for irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of American property contrary to the laws of nations—that meaning must be deemed inadmi

ity and the laws of Nations.” Wherever these laws as received and practiced among Nations pronounce a capture or condemnation of neutral property to have been irregular or illegal, though by color of an authority or commission of his Britannic Majesty, it will be the duty of the Commissioners to award compensation.  
The criticism however fails on its own principle when tested by the fact. The great source of grievance intended to be redressed by the article proceeded from the instruction of the 6th of November 1793. That instruction directs the Commanders of Ships of War and Privateers to stop and detain all ships laden with goods the produce of any colony belonging to France or carrying provisions and other supplies for the use of such colony and to bring the same with their cargoes to legal adjudication in the British Courts of Admiralty. These terms “l

 in other words to Arbitrators mutually appointed.  
It is here that we find the reparation of the national wrong which we had suffered. In admitting the principle of compensation by the Government itself, in agreeing to an extraordinary Tribunal in the constitution of which both parties have an equal voice to liquidate that compensation—Great Britain has virtually and effectually acknowleged the injury which had been done to our neutral rights and has consented to make satisfaction for it. This was an apology in fact, however it may be in form.  
As it regards our honor, this is an adequate atonement and the only species usual in similar cases between nations. Pecuniary compensation is the true reparation in such cases. Governments are not apt to go upon their knees to ask pardon of other governments. Great Britain in the recent instance of the dispute with Spain about Nootka sound was glad to accept a like reparation. It merits an incidental remark that the instrument which settles this dispute expressly waves like our Treaty reference to the merits of the complaints &amp; pretensions of the respective parties. Is our situation such as to authorise us to pretend to impose humiliating conditions on other Nations?
