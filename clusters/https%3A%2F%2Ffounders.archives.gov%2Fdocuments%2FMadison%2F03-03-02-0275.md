The petition of the Inhabitants of the Town of New Haven in Connecticut, in legal Town meeting convened. Respectfully sheweth  
That your petitioners are in general, either directly engaged in mercantile pursuits, or in the occupations connected with them; in those pursuits, they have embarked their fortunes, and from them, they have not only derived a subsistence for themselves, and their families, but have furnished employment, for great numbers of persons; to the mechanic, they have opened a market, for the productions of his labour and skill; to the Farmer for the products of his fields; and at the same time, they have essentially aided the public revenue, by duties paid on their importations.  
The foreign commerce, in which your petitioners are engaged, is principally with the British West India islands. In conformity to the Laws of their Country, by which that trade was sanctioned, and without any suspicion, that it would suddenly be prohibited, they shipped, during the last summer and autumn, as they have always been accustomed to do, numerous Cargoes, which have been sold on credit in the Islands, on an engagement to receive payment in produce, when the Crops come in, which they usually do in the months of March &amp; April. The property thus received, they have been, in consequence of the Non-importation Law, prevented from bringing home; and your petitioners have now, from this and other causes, a large amount of property, in the British West India Islands: which must remain there greatly to their loss and disadvantage, untill that Law is repealed; in the mean time their Vessels will be useless to them, their seamen unemployed, and a Commerce once profitable &amp; flourishing abandoned.  
Your petitioners while engaged in a lawful commerce, have thus suddenly, without time being allowed them to escape, been overtaken by these Calamities. Under such circumstances of suffering, they very naturally enquire, from whence they proceeded, and whether they were inflicted by a Constitutional authority. In making this enquiry they cannot forget, that one important grievance, Complained of in the declaration of Independance, was, “Cutting off our trade” and that to, “establish Commerce,” was one of the great objects, proposed in that memorable instrument; nor can they bring themselves to beleive that in the National Compact, by the power “to regulate Commerce” the States intended to grant a power to destroy it.  
Your petitioners, are far from imputing to the general Legislature, any but the most correct motives, in passing the non-importation Law: but the consequences of that law, are peculiarly destructive to their Interests: it places them in a state of uncommon embarrassment; it ruins their property; it dries up the sources of their prosperity; and they perceive no relief except from its repeal.  
If the operations of the Non-Importation Law, thus severe and oppressive, not only to your petitioners, but to all persons Concerned in Foreign Commerce; does not present one of those “extraordinary occasions” which authorize the President to convene Congress, your petitioners respectfully suggest that such “occasion” may be found in the change which has taken place in our Foreign relations. The presidents proclamation, and the Law in question, was founded on an engagement of the French Government, to revoke the Berlin &amp; Milan Decrees. Those Decrees it now appears have in fact not been revoked—that Power has not ceased to violate our neutral rights, she sequesters our property in her ports; she burns &amp; sinks our Vessels on the Ocean; and what is still more difficult to comprehend, after such acts, the authors of those injuries and insults receive by Law, a hospitable reception in our harbours.  
Your petitioners therefore, respectfully, solicit the President of the United States, to convene Congress as speedily as his powers will constitutionally allow: in order to enable them, to take the subject of this petition into consideration and of granting to your petitioners such relief as the nature of the case requires. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray  
Sign’d by order and in behalf of the Town of New Haven

RBSPECTFULLT SHHWETH,  
That your petitioners are in general ei­

with them ; in those &quot;pursuits they iiﬄc  
ssembarked their fortunes, anll srcmthem  
they have not only derived ,a subsistem-c  
for themselves and families, but. haw  
furnished employment for great numbers  
of persons; to the simeehanie they haue.  
opened a market foe the pl&#x27;Odllt&#x27;iltms of

thine they have csscutiztlly nided the pub­  
lic &#x27;rezssessnue by duties paid on their in&quot;.—

The i&#x27;ol&#x27;eign commercc in which your  
etitionel&#x27;s are engaged is principallywizh  
the British W&#x27;est lndia islands; in con­  
i&#x27;ol&#x27;mity to the laws of their country la),­  
which that trade was sanctioned. and  
without any suspicion that it would sud­  
denly be. prohibited, they shipped during­  
the last Sunimer and Autumn us the; haue  
t&#x27;ways been aeeustomed to do, numerous  
eal&#x27;goes nhieh have been sold on eredit in

payment in produce when the erops come­  
in, nhieh they usually do insi&#x27;t&#x27;ht&#x27; mouths  
of March and Apl&#x27;il—Thsiesi property thus  
received, they have bcenin consequence  
of the non-importation huy prevented frmn  
bringing home; and your petitioners have  
now from this and othcz&#x27;cnuses &amp; large a­  
mount of propel&#x27;t&#x27; in the British West­  
lndia Islands, whi-h must remain there  
greatly to their loss and disndvnntage until  
that law is repenied; in the mean time  
their vessels will be useless to them, their  
seunien nnemployed, and a eonune we  
once profitable and ﬂourishing, abandon­  
ed.  
Your petitioners While engaged in a.  
lawful eommeree have thus suddenly,  
without time being allowed them to es­  
enpe, been overtahen by these enlanzities.  
Under such circumstances of suﬀering,  
they very naturally inquire from whence.  
they proceeded, and whether they were\
inﬂicted by aeonstitutional authority ? in  
making this cnquiry they _eannot forget  
that one important grievance complained  
of in the Declaration of Independence,  
was &quot; cutting osi&#x27; our trade&quot; and that to  
&quot; estahlish eommcrce&quot; was one of the  
great ohjeets proposed in that memorable  
instrument; nor can they bring them­  
selves to believe that in the national eom­  
paet by the power &quot; to regulate com­  
merce&quot; the states intended to g-nnt a  
  
power to destroy it.  
Your petitionersct are far from imputing  
to the general legislature-any but the most  
correct motives in passing the non-im­  
portation law, but the eonsequences of  
that law, are peculiarly destructive to  
their interests, it places them in&#x27;a state  
of uncommon embarrassmcnts, it ruins  
their property, it dries up the sources of  
their property, and they perceive no re­  
lief ekcept from its repcal.  
lt&#x27;the operation of the non-importation  
law, thus severe and oppressive not only  
to your petitioners, but to all persons consi  
cerned in soreign commeree, does not pre­  
sentsi one of those &quot; extraordinary occa­  
sions&quot; which authorizes the president to  
convene eongress: your petitioners re­  
speetfully suggest, that such &quot; occasion&quot;  
may be found in the change which has tak­  
en place in our foreign relations. The  
ct&#x27;siu&#x27;esident&#x27;s preclamation, and the law in  
question, werd founded on an&#x27;engagement  
of the French government to revoke the  
Berlin and Milan decrees. Those decrees,­  
it now appears, have in fact not been re­  
voked. That power has not ceased to vi­  
olate our neutral rights. She sequesters  
our property in her ports ; she burns or  
sinks our vessels on the ocean ; and, what  
is still more difficult to eomprehend, after  
such acts, the authors of these injuries  
and insults receive by law a hospitabie re­  
eeption in our harbors.  
Your petitioncrs, therefore, respectfujqct

to eonvene eongress as speedily as his  
power Will constitutionally allow, in order  
to enable them to take the subject of this

The fictition of the inhabitants of the town of  
jYew~Haven,in Connecticut, in legal Town  
meeting convened.  
Respectfully sheweth.  
That your petitioners are in general either I  
directly engaged in mercantile pursuits, or in  
the occupations connected with them ; in  
those pursuits they have embarked their for­  
tunes, &amp; from them they have not only deriv­  
ed a subsistence for themselves &amp; families, but  
havefurnished employment for great numbers  
of persons; to the Mechanic they*have opened  
a market for the productions pf his labour and  
skill; to the Farmer for the products cf his  
fields ; and at the same time they have es­  
sentially aided the public revenue by duties  
paid on their importations.  
The foreign commerce in which your peti­  
tioners are engaged is principally with the  
British W. India islands ; in conformity to the  
laws of their country by which that trade was  
sanctioned, and without any suspicion that  
it would suddenly be prohibited, they shipped  
during the last Summer and Autumn as they  
have always been accustomed to do, numer­  
ous cargoes which have been sold on credit  
in the islands on an engagement to receive  
payment in produce when the crops come in,  
which they usually do in the months of  
March and April—The property thus recei­  
ved, they have been in consequence of the  
non-importation law prevented from bringiug  
home ; and your Petitioners have now from  
this and other causes a large amount of pro­  
perty in the British West India Islands, v/hich  
must remain there greatly to their loss and  
disadvantage until that law is repealed : in  
  
the mean time their vessels will be useless to  
them, their seamen unemployed, and a com­  
merce once profitable and flourishing, aban­  
doned.  
Your petitioners while engaged in a lawful  
commerce have thus suddenly, without time  
being allowed them to escape, been overtaken  
by these calamities. Under such circum­  
stances of suffering, they very naturally en­  
quire from whence they proceeded, and whe­  
ther they were inflicted’ by a constitutional  
authority f In making this enquiry they can­  
not forget that one important grievance com­  
plained of in the declaration of Independence  
was &quot; cutting off our trade” &amp; that to &quot;esta­  
blish commerce** was one of the great objects  
proposed in that memorable instrument; nor  
can they bring themselves to believe that in  
I the national compact by the power “to re­  
gulate commerce&#x27;* the Statesintendedto grant  
a power to destroy it.  
Your petitioners are far from imputing to  
| the general Legislature any but the most cor­  
rect motives in passing the non-importation  
j law, b»»t thexonsequences of that law, are pe­  
culiarly destructive to their interests, it pla­  
[ ees them in a state of uncommon embarrass­  
ment, it ruins their property, it dries up the  
sources of their property, and they perceive  
1 no relief except from its repeal.  
If the operation of the uon-importationlaw,  
thus severe and oppressive not only to your  
petitioner, but to all persons concerned in  
foreign commerce, does uot present one of  
♦hose &quot; extraordinary occasions” which au­  
thorises the President to convene congress:  
! your petitioners respectfully suggest, that  
such “ occasion” may be found in tiie change  
which has taken place in our foreign relati­  
ons. The President’s Proclamation, and the  
law in question, were founded on an engage­  
ment of the French government to revoke  
the Milan and Berlin decrees. These de­  
rtcc3, it now appears, have in fact not been  
revoked. That power has not ceased to vio­  
late our rights. She sequetters our proper­  
ty In her ports ; she burns or sinks our ves­  
sels on the ocean ;and what is still more diffi­  
cult to comprehend, after such acts, the au­  
thors of these injuries and insults receive by  
law a hospitable reception in our harbors.  
Your petitioners, therefore, rcspec»fully so­  
licit the prciidorii of the United Srtut -s&gt; to con­  
  
vcrv&#x27;. congress is speedily as his power will  
constitutionally allow, in order to enable them  
to take the s ibject of this petition into consi­  
deration, and ot granting to your petitioners  
suca relief as the nature of the case requires.  
And your petitioners, as in duty bound,  
See. &#x27; _

Z&#x27;he Petition of the Inhabitants of the town of  
  
New-Haven, in Connecticut, in legal  
town meeting convencd,  
  
RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH,  
  
That your petitioners are in general either  
directly engaged in mercantile pursuits or in  
the occupations connected with them ; in  
those pursuits they have embarked their for­  
tunes, and from them they have not only de­  
rived a subsistence for themselves and fami­  
lics, but have furnished employment for great  
numbers of persons ; to the Mechanick they  
have opened a market for the produciion of  
his labour and skill ; to the Farmer for the  
product of his fields ; and at the same time  
they have essentially aided the publick reve­  
nue by duties paid on their importations.  
The foreign commerce in which your Pe­  
titloners arve engaged is principally with the  
British West-India Islands ; in conformity to  
the laws of their country by which thut trade  
was sanctioned, and without any suspicion  
that it would suddenly be pronhibited, they  
shipped during the last summer and autumn  
as they have always been accustomed to do,  
numerous cargees which have been sold on  
credit in the Islands, on an engagement to re­  
ceive payment in produce when the crops  
come in, which they usually do in the months  
of March and April— Uhe property thus re­  
ceived, they have been in consequence of the  
non-importation law prevented from bringing  
home ; and your Petitioners have now from  
this and other causes a large amount of prop­  
erty in the British West-india Islands, which  
must remain there greatly to their loss and  
dis&#x27;tdvanmgc until that law is repcaled ; in  
the meun time their vessels will be useless to  
them, their seamen unemployed, and a com­  
raerce once profitable and flourishing, abane  
doned.  
  
Your Petitioners while engaged in a law­  
ful commerce have thus suddenly without  
time peing allowed them to escape, been o­  
ve taken by these calamities=Under such  
cirgumstances of suflering, they very natural­  
ly enquire from whence they proceeded, and  
whether they were inflicted by a constitution­  
al authority. In making this enquiry they  
cannot forget that one important grievance  
complained of in the Declaration of ludepen­  
dence was ¢ cutting off our trade’ and that  
to * establish commerce” was one of the  
great objects proposed in that memorable in­  
strument ; nor can they bring themselves to  
believe tuut in the national compact by the  
power ¢ to regulate commerce’ the States  
intended to grant a power to destroy it.  
Your Petitioners are far from imputing to  
the General Legislature any but the most  
correct motives 1o passing the Non-lmporta­  
tion Law, but the consequences of that Law,  
are pecdliarly destructive to their interests,  
it places them in a state of uncommon em­  
barrassments, it ruins the property, it drives  
up the sources of their prosperity, and they  
perceive no reliel except from its repeal.  
If the operation of the Non«lmportation  
Law, thus severe and oppressive not onty ol  
your petitioners, but to all persons concerned  
in forcign commerce, does not present one  
of those * extraordinary occasions” which  
authorizes the President to convene Con­  
gress ;3 your Petitioners respectfully suggest,  
that such “occasion” may be found in the  
change which has taken place in our foreign  
relations. The President’s Proclamation,  
and the Law in question, was founded on an  
engagement to revoke the Berlin and Milan  
decrees. Those decrees, it now appears,  
have in fact not been revoked. That power  
has not ceased to violate our neutral rights.  
She sequesters our property in her ports ;  
she burns or sinks our vessels on the ocean ;  
and, what is still more difficult to compre­  
hend, after such acts, the authors of these  
injuries and insults receive by Law a hospi­  
table reception in our harbours.  
Your petitioners, therefore, respectfully  
solicit the President of the United States to  
convene Congress as speedily as his powers  
wiil constitutionally allow, in order to enable  
them to take the subject of this Petition into  
consideration, and of granting to your Peti­  
tioners such relief as the aature of the case  
requires.  
  
And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, &amp;c

■ The Petition of ihe Inhabitants of the Town  
of Next.Haven, in Connecticut, in legal  
loion meeting, convened,  
Respectfully Shewexh,  
That your Petitioners are in general either  
; directly engaged in mercantile pursuits or in  
the occupations connected with them ; in those  
pursuits they have embarked their fortunes  
and from them they have net only derived a  
subsistence for themselves and families, but  
1 have furnished employment for great numbers  
of persons: to the mechanic they hare opened  
a market for the productions of his labor and  
skill; to the farmer for the products of his  
Fields; and, at the same time, they have es.  
sentially aided the public revenue, by duties  
paid on the importations.  
_ The foreign Commerce in which your Peti­  
tioners are engaged, is principally with the  
British West India Islands; in conformity to  
the Laws of their Country, by which tha*  
trade was sanctioned, and without any sas­  
picion that it would Suddenly be prohibited,  
they shipped during the last summer and  
autumn, as they have always been accustomed  
to do, numerous cargoes which have been sold  
on credit in the Islands, on an engagement to  
receive payment in produce when the crops  
come in, which they usually do in the months  
of March and April. The property thus re­  
ceived, they have been, in consequence of&#x27; the  
Non-Importation La*r, prevented from bring.  
ipg home: and your Petitioners have now,  
from this and other causes,.a large amount of  
property in the British West India Islands,  
which must remain there greatly to their iuss  
and disadvantage until that Law is repealed*  
in the mean time, their vessels will be useless  
to them, their Seamen uti-eraployed, and eora­  
merce, once profitable and flourishing, absa.  
doned.  
Your Petitioners, while engaged in a lawful  
commerce, have thus suddenly, without „mo  
being allowed them to escape^ been overta&amp;ou  
by these calamities. Under such circumstances  
of suffering, they very naturally enquire from  
whence they proceeded, and whether they were  
inflicted by a constitutional authority - I_  
making this enquiry, they cannct forget that  
one important grievance complained of in the  
declaration of independence, was &#x27;• cutting off  
our trade,&quot; and that to &quot; establish commerce&quot;  
was one of the great objects proposed in that  
memorable instrument; nor can they brine  
themselves to believe that in the national com!  
pact by the power &quot; to regulate commerce&quot;  
the States intended to grant power to destroy it.  
Your Petitioners are far from imputing tt&gt;  
the general Legislature any but the most cor­  
rect motives in passing the Non-imrJortatiott  
Law, but the consequences of that Law are  
peculiarly destructive to their interest, it places  
them ma state~of uncommon embarrassment  
it ruins their property, it dries up t^e sources  
of their prosperity, and they persene no  
relief except from its repeal.  
If the.operation of the Non-importati  
Law-, thus severe and oppressive, not only to  
your Petitioners, but ail persons concerned in  
lore.gn Commerce, does not present one of  
those &quot; extraordinary occasions&quot; which au­  
thorises the President to convene Congres»  
your Petitioners respectfully surest thai  
such &quot; occasions&quot;.may be found in the change  
winch has taken place in our foreign relation-,  
Pile President&#x27;s Proclamation, and&quot;the Law in  
question, was founded on an engagement of  
the French Government to revoke the Berlin  
and Milan Decrees. Those decrees, no w ap.  
pears, have in fact, not been revoked. That  
Power has not ceased to violate our neutral  
nghts. She sequesters our property in her  
ports ; she burns or sinks our vessels on the  
Ocean ; and what is still more difficult to  
comprehend, after such acts, the authors of  
these injuries and insults receive by a Jaw a  
hospitable reception in our harbours.  
Your Petitioners, therefore, respectfully  
solicit the President of the United States, to  
convene Congress as speediiy as his powers  
will constitutionally allow, in order to enable  
them to take the subject of this Petition into  
consideration, andof granting to your Petition­  
ers such relief as the nature of the case re«  
quires.
