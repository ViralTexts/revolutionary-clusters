That The several treaties of peace which have been made with the northern tribes of Indians, and those North west of the Ohio, since the conclusion of the late war with Great Britain, are as follows.  
To wit.  
1st The treaty at Fort Stanwix on the 22d day of October 1784 between Oliver Wolcott Richard Butler and Arthur Lee, Commissioners plenipotentiary from the United States on the one part, and the Sachems and warriors of the six nations on the other.  
2nd The treaty entered into by the said commissioners Plenipotentiary and the sachems and warriors, of the Wyandot, Delaware, Chippawa, and Ottawa nations of Indians at Fort McIntosh the 21st day of January 1785.  
3d The treaty at the mouth of the great Miamé the 31st of January 1786, between Commissioners from the united States, and the chiefs and warriors of the Shawanoe nation.  
  
That the treaties of Fort Stanwix and Fort McIntosh were entered on the Journals of the United States in Congress assembled, June the 3d 1785, and the treaty of the miame, on the 17th day of April 1786.  
That it may be proper to observe that the Indians are greatly tenacious of their lands, and generally do not relinquish their right, excepting on the principle of a specific consideration expressly given for the purchase of the same.  
That the practice of the late english Colonies and Government in purchasing the indian claims has firmly established the habit in this respect, So that it cannot be violated, but with difficulty and an expence greatly exceeding the value of the object.  
That the treaties of Fort Stanwix and of Fort McIntosh, do not stat

In January, 1786, atreaty was formed with the Shawanefe, at the confluence  
ef the great Miami with the Ohio.  
  
It was not long before certain turbulent and malignant characters, refiding

tribes of Indians within the limits of the united ftates, inhabiting the country  
north- weft of the Ohio and about Lake Erie, as foon, after the fir of April

ing the caules of yneatineis among the faid tribes, and hearing their compiaints ;  
of regulating trade, and amicably fettling all affairs concerning lands and boun-  
daries between them and the united ftates.”&quot;  
  
On the fecond day of July, 1788, congrefs appropriated ‘* the fum of  
twenty thoufand dollars, in addition to fourteen thouiand dollars before appro-

all the fix or northern nations, the Mohawks excepted—and with a reprefenta-
