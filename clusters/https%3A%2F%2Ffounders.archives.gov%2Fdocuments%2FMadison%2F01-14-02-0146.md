Mr. Madison, after making a few prefatory observations, said he felt himself impelled to take some notice of the arguments that had been used this day on the subject before the House: he would not, however, attempt any reply to the gentleman from New Jersey, nor pretend to follow him in his flights of imagination respecting the New-Jerusalem or the umpirage of Pennsylvania, but leave it to those to whom such observations might have been addressed to draw their own conclusions. He was sorry that it almost always happened, whenever any question of general policy and advantage to the union was before the House, when gentlemen found themselves at a loss for general arguments, they commonly resorted to local views; and at all times as well as the present, when there was most occasion for members to act with the utmost coolness, when their judgments ought to be the least biassed—it was to be regretted that at those times they suffered their feelings, passions and prejudices to govern their reason. Thus it is that the most important points are embarrassed, the northern and southern interests are held up, every local circumstance comes into view, and every idea of liberality and candor is banished.  
The gentleman from New York, (Mr. Lawrance) when he introduced this subject at the commencement of the present session, did it on the most generous plan, and disavowed every principle of calculation so much, that he then declared he had not so much as made a single calculation of the different fractions which have since been introduced into the debate—his only object was to fix a rule on general principles, agreeably to the constitution and to the preservation of the rights of the people; and this idea was approved by two of the gentlemen from New-Jersey, who have since altered their opinions, although they then had no objections but as to the expence; the idea of fractions was not then contended for, but has since become the very essence of the opposition; and we are called on to violate the constitution by adopting a measure that will give representatives for those separate and distinct fractions in the respective states; and afterwards are told it is not to the fractional numbers in the states that they refer, but to the aggregate of the fractions in the United States. If this reasoning is good, why do the gentlemen stop at this boundary of a representation by states? Why not proceed to erect the whole of the United States into one district, without any division, in order to prevent the inequality they conceive to exist in respect to individual states?  
He would not encroach upon the time of the House by protracting the debate, which had already swelled to an immoderate extent. Upon the whole, he said that this was a great question, wherein attention should be paid to the people, and a strict eye kept towards the public good, divested of prejudice; but he had heard with pain how much had been said to divert the House by an attention to fractions, from the true object of general welfare—yet he hoped that the government would be equally administered—that none of those predictions or threats thrown out in the course of the debate, that no mutilation of the union, would take place; but on the contrary, that harmony would guide the decision of this question, free from every local consideration

_ Mr. Madison observed, that the idea of dimi­

The aggregate of these fractions only has been  
taken into consideration ; bur, said he, if the  
fractions of any particular states will be aug­  
mented by the amendment, which would be the  
cafe, he conceived that the argument amounted  
to no good rcafon for agreeing to it—and this  
he said, would evidently be the fact.  
Mr. Williamfon was opposed to a concurrence   
he observed, in general, that the operation of the  
amendment was to diminifli the fractions to the  
Eaflward, and encreafe those to the Southward  
The southern Hates, he said, had fuffered so m uch

Mil. MAbISON, after making a few prefato­  
ry observations, said he felt himfelf impell­  
ed to take some notice of the arguments that had  
been nfed this day, on the fubjedt before the  
House : he would not, however, attempt any re­  
ply to the gentleman from New-Jersey, nor pre­  
tend to follow him iu hit flights of imagination  
refpe&amp;ing the New-Jerusalem or the umpirage  
of Pennsylvania, but leave it to those to whom  
such observations might have been addrefled to  
draw their own concTulions. He was sorry that  
it almost always happened, whenever any quelti­  
on of general policy and advantage to the union  
was before the House, when gentlemen found  
theinfelves at a loss for general arguments,  
tbey commonly resorted to local views ; and at  
all times as well as the present, when there was  
most occasion for members to adt with the utinoft  
coolness, when their judgments ought to be the  
lead biafled—it was to be regretted that at those  
times ihey fuffeved their feelings, palGons and  
prejudices to govern their reason. Thus it is  
that the most important points are embarrafled,  
the northern and southern interests are held up,  
every local circumfiance comes into view, anil  
every idea of liberality and candor is banilh«|d.  
  
The gentleipan from New-York, (Mrt Law­  
rance) when he introdoced this fubjedt at the  
commencement of the prel&#x27;ent session, did it on  
the most generous plan, and disavowed every  
principle of calculation so much, that he then  
declared he had not so much as made a single  
calculation of the different fractions which have  
since been introduced into the debate—his only  
object&#x27;was to fix a rule on general principles, a­  
greeably to the conltitucion and to the   
tion of the rights of the people ; and this idea  
was approved by two of the gentlemen from NeW-  
Jersey, who have since altered their   
although they then had no objections but as to  
the expence : the idea of fractions was not then  
contended for, but has since becoine the very e£  
fence of the opposition ; and we are called on  
to violate the constitution by adopting a meafurc  
that will give representatives for ihofe separate  
and diftimt fractions in the refpetflive states ;  
and afterwards are rold it is not to |the fraifti  
onal numbers in the states that they refer, but to  
the aggregate of the fractions in the United  
States. If this reasoning is good, why do the  
gentlemen flop at this boundary of a representa­

whole of tha United States into one diftridt,with­  
out any division, in order to prevent the inequa­

Mr. Madifon, alter making a few prefatory ebfervations, faid he felt himfelf  
impelled to take fome notice of the arguments that hau been ufed this day, on the  
fubjeQ&amp; before the houfe : he would not, however, attempt any reply to the gentle.  
man from New-Jerfey, nor pretend to follow him in his flights of imagination re-  
ipeGing the New-Jerufalem or the umpirage of Pennfylvania, but leave it to thofe to  
whom fuch obfervations might have been addrefledto draw their own concluiions.  
He was forry that it almoft always happened, whenever any queftion of gencral po-  
licy and advantage to the union was before the houfe, and gentlemen found them-  
{elves at a lofs for general arguments, they commonly reforted to local views; and  
at alltimes, as well asthe prefent, when there was moft occafion for members to act  
with the utmoft coolncfs, when their judgments ought to be the leaft biafled, it was  
to be regretted, that at thofe times they fuffered their feelings, paflions, and, preju-  
€ices to govern their reafon. ‘Thus it is, that the moft important points are cmbar-  
rafled, the northern and fouthern intercis are held up, every local cireumfance  
comes into view, and every idea of liberality and candour is banifhed,  
  
The geutieman from New-York, (Mr. Lawrance,) when he introduced this fubje&amp;  
@t the commencement of the prefent fcflion, did it on the mol generous plan, and  
éifavowed every principle of ca&#x27;culation fo much, that he then ae@ared he had not  
4» muchas made a fing&#x27;e calcu ation of the diflerent fraétions which have fince been  
introduced imto the debate. His only objeét wasto fixa rule on general principles,  
agreeably to the conflitution and to the prefervation of the rights of the people;  
aud this idea was approved by two of the gentlemen from New-Jerfey, who have  
diuce altered their opimions, although they then had no objedtions, but as to the ex-  
penfe: the idea of fraQions was net then contended for, but has fince become the  
very efience of the oppolition ; and we are called on to violate the conftitution, by  
adopting a meafure that will give reprefentatives for thofe feparate and diftinét frac-  
tions in the refpective flates ; and afterwards are told it isnot to the fra@ional num-  
bers in the flates that they reter, but to Uie aggregate of the fradlions in the united  
flates. If this reaiuning is good, why dw the gentlemen flop at this boundary of a
