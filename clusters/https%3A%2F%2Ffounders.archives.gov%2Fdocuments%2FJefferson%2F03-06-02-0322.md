r Monticello August 13. 13.  
Your letter of Aug. 3. asking information on the subject of mr Oliver Evans’s exclusive right to the use of what he calls his Elevators, Conveyers, and Hopper-boys, has been duly recieved. my wish to see new inventions encouraged, and old ones brought again into  
			 useful notice, has made me regret the circumstances which have followed the expiration of his first patent.  
			 I did not expect the retrospection which has been given to the reviving law. for altho’  
			 the 2d Proviso seemed not so clear as it ought to have been, yet it appeared susceptible of a just construction; and the retrospective one being contrary to natural right, it was understood to be  
			 a rule of law that where the words of a statute admit of two constructions, the one just and the other unjust, the former is to be given them. the 1st Proviso takes care of those who had lawfully used Evans’s improvements under the 1st patent; the 2d was meant for those who had lawfully erected and used them after that patent expired, declaring they ‘should not be liable to damages therefor.’ these words may indeed be restrained to uses  
			 already past; but as there is parity of reason for those to come, there should be parity of law. every man should be protected in his lawful acts, and be certain that no ex post facto law shall  
			 punish or endamage him for them. but he is endamaged, if forbidden to use a machine lawfully erected, at considerable expence, unless he will pay a new and unexpected price for it. the proviso says he shall not that he who erected and uses used lawfully shall not be liable to pay damages. but if the Proviso had been omitted, would not the law, construed by natural equity, have said the same thing. in truth both Provisos are  
			 useless.  
			 and shall useless provisos inserted pro majori cautelâ only, authorise inferences against justice? the sentiment that ex post facto laws are against natural right is so strong in the United States, that few, if any, of the State  
			 constitutions have failed to proscribe them. the federal constitution indeed interdicts them in criminal cases only; but they are equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases  
			 and the omission of a caution which would have been right, does not justify the doing  
			 what is wrong. nor ought it to be presumed that the legislature meant to use a phrase in an unjustifiable sense, if by any rules of construction, it can be even strained to what is just. the law  
			 books abound with similar instances of the care the judges take of the public integrity. laws moreover abridging the natural rights of the citizen, should be restrained by rigorous constructions  
			 within their narrowest limits.  
  
Your letter however points to a much broader question, Whether what have recieved from mr Evans the new and the proper name of Elevators are of his invention. because,  
			 if they are not, his patent gives him no right to obstruct others in the use of what they possessed before.I  
			 assume it as a Lemma that it is the invention of the machine itself which is to give a patent right, and not the application of it to any particular purpose of which it is susceptible. if one  
			 person  
			 invents a knife convenient for pointing our pens, another cannot have a patent right for the same knife to point our pencils. a Compass was invented for navigating the sea; another could not have  
			 a  
			 patent right for using it to survey land. a machine for threshing wheat has been invented in Scotland. a se2d person cannot get a patent right for the same machine to thresh oats, a 3drye, a 4thpeas, a 5thclover Etc. a string of buckets is invented &amp; used for raising water, ore Etc can a 2d have a patent right to the same machine for raising wheat, a 3d oats, a 4th rye, a 5th peas Etc?the question then whether such a string of buckets was invented  
			 first by Oliver Evans, is a meer question of fact in Mathematical history.now turning to such books only as I happen to possess, I find abundant proof that this  
			 simple machinery has been in use from  
			 time immemorial. Doctr Shaw, who visited Egypt &amp; the Barbary coast in the years 1727. 8. 9. in the margin of his map of Egypt, gives us the figure of what he calls a Persian wheel, which is a string of round cups or buckets, hanging on a pully, over which they revolve, bringing up water from a well, and delivering  
			 it into a trough above. he found this used at Cairo, in a well 264.f. deep, which the inhabitants believe to have been a work of the patriarch Joseph.Shaw’s travels. 341. Oxford edition of 1738. in folio. and the  
			 Universal history I. 416. speaking of the manner of watering the higher lands in Egypt, says ‘formerly they made use of Archimedes’s screw,  
			 thence named the Egyptian pump; but they now generally use wheels (wallowers) which carry a rope or chain of earthen pots, holding about 7. or 8. quarts apiece, and draw the water from the  
			 canals.  
			 there are besides a vast number of wells in Egypt, from which the water is drawn in the same manner to water the gardens &amp; fruit trees; so that it is no exaggeration to say, that there are in  
			 Egypt above 200,000. oxen daily employed in this labour.’Shaw’s name of Persian wheel has been since given more particularly to a wheel with buckets, either fixed, or suspended on  
			 pins, at it’s  
			 periphery. Mortimer’s husbandry I. 18.Duhamel III. 11.Ferguson’s Mechanics plate XIII. but thehis figure, and the verbal description of the  
			 Universal history prove that the string of buckets is meant under that name.his figure differs from Evans’s construction in the circumstances of the buckets being round, and strung thro’ their bottom on a chain.but it is the principle, to wit a string of buckets, which constitutes the  
			 invention, not the form of the buckets, round, square, or hexagon; nor the manner of attaching them, nor the material of the connecting band, whether chain, rope, or leather.VitruviusL.X. c. 9.  
			 describes this machinery as a Windlas, on which is a chain descending to the water, with vessels of copper attached to it; the windlas being turned, the chain moving on it will raise the vessels  
			 which, in passing over the windlas, will empty the water they have brought up into a reservoir. and  
			 Perrault, in his edition of Vitruvius. Paris 1684. fol. Plates 61. 62. gives us three forms of these water elevators, in one of which the buckets are square, as mr Evans’s are.Bossut Histoire des Mathematiques I. 86. says ‘the drum wheel, the wheel with buckets &amp; the Chapelets, are hydraulic machines which come to us from the antients. but we are ignorant of the time when they began to be put into use.’ the Chapelets are the revolving band of buckets which Shaw calls the Persian wheel, the moderns a Chainpump, and mr Evans Elevators.the next of my books in which I find  
			 these Elevators is Wolf’sCours de Mathematiques I. 370. &amp; Pl. 1. Paris 1747. 8vo. here are two forms. in one of them the buckets are square, attached to two chains, passing over a cylinder or wallower at top, &amp; under another at bottom, by which they are made to  
			 revolve. it is a nearly exact representation of Evans’s elevators.but a more exact one is to be seen in Desagulier’s Experiml Philosophy II. Plate. 34.in the Encyclopedie de Diderot et D’alembert 8vo edn of Lausanne, 1’st vol. of Plates, in the 4. subscribed Hydraulique. Noria, is one where round earthen pots are tied by their collars, between two endless ropes suspended on a revolving lanthern or wallower.  
			 this is said to have been used for raising ore out of a mine.in a book which I do not possess, ‘L’architecture Hidraulique de Belidor, the IId vol. of which is said [De la Lande’s continuation of Montucla’s Histoire des Mathematiques III. 711.] to contain a detail of all the pumps, antient and modern, hydraulic machines,  
			 fountains, wells Etc. I have no doubt this Persian  
			 wheel, chain-pump, Chapelets, Elevators, by whichever name you chuse to call it, will be found in various forms.the last book I have to quote for it is  
			 Prony’s Architecture Hydraulique I. Avertissement vii. and §. 648. 649. 650. in the latter of which passages he observes that the 1st idea which occurs for raising water is to lift it in a bucket by hand. when the water lies too deep to be reached by hand, the bucket is suspended by a chain, and let down over a pulley or  
			 windlass. if it be desired to raise a continued stream of water, the simplest means which offers itself to the mind is to attach to an endless chain or cord a number of pots or buckets, so disposed that, the chain being suspended on a lanthern or wallower above, and plunged in water below, the buckets may descend and  
			 ascend alternately, filling themselves at bottom, and emptying at a certain height above, so as to give a constant stream.some years before the date of mr Evans’s patent, a mr Martin of Caroline county in this state, constructed a drill-plough, in which he used the band of buckets for elevating the grain from the box into the funnel, which let them down into the furrow. he had bands with  
			 different sets of buckets adapted to the size of peas, of turnep seed Etc. I have used this machine for sowing Benni seed, also, and propose to have a band of buckets for drilling Indian corn, and another for wheat.  
			 is it possible that in doing this I shall  
			 infringe mr  Evans’s patent? that I can be debarred of any use to which I might have applied my drill, when I bought it, by a patent issued after I bought it?  
These verbal descriptions, applying so exactly to mr Evans’s elevators, and the drawings exhibited to the eye; flash conviction both on reason and the senses, that there is nothing new in these elevators but their being strung together on a strap  
			 of leather. if this strap of leather be an invention, entitling the inventor to a patent right, it can only extend to the strap, and the use of the string of buckets must remain free to be  
			 connected  
			 by chains, ropes, a strap of hempen girthing, or any other substance, except leather. but indeed mr Martin had before used the strap of leather.  
The Screw of Archimedes is as antient, at least, as the age of that Mathematician, who died more than 2000. years ago.  
			 Diodorus Siculus speaks of it L. I. pa. 21. and L. V. pa. 217. of Stevens’s edition of 1559. folio. and  
			 Vitruvius X. 11. the cutting of it’s spiral worm into sections for conveying flour or grain, seems to have been an invention of mr Evans, &amp; to be a fair subject of a patent right. but it cannot take away from others the use of Archimedes’s screw, with it’s perpetual spiral, for any purposes of which it is susceptible.  
The Hopper-boy is an useful machine; &amp;, as far as I know, original.  
It has been pretended by some (and in England especially) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions; &amp; not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. but while it is a moot question  
			 whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural, and even an hereditary right to inventions. it is agreed by those who have  
			 seriously  
			 considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance. by an universal law indeed, whatever, whether fixed or  
			 moveable, belongs to  
			 all  
			 men equally and in common, is the property, for the moment, of him who occupies it; but when he relinquishes the occupation the property goes with it. stable ownership is the gift of social law,  
			 and  
			 is given late in the progress of society. it would be curious then if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable  
			 property.  
			 if nature has made any one thing less susceptible, than all others, of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an Idea; which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one,  
			 and the reciever cannot dispossess himself of it. it’s peculiar character too is that that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. he who recieves an idea from me, recieves instruction himself, without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper  
			 at mine, recieves light without darkening me. that ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition,  
			 seems  
			 to have been peculiarly and benvolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point; and like the air in which we  
			 breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement, or exclusive appropriation. inventions then cannot in nature be a subject of property. society may give an exclusive right to  
			 the  
			 profits arising from it them as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility. but this may, or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from  
			 any body. accordingly it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. in some other countries, it is sometimes done, in a great  
			 case, and by a special &amp;  permanent personal act. but generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrasment than advantage to society. and  
			 it may be observed that the nations which refuse  
			 monopolies of invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.  
Considering the exclusive right to invention as given not of natural right, but for the benefit of society, I know well the difficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrasment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not. as a member of the Patent-board for several years, while the law authorised a board to grant or refuse patents, I saw with what slow progress a system of general rules could be matured. some however were established by that board. one of these was, that a machine, of which we were possessed, might be applied by every man to any use of which it is susceptible, and that this right ought not to be taken from him, and given to a monopolist, because he first perhaps had occasion so to apply it. thus a Screw for crushing plaister might be employed for crushing corn-cobs. and a Chain-pump for raising water might be used for raising wheat: this being merely a change of application. Another rule was that a change of material is not a should not give title to a patent. as the making a ploughshare of cast rather than of wrought iron; a Comb of iron, instead of horn, or of ivory. or the connecting buckets by a band of leather, rather than of hemp or iron. a third was that a mere change of form gave should give no right to a patent. as a high quartered shoe, instead of a low one. a round hat, instead of a three square. or a square bucket instead of a round one. but for this rule, all the changes of fashion in dress would have been under the tax of patentees.these were among the rules which the uniform decisions of the board had already established; and under each of them mr Evans’s patent would have been refused. 1. because it was a mere change of application of the chain pump, from raising water to raise wheat. 2. because the using a leathern, instead of a hempen  
			 band, was a mere change of material: and 3ly square buckets instead of round are only a change of form; and the antient forms too appear to have been indifferently square or round. but there were still abundance of cases which could  
			 not be brought under rule, until they should have presented themselves under all their aspects; and these investigations occupying more time of the members of the board than they could spare from  
			 higher duties, the whole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into a system, under which  
			 everyone might know when their his actions were safe and lawful. instead of refusing a patent in the first instance, as the board was authorised to do, the patent now issues of course, subject to be declared void on such  
			 principles as should be g established by the courts of law. this business however is but little analogous to their course of reading, since we might in vain turn over all the lubberly volumes of the law to find a  
			 single ray which would lighten the path of the Mechanic or Mathematician. it is more within the information of a board of Academical professors, and a previous refusal of patent would better  
			 guard  
			 our citizens against harrassment by lawsuits. but England had given it to her judges, and the usual predominancy of her examples carried it to ours.  
It happened that I had myself a mill built, in the interval between mr Evans’s 1st and 2d patents. I was living in Washington, and left the construction of the mill entirely to the mill wright. I did not even know he had erected elevators, conveyers, and hopper-boys, until I learnt it by an application from mr Evans’s agent for the patent price. altho’ I had no idea he had a right to it by law (for no judicial decision had then been given) yet I did not hesitate to remit to mr Evans the old and moderate patent price, which was what he then asked, from a wish to encourage even the useful revival of antient inventions. but I then expressed my opinion of the law in a letter either to mr Evans, or to his agent.  
I have thus, Sir, at your request, given you the facts &amp; ideas which occur to me on this subject. I have done it without reserve, altho’ I have not the pleasure of knowing you personally. in thus frankly committing myself to you, I trust you will feel it as a point of honor &amp; candor, to make no use of my letter which might bring disquietude on myself. and particularly I should be unwilling to be brought into any difference with mr Evans whom however I believe too reasonable to take offence at an honest difference of opinion. I esteem him much, and sincerely wish him wealth &amp; honor. I deem him a valuable citizen, of  
			 uncommon ingenuity &amp; usefulness. and had I not esteemed still more the establishment of sound principles, I should now have been silent. if any of the matter I have offered can promote that  
			 object, I have no objection to it’s being so used. if it offers nothing new, it will of course not be used at all. I have gone with some minuteness into the Mathematical history of the Elevator,  
			 because it belongs to a branch of science, in which, as I have before observed, it is not incumbent on lawyers to be learned; and it is possible therefore that some of the proofs I have quoted  
			 may  
			 have escaped on their former arguments. on the law of the case subject I should not have touched, because more familiar to those who have already discussed it; but I wished to state my own view of it merely in justification of myself; my name and approbation being subscribed to the act. with these explanations accept the assurance of my respect.

Monticelloy August XZthf 1813.  
  
&#x27; Sir,  
  
A  
  
Your letter of August 3d, asking information on the subject of  
-Mr. Oliver Evans’s exclusive right to the use of what he calls his  
Elevators, Conveyers and Hopperboys, has been duly received.  
My wish to see new inventions encouraged, and old ones brought  
again into useful notice, has made me regret the circumstances  
which have followed the expiration of his first patent. I did not  
expect the retrospection w’hich has been given to the reviving law;  
for although the second proviso seemed not so clear as it ought to  
&#x27; have been, yet it appeared susceptible of a just construction; and  
the retrospective one being contrary to natural right, it was under¬  
stood to be a rule of law, that where tlic words of a statute admit  
of two constructions, the one just and the other unjust, the former  
is to be given them. The first proviso takes care of those who  
had lawfully used Evans’ improvements under the first patent;  
the second was meant for those who had lawfully erected and used  
them after that patent expired, declaring they “ should not be lia¬  
ble to damages thft*efor.” These words may indeed be restrain¬  
ed to uses already past; but as there is parity of reason for those  
to come, there should be parity of law. Evciy man should be  
protected in his lawful acts, and be certain that no ex post facto  
law shall punish or endamage him for them. But he iS endamaged  
if forbidden to use a machine lawfully erected at considerable ex¬  
pense, unless he will pay a new and unexpected price fo^ it. The  
proviso says, that he who erected and used lawfully shall not be  
liable to pay damages: but if the proviso had been omitted would  
not the law, construed by natural equity, have said the same thing ?  
In truth both provisos are useless. And shall useless provisos,  
inserted pro majori cautcla, only authorise inferences against jus¬  
tice ? The sentiment that ex post facto laws are against natural  
rights is so strong in the United States, that few, if any, of the  
stltp constitutions have failed to proscribe them. The federal con -  
  
Patents.  
  
447  
  
sdtution indeed interdicts them in criminal cases only; but they  
ure equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases: and the omission  
of a caution which would have been right, docs not justify the do¬  
ing what is wrong ; nor ought it to be presumed, that the legisla¬  
ture meant to use a phrase in an unjustifiable sense, if by any rules  
of construction it can be even strained to what is just. The law  
books abound with similar instances of the care the judges take of  
the public integrity. Laws moreover abridging the natural rights  
of the citizen, should be restrained by rigorous constructions with¬  
in their narrowest limits.  
  
Your letter, however, points to a much broader question, whe¬  
ther what have received from Mr. Evans the new and the proper  
name of Elevators are of his invention ; because, if they are not^  
his patent gives him no right to obstruct others in the use of what  
they possessed before. I assume it as a lemma, that it is the inven¬  
tion of the machine itself which is to give a patent right, and not  
the application of it to any particular purpose of which it is suscep¬  
tible. If one person invents a knife convenient for pointing our  
pens, another cannot have a patent right for the same knife to point  
our pencils. A compass was invented for navigating the sea;  
another could not have a patent right for using it to survey land.  
A machine for threshing wheat has been invented in Scotland ; a ,  
second person cannot get a patent right for the same machine to  
thresh oata ; a third rye ; a fourth fieaa ; a fifth clover^ &amp;c. A string  
of buckets is invented and used for raising water, ore, &amp;c. can a  
second have a patent right to the same machine for raising wheat,  
a third oats, a fourth rye, a fifth peas, &amp;c. ? The question then  
whether such a string of buckets was invented first by Oliver Ev’uns,  
is a mere question of fact in mathematical history. Now turning  
to such books only as I happen to possess, I find abundant proof that  
this simple machinery has beqn in use from time immemorial.  
Doctor Shaw, &gt;y&#x27;ho visited Egypt and the Barbary coast, in the  
years 1727—8,9, in the margin of his map of Egypt, gives us the  
figure of what he calls a Persian wheel, which is a string of round  
cups, or buckets, hanging on a pully, over which they revolve,  
bringing up water from a well, and delivering it into a trough  
above. He found this used at Cairo, in a well 264 feet deep, which  
the inhabitants believe to have been a work of the patriarch Joseph.  
Shaw’s Travels, 341, Oxford edition of 1738, in folio, and the Uni¬  
versal History, I. 416, speaking of the manner of watering the  
liigh lands ifi Egypt, says—Formerly they, made use of Archi-

Patents.  
  
medcs* Screw, thence named the Egyptian Pump; but they now  
generally use Wheels (Wallowers) which carry a rope or chain  
of earthen pots, holding about 7 or 8 quarts a piece, and draw the  
water from the canals. There are besides, a vast number of wells  
in Egypt, fix&gt;m which the water is drawn in the same manner to  
water the gardens and fruit trees; so that it is no exaggeration to  
say, that there are in Egypt above 200,000‘oxen daily employed  
in this labour.” Shaw’s name of Persian wheel has been since giv¬  
en more particularly to a wheel with buckets, either fixed or sus¬  
pended on pins at its periphery.—Mortimer’s Husbandry,,!, 18,  
puhamel, V. Ferguson’s Mechanics, plate 13. But his figure,  
and the verbal description of the Universal History, prove, that  
the string of buckets is meant under that name. His figure dilfcrs  
from Evans* construction in the circumstances of the buckets be¬  
ing round, and strung through their bottom on a chain; but it is  
the principle; to wit, a string of buckets, which constitutes the  
invention, not the form of the buckets, round, square, or hexagon;  
nor the manner of attaching them, nor the material of the connect¬  
ing band, whether chain, rope or leather, Vitruvius, L. X. c. 9,  
describes this machinery as a windlass, on which is a chain descend¬  
ing to the water, with vessels of copper attached to it; the windlass  
being turned, the chain moving on it will raise the vessels, which  
in passing over the windlass, will empty the water they have brought  
up into a reservoir; and Pcrrault, in his edition of Vitruvius, Pa¬  
ris, 1784, folio, plates, 61, 62, gives us three forms of these w ater  
elevators, in one of which the buckets are square, as Mr. Evans*  
arc. Bossut, Histoire des Mathematiques, I. 86, says, “ The  
drum wheel, the wheel wdth buckets, and the chafieletsy arc hydrau¬  
lic machines, which come to us from the ancients ; but we arc igno¬  
rant of the time when they began to be put into use.” The cha^  
pelrtH are the revolving band of buckets, which Shaw calls the  
Persian wheel, tlie moderns a chain pump, and Mr. Evans eleva¬  
tors. The next of my books, in which I find these elevators, is  
Wolf’s Coursde Matliematiques, I. 370, and plate 1, Paris, 1747—  
8vo. Here arc two forms; in one of them the buckets arc square,  
attached to two chains, passing over a cylinder or wallowcr at top,  
and under another at bottom, by which they are made to revolve.  
It is a nearly exact representation of Evans* elevators. But a more  
exact one is to be seen in Dcsagiilicr’s Experimental Philosophy,  
II. plate 34. In the Encyclopedic de Diderot ct D’Alembert, 8vo.  
edition dc Lausanne, 1 st vql. of plates, in the four subscribed “ Hr-

draulique, noria^*’ is one, where round earthen pots are tied by their  
collai*s, between two endless ropes, suspended on a revolving Ian*  
tlicrn or wallower; this is said to have been used for raising ore  
out of a mine. In a book which I do not possess, “ L’Architec-  
ture Hydraulique de Belidor, the II vol. of which is said [De La  
Lande’s continuation of Montucla’s Histoire des Mathematiqi^s,  
  
III. 711] to contain a detail of all the pumps, ancient and modem,  
hydraulic machines, fountains, wells, &amp;c. I have no doubt this  
Persian wheel, chain pump, chapelets, elevators, by whichever  
name you choose to call it, will be found in various forms. The  
last book I have to quote for it is Proney’s Architecture Ily-  
drauliquc, I. advertisement VII. and sec’s 648, 649, in the latter  
of which passages he observes, that the first idea which occurs for  
raising water is to lift it in a bucket by hand ; when the water lies  
too deep to be reached by hand, the bucket is suspended by,a chain  
and let down over a pully or windlass; if it be desired to raise a  
continued stream of water, the simplest means which offers itself ,  
to tlic mind is to attach to an endless chain or cork a number of  
pots or buckets, so disposed that the chain being suspended on a  
lanthern or wallower above, and plunged in water below, the buck¬  
ets may descend and ascend alternately, filling themselves at bottom,  
and emptying at a certain height above, so us to give a constant  
stream. Some years before the date of Mr. Evans’ patent, a Mr.  
Martin of Caroline county, in this state, constructed a drill plough,  
in which he used the band of buckets for elevating the grain from *  
the box, into the funnel which let them down into the furrows&#x27;: he  
had bands with different setts of buckets, adapted to the size of peas,  
of turnip seed, 8cc. I have used this machine for sowing benni seed  
also, and propose to have a band of buckets for drilling Indian com,  
and another for wheat. Is it possible that in^^ing this I shall in¬  
fringe Mr. Evans* patent ? That I can be debarred of any use to  
which I might have applied my drill when I bought it, by a patent  
issued after I bought it.  
  
These verbal descriptions applying so exactly to Mr. Evans*  
Elevators, and the drawings exhibited to the eye, flash conviction  
both on reason and the senses that there is nothing new in these  
elevators but their being strung together by a strap of leather. If

strap of hempen girthing, or any other substance except leather;  
but indeed Mr. Martin had before used the strap of leather.  
  
The screw of Archimedes is as ancient at least as the age of  
that mathematician, who died more than 2000 years ago. Diodo»*  
rus Siculus speaks of it, lib. 1, page 21, and lib. 5, page 217, of  
Stevens* edition of 1559, folio, and Vitruvius, X. 11. The cutting  
of its spiral worm into sections, for conveying flour or grain, seems  
to have been an invention of Mr. Evans’, and to be a fair subject of  
a patent right, but it cannot take away from others the use of Archi¬  
medes* screw, with its perpetual spiral, for any purposes of which  
ijt is susceptible.  
  
The Hopperboy is an useful niachinc and as far as I know origi¬  
nal.  
  
It has been pretended by some (and in England especially) that  
inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions;  
and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs :  
but while it is a moot question, whether the origin of any kind of  
property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to ad¬  
mit a natural and even an hereditary right to inventions. It is  
agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that  
no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre  
of land : for instance, by an universal law, indeed, whatever, whe¬  
ther fixed or moveable, belongs to all men equally and in common,  
is the property for the moment of him who occupies it; but when  
he relinquishes the occupation the property goes with it. Stable  
ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the progress  
of society: it would be curious then if an idea, the fugitive fermen¬  
tation of an individual brain, could of natural right be claimed in  
exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing  
less suscept&#x27;vljlc thaii^l others of exclusive property, it is the ac¬  
tion of the thinking power called an idea; which an individual  
may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself, but the  
moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every  
one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar  
character too is that no one possesses the less because every other  
possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me re¬  
ceives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who  
lights his taper at mine receives light without darkening me.  
&#x27;I&#x27;hat ideas should freely spread fimn one to another over the globe  
for the moral and mutual instruction of man and improvement of  
Ills conditions, seems to have been pcculiaily and benevolently  
  
Patents*

designed by nature Avhen she made them, like fire, expansible over  
all space, without lessening their density in any point; and like  
the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being,  
incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions  
then cannot in nature be a subject of property. Society may give  
an exclusive right to the profits arising from them as an encou¬  
ragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility. But  
this may or may not be done according to the will and convenience  
of the society, without claim or complaint from any body. Ac¬  
cordingly it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was,  
until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever by a  
general law gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In  
some other countries it is sometimes done in a great case and by  
a special and personal act; but generally speaking other natipns  
have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment  
than advantage to society ; and it may be observed that the nations  
which refuse monopolies of inventions are as fruitful as England  
in new and useful devices.*  
  
Considering the exclusive right to invention as given, not of  
natural right, but for the benefit of society, I know well the diffi¬  
culty of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the  
public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent and those which  
are not. As a member of the patent board for several years,  
while the law authorised a board to grant or refuse patents, I saw  
with what slow progi’css a system of general rules could be ma¬  
tured. Some however were established by that board. One of  
these was, that a machine of w hich we w ere possessed, might be  
applied by every man to any use of w hich it is susceptible, and  
that this right ought not to be taken from him and given to a mo¬  
nopolist, because he first, perhaps, had occasion so to.apply it.  
Thus a screw for crushing plaister might be employed for crush¬  
ing corn cobs; and a chain pump for raising w&#x27;ater might be used  
for raising wheat—this being merely a change of application*  
Another rule was, that a change of material, should not give title  
to a patent; as the making a plough share of cast rather than  
wrought iron ; a comb of iron instead of horn or of ivory; or the  
connecting of buckets by a band of leather rather than of hemp  
or imn. A third w^as, that a mere change of form, should give no

right to a patent; as a high quartered shoe instead of a low on6,  
a round hat instead of a three square, or a square bucket instead  
of a round one; but for this rule, all the changes of fashion in  
dress, would have been under the lax of patentees. These were  
among the rules which the uniform decisions of the board had  
already established : and under each of them Mr. Evans* patent  
would have been refused. 1st, Because it was a mere change of  
application of the chain pump from raising water, to raise wheat.  
2d, Because the usmg a leathern instead of a hempen band, was a  
mere change of material: and Srdly, square buckets instead of  
rouiid, are only a cliangc of form; and tlie ancient forms too, ap¬  
pear to have been indifferently square or round. But there were  
still abundance of cases which could not be brought under rule,  
until they should have presented themselves under all their as¬  
pects ; and these investigations occupying more time of the mem¬  
bers of the board, than they could spare from higher duties, the  
whole wasturncu over to the judiciary, to be matured in a system  
under which every one might know when his actions were safe  
and lawful. Instead of refusing a patent in the first instance, as  
the board was authorised to do, the patent now issues of course  
subject to be declared void on such principles as should be esta¬  
blished by the courts of law&#x27;. This business however is but little  
analogous to their course of reading, since we might in vain turn  
over all the lubberly volumes of the law, to find a single ray which  
would lighten the patn of the mechanic or mathematician; it is  
more within the information of a board of academical professors,  
and a previous refusal of a patent would better guard our citizens  
against harrassment by law suits. But England had given it to  
her judges, and the usual predominancy of her examples, carried  
it to ours.  
  
It happened that I had myself a mill built in the interval be¬  
tween Mr. Evans’s first and second patents. 1 was living in Wash¬  
ington, and left the construction of the mill entirely to the mill-  
WTight. I did not even know he had erected elevators, con¬  
veyors and hopperboys, until I learnt it Ly an application, from  
Mr. Evans’s agent for’the patent price. Although I had no  
idea he had a right to it by law (for no judicial decision had  
then been given) yet I did not hesitate to remit to Mr. Evans  
the old and moderate patent price, which was what he then asked,  
from a w&#x27;isb to encourage even the useful revival of ancient inven¬  
tions. But I then expressed my opinion of the law, in a letter ci¬  
ther to Mr. Evans or to his agent.

453  
  
I have thus, sir, at your request given you the facts and ideas  
which occur to me on the subject. I have done it without reserve,  
although I have not the pleasure of knowing you personally. In  
thus fi-ankly committing myself to you, I trust you will feel it as a  
point of honour and candour to make no use of my letter, which  
might bring disquietude on myself and particularly I should be  
unwilling to be brought into any difference with Mr. Evans, whom,  
however, I believe too reasonable to take offence at an honest dif¬  
ference of opinion. I esteem him much, and sincerely wish him  
wealth and honour. I deem him a valuable citizen of uncommon  
ingenuity and usefulness; and had I not esteemed still more  
the establishment of sound principles, I should now have been  
silent. If any of the matter I have offered can promote that ob¬  
ject, I have no objection to its being so used. If it offers nothing  
new, it will of course not be used at all.  
  
I liave gone with some minuteness into the mathematical his¬  
tory of the elevator, because it belongs to a branch of science,  
in which, as I have before observed, it is not incumbent on lawyers  
to be learned; and it is possible, therefore, that some of the  
proofs I have quoted, may have escaped on their foiincr argu¬  
ments.  
  
On the law of the subject I should not have touched, because  
more familiar to those who have already discussed it, but I wish¬  
ed to state my own view of it merely in justification of myself;  
my name and approbation being subscribed to the act. With these  
explanations accept the assurances of my respect.

Monticello, August 13th, 1813.  
sin.  
Your letter of August 3d, asking  
information on the subject of Mr. O.iver  
Evans&#x27;* exclusive right to the us* of  
a hat he calls his Elevators, Conveyers  
and Hoppcrboys, has been duly received.  
M&gt; wish to *e? new inventions encou­  
rag ml, and old ones brought again into  
useful notice, has made me regret the  
circumstances which have followed the  
expiation of his first patent. I did not  
expect the retrospection which has been  
given to the &#x27; -viving law; for although  
the second proviso seemed not so clear  
as it ought to have been, yrt it appeared  
susceptible of a just construction; and  
the retrospective one bring contrary to  
natural right, it was understood to be a  
rule- of law, that where the words of a  
statute admit of two const i uctions, the  
one just and the other u.just, the lor  
incr is to be Riven them. I&#x27;m first pro  
viso takes care uf tl&gt;o&gt;&lt; ? ho had law fu.­  
ly used Evans&#x27; impiovcments under he  
first patent; the second was mi ant fur  
those who lisd lawfully erected and us­  
ed mem alter thai patent ? xpired, de­  
claring they &quot;should not be liabu to I  
damages therefor/&#x27; Th se worus n a&gt;  
indeed be restrained to uses alieady past;  
but as there is parity 01 reason for those  
to come, there shouio be painy ol law.  
Every man shoul . be protected in his  
lawful a&lt; ts, and be certain that no ex post  
tacio law shall punish or endamage nim  
for them. But he is endamaged if foi ?  
bidden to use a machue lawlully erect­  
ed at considerable expense, unless hr.  
will pay a new and umxpectid price  
lor it. The proviso &amp;ay?&gt;, that he who  
erected and used lawfully shall noi be  
liable to pay damages: but if the provi­  
so had been omitted, would not the law,  
ccnsiiued by natuial equity, have said  
the same thing? In trutn, both prov.sos  
are useless. And shall useless provisos,  
inserted pro majori cautcla- only autho­  
rise inferences against justice? The  
sentiment that ex p?JSt facto laws are  
against natural light is so strong in the  
United States, that few, if any, of the  
state c&lt; nsiitutions have failed to pro­  
scribe them. The federal constitution  
indeed interdicts thi m in criminal cases;  
and the omissioi? of a caution which  
would have been r?&gt;;ht dors not justify  
the doing what is wion^; no: ou^lu it to  
be presumed, lhat the legislature meant  
to use a phrase in in unjustifiable sense,  
if by any rulrs of construction it can be  
even strained to what is just. The law  
books abound with si** ilar instances of  
the public integrity. Laws moreover  
abridging the nam*, a! ri^nts of the citi­  
zen should be restrait rd by rigorous  
constructions within their narrowest  
limit*.  
  
Your letter, howevtr, points to a much  
broader question, whe her what have  
received !rom Mr. Evans the new ana  
the proper name of Elevators aieof his  
invention: b( cause, if they are not, his  
patent Rives him no right to obstruct  
others in tr.e use of what they possess: d  
before/ I assume it as a lemma, that it  
is the invention cf the &#x27; machine itseli  
which is to give a patent right. and not  
i he application of it to any particular  
purpose of which it is susceptible. If  
one person invents a knife convenient for  
pointing our pens, another cannot have  
a patent ri.f.t for the same knife to point  
our pencils. A compass was invented  
for navigating the sea; mother could  
not have a paent right for using it to  
survey land. A machine for threshing  
wheat &#x27;&#x27;as heen invented in Scotland; a  
second person cannot get a patent right  
for the same machine to thresh oar#; a  
third ryr; a fourth firas; a fifth r/ovrr,  
See. A string of buckets is invented and  
used lor raising water, ore, See. can a se­  
cond have a patent right to the same  
machine for raising wheat, a third oats,  
a fourth rye, a fifth peas, 8tc.? The ques­  
tion then whether such a string of buck  
ets was first inv nted by Oliver Evans,  
is a mere question of fact in maihema*  
tical his&#x27;ory. Now turning to such hooks  
only as I happen to possess, I find abun­  
dant proof that this simple inarhinery  
l&gt;as been in use from time immemot ial.  
Dor.toi Shaw, who visited Egypt and  
the Barbary coast, in the years 1727-8,9,  
in the margin of his map of Egypt,  
gives us the figure of what he call* a  
Persian wheel, which is a string oi round  
cup, or buckets, hanging on a pulley,  
over which they revolve, bringing up  
water from a well, and delivering it into  
a trough above, lie found this used at  
Cairo, in a well 264 feet deep, which  
the inhabitants believe to have been a  
work of the patriarch Joseph. Shaws  
travels, 3*1 Oxford edition of 1738, in  
folio, and the Universal History, 1. 416  
speaking of the mmncr of watering the  
high lands in Egy?t, says?&quot; Formerly  
they made use ol ArchimedcH* Screw,  
thence named the Egyptian Pump; but  
they now gcncrnllf use Wheels (VVal­  
lowers) which cany a rope or chain ol  
e.arthen pots, hiding about 7 or 8  
quarts a piece, ami draw the water from  
the canal*. Thert arc besides, a vast  
t  
  
number of wells in Egypt, from which  
the water is drawn in ihe same mannei  
to water the ga&lt;d&lt; ns and fruit trees; sc  
that ii is no exaggeration to say, that there  
are in Egypi above 200, OOO oxen daily  
employed in this lalwur.&quot; Suaw&#x27;s name  
ofPeisun wheel has since been given  
more particularly to a wheel with buck­  
ets, either fixed or suspended on pins at  
its periphery.? Mortimer&#x27;s Husbandry,  
I. 18, Duhamel, V. Fercusoi.&#x27;s Mecha­  
nics, plate 13. But his figure, and the  
verbal description of the Universal His­  
toiy, prove that the string of buckets is  
mrant under that name. His figure dif­  
fers from Lynns&#x27; construction in the cir­  
cumstanccs of the buckets being round,  
and strung through their bottom oi. a  
ciiam; but it is th. principle; to wit, a  
string of buckets, which constitutes tk.e  
inven ion, not the form of the buckets,  
round, t-quarr oi hexagon; not&quot; the man­  
lier of attaching them, nor the material  
of the connectiim hand, whethei i hai&#x27;i,  
rope or lea her. Vitruvius, L. X.c. 9.  
de-c&gt;i&gt;es this machinery as a wuidLss,

Siting on it wjIi rai^e the vessels, which,

V&#x27;ii uvius, Pari-., 1684, folio, plates, 61,

elevators, tn &quot;ne o&#x27; whi&#x27;h the bu? kt is

?* The dium wheel, the wheel with hue­  
kets, ,.nd the ehufirlett , are hydr.ultc  
machines, which come to us from the  
ancients; hut we are ignorant of the time  
when they be^an to be put into use.&quot;  
The chafitleta are the revolving band of  
buckets, uhicii SI. aw calls the Persian  
wheel, the moderns a chain pump,  
and Mi. Evans elevators. The next of  
my books, in which I find these eleva­  
tors, is Woli&#x27;s Coursde Mathcinatiqucs,  
I. 370, and plate I, Paris, 1747 ? 8vo.  
Here are two forms; in one of them the  
buckets art squar? , attached to two  
chains, passing over a cylinder ;r wal­  
lower at top, &lt;nd under another at bot­  
tom, by wnicntuey ate mad. to revolve.  
It is a nearly exact representation of  
Evans* elevators. But a more exact one  
is to be seen in Dcaagulicr&#x27;s Experi­  
mental Philosophy, II. plate 34. In the  
Encyclopedia de Diderot et D&#x27;Aiembert  
8 vo. edition de Lausanne, 1st. vol. of  
piates, in the four subscribed Ilydrau­  
liquc, noria, is one, where round cai th­  
en p&quot;ts at e tied by their collars, be­  
tween two endless ropes, suspended on  
a revolving lanthern or waliower; this is  
said to have been used for raising ore  
out ol a mine. In a book which I do not  
possess, &quot; L&#x27;Architecture Hydraulique

fountains, wells, Stc. 1 nave no doubt  
this Persian wheel, chain pump, chape­  
lets, elevators, by whichever name you  
choose to c.ill it, will be found in various  
forms. The last book I have to quote  
for it is Proney&#x27;s Architecture llydrau­  
licjue, I. advcit scineiit VII. af.fi ?643,  
649,-659, in the latter ol which para­  
ges he observes, that the first idea which  
occurs lor raising water is to lift it in a  
bucket by hand; when the water lies toe  
deep to be rcachcd by hand, the bucket  
is suspended by a chain and let down  
over a pully ot windlass: if it be desired  
to rai?e a continued stream of water, the  
simplest means which offers itscll to the  
mind is to attach to an endless chain or  
cord a number of pots or buckets, sc  
disposed that the chain being suspended  
on a lanthern or wallower above, and  
plungrd in water brow, IjC buckets  
may descend and ascend alternately,  
filling themselves at bottom, and empty­  
ing at a certain height above, so as tc  
give a constant stream. Some years be­  
fore the date of Mr. Evans&#x27; patent, a  
Mr. Martrn of Caroline county, in this  
state, constructed a drill p&#x27;ough, in  
which he used the band ol buckets foi  
elevating the grain Irom the box into  
the tunnel which let them down into the  
furrows: he had bands with different  
setts ol buckets, adapted to the size ol  
peas, or turnip seed, Sec. 1 have used  
this machine for sowing benni seed also  
and propose to have a band of buckets  
for drilling Indian corn, and another for  
wheat. Is it possible that in doing this  
I shall infringe Mr. Evans&#x27; patent? That  
I can be debarred of any use to which 1  
might have applied my drill when 1  
bought it by a patent issued after 1  
bought it.  
These verbal descriptions applying st  
exactly to Mr. Evans* Elevators, am  
the drawings exnibiten to the eye, flasl  
conviction both on reason and the sensei  
that there is nothing new in thene &lt; le  
vators but their being strung togctht i  
by a strap ol leather. If tins strap o  
leather be an invention entitling the in  
ventor to a patent rigi.t, it can only ?x  
tend to the strap, and the use of tin  
string of bucket* must remain free to b&lt;  
  
_  
connrcted by chains, ropes, a strap ? f  
licmpcn girthing, or any other substance  
except leather; but indeed Mi*. Martin  
has before used the strap of leather.  
The screw of Archimedes is as an­  
cient at least as the age of that mathe­  
matician, who &lt;tird more than 2000  
years ago. Diodorus Siculus speaks of  
it, lih. 1, page 21, and lib. 5, page 217,  
of Stevens* edition of 1559, folio, and  
Vitruvius, X. !!. The cutting of it*  
spiral worm into sections, for conveying  
flour or grain, se?-ms to have been en  
invention of Mr. Evans*, and to be a fair  
subject of a patent ri^ht, but it cannct  
take jway from others the use of Ar­  
chimedes* screw, with its perpetual spi­  
ral, for any put ^o^es of which it is sus­  
ceptible.  
  
The Hoppe rbojr is an useful machine  
and as far a? I know original.  
It has been pretended by some (?rd  
in Knjrland especially) that inventors  
have a natural and exclusive right to  
their invci tions; and not merely for  
their own lives, but inheritable to then  
he irs: but wuile it is a moot question*  
whether the origin of any kind of pro­  
perty is derived from nature at all, it  
would be singular to admit a natural,  
and tven a hereditary right to inven­  
tions. It is agreed by thotc who have se­  
liuuslv considered the subject, that no  
individual has, of natural right, a sepa­  
rate prope-.ty in an acre of land: for in­  
stance, by an universal law, indeed,  
whatever, whether fixed cr moveable,  
belongs to all men equally and in com­  
mon, is ihe property for the moment of  
him who occupies it;&#x27; but when he le­  
linquishes the occupation the proper y  
goes with it. Stable ownership is the  
gift of social law, and is given late in the  
P&#x27;ogress of society: it would be curious  
then if an idea the fugitive fermentation  
of an individual brain, could of natural  
right be c aimed in exclusive and stab.e  
property, if nature has made ^ ^  
thing less susceptible than all others of  
exclusive property, it is the action of the  
thinking power called an idea; which  
an individual may exclusively posses*  
a* long as he keeps it to himself, but  
&gt;e moment it is divulged it forces itself  
nto the possession of every one, and the  
receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.  
Its peculiar character too is that no one  
possesses the less because every other  
possrs.es the whole of it. He who re­  
ceives an idea from me receives instruc­  
tion himself Without lessening mine; as  
he who lights his taper at mine receives  
hght without darkening me. That ideas  
should freely spread from one t , ano­  
ther over the globe for the moral and  
mutual instruction of man, and improve­  
ment of his condition seems to have  
been peculiarly and benevolently de­  
signed by nature when she made them,  
like fire, expansible over all space, with.  
rtS&lt;r V&quot;* -he.ir t,rn,i&#x27;3r *n any point;  
and like the air in which we breathe  
^&#x27;r HaVc ?Ur Phy4ical &#x27;&#x27;eing, in­  
capable of confinement or exclusive ap­  
propriation. Inventions then cannot in  
nature bo a subject of property. Society  
may give an exclusive right to the pro­  
fiis arising from them as an encourage­  
ment to men to pursue ideas which m .y  
produce utility. But this may or may  
not be done according to the will and  
convenience of the society, withoilt  
claim or complaint from any body. Ac­  
cordingly it is a fact, as far r.a I am in­  
formed, that Lngland was, until we co­  
pied her, the only countiy on earth  
which ever by a general law &lt;?ave a le­  
gal right to the exclusive use of an idea  
In some other countries it is sometimes  
done in a great case and by a special and  
personal act; but generally speaking  
other nations have thought that these  
monopolies produce more embarrass­  
ment than advantage to society; and it  
may be observed that the nations which  
refuse monopolies of inventions are as  
fruitful as England in new and useful  
devices.  
Considering the exclusive right to in­  
tention as given, not of natural riirht.  
i. society, I know  
well the difficulty of drawing a line be­  
tween th&quot; things which are worth to the  
public the embarrassment of an exclu­  
sive patent and those which are not. As  
a member of the patent board for Seve­  
ral years, while the law authorised a  
board to grant or refuse patents, I saw  
with what slow progress a system of  
neral rules couid be matured. S &gt;me  
however were established by that board.  
?One of these was that a machine of  
which we were possessed, might be ap­  
plied hy every man to any use of which  
it is susceptible, and that this riKht ought  
not i0 be taken from him and given to a  
monopolist, because he first perhaps had  
occasion to apply it. Thy* a ?rraw for  
crushing pliwsier might He employed for  
crushing corn cobs, and a chain pump  
tor raising water miifht be used for rais­  
ing wheat? this bring merely a change  
ot application. Another rule was that a  
change of material should not give title

Monticetto, Aug. 13th, 1813.  
  
Your letter of August 3d, asking information on the subject of Mr. Oliver  
Evan’s exclusive right to the use of what he calls his Elevators, Conveyers  
and Hopperboys, has been duly received. My wish to see new inventions  
encouraged, and old ones brought again into useful notice, has made me re-  
gret the circumstances which have followed the expiration of his first pa-  
tent. I did not expect the retrospection which has been given to the reviv-  
ing law; for although the second proviso seemed not so clear as it ought to  
have been, yetit appeared susceptible of a just construction; and the retros-  
pective one being contrary to natural right, it was understood to be a rule of  
law, that where the words of a statute admit of two constructions, the one  
just and the other unjust, the former is to be given them, The first proviso  
takes care of those who had lawfully used Evans’ improvements under the  
first patent; the second was meant for those who had lawfully erected and  
used them after that patent expired, declaring they “should not be liable to  
damages therefor.” ‘hese words may indeed be restrained to uses already  
past; but as there is parity of reason for those to come, there should be pari-  
ty of law. Every man should be protected in his lawful acts, and be cer-  
tain that no ex post facto law shall punish or endamage him for them. But  
he is endamaged if forbidden to use a machine lawfully erected at considera-  
ble expense, unless he will pay a new and unexpected price forit. The  
proviso says: that he who erected and used lawfully shall not be liable to pay  
damages; but if the proviso had been omitted would not the law, construed  
by natural equity, have said the same thing? In truth both provisos are  
useless, And shall useless provisos, inserted pro majori cautela, only au-  
thorize inferences against justice? The sentiment that ex post facto laws  
are against natural rights is so strong in the United States, that few,  
if any, of the State Constitutions have failed to proscribe them. The  
Federal constitution indeed interdicts them in criminal cases only ; but they  
are equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases: and the omission of a cau-  
tion which would have been right, does not justify the doing what is wrong;  
nor ought it to be presumed, that the legislature meant to use a phrase in  
an unjustifiable sense, ifby any rules of construction it can be even strained  
to what is just, The law books abound with similar instances of the care  
the judges take of the public integrity. Laws moreover abridging the nat-  
ural rights of the citizen, should be restrained by rigorous constructions  
within their narrowest limits.  
  
Your letter, however, points to a much broader question, whether what  
have received from Mr. Evans the new and the proper name of Elevators  
are of his invention: because, if they are not, his patent gives him no right  
to obstruct others in the use of what they possessed before. I assume it as  
a lemma, that itis the invention of the machine itself which is to give a pa-  
tent right, and not the application of it to any particular purpose ef which  
itis susceptible. If one person invents a knife convenient for pointing our  
pens, another cannot have a patent right for the same knife to point our  
pencils, A compass was invented for navigating the sea; another cannot have  
a patent right for using it to survey land. A machine for thrashing wheat

has been invented in Scotland; a second person cannot get a patent right for  
the same machine to thrash oats; a third rye; a fourth peas; a filth clover,  
&amp;c. Astring of buckets is invented and used for raising water, ore, Kc.,  
can a second have a patent right to the same machine for raising wheat, a  
third oats, a fourth rye, a fifth peas, &amp;c.? The question then whether such  
a string of buckets was invented first by Oliver Evans, is a mere question  
of fact in mathematical history. Now turning to such books only as | hap-  
pen to possess, | find abundant proof that this simple machinery has been in  
use from time immemorial. Doctor Shaw, who visited Egypt and the Bar-  
bary coast in the years 1727—8, 9, in the margin of his map of Egypt,  
gives us the figure of what he calls a Persian wheel, which is a string ot  
round cups, or buckets, hanging on a pully, over which they revolve, bring  
ing up water froma well, and delivering it into atrough above. He found  
this used at Cairo, ina well 264 feet deep, which the inhabitants believe to  
have been a work of the patriarch Joseph. Shaw’s Travels, 341, Oxtord  
edition of 1738, in folio, and the Universal History, I, 416, speaking of the  
manner of watering the high lands in Egypt, says—**Formerly they made  
use of Archimedes’ Screw, ‘thence named the Egyptian Pump; but they now  
generally use Wheels (Wallowers) which carry a rope or chain of earthen  
pots, holding about 7 or 8 quarts a piece, and draw the water from the ca-  
nals, There are besides, a vast number of wells in Egypt, from which the  
water is drawn in the same manner to water the gardens and fruit-trees; so  
that it is no exaggeration to say, that there are in Egypt above 200,000 oxen  
daily employed in this labour.” Shaw’s name of Persian wheel has been  
since given more particularly to a wheel with buckets, either fixed or sus-  
pended on pins at its periphery. Mortimer’s Husbandry, 1, 18, Duhamel,  
V. Ferguson’s Mechanics, plate 13. But his figure, and the verbal descrip-  
tion of the Universal History, prove, that the string of buckets is meant un-  
der that name. His figure ditfers from Evans’ construction in the circum-  
stance of the buckets being round, and strung through their bottom on a  
chain; but it is the principle; to wit, a string of buckets, which constitutes  
the invention, not the form of the buckets, round, square, or hexagon; nor  
the manner of attaching them, nor the material of the connecting band,  
whether chain, rope or leather. Vitruvius, L. X,c.9, describes this ma-  
chinery as a windlass, on which is a chain descending to the water with  
vessels of copper attached to it; the windlass, being turned, the chain mov-  
ing on it will raise the vessels, which, in passing over the windlass, will  
empty the water they have brought up into a reservoir: and Perault, in his  
edition of Vitruvius, Paris, 1784, folio, plates, 61, 62, gives us three forms  
of these water elevators, in one of which the buckets are square, as Mr.  
Evans’ are. Bossut, Histoire des Mathematiques, |. 86, says, **The drum  
wheel, the wheel with buckets, and the chapelets, are hydraulic machines,  
which come to us from the ancients; but we are ignorant of the time when  
they began to be put into use.” The chapelets are the revolving bands of  
buckets, which Shaw calls the Persian wheel, the moderns a chain pump,  
and Mr. Evans, elevators. The next of my books, in which | find these  
elevators, is Wolf’s Cours de Mathematiques, I. 370, and plate 1, Paris,  
1747—S8vo. Here are two forms; in one of them the buckets are square,  
attached to two chains, passing over acylinder or wallower at top, and un-  
der another at bottom, by which they are made to revolve, It is a nearly  
exact representation of Evans’ elevators. Buta more exact one is to be  
seen in Desaguliar’s Experimental Philosophy, Il, plate 34. In the Ency-

plates, in the four subscribed ‘Hydraulique, noria,” is one, where round  
earthen pots are tied by their collars, between two endless ropes, suspend-  
ed on a revolving lanthern or wallower; this is said to have been used for  
raising ore out of amine. Ina book which I do not possess, ‘+L? Architec-  
ture Hydraulique de Belidor, the II vol. of which is said [De La Lande’s  
continuation of Montucla’s Histoire des Mathematique’s, III. 711] to con-  
tain a detail of all the pumps, ancient and modern, hydraulic machines, foun-  
tains, wells, &amp;c. I have no doubt this Persian wheel, chain pump, chape-  
lets, elevators, by whichever name you choose to call it, will be found in  
various forms. ‘The last book I have to quote for it, is Prony’s Architec-  
ture Hydraulique, |. advertisement VII, and secs, 648, 649, in the latter of  
which passages he observes, that the first idea which occurs for raising  
water isto lift it in a bucket by hand; when the water lies too deep to be  
reached by hand, the bucket is suspended by a chain and let down over a  
pully or windlass; if it be desired to raise a continued stream of water, the  
simplest means which offers itself to the mind is to attach to an endless  
chain or cord a number of pots or buckets, so disposed that the chain being  
suspended on a lanthern or wallower above, and plunged into water below, the  
buckets may descend and ascend alternately, filling themselves at bottom,  
and emptying at a certain height above, so as to give a constant stream.—  
Some years before the date of Mr. Evans’ patent, a Mr. Martin of Caroline  
county, in this state, constructed a drill plough, in which he used the band  
f buckets for elevating the grain from the box, into the funnel which let  
them down into the furrows: he had bands with different sets of buckets,  
dapted to the size of peas, of turnip seed, &amp;c, I have used this machine  
ior sowing benni-seed also, and propose to have a band of buckets for dril-  
ing Indian corn, and another for wheat. Is it possible that in doing this I  
shallinfringe Mr. Evans’ patent? That I can be debarred of any use to  
which I might have applied my drill when | boughbtit, by a patent issued af-  
ter | bought it?  
  
These verbal descriptions applying so exactly to Mr. Evans’ Elevators, and  
the drawings exhibited to the eye, flash conviction both on reason and the  
‘enses that there is nothing new in these elevators but their being strung  
cogether by a strap of leather, If this strap of leather be an invention en-  
itling the inventor to a patent right, it can only extend to the strap, and  
he use of the string of buckets must remain free to be connected by chains,  
ropes, a strap of hempen girthing, or any other substance except leather ;  
ut indeed Mr. Martin had before used the strap of leather.  
  
The screw of Archimedes is as ancient at least as the age of that mathe-  
natician, who died more than wo thousand years ago, Diodorus Siculus  
‘peaks of it, lib. 1, page 21, and lib. 5, page 217, of Steven’s edition of  
1559, folio, and Vitravius, X. 11. The cutting of its spiral worm into sec-  
ions, for conveying flour or grain, seems to have been an invention of Mr.  
Evans, and to be a fair subject of a patent right, but it cannot take away  
rom others the use of Archimedes’ screw, with its perpetual spiral, for any  
urposes of which it is susceptible.  
  
The Hopperboy is an useful machine, and as far as I know original.  
  
It has been pretended by some (and in England especially) that inventors  
iave a natural and exclusive right to their inventions; and not merely for  
heir own lives, but inheritable to their heirs; and while it is a moot ques-  
on, whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at  
ll, it would be singular to admit a natural and even an hereditary right to

ject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre  
of land ; for instance, by an universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed  
or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for  
the moment of him who occupies it; but when he relinquishes the occupa-  
tion the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law,  
and is given late in the progress of society: it would be curious then if an  
idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could of natural right  
be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one  
thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action  
of the thinking power called an idea; which an individual may exclusively  
possess as long as he keeps it to himself, but the moment it is divulged, it  
forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dis.  
possess himself of it. Its peculiar character too is that no one possesses the  
less because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an  
idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who  
lights his taper at mine receives light without darkening me. That ideas  
should freely spread from one to another over the globe for the moral and  
mutual instruction of man and improvement of his condition, seems to haye  
been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature when she made them,  
like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any  
point; and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical  
being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then  
cannot in nature be a subject of property. Society may give an exclusive  
right to the profits arising from them as an encouragement to men to pursue  
ideas which may produce utility. But this may or may not be done accord-  
ing to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint  
from any body. Accordingly it is a fact, as far as | am informed, that Eng-  
land was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by  
a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some  
other countries it is sometimes done in a great case and by a special and per-  
sonal act ; but generally speaking other nations have thought that these mo-  
nopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society ; and it may  
be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of inventions are as  
fruitful as England in new and useful devices.  
  
Considering the exclusive right to invention as given, not of natural right  
but for the benefit of society, | know well the difficulty of drawing a line be-  
tween the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an  
exclusive patent and those which are not. As a member of the patent board  
for several years, while the law authorised a board to grant or refuse pa-  
tents, | saw with what slow progress a system of general rules could be  
matured. Some however were established by that board, One of these  
was, that a machine of which we were possessed, might be applied by eve-  
ry man to any use of which it is susceptible, and that this right ought not to  
be taken from him and given to a monopolist, because he first, perhaps,  
had occasion so to apply it. Thus a screw for crushing plaster might be  
employed for crushing corn cobs; and a chain pump for raising water might  
be used for raising wheat—this being merely a change of application.—  
Another rale was, that a change of material, should not give title to a pa-  
tent; as the making a plough share of cast rather than wrought iron ; a com)  
of iron instead of horn or of ivory; or the connecting of buckets by a band

of leather rather than of hemp oriron, A third was, that a mere change  
of form, should give no right to a patent; as a high quartered shoe instead  
of a low one, around hat instead of a three square, or a square bucket in-  
stead ofa round one ; but for this rule, all the changes of fashion in dress,  
would have been under the tax of patentees. These were among the rules  
which the uniform decisions of the board had already established: and under  
each of them Mr. Evans’ patent would have been refused. Ist, because it  
was a mere Change of application of the chain pump from raising water, to  
raise wheat. 2d, Because the using a leathern instead of a hempen band,  
was a mere change of material: and 3dly, square buckets instead of round,  
are only a change of form; and the ancient forms too, appear to have been  
indifferently square or round. But there were still abundance of cases  
which could not be brought under rule until they should have presented  
themselves under all their aspects; and these investigations occupying more  
time of the members of the board, than they could spare from bigher duties,  
the whole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured in a system un-  
der which every one might know when his actions were safe and lawful,  
Instead of refusing a patent in the first instance, as the board was authorized  
to do, the patent now issues of course subject to be declared void on such  
principles as should be established by the courts of law, This business how-  
ever is but little analogous to their course of reading, since we might in  
vain turn over all the lubberly volumes of the law, to find a single ray which  
would lighten the path of the mechanic or mathematician ; it is more within  
the information of a board of academical professors, and a previous refusal  
of a patent would better guard our citizens against harrassment by law suits.  
But England had given it to her judges, and the usual predominancy of ber  
example carried it to ours.  
  
It happened that | had myself a mill built in the interval between Mr.  
Evan’s first and second patents. I was living in Washington, and left the  
construction of the mill entirely to the mill-wright. I did not even know he  
had erected elevators, conveyors and hopperboys, until I learnt it by an ap-  
plication, from Mr, Evans’ agent for the patent price. Although I had no  
idea he had a right to it by Jaw (for no judicial decision had then been given)  
yet I did not hesitate to remit to Mr. Evans the old and moderate patent  
price, which was what he then asked, from a wish to encourage even the  
useful revival of ancient inventions. But I then expressed my opinion of the  
law, in a letter either to Mr. Evans or to his agent.  
  
I have thus, sir, at your request, given you the facts and ideas which oc-  
cur to me on the subject. I have done it without reserve, although I have  
not the pleasure of knowing you personally. In thus frankly committing my-  
self to you, I trust you will feel it as a point of honour and candour to make  
no use of my letter, which might bring disquietude on myself ;* and partic-  
ularly I should be unwilling to be brought into any difference with Mr.  
Evans, whom, however, | believe to be too reasonable to take offence at  
an honest difference of opinion. I esteem him much, and sincerely wish him  
wealth and honour. I deem him a valuable citizen of uncommon ingenuity  
and usefulness ; and had [ not esteemed still more the establishment of sound  
principles, | should now have been silent, If any of the matter I have of-  
fered can promote that object, | have no objection to its being so used. If  
it offers nothing new, it will of course not be used at all.
