[New York, May 28, 1788]  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
NEXT to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support. The remark made in relation to the president, is equally applicable here. In the general course of human nature, a power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will. And we can never hope to see realised in practice the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power, in any system, which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter. The enlightened friends to good government, in every state, have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the state constitutions on this head. Some of these indeed have declared that permanent

salaries should be established for the judges; but the experiment has in some instances shewn that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the convention accordingly has provided, that the judges of the United States “shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.”  
This, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible provision that could have been devised. It will readily be understood, that the fluctuations in the value of money, and in the state of society, rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the constitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to day, might in half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances; yet under such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may then be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both advantages. The salaries of judicial offices may from time to time be altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in respect to him. It will be observed that a difference has been made by the convention between the compensation of the president and of the judges. That of the former can neither be increased nor diminished. That of the latter can only not be diminished. This probably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective offices. As the president is to be elected for no more than four years, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the commencement of that period, will not continue to be such to the end of it. But with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will be secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially in the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would be very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too small in the progress of their service.

f representatives, and tried by the senate, and if convicted, may be dismissed from office and disqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on the point, which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own constitution in respect to our own judges.  
The want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability, has been a subject of complaint. But all considerate men will be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon, or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good purpose. The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, I believe, no place in the catalogue of known arts. An attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would much oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and enmities, than advance the interests of justice, or the public good. The result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part be arbitrary; and insanity without any formal or express provision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.

it supersedes all other argument. Next  
to permanency in office nothing can  
contribute more to the independence ot  
the fudges than a fixed provision for  
their support. In tht general cmrse of  
human nature a powir over a man&#x27;s  
suhkislence amounts to a power over his  
will. Ihe enlightened friends to good  
government in every State have seen  
cause to lament the want of precise ana  
explicit precautions in the State  
constitution on this head. Some of these  
indeed nave declared that permanent  
salaries should be established for tbe  
judges, but the experiment has in some  
instances shown that such expressions  
are not sufficiently definite to  
preclude legislative evasions. Something  
still more positive and unequivocal has  
been evinced to be requisite. The plan  
of the convention accordingly has  
provided that the judges of the United  
States &#x27; shall at stated tunes receive  
for their services a compensation, which  
shall not be diminished during their  
continuance in office.&#x27; This, all  
circumstances considered, is the most  
eligible provision that could have been  
devised. It will readily be underbtood  
that the fluctuations in the value of  
mojbey and in the btate of society  
rendered a fixed rate of compensation in  
the constitution inadiniesible. What  
might be extravagant to-day might in  
half a century-become penurious and  
inadequate. It was therefore necessary  
to leave it to the discretion of the  
Legislature to vary its provisions in  
conformity to the variations in  
circumstances, yet under such  
restrictions as to put it out of the  
power of that body worse. A man may then  
be sure of the ground upon which he  
stands, and can never be deterred from  
bis duty by the apprehension of being  
placed In a Ices eligible, situation.  
The clause which has been quoted  
combines both advantages. The salaries  
of . judicial officers may from time to  
time he altered as occasion may require;  
yet eo as never to lessen the allowance  
with which any particular judge comes  
into office&#x27;— that was the point—&#x27; in  
respect to him it will be observed lhat  
a difference has been made by the  
convention between the compensation ot  
the president and of the judges. That of  
the former can neither be incteased nor  
diminished. That of the latter can only  
not be diminished. &amp;s the president is  
to be elected for no more than four  
years, it can rarely happen that an  
adequate salary fixed at the  
commencement of that period will not  
continue to be such to its end. But with  
regard to the judges who if they behave  
properly will be secure in their places  
for life, it may well happen, especially  
in the early atages-ot the Government,  
that a stipend which would &#x27;Ve

strongly urged that a veto power similar
