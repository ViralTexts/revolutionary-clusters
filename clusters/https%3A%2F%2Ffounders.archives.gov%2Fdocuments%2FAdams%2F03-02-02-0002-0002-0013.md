Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,  
To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;

To be imprison’d in the viewless winds  
And blown with restless violence round about  
The pendent world;—’tis too horrible!  
The weariest, and most loathed worldly life,  
That age, ache, penury, imprisonment  
Can lay on nature, is a paradise  
To what we fear of Death.
