Sir  
Cambridge January 4. 1776  
  
Since my last of the 31st Ulto I have been honoured with your favour of the 22d, Inclosing sundry resolves, which shall, in matters they respect, be made the rule of my conduct.  
  
The resolution relative to the Troops in Boston, I beg the favour of you Sir, to assure Congress, shall be attempted to be put in execution, the first moment I see a probability of success, and in such a way, as a Council of Officers shall think most likely to produce it; but if this should not happen as soon as you may expect, or my wishes prompt to, I request that Congress will be pleased to Advert to my situation, and do me the justice to beleive, that circumstances, &amp; not want of inclination, are the cause of delay.  
It is not in the pages of History perhaps, to furnish a case like ours; to maintain a post within Musket Shot of the Enemy for Six months together, without—and at the same time to disband one Army and recruit another, within that distance, of Twenty odd British regiments, is more probably than ever was attempted; But if we succeed as well in the last, as we have heretofore in the first, I shall think it the most fortunate event of my whole life.  
By a very Intelligent Gentleman, a Mr Hutchinson from Boston, I learn that it was Admiral Shuldhum that came into the harbour on Saturday last—that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived at Hallifax; two others had sailed for Quebec (but what was become of them could not be told), and the other, the 55th, has just got into Boston—Certain it is also, that the greatest part of the 17[th] Regiment is arrived there, whether we are to conclude from hence, that more than five Regiments have been sent out, or that the Companies of the 17[th] arrived at Boston, are part of the Regiments destined for Hallifax &amp; Quebec, I know not—We also learn from this Gentleman &amp; others, that the Troops embarked for Hallifax, as mentioned in my Letter of the 16—were really designed for that place, but recalled from Nantasket road, upon advice being received, of the arrival of the above Regiments there—I am also Informed of a Fleet now getting ready under the Convoy of the Scarborough &amp; Fowey Men of War, consisting of 5 Transports &amp; 2 Bomb Vessels, with about 300 marines &amp; Several Flat bottom’d Boats—It is whispered that they are designed for Newport, but generally thought in Boston, that it is meant for Long-Island; and It is probable It will be followed by more Troops, as the other Transports are taking in Water, to  
  
lye as others say, in Nantasket road, to be out of the Ice—a large quantity of Biscuit is also baking.  
As the real design cannot with certainty be known, I submit it with all due deference to the superior Judgement of Congress, Whether It would not be consistent with prudence, to have some of the Jersey Troops thrown into New York, to prevent an evil, which may be almost irremediable, should It happen: I mean the landing of Troops at that place, or upon Long Island near it.  
As It is possible your may not yet have received his majesties most gracious speech, I do myself the honour to Inclose one, of many, which were sent out of Boston yesterday. It is full of rancour &amp; resentment, and explicitly holds forth his Royal will to be, that vigorous measures must be pursued to deprive us of our constitutional rights &amp; liberties—These measures, whatever they be, I hope will be opposed by more vigorous ones, and rendered unavailing and fruitless, tho santified and authorized by the name of majesty; a name which ought to promote the blessings of his people &amp; not their oppression. I am Sir with the

“ Ser, Cambridge, Fanuary 4, 1776.  
  
* Since my 4aft of the thirty-firft ultimo, I have been honored  
with your favor of the twenty-fecond, inclofing fundry refolves,  
which fhall, in matters they refpeét, be made the rule of my con-  
duct.  
  
* The refolution relative to the troops m Bolton, I beg the favor  
of you, fir, to affure Congrefs, fhall be attempted to be put in ex-  
ecution the firft moment I fee a probability of fuccefs, and in fuch  
a way asa council of officers fhall think moft likely to produce it:  
but if this fhould not happen as foon as you may expeét or my withes  
prompt to, I requeft that Congrefs will be pleafed to advert to my  
fituation, and do me the juttice te believe, that ciscamftances, and  
not want of inclination, are the caufe of delay.  
  
‘ It is not in the pages of -hiftory perhaps to.farnith a cafe like  
ours :—to maintain a poft within mufket-fhot of the enemy, for fix  
anonths tegether, without * _ , and at the fame time to difhand  
one army, and recruit another, within that diftance of twenty-odd  
Britifh regiments, —is more, probably, than ever was attempted.  
But if we fucceed as well in the laft, as we have heretofore in the  
firft, I fhall think it the moft fortunate event of my whole life.  
  
‘ By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchin{fon from Bofton,  
I learn, that it was admiral Shuldham that came into the harbor on  
faturday laf ;—that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived  
at Halifax ;—two others have failed for Quebec; but what was be-  
come of them, could not be told: —and the other (the fifty-fifth)  
has juft got into Bofton. Certain it is alfo, that the greateft part of  
the feventeenth regiment is arrived there. Whether we are to con-  
clude from hence that more than five regiments have been fent out,  
or that the companies of the feventeenth, arrived at Bofton, are  
part of the regiments deftined for Halifax and Quebec, I know not.  
  
* We alfo Jearn from this gentlemaa and others, that the troops,  
embarked for Halifax {as mentioned in my letter of the fixceenth)  
were really defigned for that place, but recalled from Nantatket  
road, upon advice being received of the above regiments there. I  
am alfo informed of a fleet acw getting ready under the convoy of  
the Scarborough and Fowey. men-of-war,—contifting of five tran&amp;  
ports and two bomb veffels, with about threc hundred marines, and  
deveral flat-bottomed boats. It is whifpered that they are defigned  
for Newport, but generally thought in Bofton that it is meant for  
Long-Ifland : and it is probable it will be followed by more troops,  
as the other tranfports are taking in water,—-to lic, as others fay, ia  
Nantafket road, to be dut of the ice. A large quantity of bifcuit  
is alfo baking.
