ly under consideration, and which the context &amp; spirit of the Constitution must decide, turned on the extent of the Treaty-power in relation to the objects specifically &amp; expressly submitted to the Legislative power of Congress.  
It was an important, &amp; appeared to him to be a decisive view of the subject, that if the Treaty-power alone could perform any one act for which the authority of Congress is required by the Constitution, it may perform every act for which the authority of that part of the Government is required. Congress have power to regulate trade, to declare war, to raise armies, to levy, borrow, and appropriate money, &amp;c. If by Treaty therefore, as paramount to the Legislative power, the President &amp; Senate can regulate Trade; they can also declare war; they can raise armies to carry on war; and they can procure money to support armies. These powers, however different in their nature or importance, are on the same footing in the Constitution, and must

he other the Federal Government. The powers of the Government had been further divided into three great Departments; and the Legislative department again subdivided into two independent branches. Around each of these portions of power, were seen also, exceptions and qualifications, as additional guards against the abuses to which power is liable. With a view to this policy of the Constitution, it could not be unreasonable, if the clauses under discussion were thought doubtful, to lean towards a construction that would limit &amp; controul the Treaty-making power, rather than towards one that would make it omnipotent.  
He came next to the Fifth Construction which left with the President &amp; Senate the power of making Treaties, but required at the same time the Legislative sanction &amp; co-operation, in those cases where the Constitution had given express &amp; specific powers to the Legislature. It was to be presumed that in all such cases, the Legislature would exercise its authority with discretion, allowing due weight to the reasons which led to the Treaty, and to the circumstance of the existence of the Treaty. Still, however, this House in its Legislative capacity, must exercise its reason; it must deliberate; for deliberation is implied in Legislation. If it must, carry all Treaties into effect, it would no longer exercise a legislative power: it would be the mere instrument of the will of another Department, and would have no will of its own. Where the Constitution contains a specific &amp; peremptory injunction on Congress to do a particular act, Congress must of course do the act, because the Constitution, which is paramount over all the Departments, has expressly taken away the Legislative discretion of Congress. The case is essentially different where the act of one Department of Government interferes with a power expressly vested in another and no where expressly taken away. Here the latter power must be exercised according to its nature; and if it be a Legislative power, it must be exercised with that deliberation &amp; discretion which is essential to the nature of Legislative power.  
  
It was said yesterday that a Treaty was paramount to all other Acts of Government, because all power resided in the people, and the President &amp; Senate, in making a Treaty, being the Constitutional organs of the people for that purpose, a Treaty when made was the act of the people. The argument was as strong the other way. Congress are as much the organs of the people, in

n this case of urging, as had been done, a particular distrust of the House of Representatives. He thought the President &amp; Senate would be as likely to make a bad Treaty, as this Branch of the Government would be to throw obstructions in the way of a good one, after it was made.  
No construction he said might be perfectly free from difficulties. That which he had espoused, was subject to the least; as it gave signification to every part of the Constitution, was most consistent with its general spirit, and was most likely in practice to promote the great object of it, the public good.

‘Tf a treaty embraces objects within the  
sphere of the general powers delegated to  
the General Government, but which have  
been exclusively and specially granted to a  
particular branch of Government—say to  
the legislative department—such a treaty,  
though not unconstitutional, does not be-  
come the law of the Jand until it has  
obtained the sanction of that branch.”  
  
So also Mr. Madison, referring to  
those ‘‘cases where the Constitution had  
given express and specific power to the  
legislature,” said:  
  
“‘It was to be presumed that in all such  
cases the legislature would exercise its  
authority with discretion, allowing due  
weight to the reasons which led to the  
treaty and to the circumstances of the ex-  
istence of the treaty. Still, however, this  
House in its legislative capacity must exer-  
cise its reason. It must deliberate, for de-  
liberation is implied in legislation. If it  
must carry all treaties into effect, it would  
no longer exercise a legislative power; it  
would be the mere instrument of the will  
of another department and would have no  
will of itsown. When the Constitution  
contains a specific and peremptory injunc-  
tion to doa particular act Congress must,  
of course, do that act, because the Consti-  
tution, which is paramount over all the de-  
partments, has expressly taken away the  
legislative discretion of Congress. The  
case is essentially different where the act  
of one department of Government interferes  
with a power expressly vested in another  
and nowhere expressly taken away. Here  
the latter power must be exercised accord-  
ing to its nature, and,if it be a legislative  
power, it must be exercised with that de-  
liberation and discretion which are essen-  
tial to the nature of legislative power.”  
  
Subsequently the same question came  
again before the House of Representatives,  
in 1816, growing out of another commer-  
cial treaty between the United States and
