d the apprehension of treachery or incapacity in a single individual. History informs us likewise of the difficulties with which these celebrated reformers had to contend; as well as of the expedients which they were obliged to employ, in order to carry their reforms into effect. Solon, who seems to have indulged a more temporising policy, confessed that he had not given to his countrymen the government best suited to their happiness, but most tolerable to their prejudices. And Lycurgus, more true to his object, was under the necessity of mixing a portion of violence with the authority of superstition; and of securing his final success, by a voluntary renunciation, first of his country, and then of his life. If these lessons teach us, on one hand, to admire the improvement made by America on the ancient mode of preparing and establishing regular plans of government; they serve not less on the other, to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident to such experiments, and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily multiplying them.

A patient who finds his disorder daily growing worse; and that an efficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme danger; after coolly revolving his situation, and the characters of different physicians, selects and calls in such of them as he judges most capable of administering relief, and best entitled to his confidence. The physicians attend: The case of the patient is carefully examined: a consultation is held. They are unanimously agreed that the symptoms are critical, but that the case, with proper and timely relief, is so far from being desperate, that it may be made to issue in an improvement of his constitution. They are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy by which this happy effect is to be produced. The prescription is no sooner made known however, than a number of persons interpose, and without denying the reality or danger of the disorder, assure the patient that the prescription will be poison to his constitution, and forbid him under pain of certain death to make use of it. Might not the patient reasonably demand before he ventured to follow this advice, that the authors of it should at least agree among themselves, on some other remedy to be substituted? And if he found them differing as much from one another, as from his first counsellors, would he not act prudently, in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the latter, rather than in hearkening to those who could neither deny the necessity of a speedy remedy, nor agree in proposing one?

e any two of them agreed in their objections to the remedy proposed, or in the proper one to be substituted? Let them speak for themselves. This one tells us that the proposed constitution ought to be rejected, because it is not a confederation of the states, but a government over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a government over individuals, to a certain extent, but by no means to the extent proposed. A third does not object to the government over individuals or to the extent proposed, but to the want of a bill of rights. A fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights, but contends that it ought to be declaratory not of the personal rights of individuals, but of the rights reserved to the states in their political capacity. A fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any sort would be superfluous and misplaced, and that the plan would be unexceptionable, but for the fatal power of regulating the times and places of election. An objector in a large state exclaims loudly against the unreasonable equality of representation in the senate. An objector in a small state is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in the house of representatives. From this quarter we are alarmed with the amazing expence from the number of persons who are to administer the new government. From another quarter, and sometimes from the same quarter, on another occasion, the cry is, that the congress will be but the shadow of a representation, and that the government would be far less objectionable, if the number and the expence were doubled. A patriot in a state that does not import or export, discerns insuperable objections against the power of direct taxation. The patriotic adversary in a state of great exports and imports, is not less dissatisfied that the whole burthen of taxes may be thrown on consumption. This politician discovers in the constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy. That is equally sure, it will end in aristocracy. Another is puzzled to say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume, but sees clearly it must be one or other of them. Whilst a fourth is not wanting, who with no less confidence affirms that the constitution is so far from having a bias towards either of these dangers, that the weight on that side will not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite propensities. With another class of adversaries to the constitution, the language is that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government, and all the requisite precautions in favour of liberty. Whilst this objection circulates in vague and general expressions, there are not a few who lend their sanction to it. Let each one come forward with his particular explanation and scarce any two are exactly agreed on the subject. In the eyes of one the junction of the senate with the president in the responsible function of appointing to offices, instead of vesting this executive power in the executive, alone, is the vicious part of the organisation. To another, the exclusion of the house of representatives, whose numbers alone could be a due security against corruption and partiality in the exercise of such a power, is equally obnoxious. With another, the admission of the president into any share of a power which must ever be a dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate, is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealousy. No part of the arrangement according to some is more admissible than the trial of impeachments by the senate, which is alternately a member both of the legislative and executive departments, when this power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department. We concur fully, reply others, in the objection to this part of the plan, but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error. Our principal dislike to the organisation arises from the extensive powers already lodged in that department. Even among the zealous patrons of a council of state, the most irreconcilable variance is discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be constituted. The demand of one gentleman is that the council should consist of a small number, to be appointed by the most numerous branch of the legislature. Another would prefer a larger number, and considers it as a fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by the president himself.  
As it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the federal constitution, let us suppose that as they are the most zealous, so they are also the most sagacious of those who think the late convention were unequal to the task assigned them, and that a wiser and better plan might and ought to be substituted. Let us further suppose that their country should concur both in this favourable opinion of their merits, and in their unfavourable opinion of the convention; and should accordingly proceed to form them into a second convention, with full powers and for the express purpose of revising and remoulding the work of the first. Were the experiment to be seriously made, though it requires some effort to view it seriously even in fiction, I leave it to be decided by the sample of opinions just exhibited, whether with all their enmity to their predecessors, they would in any one point depart so widely from their example, as in the discord and ferment that would mark their own deliberations; and whether the co

mediately adopted, and were to continue in force, not until a better, but until another should be agreed upon by this new assembly of lawgivers.  
It is a matter both of wonder and regret, that those who raise so many objections against the new constitution, should never call to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not necessary that the former should be perfect; it is sufficient that the latter is more imperfect. No man would refuse to give brass for silver or gold, because the latter had some alloy in it. No man would refuse to quit a shattered and tottering habitation, for a firm and commodious building, because the latter had not a porch to it; or because some of the rooms might be a little larger or smaller, or the ceiling a little higher or lower than his fancy would have

rt, is it not manifest that most of the capital objections urged against the new system, lie with tenfold weight against the existing confederation? Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of a federal government? The present congress can make requisitions to any amount they please; and the states are constitutionally bound to furnish them; they can emit bills of credit as long as they will pay for the paper; they can borrow both abroad and at home, as long as a shilling will be lent. Is an indefinite power to raise troops dangerous? The confederation gives to congress that power also; and they have already begun to make use of it. Is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men? Congress, a single body of men, are the sole depository of all the federal powers. Is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of the treasury, and the command of the army, into the same hands? The confederation places them both in the hands of congress. Is a bill of rights essential to liberty? The confederation has no bill of rights. Is it an objection against the new constitution, that it empowers the senate with the concurrence of the executive to make treaties which are to be the laws of the land? The existing congress, without any such controul, can make treaties which they themselves have declared, and most of the states have recognized, to be the supreme law of the land. Is the importation of slaves permitted by the new constitution for twenty years? By the old, it is permitted for ever.  
I shall be told that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be in theory, it is rendered harmless by the dependence of congress on the states for the means of carrying them into practice: That however large the mass of powers may be, it is in fact a lifeless mass. Then say I in the first place, that the confederation is chargeable with the still grea

 is not all. Out of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent power, which tends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a defective construction of the supreme government of the union. It is now no longer a point of speculation and hope that the western territory is a mine of vast wealth to the United States; and although it is not of such a nature as to extricate them from their present distresses, or for some time to come, to yield any regular supplies for the public expences, yet must it hereafter be able under proper management both to effect a gradual discharge of the domestic debt, and to furnish for a certain period, liberal tributes to the federal treasury. A very large proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual states; and it may with reason be expected, that the remaining states will not persist in withholding similar proofs of their equity and generosity. We may calculate therefore that a rich and fertile country, of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the United States, will soon become a national stock. Congress have assumed the administration of this stock. They have begun to render it productive. Congress have undertaken to do more, they have proceeded to form new states; to erect temporary governments; to appoint officers for them; and to prescribe the conditions on which such states shall be admitted into the confederacy. All this has been done; and done without the least colour of constitutional authority. Yet no blame has been whispered; no alarm has been sounded. A great and independent fund of revenue is passing into the hands of a single body of men, who can raise troops to an indefinite number, and appropriate money to their support for an indefinite period of time. And yet there are men who have not only been silent spectators of this prospect; but who are advocates for the system which exhibits it; and at the same time urge against the new system the objections which we have heard. Would they not act with more consistency in urging the establishment of the latter, as no less necessary to guard the union against the future powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing congress, than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present impotency of that assembly?  
I mean not by any thing here said to throw censure on the measures which have been pursued by congress. I am sensible they could not have done otherwise. The public interest, the necessity of the case, imposed upon them the task of overleaping their constitutional limits. But is not the fact an alarming proof of the danger resulting from a government which does not possess regular powers commensurate to its objects? A dissolution or usurpation is the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually exposed.

of his position. In the 38th No. of the Federalist,  
alluding to the public lands, Mr. Madison  
says :  
&quot; Congress have assumed the administration of  
this stock, (the public lands.) Congress have undertaken  
to do more?tbey have proceeded to  
form new States; to erect temporary government^  
?to appoint*officers for them ; and to prescribe  
the conditions on which such States shall be admitted  
into the confederacy. All this has been  
done, and without the least color of constitutional  
authority. Yet no blame has been whispered ;  
no alarm has been sounded. A gteat ana independent  
ftind of revenue is passing into the hands  
of a single body of men, wiio can raise troops to  
an indefinite number, and appropriate money to  
their support for an indefinite period of time.  
And yet there are men who have not only been  
*il*nt MimMaljirs nf thin nroancci. but who are the  
  
advocates of the system Which exhibits it; and ai  
die same time, urge against tha new system  
the objections which we have heard. Would  
they not act with more consistency in urgitig the  
establishment of the latter, as 110 less necessary to  
guard the Union against the future powers and  
resources of a body constructed like the existing  
Congress, than to save it from the dangers threat*  
ened by the present impotency of that assembly!  
&quot; I mean net, by any dung hare said, lo-lhrow  
censure on the measures which have been pursued  
by Congress. I am sensible they could not hart  
done otherwise. The public interest, the necessity  
of the case, imposed upon them the task of over*  
leaping their constitutional limits. But is not thf  
fact an alarming proof of the danger resulting  
from a government which does not possess regular  
powers commensurate to its objects ? A dissolution  
or usurpation is the dreadful dilemma to  
which it is continually exposed.

of the great objections to the old Confederation, as we  
learn from contemporary writers, was that Congress was  
the sole depository of all the Federal powers, it being  
deemed improper and unsafe to intermix the different  
powers of Government in the same body of men. The  
preaent Constitution was not established to take all the  
Federal powers from Congress and give them to the Pre­  
sident. The office of President was created that he who  
fills it may exeeuU the laws, and not make them.&quot; * * *

which it is worth while to amend the funda­  
mental law in order to give to them? Why,  
these.The power &quot;to form new States; to  
erect temporary governments; to appoint of­  
ficers for them, and to prescribe the conditions  
on which such States shall be admitted into  
the confederacy.&quot;  
The argument then is two-fold.  
Ist. The possession of such powers is abso­  
lutely indispensable.  
2d. The Constitution grants them, which  
the Article of Confederation did not, and  
therefore the former should be adopted in  
place of the latter.  
The arguments amounts to nothing if it  
does not amount to this. Here, then, we find  
the leading member of the Constitution that  
formed our Constitution, urging the impor­

of these States in a terrible turmoil. Mr.   
Slesuson, in the nth number of the Peterahst,   
lir:stag...the adoption of the Constitution, gives   
a summary-Ary-or_the objections made against it,   
which we here   
  
&quot;One tells us, that the pre&#x27;PeSed—Constitution   
ought to be rejected, because it Is not a cotirettc,ca,   
tote of the States, but a government over indi­  
viduals. Another admits that it ought to bo age•   
comment over individuals to a Certain oktent, butt   
by no moans to the extent propoted. A third does   
not object to the goVetntient Over individuate, or   
to the extent proposed, but to the want of a bill of   
rights A fourth concurs in the absoiute neoessity   
of a bill of rights, but contoods that it ought to be   
liotderatall, not of the personal rights of loll­  
vides&#x27;s. but of the rights reserved to the Stela in   
their political opacity. A fifth lit of opinion that   
n bill of rights of any Mt would be superfluous   
and misplaced, slid that the plan would be unex­  
oeptinnabiti hit for the fatal power of regulating   
the times and places of election. An objector in a   
large State exclaims loudly against the unremona­  
ble,equality of representation in the &amp;Moto An   
objector in a small State is equally loud   
against the dangerous inequality in the House of   
Representatives. From one quarter we are alarmed   
with the amazing expense, from the number of   
Onions who are to administer the new government..   
Prim, another &#x27;quarter&#x27; &#x27;and sometimes front the   
:time quarter, on another occasion, tbecry that   
the&#x27;Congress will be butthe sheddir of a represen­  
tation, and that the goVeintnent would be far lees   
objjiationable ll&#x27; the number and the expense were   
doubled. A patriot in a State that does not Ina-  
Dort •or export disarm insuperable objections   
against the power of direct taxation. The patriotic   
eddersary, in a State of great oxportif And imports.   
is pot less dissatisfied that the whole burthen of   
taxes may be throiVg oh &#x27;Consumption. , This politb   
ibtu discovetis H the Constitution a direct and irre,   
a&#x27;atible tabiltaney to monarchy. That is equally sure   
it   
Will chi in aristocracy. Another is puzzled to   
my which of those shapes it will ultimately assume,   
b. 4 sees clearly it must be ono or other of them.   
Whilst a fourth is not wanting, who, with no less   
confidence, affirma that the Constitution is so far   
froin baring a hiss towards either of these clan•   
gers, that the weight on that side will not he suffi­  
cient to keep It upright and firm against its oppc,   
attfpropensitles. With abOther class of adversa­  
ries to -the Conlititution, the la, gintio it, that   
Sul legislative, executive&#x27;, &#x27;end judielary depart­  
ments are intenniked in gush a manner   
aep contradiot all the Ideas of regular go­  
ye reent, and all the requisite precautions in   
&#x27;fa ,or of liberty. Whilst this objection circulates   
in vague and general expressions, there are not a   
lei who lend their sanction to it. Let each ono   
co o forward with his particular explanation, and   
&#x27;,e ansell,. any two are exactly agreed on the sub­  
jot. In the oyes of one, the junction of the Senate   
with the President, in the responsible function of   
appointing to emcee, instead of vesting this power   
in . the Executive alone, is the vicious pert of the   
organization. To another, the exclusion of the   
(louse of Represontatrves, whose members alone   
could bo a duo Security against corruption   
and partiality to the exercise of ouch a power, is   
equally obnoxious. With a third, the admission of   
the President into any share of a power, which   
nalist ever be a dangerous engine in the hands of   
the Executive Magistrate, is an unpardonable vie­  
lotion of the maxims&#x27; of republican jealousy. No   
part of the arrangement, according to some, is more   
inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the   
Seha te, which is, alternately, a member both of the   
legislative and executive departments, when the   
power so evidently belonged to the judiciary de­  
partment&#x27; We concur folly, reply others, in the   
objection to this , part of the plan, but we on   
never agree that a reference of impeachments   
to the judiciary authority would he an amend­  
ment of the error. Our   
,principal dislike to the   
organization arises from the extensive powers   
already lodged in that department. Even among   
the zealous patrons of a 00110011 of State the most   
irreconcilable variance is (Hoovered concerning   
the mode in which it ought to be constituted. The   
haand of one gentleman is, that the counoil   
,!(cold consist of a small number, to be appointed   
by the most numerous branch of the Legislature.   
Another would prefer a larger number, and con­  
eiders it as a fundamental condition that the tip•

Madison thus speaks in the Federalist: “A very large pro-  
portion of the fund [referring to the Western Territory] has  
been already surrendered by individual States; and it may  
be expected that the remaining States will not persist in  
withholding similar proofs of their equity and generosity.  
We may calculate, therefore, that a rich and fertile soil of an  
area equal to the inhabited extent of the United States will  
soon become a national stock. Congress have assumed the  
administration of this stock. They have begun to make it  
productive. Congress have undertaken to do more: they  
have proceeded to form new States, to erect temporary govern-
