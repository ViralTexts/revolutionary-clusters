He began, by observing that he had expected, from what was intimated yesterday, the sequel of what was then said against the resolutions before the committee; but as there was a silence in that quarter, and no other member has risen on either side of the question, he himself would request the attention of the committee.  
It had been much pressed, that in the discussion of this subject, it should be viewed in its commercial relations only. He was perfectly willing to meet every objection that could be urged on that ground: But as he conceived it impossible to do full justice to the interests of the United States without taking some collateral considerations into view; he should be obliged in the course of his remarks, to point at the political disposition and conduct of some of the nations of Europe towards this country.  
The propositions immediately before the committee, turned on the question whether any thing ought to be done at this time, in the way of commercial regulations, towards vindicating and advancing our national interests. Perhaps it might be made a question with some, whether in any case, legislative regulations of commerce were consistent with its nature and prosperity.  
He professed himself to be a friend to the theory which gives to industry a free course, under the impulse of individual interest, and the guidance of individual sagacity. He was persuaded that it would be happy for all nations, if the barriers erected by prejudice, by avarice, and by despotism, were broken down, and a free intercourse established among them. Yet to this, as to all other general rules, there might be exceptions: And the rule itself required, what did not exist, that it should be general.  
  
To illustrate this observation, he referred to the navigation act of Great-Britain, which not being counterbalanced by any similar acts on the part of rival nations, had secured to Great-Britain no less than eleven-twelfths of the shipping and seamen employed in her trade. It is stated, that in 1660, when the British act passed, the foreign tonnage was to the British as one to four: In 1700, less than one to six: In 1725 as one to nineteen: In 1750, as one to twelve: In 1774, nearly the same. At the commencement of the period, the tonnage was but 95,266 tons: At the end of it, 1,136,162.  
As another illustration, he mentioned the case where two countries happened to be in such a relation to each other, that the one, by discouraging the manufactures of the other, might not only invigorate its own, but transplant the manufacturers themselves. Here the gain would be a clear one; and the effect evidently consistent with the principle of the theory.  
To allow trade to regulate itself is not therefore to be admitted as a maxim universally found. Our own experience has taught us that in certain cases, it is the same thing with allowing one nation to regulate it for another. Were the United States in fact in commercial intercourse with one nation only, and to oppose no restrictions whatever to a system of foreign restrictions, they would of necessity be deprived of all share in the carriage, altho’ their vessels might be able to do it cheapest; as well as of the only resources for defence on that side, where they must always be most exposed to attack. A small burden only in foreign ports on American vessels, and a perfect equality of foreign vessels with our own in our own ports, would gradually banish the latter altogether.  
This subject, as had been remarked on a former occasion, was not a novel one. It was co-eval with our political birth; and has at all times exercised the thoughts of reflecting citizens. As early as the year succeeding the peace, the effect of the foreign policy which began to be felt in our trade and navigation, excited universal attention and inquietude. The first effort thought of, was an application of Congress to the states for a grant of power for a limited time, to regulate our foreign commerce; with a view to control the influence of unfavorable regulations in some cases, and to conciliate an extension of favorable ones in others. From some circumstances then incident to our situation, and particularly from a radical vice in the then political system of the United States, the experiment did not take effect.  
The states next endeavored to effect their purpose by separate but concurrent regulations. Massachusetts opened a correspondence with Virginia and other states, in order to bring about the plan. Here again the effort was abortive.  
  
Out of this experience, grew the measures which terminated in the establishment of a government competent to the regulation of our commercial interests, and the vindication of our commercial rights.  
As these were the first objects of the people in the steps taken for establishing the present government, they were universally expected to be among the first fruits of its operation. In this expectation the public were disappointed. An attempt was made in different forms and received the repeated sanction of this branch of the legislature, but they expired in the Senate: Not indeed, as was alledged, from a dislike to the attempt altogether, but the modifications given to it. It has not appeared, however, that it was ever renewed in a different form in that house; &amp; for some time it has been allowed to sleep in both.  
If the reasons which originally prevailed against measures, such as those now proposed, had weight in them, they can no longer furnish a pretext for opposition.  
When the subject was discussed in the first Congress at New-York, it was said, that we ought to try the effect of a generous policy towards Great-Britain; that we ought to give time for negociating a treaty of commerce; that we ought to await the close of negociations for explaining and executing the treaty of peace. We have now waited a term of more than four years. The treaty of peace remains unexecuted on her part; tho’ all pretext for delay has been removed by the steps taken on ours. No treaty of commerce is either in train, or in prospect. Instead of relaxations in former articles complained of, we suffer new and aggravated violations of our rights.  
In the view which he took of the subject, he called the attention of the committee particularly to the subject of navigation, of manufactures, and of the discrimination proposed in the motion, between some nations and others.  
On the subject of navigation, he observed that we were prohibited by the British laws from carrying to Great-Britain the produce of other countries from their ports, or our own produce from the ports of other countries, or the produce of other countries from our own ports; or to send our own produce from our own or other ports in the vessels of other countries. This last restriction was, he observed, felt by the United States at the present moment. It was indeed the practice of Great-Britain sometimes to relax her navigation act so far in time of war, as to permit to neutral vessels a circuitous carriage; but as yet the act was in full force against the use of them for transporting the produce of the United States.  
On the other hand, the laws of the United States allowed Great-Britain to bring into their ports, any thing she might please, from her own or from other ports; and in her own or in other vessels.  
In the trade between the United States and the British West-Indies, the vessels of the former were under an absolute prohibition; whilst British vessels in that trade enjoyed all the privileges granted to other, even the most favored nations in their trade with us. The inequality in this case was the more striking, as it was evident that the West-Indies were dependant on the United States for the supplies essential to them, and that the circumstances which secured to the United States this advantage, enabled their vessels to transport the supplies on far better terms than could be done by British vessels.  
To illustrate the policy requisite in our commercial intercourse with other nations, he presented a comparative view of the American and foreign tonnage employed in the respective branches of it, from which it appeared that the foreign stood to the American as follows—  
  
  
Spain  
1  
to  
5  
  
  
Portugal

France,

Great-Britain,

to

It results from these facts that in proportion as the trade might be diminished with Great-Britain and increased with other nations, would be the probable increase of the American tonnage. It appeared, for example, that as the trade might pass from British channels into those of France it would augment our tonnage at the rate of ten to one.  
The above calculation, he said, had been made out on the documents of 1790, and on the amount of the tonnage entered in the several ports. A document, stating the amounts of the actual tonnage in the American trade, had been just reported to that house. If this, which was liable to some remarks that might hereafter be made, was to be substituted, it afforded another calculation, diminishing the excess in favor of Great-Britain, but augmenting it in favor of the United States in most of the other instances.  
According to this calculation the foreign to the American tonnage might be stated, as follows:

Such a disproportion, taking even the reduced one, in the navigation with Great-Britain, was the more mortifying, when the nature and amount of our exports are considered. Our exports are not only for the most part, either immediately necessaries of life, or ultimately as necessaries to manufactures, necessaries of employment and life to manufacturers, and must thence command a sure market wherever they are received at all: But the peculiar bulkiness of them furnishes an advantage over the exports of every other country; and particularly over those of Great-Britain. If such an advantage belonged to that nation, the policy which governs her navigation laws, would probably have given the exclusive carriage to her own bottoms. It is equally in our power, if so selfish a principle should be forced upon us, to secure to our bottoms the same monopoly; leaving to other nations with which we trade, the like exclusive carriage of their exports. The regulation would, to be sure, be mutually inconvenient; and by forcing the vessels of each party to return empty from foreign markets, be so far a tax on the intercourse. This effect, however, did not disprove the power in general which the character of our exports gave us, over the carriage of them, nor lessen the argument drawn from it. Examine it in relation to Great-Britain. The bulk of her exports to us compared with that of ours to her, is as nothing. An inconsiderable quantity of shipping would suffice for hers, whilst ours can load about 222,000 tons: Including the articles she exports from the West-Indies to this country, they bear no proportion to ours. Yet in the entire trade between the United States and the British dominions, her tonnage is to that of the United States as 156,000, employing 9,360 seamen, to 66,000, employing 3,690 seamen. Were a rigid exertion of our right to take place, it would extend our tonnage to 222,000; and leave to G. B. employment for much less than the actual share now enjoyed by the United States. It could not be wished to push matters to this extremity. It shewed, however, the very unequal and unfavorable footing, on which the carrying trade, the great resource of our safety and respectability, was placed by foreign regulations, and the reasonableness of peaceable attempts to meliorate it. We might at least, in availing ourselves of the merit of our exports, contend for such regulations as would reverse the proportion, and give the United States the 156,000 tonnage and 9,360 seamen, instead of the 66,000 tonnage and 3,690 seamen.  
He here adverted to the discount of ten per cent. on the duties paid by goods imported in American bottoms; remarking that it was not founded on the true policy of encouraging our shipping. It was not the imports but exports that regulated the quantity of tonnage. What was imported in American vessels, which would otherwise return empty, was no doubt, a benefit to the American merchant, but could slightly only, if at all, increase the mass of our tonnage. The way to effect this was to secure exportations to American bottoms.  
Proceeding to the subject of manufactures, he observed that it presented no compensations for the inequalities in the principles and effects of the navigation system.  
We consume British manufactures to double the amount of what Britain takes from us; and quadruple the amount of what she actually consumes.  
We take everything after it has undergone all the profitable labor that can be bestowed on it: She receives in return, raw materials, the food of her industry.  
We send necessaries to her: She sends superfluities to us.  
We admit every thing she pleases to send us, whether of her own or alien production. She refuses not only our manufactures, but the articles we wish most to send her; our wheat and flour, our fish, and our salted provisions. These constitute our best staples for exportation; as her manufactures constitute hers.  
It appeared by an authentic document he had examined, that of the manufactured articles imported in 1790, amounting to 15,295,638 dollars 97 cents, we received from and thro’ Great Britain, 13,965,464 dollars 95 cents.  
During the same year, the manufactures imported from France, the next great commercial country, and consuming more of our produce than Great-Britain, amounted to no more than 155,136 dollars and 63 cents.  
To give a fuller view of our foreign commerce, he stated the balances with the several nations of Europe and their dominions, as follow:  
  
  
  
Dollars.  
  
  
  
Spain  
1,670,797  
in favor of U. S.  
  
  
Portugal  
1,687,699  
do.  
  
  
U. Netherlands  
791,118  
do.  
  
  
Sweden  
32,965  
do.  
  
  
Denmark  
126,949  
against the U. S.  
  
  
France  
2,630,387  
in favor of U. S.  
  
  
G. Britain  
5,922,012  
against the U. S.  
  
  
This enormous balance to G. B. is on the exports to her. On her consumption the balance is still greater, amounting to nine or ten millions, to which again is to be added her profits on the re-exports in a manufactured and raw state.  
It might be said that an unfavorable balance was no proof of an unfavorable trade; that the only important balance was the ultimate one on our aggregate commerce.  
  
That there was much truth in this general doctrine was admitted; at the same time it was equally certain that there were exceptions to it, some of which were conceived to be applicable to the situation of the United States.  
But whether the doctrine were just or not, as applied to the United States, it was well known that the reasoning and practice of other countries were governed by a contrary doctrine. In all of them, an unfavorable balance to be paid in specie, was considered as an evil. Great-Britain in particular had always studied to prevent it as much as she could. What then may be the effect on the policy of a nation with which we have the most friendly and beneficial relations, when it sees the balance of trade with us not only so much against her, but all the specie that pays it, flowing immediately into the lap of her greatest rival, if not her most inveterate enemy.  
As to the discrimination proposed between nations having, and not having commercial treaties with us, the principle was embraced by the laws of most, if not all the states, whilst the regulation of trade was in their hands.  
It had the repeated sanction of votes in the house of representatives, during the session of the present government at New-York.  
It has been practised by other nations, and in a late instance against the United States.  
It tends to procure beneficial treaties from those who refuse them, by making them the price of enjoying an equality with other nations in our commerce.  
It tends, as a conciliatory preference, to procure better treaties from those who have not refused them.  
It was a prudent consideration, in dispensing commercial advantages, to favor rather those whose friendship and support may be expected in case of necessity, than those whose disposition wore a contrary aspect. He did not wish to enter at present, nor at all, if unnecessary, into a display of the unfriendly features which marked the policy of Great-Britain towards the United States. He should be content to lay aside, at least for the present, the subject of the Indians, the Algerines, the spoliations, &amp;c. but he could not forbear remarking generally, that if that, or any other nation were known to bear us a settled ill-will, nothing could be more impolitic than to foster resources which would be more likely to be turned against us, than exerted in our favor.  
It had been admitted by the gentleman who spoke yesterday (Mr. Smith of South Carolina) to be a misfortune, that our trade should be so far engrossed by any one nation, as it is, in the hands of Great-Britain. But the gentleman added nothing to alleviate the misfortune, when he advised us to make no efforts for putting an end to it. The evils resulting from such a state of things were as serious as they were numerous. To say nothing of sudden derangements from the caprice with which sovereigns might be seized, there were casualities which might not be avoidable. A general bankruptcy, which was a possible event, in a nation with which we were so connected, would reverberate upon us with a most dreadful shock. A partial bankruptcy, had actually and lately taken place; and was severely felt in our commerce. War is a common event particularly, to G. Britain, and involves us in the embarrassments it brings on her commerce whilst ours is so disproportionately interwoven with it. Add, the influence that may be conveyed into the public councils by a nation directing the course of our trade by her capital, &amp; holding so great a share in our pecuniary institutions; and the effect that may finally ensue on our taste, our manners, and our form of government itself.  
If the question be asked, what might be the consequence of counter-efforts, and whether this attempt to vindicate our public interests would not produce them? His answer was, that he did not in the least apprehend such a consequence, as well because the measure afforded no pretext, being short of what was already done by Great-Britain in her commercial system, as because she would be the greatest sufferer from a stagnation of the trade, between the two countries if she should force on such a crisis.  
Her merchants would feel it. Her navigation would feel it. Her manufacturers would feel it. Her West-Indies would be ruined by it. Her revenue would deeply feel it. And her government would feel it thro’ every nerve of its operations. We too should suffer in some respects, but in a less degree, and, if the virtue and temper of our fellow citizens were not mistaken, the experiment would find in them a far greater readiness to bear it. It was clear to him, therefore, that if Great-Britain should, contrary to all the rules of probability, stop the commerce between the two countries, the issue would be a compleat triumph to the United States.  
He dwelt particularly on the dependence of British manufactures on the market of the United States. He referred to a paper in Andersons history of commerce, which states the amount of British manufactures at £.51,310,000 sterling, and the number of souls employed in, and supported by them, at 5,250,000. Supposing the United States to consume two and a half millions of British manufactures which is a moderate estimate, the loss of their market, would deprive of subsistence 250,000 souls. Add 50,000 who depend for employment on our raw materials. Here are 300,000 souls, who live by our custom. Let them be driven to poverty and despair by acts of their own government, and what would be the consequence? Most probably an acquisition of so many useful citizens to the United States, which form the natural asylum against the distresses of Europe. But whether they should remain in discontent and wretchedness in their own country, or seek their fortunes in another, the evil would be felt by the British government as equally great, and be avoided with equal caution.  
It might be regarded, he observed, as a general rule, that where one nation consumed the necessaries of life produced by another, the consuming nation was dependent on the producing one. On the other hand, where the consumption consisted of superfluities, the producing nation was dependent on the consuming one. The United States were in the fortunate situation of enjoying both these advantages over Great-Britain. They supply a part of her dominions with the necessaries of life. They consume superfluities which give bread to her people in another part. Great Britain therefore is under a double dependence on the commerce of the United States. She depends on them for what she herself consumes: she depends on them for what they consume.  
In proportion as a nation manufactures luxuries must be its disadvantage in contests of every sort with its customers. The reason is obvious. What is a luxury to the consumer is a necessary to the manufacturer. By changing a fashion, or disappointing a fancy only, bread may be taken from the mouths of thousands whose industry is devoted to the gratification of artificial wants.  
He mentioned the case of a petition from a great body of buckle makers presented a few years ago to the prince of Wales, complaining of the use of strings instead of buckles in the shoes, and supplicating his royal highness as giving the law to fashions, to save them from want and misery, by discontinuing the new one. It was not, he observed, the prince who petitioned the manufacturers to continue to make the buckles, but the manufacturers who petitioned their customers to buy them. The relation was similar between the American customers and the British manufacturers. And if a law were to pass for putting a stop to the use of their superfluities, or a stop were otherwise to be put to it, it would quickly be seen from which the distress and supplications would flow.  
Suppose that Great Britain received from us alone the whole of the necessaries she consumes; and that our market alone took off the luxuries with which she paid for them. Here the dependence would be compleat; and we might impose whatever terms we pleased on the exchange. This to be sure is not absolutely the case; but in proportion as it is the case, her dependence is on us.  
The West-Indies however are an example of compleat dependence. They cannot subsist without our food. They cannot flourish without our lumber, and our use of their rum. On the other hand we depend on them for not a single necessary, and can supply ourselves with their luxuries from other sources. Sugar is the only article about which there was ever a question, and he was authorised to say, that there was not at the most, one sixth of our consumption supplied from the British islands.  
In time of war or famine the dependence of the West-Indies is felt in all its energy. It is sometimes such as to appeal to our humanity as well as our interest for relief. At this moment, the governor of Jamaica is making proclamation of their distresses. If ever therefore there was a case where one country could dictate to another the regulations of trade between them, it is the case of the United States, and the British West-Indies. And yet the gentleman from South-Carolina (Mr. Smith) had considered it as a favor that we were allowed to send our provisions in British bottoms &amp; in these only, to the West-Indies. The favor reduced to plain language in the mouth of their planters, would run thus: We will agree to buy your provisions rather than starve, and let you have our rum, which we can sell nowhere else; but we reserve out of this indulgence a monopoly of the carriage to British vessels.  
With regard to revenue, the British resources were extremely exhausted in comparison with those of the United States.  
The people of Great-Britain were taxed at the rate of 40/ a head: the people of the United States at not more than 6/ a head; less than one-sixth of the British tax.  
As the price of labor which pays the tax is double in the United States, to what it is in Great-Britain, the burden on American citizens is less than one-twelfth of the burden on British subjects.  
It is true indeed that Britain alone does not bear the whole burden. She levies indirect taxes on her West-Indies and on her East-Indies; and derives from an acquiescence in her monopolizing regulations, an imperceptible tribute from the whole commercial world.  
Still however the difference of burden in the two countries is immense.  
Britain has moreover great arrears of unfunded debts. She is threatened with defects in her revenue even at this time. She is engaged in an expensive war. And she raises the supplies for it on the most expensive terms.  
Add to the whole that her population is stationary if not diminishing, whilst that of the United States is in a course of increase beyond example.

ere no treaties existed or where they were silent, there were often legal regulations reciprocating the regulations of Great-Britain. He referred to the laws of Sweden and Denmark on the subject of manufactures as instances.

us. He premised, however, that he could not follow the example of recurring to a period antecedent to the French revolution for evidence in relation to France. Mr. Smith, seemed to think that the order of things subsequent to that period, could not be regarded as a settled order. He, (Mr. Madison) on the contrary, considered it as the only settled order.

.  
The next ground on which he examined the subject was it’s operation among the several parts of the union. It was admitted and regretted, that the immediate benefits and burdens would not be equally distributed among all the states. More than a due share of the former would flow to the northern division: More than a due share of the latter would fall on the southern. This was unavoidably produced by the unequal advances made in manufactures and navigation; and it was an inconvenience that had necessarily taken place in a variety of other instances. It would be found, however, on a fair attention to the subject, that the inequality would be less than at first appeared.  
With respect to manufactures, the southern states were at least equally interested in encouraging and distributing a competition for our market, among different nations of Europe, instead of being so much in the hands of a single one.  
The duty on the finer articles imported would fall on those most able to bear it; and would be pretty equally diffused through the union.  
The duty on the coarser articles would be saved in proportion to the progress made in manufactures among ourselves; and he was able to say, with great pleasure, that those carried on, not in public factories, but in the household or family way, which he regarded as the most important way, were nearly, if not quite as far advanced in the southern country as in the middle and northern. Virginia was proceeding with great spirit in this branch of industry. North-Carolina he understood was doing the same; and there was no reason why the more southern states would not avail themselves of the resource, especially as they enjoyed superior advantages in the article of cotton, a primary material for the business.  
The exports would not be materially affected unless Great-Britain, should contrary to all probability, renounce the benefits of the trade in them, and expose her West-India islands to the danger of famine; and in that case, the inconveniences would be not local but general.  
Even in the article of tonnage the inequality at present tho’ considerable, was not so great as he had imagined, before he examined the real state of it. It appeared from the official reports lately made on that subject, that the states south of Pennsylvania (which has about her due share,) have within one-third of their due quota. Georgia has more than her share. South-Carolina nearly her share. North Carolina has three eighths below her share. Virginia has about half her share. Maryland has more than her share. Delaware less than her share.  
This computation is not perhaps very accurate, because it is founded on the relative population of the states. It should rather have reference to the value and volume of the produce exported from the several states. But as several of them carry on their trade thro’ their neighbours, this rule of calculation would in fact be more uncertain than the other.  
Whatever be the rule, Virginia, he remarked, was the state that appeared most deficient; her exports both in value and bulk, being in full proportion to her population, and her tonnage being more short of that, than could be said of any state. He had every reason, notwithstanding, to believe that the great body of the people of Virginia, would chearfully concur in any temporary sacrifices, that might be necessary to vindicate our public rights, and our commercial interests.  
It was a consideration that ought to have great weight with the southern states, that a home market for their naval stores would be extended by every measure, favoring our own navigation; and that they must soon begin themselves to turn to effect their natural advantages for ship building. Having the materials on the spot, they would not be long in imitating their northern brethren, North-Carolina was singularly favored in this particular. There was not a single article used in the various component parts of a ship, which she did not possess, or could not raise within herself.  
The capacity of the United States, to provide with celerity for the transportation of their produce, was strongly attested by what they had effected before the revolution. In the marine of the British empire, whilst the United States were part of it, the American built ships were to the British built as 23 to 40. New-England furnished about three fifths of the former.  
In two points of view, the southern states were peculiarly interested in promoting our navigation.  
First. As they are in some respects the weaker part of the Union, and have most wealth exposed on the sea, they have most need of that protection, which results from extensive marine resources. The existence of these will either prevent attack, or can readily be turned into the means of repelling it.  
Secondly. As they have so much valuable and bulky produce to carry to market, it is their interest to possess a conveyance for it, that may be as little affected as possible by the contingencies and wars of other nations; and particularly of Great-Britain, a nation which is so frequently at war, and which has so disproportionate a share in our carrying trade. This subject, he said, had been placed in so striking a view, by the Secretary of State in a former report on the fisheries, that he should rely on the patience of the committee in reading the observations and calculations to which he alluded. He here read the following note at the end of that report.  
  
“That the encouragement of our carrying business is interesting, not only to the carrying states, but in a high degree also to the others, will result from the following facts.  
  
  
  
Dollars.  
  
  
The whole exports of the United States, may be stated at  
25,000,000  
  
  
Great-Britain carries two-fifths of these in value, that is to say,  
10,000,000  
  
  
Freight and insurance on this in times of peace, are about twenty-two and one half per cent.  
2,250,000  
  
  
The same charges in war are very various, according to the circumstances of the war, we may say, however fifty-five per cent.  
5,500,000

## Commercial Discrimination, [14 January] 1794

me to their feelings at the present moment.  
It had been asked what ground there was for concluding, that Great-Britain would be led by the measures proposed, to change her policy towards the United States. He thought we had the best ground for relying on such an effect.  
It is well known, that when she apprehended such measures would be taken, she manifested a readiness to admit a greater reciprocity into the commerce between the two countries. A bill for the purpose was brought into the house of commons by the present minister Mr. Pitt, and would probably have passed into a law, if hopes had not sprung up that they should be able to maintain their exclusive system. Knox, an under secretary, appears from a collection of papers published by him, to have been the chief adviser in the cabinet, as Lord Sheffield was the great champion before the public, of this experiment. It was founded according to both these witnesses, on a belief—1st. That Nova-Scotia and Canada, would soon be able to feed the West-Indies, and thereby make them independent of supplies from the United States. 2dly. That the general government was so feeble that it could not execute a plan of retaliating restrictions—and, 3dly. That local interests and prejudices predominated so much among the states, that they would never even agree in making an attempt.  
It is now thoroughly understood and admitted by the most biassed judges, that the British continental colonies cannot supply the islands; that as well as the islands, they depend frequently for essential supplies on the United States. This calculation therefore has failed Great-Britain.  
The next has been completely destroyed by the change of our former frail confederacy, into a government which is found to be adequate to all its national objects. This hope has therefore in like manner failed.  
The only remaining hope that can induce Great-Britain to persevere in the plan of conduct she has adopted towards the United States, lies in the supposed difficulty of reconciling their different interests and local prejudices. The present occasion will decide whether this hope also shall be withdrawn from her; or whether she is to be inspired with fresh confidence in pursuing her own interests without a due respect either for our interests or for our rights.  
He could not but view the present as perhaps the final chance of combining the opinions and interests of the several quarters of the Union in some proper and adequate plan. If at a moment when so many occurrences conspire to unite the public councils; when the public mind is so well disposed to second all equitable and peaceable means of doing justice to our country; and when our commerce is so critically important to the vital resources of Great-Britain, it should be found that nothing can be done, he could foresee no circumstances under which success was to be expected. To reject the propositions therefore, whilst nothing better was substituted, must convey the most unfavorable impressions of our national character, and rivet the fetters on our commerce, as well as prolong other causes which had produced such injurious consequences to our country. He would not permit himself to apprehend that such would be the event of the deliberations

Our exports are not only necessaries of life  
or necessaries for mannfa&amp;ures, and there­

ought to command a good market where

secure the carriage of the whole of its ex­

in train&#x27; or hi prospect. Instead of re­  
laxations in former articles complained  
of, we suffer new and aggravated vio­

In the view which he took of the

Committee particularly to the subject  
oi navigation, of manufactures, and of  
the discrimination pr posed in the mo­  
tion hct.wecn some nations and others.  
On the suDJect of navigation, he ob­  
/ served, that we wt-r. prohibited by the  
British laws from aarrying to LI  
Britain the p&gt; countries  
from if) if ports* or our own produce

In the trade between tht U. 8. an.

prohibition; wtnist British vessels in  
:&#x27; er joyed all the prii il  
granted toother, even the most favor­  
ed natiwus in their trade Wkh.us. The  
inequality in this eaie was the more  
suiting, as it was evident, that ttie  
West Indies were dependent on the U.  
fc. for the supplies essential to them,  
and that tne circumstances which se­

plies on far oettt r terms than could be

_ta:iona, he presented a comparative  
view of the American and for. i*t,n ton­  
nage employed in the respective bran- I  
ches of it, from which it appeared, that \
the tor. ign stood to ths American as j  
follows :

It results from these facts, that in !  
prop-rtic.i as the tr- de might be di  
nished with Great Britain, and inert as­  
ed with otlur nations, woulu be tac  
probable increase of the American  
tonnage. It&#x27;ap) eared, for example,!  
that as the trad s from tin-:  
ti- Is into ti.o.e ol tr.n.c , it j  
would augment, our toi.nag. at the rate  
of ten to one.  
&#x27;i he above calculation, he said, had J  
been made out on the uucuim. ids, ot  
3790, and on the amount ot ihe tonnage i  
ent red in the several pons. A docix- &#x27;

G. Btitain, Out uugimii&#x27;ing it 111 favor  
ct the U. t&gt;. in most of tne other in­

1794.  
Proceeding to the subject of manu­  
factures, he observed, that it presented  
no compensation for the inequalities in  
the principles aud effects of the navi­  
gation system.  
We consusne British manufactures to  
double the amount of what Britain  
takes from us ; and vuadruplc the a­  
ir.ount of what she actually consumes.  
We take every thing after it has un«  
dcrgone all the profitable labrr that can  
be bestowed on it: She receives in re­  
turn, raw materials, the food of her in­  
dustry.  
We send necessaries to her: she  
sends superfluities to u-.  
Wu admit every thing she pleases to  
send us, whether of her own or alien  
production. She refuses not only our  
manufactures, but the articled we wish  
most to send her ; our wheat and flour,  
: our fish, and our salted provisions.—  
i These constitute our best staples for  
I exportation, as her manufactures con­  
-1 stitute hers.  
It appeared by an authentic document  
Ihe hid examined, that of the manufac­  
tured arti les imported in 1790, a­  
mountmg to 15,295,638 dollars, 97 cents,  
w« received trom and through Great  
j Britain, 13,965,464 dollars 95 cents.  
During the lame year, the manufac- ;  
tures imported from Fiance, the next  
great commercial country, «nd consum- j  
iug more of our produce than Great j  
j Urn tin, amounted to no more than j  
155,136 dollars and 63 cents.

It aught be sard, thatan tiui  
balance was no proof of an not m •  
trade ; that the only important Lml  
was the ultimate one oa our a  
commercr.  
That there was much truth i- thia  
general doctrine, wa%ad.ir.ifed ; at tli«  
same time it was eqfually certain, th it  
there were exceptions to it, Kirne of  
which were conceived to be applicable  
to the situation of t!ie United States.  
But whether the doctrine wereju t  
or not, as applied to the Unit:  
iit was well known, that the re.&#x27;&#x27;  
and practice of other Countries y  
governed by a contrary doctrine, in  
all of them, an unfavorable balance, to  
be paid in specie, was consit1 ■■•r&lt;rd asatj  
evil. Great Britain, in particular, had,  
always studied to prevent it ad much ;• •  
she could. What, then, may be the  
effect on the policy of a nation with  
which we have the most friendly and  
beneficial relations, when it sees the:  
balance of tiade with us not only si  
much against her, but all the specie  
that pays it, flowing immediately in&#x27;o  
the lap &gt;f her greatest rival, ilmtlur  
most bivett rate enemy.  
As to the discrimination proposed be*  
twetn nations having, and not having*  
commercial treaties with us, the prin­  
ciple was embraced by the laws of  
most, it not all, the states, while the  
regulation of trade was in their (lands.  
it had the repeated sanction of votes  
in the House of Kepresentatives, dur»  
ing the session of the present govern­  
ment at New York.  
it has b. en practised by other nations,  
and in a late instance against the U.  
States.  
it tends to procure beneficial treatielk  
from those who refuse them, by making  
them the price of enjoying an equality  
with other nations in our commerce.  
It tends, as n conciliatory preference,  
to procure better treaties irom those  
who have not refused them.  
it was a prudent consideration, in  
dispensing commercial advantages, to  
favor rather those whose friendship  
and support may be expected Jn sase of  
necessity, than those whose disposition;  
wore ft contrary aspect.—He did not  
wish to enter at present, nor at all, if  
unnecessary, into a display of the un­  
friendly features which marked toe  
policy of Great Britain towards the  
United States. He should be content  
to lay aside, at least for the present, the  
subject oi the inoians, the Aigermes,  
the spoliations, &amp;c. but he could not  
forbear remarking generally, that if  
that, or any other nation, were known  
to bear, us a settled ill-will, nothing  
could be more impolitic, than to foster  
resources which would be more likely  
to be turned against us, th*n exerted in,  
our favor.  
It had been admitted by the gentle­  
man who spoke yesterday (Mr, Smith,  
of South Carolina) to be a misfortune,  
that our trade should be so far engross*

hands of Great Britain. But tke gen­  
tleman added nothing to alleviate the  
misfortune, when be advised as to m ike.  
no efforts tor putting an end to it. The  
evils resulting from such a state of  
things, were as serious as they were  
numerous. To say nothing of sudden  
derangements from the caprice witti  
which sovereigns might be seised, there  
were casualties which might ■».■ &gt;t by  
avoidable. A general bankru  
which was a possible event, in a nation  
with which we were so connected, would  
reverberate upon us with a most dread*  
ful s&#x27;-Dck. A partial bankruptcy had  
actually and lately taken place; and  
was severely felt in our commerce*  
War is n common event, particularly  
to Great Britain, and Involves us in the«  
embarrassment* it brings on her cob&gt;»  
merce, whilst ours is so proportionately  
interwoven with it. Add the influence  
that may be convcyvd into ihenoolic  
councils by a nation directing the coarse  
of our trade by her capital, arid holding  
so great a share in our pecuniary insti­  
tutions ; and the effect that may finally  
ensue on our taste, our manners, and.

sequence, as well because the meature  
j afforded no pretext, being short of what  
was already done by Great Eritaic in  
her commercial system, as because she  
would be test sufferer from a  
stagnation of the trade, between the  
two countries if we should force on such  
a crisis.  
Her merchants would feel it. Hr  
, navigation would feel it. H&quot;f m ,nu»

jfl thelr&#x27;de bct*eert the linite&lt;h. States, &gt;  
a&gt;ul the British West Indies, the vesselsot  
, the former were under an absolute prohibi­  
tion ; whilst British vessels in that trade en­  
joyed all the privileges granted to other,  
even the most favored nations in tiieir  
trade with us. The inequality in this case  
was the more striking, as it was evident,  
that the West Indies were dependent on  
the United States, for the supplies csscnti­  
• al to them, and that the circumstances  
which secured to the United States, th;s  
advantage, enabled their vessels to trans­  
port the supplies on far better terms than  
Could be done by British vessels.  
To illustrate the policy requisite in onr  
commercial intercourse with other nations,  
he presented a comparative view of the A­  
merican St foreign tonnage employed in the  
Tevpectivc branches or it, from which it  
appeared, that the foreign stood to the A­  
merican as follows:  
•Spain, - - - - 1 &#x27;to 5,  
Portugal, - - • 1 to 6 &#x27;  
Tlie United Netherlands, - 1 to 15 !  
Denmark, - - * * 1 to 12-j  
Uussia, - - - —-;  
Fi ance, - - - - 1 to 5  
Great Britain, - - - 5 to 1  
It results from thi sc facts, that in propor­  
tion as the trade might be diminish .d with  
Great Britain, and increased with other :  
nations, would be the probable increase of i  
the American tonnage. It appeared, for :  
example, th-t as the trade might pass from •  
British channc s into those ©f France, it &#x27;  
would augment our tonnage at tiie rate of •  
ten to one.  
The above calculation, he said,had been *  
made out on the documents of 1790, and on I  
tlie amount of the tonnage entered in the j  
several ports. A document, stating the a­  
mounts of the actual tonnage in the tmt­  
£nn trade, had been just reported to that  
hoii-.e. It this, which was liable t.» some  
remarks that might hereafter be made, was •  
to be substituted, it afforded another cal­  
culation, diminishing the excess in favor  
of Great Britain, but augmenting it in fa­  
vor of the United States in most of the o­  
ther instances.  
  
--o . &#x27; I  
to the American tonnage mi gut be stated  
as follows :  
Spain 1 to 16  
Portugal 1 to 17  
U Netherlands 1 to 26  
Denmark. 1 to 15.  
Russia 1 to 14  
France 1 to between 4 and 5  
Great Britain, &gt; , to x  
nearly as &gt;  
Such a disproportion, taking even the re­  
duced one, in the navigation of Great Bri­  
tain, was the more mortifying, when the  
nature and amount of our exports arc con­  
sidered. Our expovt* are not only for the  
most part, either immediately necessaries  
of lifo, or ultimately as necessaries to ma­  
tiuficlures, necessaries i&#x27;f emp:ovment and  
l.fe to manufactures, and mu-i thence com­  
mand a sure market wherever they are  
received at all: But the picul ar bulklncss  
. cf them furnishes an advantage over me  
exports of every other country ; and parti­  
cularly over those oi G. B. if such an ad­  
vantage belonged to that nati&#x27; n,thc policy  
that governs her navigation laws, would  
probably have given the exclusive carri­  
age to her own bottoms. It is equally in  
eur power, if so selfish a principle should  
be forced upon us, to secure to « ur bottoms  
. the same mom poly ? leaving to other n: t;­  
*&gt;ns wi&#x27;h which we trade, the tx lusivc  
carriage ol their exports. The regulation  
would, to be sure, be mutuajly inconveni­  
ent ; and, by forcing the vessels cf each  
party to return empty from foreign mar­  
kets, be so far a tax on the inter&lt;ourse  
This effect, however, did not disprove the  
power in general which the character of  
our exports gave us, over the carriage of  
them, norlesson the argument drawn from  
it. Examine it in relation to G. B. The  
bulk of her exports to us, compared w?ith  
that* fours toher, is as nothing. An incon­  
siderable qualttity of shipp ing would suffice  
for hers, wh’lstouvs can load about 222.000  
tons: Including the ariic es she exports  
’from the W. Indies to this country, they  
bear no proportion.to ours. Yet in the en­  
tire trade between the U. S. .-nd the Bf­  
tish d &gt;mioion«, her tonnage is to that of  
the U. S ns 156,000 employing 9,560 sea­  
men, to 66.000 employing 3.690 seamen  
Were a rig d ixcrtion ol our right to take  
tV.aee. it wiiml extend onr tonn;.ve to222.­  
  
•00. an 1 leave t &gt; G. B. emp&#x27;oymer.t for  
much less than the actual share now enjoy­  
ed by the U. S. It cou&#x27;d not be w shed to  
i.usii matters to th;» extremity. It shewed,  
lowever, the very unequal and unfavora­  
ble f xitir.g on which the carrying trade,  
the great resource of our safety qrd res­  
pectability, wjs (laced by foreign r&lt; gnla­  
tio s, ,nd uic icuh.itiabli nesa pf peaeeable  
attempts to meli irate it. We might at least,  
in availing ourselves of the merit of our ex­  
ports, contend for such regulations as v&quot; uid  
•reverse the proportion, a d give the U. S.  
the 156.000 tonnage, and 9,360 se.irryn* in­  
stc;id of the 86 000 tonnage ai.tl 3,690 sea­  
men.  
He here adverted to the discount of 1(  
^rr cent, on die duties paid by goods i«rqM.r&lt;  
ted in American bottoms ; remarking, that  
it was not founded on the true policy nfen.  
con raging our shipping. It was net tin  
Imports, tint export-, that regut. ted tht  
quantity of tonnage—What was import  
in American vessel?, which w add other  
wise return empty, was, no doubt, alien&#x27;  
fi; to the American merchant but eouh  
•lightly only, if at all, increase the m is  
of our tonnage. The way to effect this  
was to secure exportations to America!  
bottoms.

.Speech ^delivered in the House of lie fire  
sentativet in the near 1794.  
Proceeding to the subject of mane. i&lt;*  
tores, he observed, lh t it presented n  
compensation for tbe inequalities in th  
1 principles and effects of the navigation  
teal.  
  
We consume British niMiufn turc.s to : &gt;u­  
blc the amount of what Britain L-!: • from  
us ; ami quadruple the amount cf what she  
actually comsumes.  
We take every thing nftcr it Ins order­  
gone a!| the profitable labor t*:r»t c.i;’i b&gt; be­  
st owed on it: She receives in return, raw  
materials, the food of Iter industiy.  
We send necessaries to her: she sends  
superfluities to us.  
We admit every thing v&gt;e pleases to rend  
ns, whether cf her own cr alien producti­  
on. She refuses not only our ruanufnctu; os,  
but the articles we wish most to send her;  
cur wheat and flour, our fish, and our salted  
provisions.—These constitute our best sta­  
ples for exportation, as her manufactures  
constitute hers.  
It appeared by an authentic document he  
had examined, that of the manufactured  
articles imported in 1790, amounting to  
1.5,295 638 dollars, 97 cents, we received  
lvnm and through G. Britain, 13,905,4G4  
dollars 95 cents.  
During the same year, the manufactures  
imported from France, the next great com­  
mercial country, and consuming more of our  
produce than Great Britain, amounted vo  
no more than 15 5,136 dollars and G3 cents.  
To give a fuller view of our foreign  
commerce, he stated the balances with the  
several nations of Europe and their domini­  
ons, as follow:  
Spain, 1,670,797 dollars in favor of the  
U* States.  
Portugal, 1,687,699 dollars, do.  
Unitt d Netherlands, 791,118 dollars, do.  
Sweden, 32,965 dollars, do,  
Denmark, 126,9-19 dollars against tlioU.  
Slices.  
France, 2,030,327 dollars in favor of U.  
States.  
Great Britain, 5.922,012 dollars against  
the U. States.  
This enormous balance to Great Bi itain is  
on the exports t-» her. On her consumpti­  
on, the ballance is still greater, amounting  
to nine nr ten millions: to&#x27;which again is  
♦ n Kr» Mflflpfl Iwm* t\tu id /ui #.  
  
manufactured and raw state.  
It might he said, that an unfavorable ba­  
lance was no proof of an unfavorable trade ;  
that the only important balance was the  
ultimate one on our aggregrate commerce.  
&#x27;I&#x27;iiat there was much ttuth in this gen­  
eral doctrine, was admitted ; at the s &gt;n&#x27;.e  
time it was equally certain, that there  
were exceptions to it, seme of which were  
I conceived to he applicable to the situation  
of the U. States.  
Ilul whethe r the doctrine were just or not,  
as applicable to the U. States, it was wed  
known, that the reasoning and practice of  
other countries were governed by acortra­  
rv doctr;i»e. In all of them, an unfavora­  
ble b..’ s cc to be paid in specie, was con­  
sidered as an evil. Cireat Britain, in par­  
ticular, had always studied to prevent it r.s  
much as she could. What, then, may be  
t!u* effect on the policy of:* nation with which  
wc have the most friendly and beneficial  
relations, when it sees tlm balance of trade  
, with us not only so much against her, but  
1 :: 11 the sp». r &gt; i.!: ,r. pays it, flowing immedi­  
| ntoly i to the h ;&gt; of her greatest rival, it  
! r.ot her most inveterate enemy.  
As to the disciuiiination proposed be­  
j tween nations having, and not having,com­  
mercial t: ■ tics&quot;W&#x27;d, us, the principle was  
. embraced by the law s of the most, if not

It had been admitted by the gertlenrs m

But tie* gentleman added nothing to allevi­

COG&#x27; sterling, and the number of souls ejn­  
plovod in,and supported by them, at 5 250,­  
0fr0. Supposing the U States to consume  
two and a hu!f mihini so: British manufac­  
tures, which is a moderate estimate, the  
loss of their market would deprive of sub- |  
s&#x27;s&#x27;en&#x27;-e 250,000 soul*. Add 50,000 who de­  
pend for employment on o*.ir raw materials.  
.Here are 500,000 souls, who live by our I  
j cusiom. Let them be driven to poverty and  
j despair by acts of their own government,  
and what would b« the consequence ? M ost !  
prnhabiv an acquisition nf so many useful  
citizens to the U. ?. which form the n.;fu- .  
ral asylum against the distresses ofKurope.  
But whether they should remain in discon­  
tent and wretchedness in their own coun­  
try, or se^k their fortunes in another, the  
evil would he felt by the British govern­  
ment ns equBy great, and be avoided with  
equal caution.  
It might tie. regarded, he observed; ns a 1  
  
general ruie, mat wnere one nnuon consum- i  
ed the necessaries »f life produced by ano­  
ther, the consuming nation was dependent  
on the producing one. On the other hand,  
where the coir umption consisted of super­  
fluities, the producing nation was depen­  
&gt; dvi’t • n the consuming a e. The IT States ,  
; were in the&#x27;fOrt unate situation of enjoying  
Ix.th these advantages over C». Britain, j

pyrfioitics which jdvr&gt; hre id to her people j

is under •• double dependence on the com- j  
1 tncrcc of the U. States. She dejxnds on ,  
I ibetU for what she herself tonsumes: she &gt;  
! depends on them for wlmt they consume.  
In proportion as a nation manufactures j  
luxuries, must he its disadvantages in con- &#x27;  
test of every sort with its customer*. The (  
reason is obvious. What is luxury to the 1  
consumer is a neix&#x27;sirv to the manufactu­  
re. By changing a tasliion, or disoppuinfc­

complaining of the use of strings in .tend of  
buckles in the shoe&#x27;, and upplicating his  
royal highness as giviug the law to fashions,  
to save them from want and misery, by  
discontinuing the new one. It was n »t, he  
observed, the prince who petitioned the  
manufacturers to continu“ to make the  
buckles, but the manufacturers wlib petiti­  
nned/their customer to buy them. The re­  
lation was similar between the American  
customers and the British manufacturers.  
And if a law were to pass for putting a  
stop to their superfluities, or a stop were  
otherwise to be potto it, it would quickly  
be seen from which the distress and suppli­  
cations would flow.  
Suppose th t G Brr tin recived from us  
alone the whole of the necessaries she con­  
sumes ; ami that our m «rkt r alone tookcfF  
the luxuries with which she paid for them.  
Here the. dependence would be complete ;  
ami we might impose whatever terms we  
please on the exchange. This tube sure is  
not absolutely the case ; but in proportion  
as it is the case, her dependence is on u«.  
The West Tndies however are an exnm­  
pie of complete dependence. They can- &#x27;  
no&#x27;, subsist without our food. They cannot  
flourish without our lumber, and our use of  
their rum. On the o&lt;he; list d we depend  
on them for not a single necessary, ami can  
supply ourselves with *heir luxuries from  
itlicr sources. Sugar is the only article a­  
out which there w.is ever a question, and  
he w »s authorised to say, that there w is not  
at the most, one &gt;ixih of our consumption  
supplied from the Briti h Islands.  
In timeof war or famine the dependence  
uf the West-In lies is felt in all its energy.  
It is •onn-times s-;cli as to appeal to our hu­  
mani v .is v/t 11 as our interest for relief.  
At this moment, th© governor of Jamaica,  
• s m king a proclamation of their distves­  
svs. If ever therefore there was a ease  
  
where one country con’d dictate to another  
the regulations of trade between them, it  
is the c»sc of the United States and the  
British VVest-Tnuies. And yet the gentle­  
in tn from South Carolina (Mr. Smith) had  
considered it as a favor that we were s.l­  
lowed to sendour provisions in British bot­  
toms and in these only, tn the West* Indies.  
1 he favor reduced to plu:n language i:i the  
mouth of their planters, would run thus :  
We will agree to buy yur providoua. rath. r  
than starve, and let y.-u have our rum,  
wli&#x27;ch we can sell no wheivtUe ; but we re­  
serve out of this indulgence a monopoly of  
tne earn ;ge to British vessels.  
With reg:rd tn revenue, the British re­  
sumes were extremely exhausted in  
r nip rison w.t those of the U. States.  
i :ie people of Cl. Britain were taxed at  
the rate or 40s. a head ; the people of the  
Un.led States, at not more than 6s. a head  
—less than one sixth of the Brit «.h t..x.  
As the price of labor which pays the tax, is  
douoic in the United .States to wiiat it is in  
breal Britain, the burden on American  
citizens is less than one-twelfth of the bur­  
den on British subjects.  
It is true iuuccd tnat Britain alone does  
not bear the whole burden, bne leaves in­  
direct taxes on her \\ est-Indics and on ncr  
Blast Indies ; audde.ivcs »rom an acqui­  
escence in her monopolising regulations, an  
| imperceptible tribute from die wiioie com­  
mercial world.  
! Slid however the difference of bmden  
i in tne two countries is immense.  
| Britain ims mol cover great arrears of  
uiiiunccd debts. She is threatened wun  
detects m her revenue even .*t tins time.  
is engaged in an expulsive war. And  
! she r iii.es ilie supp »cs ior u on tlie most  
expensive terms.  
Add to the wnole that her population is  
: stationary il not diminishing, whilst that

“ I&#x27;lie next ground on which lie examin­  
ed iiie subject was its opt ration among the  
several putts of the union. It was aumit­  
led anti regretted, that the immediate ben­  
efits utid burdens wou.tl not be equally dis­  
&#x27; tnbuted among ud the states wiure than  
&#x27; a due share ol the torii.er would flow to the  
Jnorthern division: more than a due share  
jot the tail r would tall on the souuicrn.  
1 his was unavoidably produced by the un­  
e.|tidi advances made in manufactures and  
navigation; and it w as an inconvenience  
that Had necessarily taken place m a van­  
el) ot oilier instancefl. it would be found,  
However, on a fair attention to the subject,  
ilia*, me inequality Wou.d be less than at  
Inst appeared.  
With respect to manufactures, the south­  
ern slatts were at least equally interested  
m encouraging ami distributing u compe­  
tition I n&#x27; our market, among different na­  
tions ot K&gt;ctope, instead of being so much  
in the h .mis ot a s.ngie one.  
i ue duty on me tinvr articles imported  
would tail on those most able, to bear it ;  
aim would be pretty equally did&#x27;used through  
me union.  
&#x27;i lie duty on the coarser articles would  
be vtVcd in proportion to tne progress madt  
m manufactures among uurselvts; uud ht  
was aide to say, with great pleasure, tha  
those carried on, not in puolic factor ies, bm  
in the household or family way, which In  
re guided as the must important w..y, wtri  
nearly, if not quite as far advanced in tin  
i.southern country as in tiic middle and nor  
j thern. Virginia was proceeding with ei ea  
| spirit in tluu Lruncli at industry. JNorti  
  
1 Caroling he understood was doing the si me  
*&#x27;td there was no reason whv ilie mort  
i ’Utlieru stufcs woo&#x27;d not ivail theptr.eh’c.&#x27;  
•f the resource, especially as they er.joyet  
superior advantages in Mic article of cotton  
a primary material for tin- Intsmess.  
The exports would not he materially af­  
*ected, unless Great Britain should, con­  
■ vary to all probahility, rcnoi. ice&#x27;the bene­  
fits o&lt;‘ the tr .de *•&gt; tltctn, a.. 1 expose her  
I Vest Tnd a is .i.d- to the uar.gcr of famine ;  
•nd in that casu, the inconveniences would  
•tot be local, ’*»? general.  
Even in the article of tonnage, the ine­  
quality at present, though considerable,  
was not so great as lie had imagined, be­  
fore he examined the re »i state of it It  
appeared, from the official reports lately  
tpnde on that sohjt Ct. that the states south  
of Pennsylvania (which has about her due  
-hare) have within • one-third of their due  
[quota. Georgia has more than her share.  
South Carolina nearly lirr share. North  
Carolina hastlirec-eighths below her share.  
1 Virginia has about li ilf her share. Mary­  
land has more than her share. Delaware  
less than her share.  
This competition is not, perhaps very ac­  
curate. became it is founded on the rela­  
tive population of the states. It should ra­  
ther have reference to the value and vo­  
lume of the produce exported from the se­  
veral states : But as several of them car­  
ry on their trade through their .neighbors,  
this nde of calculation would, in fact be  
mere uncertain than the other.  
Whatever be tbe rule, Virginia, he re­  
marked. was the sta&#x27;p that appeared most  
deficient; her exports,-both ;in value and  
bu k, being in full proportion to her popu­  
lation, and her tonnage bring more short  
of that, than could be said of any state, lie  
bad every reason notwithstanding to bc­  
i;eve, that the great body of the people of  
Virginia would cheerfully concur in any  
•temporary sacrifices that might be necessa­  
ry to vindicate cur public rights, and onr  
i commercial interests.  
| It was a consideration that ought tohave  
great weight with the southern st tes, that  
a home market for their naval stores would  
be extended by every measure favoring our  
own navigation ; and that hey must soon  
  
begin themselves to turn to rttect then na­  
tural advantage* for ship !&gt;ui cling, &#x27;.laving  
the materials on the spot, they would not  
be long in imitating their nt.rt5ir.rn bre­  
thren. North Carolina was sinvul rly fa­  
vored in this particular. &#x27;1 here was not  
a single article used in the various compo­  
nent parts of a ship, wh.ch she did not pos­  
sess, or could not raise within he rself.  
Tiie capacity of tnc Un&#x27;ti d States, to  
provide with celerity for the tr .nsnoiiui  
on her produce, was s»ron ,.v attested In  
what the y had Hf&gt; c e.l before the revolution.  
In the marine of the British empire, whilst  
the United States, were part of it, the A­  
ntericunbu It ship® weie to be British bud.  
as 23 to 40 N w England furnished about  
three-fifths of the former.  
In two points of view, the southern states  
were peculiarly interested in promoting our  
navigation.  
F ist—As they are in some respects, the  
weaker part of tiie union, and have most  
wea&#x27;th exposed cm the sea, they Slave most  
need of that protection which results from  
extensive marine resources. The existence  
of these will either prevent attack, or can  
readily be turned into the means of repel,  
ling it.  
Secondly—As they have so much valuable  
and bulky produce to earn to market, it is  
their interest to possess a conveyance for  
it, that may he as little affected as possi­  
ble by the contingencies and wars of ether  
nations; and particularly of Great Britain,  
a nation which is so lVe«]l*ently at w.tr, anil  
which has so disproportionate a share in  
our carrying trade.&quot;  
“ It had been asked what ground thpre  
was for concluding, that Great Britain  
would be lead by the measures jjrcpo or&#x27;,  
to change her policy towards the U. S  
Me thought we had the best ground for i eiy­  
mg on such an effect.  
It is well known, that when the appre­  
hended such measures would be taken, she  
i manifested a readiness to admit a greater  
  
I reciprocity into the commerce between the  
II wo countries. A bill for tbe purpose* v/as  
■ brought into the House of Commons by the  
, present minister, Mr Pitt, and won d pro­  
fitably have passed into a law, it&quot; hopes had  
not sprung up that they should be able t  
maintain their exclusive system. Kno::,ai  
under secretary, appears from a collcciien  
Iof papers published by him, to have beet

The consequences of this navigation act of Great Britain, are obvious.  
In a speech delivered in the house of representatives, on the 14th of Jan-  
uary, 1794, by James Madison, of Virginia, in support of his propositions  
for the promotion of the commerce of the United States, he remarked  
that, “to illustrate this observation, he referred to the navigation act of  
Great Britain; which, not being counterbalanced by any similar acts on  
the part of rival nations, had secured to Great Britain no less than eleven-  
twelfihs of the shipping and seamen employed in her trade. It is stated  
that, in 1660, when the British act passed, the foreign tonnage was, to the  
British, as one to four; in 1700, less than one to six; in 1725, as one to  
nineteen ; in 1750, as one to twelve; in 1774, nearly the same. At the  
commencement of the period, the tonnage was but ninety-five thousan

In that speech. Mr. Madison, “professed him­  
self to lm a friend to the theory which gives to in­  
dustry a free course, under the impulse of indi­  
vidual interest, and tlit; guidance of individual  
. sagacity, lie was persuaded that it would be  
happy for all nations, if the harriers erected by  
prejudice, by avarice, and hy despotism, were  
broken down, and a free intercourse established  
among tin m. Yet to this a.s to all otlu r general  
rules, there might he exceptions, and the rule it­  
self required what did not exist, that IT should  
BE GENERAL.”  
As an illustration, “lie mentioned the case  
where two countries liappr ned to ho in such a re­  
lation to each other, that the one, by discouraging  
lllf! manufactures of the other might NOT ONLV  
invigorate its own, bill transplant the manufac- j  
turers themselves. Here tlm gain would ho a  
clear one, and the effect evidently consistent with  
the principle of the theory.  
“To allow trade to regulate itself,is not,there­  
fore, to be admitted as a maxim universally sound. |  
Our own experience has taught us, that, in cer­  
tain cases, it is the same thing with allowing  
one Nation to regulate it for another.
