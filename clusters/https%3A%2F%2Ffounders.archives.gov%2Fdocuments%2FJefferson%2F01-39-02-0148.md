To the Senate and House of Representatives  
of the United States.  
  
  
  
  
  
 When we assemble together, fellow-citizens, to consider the state of our beloved country, our just attentions are first drawn to those pleasing circumstances which mark the goodness of that being from whose favor they flow, and the large measure of thankfulness we owe for his bounty. another year has come around, and finds us still blessed with peace and friendship abroad, law, order and religion at home, good affection &amp; harmony with our Indian neighbors, our burthens lightened, yet our income sufficient for the public wants, and the produce of the year great beyond example. these, fellow citizens, are the circumstances under which we meet: and we remark with special satisfaction those which, under the smiles of providence, result from the skill, industry &amp; order of our citizens, managing their own affairs in their own way, &amp; for their own use, unembarrassed by too much regulation, unoppressed by fiscal exactions.   
  
  
Discriminating duties.  
 On the restoration of peace in Europe, that portion of the general carrying trade, which had fallen to our share during the war, was abridged by the returning competition of the belligerent powers. this was to be expected and was just. but, in addition, we find, in some parts of Europe, monopolising discriminations, which, in the form of duties, tend effectually to prohibit the carrying thither our own produce in our own vessels. from existing amities, and a spirit of justice, it is hoped that friendly discussion will produce a fair &amp; adequate reciprocity. but should false calculations of interest defeat our hope, it rests with the legislature to decide whether they will meet inequalities abroad with countervailing inequalities at home, or provide for the evil in any other way.  
  
  
British Countervail.  
 It is with satisfaction I lay before you an act of the British parliament anticipating this subject, so far as to authorise a mutual abolition of the duties and countervailing duties, permitted under the treaty of 1794. it shews on their part a spirit of justice and friendly accomodation, which it is our duty and our interest to cultivate with all nations. whether this would produce a due equality in the navigation between the two countries, is a subject for your consideration.  
  
  
Seamen  
 Another circumstance which claims attention, as directly affecting the very source of our navigation, is the defect or the evasion of the law providing for the return of seamen, &amp; particularly of those belonging to vessels sold abroad. numbers of them, discharged in foreign ports, have been thrown on the hands of our Consuls, who, to rescue them from the dangers into which their distresses might plunge them, &amp; to save them to their country, have found it necessary in some cases, to return them at the public charge.   
  
  
Louisiana.  
 The cession of the Spanish province of Louisiana to France, which took place in the course of the late war, will, if carried into effect, make a change in the aspect of our foreign relations, which will doubtless have just weight in any deliberations of the legislature connected with that subject.  
  
  
Tripoli  
 There was reason, not long since, to apprehend that the warfare in which we were engaged with Tripoli might be taken up by some other of the Barbary powers. a reinforcement therefore was immediately ordered to the vessels already there. subsequent information however has removed these apprehensions for the present. to secure our commerce in that sea, with the smallest force competent, we have supposed it best to watch strictly the harbour of Tripoli. still however the shallowness of their coast, &amp; the want of smaller vessels on our part, has permitted some cruisers to escape unobserved: and to one of these an American vessel unfortunately fell a prey. the Captain, one American seaman, &amp; two others of colour, remain prisoners with them; unless exchanged under an agreement formerly made with the Bashaw, to whom, on the faith of that, some of his captive subjects had been restored.   
  
  
Georgia.   
 The convention with the state of Georgia has been ratified by their legislature, and a repurchase from the Creeks has been consequently made, of a part of the Talassee county. in this purchase has been also comprehended a part of the lands within the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers. the particulars of the contract will be laid before Congress so soon as they shall be in a state for communication.   
  
  
Missipi territy   
 In order to remove every ground of difference possible with our Indian neighbors, I have proceeded in the work of settling with them, and marking the boundaries between us. that with the Choctaw nation is fixed in one part, &amp; will be through the whole within a short time. the country to which their title had been extinguished before the revolution is sufficient to recieve a very respectable population, which Congress will probably see the expediency of encouraging, so soon as the limits shall be declared. we are to view this position as an Outpost of the United States, surrounded by strong neighbors, and distant from it’s support. and how far that monopoly, which prevents population, should here be guarded against, &amp; actual habitation made a condition of the continuance of title, will be for your consideration. a prompt settlement too of all existing rights &amp; claims within this territory, presents itself as a preliminary operation.  
  
  
Indiana.   
 In that part of the Indiana territory which includes Vincennes, the lines settled with the neighboring tribes fix the extinction of their title at a breadth of twenty four leagues from East to West, and about the same length, parallel with &amp; including the Wabash. they have also ceded a tract of four miles square including the Salt-springs near the mouth of that river.   
  
  
Finance.   
 In the department of finance, it is with pleasure I inform you that the reciepts of external duties, for the last twelvemonth, have exceeded those of any former year, &amp; that the ratio of increase has been also greater than usual. this has enabled us to answer all the regular exigencies of government, to pay from the treasury, within one year, upwards of eight millions of dollars, principal &amp; interest, of the public debt, exclusive of upwards of one million paid by the sale of bank stock, and making in the whole a reduction of nearly five millions and an half of principal, and to have now in the treasury four millions and an half of dollars, which are in a course of application to the further discharge of debt, and of current demands. Experience too, so far, authorises us to believe, if no extraordinary event supervenes, and the expences which will be actually incurred shall not be greater than were contemplated by Congress at their last session, that we shall not be disappointed in the expectations then formed. but nevertheless as the effect of peace on the amount of duties is not yet fully ascertained, it is the more necessary to practise every useful economy, and to incur no expence which may be avoided without prejudice.   
  
  
Internl. taxes  Reloans  
 The collection of the internal taxes having been compleated in some of the states, the officers employed in it are of course out of commission. in others they will be so shortly. but in a few, where the arrangements for the direct tax had been retarded, it will still be some time before the system is closed. it has not yet been thought necessary to employ the agent authorised by an act of the last session, for transacting business in Europe relative to debts &amp; loans. nor have we used the power, confided by the same act, of prolonging the foreign debt by reloans, and of redeeming, instead thereof, an equal sum of the Domestic debt. should however the difficulties of remittance on so large a scale, render it necessary at any time, the power shall be executed, and the money thus unemployed abroad shall, in conformity with that law, be faithfully applied here in an equivalent extinction of Domestic debt. When effects so salutary result from the plans you have already sanctioned, when, merely by avoiding false objects of expence, we are able, without a direct tax, without internal taxes, &amp; without borrowing, to make large and effectual paiments towards the discharge of our public debt, &amp; the emancipation of our posterity from that mortal canker, it is an encouragement, fellow citizens, of the highest order, to proceed as we have begun, in substituting economy for taxation, and in pursuing what is useful for a nation placed as we are, rather than what is practised by others under different circumstances. and whensoever we are destined to meet events which shall call forth all the energies of our countrymen, we have the firmest reliance on those energies, and the comfort of leaving for calls like these, the extraordinary resources of loans and internal taxes. in the mean time, by paiments of the principal of our debt, we are liberating, annually, portions of the external taxes, &amp; forming from them a growing fund, still further to lessen the necessity of recurring to extraordinary resources.   
  
  
Estimates   
 The usual account of reciepts and expenditures for the last year, with an estimate of the expences of the ensuing one, will be laid before you by the Secretary of the treasury.   
  
  
  
War deptmt  
 No change being deemed necessary in our military establishment, an estimate of it’s expences for the ensuing year, on it’s present footing, as also of the sums to be employed in fortifications, and other objects within that department, has been prepared by the Secretary at war, and will make a part of the general estimates which will be presented you.  
  
  
Militia.  
 Considering that our regular troops are employed for local purposes, and that the militia is our general reliance for great and sudden emergencies, you will doubtless think this institution worthy of a review, &amp; give it those improvements of which you find it susceptible.   
  
  
Naval estimates  
 Estimates for the naval department, prepared by the Secretary of the navy for another year, will in like manner be communicated with the general estimates. a small force in the Mediterranean will still be necessary to restrain the Tripoline cruisers: and the uncertain tenure of peace with some other of the Barbary powers, may eventually require that force to be augmented. the necessity of procuring some smaller vessels for that service, will raise the estimate: but the difference in their maintenance will soon make it a measure of economy.  
  
  
Dry dock.   
 Presuming it will be deemed expedient to expend annually a convenient sum towards providing the naval defence which our situation may require, I cannot but recommend that the first appropriations for that purpose, may go to the saving what we already possess. no cares, no attentions, can preserve vessels from rapid decay, which lie in water, &amp; exposed to the sun. these decays require great and constant repairs, and will consume, if continued, a great portion of the monies destined to naval purposes. to avoid this waste of our resources, it is proposed to add to our Navy yard here a Dock, within which our present vessels may be laid up dry, &amp; under cover from the sun. under these circumstances experience proves that works of wood will remain scarcely at all affected by time. the great abundance of running water which this situation possesses, at heights far above the level of the tide, if employed as is practised for lock navigation, furnishes the means for raising and laying up our vessels, on a dry and sheltered bed. and should the measure be found useful here, similar depositories for laying up, as well as for building and repairing vessels, may hereafter be undertaken at other navy yards, offering the same means. the plans and estimates of the work, prepared by a person of skill and experience, will be presented to you, without delay, and from these will be seen that scarcely more than has been the cost of one vessel is necessary to save the whole; and that the annual sum to be employed towards it’s completion may be adapted to the views of the legislature as to Naval expenditure.   
  
  
Conclusion  
 To cultivate peace, &amp; maintain commerce &amp; navigation in all their lawful enterprises; to foster our fisheries as nurseries of navigation &amp; for the nurture of man, and protect the manufactures adapted to our circumstances; to preserve the faith of the nation by an exact discharge of it’s debts and contracts, expend the public money with the same care and economy we would practise with our own, &amp; impose on our citizens no unnecessary burthens; to keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional powers, &amp; cherish the federal union, as the only rock of safety; these, fellow citizens, are the landmarks by which we are to guide ourselves in all our proceedings. by continuing to make these our rule of action, we shall endear to our countrymen the true principles of their constitution, and promote an union of sentiment and of action, equally auspicious to their happiness and safety. on my part you may count on a cordial concurrence in every measure for the public good; and on all the information I possess which may enable you to discharge to advantage the high functions with which you are invested by your country.

without internal taxej, and without bar  
rowing, to make larp-e -and effectual pcy  
merits toward the difcharge of our public  
debt, and the emancipation of our poftcricy  
from that tac.rtal canker,,, it is an encaurafjc

we are deftinvd to meet events which rtiall  
call forth all the energies of onrcountiy­  
men, we have the firmtlt reliance of thofe  
energies, and the comfjit of leaving lor  
cl!s like tlufe, the extraordinary tefourcts  
of loans and internal taxes. In t!ie mean  
time, by payments of the principal of our  
debt, weave liberating, annually, portions  
of the external taxes, and forming., from  
them a growing fund, Hill further to klfjii  
the nteefiiiy of recurring to csiraoidmary  
Tefources.  
The ufual account of receipts and ex  
penditures for the la it year, with an ettimate

Secretary of War, aud will make a part cf

Confidering that our regular troops are

Eftimates for the navaf department, pre­

. Prefacing it will be deemed expedient  
to expend- annually a convenient fum to

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
To TaE SENATE axp Hovse or Re­  
- PRISENTATIVES OF THE UNITED  
STATES. ;  
W HEN we assemble together,  
fellow-citizens, to confider the  
state of our beloved country, our just  
attenticns are fir® drawn to those  
pleasing circumstances which mark  
the goodness of that Being from whose  
favor they flow,and the large measure  
of thankfulnefs we owe for his bounty.  
Another year -has come round, and  
finds us still blefled with peace and  
friendfhip abroad, law, order and re­  
ligion at home, good affection and  
harmony with our Indian neighbors,  
and our burthens lightened ; yet our  
income {ufficient for the public wants,  
and the produce of the year great be­  
yond example. These, fellow citizens,  
are the circumstances under which we  
meet ; and we remark with special fat­  
isfaction, those which under the smiles  
of Providence, result from the skill,  
industry and order of our citizens,  
managing their own affairs in their  
own way, and for their own use, un­  
embarrafled by too much regulations,  
unopprefled by fifcal exaéions.  
On the restoration of peace in Eu­  
rope, that portion of the carrying  
trade which had fallen to our sot dur­  
ing the war, was abridged by the re­  
turning competition of the belligerent  
powers, This was to be expeced and  
was jult. But, in addition we find,  
in some parts of Europe, monopoliz­  
ing discriminations, which, in the form  
of duties, tend effe@ually to prohibit  
the carrying thither our own produce  
in our own veflels.—From existing  
amities apnd a spirit of justice, it is hop­  
ed that friendly discussion will pro­  
duce a fair and adequate reciprocity.  
&#x27; Bat should falle calculations of inter­  
est defeat our hope, it rests with the  
legislature to decide whether they will  
meet inequalities abroad with coun­  
tervailing inequalities at home, or pro­  
vide for the evil in any other way.  
It is with fatisfaétion I lay before  
“you an a&amp; of the Britith Parliament  
anticipating this fabject, so far as to  
authorife a mutual abolition of the du­  
ties and countervailing duties, permit­  
ted under the treatyof 1794. It thews  
on‘ their part a spirit of justice and  
friendly aecommodation, which it is  
our duty and our interest to cultivate  
with all nations. Whether this would  
- produce a due equality in the naviga.  
- tion between the two countries, is 4  
- fubje&amp; for your consideration. i  
- Another ¢ircamftance which claims  
attention, as dire@ly affe@ing the very  
source of our navigation, is the defeét  
~or the evasion of the law providing  
for the return of feartien, and particn.  
Tarly of those belonging to vefls fld.  
‘abroad. Nambers of them, difcharg.  
-ed in foreign ports have, been thrown  
on the hands of our Consuls, who, to  
medﬂ‘ﬂﬁm  
  
have fotnd it necefiry, In foite cases  
- to return them at the public charge:  
The cession of the Spanith province  
of Louisiana to France, which took  
Place in the course of the late war,  
will, if carried into effe@, make g  
change in the afpe&amp;t of our foreign  
- relations, which will doubtless have  
&#x27; jutt weight in the deliberations of the  
legislature conneted with that fubje&amp;.  
. There was reason, not long since, to  
i apprehend that the warfare in which  
i wWe were engaged with Tripoli, might  
be taken up by some other of the Bar­  
bary powers. A reinforcement,there.  
fore, was immediately ordered to the  
veflels already there. Subsequent in­  
formation however has removed these  
apprehensions for the present. To se­  
cure our commerce in that sea, with  
the smallest force competent, we have  
supposed it best to watch strictly the  
harbor of Tripoli. Still, hewever the  
{hallownefs of their coast, and the  
want of {maller veflels on our part,  
has permitted some cruisers to eicape  
unobserved—and to one of these an  
American veflel unfortunately fell a  
prey. The captain, one American  
seaman, and two others of color, re­  
main prisoners with them ; unless ex.  
changed under an agreement formerly  
made with the bathaw, to whom, on  
the faith of that, some of his captive  
{ubjects had been restored.  
&quot;T&#x27;he Convention with the state of  
Georgia has been ratified by their le­  
gislature, and a repurchase from the  
creeks has been consequently made, of  
a part of the Tallaflee county. In  
this purchase has been alio comipre­  
hended a part of the lands within the  
fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee riv­  
ers. &#x27;The particulars of the contract  
will be laid, before Congress so soon as  
they shall be in a state for communica­  
tion. |  
In order to remove every ground  
of difference peflible with our Indian  
neighbors, I have proceeded in the  
work of fettling with them, and mark­  
ing the boundaries between us. That  
with the Choftaw nation is fixed in  
one part, and will be through the  
whole within a thort time. The coun.  
try to which their title has been ex­  
tinguished before the revolution is fuf­  
ficient to receive a very refpeétable  
population, which Congress will pro­  
bably fee the expediefcy of encourag­  
ing, so soon as the limits shall be de­  
clared. We are to view this position  
as an Outpost of the United States,  
surrounded by strong neighbors, and  
distant fiom its support. And how  
far that monopoly, which prevents  
population, should here be guarded a­  
gainst, and actual habitation made a  
condition of the continuance of title,  
will be for your consideration. A  
prompt settlement too of all existing  
rights and claims within this territory,  
presents itfelf as a preliminary opera­  
tion.  
In that part of the Indians territo­  
ry which includes Vincennes, the lines  
fettled with the neighboring tribes fix  
the extin&amp;ion of their title at a breadth  
of twenty-four leagues from East to  
Weft, and about the fame length pa­  
rallel with and including the Wabash.  
They have also ceded a tra&amp; of four  
miles {quare, including the Salt-  
Springs near the mouth of that river.  
In the department of finance it is  
with pleasure I inform you that the  
receipts of external daties, for the last  
twelve months, have exceeded those of  
any former year, and that the ratio of  
increase has been also greater than u­  
sual. This has enabled us to answer  
all the regular exigencies of govern­  
ment, to pay from the Treasury,  
within one year, upwards of eight  
millions of dollars, principal and in­  
terelt, of the public debt, exclusive of  
- upwards of one million paid by the  
sale of bank stock, and making in the  
~ whole a reduéion of nearly five mil­  
lions and an half of principal, and to  
have now in the treasury four millions  
- and an half of dollars, which are in a  
-course of application to the further  
discharge of debt, and “ctitrent “de­  
mands. Experience too, so far au­  
_thorifes us to believe, if no extraordi­  
~ nary event supervenes, and the expen­  
~ ces which will be a&amp;ually incurred  
shall not be greater than were contem­  
plated by Congress at their last ses­  
sion, that we shall not be disappointed  
in the expeations then formed. But  
nevertheless, as the effe&amp; of peace on  
the amount of -duties is not yet fully­  
alcertained, it is the more neceflary to  
pradlife every ufeful economy, and to  
_incur no expence, which may be avoid­  
ed without prejudice. ;  
The colle&amp;ion of the internal taxes  
~having been completed in some of the  
fates, the officers employed in it are of  
course out of commuflion. . In others  
they will be so shortly. Butin afew,

tax had been retarded, it will flill be  
-some time before the system is closed.

without borrowing, to make large and  
effectual payments towards the dis­  
charge of our public debt, and the  
emancipation of our posterity from  
that mortal canker, it is an encon.  
agement, fellow-citizens, of the high.  
et order, to procesd as we havye begun  
in substituting cconomy for taxation,  
and in pursuing what is ufeful for a  
nation placed as we are, rather than  
what is practifed by others under dis.  
ferent circumstances, And when{o­  
ever we are deltined to meet events  
which shall call forth all the energies  
of our countrymen, we have the firm.  
elt reliance on those energies, and the  
comfort of leaving for calls like these,  
the extraordinary sources of loans and  
internal taxes. . In the mean time, by  
payments of the principal of our debt,  
we are liberating, annually, portions  
of the external taxes, and forming  
from them a growing fund, still fur.  
ther to leflen the neceflity of recur: ing  
to extraordinary resources.  
“The usual account of receipts and  
expenditures for the last year, with an  
estimate of the expences of the ensuing  
one, will be laid before you by the se­  
cretary cf the treasury. ‘  
No change being deemed neceflary  
in our military eflablifhment, an esti­  
mate of its expences for the ensuing  
year, on its present footing, as also of  
the sums to be employed in the fortifi­  
cations and other obje&amp;s within that  
department, has been prepared by the  
Secretary at War, and will make a  
part of the general eflimates which  
will be presented you.  
Considering that our regular troops  
are employed for local purposes, and  
that the militia is our general reliance  
for great and sudden emergencies, you  
will doubtless think this institution  
worthy of a review, and give it those  
improvements of which you find it  
susceptible.  
Estimates for the naval department  
prepared by the secretary of the navy  
for another year, will in like man­  
ner be communicated with the  
general estimates. © A small force  
i the Mediterranean will fill be  
mneceflary to restrain the Tripoline  
cruisers : and the uncertain tenure of  
peace with some other of the Barbary  
powers, may eventually require that  
force to be augmented. The neceflity  
of procuring some smaller veflels for  
that service will raise the estimate 2  
but the difference in their maintenance  
will soon make it a measure of eecon«  
omy. |  
  
~_ Presuming it will be deemed expe­  
dient to expend annually a convenient  
{fum towards providing the naval de­  
fence which our situation may require,  
&#x27; I cannot but recommend that the firft  
- appropriationsforthat purpofe,maygo  
to the saving what we already possess.  
- No cares, no attentions, can preserve  
veflels from rapid decay, which lie in  
water and exposed to the fun. These  
decays require great and constant re­  
pairs, &amp; will consume, if continued, 2  
great portion of the monies destined  
fornaval purposes. Toavoid this walte  
of our refourees, it is proposed to add  
to our navy yard here a dock, within  
which our present veflels may be laid  
up dry, and under cover from the fun.  
Under these circumftanees, experience  
proves that works of wood will remain’  
scarcely at all affected by time. Tl{ﬁ  
great abundance of running water:  
which this situation pofleffes, at heights  
far above the level of the tide, if em­  
ployed as is praétifed for lock naviga­  
tion, furnifhes the means for ra)hgng  
and laying up our veffelson a dry an  
sheltered bed. And should the mea­  
sure be found ufeful here, similar de­  
pofitaries for laying up, as well for  
building and repairing veflels, may  
hereafter be undertaken at other navy  
yards ‘offering the fame means. THhe  
plans &amp; estimates of the work prepar­  
ed by a person of skill and experience,  
will be presented to you, without de­  
lay, and from these it will be seen, that  
scarcely more than has been the cost  
-of one veflel is necessary to save the  
whole, and that the annual sum tobe  
employed towards its completion may  
be adapted to the views of the legisla­  
ture as to naval expenditure.  
&#x27;~ To cultivate - peace and maintain  
commerce and navigation in all their

TATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.  
  
WHEN we affemble together, fellow-cit-  
izens, to confider the ftate of our beloved  
country, our juftattentions are firft drawn to  
thofe pleafing circumftances which mark the  
goodnefs ot that being from whofe favor  
they flow, and the large meafure of thank.  
fulnefs we owe for his bounty. Another  
year has come around, and finds us ftill

bors, our burthens lightened ; yet our in-  
come fufficient for the public wants, and

On the reftoration of peace in Europe that  
portion of the carrying trade, which had  
fallen to our fhare during the war, was a-  
abridged by the returning competition of the  
belligerent-powers. This was to be expeét-

in fome parts of Europe, monopolizing dif-  
criminations, which, in the form of duties,  
tend effeétually to probibit the carrying thith-  
er our Own produce in our own veffels.—

: » it refis with the legiflature to de-  
&quot;whether they will meet inequalities a-  
broad «with countervailing inequalities at  
hétne; or provide for the evil in any other  
  
It is with fatisfaftion I lay betore you an  
aft of the Britifh parliament anticipating this  
fubjeét, fo far as to authorife a mutual aboli-  
tion of the duties and countervailing duties,  
permitted under the treaty of 1794. It fhews  
on their part a f{pirit of juftice and friendly ac-  
commodation, which it is our duty and our  
intereft to cultivate with all nations. Wheth-  
er this would produce a due equality in the  
navigation between the two countries, is a  
fubje&amp; for your confideration.  
  
Another circumftance which claims atten-  
tion, as dire€tly affecting the fource of our  
navigation, is the defeét or the evafion of the  
law providing for the return of feamen, and  
particularly of thofe belonging to veflels fold  
abroad. Numbers of them, difcharged in  
foreign ports, have been thrown on the  
hands of our Confuls, who, to refcue them  
from the dangers into which their diftreff-  
es might plunge them, and fa¥e them to their  
country, have found it neceffary, in fome  
cafes, to return them at the public charge.  
  
The ceflion of the Spanilh province of  
Louifiana to France, which took place in  
the courfe of the late war, will, if carried  
into effe&amp;t, make a change in the afpeét of  
our foreign relations, which will doubtlefs  
have juft weight in any deliberations of the  
legiflature conneéted with that fubjeét.  
  
There was reafon, not long fince, to appre-  
hend that the warfare in which we were en-  
gaged with Tripoli, might be taken up by  
fome other of the Barbary powers. A re-  
intorcement, therefore, was immediately or-  
dered to the veffels already there. Subfe-  
quent information however has removed thefe  
apprehenfions for the prefent. To fecure  
our commerce in that fea, with the f{malleit  
force competent, we have {uppofed it beft  
to watch ftri€tly the harbour of Tripoli.—  
  
* Still; however, the fhallownefs ef their coaft,  
and the want of fmaller veffels on our part,  
has permitted fome cruifers to efcape unob-  
ferved ; and to one of thefe an American  
veffel fell a prey. The captain, one Amer-  
ican feaman, and two others of colour, re-  
main prifoners with them ; unlefs exchang-  
ed under an agreement formeriy made with  
the Bafhaw, to whom, on the faith of that,  
fome of his captive fubjeéts had been refto-  
red.  
  
The ConvENTION with the State of Geor-  
gia has been ratified by their legiflature, and  
a repurchafe from the Creeks has been con-  
fequently made, of a part of the Tallaffcee  
country. In this purchafe has been alfo com-  
prehended a part of the lands within the fork  
of Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers. The  
rparticulars of the contraé will be laid before  
Congrefs fo {oon as they fhall be in a ftate for

In order to remove ag hes ground of differ-  
ence poflible with our Indian neighbours, I  
have proceeded in the work of fettling with  
them, and marking the boundaries between  
us. That with the Cho€taw nation is fixed  
in one part, and will be through the whole  
in a fhort time. The country to which their  
title had been extinguifhed before the revo-  
lution is fufficient to receive a very ref{petta-  
ble population, which Congrefs will proba-  
bly fee the expediency of encouraging, fo  
foon as the limits fhall be declared. We are  
to view this pofition as an Outpolt of the U-  
nited States, furrounded by ftrong neigh-  
bours, and diftant from its fupport. And  
how far that monopoly, which prevents pop-  
ulation, fhould here be guarded againit, and  
a€tual habitation made a condition of the  
continuance of title, will be for your con-  
fideration. A prompt fettlement too of all  
exifting rights and claims within this territory,  
prefents itfelf as a preliminary operation.  
  
In that part of the Indian territory which  
includes Vincennes, the lines fettled with  
the neighbouring tribes fix the extinétion of  
their title at a breadth of twenty-four leagues  
from Eaftto Weft, and about the fame length  
parallel with and including the Wabafh.—  
They have alfo ceded a tra€&amp;t of four miles  
fquare, including the Salt-Springs near the  
mouth of that river.  
  
In the department of finance it is with  
pleafure I inform you that the receipts of  
external duties, for the left twelve months,  
have exceeded thofe of any former year, and  
that the ratio of increafe has been alfo greater  
than ufwal. This has enabled us to anfwer  
all the exigencies of government, to pay from  
the Trealury, within one year, upwards of  
eight millions of dollars—principal and in-  
tereft, of the public debt, exclufive of up.  
wards of one million paid by the fale of bank  
ftock, and making in the whole a reduétion  
of nearly five millions and a halt of princi-  
pal, and to have now in the treafury four  
millions and an half of dollars, which are in  
a courfe of application to the further dif-  
charge of debt, and current demands. Ev-  
  
erience too, fo far, authorizes us to believe,  
if no extraordinary event fupervenes, and  
the expences which will be a€tually incurred  
fhall not be greater than were contemplated  
by Congrefs at their lait feffion, that we fhall  
not be difappointed in the expe€tatiens then  
formed, But neverthelefs, as the effe&amp; ot  
peace on the amount of duties is not yet fully  
afcertained, it isthe more neceflary to praétife  
every ufeful economy, and to incur no ex-  
pence, which may be avoided without prej-  
udice.  
  
The colleétion of the internal taxes having ,  
been compleated in fome of the ftates, the |  
officers employed in it are of courfe out of |  
commiflion. In others they will be fo fhortly. 1  
But ina few, where the arrangements for the |  
direét tax had been retarded, it will fill be |  
  
  
  
  
  
fome time before the fyftem is clofed. It has |  
  
  
  
  
  
not yet been thought neceflary to employ the  
agent authorifed by an aét of the laft fcffion,  
tor tranfa€ting bufinefs in Europe relative to  
debts and loans. Nor have we uled the  
power, confided by the fame aft, of prolong-  
ing the foreign debt by reloans, sale of re-  
deeming inftead thereof, an equal fum of the  
Domeltic Debt. Should however the dif.  
ficulties of remittance on fo large a feale,  
render it neceflary at any time, the power  
fhall be executed, and the money thus un-  
employed abroad fhall, in conformity with  
that law, be faithtuliy applied here in an  
equivalent extin&amp;tion of Domeftic Debt.  
When effeéts fo fulutary refult from the plans  
you have already fanétioned, when ne by  
avoiding falle objeéts of expence, we are able,  
without a direé&amp;t tax, without internal taxes,  
and without borrowing, to make large and ef-  
fe€tual payments towards the difcharge of  
our public debt, and the emancipation of our  
pofterity from that iijprtal canker, it isan en-  
couragement, fellow citizens, of the higheft  
order, to proceed as we have begun in fub-  
ftituting economy for taxation, and in pur-  
fuing what is ufetul for a nation placed as we  
are, rather than what is praétifed by others  
under different circumflances. And when-  
foever we are deftined to meet events which  
thall call forth all the energies of our coun-  
t:ymen, we have the firmeft reliance on thofe  
energies, and the comfort of leaving for calls  
like thefe, the extraordinary refources of  
loans and internal taxes. In the mean time,  
by payments of the principal of our debt, we  
are liberating, annually, portions of the ex-  
ternal taxes, and forming frdm them a grow-  
ing fund, ftill further to leffen the neg tity  
  
of recurring to extraordinary refourc

ditures for the lait year, with an ellimate of

ry. ae  
  
No change being deemed neceffary in our  
military eftablifhment an eftimate of its ex  
pences for the enfuing year, on its p  
footing, as alfo of the furs, emp  
fortifications, and other objetts with  
department, has been prepared by the &amp;  
tary at War, and will make a part ofthe gen-  
eral eftimates which will be prefented you.  
  
*  
  
Confidering that our regular troops are em-  
ployed for local purpofes, and that the militia  
is our general] reliance tor great and fudden  
emergencies, you will doubtlefs think this  
inftitut on worthy of a review, and give it  
thofe improvements of which you find it fuf.  
ceptible,  
  
Eftimates for the naval department, pre-  
pared by the Secretary of the Navy for ano-  
ther year, will in like manner be communi-  
cated with the general eftimates. A fmalf  
force in the Mediterrarean will ftill be ne-  
ceffary to reftrain the Tripoline cruifers ;  
and the uncestain tenure of peace with fome

fhe Balance.  
  
For 1803  
  
  
  
  
  
; other of the Barbary powers, may eventually  
| require that force to be augmented. The  
neceflity of procuring fome {maller vetlels for  
that fervice, will raifethe eftimate: but the  
difference in their maintenance will foon  
make it a meafure of economy.  
  
,  
  
Prefuming it will be deemed expedient to  
expend annually a convenient fum towards  
providing the naval defence which our fitua-  
aion may require, I cannot but recommend  
that the firft appropriations for that purpofe,  
  
: may goto the faving what we already poffefs.  
No cares, no attentions, can preferve veffels  
{rom rapid decay, which lie in water, and ex-  
pofed to the fun. Thele decays require  
eat and. conf{lant repairs, and will confume,  
if continued, a great portion of the monies  
deftined to naval purpofes. To avoid this  
walte of our refources, it is propofed to add  
ty our mavy-yard here a Dock within which  
eur prefent vellels may be laid up dry, and  
under cover tromthe jan. Under thefe cir-  
cumflances experien roves that works of  
wood will remain {carcely at all affefled by  
time. The great abundance of running wa-  
ter which this fituation poffefles, at heights  
far above the level of the tide, if employed as

To the Senate, and Houfe of Reprefenta  
tives of the United States.  
WHEN we aflemble together,  
fellow citizens, to confider  
the ftate of our beloved country, our  
juft attentions are firft drawn to thofk  
pleafing circumftances which mark  
the goodnefs of that Being from whole  
favor they flow, and the large mealure  
of thankfulnels we owe for his bounty.  
Another vear has come around, and  
finds us flill bleffcd with peace and  
friend(hip abroad, law, order and re­  
ligion at home, good affection and  
harmony with our Indian neighbors,  
our burthens lightened ; yet our in­  
come fufliciecnt for the public wants,  
and the produce of the year great be­  
yond example. Thele, fellow: citi­  
zens, are the circumftances under  
which we meet ; and we remark with  
fpecial atisfaction thofe which, under  
thedmiles of providcnce,refult fromthe  
fii:ll, induftry &amp; order of our citizens,  
managing their own affairs in their  
own way, and for their own ule, un­  
embarrafied by too much regulation,  
unopprifled by fifcal exalions.  
On the reftoration of peace in  
Furope, that portion of the carrying  
trade, which had fallen to our fhare  
during the war, was abridged by the  
returning competition of the bellige­  
rent powers, I&#x27;his was to be expected  
and was juft. But, in addition we  
find, in fome parts of Europe, mono­  
polizing dilcriminations, which, in the  
form of duties, tend effectually to pro­  
hibit the carrying thither our own  
produce in_our own veflels. Trem  
exilling amities and a fpirit of juflice,  
it is hoped that friendly difcullion  
will produce a fair and adequate reci­  
procity. But fhould falle calculations  
of intereft defeat our hope, it reits with  
the legillature to decide whether they  
will meet inequalities abroad with  
countervailing inequalities at home,  
or provide for the evil in any other  
  
way.  
$ It is with fatisfattion I lay before  
you an alt of the Britifh parliament  
anticipating this fubje&amp;, fo far as to  
suthorife a mutual abolition of the  
duties and countervailing duties, per­  
mitted under the treaty of 1794. It  
{hews on their part a fpirit of juftice  
and {riendly accommodation, which it  
is our duty and our intereft to cultivate  
with all nations. Whether this would  
produce a due equality in the naviga.  
tion between the two countries, is a  
fubjed for your confideration.  
Another circumitance, which  
claims attention, as direétly affecting  
the vcrly fource of our navigation, is  
the defe@ or the evafion of the law  
providing for the return of feamen,  
and particularly of thofe belonging to  
vellels fold abroad. Numbers of  
them, difcharged in foreign ports,  
have been thrown on the hands of gur  
Confuls, who, to refcue them from the  
dangers into which their diftrefies  
“might plunge them, and fave them to  
their country, have found it neceflary,  
in fome cales, to return them at the  
public charge.  
The ceflion of the Spanifh pro­  
vince of Louifiana to France, wgich  
took place in the courfe of the late  
war, will, if carried into effe&amp;®, make  
a change in the alpect of our foreign  
relations, which will doubtlefs have  
iult weight in any deliberations of the  
Lginature conne@ted with that fub-  
  
ject. .  
: There was reafon, not long fince, ‘  
to apprehend that the warfare in  
whicﬁ we were engaged with Tripoli,  
might be taken up by fome other of  
the Barbary powers. A reinforce­  
ment, therefore, was immediately or­  
dered to the veflels already there.  
  
Subfequent information however has  
removed thefe apprehenfions for the  
prefent. To fecure our commerce in  
that fea, with the fmallelt force com­  
petent, we have fuppofed it belt to  
watch ftrictly the harbour of Tripoli.  
Still, however, the thallownels of their  
coalt, and the want of fmaller veflels  
on our part, has permitied fome cmif-]  
ers 1o efcape unobferved : And to one  
of thefe an American veflel unfor.  
tunately fella prey. The captain, one  
American feaman, and two others of  
colour, remain prifoners with them ;  
unlefs exchanged under an agreement  
formerly made with the Bafhaw, to  
whomt, on the faith of that, fome of  
his captive fubjetts had been reftored.  
  
} ‘T&#x27;he ConvenTioN with the State  
;of Georgia has been ratified by their  
legiflature, and a repurchale from the  
Creeks has been confequently made,  
of a part of the Tallaflcee county. In  
this purchafe has been allo campre- |  
hend:d a part of the lands withinthe |  
fork of Oconee and Oakinulgee rivrs, |  
The particulars of the contract wil be |  
laid before Congrefs fo foon as hey |  
{hall be in a ftate for communicaton. I  
In order to remove every graind  
of difference poflible with our Jalian  
neighbours, 1 have proceeded inthe  
work of fettling with them, and nar­  
king the boundaries between us.  
That with the Chotaw nation isrlxed  
in one part, and will be throughthe  
whole within a fhort time. The cun­  
try to which their title had been exin­  
guithed before the revolution i fuf­  
ficient to receive a very refpedible  
population, which Congrefs wil{pro- |  
bably fee the expediency of cou-‘  
raging, fo foon as the limits fhill be  
declared. We are to view thispofi- |  
tion as an Outpoft of the WQited  
States, furrounded by ftrong. igh-‘

&amp;or- it are ot courfe out of diffion.  
ere. | In others they will be fo 1 But  
  
in a few, where the arrangements for  
the dire&amp; tax had been retarded, it  
will ftill be fome time before the  
fyftem is clofed. It has not yet been  
thought neceflary to employ the agent  
authorifed by an a of the lait feffion,  
for tranfatting bufinefs in Europe re­  
lative to debts and loans. - Nor have  
we ufed the power, confided by the  
fame a&amp;, of prolonging - the foreign  
debt by reloans, and of redeeming  
inftead thereof, an equal fum of the  
Domeftic Debt. Should however the ‘  
difficulties of remittance on fo large a |  
fcale, render it neceflary at any time,  
the power fhall be executed, and the  
money thus unemployed abroad fhall,  
in conformity with that law, be faith­  
fully applied here in an equivalent ex­  
tinction of Domeftic Debt. When  
effects fo falutary refult from the plans  
you have already fan&amp;ioned, when  
merely by avoiding falfe objeéts of  
expence, we are able, without a direct  
tax, without internal taxes, and with­  
out borrowing, to make large and  
effeCtual payments towards the dif­  
charge of our public debt, and the  
emancipation of our pofterity from  
that mortal canker, it is an encourage­  
ment, fellow citizens, of the higheft  
order, to proceed as we have begun in  
fubftituting economy for taxation, and  
in purfuing what is ufeful for a nation  
placed as we are, rather than what is  
practifed by others under different  
circumitances. And whenfoever we  
are deftined to meet events which  
fhall call forth all the energies of our  
countrymen, we have the firmelt re­  
liance on thofe energies, and the com­  
fort of leaving for calls like thefe, the  
-extraordinary refources of loans and  
‘internal taxes. In the mean time, by  
&#x27;payments of the principal of our debt,  
| we are liberating, annually, portions  
}of the external taxes, and forming  
from them a growing fund, {till further  
to leflen the neceflity of recurring to  
extraordinary refources.  
The ufual account of receipts and  
expenditures for the laft year, with an  
vAhmuve ol gy vepoinse v thvwfnmg  
one, will be laid before you by the Se­  
cretary of the Treafury.  
  
No change being deemed necef­  
fary in our military eftablifbment, an  
eltimate of its expences for the enfu­  
ing year, on its prefent footing, as alfo  
of the fums to be employed in forti­  
fications, and other objefts within  
that department, has been prepared  
by the Secretary. at War, and will  
make a part of the general eltimates  
which will be prefented you.  
Confidering that our regular  
troops are employed for local purpofes,  
and that thesmilitia is our general re­  
liance for iz:t and fudden emer­  
gencies, you will doubtlefs think this  
nftitution worthy of a review, agd  
give it thofe improvements of which  
you find it fufceptible.  
Eltimates for the nava! department,  
prepared by the Secretary of the Navy  
for another year, will in iike manner  
be communicated with the general  
eltimates. A fmall iorce- in the  
Mediterranean will ftill be neceffary  
to reftrain the Tripoline cruifers : And  
the uncertain tenure ot peace with  
fome other of the Barbary powe:s,  
may eventually require that force to  
be augmented. The necefiity of pro­  
curing fome fmaller veffels for that  
fervice, will raife the eftimate : But  
the difference in their maintenance  
will foon make it a meafure of econo­  
my. Prefaming it will be deemed  
expedient to expend annually a con­  
venient fum towards providing the  
naval defence which our fituation  
may require, I cannot but recom­  
mend that the firft appropriations for  
that purpofe, may go to the faving  
what we already potgefs. No cares, no  
attentions, can, preferve veflels from  
rapid decay, which lie in water, &amp; ex­  
pofed to the fun; Thefe decays require  
great &amp; conftant repairs, amz will con­  
fume, if continued, a great portion of  
the monies deftined to naval purpofes.  
To avoid this wafte of our refources,  
it is ptmd to add to our navy yard  
herea within which our prefent  
veflels may be laid up dry, and under  
  
cover from the fun. Under thefe  
circumf{tances experience proves that  
works of wood will remain fearcely  
at all affefted by time. The great -  
abundance of running water which @  
this fituation roﬂ&#x27;cﬂ&#x27;es, at heights far -  
above the level of the tide, if employed  
as is praftifed for lock navigation,  
furnithes the means for raifing and  
laying up our veflels, on a dry and  
fheltered bed. And fhould the mea­  
fure be found ufeful here, fimilar  
depofitories for laying up, as well as  
for building &amp; repairing veflels, may  
hereafter be undertaken at other  
Navy yards, offering the fame means.  
The plans and eftimates of the work,  
prepared by a perfon of fkill and ex­  
perience, will be prefented to you,  
without delay, and from thefe it will  
be feen that fcarcely more than has  
been the coft of one veffel is necel-:  
fary to fave the whole, 3nd that the  
annual fum to be employed towards  
its completion may be adapted to the  
views of the legiflature as to naval ex­  
penditure.

f 150 3 PRESIDENT’s MESSAGE.  
  
There was reason, not long fince, to apprehend that the war-  
fare in which we were engaged with Tripoli, might be taken up  
by some other of the Barbary powers. A reintorcement, there-  
fore, was immediately ordered to the vessels already there.  
Subsequent information however has removed these apprehen-  
fions for the present. To secure our commerce in that sea, with  
the smallett torce competent, we have supposed it bett to watch  
ftrictly the harbour of Tripoli. Still, however, the shallowness  
ef their coatt, and the want ot smaller vessels on our part, has  
permitted some cruisers to escape unobserved : and to one of  
these an American vessel unfortunately fell a prey. The cap-  
tain, one American seaman, and two others ot colour, remain  
prisoners with them ; unless exchanged under an agreement tor-  
merly made with the Bashaw, to whom, on the faith of that, some  
of his captive subjects had been rettored.  
  
The Convention with the State of Georgia has been ratified  
by their Jegislature, and a repurchase from the Creeks has been  
consequently made, of a part of the Tallessee county. In this  
  
urchase has been also comprehended a part of the lands within  
the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers. The particulars of  
the contraét will be laid before Congress so soon as they shall be  
in a ftate for communication.  
  
In order to remove every ground of difference poffible with  
our Jndian neighbours, I have proceeded in the work of settling  
with them, and marking the boundaries between us. That with  
the Choétaw nation is fixed in one part, and will be through the  
whole within a short time. The country to which their title had  
been extinguished before the revolution is sufficient to receive a  
very respectable population, which Congress will probably see  
the expediency of encouraging, so soon as the limits shall be de-  
Clared. We are to view this polition as an Outpoit of the Uni-  
ted States, surrounded by ftrongneighbors, and diftant from its  
gupport. And how farthat monopoly, which prevents popula-  
tion, should here be guarded againft, and actual habitation made  
a condition of the continuance of title, will be for your confide-  
ration. A prompt settlement too of all exilting rights and  
claims within this territory, presents itself asa preliminary ope-  
Fatione  
  
In that part of the Indiana territory which includes Vincen-  
nes, the lines settled with the neighbouring tribes fix the extin¢t-  
ion of their title at a breadth of twenty-four leagues from Eatt to  
Welt, and about the same length parrallel with and inciuding the  
Wabash. They have also ceded atraé of four miles square, in-  
cluding the Salt-Springs near the mouth of that river.

In the -department of finance it is with pleasure I inform you  
that the receipts of external duties, tor the lait twelve months,  
have exceeded those of any former year, and that the ratio of  
increase has-been also greater than usual. This has enabled us  
to answer all the regular exigencies oi government, to pay from  
the Treasury, within one year, upwards of eight millions of  
dollars—principal and interett, of the public devt, exclulive of.  
upwards of one million paid by the sale of bank itock, and mak-  
ing in the whole a reduction of nearly five millions and a halt of  
rincipal, and to have now in the treasury four millions and an:  
half of dollars, which are in a course of application to the fur-  
ther discharge of debt, and current demands. Experience too,  
so far, authorises us to belicve, if no extraordinary event sue  
ervenes, and the expences which will be actually incurred shall  
not be greater than were contemplated by Congress at their laf  
seffion, that we shall not be disappointed in the expectations then.  
formed. But nevertheless, as the effe@ of peace on the amount  
of duties is not yet fully ascertained, it is the more necessary to  
practice every useful economy, and to incur no expence, which  
may be avoided without prejudice.  
  
The colleétion of the internal taxes having been compleated:  
in some of the ftates, the officers employedin it are of course  
out of commiffion- In others they will be so shortly. Butina  
few, where the arrangements for the direét tax had been rctarde  
ed, it will {till be some time before the syftem is closed. It has  
not yet been thought necessary to employ the agent authorised.  
by an act of the lait seffion, fortransaating bufiness in Europe  
relative to debts and loans. Nor have we used the power, conw  
fided by the same act, of prolonging the foreign debt by reloans,  
  
and of redeeming inftead thereof, an equal sum of the Domellic.  
  
Debt. Should however the difficulties of remittance on so large  
  
a scale, render it necessary at any time, the power shall be exee-  
  
cuted, and the money thus unemployed abroad shall, in confore  
mity with that law, be faithfully applied here in an equivalent  
  
extinction of Domettic Debt. When effects so salutary result:  
  
from the plans you have already sanétiond, when merely by  
avoiding false objets of expense, we are able, without a dire&amp;  
tax, without internal taxes, and. without borrowing, to make large  
  
and effectual payments towards the discharge of our public debt,.  
  
and the emancipation of our pofterity from that mortal canker,  
it is an encouragement, fellow-citizens, of the: higheft order, te  
  
proceed as we have begun in sub(tituting economy for taxation,.  
  
and in pursuing what is useful for a nation placed as we are, rathe

fer tock mavigation, furnishes the means for raifing and laying  
up ourvessels, on a dry and sheltered bed. And should the  
racasure be found useful here, fimilar depofiiories for laying up,  
as well as fer building and repairing vessels, may her cafter be  
undertaken at other Navy yards, offering the same means.  
  
)°Vhe plans and eftimates of the work, prepared by a person of  
4 skill and experience, will be presented to you, without delay, and  
  
trom these it will be seen that scarcely more than has been the  
  
© -coit of one vessel is necessary to save the whole, and that the  
* .anaualsum to be employed towards its completion may be  
‘aaapled to the views of the legislature as to naval expendi-  
  
To cultivate peace and maintain commerce and nav} gation in  
all their lawful enterpr ises ; to fofter our fifherics as nurseries of  
  
mavigation, and for the nurture of man, and protect ihe manufac-  
  
tures adapted to our circumflances ; to preserve the faith of the  
  
mation by an exaét discharge of its debts and contraés, expend  
  
the public money with the same care and econumy we would  
practise with our own, and impose on our citizens no unnecessae  
ry burihens ; to keep inall things within the pale of our coniii-  
  
tuitional powers, and cherish the federal union, as the only rock  
  
ef safety ; these fellow citizens,are the landmarks by which we  
are to.guide ourselves in all our proceedings. by continuing to  
make these our rule of action, we shall encear to our country-  
men the true principles of their conftitution, and premote an un-  
ton of sentiment and of action, equally auspicious to their hap-  
piness and safety. Onmy part you may count on a cordial  
concurrence im every measure for the public good ; and on all  
  
the infermation I[ possess which may enable you to discharge to  
  
advantage the high fundtions with which you are invetted by your

To Tae SenatTe axp Houst oF Re­  
4PRESENTATIVE§ OF THE UNITED  
i w 8 TSEATES: : :  
WHEN we assemble together,  
Y Y fellowscitizens, to confider the  
state of our beloved couatry, our juit  
attentions are firk drawn to those  
&quot; pleasing circumstances which mark  
the goodness of that Being from whose  
favor they flow,and the large measure  
of thankfulnefs we owe for his bounty. I  
Another year has come round, and  
finds us still blessed with peace and  
friendfhip abroad, law, order and. re­  
ligion at home, good affeétion and  
harmony with our Indian neighbors, |  
and our burthens lightened ; yet our  
income fufficient for the public wants,  
and the produce of the year great be- |  
- yond example. These, fellow citizens, 1  
are the circumstances under which we  
meet ; and we remark with special fat- 1  
isfa&amp;ion, those which under the smiles  
of Providence, Tefult from the skill, |  
industry and order of our citizens,  
yinanaging their own aflairs in their  
~own way, and for their own use, un­  
embarrafled by too much regulaticus,  
unopprefled by fifcal exations.  
On the restoration of peace in Eu- |  
rope, that poertion of &amp;e carrying  
trade which had fallen to ourlot dur- ’  
ing the war, was abridged by the re- |  
turning competition of the belligerent ’  
powers. This was to be expeéted and  
was just. But, insaddition we find, ‘  
in some parts of Europe, monopoliz­  
ing discriminations, which, in the form 1  
of duties, tend effe&amp;ually to prohibit |  
the carrying thither oor own px’oduce/l  
in our own veflels.—From existing  
amities and a {pirit of ‘uflice, it is hop- l  
ed that friendly difcuflion will pro-.  
duce a fair and adequate reciprocity.  
. But thould falfe calcplations of inter­  
est defeat our hope, it rests with the  
legislature to decide whether they wiil  
meet inequalities abroad with coun­  
tervailing inequalities a: home, or pro-’  
vide fer the evil im any other way.  
It is with fatisfadion 1 lay before  
yon an a&amp; of the British Parliament  
xafﬁcipating“\this fubje&amp;, so far as to  
authorife 2 mutual abolitien of the du­  
‘ties and countervailing duties, permit­  
ted under the treaty of 1 7?4. It shews  
on their part a spirit of justice and  
_ friendly accommodation; which it is |  
our duty and our interest to cultivate  
with all nations. - Whether this would  
produce &amp; due equalisy in the naviga.  
tion between the two countries, is a  
. fubje&amp; for your consideration.  
&amp;‘mcﬁmﬁame which claims  
attention, as direétly affeéting the very  
‘fource of our navigation, is the defed

cure our commerce in that sea, with  
the smallest force competent, we have  
supposed it best to-watch firiétly the  
harbor of Tripoli. Still, however the  
shallowness of their ¢coalt, and the  
want ‘of {maller vessels on our part,  
has permitted ‘fome cruifersto escape  
unobserved—and to one of these an  
American veflel unfortunately fell a  
Fr’ey. The captain, one American  
eaman, and two others of color, re­  
main prisoners with them ; unless ex­  
changed under an agreement formerly  
made with the bafhaw, to whom, on  
the faith of that, some of his captive  
{fubjec*s had been restored. ‘  
&quot; T&#x27;he Convention with the state of  
Georgia has been, ratified by their le­  
giflatite, and a repurchase from the  
creeks has been coniequently made, of  
a part of the Tallafiee county. In  
this purchase has been alio compre-.  
hended a part of the lands within the  
fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee riv­  
ers. &#x27;The particulars of the contratt  
will be laid before Congress so {oon as  
they shall be in a state for communica­  
tion. :  
In order to remove every ground  
of difference poflible with our Indian  
neighbors, 1 have proceeded in the  
work of fettling with them, ang maik­  
‘ing the boundaries between us. That  
with the Choftaw naton is fixed&#x27;in  
one part, and will be through the  
whole within a short time. The coun­  
try to which their title has been ex­  
tinguished befcre the revolution is {ut­  
ficient to receive a very ré{peable  
population, which Congress will pro­  
bably fee the expediency of encourag­  
ing, so {foon as the limits shall be de­  
clared. We are to view this position  
as an Outpost of the United States,  
surrounded by firong neighbors, and  
distant fiom its support. And how  
far that monopoly, which pievents  
population, should here be guarded a­  
gamit, and*acual hablitatuon made a  
condition of the continuance of title,  
will be for your consideration. A  
prompt settlement too of all exilting  
riglits and claims within this territory,  
presents itfelf as a preliminary opera­  
tion.  
In that part of the Indians territo­  
ry which includes Vincennes, the lines  
fettled with the neighboring tribes fix  
the extinétion of their title at a breadth  
of twenty-four leagues from Eall to  
Weflt, and about the fame length pa­  
rallel with and including the Wabath.  
They have also ceded a tra&amp; of four  
miles {quare, including the Salt-  
Springs near the mouth of that river.  
In the department of finance it is  
with pleasure I inform you that the  
receipts of external duties, for the last  
twelve months, have exceeded those of  
any former year, and that the ratio of  
increase has been also greater than u­  
sual. This has cnabléﬂ us to answer  
all the regular exigencies of govern­  
ment, to pay from the Treasury,  
within one year, upwards of eight  
millions of dollars, principal and in­  
terest, of the public debt, exclusive of  
upwards of one million paid by the  
sale of bank stock, and making in the  
whole a reduéion of nearly Eve mil­  
lions and an half of principal, and to  
have now in the treasury four millions  
and an half of dollars, which are in a  
course of application to the further  
discharge of debt, and current de­  
mands. Experience too, so far au­  
thorifes us to believe, if no extraordi­  
~mary event supervenes, and the expen­  
ces which will be a&amp;ually incurred  
‘fhall not be greater than were contem­  
plated by Congress at their last fef  
fion, that we shall not be disappointed  
in the expeélations.then formed. But  
nevertheless, as the effe&amp; of peace on  
the amount of duties is not yet fully  
_afgertained, it is the more necessary to  
praclifs every ufeful _:%)ncmy, and to

however the difficulties of remittance  
on {o large a scale, render it neceflury  
at any time, the power shall be execu­  
ted, and the money thus unemployed  
abroad shall, in conformity with that  
law; be faithfully applied bere in an  
equivalent extin&amp;lion of domestic debt.  
—When effeés {o salutary result from  
the plans you have already fan&amp;ioned,  
when merely by avoiding falfe objeéts  
of expence, we are able, without a di­  
rest tax, without internalixe’, and  
without borrowing, (e maue lirge and  
effetual payments towards the dis­  
charge of. our pubiic debt, and the  
emancipation of our pofierity from  
that-mortal canker, it. is an encour­  
agement, fellow-citizens, of the high­  
elt order, to procezd as we have begun  
in {ubftituting economy for taxation,  
and in puriuning what is ufeful for a  
nation placed as we are, ru«ther than  
what is pradtifed by others under dif­  
ferent circumitances. And whenso­  
ever we are destined to meeljgvents  
which thall call forth «ll the energies  
of our countrymen, we have the firm­  
eft reliance on thoie energjes, and the  
comfort of leaving for calls like these,  
the exuraordinary sources of loans and  
internal taxes. In the mean time, by  
payments of the principal of our debt,  
we are liberating, annually, portions  
of the extanal tazes, and torming  
from them a growing fund, {iill fur­  
ther to leflen the necefiity of recuriing  
to extracrdinary resources.  
&quot;The usual acconnt of receipts and  
expenditures tor the lait year, with an  
ettimate ot the expences of the ensuing  
one; wirl be laid before you by the se­  
cretary of the treasury.  
No change being deemed necessary  
in our military eflabiifhment, an esti­  
mate of its expences for the ensuing  
year, onits predent footing, as also of  
the {ums to be employed in the fortifi­  
cations and other obje&amp;s within that  
department, has been prepared by the  
Secretary at War, and wiil make a  
part of the general efiimates which  
will be presented you.  
Configering that our regular troops  
are employed for local purposes, and  
that the militia is our general reliance  
for gr®at and {fudden emergencies, you  
%ill doubtless think this institution  
worthy of a review, and give it those  
imp ovements of which ycu find it  
susceptible.  
Eitimates for the naval department  
prepared by the secretary of the navy  
for another year, will in like man­  
ner be communicated with the  
general estimates. A small force  
in the Mediterranean will fill be  
necessary to restrain the “I&#x27;ripoline  
cruisers : and the uncertain tenure of  
peace with some other of the Basbary  
powers, may eventuaily require that  
forceto be augmented. The neceflity  
of procuring {ome smaller veflels for  
that service willraife the estimate :  
but the difference in their maintenance  
will soon make it a measure of @con­  
omy.  
Presuming it will be deemed expe­  
dient to expend annually a convenient  
sum towards providing the naval de­  
fence which our situation may require,  
I cannot but recommend that the firft  
appropriationsfor that purpofe,may go  
to the {aving what we already poflefs.  
No tares, no attentions, can preserve  
veflels from rapid decay, which lie in  
water and exposed to the fun. These  
decays require great and constant re­  
pairs, &amp; will consume, if continued, a  
great portion of the monies &lt;flined  
tornaval purposes. T&#x27;oavaid this waste  
of our resources, it is proposed to add  
to our navy yard here a dock, within  
which our present vessels may be laid  
‘up dry, and under cover from the fun.  
T})nder these circumßances, s::gmmcc­  
. s Rk T ek, Gl %  
proves &amp;‘at, works oﬁ’wooc!“&#x27;ﬂ remain  
fearcely at all affeCted by time. The  
great abundance of running water  
which this situation poflefles,at heights  
far above the level of the_tide, if em­  
ployed as is practifed for lock et  
‘tion, furnifhes the means for railing  
and laying up our vessels on a dry and  
elicied bed: And fould e e  
sure be found ufeful here, similar de­  
pofitaries for laying up, w ell for  
building and rcpaiting veflels, may  
hereafter be undertaken atother navy  
‘yatds offering thgfame means. The  
ed by a person of skill and experience,  
lay, und from shefg i wil be seen, that  
wholeand that the atnual sum tobe  
  
employed towar&amp; completion may  
be adapted to the wiews of the legisla­  
ture as to naval expenditure.  
To cultivate. peace and maintain  
commerce and navigation in all their  
Jawtul enterprizes ; to fofterour fifh­  
eries as&#x27; nurseries of navigation, and  
for the nutture of man, and protedt

cumstances ; to preserve the faith of  
the nation by an exa&amp; discharge of its  
debis and contraés expend the public

powers, and cherith the federal union,  
as the only rock of f{afety ; these, fel­  
low citizens; are the landmarks by  
which we are to&#x27;guide ourselves in all  
our proceedings. ¥E sy  
By continuing to make these our  
rule of aéion, we shall endear to our

their constitution, and promote an  
union of sentiment and of a&amp;ion,  
-equally auspicious to their happiness  
and fufety. On my part you may

To the Senate and  
  
Houfe of Rep-efentativesof the United Staves.  
WHEN wealhmhie together, fellow ci-  
tizens, to confider the ftate of our beloved  
country, our jufl attentions are firft drawn to  
thofe plealing circumflances which mark the  
goodnefs of that Beiug from whole favor they  
flow, and the large vnoal&#x27;ure of thankfulneis  
we owe for his bounty. Another year has  
come around, and finds us ftill bleffed with  
peace and fricndfliip abroad, law, order and  
religion at home, good affection and harmony  
with our Indian neighbours, our burthens  
lightened ; yet our income fuflicient for the  
public wants, and the produce of the year  
great beyend example. Thefe, fellow citi-  
zens, are the circumflances under which we  
meet; and we remark with fpecial fatisfac-  
non tliol&#x27;e, vhich under the fmiles of provi-  
dence, refukfrom the ftill, induflry and or-  
der of our citizens, managing their own ai&quot;  
fairs in their own way, and for their own  
ufe, liMembarr^iTed by too much regulation,  
unoppreflcd by fifcal exactions.  
  
On the reitoration &lt;»f p»ace in Europe, that  
portion of the carrying trade, which uad fal-  
len to our (hire during rhe war, was abridg-  
ed by the returning competition of the belli-  
gerent powers. This was to be cxpedled and  
was jufl. But, in addition, we find, in forrjc  
parts of Europe; monopolizing difcriminatV  
ons,whith, in the form of duties, tend effect*,  
ally to prohibit the carrying thither our own  
produce in our own veffelL From exifl,hg  
imities and a fpirit of juflic r, it is doped that  
friendly difcuffion wii! produce a fair and ade-  
quate reciprocity. But Ihould talfe calcula-  
tions of intcreft defeat our hope, it refls with  
the legillature to decide whether they will  
neet inequalities abroad with countervailing  
inequalities at home, or provide for the evil in  
My other wsv.  
  
It is with fatisfaction I lay before you an  
act of the Bntilh parliament anticipating this  
fubject, fo far as to authorize a mutual aboli-  
tion of the, duties and countervail, n { duties,  
permitted under the treaty of 1794. It  
flVws on their part a fpirit of juflice and  
fii-&#x27;iidly accommodation, which it is our duty  
and our interefl to cultivate with all na-  
tions. Whether this would produce a due  
equality in the navigation between the two  
countries, is a fubject for your conlideration.  
  
Another circumftance which claims atten-  
tion, as dire&amp;ly afiVcting the very fource of  
our navigation, is the defect or the ev. lion of  
the law providing for the reCurn of fcamen,  
and particularly of thofe belonging to veflVIs  
ibid abroad. Numbers of them, dilcharged  
in foreign ports, have been thrown on the  
hands of our conluls, who, to refcue them  
from the dangers into which their diflrcfles  
might plunge them, and fave them to their  
country, have found it. neceflary, in fome cafes  
to return them at the public charge.  
/ The ceflion of the Spanilh province of  
Louifiana to France, which took place in the  
courfeof the late war, will, if carried into ef-  
fect, make a change in the afpect of onr fo-  
reign relations, which will doubtlefs have  
jufl weight in any deliberations of the legilla-  
ture connected with that fubject.  
  
There was reafon, not long Cpce, to appre-  
hend that the warfare in which we were en-  
gaged with Tripoli, might be taken up by  
fome other of the Barbary powers. A rein-  
forcement, therefore, was immediately order-  
ed to the velTels already there. Suhl&#x27;equent  
information however has removed thefe ap-  
prcheiilions for the prefent. To feenre our  
commerce in that fsa, with the fimallefl. force  
competent, we have hippo fed it beft to watch  
flrittly .the harbour of Tripoli. Still, howe-  
ver, the Ihallownefs of their coalt, and the  
want of tnaller velTels on our part, has per-  
mitted fome cruifers toefcape unnbfervx-d ; —  
and to one of thefe an American veffej unfor-  
tunately fell a prey. The captain, one Ame-  
rican feaman, and two others of colour, re-  
prilbners with them ; irnlefs exchange!  
under an agreement formerly made with &#x27;he  
Baibaw, to whom, on the faith of that, fome  
of his captive fubjects had been reftored.  
  
The convention with the ftate of Georgia  
has been ratified by their legiflature, and a  
re-purchafe from the Creeks has been COofe-  
quently made, of a pari of the TallarTcce  
county. In this purchafe has been alio com-  
pnbendid apart of the lands within the fork

that the taiio of in.~r. ale has been alio great-

in the Mediterranean will ftill be necclTaiy to  
refti ain the Tripoline cruifers ; and the un-  
certain tenure .of peace with fome other of the

means for ra ingand laying up our veffels, on

trv, and order of our citizens, managing their own  
  
affairs in their own way, and for their own use,  
  
- unembarrassed by too much regulation, unop-  
pressed by fiscal exactions.—On the restoration of  
  
peace in Europe, that portion of the carrying  
trade which had fallen to our share during the  
war, was abridged by the returning competition  
of the Beiligerent Powers. This was to be ex-  
pected and was just. But, in addition, we find,  
in some parts of Evrore, monopolizing discrimina-  
tions, which, ia the form of duties, tend effectually  
to prohibit the carrying thither our own produce  
in our own vessels. From existing amities, and  
a spirit of justice, it is ped that friendly discus-  
siou will produce a fairand adequate reciprocity.  
But should false calculations of interest defeat our  
hope, it rests with the Legislature to decide whe-  
ther they will meet inequalities abroad with  
countervailing inequalities at home, or provide  
for the evilim any other way.—It is with’ satis-  
faction I lay before you an Act of the British Par-  
liament, anticipating this subject, so far as to  
authorise a mutual abolition of the duties, and  
countervailing duties, permitted under the treaty  
of 1794. It shews, on their part, a spirit of jus-  
tice and friendly accommodation, which it is our  
duty and our interest to cultivate with all nations.  
Whether this would produce a due equality in the  
navigation between the two countries, is a subject  
for your consideration.—Another circumstance  
which claims attention, as directly affecting the  
very source of our navigation, is the defect, or the  
evasion, of the law providing for the return of  
seamen, and particularly ef those belonging to  
vessels sold abroad. Numbers of them, dis-  
charged in foreign ports, have been thrown on  
the hands of our Consuls, who, to rescue them  
from the dangers into which their distresses might  
plunge them, and save them to their-country, have  
found it necessary, in some cases, to return them  
at the public charge.—The cession of the Spanieh  
Province of Louisiana to France, which took  
place in the course-of the late war, will, #f carried  
into fect, make a change in the asp et of sur foreign re-  
dations, whieh will, doubtless, have just weight in  
any deliberations of the Legislature connected  
with that subject—There was reason, not long  
since, to apprehend that the warfare in which we  
were engaged with Tripoli, might be taken up by  
some other of the Barbary powers. A reinforce-  
we yu. therefore, was immediately ordered to the  
Nee already there.—Subsequent information,  
  
Owever, has removed these apprekensions for the  
Present. To seeure our commerce in that sea,  
with the smallest force com tent, we have sup-  
_— it best to watch strictly the harbour ‘of  
  
&quot;poli. Still, however, the shallowness of their

particulars of the contract will be laid before  
Congress so soon as they shall be ina state for  
communication.—In order to remove every grouud  
of difference possible with our Indian neighbours,  
I have proceeded in the work of settlng with  
them, and marking the boundaries between us.  
That with the Chactaw nation is fixed in one  
part, and will be through the whole within a  
short time. The country to which their title had  
been extinguished before the revolution is suffi-  
cient to receive a very respectable population,  
which Congress will probably see the expediency  
of encouraging, so soon as the limits shall be de-  
clared. Weare to view this position as an out-  
post of the United States, surrounded by strong  
neighbours, and distant from its support. And  
how far that monopoly, which prevents popula-  
tion, should here be guarded against, and actual  
habitation made a condition of the continuance  
of title, will be for your consideration. A prompt  
settlement too, of all existing rights and claims  
within this territory, presents itself as a prelimi-  
nary operation. —In that part of the Indian terri-  
tory which includes Vincennes, the lines settled  
with the neighbouring tribes fix the extinction of  
their title at a breadth of 24 leagues from East ta,  
West, and about the same length parallel with  
and including the Wabash. They have also ceded  
a track of four miles square, including the Salt  
Springs near the mouth of that river.—In the de-  
partment of finance it is with pleasure I inform  
you that the receipts of external duties, for the  
last twelve months, have exceeded those og any  
former year, and that the ratio of increase hag  
been also greater than usual, This has enabled  
us to answer all the regular exigencies of Goyern-  
ment, to pay from the Treasury, within one year,  
upwards of cight millions of dollars, principal and  
interest of the public debt, exclusive of upwards  
of one million paid by the sale of bank stock, and  
making in the whole a reduction of nearly five  
millions and a half of principal, and to have now  
in the Treasury four millions and a half of dollars,  
which are in the course of application to the frr-  
ther discharge of debt and current demands. Ex-  
perience, too, so far authorises us to believe, if no  
extraordinary event supervenes, and the expenses  
which will be actually incurred shall not be  
greater than were contemplated vf Eyam Mee at  
their last session, that we shall not be disappoint-  
ed in the expectations then formed. But, never-  
theless, as the effect of peace on the amount of  
duties is not yet fully ascertained, it is the more  
necessary to practise every useful economy, and  
to incur no expense, which may be avoided with  
out prejudice-—The collection of the internal  
taxes having been completed in some of the States,  
the officers employed in it are of course out of  
commission, In others they will ‘be so shortly.  
  
But in a few, where the arrangements for rhe di-  
  
rece tax been . ; it will still be some

result from the plans you have already sanction-  
ed, when merely by avoiding false objects of ex-  
  
nse, we are able, without a direct tax, without  
nternal caxes, and without borrowing, to make  
Jarge and effectual payments towards the discharge  
of our public debt, and the emancipation of our  
posterity from that mortal canker, it is an encou-  
ragement, fellow citizens, of the highest order, to  
proceed as we have begun in substituting economy  
for taxation, and in pursuing what fs usetul for a  
nation, placed as we are, rather than what is  
practised by others under different circumstances.  
And whensoever we are destined to meet events  
which shall call forth all the energies of our coun-  
trymen, we have the firmest reliance on those  
energies, and the comfort of leaving for calls ike  
these, the extraordinary resources of loans and  
internal taxes, In the mean time, by payments  
of the principal of our debt, we are liberating,  
annually, portions of the external taxes, and  
forming from them a growing fund, still further  
to lessen the necessity of recurring to extraordi-  
nary resources.x—The usual account of receipts  
and expenditures for the last year, with an esti-  
mate of the expenses of the ensuing one, will be  
laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury.  
-—No change being deamed necessary in our military esta-  
blichmsnt, an estimate of its expenses for the en-  
Suing ycar, ON its present footing, as also of the  
sums to be employed in fortitications, and other  
objects within that department, has been piepared  
by the Secretary at War, and will make a part of  
the general estimaies which will be presented to  
you.— Considering that our reguiar troops are em-  
ployed tor local purposes, and that the militia is  
our general rehance for great and sudden emer-  
gencies, you will doubtless think this tastitutien  
worthy of a review, and give it those improve-  
ments of which you fad at susceptible. —Esti-  
mates for the naval department, prepared by the  
Seeretary of the Nav y tor another year, will ia  
like manner be communicated with the general  
estimates. A small force in the Medirerranean  
will still be necessary to restrain the Tripoline  
cruizers; and the uncertain teaure of peace with  
some other of the Barbary powers, may even-  
tually require sthat force to be angmented. The  
necessity of procuring some smalicr vessels for  
that service, will raise the estimate; but the dif.  
ference in their maintenance will soon make iia  
measure of cconomy.—-Presuming it will be deem-  
ed expedient to expend avnually a convenicnt  
sum towards providing the naval defence which  
Our situation may require, Ll cannot bat recom-  
mend that the first appropriations for that pur.  
pose, may go tothe saving what we already pos-  
sess, No cares, no attentions, can preserve ves-  
sels from rapid decay, which lie in water, and  
exposed to the sun, These decays require great  
and constant repairs, and will consume, if conti-  
nued, a great portion of the monies destined to  
naval purposes. To avoid this waste of our re-  
sources, it is proposed to add to our navy yard  
here a dock, within which our present vessels  
may he laid up dry, and under cover from the sun.  
Under these circumstances experience proves that  
works of wood will remain scarcely at all affected  
by time. The great abundance of running water  
which this situation possesses, at heights far above  
the level of the tide, if employed as is practised  
for lock navigation, furnishes the means for rsis-  
ing and laying up our vessels, on a dry sheltered  
bed. And should the measure be found useful  
  
here, similar depositories for laying up, as well as  
for building aud repairing vesse&#x27;s, may hereafter

be undertaken at other navy yards, offering the  
same means. The plans and estimates ot the  
work, prepared by a person of skill and experi-  
ence, will be presented by you without delay ;  
and from these it will be seen that scarcely more  
than has been the cost of one vessel is necessary  
to save the whole, and that the annual sum to be  
employed towards its completion may be adapted  
to the views of the Legislature as to naval expen-  
diture.—To cultivate peace, and maintain com.  
merce and navigation in all their lawful enter.  
prizes ; to foster our fisheries as nurseries of na-  
vigation, and for the nurture of man, and protect  
the mavufactures adapted to our circumstances ;  
to preserve the faith of the mation by an exact  
discharge of its debts and contracts, expend the  
public money with the same care and economy  
we would practise with our own, atid impose on  
our citizens vo unnecessary burthens ; to keep in  
all things within the pale of our constitutional  
powers, and cherish the federal union, as the only  
rock of safety; these, fellow citizens, are the  
landmarks by which we are to guide ourselves in  
all our proceedings. By continuing to make  
these our rule of action, we shall endear to our  
countrymen the true principles of their constitu-  
tion, and promete an union of sentiment and of  
action, equally auspicious to their happiness and  
satety. On my part you may count a cordial  
concurrence in every measure for the public  
good; end on all the information I possess which  
may enable you to discharge ta advantage the  
high functions with which you are invested by  
your country. (Signed) Thomas Jefferson

To the Senate and Houfe of Repre-  
fentatives of the United States.  
  
WHEN we affemble together, fellow-  
citizens, to confider the ftate of our be-  
loved country, our juft attentions are firft  
drawn to thofe pleafing circumitances  
which mark the goodnefs of that Being  
from whofe favour’ they flow; and the  
large meafure of thankfulnels we owe for  
his bounty. Another year has come a-  
round, and finds us ftill bleffed with peace  
and triendthip abroad ; law, order, and  
religion at home; good affeétion and har-  
mony with our Indian neighbours ; our  
burdens lightened, yet our income fuffici-  
ent for the public wants, and the produce  
of the year great beyond example. Thee,  
fellow-citizens, are the cir¢umilances un-  
der which we meet ; and we remark, with  
{pecial fatisfastion, thofe which, under the  
{miles of Providence, refult from the fkill,  
induftry, and order of our citizens, ma-  
naging their own affairs in their own way,  
and for their own ufe, unembarraffed by  
too much regulation, unoppreffed by filcal  
exaétions.  
  
On the reftoration of peace in Europe,  
that portion of the carrying trade which  
had fallen to our fhare during the war,  
was abridged by the returning competi-  
tion of the belligerent powers. ‘This was  
to be expe&amp;ted, and was juit.—But, ‘in  
addition, we find, in fome parts of Eu-  
rope, monopolizing difcriminations, which,  
in the form of duties, tend effeétuaily to  
prohibit the carrying thither our cwn pro-  
duce in our own veflels, From exiiting  
amities, anda {pirit of jultice, it is hoped  
that friendly difcuMfion will produce a fair  
and adequate reciprocity. But fhould falie  
calculations of intereft defeat our hope, it  
relts with the legidlature to decide whether  
  
they will meet inequalities abroad with  
countervailing inequalities at home, or  
provide for the evil in any other way.  
  
It is with fatisfaétion I lay before you  
an” aét of the Britifh parliament, an-  
ticipating this fubjeét, fo far-as to autho-  
rife a mutual abolition of the duties, and  
countervailing duties, permitted under the  
treaty of 1794. It fhows, on their part,  
a fpirit of jultice and friendly accommo-  
dation, which it is our duty and interelt,  
to cultivate with all nations. Whether  
this would produce a due equality in the  
navigation between the two countries, 1s  
a fubje&amp; for your contideration.  
  
Another circumftance which claims ate  
tention, as direétly affecting the very fource  
of our navigation, is the defeét, or the  
evafion, of the law providing for the re-  
turn of feamen, and particularly of thof  
belonging to vefiels fold abroad. Num-  
bers of them, difcharged in foreign ports,  
have been thrown on the hands of our cons  
fuls, who, to refcue them from the dan-  
gers into which their diftrefles might  
plunge them, and fave them to their coun-~  
try, have found it neceflary, in fome cafes,  
to return them at the public charge.  
  
The ceffion of the Spanith province of  
Louifiana to France, which took place in  
the courfe of the late war, will, if carried  
into effe&amp;t, make a change in the afpeét of  
our foreign relations, which will, doubr-

of the legiflature connected with that fub-  
jet.  
  
There was reafon, not long fince, to  
apprehend that the warfare in which we  
were engaged with Tripoli, might be  
taken up by fome other of the Barbary  
powers. A reinforcement, therefore, was  
iminediately ordered to the vefléls already  
there.—Subfequen: information, however,  
has removed thefe apprehenfions for the  
prefent. ‘To fecure our commerce in that  
fea, with the fimalleit force competent, we  
  
e 2

have fuppofed it heft to watch frilly the  
harbour of Tripoli. Still, laowever, the  
fhallownefs of their coalt, and the want of  
fmaller veflels on our part, has pe: mitted  
fome crvizers to efcape unobferved ; and  
to one of thefe an American veflel unior-  
tunately fell a prey. The captain, one  
American feaman, and two others of co-  
our, remain prifoners with them, unlefs  
“hanged under an agreement formerly  
made with the bafhaw, to whom, on the  
faith of that, fome of his captive fubjects  
had heen reitored.  
  
The convention with the fate of Georgia  
has been ratified by their legiflature, and  
a repurchale from the Creeks has been  
contequently made, of a part of the Tal-  
laifcee couety. In this purchafe tas been  
alio comprehended a part of the lands  
within the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee  
rivers. The particulars of the contrac  
will be laid before congrefs as foon us they  
thall be in a ftate for communication.  
  
In order to remove every ground of dif-  
ference poffible with our Indian neigh-  
hours, I have proceeded in the work of  
fettling with them, and marking the  
boundaries between us. That with the  
Choétaw nation is fixed in one part, and  
will be through the whole within a fhort  
time. The country to which their title  
had been extinguithed before the revolution  
is fufficicnt to receive a very refpeétable  
  
population, which congre(s will probably  
fec the expediency of encouraging, as foon  
  
cas the limits fhall be declared. We are  
to view this pofition as an owtpott of the  
United States, {urrounded by ttrong neigh-  
bours, and diftant from its tupport. And  
bow far that monopoly, which prevents  
population, fhould here be guarded a-  
gainit, and a€lual habitaticn made a con-  
dition of the continuance cf title, will be  
tor your confideration. A prompt fettle-  
ment too, of all exifting rights and claims  
within this territory, prelents itieif as a  
preliminary operation. ,  
  
in that pare of the Indian territory  
which includes Vincennes, the lines tettled  
with the neighbouring wibes fix the ex-  
tinQion of their title at a breadth of  
twenty-four leagues from eatt to welt, and  
ahout the fame length parallel with and  
including the Wabafh, They have alio  
ceded a track cf four miles fguare, in-  
cluding the falt {prings p.ar the mouth of  
that river.  
  
in the department of finance, it is with  
pleature T usform you that the receipts of  
external duties, for the lait twelve months,  
have excceded thoie of any founer year,  
  
THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
and that the ratio of increafe has alfo  
been greater than ufual. This has ena-  
bled us to anfwer ail the regular exigencies  
of government, to pay from the trealury,  
within one year, upward of eight millions  
of dollars, principal and interet of the  
public debt, exclufive of upward of one  
million paid by the fa’e of bank flock, and  
making in the whole a reduSion of nearly  
five millions and a half of principal, and  
to have now in the treafury four millions  
and.a half of dollars, which are in a courfe  
of application to the further difcharge of  
debt and current demands. Experience,  
too, fo far authorifés us to believe, if no  
extraordinary event fupervenes, and the  
expences which will be aétually incurred  
thall not be greater than weie contemplated  
by congrefs at their Jatt feffion, that we  
thall not be difappointed in the expe@ations  
then formed. But, neverthelefs, as the  
effect of peace on the amount of duties is  
no: yet fully afcertained, it is the more  
necefJary to practice every ufeful economy,  
and to incur no expence, which may be  
avoided withaut prejudice.  
  
The colleétion of the internal taxes hav-  
ing been completed in fome of the ftates,  
the officers employed in it are of courfe  
out of commiifion, In others they wilt  
be fo thortly. But im a few, where the  
arrangement for the direét tax had been  
retarded, it will fill be fume time before  
the fyliem is clofed. It has not yet been  
thought neceflary to employ the agent au-  
thorifed by an aét of. the Jaft feflion, for  
tran{acting bufinefs in Europe relative to  
debts and loans. Nor have we ufed the  
power confided by the fame aét, of pro-  
longing the foreign debt by re-loans, and  
of redeeming inttead thereof, an equal fum  
of the domettic debt. Should, however,  
the difficuities of remitting on fo large a  
{cale render it neceffary at any time, the  
power fhall be executed, and the money  
thus unemployed abroad fhali, in con-  
tormity with ihe law, be faithfully em-  
ployed here in an equivalent extinétion of  
domeitic debt. When cffes fo falutary  
refult from the plans you have already  
fanétioned, when merely by avoiding talte  
objecis of expence, we are able, without a  
direct tax, without internal taxes, and  
without borrowing, to make large and  
effectual payments toward the difcharge of  
our public debt, and the emancipation of  
our pofterity trom the mortal canker, it is  
an encouragement, fellow-citizens, of the  
higheft order, to proceed as we have begun  
in Jubitiuting economy for taxation, and  
in pugluing what is uleful for a nations

placed as we are, rather than what is  
practifed by others under different cir-  
cumftances. And whenfoever we are  
deftined to meet events which fhall call forth  
all the energies of our countrymen, we  
have the firmeft reliance on thofe energies,  
and the comfort of leaving for calls like  
thefe, the extraordinary refources of loans  
and internal taxes. In the mean time,  
by payments of the principal of our debt,  
we are liberating, annually, portions of  
the external taxes, and forming from them  
a growing fund, ‘till further to leffen the  
neceflity of recurring to extraordinary re-  
fources.  
  
The ufual account of receipts and ex-  
penditures for the laft year, with an efti-  
mate of the expences of the enfuing one,  
will be laid before you by the fecretary of  
the treafury. :  
  
No change being deemed neceffary in  
our military eftablithment, an cftimate of  
its expences for the enfuing year, on its  
prefent footing, as alfo of the fums to be  
employed in fortifications, and other ob-  
je&amp;ts within that department, has been  
prepared by the fecretary at war, and will  
make a part of the general eftimates which  
will be prefented to you.  
  
Confidering that our regular troops are  
employed for local purpofes, and that the  
miktia is our general reliance for great and  
  
fudden emergencies, you will doubtlefs  
think this inttitution, worthy of a review,  
and give it thole improvements of which  
you find it fufceptible.  
  
Eftimates for the naval department  
prepared by the fecretary of the navy for  
another year, will in like manner be com-  
  
municated with the general éitimates. A  
{mall force in the Mediterranean will full  
be neceilary to reftrain the Tripoline  
cruifers ; and the uncertain tenure of  
peace with fome other of the Barbary  
powers, may eventually require that force  
to ke zugmented. The neceflity of pro-  
curing tome fmaller veffzis for the fervice,  
will raife the efimate ; but the difference  
in their maintenance will foon make it a  
meafure of economy.  
  
Prefuming it will be deemed expedient  
to expend annually a convenient fum to-  
ward providing for the naval defence which  
our fituation may require, 1 cannot but  
recommend that the firit appropriations  
for that purpofe, may go to the faving  
what we alicady pofieis. No cares, no  
attentions, can prelerve veflels from rapid  
decay, whicia lie in water, and expofed to  
the fun, Thee decays require great and  
  
22%  
  
conftant repairs, and will confume, if  
continued, a great portion of the monies  
deftined to naval purpofes. To avoid  
this wafte of our refources, it is propofed  
to add to our navy yard here a dock,  
within which our prefent veflels may be  
Jaid up dry, and under cover from the  
fun. Under thefe circumftances, experi-  
ence proves that works of wood will re-  
main {carcely at all affected by time. The  
great abundance of running water which  
this fituation poficffes, at heights far above  
the level of the tide, if employed as is  
practifed for lock navigation, furnifhes the  
means for raifing and laymg up our vef-  
fels, on a dry and theltered bed. And  
fhould the meafure be found ufeful here,  
fimilar depofitories for laying up, as well  
as for building and repairing veffels, may  
hereafter be undertaken at other navy  
yards, offering the fame means. ‘The  
plans aud eitimates of the work, prepared  
by a perfon of fkill and experience, will be  
prefented to you without delay ; and from  
thefe it will be feen that {carcely more  
than has been the coft of one veffel is ne-  
ceffary to fave the whole, and that thean-  
nual fum to be employed toward its com-  
pletion may be adapted to the views of the  
legiflature as to naval expenditure.  
  
To cultivate peace, and maintain com-  
merce and navigation in all their lawful  
enterprizes ; to fofter our fifheries as  
nurferies of navigation, and for the nur-  
ture of man, and proteét the manufactures  
adapted to our circumftances ; to prelerve  
the faith of the nation by an exa&amp; dif-  
charge of its debts and contraéts, expend  
the public money with the fame care and  
economy we would praétife with our own,  
and impofe on our citizens no unneceflary  
burdens ; to keep in all things within the  
pale of ovr conititutional powers, and  
cherifh the federal union, as the only rock  
of fatety ; thefe, fellow-citizens, are the  
landmarks by which we are to guide our-  
felves in all our proceedings. By con-  
tinuing to make thefe our rule of ac-  
tion, we fhall endear to our countrymen  
the true principles of their conftitution,  
and promote an union of fentiment and of  
aftion, equally gufpicious to their happi-  
nels and fafety, On my part you may  
count a cordial concyrrence in every mea-  
fure for the public good ; and on all the  
information I poflefs which may enable  
you to difcharge to advantage the high  
tunétions with which you are inveited by  
you country.

you,&#x27; that the receipts ofeXternal dutic&#x27;s for  
&quot;he lafi twelve months, have exceeded  
those of &quot;any former year, and that the  
ratio of increase has been also greater than

the regular exigencies of government, to  
pay from the treasury within one year,  
upwards of eight million&#x27;s of dollars prin­

son recommended the erection of a dock at the Navy Yard at  
Washington. “ Presuming it will be deemed expedient to  
expend annually a convenient sum towards providing the  
naval defence which our situation may require, I cannot  
but recommend that the first appropriations for that purpose  
may go tothe saving what we already possess. No cares, no at-  
tentions, can preserve vessels from rapid decay, which lie in  
water, .and exposed to the sun. ‘These decays requiré great  
and constant repairs, and will consume, if continued, a great  
portion of the monies destined to naval purposes. To avoid  
this waste of our resources, it is proposed to add to our navy  
yard here, a dock, within which our present vesels may be  
jaid up dry, and under cover from the sun. Under these cir-  
cumstances, experience proves that works of wood will remain  
scarcely at all affected by time. The great abundance of run-  
ning water which this situation possesses, at heights far above  
the level of the tide, if employed as is practiced for lock navi-  
gation, furnishes the means for raising and laying up our ves-  
sels on adry and sheltered bed. And should the measure be  
found useful here, similar depositories for laying up, as well  
as for building and repairing vessels, may hereafter be under-  
taken at other navy yards offering the same means.”

On the restoration of peace in Europe that portion  
of the general carrying trade which had fallen to  
our share during the war was abridged by the return­  
ing competition of the belligerent powers. This was  
to be expected and was just. But, in addition, we  
find in some parts of Europe monopolizing discrimi­  
nations, which, in the form of duties, tend effectively  
to prohibit the carrying thither our own produce in  
our own vessels. From existing amities and a spirit  
of justice it is to be hoped that friendly discussion  
will produce a fair and adequate reciprocity. But  
should false calculations of interest defeat our hope,  
it rests with the Legislature to decide whother they  
will not meet inequalities abroad with countervail­  
ing inequalities at home, or provide for the evil in  
any other way
