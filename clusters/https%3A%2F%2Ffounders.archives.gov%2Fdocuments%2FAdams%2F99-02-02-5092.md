It was a noble enactment of the founders of the  
New-England System of Free Schools,—that the morals  
of the teachers should be good, and that Good Behavior  
  
  
  
should staud as conspicuously among the things to be  
learned, as Reading and Arithmetic. It is a noble  
thing, too, that in the Constitution of Massachusetts,  
the fundamental law of the State, in reference to the  
encouragement of learning, it was provided that “it  
shall be the duty of legislatures and magistrates, in all  
future periods of this Commonwealth, to countenanee  
and inculcate the principles of humanity and general  
benevolence, public and private charity, industry and

real or personal, of a considerable  
amount, is generally the product of such  
thrifty and frugal habits, that to tax

public good. In the constitution of the  
commonwealth (chapter 5, section 2) It
