Dear Sir,  
  
  
  
Montpellier  
  
March 15th. 1833  
  
  
I return my thanks for the copy of your late very powerful speech in the Senate of the United States. It  
crushes &quot;nullification&quot; and must hasten an abandonment of &quot;Secession&quot;. But this dodges the blow by confounding the claim  
to secede at will, with the right of seceding from intolerable oppression. The former answers itself, being a violation  
without cause, of a faith solemnly pledged. The latter is another name only for revolution, about which there is no  
theoretic controversy. Its double aspect, nevertheless, with the countenance received from certain quarters, is giving it  
a popular currency here which may influence the approaching elections both for Congress and for the State Legislature. It  
has gained some advantage also by mixing itself with the question whether the Constitution of the United States was formed  
by the people or by the States, now under a theoretic discussion, by animated partizans.  
It is fortunate when disputed theories, can be decided by undisputed facts. And here the undisputed fact is,  
that the Constitution was made by the people, but as embodied into the several States, who were parties to it, and  
therefore made by the States in their highest authoritative capacity. They might by the same authority, and by the same  
process, have converted the Confederacy, into a mere league or treaty, or continued it with enlarged or abridged powers;  
or have embodied the people of their respective States into one people nation or sovereignty; or as they did, by a mixed  
form, make them one people, nation or sovereignty for certain purposes; and not so for others.  
The Constitution of the United States being established by a competent authority, by that of the sovereign  
people of the several States who were the parties to it; it remains only to enquire what the Constitution is; and here it  
speaks for itself: It organizes a Government into the usual Legislative, Executive and Judiciary Departments; invests it  
with specified powers, leaving others to the parties to the Constitution; it makes the Government like other Governments  
to operate directly on the people; [it] places at its command the needful physical means of executing its powers; and  
finally it proclaims its supremacy and that of the laws made in pursuance of it, over the Constitution and laws of the  
States; the powers of the Government being exercised, as in other elective and responsible Governments, under the control  
of its constituents the people and Legislatures of the States, and subject to the revolutionary rights of the people in  
extreme cases. [Such] is the Constitution of the United States de jure and de facto; and the name whatever it be, that may  
be given to it, can make it nothing more or less than what it actually is. Pardon this hasty effusion, which whether  
precisely according or not with your ideas, presents, I am aware, none that will be new to you. With great esteem  
&amp; cordial salutations

gained some advantage, also, by mixing itself  
with the que&gt;tion, whether the constitution ot  
the United Stales was formed by the people or  
bj the States, now under a theoretic discussion  
by animated partisans.  
  
“It is fortunate when disputed theories can

&quot;MoNTPElIER, March 15, 1833.  
&quot;My dear sir: I return my thanks for  
the copy of your late very powerful speech  
in the Senate of the United States. It  
crushes &quot;nullification,&#x27; and must hasten an  
abandonment of &quot;secession.&quot; But this  
dodges the blow, by confounding the claim  
to secede at will with the right of seceding  
from intolerable oppression. The former  
answers itself, being a violation without  
cause of faith solemnly pledged. The  
latter is another name only for revolution,  
about which there is no theoretic contro­  
versy. Its double aspect, nevertheless,  
with the countenance received from cer­  
tain quarters, is giving it a popular curren­  
cy here, which may influence the approach­  
ing elections both for Congress and for the  
  
State Legislature. It has gained some ad­  
vantages also by mixing itself with the  
question, whether the Constitution of the  
United States was for med by the people  
or by the States, now under a theoretic  
discussion by animated partisans.  
&quot;It is fortunate when disputed theories  
can be decided by undisputed facts; and  
here the undisputed fact is, that the Con­  
stitution was made by the people, but as  
embodied into the several States who  
were parties to it, and therefore made by  
the States in their highest authoritative  
capacity. They might, by the same au  
thority and by the same process, have  
converted the confederacy into a mere  
league or treaty, or continued it with en­  
larged or abridged powers, or have embo­  
died the people of their respective States  
into one people, nation, or sovereignty; or,  
as they did, by a mixed form, make them  
one people, nation, or sovereignty for cer­  
tain purposes, and not so for others.  
The Constitution of the United States  
being established by a competent authority  
--by that of the sovereign people of the  
several States who were parties to it--it  
remains only to inquire what the constitu­  
tion is; and here it speaks for itself. It  
organizes a government into the usual  
legislative, executive and judiciary depart­  
ments; invests it with specified powers,  
leaving others to the parties to the consti­  
tution. It makes the Government, like  
other Governments, to operate directly on  
the people; places at its command the  
needful physical means of executing its  
powers; and finally proclaims its supre­  
macy, and that of the laws made in pursu­  
ance of it, over the Constitutions and laws  
of the States, the powers of the Govern­  
ment being exercised, as in other elective  
and responsible governments, under the  
 control of its constituents, the people and  
the legislatures of the States, and subject  
to the revolutionary rights of the people,  
in extreme cases.  
&quot;Such is the Constitution of the United  
States de jure and de facto; and the name,  
whatever it be, that may be given to it, can  
make it nothing more or less than what it is.  
&quot;Pardon this hasty effusion, which,  
whether precisely according or not with

aspect, nevertheless, with the countenance received ao  
  
ecrtain quarters, is giving it a popular currency hee which  
may influence the approaching elections both for Congress  
and for the State Legislature. It has gained some advar t-  
age, also, by mixing itself with the question whether the

animated partisans. ”  
  
It is fortunate when disputed theories can be decided by  
undisputed facts ; and here the undisputed fact is, that the  
Constitution was made by the people, but as embodied int

made by the States in their highest authoritative capacity

or have embodied the people of their respective States into

mixed form, make them one people, nation, or soverejons,  
for certain purposes, and not so for others.  
  
The Constitution of the United States, being established  
by a competent authority, by that of the sovereign people  
of the several States who were parties to it, it remains only  
to inquire what the Constitution is ; and here it speaks for  
itself. It organizes a governmentinto the usual legislative

&quot;MotNPeLIER, March 15, 1830.  
Dear Sir- I return my thanks for the copy of  
your late very powerful speech in the Senate of  
the United States. It crushes &quot;nullification  
and must hasten an abandonment of secession.  
But this dodges the blow by confounding the

from intolerable oppression.  
The former answers itself, being a violation  
without cause of faith solemnly pledged. The  
latter is another name only for revolution, about  
which there is no theoretic controversy. Its  
double aspect, nevertheless, with the countenance  
received from certain quarters, is giving it a  
popular currency here which may influence the  
approaching elections, both for Congress and the  
State Legislatures. It has gained some advan­  
tage also by mixing itself with the question:  
whether the Constitution of the United States  
was formed by the people or by the States, now  
ander  theoretic discussion by animated parti  
It is fortunate when disputed theories can  
be decided by undisputed facts. And here the  
undisputed fact is that the Constitution was made  
by the people, but as embodied into the several  
States who were parties to it, and therefore made  
by the States in their highest authoritative capa  
city.  
They might, by the same authority and by the  
same process, have converted the Confederacy  
into a mere league or treaty, or continued it  
with enlarged or abridged powers, or have em  
bodied the people of their respective States into  
one people, nation or sovereignty; or, as they did  
by a mixed form, make them one people, nation  
or sovereignty, for certain purposes, and not so  
for others  
The Constitution of the United States, being  
established by a competent authority- by that of  
the people of the several States who were the  
parties to it--it remains only to inquire what  
the Constitution is; and here it speaks for itself.  
It organizes a Government into the usual legis­

invests it with specified powers, leaving  
others to the parties to the Constitution;  
it makes the Government to operate directly  
on the people; places at its command the  
needful physical means of executing its

the Constitution and laws of the States, the

other elective and responsible Governments, un­  
der the control of its constituents--the people  
and Legislatures of the States,-and subject to  
the revolutionary rights of the people in extreme  
cases  
Such is the Constitution of the United States  
de jure and de facto, and the name, whatever it  
be, that may be given to it, can make it nothing  
more nor less than what it actually is  
Pardon this hasty effusion, which, whether ac­  
cording or not precisely with your ideas, presents,  
I am aware, none that are now to you.

by th people or by the states, now under a  
thetretic disouosi n by amtntted partisans.  
It is fortunate when disputed theories can be  
decided by undisputed tacts. And here the  
undisputed fact is. that the constitution was  
mado by the people, but as embodied into the  
several states who were parties tj it, and.  
therefore, made by the states io their highest  
authoritative capacity.  
Tbey might, by the same authority and by  
the same process have convened the confed­  
eracy into a mere league or treaty, or contin­  
ued it with enlarged or abridged powers, or  
have embodied the people of their repoctive  
states iuto people, nntion or sovereignty ; or,  
as they did by a mixed form, make them one  
people, nation or sovereignty, for oeriain pur­  
poses, and not so fur others  
The constitution of the United Stares, be  
ing established by a competent authority  
by that of the people of the several states  
who were the parties to it it remains only  
to inquire what the consti&#x27;ution is ; and here  
it speaks for itself. It organises a govern  
ment into the usual legislative, executive and  
judiciary departments; invests it with i peri  
lled powers, leaving others to the parties to  
the constitution ; it makes the government to  
operate directly on the people; places at its  
command the needful physical means of exe  
euting its powers ; and. finally, proclaims its  
supremacy, and that ot the laws made in pur  
nuance of it. over the constitution and laws of  
the states, the powers of the government be­  
ing exercised as in other elective and respon­  
sible governments, under the control of its  
constituents the people and the legislatures  
of the spates an I subject to the revolution­  
ary rights of the people in extreme case.  
Such is the constitution of the United  
States dejure and de facto, and tho name,  
whatever it be, that may be given to it, can  
make it nothing more nor less than what it  
actually is.  
Pardon this hasty effusion&quot; which, whether  
according or not precisely with your ideas,  
presents, I am aware, none that are new to  
you.  
With great esteem and cordial salutation,  
James Madisok
