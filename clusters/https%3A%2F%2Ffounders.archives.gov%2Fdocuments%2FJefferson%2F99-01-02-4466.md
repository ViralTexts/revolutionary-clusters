mith may notify in his paper that I have recieved a letter from Capt. Lewis dated at St. Louis Sep. 23.  
at which place himself, capt Clarke &amp; their party arrived that day. they had past the preceding Winter at a place which  
he calls Fort Clatsop near the mouth of the Columbia river. they set out thence on the 27th. of March last, &amp; arrived at  
the foot of the Rocky mountains May 10, where they were detained until June 24, by the snows which rendered the passage  
over those mountains impracticable until then. he found it 2575 miles from the mouth of the Missouri to the great falls of that  
river, thence by land passing the Rocky mountains to a navigable part of the Kooskooske 340. miles, of which 200 would  
admit good road, and 140 miles over tremendous mountains which for 60 miles are covered with eternal snows. then 73. miles  
down the Kooskooske into a South Eastwardly branch of the Columbia, 154 miles down that to the main river of the Columbia,  
&amp; then 413. miles to the Pacific in all 3555. miles from the mouth of the Missouri to the mouth of the Columbia. in this  
last river the tide flows 183. miles, to within 7. miles of it’s great rapids, and so far would admit large sloops; and  
from thence upwards may be navigated by batteaux &amp; piriagurs. he speaks of this whole line furnishing the most valuable  
furs in the world, and a short &amp; direct course for them to the Eastern coast of China; but that the greatest part of  
these would be from the head of the Missouri. he says it is fortunate he did not send back from the head of the Missouri  
any part of his force, consisting of 31. men, as more than once they owed their lives &amp; the fate of the expedition to  
their numbers. one man of his party had died before he reached fort Mandan in 1804. every other one is returned in good  
health.  
Capt Lewis expected to remain at St. Louis some days to settle with &amp; discharge his men, &amp; would then  
set out for Washington, by the way of Vincennes, Louisville, Abington, Fincastle, Staunton &amp; Charlottesville. he is  
accompanied by the great Mandan chief, who is on a visit to Washington. Capt Lewis speaks of his colleague, Capt Clarke,  
in the most affectionate terms, and declares his equal title to whatever merit may be ascribed to the success of this  
enterprize

From Washington we learn that Captaia  
Lewis, with his exploring party, had arriv-  
ed at St. Louis. They passed the last win-  
ter at a place which Captain Lewis calls fort  
Crutsop, near the mouth of Columbia river,  
and set out from thence on the 27th of  
March !ast, and arrived at the foot of the  
rocky mountains May 10th, and were de.  
tained by snow on the mountains til! June  
24th. Capt. Lewis found it 2,575 miles  
from the mouth of the Missouri to the great  
fails, thence by land, passing the rocky  
mountains to a navigable part of the Kooske,  
340 miles, of which 200 would admit of a  
good road, and 140 miles over tremendous  
inountains, which for 60 miles are covered  
with eternal snows——Then 73 miles dowa  
the Kooske into a south eastwardly branch  
of the Columbia, 154 miles down that to the  
main river of the Columbia, and then 413  
miles tothe Pacific, in all 3,555 from the  
mouth of the Missouri tu the mouth of the  
Columbia. In this last river the tide flows  
183 miles, to within 7 miles of its great ra-  
pids, and so far would admit large sloops;  
and from thence upwards, may be navigated  
by batteaux and periaugers, Capt. Lewis  
speaks of this line as furnishing the most va-  
luable furs in the world, and a short and di-

The President of the United States has received a  
&#x27; letter from him,dated at St. Louis, Sept. 23, at which  
place himself, capt. Clark, and their party, arrived  
that day. 1 hey had,passid the preceding winter at  
a place which he. calls Fort Clatsop, near the mouth  
of the Columbia river. They set out from thence  
on the 27th March last, and arrived at the foot of  
the Uock v -Mountains May 10, where they were de­  
tained until June 2t, by the snows which rendered  
the passage over those mountains impracticable un­  
til then, lie found it 2375 miles from the mouth  
of the Missouri’ to the great falls of that river,  
thence by land passing the Rocky mountains to a  
navigable part of the Kooskooske 340 miles, of  
which 200 would admit good road, and 140 miles  
over tremendous mountains, which for 60 miles are  
covered with eternal snows, then 73 miles down the

Columbia, 154 miles down that to the main Viter  
of Columbia, and then 4t3 tniles to the Pacific,’in  
all 3555 miles from the mouth of the Missouri to  
the mouth of the Columbia. In this last river the  
tide flows 133 miles, to within seven mile&#x27;s of its  
great rapids, and so far would admit large sloops ;  
i nd from thence upwards may be navigated by bat­  
teaux and pettyaugers.  
lie speaks op this whole line furnishing the most  
valuable furs in the world, and a short and direct  
course for them to the eastern coast of China; bu  
that the greatest |)art of these would be from the  
head of the Missouri, lie says it is fortunate lie  
did not send back from the head of the Missouri any  
part of his force, consisting of 31 men, as more  
than once they owed their lives and the fate of tin  
expedition to their numbers. One man of his pat­  
ty had died before he reached Mandan, in 1804—e­  
very other one is returned in good health.  
Capt. I,f\v;s expected to remain at St. Louis some  
days to settle with and discharge his men, and would  
then set out lot Washington, by the way of Vincen­  
nes, Louisville, Abbington, Fincastle, Staunton and  
Charlottesville. lie is accompanied by the great  
Mandan chi d, who is on a visit to Washington.

thence onthe 27cthof March aft, and

tains May 10, where they were de­  
tained until June 24, by the snows |  
which rendered the p:flge over those I

He found it two thousand five hun­
