r Miss,  
London, Sept. 26. 1773 [1772]  
I lament with you most sincerely the unfortunate End of poor Mungo: Few Squirrels were better accomplish’d; for he had had a good Education, had travell’d far, and seen much of the World. As he had the Honour of being for his Virtues your Favourite, he should not go like common Skuggs without an Elegy or an Epitaph. Let us give him one in the monumental Stile and Measure, which being neither Prose nor Verse, is perhaps the properest for Grief; since to use common Language would look as if we were not affected, and to make Rhimes would seem Trifling in Sorrow.  
  
  
Alas! poor Mungo!  
Happy wert thou, hadst thou known  
Thy own Felicity!  
Remote from the fierce Bald-Eagle,  
Tyrant of thy native Woods,  
Thou hadst nought to fear from his piercing Talons;  
Nor from the murdering Gun  
Of the thoughtless Sportsman.  
Safe in thy wired Castle,  
Grimalkin never could annoy thee.  
Daily wert thou fed with the choicest Viands  
By the fair Hand  
Of an indulgent Mistress.  
But, discontented, thou wouldst have more Freedom.  
Too soon, alas! didst thou obtain it,  
And, wandering,  
Fell by the merciless Fangs,  
Of wanton, cruel Ranger.  
Learn hence, ye who blindly wish more Liberty,  
Whether Subjects, Sons, Squirrels or Daughters,  
That apparent Restraint may be real Protection,  
Yielding Peace, Plenty, and Security.  
  
You see how much more decent and proper this broken Stile, interrupted as it were with Sighs, is for the Occasion, than if one were to say, by way of Epitaph,  
  
Here Skugg  
Lies snug  
As a Bug  
In a Rug.  
  
And yet perhaps there are People in the World of so little Feeling as to think, that would be a good-enough Epitaph for our poor Mungo!  
If you wish it, I shall procure another to succeed him. But perhaps you will now chuse some other Amusement. Remember me respectfully to all the [torn] good Family; and believe me ever, Your affectionate Friend  
B Frankli

common skuggs, without an elegy or an epitaph. Let us give him one in  
the monumental style and measure, which, being neither prose nor verse, is  
perhaps the properest for grief; since, to use common language wou&#x27;d look  
as if we were not affected, and to make rhymes would seem trifling in  
sorrow.  
  
  
  
  
  
MUNGO,  
  
EPITAPH.  
  
Alas! poor MUNGO!  
Happy wert thou, hadst thou known  
Thy own felicity.  
Remote from the fierce bald eagle,  
Tyrant of thy native woods,  
Thou hadst nought to fear from his piercing talons,  
Nor from the murdering gun  
Of the thoughtless sportsman.  
Safe in thy wired castle,  
GRIMALKIN never could annoy thee.  
Daily wert thou fed with the choicest viands,  
By the fair hand of an indulgent mistress ;  
But, discontented,  
Thou wouldst have more freedom.  
Too soon, alas! didst thou obtain it;  
And wandering,  
Thou art fallen by the fangs of wanton, cruel RANGER  
Learn hence,  
Ye, who blindly seek more liberty,  
Whether subjects, sons, squirrels, or daughters,  
That apparent restraint may be real protection.  
Yielding peace and plenty  
With security.  
You see, my dear Miss, how much more decent and proper this broken  
style is, than if we were to say, by way of epitaph —  
Here SKUGG  
Lies snug,  
As a bug  
In a rug.  
And yet, perhaps, there are people in the world of so little feeling as to  
think that this would be a good enough epitaph for poor Mungo.  
If you wish it, I shall procure another to succeed him ; but perhaps you  
will now choose some other amusement.  
Remember me affectionately to all the good family, and believe me ever  
your affectionate friend, B. FRANKLIN
