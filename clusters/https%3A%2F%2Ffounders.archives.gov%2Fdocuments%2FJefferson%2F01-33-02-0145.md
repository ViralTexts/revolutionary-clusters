rasp at the Shadow have lost the Substance. Their Power &amp; Influence is gone forever—a divine Infatuation seems to have seized on them &amp; on all the Enemies of Man at the same time &amp; will lead them to their merited Destruction. Some of my Friends however, fear that they will say with Milton’s fallen Angels  
  
“We neither repent nor  
change  
What though the Field be lost  
All is not lost; th’unconquerable will,  
  
And Study of  
Revenge, immortal hate,  
And Courage never to submit or yield.”  
  
But happily, I think, we may say, that they can not proceed, &amp; say with those congenial Spirits,

That glory never shall success, or might  
Extort from us.”

any and all unbiased minds, have we  
not the evidence in abundance to ful­  
ly satisfy us believing that a buried  
hate lies lurking in their heart of  
hearts toward this government since  
the close of the war in 1865? that  
simply awaits a favorable time for  
full development. Milton well and  
truly defines the position of the Dem­  
ocratic party in its true relation to  
this government, in the language of  
the Arch enemy to Beelzebub, in ref­  
erence to their fallen condition, when  
he exclaimed: &quot;What though the  
field be lost? All is not lost; th&#x27; un­
