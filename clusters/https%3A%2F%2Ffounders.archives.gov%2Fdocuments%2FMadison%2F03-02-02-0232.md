Sir,  
I had the pleasure yesterday of receiving an ad­

my service as a soldier, and praises my patriotism.  
It is true I lo\p the country of tny birth, for it is

thtrs, but it is the only spot where I could wear out  
the remnant of my d.iys wiih any satisfaction.  
Twice my country has been invaded by foreign

peace. Aud when the object was gained, 1 returnid  
to my farm and my original occupation. I have  
ever valued peace so high, that I would not sacri­  
fice it for any thing but freedom j yet submission

I was pleased with your dismissal of the man  
| the English sent to insult us, because they will sc«  
by the experiment that we are the same nation  
that we were in 70’—grown strong by ege.aud hav­

If the enmity of the Briiist) nation is to be fear­

have fought with them t.ud against them, and found  
them treacherous and ungenerous as friends and dis­

However, among all the dangers that I have been

DERRYFIELD, January 21, 1810.  
  
Sir: I had the pleasure, yesterday, of  
receiving an address from the chief  
magistrate of the only republic on  
earth. The letter compliments me  
highly upon my services as a soldier,  
and praises my patriotism. It is true  
that I love the country of my birth, for  
it is the only country I should choose  
above all others, and it is the only spot  
where I could wear out the remnant of  
  
  
  
my days with any satisfaction. Twice  
has my country has been invaded by for-  
eign enemies, and twice I went with others  
to obtain peace. And when the object  
was gained, I returned to my farm, and  
my original occupation. I have ever  
valued peace so high, that I would not  
sacrifice it for anything but freedom ;  
yet submission to insult I never thought  
was the way to gain either.  
  
I was pleased with your dismissal of  
the man the English sent to insult us,  
because they will see by the experiment  
that we are the same nation that we  
were in &#x27;76, grown strong by age, and  
having gained wisdom by experience.  
If the enmity of the British nation is  
to be feared, their alliance is much  
more dangerous; for I have fought  
with them and against them, and I  
found them treacherous and ungener-  
ous as friends, and dishonorable as  
enemies. I have tried the French like-  
wise, first as enemies then as friends ;  
and although all the strong partialities  
of my youth were against them, still I  
formed a more favorable opinion of  
them. Still let us watch them. How-  
ever, among all the dangers that I have  
been a witness to affecting our country,  
and our republican institutions, perhaps  
there are none that require a more  
watchful eye than our internal factious  
divisions. If the communication of  
the result of my experience can be of  
any use in the approaching storm, or if  
any use can be derived from any exam-  
ple of mine, my strongest wish will be  
gratified. The few days, or works of  
the remainder of my life will be in  
friendship with James Madison.
